1
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:08,823
- [Voiceover] Do you
think you're a good child

2
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:10,858
to your parents?

3
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,811
- Why do you want to be on TV?

4
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,515
- I don't wanna be on TV.

5
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,717
- Why you gotta
film me and shit?

6
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:38,620
Is this like some kinda
intervention or something?

7
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:41,022
- I didn't ask to be here.

8
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:45,360
- This outward bound shit
is a lot better than rehab.

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,364
Or sleeping with my hands
over my ass in jail.

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,917
- I'm being punished
because I have a girlfriend.

11
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,021
- Reality TV.

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,373
Can't say I watch it too much.

13
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:01,042
- Describe yourself
with just single words.

14
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,327
- Okay, let's see.

15
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,264
Nice, sincere,

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,033
and innocent.

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,785
Is that gonna get me on?

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,336
- Protective.

19
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,338
- Unpredictable.

20
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,542
- Really? Come on.

21
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,510
That's like,

22
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,378
like a, is there
another question?

23
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,913
Cause,

24
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,418
- Shark fuckin' just
snatched it man,

25
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,086
like, a flip, I
went under and like,

26
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,556
when I came to I had one leg.

27
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,892
- Are you serious?

28
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:37,161
- Nah. I mean it sounds better

29
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:38,696
than a motorcycle
accident though.

30
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,881
Right?

31
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:42,234
- Why do you want to be on TV?

32
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,902
- I got good hair.

33
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:49,507
- Fuck you.

34
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,281
(Cellphone buzzing)

35
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,587
- [Voiceover] Mr. Barrett,
this is Kim France

36
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,388
of Globus Financial,
about your past,

37
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,157
- [Voiceover]
Julian, this is Brian

38
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,327
at Frontier Pictures, we
wanna talk Summer Camp reboot.

39
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,362
ASAP, give a shout.

40
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,564
- [Voiceover] It's me Barrett.

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,366
Money's been transferred.

42
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,568
Call me on this number.

43
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,521
- [Voiceover] How do
you feel about death?

44
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,557
- What?

45
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:24,525
(Clicking)

46
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:37,672
(light guitar music)

47
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:46,748
(light guitar music)

48
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:55,857
(light guitar music)

49
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,586
- [Myrna] So, how goes
the camp, Mr. Barrett?

50
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,403
- [Julian] Up and running
in two weeks, Mryna.

51
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,872
- Good. What can I getcha?

52
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:11,740
- The usual.

53
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,174
- I knew that, just checking.

54
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:14,509
- Thank you, darlin'.

55
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:19,414
- [Woman] Get in the
car, get in the car!

56
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,748
- [Michael] I'm gonna
speak to Julian.

57
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,083
- [Woman] You'e not gonna
speak to Julian, Michael.

58
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,384
- [Michael] Yes I am.
- [Woman] About what?

59
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,519
- [Michael] I need to
speak to him about,

60
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:28,422
(bells jingling)

61
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,601
- How goes it Sheriff?

62
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,003
- I was thinking
of making a visit,

63
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,905
little bit later on today.

64
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,340
- How's your deputy brother?

65
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,542
- [Myrna] Yeah, why
didn't Michael come in?

66
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,644
Tell him I got some
free pie, he doesn't

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,513
have to sit out
there in the heat.

68
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:53,598
- Yes, he does.

69
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,517
But thank you Myrna,
I'll tell him.

70
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,570
- Problems with
your deputy brother?

71
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,306
- Nothin' I can't handle.

72
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,343
- [Julian] Thank you Mynra.

73
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,244
- [Myrna] You're welcome again,

74
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:06,844
let me get you some utensils.

75
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,112
- [Julian] Okay

76
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,380
- My dad told me that
you two never got along

77
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,615
when you were making
your movies up here.

78
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,601
- He was right.

79
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:16,504
Now you and me are in
bed together, who knew?

80
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,139
Kinda awkward, don'tcha think?

81
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,809
- I never saw any of
your movies, not one.

82
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,711
I don't watch horror movies.

83
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,545
- Why is that?

84
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:28,566
- Well, because I
think that they suck.

85
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,736
- Okey dokey.

86
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,975
Oh, I uh,

87
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,880
haven't really said it but
I'm sorry about your dad.

88
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,351
To Ray, fuck cancer.

89
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,619
- Look, look, the only
reason that I am even

90
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,454
agreeing to do this,

91
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,557
is because my
father gave his life

92
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,926
for this cum stain of a town

93
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,494
and while you were here
and you're off making

94
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,762
your movies and getting
rich and everything

95
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,397
all he got was a pat on
the back and a gold watch

96
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:03,501
after 50 years of service,
while cancer ate his stomach.

97
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,653
- There goes my appetite.

98
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,940
Look, it ain't
gonna happen to you.

99
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,610
All you gotta do is
learn to play the game.

100
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,579
All you gotta do.

101
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,381
- [Sheriff] So much
for reality TV.

102
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,401
- There's no such
thing as reality TV.

103
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:22,136
It's all plotted out
down to the last detail.

104
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,640
Unlike our reality, Donyln.

105
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:28,543
- So, tell me about these kids
you've got comin' up here,

106
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,744
anything I need to know about?

107
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,679
- They're not kids, they're
in their 20's at least

108
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,982
and I told ya everything.

109
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,718
So, you really like
playin' sheriff?

110
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,655
- How bad does it have
to be when you've gotta

111
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,258
do what you're doing just
to go back to the well?

112
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,695
- Hell of a question.

113
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,332
- Life's been a bitch
to both of us, Julian.

114
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:52,650
- I guess so, baby.

115
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,235
- Cheers.

116
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,671
- So what's that for then?

117
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:59,373
- To getting out of this town.

118
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,191
- Hey, Myrna, I need
some more coffee.

119
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,395
- [Myrna] Sure.

120
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:17,575
(Gentle music)

121
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:27,568
(gentle music)

122
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:31,539
(gentle music)

123
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:35,576
(gentle music)

124
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,089
- Hey, it's good to finally
see you again, John.

125
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,926
- [John] So what's
going on, Julian?

126
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,528
- Flight was good?

127
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:56,096
- Well, first time I
ever flew first class

128
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:58,149
in this miserable career.

129
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,968
- Same old John.

130
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:03,271
Good to see you pal.

131
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:05,639
Let me show you around.

132
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,876
- My God.

133
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,245
Place hasn't changed
since the 80's.

134
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,880
Got Reagan stashed
here somewhere?

135
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:15,383
- Yeah he's dead but, I'm
still bangin' handsome.

136
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:18,253
- [Julian] That old cable
station owed me a favor.

137
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:19,653
- Techs laid out
three dozen cameras

138
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,822
in a two mile perimeter.

139
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:25,026
Pinhole cams get hooked
on to the contestants.

140
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,536
- Where's the crew?

141
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:36,721
- Hey pal, you're
lookin' at the crew.

142
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,241
- When's Rachel get in?

143
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,509
- Soon.

144
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,144
Yet the contestants oughta
be here ahead of her.

145
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,747
- Yeah, Julian, we gotta
talk about these contestants.

146
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:48,700
I have some pretty big concerns.

147
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,067
- Ah, let's wait for Rachel.

148
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,002
- They think they're
coming to some kinda

149
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,536
outward bound program, right?

150
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,055
- Well they are.

151
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,656
It's gonna build self esteem,

152
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:57,025
- Oh, Jesus, please don't
start with that bullshit.

153
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,160
Look, these are troubled kids.

154
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,161
They need real counselors.

155
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:01,563
Licensed therapists.

156
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,015
You got me and Rachel, so
unless I'm missin' something,

157
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,236
- Rachel went back to school
and became a counselor.

158
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,903
- And me?

159
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,539
Still haven't said why I'm here.

160
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,940
And do they know that
this is being pitched

161
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:14,592
as a reality show?

162
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,894
- It serves the
storyboard for Summer Camp

163
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,663
remake no matter what.

164
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,231
Hey, I'll tell 'em.

165
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,367
- So let me get this
straight, you plan a remake

166
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,001
of a film that you
have no funding for

167
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,087
based on a fake counseling camp

168
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:29,607
as a reality show for a
shot for shot template?

169
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,610
- Sounds pretty shitty
when you say it like that.

170
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,778
- You don't need me for this.

171
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,529
- Oh, come here.

172
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:36,697
Look what I found.

173
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,733
Check this out.

174
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,855
- No Julian! We're not
doing another take.

175
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,656
She's been in the water
for three fucking hours

176
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,891
she's freezing.

177
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,493
You're such a douchebag,
turn the fucking camera off,

178
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,728
turn the fucking camera off.

179
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,231
- So you fly me halfway
across the country

180
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,034
to bitch slap me with karma?

181
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,668
(Laughing)

182
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,286
- That's funny.

183
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,815
- [Young man] Does anybody
want anything to drink?

184
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,586
- [Girl] Tomato juice.

185
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,542
- I'll go pay.

186
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,186
(Whistling)

187
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:51,205
- Pump that gas hole.

188
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,508
You a top, bottom, or curious?

189
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,022
- Oh no, no, no.

190
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,924
The camp's got a tab here.

191
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,627
And a computer, there's
no internet out there.

192
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,595
- Really?

193
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,900
How'd you know I
was with the camp?

194
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:21,435
- Are you kiddin' me?

195
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,022
You're basically the only
folks under 60 round here.

196
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,896
- Yo, Adrienne.

197
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,867
So, we got shipped
off to fucking camp.

198
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,568
I just hope it turns out to be

199
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:38,870
a fucking camp.

200
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,938
Ya know what I mean?

201
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,432
- [Girl] Just admit, you're gay.

202
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,869
- You don't say shit to me
from the airport to here?

203
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,774
And now you fuck with me?

204
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,109
- Oh, am I fucking with you?

205
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,214
- Maybe you just wanna fuck me.

206
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,099
- Faggot, please.

207
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,869
- Say it again.

208
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:32,924
- You're so pretty, fucking
you would make me a dyke.

209
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,182
- [Voiceover] This is the
actual camp they used in those

210
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:44,618
summer camp movies,
that's awesome.

211
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:47,455
Think that other group is here?

212
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,389
- [Voiceover] Wonder
what they're like.

213
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:51,525
- [Voiceover] Can't be
anymore fucked up than us.

214
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,894
- [Voiceover] We'll
see about that.

215
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,431
- [Voiceover] That must be
their car, hope they're hot.

216
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,723
- There they are.

217
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,126
My future stars.

218
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:30,765
So, any problems at the airport?

219
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,367
- Had a great reach
around by the TSA.

220
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,437
- Is that a fact?

221
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:37,738
I'm Julian Barrett,
please tell me your name

222
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:39,073
and where you're from.

223
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,208
- Novak, Metcalf.

224
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:43,510
- Sarah, Wesport, Conneticut.

225
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:46,047
- Vinny, my mom's vagina.

226
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,468
- [Adrienne] Adrienne, all over.

227
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:53,437
- Matthew, people call me Matty,

228
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,939
I'm from Jackson, New Jersey.

229
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:55,739
- Good to meet you Matty.

230
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,541
- Katie, Pennsylvania.

231
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,043
- Pennsylvania.

232
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,715
- You got cameras
in our bathrooms?

233
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,201
Can you watch us takin' a dump?

234
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,270
- Bathrooms are camera free.

235
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:10,804
- Right.

236
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,490
- There's no service in
this bumblefuck town, man.

237
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,358
- [Julian] Let's move it.

238
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,626
- Just saying...

239
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:25,436
(eerie orchestral music)

240
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:32,459
(eerie orchestral music)

241
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,700
- Home sweet home.

242
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:42,770
Great.

243
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,582
- Thanks. Got any boxers?

244
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:19,473
(Creepy piano music)

245
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,242
(breathing loudly)

246
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:34,198
(suspenseful music)

247
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,921
(water splashing)

248
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,159
- Camera's every man.

249
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,694
You gonna need a wider lens
if you gonna get all of this.

250
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,883
(Coughing)

251
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,241
(laughing)

252
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:02,776
- Shit.

253
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,151
- I know you all have
a lot of questions.

254
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:14,271
So, I'll get right to
the fact of the matter.

255
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,740
Okay, you're all
forced to come here,

256
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:20,911
it was either this, jail, or
rehab for almost all of you.

257
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:24,448
Fortunately, you all have
parents who care about you

258
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,517
and though I know most of
you don't believe that,

259
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,619
I think by the time
this speech is over,

260
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,404
you're gonna be
happy you're here.

261
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,973
I'm Julian Barrett.

262
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:34,975
I directed and wrote a
series of horror films

263
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,728
in the 1980's
called Summer Camp.

264
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,314
Now, while you're here
to work on yourselves,

265
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,932
there's the opportunity
to have some fun

266
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,235
and win a considerable
amount of money.

267
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,704
- Fuck this.

268
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,838
I'm out.

269
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,557
- The winner gets
a million dollars.

270
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,163
- So, we're a bunch of fuck ups

271
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,366
and we get a shot at
a million dollars?

272
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,034
God bless America.

273
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:02,235
- Who knew?

274
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,538
Your head counselor
is Rachel Steel

275
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:06,239
from my films.

276
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,876
- I can't believe this,
I've never been so wet.

277
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:12,413
Rachel Fucking Steel.

278
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,651
- And this is the camp kitchen,

279
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,187
it has everything
you can think of.

280
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,297
- [Vinny] Pinocchio!

281
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,669
- It's a walk through
freezer, it's off

282
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:38,338
and the latch is broken,
stay away from it.

283
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:40,374
Follow me.

284
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,109
- Follow that ass anywhere.

285
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:49,817
(Ominous music)

286
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:52,569
- As you know from your
agreement this is a real camp,

287
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,238
these are real woods with
real critters in them.

288
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,574
Bears are no stranger
to this place.

289
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,276
Big, black bears.

290
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,177
Okay, should there
ever be a problem,

291
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,999
there's a handgun in the
main desk in the boathouse.

292
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:06,733
There's ammo as well.

293
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:08,219
- You put a handgun in
the drawer and just let us

294
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,221
casually know it's there?

295
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,722
- Well you'll be glad I
did if you find yourself

296
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,558
being chased by a
400 pound black bear.

297
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,496
- Oh man, why's it always
gotta be a black thing, huh?

298
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,231
- Come on man.

299
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,850
- [Julian] That would be
funny, if that were funny.

300
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,752
- I'm just saying.

301
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,553
- Follow me.

302
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,924
Some cameras are still photos.

303
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,726
Resign yourself to the
idea that you're being

304
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:35,529
recorded all the time, okay?

305
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,330
- See I just don't
understand how we went

306
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,333
from being punished to now
we're on a reality show.

307
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,136
- Well, this is experimental,
it may never get picked up.

308
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,406
- If it doesn't get picked
up does it have anything

309
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:46,640
to do with the million bucks?

310
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:49,410
- No, the last one
standing gets it.

311
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:51,077
Last word on that.

312
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:53,580
And why do you look at a
chance to correct yourself

313
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:55,148
as being punished?

314
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:56,883
- No bro, he's just saying.

315
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,752
- Yo, I wanna get
caught jerkin' off,

316
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,055
you know like really goin' at
it, like all red in the face

317
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,692
and like sweatin' and shit,
so then they can't blur it out

318
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,026
and then all the
uptight people watch it

319
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,661
and they get all offended
and they start complainin'

320
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:10,564
and then they just start
trendin' me on Twitter and shit.

321
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,100
- How much thought
did you put into that?

322
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,676
- [Julian] 12 hour batteries
and everything's waterproof.

323
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:24,478
Charge overnight and
you have a backup,

324
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:27,314
keep it pinned chest
high or shoulder level,

325
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:30,150
they get everything
and what they don't get

326
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:32,586
the other three dozen will.

327
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,357
Okay, let's hustle up guys.

328
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,694
- Yo, I'm outta here, guys,

329
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,263
no way I'm doing this
bullshit for this kook,

330
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:44,531
I'm just sayin'.

331
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:45,916
- You know, I gotta
tell you something,

332
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,019
I find the phrase "just sayin"
to be a passive agressive

333
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,704
pussy way of trying
to get the last word.

334
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,490
If you want the last
word in an argument

335
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,676
just say, last word.

336
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,478
It throws the other person off,

337
00:19:57,513 --> 00:20:00,647
you're sayin' I claimed
the last word, period.

338
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:03,550
That's the way to
do it with balls.

339
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,820
Or, you just punch
your no dick opponent

340
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:08,656
right the fuck out.

341
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:10,357
- Yep, but reality TV?

342
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:14,511
You can't TV reality,
I need rehab, okay?

343
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,313
And we all signed up for rehab.

344
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,664
- Not me.

345
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,651
- Okay, but rehab it's
like outward bound camp,

346
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,221
you can't just do a
switcheroo and throw

347
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,889
a million buck at ya.

348
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:29,225
- I'll let anyone throw
a million bucks at me.

349
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,779
- The only way out
is elimination.

350
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,750
If a single one of you forfeits,
you all lose the money.

351
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,703
Last word.

352
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,109
- Okay, I don't know
why you guys are here,

353
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,877
but I know why I'm here.

354
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,379
And this doesn't even
make sense to me,

355
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,014
I fucking hate horror movies.

356
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,568
- Fuck, you will not ruin my
shot at a million dollars,

357
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:57,387
asshole, last word.

358
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,355
- Lower your voice.

359
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,073
- Just sayin', who's with me?

360
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:02,643
- I will eliminate you.

361
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,744
- Hey, hey Novak.

362
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:04,845
- I will eliminate you!

363
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,029
- [Matty] Stop, relax, relax!

364
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,313
- [Novak] He's gonna
ruin it for all of us!

365
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,348
- Just relax!

366
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:08,882
- I'm not goin'
to fuckin' rehab.

367
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,050
- Get out.

368
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:11,685
- [Calvin] Calm
the fuck down, man.

369
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,320
- I'm not goin'
to fucking rehab.

370
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,789
- Alright, just relax.

371
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:24,615
(Ominous, pulsing music)

372
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:13,213
(bugs chirping)

373
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:19,203
(coughing)

374
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,459
(cell phone chiming)

375
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,597
- What the fuck?

376
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,851
(Whoosing)

377
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:56,473
(screaming)

378
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,545
- So this kid
threatens to walk off

379
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,530
and you don't even care?

380
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:06,300
- It's ten miles to
town, he's not a kid,

381
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:07,684
and he's walkin' nowhere.

382
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,053
- He's a walking lawsuit,
Julian, that's what he is.

383
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,588
Jesus, you haven't
learned anything.

384
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:15,058
- John, John you
starred in three films.

385
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,577
- Two, Julian, two.

386
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,128
I was signed for more,

387
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,079
- Where you and Rachel hacked,
impaled, and burned kids

388
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:23,033
to death and now you have an
issue with scaring children?

389
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,634
What's up with you pal?

390
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,986
- Julian, I read their
profiles on the flight here

391
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:28,455
and these people have
some serious issues,

392
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,774
I mean out of everyone
you tried out, why them?

393
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,009
John's right, messing
with their minds,

394
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,046
- You mess with
millions of minds, doll.

395
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,615
- I think that's why I got
out and I went back to school

396
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,117
for counseling.

397
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,718
- And we weren't trying
to say our work was real,

398
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,086
for Christ sakes,
their movies Julian,

399
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:43,853
you know that.

400
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,089
This is mental abuse.

401
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,541
And Rachel, please don't
get all high and mighty

402
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,093
about your new career.

403
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,695
Alright, we all know that
work dried up for you

404
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,863
after these shit films,
no offense Julian,

405
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,832
and you got tired
of stalkers sending

406
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,183
you cum-stained fan letters.

407
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,869
- Whoo! That's rough.

408
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:02,105
Look, look you both slummed
from one horror convention

409
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,708
to another signing autographs
for ten buck a pop,

410
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,109
not bad dude.

411
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,494
- And you had your
assistant hand deliver me

412
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,530
a pretty little note
saying I was dropped

413
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:12,532
from the second film when
I had a signed contract

414
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,033
for at least two more.

415
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:15,935
- I asked you to be
apart of this to make

416
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,003
amends for the past.

417
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,205
I apologize.

418
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,607
- Oh, you wanna pity fuck me.

419
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:22,058
- No, John, you fucked me.

420
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,744
And you fucked Rachel.

421
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:25,011
You had to go to
the press with your

422
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,663
on set safety issues.

423
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,264
- You had kids
getting hypothermia,

424
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,633
for Christ sake!

425
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,685
Unsafe cables in the water,
two props almost killed,

426
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,387
- You cost us all a
fourth film and my career

427
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:36,974
after two lawsuits drove
me to fucking bankruptcy

428
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,659
and the studio blacklisted
me, you son of a bitch.

429
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:41,377
- It's all in the past.

430
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:43,547
- And now you got
these messed up kids,

431
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,282
- They're not kids, John.

432
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,517
(Keyboard clacking)

433
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:52,305
Are you in or not?

434
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:01,982
- Well, Julian.

435
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:05,718
I'll tell you to your face,
cause that's how a man does it,

436
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:07,554
I'm out.

437
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,489
I'll work conventions
until I die before I work

438
00:25:09,524 --> 00:25:10,923
with you again.

439
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,025
Last word.

440
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:15,111
- I would tell you
to go fuck yourself

441
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,263
but you just did, last word.

442
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:24,788
- John!

443
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,423
- I'm done, Rachel.

444
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,592
- Are you really leaving?

445
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,943
John?

446
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,728
- What?

447
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,580
- Why did you come here?

448
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,417
- Cause I got a free
first class ticket to one

449
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,552
of my favorite
places in the world.

450
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:40,820
And you know what?

451
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:43,222
I'm really glad I
got to be here again.

452
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,242
And because I had just
the slightest hope

453
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:48,245
that just maybe,
after all these years,

454
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,514
things had changed a little bit.

455
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,082
But they haven't.

456
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,001
- Things have
changed, I've changed,

457
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:56,436
I am really here
to help these kids.

458
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,571
- What as a counselor?

459
00:25:58,607 --> 00:25:59,873
Please, Rachel, I've
seen your luggage,

460
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:02,309
you got like four wardrobe
changes a day in there,

461
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:04,511
you're already primpin'
for all the cameras.

462
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:07,614
We all know why you're here.

463
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:11,184
- You know what, John?

464
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,686
Fuck you.

465
00:26:15,691 --> 00:26:17,557
- Get out while you can, Rach.

466
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:20,693
(Ominous music)

467
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:26,299
- So I know this has been
one hell of a surprise

468
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:30,270
for all of you, but Jerry's
departure will not affect you,

469
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:32,072
we made an exception.

470
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:35,492
However, if any of
you should pull that,

471
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:38,361
the money is forfeited.

472
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,496
- I have so many questions!

473
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,667
- Rachel, you were in
all three films, right?

474
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,185
- Yeah but check it out,
look, in the second one,

475
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,486
in the third,

476
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,889
- Well, actually, I
was killed in part two

477
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:51,641
and I had a flashback
in part three,

478
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,311
but you know what, let's,
let's really get to

479
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,529
know each other, guys,

480
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:57,614
now is a good time,
before I actually tell you

481
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,616
how the TV show works.

482
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,234
- But you were the killer?

483
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:02,936
- Not in part two, John
Hill was the killer,

484
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,538
he drove me insane.

485
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:07,074
Since having all that fun
in the 80's, I went back

486
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:11,260
to school and I became
a therapist and,

487
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,563
- [Novak] Well,
that's real smart.

488
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:16,433
(Laughing)

489
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,786
- Guys, seriously, settle now.

490
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:22,556
You good?

491
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:27,827
And while this is an
experiment for television,

492
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:31,364
I'm really here
to help you guys,

493
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,200
to deal with all of those
issues that brought you here.

494
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,501
I wanna help you, okay?

495
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:38,405
- Now hold on, here's the
that thing I don't get.

496
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,075
We're all 21, over 21, how
can they force us to be here?

497
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:45,711
- They can if your parents
have you by the balls.

498
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,514
- Katie MacFarland,
you were caught having

499
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,684
sex in your parents bed,
the problem is your dad

500
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,520
he's a federal pro-life judge

501
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:59,075
and you aborted the result
of your sex romp rebellion?

502
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,545
And then posted it on Facebook?

503
00:28:02,564 --> 00:28:04,264
Nice going.

504
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,082
- You may not be a tranny
but you got some balls.

505
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,568
- Fuck you.

506
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,823
- Christian Novak, possible
homicide involvement?

507
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:13,773
Christian.

508
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:17,777
Mom and dad high
profile realtors,

509
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:20,613
so I guess you added
to their housing slum.

510
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,934
Sarah Varaway, Sarah?

511
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,189
Sarah you brought your
girlfriend to your parents

512
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:32,658
Christmas turned
coming out party

513
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:34,194
after you both got a
drunk and made a little

514
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:36,712
merry under the Christmas tree.

515
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,614
In front of their very
important and I assume

516
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,151
very conservative friends?

517
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:44,070
And Matt Johnson.

518
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:48,875
Even when you're
bad, you're good.

519
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,209
- Thank you.

520
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:52,962
- Perfect score in
military test, ASVAB?

521
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,399
Refused to go into
the Marines even when

522
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,701
General Daddy
pulled some strings

523
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:01,121
to get you in as an officer.

524
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:03,607
And um,

525
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,912
your brother was killed
in Afghanistan 2002.

526
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:11,197
I'm sorry.

527
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,518
So we know Jerry is gone,
he did some bad shit,

528
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,287
he lost a lot of money.

529
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,723
Vincent Santone.

530
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,940
- Present.

531
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:22,676
- Videotaped your
step mother cheating

532
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:26,212
on your Wall Street father
and posted her banging

533
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:27,764
some guy on a website, I
take it you're very good

534
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,032
with a camera?

535
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,701
- Yeah, check out
revengeex-wives.com

536
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:32,952
and you tell me.

537
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:35,555
- You know, isn't this,
this is private information.

538
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,906
- You didn't read
the fine print?

539
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,709
Anything goes on the show.

540
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:43,063
Calvin Thompson,
Calvin lost your leg,

541
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:46,833
lost your girlfriend and a
shot at playing pro ball.

542
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,719
- Fuckin' A! What the fuck?

543
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,772
- Ming Lloraltevan.

544
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:54,557
Sex with two underage girls.

545
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,059
- Now hold on, I was
19 and they were 17.

546
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,678
I ain't no pedophile.

547
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:01,698
How you know this shit anyways?

548
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,469
- Melissa Childs.

549
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,554
- What the fuck, man?

550
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:13,843
- I don't, I don't have
anything on you, Melissa.

551
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:18,064
- Hey, pictures worth
a thousand words.

552
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,767
- And Andrienne Forez.

553
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:22,218
- Stop.

554
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:26,172
- Nervous breakdown last year,

555
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:29,943
I'm sorry, committed to
Byberry Mental Facility

556
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:30,709
after attacking,

557
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,012
- Shut up!

558
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,704
- Here you go Mr. Hill.

559
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,171
- Aha, did Betty make it?

560
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,506
- Just the way you like it.

561
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:44,441
- Nice.

562
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,775
You know Myrna, I don't know how

563
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,210
you've done it all these years,
runnin' the general store,

564
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,578
waitin' tables over at Penny's.

565
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,547
- Yeah that's why
I look like shit.

566
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,215
- It's good to see you again.

567
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,450
- You too.

568
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:54,384
- Sorry it took me
20 years to get back

569
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,118
but you have not aged a bit.

570
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,554
- Kinda like this town, huh?

571
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,724
You know, somewhere out
there's a motel room

572
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,826
with a painting of
this town as it ages

573
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,894
and I don't wanna see it.

574
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,864
- Take good care of yourself.

575
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,899
- Yeah, you too.

576
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,967
(Foreboding music)

577
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:32,923
- [Voiceover] Yeah?

578
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,190
- Hey.

579
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,258
- [Voiceover] Hey,
you okay up there?

580
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,260
- Yeah, guess who's comin' home?

581
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,729
- [Voiceover] Julian changed?

582
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,932
- Yeah, same old asshole.

583
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,534
No, he hasn't changed a bit.

584
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,569
That's alright.

585
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,204
- [Voiceover] Are you
flying first class?

586
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,474
- No, I'm not flying first
class, but I'll see you soon.

587
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,676
Love you.

588
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,577
- [Voiceover] Love you too.

589
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:55,612
- Bye.

590
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,707
(Choking)

591
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:38,287
(scary music)

592
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:12,372
- The premise of
the show is simple,

593
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,874
I mean you need to
be the only survivor.

594
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,477
- [Matty] And what,
exactly, does that mean?

595
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:20,213
- [Rachel] It means that
you guys are the victims

596
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,249
and somewhere out
there is a killer.

597
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:25,885
It's just like the
Summer Camp movies.

598
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,487
- [Sarah] But you
were the killer.

599
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,705
- [Vinny] Wait, wait, there's
a killer running around?

600
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,941
- [Rachel] Exactly,
you have to stay alive

601
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,709
and when someone is
killed they're gonna place

602
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,012
a black cloth on the cabin door

603
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:38,748
and that's just drama
for the TV audience,

604
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,016
- [Melissa] I love it.

605
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,717
- [Matty] How do we get killed?

606
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,219
- [Rachel] Well, you
could get simply touched

607
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,688
on the shoulder or stabbed
with a foam machete,

608
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,957
or shot with a paintball,
all kinds of ways,

609
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,760
but believe me, you'll
know it when they get you.

610
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,912
So, while avoiding
elimination you guys

611
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,581
have to get the camp
ready for it's reopening.

612
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,416
(All groaning)

613
00:33:57,451 --> 00:34:00,920
Hey, come one guys, this
is for a million dollars.

614
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,355
You guys will do your
tasks and your chores

615
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:06,025
and the challenges and
you are safe when you do

616
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,727
the challenges, that's when
you gain your immunity.

617
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:10,029
- [Vinny] When do
we get to sleep?

618
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:12,481
- [Novak] You'll sleep
when you're dead, bitch.

619
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:17,887
- Oh shit, oh man,
this is like that show,

620
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:20,557
you know that girl
wants her watermelon

621
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,891
and then it like came
back and smashed her

622
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,660
in the face, it was
fuckin' awesome,

623
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:24,727
you guys see that?

624
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:25,695
- Never seen it.

625
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,997
- Oh, okay, I'm gonna show you.

626
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,833
Have you seen it?

627
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,569
Oh fuck, shit, ass.

628
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,170
I don't get any service.

629
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,706
I mean it was like the fuckin'
Kenny assassimation, man.

630
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,740
- Assassimation?

631
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:38,608
- Yeah,

632
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,876
- You said assassimation.

633
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,310
- I know what I said,
shit, it was like,

634
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,012
you know?

635
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:44,480
- Oh, yeah.

636
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,849
- Look, you know what?

637
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,718
We're gonna do a lot of
things just like that,

638
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,687
- I'm just excited, that's all.

639
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:53,690
- Okay, that's good I'm
glad you're excited.

640
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,692
But hopefully no one
loses their head.

641
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,027
We have lots of
challenges, guys, okay?

642
00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:59,729
You pumped?

643
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,834
- All campers are required
to meet with Rachel Steel

644
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,521
for regular counseling sessions.

645
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:09,706
- They're watching us now.

646
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,641
- I feel like
something's missing.

647
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,676
- You know,

648
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,528
I didn't put any of my
private shit down anywhere.

649
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:19,599
- Then our folks did when
they threw us under the bus.

650
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:22,468
- I'm gonna win this thing.

651
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:23,952
- It's not about winning, Novak.

652
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,021
- Winning is everything,
motherfucker.

653
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:27,156
- Whoa.

654
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,941
Easy there, hoss.

655
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,643
- One million dollars is
a good start to fixing

656
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:32,712
a lot of fucked up shit
that happened in our life.

657
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:35,748
And that halfer fag
almost wrecked it for us

658
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:37,733
before we even got started.

659
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:41,537
- And you're the other half?

660
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,694
Asshole!

661
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,514
- There's a pattern
here with us.

662
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,816
- We still don't
know what she did.

663
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:59,221
I'm talkin' to you scream queen.

664
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:00,606
- Hey, back off.

665
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:04,394
- Okay, be the nice guy
but if you wanna win

666
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:07,930
you're eventually gonna
have to screw her, Matty.

667
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,483
- Alliances between
contestants are permitted

668
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:12,085
but will eventually
prove useless as there

669
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,053
can only be one winner.

670
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,688
- Thank you.

671
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,773
- Jerry did not wanna come here.

672
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,793
I think it's safe
to say that we all

673
00:36:20,828 --> 00:36:22,629
feel the same way, right?

674
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:28,067
I mean, we screw up,
our punishment is

675
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,869
a million bucks.

676
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:33,539
It doesn't add up.

677
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:36,392
- I had a choice,
this, jail, or rehab.

678
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,260
Now I got a shot
at being a star.

679
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:40,162
- Gay pornstar.

680
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,180
Maybe.

681
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:42,515
- I'm sick and tired
of your bullshit.

682
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,317
- Alright, man, come on, man.

683
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:45,034
Chill out.

684
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,068
- What're you gonna do?

685
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,837
Beat me with your fake leg?

686
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,505
- How'd you like a fake
hand after I break off

687
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,374
the fist you hit with?

688
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,494
- Shit, we don't need a killer,

689
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:56,261
we'll just take each other out.

690
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,681
- What about the princess
of darkness over here?

691
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,616
Look at her.

692
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,086
- You know what I'd do to you

693
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,055
if I were the killer?

694
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,542
I'd knock you out,

695
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:11,527
tie you down.

696
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,828
- Nice.

697
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,882
- Strip you naked and try
to find that steroid-abused

698
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:18,851
nub of a dick of yours and shove

699
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:21,954
a thin, glass rod
right up your pisser.

700
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:28,711
Then, I jerk you off
with just two fingers,

701
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,748
cause that's all it'll take.

702
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:37,803
Once you've managed to
get just a little hard

703
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:41,707
I'd snap it.

704
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,012
Watch you come blood.

705
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,667
- [Katie] Holy shit.

706
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,869
- That's what they did
to the douche bag jock

707
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:56,322
in Summer Camp three.

708
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,224
- You're Columbine's Prom
Queen, you know that?

709
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,927
- I killed my brother.

710
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:06,365
It was in self defense.

711
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:09,635
You look like him, Novak.

712
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:12,989
That's why you're here right?

713
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,258
To fuck with my head?

714
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,527
- I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

715
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,696
- He raped me for over a year.

716
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,669
He forced me not to say
anything, he threatened me,

717
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,406
said it was because he loved me.

718
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,477
Until I couldn't
take it anymore.

719
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,547
So one night, while
he was asleep,

720
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:42,551
I went into his room and
I stabbed him repeatedly.

721
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,074
After everything he did to me,

722
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:52,044
my parents still sent me away.

723
00:38:56,283 --> 00:38:58,985
He was their pride and joy,

724
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,655
with a full scholarship to
play football at college.

725
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,557
(Eerie music)

726
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,376
They came to see me once.

727
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,545
To tell me about this camp.

728
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,566
They said if I came here,
then I could come home.

729
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:16,735
I won't go back to Byberry.

730
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:20,072
So let's just say I have
more of an incentive

731
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,241
to win this thing, Novak.

732
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:24,143
And I will.

733
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:26,428
- Yeah, throwin' it down, yeah.

734
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:28,064
- [Novak] Shut up.

735
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,132
- I know it was you who
fucked with my digital

736
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,751
photo frame.

737
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,587
Put pictures of me
and my brother on it.

738
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,772
- I didn't go anywhere
near your cabin.

739
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,591
- I don't know how did it,
or why, or if it's all part

740
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,677
of this bullshit game.

741
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,280
- I didn't do shit.

742
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:47,783
- Watch this guy, he
plays dirty folks,

743
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,453
you can't trust him.

744
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,541
- And the fun begins.

745
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:08,554
(Thunder rumbling)

746
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,659
- Hello?

747
00:40:13,694 --> 00:40:14,744
- What are you, blind?

748
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,179
- Ah! What the hell?

749
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,835
- I knocked and called but
you were in the shower.

750
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,037
- So you decided to sit in
the dark and sneak a peak?

751
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:27,289
Is your camera on?

752
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,692
Hope you enjoyed the show!

753
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,911
Seriously?

754
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:33,846
- I'm sorry, I didn't
think I would scare you.

755
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:36,048
- Well you did.

756
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,486
- How did you end up doing this?

757
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,921
- [Katie] I was told I'd be
cut off if I didn't try out.

758
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,691
I never thought I'd get
on, but, when I heard there

759
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:47,826
was money I didn't fight it.

760
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,746
- I had a choice
between two camps,

761
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,049
this one and one of those
"re-programming" camps

762
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:58,104
where they think they
can cure homosexuals.

763
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:01,957
- So, why are you in my cabin?

764
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,009
- Safety in numbers.

765
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,211
You wanna read these
scripts together?

766
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:08,147
- I wanna go to bed.

767
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:12,551
- Then let's take
shifts sleeping.

768
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:14,353
- How do I know
you're not the killer?

769
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,072
(Ominous thunder rumbling)

770
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,741
- Hot people are
never the killers.

771
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:36,392
(Soft piano music)

772
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:51,106
(thunder rumbling)

773
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,267
(knocking)

774
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:19,318
- [Rachel] Calvin, you okay?

775
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:20,853
- [Calvin] All day.

776
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,325
- Okay, yeah good.

777
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,926
Whoa!

778
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:36,769

00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:02,721
okay?

792
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:04,490
We're gonna do the American
Gladiator challenge.

793
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:07,609
We have two people,
two sticks right here,

794
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,561
and I'm gonna put
you out on the dock,

795
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:10,595
I put a little
yellow tape there,

796
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:12,531
so if you fall over
the yellow tape

797
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,484
or in the water, you're
immediately disqualified.

798
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,653
- I'll take Captain
Hook over here.

799
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,688
- I'll take Novak.

800
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,957
- Oh, good Adrienne, good girl.

801
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,277
- Well I was hoping to get a
shot at the abortion queen,

802
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,597
but the scream queen will do.

803
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,631
- Novak.

804
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:47,633
(Intense orchestral music)

805
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:56,491
(whistling)

806
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:05,100
(cheering and clapping)

807
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,858
- [Matty] Come on, Adrienne!

808
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:18,763
- [Vinny] Alright,
get it, get it.

809
00:45:21,768 --> 00:45:23,619
- [Ming] Too weak, Novak.

810
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:35,247
(All cheering)

811
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:36,281
(whistling)

812
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:47,392
(screaming)

813
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:50,846
- Novak!

814
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,514
- [Adrienne] No!

815
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,841
- Ah, fuck!

816
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:04,476
Fuck!

817
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:05,795
- [Matty] Hey, that's enough!

818
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,566
- Just grow a dick and balls.

819
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:13,368
- Relax, man, relax,
that's enough.

820
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:18,657
- I don't play well with others.

821
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,443
- Novak, you were
gonna kill her.

822
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,878
- Well that's what I
wanted you to think.

823
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,214
- Why?

824
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:29,585
- Because that's what's
expected of me, right?

825
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,786
- I'm the guy out
of his fucking mind.

826
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,457
And don't let Adrienne fool
you, she's just as much

827
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,309
of an act, I'm on to her.

828
00:46:37,345 --> 00:46:38,594
- What're you talking about?

829
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,451
- Cameras are on me, right?

830
00:46:47,904 --> 00:46:51,490
- Yeah, I mean,
sure, I don't know.

831
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:53,342
- None of this is real.

832
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,645
Movie star turned therapist,
give me a fuckin' break, lady.

833
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,231
Go talk to Adrienne.

834
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,884
- I plan to.

835
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,618
- When I walk of this
thing, I'm gonna be

836
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,822
one million dollars
richer and a star.

837
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,525
She flushed herself
out at the campfire.

838
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,510
- Flushed?

839
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:13,379
Wait, okay.

840
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:16,181
Can we start over here?

841
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,916
- I was told there
was gonna be another,

842
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:20,735
all I had to be was patient.

843
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,538
- Another what?

844
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,407
- Okay, this game has rules.

845
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:30,329
Part of my therapy is
following those rules,

846
00:47:30,364 --> 00:47:31,797
I get it.

847
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:36,402
But if it were up to me,

848
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:39,939
I would kill everyone
at this camp.

849
00:47:39,974 --> 00:47:41,974
And collect the
one million bucks.

850
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,733
- So, who's doing the killing?

851
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:54,019
Who's actually out there
doing these eliminations?

852
00:47:54,054 --> 00:47:55,554
- I have a team.

853
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:57,989
They stay in town and
they come out here

854
00:47:58,025 --> 00:48:01,243
as scheduled to prowl
around and do their thing.

855
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:02,610
- Did you give Novak or Adrienne

856
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:05,581
any inside information
just to make good TV?

857
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,683
- They're all pitted
against each other,

858
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,685
they just don't realize it yet.

859
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,353
I have no idea who's
gonna win this thing.

860
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,538
- Who put up the
million dollars?

861
00:48:13,573 --> 00:48:16,208
- I'm not at liberty to say.

862
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,426
- Is there a million dollars?

863
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,145
- Your check cashed, right?

864
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,214
I know you cashed
it quick enough.

865
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:26,468
- So who put it up, what
network, what studio?

866
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:31,056
- Angel investors, last word.

867
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,313
(Knocking)

868
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,749
- Adrienne!

869
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:45,603
- So, motorcycle accident?

870
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:50,275
- It's no accident.

871
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:51,943
Stupidity.

872
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:55,681
I wish I died instead of her.

873
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:58,334
Her parents do too.

874
00:48:58,385 --> 00:49:01,052
- What was her name?

875
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,225
- Monica.

876
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,964
- So, if you win you'll
give her family the money?

877
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:17,502
- I mean, I'm not gonna
try and say like it'll make

878
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,872
things right, but no, it's
the right thing to do.

879
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:22,507
(Cellphone buzzing)

880
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,876
You alright?

881
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:25,477
- I have two bars!

882
00:49:25,512 --> 00:49:26,245
- On your phone?

883
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,913
- Yeah!

884
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:30,682
My account's terminated?

885
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,017
- Hold on.

886
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,886
- My father, asshole.

887
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:36,621
- Hang on, I didn't
cancel my service.

888
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:39,224
- That's weird.

889
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,859
- Yeah, it's fuckin',

890
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,627
Well you know I just,

891
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:45,597
- I gotta get back.

892
00:50:00,113 --> 00:50:00,979
(Rustling)

893
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:02,780
- Oh shit, hey!

894
00:50:02,816 --> 00:50:05,567
(Screaming)

895
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,021
Fuck!

896
00:50:10,056 --> 00:50:11,690
Shit!

897
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:13,858
What're you doin'?

898
00:50:13,893 --> 00:50:15,627
Get the fuck off!

899
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,265
Fuck you!

900
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:30,275
(Suspenseful music)

901
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,710
- Jesus Christ!

902
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,529
- Close enough.

903
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,580
- Were you following
me or heading

904
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,683
to Adrienne's cabin?

905
00:50:56,704 --> 00:50:59,605
- I ran around the lake.

906
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,428
- How do I know
you're not the killer?

907
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,214
- If I was, I'd
fuck you to death.

908
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:23,328
The cameras.

909
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:25,513
- I like to be watched.

910
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:56,711
(Moaning)

911
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:16,314
(breathing loudly)

912
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,370
What's wrong?

913
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:23,672
- Faster.

914
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,726
Faster.

915
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:30,712
If I go any faster I'll
start a fire or strip it raw.

916
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,516
- Tell me not to fuck you.

917
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:35,651
- What?

918
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:39,754
- What? I thought you
liked to play this way.

919
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:45,643
You've been wanting me to
hurt you this whole time.

920
00:52:45,678 --> 00:52:47,628
Tell me not to fuck you.

921
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,597
- Don't fuck me.

922
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,516
- Tell me not to fuck you.

923
00:52:51,552 --> 00:52:52,750
- Get off me.

924
00:52:52,786 --> 00:52:54,536
- Tell me not to come in you.

925
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,705
- Get off me.

926
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,939
- Tell me not to come in you.

927
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,359
- I'm serious, get
the fuck off me.

928
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:03,629
Stop!

929
00:53:06,467 --> 00:53:09,701
Stop!

930
00:53:13,873 --> 00:53:16,491
That's fucking gross.

931
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,877
- Can't get pregnant
with it there.

932
00:53:23,049 --> 00:53:24,916
(Laughing)

933
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:28,620
- Not the first time
it's been there.

934
00:53:31,024 --> 00:53:32,607
(Knocking)

935
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:37,095
Just a minute.

936
00:53:37,364 --> 00:53:38,897
- Say a word about
this to anybody

937
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:41,265
and you're goin'
home in a body bag.

938
00:53:44,438 --> 00:53:45,420
(Knocking)

939
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,064
- Hey.

940
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:59,667
I knocked this time.

941
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:04,873
Is everything okay?

942
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,709
- I just went for a
run, I'm all grungy.

943
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,579
- Smells like sex in here.

944
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,702
- I think it's safe
to say that Calvin's

945
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,236
not coming back.

946
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,709
Where have you been, Adrienne?

947
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:47,215
- Rachel did the killings
in part two and three.

948
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:50,151
- You're barking
up the wrong tree.

949
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:19,698
- I was wondering
when you were getting

950
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,099
around to that.

951
00:55:21,134 --> 00:55:23,702
- You scared the hell out of me.

952
00:55:24,437 --> 00:55:26,204
- Ironic, ain't it?

953
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,172
Need some help?

954
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:30,775
- All I have to do is hang this.

955
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,280
See? No ghosts.

956
00:55:39,452 --> 00:55:41,452
Looks like Calvin's next.

957
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,465
- Wouldn't it make
sense to take your stuff

958
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,783
if you've been eliminated?

959
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:02,390
Something's not
right here, Rachel.

960
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:04,426
- [Rachel] Listen,
I have an idea.

961
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,520
Holy shit.

962
00:56:49,356 --> 00:56:50,872
Holy shit.

963
00:56:55,144 --> 00:56:57,128
What the fuck?

964
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,427
(Car rumbling)

965
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,281
Oh my God.

966
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,577
Shut down.

967
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,796
(Stomping)

968
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,251
Oh my God, oh my God.

969
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,286
Come on.

970
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,456
(Knocking)

971
00:58:32,526 --> 00:58:34,259
- Who is it?

972
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:37,695
Who's there?

973
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:39,581
(Rattling)

974
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:02,887
(dramatic music)

975
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:04,055
- Hey!

976
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:05,690
- I called twice to see
who was at the door,

977
00:59:05,725 --> 00:59:06,757
you didn't hear me?

978
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,660
- Rachel, how many times
have you skulked outside

979
00:59:09,696 --> 00:59:12,230
someone's cabin in
our movies, huh?

980
00:59:12,565 --> 00:59:14,599
One of the camera's
showed you near the office

981
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:17,435
so I guess I thought you
might wanna talk to me.

982
00:59:17,904 --> 00:59:21,706
- I was taking a walk.

983
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,992
- Everything goin' okay?

984
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:28,363
- So, you mean to tell
me you came by tonight

985
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,730
just to ask me that?

986
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,799
- Well actually, I was over
at the Thompson boy's cabin,

987
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,702
he left a bunch of stuff
and I want to get it shipped

988
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,538
off to him.

989
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:38,940
- Oh, when did he leave?

990
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,492
- I had a car come for
him, I don't remember.

991
00:59:41,528 --> 00:59:43,394
He's in town now.

992
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,346
- Did he have any parting words?

993
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:48,649
- Well, he was surprised
who the killer was.

994
00:59:48,684 --> 00:59:50,735
- Have you heard from John?

995
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,103
- Not a word.

996
00:59:52,138 --> 00:59:54,089
On that note.

997
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:58,626
I forgot to ask you
something earlier.

998
00:59:58,662 --> 00:59:59,944
- What's that?

999
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:02,346
- Why did you tell
Frontier Pictures

1000
01:00:03,616 --> 01:00:05,549
that I wasn't suitable
to direct a remake

1001
01:00:05,585 --> 01:00:07,518
of Summer Camp?

1002
01:00:07,553 --> 01:00:08,519
- I don't know what
you're talkin',

1003
01:00:08,554 --> 01:00:10,521
- Something about I was too old.

1004
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:13,391
That the film needed a fresh
vision, a young director.

1005
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:15,242
And you were offered
executive producer,

1006
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,444
am I right?

1007
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,745
- Julian.

1008
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:21,215
When Frontier Pictures
approached me awhile ago

1009
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,018
to be their executive
producer, I,

1010
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:24,719
- Yeah, they were gonna
put up good money,

1011
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:26,621
weren't they Rachel?

1012
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,289
- Unfortunately, a
big chunk of it was

1013
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:30,591
to buy me out or off, right?

1014
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,662
- You declined that offer.

1015
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,597
- Maybe.

1016
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,801
I would never let anyone take
control of that property.

1017
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,771
- And that's not
how it happened.

1018
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,922
- It's okay, Rachel.

1019
01:00:44,957 --> 01:00:46,357
Because the remake
has a green light,

1020
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,927
it has a script, and
it has me as director,

1021
01:00:48,962 --> 01:00:51,396
and I'm callin'
all of the shots.

1022
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:54,732
All I need is an ending.

1023
01:00:57,937 --> 01:01:01,238
- Oh my God.

1024
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:07,728
(Dramatic music)

1025
01:01:08,348 --> 01:01:10,215
(knocking)

1026
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,187
- Who is it?

1027
01:01:16,223 --> 01:01:18,389
(Thumping)

1028
01:01:20,794 --> 01:01:22,560
Julian!

1029
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:34,605
(Scary music)

1030
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,943
- Let go of me!

1031
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,565
Let me fucking live!

1032
01:02:01,817 --> 01:02:07,672
(Groaning)

1033
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,429
(splashing)

1034
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:17,581
You better hope I don't float.

1035
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:20,685
(Laughing)

1036
01:02:52,552 --> 01:02:55,052
- Has anyone seen Missy?

1037
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:11,051
(Clattering)

1038
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:16,657
- Oh shit.

1039
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:27,235
Fuck.

1040
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:37,178
I'll wash this shit by hand.

1041
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,484
- Try this.

1042
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,621
- What is that?

1043
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,224
- It's my hoe.

1044
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:51,041
- Has this been in your ass
crack all day, my friend?

1045
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,343
- Come on man, you've got
like industrial strength

1046
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:53,510
gloves there.

1047
01:03:53,546 --> 01:03:55,896
(Laughing)

1048
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,637
- What the hell is that?

1049
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:07,558
- What?

1050
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:10,227
- Yo, keep a lookout
real quick, okay?

1051
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,565
- For what, what am I looking,

1052
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:15,533
- Shut up (shushing)

1053
01:04:15,568 --> 01:04:17,068
- What is that?

1054
01:04:17,303 --> 01:04:27,879
Alright, I'll look.

1055
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:37,721
- Get the fuck out.

1056
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,594
Fuck, yes, yes!

1057
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,814
Vinny, Vinny!

1058
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:52,770
(Cellphone buzzing)

1059
01:05:07,587 --> 01:05:11,456
- Watching you, have
sex through the other,

1060
01:05:14,894 --> 01:05:17,428
(humming)

1061
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:21,366
This is set is bullshit,
fuck this pass.

1062
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:23,368
(Banging)

1063
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:27,605
Fuck me.

1064
01:05:31,244 --> 01:05:32,977
Fuckin' shit.

1065
01:05:34,547 --> 01:05:35,546
Piece of shit.

1066
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:55,132
(Cellphone buzzing)

1067
01:06:01,974 --> 01:06:03,107
Oh shit!

1068
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:12,149
(Foreboding music)

1069
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,092
No!

1070
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:22,560
No!

1071
01:06:23,529 --> 01:06:25,662
Come on, man!

1072
01:06:25,698 --> 01:06:26,697
Fuck!

1073
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,664
What the fuck is this?

1074
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,699
This ain't real is it?

1075
01:06:56,729 --> 01:06:58,395
What the fuck?

1076
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:07,771
(Ominous music)

1077
01:07:12,712 --> 01:07:14,545
No!

1078
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,730
Fuck!

1079
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,733
(Rattling)

1080
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:25,573
Now, come on!

1081
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:29,327
(Cracking)

1082
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,546
- That thing that I
found on the roof,

1083
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,049
is a cellphone jammer.

1084
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:37,651
My brother had one.

1085
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,588
As soon as I turned it off
service came right back on.

1086
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,825
- Why are our
accounts cancelled?

1087
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:49,263
- Doesn't cancel accounts,
someone is doing that.

1088
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:50,765
- Why jam our phones?

1089
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,634
- Why did somebody
cancel our accounts?

1090
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:57,571
That Jerry kid is right,
shit ain't right here.

1091
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:03,110
- So either Adrienne, Ming
or both are eliminated.

1092
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:12,452
- Missy girl, I thought you
were way smarter than that.

1093
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,926
(Thumping)

1094
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:27,552
Is that the fuckin' freezer?

1095
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:37,311
(Crying)

1096
01:08:47,106 --> 01:08:49,540
No! No!

1097
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,544
(Screaming)

1098
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,055
- No!

1099
01:09:37,523 --> 01:09:40,524
(Screaming)

1100
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,035
- No!

1101
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:57,391
- You know what,
I like this book,

1102
01:09:57,427 --> 01:09:58,626
it gives us four different ways

1103
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,894
to do a threesome and
somebody finally mentions

1104
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,880
girl, girl, girl.

1105
01:10:03,549 --> 01:10:05,816
- 'Kay, I'm gonna
go take a shower.

1106
01:10:05,851 --> 01:10:07,318
We're done for the night anyway

1107
01:10:07,353 --> 01:10:09,720
and I am not walking ten
miles anywhere in the dark.

1108
01:10:09,756 --> 01:10:11,138
- Sounds good to me.

1109
01:10:11,174 --> 01:10:13,357
- Hey Vinny, why
don't you see if

1110
01:10:13,392 --> 01:10:15,726
you can find Rachel, alright?

1111
01:10:15,761 --> 01:10:17,344
Ask her if she has a car.

1112
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,612
- The fuck he will.

1113
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:19,496
- Hey.
- [Novak] I will not

1114
01:10:19,532 --> 01:10:20,665
be eliminated.

1115
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,800
- Novak, none of
this is right, okay?

1116
01:10:22,835 --> 01:10:25,652
Why don't you ask Sarah
why she got a text message

1117
01:10:25,687 --> 01:10:28,755
from her girlfriend
saying that her parents

1118
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,058
have no idea where she is?

1119
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:32,359
Alright?

1120
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,494
- Why don't you turn off
the cell phone jammer

1121
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,330
and we'll do the logical thing,

1122
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:37,597
we'll call home.

1123
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,666
- [Adrienne] He did
this, you sick fuck!

1124
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:40,935
- Hey, Adrienne.

1125
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,670
- He threw that at me
when I was in the shower.

1126
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:44,871
It's my brothers jersey.

1127
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,773
- Are you fucking crazy?

1128
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:48,409
I was fucking down
here you stupid bitch.

1129
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:49,660
- No you're,

1130
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,877
fucking with me!
- [Novak] That's enough of

1131
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,513
your fucking pills,
take your fucking pills.

1132
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,215
- [Adrienne] You're
a fucking asshole.

1133
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,751
- Hey, why would you do
something like that, Novak?

1134
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,625
- I would kill every
last one of you

1135
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:06,627
before I get eliminated.

1136
01:11:10,216 --> 01:11:11,949
- [Adrienne] Fuck you.

1137
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,720
- Oh man.

1138
01:11:17,289 --> 01:11:21,025
I'll tell you what, I'm
gonna try to find Rachel

1139
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,927
and Julian, try to
figure this all out.

1140
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,064
- Screw this shit, I'm
just gonna go to my cabin

1141
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:29,699
and have a little party,
if you know what I mean.

1142
01:11:29,735 --> 01:11:32,853
Probably like play like
board games, jengo.

1143
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,855
- I'm gonna stay with you, okay?

1144
01:11:38,094 --> 01:11:39,443
- You sure?

1145
01:11:39,478 --> 01:11:40,277
- Yeah.

1146
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,579
- That's cool.

1147
01:11:42,615 --> 01:11:46,750
Well if you see the cabin
rockin', don't come knockin'.

1148
01:11:48,287 --> 01:11:50,804
Or, I mean you can
knock, I'll be there.

1149
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:02,576
(Knocking)

1150
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:03,610
- Julian!

1151
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,336
Hey Julian!

1152
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:14,070
- Maybe we should try Rachel's.

1153
01:13:14,106 --> 01:13:15,439
- No.

1154
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:18,676
No, Julian is in charge
here, alright my brother

1155
01:13:18,711 --> 01:13:20,877
always said you go to the brass.

1156
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,933
(Breathing shakily)

1157
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:29,436
Holy shit!

1158
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,699
(Car engine purring)

1159
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,718
- Did you see that?

1160
01:14:03,289 --> 01:14:04,505
- Yeah.

1161
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,823
- [Adrienne] What is this place?

1162
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:28,095
- It's his command center.

1163
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:34,785
- Is that our camp?

1164
01:14:35,955 --> 01:14:36,954
- I believe so.

1165
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:51,952
- You know our cell
phone don't work.

1166
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,286
- No, no, no.

1167
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,222
This is not a cellphone,
it's a satellite phone.

1168
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:57,624
My dad used to have one.

1169
01:14:58,426 --> 01:15:00,060
- Do you think it'll work?

1170
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,845
- I don't know, let me try it.

1171
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,781
(Beeping)

1172
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:09,536
Yes.

1173
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:12,188
- [Voiceover] Barrett?

1174
01:15:12,224 --> 01:15:12,756
Julian, what,

1175
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,607
- Hey dad?

1176
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:15,943
Dad, it's Matt.

1177
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,577
(Clicking)

1178
01:15:18,613 --> 01:15:20,114
- What happened?

1179
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:21,715
- Maybe we got disconnected.

1180
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,916
Let me try again.

1181
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:25,135
(Buttons beeping)

1182
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,591
- [Voiceover] At the tone,
please record your message,

1183
01:15:31,626 --> 01:15:33,193
when you are finished
recording you may,

1184
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,329
- Shit, its the
fuckin' voicemail.

1185
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:41,501
Hey dad, it's Matthew,
I don't know if we got

1186
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:45,205
disconnected but please,
when you have a chance,

1187
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,742
give me a call
right away, alright?

1188
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:50,376
Okay, bye.

1189
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:55,348
- Can I try?

1190
01:15:55,383 --> 01:15:56,249
- Sure.

1191
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,438
I just do that?

1192
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,475
(Ringing)

1193
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:09,796
- [Voiceover] Hello?
- Mom?

1194
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:12,066
Mommy? It's Adrienne.

1195
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:15,369
- [Voiceover] My
daughter is dead.

1196
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:16,887
- What's the matter?

1197
01:16:19,358 --> 01:16:20,741
- Hey.

1198
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,743
What's the matter,
did it not connect?

1199
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:28,248
- She said, "my
daughter's dead."

1200
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,588
- Jesus Christ.

1201
01:16:43,248 --> 01:16:48,602
(Screaming)

1202
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,607
- Oh my God, is that Vinny?

1203
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:56,359
Is he dead?

1204
01:16:58,564 --> 01:16:59,846
- Shit, we gotta
get to the girls.

1205
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:01,214
Let's go.

1206
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:10,590
(Screaming)

1207
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:35,315
- [Katie] No, no, no, no, no!

1208
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,968
(Screaming)

1209
01:17:40,873 --> 01:17:42,823
Please!

1210
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:52,633
- Am I hard enough for you now?

1211
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,919
- No!

1212
01:18:40,232 --> 01:18:41,999
Oh my God!

1213
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:43,617
No!

1214
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:48,271
- You're getting cut
from the show, Adrienne.

1215
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,544
- [Matty] Adrienne!

1216
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,930
Get back!

1217
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,283
(Screaming)

1218
01:19:03,055 --> 01:19:04,588
Stay back.

1219
01:19:06,358 --> 01:19:08,358
He's going, he's
going, he's going.

1220
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:28,495
He's tough.

1221
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,365
But those fingers had to hurt.

1222
01:19:31,634 --> 01:19:33,567
- [Adrienne] He's
also fucking nuts.

1223
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:39,406
- [Matty] Yeah,
come on, come on.

1224
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,794
Come on.

1225
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:50,651
Hey, come on, we
gotta keep going.

1226
01:19:55,306 --> 01:19:56,439
Come on.

1227
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:01,495
- Why is he doing this?

1228
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:04,864
- He wants to win.

1229
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,386
- What is that?

1230
01:20:10,923 --> 01:20:19,629
(Suspenseful music)

1231
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:25,535
- Stay back.

1232
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:34,644
(Screaming)

1233
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:41,601
Shh, listen, look at me,
look at me, you're okay.

1234
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:44,504
Look at me, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

1235
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:45,739
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1236
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:46,874
Listen, I have a plan.

1237
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:48,108
Listen to my plan, okay?

1238
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:49,509
We're gonna wait
here til morning,

1239
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:50,944
there's nobody's gonna hurt you.

1240
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,679
There's two ways to get in here,

1241
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:54,547
there's that door,
listen, listen, listen,

1242
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,217
there's that door and
there's this door.

1243
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:58,852
Nobody's in here and I'm
not gonna let anybody

1244
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:01,355
get in here, you understand?

1245
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,857
Look at me, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

1246
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:05,225
Do you understand?

1247
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:06,526
Do you understand?

1248
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:07,761
You're fine, look, look,
look, look in the window,

1249
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:09,696
look in the window.

1250
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:11,147
It's almost dawn, okay?

1251
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:12,382
- There's a gun
in the lakehouse.

1252
01:21:12,418 --> 01:21:13,583
- Huh?

1253
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,585
- There's a gun
in the lakehouse.

1254
01:21:16,689 --> 01:21:20,190
- Yeah, Julian said there's
a gun in the boathouse.

1255
01:21:20,225 --> 01:21:22,292
We'll wait here til morning.

1256
01:21:22,928 --> 01:21:24,828
Alright?

1257
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:30,650
(Water running)

1258
01:22:08,289 --> 01:22:13,293
(birds chirping)

1259
01:22:33,498 --> 01:22:38,051
(hopeful music)

1260
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:45,542
Stay there, stay
there, stay there.

1261
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:51,881
(Clanging)

1262
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:52,609
Come on, come on.

1263
01:23:57,082 --> 01:23:58,548
Come on.

1264
01:23:59,184 --> 01:24:01,218
(Dramatic orchestral music)

1265
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:02,685
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1266
01:24:03,589 --> 01:24:04,654
Let's go.

1267
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:16,783
Shit!

1268
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:18,484
- What, what?

1269
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,553
- The fucking gun is gone!

1270
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:21,471
(Gun firing)

1271
01:24:21,506 --> 01:24:22,405
Get down!

1272
01:24:22,441 --> 01:24:23,906
Adrienne! Adrienne!

1273
01:24:23,941 --> 01:24:25,041
Come on we gotta go, let's move!

1274
01:24:25,076 --> 01:24:26,776
- [Novak] Hold the fuck still!

1275
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:28,694
- [Matty] Let's go!

1276
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,130
Ow, fuck!

1277
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:32,715
Oh shit!

1278
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:38,254
Adrienne.

1279
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:39,622
Adrienne, no!

1280
01:24:43,145 --> 01:24:44,644
(Gunshot firing)

1281
01:24:57,992 --> 01:24:59,092
- [Adrienne] You missed, fucker!

1282
01:24:59,128 --> 01:25:00,627
- Fuck!

1283
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,679
- Just a little closer.

1284
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:18,061
- The only way outta
here, is through me!

1285
01:25:22,767 --> 01:25:26,369
(Adrienne laughing)

1286
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,909
- Fuck you, Novak!

1287
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:40,216
Yeah! I got you
you motherfucker.

1288
01:25:40,251 --> 01:25:43,720
(Gasping)

1289
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:49,725
Whoo!

1290
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:52,061
(Clapping)

1291
01:25:55,634 --> 01:25:57,667
- That was brilliant.

1292
01:25:57,703 --> 01:25:59,235
Just brilliant.

1293
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:02,355
Why, you just gave me the
greatest ending, ever.

1294
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:05,424
Never has anyone
been killed that way.

1295
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:08,394
- So, I did okay?

1296
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,563
- Honey, you deserve
an academy award.

1297
01:26:11,265 --> 01:26:12,365
- So when I called my mom,

1298
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,484
she said I was dead.

1299
01:26:14,519 --> 01:26:15,852
Do they really believe that?

1300
01:26:15,887 --> 01:26:19,823
- Ah baby, I'm afraid
that part of it's true.

1301
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:22,709
Everybody's parents,
including yours,

1302
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,861
paid a lot of money
to have you killed.

1303
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:26,363
- So, what?

1304
01:26:26,398 --> 01:26:29,198
Do they get a refund
because I won?

1305
01:26:29,467 --> 01:26:31,984
- Oh, that would be great.

1306
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:34,087
If only it were so.

1307
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:37,807
(Gun firing)

1308
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:44,397
Fucking actors.

1309
01:26:50,756 --> 01:26:53,055
- [Voiceover] How do
you feel about death?

1310
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:56,326
- It's cool.

1311
01:26:56,361 --> 01:26:58,728
As long as I'm
not the one dying.

1312
01:26:59,765 --> 01:27:03,282
- Uh, I have a lot of
life to live to go,

1313
01:27:03,317 --> 01:27:07,053
so, I don't know how I
feel about, about death.

1314
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:12,391
- We all gotta die sometime.

1315
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:13,560
- [Voiceover] You think
you're a good child

1316
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:15,562
to your parents?

1317
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:19,432
- Yeah, I do, actually.

1318
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,635
- Am I a good child
to my parents?

1319
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:26,238
Let me think about that one.

1320
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,423
No.

1321
01:27:27,459 --> 01:27:30,226
- I did what I
had to to survive.

1322
01:27:31,563 --> 01:27:34,531
- I mean, it's more
like, you know,

1323
01:27:35,367 --> 01:27:36,933
is my parent a good parent to me

1324
01:27:36,968 --> 01:27:39,035
and that's like
the real question.

1325
01:27:40,538 --> 01:27:41,871
- I think I was
always a good kid,

1326
01:27:41,906 --> 01:27:44,874
I mean, wrong place, wrong time.

1327
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:55,067
(Somber music)

1328
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:30,837
- Don't start thinking too much.

1329
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:33,072
- Michael was never
gonna sit on this,

1330
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:34,106
there's too much to lose.

1331
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:35,758
We were never that close anyway.

1332
01:28:35,794 --> 01:28:36,909
Simple as that.

1333
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:38,427
- Cool.

1334
01:28:38,463 --> 01:28:39,863
And you?

1335
01:28:42,217 --> 01:28:43,916
- I got plans.

1336
01:28:44,536 --> 01:28:47,002
- You know, we really
oughta look at this as a

1337
01:28:47,038 --> 01:28:48,704
public service.

1338
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,908
Boy, they were bad eggs,
Donlyn, really bad eggs.

1339
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,677
- I guess that guy
my dad turned you on

1340
01:28:54,712 --> 01:28:55,745
to worked out, huh?

1341
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:57,046
- Yeah.

1342
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:59,348
- So what did their
parents finally end up

1343
01:28:59,383 --> 01:29:00,583
paying for each of them.

1344
01:29:00,618 --> 01:29:02,585
- Like I said, two mil.

1345
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:04,687
You don't count Rachel,
John, or your brother,

1346
01:29:04,722 --> 01:29:06,489
they're props.

1347
01:29:06,524 --> 01:29:09,224
Actually, your brother
was like a macguffin.

1348
01:29:09,627 --> 01:29:11,060
- I have no idea
what that means,

1349
01:29:11,095 --> 01:29:13,563
I told you, I don't
watch horror movies.

1350
01:29:13,865 --> 01:29:15,364
Makes you not wanna
have kids though.

1351
01:29:15,399 --> 01:29:17,232
Pretty expensive abortions.

1352
01:29:18,035 --> 01:29:19,885
- I might have to
steal that line.

1353
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:22,222
Retro-abortions,
somethin' like that.

1354
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:24,907
- Twenty million cash, huh?

1355
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,509
- Yeah, who knew.

1356
01:29:26,544 --> 01:29:29,012
- So, after I get my cut,
you gonna make your movie

1357
01:29:29,047 --> 01:29:30,847
for 18 million?

1358
01:29:32,517 --> 01:29:34,984
- You know, you really should've
watched more horror films.

1359
01:29:37,189 --> 01:29:38,721
Yeah.

1360
01:29:40,692 --> 01:29:42,892
Then you woulda see that comin'.

1361
01:29:45,563 --> 01:33:59,499
(Ominous music)
