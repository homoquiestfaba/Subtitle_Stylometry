00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,293
<i>Everyone remembers
where they were that day.</i>

3
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:07,163
<i>The day of The Event.</i>

4
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:09,866
All right, so we're gonna go
back to start. What should we name him?

5
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:11,835
What should we name Superdog?

6
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:13,871
- What do you think?
- Doug.

7
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,740
Doug? Sure.

8
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:20,710
Let's see.
I'll find his picture.

9
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,549
Um... all right.

10
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,686
What I want to ask you guys
today is who has pets at home?

11
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:33,591
- A Rottweiler.
- You have a Rottweiler? What?

12
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,381
It's okay. It's okay.

13
00:01:58,216 --> 00:01:59,916
Look at me.
Ronnie, look at me!

14
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,490
It's okay.

15
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,631
- Morning, babe.
- Morning.

16
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:32,842
Thanks, Mom.

17
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:35,713
<i>There
is no basis to the theories</i>

18
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,881
<i>of the so-called
Truther Movement.</i>

19
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:42,318
<i>The Joint Congressional Committee's
findings were confirmed</i>

20
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,988
<i>by independent investigations.</i>

21
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,561
<i>Reports of new remnants
cannot be verified.</i>

22
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:59,602
So Janine and I were talking, and she said
that she saw a new one on the bus yesterday.

23
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:03,607
Do we have to talk about these
things every morning, babe?

24
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:07,710
- These things?
- It's nothing to get upset about.

25
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:11,482
I'm not getting upset. It's just
that you always say stuff like that

26
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:15,388
and you're pretending
like he's not even...

27
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,461
...even there.

28
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:28,267
I'm gonna go to school.
Thanks for breakfast.

29
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:39,942
<i>That's my life.</i>

30
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:42,314
<i>It's all our lives
since it happened.</i>

31
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,617
<i>The Event took
people we cared about,</i>

32
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,387
<i>but it also left
a part of them behind.</i>

33
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,324
<i>Remnants.</i>

34
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,360
<i>We all see them.</i>

35
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,394
<i>Every day.</i>

36
00:04:58,396 --> 00:04:59,766
<i>Everywhere.</i>

37
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:09,539
<i>It's like walking through a haunted house,</i>

38
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:13,012
<i>but it's the whole world
that's haunted.</i>

39
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,555
<i>Jewel City, Illinois.</i>

40
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:29,392
<i>We were only 50 miles
from ground zero.</i>

41
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:33,497
<i>A government lab
had some kind of meltdown.</i>

42
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,601
<i>Preliminary reports tonight
indicating an explosion at Ashburn Labs.</i>

43
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,070
<i>The source of the
blast, a large particle collider,</i>

44
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,805
<i>part of an advanced
energy research program</i>

45
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,574
<i>headed by noted physicist</i>

46
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,942
<i>Dr. Martin Steiner.</i>

47
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,144
<i>The energy wave
left buildings</i>

48
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,817
<i>standing, but the people
in its path...</i>

49
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:55,151
<i>...weren't so lucky.</i>

50
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:59,690
<i>All anyone knows for sure
is that we can never go back,</i>

51
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,659
<i>back to a world
before the no-go zone.</i>

52
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:05,529
<i>...declaring the city
of Chicago a no-go zone.</i>

53
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,435
<i>To a world before
every house had a panic room.</i>

54
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:15,875
<i>To a world where the kids who
pretended you didn't exist...</i>

55
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:19,879
<i>...actually did exist.</i>

56
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:24,748
<i>To a world before all this.</i>

57
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,185
- <i>To a world before...</i>
- <i>Ghosts.</i>

58
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,654
Ghouls. Specters.
Spectral remnants.

59
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:34,190
"Rems," as the kids say.

60
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:36,726
- What else do you got?
- Spooks?

61
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:40,630
Spooks. Love it.
Yeah, spooks. Scares me.

62
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,968
He's so hot.

63
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:47,971
All right, let's get to work.
Uh, Mr. Trantolo.

64
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:51,909
Looking a little nervous under
that handsome head of hair,

65
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,877
which is odd because
I know you did the reading.

66
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,579
What are the three laws
of spectral remnants?

67
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,781
- Make me proud, James Dean.
- Loser!

68
00:06:57,783 --> 00:07:00,149
Law one, they aren't sentient.

69
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:02,185
They're not
conscious-thinking beings.

70
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:06,022
They're projections of the past.
Like holograms.

71
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:09,726
Very good. Law two.
Miss McNulty?

72
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:12,094
Um, they can't
alter their imagery.

73
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,798
Exactly. Once remnants appear,

74
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,101
they do the same thing
for the same time every time.

75
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,870
Like a film reel being replayed.

76
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,772
These are loops.

77
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,175
Might be a five-second loop,
maybe five minutes.

78
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:28,846
But they never vary
and they always repeat.

79
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:33,653
So now, for the big finish,
law three, Miss Calder.

80
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:40,757
Um, if we could have
a minute of your attention.

81
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,526
Law three.

82
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,896
Um, they can't affect
our natural world.

83
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,932
Very good, Veronica Calder.

84
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:51,200
Remnant phenomenon
may be very diverse.

85
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:55,204
They might be playing out moments of
their life, even their own death,

86
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,808
but no matter what,
they can't think,

87
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,577
they can't change,
they can't touch.

88
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:04,947
So why is it that the ghosts...
rems...

89
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,983
...aren't just the people
who died in The Event?

90
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:09,920
Well, there's a lot
we still don't understand.

91
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:14,824
Our best guess is that they are drawn
to locations of emotional significance.

92
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:17,928
There's evidence that rems
have always been around us.

93
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,863
Hiroshima. Nagasaki. Chernobyl.

94
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:23,132
In each of these events,
though, enough time goes by

95
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:25,569
and there are few remnants
to be found,

96
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,570
so the consensus is that's
what will eventually happen here

97
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:31,007
as we get further
from The Event.

98
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,175
I see the face of a skeptic.

99
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:35,912
Miss Calder, speak.

100
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:39,148
Well, it's just, I mean,
if that's true,

101
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,921
then why does it seem
like there are more of them?

102
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,028
What evidence do you
have to support this theory?

103
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:52,899
What about her?

104
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:38,108
Okay, girl, so your
birthday is in like a week.

105
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,045
So I was thinking, get a little crazy,
have a little bit of a party...

106
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:45,350
Lady Calder. A word.

107
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,853
A "C."

108
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,355
That's not really your look.

109
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:56,759
I've come to expect hoodies,
scowls, and A's.

110
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:59,931
Talk to me.
What's the deal?

111
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,366
Is this your daughter?

112
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,001
Yeah. She's my angel.

113
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,302
That's, like,
feels like two seconds ago.

114
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:09,906
She's your age now. Wait a minute.
Oh, my God. Wait.

115
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:12,642
You were sucking up to me to try
to distract me, weren't you?

116
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:15,378
- I was not.
- That's my move. You stole that move from me.

117
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,916
Get your own move.
But Ronnie, until then, focus.

118
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:23,686
I know what kind of potential you have.
I just need you to work with me.

119
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:27,824
- Okay.
- Here goes.

120
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:31,027
- Early birthday present.
- Thank you.

121
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,930
Oh, and Ronnie,
one more thing.

122
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:37,367
- If you need to talk to anybody...
- Your door is always open?

123
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:40,070
No, actually, I was gonna
say try another teacher first,

124
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:44,373
but, uh, yeah, sure,
let's go with that.

125
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,276
See you tomorrow,
Mr. Bittner.

126
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,712
So I didn't tell her
she looked fat,

127
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,814
but she most definitely
looked fat.

128
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,214
I mean, some people just
don't understand that you can't

129
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:55,053
wear a crop top
with low-rise jeans.

130
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,055
What's up with you
and Ghost Boy?

131
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,223
- Ghost Boy?
- Kirk Lane?

132
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,758
He's like obsessed with rems.

133
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,361
He got expelled
from his old school

134
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,396
and ended up in a mental
hospital or something.

135
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:09,999
Whatever he did,
I heard it was bad.

136
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,337
Like, really bad.

137
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,144
Why are the cute ones
always sociopaths?

138
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,163
<i>You have
to let go, Ronnie.</i>

139
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,129
Try to let go, baby.

140
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:41,797
You can do it.

141
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,767
You got it.

142
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,201
You got it!
You're doing it!

143
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:49,908
Oh, that's it. That's it!

144
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,781
<i>Okay, now come back.</i>

145
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:01,917
I got you.

146
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,820
You never need to be scared,
baby.

147
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,424
Right here. Come on!

148
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:16,299
Come here. I got you.

149
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:20,004
Oh, I got you!

150
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:35,053
<i>When you need me,
I'll always be here, Ronnie.</i>

151
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:37,954
<i>Always.</i>

152
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:41,860
<i>Ready? Go, baby!</i>

153
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,505
Ron?

154
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,289
Okay, people. Listen up.

155
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,661
You'll write a research paper
based on a topic...

156
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:03,499
...split you
into pairs for this project.

157
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:07,105
- Now, it's essential...
- Mr. Bittner?

158
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,953
Ronnie, your ear.

159
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:36,967
- Ooh! Ah, sorry. Hi.
- Easy, Miss Calder.

160
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,236
- Hey. How's that ear doing?
- Fine. It's nothing.

161
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:44,174
Good. You know you're really doing
something right as a teacher

162
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,546
when the students' ears
start to bleed spontaneously.

163
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,379
Hey, uh, Mr. Bittner!

164
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:52,281
I was wondering
if I could I ask you something.

165
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,584
- It's important.
- It's last period on Friday.

166
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:58,957
- Nothing's important right now.
- It's about remnants.

167
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:03,328
Is this related
to your school project?

168
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:11,033
Okay. You know where I live, right?
James Road, by the Richards' old place?

169
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:14,137
- Yeah.
- I have office hours at home today.

170
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,006
<i>I have some time
after my last session.</i>

171
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:21,111
<i>At 5:30. Don't be late.</i>

172
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,113
Remember we talked
about your attention issues.

173
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,050
Keep working on that last paragraph, bud.
It's gonna be great.

174
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,219
I just... know it.

175
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,388
Come on in, Ronnie.
I appreciate your punctuality.

176
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,225
The place is a madhouse. Eva!

177
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:41,064
- No. It's really beautiful.
- Thank you.

178
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,367
It's kind of a mess
right now. Come on up.

179
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:47,105
Let me get this
out of the way. Eva!

180
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,205
Eva!

181
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,443
Eva. Homework.
Finish it, now.

182
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,548
I'll be down to check it when I'm
done here. This is not a drill.

183
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,083
No hug, no hello.

184
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,719
Tell me something.
You turn into a teenager

185
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:07,423
and you just stop hugging your dad?
Is that a rule or something?

186
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,761
I wouldn't know.

187
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:15,465
- I'm sorry, Ronnie.
- It's all right.

188
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,200
Well, uh, other than
making you feel horrible...

189
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:21,103
...how can I help you?

190
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:25,674
Hypothetically, could a ghost or
a rem communicate with someone?

191
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:28,378
What would this ghost
have said?

192
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,413
- He didn't say anything.
- You said he talked.

193
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:35,584
- I said he communicated.
- What, did he send you a Snapchat?

194
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:40,222
Aren't you mildly impressed I know what Snapchat is?

195
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:42,624
It's very impressive,
Mr. Bittner. Anyways...

196
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:45,562
- I was in the shower.
- He was in the bathroom?

197
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,099
Yeah. He was at the sink,
and then I slipped.

198
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,534
- I fell, hit my head.
- You hit your head, Ronnie.

199
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,536
Yeah, but I didn't
hit it that hard.

200
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:56,238
Hard enough to have your ear
bleed all over my class.

201
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,873
Have you ever had
a concussion?

202
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,642
- Ronnie...
- I know what I saw.

203
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:02,812
Remnants can't
communicate with you, Ronnie.

204
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:07,417
They're just... residue.

205
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,620
Reminders of things we want to remember,
things we wish we could forget,

206
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,456
but that's all they are,
for better or for worse.

207
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,258
- But the laws, they...
- I know what you thought you saw, Ronnie,

208
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,199
but it just isn't possible.

209
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,346
- Why are you following me?
- Holy shit!

210
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:53,850
Hi. Um...

211
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,753
I...

212
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:02,324
Look, I saw this new remnant
in my bathroom yesterday, and...

213
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:04,930
...I've never seen it.
It was new.

214
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,401
Come with me.

215
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,068
No. I'm not going in there.

216
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,740
Hey, you followed me.

217
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,363
Kirk?

218
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:44,935
- Get ready.
- For what?

219
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,981
Okay, go. Count! Count them.
Count them. Count these.

220
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:07,425
There are so many.
I'm losing track.

221
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:22,106
Holy shit.

222
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,441
There were 16 last month.

223
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:28,411
Hey!

224
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,480
So, wait. Hold on.
You're like a Truther?

225
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:34,650
I just have more questions
than some people seem to.

226
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:37,687
Like you.
I've seen you in class.

227
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,422
You're awake.

228
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:42,057
Okay, so then help me.

229
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,364
Help me figure out
who this rem is.

230
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:53,371
No, thanks. I'm good.

231
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:56,671
The paper. For Bittner.

232
00:22:56,673 --> 00:23:00,008
You need a partner.
Come on.

233
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:06,449
Do this for me, and I'll write the
papers for the both of us. Please.

234
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:11,789
This rem, why do you care?
What makes him so special?

235
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:17,695
I think he might
want to hurt me.

236
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,100
- Thanks.
- Okay, what we need to do

237
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,471
is figure out who this rem is,
or was.

238
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:34,776
Sorry.

239
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:39,949
Okay, I say we take Brian's
photo and then we Google...

240
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,051
Whoa. What did you say?

241
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,423
You called the rem Brian.
Why?

242
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,025
I... I don't know.

243
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,596
It just popped into my head,
I guess.

244
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,001
Look, it's not that simple. You can't
just take a photograph of a rem.

245
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:03,005
You gotta have a spectrographic lens.
Those things cost millions of dollars.

246
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,141
Okay, so we improvise.

247
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:08,009
Chandler Deckert, he's been in
love with me since the 7th grade.

248
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,213
He'll help us.

249
00:24:13,183 --> 00:24:16,686
Still got it.

250
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:20,155
In theory, it would be
possible to simulate the effect

251
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:22,792
of a spectrographic field and
capture a rem on a regular camera.

252
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:27,196
- Great.
- I can show you how, but I'd need something in return.

253
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:30,833
- Like what?
- One date.

254
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:32,671
- No.
- No.

255
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:35,238
Tell people we hooked up.

256
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,540
- Fine.
- No.

257
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,242
All right. You're gonna
need a couple things:

258
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:43,246
black lights,
air purifier, and, um...

259
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:47,751
Oh, you may need to steal some
things from the chem supply closet.

260
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:55,757
<i>A spectrograph basically
generates a charged environment</i>

261
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,697
<i>in which spectral particles, what makes
up a remnant, are capturable on film.</i>

262
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,568
Shh! My mom's asleep.

263
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:11,641
<i>Most air purifiers use
what's called a negative ion generator,</i>

264
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:15,044
<i>a series of wires in there creates
gas molecules with negative charges</i>

265
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:19,183
<i>that stick to whatever's in the
air and collect in the filter.</i>

266
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:23,719
What we're gonna do
is reverse that.

267
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:28,125
<i>Send those particles out into the
air and charge that bathroom up.</i>

268
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,296
<i>Remnants are also
technically phosphorous.</i>

269
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:36,832
They emit invisible light
in response to radiation.

270
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:40,635
So to complete the effect and make
sure your camera captures it,

271
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:42,907
<i>you hit it with a black light.</i>

272
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,946
Then just
point and shoot.

273
00:25:56,887 --> 00:26:00,288
You haven't seen Brian
since that morning, right?

274
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,324
He might not be coming.

275
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:06,730
No. He'll show.

276
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,941
Mom?

277
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,221
Kirk! Kirk!

278
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:09,091
Kirk! Kirk! There was...
There was a man.

279
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:12,327
- He disappeared or he ran...
- Hey, hey, calm down. Shh.

280
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:16,399
Just calm down, okay?

281
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,305
Okay, you stay here. Do you have
anything I can use as a weapon?

282
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,777
I thought I told you
to stay put.

283
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:30,078
Yeah, I heard you.

284
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,850
Fine, then just
stay behind me.

285
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,860
- Oh!
- No!

286
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:47,830
Who is this?

287
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,465
Um...

288
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:53,201
This is Kirk.
Kirk, meet my mom.

289
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:55,438
- Mom, meet Kirk.
- Hi.

290
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,107
Uh, we were working on a school project
together. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

291
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:00,276
Are you okay, baby?
Are you hurt?

292
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,811
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Are you?

293
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,747
Yeah. I heard
something downstairs

294
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,980
and, my God,
I was so scared.

295
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:07,449
Did you see what
the guy looked like?

296
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:11,353
Um, no. I mean,
it was dark,

297
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:12,921
but it could have been a rem.

298
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:14,789
Brian.

299
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:17,392
- I guess, but I don't...
- No, Ronnie. It's 6:30.

300
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:21,863
- I mean, Brian.
- What? Who?

301
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:24,400
- Mom, somebody was in here. Call the police.
- What?

302
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,104
Just call them, please, now!

303
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,044
- Huh.
- It's not working.

304
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:36,312
- Kirk!
- Just hold on.

305
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,981
Gimme this... this should work.

306
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,283
You really needed
my help on this project.

307
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:47,826
Point and shoot.

308
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,085
This didn't happen last time.

309
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,862
Ronnie!

310
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,469
What the hell just happened?

311
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:47,982
Brian...

312
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:50,254
He's a killer, Ronnie.

313
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,363
So I downloaded
the video we shot,

314
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,097
image-searched Brian's face
and this is what came up.

315
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:05,167
"Pastor Greer's daughter,
Mary Greer,

316
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:08,304
was abducted four years ago
next week."

317
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,038
They found her body in a lake.

318
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,474
They have a photo of her the day
before she disappeared.

319
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:16,845
The pastor's daughter.
Mary Greer.

320
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:21,819
You were worried he wants to
hurt you? Maybe you were right.

321
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:40,971
There she is.

322
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:10,932
What would you like to know about
the boy who murdered my daughter?

323
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:15,973
- Do you know his name?
- No.

324
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:22,646
Whoever he was,
I do know he stalked her first.

325
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,650
<i>He followed her on campus.</i>

326
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,427
<i>He approached her there.</i>

327
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:50,439
They apparently got into
some kind of... disagreement.

328
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,975
Stop! Stop!
Stop, Mary. Listen, Mary.

329
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:57,982
Somehow, he eventually persuaded
my daughter to come with him.

330
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:04,187
He was the last person she
was seen alive with before...

331
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:12,597
<i>Police found him
at a local motel...</i>

332
00:32:19,236 --> 00:32:22,073
...the day after
they found Mary.

333
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,122
Okay, so we know
Mary Greer, this mystery guy,

334
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,359
- he abducts her...
- Strangles her.

335
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,594
...and
then he kills her.

336
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,529
Why? Who...
How does he know her?

337
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:50,632
And, I mean,
does she even know him?

338
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:54,436
He's not from here. If he was, Jewel
City's not that big of a place.

339
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:58,039
Somebody would have known him,
so I doubt she did.

340
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:00,342
Yeah, but he knows me,
and he knew her.

341
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:03,746
So... how?
We're missing something.

342
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,715
Yeah.

343
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:09,651
Wait, why are Mary's ages
different on all of these?

344
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,689
Let me see.

345
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,793
Well, here's why.

346
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,362
The day she went missing was
the day before her birthday.

347
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:23,431
That's why the ages
on the articles are different.

348
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,200
When they found her, it was
already past her birthday.

349
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:28,504
She was already
a year older, technically.

350
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,509
"Mary Greer was
born February 29th."

351
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:39,649
- Leap Day.
- So?

352
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,788
That's my birthday.

353
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:00,203
We're closing in five minutes.

354
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,309
Come on. Let's go.

355
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:12,182
Ronnie.

356
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:31,101
I don't remember
writing any of that.

357
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,482
Mr. Lane.

358
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,684
I received a call this morning
from Pastor Greer

359
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:53,856
about a Jewel City student harassing
her about her daughter's death.

360
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,657
Would you like
to explain this to me?

361
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,596
School project.

362
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,833
You won't be smiling
if I suspend you, Mr. Lane.

363
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:12,273
So what's the real reason
you went to Pastor Greer?

364
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:25,287
Cannot believe
you dragged me here.

365
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,659
I had to.
I barely see you anymore.

366
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,592
Oh, my God.

367
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:33,162
There's my boyfriend.

368
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,664
And where's yours?

369
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,465
He's not my boyfriend.

370
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:42,570
And this, um, this isn't
exactly Kirk's scene.

371
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:45,173
Oh, it's not. Okay.

372
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:47,943
So what is Kirk's scene?
What does Kirk like to do?

373
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,912
He's normal, I guess.

374
00:35:50,914 --> 00:35:54,316
Okay, Kirk Lane is normal?

375
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:58,586
Okay. That's new. All right.

376
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:00,190
Great.

377
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:11,800
He's not a bad guy, you know.
He's just... different.

378
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:18,539
Okay. All I'm saying is that maybe people
are weirded out by him for a reason.

379
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:24,246
Well, you can't always
judge a book by its cover...

380
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,950
What's up?

381
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:32,521
I'll be right back.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

382
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,227
- Oh.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

383
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:49,637
Excuse me.

384
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,442
Sorry.

385
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:40,290
Sorry.

386
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,400
Ronnie!

387
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,398
Oh, my God! Mr. Pescatelli!

388
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:20,054
<i>Initial reports are Jewel High School principal
William Pescatelli committed suicide.</i>

389
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:22,891
- <i>The school community is devastated...</i>
- <i>I'll get it.</i>

390
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:27,095
<i>and police are investigating
the details of what happened.</i>

391
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:29,430
Why the hell aren't you
answering your phone?

392
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:31,833
It's charging. What's up?

393
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:39,907
Ronnie, I told him.

394
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:41,709
Pescatelli, I told him
about us and Greer.

395
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:44,512
He said he'd look into it,
and now he's dead.

396
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:46,014
They're saying
it's a suicide.

397
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:50,485
No, Ronnie, listen to me.
That is why he's dead.

398
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,554
I'm telling you, Ronnie,
something is going on here.

399
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:56,657
- He's dead because I told him.
- Kirk, come on, we don't know that.

400
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:59,894
And, in case you're wondering, no,
I have not found the other one

401
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:02,496
since you attempted
to kill my mother with it.

402
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:04,566
Yeah, no,
I am sorry about that.

403
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,967
You do have amazingly
large feet, by the way.

404
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:09,873
Uh, those are actually
my dad's skates.

405
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,010
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

406
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,711
It's probably better
than the alternative.

407
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:20,581
I never cried
once my dad died.

408
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,552
Not once.

409
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:28,456
What was your last memory
of him? Something good?

410
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,060
I yelled at him that morning.

411
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,729
I was having
a tantrum about I...

412
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:37,199
I don't even
know what it was about.

413
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,202
It was about nothing.
I was six.

414
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,105
And, um...

415
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,576
...I told him
I didn't love him.

416
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,945
<i>Every morning
was usually the same.</i>

417
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:52,981
- Bye.
- <i>He'd shake his head</i>

418
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,251
<i>and he'd say, "Bye for now."</i>

419
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,887
He would take the train to work,

420
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:03,858
unless he was late,
like he was that day

421
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,695
because of me.
So then he took his car.

422
00:41:07,697 --> 00:41:10,231
But if he would have
just taken the train,

423
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:14,068
<i>then he would have gone east,
and would have been fine</i>

424
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:17,938
<i>because the shock wave
didn't go that far.</i>

425
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,575
<i>But he, um...</i>

426
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:24,681
...he took the freeway.

427
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,485
It's...

428
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,255
It's all my fault.

429
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:36,624
I know that everybody
says that it's not.

430
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:40,864
You know, that it's his time,
and that it was his...

431
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,603
But it wasn't.

432
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:52,543
You know, I've never
even been to his grave.

433
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:55,712
Not once.

434
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:01,184
How messed up is that?

435
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:10,691
See this?

436
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:14,063
All this. You want
to know why I track rems?

437
00:42:15,932 --> 00:42:19,637
Because you want to know
why they show up, right?

438
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:24,708
No, I want to know
why my dad doesn't.

439
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:29,079
I mean, all these rems,
every single day, but...

440
00:42:30,146 --> 00:42:32,012
...not him.

441
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,282
Never him.
And every single day,

442
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:37,586
I think I'm gonna walk
around the corner

443
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:41,121
and there he'll be, and it's
all gonna make sense, but...

444
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:42,692
...never does.

445
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,228
That's what
scares me the most.

446
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,197
I mean...

447
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,670
...him dying, me living,
what if it all means nothing?

448
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,641
That's why I keep looking.

449
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:05,583
Ron?

450
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:10,818
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Ron.

451
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,088
Um, it's so late,
and with the roads icing over,

452
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,324
I thought maybe Kirk
should just stay over.

453
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:19,293
I made up the sofa bed for him.

454
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:24,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

455
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,722
It's okay, baby.

456
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,653
Ah!

457
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,193
Ronnie!
Babe, what's the matter?

458
00:45:32,195 --> 00:45:36,930
Nothing. I... I was
just having a nightmare.

459
00:45:36,932 --> 00:45:39,737
Baby, why is the window open?

460
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:44,505
What does
"darkness falls" mean?

461
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,342
- What?
- Before you woke up, I heard you saying it.

462
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:51,278
You kept repeating it.
"Darkness... falls."

463
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,815
Uh, I don't know.

464
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:57,385
Well, come on downstairs.
Your breakfast is getting cold.

465
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,890
And close that window.

466
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,771
- Morning.
- Hi.

467
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:17,271
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

468
00:46:17,273 --> 00:46:19,507
Oh, Ronnie,
I wanted to tell you.

469
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:22,409
I got a call from that office
in Overton I told you about.

470
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:25,012
And they want me to come in
for a job interview.

471
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:27,916
It's on the 28th, so I'm
probably going to stay over.

472
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,818
So you're gonna
miss my birthday.

473
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,887
I'm gonna come back
later that afternoon.

474
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:35,190
So whatever you want us to do,
we can still do, okay?

475
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,894
Okay.

476
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:44,833
- What?
- That's his chair.

477
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,969
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, you didn't...

478
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,338
- It's okay.
- I didn't know. Should I...?

479
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,840
- Just sit.
- Uh...

480
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:57,346
It's okay. Really, it's...
Sit there.

481
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,155
I'm so tired.
How was the sofa bed?

482
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:12,392
Did you get any sleep?
Because I definitely didn't.

483
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,595
Oh, it was exhausting.

484
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:17,398
I had this dream
about Brian...

485
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,166
Ronnie, Ronnie.

486
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:22,103
You said your dad died in
The Event ten years ago, right?

487
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:26,007
- Yeah.
- Look at date on the newspaper. It's only eight years old.

488
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:31,211
What?
Wait, how is that even possible?

489
00:47:31,213 --> 00:47:35,985
- Get me a pen. Get me a pen, quick.
- Yeah.

490
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:49,099
- How much time do I have?
- Almost.

491
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:01,378
Done.

492
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:05,280
Okay. Maybe... maybe
the image changed,

493
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,414
right, or maybe it was there the
whole time, maybe you didn't know,

494
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:09,117
but either way, Ronnie,

495
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,021
I'm pretty sure he's trying
to warn you.

496
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:18,392
Okay. I found another article.
This is eight years ago.

497
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:22,262
Emma Shaw goes missing on the 29th,
Leap Day. Her killer is never found.

498
00:48:22,264 --> 00:48:25,934
But the police believed it was
linked to the disappearance

499
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,635
and murder
of another area girl,

500
00:48:27,637 --> 00:48:31,171
Claire White, who was found dead
February 28th a year earlier.

501
00:48:31,173 --> 00:48:35,510
- Were there any living relatives?
- Uh, no.

502
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,679
Emma Shaw's family moved away,

503
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:41,083
but Claire White still
has a sister in Aurora.

504
00:48:47,222 --> 00:48:50,358
Claire had this boyfriend,
Brian.

505
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,659
- Last name?
- Never knew it.

506
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:56,097
Claire and I weren't
all that close before...

507
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,467
Anyway, she was obsessed.

508
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:03,503
She moved to Chicago only after
a few months to be with him.

509
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:07,208
I thought things were moving a little
too fast, but that was Claire.

510
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,947
Where did they find her body?

511
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,153
Do you want
to watch her die?

512
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:25,360
<i>I'll give you the address, but you
might wanna think twice before going.</i>

513
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:29,032
- <i>Why is that?</i>
- <i>Because it's in the no-go zone.</i>

514
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,311
<i>This is an emergency
broadcast alert announcement.</i>

515
00:49:44,313 --> 00:49:46,514
<i>You are entering
a restricted area.</i>

516
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,383
<i>Authorized US government
personnel only.</i>

517
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:54,155
<i>Turn around now and go
to the nearest checkpoint.</i>

518
00:49:57,693 --> 00:50:00,494
<i>This is an emergency broadcast
alert announcement.</i>

519
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:02,796
<i>You are entering
a restricted area.</i>

520
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:05,633
<i>Authorized US government
personnel only.</i>

521
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:09,506
<i>Turn around now and go
to the nearest checkpoint.</i>

522
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:16,711
<i>This is an emergency broadcast
alert announcement.</i>

523
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:20,048
<i>You are entering
a restricted area.</i>

524
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,335
You know, you don't
have to do this, Ronnie.

525
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,041
You coming?

526
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,463
My dream.

527
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:10,333
I kept saying...

528
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:14,637
Darkness Falls.

529
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,744
Come on, we got to move.

530
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:36,659
Hey.

531
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:53,508
Can you read?

532
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:58,512
Come on, it's not actually electrified.
They're just trying to scare people.

533
00:51:58,514 --> 00:52:01,682
I hope. Yeah, I hope.

534
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:03,753
I hope.

535
00:52:07,556 --> 00:52:08,692
See?

536
00:52:09,925 --> 00:52:12,659
I got bolt cutters
in my bag.

537
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:15,898
- Why do you have bolt cutters?
- Don't ask.

538
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:02,378
Are they all...?

539
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,813
Yeah.

540
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:49,423
Their loops don't even end.

541
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:52,994
How is this even possible?

542
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,695
The energy that makes remnants
possible is strongest here

543
00:53:55,697 --> 00:53:58,298
because we're
so close to ground zero.

544
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,501
That's why their loops
seem continuous.

545
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:04,708
They're not just repeating moments,
they're repeating days, weeks.

546
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,945
Some might even be repeating
their entire lives.

547
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:42,811
Just keep moving, okay?

548
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:27,423
Let's get out of here, man.

549
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,731
Locals.
Definitely not rems.

550
00:55:40,836 --> 00:55:42,536
- Ronnie, follow my lead.
- What?

551
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:44,807
Don't say anything.

552
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,677
Yo.

553
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:52,448
Look at this.

554
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,483
This one's new.

555
00:55:56,485 --> 00:56:00,123
Yeah, so what? There's
new ones here every day.

556
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:09,932
Come on, let's go.

557
00:56:20,742 --> 00:56:24,644
Did we have to be kissing
to make that work?

558
00:56:24,646 --> 00:56:27,884
No, probably not. Come on.

559
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:35,657
This is
the address she gave us.

560
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,827
Ronnie,
this is the collider lab.

561
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:43,665
This is ground zero.

562
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:54,811
Are you here
to see the ghosts?

563
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:06,623
There's all kinds
of ghosts here.

564
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:13,461
We heard you can
watch a girl die.

565
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,565
Money?

566
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:21,836
You can't miss her.

567
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,139
Go all the way to the back,
then down the stairs.

568
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:27,610
Have fun.

569
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:33,817
Freaks.

570
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:52,067
Shit.

571
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,907
I don't understand.
I thought this place was a lab.

572
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:04,079
We must be seeing rems from
before the lab even existed.

573
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:10,219
In the Great Chicago Fire,
people jumped from the rooftops.

574
00:58:30,706 --> 00:58:34,010
Must have been
a bathhouse at some point.

575
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,691
And a hospital
during the wars.

576
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,820
So what do we do,
just stand around in the dark?

577
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:24,594
- Yeah, we wait.
- Until what?

578
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,664
That.

579
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,740
Look, here she comes.
I like this.

580
00:59:43,045 --> 00:59:44,880
There she is.

581
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,902
She knew her attacker.

582
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,702
Let's get out of here.

583
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,936
Ronnie.

584
01:01:16,938 --> 01:01:19,775
Dr. Steiner.

585
01:01:20,775 --> 01:01:23,145
Martin Steiner.

586
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:29,083
Kirk!

587
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:33,222
- Steiner! Dr. Steiner!
- Hey! Wait!

588
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,762
Dr. Steiner!

589
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:44,764
- What the hell!
- I'm sorry.

590
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:47,803
- Kirk, wait!
- Sorry, I'm sorry! Wait!

591
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:55,912
- Come on!
- No, no, just wait. Just wait.

592
01:02:07,088 --> 01:02:10,992
- There he is. Ronnie! Ronnie! Come here.
- Hey! Hey!

593
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:22,105
No, no, no. Wait.
Wait. This way.

594
01:02:29,411 --> 01:02:31,878
Steiner!

595
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,179
Steiner!

596
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:35,182
Come on,
we just want to talk to you!

597
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:39,219
- About Claire White!
- You should go!

598
01:02:39,221 --> 01:02:42,456
- And Brian.
- I said go!

599
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,825
Easy! Okay! We're gonna go!
We're gonna go!

600
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,325
- Okay, come on.
- You know him!

601
01:02:46,327 --> 01:02:48,427
- You don't think I'll pull it!
- You know him!

602
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:52,800
- Get the hell out!
- You want to shoot me? Well, then shoot me!

603
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:56,336
Because if I leave here without answers,
then I'm dead anyway. All right?

604
01:02:56,338 --> 01:02:59,505
You want to make up for
destroying everyone's lives?

605
01:02:59,507 --> 01:03:06,381
Well, maybe start
by helping save mine. Please.

606
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:16,456
This is where I live now.

607
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:21,394
It's... after the explosion,
I... I came back.

608
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:25,398
I felt somehow that this is the
only place that I belonged.

609
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,071
I just... Come here.
This way.

610
01:03:57,432 --> 01:03:59,302
Sit.

611
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,936
Uh, when, uh,

612
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:06,608
when the bombs, uh...

613
01:04:10,512 --> 01:04:12,912
...over Hiroshima
and Nagasaki,

614
01:04:12,914 --> 01:04:15,282
people standing near
the explosion

615
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:19,653
absorbed the radiation as they
were incinerated. Uh, yes.

616
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:24,157
Their shadows were seared into
the walls for all time. Yes.

617
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,362
Yeah, you see, death
works like that, you see.

618
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,932
When we die, we leave
an echo of ourselves behind.

619
01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:37,403
Yes. These echoes, they
can become something more.

620
01:04:37,405 --> 01:04:39,572
They can become doorways.

621
01:04:39,574 --> 01:04:43,443
See, a doorway through
which a person can reach back

622
01:04:43,445 --> 01:04:45,615
and touch the living.

623
01:04:47,682 --> 01:04:51,217
My... my research was
to understand these doorways

624
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:54,521
and... and
ultimately to create one.

625
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:56,990
You mean create a doorway
between life and death?

626
01:04:56,992 --> 01:05:00,526
Oh, yes, and vice-versa.
Vice-versa.

627
01:05:00,528 --> 01:05:05,264
<i>We brought patients to the
brink of death and back.</i>

628
01:05:05,266 --> 01:05:08,200
<i>In essence, to see if we could
use a living person</i>

629
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:11,470
<i>as a vessel
to resurrect the deceased.</i>

630
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:17,276
<i>Unfortunately,
the closer we got,</i>

631
01:05:17,278 --> 01:05:20,146
<i>the, uh,
the more dangerous it became.</i>

632
01:05:20,148 --> 01:05:23,550
What happened that day?
The day of The Event?

633
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:28,124
Instead of building
the doorway...

634
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:33,128
...we tore a massive hole.

635
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,170
What about Brian?

636
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:47,173
Oh. Brian was
my research assistant.

637
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:48,708
<i>He was young, but brilliant.</i>

638
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:51,311
<i>He was integral
to our work here.</i>

639
01:05:51,313 --> 01:05:53,646
<i>But something, uh,
after The Event,</i>

640
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:56,749
something changed in him.
Something... something broke.

641
01:05:56,751 --> 01:06:01,121
And... and when I found out
that his girlfriend Claire

642
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,758
ended up murdered,
I knew he did it.

643
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,260
But there have been
others since Claire.

644
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:10,731
- Spectral transference.
- What's spectral transference?

645
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:14,467
You see, Brian killed the person
that he loved the most,

646
01:06:14,469 --> 01:06:19,072
<i>and now he's just
trying to bring them back</i>

647
01:06:19,074 --> 01:06:21,407
in... in the body of another.

648
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:26,112
But Brian's dead. He's a rem,
and a ghost can't kill someone.

649
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:31,083
- I mean, the laws...
- The laws are lies, Miss Calder.

650
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:35,021
Bedtime stories for children
to shut their eyes.

651
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:42,597
He's coming for you now,
isn't he?

652
01:06:45,099 --> 01:06:49,403
Claire... Claire's birthday
is the day after tomorrow.

653
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,470
Claire's birthday,
day after...

654
01:06:51,472 --> 01:06:55,374
So you see, spectral transference
can only, uh, only work

655
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:58,644
if the vessel, um, you,

656
01:06:58,646 --> 01:07:02,382
shares a birthday
with the deceased.

657
01:07:02,384 --> 01:07:05,684
The day after tomorrow
is my birthday.

658
01:07:05,686 --> 01:07:12,059
Well, I'm afraid you don't
have much time, then.

659
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,427
You see,
what you must remember,

660
01:07:14,429 --> 01:07:20,467
in a world where the dead
walk among the living,

661
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,773
nothing is as it seems.

662
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:34,780
There's a price to pay
for knowledge, I've learned.

663
01:07:34,782 --> 01:07:36,715
Whoa. What are you doing?

664
01:07:36,717 --> 01:07:39,552
The truth can
be an awful burden.

665
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:41,854
We're not gonna say anything.
I promise.

666
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:53,266
This burden
is no longer mine.

667
01:07:53,268 --> 01:07:54,400
- Wait!
- No, no!

668
01:08:06,681 --> 01:08:09,715
Everything he said, I mean, the
laws, we have to tell everybody.

669
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:13,286
Ronnie, look,
Brian is coming for you. Okay?

670
01:08:13,288 --> 01:08:15,889
What we need to do right now is to keep
you safe for the next 48 hours, then...

671
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:19,492
And then
we'll tell everyone.

672
01:08:19,494 --> 01:08:21,628
- Yeah.
- What do we do?

673
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,629
I don't have much time now.

674
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:26,199
We can get you out of here,
go to my aunt's in Bakersville.

675
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:28,902
- Yeah, but he could find us.
- Rems stay in the same place.

676
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,771
Rems also aren't supposed to
communicate or change or murder.

677
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:33,205
I mean, you heard
what Steiner said.

678
01:08:33,207 --> 01:08:34,473
The laws are lies.

679
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:37,410
Ronnie, stop,
I am on your side, okay?

680
01:08:37,412 --> 01:08:39,411
I'm just trying to figure
this out, the same as you.

681
01:08:39,413 --> 01:08:43,650
You think you're alone, you're not.
I'm with you. Okay?

682
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:46,154
Mr. Lane?

683
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:51,191
Can you open your locker
for us, please?

684
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,392
What's this about?

685
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:55,361
Open the locker.

686
01:08:55,363 --> 01:08:57,198
Please.

687
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:06,639
Step away
from the locker, Mr. Lane.

688
01:09:06,641 --> 01:09:09,644
This is ridiculous. I don't know what
you think you're gonna find in there.

689
01:09:12,547 --> 01:09:16,348
Whoa, no, no, no.
That's not mine.

690
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,485
You're gonna have
to come with us, Mr. Lane.

691
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,553
This is ridiculous.
That's not mine. Hey! Wait!

692
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:24,723
Easy! Okay, I'm sorry.
Ronnie, that's not my gun.

693
01:09:24,725 --> 01:09:28,329
Get the hell off me!
It's not mine. Ronnie!

694
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:52,218
Mr. Bittner! I'm in trouble and I need
help. Okay? I need you to listen to me.

695
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:56,289
- I know you're probably not gonna believe me, but...
- Ronnie, slow your roll.

696
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:58,226
I don't have anyone else
to turn to.

697
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:00,229
I believe you.

698
01:10:03,931 --> 01:10:05,201
I believe you.

699
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:11,271
Pastor Greer
told me everything.

700
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:13,339
Bill talked to her
before he died.

701
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:15,407
Do you think Brian
could have killed him?

702
01:10:15,409 --> 01:10:17,410
I'm not sure. I started
doing my own digging.

703
01:10:17,412 --> 01:10:19,713
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

704
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,348
We have to tell Kirk. I mean,
he should be out by tonight.

705
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:27,454
- You saw what just happened.
- Well, yeah, but that wasn't his gun.

706
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:30,022
I shouldn't tell you this.

707
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:33,793
But you do know why Kirk was asked
to leave his last school, right?

708
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:38,766
- No.
- They found a gun on him.

709
01:10:43,838 --> 01:10:47,007
So this was the Dr. Steiner?

710
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:50,943
- And he didn't say anything else?
- No. That was it.

711
01:10:50,945 --> 01:10:55,315
If he's right, then running's
not gonna make a difference.

712
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,750
According to Steiner,
this transference has to happen

713
01:10:57,752 --> 01:10:59,785
on the day both the vessels
were born.

714
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:01,888
If it doesn't happen then,
it won't happen at all. Right?

715
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:05,424
- Mm-hmm.
- That means the 29th is Brian's window.

716
01:11:05,426 --> 01:11:08,294
- We'll just have to keep you safe for 24 hours.
- How do we do that?

717
01:11:08,296 --> 01:11:11,498
- Do you have a panic room?
- Yeah.

718
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:16,572
How would your mother
feel about a slight renovation?

719
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:26,481
Hey.

720
01:11:28,082 --> 01:11:33,388
- Can I help?
- We're good, thanks.

721
01:11:34,956 --> 01:11:38,325
Ronnie, can I talk to you
for a second?

722
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,362
Please?

723
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:43,632
Yeah.

724
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:49,102
Why didn't you
answer my calls? Huh?

725
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,937
Come on. You know
the gun wasn't mine.

726
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,941
How do I know that?
Seriously?

727
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:58,547
Kirk, why did you get kicked
out of your last school?

728
01:12:00,515 --> 01:12:03,516
- Please, just tell me the truth.
- Ronnie. That was different.

729
01:12:03,518 --> 01:12:07,890
- Okay?
- How was that different? Because the gun was yours?

730
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:13,492
No, hey, Ronnie,
please listen.

731
01:12:13,494 --> 01:12:17,496
Please listen to me. I was
never gonna hurt anyone.

732
01:12:17,498 --> 01:12:22,602
- Then why would you have it?
- Because I was gonna hurt myself.

733
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:26,675
Please, Ronnie. It was just a mistake.
You have to believe me.

734
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:31,811
I... I don't know what
to believe anymore.

735
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:33,649
Ronnie.

736
01:12:45,092 --> 01:12:49,963
Hi. Anna Calder for Mr. Lawrence.
We talked on the phone.

737
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:53,034
- Have a seat, Ms. Calder.
- Thank you.

738
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:59,406
<i>We're gonna
turn that panic room</i>

739
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:03,445
<i>into a shelter
no remnant can get into.</i>

740
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,820
<i>The metal disrupts
spectral energy,</i>

741
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:16,625
<i>which should make it harder
for Brian to pass through.</i>

742
01:13:23,131 --> 01:13:28,434
<i>It's a sealant. Rems tend to emerge
more clearly in cooler climates.</i>

743
01:13:28,436 --> 01:13:31,006
<i>You want to keep out
the cold air.</i>

744
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:39,012
<i>Don't worry, Ronnie,
we're going to keep Brian out.</i>

745
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:42,518
It's ugly,
but it should do the trick.

746
01:13:43,885 --> 01:13:45,951
Yeah.

747
01:13:45,953 --> 01:13:48,687
We're gonna be here a while, so
I'll run out and get us some grub.

748
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:52,090
- You gonna be okay alone for a bit?
- Yeah.

749
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:55,093
- Or you could come with me.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

750
01:13:55,095 --> 01:13:58,164
I, um,
I think I feel safer here.

751
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:01,534
Ronnie, it's going
to be okay.

752
01:14:01,536 --> 01:14:03,771
You sure?

753
01:14:05,105 --> 01:14:06,873
No.

754
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,576
No, I'm actually
incredibly scared right now.

755
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:14,013
But if you stay strong for me,
that would be tremendous.

756
01:14:14,015 --> 01:14:15,951
Back in a flash.

757
01:14:38,672 --> 01:14:40,876
That's not possible.

758
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:47,813
Damn it, Ronnie!
Pick up the phone!

759
01:14:47,815 --> 01:14:49,251
Shit!

760
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:03,228
- Mr. Lawrence, hi.
- Ms., uh... Calder?

761
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:06,199
So nice to put the face
to the voice.

762
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,000
Ms. Calder, I don't know
how to tell you this,

763
01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:11,706
but, uh, I've never spoken
with you before in my life.

764
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:19,648
Come on!

765
01:17:08,288 --> 01:17:10,889
<i>Listen to me. It's Bittner.
He worked with Steiner.</i>

766
01:17:10,891 --> 01:17:15,697
<i>His daughter died in The Event.
Bittner was Steiner's partner.</i>

767
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:33,379
Eva!
We've got to go now, baby!

768
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:35,815
Go to the bunkers,
just like we practiced!

769
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,351
Eva! Eva!

770
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:41,821
Eva, Eva!

771
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,990
Dad! Dad!

772
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:47,759
- Dad! No! No!
- Eva!

773
01:17:47,761 --> 01:17:50,765
No! Dad! Dad!

774
01:18:07,414 --> 01:18:09,216
Ronnie.

775
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:25,031
Mr. Lane.
This is a surprise.

776
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:27,266
I just had a question
about the project.

777
01:19:17,851 --> 01:19:20,119
Man, is it ugly out there.

778
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:22,388
The storm's getting worse.

779
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,089
Brought food.

780
01:19:24,091 --> 01:19:26,558
So what do we do now?

781
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,393
Well, we sit.

782
01:19:28,395 --> 01:19:30,263
We eat.

783
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,830
And we wait.

784
01:19:31,832 --> 01:19:35,500
Oh, hey. You know any
good ghost stories?

785
01:19:56,190 --> 01:20:00,327
- Well... You got it?
- That's okay. Yeah, I got it.

786
01:20:01,895 --> 01:20:04,095
- Ow!
- What happened?

787
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:05,430
- Oh. Nothing, I just...
- Oh.

788
01:20:05,432 --> 01:20:07,969
- I cut my finger.
- Hang on.

789
01:20:14,274 --> 01:20:16,409
What's this made
out of anyway?

790
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:18,078
Lead.

791
01:20:20,347 --> 01:20:22,013
What kind of lead?

792
01:20:22,015 --> 01:20:25,151
Um, lead polymer. Let me
see that. Here, let me help.

793
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:27,586
<i>Okay, so we know Mary Greer.</i>

794
01:20:27,588 --> 01:20:30,889
We know this mystery guy,
he abducts her...

795
01:20:30,891 --> 01:20:34,128
- Strangles her.
- ...and then he kills her.

796
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:43,268
I never noticed that scar on your
face before. How did you get that?

797
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:45,204
This one?

798
01:20:48,309 --> 01:20:52,012
- An accident.
- What kind of accident?

799
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,152
Is something wrong?

800
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:03,656
<i>In a world where
the dead walk among the living,</i>

801
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:07,628
<i>nothing is as it seems.</i>

802
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:14,333
I have to go
to the bathroom.

803
01:21:14,335 --> 01:21:19,173
I don't think
now's a good time.

804
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:43,195
I'm doing what any
father would do, Ronnie.

805
01:21:43,197 --> 01:21:47,066
Killing you is the only way
to bring Eva back.

806
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:50,937
- This your daughter?
- Yeah, she's my angel. No hug, no hello.

807
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:53,973
It's spectral transference.
It didn't work with the others,

808
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:57,512
but your birth,
it can work with you.

809
01:22:00,047 --> 01:22:02,647
Ah! Ah...

810
01:22:08,288 --> 01:22:10,990
You're her only chance, Ron.

811
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:13,692
I trusted you.

812
01:22:13,694 --> 01:22:18,500
But I can't let
Brian stop me again this time.

813
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,634
<i>Or Pescatelli.</i>

814
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:23,171
Or Kirk.

815
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:32,510
Each day I watch her vanish.

816
01:22:32,512 --> 01:22:35,380
That's the real sick joke
in all this, right?

817
01:22:35,382 --> 01:22:39,751
Not that we lose
the people we love,

818
01:22:39,753 --> 01:22:43,254
that we keep losing them
over and over.

819
01:22:43,256 --> 01:22:47,759
A thousand times over.
I'm so sorry, Ronnie.

820
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:50,662
Eva deserves a chance.

821
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:59,174
- So do I!
- Ah!

822
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:31,800
Ah!

823
01:24:34,101 --> 01:24:36,835
A parent shouldn't
bury their child.

824
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:39,173
Your father would
have understood.

825
01:24:40,507 --> 01:24:44,543
He would have understood.
Please!

826
01:24:44,545 --> 01:24:47,181
No! No!

827
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:54,876
Thank you.

828
01:27:12,326 --> 01:27:13,558
No!

829
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:49,361
<i>You're doing it!</i>

830
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:56,367
Why are you following me?

831
01:28:11,618 --> 01:28:15,653
<i>Ronnie.</i>

832
01:28:15,655 --> 01:28:20,392
<i>Ronnie.</i>

833
01:28:20,394 --> 01:28:21,759
Dad?

834
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:23,930
You need to let go.

835
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:27,833
But... but I'm scared.

836
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:32,573
If you need me,
I'll always be right here.

837
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:35,941
It's time to let me go, Ron.

838
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:38,713
You need to let go.

839
01:28:45,519 --> 01:28:50,054
Hey, hey! I got you!
Come here. Get up! I got you!

840
01:28:50,056 --> 01:28:53,094
You'll be okay.
You'll be okay, Ronnie.

841
01:29:03,503 --> 01:29:07,106
- Help's on the way.
- I thought you were dead.

842
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,808
I just got
a little sidetracked.

843
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:13,077
Want to hear something amazing, though?
Something amazing happened.

844
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:17,715
Someone, uh,
someone found me.

845
01:29:17,717 --> 01:29:19,519
<i>A remnant.</i>

846
01:29:30,463 --> 01:29:32,464
Dad.

847
01:29:32,466 --> 01:29:34,402
Dad!

848
01:29:37,104 --> 01:29:40,037
I found him, Ron.

849
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:43,474
<i>I found him.
He was there the whole time.</i>

850
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,647
Some things are just meant to be. Maybe
not everything, but some things, Ronnie.

851
01:29:49,649 --> 01:29:51,983
Some things are. Okay?

852
01:29:51,985 --> 01:29:57,790
- Yeah. Just don't let me go.
- I won't.

853
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:00,161
I'm not letting you go.

854
01:30:03,163 --> 01:30:05,565
I'm never letting you go.

855
01:30:37,465 --> 01:30:40,168
<i>Brian never came back.</i>

856
01:30:41,234 --> 01:30:42,903
<i>You didn't either.</i>

857
01:30:46,907 --> 01:30:51,078
I guess you didn't
need to anymore.

858
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:08,996
I love you, Dad.

859
01:31:22,609 --> 01:31:25,011
And I always will.

860
01:31:30,717 --> 01:31:32,787
Bye.

861
01:31:40,927 --> 01:31:44,263
- So?
- So?

862
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:46,298
Remember what
Steiner told us?

863
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,599
What we've seen, we're probably
the only two people alive

864
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:50,936
who actually know the truth.

865
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:52,204
What do we do now?

866
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:55,741
Steiner's dead.
So is Bittner.

867
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:57,843
Nobody's going
to believe us now.

868
01:31:57,845 --> 01:32:01,679
I don't really know
what we can do.

869
01:32:01,681 --> 01:32:06,887
But... I know we
have to do something.

870
01:32:08,087 --> 01:32:10,757
Well, you need a partner?

871
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:16,227
Get in the car.

872
