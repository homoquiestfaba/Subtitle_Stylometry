1
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,234
Idiots.

2
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:57,075
Take the captain beyond the reef till
we get permission to bring him ashore.

3
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,996
For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

4
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,459
Fernand Mondego does not
abandon his friends in the face
of stupid, suicidal danger.

5
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,889
If we don't get him to a doctor,
he will die.

6
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,100
- Do you understand?
- Of course I understand.

7
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,853
- Just don't expect me to do this sober.
- Right.

8
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,189
English dragoons.

9
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,066
Hello!

10
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,321
Dantes, don't.

11
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,367
- A little careless, don't you think?
- We have to talk to someone.

12
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,037
Well, I know, but...

13
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,455
We're French sailors!

14
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,999
- We seek medical attention!
- Come on. Come on.

15
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,420
- We come in peace.
- Edmond, come on!

16
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,839
- We mean no harm!
- Edmond!

17
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,765
Come on! Climb!

18
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,318
Look out!

19
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,593
Fernand!

20
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,235
Lieutenant Graypool.

21
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,946
If your thirst for gore demands
the death of these poor fools...

22
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,198
then by all means shoot them.

23
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,243
But do so with the knowledge
they are no agents of mine.

24
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,829
Now explain yourselves
or be shot.

25
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,207
Sir, I am Edmond Dantes...

26
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,628
second mate of the merchant ship
Pharaon, on our way home to Marseilles.

27
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:18,133
This is the shipowner's representative,
Monsieur Fernand Mondego...

28
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,093
son of the Count Mondego.

29
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:24,556
Our captain has contracted brain fever,
so we put in here for help.

30
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:32,188
If his coma is genuine,
he won't feel my knife point, will he?

31
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,485
Only a scratch.

32
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,454
Edmond!

33
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,040
- Lieutenant Graypool!
- We came to you in good faith!

34
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,711
- That's for my wounded men.
- And wounded pride, no doubt.

35
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,889
It has been an eventful evening.

36
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:20,487
If I hadn't have shot those dragoons,
you might by lying in pieces
on the beach right now.

37
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,200
- I almost got us killed.
- Yes, you did.

38
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,286
Yet, we survive.

39
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,715
King's to you, Mondego.

40
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,010
Being your friend
is always an adventure.

41
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,514
Yes, it is, isn't it?

42
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,433
It's a pity adventurers can't always
be friends though, huh?

43
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,852
What?

44
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,813
Well, it won't always
be like this, will it?

45
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,150
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Drink up.

46
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,278
We're drinking
Napoleon Bonaparte's wine.

47
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,077
As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes...

48
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,455
I wonder if I might have
a word with you.

49
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:23,049
Oh, it's just something
we've done since childhood.

50
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:27,595
Um, whenever one of us has had
a victory, king of the moment.

51
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,057
- King of the moment?
- Yes.

52
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:35,061
In life, we're all
either kings or pawns.

53
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:39,274
I'm moved by your effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

54
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,819
He is my captain
and my friend, Your Majesty.

55
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,238
Loyal friends are rare indeed.

56
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,950
In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

57
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:53,538
I have written a rather
sentimental letter
to an old comrade in Marseilles.

58
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,623
It's a side of me I prefer
the British not see.

59
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,877
And since they have a habit
of opening my mail...

60
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,089
I wonder if you would
deliver it for me.

61
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,050
Oh, I-I don't...

62
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,053
It's just a letter
from one old soldier to another.

63
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,972
It's totally innocent,
I assure you.

64
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,517
But more important, it is the price
I demand for the use of my physician.

65
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,233
- Then I agree.
- Good.

66
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,737
You are to deliver the letter
to Monsieur Clarion.

67
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,823
- Can you remember that name?
- Monsieur Clarion.

68
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,873
Now, I do not wish this letter's
existence to be known to anyone else.

69
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,251
Not even your boon companion
back there. Do you understand?

70
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,712
I'm a man of my word,
Your Majesty.

71
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,508
Yes, I, uh...
I believe you are.

72
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,858
What did he want?

73
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:09,030
Oh, um, news from France.
That's all.

74
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,595
Time you were on your way. Your
captain has been dead for half an hour.

75
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,852
Are you sure?

76
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,315
you can feel death.

77
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,490
Kings and pawns, Marchand.

78
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:56,995
Emperors and fools.

79
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,472
Come about! Come about!

80
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,022
Drive faster.

81
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,790
Danglars, what's happened?

82
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,959
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir...

83
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,462
and Edmond Dantes
disobeyed my orders.

84
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,303
Will you be needing me,
Monsieur Morell?

85
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,554
Go.

86
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,311
Mercedes.

87
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:08,358
- Where is he? Where is Edmond?
- How lovely to see you too.

88
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,610
You just missed him,
I'm afraid.

89
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,279
Could be a while.
I think he's in trouble.

90
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,407
He said he'd meet us
by the rock. Come on.

91
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,492
I told Dantes
not to go ashore.

92
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,660
Is this true?

93
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,163
I accept all responsibility.

94
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,834
As well you should.
It was all his idea, monsieur.

95
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,961
It should have
been your idea.

96
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,174
Puttin' into Elba didn't save
the captain's life, monsieur.

97
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,428
- I was protectin' the merchandise.
- You were protecting yourself...

98
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,306
by hiding behind your rank
and staying aboard.

99
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,895
Edmond Dantes, I am making you
the new captain of the Pharaon.

100
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,110
You presume to demote me?

101
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,112
There is no demotion.

102
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,745
Unless, of course, you choose
to seek another berth.

103
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,383
Now I imagine there's
a certain young lady...

104
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,762
who will want
to hear this news.

105
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,226
Thank you.

106
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,529
Monsieur Morell?

107
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,533
I understand you had a ship just
returned from Elba, monsieur.

108
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,037
- Yes.
- Did anyone aboard...

109
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,872
get ashore there by any chance?

110
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,584
They did, but they're
not here at the moment.

111
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,712
Thank you, monsieur.

112
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,465
- May I say who has called upon them?
- Clarion.

113
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,301
The name is Clarion.

114
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,852
- Make love to me.
- Will you ever give up?

115
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,271
- He doesn't have to know.
- I'd know.

116
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,148
So would I.

117
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,736
- It'd be our little secret.
- I don't believe in secrets.

118
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,033
You think Edmond doesn't have secrets?
He does. Ask him.

119
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,953
- I know what you want, Fernand.
- You do?

120
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:29,791
Remember when we were little kids
and Edmond got that whistle for his
birthday, and you got a pony?

121
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:34,087
Well, you were so mad that Edmond
was happier with his whistle
than you were with your pony.

122
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,549
And I'm not going to be
your next whistle.

123
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,388
How long do you think it's gonna be
before he can afford a wife?

124
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,517
Two years.
Two years. That's all.

125
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,562
Then he gets his captain's papers,
and we can marry.

126
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:54,649
Two years. I couldn't wait
two years for anything...

127
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,985
particularly a bride like you.

128
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,113
Hey!

129
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,365
- There he is.
- Hey!

130
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:04,659
- Whoo!
- Mercedes!

131
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,877
I missed you so.

132
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,296
The missing is over now.

133
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,383
- Are you in trouble?
- No. I'm captain. Come on.

134
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,891
Monsieur Morell
gave me the Pharaon.

135
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,352
Edmond!

136
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,605
King's to me.

137
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,609
Yours is a life
truly blessed, Edmond.

138
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,240
Come on.

139
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,494
- You're still the best man.
- I know.

140
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,662
Come on!

141
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,444
Stop that.
You'll go bald.

142
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:33,748
- Do you keep secrets from me?
- Secrets? No.

143
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,750
Why?

144
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,507
Ask me anything
and I'll tell you.

145
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,056
We don't have to wait
two years any more.

146
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,394
- As soon as I can afford
the ring, we'll wed...
- I don't need a ring. I don't.

147
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:09,284
This will be my ring.
And no matter what happens...

148
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,498
Ever.

149
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,890
Care to join me?

150
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,606
So tell me, Mondego...

151
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,070
how did you ever
become friends...

152
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,323
with that righteous little ponce,
Edmond Dantes?

153
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,286
He claims to be my friend...

154
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,041
yet he has the audacity
to keep secrets from me.

155
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,502
What secrets?

156
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,314
To the new captain
of the Pharaon.

157
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:27,112
All I am I owe to you, Father.

158
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:31,741
May this happy moment
be but the dawn...

159
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:36,705
of a long and wonderful life
for you both.

160
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,336
- Which of you is Edmond Dantes?
- I am.

161
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,589
Edmond Dantes, you are under arrest by
order of the magistrate of Marseilles.

162
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,883
- Arrest?
- On what charges?

163
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,720
That information is privileged.
Take him.

164
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,139
I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!

165
00:16:56,391 --> 00:17:00,478
I'll be back tonight.
Don't worry, Father. This is a mistake.

166
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,996
Well, I must say, Dantes,
you don't have the look of a traitor.

167
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,665
Traitor?

168
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:24,502
Now, attend me well, Dantes,
for your life may depend on it.

169
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:28,590
Did you have any personal contact
with Napoleon when you were on Elba?

170
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,884
Elba, yes, I did.
Well, we did.

171
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:35,722
I was with the Count Mondego's son,
Fernand, almost the entire time.

172
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,142
- Do you know Fernand?
- He's a recent acquaintance, yes.

173
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,562
Oh, there you are.
H-He'll vouch for me.

174
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,982
No doubt, but you said,
"almost the entire time."

175
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,404
Except for when Napoleon...

176
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,157
asked me to deliver a personal letter
to a friend in Marseilles.

177
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,244
Well, Dantes, it is for accepting
that treasonous correspondence...

178
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,334
- What?
- Now, did you deliver the letter?

179
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,965
It's... It's still in my jacket. Here.

180
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,657
- Have you read this?
- No, sir, I-I can't read.

181
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,369
Well, Dantes, this is a letter
to one of Napoleon's agents.

182
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:44,207
It gives the times and the locations
of the British beach patrols on Elba.

183
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,961
Sir, I swear on my mother's
grave, I had no idea.

184
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,005
He swore its contents
were innocent.

185
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,222
No.

186
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,183
It's you that's innocent.

187
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,603
Foolish and innocent.

188
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:09,524
I believe these are the worst charges
that could be levelled against you.

189
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:14,571
Fortunately, as I've intercepted this
document, there's no harm done.

190
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,657
God knows how you're going to survive
in this world, Edmond Dantes.

191
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:20,702
But you are no traitor.

192
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,371
You may go.

193
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,334
Thank you, sir.

194
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:35,550
Wait, uh, did Napoleon tell you
who's supposed to pick up the letter?

195
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,094
Monsieur Clarion.

196
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,846
What... What name
did you say?

197
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,975
Monsieur Clarion.

198
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,604
Have you mentioned
this name to anyone else?

199
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,898
Monsieur Mondego or anyone?

200
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:55,153
No, sir. In fact, Monsieur Mondego
knows nothing of this letter.

201
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,080
This is very dangerous
information.

202
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,541
One can never be too careful
in times like this.

203
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,252
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

204
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,712
Mm-hmm.

205
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,342
I've given you rather
a stressful time.

206
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:21,221
I wonder if, by way of an apology,
I could offer you my carriage home.

207
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,057
It's just through here.

208
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,358
Thank you.

209
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,254
Monsieur Villefort?
Monsieur Villefort?

210
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,548
Monsieur Villefort!

211
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,071
Whoa. Whoa!

212
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,077
Where are you taking me?

213
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,206
This is a mistake.

214
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,666
I'm allowed to go home.

215
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,044
From now on, your home is
the prison Chateau d'If.

216
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,047
No! No!

217
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,508
Hey!

218
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,515
Shoot him now!

219
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,854
Mount up!
Get after him!

220
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:10,622
Fernand!

221
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,376
- Fernand!
- Monsieur?

222
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,753
It's all right. He's right here.
Fernand!

223
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,715
I've been arrested for treason.
I barely managed to escape.

224
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,426
When we were on Elba,
Napoleon gave me a letter.

225
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,137
I didn't tell you because
he made me promise not to.

226
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,139
He said it was just
some note to an old friend.

227
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,725
But the bastard lied to me!
He lied.

228
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,353
It was to one of his agents.

229
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,314
Uh, somehow the authorities found out.
I don't... I don't know what to do.

230
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,775
There's gendarmes on horseback
right behind me.

231
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:43,655
- All right. We just have to think.
- I hope I haven't compromised you.

232
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:47,117
- I was hoping
your father could help me.
- He's in Paris. He's very ill.

233
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,329
- How far back are the gendarmes?
- Minutes.

234
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,790
- Do you need money?
- Yes, thank you.

235
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,418
- Do you have a pistol?
- Of course not.
- Good.

236
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,132
Stop it, Fernand.
I don't have time for this.

237
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,847
I saw Napoleon
give you that letter.

238
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,976
- It was you?
- Well, it wasn't just me.

239
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,357
Well, why did you keep it
a secret from me?

240
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,694
- I thought you were my friend.
- I told you I gave Napoleon my word.

241
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:23,778
He lied to me!

242
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,865
I know, Edmond.
I read the letter.

243
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,789
You... You read...

244
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,962
Why are you doing this?

245
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:45,383
Oh, it's complicated.

246
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,346
Complicated.

247
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,516
Don't be ridiculous.

248
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,062
- Get out of my way.
- I can't let you go, Edmond.

249
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,749
Get away from the window.

250
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,506
Don't make me
take off your hand!

251
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:53,868
Why? In God's name, why?

252
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:58,123
Because you're the son of a clerk!

253
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,000
And I'm not supposed
to want to be you.

254
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,132
- In here!
- In here!

255
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,682
- Get!
- Wait.

256
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,642
Hold it. Hold it.

257
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,816
To remember better days.

258
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,194
Come on!

259
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,409
I told you it wasn't always
gonna be this way, Edmond.

260
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,965
Father!

261
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,676
- Where is he?
- The study.

262
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,804
- Wh-What's he done now?
- Now, you listen to me, Father.

263
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:02,395
And I cannot afford to have my own
father mixed up in treasonous affairs!

264
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,483
You know...

265
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:11,071
in the end,
treason is a matter of dates.

266
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,156
And I shall be the patriot...

267
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,284
and you the traitor,
when the emperor returns.

268
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:20,288
Stop it. Stop it, you old ruin.
Those days are over.

269
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:23,416
Napoleon Bonaparte is no longer
the emperor of anything.

270
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,752
And if you continue to dabble
in this lunacy...

271
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,380
you run an excellent chance
of being arrested
and ruining our entire family...

272
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:32,050
- All because of your idiotic sympathies.
- At least I have sympathies.

273
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,345
For God's sake, Father,
all Valentina is saying...

274
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:38,014
is that as a family,
our fates are intertwined.

275
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:42,018
- Surely you can see that.
- See? Ah!

276
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,979
I'm an old ruin.

277
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:49,192
I don't see as well as I did.
You will excuse me.

278
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,741
Move it.

279
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,627
Move.

280
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,637
Welcome, Monsieur Dantes.

281
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:03,391
I am Armand Dorleac,
the warden of Chateau d'If.

282
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:08,563
Monsieur, I know you must
hear this a great deal...

283
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:12,859
but I assure you I am innocent.

284
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,570
Everyone must say that,
I know, but I truly am.

285
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,365
- Innocent.
- Yes.

286
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,993
I know. I really do know.

287
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:26,915
- You mock me?
- No, my dear Dantes.

288
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:30,585
I know perfectly well
that you are innocent.

289
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,253
Why else would you be here?

290
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,840
If you were truly guilty...

291
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:40,428
there are a hundred prisons in France
where they would lock you away...

292
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:45,934
but Chateau d'If is where they
put the ones they're ashamed of.

293
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:52,399
Let's have a look at
your quarters now, shall we?

294
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,709
"God will give me justice."

295
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,798
People are always trying
to motivate themselves.

296
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:21,594
Or they keep calendars,
but soon they lose interest or they die.

297
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:22,637
There's a window.

298
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,682
And all I'm left with is a rather
unsightly wall, I'm afraid.

299
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:30,270
So I conceived of another way to help
our prisoners keep track of time.

300
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:33,314
Every year, on the anniversary
of their imprisonment...

301
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,483
we hurt them.

302
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,194
Usually just
a simple beating, really.

303
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,660
I like to do
something rather special.

304
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,669
And if you're thinking just now,
"Why me, O God? "

305
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,629
- The answer is...
- All right?

306
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,758
God has nothing to do with it.

307
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:03,178
In fact, God is never
in France this time of year.

308
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:08,516
God has everything to do with it.
He's everywhere. He sees everything.

309
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,187
All right.

310
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,274
Let's make a bargain,
shall we?

311
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:22,072
You ask God for help,
and I'll stop the moment he shows up.

312
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:41,132
Monsieur Villefort,
have you not heard?

313
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,343
- Napoleon has escaped from Elba!
- What?

314
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:46,471
Landed 100 miles from here.
He marches on Paris!

315
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,107
We are here to plead the case...

316
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,819
- Of Edmond Dantes, Magistrate.
- Not now! Dantes?

317
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,946
We have not met, monsieur.

318
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:06,282
I am Fernand Mondego,
the son of Count Mondego.

319
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:09,536
And I am here to swear
to Edmond Dantes's innocence.

320
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,589
Edmond Dantes is charged
with high treason.

321
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,134
- Yet you stand by him?
- Of course I do.

322
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:32,517
What if I was to tell you that Dantes
is also charged with murder?

323
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,062
- Murder?
- Edmond would never do such a thing.

324
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:39,024
Dantes carried a letter from
Napoleon to one of his agents...

325
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,026
and when we tried to arrest him,
he killed one of my men.

326
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:44,487
No, if you knew him, monsieur,
you would know that was not possible.

327
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,490
- Have mercy, please.
- You have proof of this treason?

328
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:52,620
- Well, that is government business.
- Please.

329
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,456
Please, just tell us where he is.

330
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:58,126
I cannot, mademoiselle.
He was handed over to the king's men.

331
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:01,046
I can understand your pain
at this betrayal.

332
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:06,217
But my advice to all of you would be
to forget Edmond Dantes...

333
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,803
particularly you,
mademoiselle.

334
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:12,057
Take solace in the comfort
of your good friend here...

335
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,145
and perhaps some good may yet
come of this unhappy affair.

336
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:20,148
Now, you will excuse me.
I have to attend some other matters.

337
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,776
- My son is no traitor!
- I will try to reason with him further.

338
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,278
- Safely leave this to Fernand.
- Never. It's impossible.

339
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,155
- He can plead the case.
- Never.

340
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,783
I will not give up
on Edmond yet.

341
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,577
I will never
forget your kindness.

342
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:36,206
And I shall never
cease to give it.

343
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:46,091
Not that I don't appreciate
the embroidery of the crimes...

344
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,468
but still, murder?

345
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,054
It's quite simple really.

346
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:53,348
When you reported Dantes'
receiving the letter to me...

347
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:55,767
I didn't quite understand
why you were betraying him.

348
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:05,777
What prompts you to be
so accommodating?

349
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,779
Sit down, Mondego.

350
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,539
No!

351
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:19,499
Come back!

352
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:21,584
Come back!

353
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:26,089
What's my crime?
What's my crime?

354
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:28,008
I'm innocent!

355
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,970
Happy anniversary, Dantes.

356
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,730
Until next year.

357
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:46,271
Has it really been
four years, Delius?

358
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:49,858
Or Danton?
What is his name again?

359
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,517
Forgive my intrusion.

360
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:53,398
But I was under
the impression that I...

361
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:57,402
I was digging
toward the outer wall.

362
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:09,622
I am Abbe Faria.

363
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,709
I have been a prisoner
in Chateau d'If for 11 years.

364
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:15,628
Five which have been spent...

365
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:19,382
digging this tunnel.

366
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:30,185
There are 72,519 stones
in my walls.

367
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:34,564
I've counted them many times.

368
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,110
But have you
named them yet?

369
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:49,204
Once I was as you are now.

370
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:52,791
But I promise, it will pass.

371
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:56,503
I promise, I promise. Now...

372
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:00,131
may I stand
on your shoulders?

373
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,227
Take me down.

374
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,979
Please, take me down now.
Take me down.

375
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:26,491
I have not seen the sky
these 11 years. Thank you.

376
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,368
Thank you, God.

377
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,122
There is no talk of God
in here, Priest.

378
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,917
What about the inscription?

379
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:40,588
It's faded, just as God
has faded from my heart.

380
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:46,177
- And what has replaced it?
- Revenge.

381
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:50,807
Hold these.

382
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,851
Follow me.

383
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:55,812
Perhaps your thoughts
of revenge...

384
00:39:55,895 --> 00:40:01,443
are serving God's purpose of
keeping you alive these seven years.

385
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:04,738
- To what end?
- Escape.

386
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,085
There we go.

387
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:50,742
You spoke of escape.

388
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:54,079
Yeah.

389
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:57,457
There are only two possibilities
of reaching the outer wall...

390
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:04,214
I simply...
I simply chose the wrong one.

391
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:08,802
Now, of course, with two of us,
we could dig in the opposite direction.

392
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:12,681
And with both of us together,
then, of course, we could
possibly do it in, um...

393
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:15,558
oh, eight years.

394
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,775
Oh, does something else
demand your time?

395
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:27,153
Some pressing appointment,
perhaps?

396
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:34,869
In return for your help,
I offer something priceless.

397
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:36,705
My freedom?

398
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:42,168
No, freedom can be taken away,
as you well know.

399
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:46,589
I offer knowledge,
everything I have learned.

400
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:50,176
I will teach you, oh,
economics, mathematics...

401
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,430
- Philosophy, science.
- To read and write?

402
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,225
Of course.

403
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,107
When do we start?

404
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:06,234
I got it. I got it.

405
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,488
Lights out. Lights.

406
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:16,286
- Let's have 'em. Come on.
- The slot opens twice a day.

407
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:22,751
Once for your toilet bucket,
which is where we hide the dirt.

408
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:25,754
Come on.

409
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:30,675
And once in the evening
for your plate.

410
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:34,888
Lights out. Out.

411
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:36,473
Come on, Priest.

412
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:40,226
Thank you.

413
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,521
Between those times we can work all day
without fear of discovery.

414
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:47,067
"So neglect becomes...

415
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,611
our ally."

416
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:51,613
Excellent.

417
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:58,370
So you were in
Napoleon's army.

418
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:01,539
We had such dreams then.

419
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:04,459
However, one night...

420
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:08,004
my regiment ran down...

421
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,215
a band of guerrillas...

422
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:13,510
who ran into a church
for sanctuary.

423
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:18,973
I was ordered
to burn down the church...

424
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:22,477
with them inside it.

425
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,312
Did you?

426
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:31,403
To my everlasting shame, I did.

427
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:33,571
I did.

428
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,657
How did you come to be here?

429
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,910
The following day
I deserted...

430
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:44,040
to devote my life to repentance
and to God.

431
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:46,751
I worked as
private secretary to...

432
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:51,673
the enormously wealthy
Count Enrique Spada.

433
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:55,510
Spada was a righteous man.

434
00:43:55,593 --> 00:44:00,432
Sadly, a couple
of years later, he died...

435
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:06,396
amidst rumours that he had
hidden his limitless fortune.

436
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:12,027
- Two weeks later, I was arrested.
- Why?

437
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,989
Napoleon wanted
Spada's treasure.

438
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:20,910
He did not believe that
I had no idea where it was.

439
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:26,124
So he had me thrown in here
to refresh my memory.

440
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:28,668
And so here I've remained...

441
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:32,297
with only God for company...

442
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,132
until he sent me you.

443
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:36,593
God is no more real
than your treasure, Priest.

444
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,845
Perhaps.

445
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:52,901
Hurry. Get it.

446
00:44:57,864 --> 00:45:00,659
Compute this.

447
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:04,454
2,500 cubic centimetres
of rock and dust a day...

448
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:08,833
for 365 days.

449
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:11,795
Equals three-and-a-half
metres a year...

450
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:14,506
twelve feet, a foot a month.

451
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:17,842
Three inches a week.

452
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:19,969
In Italian.

453
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:33,358
Do not waste the light.

454
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:39,906
You were a soldier, Priest.

455
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,910
So you know weaponry.

456
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,835
Teach me.

457
00:45:54,754 --> 00:45:56,339
Or dig alone.

458
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,068
This is ridiculous.

459
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:22,449
The stronger swordsman
does not necessarily win.

460
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:24,617
It is speed!

461
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,203
Speed of hand.

462
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:29,539
Speed of mind.

463
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:33,960
Now, sweep your hand
through the drops...

464
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:36,504
without getting wet.

465
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:41,593
Like this.

466
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:47,098
How long must I keep this up?

467
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:52,854
I am going down the tunnel.

468
00:47:08,703 --> 00:47:11,289
Parry.

469
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:12,999
Up. Like that.

470
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:20,423
Economics is the science
that deals with the production...

471
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:23,468
distribution and
consumption of commodities.

472
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:25,470
Translation.

473
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:49,411
Thank you.
Happy Christmas, Edmond.

474
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:52,414
Give or take a month or so.

475
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:02,132
- Danglars? Mondego?
- Who do you think?

476
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:13,018
Good! Too good.

477
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,270
We have Newton's third law.

478
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:20,233
There is a reaction
to every action...

479
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:22,777
in physics and in man.

480
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:28,491
Thus my quest for vengeance
is a reaction to the actions
of Danglars and Mondego.

481
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:34,039
Up, up.
I want that seat.

482
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:40,128
You once told me that Villefort
had you rearrested just after...

483
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:43,006
he had cleared you
of all the charges.

484
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:45,091
You may go.

485
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:47,469
Yes, that's true.

486
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:51,765
Then why would he go
through that charade...

487
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:57,854
unless he had reason to change his mind
about letting you go?

488
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:00,440
- Think, Edmond.
- I'm trying.

489
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:03,610
- What happened?
- He asked me...

490
00:49:03,693 --> 00:49:05,820
Did Napoleon tell you who was
supposed to pick up this letter?

491
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:08,323
- I told him...
- A Monsieur Clarion.

492
00:49:08,406 --> 00:49:12,160
- And nothing more?
- Nothing. He burnt the letter
and said I could go.

493
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:14,454
Ah.

494
00:49:14,537 --> 00:49:19,334
He burned the letter.

495
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:28,426
- Yes.
- Strange that a chief magistrate...

496
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,806
would burn evidence
of a treasonous conspiracy...

497
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:37,894
and then
imprison the only man...

498
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:42,148
who was aware of
Monsieur Clarion's connection...

499
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:44,150
to that conspiracy.

500
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:51,866
- He was protecting someone.
- Ah.

501
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:56,663
- A dear friend perhaps?
- No. No.

502
00:49:56,746 --> 00:49:59,791
A politician like Villefort would have
rid himself of such friends.

503
00:49:59,874 --> 00:50:02,168
Clarion could be a relative.

504
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:04,462
A close relative, possibly...

505
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:10,510
No!

506
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:16,391
Villefort's father was
a colonel in Napoleon's army.

507
00:50:16,474 --> 00:50:19,185
Villefort wasn't protecting Clarion.

508
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:22,647
He was protecting himself.

509
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:26,818
Danglars, who falsely said he saw
Napoleon give me that letter.

510
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:29,738
Mondego,
who told Villefort I had it.

511
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:32,157
And Villefort himself,
who sent me here.

512
00:50:33,783 --> 00:50:38,413
Bravo, Edmond, bravo.

513
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:23,458
Oh, my God. Oh, oh.

514
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,835
Oh.

515
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:29,422
Edmond, light. Light.
Quick. Light.

516
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:32,509
Oh, please, God.
What is that? Look.

517
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:36,930
Look. Look!
Roots. Plant roots.

518
00:51:37,013 --> 00:51:41,309
If these are plant roots,
then we are only months away.

519
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:45,897
Yes. Well done, Priest.
I'll get my chisel.

520
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:49,025
Good. Good.

521
00:51:58,576 --> 00:52:00,328
Priest!

522
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:20,348
In God's name, go on.

523
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:23,810
Go on. Go on!

524
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:51,254
Lungs are punctured.

525
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,340
- Don't talk.
- Listen.
- Don't talk.

526
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:55,425
There's not much time.

527
00:52:56,926 --> 00:53:00,305
Under th-those books,
there's loose rocks.

528
00:53:03,516 --> 00:53:05,518
Quickly, quickly.

529
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:12,776
Open it.
When I told them I did not know...

530
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:15,820
where the treasure of Spada was,
I lied.

531
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,947
You lied?

532
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:21,576
I'm a priest, not a saint.

533
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,414
There, on that island
off the Italian coast.

534
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:28,792
- Monte Cristo?
- Yes, yes.

535
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,920
Use... Use your head.

536
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:34,047
- Follow the clues.
- The tunnel's blocked.

537
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,883
- I can't escape.
- Keep digging.

538
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:40,929
When you escape,
use it for good, only for good.

539
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:43,973
No, I will surely
use it for my revenge.

540
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:50,730
Do not commit...

541
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,402
Oh. Do not commit the crime...

542
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:58,989
for which you now
serve the sentence.

543
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:03,493
- God said, "Vengeance is mine."
- I don't believe in God.

544
00:54:03,576 --> 00:54:06,454
That doesn't matter.

545
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:08,540
He believes in you.

546
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,425
Priest?

547
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:28,143
Plates out.

548
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:40,113
Let's have it.

549
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:48,288
Oh.

550
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:51,166
Oh, God.

551
00:55:02,635 --> 00:55:05,013
He's always awake.

552
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:18,818
First time in 12 years
he hasn't said "Thank you."

553
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,785
- Dead.
- How?

554
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:29,120
Fell off his bed, didn't he?

555
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:32,415
- He's a bit dirty, isn't he?
- They all are.

556
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,460
Well, let's sew him up...

557
00:55:35,543 --> 00:55:37,962
and then see Dorleac.

558
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:44,761
One, two, three.

559
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,692
Right, let's get Dorleac.

560
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:06,574
Why'd you lock it?
He's not going anywhere.

561
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:09,119
I don't know.
Habit, I suppose.

562
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:30,140
Goodbye, Priest.

563
00:56:30,223 --> 00:56:33,268
You're free now...

564
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:35,353
as I will never be.

565
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:04,382
Well, bring him along.

566
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:06,551
- Let's bury him, then.
- You ready?

567
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:08,720
- Yeah.
- One. That's it.

568
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:17,103
- Keep going.
- Come on, come on.
I haven't got all day.

569
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:20,899
Actually, I do.

570
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:27,155
I've got... I've got...

571
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:30,075
all the time in the world!

572
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:46,883
Come on.

573
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,388
Come on.

574
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:06,569
Monsieur Dorleac!

575
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:10,115
Heavenly Father,
we bequeath to you...

576
00:58:10,198 --> 00:58:13,201
these remains of your humble servant.

577
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:19,082
Whatever his name was.
God, I'm so bored.

578
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:22,002
Monsieur Dorleac!

579
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:33,638
Did he, in fact, have a map?

580
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:36,182
- No, gov.
- Where's the, uh...

581
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:42,272
Stop!

582
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:44,065
Monsieur Dorleac!

583
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,151
What do you mean, after three?
We throw him at three or before three?

584
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:50,113
- After three.
- One, two...

585
00:58:50,196 --> 00:58:52,991
- Monsieur Dorleac!
- And th...

586
00:58:53,074 --> 00:58:56,995
- Don't, Monsieur Dorleac!
- One...

587
00:58:57,078 --> 00:59:00,332
- Two...
- Don't throw the body over the cliff!

588
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:02,417
three!

589
01:00:38,346 --> 01:00:40,682
We could have handled that
a bit better.

590
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,758
Thank you, Priest.

591
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:18,053
Thank you.

592
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:57,175
So, mi amice, I would ask who you are,
but in view of your shredded clothes...

593
01:01:57,258 --> 01:02:00,720
and the fact that the Chateau d'If
is two miles away...

594
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,681
what's the point?

595
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:05,350
As for me, I am Luigi Vampa...

596
01:02:05,433 --> 01:02:08,395
a smuggler and a thief.

597
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:11,564
My men and I have come to this island
to bury alive one of our number...

598
01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:14,359
who attempted to keep
some stolen gold for himself...

599
01:02:14,442 --> 01:02:16,945
instead of, uh,
sharing it with his comrades.

600
01:02:17,028 --> 01:02:20,365
Interestingly enough, there are
some of his more loyal friends...

601
01:02:20,448 --> 01:02:22,617
who are insisting
that I grant him mercy...

602
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:25,704
which, of course, I cannot do,
for I would quickly lose control...

603
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:28,248
of the whole crew.

604
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:36,673
You provide me with a way
to show a little mercy to Jacopo...

605
01:02:36,756 --> 01:02:39,134
that maggot you see
tied up over there...

606
01:02:39,217 --> 01:02:41,761
while, at the same time,
not appearing weak.

607
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:45,515
And as a special treat, the lads
will get to see a little sport as well.

608
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:47,684
How do I accomplish all this?

609
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:53,982
If Jacopo wins,
we welcome him back to the crew.

610
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:57,027
If you win, I have given Jacopo
the chance to live...

611
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,071
even if he did not
take advantage of it...

612
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:02,866
and you can take his place
on the boat.

613
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:05,577
What if I win,
and I don't want to be a smuggler?

614
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:08,038
Then we slit your throat,
and we're a bit shorthanded.

615
01:03:13,626 --> 01:03:15,628
to kill your friend, the maggot.

616
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:25,096
Perhaps you should get out more.

617
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:30,226
Release Jacopo
and give him back his knife.

618
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,270
Then we let the games begin.

619
01:03:34,522 --> 01:03:36,816
Get up, maggot.

620
01:03:45,992 --> 01:03:48,286
Come on, come on!

621
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:08,014
As you hope to live,
do not move an eyelash.

622
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:13,019
Senor Vampa, allow Jacopo to live.

623
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:17,148
He's already suffered enough with
the prospect of being buried alive.

624
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:20,026
The men that wanted
to see some sport have seen it.

625
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:23,363
Those who wanted mercy for Jacopo
will get it.

626
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:26,199
And by keeping me and Jacopo...

627
01:04:34,165 --> 01:04:37,085
- It's a deal.
- What is his name?

628
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:40,338
- You've got the devil, Jacopo!
- His name?

629
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:42,924
We shall call him Zatarra.

630
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:45,010
Sounds fearsome.

631
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:47,220
It means "driftwood."

632
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:52,350
I swear on my dead relatives,
even on the ones...

633
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:55,020
that are not feeling too good...

634
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:57,480
I am your man forever.

635
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,942
I know.

636
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,719
Eyes in the back of your head.

637
01:05:30,972 --> 01:05:34,392
Have you never seen
Marseilles before?

638
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:36,603
It was my home.

639
01:05:36,686 --> 01:05:40,023
- But you do not join the others ashore.
- Over here!

640
01:05:40,106 --> 01:05:42,567
Yeah, that's right, over here!

641
01:05:42,651 --> 01:05:45,236
Listen to me, Zatarra.
Whatever happened to you...

642
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,198
you cannot make it right
by staying here on this boat.

643
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:51,618
Go. It's up to you.

644
01:05:53,411 --> 01:05:56,039
"We are kings or pawns,"
a man once said.

645
01:05:56,122 --> 01:05:58,208
Si. Who told you this?

646
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:02,712
Napoleon Bonaparte.

647
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:09,761
Bonaparte?

648
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:12,639
Oh, Zatarra, the stories you tell.

649
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:21,731
A man is always in need
of a good friend.

650
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:25,443
Truly.

651
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,002
Danglars, what's happened?

652
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:46,840
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,
and Edmond Dantes disobeyed my orders.

653
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:14,034
Zatarra, are you all right?

654
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:16,745
Everything's changed.

655
01:07:17,954 --> 01:07:21,583
I want you to buy a boat,
just something the two of us can handle.

656
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:26,087
Wait for me to return.
I make my next visit alone.

657
01:07:31,926 --> 01:07:35,055
Is... Is this the home
of Monsieur Morell?

658
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,932
My grandfather isn't well, monsieur.

659
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:42,145
Even if he were, he would not receive
visitors at 11:00 in the evening.

660
01:07:42,228 --> 01:07:46,358
Perhaps he might make an exception for
a man who is seeking E-Edmond Dantes.

661
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:50,904
I apologize for the hour.

662
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:55,367
Old people never sleep. Sit down,
sit down. Julianne, some sherry.

663
01:07:57,661 --> 01:08:00,789
So, Monsieur Zatarra...

664
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:03,124
you were a friend of Edmond?

665
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:05,585
- Monsieur Morell?
- Yes?

666
01:08:16,429 --> 01:08:20,767
You knew Edmond also?

667
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:23,061
Like a son.

668
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:32,362
Unfortunately,
his father hanged himself...

669
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:36,408
after learning of Edmond's treason.

670
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:38,493
I see.

671
01:08:38,576 --> 01:08:41,287
I see. And...

672
01:08:43,873 --> 01:08:48,420
this treason you speak of...

673
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:51,172
- Who accused him?
- Who knows?

674
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:54,884
Monsieur Villefort,
the man who had Edmond arrested...

675
01:08:54,968 --> 01:09:00,181
left for Paris soon after to take up
the post of chief prosecutor.

676
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:03,560
Of course, the shock of
his father's violent murder...

677
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:05,729
may also have spurred his departure.

678
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:10,358
They were strange times.

679
01:09:14,654 --> 01:09:18,575
After Edmond's death,
I reluctantly took on a partner.

680
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:22,662
One of my captains.

681
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:25,874
And then one day,
Danglars forced me out.

682
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:30,295
My-My fate is nothing
compared to Edmond's.

683
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:35,342
Perhaps your luck is about to change.

684
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:45,018
You mean the Countess Mondego?

685
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:49,147
- Countess?
- Yes.

686
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,941
A month after
poor Edmond was arrested...

687
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:54,235
Mercedes wed his best friend.

688
01:09:55,654 --> 01:09:58,031
- Fernand.
- Yes, that's right.

689
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:01,076
And with the death of
his father and brother in the war...

690
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:03,912
Fernand became Count Mondego.

691
01:10:03,995 --> 01:10:06,498
They live in Paris now.

692
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:10,168
Count and Countess Mondego.

693
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:18,843
Are you all right?

694
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:22,514
Yes. I must go.

695
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:25,684
- I'm sorry I was not more helpful.
- Oh, no.

696
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:27,978
You told me what I needed to know.

697
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,440
Edmond Dantes is dead.

698
01:10:42,909 --> 01:10:45,996
Zatarra. Zatarra,
you will be so proud of me.

699
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,873
I found a nice little skiff.
We couldn't afford a sloop.

700
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:53,294
Got a really good deal.
Za-Zatarra? Zatarra.
