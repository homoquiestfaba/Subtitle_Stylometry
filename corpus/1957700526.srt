<i>( music playing )</i>

2
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:48,482
Ann: <i>San Francisco, 1971.</i>

3
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:52,687
<i>Thousands were marching in the streets
to demand an end to the Vietnam War.</i>

4
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,690
<i>Racial tensions were high
after the Hunter's Point riots.</i>

5
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,492
<i>And on January 19th,</i>

6
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:02,095
<i>two oil tankers collided
in the San Francisco Bay</i>

7
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,134
<i>spilling 800,000 gallons of
crude oil into the water.</i>

8
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,804
<i>Back then, there was no
plan for how to clean it up.</i>

9
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:13,841
<i>On one side, you had the oil
company who was responsible.</i>

10
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:18,478
<i>On the other, you had the hippies
who wanted to protect their beaches.</i>

11
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:20,548
<i>And in the middle
were the truckers.</i>

12
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:24,686
<i>This is the story of how that
oil spill changed my life</i>

13
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,521
<i>because I was
married to a trucker</i>

14
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,523
<i>named Charlie Walker.</i>

15
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,127
<i>Charlie only had one
truck to his name,</i>

16
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,698
<i>but he had plenty of hustle.</i>

17
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:38,833
<i>In the days leading
up to the oil spill,</i>

18
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,603
<i>the power center for all
trucking in the Bay Area</i>

19
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,905
<i>was a man named Chuck Sumner.</i>

20
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:47,575
<i>Maybe Chuck himself was
a racist. I don't know.</i>

21
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,912
<i>But his dispatchers
were another story.</i>

22
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:54,816
<i>Every day, Charlie would go down to
Chuck's worksites and try to get on a job,</i>

23
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,351
<i>and every day the same
thing would happen.</i>

24
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,187
Howdy, foreman. Load her up.

25
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,256
- No.
- Why?

26
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,728
'Cause you ain't
got no work order.

27
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,495
You ain't got no
Chuck Sumner truck.

28
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,566
Hell, you probably don't
even have a Class B.

29
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,367
Besides, you're blocking
the goddamn line.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,738
So if you don't haul this pile
of shit out of here right quick,

31
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:20,140
I'm gonna hook it up
and drag it off myself.

32
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,383
<i>Maybe you'd think things
would be different,</i>

33
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:33,788
<i>this being San Francisco,
but you'd be wrong.</i>

34
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,690
<i>Money was tight,</i>

35
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,458
<i>and I was trying to do my
part in managing the numbers.</i>

36
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,665
What the hell are you
doing? Put that jar away.

37
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,399
They don't be counting
pennies for food.

38
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,267
The market doesn't
care how you pay.

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,771
Well, the neighbors
do, and I'll be damned

40
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:52,305
if I have them passing the
basket around for us on Sundays.

41
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,410
What's your pocket
money gonna do for us?

42
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,913
Buy food, keep the lights on.

43
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:02,215
- And what about next week?
- Same pocket.

44
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,619
You should be laying
bricks with Willie.

45
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,421
They got steady work. He
called again last night.

46
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,432
Do you want to drive around
in that old rickety dump truck

47
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,527
burning gas, hoping,
I don't know,

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,361
Santa Claus is gonna
fill it with dirt?

49
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,564
I can't lay bricks no more.

50
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,298
You can't or you won't?

51
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,736
- I won't.
- Pooki, go play with your sisters.

52
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,810
You're gonna have to decide.

53
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:31,311
You gonna keep dreaming
about being your own boss

54
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,682
or lay bricks to
feed your family?

55
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:38,452
We lose this house in February
if you don't find work.

56
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,956
Listen, baby, if I
thought laying bricks

57
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,927
would make me a foreman
someday, I'd be first in line,

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,662
but there is no such thing

59
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,464
as a Black brick laying foreman.

60
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,700
Now, that truck is
the only thing we got.

61
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:56,771
Well, maybe come February we
should all live in the truck then.

62
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,607
I told you, I'm not
tearing my goddamn hands up

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,777
doing that brick laying
bullshit no more.

64
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,915
Buy some gloves.

65
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,861
<i>Instead of buying gloves,
Charlie doubled down,</i>

66
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,429
<i>decided the only way
to get what he wanted</i>

67
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,699
<i>was to make even more
trouble for Chuck Sumner.</i>

68
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,634
<i>Thought maybe if he
made enough trouble,</i>

69
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,804
<i>eventually Chuck would have
to start paying attention.</i>

70
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,909
We moved the drop-off to
Third and King Street.

71
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,409
Sure thing, boss.

72
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,015
All right. That's it.

73
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,851
Hey, get going,
Willie. It's on.

74
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,724
- ( radio chatter )
- That's right. Negro.

75
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,894
Not "hero." I said "Negro."

76
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,997
I got a Black Panther son of
a bitch blocking my trucks.

77
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,034
( radio chatter continues )

78
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,538
No, goddamn it.
There's a Black man!

79
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:06,373
Man on radio: <i>He don't
have no sand loader,</i>

80
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,543
<i>but he says we can get
one over here for you.</i>

81
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:16,851
You know what? I am one of those uppity
Negros looking to crash the party.

82
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,758
- Merry Christmas.
- Shit!

83
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,464
I'm gonna whip your ass, boy!

84
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,839
Ann: <i>Charlie just
wanted a fair shake,</i>

85
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:40,641
<i>a chance to have
something of his own,</i>

86
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,442
- <i>to be his own boss.</i>
- ( siren wailing )

87
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,379
<i>It wasn't about race for him,</i>

88
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:50,017
<i>but for everyone else,
it was always about race.</i>

89
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:55,022
Step out of the cab.

90
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,962
Charlie: What the hell?

91
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:03,463
You know, it is hard to
find good help these days?

92
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,465
I just dropped my
worker Willie off,

93
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,102
and I say, "Willie, make sure you
untie the banner from the truck."

94
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,104
And I'll be damned.

95
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,608
They say if you want something done
right, you gotta do it yourself.

96
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,611
- I'll take care of it.
- Don't you move.

97
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,478
Hey, man, that's not necessary.

98
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,548
I said I'll take
care of it. Be cool.

99
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,717
You don't take direction
very well, do you?

100
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,819
Now turn around and
face the vehicle.

101
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,389
Old cracker-ass cracker.

102
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,503
<i>Charlie got 30 days, but
Chuck Sumner got tired</i>

103
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,906
<i>of having Charlie be
a thorn in his side,</i>

104
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,774
<i>gave him a contract,</i>

105
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,644
<i>put him in charge of
all the Black truckers.</i>

106
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:53,915
<i>Suddenly, on our side of
town, Charlie was the man.</i>

107
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,851
<i>And that's when it happened.</i>

108
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,120
<i>Charlie was driving home,</i>

109
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,697
<i>saw a line of trucks
heading to the beach</i>

110
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,923
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

111
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,066
Woman on radio: <i>The
police are here.</i>

112
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,692
<i>There's trucks everywhere.</i>

113
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,069
Ann: <i>He didn't know
about the oil spill yet,</i>

114
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,395
<i>but he knew something was up.</i>

115
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,797
Man on radio: <i>We have a
report that a large ship hit</i>

116
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,199
<i>the Golden Gate Bridge just
after midnight tonight.</i>

117
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,802
Ann: <i>Decided he had to
follow those trucks.</i>

118
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:18,039
Street's closed. You can't get
through. You gotta go left.

119
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:21,542
Those six trucks ahead are
mine. Charlie Walker Trucking.

120
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:22,910
I gotta stay with my trucks.

121
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,254
Yeah, and I'm the
chief of police.

122
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,714
Get out of the
line and turn left.

123
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:30,518
Ask the guy behind me.
Please, go ahead. Ask him.

124
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:34,555
Look, officer, you're holding them up
too. Those are Chuck Sumner trucks.

125
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,057
Behind those are
Mike Folgers trucks.

126
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,259
Behind those are the
damn National Guard.

127
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,561
Now are you gonna hold this
line up because I'm Black

128
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:41,805
or are you gonna keep
this train rolling?

129
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,899
All right, get out of here.

130
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,843
Woman on radio: <i>Every truck and
loader within a 50-mile radius</i>

131
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,569
<i>is headed to the coastline.</i>

132
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,071
Ann: <i>Charlie
followed those trucks</i>

133
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:51,973
<i>all the way down to the beach.</i>

134
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:54,842
<i>And when he got there,
guess who he found.</i>

135
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,978
<i>Chuck Sumner himself.</i>

136
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,746
What the hell's
going on here, Chuck?

137
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,215
You got half your trucks on
this beach, so what gives?

138
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,085
We're cleaning up the million some
odd barrels of crude washing up.

139
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:06,120
Hot damn! When did it happen?

140
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,823
Midnight. Broke
the ship in half.

141
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,992
So you got the call,
Folgers got the call,

142
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,669
but nobody bother to give
old Charlie Walker a shot?

143
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,862
Look, goddamn it, what
am I supposed to do,

144
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,630
call every bar in San Francisco

145
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,308
until I find the one that
you're getting drunk in?

146
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,802
If you want in, I
suggest you hop in

147
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,105
that new Cadillac of yours
and hightail your ass

148
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:25,773
up to the Long
Wharf in Richmond.

149
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,109
- Richmond?
- Every contractor around

150
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,244
is bidding for a piece of
this right now, except you.

151
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,889
Don't send me over there just to
get me off your ass now. I want in.

152
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:36,250
Look, my hands are tied
right now. Just... here.

153
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:40,621
- Go see Mike Marshall. He's the oil man in charge.
- Mike Marshall.

154
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,623
Oh, Charlie, you think
about pulling any shit

155
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,134
like that billboard
stunt in the Mission,

156
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,227
and they'll have your
ass in a sling for good.

157
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,197
This is Tower Oil. They're
already integrated.

158
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:59,040
All: Tower Oil
out! Tower Oil out!

159
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:03,811
Ann: <i>By sunup, the hippies were
already out protesting the spill.</i>

160
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,813
<i>Charlie didn't have
to worry about them,</i>

161
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,149
<i>but he knew Tower Oil
wouldn't just let him in.</i>

162
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:12,286
<i>Just to get in line, he had to
use every trick in the book.</i>

163
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:17,058
Yo, hold it up!
Hold it up! Stop.

164
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:21,796
Didn't you see the sign?

165
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,933
What's the matter,
boy? Can't you read?

166
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,606
- What's your name, officer?
- What did you say to me?

167
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,212
I said, "What's your fucking name,
off-ic-er?" Don't you speak English?

168
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,682
I don't think you understand
what's going on here, son.

169
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,284
See, this is private property.

170
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,329
Now you're gonna have to back this piece
of shit up and move it on out of here.

171
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,190
Look, damn it, I work for
Tower Oil in Los Angeles.

172
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:53,027
I'm the superintendent in charge of
contamination for the entire North Coast.

173
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,329
Yeah, well, this ain't
Los "Ang-geh-lees."

174
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,065
I don't need this shit. Give
me your name and badge number

175
00:09:58,099 --> 00:09:59,342
so I can report
this to Marshall.

176
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,369
- Marshall?
- Name, badge number.

177
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:05,206
You know Mike Marshall?

178
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:09,110
Mike Marshall, white
dude, about yay tall,

179
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:12,012
bosses peckerwoods like
you around for a living.

180
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:17,051
- You gotta understand, um...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

181
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,062
- We don't get many, uh...
- Still ain't no excuse.

182
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,123
No. I'm sorry about this, sir.

183
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:25,893
Now what did you say
your name was again?

184
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,729
Man: Look, fellas, we're gonna
need every truck we can muster.

185
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,065
We got small areas,
but a lot of them.

186
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,901
Look about, boys,
I got me a beast.

187
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,382
Some of you are gonna
have to pair up,

188
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,375
but do not worry
about the money.

189
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:45,212
Every contractor's gonna get his
own purchase order with an open end.

190
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:47,248
- All: Yeah!
- Now at the end of the day,

191
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:50,384
a Tower Oil rep is gonna
sign off on your invoices,

192
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:54,922
but we need some kind
of billing every day.

193
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,325
Now if there are any problems,
feel free to call me.

194
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,896
All right, Half Moon Bay.

195
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,406
Who can work the beach
at Half Moon Bay?

196
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,167
All right, you, you, and you.

197
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:12,773
Uh, San Mateo. Red, that's
your neck of the woods.

198
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,809
You take San Mateo and take
two other guys from this group.

199
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,781
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

200
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:25,252
Why, that doesn't surprise
me. Now I see the resemblance.

201
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:29,823
You owe me a construction tower,
boy, and I'm gonna get it.

202
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,962
You and you, let's go work.

203
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,331
Haines: Stinson
Beach, Marin County.

204
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,301
One way in, one way out.

205
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:43,871
We only need a small
crew, one or two trucks.

206
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,808
- Come on, anybody.
- Nah, no way. I ain't gonna do that.

207
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,343
Stinson Beach, guys.

208
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,245
Here. Right here.
I'll take it.

209
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,815
Come on, anybody!

210
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,284
You're gonna get a truck
in or out of there.

211
00:11:57,318 --> 00:12:00,988
Why don't you integrate
and give a brother a job?

212
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,495
- Name?
- Charlie Walker.

213
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,964
Company name.

214
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,499
Oh, Charlie Walker Trucking.

215
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:15,035
This is gonna take three
trucks. You got that many?

216
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,305
- No, but I'll get them.
- Fine.

217
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,008
- You'll make it work.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,844
I work with Chuck Sumner Trucking
too. I'll get the rest form him.

219
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,981
With this blank purchase order,
you can get anything you need.

220
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,183
Now we're not concerned
about the money right now.

221
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,852
Just get that damn
oil off the beach,

222
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,463
you understand what
I'm saying to you, son?

223
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,089
Yes, sir.

224
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,890
Get the damn oil off
the beach. I got it.

225
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,766
Thank you, sir.

226
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,446
( ringing )

227
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,420
Is this the police?

228
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,889
No, this ain't the police!

229
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,300
Baby, you'll never guess
what just happened.

230
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,960
Charlie Walker, do you
know what time it is?

231
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,129
Of course I know
what time it is.

232
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,430
What time is it?

233
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,234
It's 6:00 in the damn morning.

234
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,537
Baby, baby, we gonna be rich.

235
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,905
We gonna pay off the house.
We gonna buy another truck.

236
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:28,242
I got another hour before I gotta
get the girls dressed for school,

237
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,911
and you're calling me
at 6 in the morning

238
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,447
after you've been
out all night again?

239
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,516
Bye!

240
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,218
Bye.

241
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,423
Ann: <i>Now, the oil company
was hiring truckers</i>

242
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:45,092
<i>like Charlie to
take the oil away,</i>

243
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,094
<i>but who was gonna get
it off the beaches</i>

244
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,196
<i>and into the trucks
in the first place?</i>

245
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,566
<i>For that they decided
to work with the people</i>

246
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:54,401
<i>who were already out
there doing it for free,</i>

247
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:56,437
<i>the hippies.</i>

248
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,340
<i>But it wasn't exactly
a match made in heaven.</i>

249
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,446
Sorry to interrupt
you, Mr. Bennett,

250
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,615
but I have the contract
reports you asked for.

251
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:12,119
Why don't you save me the read
and just give me the high points?

252
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,288
Do we have enough
boots on the ground?

253
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:19,893
- I think so.
- Wow, VP of Tower Oil San Francisco office

254
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,396
has just assured me
that he thinks so.

255
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,964
I mean, yes, we do.

256
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,600
We have every truck,
loader, and operator

257
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,468
in the Bay Area under contract.

258
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,969
So we're doing
everything we can.

259
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,648
You still haven't answered
my question, Walter.

260
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:32,607
It's the volunteers, sir.

261
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,409
As long as the volunteers
stay onboard, we can keep up.

262
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,646
This whole thing hinges on a
bunch of hippie war protestors?

263
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,982
- Volunteers, sir.
- Fine.

264
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,519
Then just keep
them volunteering.

265
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,153
Walter: That's
the tricky part.

266
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:49,323
Most of these people were protestors a
week ago, and we can't get near them.

267
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,992
They can't be protesting

268
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,460
and helping at the same time.

269
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:56,029
- Which is it?
- It's a mess, sir.

270
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:03,003
Walter, you know the
difference between a hippie

271
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:07,675
and a couple of corporate
assholes like you and me?

272
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,177
No, sir.

273
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,348
- Credit cards.
- Credit cards?

274
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,417
Yeah, a steady paycheck,

275
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,655
consumer debt, dental coverage,

276
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:23,357
paid sick leave, and
as many free pens

277
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,360
and pencils as they can steal.

278
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:27,633
You understand what I'm saying?

279
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,600
- Yes.
- Pay them.

280
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,036
Give them money.

281
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,681
I don't care if you have
to sneak up behind them

282
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,174
and stuff twenties
in their pockets.

283
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,611
Get them sucking on the teat.

284
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:44,685
I'll take care of it, sir.

285
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:49,551
And, Sharpe, money is no object.

286
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:52,052
Yes, sir. Understood.

287
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,524
Man on radio: <i>At approximately
1:42 this morning,</i>

288
00:15:56,558 --> 00:16:00,060
<i>two Tower Oil tankers collided just
east of the Golden Gate Bridge.</i>

289
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,062
Ann: <i>Stinson Beach,
where Charlie was headed,</i>

290
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,064
<i>is up north of the Golden Gate.</i>

291
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,701
<i>It was hard to get
to, and nobody thought</i>

292
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:09,504
<i>it was gonna be a big
job, but for Charlie,</i>

293
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:13,073
<i>it was an opportunity to show
the world what he could do.</i>

294
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,109
( phone ringing )

295
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:24,586
Yes. Yes, sir. Mr. Sharpe
is working on that.

296
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:27,421
Yes, we're getting more
volunteers all the time.

297
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,094
Tell them we're gonna
need more hay bales.

298
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,726
Woman: I did. We have another
nine or ten on the way.

299
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,328
Yes, sir. They're working.

300
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,997
Um, all we have are
volunteers at the moment.

301
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:43,136
( squeaking )

302
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,610
Hay bales don't soak up oil.

303
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:50,645
You're just making
a bigger mess.

304
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,747
- May I help you?
- Yes.

305
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,251
Can I get a cheeseburger on
white bread with extra mayo?

306
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,253
- And a vanilla shake?
- Excuse me.

307
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,622
We're a little busy right now.

308
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:03,625
If you wanna help,
the beach is that way.

309
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:05,636
You might want to get out of
those fancy clothes first.

310
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,563
I'm the contractor who's
gonna clean up that mess.

311
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:13,133
- You're the who?
- I'm Charlie Walker. Nice to meet you.

312
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,571
- You're Mr. Walker?
- One and only.

313
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:19,574
Ah, okay. Wait right here.

314
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:22,075
Let me let them know that
you're here. Wait right there.

315
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,716
( phone ringing )

316
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:40,294
Ann: <i>You ever heard that
expression, "the winds of change"?</i>

317
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,096
<i>Well, that's what was
about to happen to Charlie.</i>

318
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,502
<i>Mother Nature decided to surprise
everybody and blow most of that oil</i>

319
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:49,303
<i>straight past
those other beaches</i>

320
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:52,239
<i>and all the way up to Stinson.</i>

321
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,509
<i>Tower Oil probably
would've replaced Charlie</i>

322
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,310
<i>with one of those
white truckers,</i>

323
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,312
<i>but he was one step ahead.</i>

324
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,180
<i>By the time they got there,</i>

325
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,518
<i>he'd already gotten himself
in front of the cameras.</i>

326
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:05,687
I'm going to do
whatever it takes

327
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,822
to get every bit of oil
off this beautiful beach

328
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:09,624
and out of every
ravine and inlet.

329
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:11,859
In fact, this beach will
be in better condition

330
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:13,895
when I leave than
it's ever been before.

331
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,830
We consider ourselves
lucky to have someone

332
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,566
of Mr. Walker's experience
out here on such short notice.

333
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,201
- Now step aside. Move aside.
- We have little time to spare.

334
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,547
I need to get out there immediately
and survey what we're up against.

335
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:27,875
Right this way, Mr. Walker.
Nicely done in there.

336
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:29,611
Well, those people I can handle.

337
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:32,446
It's you all that concerns me.

338
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:37,417
- How's that?
- Well, see, there's a small matter of me being, um...

339
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,754
Black.

340
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:41,656
I hadn't noticed.

341
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,492
I like the way you do
things, Mr. Sharpe.

342
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:49,631
Let's hope I come to share those
same feelings for you, Mr. Walker.

343
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,937
Yeah, we initially thought this
area was going to be contained.

344
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,339
- But you were wrong.
- But we were wrong.

345
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:02,744
Winds do change. Bite
you in the ass sometimes.

346
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:04,444
Can we count on you, Charlie?

347
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:10,752
Well, it will have to
be taken out by hand.

348
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:14,589
Maybe we could take the tainted
materials and move it to a holding area.

349
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:17,391
- That might work.
- Might work.

350
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,268
I'll get you those trucks.
What else you gonna need?

351
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,664
A drink, a phone,

352
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:24,508
and I think I'll get old
Chuck Sumner on the phone

353
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,266
and see if I can get
some more trucks.

354
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,670
All right, let's get
you back to base camp.

355
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,680
To hell with the suit, Charlie!
We'll buy you a new one.

356
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,887
By the way, you're staying
at the Stinson Beach Motel.

357
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,389
We've rented the entire building
out for Tower employees.

358
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:53,293
So don't bother punching out and or
going home at the end of the night.

359
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,797
This is a full-time
job. You live here now.

360
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,801
- I'm gonna need two rooms.
- Money is no object.

361
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,869
You know, everybody
keeps saying that,

362
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:03,805
but I have yet to see any of it.

363
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:06,507
I'm beginning to think it
is no object after all.

364
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:11,445
Here's 25,000, petty cash.

365
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,648
It'll get you through
tonight and tomorrow.

366
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,950
- Thanks.
- You've met Dan Wallace.

367
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,653
He'll handle all our force accounts.
He'll take care of everything.

368
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:21,455
Money, personnel,
and everything.

369
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,734
Without the trucks, all we can do
is mix with the locals for now.

370
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:27,494
The cavalry's on the way,
Charlie. Don't let us down.

371
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,838
Reporter: <i>came under heavy ground
fire in the Song Ve valley.</i>

372
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,741
<i>( TV chatter continues )</i>

373
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:47,849
<i>( gunfire on TV )</i>

374
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:51,384
Ann: <i>Charlie had been in the military
right when they were integrating,</i>

375
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,353
<i>so he understood that survival</i>

376
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,757
<i>wasn't just about
fighting the enemy.</i>

377
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,359
<i>Sometimes you had to keep
an eye on your friends too.</i>

378
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,995
<i>If the oil guys were smart,</i>

379
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,998
<i>Charlie would just have
to be even smarter.</i>

380
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,900
<i>And with all that oil coming in</i>

381
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,002
<i>and no plan for how to stop it,</i>

382
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:12,640
<i>he was gonna have to start
getting creative pretty fast.</i>

383
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,943
<i>And he was gonna need all the
friends on the ground he could get.</i>

384
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,452
What's going on?

385
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,789
Woman: Some guys
beat up an oil man.

386
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:31,526
- Oil man?
- Yeah, some suit got beat up.

387
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,795
All right.

388
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:41,502
- What's going down, fellas?
- Looks like that dude was in a hatchet fight

389
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:43,046
and was the only one
without their hatchet.

390
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,940
Must've slipped and
fell real bad, ya dig?

391
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,743
Oh, I dig. But if any of
you try to rat pack me,

392
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:51,679
somebody's going to
the morgue, do you dig?

393
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,881
Got no beef with you, man.

394
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:58,553
Fuck that puppet and his
corporate puppet master.

395
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:01,956
He's one of my puppets.
So what can I do for you?

396
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:05,993
You have my full attention.
How can I help you?

397
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:09,564
- You can't be the boss.
- Why? 'Cause I'm Black?

398
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:12,477
Or because you can't find your own
asshole with a mirror and a long stick?

399
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,070
You're not the boss.

400
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,573
Fine. Follow me.

401
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:20,842
And bring your hippie
commune with you.

402
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:24,946
Why, hello, Mr. Walker.
I have a packet for you.

403
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:27,715
You've met Mr. Sharpe.
This is Mr. Bennett.

404
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:30,084
He's the president of
Tower Oil, and he came here

405
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:32,553
to meet you personally
to discuss your approach.

406
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:34,722
Welcome, Mr. Bennett.
Good to meet you, sir.

407
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:38,793
You too, Charlie. Now that we're
all pals, what's your plan?

408
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:42,830
Well, we have a three-mile stretch
of beach, all of which is infected.

409
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:45,733
We're using loaders to take off
the top layer, but it's slow going.

410
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:48,468
Honestly, we're just
moving shit around.

411
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:55,475
I mean, the tainted material.

412
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:58,546
Same problem at Ocean
Beach and Half Moon Bay.

413
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:01,048
We just got back from there
and it's a fucking mess.

414
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:08,122
We'll manage, but our biggest
threat is in the Bolinas Lagoon.

415
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:11,058
If the oil gets in there, we'll
be here for the next three years.

416
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,961
Now what are we
doing about that?

417
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:18,065
- Some locals are putting together an oil boom.
- Out of what?

418
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,001
Well, anything they
get their hands on.

419
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:22,837
They're using logs,
fishing nets, hay.

420
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,006
We build them in series,
so there's a gap.

421
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,718
Then we use local boats to drag it
to the beach. Then we haul it off.

422
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:31,444
- Is it working?
- Yes, sir. For now.

423
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:34,447
Nice work, Charlie. We're
gonna leave Dan here.

424
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,517
You're coming with
us to Candlestick.

425
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,153
Maybe you can share some of your
ideas with the other guys, huh?

426
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:43,991
Mr. Wallace, move most of the
equipment up north to the inlet.

427
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,569
They're gonna need some
relief with the boom work.

428
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:46,661
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

429
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:48,729
And who are these good folks?

430
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:51,933
Oh, they're heading up
the volunteer effort.

431
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:56,804
They're good kids.
Real go-getters.

432
00:23:56,837 --> 00:24:02,910
Great. Well, we'll come back in a
couple days to get acquainted with them.

433
00:24:02,944 --> 00:24:05,212
Let's get going, guys, huh?

434
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:22,897
<i>Charlie had bought
himself a little time,</i>

435
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,066
<i>but he knew it
wouldn't be enough.</i>

436
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:27,201
<i>He needed to think fast,</i>

437
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,971
<i>so he did what he
always did best.</i>

438
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:32,173
<i>He improvised.</i>

439
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:37,511
- Who's using those?
- Using what?

440
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:39,847
Skip loaders. The
paddle scrapers.

441
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,817
No one. They were in the way,
so we parked them out here.

442
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,585
- I want them.
- For what?

443
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:46,187
I just want them.

444
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,689
Can we get them on low-boys
and get 'em to my beach?

445
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:51,292
Sure, if you think you
can use them, you got it.

446
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:55,129
I'll take care of it. They'll be on
your beach before sundown tomorrow.

447
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:58,933
- I want them both.
- We're gonna take you over to Ocean Beach,

448
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:01,166
then out to the Farrallons,
and then we'll get you home.

449
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:03,771
Don't worry, Charlie.

450
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:05,940
We got a nice place down here.

451
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:09,010
Get some oysters and raw clams,

452
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:11,278
maybe on runny eggs.

453
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:16,784
( retches, coughs )

454
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:34,635
Charlie, what kind of shit
are you pulling out here?

455
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:37,571
- What are you talking about?
- We're not building freeways.

456
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:39,273
This ain't no tar
and gravel job.

457
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:42,910
Why are you wasting my time
with these paddle scrapers?

458
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:46,123
I told Bennett it'd be cheaper to turn the whole
thing into a parking lot, and he bought it.

459
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:48,149
That's it. I'm leaving.

460
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:50,985
No, no. Wait, Chuck.
I'm just kidding.

461
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,787
Settle down.

462
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,556
Hey, Dan, you excuse us, please?

463
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:59,226
Sure. No problem.

464
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:06,000
Look, Chuck, if these oil guys
spend five million dollars

465
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,177
and it all goes
through our books,

466
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:09,770
we make 20% off the top.

467
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:12,306
That's over fifty an
hour for the equipment.

468
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:15,609
I figure between you and
me, profit and overhead,

469
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:18,879
we clear $375,000 each.

470
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,882
Hell, I'll take every skip
loader you got, running or not.

471
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,684
You're just gonna let them sit,

472
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:26,353
- but charge for them?
- Maybe.

473
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:30,191
Look, they're not making a penny
parked at Candlestick, am I right?

474
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:35,196
You got these suits running around
like idiots on one end of the beach

475
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:36,864
and these hippies on the other.

476
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:38,699
You are building a
monster here, Charlie.

477
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:41,635
- You better watch your ass.
- Money is no object.

478
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:44,839
Whoever told you that
is a liar or a thief.

479
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:47,908
Hey, I got a work order
like everybody else.

480
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:52,646
Oh, yeah, so now you're like
everybody else, huh, Charlie?

481
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,315
Well, congratulations.

482
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:02,857
Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?

483
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,125
That some kind of white thing?

484
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:07,361
Hey, I'm only kidding, man.

485
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:09,897
Come on, let me buy you a drink.

486
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,672
Hello, Mr. Walker.

487
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:21,742
I'm Agent Peaks.
This is Agent Banks.

488
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:24,778
We understand you're in
charge. Is that right?

489
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:26,914
You already know my name.

490
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:29,917
You're the white folks to
assume that I'm in charge.

491
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,120
- What'd I win?
- I'll make this brief.

492
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,755
We're here to put you on notice.

493
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:37,258
- Notice of what?
- It's all in the documents.

494
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,026
You've been officially served.

495
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:44,098
- What's this?
- No one works for free

496
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:45,766
in the state of California

497
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,401
unless they willingly
volunteer to aid

498
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,837
in a natural disaster
relief effort.

499
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,773
Those two ships
belong to Tower Oil.

500
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:55,943
Tower Oil is a corporation, and
therefore solely responsible

501
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:58,445
for compensating all workers
helping with the cleanup.

502
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:02,850
You have no volunteers. You have
employees and subcontractors.

503
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:04,418
Therefore, you must abide

504
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:07,288
by California's
employment and labor laws.

505
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:08,422
It's all in the packet.

506
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:11,125
Corporations don't
have volunteers.

507
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:12,693
Son of a bitch.

508
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:21,178
Most of these people were on the
beach before we even got here.

509
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:23,103
How are we supposed to
track them all down?

510
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:26,307
Well, therein lies the problem.

511
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,809
Have a good day, Mr. Walker.

512
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:31,111
We'll be back to check
on your progress.

513
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:33,113
What happens if we
can't find everyone?

514
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:35,449
If some of these
people don't get paid?

515
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,218
Then we shut you down.

516
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:43,490
Thanks. Have a nice day.

517
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:53,167
This is wild, man. We
have a Black president.

518
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,136
Yeah, man. President
of Stinson Beach.

519
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:00,007
How's it feel? The power, man?

520
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:06,880
Can I be honest with you?

521
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:12,753
I thought it would feel more...

522
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:20,027
I thought it would feel
more white, you know?

523
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,098
Like, if power were a color,

524
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:27,768
it would be white as snow.

525
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:30,170
You dig?

526
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:37,444
But I still feel as Black
as I did when I was a kid.

527
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:41,882
Huh.

528
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,784
That's wild, man.

529
00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:53,994
I'm just fucking
with you, nature boy.

530
00:29:54,028 --> 00:29:57,931
It doesn't feel like anything.

531
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:02,870
Hey, you all want jobs?

532
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:04,539
No way, man.

533
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,206
Not even for your
Black president?

534
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,145
- Do I look like a suit to you?
- No, you do not.

535
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:14,081
Then why you want to come
at me like I'm another suit?

536
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:17,251
I'm here to clean up your
home town. That's it.

537
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:20,421
When I'm done,
I'm gone. Period.

538
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:25,092
You get to keep your souls
and some serious bread.

539
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,860
I can trust you, right?

540
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:29,330
Because I know you can trust me.

541
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,903
Now I'm gonna put
$10,000 in your hand.

542
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:38,439
And I want you to pay anyone and
everyone who so much as kicked

543
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:41,108
a rock with oil on this
beach since day one.

544
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:43,119
I want you to tell them,
"Charlie Walker says thank you,

545
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,112
and he's paying
you for your help."

546
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,590
Now all they gotta
do is come down here,

547
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,949
sign a little piece of paper.

548
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:51,952
They hand you the
slip, you pay them.

549
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:55,022
You hand the slip
back to me. That's it.

550
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,558
Woman: Right on, man.

551
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:59,993
Cross my palm, kemosabe.

552
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:05,600
Now you said I could trust you.

553
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,334
Now I want you to
trust me for a second.

554
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:09,970
If you burn me,

555
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:13,641
you can trust I will
come back one day,

556
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:16,443
not tomorrow, not next week,

557
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:19,614
not next year,
but after all this

558
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:22,483
is nothing more than
a fading memory.

559
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:26,987
And then I'll remind you
that you broke our trust

560
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,023
by putting a bullet in your ass.

561
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:36,531
I like you, man.
We're straight.

562
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,236
( indistinct shouting )

563
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,342
- Hey, can I get a copy of those?
- Absolutely.

564
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,015
It'll be in the SF
Journal this afternoon.

565
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:52,647
You can read about
it in 3 1/2 hours.

566
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,349
Damn. News does travel fast.

567
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:58,318
You're the first foreman that
hasn't run me off their beach.

568
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:00,020
I'm Charlie Walker.
Welcome to my beach.

569
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:01,922
Come by any time.

570
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:07,094
<i>Charlie was cool with the
press and the hippies.</i>

571
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:10,063
<i>Like I said, he
was one step ahead.</i>

572
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:16,538
Sharpe: We need the
governor to step in.

573
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:20,007
The National Guard will
bring a level of control.

574
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,678
The moment this thing gets
outside, we lose control.

575
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:27,047
Sacramento is an
unpredictable town.

576
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,684
I understand the risks,
but we need their help.

577
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:32,687
It's only a matter of time
before he makes the call himself.

578
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,256
All right, call him.

579
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:43,063
Hello. Yes.

580
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:46,200
Walter Sharpe, vice president of
Tower Oil San Francisco office.

581
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:50,204
- The governor is expecting my call.
- Son of a bitch.

582
00:32:50,237 --> 00:32:52,507
He did it.

583
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,743
- Hang up. Hang up!
- ( clears throat )

584
00:32:55,777 --> 00:33:00,180
Hello? Governor Reagan, sir.

585
00:33:00,214 --> 00:33:02,416
Well, Ronnie, I wanted
to call you personally

586
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:06,420
to let you know that we have
everything under control.

587
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:09,423
- Last one inside has to fold the bags!
- Hey, that's not fair!

588
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:12,660
Everybody gets a bag to fold!
I'm not playing with y'all.

589
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:18,666
( screaming )

590
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,745
( dog barking )

591
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,527
Landi, Dee Dee, Pooki,
come to Mommy's room now!

592
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:51,265
You run to Aunt Ruby's house and
you stay there until I come for you.

593
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:53,138
Don't tell anyone about
this money, you hear me?

594
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,102
You hide it under that
nasty old couch of hers,

595
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:56,771
and you tell her I
left for the store.

596
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:58,573
- Kids: Uh-huh. Yes, Mama.
- Now get!

597
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:10,785
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, baby.

598
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:12,654
We heard you're the
big man on the beach.

599
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:15,289
Maybe. Who are your friends?

600
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:18,125
This is Mae and this is Black.

601
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:20,628
Hm. They call you Black 'cause
you're the only sister in town?

602
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,564
Her real name's Coffi.

603
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:28,135
'Cause I'm hot, Black,
and full of sugar.

604
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:31,506
- So do you like to party, man?
- Does a hippie wear beads?

605
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,840
So what do they call you?

606
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:35,309
Around here most
people call me "sir."

607
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:38,145
Oh. All right, sir.

608
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:40,548
- So where's the party tonight, ladies?
- Where you staying?

609
00:34:40,582 --> 00:34:43,317
Oh. It's that kind of party.

610
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,587
- You scared?
- I wouldn't say that,

611
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,623
but we're at a perfectly good bar
serving perfectly good drinks.

612
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:49,691
Why leave?

613
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:53,393
You got any coke?

614
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:03,103
You know, you can
call me Charlie.

615
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:08,543
You got any coke, Charlie?

616
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:15,415
- You got a score?
- Get your keys.

617
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,620
Well, all right.

618
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:22,557
<i>♪ Tell me the truth ♪</i>

619
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:30,932
Okay, so look, man,
you want two ounces?

620
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:32,667
I have maybe an
ounce and a 1/2 here.

621
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,503
If you can wait till tomorrow,
I'll have another two.

622
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:38,740
Just give me what you got and
keep your finger off the scale.

623
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:40,742
- Ooh.
- Oh.

624
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:42,242
Be cool.

625
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:43,878
I don't run that
kind of operation.

626
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:46,246
This is a non-profit, you dig?

627
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:49,917
So here's the money, my man.

628
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:54,154
Say, man, you mind if I
take a few of these with me?

629
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:59,359
You're not thinking about setting
up shop here in town, are you?

630
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:03,397
It ain't like that. I
know this is your zone.

631
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,266
I just need to spread some
powder around, that's all.

632
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,804
Sure, man, no big thing.

633
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:13,473
As long as you're not
selling, we're cool.

634
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:21,616
- Do you think I'm pretty?
- Cute as a damn button.

635
00:36:21,649 --> 00:36:24,852
- But I gotta go.
- ( scoffs )

636
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:28,288
( doorbell rings )

637
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:31,291
- Mrs. Walker?
- That's me.

638
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:32,964
We have a warrant to
search your property.

639
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:36,196
- What took you so long?
- Step aside, please.

640
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,602
Ann: Is this what
you're looking for?

641
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,945
Now I know these are
sexy. But illegal?

642
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:52,747
I hardly think so.

643
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,917
Unless you are some kind of
really kinky-ass white boys.

644
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,619
I'm sorry we wasted your time.

645
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:03,658
Not smart.

646
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:07,327
Ann: <i>I didn't know whose payroll
these white boys were on,</i>

647
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,329
<i>but one thing was for sure.</i>

648
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:12,867
<i>Someone was trying to
bring Charlie down.</i>

649
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:22,510
Charlie, you in
there? Charlie!

650
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:25,046
Ah, man, what do you want?

651
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,981
Hey, the paddle scrapers
are doing their job.

652
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:29,951
Yeah, tell me something I don't
know. I put them there. Shit.

653
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,020
The TV news reporters are
here. They want to talk to you.

654
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:34,689
Why the hell didn't
you tell me, man?

655
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:37,357
- Who's been talking to them?
- Me.

656
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,860
Ain't this something.

657
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:41,428
You're on TV and I'm
there sawing logs.

658
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:44,364
Damn it, Dan, I told you I want to
talk to these people my damn self.

659
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:47,068
- You're supposed to come get me.
- I am getting you.

660
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:49,637
Next time you get
me sooner. Come on.

661
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:55,643
Woman: <i>Of the many Bay
Area beach communities,</i>

662
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:58,513
<i>none of have been more
impacted by the Tower Oil spill</i>

663
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:01,082
<i>than the small town of
Stinson in Marin County.</i>

664
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,951
<i>Known for its white sandy
beaches and abundant wildlife,</i>

665
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:06,386
<i>this once peaceful sanctuary</i>

666
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:09,456
<i>has been transformed into
a disaster zone overnight.</i>

667
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:11,025
<i>A small group of volunteers</i>

668
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:13,460
<i>have rallied to save as
many birds as possible</i>

669
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:15,096
<i>while others begin
the monumental task</i>

670
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:17,497
<i>of clearing the oil
from the sand and rocks.</i>

671
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:20,034
<i>However, they fight
an unrelenting foe.</i>

672
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:24,005
<i>With every wave comes more and
more heavy crude onto the beach.</i>

673
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:26,406
<i>Until now, the only
method of cleanup</i>

674
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,676
<i>was to admit defeat and
wait for the oil to come.</i>

675
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,878
<i>The cleanup would
last for years.</i>

676
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,947
<i>But one man, Charlie Walker,</i>

677
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,683
<i>Tower Oil's
supervisor in charge,</i>

678
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:38,753
<i>has managed to turn the tides
with his unconventional methods.</i>

679
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:42,089
<i>Specialized heavy equipment used
to skim thin layers of roadway</i>

680
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:44,559
<i>now scoop up the oil before it
can make its way to the beach,</i>

681
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:47,128
<i>keeping this small team
of workers and volunteers</i>

682
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:49,564
<i>one step ahead of
the incoming threat.</i>

683
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:52,066
<i>We had a chance to speak with
Tower Oil's man in charge,</i>

684
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,802
<i>Mr. Charlie Walker,
about his success so far.</i>

685
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:56,571
It's really
remarkable, Mr. Walker.

686
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:57,939
We were at Ocean
Beach yesterday,

687
00:38:57,972 --> 00:38:59,583
and it's still completely
covered in black muck.

688
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:01,709
- What's you're secret?
- It's no secret.

689
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:04,582
I do things my way, and they're doing
things the best they can, I'm sure.

690
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:07,092
It's just a matter of time before
they get things under control.

691
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:10,585
And there you have
it, the man in charge.

692
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:13,788
Charlie Walker, staying ahead of the
power curve here at Stinson Beach.

693
00:39:13,821 --> 00:39:16,456
I need to see you
alone for a minute.

694
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:18,092
Damn, baby. I miss you too.

695
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:21,461
No. There were some
men in our home.

696
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:23,430
Men? What men?

697
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:25,465
Daddy, can we go in the water?

698
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:28,069
Please, Daddy, we can
swim in our clothes.

699
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:30,805
No, honeybee, it's
polluted right now.

700
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:33,941
But you can eat all the ice
cream and hot dogs you want.

701
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:37,477
Wow. We're rich!

702
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:42,759
You know that boy is mocking us.

703
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:45,987
Now hold on. He is
making progress.

704
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,624
Look, I'm not up here to see
his people make progress.

705
00:39:49,657 --> 00:39:52,727
To the whole damn world, we look like
we've got a Negro running this show.

706
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,596
I've got 2,500 men
working for me.

707
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,732
How do you expect me to
explain all this shit to 'em?

708
00:39:57,765 --> 00:40:01,468
You tell them I'm
running the goddamn show,

709
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,603
and if you don't like it,

710
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:04,505
you can go to the
board of directors

711
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:06,207
and try out your piss on them.

712
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,510
If not, well, I
suggest you go back

713
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:11,145
to your people and remind them

714
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:14,515
that this situation
is temporary.

715
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:18,519
All right, gentlemen,
I thank you for coming.

716
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:22,156
You'll getting your daily progress
reports as usual, all right?

717
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:27,128
Now I suggest you get a drink and
enjoy this fabulous city, huh?

718
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:30,164
Yeah. Ride a streetcar.

719
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:32,934
Try the sourdough bread
and the clam chowder!

720
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:37,204
( chuckles ) You...

721
00:40:37,238 --> 00:40:39,816
You know, I can have him out of
there by morning. Just say the word.

722
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,544
No. No, no, no. We missed
our chance on that.

723
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:48,916
If we take him out now, the NAACP and
the papers will go national on us.

724
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:54,221
"Tower Oil chooses environmental disaster
over the magical Black superhero."

725
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:58,726
- No, it's a loser.
- What's our move?

726
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:01,062
We pay him a visit
like we planned,

727
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:04,231
take his temperature.
( clicks tongue )

728
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:08,903
( giggling )

729
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,213
Hey, y'all stay
off that bed, now.

730
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,739
I gotta sleep there tonight.

731
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:17,878
What?

732
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:23,918
- You're not worried?
- Worried?

733
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,553
Why should I be worried?

734
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,088
Because the police
are putting drugs

735
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,622
in our home, Charlie.

736
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:31,092
I told you, those
aren't the police.

737
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,493
Does it matter?

738
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:37,865
- Hey.
- ( girls giggling )

739
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:39,934
I know you worry.

740
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:42,103
But it's okay now.

741
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:44,271
Minus me and the girls,

742
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:46,240
you're the only Black
folk around here.

743
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:48,776
Oh, they got a Black girl here.

744
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:51,012
Oh, really? You don't say.

745
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:56,117
Mm-hmm. ( laughs )

746
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,619
Hey, it ain't like that.

747
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:03,791
I'm just saying that these
people are open-minded.

748
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:05,960
They don't see color.

749
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:08,262
They just want their
town back, that's all.

750
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:12,633
All right. If you say.

751
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,635
Hey, now, don't do that.

752
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:17,638
I'm not doing anything I don't do
all the time. That's what I do.

753
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:20,274
I say my piece, you
speak your mind,

754
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:23,277
and then I smack my lips.

755
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,912
It don't matter anyway.

756
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:27,648
I got the contracts,
I got the truck,

757
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:28,983
and I got the money.

758
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:31,819
I got this.

759
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:35,156
Hey, this is still America,

760
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:37,992
and America is still the
same place it was yesterday.

761
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:40,361
- You talking crazy.
- Nothing changes overnight.

762
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:43,664
That's... that's... ain't nothing
change over the past week,

763
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:46,000
the last month,
the last 100 years.

764
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:49,003
You got some money, you think you
Mr. Big Stuff with all these hippies.

765
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:53,808
But to those oil men, you are 10 steps
away from being a runaway nigger.

766
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,853
I'm sorry, girls.

767
00:43:05,886 --> 00:43:08,022
We don't use that
word in our home.

768
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:10,624
I'm sorry.

769
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:19,867
( girls giggling )

770
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,203
What's wrong?

771
00:43:22,236 --> 00:43:23,370
You don't trust me?

772
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:27,374
That's never been the issue.

773
00:43:27,408 --> 00:43:30,177
You're the one person I
do trust, Charlie Walker.

774
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,650
<i>Charlie's instincts paid off.</i>

775
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:38,719
<i>The paddle scrapers turned
out to be the best way</i>

776
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:42,723
<i>to get oil off the beaches
that anybody had come up with.</i>

777
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,358
<i>Between the scrapers
and the hippies,</i>

778
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:47,228
<i>Charlie was getting
the oil under control.</i>

779
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:50,064
<i>But he still had to
manage the politics,</i>

780
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:53,968
<i>and the best way to do
that was an open bar.</i>

781
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:57,271
Heh. You throw a hell
of a party, Charlie.

782
00:43:57,304 --> 00:44:00,241
Oh, it's not my doing.
It's like this every night.

783
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:02,243
These some happy,
free-loving people.

784
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:05,279
Uh, free love, is
that what it is?

785
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:12,753
So, gentlemen, we
are looking good.

786
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:14,264
I've cross-checked
the expense reports

787
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:16,257
from the three other
large beaches in the area.

788
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,092
We're coming in less
than the average.

789
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,103
We're not only farther along,
but we're coming in cheaper.

790
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:25,099
Why don't we hold back on the
business talk tonight, huh, Dan?

791
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:27,101
Huh? It's been a long week.

792
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:31,105
Relax. Enjoy yourself.

793
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:33,440
- Recharge the batteries, sir.
- Mm.

794
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:37,111
So, Charlie, how'd you
know about the scrapers?

795
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:40,748
I didn't. I mean, not until
I saw it from the chopper.

796
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:42,783
Something just went
off in my brain.

797
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:44,327
It all made sense after
seeing it from the sky.

798
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:45,719
( glasses clink )

799
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:46,954
Well, it was a hell of a move.

800
00:44:46,987 --> 00:44:48,989
Mm-hmm. Hell of
a move, Charlie.

801
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,193
Something tells me you're the
boys in charge around here.

802
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:55,796
What makes you say that?

803
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:58,265
Well, for starters,
you're not wearing beads,

804
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:00,801
this is the best
table in the place,

805
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:03,337
and you're drinking
$40 scotch whiskey.

806
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:07,808
- You got a good eye.
- I'm Peggy.

807
00:45:07,841 --> 00:45:09,910
This is Mary. Can we sit?

808
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:13,147
Ah... oh, please. Please.

809
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,883
Charlie, do you mind getting
the ladies some drinks?

810
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:18,886
Hey, after all, this
is your affair, right?

811
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:21,155
What's your poison?

812
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:23,924
I'll have a vodka martini,
extra dirty, three olives.

813
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:25,492
And I'll take the same.

814
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:29,296
Charlie, thank you.
That'll be all.

815
00:45:31,533 --> 00:45:34,802
Oh, this is, uh... this is nice.

816
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:37,137
Peggy: Thank you.

817
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:41,342
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, can I get two extra dirty vodka martinis, please?

818
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,344
- Did you hear that shit?
- Man, let it go.

819
00:45:43,377 --> 00:45:45,346
Like a house nigger.

820
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:48,015
Stop it, Charlie.
Come on, relax.

821
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:50,017
Man, they just treated
me like the help.

822
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,852
Came too easy for them, too.

823
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:53,287
One minute I'm
rookie of the year,

824
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,856
next minute I'm folding
their sweaty jock straps.

825
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:58,225
"Have the colored
boy get some drinks."

826
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:01,862
Come on, relax. I'll
take the drinks over.

827
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:05,032
It's okay. I've been kissing
asses like theirs for 10 years.

828
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:07,234
Man, fuck that. And fuck them,
too. I'm outta here, man.

829
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:09,270
- Hey, Charlie.
- Ah!

830
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:13,207
So, now that we've gotten rid of the
support staff, what do you boys do?

831
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,512
- Well, uh...
- I'm a pilot.

832
00:46:17,545 --> 00:46:19,013
- Really?

833
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:21,048
- I'm a tennis pro.
- Oh.

834
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:22,383
Well, actually
I'm an instructor.

835
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,251
They just call us
pros at the club.

836
00:46:30,858 --> 00:46:32,393
Oh, where'd Charlie run off to?

837
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:33,827
Oh, we got a big day tomorrow

838
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:34,971
so he's calling
it an early night.

839
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:36,063
Oh, what a good idea.

840
00:46:36,096 --> 00:46:37,264
Good night, Dan.

841
00:46:37,298 --> 00:46:40,234
( giggles ) How exciting.

842
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:42,436
With jobs like that, what
do you do for excitement?

843
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,539
What do you have in mind?

844
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:46,206
Are you boys staying
in town tonight?

845
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,010
Uh, as a matter of fact, we are.

846
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:52,913
May I humbly propose,

847
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:55,449
perhaps we could escort
you attractive ladies

848
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:57,451
for the duration of your stay?

849
00:46:57,484 --> 00:47:01,255
Such gentlemen.

850
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:03,857
A rare creature these days.

851
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:05,326
Getting rarer by the minute.

852
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:12,534
( grunts )

853
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:13,967
( giggles )

854
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:17,104
( chuckles )

855
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:19,106
Oh.

856
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:21,576
( laughs )

857
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:25,446
- Do you want some?
- Yes.

858
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:27,981
Yes, I do.

859
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:34,855
( gasps, sighs )

860
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:37,525
( growls )

861
00:47:52,473 --> 00:47:57,978
Oh, you don't have to
apologize for anything.

862
00:47:58,011 --> 00:47:59,279
Oh.

863
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:04,385
Oh!

864
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:20,501
Hey, Red, what
brings you out here?

865
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:23,505
- Paddle scrapers.
- Excuse me?

866
00:48:23,538 --> 00:48:25,649
Look, Dan, I don't need a bunch
of horseshit from you today.

867
00:48:25,673 --> 00:48:28,510
The scrapers are going
back with me, that's that.

868
00:48:28,543 --> 00:48:30,512
- What?
- Hold on a minute.

869
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:32,379
Those belong to Chuck,
and we have a contract,

870
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:34,558
- so you can just turn your ass around and...
- All right, Dan.

871
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:38,018
We can do this the right
way or the wrong way.

872
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:39,521
How do you want to play it?

873
00:48:39,554 --> 00:48:41,355
Sorry, Red, I don't understand.

874
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:43,157
We had a deal with Chuck.

875
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,559
Yeah?

876
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:47,027
Well, Chuck gave
your deal to me.

877
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,633
I'm paying Chuck
now. He's onboard.

878
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:55,670
Pardon me, Dan. Now, I
know you remember me.

879
00:48:55,703 --> 00:48:58,105
If you need something on
this beach, you talk to me.

880
00:48:58,138 --> 00:49:01,041
All right, then.

881
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:04,378
I need you to go get
those two paddle scrapers,

882
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:07,682
put 'em on these load boys, and
give me a holler when you're done.

883
00:49:07,715 --> 00:49:12,052
I'll be here with the fellas, so
why don't you, uh, get to stepping?

884
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:15,189
Well, maybe you didn't hear
me right the first time.

885
00:49:15,222 --> 00:49:18,058
I'm Charlie Walker.
This is my beach.

886
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:19,436
Those are my trucks,
and these are my people,

887
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,704
and you starting to
stink up the place.

888
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:22,196
So I suggest you
and your rugby team

889
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:23,631
find another beach to play on.

890
00:49:23,665 --> 00:49:25,399
Take it easy, Charlie.

891
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:27,735
Dan, if you're not on my side,

892
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:30,404
now's a good time to step aside.

893
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:31,749
I'm with you, Charlie,
just let me handle this.

894
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:33,641
Dan, I said back off.

895
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:37,745
You see that boys?

896
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:41,014
Old Dan Wallace just
took one from the Negro.

897
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:43,217
That's right. Now who's next?

898
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,554
Dan, are you gonna get your
boy under control or not?

899
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:50,257
Sorry, Red. Charlie's the
boss. I listen to him.

900
00:50:03,705 --> 00:50:06,306
Oh, son of a bitch.

901
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:12,680
Let's go, boys.

902
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:17,284
What has this world come to?

903
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:22,256
Charlie: <i>How much
cash do we have?</i>

904
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:23,601
Dan: <i>We have about
30,000 in the safe.</i>

905
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,125
I'll have another
50 tomorrow, though,

906
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:26,628
for local rents and payroll.

907
00:50:26,661 --> 00:50:28,630
I'm gonna need it. All of it.

908
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:31,198
And I need you to get Sharpe on
the line for another fifty today.

909
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:33,133
Hey, don't worry, Charlie.

910
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:35,637
I'll take care of
Red and Sharpe.

911
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,772
Mr. Wallace!

912
00:50:37,805 --> 00:50:40,040
Call for you. It's
Walter Sharpe.

913
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:45,479
I'll talk to Sharpe myself.

914
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:47,481
You just get those
men back on the beach.

915
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:48,716
Okay.

916
00:50:53,253 --> 00:50:55,289
We got another month here.

917
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:57,625
Look, I'm just now getting
ahead of this thing.

918
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:00,494
Sharpe: <i>Are you sure? You seemed
to be on the back end already.</i>

919
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:02,496
I was putting on a
show for Mr. Bennett.

920
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,499
We barely hanging on, like
everybody else. We need more cash.

921
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:07,669
I got payroll, trucks, hippies.

922
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:10,170
<i>I show you took in
50,000 two days ago.</i>

923
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:11,673
<i>How are you burning
so much cash?</i>

924
00:51:11,706 --> 00:51:14,676
Locals, politicians, Sacramento.

925
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:17,144
I got hippies and hillbillies
crawling up my ass,

926
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:18,689
not to mention an
ocean full of your shit

927
00:51:18,713 --> 00:51:20,180
pushing me back at every turn.

928
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:21,516
<i>I'll get you another 50.</i>

929
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:22,850
<i>Have Dan write up some tickets,</i>

930
00:51:22,884 --> 00:51:24,619
<i>invoices, anything to cover it.</i>

931
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:27,321
And keep it coming, or this
whole thing falls apart.

932
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:29,767
Far as I know, we the only beach
that doesn't have any problems,

933
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:31,425
and I'd like to
keep it that way.

934
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,795
By the way, hope you boys
enjoyed your weekend.

935
00:51:33,828 --> 00:51:35,697
- Sorry I had to cut out.
- Hello, miss.

936
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:40,200
- I'm here to see Charlie Walker.
- That's him. Oh, what?

937
00:51:40,233 --> 00:51:42,478
- Hi, sorry. I have Mr. Sharpe now.
- What can I do for you?

938
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:46,206
Question is, what can I do
for you? I'm Charlie Walker.

939
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:48,342
Oh, you're Charlie Walker.

940
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,845
- Over the phone, you didn't sound so...
- Tall? I know.

941
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:53,548
- I get that a lot.
- Hold on one sec. Um... hold on.

942
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:54,925
Charlie, I still
need to talk to you.

943
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:57,719
In a minute. I'll
be right back.

944
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:03,223
So, you build roads?

945
00:52:03,256 --> 00:52:04,726
Yep, if it's a
car in California,

946
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:05,927
it's rolling on one of ours.

947
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,731
Well, we got a lot of oily sand,

948
00:52:09,764 --> 00:52:12,767
if you catch my drift.

949
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,801
We got a deal?

950
00:52:23,544 --> 00:52:25,613
Who was that?

951
00:52:25,647 --> 00:52:26,890
His family built every
freeway, highway,

952
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:28,816
and frontage road
from here to Oregon.

953
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,585
What does he want?

954
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:32,386
He wants what we can't
seem to get rid of.

955
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:34,388
He's buying the
dirty sand from me.

956
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:39,259
You're gonna sell him the
contaminated material.

957
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:40,895
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

958
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:42,897
Hell, that's not
contaminated material,

959
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,541
that's the champagne
of road construction.

960
00:52:44,565 --> 00:52:48,268
And I have enough of it to
get him from here to Alaska.

961
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:49,537
What about Tower Oil?

962
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,906
It is still technically theirs.

963
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:55,610
You think Tower Oil gives a rat's
ass what I do with all that shit?

964
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:59,413
Read the papers. It's
pollution, toxic waste.

965
00:52:59,446 --> 00:53:02,650
The oil is theirs, but the
sand belongs to no one.

966
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:03,918
Be careful, Charlie.

967
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:05,419
They always balance their books.

968
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:08,790
Tower Oil always
balances their books.

969
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:11,959
I dig, but this isn't even on
the radar, let alone the books.

970
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:21,301
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.
- Charlie, Charlie.

971
00:53:21,334 --> 00:53:23,446
- Dan, what the hell are you doing?
- The kid on the beach.

972
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,405
- What kid?
- He got run over. He got run over.

973
00:53:25,439 --> 00:53:26,679
They were playing on the beach.

974
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:29,577
Come on.

975
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,946
Which one of you men was
assigned to that machine?

976
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:34,982
Willie, who was on that loader?

977
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:40,655
- Not me.
- It's mine.

978
00:53:40,688 --> 00:53:42,666
Well, where were you when
all this shit was going down?

979
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,326
I was taking a leak. I wasn't
gone more than half a minute.

980
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:49,964
It takes me a full minute just to get
my zipper down and my johnson out.

981
00:53:49,997 --> 00:53:52,475
You telling me you left that thing
running with all these civilians around?

982
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:56,436
We do it every day. Well, you've
been on the job site before.

983
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:00,775
You can't just shut these things
on and off like a sports car.

984
00:54:00,808 --> 00:54:04,045
- You're fired.
- You can't do that.

985
00:54:04,078 --> 00:54:06,547
Since when is it not okay for
a boss to fire a subordinate?

986
00:54:06,581 --> 00:54:08,750
- Chuck is my boss.
- Well, tell him,

987
00:54:08,783 --> 00:54:10,685
"Charlie Walker
fired my dumb ass

988
00:54:10,718 --> 00:54:11,995
'cause I left my rig
running long enough

989
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:13,921
to run over the top
of some civilian."

990
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:18,492
This is bullshit. The boys at Tower
were right about letting you in.

991
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:20,260
You just used up 20 seconds.

992
00:54:21,028 --> 00:54:25,365
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

993
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:31,506
All right, everybody.
The boy's okay.

994
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,641
Everybody just go back to
doing what they were doing.

995
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:41,883
Did you find his folks?

996
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:44,619
Yes, uh, they're gonna
follow the ambulance.

997
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:49,389
- How'd they take it?
- Five grand for now,

998
00:54:49,422 --> 00:54:51,893
maybe 10 by the time
they get to the hospital.

999
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:53,326
How do you want me to bill this?

1000
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,395
Like everything else.

1001
00:54:55,428 --> 00:54:57,031
Add it to the volunteers.

1002
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:59,066
See if 10 grand helps him
explain to the hospital

1003
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,536
how he fell off one
of those skateboards.

1004
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:03,403
Got it.

1005
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:05,907
Hey, if this never
leaves the beach,

1006
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,407
we'll all be better off.

1007
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,411
- Agreed.
- I'll catch you later.

1008
00:55:11,444 --> 00:55:13,548
Hey, I need to talk
to you for a minute.

1009
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:19,486
Walter Sharpe came by. Took
all the books, everything.

1010
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,823
- When?
- Two hours ago, after you left.

1011
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:23,758
I called over to Ocean
Beach and Half Moon Bay,

1012
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:25,368
and none of their books
have been touched.

1013
00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:26,761
That's no problem.

1014
00:55:26,794 --> 00:55:28,138
He's probably just
starting with us.

1015
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:30,565
There's one more thing.

1016
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:33,000
I heard him on the
phone talking about you.

1017
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:35,636
How do you know he
was talking about me?

1018
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,839
I don't want to say.

1019
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:42,944
That n-word.

1020
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:45,445
- Oh.
- Okay? He was really mad.

1021
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:47,380
I don't think he knew
I was in the bathroom.

1022
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:50,017
How do you know he
was talking about me?

1023
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:53,988
Are you... ( laughs )

1024
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:57,592
I'm kidding. Hey, Fran, look.

1025
00:55:57,625 --> 00:56:00,962
I appreciate you telling
me this. I really do.

1026
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:03,463
But don't you worry
yourself, okay?

1027
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:05,566
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1028
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,536
I don't... you're not
gonna get fired, are you?

1029
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:12,874
Fran, I've never been fired
from a job in my life.

1030
00:56:25,853 --> 00:56:27,631
Say, man, why the hell
ain't you on the beach?

1031
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:31,125
- It's 9 AM.
- Charlie, they let me go.

1032
00:56:31,158 --> 00:56:35,830
- Who let me go?
- That man in there.

1033
00:56:35,863 --> 00:56:37,531
Wait here. Don't leave.

1034
00:56:40,668 --> 00:56:44,105
Say, Walter, why'd you let
that man go? He works for me.

1035
00:56:44,138 --> 00:56:48,009
And you work for me, and
that makes him my problem.

1036
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:51,145
What's the problem?

1037
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:54,649
First of all, sit down.
Stop yelling at me.

1038
00:56:54,682 --> 00:56:57,585
I mean, unless that is you've already
forgotten the chain of command here.

1039
00:56:57,618 --> 00:57:00,154
This about that damn redneck?

1040
00:57:00,187 --> 00:57:02,790
Or that knucklehead
I had to fire?

1041
00:57:02,823 --> 00:57:05,026
Did you know Mr. Willie Jones

1042
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:07,528
doesn't even carry a
valid Class B license?

1043
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:09,864
In fact, he just admitted to us

1044
00:57:09,897 --> 00:57:12,033
he never even had
a Class B license.

1045
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:14,168
We could be fined, shut down.

1046
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:17,705
He's been driving for
me almost two years.

1047
00:57:17,738 --> 00:57:19,941
He can run circles around
any of those good old boys.

1048
00:57:19,974 --> 00:57:23,044
Two agents from the
Labor Department,

1049
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:25,179
they visited our corporate
headquarters yesterday.

1050
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:27,815
You know, they found over
60 unpaid volunteers.

1051
00:57:27,848 --> 00:57:30,885
Now, hold on, those
boys aren't even legit.

1052
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:33,054
Somebody's trying to
muscle in on this job.

1053
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:35,056
Since when do a couple
Sacramento pencil-pushers

1054
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:37,191
carry pearl-handled six
shooters in their sock?

1055
00:57:37,224 --> 00:57:38,759
Those boys are
private contractors.

1056
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:41,562
Is it true a child was
injured by one of your crew

1057
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:43,173
and sent to the hospital
without a report?

1058
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:44,899
That's the son of a
bitch I fired, damn it.

1059
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:48,069
- I took care of him.
- Tower Oil can be sued.

1060
00:57:48,102 --> 00:57:50,738
Oh, and in public, I
mean, in the newspapers...

1061
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:53,541
I mean, do you have any
idea what I'm saying?

1062
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:55,977
You're trying to squeeze me out.

1063
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,554
I'll put in a good
word for you, Charlie.

1064
00:57:57,578 --> 00:57:58,546
No, I like you.

1065
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:01,215
But I can't promise
anything at this point.

1066
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:02,917
You made your bed.

1067
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,052
Thanks for looking
out for me, Walter.

1068
00:58:05,086 --> 00:58:07,922
I won't forget the favor.

1069
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:13,194
Ann: <i>Charlie knew he'd taken
things as far as he could.</i>

1070
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:14,929
<i>It was only a matter of time</i>

1071
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:17,932
<i>before Tower Oil pushed him out.</i>

1072
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:21,635
Charlie, did you straighten
things out for me?

1073
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:28,609
Yeah, we're square.
Everything's cool.

1074
00:58:28,642 --> 00:58:33,014
Great. So, I can get
back up on my scraper?

1075
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:36,951
No, Willie, go home.

1076
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:40,121
Spend some time with the boys.

1077
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:42,023
Take the wife out
to a nice dinner.

1078
00:58:55,169 --> 00:58:56,170
Hello?

1079
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:59,573
We miss you.

1080
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:01,575
Is the house locked up?

1081
00:59:01,609 --> 00:59:03,044
We're fine.

1082
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:06,647
I'll be home tomorrow.

1083
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,650
- How long can you stay?
- I'll be home for good.

1084
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:11,652
Did you finish the job already?

1085
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:13,363
I thought this was going
to last for months.

1086
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:17,992
No, baby, it's a
short-term thing.

1087
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:20,161
I got paid, now it's
time to pack up.

1088
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:24,765
- Are you happy?
- I'll be happy tomorrow.

1089
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:29,103
You sound different. Is
everything all right?

1090
00:59:31,172 --> 00:59:35,242
Yeah. You know what?
Everything's fine, baby.

1091
00:59:36,844 --> 00:59:40,614
Everything's fine.
Remember, we rich.

1092
00:59:40,648 --> 00:59:45,086
- I can't wait to see you.
- Me too.

1093
00:59:48,689 --> 00:59:50,091
Bye.

1094
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,869
Real pretty out
here in the morning.

1095
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:04,038
Only time I don't
mind being alone.

1096
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:05,873
You know what I mean?

1097
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:08,809
I knocked on your door for
15 minutes this morning.

1098
01:00:08,843 --> 01:00:11,212
TV must've been on.

1099
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:13,180
Must've been.

1100
01:00:15,082 --> 01:00:17,718
You come out here to take
credit for my work, Chuck?

1101
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:21,055
- It's not like that, Charlie.
- Come on.

1102
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:23,100
I knew you couldn't sit back
and let a nigger show you up.

1103
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:27,261
That's your word, not mine.

1104
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:30,064
You right.

1105
01:00:30,097 --> 01:00:32,066
That's why I always
liked you, Chuck.

1106
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:34,368
You're not like the
rest of those boys.

1107
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:37,371
You put your shit out
front for everybody to see.

1108
01:00:37,404 --> 01:00:40,908
Them other boys'll lie
right to your face.

1109
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:43,244
You know, my beach would
look like this right now

1110
01:00:43,277 --> 01:00:45,246
if it weren't for
those goddamn rocks.

1111
01:00:45,279 --> 01:00:47,915
You got lucky, Charlie.

1112
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:53,254
Paddle scrapers don't work at
Ocean Beach. You got lucky.

1113
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:55,089
Thank you, Chuck.

1114
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:56,299
Nothing like a little dumb luck

1115
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:57,958
to make up for
gross incompetence.

1116
01:00:57,992 --> 01:01:00,928
That's not what I
mean and you know it.

1117
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:02,405
I'm just saying that
the paddle scrapers

1118
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:05,766
don't work anywhere
else but here.

1119
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:09,770
We're still mopping shit
up by hand in the city,

1120
01:01:09,803 --> 01:01:13,407
polishing rocks one
at a goddamn time.

1121
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,176
Just unlucky, I guess.

1122
01:01:17,745 --> 01:01:18,779
It's over.

1123
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:23,284
I know.

1124
01:01:23,317 --> 01:01:25,786
You'll get paid for your
truck up until today.

1125
01:01:25,819 --> 01:01:27,955
I don't need it anymore.

1126
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:30,958
Well, me either.

1127
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:33,394
You're just too flashy, Charlie.

1128
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:38,799
You know, TV cameras and
making nice with the locals,

1129
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:41,302
getting in the newspapers,
that's not what we do.

1130
01:01:41,335 --> 01:01:45,839
We get in, we get dirty,
and we get out, period.

1131
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:48,442
( scoffs ) You'd
make a better mayor.

1132
01:01:48,475 --> 01:01:51,145
So y'all gonna take
credit for all my work.

1133
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:53,981
What about the 20% off the top?

1134
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,984
You know, you can
keep your credit.

1135
01:01:57,017 --> 01:02:00,321
I'm only gonna be here long
enough to load up the tents,

1136
01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:02,823
pack up the station wagon.

1137
01:02:02,856 --> 01:02:06,460
Oh, and you can take your news crew
with you, too. I can't use 'em.

1138
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:10,331
Maybe I will become mayor,
make your life a living hell.

1139
01:02:10,364 --> 01:02:11,899
You'll have to pay
me off, you know?

1140
01:02:11,932 --> 01:02:13,867
Shock me.

1141
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:17,738
Made you boys look
pretty stupid, huh?

1142
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:24,011
The safe is empty. You
know anything about that?

1143
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:27,848
My car's missing.

1144
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:29,950
You think your boys saw
anything suspicious?

1145
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:34,154
Maybe we both got
robbed last night.

1146
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,891
Maybe.

1147
01:02:43,897 --> 01:02:46,500
There's no sign outside. It's
in the middle of the block.

1148
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:49,069
Tower Oil Headquarters.

1149
01:02:49,103 --> 01:02:51,038
Say, my man, ain't you the cat

1150
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:52,840
that spilled all
that oil in the bay?

1151
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:55,876
- What?
- Yeah, I've seen you on TV.

1152
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:57,378
You fucked up everything.

1153
01:02:57,411 --> 01:02:59,146
Nah, man, I'm the
guy who cleaned it.

1154
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:01,415
You bet your ass you should
be cleaning that mess up.

1155
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:04,251
- What you talking about, old man?
- It ain't right,

1156
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:07,888
- we gotta be paying for that foul-up for decades.
- Oil company's paying.

1157
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:10,891
( laughs ) You been on
a boat too long, son.

1158
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:12,893
It's messed up your thinking.

1159
01:03:12,926 --> 01:03:16,363
You think gasoline is gonna stay
at 36 cents a gallon forever?

1160
01:03:16,397 --> 01:03:19,900
I told you, old man, I
wasn't on a damn boat.

1161
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:23,070
Pull over here behind this
truck. I want you to wait for me.

1162
01:03:26,373 --> 01:03:29,076
Here you go, Tom Jefferson,

1163
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:33,247
license number 652256.

1164
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,549
Leave the meter running.

1165
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:36,417
You drive around the
block if you have to,

1166
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,419
but I want you right
here when I get back.

1167
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,106
- Hold it right there.
- ( grunts )

1168
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,343
( elevator dings )

1169
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:07,582
Fuck. ( panting )

1170
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:09,426
I catch either one of you
motherfuckers in my home again,

1171
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,984
I'll kill you without a sound.

1172
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:23,163
Sir, you can't go in there.

1173
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,533
Watch me.

1174
01:04:27,669 --> 01:04:30,037
- ( beeping )
- 18th floor.

1175
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:33,140
- 18th floor, now.
- Charlie!

1176
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:36,477
- You surprised me.
- That was my intention.

1177
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:41,014
I don't get a lot of visitors
up here. Please, sit down.

1178
01:04:46,253 --> 01:04:47,488
I'll make this brief.

1179
01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:50,491
I think that's probably best.

1180
01:04:50,525 --> 01:04:55,095
- $375,000.
- Come again?

1181
01:04:55,129 --> 01:05:01,168
You owe me $375,000 for my trucks
and my pay. That's up to today.

1182
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:05,507
Is that what you're here for?
To go over your invoices?

1183
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,642
You'll get paid
like everyone else.

1184
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:12,045
375,000.

1185
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,685
If my information is correct,

1186
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:22,156
that's almost
exactly to the dollar

1187
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:26,528
the amount of the moneys unaccounted
for on your balance sheet.

1188
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:31,031
Oh, my goodness. Almost
$400,000, Charlie.

1189
01:05:31,064 --> 01:05:35,369
That's a... that's a lot of
money to be unaccounted for.

1190
01:05:35,402 --> 01:05:39,373
It's already accounted
for. That's why I'm here.

1191
01:05:39,406 --> 01:05:43,043
We're even. It's over.

1192
01:05:43,076 --> 01:05:45,547
I walk away and
you don't get up.

1193
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,383
- Deal?
- ( chuckles )

1194
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:51,185
We're at an impasse.

1195
01:05:51,218 --> 01:05:54,556
That's not how we do
business here at Tower Oil.

1196
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:59,159
You can't be paid until
the books are balanced.

1197
01:05:59,193 --> 01:06:02,564
I don't want you to pay
me. I'm already paid.

1198
01:06:02,597 --> 01:06:04,532
And why would you go and
say something like that?

1199
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:09,069
Because you and I both know
the fix was in from the start.

1200
01:06:09,102 --> 01:06:11,972
You sent those boys to
my home and to my beach.

1201
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,677
I figured your shit
out on the second day.

1202
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:18,713
You might want to
read over that again.

1203
01:06:18,746 --> 01:06:21,583
You only work for us when
we say you work for us.

1204
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:25,587
That doesn't include entertaining
the local civic leaders,

1205
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:29,323
television appearances,
cocaine parties.

1206
01:06:29,356 --> 01:06:31,325
You really wanna go there?

1207
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:33,728
You're stealing
from us, Charlie.

1208
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:36,463
You get away with that,
you'd be the first.

1209
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:40,234
See, that's my thing.

1210
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:43,671
Going where no Black man
has ever gone before.

1211
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:50,444
( sighs ) That's
a lot of money.

1212
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:52,179
Money is no object.

1213
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:55,449
Oh, shit, Charlie. That
wasn't meant literally.

1214
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:58,786
When I told you I'd clean up that
beach, it wasn't metaphorical.

1215
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:02,089
You bought yourself
a convertible.

1216
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:04,626
You signed fraudulent invoices.

1217
01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:07,629
You had unlicensed contractors.

1218
01:07:07,662 --> 01:07:10,632
You paid off an injured minor's
family, for Christ's sake.

1219
01:07:10,665 --> 01:07:13,701
Come on, Charlie,
you can't be serious.

1220
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:15,135
I bought that car
with my own money

1221
01:07:15,168 --> 01:07:17,271
I made on the side from Santini,

1222
01:07:17,304 --> 01:07:19,483
and that kid would've been a
lawsuit 10 times what I paid him.

1223
01:07:19,507 --> 01:07:24,646
We don't use words like
"on the side" here.

1224
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:27,615
It's colorful language,
but we just don't use it.

1225
01:07:27,649 --> 01:07:29,817
Colorful?

1226
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:33,487
Look at you in your suit.

1227
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:38,158
You actually think you could run
this company if given a chance.

1228
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:41,061
You fascinate me, Charlie.

1229
01:07:44,532 --> 01:07:47,301
It's like you're the
only one in the room

1230
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:49,604
who doesn't know you're Black.

1231
01:07:51,873 --> 01:07:55,175
It's my job to think
outside of the box.

1232
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:58,513
It's my job to smooth
over the locals.

1233
01:07:58,546 --> 01:08:00,682
And most of all, it's my job

1234
01:08:00,715 --> 01:08:04,519
to spend Tower Oil's
money how I see fit,

1235
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:07,387
from payroll to toilet paper.

1236
01:08:09,691 --> 01:08:12,827
I guess you're right.

1237
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,596
I never thought
about it like that.

1238
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:19,701
I admit, 300 years
of forced servitude

1239
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:21,703
and another hundred
years of nonsense

1240
01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:25,339
tends to slip my mind
every once in a while.

1241
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:29,343
Now and again, I'm reminded the only reason
a guy like you is here on the 18th floor

1242
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:34,549
and I'm out of a job again
is because you're privileged.

1243
01:08:34,582 --> 01:08:39,252
It's not because I'm Black,
but more because you're white.

1244
01:08:41,355 --> 01:08:43,791
People like you
inherit your lives,

1245
01:08:43,825 --> 01:08:47,829
your wealth, your good fortune.

1246
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:49,664
You grew up knowing
your only job

1247
01:08:49,697 --> 01:08:52,432
is not to fuck up what
generations before you had.

1248
01:08:58,773 --> 01:09:00,575
Are you okay, Mr. Bennett?

1249
01:09:00,608 --> 01:09:03,143
Oh, yes, I feel very protected.

1250
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:06,814
( sighs ) Charlie
was just leaving.

1251
01:09:12,754 --> 01:09:15,288
Hmm. Now, that's pretty.

1252
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:21,261
Smells like, I don't know.

1253
01:09:21,294 --> 01:09:25,298
Smells a little
like... freedom.

1254
01:09:29,436 --> 01:09:31,414
See, until we get this whole
entitlement shit worked out,

1255
01:09:31,438 --> 01:09:33,273
a Black man will never
trust a white man

1256
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:35,910
any more than a white man
can trust a Black man.

1257
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:39,847
- It's balance of powers.
- You sent her.

1258
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:43,618
Well, actually, my
associate Jerry sent her.

1259
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:49,657
- I just picked her out.
- You think you got me.

1260
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:51,993
Oh, I do got you.

1261
01:09:52,026 --> 01:09:55,930
The second that work order touched my
Black hand at Long Wharf, I had you.

1262
01:09:55,963 --> 01:09:58,307
Which is probably a half a day's
head start over you and your boys

1263
01:09:58,331 --> 01:10:00,300
starting that little file on me.

1264
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:02,870
But, hey, we call it a tie.

1265
01:10:05,606 --> 01:10:08,976
<i>( music playing )</i>

1266
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,645

1270
01:10:35,502 --> 01:10:38,472
You know, there was this old
dude in the projects. Doc.

1271
01:10:38,506 --> 01:10:42,043
Everybody called him Doc 'cause he
was always dispensing advice and shit,

1272
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:43,978
like a psychologist.

1273
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:47,682
Something he always said to me
keeps running through my head.

1274
01:10:47,715 --> 01:10:51,853
He says to me, "Charlie, how
many rednecks does it take

1275
01:10:51,886 --> 01:10:55,455
to push a pregnant Black woman
down a flight of stairs?"

1276
01:10:55,489 --> 01:10:57,692
I say, "I don't know."

1277
01:10:57,725 --> 01:11:01,696
Mainly 'cause I was shocked at the
thought of something so repulsive.

1278
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:06,667
He says to me,
"None. She slipped."

1279
01:11:09,402 --> 01:11:10,772
She slipped.

1280
01:11:20,615 --> 01:11:22,984
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1281
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:28,388
Mr. Walker, your
employment with Tower Oil

1282
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:30,825
is hereby terminated.

1283
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,295
Let him go.

1284
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:46,908
A guy like that,

1285
01:11:46,941 --> 01:11:50,545
give him enough rope,
he'll hang himself.

1286
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:53,346
Get outta here.

1287
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,448

Some clothes, I think.

I wasn't looking for no job.

I went to the top of that building
