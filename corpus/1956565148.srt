00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,799
This is Mike Whistlock
for Cable News Channel

2
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,734
with breaking news from the Balkans.

3
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:35,770
We just heard that a U.N. helicopter

4
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,240
bearing captured Serbian
general Ratko Gravic,

5
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:40,308
a war criminal accused of masterminding

6
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:42,744
the bloody ethnic cleansing
campaigns in Kosovo,

7
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:46,348
is descending towards the
mountainous village of Inkonyika.

8
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:42,339
Gravic, who's been in United
Nations custody for two months,

9
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:43,674
will be returned to his homeland

10
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:46,376
in exchange for the 10
American seismologists

11
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,546
bound for the Black Sea
whose plane was forced to land

12
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,519
by Serbian fighter pilots when it
unknowingly crossed into Yugoslav airspace.

13
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:06,464
It's an extremely controversial
move, but the U.N. is optimistic

14
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:08,633
that Gravic will
eventually be recaptured.

15
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,302
We will continue to update
you on this amazing story

16
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:13,538
as more details become available.

17
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,452
I can sense it, Walter.

18
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:28,721
Those bastards aren't gonna let us go.

19
00:02:28,754 --> 00:02:30,322
Take it easy, Harry.

20
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,356
It's gonna be all right.

21
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:46,773
Helicopter approaching. Over.

22
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:04,291
In a few moments, my friends,

23
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:10,431
you... will help General Gravic and I

24
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,702
demonstrate to the world

25
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:17,672
that Yugoslavia will let no nation,

26
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:20,775
not even the United States of America,

27
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:24,045
interfere with its destiny.

28
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,747
I don't want to die!

29
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:28,781
Fuck you...

30
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,745
We just got word that
Gravic and his U.N. escorts

31
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,817
are approaching General Kisimir Nabizsa,
who himself is wanted by the U.N.

32
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,687
for perpetrating atrocities
in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina,

33
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:09,325
and behind Nabizsa are Dr. Walter Hill
and the members of the ill-fated.

34
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,895
Black Sea expedition, who may not
even know that their harrowing ordeal

35
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:14,929
may momentarily be over.

36
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:41,056
Shoot.

37
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:45,796
Run!

38
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,907
We've just been informed
that shots have been fired.

39
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:50,835
I repeat, shots have been fired.

40
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:14,827
Bummer.

41
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,701
Come on!

42
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:24,804
179 yards. Piece of cake.

43
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:30,174
Fuck.

44
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:38,985
Get to the back of the room.

45
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,723
Peters, take the window.

46
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,124
It's okay.

47
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:45,892
I need you to listen to me.

48
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,060
Listen to him.

49
00:05:47,094 --> 00:05:48,428
Let's just stay calm.

50
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:49,696
I need you to do as I say,

51
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,731
and I'll get you home.

52
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:52,764
Now stay out of the way.

53
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:13,121
Gravic should go down, Cap.

54
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:15,690
Easy, Mac. That's not in the game plan.

55
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,692
But the game plan
didn't take into account

56
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:19,761
that the scumbag would
pull a double cross.

57
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:23,231
We've got our orders, Mac.

58
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:40,182
Gravic, U.S. special forces.

59
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:42,751
Come out with your hands up.

60
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:49,725
Cap, I got a visual on
those reinforcements.

61
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:51,226
At least 20 on the way.

62
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,797
Acknowledged. Listen up.

63
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,108
AWACS just picked up Serb
reinforcements heading our way.

64
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:58,835
Let's wrap this son of a bitch up.

65
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,842
Gravic!

66
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:06,843
Gravic!

67
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,745
Right behind you, Cap.

68
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:10,213
Hutch, you go out back, cover the exits.

69
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:12,246
You got it, boss.

70
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,651
Gravic!

71
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:24,793
Jesus.

72
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,630
Damn it.

73
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,069
Stay with me. Stay with me.

74
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,574
Fuck.

75
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:38,607
Cap.

76
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,945
Peters is gone.

77
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:42,978
Acknowledged, Doc.

78
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:47,853
Vickers, outbuilding A.

79
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:49,588
Give Doc a hand ASAP.

80
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,621
Gravic!

81
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:54,824
Cap.

82
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:01,097
Fuck!

83
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:04,102
Motherfucker!

84
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,638
Doc, Doc, I'm on my way.

85
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,208
Gravic.

86
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:14,647
The way these assholes
are pissing away ammo,

87
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
they'll be out in no time.

88
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:21,020
Fucker!

89
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:23,053
How you doing, old man?

90
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:30,863
Mac.

91
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,897
Cover me.

92
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,430
Stay there, Gravic.

93
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:22,448
Mac!

94
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,719
Mac!

95
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,692
He drew down on you, sir.

96
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:31,725
It was empty. You knew that.

97
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,761
No, sir, I did not, sir!

98
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:42,972
Doc, you got one out on the street.

99
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:44,239
Yeah, I see her.

100
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:46,273
Get these people out of here.

101
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:55,885
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

102
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,454
Let's get him out of here.

103
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:59,723
Yes, sir.

104
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,194
All right, folks, make it quick.

105
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:05,362
Make it low.

106
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,395
Ready? Go!

107
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:11,366
Come on!

108
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:16,474
Stay back!

109
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:18,507
Wait! Wait!

110
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:21,846
How about a grenade?

111
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,879
Cover me.

112
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:26,484
Hold on.

113
00:10:26,517 --> 00:10:28,419
Okay.

114
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:32,123
Come on. Come on. Go, go, go!

115
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:36,794
Come on. Go! Go! Go! Go! Move!

116
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,936
I'm gonna help you, okay?

117
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,272
Come on. Come on. You got to get up.

118
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:49,741
Come on. Come on. Come on.

119
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:19,837
Get those people on that chopper.

120
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:30,918
Go! Go!

121
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:02,849
Captain.

122
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:04,486
Captain.

123
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,087
I'm Dr. Hill.

124
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:08,156
I know who you are, sir.
Nice to meet you.

125
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:10,558
I want to thank you on
behalf of my people.

126
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:12,560
You're welcome. Everybody all right?

127
00:12:12,594 --> 00:12:15,864
They're alive. They'll be fine.

128
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:29,211
What happened back there, Sergeant?

129
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:32,014
Nothing. Why, sir?

130
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:38,087
What's going on? Straight up.

131
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,860
I already told you what
happened, Captain.

132
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:44,628
I don't get it.

133
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:46,661
You don't get what?

134
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:50,901
What difference does it make anyway, sir?

135
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:54,037
If ever there was a piece of shit

136
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,040
that deserved to be smoked...

137
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:59,073
it was him.

138
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,985
Welcome to Turkmenistan, Mr. Garcia.

139
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:41,954
I am Boris Vasilev.

140
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,423
It's a pleasure to meet you.

141
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,456
Nikolai...

142
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,961
Vasilev...

143
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,101
You cannot fail me on this.

144
00:13:56,134 --> 00:14:00,974
The most important thing is to obtain
the plutonium and bring it to me.

145
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,309
Is that understood?

146
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,444
Yes.

147
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,477
Good.

148
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,191
So what's your problem, Mac?

149
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,661
When are you gonna drop it, Cap?

150
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,496
Look, when I was a kid,

151
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,300
me and buddy of mine,
we fell down a storm drain.

152
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:34,708
I remember when I was falling like
that, it was dark.

153
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:40,114
Feeling like there's this
endless, boundless abyss.

154
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,682
And?

155
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,686
Weird thing was, Mac, I loved it.

156
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,988
I loved it.

157
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:51,559
The adrenaline rush.

158
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:54,229
I wasn't afraid, Mac.

159
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:57,397
That's your problem.

160
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,302
You're not afraid anymore.

161
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,274
And what if you are right?

162
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:08,243
Fear is your armor, Mac.

163
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:10,078
That's what's gonna keep you alive.

164
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:12,380
Fuck it, that's what keeps us all alive.

165
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:14,483
You lose it, who knows what happens.

166
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:17,753
Maybe I have a little crack in my armor.

167
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,792
Listen, I'm worried about it.

168
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:24,825
Look.

169
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:29,163
I'm a soldier.

170
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,768
If I fall out there...

171
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,470
I will make sure that I don't take.

172
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:40,277
Doc, Hutch, Vickers,
or yourself with me, sir.

173
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,579
Man, Cap's got to get off Mac

174
00:15:42,612 --> 00:15:44,047
about that shit already.

175
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:46,416
Mac screwed up, Vicks.

176
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,485
I'm gonna be watching you, Mac.

177
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:50,787
Keep the fear.

178
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:52,756
I know.

179
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,789
Keep the fear.

180
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,228
Let's play.

181
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,064
Missed my target.

182
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,700
179 yards and I blow a window out.

183
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:05,770
Come on, man,
don't worry about that shit.

184
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:08,306
Hey, don't sugarcoat it, all right?

185
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,807
Think I'm on my way out, Vicks.

186
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:12,076
No, no. Shut the fuck up, man.

187
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,544
You're the best I've ever
seen, all right?

188
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:15,578
So don't even start with that.

189
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,818
I do know what you're talking
about though in a way.

190
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:22,852
Let me show you something.

191
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:26,824
What is that? Muscle spasms?

192
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:29,060
It's a fucking hangover.

193
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,698
I tell you, Hutch, man,
I thought I could party,

194
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:35,434
but Suzanne is at a different level, bro.

195
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:39,304
Last week we're in Maui
and you know it was on.

196
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:43,475
Only bull in the barn. That must be nice.

197
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:46,712
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:48,614
Know what? You're pretty lucky.

199
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:51,817
You got a girl waiting for
you when you come home.

200
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,321
I'll tell you what.

201
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:58,892
The day you quit is the day I quit.

202
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:01,728
Grab a couple drafts back at the
COMMS, what do you say?

203
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:04,464
Nope.

204
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,599
Might as well bury me
right next to my papa.

205
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:09,102
It's the only thing I know, Vicks.

206
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:17,341
It's the only thing we know.

207
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,381
Walter.

208
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:55,415
Walter!

209
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,286
Yeah?

210
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
I don't believe it.

211
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,958
Tim.

212
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:08,730
Go and get the records from the
last few episodes, would you?

213
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:19,575
This isn't right.

214
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:23,246
They're the same.

215
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,448
It's not natural.

216
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,418
We have to go public with this.

217
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:31,854
But Walter,

218
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:35,893
the confidentiality agreement
you signed during Zeus.

219
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:37,728
You can't go public.

220
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,296
Think of the repercussions.

221
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,398
The hell with the repercussions.

222
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:43,333
With tens of thousands of lives at stake,

223
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,402
I'm supposed to stay silent?

224
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:54,042
But what if you're wrong?

225
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:03,488
You know, Tim...

226
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,521
for once I hope I am wrong.

227
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:08,860
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

228
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:12,964
It's a restless planet we live on.

229
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,867
Constantly in motion.

230
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,702
Slowly but inexorably

231
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:20,338
shaping and reshaping itself.

232
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,507
By and large, these changes...

233
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,877
go by unnoticed.

234
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,646
However, occasionally they can be

235
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,682
sudden and quite dramatic.

236
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:33,752
Witness Kobe, Northridge, Loma Prieta.

237
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:35,521
Seismologically speaking,

238
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:37,923
the northern section of
the San Andreas Fault

239
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:41,727
has been quiet since 1989.

240
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,829
Until this week, that is.

241
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:46,765
Normally, quakes of such minor magnitude

242
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,801
don't justify a press conference.

243
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,338
However, in analyzing the data

244
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:52,939
generated by these quakes,

245
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:55,742
my assistant Dr. Timothy Samuels and I

246
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,510
have come to a startling

247
00:19:57,544 --> 00:20:00,347
and rather disturbing conclusion.

248
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,883
Now, I realize that by making
this information public

249
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:07,020
I put at risk my reputation,

250
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:10,757
my freedom, and quite possibly my life.

251
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,626
However, as a scientist

252
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:15,463
I feel it is my moral obligation to do so

253
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:18,766
regardless of the consequences.

254
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,736
Now, this, as we all know too well,

255
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:23,571
is the San Andreas Fault,

256
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:26,874
a lengthy fissure running
along the convergence zone

257
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:30,011
of the Pacific and North American plates.

258
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:33,814
Now, these two plates
move past each other

259
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:36,951
at a rate of approximately
two inches per year.

260
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:38,819
Now, in the past we have seen

261
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:42,658
that a sudden movement
along the San Andreas

262
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,127
can produce a significant seismic event,

263
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,928
which for our purposes today

264
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:49,831
we will define as an episode

265
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:52,734
of eight or greater on the Richter scale.

266
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,903
Now, in keeping with
the theoretical model

267
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,873
that I helped to create in the 1980s,

268
00:20:57,906 --> 00:21:00,809
the data generated by
this week's two tremblers

269
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,679
would indicate that the
31st state of America

270
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,712
may soon experience a...

271
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:33,699
Cease fire!

272
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:40,876
Doc, Mac, nice job.

273
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:43,812
Vickers you're a little
slow in sector four.

274
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:46,548
Hutch, you missed a target in seven.

275
00:23:46,582 --> 00:23:47,983
Where's fucking McKinney?

276
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:48,984
Stand down, soldier.

277
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:49,985
It's a fucking drill, McKinney!

278
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:52,554
Stand down, soldier!

279
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:56,959
What's this all about, Sergeant?

280
00:23:56,992 --> 00:23:58,160
He's upset, sir,

281
00:23:58,193 --> 00:24:00,964
because he went down so fast.

282
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:04,267
Jackson,

283
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,970
team three, thanks a lot.

284
00:24:07,003 --> 00:24:07,937
No problem, Captain.

285
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:10,707
But the next time,
we get to be the good guys.

286
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,740
You got it.

287
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,645
Think we got time for another.

288
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:17,847
No time for practice.

289
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:19,883
Looks like it's game time.

290
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,853
The man on the right is Boris Vaseliv.

291
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:27,992
He's the Russian Mafia's
top banana in Turkmenistan.

292
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:30,694
Shaking hands with him
is Dr. Olivio Garcia,

293
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:33,931
a Cuban-American nuclear engineer.

294
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:38,002
He was on the payroll of the
Department of Defense until 1989,

295
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:39,703
when the top-secret project

296
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:41,038
he was working on was scrapped.

297
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:42,973
What was the project, sir?

298
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:44,942
It was code name Zeus,

299
00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:47,111
and that's all I can tell you about it.

300
00:24:47,144 --> 00:24:48,979
Sir, what was Garcia's business

301
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:50,348
with the Russian Mafia?

302
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:52,317
Plutonium.

303
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,852
Weapons-grade plutonium.

304
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:56,221
There's no shortage of
the stuff lying around

305
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:57,956
in the former Soviet Union.

306
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:01,026
So Zeus is obviously
some crude form of nuke.

307
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:02,961
When Zeus was scrapped,

308
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:04,996
Garcia took it personally.

309
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,865
The project had been his life's work.

310
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:08,934
He made threats against the government,

311
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,770
but before the Department
was able to pick him up,

312
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:13,004
he fled to Cuba.

313
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:14,739
Does this bastard have the capacity

314
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:16,409
to launch a nuclear weapon, sir?

315
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:19,011
Unfortunately, yes.

316
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:21,747
And that is precisely why

317
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:24,984
he must be denied access
to nuclear material.

318
00:26:08,096 --> 00:26:10,098
Yes, what is it?

319
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,104
Americans? That would be Delta.

320
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,159
It's been a long time.

321
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:39,192
How are you?

322
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:42,898
Admiral, you didn't just call me here

323
00:26:42,931 --> 00:26:45,067
to say hello, did you.

324
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:47,936
You're right.

325
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,238
I called you here

326
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:52,007
because I wanted to ask
your opinion on something.

327
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:56,413
Who do you think killed Dr. Hill?

328
00:26:58,415 --> 00:26:59,482
The Serbs.

329
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:01,084
It was payback for Gravic.

330
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:03,019
That's what the newspaper said.

331
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:04,988
I'm not so sure.

332
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:06,990
Dr. Hill called that press conference

333
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:08,858
because he wanted to reveal something.

334
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:12,128
Maybe something related to Project Zeus.

335
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:13,897
Zeus?

336
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,999
But Zeus has been dead forever.

337
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:17,467
You know that. You were part of it.

338
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,405
So were you and Hill and Dr. Samuels.

339
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,375
What does Samuels think
of your conspiracy theory?

340
00:27:24,408 --> 00:27:28,145
I wish I could ask him. He's disappeared.

341
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,882
Maybe... he's your killer.

342
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,984
Sorry.

343
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:39,090
Well, he's just the only one who knew

344
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:40,257
what Hill was planning to reveal.

345
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,026
No.

346
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,095
I'm convinced there was someone else.

347
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:47,199
Someone crucial to the Zeus team.

348
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,068
I think you know who I mean.

349
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,102
You mean Garcia.

350
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,907
I haven't spoken to him in years.

351
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:58,009
Not since the project was terminated.

352
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,378
You really think he
would have Walter killed?

353
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,314
You tell me.

354
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,982
You were...

355
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,518
Well, you knew him better
than the rest of us.

356
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:07,919
Do you really believe

357
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,021
that he would resurrect Project Zeus?

358
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,225
Do you?

359
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,258
Okay.

360
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:17,029
You know what?

361
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,031
I think it's just the timing of the thing

362
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,100
that's got you thinking this way.

363
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,602
Because you and I both know

364
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:24,203
what Garcia's first move would be

365
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:26,439
if he was planning to pick up

366
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,040
where Zeus left off.

367
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,409
But it's not exactly like we
can, you know,

368
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,044
just get weapons-grade plutonium

369
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:34,080
at the corner store.

370
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:37,451
Very nice talking to you.

371
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:39,484
Laurie.

372
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:45,225
Garcia is close to getting

373
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:48,862
a quantity of plutonium as we speak.

374
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:07,911
Reload.

375
00:30:11,014 --> 00:30:12,382
Come on.

376
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:13,583
Reload.

377
00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:16,053
Reload.

378
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:17,355
Reload.

379
00:30:17,388 --> 00:30:19,388
Come on.

380
00:30:21,192 --> 00:30:23,192
Reload.

381
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:34,336
Mac.

382
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:36,438
Get that fear back.

383
00:30:38,643 --> 00:30:40,643
I'm watching you.

384
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,780
Let's go.

385
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,255
Nothing, Cap. It's empty.

386
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,356
Ditto.

387
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,026
No sign of Garcia or Vaseliv.

388
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,232
Rip the goddamn place apart.

389
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:05,502
I got it.

390
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,610
All right, let's see if I
remember a little Russian.

391
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:13,780
Where's the damn plutonium?

392
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:15,813
Fuck you, American.

393
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:24,257
Mac!

394
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,325
Jesus Christ, Mac.

395
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:26,592
Time's a-wasting.

396
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:28,127
This son of a bitch knows he's history.

397
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:29,429
He wants to die.

398
00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:30,698
The only way he's gonna talk

399
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:32,499
is if he wants something
more, like less pain.

400
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:33,534
Now talk, motherfucker!

401
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,169
Ask him again.

402
00:31:35,202 --> 00:31:37,338
Ask him!

403
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:40,007
The plutonium, where is it?

404
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:45,077
Mac.

405
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:50,515
Trucks. He said trucks.

406
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,358
Train or plane?

407
00:31:56,391 --> 00:31:58,391
Train or plane?

408
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,732
Cap. Cap, he's dead.

409
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:05,734
Let it go.

410
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:08,203
That's a real good plan, McKinney.

411
00:32:08,236 --> 00:32:10,205
We're not done with you, asshole.

412
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:12,238
I said let it go. He's dead.

413
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:15,443
What's your problem, Doc?

414
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:17,479
I don't like your tactics, Mac.

415
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:19,581
Maybe if you let me try to save him

416
00:32:19,614 --> 00:32:21,851
we might have got some more
information out of him.

417
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,819
But we'll never know, will we, Mac.

418
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:25,821
Fuck me. I got 'em.

419
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:27,757
It's the trucks we passed earlier.

420
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,126
They're splitting up.

421
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,594
Shit.

422
00:32:31,627 --> 00:32:34,163
They must be going to
the train and the plane.

423
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:35,664
But which one's got the goods?

424
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:37,166
Who the hell knows?

425
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,199
Maybe both.

426
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,837
Mac, Hutch, Doc.

427
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:43,871
Come on.

428
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:19,210
We got to split up. Now!

429
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:52,569
Fuck!

430
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:54,603
You got to be kidding me.

431
00:35:57,007 --> 00:35:58,075
Wonderful.

432
00:35:58,108 --> 00:36:00,108
Now what?

433
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:03,280
Here's our answer.

434
00:36:08,052 --> 00:36:08,886
Get out.

435
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,989
Just keep it cool, nobody gets hurt.

436
00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:13,022
Go, go, go, go, go.

437
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:50,829
Mac, you come with me.

438
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:52,831
You guys get to the train station ASAP.

439
00:36:52,865 --> 00:36:54,833
You got any suggestions how?

440
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:55,968
I don't care how. Just get there.

441
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:58,001
Okay, Cap.

442
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:38,077
Come on!

443
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,577
Look, look, look, look!

444
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:42,339
Get out! Get out of the car now!

445
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:08,134
Do you believe this shit, Cap?

446
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:10,971
Right now I'd believe anything.

447
00:40:11,004 --> 00:40:12,806
Think we have an option?

448
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,174
Nope.

449
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:16,176
I didn't think so.

450
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:18,209
Let's go.

451
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:24,318
Shit.

452
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:25,620
It's already underway.

453
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:26,954
Maybe.

454
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:28,956
That's gonna be one hell of a short trip.

455
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,291
You got something, Hutch?

456
00:40:30,324 --> 00:40:33,160
Hey, I'm working on it, all right?

457
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:37,732
Yeah, well you better come
up with something fast.

458
00:40:37,765 --> 00:40:41,002
First we've got to get ahead of it.

459
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:43,739
Yeah? No shit. Then what?

460
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:53,081
Vick, Doc, you take that switch

461
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:55,150
and make the train go to the right.

462
00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:57,719
You keep it in the yard,
I'll figure out a way to stop it.

463
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:08,763
Get it up.

464
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:16,039
Doc. Yeah?

465
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:17,941
It's stuck. Relax.

466
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:19,974
Ready? Go!

467
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,873
The son of a bitch.

468
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,355
You slowing down, kid?

469
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:15,024
Got to make someone look
good, Doc, especially old men.

470
00:44:33,077 --> 00:44:35,077
Fuck!

471
00:44:45,122 --> 00:44:47,122
Son of a bitch.

472
00:45:05,043 --> 00:45:07,043
Fuck this.

473
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,881
Team 2 to Team 1.

474
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,917
There is no package.

475
00:46:25,026 --> 00:46:27,028
You feel the fear, Cap?

476
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:28,630
You bet I do, Mac.

477
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:31,165
That's what's gonna keep us alive.

478
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:35,271
Team 1 to Team 2. Do you copy? Over.

479
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,642
Team 1 to Team 2. Do you copy? Over.

480
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:42,011
Where the hell are they?

481
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:44,613
Shit. Shit.

482
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:47,049
It's just you and me, Mac.

483
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:50,083
Move it.

484
00:47:08,138 --> 00:47:10,138
Go.

485
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:20,250
Mac, that stunt you pulled at the chalet,

486
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:22,253
what were you thinking, man?

487
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:25,189
Probably the same thing
you're thinking right now.

488
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:27,124
Yeah? What's that?

489
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:29,593
It's the rush, Cap. The adrenaline rush.

490
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:31,062
Walking the line, you know?

491
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:33,464
No danger, no life.

492
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:47,843
Go.

493
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:51,781
Fuck.

494
00:47:54,419 --> 00:47:56,221
Now we just hop in this puppy

495
00:47:56,254 --> 00:47:57,422
and drive it away.

496
00:47:57,456 --> 00:47:58,724
Good plan, Mac.

497
00:47:58,757 --> 00:48:00,757
Ready? Go!

498
00:48:14,674 --> 00:48:16,809
Some plan, Mac. Nice fucking plan.

499
00:48:16,843 --> 00:48:18,478
You think of that yourself?

500
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:19,545
No problem, Cap.

501
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:21,781
We got 'em right where we want 'em.

502
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,694
Damn it!

503
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:20,542
I'm sick of this shit.

504
00:49:20,575 --> 00:49:21,676
That makes two of us.

505
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:25,280
You distract 'em, Mac. Move, move, move!

506
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:55,278
Good afternoon, ladies!

507
00:50:58,677 --> 00:51:00,012
All right, Mac. Get that truck.

508
00:51:00,045 --> 00:51:02,281
Take it out,
but remember that plutonium, Mac.

509
00:51:02,314 --> 00:51:04,314
Okay.

510
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:16,462
Okay, okay, fire one.

511
00:51:16,496 --> 00:51:18,831
Okay, take it, take it.

512
00:51:18,865 --> 00:51:20,865
Fire!

513
00:51:30,076 --> 00:51:33,247
Fire two! Fire!

514
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:37,818
I got him, Mac.

515
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:40,654
I'm gonna try and cut him off
here, Mac. Hold on.

516
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,570
Fire!

517
00:51:59,808 --> 00:52:03,311
Nice shot, Mac. You got 'em.

518
00:52:26,035 --> 00:52:28,035
Cover!

519
00:52:28,871 --> 00:52:30,871
Go, go, go!

520
00:53:01,538 --> 00:53:03,538
Let's get that motherfucker.

521
00:53:31,436 --> 00:53:33,436
Shit.

522
00:53:40,779 --> 00:53:42,779
Shit.

523
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:56,829
It is not my problem

524
00:53:56,862 --> 00:53:58,664
that your men are being killed.

525
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:01,200
Death is irrelevant, but what is relevant

526
00:54:01,233 --> 00:54:04,437
is the location of my plutonium.

527
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:06,471
Yes, the location.

528
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,709
Yeah, good.

529
00:54:11,745 --> 00:54:13,745
Enter.

530
00:54:24,224 --> 00:54:26,224
Ten-hut!

531
00:54:28,195 --> 00:54:30,064
Glad you all got back safely.

532
00:54:30,097 --> 00:54:33,167
Gentlemen,
I'd like a word with your captain.

533
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
Would you wait outside?

534
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:46,947
What's on your mind, Captain?

535
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:48,048
Turkmenistan, sir.

536
00:54:48,082 --> 00:54:50,651
Operation Snowdrop.

537
00:54:50,684 --> 00:54:51,952
What about it?

538
00:54:51,986 --> 00:54:53,622
With all due respect, sir,

539
00:54:53,655 --> 00:54:55,891
if we just had a little more information,

540
00:54:55,924 --> 00:54:57,559
maybe about this Project Zeus...

541
00:54:57,592 --> 00:55:00,128
I assure you, Captain,
Zeus was not a factor.

542
00:55:00,162 --> 00:55:01,997
Then it must have been
the intelligence, sir.

543
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,599
There was no way we were gonna
make that chalet on time.

544
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:06,568
Enemy capacities were
grossly underestimated.

545
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:08,036
We walked into a freaking war zone.

546
00:55:08,069 --> 00:55:10,038
So the intelligence
was less than perfect.

547
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:11,139
Less than perfect?

548
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:12,474
Goddamn it, Skip!

549
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:15,052
You've been at this job long enough
to know that no intelligence...

550
00:55:15,076 --> 00:55:16,978
kind of intelligence
that brought us in there

551
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:19,549
with our dick in our hand
and they came with tanks.

552
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,582
We should be dead!

553
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,723
Been together for a long time.

554
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,159
So I'm asking you...

555
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,065
I can't tell you, Skip.

556
00:55:36,098 --> 00:55:38,701
That's bullshit,
and we both know it's bullshit.

557
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:43,337
Skip.

558
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,210
I'm working this one on my own.

559
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:49,213
I don't have any official backing.

560
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:51,582
I need your help.

561
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,653
Why?

562
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,690
If this mission fails,

563
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:04,127
yours, mine, anyone's worst nightmare.

564
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,870
What's Garcia up to, sir?

565
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:17,609
The plane carrying his
plutonium came down

566
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:21,145
somewhere near or on Edelbrand Island.

567
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,081
Isn't that off the coast of Oregon?

568
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:25,950
Volcanic. Uninhabited.

569
00:56:25,984 --> 00:56:29,120
Aside from an occasional scientific
expedition, it's deserted.

570
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:31,155
What do you need from us, sir?

571
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:34,126
I want you to go in, find the
plutonium, and get the hell out.

572
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:36,095
I'll send in a special
hazmat team to retrieve it.

573
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:38,964
And I want you to take someone along.

574
00:56:38,998 --> 00:56:40,633
Who's that, sir?

575
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:41,901
Send in Ms. Granger.

576
00:56:41,934 --> 00:56:43,934
Who?

577
00:56:46,238 --> 00:56:48,238
Laurie.

578
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:53,879
I'd like you to meet Captain Lang.

579
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:57,216
Captain Lang, Miss Laurie Granger.

580
00:56:57,249 --> 00:56:59,853
Laurie's familiar with the island.

581
00:56:59,886 --> 00:57:01,855
She's made several expeditions there.

582
00:57:01,888 --> 00:57:04,057
Pleasure to meet you, Captain.

583
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:07,360
When do we leave, sir.

584
00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:09,696
Immediately. You can be goddamn sure

585
00:57:09,729 --> 00:57:12,832
that Garcia will be organizing
his own search for the plutonium.

586
00:57:12,866 --> 00:57:14,868
I don't know what
you're gonna find there,

587
00:57:14,901 --> 00:57:16,901
but good luck.

588
00:57:18,738 --> 00:57:20,738
Thank you, sir.

589
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:28,816
Miss Granger.

590
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:29,817
What?

591
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,085
Are you coming?

592
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:33,118
Yes.

593
00:58:33,082 --> 00:58:36,786
That... will be the cavalry, Doctor.

594
00:58:38,489 --> 00:58:42,092
Not exactly the most
optimum amount of time

595
00:58:42,126 --> 00:58:45,796
to ready the warhead or
to deal with Henshaw,

596
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:47,829
but we'll make due.

597
00:58:48,832 --> 00:58:51,135
What are you talking about, Dr. Garcia?

598
00:58:53,137 --> 00:58:55,339
That's right. You didn't know.

599
00:58:58,142 --> 00:59:01,178
And you probably thought
that this would never happen.

600
00:59:01,211 --> 00:59:03,211
Dr. Samuels, I did it.

601
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:07,152
With the plutonium.

602
00:59:07,185 --> 00:59:08,820
Plutonium?

603
00:59:08,853 --> 00:59:09,888
Yeah.

604
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,489
My God, man.

605
00:59:11,523 --> 00:59:13,858
Do you realize what you're doing?

606
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:17,862
Do I know what I'm doing?

607
00:59:17,896 --> 00:59:19,230
I'm fulfilling my dreams,

608
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,766
and absolutely nothing is gonna stop me.

609
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,802
Excuse me, Doctor.

610
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:30,176
And at the moment of
detonation, my dear friend,

611
00:59:30,209 --> 00:59:32,144
it will be my completion.

612
00:59:32,178 --> 00:59:36,215
A work of genius. Look at it! Look at it.

613
00:59:47,393 --> 00:59:50,496
Thirty minutes and we'll
be off this island.

614
00:59:50,529 --> 00:59:52,498
You know, a funny thing happened to me

615
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:55,368
when I moved to America, Dr. Samuels.

616
00:59:57,571 --> 00:59:59,571
I became an American.

617
01:00:00,907 --> 01:00:02,109
Quite.

618
01:00:02,142 --> 01:00:07,214
I was successful, prosperous.

619
01:00:07,247 --> 01:00:10,283
God, I was, I was like a child,

620
01:00:10,317 --> 01:00:12,317
full of dreams.

621
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:30,338
Until the government,
the American government,

622
01:00:30,371 --> 01:00:33,141
the President, no less,

623
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:37,845
imposed an embargo on me and my work.

624
01:00:39,213 --> 01:00:40,248
Slapping me down like a dog

625
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:42,383
before they could ever
realize my full potential.

626
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:47,256
Dr. Samuels, my situation, it...

627
01:00:47,289 --> 01:00:49,291
it mirrored that of Cuba's.

628
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,095
I started feeling

629
01:00:53,128 --> 01:00:56,431
what Cuba as a nation had felt for years,

630
01:00:56,465 --> 01:01:00,002
and I knew exactly, I knew exactly then

631
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:02,035
what I wanted to do.

632
01:01:03,272 --> 01:01:05,374
I wanted to strike
back at the oppressors,

633
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,407
the extinguishers of dreams.

634
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,480
And at long last...

635
01:01:15,285 --> 01:01:17,320
that's exactly what I'm doing.

636
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:20,423
But you're a scientist, not a murderer.

637
01:01:20,456 --> 01:01:24,594
This is science, Dr. Samuels.

638
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:28,331
It's a triumph of man over nature.

639
01:01:40,644 --> 01:01:43,480
I think now is a good time
to tell us what you know.

640
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:46,016
Come on.

641
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,094
You've got something to do
with Project Zeus, right?

642
01:01:48,118 --> 01:01:51,188
I'm only here to help facilitate

643
01:01:51,222 --> 01:01:53,090
your search for the plutonium.

644
01:01:53,123 --> 01:01:54,158
Yeah, right, lady.

645
01:01:54,191 --> 01:01:56,327
Here we go flying blind
again into another mission.

646
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,028
This is a bunch of bullshit.

647
01:01:58,062 --> 01:01:59,231
If she's not here to help us,

648
01:01:59,264 --> 01:02:01,233
what the fuck is she doing here?

649
01:02:01,266 --> 01:02:03,301
Why don't you guys get off my back?

650
01:02:03,335 --> 01:02:05,170
You know, I'll do my job if you do yours.

651
01:02:05,203 --> 01:02:06,438
How's that?

652
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:08,173
Don't worry about us, lady.

653
01:02:08,206 --> 01:02:10,108
We get the job done whatever it takes.

654
01:02:10,141 --> 01:02:12,141
How's that? Stand down, Mac.

655
01:02:16,147 --> 01:02:17,616
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

656
01:02:17,649 --> 01:02:19,649
Shit.

657
01:02:39,405 --> 01:02:41,405
My God.

658
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,679
What the fuck is that?

659
01:02:54,221 --> 01:02:55,589
He's really doing it.

660
01:02:55,622 --> 01:02:57,724
Doing what? What's he doing?

661
01:02:57,758 --> 01:03:01,261
What the fuck, is he trying to trigger
some sort of volcano or some shit?

662
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:04,731
Look, guys...

663
01:03:04,765 --> 01:03:07,701
the goal of Project Zeus
was to study the feasibility

664
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:10,103
of using nuclear explosions.

665
01:03:10,137 --> 01:03:11,371
To do what?

666
01:03:11,405 --> 01:03:14,042
To trigger earthquakes.

667
01:03:14,075 --> 01:03:15,243
Jesus.

668
01:03:15,276 --> 01:03:18,246
Our tax dollars at work.

669
01:03:18,279 --> 01:03:20,315
That's what Zeus was about?

670
01:03:20,348 --> 01:03:21,783
What's wrong with you fucking people?

671
01:03:21,816 --> 01:03:22,784
Are you nuts?

672
01:03:22,817 --> 01:03:23,618
Easy, Doc.

673
01:03:23,651 --> 01:03:25,486
Yeah, one giant leap for mankind.

674
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,789
Look, we can hash out
morality issues later.

675
01:03:27,822 --> 01:03:30,091
Yeah, what the fuck we gonna do now?

676
01:03:31,626 --> 01:03:33,561
I always knew this was possible.

677
01:03:33,594 --> 01:03:37,131
I just... I never thought that he
would actually go through with it.

678
01:03:37,165 --> 01:03:39,335
Let's move out.

679
01:05:28,815 --> 01:05:30,850
Cap, do you see that man right there?

680
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:34,921
Yeah, I see him.

681
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:36,656
That's Timothy Samuels.

682
01:05:36,689 --> 01:05:38,689
It's Dr. Hill's protégé.

683
01:05:40,226 --> 01:05:42,226
We need to talk to him.

684
01:06:11,459 --> 01:06:14,395
Shh! Sergeant Sparks, Delta Force.

685
01:06:16,297 --> 01:06:18,867
You're too late. It's too late!

686
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,368
What do you mean it's too late?

687
01:06:20,401 --> 01:06:21,469
It's Zeus!

688
01:06:21,503 --> 01:06:25,573
This volcano on a feeder
fault to the San Andreas.

689
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:29,244
He's armed the missile.
It's a doomsday device.

690
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,845
It can't be stopped.

691
01:06:30,879 --> 01:06:33,381
Not even by Garcia.

692
01:06:33,414 --> 01:06:36,418
Projected magnitude, 9.3.

693
01:06:36,452 --> 01:06:38,420
Jesus, man.

694
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:39,188
Cap, did you hear that?

695
01:06:39,221 --> 01:06:41,490
9.3 earthquake, San Andreas Fault.

696
01:06:41,524 --> 01:06:43,759
9.3.

697
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:46,262
There goes California
and everything else.

698
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,803
Okay?

699
01:06:57,406 --> 01:06:59,406
Hello, Olivio.

700
01:07:05,682 --> 01:07:07,682
Laurie.

701
01:07:11,354 --> 01:07:12,489
My dear, sweet Laurie.

702
01:07:12,522 --> 01:07:15,292
It's not that I'm not glad to see you,

703
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:17,427
but what the fuck are you doing?

704
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,728
I've come to help you.

705
01:07:18,762 --> 01:07:21,331
You've come to help me.

706
01:07:22,532 --> 01:07:24,835
Just like you did when the
Americans aborted Zeus?

707
01:07:24,869 --> 01:07:28,973
You left me when I needed you the most.

708
01:07:29,006 --> 01:07:31,742
No, Olivio. You left me, remember?

709
01:07:33,878 --> 01:07:35,479
It's not too late.

710
01:07:35,513 --> 01:07:37,415
You could stop all of this.

711
01:07:37,448 --> 01:07:39,717
What about my country?
What about the Cuban people?

712
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,986
Your country? The Cuban people?

713
01:07:42,019 --> 01:07:42,987
That's right.

714
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,356
This isn't about Cuba.
This is about revenge.

715
01:07:45,389 --> 01:07:46,724
You and I both know that.

716
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:48,693
I know that Zeus was your baby, okay?

717
01:07:48,726 --> 01:07:49,828
I know that.

718
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:51,630
I'm really fucking sorry.

719
01:07:51,663 --> 01:07:53,298
When the Americans doubted you

720
01:07:53,332 --> 01:07:56,335
and they terminated it, you felt cheated.

721
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:57,536
So did I.

722
01:07:57,569 --> 01:07:59,404
They robbed you.

723
01:07:59,438 --> 01:08:00,973
They robbed you of your place in history,

724
01:08:01,006 --> 01:08:02,307
your Nobel Peace Prize,

725
01:08:02,341 --> 01:08:04,776
your fucking Time magazine cover.

726
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,345
I'm sorry about that.

727
01:08:06,378 --> 01:08:08,513
Would you fucking look at me please?

728
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:11,850
I loved you.

729
01:08:11,883 --> 01:08:15,855
And I know you better than anybody's
ever known you in your entire life.

730
01:08:15,888 --> 01:08:18,324
You're not gonna sacrifice the lives

731
01:08:18,358 --> 01:08:20,436
of millions and millions of people
to soothe your own wounded pride.

732
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:21,661
You're not gonna do it.

733
01:08:21,694 --> 01:08:22,762
He lied to me.

734
01:08:22,795 --> 01:08:24,497
I never thought he'd get plutonium.

735
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,665
Hoped someone, anyone...

736
01:08:25,698 --> 01:08:27,767
Look, listen, Doc, we're here now.

737
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,435
There's got to be something we can do.

738
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:32,772
No. He's armed a missile. It's too late.

739
01:08:32,805 --> 01:08:34,440
How much time do we have?

740
01:08:34,474 --> 01:08:35,875
I don't know.

741
01:08:35,908 --> 01:08:37,977
Half an hour? Maybe less.

742
01:08:38,011 --> 01:08:40,011
Only he knows.

743
01:08:42,983 --> 01:08:45,419
An impressive strategy.

744
01:08:45,452 --> 01:08:48,856
And valiantly executed.

745
01:08:48,889 --> 01:08:50,889
But you are quite wrong.

746
01:08:57,765 --> 01:08:59,765
Whoa, buddy!

747
01:09:00,401 --> 01:09:02,401
Fuck!

748
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:06,841
Fuck, where's she gone?

749
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:08,877
I suppose that's Santa Claus

750
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:10,445
bearing me gifts.

751
01:09:10,478 --> 01:09:14,683
While you stand here and
spin your web of lies,

752
01:09:14,716 --> 01:09:16,751
your allies seek out to destroy me?

753
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:19,487
You, you, you, go!

754
01:09:19,521 --> 01:09:21,521
Sí. Go! Go!

755
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,995
Come on, get him up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

756
01:09:27,028 --> 01:09:27,996
Sparks, hurry up.

757
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:29,130
No, give me a second, Cap.

758
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:29,965
Listen, man, think.

759
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,834
There's got to be something we can do.

760
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:34,136
Now, where's the missile?
How are they gonna launch it?

761
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,170
Wait a minute.

762
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,842
I heard him mention a mercury switch.

763
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,712
Hold on, Cap. We may have something.

764
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,448
If you can find that,
you may have a chance.

765
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:49,151
But a strong jolt will
start the ignition sequence.

766
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,586
You understand?

767
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,054
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

768
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:53,856
Cap, get me out of here.

769
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,726
Get yourself out of here, Doc.

770
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:57,759
Then pray.

771
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:11,408
You promised we'd be released.

772
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:17,981
And you are absolutely correct, Doctor.

773
01:10:19,817 --> 01:10:21,817
You have really lost it.

774
01:10:26,524 --> 01:10:27,759
Now you're released.

775
01:10:27,792 --> 01:10:30,461
And so are you.

776
01:10:30,495 --> 01:10:32,495
Take her to the surface.

777
01:10:37,502 --> 01:10:39,502
You want a war?

778
01:10:41,706 --> 01:10:44,175
I am going to give you
fucking Armageddon.

779
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:06,229
Come on!

780
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,537
Go! Go to the top of the stairs. Go!

781
01:12:07,696 --> 01:12:09,297
Shit.

782
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:10,699
We're here.

783
01:12:10,732 --> 01:12:12,267
We got to be there.

784
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,802
With that big machine, man,

785
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:15,835
we may never make it, Cap.

786
01:12:18,173 --> 01:12:19,341
Please, boss.

787
01:12:19,374 --> 01:12:21,374
Give it a shot.

788
01:12:26,015 --> 01:12:28,317
Bunch of fucking lies.

789
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:29,819
All lies, baby.

790
01:12:29,852 --> 01:12:30,987
This is a big fucking con.

791
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,089
Suzanna, everything.

792
01:12:33,122 --> 01:12:34,190
A bunch of fucking lies.

793
01:12:34,223 --> 01:12:37,059
Listen to me.
We don't have time for that shit.

794
01:12:41,864 --> 01:12:44,600
I got time for that shit.

795
01:12:44,634 --> 01:12:47,603
Motherfucking lies, motherfucker.

796
01:12:47,637 --> 01:12:49,637
Motherfucking lies.

797
01:13:00,217 --> 01:13:02,286
No more lies.

798
01:13:11,194 --> 01:13:13,931
So what's Plan B, Cap?

799
01:13:13,964 --> 01:13:15,400
There is no Plan B.

800
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,433
That's comforting.

801
01:13:23,174 --> 01:13:24,676
Peace.

802
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:26,709
Vickers!

803
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,679
No!

804
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,656
Vick, no. No!

805
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:40,690
Vick!

806
01:13:50,102 --> 01:13:52,102
Vick!

807
01:14:05,785 --> 01:14:07,887
This is all I am.

808
01:14:12,292 --> 01:14:14,292
All I am.

809
01:14:24,738 --> 01:14:25,972
Baby,

810
01:14:26,006 --> 01:14:28,006
it's the only thing we know.

811
01:14:31,345 --> 01:14:33,345
It's the only thing we know.

812
01:14:43,324 --> 01:14:45,324
Move out.

813
01:16:08,178 --> 01:16:10,178
Grenade!

814
01:16:14,352 --> 01:16:15,887
Cap, can you hear me?

815
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,156
Cap, can you hear anything?

816
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:20,525
Gonna have nightmares of this place.

817
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,385
We're stuck, Hutch.

818
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:48,418
No way up, no way down.

819
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:53,926
Christ, we're sitting ducks.

820
01:16:58,297 --> 01:17:00,065
Doc.

821
01:17:00,099 --> 01:17:02,135
Let's take the express
lane to the control room.

822
01:17:04,604 --> 01:17:06,604
Follow my lead, Doc.

823
01:17:09,309 --> 01:17:11,309
Go!

824
01:17:19,586 --> 01:17:21,586
Fuck!

825
01:17:36,404 --> 01:17:38,404
Mac, we have 14 minutes.

826
01:17:44,445 --> 01:17:47,381
Die, you motherfuckers!

827
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,300
Jesus Christ.

828
01:18:13,442 --> 01:18:14,509
Hutch, Doc.

829
01:18:14,543 --> 01:18:16,446
We've located the missile.

830
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:18,948
I don't know, Cap.
We're in deep shit here.

831
01:18:18,982 --> 01:18:20,450
Can you trace your route back

832
01:18:20,483 --> 01:18:22,318
and give us a hand?

833
01:18:22,352 --> 01:18:24,487
No, that's a negative, Cap.

834
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,422
Feels like a fucking maze.

835
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:27,657
Hutch is hit.

836
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:29,690
We got to find another way back.

837
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,420
Little lower, Cap.

838
01:19:07,332 --> 01:19:09,401
To the left, Cap! Lower!

839
01:19:09,434 --> 01:19:11,434
Yeah, I heard you.

840
01:19:20,712 --> 01:19:23,315
Okay, that's good! Cap, good.

841
01:19:25,684 --> 01:19:28,053
You know what you're
doing down there, Mac?

842
01:19:28,086 --> 01:19:30,489
Trying to save the freaking world.

843
01:19:30,523 --> 01:19:31,691
What?

844
01:19:31,724 --> 01:19:35,094
It's got a mercury switch, Cap.

845
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:37,196
Got to disable the switch.

846
01:19:39,832 --> 01:19:41,434
Fuck!

847
01:19:41,467 --> 01:19:42,735
What do you think?

848
01:19:42,768 --> 01:19:44,337
We got to get through that door.

849
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:45,805
All right. All right.

850
01:19:45,838 --> 01:19:49,175
Fine. You cover me, all right?

851
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:51,208
Now!

852
01:19:58,852 --> 01:20:01,054
Fuck, I missed him, Doc.

853
01:20:10,464 --> 01:20:12,165
Goddamn it.

854
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:14,199
Doc?

855
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,103
Doc.

856
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:23,542
Come on.

857
01:20:26,347 --> 01:20:28,549
What happened?

858
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,618
I don't know.

859
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:32,353
We got to get you out of here.

860
01:20:32,387 --> 01:20:35,189
Come on. No! No, Hutch.

861
01:20:35,223 --> 01:20:37,223
No.

862
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:39,658
Shit.

863
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:45,831
Shit.

864
01:20:47,803 --> 01:20:49,571
Cap, there's a cylinder.

865
01:20:49,605 --> 01:20:51,140
Wires.

866
01:20:51,173 --> 01:20:53,173
There's too many wires!

867
01:20:54,143 --> 01:20:58,313
Mac, you got eight minutes.

868
01:20:58,347 --> 01:21:00,347
Eight minutes.

869
01:21:01,817 --> 01:21:03,585
You...

870
01:21:03,619 --> 01:21:05,554
You get to Cap.

871
01:21:05,587 --> 01:21:07,256
Okay.

872
01:21:07,289 --> 01:21:10,325
You stop this fucking madness.

873
01:21:10,359 --> 01:21:11,594
All right. Shh, shh, shh...

874
01:21:11,628 --> 01:21:13,129
Just promise me.

875
01:21:13,163 --> 01:21:15,465
I promise.

876
01:21:15,498 --> 01:21:18,234
You go. Go.

877
01:21:18,268 --> 01:21:20,268
Go. Give me the gun.

878
01:21:20,837 --> 01:21:22,837
Go.

879
01:21:24,407 --> 01:21:27,377
Cap. Cap.

880
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:29,410
Doc's been hit.

881
01:21:30,613 --> 01:21:32,749
Serious.

882
01:21:32,782 --> 01:21:34,417
He's not gonna make it.

883
01:21:34,451 --> 01:21:36,451
Copy that.

884
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:41,358
Copy that, Hutch.

885
01:21:41,392 --> 01:21:43,828
Just get here as fast as you can. Hurry!

886
01:22:16,461 --> 01:22:19,164
Cap! What's going on?

887
01:22:22,267 --> 01:22:24,267
Garcia.

888
01:22:25,403 --> 01:22:27,403
Son of a bitch is still
hanging around, Mac.

889
01:22:28,808 --> 01:22:30,243
You hurry up.

890
01:22:30,276 --> 01:22:31,511
Just keep your eye out.

891
01:22:31,544 --> 01:22:32,879
You're not hit, are you?

892
01:22:32,912 --> 01:22:34,614
No.

893
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:36,482
Don't you bullshit me, Cap!

894
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:39,385
You just do your job, Mac.

895
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,820
Quickly.

896
01:22:44,657 --> 01:22:46,459
Jesus.

897
01:22:46,492 --> 01:22:48,895
Do it quickly.

898
01:22:55,435 --> 01:22:58,705
Yellow wire, green wire, blue wire.

899
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:00,474
Fuck.

900
01:23:00,507 --> 01:23:02,576
Of all the missiles in all the world,

901
01:23:02,609 --> 01:23:04,611
you had to come flying into mine.

902
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,620
Holy shit.

903
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:18,726
You figure the thing out yet, Mac?

904
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,328
I'm working on it.

905
01:23:20,361 --> 01:23:22,361
Just keep your eye out for Garcia.

906
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:34,709
Shit!

907
01:23:34,742 --> 01:23:36,742
Bastard!

908
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:40,515
Where is he, Cap? Can't see him.

909
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,548
He's above me!

910
01:23:55,064 --> 01:23:57,466
Damn it.

911
01:24:01,904 --> 01:24:04,607
Did you smoke him, farm boy?

912
01:24:06,776 --> 01:24:08,776
I hit something.

913
01:24:10,447 --> 01:24:12,447
He's out of my sight.

914
01:24:25,829 --> 01:24:27,430
Cap!

915
01:24:27,464 --> 01:24:29,499
Whoa!

916
01:24:31,369 --> 01:24:32,803
I don't care if you are my captain.

917
01:24:32,837 --> 01:24:34,105
You hold that fucker steady,

918
01:24:34,138 --> 01:24:36,138
or I'll come up there and kick your ass.

919
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:39,410
Hutch.

920
01:24:39,443 --> 01:24:41,479
You find Garcia.

921
01:24:41,512 --> 01:24:44,482
I'm wide open.

922
01:24:44,515 --> 01:24:47,084
You nail that son of a bitch.

923
01:24:48,552 --> 01:24:49,520
You hear me?

924
01:24:49,553 --> 01:24:51,553
All right, Cap.

925
01:24:53,024 --> 01:24:55,526
Got one bullet left, baby.

926
01:24:55,559 --> 01:24:57,559
One bullet left.

927
01:25:19,084 --> 01:25:21,587
Six minutes, Mac!

928
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:25,491
I've got to get the switch, Cap.

929
01:25:29,595 --> 01:25:31,595
Cap!

930
01:25:37,136 --> 01:25:38,538
Six minutes.

931
01:25:38,571 --> 01:25:41,374
Six whole minutes.

932
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:45,578
A whole lot can happen.

933
01:25:45,611 --> 01:25:48,916
A whole lot of shit can
happen in six minutes.

934
01:25:48,949 --> 01:25:52,553
I can make a burger, have a beer.

935
01:25:55,789 --> 01:25:57,789
Make love.

936
01:25:59,927 --> 01:26:02,029
Make love twice.

937
01:26:04,698 --> 01:26:06,698
Die.

938
01:26:07,601 --> 01:26:08,836
Give birth.

939
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:10,869
Hey, Cap.

940
01:26:12,474 --> 01:26:14,476
Your buddy...

941
01:26:14,509 --> 01:26:16,611
the one that fell down the storm drain.

942
01:26:16,644 --> 01:26:18,179
What happened?

943
01:26:18,213 --> 01:26:20,749
He died.

944
01:26:20,782 --> 01:26:22,782
He died in the Nam.

945
01:26:24,519 --> 01:26:26,519
He never understood, Mac.

946
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:32,658
What?

947
01:26:34,195 --> 01:26:35,663
What didn't he understand?

948
01:26:35,697 --> 01:26:37,697
The fear.

949
01:26:39,568 --> 01:26:42,438
He didn't get it, Mac.
He didn't get the fear.

950
01:26:43,639 --> 01:26:45,541
Finally...

951
01:26:45,574 --> 01:26:47,574
some gook just cut him in two.

952
01:26:53,215 --> 01:26:55,551
You got to finish this now.

953
01:26:58,254 --> 01:27:00,790
I understand, Cap.

954
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:11,468
I'm beginning to understand.

955
01:27:17,874 --> 01:27:19,874
Come on.

956
01:27:30,855 --> 01:27:32,855
John.

957
01:27:34,826 --> 01:27:37,261
John, hey.

958
01:27:37,295 --> 01:27:39,297
Is that you?

959
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:41,766
Daddy, daddy, let's play some ball.

960
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:44,302
Hey, son, how you doing?

961
01:27:44,335 --> 01:27:47,271
Yeah, all right.

962
01:27:47,305 --> 01:27:49,307
All right.

963
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:52,177
I'll throw the ball, okay?

964
01:27:52,211 --> 01:27:54,646
You watch...

965
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,680
You watch that ball.

966
01:27:57,349 --> 01:27:58,951
Right into your bat.

967
01:27:58,984 --> 01:28:02,054
When you swing at it,
just watch it hit the bat.

968
01:28:02,087 --> 01:28:04,590
Come on, baby. Come on.

969
01:28:04,623 --> 01:28:06,792
Almost. Almost.

970
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,261
Good job!

971
01:28:09,294 --> 01:28:11,029
Did you see that one, Dad?

972
01:28:11,063 --> 01:28:12,631
Good?

973
01:28:12,664 --> 01:28:14,766
I should have called you Mark.

974
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,303
Like Mark McGwire.

975
01:28:21,808 --> 01:28:23,808
Then...

976
01:28:27,146 --> 01:28:29,146
I'd be calling you Mac.

977
01:28:52,139 --> 01:28:54,139
War.

978
01:28:55,809 --> 01:28:57,809
How do you like it?

979
01:29:07,656 --> 01:29:09,656
Fuck.

980
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:11,393
Hutch, will you put a bullet

981
01:29:11,426 --> 01:29:13,426
in that son of a bitch!

982
01:29:38,321 --> 01:29:40,356
It's counting down.

983
01:29:40,389 --> 01:29:42,389
It's counting down.

984
01:29:43,426 --> 01:29:45,426
God, no.

985
01:29:48,831 --> 01:29:51,000
I don't want to die.

986
01:29:51,033 --> 01:29:52,335
I don't want to die.

987
01:29:52,368 --> 01:29:54,403
And I'm scared.

988
01:29:54,437 --> 01:29:56,437
I'm scared.

989
01:30:00,944 --> 01:30:02,944
I've got the fear.

990
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:05,380
I've got the fear.

991
01:30:11,388 --> 01:30:13,388
Cap!

992
01:30:14,725 --> 01:30:16,725
I got it!

993
01:30:17,427 --> 01:30:19,329
Pull me up!

994
01:30:19,363 --> 01:30:21,933
Cap!

995
01:30:23,201 --> 01:30:24,469
Pull me up!

996
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:26,502
Mac.

997
01:30:27,372 --> 01:30:29,372
Cap's dead.

998
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:29,436
Do you need help?

999
01:31:29,469 --> 01:31:31,104
No, thanks.

1000
01:31:31,137 --> 01:31:33,137
I'm okay.

1001
01:32:49,452 --> 01:32:51,452
Fire.

1002
01:32:52,422 --> 01:32:54,422
Fire.

1003
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:57,325
Fire.

1004
01:32:58,295 --> 01:33:00,295
Fire.

1005
01:33:01,298 --> 01:33:03,298
Fire.

1006
01:33:04,101 --> 01:33:06,101
Fire.

1007
01:33:06,637 --> 01:33:08,637
Fire.
