1
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,507
We got them agitated,
didn't we?

2
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,182
You ride with god today.

3
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,851
You know I ain't got
no religion.

4
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,721
Do you not fear
the eternal hell
that awaits you?

5
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,424
I ain't planning
to see it just yet.

6
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,632
Good people of Helena.

7
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,901
Good people of Helena!

8
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,537
I am saddened

9
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:30,642
<i> because today</i>
<i> Helena loses one</i>
<i> of her true sons.</i>

10
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,712
Now we've cleansed
the Mexican filth
from our city,

11
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,516
but the disease left behind
has infected our civility.

12
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,351
Man:
<i> That's right!</i>
<i> You hear that?</i>

13
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,621
These brown heathens pushed
their carts through our land.

14
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:46,291
And instead of uniting
against these indignations,

15
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,660
we stand here divided.

16
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,763
Watch yourself, Jesse.

17
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,866
Abraham is trickier
than the devil in the shade.

18
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:58,770
And so,
on the challenge given

19
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,808
<i> to Abraham brant</i>
<i> from Jesse Kingston,</i>

20
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,811
in the way
of a Helena duel,

21
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,546
are we now assembled?

22
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,681
Take care of my boy
if I fall.

23
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,986
We will.

24
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,660
Gentlemen, come forward.

25
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:25,264
God made this world, Jesse,
and it pains me little

26
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,332
to send you from it.

27
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,806
You shall pour out
each other's blood

28
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,909
and we will cover it
with dust.

29
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:43,882
Whomever bleeds
the dirt red the most today,

30
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,952
his deeds shall not
be forgotten.

31
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,842
You distinguished yourself
honorably against
the Cheyenne.

32
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,978
It was the comanche
in my day.

33
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,049
Either or,
the most contemptible breed
of people, don't you agree?

34
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,385
Perhaps.

35
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:30,622
Or perhaps
they're misunderstood,
your honor.

36
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,525
I understand you have
a problem with a dead Mexican.

37
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,661
Ross:
<i> Not "a" dead Mexican,</i>
<i> Mr. Kingston.</i>

38
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,597
<i> Dozens.</i>

39
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,600
<i> The latest one is the nephew</i>
<i> of a Mexican general--</i>

40
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,802
<i> Ernesto Calderon.</i>

41
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:47,439
<i> He went missing</i>
<i> along with his sister</i>
<i> some time ago.</i>

42
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,442
<i> The general--</i>
<i> kicking up quite a fuss</i>
<i> about it.</i>

43
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,944
<i> He's threatening</i>
<i> to bring a battalion</i>
<i> of Mexican soldiers</i>

44
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,147
<i> across the border</i>
<i> to look for his niece</i>

45
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,082
<i> and the man who killed</i>
<i> his nephew.</i>

46
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,453
Now, I don't need to tell you,
wars have started over less.

47
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,955
Now, all the bodies
are turning up

48
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,525
in the same strainer
in the river...

49
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,193
About here.

50
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:12,097
It's roughly 12 miles
from mount hermon.

51
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,034
I take it you've heard
the name Abraham brant.

52
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,474
Foolhardy stories,
tales from the war, mostly.

53
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,076
They call him
the preacher,
i believe.

54
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:30,682
I saw him once in Kansas
just before the war.

55
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,919
The ranchers near Wichita
were offering 50¢

56
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,021
for every red scalp
that was turned in,

57
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:39,157
and brant showed up
with 1,000 of them.

58
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,626
Red, Mexican, negro--
it didn't matter,

59
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,563
as long as they had
dark hair and dark skin.

60
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,933
<i>And later, I saw him</i>
<i>preaching to half the town</i>

61
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:52,637
with a spirit
that I have neither
seen before nor since.

62
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,973
And as god
as my witness,

63
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,643
I saw him
lay his huge hand

64
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,513
on this gimpy
teenage girl.

65
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:05,016
And he cured her
with a touch,

66
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,552
<i>like Christ himself.</i>

67
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,825
Pardon me,
your honor, but--

68
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,161
but you'll have me
believe he simply
touched the girl

69
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,029
and she walked?

70
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,031
All the way
to the church.

71
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,767
Married her
the next day.

72
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,003
I'm assuming he resides
in mount hermon.

73
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,807
He<i> is</i> mount hermon,
captain.

74
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,076
Now you'll travel alone

75
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,778
under an assumed name
and profession.

76
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,715
Time is of the essence.
Calderon's blood is up.

77
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,683
Why not send me
with a company?

78
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,519
There's too much at stake.

79
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,788
You simply find out
if brant is at the root
of these killings

80
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,957
and wire me
from fort McIntosh.

81
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,594
Once certain,
i will commit in force.

82
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,600
How long?

83
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,239
I'm not sure.

84
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,775
I think it's best
not to presume this time.

85
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,211
You've only
just now returned.

86
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,883
What is it?

87
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,922
David?

88
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,563
The man
I'm inquiring upon...

89
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,032
Abraham brant is his name.

90
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,268
He may or may not
be responsible for
some terrible things.

91
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,337
It's my job
to determine which.

92
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,575
Go on.

93
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,877
By some...

94
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,684
Strange twist of fate,

95
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:49,854
brant happens to be
the same man that killed
my father 20 years ago.

96
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,093
Now, I know
what you're thinking,

97
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,330
but truth is,
men like brant have orphaned
hundreds of boys like me.

98
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,032
And it was
my father's challenge.

99
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,234
David,
you know as well as I,
you will go there

100
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,970
and you will kill
this man.

101
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,906
You don't know that.
You can't know that.

102
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,609
<i> Why else would you</i>
<i> be sharing this?</i>

103
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,611
<i> I've never once</i>
<i> heard you speak like this.</i>

104
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,047
I'm curious,
that's all.

105
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,952
They say he's been
touched by god.

106
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,293
Marisol, I'll go
where they send me.

107
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:32,030
It's not as if I've been
chasing this man
my entire life.

108
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,239
I can ride as well as you.
You taught me to track--

109
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,041
it's crazy talk.
We should change the subject.

110
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,709
You're gone more
than you're ever here.

111
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,978
What happened
to the tompkins woman

112
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,681
only a month ago
was south of Austin.

113
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,983
<i> And not just</i>
<i> some rogue straggler</i>
<i> we've somehow missed,</i>

114
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,286
but a band of Cheyenne
and comanchero.

115
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,255
Would you like me
to describe to you

116
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,958
exactly what they did
to that poor woman?

117
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,765
This is coming
from the governor himself.

118
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,768
<i> At least here,</i>
<i> we both know you're safe.</i>

119
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,739
Since you took me,
you come and you go.

120
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,742
I'm left here
with nothing to do.

121
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,312
There's the sheltons.
Donahues are less
than a mile.

122
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:35,460
Marisol, this is a job.
It's my work.

123
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,432
You can't expect me
to put you in that kind
of danger.

124
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,403
Then perhaps this time
when you return,

125
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,372
I will have left.

126
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,010
Excuse me.

127
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,393
You kill it,
you clean it.

128
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:18,356
Marisol:
You've never
spoken about him.

129
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,626
Do you miss him?

130
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,396
From all accounts,
Jesse Kingston was
recalcitrant and headstrong

131
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,932
and got what he deserved.

132
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,935
I figure he picked
the wrong fight.

133
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,539
What about you?

134
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,075
You ever miss old Javier?

135
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,344
You changed the subject.

136
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,320
It's impossible
to love someone

137
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,956
who hates their self
that much.

138
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
I miss nothing.

139
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,684
Morning, gentlemen.

140
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,523
Saw smoke.
Thought we'd see
to some lodgings,

141
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,659
rest our horses.

142
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:31,296
What brings y'all
this way?

143
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,998
We're on our way
to Ciudad Victoria.

144
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,434
The map at fort McIntosh
showed a town.

145
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,370
Mount hermon, I believe.

146
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,609
Someone had
the good sense
to chart it.

147
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,412
We figured we'd
practice the same good sense
to stop and make use.

148
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,714
She family or help?

149
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,954
My apologies.
My name is David Locke.

150
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,322
This is my wife Marisol.

151
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,694
Of course, if there's
some trouble in town,

152
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:06,097
we could return
to fort McIntosh
and pass on word for you.

153
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,504
You need to see
the preacher.

154
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,289
Put that down.

155
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,324
We have new guests.

156
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,560
They're asking for lodgings.

157
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,530
They shall have it.

158
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,366
Welcome to mount hermon.

159
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,739
From where is it
that you come?

160
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,775
Houston, sir,
by way of fort McIntosh.

161
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,411
My name is David Locke.
This is my wife Marisol.

162
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,619
I'm Abraham brant.

163
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,456
You've met my son Isaac.

164
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,195
He says welcome.

165
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,702
Abraham:
I am mount hermon's mayor
and law when there's need,

166
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:29,207
but I am unfailingly
the town's ethereal counselor.

167
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,808
Marisol,
are you religious?

168
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,510
I'm spiritual,

169
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,746
but I do not like
religion, sir.

170
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,382
Me neither.
And you, David?

171
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,585
My wife and i
are one and the same, sir.

172
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,520
<i>Please,</i>
<i>we are not formal here.</i>

173
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,857
"Abraham" works just fine.

174
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,695
- Abraham: Morning.
- Man: Morning, Abraham.

175
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,396
Here we are.

176
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,232
Make yourself at home.

177
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,800
Thank you, Abraham.

178
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,336
All we need now
is some rest.

179
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,204
I'll leave you to it.

180
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,639
<i> Buenas noches, Marisol.</i>

181
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,876
Mr. Locke.

182
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,524
We'll be here only as long
as we need to.

183
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,627
Just stick to the story,
let me do my job

184
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,662
and we can leave
this place,

185
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,764
just as easy
as we came in.

186
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,636
Okay?

187
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,504
Okay.

188
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,193
Morning, gentlemen.

189
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,827
Isaac:
What are you
doing out here?

190
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,665
I never let the sun
catch me sleeping.

191
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,334
And I enjoy acquainting myself
with any new place.

192
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,269
How'd you find your cabin?

193
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,971
It was fine, Abraham.
Thank you.

194
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:11,609
- And Marisol?
- She's tired, resting.

195
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:15,580
If she's unsatisfied,
i could drop off
another blanket,

196
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,615
<i>keep her warm.</i>

197
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:21,219
Well, it's a large bed.
I doubt you'd have a blanket
big enough.

198
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,758
Isaac, you go on
without me today.

199
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,994
Mr. Locke is going
to join me for breakfast.

200
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,963
Well, i-- I thought
we was going to go down--

201
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,298
do I need to hold
your hand, boy?

202
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,808
Forgive my friends, David.

203
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,645
Their charming qualities
don't shine through
at the outset.

204
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,650
<i>You strike me</i>
<i>as an educated man.</i>

205
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,019
I've managed to fool you.

206
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,956
You hide it
from your eyes well,

207
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,260
but it sits
on your shoulders
plain as day.

208
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,663
You are a man
in search of something.

209
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,966
<i>Perhaps absolution.</i>

210
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,968
You don't strike me
as the type

211
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,537
to hide his meaning
in vocabulary.

212
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,375
Indeed.

213
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:21,345
We don't get a lot
of uninvited guests this way.

214
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,982
So why are you here?

215
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,286
There's no real plan to it.

216
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,956
I inherited my father's
mercantile in San antone.

217
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,525
<i> I ran it for some years.</i>

218
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,595
Things got rough.
I was robbed, shot.

219
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:41,399
Both of us felt
it was time to move on,
head nowhere particular.

220
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,634
My wife's family
are in Ciudad Victoria.

221
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,369
We figured we'd strike out
in that direction,

222
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,406
stop in a place
if we took to it.

223
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,541
Not so strange,
is it?

224
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,811
Welcome
to nowhere particular.

225
00:21:56,015 --> 00:22:00,084
Can't say
it's the warmest welcome
I've ever received.

226
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:03,621
We're protective
of our little oasis.

227
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,557
How long
will you be staying?

228
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,793
Long enough to rest,
a few days.

229
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,565
Perhaps I can convince you
to stay awhile.

230
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,767
Why?
You've only just met me.

231
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,937
I know people.

232
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:25,109
And I can tell
that you're a man
one can tie to.

233
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:29,447
Perhaps I can help you find
what you're looking for.

234
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,618
I'd have no trade
in this town.

235
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,090
Well, let's just say
a spot for town sheriff

236
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:42,126
just opened up
at this very moment.

237
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:48,632
I get the feeling
there's not a strong
demand for law here.

238
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:52,403
- No.
-<i> And I have no experience.</i>

239
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,505
Well, what do you
need to know?

240
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,508
Just let your moral compass
be your guide.

241
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,478
<i>You're obviously</i>
<i>strong, capable.</i>

242
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,046
You're actually
being serious.

243
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,015
Look, David,

244
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,084
I like you and Marisol,

245
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,954
and I'd like to see you
stay awhile.

246
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,956
Not so strange.

247
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,725
No.

248
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,894
No, it's not.

249
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,430
Well, then,
it's settled.

250
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:22,032
Gentlemen,
meet your new sheriff.

251
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:34,979
Thought I might
continue my ride, take in
some of your countryside.

252
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,747
Splendid idea.

253
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,651
As it happens, I have
my own fond recollections

254
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:44,889
of the San antone area
from after the war.

255
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,657
Small town...

256
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,126
Name of Helena.

257
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,862
<i>Might have</i>
<i>passed through her</i>
<i>on your way here.</i>

258
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,431
Don't seem
to recall it.

259
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,603
Wild place
is what I recollect.

260
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,539
Hard to forget.

261
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,544
Well, sheriff,

262
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,679
pick yourself
a direction.

263
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,590
Welcome to
mount hermon,
Marisol.

264
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,125
We brought you both
some food.

265
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,794
And we just had to meet
the wife of the new sheriff.

266
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:33,030
- Sheriff?
- Did you have
a long journey here?

267
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,700
- Yeah, but--
-<i> you are more beautiful</i>
than was spoken of.

268
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,602
Who spoke?

269
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,388
You live round here?

270
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,693
I from tamaulipas.

271
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,831
Why have you come?

272
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,300
To pray for the dead.

273
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,802
You know about
the bodies?

274
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:25,342
Was it white men?

275
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:04,181
They knew things, David.

276
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,816
Who came?

277
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,985
Women from the town.

278
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,820
What did they want?

279
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:12,823
They said you were
the new sheriff,

280
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,893
that Abraham
foresaw us coming.

281
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,032
He did ask
that I be sheriff.

282
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,235
- But why on earth?
- I have no idea.

283
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,105
But I thought about it.

284
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:32,710
Really, it's the ideal cover
until I can figure out
what's going on here.

285
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,780
He frightens me, David.

286
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:39,416
He's a man, Marisol,
not a crystal gazer.

287
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,722
- No one knew
we were coming.
- Yeah.

288
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,758
These people, they're just
a bit off the reservation.

289
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,094
Make sure
you remember that.

290
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,181
Woman:
<i>Stop it.</i>

291
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,849
- Get away from me.
Now, now, wait.

292
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,285
Don't you walk away.
Come on.

293
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,988
<i>Don't you walk</i>
<i>away from me.</i>

294
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,189
<i>Where are you going?</i>

295
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:54,792
Come on, have a drink.
Naomi.

296
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:36,366
I'm terribly sorry
to have frightened you,
Marisol.

297
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,270
You're not feeling well.

298
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,075
No, I feel fine.

299
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,277
No, no, you have
the fever.

300
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,913
It's natural.
You're run down.

301
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,149
It will pass.

302
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,920
Can I give you a hand
with anything?

303
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,358
Are you married,
Abraham?

304
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,628
My wife died many years ago
birthing Isaac.

305
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,633
She left him
with many of her talents.

306
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:13,337
I'm sure
she was beautiful.

307
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,573
She could back the buzzards
off a gut wagon.

308
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:23,280
But truly, she was lovely.

309
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:27,284
There was never a more pure
heart to wreck a man.

310
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,923
So tell me,

311
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:36,393
how did you
come to wreck David?

312
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,298
My father was a drunk
and a swindler.

313
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,069
He was shot and left for dead
after cheating at cards.

314
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,572
David saw him
back to health.

315
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:52,476
As a show of gratitude,
i was betrothed to him
by my father.

316
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,280
Betrothed by debt?

317
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,949
<i> That must have been</i>
<i> very difficult for you.</i>

318
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,318
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

319
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,553
Any children?

320
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,026
I'm afraid I'm unable.

321
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:13,096
Mmm. My wife was told
the very same thing

322
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,332
before I met her.

323
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,405
Dark eyes.

324
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,342
<i> They say the eyes</i>

325
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,412
<i> provide a direct window</i>
<i> to the soul.</i>

326
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:33,050
Yours have seen a good deal
of man at his worst.

327
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:36,353
<i> You hold tight to it.</i>

328
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:41,358
But are we not all
born into sin,

329
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,264
anger, violence,
jealousy, desire?

330
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,967
We cannot separate
ourselves from sin

331
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:54,004
any more than we would sever
a limb from our bodies.

332
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:59,409
<i> Besides,</i>
<i> anger is instructive.</i>

333
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,578
<i> Jealousy, understandable.</i>

334
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,549
Lust, perfectly natural.

335
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,991
I can see that my words
are not lost on you, Marisol.

336
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,760
It is refreshing.

337
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:21,765
So few these days possess
any openness of mind.

338
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:26,603
But if I may, Marisol,
this veil that you wear

339
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,772
offers only false comfort.

340
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,374
Remove it.

341
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:34,111
God knows
who you really are.

342
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:43,687
Ah, deputy Dave!

343
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,655
What are you doing here?

344
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,158
Thought I might
get a drink.

345
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,028
Aw, you wouldn't
like it in here, David.

346
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,497
The beer tastes
like day-old piss.

347
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:57,734
Well, I guess
I'll drink the whiskey.

348
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:02,305
I don't think
you're hearing me, sheriff.

349
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,508
I'm telling you no.

350
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,450
I've tried to be
cordial with you.

351
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,486
You choose
your next words
carefully.

352
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,212
I heard the beer here
is excellent.

353
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,814
I've no complaints.

354
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,762
Might I join you?

355
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,730
Be my guest.

356
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:04,434
Hoot, let's have a shot
for the gentleman.

357
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,136
I'm Naomi.

358
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,571
David.

359
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,206
I know who you are.

360
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:13,176
Hoot his real name?

361
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:16,279
That's what I hear.

362
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,516
What else do you hear?

363
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,751
Whatever falls earshot.

364
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,324
You have an honest face.

365
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,862
I'm not soliciting you.
I know about your wife.

366
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,731
News travels fast.

367
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:38,368
This town echoes every word
Abraham breathes.

368
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,172
Stay here long enough
and you might start
resounding him, too.

369
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,773
What about you?

370
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,843
Not yet.

371
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,412
How long have you
been here?

372
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,814
Almost a year.

373
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,384
My second husband
was a lieutenant
in the army.

374
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:57,320
He was shot and killed
by his own men.

375
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,290
<i> I had no money,</i>
<i> no family, nowhere to go.</i>

376
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:05,729
Until hoot here
rides into town,
offers me a job.

377
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:09,599
Perhaps naively,
i didn't ask for specifics.

378
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,569
My condolences
for your losses, ma'am.

379
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:15,539
Thank you.

380
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,609
I've tried to make
the best of it.

381
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,445
Save a little money,

382
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,481
maybe move
to San Francisco.

383
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:27,317
Well, you're a long way
from California.

384
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,953
Believe me,
we're a long way
from anywhere.

385
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:33,256
Like these fellows?
Just rode in?

386
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,398
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Ma'am.

387
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,303
You're not safe.

388
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,271
I've tried
to leave this place.

389
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:51,808
Naomi, you gonna sit there
yabbering on my time,

390
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,445
head on back, help mailene
with the washing.

391
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,414
Be careful.

392
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:03,253
Hello there, gentlemen.
How are you?

393
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,692
Money's no good here, sheriff.
Abraham's pardoned
your expenses.

394
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,669
Abraham visited me
this morning.

395
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,342
Was he alone?

396
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,677
Yes.

397
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,847
<i>What did he want?</i>

398
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,250
Nothing.

399
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:36,653
We talked about his wife,
his travels.

400
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,788
We talked for hours.

401
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,269
What's wrong?

402
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,504
Nothing.

403
00:37:56,908 --> 00:38:00,343
I don't like him
coming here, Marisol.

404
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,513
What would you have me do?
I'm here on my own.

405
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,449
<i> I can't prevent him</i>
<i> from coming.</i>

406
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:17,494
Tomorrow, I think it's best
you come out there with me.

407
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,298
Isaac:
<i> You can stay if you like.</i>

408
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,501
Hoot'll start thinking
i have a boyfriend.

409
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,569
Don't worry yourself
about hoot.

410
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,440
What about your father?

411
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,409
What about him?

412
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:36,446
You think he knows
he's sharing me
with his own son?

413
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:39,582
You think you're something
fucking different

414
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,484
from them other whores
out there?

415
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,054
Do you?
You think you're something
fucking special?

416
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:46,022
That it?

417
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,692
You fucking biddie whore.

418
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:52,929
What happens
between you and me

419
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,864
stays that way.

420
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,068
Get the fuck out of here!

421
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,751
Headed somewhere?

422
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,687
It's a beautiful day
for a ride.

423
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,589
That it is.

424
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:22,759
Thought we might go down
and take a good look
at the river.

425
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:29,466
You'll enjoy that.
This is Naomi.

426
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:33,136
But I believe
you two already met.

427
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:38,541
Naomi, this is Marisol.

428
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,711
It's a pleasure, ma'am.

429
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,814
And you're
even more beautiful
than I was told.

430
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:49,419
Abraham:
<i> Just stopped by</i>
<i> to let you know</i>

431
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,888
I'll be holding a revival
at the chapel

432
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,524
<i> at 8:00 tomorrow morning.</i>

433
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:57,861
Naturally, you are more
than welcome to join us.

434
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,430
Thank you, Abraham.
We will consider it.

435
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:04,434
Very well, then.
We'll be on our way.

436
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,403
Enjoy your ride.

437
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,935
David?

438
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,939
Just stay there.

439
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,932
What's wrong?
What's happening?

440
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,935
Something's not right.

441
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:21,971
Man:<i> It's my pleasure, ma'am.</i>

442
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,973
<i> You take good care now.</i>

443
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,314
I left corn cure
by the bed.

444
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:34,884
You're going to have to
purchase more from portence
in a day or two.

445
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,986
Is it the fever?

446
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,956
Bed rest, corn cure.

447
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,091
Keep her hydrated.

448
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,993
Otherwise,
just leave her be.

449
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:48,698
Thank you
for coming, doctor.

450
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:54,671
He shall bless thy bread
and thy water

451
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:58,675
and he will take sickness
away from the midst of thee.

452
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:55,131
Abraham:
<i> God calls on you</i>

453
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,734
<i> to conquer your fear.</i>

454
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:09,412
Unshackle your faith.

455
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:15,385
The serpent is the darkness
inside your soul.

456
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,754
Your fear excites it.

457
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:21,991
Harness that fear

458
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,662
and embrace the power
within you.

459
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:30,433
<i> Fill yourself</i>
<i> with his spirit</i>

460
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:33,670
<i> and I will chase away</i>
<i> your demons.</i>

461
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:37,306
The spirit led you here.

462
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,876
You have nothing to fear.

463
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,113
Take it.

464
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:46,949
No, please.

465
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,052
Take it.

466
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,992
Behold...

467
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:59,395
Your faith,

468
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,765
even as tiny
as a mustard seed,

469
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,834
<i> can move mountains.</i>

470
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:09,338
This is the message
from the son of god!

471
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,442
The miracles I do,
you can do also.

472
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:16,379
<i> The power of god</i>
<i> is within you!</i>

473
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,716
All that is required
is that you believe.

474
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:25,455
Let us pray.

475
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:28,958
<i> Lord, we welcome you</i>
<i> amongst us this morning.</i>

476
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,295
<i> We ask that you</i>
<i> open our hearts...</i>

477
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,800
Whoa, what happened?

478
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:40,470
Come on.
Come on, sit down.
Come sit down.

479
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:43,840
The englishman--
he's drunk.

480
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,743
I was entertaining him
and then he grabbed his gun

481
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:48,778
and he tried to put it
inside me and then--

482
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,081
okay, it's all right.
Is he still there?

483
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,951
Okay, you don't move
from that chair
until I return.

484
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,464
Which one?

485
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,800
- Abraham handles
these matters--
- which fucking one?

486
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,401
Blue shirt in the corner.

487
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:20,042
Okay. Okay.

488
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:33,256
Really did
a number on you,
miss Naomi.

489
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:35,825
Who is he?
And the other two with him?

490
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:40,863
<i>Uh, they'd be guests</i>
<i>of Abraham.</i>

491
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:47,303
Not sure I'm going
to have enough thread
to stitch the other fellow.

492
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,243
Where is he?

493
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,286
You have no idea
what's going on here.

494
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:05,822
Ah, for this?

495
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:08,491
She's not worth
a lick or a--

496
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,364
Abraham will not
be pleased by this.

497
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,000
You run
to your father, then.

498
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:28,010
My sense is
he's taken quite a shine
to me being here.

499
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,545
You're mistaken.

500
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,581
It's that pretty
bean-eating wife of yours--

501
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:51,000
what are you gonna do?
I ain't heeled.

502
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,118
Get him out of here.

503
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,024
Get off!

504
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:18,027
Not bad for the son
of a shop clerk.

505
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,530
Show's over, dear friends.

506
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:25,167
Morris,
please see to Isaac.

507
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,538
I'm taking my wife home.

508
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,674
You see to Naomi.

509
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:35,144
I'll attend
to her every need.

510
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,690
<i> What were you thinking?</i>

511
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:51,193
"Corn cure and bed rest."

512
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:54,230
You heard it yourself.
Do you even wish to recover?

513
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,335
I never should have
let you come here.

514
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:07,410
What happened
to that woman?

515
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:10,246
She was beaten
in the brothel.

516
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:15,384
Is that why
you were fighting?

517
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:24,160
Guess that what happens
to pretty whores.

518
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:33,069
- Do you think
she's pretty?
- Stop it.

519
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,441
Abraham will take care
of her.

520
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:40,009
Will he?

521
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:41,577
He branded
that poor woman

522
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,112
when she tried
to leave this place--

523
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:44,513
- he wouldn't do that--
- damn it, Marisol!

524
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,415
I saw it myself!

525
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:51,487
Why are you speaking
about him like you know him?

526
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,325
All right.
Hey.

527
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,128
Hey, it's all right,
it's all right.

528
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,329
It's all right.

529
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:07,236
- - Isaac:<i> So easily you could</i>
<i> have stopped him today.</i>

530
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:11,540
You stood by
while he beat me.

531
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:14,210
You might have
stopped him yourself.

532
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,615
You tolerate him
for his woman.

533
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:21,450
She's yours.

534
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,786
Take her
and let's bury him.

535
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:31,761
If you could see
yourself...

536
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:37,066
Turned weak
over a pretty Mexican.

537
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,570
You are
your mother's son.

538
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,610
Are you so ashamed?

539
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:51,247
Am I not as god
has made me to be?

540
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:55,484
God, maybe,

541
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,086
but not me.

542
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,272
You go ahead,
gentlemen.

543
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:19,508
I'll catch up
with you at hoot's.

544
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,243
Morning.

545
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,648
More uninvited guests?

546
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:32,188
Fascinating culture,
the Chinese.

547
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,326
They say they are
trapped in the samsara,

548
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:41,864
ever-changing world
of good and evil.

549
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:47,837
If they don't take control
of their desires,

550
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,107
they are subject
to great suffering

551
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:54,743
in this life
and the next.

552
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:57,213
I didn't have the heart
to tell them

553
00:51:57,215 --> 00:52:00,583
that heathens be damned
to hell regardless.

554
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:04,820
What desires could
they possibly find out here?

555
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:10,392
You're feeling
off-color today.

556
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:15,197
Short time
I've been here,

557
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,435
I've seen englishmen
and now chinamen.

558
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:21,437
Curious, no?

559
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:26,375
And yet I haven't seen
a single Mexican man or woman.

560
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,410
We aren't but a few miles
from Mexico.

561
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,179
Why is that?

562
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,215
Perhaps they're scared.

563
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,718
Why would they be scared?

564
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:45,394
Because on this side
of the river,

565
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:48,297
they're no longer Mexican.

566
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:52,168
Not everybody possesses
our sensibilities, David.

567
00:52:57,241 --> 00:53:00,910
There something more
you feel the need to ask me,
sheriff Locke?

568
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,484
I guess it don't matter.

569
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:11,487
Be leaving soon enough.

570
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,656
Will you?

571
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:16,292
Didn't find
what you were looking for?

572
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:19,295
As soon as
Marisol's fever breaks,
we'll be on our way.

573
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:21,664
Nowhere particular?

574
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,808
What does that mean?

575
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:36,245
"I'll embrace your company
while I have it."

576
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:32,768
How long
have I been asleep?

577
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,441
Most of yesterday
and today.

578
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,846
I saw you
in the river.

579
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:57,359
It's the fever.

580
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:00,696
- It's made you delirious.
- You're not listening to me.

581
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:03,832
There's something
twisting in me.

582
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:06,068
Morris says
just a few days.

583
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,771
- Why are you not listening?
- Because you're not
thinking straight.

584
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:13,342
No! I see it all
so clear.

585
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:16,679
You just took me

586
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,080
when he gave me away.

587
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:21,583
You never asked.

588
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:24,620
You think I'm crazy,
but I had no say in it.

589
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:26,755
All I think is that right now
you're not yourself.

590
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:28,857
You're very ill.

591
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:33,529
I need to see Abraham.

592
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:35,798
Can you send for him,
please?

593
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,499
- No.
- Please.

594
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,501
He's the only one
that can help us, David.

595
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:42,104
God damn it.
Help with what? How?

596
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:45,474
<i>You don't know Abraham.</i>
<i>You know me.</i>

597
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:48,110
And I'm right here.
I can help you.

598
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:51,013
He's put you in the river,

599
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,981
like he did to your father.

600
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,586
And you can't hear me.

601
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,367
I'm leaving.

602
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:24,646
I know you didn't
just stumble into town
for no reason.

603
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:27,383
I can help you,
but you need to
come with me.

604
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,884
Help me how?
What do you know?

605
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,387
Everyone here
knows what happens.

606
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,056
And they will kill you
when you least expect it.

607
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,557
- Just come in
and talk--
- no.

608
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,926
Listen, your wife's
already gone.

609
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,796
- She was gone the moment
you brought her here--
- that is enough of that.

610
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,865
Okay? I can protect you.
Just talk to me.

611
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:46,835
I have to go now.
Ride to the first Ridge
this side of the river.

612
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,971
You'll see what
you're looking for there.

613
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:51,173
I'll meet you
at the split-fork crossing.

614
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,175
I'll wait there
an hour for you.

615
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,778
Naomi, wh-- Naomi!

616
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:59,415
God damn it.

617
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,496
Three miles?

618
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,902
Can you help me, please?

619
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:29,271
I need to see Abraham.

620
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:30,239
Abraham!

621
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:40,148
Abraham, help me.
Something's really wrong.

622
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,017
Where is your husband?

623
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,553
Last I seen,
he was painting his nose
down at hoot's

624
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:47,022
with that spud-nigger whore
Naomi.

625
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:02,571
Please, I don't know
what to do.

626
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:06,975
Silas, see she gets home
and stay by her side until
the sheriff returns.

627
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:10,746
- Ladies, you fetch
Dr. Morris.
- Yes.

628
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:13,248
If you were mine,
Marisol,

629
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,685
I'd not leave your side
for anything.

630
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,705
Why, I recall,

631
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:40,709
at bull run,
i led my militia
through a wall

632
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:45,681
of advancing
blue-belly fire
entirely unscathed.

633
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:48,684
- "How so?"
One might ask.

634
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:55,657
But, friends, this is
divine conviction at work.

635
00:59:55,659 --> 01:00:00,896
I tell you, we left
even general Lee
speechless.

636
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:03,665
You met general Lee?

637
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:09,371
Oh, it was a magnificent day
to behold.

638
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:13,075
My men killed
more yankee malefactor

639
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:18,280
than that milksop
bedford forrest's
entire regiment.

640
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:23,251
I believe he referred to us
as his "hangman militia."

641
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:35,030
Did you kill
many men, Abraham?

642
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:43,238
The faces of those
we've killed

643
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,074
remains hidden

644
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:48,777
behind our eyes

645
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:52,981
and our memory
for eternity,

646
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,283
without change.

647
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:01,256
There's no labor
in killing a man.

648
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,793
But for some,
it's living after
that's work.

649
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,831
You carry
the burden of many.

650
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,734
So should you.

651
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:15,904
<i>Mrs. Naomi Ellis,</i>
<i>for one.</i>

652
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,149
My reflection
is murderous,

653
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:28,417
but my conscience
is clean.

654
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:33,689
Your wife...

655
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:47,402
- No, st-- shh.
- Ah!

656
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,337
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm here.

657
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:51,039
Calm down, calm down.

658
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,942
I'm here.
I'm here.

659
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:26,441
David?

660
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:31,213
You're leaving me again.

661
01:02:36,053 --> 01:02:38,987
I saw something
yesterday, Marisol.

662
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:55,537
We're leaving tonight.

663
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:58,039
I'll be back
before dark.

664
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:41,016
Gentlemen...

665
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:43,118
Pick your prey.

666
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:09,444
That one.

667
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:11,012
The woman?

668
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,948
You are twisted,
brother.

669
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:16,318
There you are.

670
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:24,359
The boy.

671
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:54,923
Gentlemen,
make your preparations.

672
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:56,284
Shh, shh, shh.

673
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,350
<i> Vámonos.</i>

674
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:16,064
Don't look like<i> abuelito</i>
is going to give you
much of a hunt.

675
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,102
Just the same.

676
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,546
Man:<i> Whoo!</i>

677
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:57,572
Ah!

678
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:09,717
Go ahead, give her
another one.

679
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:35,243
Abraham:
<i> Good job, son.</i>

680
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:48,756
You gotta take
the scalp, George.

681
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:51,626
<i> Nothing to it--</i>
<i> quick slit and a pull.</i>

682
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:57,465
Isaac:
<i> I guarantee you,</i>
<i> she'd take yours.</i>

683
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,868
They're as wild
as injuns.

684
01:09:30,934 --> 01:09:33,601
Whoohoo!

685
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:37,605
<i>Whoo!</i>

686
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:46,514
Abraham:
You bury her good,
now, Isaac.

687
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,349
I will.

688
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:27,749
Man:
...The sins...

689
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:37,859
Marisol?

690
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:41,462
Marisol?

691
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,765
Move, get out of the way!
Move!

692
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:48,403
The hell are you doing
to my wife?!

693
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:52,073
She's no longer yours, David.

694
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,676
Take him.

695
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,851
Let god in you.

696
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,962
Keys.

697
01:12:22,072 --> 01:12:23,571
Get up.

698
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:37,652
Open this door.

699
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:43,858
I missed
the first five shots.

700
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,961
I mean, I must have picked
the quickest Mexican out of
the whole bloody bunch.

701
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:49,030
Mine damn near
got to the river!

702
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,966
Monte said that's the farthest
any Mexican ever made it!

703
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:55,603
God damn it,
that was a hell
of a time.

704
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,043
What do you figure
on doing with that?

705
01:13:11,955 --> 01:13:15,123
You two put
your fucking guns
down slowly.

706
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:23,564
Everyone sit up.

707
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,901
You and you,
take everyone's pistols
and put them over there.

708
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:39,947
You killed my son.

709
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:45,119
I hear your wife's sick.

710
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,001
What are you going
to do?

711
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:03,104
I'm going to sit
and wait.

712
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,975
<i>You paid good money</i>
<i>to come here, right?</i>

713
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,980
How much were
those Mexicans worth?

714
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:20,988
How much?

715
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,890
200 a hunt.

716
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:24,959
$200 per hunt!

717
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,862
And that's
what you call it?

718
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:29,597
Hunting?

719
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:32,233
No, please.

720
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:37,071
Why are you here,
old man?

721
01:14:39,209 --> 01:14:41,542
Because we wanted
to kill something.

722
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:44,545
Something or someone?

723
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:46,614
Someone.

724
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:51,085
We wanted to know
what it felt like
to kill someone.

725
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:55,823
Well, I'm gonna
let you kill.

726
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,526
And I ain't even
gonna charge you for it.

727
01:15:09,772 --> 01:15:12,640
You're gonna pick up
that pistol

728
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:16,277
and shoot monte
in his ugly fucking face...

729
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,581
Or I'm gonna
shoot your father dead.

730
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,888
In fact, go on
and shoot Dale, too.

731
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,990
I don't much
like his face either.

732
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:35,696
Pick up the pistol,
killer.

733
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:42,003
Pick it up!

734
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:56,717
Don't do it, John.

735
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,586
<i>Come on, son.</i>

736
01:15:58,588 --> 01:16:01,589
Come on, he--
he's fooling with you, John.

737
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:06,561
- Please.
- One!

738
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:48,336
You say one word
and I'll blow your
fucking head off.

739
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:03,618
Where is my wife?

740
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,825
Where she belongs.

741
01:17:14,831 --> 01:17:19,033
You can go right ahead
and put that old coach gun
down now, mister.

742
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,869
Aw, I figure I won't.

743
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:24,205
It's all right, boys.

744
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:28,743
I feel Mr. Kingston is due
a modicum of self-expression

745
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:31,112
<i> under the circumstances.</i>

746
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:34,148
Kingston?

747
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:38,753
I've known for quite some time
you'd be coming for me, David.

748
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:43,190
I took pleasure
in killing your father.

749
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:46,394
He was an abhorrent man.

750
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:50,431
If you think I'm here
to avenge my father,

751
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:53,167
you think too highly
of yourself.

752
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:57,171
<i>You're nothing more to me</i>
<i>than youthful intrigue.</i>

753
01:17:58,274 --> 01:17:59,774
I'm a Texas ranger.

754
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:01,242
I was sent
by the governor himself.

755
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:04,111
All those Mexicans
you've been killing

756
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:06,681
<i>been floating into a strainer</i>
<i>a couple miles downriver.</i>

757
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:09,917
<i>One was general Calderon's</i>
<i>own nephew.</i>

758
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:19,460
Well, I must say

759
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:24,131
all this news
is shocking, David.

760
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,437
Though it seems you have
some bad information.

761
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,139
<i> You see,</i>
<i> we bury the bodies.</i>

762
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:36,277
Mexicans,
shit that they are,

763
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:39,380
<i> decompose rather quickly.</i>

764
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:43,117
How dirty did you get
that shovel today, Isaac?

765
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:50,157
Don't listen to him, father.
You're a fucking liar.

766
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,393
I followed you today,
you piece of shit.

767
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:55,129
How long you think before
they find that scalpless girl

768
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:56,731
<i> you dumped in the river?</i>

769
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,501
Father, i--
i can explain.

770
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:03,938
Father, can't you--
can't you see what he's doing?

771
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,207
I tell you, he's--
he's lying.

772
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:10,311
You are as crippled
as your mother was.

773
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:26,927
I suppose I'll have to
try again with the new wife.

774
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:30,297
I'll shoot you dead before
you ever touch her again.

775
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:35,136
I have to say,
as much as I respect
your confidence, David,

776
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:38,305
I also respect when a man
can appreciate

777
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:40,908
his fate staring him
in the face.

778
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:44,478
You have hoot's rifle
pointing at your head, son.

779
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,015
I figure
I'm a better shot
than hoot.

780
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:10,337
Your pugnacious pappy
would have loved to hear that.

781
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:13,073
- Abraham?
- I say he's bluffing.

782
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:16,210
- Father, may I have
a moment?
- No!

783
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:26,987
Isaac:
<i> David Kingston...</i>

784
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:34,261
I challenge you
to fight me to the death

785
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:36,964
in a Helena duel.

786
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,173
My boy.

787
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,044
Let me do this, pa.

788
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:00,921
Let me help you up, son.

789
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:06,260
David?

790
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:11,465
I'll do it
on one condition.

791
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:16,403
When it's done,
my wife leaves here with me.

792
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,575
Put your guns away,
gentlemen.

793
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:24,311
<i> There'll be</i>
<i> no more shooting today.</i>

794
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:39,627
Abraham:
We'll meet outside, 8:00.

795
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:56,577
Abraham:
<i> Good people of mount hermon,</i>

796
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:01,181
<i> you're about to witness</i>
<i> a Helena duel.</i>

797
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,517
Mr. Kingston.

798
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:12,126
A most noble affair

799
01:22:12,128 --> 01:22:14,194
of character and honor.

800
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:21,402
I took David's father
with this knife

801
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:24,238
over 20 years ago.

802
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,174
The one he now grips
is stained with my blood

803
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:30,144
from that same duel

804
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:34,949
and now will surely
drip red with my son's.

805
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,621
<i> If Isaac lives,</i>

806
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:44,992
he will be forgiven
his ill-considered behavior

807
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:47,494
and he will undoubtedly
be the better man

808
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:50,230
for what he experiences
here tonight.

809
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:54,969
Does me proud.

810
01:22:57,974 --> 01:23:00,140
If David is Victor,

811
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:04,378
<i> then in fairness,</i>
<i> he will be taken to his wife</i>

812
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,081
and she will decide
their fate.

813
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:11,085
On this, you have my word.
Gentlemen, come together.

814
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:20,494
You shall pour out
each other's blood...

815
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:25,132
And we will cover it
with dust.

816
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:43,117
Begin.

817
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:07,775
Ah!

818
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:58,192
- Marisol?
- Shh.

819
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:04,631
You'll pull your stitches out
and bleed everywhere.

820
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:09,703
We can go home now.

821
01:25:25,588 --> 01:25:29,790
Abraham:
<i> "Dark eyes burning,</i>
<i> in the night they glow.</i>

822
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:32,693
<i> She knows only yearning.</i>

823
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:35,829
<i> What else is there</i>
<i> to know?"</i>

824
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:38,599
That's beautiful, David.

825
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,704
And that's a lovely drawing.

826
01:25:43,706 --> 01:25:46,740
You are one surprise
after another.

827
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,548
You've been busy
when no one was watching.

828
01:25:57,386 --> 01:25:59,653
Thank you for sharing,
Marisol.

829
01:26:01,457 --> 01:26:03,624
He wanted us to escape.

830
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:06,260
Abraham:
<i> Did he, now?</i>

831
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:12,232
Well, we're going to give you
that chance, David.

832
01:26:12,234 --> 01:26:15,169
These three men have yet
to experience

833
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,304
the thrill of the hunt.

834
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:22,543
I've decided to afford them
this one unique opportunity.

835
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:24,578
<i> Obviously,</i>
<i> you're disadvantaged,</i>

836
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,880
so we'll give you
till first light tomorrow.

837
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:29,716
The time until then
is yours.

838
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:34,254
<i> I've given you a rifle</i>
<i> and a generous amount</i>
<i> of shells.</i>

839
01:26:34,256 --> 01:26:35,722
Gentlemen?

840
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:49,536
Please get him
dressed and fed.

841
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,920
Please put this on.

842
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,891
Marisol?

843
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:13,260
Why are you doing this?

844
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,271
Marisol?

845
01:31:24,913 --> 01:31:27,214
You are not
from the town.

846
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:32,085
What is your name?

847
01:31:32,087 --> 01:31:33,887
David Kingston.

848
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,990
I'm a ranger.

849
01:31:39,761 --> 01:31:41,995
I am Maria.

850
01:31:44,132 --> 01:31:46,833
Maria Calderon.

851
01:31:49,538 --> 01:31:51,938
Your uncle's
looking for you.

852
01:32:03,785 --> 01:32:05,752
Thank you.

853
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:17,163
Best get on now,
miss Calderon.

854
01:32:26,174 --> 01:32:29,743
How do you know
he would've come
this way?

855
01:32:29,745 --> 01:32:33,079
I've known
where this boy's been
headed his entire life.

856
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:35,315
He was wounded
something fierce
from the fight.

857
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:37,684
Probably dead
anyway.

858
01:32:37,686 --> 01:32:41,788
I assure you,
gentlemen, he is not.

859
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:44,190
Whoa, whoa.

860
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:02,909
- Shit! Shit!

861
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,911
He ain't dead!
God damn it!

862
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:07,581
- Clem:<i> God damn it!</i>
- Silas:<i> Get your head down!</i>

863
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,785
- Hoot:<i> I knew it, I knew it.</i>
- Clem:<i> Shit!</i>

864
01:33:11,787 --> 01:33:12,919
Hoot:
<i> Son of a bitch.</i>

865
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:18,592
What are we going
to do, Abraham?

866
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:23,930
Shit!
There goes the horses.

867
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:26,166
We gotta go back.
We can't stay here.

868
01:33:26,168 --> 01:33:28,735
Please,
i-- I can't fight.

869
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:30,203
I can't-- i--

870
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,818
oh! Ah!

871
01:36:00,188 --> 01:36:02,222
Ah!

872
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:15,929
Ah, fuck.

873
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:40,146
I'm guessing
you didn't foresee this.

874
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:06,439
You should thank me
for taking your father.

875
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:10,677
<i> You were born that day.</i>

876
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:15,982
<i> If he raised you,</i>
<i> you would not be the man</i>
<i> you've become.</i>

877
01:39:15,984 --> 01:39:21,955
Our entire lives
spent denying death
its dominion.

878
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:24,390
<i> Seems its answer</i>
<i> for us will be...</i>

879
01:39:24,392 --> 01:39:27,226
Painful and slow.

880
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:32,131
We deserve it
for all we've done.

881
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:36,736
Futile to toil
over such things.

882
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:39,572
Forces you
to look inward

883
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:44,410
and examine
the monster you truly are.

884
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:49,248
Don't go exempting
yourself.

885
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:52,418
You'll answer the same
as everyone else.

886
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,654
David, I was never born

887
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:58,591
nor will I ever truly die.

888
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,595
Aw, you'll die, all right.

889
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:05,231
You'll die right here.

890
01:40:06,434 --> 01:40:09,002
Your leg will swell.

891
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:12,538
You'll scream
and try to kill yourself
to save the pain.

892
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:15,008
<i>The stench will lead them</i>
<i>to our bodies in a week</i>

893
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:17,276
<i>and this scene will show</i>
<i>what I have made of you.</i>

894
01:40:18,646 --> 01:40:21,748
Word will spread
of your death.

895
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:24,784
They'll hiss your name,
call you a murderous
son of a bitch

896
01:40:24,786 --> 01:40:26,552
and a fraud.

897
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:36,029
The only thing
they'll remember of you

898
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:38,131
will be me.

899
01:42:30,445 --> 01:42:32,812
Men:
Get him! Get him!

900
01:42:35,383 --> 01:42:36,782
Yes!

901
01:43:03,444 --> 01:43:05,411
Abraham:
<i> I made you.</i>

902
01:43:06,581 --> 01:43:08,814
And so I end you.

903
01:43:50,925 --> 01:43:53,459
Calderon:
You did send your rangers
out to the town

904
01:43:53,461 --> 01:43:55,695
to corroborate the stories
that my niece gave you

905
01:43:55,697 --> 01:43:57,630
along with the prisoners?

906
01:43:57,632 --> 01:44:00,399
The-- the town
was abandoned.

907
01:44:00,401 --> 01:44:02,335
And the prison?

908
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:05,304
It doesn't appear
to exist.

909
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:11,277
<i> Did your niece</i>
<i> say anything else</i>

910
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:15,748
<i> regarding David Kingston</i>
<i> or his wife?</i>

911
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:18,684
Calderon:
<i>She said he was badly wounded</i>
<i>when he freed the prisoners</i>

912
01:44:18,686 --> 01:44:23,289
<i>and he rode out</i>
<i>into the brush alone,</i>

913
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:25,891
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

914
01:44:25,893 --> 01:44:28,461
<i>But she made no mention</i>
<i>of a woman.</i>

915
01:44:29,964 --> 01:44:32,365
Perhaps you will allow me
a small detail

916
01:44:32,367 --> 01:44:33,833
<i>to go out</i>
<i>and search for him.</i>

917
01:44:33,835 --> 01:44:36,469
I don't think so, general.

918
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:40,640
He rode off into the brush
for a reason.

919
01:44:40,642 --> 01:44:44,577
<i> If he wants to,</i>
<i> he'll ride back out again.</i>
