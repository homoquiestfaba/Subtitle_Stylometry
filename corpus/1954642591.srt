1
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:14,755
Last
Voices echoed in my mind

2
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:16,846
when I took my son

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,960
to my old school.

4
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:20,459
Did revive him

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,663
one magical time of my life.

6
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:24,164
Back to the time

7
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:26,067
where my life was full of

8
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,500
innocence of youth.

9
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:29,070
My childhood dream

10
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,102
was to be a great

11
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:32,139
basketball player,
as well as my father.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,573
He was my hero, my companion
,

13
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:38,010
the best friend that a
child could have.

14
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:39,745
But he was more here.

15
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:42,064
His death was a hard reminder


16
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:44,450
That life is a fleeting shadow
,

17
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,587
every moment is a precious gift

18
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,689
to be shared with anyone.

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,523
Wanted to express my son

20
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:53,294
feelings and
fondest memories

21
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:55,094
a wonderful childhood.

22
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:58,165
For, somehow inspire you
to see through my eyes,

23
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,699
and help you understand

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,335
that via the pull
patience and persistence,

25
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:03,169
dreams are possible.

26
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,306
This was the legacy left by my father

27
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:08,139
for over thirty years.

28
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,997
CLENSOM, CAROLINA SOUTH
, 1959

29
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:47,043
PISTOL A LEGEND IS BORN

30
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:37,383
I remember like it was yesterday
.

31
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:40,386
Was the beginning of an incredible journey
.

32
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:43,657
The year that would change my life forever...

33
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,028
and define the course
my destination.

34
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:49,528
1958 was a period innocent,

35
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,530
of hope and change in America.

36
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:55,501
A time when
thought that everything would be possible.

37
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:58,470
At least, that's how
in their Maravich.

38
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:01,608
I like that! A young
with confidence.

39
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:03,442
We made an election at school.

40
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:04,376
Who won?

41
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:07,369
Nixon. I voted for JFK.

42
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:09,514
Like his father,

43
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:11,183
Always voting on the weaker.

44
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:13,986
Weaker?
With Jack Kennedy

45
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:16,390
we build houses on the moon in 1970

46
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,656
and you know why?

47
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:19,994
Because he has confidence. -Confidence.

48
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:22,094
Let Pete coffee, Press.

49
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:24,164
Many things will change in the next decade.

50
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,131
Dad was an optimist and a genius

51
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:28,569
to create ways of stimulating my confidence.

52
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,870
I was watching Gene Autry other day

53
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:33,138
and suddenly realized

54
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,109
a good basketball player

55
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,142
can get along just fine

56
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:40,612
if so fast
as a gunman.

57
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:41,914
I'll show you.

58
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:44,184
Give me the ball.
Get up Peter.

59
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:46,420
I will teach an exercise.

60
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,410
Turn around.

61
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:49,223
Lower your arms.

62
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,213
This.

63
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,559
Now, do not pay attention to me
.

64
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,126
I want to focus.

65
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:56,028
Now estufe the chest!

66
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:57,160
Not want to think

67
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:58,901
which is a weakling.

68
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,223
This shoulders in place.

69
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:06,394
Now when I
drop this ball.

70
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:08,509
Want beat palms in front

71
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,460
and take the ball
behind you.

72
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:14,313
But need to focus.

73
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:16,081
Hear my voice.

74
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:17,116
Do not listen to me.

75
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:18,547
Do not listen to me.

76
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:21,329
This is impossible.

77
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:23,046
Impossible?

78
00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:26,425
We will see their hands
gunman, ok?

79
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:27,686
Okay, Helen.

80
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,730
Well, do not pay attention to me
, Press.

81
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:41,340
You "found" that
could do.

82
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:46,142
I "knew" that I would
. Trust!

83
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:00,025
But Dad's inspiration

84
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:02,094
not change the fact that in school

85
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:04,295
I was a misfit,

86
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,599
a lonely boy with big dreams.

87
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,301
But this country was not founded

88
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,367
by ordinary people who dared to believe

89
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:14,039
That big dreams come true?

90
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,641
That's what I was taught.

91
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:18,912
With liberty and justice for all.

92
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:27,985
Okay.
Today we talk about dreams.

93
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:31,957
More specifically,
the American dream.

94
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,293
The American Dream is a concept

95
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:38,868
and a belief that anything is possible.

96
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:41,660
What dreams do you have today?

97
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:45,139
Who would you like to be?

98
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:47,072
I want to write

99
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:50,008
in 200 words
By the end of class,

100
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,449
what are your dreams for the future.

101
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:55,377
Any questions?

102
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,151
Okay, can begin.

103
00:07:59,152 --> 00:08:02,289
How could put
a dream into words?

104
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,556
Something went
in my heart?

105
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,326
When I was in eighth grade,

106
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:08,360
all we wanted was to be a great

107
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:11,330
basketball player,
as my father.

108
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:14,134
But with 1.60
tall and 40 pounds,

109
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:15,675
who would believe?

110
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:20,372
I think only my father and I
believed at first.

111
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:22,407
When I was not on the court,

112
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:25,412
everything you thought was that there was another boy

113
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:27,903
practicing more than me.

114
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,284
And he could
scholarship

115
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:32,317
should be mine,

116
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:35,168
If I do not try harder.

117
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:38,744
Yes, Peter?

118
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:40,257
I need...

119
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:30,442
Boy, you do not
should be in class?

120
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:31,633
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,663
I hope you today at 15:30,

122
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:37,414
to deal with the problem.

123
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:40,988
I figured when Dad knew

124
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:42,954
I killed lesson

125
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:45,324
he would give me his famous spanking,

126
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:49,595
or let me grounded
for life.

127
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,964
No, no, no! Wait!

128
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:59,706
You need to take the guy
until the barrier.

129
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:02,909
Exit barrier. Stuck!

130
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:08,142
Skin with skin.

131
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,683
Understand? Yes, sir.

132
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:14,604
Okay, let
again.

133
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,988
!

134
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:24,933
Everyone here!

135
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:27,601
Dad was an official
retired navy,

136
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,503
a hero of World War II

137
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,336
is a very serious man,

138
00:10:31,337 --> 00:10:33,006
when he came to inspire and train students

139
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,787
Clemson College.

140
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,910
According to Dad, the way to play

141
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:39,011
basketball reflected how

142
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,113
that person would live his life.

143
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,749
His teams knew well your opinion.

144
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,710
When he spoke, everyone listened
.

145
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:49,656
I'm not spending precious moments

146
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:51,723
of my life
to teach them

147
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:53,627
To throw a ball in a basket
.

148
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:57,414
This here is a
lifestyle.

149
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,243
I want the players to think,

150
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,241
work, to sweat, have challenges

151
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:04,204
and discipline because the other things

152
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:10,131
has no value.

153
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,514
The problem with you guys,

154
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,445
is that they are a bunch of goons
,

155
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,846
who think they know everything.

156
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:23,581
Give me the ball.

157
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:33,661
You see this ball?

158
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,101
Size of this sphere

159
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:39,892
represents everything
know about basketball,

160
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,042
but the size of this ball is

161
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:48,693
everything that has not been discovered
about the game.

162
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,986
This point is all
you know. Together!

163
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:06,498
If forget the girls
and the cars,

164
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:09,269
and hear me, will get things never

165
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,169
thought possible.

166
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,739
Do not care if you
is low, slow,

167
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,172
thin or high.

168
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,874
Can play with the best.

169
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,244
<i>engaging maximum
you to perfect</i>

170
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:20,714
Now we train these
played again, folks.

171
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:22,565
Let's do it right.

172
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:29,211
!

173
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,960
That's it! That's what I!

174
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,232
That afternoon I had to face

175
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,863
the wrath of Vern Pendleton,

176
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:42,954
The high school coach.

177
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:44,671
You is small for a Maravich.

178
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:46,571
His mother feeds you well?

179
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:47,762
Yes, sir.

180
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:50,404
Has pedigree.

181
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:52,829
I think you will not be

182
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,646
a star football,

183
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,681
but might play basketball.

184
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:58,322
Do not use moccasin.

185
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:02,453
What? Well, you know

186
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:05,425
my assistant, Carl
Cannfield the cafeteria?

187
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:06,289
I know.

188
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:09,394
It delivers the equipment in the locker room.

189
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:11,375
Your closet is 41.

190
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:13,365
Let's start in 2 minutes.

191
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,230
How?

192
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:15,933
Want to train

193
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:17,137
With the team principal, do not you?

194
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:18,002
I want.

195
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:20,438
Go get dressed, then.

196
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:22,075
If you are waiting for me
it late.

197
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,266
Come on, come on!

198
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:25,444
It was my big chance!

199
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:27,312
Training with the first team!

200
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:29,114
But my big chance

201
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,483
was also the beginning of
major problems.

202
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:33,063
Different people do not always

203
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,653
are received from
open arms.

204
00:13:34,654 --> 00:13:38,291
On the first day of training
I do not I integrated.

205
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:40,225
Not got the right equipment.

206
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,854
Carl! Carl!

207
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,532
Whatever here?

208
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,793
I will train with the team.

209
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,944
So hurry up, let's start
already.

210
00:13:58,945 --> 00:14:02,073
The protector is very large.

211
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:04,249
It is very big!
I need a minor.

212
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,148
How?

213
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,452
Lions!

214
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:18,096
Oh, you need
less chill!

215
00:14:18,097 --> 00:14:20,965
Come on!

216
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,067
30 free throws.

217
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,918
The training begins within 5 minutes.

218
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:32,277
He is the son of
Maravich coach?

219
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,180
Is. I do not know what the
my father has in mind

220
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,415
to let him train.

221
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,016
It is hard.

222
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,683
Have you seen this guy
in the hallways?

223
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:41,186
Always walking with a
basketball.

224
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:43,121
It is a strange boy
, Sandy.

225
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:45,942
He deserves credit for trying,

226
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,528
Courageous boy.

227
00:14:57,537 --> 00:14:58,663
Come on!

228
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:02,073
The record of wins and losses

229
00:15:02,074 --> 00:15:04,075
was all that mattered to the technician.

230
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:06,378
While the Lions continue winning,

231
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,114
he would never put me
in the game.

232
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:10,916
I realized that the chances of occupying

233
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:14,219
the place of a holder
practically non-existent.

234
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,855
And if it were up to Buddy,

235
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,422
the son of
Technical Pendleton,

236
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:20,863
I never put the Peach the court.

237
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:24,230
Buddy Pendleton comes down with the ball,

238
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:27,465
sewing,

239
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,350
Rises to the pan, and scores!

240
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:34,972
It was not convinced.

241
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,508
It was the confidence that told me

242
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,378
I could play better than others.

243
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,264
Trust that had to do

244
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:42,080
my father exercises

245
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:45,383
for more than 10,000 hours,
since I was 5 years old.

246
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:48,053
Dad helped me develop the discipline
,

247
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:51,089
dedication and the desire
that led me to believe

248
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,592
that could take the place of any
a team,

249
00:15:53,593 --> 00:15:56,343
even Buddy Pendleton .

250
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:58,293
If not for Carl Cannfield
,

251
00:15:58,294 --> 00:16:00,532
I'd be totally bored.

252
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:03,268
While others
celebrated the victories

253
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,796
got tired of sitting,

254
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,342
wondering when would chance

255
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,743
to participate in a game.

256
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:19,986
Hey, champ,
passes the pliers.

257
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,797
It's there in the box.

258
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:24,069
Thank you.

259
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,463
Looking from up the basket seems
that can hit any pitch.

260
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:33,624
I wanted to have this time!

261
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:35,687
No kidding!

262
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,873
You know, one time a guy told me

263
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,207
I had a screw loose

264
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,510
when I said I wanted to be professional
.

265
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:46,478
Really?

266
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:51,180
Yeah, he did not even want
watch me play.

267
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:54,125
Play the ball here.

268
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:59,157
When you are down there

269
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:00,725
everything seems difficult.

270
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:04,162
It's like fighting
windmills.

271
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:06,143
Give me another ball.

272
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:11,924
The guy who believes
it, only see limits,

273
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:16,141
but a dreamer's the kind of people

274
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:21,212
believes that these two
balls can fit in the basket.

275
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:29,319
When you dream, everything is possible
. It's late.

276
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,058
How about playing face to face?

277
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,252
I start.

278
00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:34,958
Right.

279
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:44,037
When I was in eighth grade,

280
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:46,170
was on the bench,

281
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:48,745
as you were today.

282
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,410
I know what's going on.

283
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:57,684
The hands sweat, the heart races

284
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,982
like a freight train.

285
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:04,322
Finally, you
comes into play.

286
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:07,225
Fans who are there, not
know what they are feeling.

287
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:09,395
They just expect there on the court,
somehow that boy

288
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:13,264
help the team they love
to win the game.

289
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:15,133
When we think so,

290
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:18,037
a dream no more than
is a challenge

291
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:20,578
we put ourselves.

292
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:21,833
Your turn.

293
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:28,314
Do you understand what I'm saying, Pete?

294
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,505
Yes, sir.

295
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:32,034
It's after 10,
Press Maravich,

296
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:33,953
neighbors just called.

297
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:34,586
Really?

298
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:36,521
Well, they are
agreed so late?

299
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:37,682
Cute.

300
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,225
How long this will take?

301
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,458
Until I win.

302
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:41,693
Really? Go dreaming.

303
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:42,894
Best of seven.

304
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:45,544
Stay here, honey!
I need fans.

305
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:48,535
Need a beating
, yes.

306
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:51,705
When will grow, Press?

307
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:53,938
Once you grow as well.

308
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:55,819
Point! End of game.

309
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,009
Call this pitch?

310
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,278
The ball came in, did not enter?

311
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,513
Game over, boys,

312
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,515
come on, Pete, has passed
bedtime.

313
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:06,551
Pete, what is the best
player of all time?

314
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:07,849
George Mikan.

315
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,084
No

316
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:10,890
In the semifinals
1950 he made

317
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:12,392
an average of 31 points per game.

318
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:13,256
So what?

319
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:15,160
Okay. And Natt Holmon?

320
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:17,697
Original Celtics, good
feint, great passes.

321
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,548
Not Very limited.

322
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,567
Limited... get this...

323
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:24,669
Well, the Dutch Dennert?

324
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,404
He invented the pivot position,

325
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:28,072
and it was my coach
professional team.

326
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:30,275
Improved, but it is far.

327
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:32,477
It is far! Okay, wise guy!

328
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:36,368
Who was the best player that ever existed
?

329
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:42,232
Can you tell me, Dad!

330
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,409
This is my boy!

331
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:03,341
What are you doing?

332
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:04,400
Running.

333
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:06,244
But we have a
game in an hour.

334
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:08,414
I know. I think I have that save energy

335
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,445
to sit on that bench.

336
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:17,055
My first passion was
officially begun with Sandy,

337
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:19,115
cheerleader.

338
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,926
I knew I was risking my life

339
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,429
talking with his girlfriend
Buddy Pendleton

340
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,399
but it was beautiful.

341
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,602
My knees were shaking
when I spoke to her.

342
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,443
I saw you in the play.

343
00:20:32,938 --> 00:20:34,337
Will actress?

344
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,134
Oh, sure. Marilyn Monroe.

345
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:40,011
It will be a movie star?

346
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:41,372
I think not.

347
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:44,515
So why is the play?

348
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:47,553
She must have found me an arrogant fool

349
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:49,220
but I needed to say.

350
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:51,937
Why waste time being an actress,

351
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:55,688
if not he tried to be the best?

352
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:25,689
Come on, Buddy!

353
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:27,954
Was missing three
- two!

354
00:21:48,113 --> 00:21:49,580
Technical foul. White.

355
00:21:49,581 --> 00:21:52,185
Number one - zero is out of the game.

356
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:52,951
Play out?

357
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:54,085
You lost your mind?

358
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:55,720
You have to help my boys too.

359
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:58,021
Get out of here. Time, time!

360
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:00,694
Come to here!

361
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:03,376
Needs treatment, zebra!

362
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:05,365
We will have to make a change.

363
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,264
Maravich, you enter!

364
00:22:06,265 --> 00:22:07,750
Father, you must be kidding
.

365
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,142
You play, I'm the coach.

366
00:22:09,143 --> 00:22:10,935
Go warming, Maravich.

367
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:12,405
Well, we have to do is the following
...

368
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:13,337
Press!

369
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:15,182
It's about time.

370
00:22:15,574 --> 00:22:18,844
Keep track,
enter the game.

371
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:21,646
Well, son, keep
control, play right.

372
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:22,715
Ready? Come on.

373
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,715
Is ours is ours.

374
00:22:23,716 --> 00:22:24,515
It is easy, come on.

375
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:27,266
One, two, three,
Lions! We Will!

376
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:42,628
Okay,
Buddy! That's right!

377
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,773
I'm free!

378
00:23:34,987 --> 00:23:38,667
Wow, I thought
had a good team.

379
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:42,251
But we do not
worth a penny!

380
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:43,494
In thirty years as coach,

381
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:46,695
deliver never seen a game like this.

382
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:52,002
And you, Maravich,

383
00:23:52,037 --> 00:23:54,038
that play is great
to the circus,

384
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:57,341
but for the team of Daniel High,
is poor basketball.

385
00:23:57,342 --> 00:23:59,044
Think of it during the weekend,

386
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,678
and play basketball
how to,

387
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:02,582
will be able to put the uniform of the team...

388
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:06,416
if you can not,
forget it.

389
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:17,756
Hi, Pete... you
played very well.

390
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,590
We lost.

391
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,233
You can not always win.

392
00:24:22,234 --> 00:24:23,101
When we lose,

393
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:25,712
people remember only this.

394
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:29,058
I still think you played well.

395
00:24:32,111 --> 00:24:33,611
If you're smart,
will give up.

396
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:34,732
Just today!

397
00:24:34,913 --> 00:24:36,647
He did not mean it!

398
00:24:36,648 --> 00:24:37,381
Get out of here.

399
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:39,417
Are you defending him?

400
00:24:39,418 --> 00:24:41,219
It was an accident, Buddy.

401
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,887
Okay. If you are
so you want,

402
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:46,808
'm going out with the Walker
and the boys today.

403
00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:55,814
As Sandy or anyone else

404
00:24:55,815 --> 00:24:58,945
'd know what I was feeling
?

405
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:00,068
Buddy.

406
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:05,199
Hey, Maravich! Very
thanks, sausage!

407
00:25:05,978 --> 00:25:09,213
Losing the game was as
have a knife in the heart.

408
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:10,982
Me condicionei to believe that

409
00:25:10,983 --> 00:25:14,352
only victory was
acceptable, nothing more.

410
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:17,173
I had disappointed the team...

411
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:19,796
fans, Daniel High School

412
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,256
and my hero, my father.

413
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,220
Knew that you find here.

414
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:43,446
Right acted in that bid.

415
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:50,504
Know Pete,

416
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:58,224
you have something that man more
rich world can not buy...

417
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,322
A gift.

418
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:07,371
Maybe now look like you
does not fit... as...

419
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:09,532
if I did everything wrong.

420
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:15,048
But believe me,

421
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:19,021
you're on the right track.

422
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:45,042
Your mother and I...

423
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:50,471
can not afford a university.

424
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:58,489
But if you indulge in,

425
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,542
and use this gift that God gave him
,

426
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:02,561
will one day play
in the team.

427
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:03,824
I know, son

428
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,099
And if really good, for

429
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,370
will get a scholarship /

430
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:13,204
maybe play with the pros,

431
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:15,855
and join the championship...

432
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:19,891
I think I heard these words
thousand times.

433
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:23,649
And tonight I realized

434
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,880
I wanted to be "Pistol".

435
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:43,567
Now is me

436
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:47,162
I will change the situation

437
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:52,975
appears the desire seed

438
00:27:54,579 --> 00:28:00,950
Reviving the ashes in the little heart

439
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:08,048
Awake, awake the flame

440
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,420
Now is me

441
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:15,399
No one will stop me

442
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:20,303
Now is me again

443
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,234
Now is me

444
00:28:25,544 --> 00:28:31,380
My path will follow

445
00:28:32,451 --> 00:28:35,352
I discovered what it takes

446
00:28:35,887 --> 00:28:38,617
<i>E tracks will not let</i>

447
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:41,060
I will break the chains

448
00:28:41,061 --> 00:28:44,393
That put me

449
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:52,268
And find this hope, shining far

450
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:59,876
The price to continue on my way

451
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:03,037
Now is me

452
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:06,917
No one will stop me

453
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:11,946
Now it's me again

454
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,924
Now is me

455
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:22,931
My path will follow

456
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:37,614
Now is me

457
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:41,251
No one will stop me

458
00:29:41,286 --> 00:29:46,485
Now it's me again

459
00:29:48,193 --> 00:29:51,253
Now is me

460
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:59,166
My path will follow

461
00:30:01,273 --> 00:30:07,405
I will follow

462
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:46,389
So you told Pete that
would be better to leave the team?

463
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,056
We talked.

464
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:53,691
As always, my
opinion does not count.

465
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:55,125
But, Helen, is...

466
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:57,495
This is the real problem
, Press.

467
00:30:57,496 --> 00:31:00,364
You are always fighting against windmills.

468
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:01,935
Hold on.

469
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:06,009
What do you mean?

470
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:09,375
It's okay if you want to fight the tide
,

471
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:11,477
but his son to do the same?

472
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:13,048
Hold on.

473
00:31:13,245 --> 00:31:15,075
A few weeks ago you happy

474
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:16,914
because Pete
joined the team.

475
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:19,151
I was happy because I know how

476
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:21,285
he wants to be like you /

477
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:23,521
join the team owner to 13 years.

478
00:31:23,522 --> 00:31:25,222
But it will not happen,

479
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:27,258
because everything
Vern see Pendleton

480
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:30,429
is a boy of 1.60
tall and 40 pounds.

481
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,948
Helen, you do not understand

482
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:33,397
which he is living.

483
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:35,083
I know Pete is suffering.

484
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:36,861
Of course he is suffering
.

485
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,569
When I was his age,

486
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,238
wanted out of steel
in Aliquippa.

487
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:43,475
My lungs were full of dark smoke,

488
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:45,578
and my hands were rough

489
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:47,611
to work 15 hours a day.

490
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:50,481
Think I do not
was suffering?

491
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:53,250
But it builds character, Helen,

492
00:31:53,251 --> 00:31:55,816
That pain there in the soul of background

493
00:31:55,817 --> 00:31:58,877
encouraged me to be something better!

494
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:04,628
I can train you up out of breath
,

495
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:07,266
but while he did not feel
something that burns your soul,

496
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:09,900
My words are worthless.

497
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:12,331
But he's just a boy.

498
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:16,405
I know.

499
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:47,932
Children usually prefer a teddy bear.

500
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:58,484
It's hard to be a child seeking

501
00:32:58,485 --> 00:33:00,675
adult dream.

502
00:33:04,522 --> 00:33:07,891
In all the pain and confusion
, I knew

503
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:10,427
I had to continue
seeking my dream,

504
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:13,296
for my father and me,

505
00:33:13,331 --> 00:33:15,601
even more nobody understood

506
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:17,501
what was going on in me.

507
00:33:17,502 --> 00:33:20,471
When the excitement and pressure
dominated me,

508
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:24,508
I plunged the years
Dad had taught me.

509
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:27,119
Control at your fingertips,

510
00:33:27,312 --> 00:33:30,008
Followed by wrist flexion.

511
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:33,792
Control at your fingertips,

512
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:36,645
followed by wrist flexion.

513
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:40,591
Control at your fingertips,

514
00:33:40,592 --> 00:33:43,132
followed by wrist flexion.

515
00:33:44,262 --> 00:33:46,114
In those lonely nights,

516
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:48,087
my father exercises the

517
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:50,318
helped me to continue.

518
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:53,212
Control at your fingertips,

519
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:55,844
followed by wrist flexion.

520
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:02,946
Some people seek reasons to dislike you.

521
00:34:02,947 --> 00:34:04,214
Four weeks have passed since

522
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:05,582
I attained
Buddy's face.

523
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,184
I still felt alone

524
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:10,154
like a fish upstream.

525
00:34:10,155 --> 00:34:11,990
Hey, Elf, would
is allowed to carry

526
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:14,741
basketball
in the hallway?

527
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:19,463
Eighth grade...

528
00:34:20,932 --> 00:34:22,966
Okay. As you know,

529
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:24,653
every day this quarter

530
00:34:24,654 --> 00:34:26,305
ask students to tell

531
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,776
your dreams for the future.

532
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,040
Peter, now it's your turn.

533
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:42,321
My dream is to get a scholarship

534
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:45,389
university to play basketball.

535
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,255
Class! That's enough.

536
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:48,892
Continue, Peter.

537
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:51,230
And I'll be the first man to win

538
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,731
a million dollars playing

539
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:54,698
basketball professionally.

540
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:56,360
Hey, hey!

541
00:34:58,169 --> 00:35:00,655
Also want to play in the first team

542
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:03,108
and earn a range of best player

543
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:06,099
of basketball ever.

544
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:09,862
You can sit,
Peter. Thank you.

545
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:13,142
I...

546
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:16,721
wanted to talk to you about Pete.

547
00:35:17,455 --> 00:35:21,492
Look... or he is good
for the team or not.

548
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:23,627
But if you're using Pete

549
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:25,062
only to train your players,

550
00:35:25,063 --> 00:35:26,930
then it is more ignorant than I thought
.

551
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:27,931
Hold on, mate,

552
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:29,101
you are passing the limit now.

553
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:30,292
I'm really?

554
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:32,969
Just want to know

555
00:35:33,004 --> 00:35:35,005
Because you are not putting
Pete to play.

556
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:37,726
He needs to mature, Press.

557
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:43,280
Mature. He has more discipline

558
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:47,451
and maturity that his first team.

559
00:35:47,952 --> 00:35:50,942
And that includes Buddy, his son.

560
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:55,659
Press, we will not take it personally
.

561
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,594
Of course, your child
has some talent,

562
00:35:57,595 --> 00:36:01,385
it just needs to be controlled and cut
.

563
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:02,916
But when you have a good horse,

564
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:05,569
arises him to compete
, Vern.

565
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,137
Technical, not
wanted to say this,

566
00:36:07,138 --> 00:36:09,940
but this appears to me
pressing.

567
00:36:09,941 --> 00:36:11,059
Well, go ahead and tell
because

568
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,144
I would give any thing to know

569
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:15,279
what's going on
on his head.

570
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,000
Well, your child
involved in problems.

571
00:36:20,385 --> 00:36:21,715
I'm listening.

572
00:36:21,986 --> 00:36:24,990
He learned to play
like that with blacks.

573
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:28,911
I saw him playing the
other side of the rail.

574
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,061
I hate to tell you this,

575
00:36:31,062 --> 00:36:34,231
but I think you
needed to know.

576
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:35,566
Of course, this kind of thing works

577
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:37,901
with Globe Trotters,
but in a real game...

578
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:39,071
you saw what happened when

579
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,037
I put to play.

580
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:42,072
He almost broke the nose of Buddy!

581
00:36:42,073 --> 00:36:44,723
You are joking, technical.

582
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:47,578
I think your son
should take that pass.

583
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,582
The only game that Pete
know is instinctively

584
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:53,018
it will not stop
for 10 minutes

585
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:53,984
thinking in the pass,

586
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:55,652
he will not give
no warning.

587
00:36:55,653 --> 00:36:57,454
Not understand what I'm saying?

588
00:36:57,455 --> 00:37:01,325
He knew Buddy
was free, he knew!

589
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:04,428
Pete has bids
ever seen,

590
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:08,289
and you're chaining
a born winner.

591
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:11,389
Why do not you
the loose, huh?

592
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:15,373
Why do not
gives you a chance?

593
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:17,608
What are you doing, Dad?

594
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:19,077
"Man to man", or "zone"?

595
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:20,528
Shut Walk!
Man to man.

596
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,346
Ok 'Man on
man.'. Come on.

597
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:24,437
One, two, three, Lions!

598
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:37,091
Oh, please! Lock
there and rebounds!

599
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:53,466
Pete!

600
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,082
How are you feeling?

601
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:57,946
Well

602
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,956
Damn, look at that pass!

603
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,460
I thought you would get.

604
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,408
Look blocking and rebounds.

605
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,809
A rebound is too much to ask?

606
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:29,010
Pete!

607
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,350
Knew is not it?

608
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:34,249
How?

609
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:35,953
The pass for Buddy.

610
00:38:35,954 --> 00:38:37,120
I think so.

611
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:38,588
How did you know
he was free?

612
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:39,851
Only knew.

613
00:38:40,658 --> 00:38:42,748
Okay, can sit.

614
00:38:58,009 --> 00:39:00,999
Pete enters the
place of Walker.

615
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:06,242
Hey, will you mark me?

616
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:20,597
Cannfield, that does not
is the son of Maravich?

617
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:21,462
Is.

618
00:39:50,228 --> 00:39:52,978
's Killing them, Pete.

619
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:54,601
Calm, Maravich!

620
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:27,097
Hey, kid!

621
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,433
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

622
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:29,633
In the backyard.

623
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:32,002
Know flinging the
waist like a gunslinger?

624
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:32,883
Thank you.

625
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,009
Father!

626
00:40:42,246 --> 00:40:43,110
Hi!

627
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:45,916
What are you doing here?

628
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:49,419
I was thinking about the victory of yesterday.

629
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,221
Have you read the papers?

630
00:40:51,222 --> 00:40:52,154
No

631
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:54,731
Should have read.

632
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:56,676
Listen to this.

633
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:00,949
The basketball team of Daniel High School

634
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,666
guaranteed entertainment last night,

635
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,970
thanks to the talent of a
eighth-grader,

636
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:06,301
Pete Maravich.

637
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,906
Daniel High School gym did not see much movement

638
00:41:07,907 --> 00:41:11,697
from the prom
closure of football.

639
00:41:11,876 --> 00:41:13,411
The team traditionally
formed by high school students

640
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:16,113
led by Buddy Pendleton

641
00:41:16,114 --> 00:41:19,649
gained new air with the small
Maravich leading the pack.

642
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,651
He did not lead anything, Dad!

643
00:41:21,652 --> 00:41:25,122
What matters is that we are winning
.

644
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:26,173
It gets worse.

645
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:29,926
Sometimes, the
fellow Pistol Pete...

646
00:41:29,927 --> 00:41:34,498
"Pistol Pete".
What business is that of "Pistol Pete"?

647
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:38,299
It is a stage name
as Houdini.

648
00:41:39,737 --> 00:41:42,697
Can you believe this shit?

649
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:45,841
If you want to say something, say it!

650
00:41:46,477 --> 00:41:48,278
I want Maravich
off the team.

651
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:49,414
We need to drive the team

652
00:41:49,415 --> 00:41:50,515
and no one likes him.

653
00:41:50,516 --> 00:41:51,500
Why not?

654
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:52,411
Now father,

655
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:54,052
it's a boy
silly eighth grade

656
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,153
and we are high school.

657
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:56,514
And the tradition?

658
00:41:56,521 --> 00:41:57,721
What about her?

659
00:41:57,722 --> 00:42:00,056
Always scale senior students.

660
00:42:00,057 --> 00:42:02,371
As I said, what matters

661
00:42:02,372 --> 00:42:05,362
is the column wins and losses.

662
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:08,726
Was even thinking in scale it.

663
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,640
Instead of whom?

664
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:14,033
In Walk or yours.

665
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:19,244
I know people are saying that we have a chance

666
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,710
in the state semifinals,

667
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:22,047
and this will not happen to the Maravich

668
00:42:22,048 --> 00:42:23,688
dividing the team.

669
00:42:24,682 --> 00:42:26,672
I'll think about it, son.

670
00:42:27,151 --> 00:42:29,686
Freezes him today, Dad.
It would be the best decision.

671
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:31,288
We give you all the support.

672
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:33,489
Mainly Walker.

673
00:42:37,528 --> 00:42:39,264
Had started playing a few weeks ago

674
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,897
and the school was winning,

675
00:42:40,898 --> 00:42:43,433
But wanted to improve my game.

676
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:44,568
How to do this?

677
00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:46,449
My father taught me.

678
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:48,002
Want to try?

679
00:42:48,105 --> 00:42:49,590
All day I went to College Clemson

680
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:51,363
and Dad handed me some new training

681
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:53,543
who called Task Basketball,

682
00:42:53,544 --> 00:42:56,313
the only task
I like to do.

683
00:42:56,314 --> 00:42:58,448
One day the Moose
came to me.

684
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:00,118
It seems he wanted a scholarship

685
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,318
much as I, and was willing

686
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:04,654
put at risk its reputation
with the team.

687
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:06,856
I decided to give you an introduction

688
00:43:06,857 --> 00:43:09,326
to see if it was
even a dreamer.

689
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:13,117
Try this. My father
calls "blowback."

690
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:28,478
There is no one to show us the way

691
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:31,539
Together we are

692
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,448
We are the dreamers

693
00:43:40,324 --> 00:43:43,054
really believe

694
00:43:43,561 --> 00:43:46,655
encourage each other

695
00:43:48,232 --> 00:43:50,996
to continue

696
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:10,884
We wink

697
00:44:11,689 --> 00:44:15,526
E
in our dreams are heroes

698
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:18,393
We dream the same thing

699
00:44:19,497 --> 00:44:23,434
We pray all night
protection

700
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:27,336
Side by side, we will see life

701
00:44:27,405 --> 00:44:30,169
Creating the future

702
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:33,259
This day will come

703
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:35,209
Not so far

704
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:38,043
Venceremos together

705
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:46,318
We are the dreamers

706
00:44:47,124 --> 00:44:49,922
really believe

707
00:44:50,361 --> 00:44:53,455
We encourage each other

708
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:57,897
to continue

709
00:44:58,703 --> 00:45:01,968
We are the dreamers

710
00:45:02,506 --> 00:45:05,532
really believe

711
00:45:05,643 --> 00:45:09,010
encourage each other

712
00:45:10,514 --> 00:45:13,347
to continue.

713
00:45:32,436 --> 00:45:36,106
Okay Other than that my father taught
is the "Booty fast. "

714
00:45:36,107 --> 00:45:37,887
You can try, Moose.

715
00:45:39,243 --> 00:45:43,863
Place your hands as if it were
draw their pistols.

716
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:47,117
Clap in front and
catch the ball behind you.

717
00:45:47,118 --> 00:45:48,987
Focus, and
whatever,

718
00:45:48,988 --> 00:45:51,458
not pay attention to me.

719
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:53,548
I do this.

720
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:57,919
See the speed of the Walk.

721
00:45:58,095 --> 00:45:59,285
Are you ready?

722
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:05,067
Barnes. You try, CD.

723
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,560
Okay. Do not pay attention to me
.

724
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:17,313
Hey, Buddy. Come
try. You can.

725
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:19,784
I do not do circus acts.

726
00:46:20,651 --> 00:46:23,711
I gamble Pete
can do.

727
00:46:26,424 --> 00:46:27,334
Look.

728
00:46:29,393 --> 00:46:31,461
Had not yet conquered all,

729
00:46:31,462 --> 00:46:34,072
but Sandy seemed to support me,

730
00:46:34,131 --> 00:46:35,996
even from a distance.

731
00:46:39,537 --> 00:46:41,472
Now see what happens
this attack.

732
00:46:41,473 --> 00:46:43,391
The side is the light trap
about this man,

733
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:45,276
while the owners go out at the same time.

734
00:46:45,277 --> 00:46:47,076
One here, another there.

735
00:46:47,077 --> 00:46:48,846
Do not let him
tire your ears.

736
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,414
You can go home
whenever they want.

737
00:46:50,415 --> 00:46:53,216
Honey, have some thing
burning?

738
00:46:53,217 --> 00:46:55,987
The pivot crosses the lane,
makes a light trap

739
00:46:55,988 --> 00:46:57,222
the defender while the other side

740
00:46:57,223 --> 00:46:58,321
crosses the bottom line.

741
00:46:58,322 --> 00:46:59,452
I'm not cooking anything.

742
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:00,590
Then find something.

743
00:47:00,591 --> 00:47:03,893
Watch now.
It's very simple.

744
00:47:03,894 --> 00:47:05,495
Santa could talk all night

745
00:47:05,496 --> 00:47:07,530
about his two favorite subjects:

746
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:09,158
Basketball and me.

747
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:11,835
But the same style of play

748
00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:14,272
that would make people scream
and stay in Peach

749
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:16,608
twenty years later,
gave to sleep

750
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:19,236
major technical of the country.

751
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:25,881
Pete See, for example.

752
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,417
Right here in my house,

753
00:47:27,418 --> 00:47:29,953
have the guardian of the future.

754
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:31,985
It can act in a blink of an eye
,

755
00:47:31,986 --> 00:47:35,091
and let the defense
scratching his head.

756
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:38,096
Of course, a game
so worthless

757
00:47:38,097 --> 00:47:39,512
if you have five players

758
00:47:39,513 --> 00:47:41,664
on the court that do work.

759
00:47:41,665 --> 00:47:47,365
Otherwise...
is like talking to the wind.

760
00:47:52,643 --> 00:47:53,663
Understand?

761
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:10,627
Hey! Good story, right?

762
00:48:10,628 --> 00:48:12,596
Pistol Pete and Moose!

763
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:17,833
Dr. Pepper, two!
Let me see, Myron.

764
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:26,551
Very Good, Pete, that's right.

765
00:48:27,478 --> 00:48:29,412
I am teaching the Moose.

766
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:32,148
It will achieve
a scholarship!

767
00:48:32,149 --> 00:48:33,343
The Moose?

768
00:48:33,951 --> 00:48:35,171
It is the Moose.

769
00:48:35,486 --> 00:48:38,182
He is starting well.

770
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:41,224
The attention of the media is the key.

771
00:48:41,225 --> 00:48:44,160
He is playing for the best state of the team.

772
00:48:44,161 --> 00:48:46,029
And that team is this, Mr. Carl?

773
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,330
Myron, does not come with this.

774
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:48,831
You know very well.

775
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:50,633
Believe me I know it.

776
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:53,034
You and your silly ideas.

777
00:48:55,272 --> 00:48:56,136
What?

778
00:48:58,042 --> 00:49:00,677
He thinks the Lions should
play with Cleveland.

779
00:49:00,678 --> 00:49:03,079
He says it's the best
State team.

780
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,380
A black team?

781
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:05,811
Is not hilarious?

782
00:49:08,185 --> 00:49:09,375
Let's play.

783
00:49:11,055 --> 00:49:13,457
It's just a dream, Pete.

784
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,424
That's it.

785
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:17,285
They are the best or not?

786
00:49:17,294 --> 00:49:19,819
Of course they are!

787
00:49:32,676 --> 00:49:36,016
Too young to know the defeat

788
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,548
Ajuventude also has weaknesses

789
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,016
We can not measure heart and soul

790
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,453
Just keep them under control

791
00:49:46,624 --> 00:49:50,253
When we know our road

792
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:54,397
We will forward
for that plan

793
00:49:54,398 --> 00:49:57,265
A fine line divides

794
00:49:57,334 --> 00:50:01,293
Facing the fear or flee

795
00:50:02,439 --> 00:50:06,307
From dream to the destination

796
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:07,377
Double or nothing.

797
00:50:07,378 --> 00:50:10,538
This is the fifth
'double or nothing'.

798
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:15,251
Wait until tomorrow, Pete.

799
00:50:15,252 --> 00:50:20,588
In life only is there no inside or outside

800
00:50:20,691 --> 00:50:24,161
There is a burning desire in us

801
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:27,631
That shines all night

802
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:30,930
Do not be discouraged

803
00:50:31,301 --> 00:50:34,964
Keep in mind your dream

804
00:50:35,272 --> 00:50:38,332
During the
nightmares of his life

805
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:41,037
Do not be discouraged

806
00:50:47,518 --> 00:50:50,487
There is no place for souvenirs

807
00:50:50,954 --> 00:50:54,508
There are today or tomorrow

808
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:58,062
In difficult times

809
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:01,429
Choose continue

810
00:51:01,498 --> 00:51:05,059
Some live only to see the day

811
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:08,537
Others live for their dreams

812
00:51:08,572 --> 00:51:12,676
never feel the heat
, as you

813
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:16,476
There is a distance in his hand

814
00:51:17,214 --> 00:51:21,116
From dream to the destination

815
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,580
<i>Now, there is nothing more</i>

816
00:51:28,392 --> 00:51:31,452
Do not be discouraged

817
00:51:31,895 --> 00:51:35,387
There is no victory without a fight

818
00:51:44,575 --> 00:51:47,343
He's eating you alive
, Walker!

819
00:51:47,344 --> 00:51:49,294
Walk, finish him!

820
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:55,247
Ok Combined..

821
00:52:02,092 --> 00:52:03,142
Half an hour.

822
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,327
Are you kidding?

823
00:52:04,328 --> 00:52:05,528
He can in an hour.

824
00:52:05,529 --> 00:52:06,462
What's going on?

825
00:52:06,463 --> 00:52:08,164
I saw your car out front.

826
00:52:08,165 --> 00:52:11,000
We are making a bet with Maravich.

827
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:15,541
He has to turn the ball
finger for an hour.

828
00:52:16,173 --> 00:52:19,142
Start when the pointer
the second hand is at 12.

829
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:20,411
Stay here,
girls if they want

830
00:52:20,412 --> 00:52:22,192
see something funny.

831
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,010
One for the money, two for the show
.

832
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,590
Come on. Prepare,
point, and fire!

833
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:46,034
Come on!

834
00:52:46,303 --> 00:52:48,066
Look at this, folks.

835
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,539
Come on, Pete.

836
00:52:58,749 --> 00:53:00,516
Come on, Pete, focus.

837
00:53:00,517 --> 00:53:01,586
Come on, Pete!

838
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:02,576
Enough!

839
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:05,655
I can not!

840
00:53:05,656 --> 00:53:06,916
Can not?

841
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:08,954
I can not stop.

842
00:53:12,362 --> 00:53:13,552
Come on, Pete!

843
00:53:16,066 --> 00:53:18,000
Come on! You can!

844
00:53:45,696 --> 00:53:47,965
He's getting tired
, Buddy,

845
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:49,886
is getting tired.

846
00:53:54,338 --> 00:53:56,932
You can! Come on, Pete!

847
00:54:07,317 --> 00:54:09,127
Hey, where you going?

848
00:54:17,895 --> 00:54:20,195
Can you, Mr. Peter.

849
00:54:21,131 --> 00:54:23,361
Where did you learn to drive?

850
00:54:55,966 --> 00:54:57,700
Come on, Pete! You can!

851
00:54:57,701 --> 00:54:59,100
15 seconds!

852
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,770
You did it!

853
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,243
Nine, eight,
seven, six, five,

854
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:09,212
four, three, two, one!

855
00:55:18,922 --> 00:55:22,782
Your tricks will end
soon, Petey.

856
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:40,859
Okay! Hey, judge!

857
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:43,202
In your face!

858
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:19,841
They find that it's cool?

859
00:56:20,317 --> 00:56:23,717
He told me
you are a banana.

860
00:56:25,188 --> 00:56:27,068
Said yes. I heard.

861
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:30,140
Said you was a banana.

862
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:41,033
!

863
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:50,928
Nice move!

864
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:51,842
Thank you!

865
00:57:07,164 --> 00:57:09,114
You're crazy, judge!

866
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:16,938
Pete!

867
00:57:16,973 --> 00:57:19,008
We are watching the same game?

868
00:57:19,009 --> 00:57:20,499
# 5...

869
00:57:23,513 --> 00:57:25,314
Expected, Press.
It is cold.

870
00:57:25,315 --> 00:57:26,885
Call a physician.

871
00:57:40,263 --> 00:57:41,430
How do you feel?

872
00:57:41,431 --> 00:57:42,861
I'll be fine.

873
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:44,526
Let me see.

874
00:57:47,137 --> 00:57:49,777
It was a difficult game, right?

875
00:57:50,307 --> 00:57:54,787
The doctor said you
had a mild concussion.

876
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,045
This makes me remember when

877
00:57:58,046 --> 00:58:00,836
played for Pittsburgh Ironmen.

878
00:58:01,051 --> 00:58:04,253
They sewed me after every game.

879
00:58:04,254 --> 00:58:07,389
They called us
Iron Team.

880
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,158
Because you were tough?

881
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:13,061
No, they could only pay
5 players.

882
00:58:25,075 --> 00:58:28,144
Looking into the eyes of my father I understood.

883
00:58:28,145 --> 00:58:30,112
He did not need to say anything.

884
00:58:30,113 --> 00:58:32,681
Could not face the guy who hurt me

885
00:58:32,682 --> 00:58:35,319
but no way he would knock me

886
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,052
and keep out of the game.

887
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:39,089
Sitting there, I remembered the ten games

888
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,589
I stayed on the bench.

889
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,193
I tried to pretend it did not bother me,

890
00:58:42,194 --> 00:58:44,024
bothered but yes.

891
00:58:44,327 --> 00:58:46,695
This was the moment of truth for me
.

892
00:58:46,696 --> 00:58:50,599
A chance to make a choice
and prove him wrong.

893
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,501
My body said "No"

894
00:58:52,502 --> 00:58:56,233
but my heart cried out: "Give a show."

895
00:58:58,508 --> 00:58:59,743
They are destroying us in the marking.

896
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,676
We will mark by zone.

897
00:59:00,677 --> 00:59:02,213
But they are attacking
out, Dad!

898
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:03,348
But they are getting underneath.

899
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:04,413
You can let
I mark the center.

900
00:59:04,414 --> 00:59:07,151
Walk, lock and cuts
the bottom line.

901
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:08,184
Father, give me the ball.

902
00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:09,385
Moves to me.

903
00:59:09,386 --> 00:59:11,388
Pete, what is
doing here?

904
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:12,888
You can not enter.

905
00:59:12,889 --> 00:59:15,226
Mom, I could play this game
blindfolded.

906
00:59:15,227 --> 00:59:16,292
Let him play, Helen.

907
00:59:16,293 --> 00:59:18,661
We can become more violent in
marking, technical.

908
00:59:18,662 --> 00:59:21,098
Walk, when I die
you stay in my place.

909
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,367
But as this, be quiet.

910
00:59:22,368 --> 00:59:23,601
Gave to understand?
Yes, sir.

911
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:24,625
Look!

912
00:59:27,837 --> 00:59:38,338
Pistol, Pistol,
Pistol, Pistol

913
00:59:38,615 --> 00:59:39,581
All right, son?

914
00:59:39,582 --> 00:59:40,772
Yes, sir.

915
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:45,588
Walk, go to the bank.

916
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:47,491
Who will score the
center for you?

917
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:48,626
Walk, how old are you?

918
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:49,491
Eighteen.

919
00:59:49,526 --> 00:59:50,961
Either until the nineteen live?

920
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:51,560
Yes, sir.

921
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:54,551
So do what you're told
!

922
00:59:55,665 --> 00:59:59,136
Let's finish them. One, two, three...

923
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,000
Lions!

924
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:25,985
Pistol! That's it!

925
01:00:33,536 --> 01:00:36,256
Pistol, Pistol,
Pistol, Pistol

926
01:00:39,142 --> 01:00:40,402
Exchange, exchange!

927
01:00:43,713 --> 01:00:45,113
Pass, watch out!

928
01:01:07,237 --> 01:01:09,467
One, two, three... Lions!

929
01:01:12,542 --> 01:01:15,312
There's more chicken and
pod if they want!

930
01:01:15,313 --> 01:01:16,713
Thank you, Carl.

931
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:19,082
Need muscles for the final,

932
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:22,017
and green beans is good to give
muscles.

933
01:01:22,018 --> 01:01:24,420
Said the same thing about
cauliflower.

934
01:01:24,421 --> 01:01:25,988
Want to get high, do not you?

935
01:01:25,989 --> 01:01:27,179
Yes, sir.

936
01:01:27,223 --> 01:01:28,623
You never heard of

937
01:01:28,624 --> 01:01:30,059
a tall guy called Pod?

938
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,118
Father!

939
01:01:32,529 --> 01:01:35,689
Myron! Iced tea to the table
3.

940
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:38,302
I'm coming,
Carl. Thank U.

941
01:01:38,303 --> 01:01:39,335
Hello, you guys.

942
01:01:39,336 --> 01:01:42,206
I felt the smell of chicken
Myron a mile away.

943
01:01:42,207 --> 01:01:44,173
And the taste is even better!

944
01:01:44,174 --> 01:01:46,194
Good that appeared.

945
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:47,949
Pull up a chair.

946
01:01:51,715 --> 01:01:54,045
Good that invited me.

947
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:57,019
Nobody does fried chicken
as Myron.

948
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,800
Thank you, Mr. Vern.

949
01:01:59,189 --> 01:02:01,775
I know Myron some 12 years /

950
01:02:01,776 --> 01:02:04,328
when he cut my grass.

951
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:05,561
Yes, sir. It's true.

952
01:02:05,562 --> 01:02:07,843
Since 1949, when I worked

953
01:02:07,844 --> 01:02:11,044
for you in
Division Street.

954
01:02:11,134 --> 01:02:14,024
Doctor Pepper,
on my own.

955
01:02:15,472 --> 01:02:16,872
Thank you, Carl.

956
01:02:17,006 --> 01:02:19,143
Myron, prepares another
meat portion.

957
01:02:19,144 --> 01:02:22,977
They are very kind to me.

958
01:02:24,314 --> 01:02:27,444
Will not ask for a loan
, are they?

959
01:02:28,618 --> 01:02:32,268
You're busy
after dinner?

960
01:02:32,522 --> 01:02:37,042
Josephine has a date
missionary in the church.

961
01:02:37,227 --> 01:02:38,489
I'm free.

962
01:02:40,663 --> 01:02:42,643
What's on your mind?

963
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:46,626
State championship.
Not official.

964
01:02:47,971 --> 01:02:49,165
What?

965
01:02:51,374 --> 01:02:56,676
Tonight, we'll
take you to the future.

966
01:03:15,465 --> 01:03:18,285
I hope that explains it here.

967
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:21,601
Go figure in a minute or two.

968
01:03:24,574 --> 01:03:26,308
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
,

969
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:30,099
are welcome to
Cleveland High School.

970
01:03:30,947 --> 01:03:32,407
What is this?

971
01:03:32,649 --> 01:03:35,083
Press, care
with the wallet.

972
01:03:35,084 --> 01:03:37,087
Prepare for the Cleveland Kings

973
01:03:37,088 --> 01:03:41,217
and its captain, Joe Pro!

974
01:03:44,093 --> 01:03:45,943
You are feeling, Vern?

975
01:03:45,995 --> 01:03:47,595
It's show time.

976
01:03:59,476 --> 01:04:04,026
My parents are turning
in the tomb, for sure.

977
01:04:10,987 --> 01:04:14,320
Okay, okay.
Very well, very well.

978
01:04:39,182 --> 01:04:43,175
So? You did not say much.

979
01:04:44,587 --> 01:04:46,054
Whatever I say:

980
01:04:46,055 --> 01:04:48,490
this is the
future of basketball?

981
01:04:48,491 --> 01:04:50,161
You are who you say.

982
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,580
Now Press, please.

983
01:04:52,996 --> 01:04:54,464
Okay, can at least admit

984
01:04:54,465 --> 01:04:56,398
that Cleveland is good?

985
01:04:56,399 --> 01:04:57,869
I can agree.

986
01:04:58,535 --> 01:05:00,702
I think they can beat you.

987
01:05:00,703 --> 01:05:03,033
What is the point, coach?

988
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,642
The point is that you have the opportunity

989
01:05:06,643 --> 01:05:09,943
to stand out on this side of the country.

990
01:05:10,313 --> 01:05:13,482
Basketball
have to walk in this direction.

991
01:05:13,483 --> 01:05:16,093
You also felt it there.

992
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:18,019
Are you crazy?

993
01:05:18,855 --> 01:05:20,889
Are you afraid of?

994
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:22,491
Are you saying that black

995
01:05:22,492 --> 01:05:23,659
are better than us?

996
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:27,480
I'm saying it's time to change.

997
01:05:28,965 --> 01:05:30,966
If you use the points
strong style,

998
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:34,536
and add their style
- and you have everything.

999
01:05:34,537 --> 01:05:38,987
Even the league you want so long.

1000
01:05:39,509 --> 01:05:42,578
Press, I thank
what you're saying,

1001
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:45,264
but I feel
tell you, mate,

1002
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:47,983
some things will never change.

1003
01:05:47,984 --> 01:05:51,704
Need to open the mind to new ideas
.

1004
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:56,458
Why does not the idea
playing with them?

1005
01:05:56,459 --> 01:05:58,891
Otherwise it will be a false victory in the championship
,

1006
01:05:58,892 --> 01:06:03,342
because you have not faced
the state's best.

1007
01:06:05,368 --> 01:06:07,008
Goodnight Press.

1008
01:06:09,138 --> 01:06:12,478
Good night, Pete.
Good evening, technical.

1009
01:06:21,317 --> 01:06:27,278
Vern! Do something unexpected
once in a lifetime.

1010
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:37,399
Were the regional finals.

1011
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,202
The newspaper said that the champion

1012
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,971
Conquer the state title.

1013
01:06:40,972 --> 01:06:42,992
Come on! Attention there!

1014
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:49,646
With the play set,
I started thinking

1015
01:06:49,647 --> 01:06:51,680
If the technical Pendleton had understood

1016
01:06:51,681 --> 01:06:55,450
vision of my father on
the future of basketball.

1017
01:06:55,451 --> 01:06:57,067
Maybe win the state championship

1018
01:06:57,068 --> 01:07:00,055
also was not enough for him.

1019
01:07:00,056 --> 01:07:03,260
But everyone knew that he hated the idea

1020
01:07:03,261 --> 01:07:06,923
losing to anyone...

1021
01:07:07,296 --> 01:07:10,666
and this included
team Cleveland.

1022
01:07:31,454 --> 01:07:33,024
Okay, listen.

1023
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:36,930
Sit relax. Listen.

1024
01:07:41,698 --> 01:07:43,398
It was great, was not it?

1025
01:07:43,399 --> 01:07:45,702
I have been thinking a lot about what it means

1026
01:07:45,703 --> 01:07:48,501
Be the best state of the team,

1027
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:53,908
and... until a few days ago

1028
01:07:53,943 --> 01:07:57,946
I thought we were the better
State team.

1029
01:07:57,947 --> 01:08:00,215
We are the best, technical.

1030
01:08:00,216 --> 01:08:02,275
True. You are right.

1031
01:08:03,152 --> 01:08:07,020
We are the best "team
white" state.

1032
01:08:07,557 --> 01:08:09,825
Well, that's what matters.

1033
01:08:09,826 --> 01:08:11,927
What other team there?

1034
01:08:11,928 --> 01:08:13,862
Cleveland High.

1035
01:08:15,364 --> 01:08:17,195
Blacks?

1036
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,650
What are trying to say, Dad?

1037
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:23,371
Unless we beat the Cleveland
,

1038
01:08:23,372 --> 01:08:28,722
the state championship is a hollow victory
in my opinion.

1039
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:34,112
Monday at 7:30.

1040
01:08:35,218 --> 01:08:39,688
I can not force them to participate
of an unofficial game

1041
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:42,089
but if you have courage,

1042
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:44,598
will be here prepared.

1043
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:53,135
Get that idea out of his head.

1044
01:08:53,136 --> 01:08:56,816
Do not worry.
I'll talk to him.

1045
01:09:05,181 --> 01:09:07,201
See you Treats!

1046
01:09:09,018 --> 01:09:10,652
There is the Pistol Pete.

1047
01:09:10,653 --> 01:09:12,689
Go Treats in Soda Shop today?

1048
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,815
I do not know.

1049
01:09:13,923 --> 01:09:15,323
Oh, come on...
What is the problem?

1050
01:09:15,324 --> 01:09:18,094
Never celebrates with
team after the game.

1051
01:09:18,095 --> 01:09:19,396
We want you to come.

1052
01:09:19,397 --> 01:09:20,897
Come on, Pete.

1053
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:22,364
All right, then.

1054
01:09:22,365 --> 01:09:25,425
Cool!
The first dance is mine.

1055
01:09:27,303 --> 01:09:28,403
Then I realized.

1056
01:09:28,404 --> 01:09:30,539
It was socially maladjusted.

1057
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,641
Put me on a basketball court

1058
01:09:32,642 --> 01:09:35,579
with hundreds of people
and am very sociable,

1059
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:38,247
but the track
dance Treats

1060
01:09:38,248 --> 01:09:41,183
with Sandy, the
Buddy girlfriend?

1061
01:09:41,184 --> 01:09:42,786
He was already mad at me

1062
01:09:42,787 --> 01:09:44,319
to attract the attention of everyone.

1063
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,257
It got worse because my father
convinced the technical Pendleton

1064
01:09:47,258 --> 01:09:49,090
playing against the black team.

1065
01:09:49,091 --> 01:09:51,911
But dance with his girlfriend...

1066
01:09:52,061 --> 01:09:55,051
was when I started to sweat.

1067
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:01,970
Drew attention from me

1068
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:03,271
And gave it to a boy
eighth grade.

1069
01:10:03,272 --> 01:10:05,675
Now it's my turn to
draw attention away from you.

1070
01:10:05,676 --> 01:10:07,878
Will be no
game against blacks.

1071
01:10:07,879 --> 01:10:10,162
Do not raise your hand
to his father, boy,

1072
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:13,215
still want to know who runs this family?

1073
01:10:13,216 --> 01:10:15,184
Of course, only played against senior
,

1074
01:10:15,185 --> 01:10:19,005
but never had a
Pete Maravich on the team.

1075
01:10:20,623 --> 01:10:24,753
A boy so only
appears once in a lifetime.

1076
01:10:25,294 --> 01:10:29,264
You can not imagine how I wanted it
you were that boy.

1077
01:10:29,265 --> 01:10:31,565
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

1078
01:10:32,268 --> 01:10:33,737
But be aware that there will be no
game,

1079
01:10:33,738 --> 01:10:36,698
Because I will not let it happen
!

1080
01:10:56,058 --> 01:10:58,388
What are you doing here?

1081
01:10:59,362 --> 01:11:01,398
I thought I was in Treats.

1082
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:02,490
I will not.

1083
01:11:03,266 --> 01:11:05,701
Honey, I heard the girls.

1084
01:11:05,702 --> 01:11:08,068
They want you to go.

1085
01:11:08,671 --> 01:11:10,551
No big deal.

1086
01:11:10,907 --> 01:11:12,106
How so?

1087
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:14,121
There are a lot of crazy girls

1088
01:11:14,122 --> 01:11:16,732
to dance with Pistol Pete.

1089
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,120
What's the matter, dear?

1090
01:11:22,084 --> 01:11:23,514
Do not tell me...

1091
01:11:24,553 --> 01:11:27,322
you fled classes
dance I paid?

1092
01:11:27,323 --> 01:11:29,024
It was a waste of time.

1093
01:11:29,025 --> 01:11:31,593
Had to practice with Dad.

1094
01:11:31,594 --> 01:11:33,323
True, Press?

1095
01:11:33,429 --> 01:11:35,099
What is truth?

1096
01:11:35,231 --> 01:11:37,324
Talk to you later.

1097
01:11:38,301 --> 01:11:42,203
Pete, let's take a quick course
.

1098
01:11:56,152 --> 01:12:01,021
Relax. Feel the rhythm
. See?

1099
01:12:01,691 --> 01:12:03,226
We can dance music

1100
01:12:03,227 --> 01:12:04,626
this century, at least?

1101
01:12:04,627 --> 01:12:09,737
If you can dance it,
will dance anything.

1102
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:12,332
When a slow song,

1103
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:15,103
pull the girl close, as well.

1104
01:12:15,104 --> 01:12:16,573
Wonderful things can happen

1105
01:12:16,574 --> 01:12:18,944
when you are dancing.

1106
01:12:19,608 --> 01:12:20,658
My turn.

1107
01:12:25,581 --> 01:12:27,517
The first time I left
with this beautiful woman,

1108
01:12:27,518 --> 01:12:30,151
the band of Glenn Miller was playing


1109
01:12:30,152 --> 01:12:35,249
And during the first song,
I asked her to marry.

1110
01:12:38,995 --> 01:12:41,696
So, you want me to take you to
Treats?

1111
01:12:41,697 --> 01:12:45,837
Will not disappoint all those girls
, are you?

1112
01:12:48,004 --> 01:12:49,096
No

1113
01:13:24,206 --> 01:13:25,607
Sandy was right.

1114
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:28,176
I've never been to parties
after the game.

1115
01:13:28,177 --> 01:13:30,078
It would be shocked if he found

1116
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:32,147
I started going
when she called me.

1117
01:13:32,148 --> 01:13:33,798
I wondered if these boys

1118
01:13:33,799 --> 01:13:35,683
really wanted me to be.

1119
01:13:35,684 --> 01:13:38,219
They received me well when I arrived.

1120
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,387
It was great.

1121
01:13:39,422 --> 01:13:42,123
Moose and the guys
greeted me.

1122
01:13:42,124 --> 01:13:43,591
But where was Sandy?

1123
01:13:43,592 --> 01:13:47,172
I was afraid of being cheated
on it.

1124
01:13:49,098 --> 01:13:50,233
Would you care to dance with

1125
01:13:50,234 --> 01:13:52,067
someone from another class?

1126
01:13:52,068 --> 01:13:53,598
But what Buddy?

1127
01:13:53,669 --> 01:13:55,070
Do not worry about it.

1128
01:13:55,071 --> 01:13:56,971
I like this music, come on.

1129
01:13:56,972 --> 01:13:58,673
She really liked me.

1130
01:13:58,674 --> 01:14:00,375
I could not believe.

1131
01:14:00,376 --> 01:14:02,746
<i>Tonight would be perfect</i>

1132
01:14:03,913 --> 01:14:04,641
More?

1133
01:14:07,383 --> 01:14:10,218
Known that the Pistol
had 21 points and 10 passes.

1134
01:14:10,219 --> 01:14:13,814
From star to drunk
in just one night.

1135
01:14:15,357 --> 01:14:16,925
Can fill,
"Can Head".

1136
01:14:16,926 --> 01:14:20,606
Walk, the boy will be famous
one day.

1137
01:14:20,663 --> 01:14:24,173
Moose, the runt
needs a lesson.

1138
01:14:30,372 --> 01:14:33,502
What are you looking,
four eyes?

1139
01:14:47,623 --> 01:14:49,424
Stay away from my girl
, Petey.

1140
01:14:49,425 --> 01:14:51,027
Buddy, we're just dancing
.

1141
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,127
Grow up, Sandy.

1142
01:14:52,128 --> 01:14:54,097
Come near my girl
, have to pay.

1143
01:14:54,098 --> 01:14:55,223
You drank.

1144
01:14:55,297 --> 01:14:57,165
Come here, you worm.

1145
01:14:57,166 --> 01:15:00,603
Thought you had done all the bullshit
,

1146
01:15:00,604 --> 01:15:02,372
but you and your father
want to make people play

1147
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:03,471
with a bunch of savages

1148
01:15:03,472 --> 01:15:06,292
a league that does not exist!

1149
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:08,511
Will not have any
game, Maravich.

1150
01:15:08,512 --> 01:15:10,013
I will not let happen.

1151
01:15:10,014 --> 01:15:10,912
Why not?

1152
01:15:10,913 --> 01:15:14,015
It is best to close the nozzle, Petey Boy

1153
01:15:14,016 --> 01:15:15,847
Okay, let's vote.

1154
01:15:16,352 --> 01:15:19,482
Who wants to play
against blacks?

1155
01:15:20,089 --> 01:15:21,389
What is the matter with you?

1156
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,625
They want Cleveland
come to our school?

1157
01:15:23,626 --> 01:15:25,196
No way.

1158
01:15:25,261 --> 01:15:26,928
This is your answer, dizzy.

1159
01:15:26,929 --> 01:15:29,063
Your father will take
the same thing.

1160
01:15:29,064 --> 01:15:30,266
You are a joke
in this city.

1161
01:15:30,267 --> 01:15:31,681
His father and you belong to a

1162
01:15:31,682 --> 01:15:34,082
circus freaks show.

1163
01:15:35,204 --> 01:15:38,194
You think you're a great player
.

1164
01:15:38,908 --> 01:15:40,208
But it's a comedy.

1165
01:15:40,209 --> 01:15:42,445
Scream "Pistol" to give
laugh of his tricks.

1166
01:15:42,446 --> 01:15:46,056
That's it.
I should break your face.

1167
01:15:46,315 --> 01:15:47,435
I'm leaving.

1168
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:52,420
Let's personal, let's go.

1169
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:54,324
Prejudice and
Buddy selfishness

1170
01:15:54,325 --> 01:15:56,555
had gone too far.

1171
01:15:58,928 --> 01:15:59,917
Moose.

1172
01:16:06,135 --> 01:16:07,969
Knew that if I said anything
,

1173
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:11,973
Buddy would make me understand the meaning of
"Iron Time".

1174
01:16:11,974 --> 01:16:14,377
But I decided I needed to defend myself,

1175
01:16:14,378 --> 01:16:17,141
at any cost.

1176
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:19,570
Hard head!

1177
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:26,377
What was that?

1178
01:16:26,922 --> 01:16:30,085
You heard me. It is what it is.

1179
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:32,427
Always thinking in yourself,

1180
01:16:32,428 --> 01:16:35,063
and instead of thinking about
team or Sandy.

1181
01:16:35,064 --> 01:16:36,431
Is that what you think?

1182
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:38,032
That's what I know.

1183
01:16:38,434 --> 01:16:39,634
If you are a big deal,

1184
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:42,370
why we
does not take the test?

1185
01:16:42,371 --> 01:16:45,141
If I win, we play
against Cleveland.

1186
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,307
What if I win?

1187
01:16:46,308 --> 01:16:47,969
I leave the team.

1188
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,111
You think you're good?

1189
01:16:50,112 --> 01:16:51,443
I know I am.

1190
01:16:51,714 --> 01:16:53,449
Can be prepared,
because this time

1191
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,483
will be no tricks up his sleeve.

1192
01:16:55,484 --> 01:16:59,754
You and I, alone in the gym
in 20 minutes.

1193
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:02,957
It was the moment of truth.

1194
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:05,928
Buddy made me look like a fool in front of Sandy

1195
01:17:05,929 --> 01:17:08,296
while
broke his heart.

1196
01:17:08,297 --> 01:17:09,597
Buddy was wrong.

1197
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:12,135
Dad and I were not a joke
, and I prove this...

1198
01:17:12,136 --> 01:17:15,195
him, Sandy
and myself.

1199
01:17:22,311 --> 01:17:23,912
Hey, Sprite, you can lead a

1200
01:17:23,913 --> 01:17:26,663
basketball in the hall?

1201
01:17:30,185 --> 01:17:33,288
For school Daniel High,
is poor basketball.

1202
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:35,408
Think of it during the weekend,

1203
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:37,458
and play basketball
how to,

1204
01:17:37,459 --> 01:17:39,994
will be able to put the uniform of the team...

1205
01:17:39,995 --> 01:17:42,955
if you can not,
forget it.

1206
01:17:46,402 --> 01:17:48,137
If you're smart,
will give up.

1207
01:17:48,138 --> 01:17:49,258
Today it.

1208
01:17:52,441 --> 01:17:55,711
Your tricks will end soon, Pete.

1209
01:17:57,946 --> 01:17:59,247
You are a joke.

1210
01:17:59,248 --> 01:18:02,984
Scream "Pistol" to give
laugh of his tricks. That's all.

1211
01:18:02,985 --> 01:18:05,385
Should break your face.

1212
01:18:17,633 --> 01:18:18,823
Who starts?

1213
01:18:20,235 --> 01:18:21,202
You

1214
01:19:01,076 --> 01:19:02,477
But if you indulge in,

1215
01:19:02,478 --> 01:19:05,444
and use this gift that God gave him
,

1216
01:19:05,445 --> 01:19:08,815
will one day play in the first team
.

1217
01:19:11,954 --> 01:19:14,540
That pain there in the soul of background

1218
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,601
encouraged me to be something better!

1219
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:23,065
I can train you up out of breath,
but while it does not feel something

1220
01:19:23,066 --> 01:19:28,066
burning your soul, my
words are worthless.

1221
01:19:36,512 --> 01:19:38,846
Think... a dream

1222
01:19:38,881 --> 01:19:40,579
is nothing more than a challenge

1223
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:43,120
we put ourselves.

1224
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:51,058
That's it.

1225
01:19:53,328 --> 01:19:55,329
See you Monday night.

1226
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:56,364
No, do not.

1227
01:19:56,365 --> 01:19:57,965
We made a deal!

1228
01:19:57,966 --> 01:19:59,368
That's when you screwed up, Pete.

1229
01:19:59,369 --> 01:20:01,459
You believed in me.

1230
01:20:01,537 --> 01:20:03,404
So why did you come?

1231
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:04,439
What do you think?

1232
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,674
Not want to destroy the diner,

1233
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:09,143
and I hate to ruin my
image in public.

1234
01:20:09,144 --> 01:20:11,412
Especially when I break your face.

1235
01:20:11,413 --> 01:20:12,533
No, Buddy.

1236
01:20:13,615 --> 01:20:15,516
Hey, what are you doing here?

1237
01:20:15,517 --> 01:20:17,051
This has nothing to do with you
.

1238
01:20:17,052 --> 01:20:18,688
Is between Maravich and me.

1239
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:19,643
I.

1240
01:20:20,923 --> 01:20:22,625
"Metal Head"
do not tell me

1241
01:20:22,626 --> 01:20:24,358
you will try to stop me!

1242
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:26,384
It is I who will.

1243
01:20:28,263 --> 01:20:30,283
Made a deal, Buddy.

1244
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:31,969
The Pistol won.

1245
01:20:33,502 --> 01:20:35,872
Are you serious?

1246
01:20:46,582 --> 01:20:48,052
We talked.

1247
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,152
And we play with
the black team.

1248
01:20:51,153 --> 01:20:54,388
Let's find out if we are really good...

1249
01:20:54,389 --> 01:20:56,516
with or without you.

1250
01:20:59,261 --> 01:21:02,461
Now Walk, this
means nothing.

1251
01:21:03,098 --> 01:21:05,399
We can not play with those guys.

1252
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,730
Monday. At 19:30.

1253
01:21:09,104 --> 01:21:13,174
If we discover what we really are.

1254
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:14,175
Let.

1255
01:21:24,152 --> 01:21:27,688
I thought of some things
sitting there a few minutes ago.

1256
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:28,883
Thought?

1257
01:21:30,893 --> 01:21:33,813
See you make me wanna dream
.

1258
01:21:34,062 --> 01:21:36,392
Dream to be an actress?

1259
01:21:37,032 --> 01:21:38,532
Dream at all.

1260
01:21:39,034 --> 01:21:41,334
Take care, Marilyn Monroe.

1261
01:21:43,372 --> 01:21:46,240
Pete, and the Cleveland
beat us?

1262
01:21:46,241 --> 01:21:47,741
There are going to win.

1263
01:21:48,443 --> 01:21:50,244
But what if they win?

1264
01:21:50,245 --> 01:21:53,114
So we can say we tried.

1265
01:21:53,115 --> 01:21:57,315
Let's put on a show that
they will not forget.

1266
01:21:57,486 --> 01:22:00,096
Pete, you are special even.

1267
01:22:02,024 --> 01:22:03,626
I felt a shiver the crown

1268
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:05,677
to the tips of Ps.

1269
01:22:06,161 --> 01:22:08,158
Knew it was a friendly kiss
,

1270
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,498
but I could not help but want

1271
01:22:10,499 --> 01:22:12,829
be a little older.

1272
01:22:12,935 --> 01:22:15,004
Well, at least
Sandy and I could

1273
01:22:15,005 --> 01:22:17,345
share our dreams.

1274
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:22,327
You know, Pete, when I was in college
,

1275
01:22:22,328 --> 01:22:26,581
was called 'Man
Point Per Minute'.

1276
01:22:26,582 --> 01:22:28,649
Many felt that I could not

1277
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:33,644
scoring 36 points per game, but they...

1278
01:22:35,157 --> 01:22:38,047
they were stuck in the past.

1279
01:22:41,563 --> 01:22:45,566
To my knowledge, no
white team

1280
01:22:45,601 --> 01:22:47,403
've played with a team of blacks in this region

1281
01:22:47,404 --> 01:22:50,339
so perhaps
just me and her mother

1282
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,610
're in the stands.

1283
01:22:53,342 --> 01:22:56,232
Mom makes enough noise.

1284
01:22:56,445 --> 01:23:00,265
I will not disagree with you
about it.

1285
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:04,251
Your dreams with some basketball

1286
01:23:04,252 --> 01:23:06,622
times let you discouraged?

1287
01:23:09,324 --> 01:23:10,291
They leave.

1288
01:23:12,094 --> 01:23:13,524
Do you know why?

1289
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:17,691
I think so.

1290
01:23:19,401 --> 01:23:21,661
So why do it?

1291
01:23:24,973 --> 01:23:27,508
If you can create a magical moment
/

1292
01:23:27,509 --> 01:23:30,112
if you can show
fans something they have never seen,

1293
01:23:30,113 --> 01:23:31,580
they will return often,

1294
01:23:31,581 --> 01:23:33,671
either win or lose.

1295
01:23:34,249 --> 01:23:35,685
's Up to you to take them to a place

1296
01:23:35,686 --> 01:23:38,085
they've never been before.

1297
01:23:38,086 --> 01:23:41,316
Give them a
little hope.

1298
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:45,077
I think you discouraged when

1299
01:23:45,078 --> 01:23:47,053
realize that half the people

1300
01:23:47,054 --> 01:23:49,944
who see
never understand.

1301
01:23:51,033 --> 01:23:53,534
They call me sausage.

1302
01:23:53,535 --> 01:23:56,425
But they are always there, waiting

1303
01:23:56,505 --> 01:23:58,632
I give a show.

1304
01:24:00,509 --> 01:24:02,319
So give a show.

1305
01:24:03,111 --> 01:24:08,001
Sometimes, just want to stop,
and be like everyone else.

1306
01:24:11,153 --> 01:24:15,589
This is a choice only you can make
, Pete.

1307
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,750
But if it were me...

1308
01:24:18,326 --> 01:24:22,566
Them give a show to remember
forever.

1309
01:24:24,566 --> 01:24:30,436
But in any
is, love you, Pete.

1310
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:37,901
I will always love you.

1311
01:24:46,388 --> 01:24:48,489
We have to understand

1312
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:50,858
the Cleveland
plays different

1313
01:24:50,859 --> 01:24:54,059
at all times we face.

1314
01:24:54,329 --> 01:24:58,629
They run at full speed
until the final whistle.

1315
01:24:59,301 --> 01:25:02,204
It has three guys with an average

1316
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,429
22 points per game.

1317
01:25:05,674 --> 01:25:08,541
All dart.
They all run.

1318
01:25:09,578 --> 01:25:11,068
Everyone plays.

1319
01:25:13,648 --> 01:25:14,950
Equally proud of their

1320
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:17,151
48 consecutive victories.

1321
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,978
Remember that without Buddy,

1322
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:25,921
can not have many faults.

1323
01:25:28,296 --> 01:25:29,263
Carl.

1324
01:25:34,202 --> 01:25:37,266
Lord, You said all

1325
01:25:37,301 --> 01:25:40,501
is possible for you... Help us.

1326
01:25:40,609 --> 01:25:41,598
Thank you.

1327
01:25:46,047 --> 01:25:48,682
Okay, people,
without mercy!

1328
01:25:48,683 --> 01:25:50,252
One, two, three...

1329
01:25:50,253 --> 01:25:51,185
LIONS!

1330
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,296
Pete, I gave you some freedom
,

1331
01:26:00,297 --> 01:26:02,907
and we won some games.

1332
01:26:03,031 --> 01:26:06,534
We will not win them
playing as them.

1333
01:26:06,535 --> 01:26:11,055
Let's make them the only way we know...

1334
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:18,600
muscle and fundamentals of basketball, right?

1335
01:26:19,014 --> 01:26:20,106
Right.

1336
01:26:41,903 --> 01:26:43,443
At dawn...

1337
01:26:50,912 --> 01:26:54,006
Basic! Basic basketball!

1338
01:27:10,298 --> 01:27:11,993
Defense, people!

1339
01:27:26,982 --> 01:27:28,183
Do not worry about the outcome,

1340
01:27:28,184 --> 01:27:29,149
are going well.

1341
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,419
Technical, they are
killing us.

1342
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:32,466
Keep  Basic.

1343
01:27:32,501 --> 01:27:34,513
Caprichem defense.

1344
01:27:36,091 --> 01:27:38,561
Come on, ending up with them!

1345
01:27:56,244 --> 01:27:58,371
It's show time, Pete!

1346
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,090
Make your move. Do it now!

1347
01:28:12,294 --> 01:28:15,254
Decrease.
And works the ball.

1348
01:28:26,041 --> 01:28:27,921
Helen, I'll be right back.

1349
01:28:28,109 --> 01:28:29,476
In the middle of the game?

1350
01:28:29,477 --> 01:28:31,427
You can scream for me.

1351
01:28:31,913 --> 01:28:33,107
Bring popcorn!

1352
01:28:56,538 --> 01:28:59,239
You're looking at the future Buddy.

1353
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,450
Amazing pitches,
great base.

1354
01:29:03,378 --> 01:29:08,448
Pete and some of these boys
are twenty years ahead.

1355
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:10,813
You have talent, son.

1356
01:29:11,519 --> 01:29:15,059
Or you enter the
boat or will be.

1357
01:29:39,047 --> 01:29:42,649
Walk... Forgot how
make a light trap?

1358
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:50,860
Pete marker is on him like a Siamese twin
, he will not get your help?

1359
01:29:56,598 --> 01:29:58,198
What's wrong with you?

1360
01:29:58,199 --> 01:30:00,100
They act as if they could not
earn them.

1361
01:30:00,101 --> 01:30:02,401
We can beat them.

1362
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:07,074
I think I was
wrong with this team.

1363
01:30:07,075 --> 01:30:09,965
I thought you had passion.

1364
01:30:14,282 --> 01:30:16,372
Can I say something?

1365
01:30:20,121 --> 01:30:23,321
I have to ask apologize to you.

1366
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:24,691
I was a fool this year

1367
01:30:24,692 --> 01:30:27,388
and say, I'm sorry.

1368
01:30:30,365 --> 01:30:32,499
This team means everything to me,

1369
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,530
although I like selfish /

1370
01:30:36,571 --> 01:30:38,211
well, I was selfish.

1371
01:30:39,641 --> 01:30:41,700
Father, just want to play.

1372
01:30:45,447 --> 01:30:48,439
Okay. Get dressed,

1373
01:30:49,651 --> 01:30:51,811
Come on, we will win!

1374
01:30:59,127 --> 01:31:00,807
No hard feelings?

1375
01:31:01,396 --> 01:31:03,076
No hard feelings.

1376
01:31:03,264 --> 01:31:07,634
Why would we win, we will have to work together
.

1377
01:31:07,635 --> 01:31:08,932
Hey, Buddy.

1378
01:31:09,137 --> 01:31:09,969
What?

1379
01:31:10,004 --> 01:31:13,507
I still think you
is a hard head.

1380
01:31:13,508 --> 01:31:14,558
I also.

1381
01:31:21,382 --> 01:31:23,085
Okay, where
is the first team?

1382
01:31:23,086 --> 01:31:27,044
CD, Moose, Vick, Pete...

1383
01:31:28,123 --> 01:31:30,423
I know coach Walker out.

1384
01:31:31,626 --> 01:31:33,360
That's it.
We earn them. Come on.

1385
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:35,451
One, two, three, Lions!

1386
01:31:37,632 --> 01:31:39,293
Two, two!

1387
01:31:43,171 --> 01:31:45,021
Keep track!

1388
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:52,902
Now I see!
Pistol, Pistol!

1389
01:32:30,151 --> 01:32:32,244
Pete! Calm!

1390
01:32:41,729 --> 01:32:43,931
This boy! That's it!

1391
01:32:43,932 --> 01:32:45,402
Defense, folks!

1392
01:32:54,976 --> 01:32:56,786
Not so bad.

1393
01:32:57,579 --> 01:32:59,389
Well, if it works out.

1394
01:33:01,482 --> 01:33:03,918
Defense, defense, defense.

1395
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:06,087
Defense, defense

1396
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:07,315
Defense.

1397
01:33:14,662 --> 01:33:16,512
Time, time, time.

1398
01:33:21,236 --> 01:33:23,403
Okay, everyone here!

1399
01:33:23,404 --> 01:33:25,239
We have time
to a pitch.

1400
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,573
Pete, you made me believe.

1401
01:33:26,574 --> 01:33:28,143
We will see a bit of its magic.

1402
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:30,164
One, Two, Three Lions!

1403
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:40,320
Come on, boys!

1404
01:34:00,742 --> 01:34:07,443
We won!

1405
01:34:08,216 --> 01:34:13,068
Daniel Lions! We won!

1406
01:34:13,103 --> 01:34:17,920
No point,
was not the point!

1407
01:34:18,359 --> 01:34:20,424
As well, was not the point?

1408
01:34:20,425 --> 01:34:23,245
The weather still was running.

1409
01:34:23,531 --> 01:34:24,933
The last time I was stolen,

1410
01:34:24,934 --> 01:34:26,333
they wore a mask!

1411
01:34:26,334 --> 01:34:28,115
We won them and you know it.

1412
01:34:28,116 --> 01:34:30,586
Still have the best team.

1413
01:34:32,173 --> 01:34:33,813
For the locker room!

1414
01:34:49,590 --> 01:35:00,296
Pistol, Pistol, Pistol...

1415
01:35:01,602 --> 01:35:05,238
Words can not express how I felt
.

1416
01:35:05,239 --> 01:35:08,229
It was now heir of a Dream /

1417
01:35:08,276 --> 01:35:11,476
a dream that came true
.

1418
01:35:12,146 --> 01:35:13,926
Dad was right.

1419
01:35:14,482 --> 01:35:18,085
The fans wanted to live
a magical moment...

1420
01:35:18,086 --> 01:35:21,852
One moment
could fly high,

1421
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:25,959
they could believe that anything was possible.

1422
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:29,623
Win or winning, they would come

1423
01:35:29,964 --> 01:35:33,233
game after game to see
a boy of loose socks

1424
01:35:33,234 --> 01:35:35,566
known as Pistol.

1425
01:35:36,904 --> 01:35:39,139
Press Maravich gave his son
a great gift of love:

1426
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:41,975
A life dedicated to see the dreams
your child come true.

1427
01:35:41,976 --> 01:35:44,544
These dreams have given life to
made of Pistol Pete Maravich,

1428
01:35:44,545 --> 01:35:46,980
the more professional basketball
young to join the HAII of Fame.

1429
01:35:46,981 --> 01:35:49,216
For over 20 years, your brand
stood the test of time.

1430
01:35:49,217 --> 01:35:52,285
Pistol Pete remains the
of all time scorer in college basketball,

1431
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:55,489
With an average of
44.2 points per game.

1432
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:57,290
"The Pistol"
is dedicated to the memory of

1433
01:35:57,291 --> 01:36:00,351
"Pistol" Pete Maravich

1434
01:36:00,461 --> 01:36:02,262
As a legacy to their children
and children around the world...

1435
01:36:02,263 --> 01:36:03,597
That love never fails, the character does not give up
,

1436
01:36:03,598 --> 01:36:09,158
and with patience and persistence,
dreams become reality.

1437
01:36:17,278 --> 01:36:18,878
Close my eyes

1438
01:36:18,913 --> 01:36:23,763
I see when you were there

1439
01:36:23,798 --> 01:36:28,613
I can hear his words

1440
01:36:30,658 --> 01:36:34,227
Now I who calls

1441
01:36:34,262 --> 01:36:37,497
Through the windows of my heart

1442
01:36:37,532 --> 01:36:43,095
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

1443
01:36:43,905 --> 01:36:46,874
Memories survive,

1444
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:49,976
The dream will not die

1445
01:36:50,478 --> 01:36:56,314
Love will never go away

1446
01:36:56,684 --> 01:36:59,915
Under the rain I'll be

1447
01:36:59,987 --> 01:37:04,574
Chasing the shadows until dawn

1448
01:37:04,609 --> 01:37:09,162
I'm still calling your
name when I sleep

1449
01:37:10,064 --> 01:37:13,363
In the rain I'll be

1450
01:37:13,434 --> 01:37:16,737
Chasing the shadows in the dark

1451
01:37:16,772 --> 01:37:20,041
Tell me why
cry myself to sleep

1452
01:37:20,076 --> 01:37:22,407
Or stand there, awake

1453
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:26,207
Under the rain

1454
01:37:32,153 --> 01:37:35,589
In all our
moments together

1455
01:37:35,624 --> 01:37:38,991
I never knew what I felt

1456
01:37:39,026 --> 01:37:43,588
Looking back
still remember

1457
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,534
Although you party

1458
01:37:47,535 --> 01:37:52,573
All I have to do is call
your name

1459
01:37:52,608 --> 01:37:58,239
Keep me,
umbrella is me night

1460
01:37:59,046 --> 01:38:01,810
Memories survive

1461
01:38:02,016 --> 01:38:05,042
The dream will not die

1462
01:38:05,419 --> 01:38:11,358
Love will never go away

1463
01:38:11,859 --> 01:38:14,927
Under the rain I'll be

1464
01:38:14,962 --> 01:38:19,696
Chasing the shadows until dawn

1465
01:38:19,731 --> 01:38:24,431
I'm still calling your name when I sleep

1466
01:38:25,172 --> 01:38:28,403
Under the rain I'll be

1467
01:38:28,509 --> 01:38:31,829
Chasing the shadows in the dark

1468
01:38:31,864 --> 01:38:35,149
Tell me why
cry myself to sleep

1469
01:38:35,184 --> 01:38:37,845
or stand there, awake

1470
01:38:38,052 --> 01:38:41,078
Under the rain

1471
01:39:19,927 --> 01:39:23,090
Under the rain I'll be

1472
01:39:23,164 --> 01:39:27,351
Chasing the shadows until dawn

1473
01:39:27,386 --> 01:39:31,539
I'm still calling your name when I sleep

1474
01:39:31,574 --> 01:39:33,306
When sleep

1475
01:39:33,341 --> 01:39:36,606
Under the rain I'll be

1476
01:39:36,877 --> 01:39:40,248
Chasing
shadows until dawn

1477
01:39:40,249 --> 01:39:43,350
Tell me why
cry myself to sleep

1478
01:39:43,351 --> 01:39:45,876
or stand there, awake

1479
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:52,183
Under the rain
