1
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:15,518
( dog thinking )
Enough of this cold weather.

2
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:19,225
I say, this year we spend Christmas
someplace warm and sunny.

3
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:24,035
Whoa-ho-ho.
Now that's what I call holiday stylin'.

4
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:27,006
Santa elves ain't got nothing
on old Zeus Bannister.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,167
Boom.

6
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:31,507
Shebang.

7
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:35,106
What am I thinking?
We're going to California.

8
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:37,275
I'm going to sweat my fur off
in this thing.

9
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:49,952
Bathing suit, check.

10
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:53,332
Backup bathing suit, check.

11
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:56,233
T-shirt, check.

12
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:00,730
Red thing, check.

13
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:03,208
California, here I come.

14
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:06,235
Bright sun, beautiful beaches, mixed
with a little Malibu Christmas spirit.

15
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,769
What more can you ask for?
Whoo-hoo!

16
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:09,111
( phone ringing )

17
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:10,639
Can someone get that?

18
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:13,209
( sighs )
A canine's work is never done.

19
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,256
Woman:
Hello?

20
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:22,887
- ( panting on phone )
- George? Is that you?

21
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:24,089
( whines )

22
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:26,395
George, did you have
that shrimp toast

23
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:28,867
- from that Chinese restaurant?
- ( barks )

24
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,767
I don't even go there anymore.

25
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:32,101
Woman: Oh, honey.
You sound horrible.

26
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:33,367
Zeus:
It's Zeus, Grandma.

27
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:34,931
What, you don't speak dog?

28
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,842
Oh-- um, well, anyway.
I just wanted to call

29
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:42,076
and wish you both bon voyage
to sunny California.

30
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,913
Surfer dude!
Yeah.

31
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:47,749
Well, have a great time,
a safe trip, okay?

32
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:51,315
And give my grandkids
a big hug and smooch for me.

33
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:52,586
Zeus, too.

34
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:56,255
Zeus:
Aw, right back at you, Grandma.

35
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:58,287
Oh, and also, um--

36
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,730
( terrier thinking )
Uh, Grandma.

37
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,233
Do you know
who you're talking to?

38
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:02,428
Grandma:
Oh, be safe, all right?

39
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:04,937
And, George, bring extra underwear.
You never know.

40
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,563
Zeus:
TMI.

41
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:08,540
Just-- yeah.
My advice.

42
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:11,271
Okay, um--
oh, and say hi to Belinda.

43
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:12,471
- I hope she's good.
- ( beeping )

44
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:16,175
Oh, George, I have to go.
My cookies are on fire.

45
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:19,185
Bye. Oh, God.
No!

46
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:23,351
Kids: Zeus!

00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:36,665
Who says you need
snowmen and icicles, huh?

53
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:40,299
Malibu, here we come.

55

00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:48,737
Here we go.
Out we go.

57
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:50,306
Zeus:
Hello, California.

58
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,788
- Hey, Ben. Could you take Zeus?
- Woman: Got everything?

59
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:57,221
Thanks.

60
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:59,691
Kara: Mine's the pink one.
Mine's the pink one.

61
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:00,920
Here you go.

62
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:03,691
George, you wanna help him
with the bags? Here you go.

63
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,824
Like I said, George...

64
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:11,394
Zeus: Hope these cars
come with doggie seats.

65
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:13,303
We should have made
a reservation, that's all.

66
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,331
Belinda, I think your hormones
are driving you crazy.

67
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,808
Belinda:
Oh, don't be so thick, George.

68
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:18,606
This is the busiest
time of year.

69
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:21,205
Okay, but you don't need a reservation
if you have a little Bannister charm.

70
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:23,216
- Who can resist that?
- Hello.

71
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,718
Happy holidays
and welcome to Ride and Save.

72
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,379
Well, hello, beautiful.
How are you?

73
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,253
I'm George Bannister.
This is my wife Belinda and our--

74
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,019
- Hello.
- George: ...lovely kids.

75
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:34,084
Hey, kids. Say hello.

76
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,389
( muttering )

77
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,396
- Ow!
- ( gasps )

78
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,489
Dad, Ben put gum
in my hair.

79
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,433
Kids, kids, kids.
Go sit down.

80
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:42,696
Belinda:
Just go sit down.

81
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:45,534
We've been thinking
about putting them up for adoption.

82
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:47,335
( sighs )
No, we haven't.

83
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:49,899
Just kidding.
We'd like to rent a car, though.

84
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:52,207
Well, what's the name
on the reservation?

85
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:54,836
George:
Yeah, um...

86
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,112
check under Bannister.
It's, uh--

87
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:59,914
You won't find it,
but you could check.

88
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,319
I was gonna make a reservation,
and then I--

89
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,220
We are visiting his older sister
for Christmas.

90
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:06,452
I forgot.

91
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:08,586
You have no reservation?

92
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:12,029
It's three days to Christmas.
The busiest travel time of the year.

93
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,761
I can't even rent a car
without a reservation.

94
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,065
People don't understand
the importance of reservation.

95
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:20,800
It means "to reserve." It means
"to put on hold for an appointed time."

96
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,899
I understand, but, uh...

97
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:25,844
maybe without the reservation,

98
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,973
take a look at my friend,
Mr. Abe Lincoln, there.

99
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,313
Do you have any friends
named Jackson,

100
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:33,182
Grant, or Franklin?

101
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,743
Probably.
Let me check.

102
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:39,257
( groans )

103
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,850
Zeus.

104
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:44,330
You must be so hot
in your sweater in California.

105
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,093
Let's take it off.

106
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:50,164
( gasps )
Let's see what I can do.

107
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:51,431
Fantastic.

108
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:52,733
( meows )

109
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,899
( cat thinking )
Nice sweater, sugar lips.

110
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,035
Trade you a scratch pad for it.

111
00:04:58,078 --> 00:04:59,409
Zeus:
Pfft, no way.

112
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:00,811
It was a Christmas gift
from Georgie.

113
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:03,145
Cat: "It was a Christmas gift
from Georgie."

114
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,912
Zeus:
Oh, wisenheimer, huh?

115
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,543
Maybe I'm gonna
teach you a lesson.

116
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:10,489
Kara, Ben:
Zeus, where are you going?

117
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:38,711
( whines )

118
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,083
Cat:
Nice try, mutt.

119
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,348
( barking )

120
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:43,049
Cat: Also, this afternoon,
I'm handing out

121
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,148
free souvenir postcards.

122
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,122
Don't forget to write.

123
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,819
Zeus:
Ugh, gross.

124
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:52,832
Get back, you little--

125
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,960
- Cool!
- Radical!

126
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:58,334
Oh! I think
the baby likes it, too.

127
00:05:58,371 --> 00:05:59,668
There's some kicking going on.

128
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,731
- I wanna feel.
- Me first, shorty face.

129
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,367
- Okay, all right.
- Guys, guys. Come on.

130
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,604
Let's hit the open road.

131
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,544
Thank you.
Where's Zeus?

132
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,342
( Zeus barking )

133
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,350
Cat:
You're too slow to catch me.

134
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:13,045
Zeus:
We'll see about that.

135
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,785
Timber!

136
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:23,222
( gasps )

137
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:24,287
Cat:
That's a wrap.

138
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,958
- Zeus!
- George: Aw, Zeus.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,831
What'd you do, buddy?

140
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:31,268
Zeus:
Ho ho ho?

141
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:48,179
Man:
Hey, it's no use, Babs.

142
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,682
You can't beat me,
so you might as well not even try.

143
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,981
In fact, you should
just concede now.

144
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,183
McFinnegan, you're exceptionally
delusional this morning.

145
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:59,088
First, I clobbered you

146
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:03,221
with that full-sized witch's cauldron
on Halloween,

147
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,663
then the 15-foot turkey float
on Thanksgiving,

148
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:08,792
and who can forget
last Christmas' extravaganza?

149
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,894
Two dozen wooden soldiers

150
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:13,371
and a little drummer boy--

151
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,636
fully animated.

152
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:17,871
I remember.

153
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:22,041
That's why I vowed
to put you to the canvas this year.

154
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:24,709
I'm shaking in my Crocs.

155
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,345
I want you to know
that this season,

156
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,514
my house will be
so brightly lit

157
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:32,719
that they'll be able to see it
from the North Pole.

158
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,250
( chuckles )
North Pole?

159
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:36,762
Yeah.

160
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,264
Who's delusional now, Babs?

161
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,130
( laughs )

162
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:44,034
Not me, sister!

163
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,037
( honking horn )

164
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:57,007
Hi! Welcome!

165
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,677
- Hi, Babs!
- Park at the base of the stairs.

166
00:08:58,718 --> 00:08:59,980
George: Hey, Babs!
Good to see you!

167
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,748
I don't remember
Aunt Barbara's house being so big.

168
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,813
George:
Well, it's more Uncle Charlie's.

169
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,018
- Belinda: Well, okay. George--
- I'm just saying.

170
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,686
Kara: How come we don't live
in a house like this, Daddy?

171
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:11,254
'Cause, honey. You're either
blessed with money or charm.

172
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:14,357
- Aunt Barbara!
- We are blessed with charm.

173
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,327
Aunt Barbara!

174
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:19,804
Good to see you!

175
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,272
Ooh.

176
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:23,965
Hey.

177
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,535
- Hi, welcome home.
- George: Hi, how are you?

178
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,240
- You look so good.
- Thank you.

179
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:29,976
- George. George.
- Good to have you guys.

180
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:31,881
- Honey, come on.
- Can you help me out of here?

181
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:33,977
Yeah, let's help this poor lady
out of the car.

182
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,285
- Hi!
- Hi! Welcome!

183
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:38,984
- Barbara: Oh, please come in.
- Belinda: Great to see you.

184
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:40,890
Okay, come on, kids.
Let's go.

185
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,417
( grunting )

186
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:43,656
Almost ran into the belly.

187
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,459
- Come on, Zeusie.
- Ow!

188
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,729
Lookit! Come on, Zeusie.
Let's go.

189
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,497
Oh, lookit.
It's gorgeous.

190
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:52,197
Come on, honey.
Come on.

191
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:53,933
Babs: We've got good things
for you, too, Zeus.

192
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:55,964
Belinda:
Oh, look at this.

193
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,636
Oh, it's gorgeous.
Did you do all this yourself?

194
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,547
Babs: Okay, I want you to go in,
go look at the tree.

195
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,278
Awesome.

196
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:07,445
( gasps )
Cool, Aunt Barbara.

197
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,547
( gasps )
Oh, it's beautiful.

198
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,717
Yeah, well. That's what happens
when you marry a rich guy.

199
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,784
- Ooh, it must be nice.
- Babs: Thank you very much.

200
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,091
Now stay right there
'cause I wanna get your present.

201
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,859
Babs, Christmas
isn't for three days.

202
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:21,025
Very good, that's good.
You can count, I can count.

203
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,466
I was a mathlete, remember?

204
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,299
Yes, we know.
You were a mathlete.

205
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,032
You tell us every time
we're together.

206
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:28,097
Zeus:
I smell a plot.

207
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,632
Barbara, you didn't have
to get us anything.

208
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,508
Yes, I did need to
get you something.

209
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,342
You're gonna see it right now.

210
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:36,372
Okay.

211
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,281
I wonder what it could be.

212
00:10:38,318 --> 00:10:41,082
Last year she got me
a shaving kit.

213
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,781
- I can't even grow stubble.
- ( giggling )

214
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:46,519
Okay, Ben. Ben?
It is the thought that counts.

215
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,494
And one day, that will come in
very handy.

216
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,723
We hope.
Ooh, hey. What's this?

217
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,424
Okay, okay.
Here it is.

218
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:54,490
Oh, thank you, George.
Set it down very carefully.

219
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,128
Okay.
Drumroll.

220
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,660
( slapping legs )

221
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:02,974
( all gasping )
A puppy!

222
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:04,533
( puppy thinking )
You were expecting a gremlin?

223
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:06,169
- Kara: I wanna hold it!
- Come here, you.

224
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:07,543
Oh, please, please,
let me hold her.

225
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,980
Zeus:
Oh, great. There goes the neighborhood.

226
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:12,041
- Ben: Me first!
- George: Okay, don't fight.

227
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:14,918
- Here, let your sister hold her.
- Oh, she is cute.

228
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:18,446
George: Oh, my gosh.
Not only cute, but adorable.

229
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:19,685
What are you gonna call her?

230
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:21,023
How about Christmas?

231
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,358
You can't name a dog
Christmas, dummy.

232
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,159
She'll get confused
during the holidays.

233
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:27,928
Benjamin Bannister.
Do not call your sister a dummy.

234
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,561
I won't call her one
if she doesn't act like one.

235
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:32,332
- George--
- Yeah, it's true.

236
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:34,272
You shouldn't act like one.
Then you don't get called one.

237
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:35,968
That's the rule.
All right, you know what, Ben?

238
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,738
You shouldn't call your sister
a dummy, okay?

239
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,610
- Why?
- Because it's the holiday season.

240
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:43,945
And you just don't-- there's no dummies
around during the holidays.

241
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,044
How about Eve?
Short for Christmas Eve.

242
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:48,610
- Oh.
- Sweetheart, Eve.

243
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:51,418
- Honey, that's perfect.
- I can live with that.

244
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:54,426
Yeah, I love the sound of that.
Eve Bannister.

245
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,690
Eve:
In with the new, out with the old.

246
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:58,663
Babs:
So, it's official, then.

247
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,529
I want you to
make yourselves at home

248
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,330
and I'm gonna go string up
lots of electric lights.

249
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:04,734
Ciao.

250
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:08,207
Oh, Zeusie, look.
You've got a little sister.

251
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,106
Ben:
Like a mini Zeus.

252
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:11,940
Eve:
Hey, you. What's your name?

253
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:13,570
Zeus:
I'm Zeus.

254
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:15,342
Former canine police dog.

255
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:18,612
But you can just call me
"big boss man" or "big brother."

256
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:19,743
Whichever's easier.

257
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,947
Eve:
Cool. Big brother it is.

258
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:23,250
Zeus:
That's great.

259
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:50,940
Man: This looks like a good place
to open up shop.

260
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,974
There we go.

261
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:58,288
Morning.

262
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,720
Man: Stewey, would you
look at this view?

263
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,059
( cooing )

264
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,867
How many dogs we got
on the roster today?

265
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:14,736
This is it.

266
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:16,366
That's bad, Ted.
Bad.

267
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,741
Look, I thought the idea
would take off by now.

268
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:20,507
I thought we'd have
a franchise by now.

269
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:22,810
- But we ain't.
- Yeah, I know.

270
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,613
How was I supposed to know they were
gonna open up a five-star doggie spa

271
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:28,279
- right down the friggin' street?
- We shoulda done what I said.

272
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,585
We coulda opened up a
butcher-slash-ice-cream place

273
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:32,750
right on the beach.
We would be in big money right now.

274
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,225
Okay, here we go again.

275
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,024
And to boot, we had to borrow money
from that Tony Rowe

276
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,122
for this non-moneymaking
dog-washing venture.

277
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:40,564
- Enough, Stewey.
- And the guy,

278
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,795
let me tell you something.
The guy's a slippery snake.

279
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,700
That's why
I never shake his hand.

280
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,672
Because I don't wanna get
none of that evil grease on me.

281
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,675
Lemme tell you something.
The guy's a real--

282
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,869
- ( whines )
- ...nice guy.

283
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:56,647
Oh, Mr. Rowe.
How are you, s--

284
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,609
Well, well.
If it isn't Dumb and Dumber.

285
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,788
Look, Mr. Rowe, I was--

286
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,352
Come on. Take a walk with me.
The both of you two.

287
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,226
Mr. Rowe:
Come on.

288
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,526
Let's go.

289
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,194
You two boys
have been ducking me.

290
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:18,431
Rowe:
You see, I have this sixth sense.

291
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:22,771
And this sixth sense is telling me
that you're about to confess

292
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:25,140
the reason that you
don't have my scratch

293
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:27,203
is because going into this

294
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:31,376
mobile dog van
grooming business

295
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:35,251
was the stupidest idea
that ever crossed your two feeble minds.

296
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:36,915
- Stewey: He must be a psychic.
- Shh.

297
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:39,049
Mr. Rowe, sir.

298
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:42,060
Business has been
extremely bad

299
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:44,255
and, as a result,

300
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:47,994
currently we don't have
your money.

301
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:50,229
You don't have my money?

302
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:51,896
No, sir.

303
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,675
Show me their thumbs.

304
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:57,698
( groaning )

305
00:14:57,743 --> 00:15:00,871
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo.

306
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:03,108
These two thumbs
are about to go.

307
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,446
No, no,
please, please, please.

308
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:06,178
( whispering )

309
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,121
Not bad, Mikey.

310
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,648
Did you hear that, Richie?
Initiative.

311
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,891
Mikey just reminded me
you two used to be second-story guys.

312
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,260
You know, that's where
you broke into homes,

313
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,200
you robbed them,
you stole things from them.

314
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,864
Am I speaking English?
Nod so I know you're listening to me.

315
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,497
- Ted: Yes, sir.
- Okay.

316
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,201
So maybe we could
work out a deal here.

317
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:30,573
Anything, Mr. Rowe.

318
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,805
Anything?
Good answer.

319
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,608
I want you to go
to this place.

320
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,080
Now, you're gonna find
a lot of things,

321
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:37,412
but there's only
one thing I want.

322
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,681
There's only one object
of true value.

323
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,483
And that's the star.

324
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:46,218
They say it shines with the brilliance
of a hundred diamonds.

325
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:52,354
Or so they say.
Now you bring me that star,

326
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:54,866
to show you that I don't
harbor bad feelings,

327
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,562
I'm not a hard-hearted guy,

328
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:01,266
I'll not only forgive you
for the insult of nonpayment...

329
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:05,143
I'll even let you
keep your thumbs.

330
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:07,077
All right, I'll let you keep
both of them.

331
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:08,740
Thank you very much,
Mr. Rowe.

332
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,011
Okay, good.
So I'm gonna meet you right here,

333
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,984
Christmas Eve,
midnight. Got it?

334
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,988
So is that...
late night on the 23rd?

335
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:17,683
- Or is that the 24th--
- Look, look.

336
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:19,315
Let me make this
very simple.

337
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:21,918
Christmas, 1:00 a.m.
in the morning.

338
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,258
Right here.
Does that work for you?

339
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,161
Because I don't want to interrupt
your schedules.

340
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,496
I'll collect the star,
and I'll collect my dog. Here.

341
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,229
- Dog?
- Yeah.

342
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,827
You're gonna clip her nails.

343
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:34,999
Then you're gonna paint them red
for Christmas. Aren't they, sweetheart?

344
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,669
And then I want you to scrub
the undercarriage.

345
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,177
Make it nice and nice.

346
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:41,111
- Yes, of course.
- Okay?

347
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,876
- Okay, sir.
- Merry Christmas, boys.

348
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,712
Don't disappoint me.

349
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,776
Make way.

350
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:51,084
Richie:
Take good care of the dog.

351
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:57,018
Belinda: "Put on a piece of jewelry
that will stir up a little nostalgia

352
00:16:57,063 --> 00:17:00,032
and help him unleash
his animal within."

353
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,000
Hmm.

354
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:05,770
Oh.

355
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:09,172
The first gift
you ever gave me, George.

356
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,909
Oh, where is the other one?

357
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,918
( sighs )
I must be losing my mind.

358
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:30,289
( sighs )

359
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:33,162
Belinda:
Oh, it's beautiful.

360
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,791
Babs:
These are our baby pictures.

361
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:38,133
Oh, your second husband
was such a romantic.

362
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,604
Yes, he was.
He really was.

363
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:43,403
I wish George was
a little more like that.

364
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,569
Zeus:
So since I'm your new big brother,

365
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:47,203
I wanna school you
on a few things

366
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:49,840
pertaining to living
with the Bannisters.

367
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,042
Eve:
Okay, shoot.

368
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,914
Zeus: Now me and Georgie,
we go way back.

369
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:54,544
Okay? We're like, real tight.

370
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,020
See, we have a routine going.

371
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,455
Every morning,
I bring him his slippers and his paper.

372
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:01,051
Bottom line is,
I'm Georgie's favorite,

373
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,357
so don't expect
too much attention from him.

374
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,795
How are you two
getting along?

375
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,957
- Zeus: Us? Don't ask.
- Belinda: Great.

376
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,130
Well, you know.

377
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,195
Like any long-term
relationship,

378
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,537
we have our peaks
and our valleys.

379
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:17,599
- Are you in a valley?
- Oh, no. No.

380
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:20,203
No, we're not in a valley.

381
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,376
Well, you know.
With-- with the kids and work

382
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:27,249
and the new baby coming,

383
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:29,652
you know,
things have gotten a little...

384
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:30,985
Stale?

385
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:33,048
- Mm.
- The cookie?

386
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,889
Oh, no.
The cookie's very good.

387
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,623
- The marriage?
- Mm-hmm.

388
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:40,257
Um, do you have
any ketchup?

389
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:43,700
For... the cookie?

390
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:45,431
I'm putting it on everything.

391
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:49,066
You know, if you ask me,
every marriage needs a little spark.

392
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:52,134
You know? And the anniversary time
is a perfect time to do that.

393
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:54,373
Don't you think?
You could have a picnic

394
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,880
overlooking Bel Air.

395
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:58,816
You could have a moonlit supper
on the beach.

396
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,512
You know,
something like that.

397
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,921
Well, I mean, George
hasn't mentioned anything yet.

398
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:08,586
He "hasn't mentioned
anything yet"?

399
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:11,494
But-- but it's your
20th anniversary

400
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,054
the day after Christmas
and it's almost--

401
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:16,067
- I know, I know. I do know that.
- Christmas.

402
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:17,329
I do know that.

403
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:18,734
Zeus:
Look, the way I see it,

404
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:21,831
in order to get along, there are
three rules you need to live by.

405
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:23,501
Eve:
Should I write them down?

406
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:24,634
Zeus:
Good one.

407
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:28,113
First is, never share a bone
with a dog that's foaming at the mouth.

408
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:29,580
Okay? Second is,

409
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:33,278
never lap up toilet water.
Especially at night.

410
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,787
George hasn't forgotten
our anniversary.

411
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,550
No, of course. Pfft!

412
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,683
Zeus:
And the third and most important,

413
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:41,590
whatever you do,
no matter what,

414
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:45,119
never, ever chew anything
that's not meant to be chewed.

415
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:48,099
Like expensive women's shoes.

416
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:51,569
Eve:
Uh-oh. What should I do with this?

417
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:53,367
Zeus:
I suggest you lay low for a bit

418
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:54,929
and let me try to fix that.

419
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:59,508
Hmm, let me see if I can fix this shoe
so she doesn't get in trouble.

420
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,308
Remember that time
he forgot your birthday

421
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:05,306
and he got a calzone
and put birthday candles on that?

422
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:08,343
That was only because
he knows that I love calzones.

423
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:09,979
And I know that.

424
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:13,116
And that was extremely creative
and wonderful.

425
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:14,785
Right.

426
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:21,026
Oh, Zeusie.
What do you have there?

427
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,364
Zeus:
Oh, just trying to reshape the heel.

428
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:25,768
- Almost done.
- What does he-- Zeus!

429
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:27,795
My Terragamo shoes.

430
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,536
Bad boy, Zeusie.
Oh.

431
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:32,544
If you wanted a snack,
you could just have asked.

432
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:33,943
Zeus:
No, but this wasn't my fault.

433
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:37,540
This was a crocodile skin
Terragamo heel.

434
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,050
Some of my favorites.

435
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:43,350
Hey, hey, Babs.
I'm so sorry that, uh...

436
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:45,721
He's usually a good guy
and well-behaved.

437
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:47,316
So whatever your shoes are,
just let me know

438
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,849
and I'll be happy
to pay for them.

439
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:52,262
- Two thousand.
- Dollars?

440
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:55,827
It happens.
I'm over it.

441
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:58,894
Just make sure he's not chewing
on my undies somewhere.

442
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,401
What are they, 13 bucks?

443
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:07,339
- Hey, buddy. Look.
- Zeus: But, George...

444
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:09,108
We're guests here
at Aunt Barbara's house, okay?

445
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:12,242
She was nice enough to invite us here
for the holidays.

446
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:14,479
- You gotta respect her stuff.
- Zeus: But, George, I--

447
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,613
I don't want you chewing shoes

448
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:19,283
or undies or--

449
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:21,316
I can't believe I said that.

450
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,328
- ( barks )
- Okay?

451
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:24,954
- ( barks )
- Okay.

452
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:29,328
Eve:
Rule number one, Zeusie.

453
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:31,700
Never chew anything
that's not meant to be chewed.

454
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:33,534
Zeus:
Wow, I am gonna have my hands full

455
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:35,437
- with this little coconut.
- George: Come on in.

456
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,847
( laughs )
There it is.

457
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:47,886
Stewey: Who owns that,
the Kardashians?

458
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,048
No, it's the widow of some rich
philanthropist guy.

459
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,990
Some kind of antique collector.

460
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:54,185
He was loaded.

461
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,750
So he kicks the bucket,

462
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:57,694
he wills this house to her,

463
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,290
along with some
very nice collectibles.

464
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:03,130
- The star.
- Exactamundo.

465
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:07,271
- How'd you know this stuff?
- Wikipedia.

466
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:09,974
Stewey:
So when do we rob the joint?

467
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:11,943
First thing's last, okay?

468
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:14,309
First, we gotta surveil this girl.
Get some intel.

469
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:16,837
Find out what Babs'
daily routine is.

470
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:19,976
Maybe see if we can find out
where she might hide the star.

471
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,987
That's easier said than done, Ted.
Look at that joint.

472
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:25,889
Uh-huh.
That's what this is for, Stewey.

473
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:28,654
I boosted this stuff from that spy shop
over on Crenshaw.

474
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:31,356
Wow.
Ted, this is real James Bond stuff.

475
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:32,694
Look at this.

476
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:35,325
McCann,
Stewey McCann.

477
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,597
What is wrong with you?
Give me--

478
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:41,536
Our ears.

479
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:43,666
A hearing aid.

480
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:45,438
It don't fit.

481
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:48,071
Idiot, this goes in your ear.

482
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:51,879
That, you plant
along the side of the house.

483
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,407
- When are we gonna do this?
- Next week.

484
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,181
- Really?
- No, you idiot.

485
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,711
Not unless you want to hitchhike
with your freakin' pinkies.

486
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:59,621
- We go now.
- Today?

487
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:03,424
You go. You plant that device
along the side of the house.

488
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:05,896
- I'll be your lookout.
- Ted, there's commando stuff.

489
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:07,421
Watch this.

490
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:23,612
Ted. Ted.

491
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,612
That's it, that's it.

492
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:42,496
Eve:
Wanna chase each other's tails?

493
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:43,899
Zeus:
No. Not into it.

494
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,198
Eve:
Yeah, you're right.

495
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:48,001
A dog your age shouldn't be
exerting himself too much.

496
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,200
Zeus:
Listen, puppy chow.

497
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,004
You're lucky I'm not a snitch.

498
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,305
Eve:
What are you talking about?

499
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:54,312
Zeus:
I took the rap for you back there.

500
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:55,813
Eve:
It was a joke, Zeusie.

501
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:58,078
How many times
you gonna bring it up?

502
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,415
Zeus:
Until I feel better about it.

503
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:02,317
Eve:
I said I was sorry.

504
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:04,254
You want a bucket of bones
to go with it?

505
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,257
Zeus:
It's a good start.

506
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:12,494
( gasps )

507
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,328
Try to be discreet.

508
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:17,892
Ted, I am being discreet.

509
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,731
Come on, chop, chop,
Stewey. What are you doing?

510
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:26,244
Ted, I can't believe
you're making me do this.

511
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:33,411
Okay, Babs is out front.

512
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,943
Now is your time.
Plant the device and flee.

513
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:38,286
- Here?
- Ted: Plant the device and flee!

514
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:40,553
Put it up high! Higher!

515
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:41,991
I can't reach, Ted.
I threw out my back.

516
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:43,517
I'm not jumping up and down.
I'll hurt it again.

517
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:47,362
Nobody told you to mud wrestle
those barmaids blindfolded.

518
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,697
Eve:
Here, Zeus. A peace offering.

519
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:50,963
Zeus:
What is that?

520
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:52,664
Eve:
I don't know.

521
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:54,035
- I found it in George's room.
- Zeus: Hey.

522
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:56,802
What did I tell you about touching stuff
that doesn't belong to you?

523
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:59,504
Ted's voice on earpiece:
Now plant that device on the windowsill.

524
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:01,672
Do it on three.
One...

525
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:04,181
two, three.

526
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:05,683
( flatulence sputters )

527
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:08,208
- Zeus: Did you hear that?
- Eve: Hear what?

528
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:10,016
Ted's voice:
Jump, Stewey. Jump.

529
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:11,386
I did it, Ted.
I did it.

530
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:16,119
- ( barking )
- ( yelling )

531
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:20,129
Okay, okay. It's on there.
It's good, it's good.

532
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:22,429
Now get out of there, Stewey.
Flee, flee, flee.

533
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,401
Get out. Bingo, bingo.
Move, move, move.

534
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:25,801
- Get out. Get out.
- ( flatulence sputters )

535
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:26,998
( sniffing )

536
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,269
Zeus: Hmm. I know
that smell from somewhere.

537
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:30,468
Stewey:
Ted!

538
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:33,478
- Ted! Dog!
- Come on.

539
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:35,480
Ted! Ted! I seen him!

540
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:39,040
Stewey:
I seen him! Ted, I seen him!

541
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:40,415
- Ted: Who?
- Stewey: Zeus, Ted.

542
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:44,716
I came face to face
with Zeus, Ted.

543
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:46,155
Zeus? Zeus Bannister?

544
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:48,182
No, Zeus from
"Clash of the Titans."

545
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:49,888
Yes, Zeus Bannister.
How many other Zeuses do you know?

546
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:52,158
- Now, that's bananas.
- Ted, I seen him with my own two eyes.

547
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:54,062
I could smell his breath
through the glass, Ted.

548
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,761
Stewey, look. We don't have time
for your delusions or pranks.

549
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:57,996
You know I don't like dogs.

550
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:00,766
You told me, "Stewey, you never
have to work with a dog again."

551
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:02,671
- Da-da-da da-da-da.
- Pull yourself together.

552
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,266
Just shut up.

553
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:05,833
- Ted--
- Did you plant the device?

554
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:08,438
Does a bear sleep
in the woods?

555
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,914
What do I know
from bears, okay?

556
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:14,112
- Did you plant the friggin' device?
- Yes, I planted it.

557
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:16,450
Okay.
Okay, good.

558
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:18,786
All right.
So, then...

559
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:21,384
let's just relax.

560
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:25,726
It was just a yellow lab.
They all look alike.

561
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:28,028
Okay, Zeus
and the Bannisters

562
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,261
are probably
a million miles away.

563
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:31,963
Maybe you're right, Ted.

564
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:33,972
You always know
how to make me feel better.

565
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:35,667
George's voice on radio:
Have you seen my toothbrush?

566
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,072
Belinda's voice on radio:
I put it on the nightstand this morning.

567
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,600
Here we go. It's working.

568
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:42,614
Belinda: If I had a dollar for every
time you lost your toothbrush...

569
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:44,275
George:
I didn't lose it. Someone moved it.

570
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:46,147
Belinda:
You're right. The toothbrush fairy

571
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:49,244
came all the way from Connecticut just
to steal George Bannister's toothbrush.

572
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:50,778
I told you, Ted.
I told you, Ted.

573
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,847
I don't believe it.

574
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:58,755
( phone ringing )

575
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:03,263
Sarah, hi.

576
00:27:03,302 --> 00:27:06,066
I know, I've been waiting
for your call.

577
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:07,935
Look, no, no.
She doesn't know anything yet.

578
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:09,497
Okay.

579
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:12,567
You are so beautiful.

580
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:14,875
Okay.
Listen, I-I-I don't think--

581
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:17,177
no, I know.
I know, I gotta tell her soon.

582
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:19,115
Okay, look.
I don't want to get caught.

583
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:21,984
Um... don't call me, all right?
Just text me.

584
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,783
Gotta go. Bye.

585
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:30,591
George, who are you talking to?
What are you doing in there?

586
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:32,597
They wanted me
to switch cellular service.

587
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:35,828
George: Gosh, I'm still so jet-lagged.
I feel like it's time for bed already.

588
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:38,836
Oh, my goodness, George.
What are you wearing?

589
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,498
Like it?
Borrowed it from Babs.

590
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,098
Listen, Belinda,
I was thinking,

591
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:46,269
since the kids
are on the other side of the house,

592
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:48,506
miles and miles away--

593
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,515
I know.
We can finally get some sleep.

594
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,349
Well, sleep if you're dull.

595
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:56,320
Or how about a massage?

596
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:59,586
Oh, that's sweet, honey.
Thanks.

597
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,387
But I think I'm just gonna read.

598
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,053
I-I meant for me.

599
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:05,790
Come on.
One of your deep-tissue massages.

600
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:08,891
- Babs has got me tight and worked up.
- I-- are you serious, George?

601
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:10,595
- Dead serious.
- I don't-- no, no. I-- no, no, no.

602
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,125
You know, you're doing
a lot of complaining

603
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,694
for someone that's trying
to give me a massage.

604
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:16,765
- ( groans )
- Ah, yeah.

605
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:18,901
- I'll drink plenty of water after this.
- Okay.

606
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:21,913
- Belinda: George, come on. I can't--
- ( George moaning )

607
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:26,406
- George: It's a little hard there.
- Belinda: Sorry.

608
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:28,442
George: You know what
I was thinking about the other day?

609
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:31,183
How romantic I was
when I asked you to marry me.

610
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:33,316
Remember, Rockefeller Center,
under the Christmas tree?

611
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:35,690
Belinda: How could I forget that
at a moment like this, George?

612
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:37,627
Bannister doesn't know
how to treat a woman.

613
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:39,186
Oh, and you do, Stewey?

614
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,062
I know how to make 'em cry.

615
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:43,033
- ( flatulence sputters, laughs )
- Oh!

616
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:46,765
Stewey! You're making me cry.
My eyes are watering.

617
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:50,202
- Oh, jeez.
- George, this--

618
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:51,539
Hold on, baby.
I can't reach my wine.

619
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:53,066
- This is--
- Okay.

620
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:55,170
George, this is really
the last thing I wanna--

621
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:56,339
- All right, Belinda.
- Come on.

622
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:57,746
A little less of this,
a little bit more of this.

623
00:28:57,783 --> 00:29:00,081
- ( sighs )
- Ah--! Ow!

624
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:02,643
Come on.
You gotta do it that hard?

625
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:04,848
- Oh, will you just--
- Gosh, okay.

626
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,915
- That's so rough. You're shaking me.
- George, I--

627
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,152
- Whoa. Jeez.
- ( gasps )

628
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:09,751
- Belinda!
- George!

629
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:12,093
Eve:
Uh-oh. That'll leave a mark.

630
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,530
- What -- it's all over the sheets.
- Well, you pushed me.

631
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:16,090
It's not a relaxing massage
when you're pushing me--

632
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:18,466
- Come on, get some towels.
- It wasn't very relaxing.

633
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:19,993
They're under the sink.
Under the sink.

634
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:22,199
What are you do--
under the sink, not in the bathtub.

635
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,969
- Over here.
- Zeus: Hang on, Georgie.

636
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:25,442
I got this.

637
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:31,211
And that's how it's done.

638
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,376
Hey, Georgie, Belinda.
You can come out now.

639
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:35,750
- Took care of it.
- Oh, look. It's all better now.

640
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:38,552
I'd really like to be
sleeping, George.

641
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,616
Is what I'd like-- oh.
What are you--

642
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,756
- What's going on?
- We've had an accident here, honey.

643
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:50,496
Your father just decided to spill
his w-- grape juice all over the bed.

644
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:52,594
Well, I wouldn't have, honey,
if you weren't so rough.

645
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:55,333
- TMI, Dad. TMI.
- Right?

646
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:59,207
Aw, not only is she cute,
but she's smart, too.

647
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:01,610
Kara: Look how she blotted up
the juice with her tiny little paws.

648
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:02,670
Zeus:
Uh-- heh heh.

649
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,511
Ben: You'd think Zeus
would be the one to do it.

650
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:07,814
Zeus:
Uh, I did do it. She copied me.

651
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:10,014
- Kara: Good girl, Eve.
- Zeus: Times like this,

652
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:12,785
I wish I had a voice box.

653
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,694
( barking )

654
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:29,502
- ( chirping )
- ( barks )

655
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:38,077
Run!

656
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,680
- Eve: Got it.
- Zeus: Hey.

657
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,454
That was my catch.

658
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,960
Boy, I tell you.
That puppy's got game.

659
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,992
Belinda: Wow. Where'd she
learn how to do that?

660
00:30:58,036 --> 00:31:00,596
She's a Bannister, honey.

661
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,107
All Bannisters
are athletically inclined.

662
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:05,701
Some of us are, honey.

663
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:07,234
I could do the same thing
to you, you know.

664
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,848
But I won't. I wouldn't.
That'd be wrong.

665
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:15,512
Zeus:
Beginner's luck. Trust me.

666
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:17,715
Eve: And there's more
where that came from.

667
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:21,453
That's right. You can't touch
the athletic prowess of a former K-9.

668
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:24,189
Not to mention
an original Bannister.

669
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:27,865
- I'm gonna get a little fun in.
- Belinda: Okay.

670
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,867
- Man the fort, honey.
- All right.

671
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:31,766
All right.
Careful, hon-- careful.

672
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,703
- Careful, careful.
- Honey, I'm fine.

673
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:36,798
- Athleticism.
- George--

674
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,866
George: Come here, Eve.
You little rascal.

675
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,777
How about a game of fetch?
Just us this time.

676
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:43,246
Zeus:
Hey, I wanna play, too.

677
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:47,874
I'll be right here,
in case anyone cares.

678
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:52,988
Babs:
Aw, it looks so nice.

679
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:55,083
- Belinda: You're doing a real good job.
- Babs: Yeah, I'm a little shocked.

680
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:58,357
Someone should call
Christmas Magazine for a photo shoot.

681
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:01,160
This tree looks like it's right out
of the North Pole.

682
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,689
That'd be great, but there's
some lights missing

683
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:04,133
and the candy canes
are all crooked.

684
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:07,696
Okay, well, that's a lot of complaining
from someone who hasn't hung one ball.

685
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:10,469
Honey, I'm a director, okay?
That's what I do.

686
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:12,840
I have a vision,
and then I tell you what to do.

687
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,902
- Mm-hmm. Cecil B. Bannister over here.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

688
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:17,437
Hey, let's put a wicked train set
underneath.

689
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:19,882
Well, that's a good idea, buddy.
But I don't think there's any room.

690
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:23,285
Ben: Well, there would be if we lose
the corny Nativity scene.

691
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:26,688
Okay, Ben, we are not getting rid
of the Nativity scene.

692
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:28,716
That is the true meaning
of Christmas.

693
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,125
That's right, Ben.
Your mother's right.

694
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:32,755
Usually she's not.
This time she is.

695
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:34,856
George: You don't want
to be a pawn to the sugarcoated,

696
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,457
commercialized version
of Christmas.

697
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:39,300
Fine, then I'll get rid
of your gift.

698
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:41,931
- Whoa. Let's not get crazy, buddy.
- George--

699
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,964
I'm just telling him, Belinda,
that you're right, okay?

700
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:46,671
And we want to know the real meaning
of why we celebrate Christmas.

701
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:49,077
- It's the birth of Jesus.
- That's right.

702
00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:51,776
Just tell me we don't
have to go to church

703
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:53,750
for the Midnight Service
this year.

704
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:56,652
Ben, we go to church
every Christmas Eve,

705
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:58,315
and this year
will be no different.

706
00:32:58,356 --> 00:32:59,516
That's correct.

707
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:02,117
Ben, if you want to be Jewish,
you can be Jewish.

708
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,924
- Belinda: Honey.
- What are we gonna top the tree with?

709
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:07,659
Ooh, something very special
and very valuable.

710
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:09,963
Belinda:
It's the famous Christmas star.

711
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:12,162
- Yeah!
- Babs: George, can you help me out?

712
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,137
- Oh, sure.
- You're about an inch or two taller

713
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:17,801
- than all the kids and dogs.
- Kara: Wow, it's beautiful.

714
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:19,503
Look at it sparkle, Daddy.

715
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:21,842
Yeah, just like your daddy.

716
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,314
Belinda: Okay, kids, make a little room.
Dad's gonna get the ladder.

717
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:25,475
Here we go.

718
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:26,984
Zeus:
Sorry I'm late.

719
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:29,612
That crocodile heel did a number
on my insides.

720
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:31,986
It was pretty good
going down, but...

721
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:33,923
( barks )

722
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:37,588
Zeus:
Hey, that sweater looks familiar.

723
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:40,359
- Okay, how's that?
- All right, everybody back away.

724
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:42,958
- ( groans )
- Honey, be careful up there.

725
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,866
- Honey, I know what I'm doing.
- Oh, jeez. Okay.

726
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:46,803
Please. I don't need everybody
commentating.

727
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,068
Ooh, you did that on purpose.

728
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:52,201
Ben:
Dad, don't wreck our tree.

729
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:55,838
- Son-- there we are.
- Babs: There you go. That's perfect.

730
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,212
Zeus:
Yo, pipsqueak. That's my sweater.

731
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:01,343
George, that's
my Christmas sweater.

732
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:03,445
You gave it to me as a gift,
and I quote,

733
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:06,184
"For my best friend
in the entire world."

734
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:08,351
- ( barks )
- Hey, buddy.

735
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:10,520
Eve: What's the big deal?
You weren't even using it.

736
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,793
Hey, Zeus. You know the rules.
Off the couch.

737
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:18,332
Oh, look at little Evie
with her cute little Christmas sweater.

738
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,235
She looks like a furry angel.

739
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,330
- Oh, she does. She's so cute.
- She's a furry angel.

740
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:24,137
- You are fuzzy.
- Babs: She's so cute.

741
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:26,166
Zeus:
Furry little nightmare.

742
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:29,647
Eve: Sharing is caring.
Especially around the holidays.

743
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:31,512
Now where have I
heard that before?

744
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:33,813
Zeus:
This, of course, means war.

745
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:20,496
Grandma: It's a cookie.
It's a big--

746
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:21,760
( kids yelling )

747
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,965
Oh, it's a-- it's--

748
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:31,271
peering in the wind-- what?
It's-- open-- it's Santa--

749
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:34,437
Santa is-- he's got something wrong
with his ears.

750
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,845
Oh, it's an elf--

751
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:39,213
it's an elf with lockjaw?
I don't know, I don't know.

752
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,083
( kids' voices overlapping )

753
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:46,953
Reindeer! Snowman!

754
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:50,961
Reindeer!

755
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:55,323
Oh, he's telling the elf
to be quiet

756
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:57,459
because they have
lots of work to do.

757
00:35:57,502 --> 00:35:58,969
It's silent, he's sleeping,
and it's at night.

758
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:00,061
- Reindeer!
- ( phone ringing )

759
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,800
Silent! Oh, I got it!
Silent night!

760
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,866
Yes!

761
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:06,376
- Yay!
- Grandma, Grandma!

762
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:08,038
- What, what?
- The phone, the phone.

763
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,740
Oh!
Oh, okay.

764
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:13,046
Honey, it's about time
you called.

765
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:14,813
I left a dozen messages.

766
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:17,617
Oh, quiet down, everybody.
My daughter's on the phone.

767
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:18,849
Grandma on phone:
I was starting to get paranoid,

768
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,381
thinking that
you were boycotting me.

769
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:23,451
How are you?

770
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:26,362
- Hi, Mom. How's the party?
- It's going great.

771
00:36:26,397 --> 00:36:30,026
Yeah, it is booming with a capital B.
How are you?

772
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:33,162
Oh, uh,
kicking with a capital K.

773
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:35,764
Grandma:
Oh, good. Good.

774
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,172
Guess who showed up?

775
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,733
Cousin Jamie and her husband Ralph.
With the kids.

776
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:43,474
- Oh!
- Yeah, they brought a low-carb, no-fat

777
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:46,484
little, tiny, small rum cake.

778
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:49,681
Oh, hi-- tell them all
I say Merry Christmas.

779
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:52,212
Yeah, well, whatever.
I don't talk to them that much anyway.

780
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:53,952
Grandma:
So what's going on?

781
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:56,051
Well, I--

782
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:58,324
I need your advice
about something.

783
00:36:58,363 --> 00:36:59,660
Okay, what?

784
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:02,530
Oh, I know what it is.
It's your belly.

785
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:04,535
Oh, honey.
You know that scratching?

786
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:07,129
If you put
some baby oil on that,

787
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:09,901
some ointment,
and just rub it in about 20 minutes,

788
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:11,238
it'll go away.

789
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:14,109
Yeah, no--
well, yes, it is itching.

790
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:16,477
But that's not what it is.

791
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,617
It's about George.

792
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:22,916
He's acting really strange.

793
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:25,684
I'm sure it's his underwear.
It's riding high on him.

794
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:28,920
You know what? I have heard that it
has caused brain damage in some people.

795
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,951
And I'm sure it has with him.

796
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:34,260
Mom, I'm really trying to tell you
something serious here.

797
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,325
- What?
- Well--

798
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:39,962
well, he's just been
acting strange.

799
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:42,336
And, I mean,
stranger than usual.

800
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,273
Well, can you be specific?

801
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:49,008
Well-- it may not sound like a lot,
and I don't wanna sound crazy,

802
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,777
but I noticed that he's...

803
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:55,149
started to take his phone
to the bathroom all the time.

804
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,154
- Okay.
- We're talking about a guy

805
00:37:57,188 --> 00:37:58,519
who can't even text.

806
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:00,649
I mean, he doesn't know how
to send a text message.

807
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:02,819
And then last night
he's on the phone

808
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,260
for a really-- like 20 minutes.

809
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:07,526
And then he comes out
and he's wearing

810
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:09,795
one of Babs' bathrobes

811
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:13,736
and then he's rambling on,
something about telemarketers and--

812
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:16,740
All right, I'm gonna tell you something.
A little secret, okay?

813
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:18,867
You have been married
an awful long time

814
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,003
because things are
starting to get strange

815
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,569
and they will get stranger.

816
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:25,310
So you just gotta
not worry about that.

817
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,842
Don't get the little stuff
all bobbled in your head, okay?

818
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:31,949
So what are you saying?

819
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,322
Well, I'm saying that...

820
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,123
I think it's time that you two
find some time

821
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:40,892
to sort of pick up
some romance again.

822
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:43,958
Okay? Find something
that you can

823
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,129
to bring
all those feelings back.

824
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,934
- Kara: Ben put gum in my hair!
- Ben: You're a real jerk!

825
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,938
Uh, Mom, I've got to go.

826
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:54,604
Oh, okay, honey.
So do I.

827
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:56,409
- Well, I love you!
- I love you, Mom.

828
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:58,608
- Merry Christmas!
- Bye, sweetie!

829
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,777
Bye.

830
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:02,843
( sighs )

831
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:18,294
Well, look what
the Grinch dragged in!

832
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:22,232
Babs:
Ned McFinnegan.

833
00:39:22,273 --> 00:39:24,935
You know, it's one thing
to have a little healthy competition

834
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:27,342
for the holidays, but spying?

835
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:30,040
Now, that is a horse
of a very different color.

836
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:31,275
What are you talking about?
What horse?

837
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:35,012
I found this strategically placed
outside my window.

838
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:36,418
What is it, satellite TV?

839
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:38,922
Are you trying
to spy on me, Ned?

840
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:42,289
Spying on my plan for my electric lights
during the holidays?

841
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:44,226
That's insane.

842
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:46,321
I thought
you switched to decaf.

843
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:48,332
I did.
But trust me, Ned,

844
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:50,266
at the end of
this Christmas season,

845
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:52,565
it's the North Pole
that's gonna be calling me

846
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:55,470
about how to spread
Christmas cheer. Got it?

847
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:59,308
( cracking )

848
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,910
( static crackles )

849
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:06,377
I got it.

850
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:10,711
( laughs )

851
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,720
( static crackles )

852
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:22,558
- ( flatulence sputters )
- This dog smells like Newark, Ted.

853
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,227
( barks )

854
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:28,571
- Well, that's the end of that.
- Now what?

855
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:30,233
Ted:
Plan B, Stewey.

856
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,534
I thought that was Plan B.

857
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:36,479
- Whatever. Plan C.
- Well, Plan B stunk anyway.

858
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:38,379
- Like Tony Rowe's mutt.
- ( barks )

859
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:39,644
( barking )

860
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:43,279
You're gonna paint her nails.
Stinky mutt.

861
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:45,619
Let's get out of here.

862
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:53,462
( snoring )

863
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:56,698
Zeus:
Like Belinda said,

864
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:58,827
every relationship has its peaks
and its valleys.

865
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,567
So I'll just remind George
why he loves me so much.

866
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:03,767
Any second now.

867
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:06,538
Slippers in place.
Newspaper ready.

868
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:08,101
Come on, George.

869
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:11,343
- ( snorts )
- Zeus: That train is never late.

870
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:17,782
- ( groans )
- Good morning.

871
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:21,019
Honey, no more
garlic knots for you.

872
00:41:22,593 --> 00:41:25,187
( groans )

873
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:26,526
Zeus:
Showtime.

874
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:28,930
- Where's my slippers?
- Zeus: What the heck?

875
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,297
They were here last night.

876
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:33,394
I am not the gatekeeper
of your things, George.

877
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:34,836
Eve:
I'll get them, George.

878
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:36,931
Excuse you.

879
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:38,066
Zeus:
They're gone.

880
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:39,474
Well, who is, Belinda?

881
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,637
Zeus: Maybe George
moved them closer to the bed.

882
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,805
( Eve barks )

883
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:47,142
- Ah!
- Zeus: Sneak thief.

884
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:48,709
George:
There she is.

885
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:52,450
( gasps )
Yes, someone loves Daddy.

886
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,821
Zeus:
You stole them last night.

887
00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:55,849
Totally robbed my idea.

888
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:58,794
Eve:
Stole is such an ugly word.

889
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,161
I just planned ahead.

890
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:03,599
Unbelievable
how smart you are.

891
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:06,296
Yes, you know
to get Daddy's slippers.

892
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:08,237
- Yes, you do.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

893
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:10,672
Well, you are pregnant, honey.

894
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:13,040
No, I think it's
your sister's cooking.

895
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:15,204
- Oh, yeah. That could be, too.
- ( groans )

896
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,707
I see you have no problem giving
your morning kisses to a dog.

897
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:23,151
Belinda, honey, if you want me
to lick your face,

898
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:25,417
all you gotta do is ask.

899
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:27,083
The thing is, George,

900
00:42:27,124 --> 00:42:29,752
a girl shouldn't have to ask.

901
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:31,785
( sighs )

902
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:36,032
Eve's a girl.
She didn't ask.

903
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:37,500
Did you, Eve?

904
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:40,060
Zeus:
The battle lines have been drawn.

905
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:09,965
There we go.

906
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:12,196
- We forgot a scarf.
- Yeah.

907
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,170
Oh, I don't think a snowman's
gonna wear a scarf, buddy,

908
00:43:14,205 --> 00:43:15,433
in southern California.

909
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:17,304
All snowmen
wear scarves, Daddy.

910
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:19,366
Everyone knows that.
I mean, come on.

911
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,776
Oh, you mean sandman,
not snowman.

912
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:23,780
Well, I'm just saying,
I don't think a snowman's

913
00:43:23,814 --> 00:43:25,577
gonna wear a scarf
on a hot, sunny day.

914
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:28,608
- Fine.
- Why don't we put a swimsuit on him?

915
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:30,484
- Why don't we not?
- George: Okay, guys.

916
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:33,046
Don't fight, all right?
Belinda, you wanna weigh in on this?

917
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,650
Snowmen wear scarves.

918
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:37,354
- Aha!
- I told you.

919
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:39,295
Okay, put the scarf on.

920
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,890
Eve: Still mad
about the slippers thing?

921
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:45,767
Come on, cranky.
Lighten up a bit.

922
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:48,271
- Zeus: I'm busy.
- Eve: Busy doing what?

923
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:50,433
Zeus:
Silently judging you.

924
00:43:50,474 --> 00:43:51,964
Eve:
Boring.

925
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:54,273
Where's my bucket?

926
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:55,745
I don't know.

927
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,771
Belinda, have you seen
my buck-- oh!

928
00:43:57,815 --> 00:44:00,716
- ( groans )
- Ben: Ow! Dad!

929
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,480
Well, that's what happens
when you lose your bucket.

930
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,851
Really?

931
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:06,721
Eve: Maybe this
will jolly you up a little.

932
00:44:08,993 --> 00:44:10,961
- What are you doing?
- Ahem, excuse me.

933
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:13,520
- You're blocking my sun.
- Sorry.

934
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:14,929
Hey, have you seen my bucket?

935
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,935
- Ahem--
- What's wrong with you?

936
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,438
Whatever do you mean, Romeo?

937
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:23,906
Well, it seems like you've
been giving me the stink eye.

938
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:26,842
- That's what I mean.
- Must be your imagination.

939
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:30,074
I don't think so.
Hey, have you seen the bucket?

940
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:32,344
( groans )
George.

941
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:35,985
Zeus: Allow me
to get that for you, George.

942
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,749
Eve:
Stick around for a while.

943
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:41,724
I'll get it, George.
Zeus is tied up at the moment.

944
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:46,527
Zeus:
Hmm. Now, how did it go again?

945
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:50,925
Here's my bucket.
Thank you, Eve. I love you.

946
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:52,697
How great is this dog?

947
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:54,671
Well, maybe you two
should get married, George.

948
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,138
I'll make her
go get the shovel.

949
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:57,868
Eve, go get the shovel.
Go ahead.

950
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:00,672
Zeus: Hah, I'm back.
You can't keep a good dog down.

951
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:03,145
Okay, playtime's over.

952
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,648
Eve:
No, Zeus. I wanna get the shovel.

953
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:07,742
Zeus:
Fool George once, shame on him.

954
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:10,379
Fool George twice,
shame on you.

955
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:15,090
Sly trickery is one thing,
but that won't work here

956
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:16,650
in broad daylight.

957
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:17,956
Eve:
Shakespeare?

958
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:20,429
Zeus:
Chappy the Wonder Dog.

959
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:22,489
Come on, Heinz.
Don't fail me now.

960
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:26,965
That shovel is mine.

961
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:30,733
Ah! Water in my eyes.

962
00:45:31,942 --> 00:45:34,433
- No, Zeusie, no!
- Zeus: I can't see!

963
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:36,571
- ( kids screaming )
- George, is that you?

964
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:39,742
- No!
- No!

965
00:45:39,784 --> 00:45:41,718
- No!
- No!

966
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:47,185
( groans )

967
00:45:47,224 --> 00:45:50,955
- Oh, George. Look at that.
- That took a long time to make.

968
00:45:50,995 --> 00:45:52,587
( gasps )

969
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:56,657
- You're a real jerk, Zeus.
- How could you, Zeusie?

970
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,930
- Bad dog, Zeus. Bad dog.
- Zeus: I--

971
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:00,800
Zeus: I'm sorry, okay?
It was an accident.

972
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:04,638
I was just-- George,
you have to tell them I didn't mean it.

973
00:46:04,675 --> 00:46:06,438
What are we gonna do
with that dog?

974
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:09,208
Eve: Tough break,
big brother.

975
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:11,015
Zeus:
But...

976
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:13,245
Belinda:
Oh, Babs.

977
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:15,184
It's George.

978
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:17,449
He's acting really funny.

979
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:19,718
Define "funny."

980
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:22,317
He's getting these
secretive phone calls

981
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:24,350
and sending text messages.

982
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:26,329
I mean, George doesn't know
how to send a text message.

983
00:46:26,363 --> 00:46:28,797
He doesn't even--
he's never sent a text message.

984
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:32,269
And then-- and then
he gets a phone call

985
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:35,602
from someone named...

986
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:37,300
Sarah.

987
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:39,366
- Sarah?
- Sarah.

988
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,640
- Who's Sarah?
- I don't know.

989
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:42,907
- Oh.
- I know.

990
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:44,471
Oh.

991
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:46,574
Well-- oh, honey.

992
00:46:46,617 --> 00:46:49,381
Oh, Babs. I mean,
can you blame him?

993
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,320
- Look at me.
- You look per--

994
00:46:51,355 --> 00:46:53,118
I look like a bloated
Oompa Loompa.

995
00:46:53,157 --> 00:46:56,354
No, you-- you look like
a regular Oompa Loompa.

996
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:59,453
I do. They're bloated by nature.
That's what they look like.

997
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:03,228
They're lovely, you're lovely.
You radiate beauty

998
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:06,794
and-- and being bornness.

999
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:08,998
You know what else?
You know what?

1000
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:10,472
What?

1001
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:13,671
I think he really did forget
our anniversary.

1002
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:17,477
No, no, wait. This is the idiot,
dolt, stupid person.

1003
00:47:17,515 --> 00:47:21,884
But this is also the person
that adores his wife.

1004
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:23,944
Adores his wife.

1005
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:26,889
And, you know, this emotional thing
that you're feeling right now,

1006
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:28,949
it's very consistent
with pregnant women.

1007
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:32,156
They have an emotional response
to a sort of benign environment.

1008
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:33,629
Benign data.

1009
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:36,030
You know, my best friend Jenny,
when she was pregnant,

1010
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:39,524
she was so paranoid, she thought her
husband was a bag man for the CIA.

1011
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,504
- Oh-- that's crazy.
- Yeah.

1012
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:42,972
- That is crazy, see?
- That's crazy.

1013
00:47:43,007 --> 00:47:45,032
And that's where you can go.

1014
00:47:45,075 --> 00:47:48,476
Zeus: Good going, Zeus.
You're a real Christmas prince.

1015
00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:50,810
Managed to irritate everybody
for the holidays.

1016
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:52,839
Keep up the good work.

1017
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:03,955
( snoring, groaning )

1018
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,873
Ted?

1019
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:19,671
Psst, Ted.
I'm here.

1020
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,302
Ted:
Do not linger there.

1021
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:22,937
She's just around the corner.
Get inside.

1022
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:27,410
I shouldn't have had
that calzone, Ted.

1023
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:29,248
( flatulence sputters )

1024
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:32,317
Ted, this is crazy.

1025
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:35,189
We've never done a job
with the people in the house before.

1026
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:38,753
Ted: Yeah, well, the stakes have
never been this high before, Stewey.

1027
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:41,356
- ( door creaking )
- Drastic measures call for...

1028
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:44,060
drastic measures.

1029
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:47,195
So from our surveillance,
we know a couple of things, right?

1030
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:50,230
Ted: Number one,
that star is definitely

1031
00:48:50,274 --> 00:48:52,469
somewhere
inside that house.

1032
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:55,535
Number two, we know that Babs
is up on the roof

1033
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:57,740
fiddling with
those stupid Christmas lights.

1034
00:48:57,781 --> 00:49:01,774
Number three, we know that if we do not
snag that star by Christmas,

1035
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:03,878
we lose our thumbs.

1036
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:05,912
So add those three things together,
what do you got?

1037
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:08,447
- Stewey: A headache.
- Ted: No! You idiot!

1038
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:11,552
You got irrefutable proof
that we definitely

1039
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:14,587
have to infiltrate that house
while people are home.

1040
00:49:14,632 --> 00:49:16,031
We got no other option.

1041
00:49:20,571 --> 00:49:22,801
Ted.
Ted, I can't see nothing.

1042
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,432
Ted:
Listen to me, Stewey.

1043
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:28,138
Time to put on
the game face, okay?

1044
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:30,646
Our number one objective
is that star.

1045
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:34,242
So do not get sidetracked
by any funny business.

1046
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:36,947
This is business-business.

1047
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:39,751
Ted, I'm so hungry,
I could eat a waitress.

1048
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,020
Don't even
think about it, Stewey.

1049
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:44,118
Ted, this house is a score.

1050
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:45,594
Why we just robbing
the star for?

1051
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:47,221
Ted:
First things first, Stewey.

1052
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:49,459
The star is most likely
on top of the Christmas tree,

1053
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,936
so now we gotta find
that Christmas tree.

1054
00:49:54,738 --> 00:49:56,433
Oh, a light just went on.

1055
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:59,965
- ( toilet flushes )
- Ted: Hide, hide quick. Hide.

1056
00:50:30,474 --> 00:50:32,339
( flatulence sputters )

1057
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:34,841
- Did you just--
- Stewey: That wasn't me.

1058
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:36,368
- It was Bannister.
- Yeah, right.

1059
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:42,852
California tremors.

1060
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:44,353
I've heard about these things.

1061
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:46,549
I think we're having
an earthquake.

1062
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,820
Ted:
Hold your position.

1063
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:53,462
Quick, into the next room.
Go, go, go, go, go.

1064
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:56,365
( groans )

1065
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,027
There must be a hundred rooms
in this place.

1066
00:50:58,068 --> 00:51:00,002
Do like we said before.

1067
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:03,495
Start on one side of the house
and move to the other.

1068
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,531
Stewey:
You gotta see this place, Ted.

1069
00:51:05,576 --> 00:51:07,908
But I can't find the tree.

1070
00:51:10,748 --> 00:51:13,615
Ted:
It's right behind you, dumbo.

1071
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:17,776
I found it.

1072
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,387
I'm gonna get it.
Hold on.

1073
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,322
I can't reach it.

1074
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,732
( thumping )

1075
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:37,800
I got it.

1076
00:51:46,116 --> 00:51:48,641
Oh, no, no.
Don't shake-- don't--

1077
00:51:48,685 --> 00:51:50,619
( shatters )

1078
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:52,485
Ted:
Get out of there, now.

1079
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:53,785
Get out.
Abort, abort. Go.

1080
00:51:53,824 --> 00:51:55,314
Eve:
Zeus, go get 'em.

1081
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:02,627
- Ah!
- ( barking )

1082
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:03,928
Zeus:
You!

1083
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,458
- Ah!
- ( barking continues )

1084
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:08,368
Go, Stewey!

1085
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:10,202
( flatulence sputters )

1086
00:52:16,814 --> 00:52:18,372
( sniffs )

1087
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,406
( snoring )

1088
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:29,123
George: Has anyone seen
my toothbrush?

1089
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:33,661
( yawns )
Good morning.

1090
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:46,341
Oh, no.

1091
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:47,934
George.

1092
00:52:47,978 --> 00:52:50,378
- Oh, what happened here?
- I don't know what's gotten into Zeus.

1093
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:52,348
Honey, we've got to get this cleaned up
before Barbara sees it.

1094
00:52:52,382 --> 00:52:54,373
I know.
Zeus, get in here.

1095
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:56,945
Zeus:
I didn't do it, George.

1096
00:52:56,987 --> 00:53:00,388
We were under attack by
that cat burglar clown, Stewey.

1097
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:02,949
Call the police.
Call the Malibu National Guard.

1098
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:04,051
- ( gasps )
- Zeus: Call my mother.

1099
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:06,255
Call your mother.
Call somebody.

1100
00:53:06,296 --> 00:53:07,786
Looks like a broken ornament.

1101
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:11,733
Zeus, this-- this is
totally unacceptable behavior, okay?

1102
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:13,531
I don't care what you're doing,

1103
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,800
you are now grounded
to the yard until we get home,

1104
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,932
- and there's no treats for you.
- But, Dad--

1105
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:19,465
Honey, I'm sorry.
That's the way it's gonna go.

1106
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,000
Zeus: George, would you
just listen to me?

1107
00:53:21,044 --> 00:53:25,071
Also, there's gonna be
no Christmas activities, okay?

1108
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:27,948
Zeus: But Christmas
only comes once a year.

1109
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:30,579
I didn't even do anything, George.
I'm innocent.

1110
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:32,589
I'll tell ya, I'm innocent.

1111
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:34,318
Eve:
The hubris of the guilty.

1112
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:35,825
Honey, sit.

1113
00:53:36,827 --> 00:53:38,692
Maybe you're being
a little harsh on him.

1114
00:53:38,729 --> 00:53:41,254
I'm not, Belinda. He can't just run
around doing whatever he wants

1115
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:44,426
in my sister's house.
I mean, look. Look at this one.

1116
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:48,268
She's 11 pounds of sweetness
and has a lot more common sense.

1117
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:49,897
Eve:
I couldn't agree with you more.

1118
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,738
Mommy, Daddy. Look what I found
under Zeus' doggie bed.

1119
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:55,745
Zeus:
What? You set me up?

1120
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:57,246
Isn't that Dad's toothbrush?

1121
00:53:57,281 --> 00:54:00,182
The new one? Belinda,
that's my favorite toothbrush now.

1122
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:01,684
- Belinda: I know.
- I saw the commercial and I got it.

1123
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:03,549
I know it's your favorite.
It's your favorite, I know.

1124
00:54:03,587 --> 00:54:05,350
- It goes in and out.
- We'll get you a new one.

1125
00:54:05,389 --> 00:54:08,415
The Oral 5000. That's why
this Christmas was gonna be special.

1126
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:09,618
Zeus:
But I didn't do it.

1127
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,719
Eve:
Boy, Zeus. So far,

1128
00:54:11,762 --> 00:54:15,198
you've broken, like,
every rule in the book.

1129
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:16,494
Zeus:
I can't believe it.

1130
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:17,898
Eve:
You told me to hide it.

1131
00:54:17,935 --> 00:54:20,563
Zeus: That's all I can stand
and I can't stand no more.

1132
00:54:20,604 --> 00:54:21,764
( barking )

1133
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:24,069
- Leave her alone, Zeus.
- Yeah, she's just a puppy.

1134
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:26,302
Take Eve, all right?
I'm gonna take Zeus, okay?

1135
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:27,935
Come on, Zeus.
Come on.

1136
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:33,810
Okay, kids.
Brush your teeth.

1137
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,374
Not-- not with that one.

1138
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:45,355
I hate to do this, Zeus,
but you got to learn to behave.

1139
00:54:56,106 --> 00:54:58,165
( George sighs )
You disappoint me, buddy.

1140
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,073
You know, we're guests
in someone's house

1141
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:03,307
and you're running around
like a cat, not a dog.

1142
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:04,905
Zeus:
Let me out, George. Please?

1143
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:08,145
I didn't do anything wrong.
Please, George?

1144
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:11,279
I don't know.
You just disappoint me.

1145
00:55:17,094 --> 00:55:18,527
Zeus:
George.

1146
00:55:18,562 --> 00:55:20,154
George, come on.
Don't leave me out here.

1147
00:55:20,197 --> 00:55:23,325
I'll be better.
I promise.

1148
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:27,293
( barks )

1149
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:40,712
- ( flatulence sputters )
- Zeus: That sounded like thunder.

1150
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:42,981
( goat thinking )
That's the ugliest goat I've ever seen.

1151
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,453
Yeah? Really? I'm a dog.

1152
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:47,082
Well, what are you doing
out here with us, then?

1153
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:49,558
Oh, well, I guess you guys
just heard all that, did you?

1154
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:51,026
Yeah, that's--
that's embarrassing.

1155
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:52,653
Goat:
You'll get used to it.

1156
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:54,994
Pretty soon they'll stop
coming to visit, too.

1157
00:55:55,032 --> 00:55:57,432
Zeus: What do you mean?
George loves me.

1158
00:55:57,467 --> 00:55:59,298
English goat:
Don't listen to him.

1159
00:55:59,336 --> 00:56:01,600
He gets crabby
when his stomach's upset.

1160
00:56:01,638 --> 00:56:04,607
I told you not to eat
that fine beluga caviar

1161
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:08,372
without a sweet pinot grigio
to cut the acid.

1162
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,880
Gruff goat:
Sure, they love you.

1163
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:13,815
That's why you're out here
and they're all in there.

1164
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,909
Merry Christmas, kid.

1165
00:56:15,952 --> 00:56:18,045
Zeus:
Let me out, George. Please.

1166
00:56:18,088 --> 00:56:22,218
I didn't do anything wrong.
Come on, George.

1167
00:56:34,905 --> 00:56:37,100
( Zeus sniffing )
Do I smell gingerbread?

1168
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:40,402
Come on--

1169
00:56:40,444 --> 00:56:43,140
English goat:
Well, that's a new one.

1170
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:47,974
Zeus: They can't really
be having Christmas without me.

1171
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:52,183
I gotta see this to believe it.

1172
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:57,420
They're really having Christmas
without me.

1173
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:00,123
♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh ♪

1174
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:02,893
♪ Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:15,940
Zeus:
I-- I can't believe it.

1177
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:29,424
I've been replaced.

1178
00:57:31,595 --> 00:57:33,495
I'm so sorry, George.

1179
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:37,899
Guess I'll just go back to my cage
before I ruin Christmas any more.

1180
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:43,226
( horse thinking )
This is the worst Christmas ever.

1181
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:50,973
( snoring )

1182
00:59:07,824 --> 00:59:11,055
Here we go. Now take it easy.
It's lots of steps.

1183
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:13,221
- Babs: This is so exciting.
- ( laughing )

1184
00:59:15,165 --> 00:59:16,996
It is very exciting, isn't it?

1185
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:18,762
Georgie, stand right over here
with the puppy.

1186
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:20,429
Come on, kids.
Come on.

1187
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,199
Oh, this is what we've
all been waiting for.

1188
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,072
Kids and moms and dads
and doggies and me.

1189
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:28,942
We're gonna be the Christmasiest house
this side of the universe.

1190
00:59:28,979 --> 00:59:31,243
Including Ned McFinnegan.

1191
00:59:31,281 --> 00:59:32,771
Okay, ready?

1192
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:33,942
- ( beeping )
- George: Eve's ready.

1193
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:35,178
- Here we go. Drumroll.
- Okay.

1194
00:59:35,218 --> 00:59:37,083
And...

1195
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:41,949
And... go!

1196
00:59:43,193 --> 00:59:44,854
Oh, no.

1197
00:59:44,895 --> 00:59:46,863
- Oh.
- Was that supposed to happen?

1198
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:48,330
I don't think so.

1199
00:59:48,365 --> 00:59:49,832
You hooked it up
to a generator, right?

1200
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:52,130
A separate generator.
Wait, let me try it again.

1201
00:59:52,168 --> 00:59:53,931
Belinda:
Well, that sounds complicated.

1202
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,562
Here we go.
Ready? Ready?

1203
00:59:55,605 --> 00:59:57,698
It's gonna work this time.
And...

1204
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:02,705
( groans )
Oh... Oh, no.

1205
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:04,213
- George: Let's go to Mass.
- Belinda: Let's go. Let's go.

1206
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:06,545
I knew that 40-amp
would never hold.

1207
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:07,948
- Let's go to church.
- Let's go to church.

1208
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:10,145
We'll go to church
and we'll pray.

1209
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:12,620
Belinda: And we'll work it out
when we get back.

1210
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:15,056
- I've got to go to the store.
- No, no.

1211
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:16,752
We're going to church
and you're coming with us.

1212
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:18,454
- But--
- No buts, Babs.

1213
01:00:18,495 --> 01:00:19,985
It's a Christmas Eve tradition.

1214
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,966
Fine, I'm going. But can we stop
at the market on the way back?

1215
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,400
George: That's fine.
I need a new toothbrush, anyway.

1216
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:28,427
Come on, honey.
Kara, in the car.

1217
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:35,868
- Bingo! Hey, they're leaving.
- ( snoring )

1218
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:38,278
- This is our chance right here.
- What about the mutt?

1219
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:40,078
That's what I got this for.

1220
01:00:40,116 --> 01:00:43,210
- A calculator?
- No, it's a Doggy Dazer.

1221
01:00:43,253 --> 01:00:44,686
What are you gonna do,
shock him?

1222
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:47,417
No, that's a Taser.
This is a Dazer.

1223
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:49,220
It emits
a high-pitched frequency.

1224
01:00:49,259 --> 01:00:50,817
Drives dogs nutty.

1225
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,725
Hey, why don't we try it
on Tony Rowe's mutt?

1226
01:00:52,762 --> 01:00:54,024
( dog barks )

1227
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:57,057
Come on, they're gonna be back soon.
We gotta go.

1228
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,761
- Let's go.
- I'll deal with you later, mutt.

1229
01:00:58,802 --> 01:00:59,962
- ( growls )
- ( dog barks )

1230
01:01:10,814 --> 01:01:12,907
Kara: Dad, Ben put gum
in my hair again.

1231
01:01:12,949 --> 01:01:15,008
Ben:
It was an accident.

1232
01:01:17,053 --> 01:01:18,645
( Zeus whines )

1233
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:20,815
Zeus:
I'm just not needed anymore.

1234
01:01:20,857 --> 01:01:23,587
Maybe I should just go.

1235
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:26,754
At least that way,
I won't get in anybody's way.

1236
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:30,766
English goat: Hey, kid.
If you see my brother Anthony,

1237
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,165
tell him I'm doing great.

1238
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:41,202
Zeus: Hey, Eve.
Come down here a minute.

1239
01:01:41,244 --> 01:01:42,677
We need to talk.
( barking )

1240
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:49,347
- ( Zeus barks )
- ( Eve barks )

1241
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:57,354
Zeus: Look, there's no room
for two dogs in this family anymore.

1242
01:01:57,394 --> 01:02:00,852
You're the dog of the house now.

1243
01:02:00,897 --> 01:02:02,023
Eve:
But I'm just a--

1244
01:02:02,065 --> 01:02:04,465
Zeus: Remember,
George likes to play fetch

1245
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:06,992
with a tennis ball,
not a baseball, okay?

1246
01:02:07,037 --> 01:02:09,267
And Belinda, she loves it
when you sit and chill

1247
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:11,239
by her feet when she reads.

1248
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:14,710
Oh, and Ben and Kara? They love
to play freeze tag in the summer

1249
01:02:14,744 --> 01:02:16,769
and hide-and-seek
in the winter.

1250
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:19,839
Oh, and don't forget
to let Kara win.

1251
01:02:21,017 --> 01:02:23,383
Eve: You're such
a drama queen, Zeus.

1252
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,751
( barking )

1253
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:26,312
Eve:
Zeus, wait a second.

1254
01:02:26,356 --> 01:02:27,823
- Zeus: I smell...
- ( flatulence sputters )

1255
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:29,688
- Ted: Jeez, Stewey!
- Zeus: ...trouble!

1256
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:37,059
Great, just what I need.

1257
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,898
A crisis of conscience,
at my lowest point, no less.

1258
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:43,394
Now, do I, A-- run away and leave a poor
helpless puppy to the wolves,

1259
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,932
not to mention Aunt Barbara's
multi-million dollar home, vulnerable?

1260
01:02:46,976 --> 01:02:48,705
Or, B--

1261
01:02:48,745 --> 01:02:52,476
do I go back and show
these crooks and everyone

1262
01:02:52,515 --> 01:02:54,745
why I was the number one K-9
in my division

1263
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:57,344
three years in a row?

1264
01:02:57,387 --> 01:03:00,083
Eve: Wait, you're not
going to leave me here.

1265
01:03:00,123 --> 01:03:01,988
Are you?

1266
01:03:03,693 --> 01:03:07,026
Zeus: Being the dog of the house
carries a big responsibility.

1267
01:03:07,063 --> 01:03:09,964
And it's not mine
to carry anymore.

1268
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:12,968
Eve: He'll come back.
I think.

1269
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:15,334
( church bell ringing )

1270
01:03:20,276 --> 01:03:22,335
Babs: Come on, kids.
Let's find some seats.

1271
01:03:22,378 --> 01:03:24,312
Belinda: Okay,
we'll see you inside.

1272
01:03:24,347 --> 01:03:25,439
( car door closes )

1273
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:28,684
- George?
- Yeah?

1274
01:03:28,718 --> 01:03:31,186
- Who are you texting?
- Texting?

1275
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:33,121
( laughs )
I don't text.

1276
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:35,716
You know that.
I'm not up with technology.

1277
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:38,022
Although I would like to go into
that social networking thing.

1278
01:03:38,061 --> 01:03:40,791
Who is Sarah?

1279
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:44,993
Sarah?

1280
01:03:45,034 --> 01:03:46,695
( stammering )

1281
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:48,499
Oh, come on.
Just come clean, George.

1282
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:50,733
- What do you mean?
- The texting,

1283
01:03:50,773 --> 01:03:52,035
and the secret phone calls...

1284
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:54,009
Belinda, there's no
secret phone calls, texting.

1285
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:55,840
I don't know anything about--

1286
01:03:56,846 --> 01:03:58,814
( sighs )
Okay, here it is.

1287
01:03:58,848 --> 01:04:01,009
Sarah is a friend.

1288
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,683
- Oh, a friend.
- Yeah.

1289
01:04:05,722 --> 01:04:08,623
Well, George, that is
very hard to believe

1290
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:11,456
when all of us know
that you don't have any friends.

1291
01:04:11,494 --> 01:04:14,930
Well, I will when I get on
the social networking thing.

1292
01:04:14,964 --> 01:04:16,522
( sighs )

1293
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:19,034
Trust me, Belinda.
It's not what you think, okay?

1294
01:04:19,068 --> 01:04:21,127
- Trust me.
- Okay, you want me to trust you?

1295
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:23,230
- Then let me see your phone.
- I don't ask you for your phone.

1296
01:04:23,273 --> 01:04:24,763
- Why won't you give me your phone?
- No, this is my business.

1297
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:26,069
l don't check your phone.

1298
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:27,667
George, you are obviously
hiding something from me.

1299
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:30,543
This is not the time to be hiding
things from me, George.

1300
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,673
Have you once thought about
how I might feel right now?

1301
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:35,377
- Yes.
- I am very full all the time.

1302
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:37,613
My feet are swollen,
I am very emotional,

1303
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:38,951
- I have a lot going on.
- I understand.

1304
01:04:38,988 --> 01:04:40,683
Have you thought about
what I do all day long, George?

1305
01:04:40,723 --> 01:04:42,213
- I do. I thought--
- I don't think that you have.

1306
01:04:42,258 --> 01:04:46,217
And, you know, I'm tired and there is
a child that's gonna be arriving soon,

1307
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:50,164
and I think we should be
on the same page, George.

1308
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:56,002
- Do you think Facebook is the best?
- ( groans )

1309
01:04:57,273 --> 01:04:58,740
( faintly )
It's right here.

1310
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,278
Hey.

1311
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:10,809
What kind of lock is this?
Never seen a lock like this before.

1312
01:05:10,853 --> 01:05:12,946
- It's a Messerschmitt.
- A messa-what?

1313
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:15,514
A Messerschmitt.
Germany's finest.

1314
01:05:15,558 --> 01:05:17,492
- Can you pick it?
- Unpickable.

1315
01:05:18,494 --> 01:05:20,485
You got, like, a credit card
or something on you?

1316
01:05:21,497 --> 01:05:23,089
- Bam.
- Thanks.

1317
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:27,360
Jose Juanito Gonzales?

1318
01:05:27,403 --> 01:05:30,930
Five foot two?
170 pounds?

1319
01:05:30,974 --> 01:05:33,772
I pickpocket 'em
at the gym.

1320
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,506
Watch and learn,
Stewey.

1321
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:38,571
- Ted, let's just break the glass.
- Chill, muchacho.

1322
01:05:38,615 --> 01:05:40,674
- Almost got it.
- ( bolt clicks )

1323
01:05:43,453 --> 01:05:46,752
Always with you
what can't be done, Stewey.

1324
01:05:51,894 --> 01:05:53,953
( whispers )
Close the door.

1325
01:05:53,997 --> 01:05:55,965
Eve: What do I do?
What do I do?

1326
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:03,671
Dog.

1327
01:06:03,706 --> 01:06:06,300
Ha-ha.
They must've got a new puppy.

1328
01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:08,037
Hey, little doggie.

1329
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,544
Eve:
Stay back or I'll--

1330
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:11,638
- Now we gotcha.
- Ted: She looks dangerous.

1331
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:14,448
For you.

1332
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:18,211
On three or on two?

1333
01:06:19,255 --> 01:06:20,984
Ah.

1334
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:22,457
There's no place
for you to go.

1335
01:06:22,492 --> 01:06:25,859
( Eve barking )
Oh, man. These guys mean business.

1336
01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:28,329
- One.
- Three! Ha!

1337
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:29,558
Eve:
Zeus, help!

1338
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,829
- ( laughs )
- ( barking )

1339
01:06:31,868 --> 01:06:33,392
Ted:
She don't look that tough.

1340
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:34,960
- Stewey: Now we gotcha.
- ( chuckles )

1341
01:06:35,004 --> 01:06:37,268
- ( laughs )
- Let's tie her up inside here.

1342
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:39,537
- Let's do this.
- Ted: You stay here

1343
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:41,475
and don't cause no trouble.

1344
01:06:41,511 --> 01:06:43,445
Come on,
let's get that star.

1345
01:06:43,479 --> 01:06:46,039
Eve:
Help me! Someone!

1346
01:06:46,082 --> 01:06:47,572
Zeus!

1347
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:52,879
Belinda, if you just
let me explain.

1348
01:06:52,922 --> 01:06:55,186
I have nothing to say to you,
George Bannister.

1349
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:56,623
Ben:
Nice work, Dad.

1350
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:58,889
Kara: Yeah, you're a real
smooth smoothie.

1351
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:00,987
Babs: This is low,
even for you.

1352
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,056
- It's complicated, okay?
- Do not try to weasel out of this.

1353
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,727
Just admit what you did.

1354
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:07,326
I didn't do anything wrong.

1355
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:09,838
- ( sighs )
- ( sighs )

1356
01:07:12,175 --> 01:07:14,439
( Zeus sighs )

1357
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:17,674
We had some good times.
Didn't we, guys?

1358
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,010
( glass breaks )

1359
01:08:32,054 --> 01:08:33,487
Eve:
I wish Zeus was here.

1360
01:08:33,523 --> 01:08:35,548
Zeus:
I bet you do.

1361
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:38,651
Zeus! Boy, am I glad
to see you, big brother.

1362
01:08:38,694 --> 01:08:41,788
Sit tight, pup.
I have a score to settle.

1363
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:45,926
All right, keep your eyes
peeled for Zeus.

1364
01:08:45,968 --> 01:08:47,629
Stewey:
I can smell him.

1365
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:59,447
- Ted, na-na-na-na-na--
- Stew, look at that.

1366
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,718
She's beautiful.

1367
01:09:02,752 --> 01:09:05,277
It is beautiful.

1368
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:06,618
How are we gonna get
that thing down?

1369
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:08,351
I saw a chainsaw
in the yard.

1370
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:10,757
I'll take it out, cut the tree in half--
( imitates chainsaw buzzing )

1371
01:09:10,793 --> 01:09:12,317
Chainsaw?

1372
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:15,524
What-- there's a hallway up there.

1373
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:17,965
Go up the stairs,
go up in the hallway,

1374
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,695
lean over the railing,
and pluck the star.

1375
01:09:19,735 --> 01:09:21,669
- Then we get out of here.
- Nah, I'm scared of heights.

1376
01:09:21,704 --> 01:09:23,729
Go up the stairs
and get the star.

1377
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:25,866
Ted, I'm scared of heights.
You know this.

1378
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:30,110
Fine. I'll do it.
No funny business.

1379
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:31,670
This is business-business.

1380
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:33,375
( laughs )
Sucker.

1381
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:38,919
Eve: My big brother
is gonna teach you guys a lesson.

1382
01:09:38,955 --> 01:09:40,718
Here we go.

1383
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:45,753
( grunting )

1384
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:48,963
Zeus:
Bad idea.

1385
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,130
( barking )
We gotta stop meeting like this.

1386
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:57,469
- ( Zeus barking )
- ( straining )

1387
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:03,474
- ( both yelling )
- Oof!

1388
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:07,040
Zeus:
Hi, boys. Miss me?

1389
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,984
It's Zeus! It's Zeus!
It's Zeus!

1390
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:12,146
Let's get him.
Get up.

1391
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:17,692
Okay, he's upstairs.

1392
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:21,154
- Oh! What the--
- Stewey: Ah!

1393
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,865
( barking )

1394
01:10:25,902 --> 01:10:27,995
No, no, no, no.
Don't chase him.

1395
01:10:28,037 --> 01:10:30,096
That's exactly
what he wants us to do.

1396
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:32,107
Gotta use the old onion here,
Stewey.

1397
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:33,836
Come on. Come on.

1398
01:10:36,712 --> 01:10:38,577
Zeus: Think I'm gonna need
a little backup on this one.

1399
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:47,384
Hmm. I wonder if Francine
is working dispatch tonight.

1400
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:50,788
( phone ringing )

1401
01:10:50,826 --> 01:10:53,192
Man's voice: This is 9-1-1.
What is your emergency?

1402
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:55,891
- ( barking )
- Hello?

1403
01:10:55,932 --> 01:10:58,901
Zeus: Nothing says
Merry Christmas like a SWAT team.

1404
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:03,468
- What are you thinking about, Ted?
- Shh. Enough of this.

1405
01:11:03,506 --> 01:11:05,497
Ted: We are gonna let Zeus
come to us.

1406
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,236
Stewey: Ted, why are we waiting
by the front door?

1407
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:09,403
Ted: Shut up, Stewey.
Give me my net.

1408
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:11,640
All right, Stewey.
Let's get out of here

1409
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:14,241
- before Zeus comes back.
- Zeus: Had enough, boys?

1410
01:11:14,283 --> 01:11:16,877
Can't take the heat
from canine numero uno?

1411
01:11:19,889 --> 01:11:21,880
Time to take out
the tr-- whoops.

1412
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:24,825
- Ha! Ah.
- ( whines )

1413
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:27,829
( laughs )
You ain't so tough.

1414
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:30,991
You ain't so tough.
Huh, police dog?

1415
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:33,160
Look what I got for you, huh?

1416
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:36,831
Right here.
Yeah, muzzle for you.

1417
01:11:36,872 --> 01:11:38,999
Keep your mouth shut.

1418
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:40,906
Zeus: You better hope
I don't get out of this thing.

1419
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:42,774
Eve: Hey, stay out
of my doggie treats.

1420
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:44,302
Ted:
Big tough police dog.

1421
01:11:44,347 --> 01:11:46,645
- Stewey.
- What?

1422
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:48,479
- Throw me the rope.
- Ted, they got nothing to eat.

1423
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:50,314
Stewey, Stewey--

1424
01:11:51,487 --> 01:11:53,955
You ain't going anywhere,
Zeusie.

1425
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,821
Zeus:
This was not part of the plan.

1426
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:58,292
Let's go get that star.
Grab the bag.

1427
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:04,558
Okay, now I'm gonna
get the star,

1428
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,227
and we give it to Tony Rowe.

1429
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:09,760
All right. I got an idea.
Check this out.

1430
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:12,830
What are you,
the Lone Ranger?

1431
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:14,103
Watch, watch, watch.

1432
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:16,976
Wait.

1433
01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:18,640
- Eve: Zeus?
- Zeus: Yeah?

1434
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:20,376
There's something
I have to tell you.

1435
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:22,782
- I'm sorry I didn't treat you so nice.
- Yeah?

1436
01:12:22,818 --> 01:12:25,218
I saw how the Bannisters
were with you.

1437
01:12:25,254 --> 01:12:27,745
And I wanted that love
all to myself.

1438
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:30,623
I just figured if I tried
to make you look bad,

1439
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,026
that it would make
me look good.

1440
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:36,862
But it backfired and now
we're in this terrible mess.

1441
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:40,858
The only good thing is it's made me
realize how mean I was to you.

1442
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:43,167
And how sorry l truly am.

1443
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:45,673
Zeus: Looks like
someone's grown up a bit.

1444
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,539
Eve:
I'll say.

1445
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:49,544
Zeus:
I'm sorry, too, Eve.

1446
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:51,773
- For what?
- I should've been

1447
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:54,681
more of a big brother to you
instead of a competitor.

1448
01:12:54,717 --> 01:12:58,983
Truth is, Eve, I'm glad to have you
as my little sister.

1449
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:01,182
Eve:
You really mean that?

1450
01:13:01,223 --> 01:13:04,317
Zeus:
Cross my snout and hope to fly.

1451
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,557
Eve: I'm glad to have you
as my big brother, Zeus.

1452
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:09,962
I wish we had
more time together.

1453
01:13:09,999 --> 01:13:13,400
This is the end
of the puppy trail for us.

1454
01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:15,927
Zeus: I forgot to tell you
rule number seven.

1455
01:13:15,971 --> 01:13:19,805
Even when all hope is lost,
never give up.

1456
01:13:19,842 --> 01:13:22,777
- Yeah, but--
- Butts are for sniffin'!

1457
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:24,837
Now get your poker face on,
little sister.

1458
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,077
'Cause big brother's about to show you
how to save Christmas Eve.

1459
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:29,345
Eve:
Cool.

1460
01:13:31,554 --> 01:13:32,748
Zeus:
Follow my lead.

1461
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,414
Eve:
Okay.

1462
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:38,450
I can do this,
I can do this.

1463
01:13:41,731 --> 01:13:42,925
Oh.

1464
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,796
( chiming )

1465
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:46,734
Tony Rowe's voice:
"Christmas, 1:00 a.m. in the morning."

1466
01:13:46,769 --> 01:13:48,066
Ted:
We're late.

1467
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:50,866
Ted, hurry up.

1468
01:13:54,143 --> 01:13:56,611
These guys gotta be sniffing glue
or something.

1469
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:58,545
I mean,
I threatened them, right?

1470
01:13:59,582 --> 01:14:01,550
Last couple of clowns
that made me wait this long,

1471
01:14:01,584 --> 01:14:03,552
- they got their thumbs plucked.
- Yeah.

1472
01:14:03,586 --> 01:14:05,383
They're getting cured
in a jar of pickle juice now.

1473
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:07,651
Maybe they plan on
keeping the star for themselves.

1474
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,659
Man, they could've been halfway
to Bolivia by now.

1475
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:11,853
Yeah, whatever.

1476
01:14:11,894 --> 01:14:13,919
Hey, just goes to show you.

1477
01:14:13,963 --> 01:14:16,022
You know, if you want anything
done right...

1478
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:21,764
- you gotta do it yourself.
- That's right, boss.

1479
01:14:21,804 --> 01:14:23,635
Make sure this thing is sharp.

1480
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:27,671
Zeus:
That's it. Keep pulling, kid.

1481
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:31,246
Almost free.

1482
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,180
Eve:
I think we make a good team.

1483
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,208
Zeus:
Whoo. We did it.

1484
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:39,778
Eve:
Stupid ropes. I'll show you.

1485
01:14:39,822 --> 01:14:41,312
Zeus: Come on, kid.
Forget about that stuff.

1486
01:14:41,357 --> 01:14:43,917
Eve: Oh, yeah, right.
Here we go.

1487
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:48,525
Wait.

1488
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:51,328
Ted, watch me.
The onion.

1489
01:14:55,805 --> 01:14:57,636
( glass breaking )

1490
01:14:57,673 --> 01:14:59,072
( loud thump )

1491
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:03,777
( gasping )

1492
01:15:05,247 --> 01:15:07,215
Stewey.

1493
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:12,049
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

1494
01:15:12,087 --> 01:15:15,284
Good job.
It's amazing.

1495
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:17,087
Can I smell it?

1496
01:15:17,126 --> 01:15:19,151
No, you're not gonna smell it.

1497
01:15:19,195 --> 01:15:21,789
We gotta get this to Tony Rowe.
Let's get out of here.

1498
01:15:27,837 --> 01:15:30,738
Zeus:
Oh, yeah. It might just work.

1499
01:15:39,715 --> 01:15:41,205
Eve:
Taking a bath?

1500
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,774
( Zeus laughs )
Not quite.

1501
01:15:42,818 --> 01:15:44,945
We're gonna
make these bubbles work for us.

1502
01:15:44,987 --> 01:15:47,080
Oh, and put these
over your ears just in case.

1503
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:50,455
- Eve: No way.
- Now's no time for pride, sis.

1504
01:15:50,492 --> 01:15:53,120
Speaking of which,
excuse me for just a moment.

1505
01:15:55,931 --> 01:15:57,899
Eve:
Hey, what about rule number two?

1506
01:15:57,933 --> 01:15:59,161
Zeus:
We're at war, right?

1507
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:03,069
And rule number eight is there are
no rules during war, little sis.

1508
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:06,605
Stewey:
We did it, we did it.

1509
01:16:06,642 --> 01:16:08,166
Ted: The dogs got out.

1510
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:11,008
- ( yelling )
- Stewey, run!

1511
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:12,479
( Zeus, Eve barking )

1512
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:18,145
Ted! Ted!

1513
01:16:18,187 --> 01:16:21,953
Ted! Ted! Ted! Ted!

1514
01:16:21,991 --> 01:16:24,186
- Ted!
- ( grunts )

1515
01:16:24,226 --> 01:16:25,784
( barks )

1516
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:27,455
Ted, get up.
There's two of 'em.

1517
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:29,430
Zeus and his clone.
I'm scared, Ted.

1518
01:16:29,465 --> 01:16:30,898
Okay, don't move.

1519
01:16:30,933 --> 01:16:33,265
- ( barking )
- Ted, he's foaming.

1520
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:35,133
Ted, that's rabies.
I saw "Cujo."

1521
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:36,762
- That's a good movie.
- I'm scared, Ted.

1522
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:38,932
- Stand your ground.
- ( growling )

1523
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:40,373
- Ted...
- Okay, okay.

1524
01:16:40,409 --> 01:16:42,343
- I'm scared, Ted.
- Wait a minute.

1525
01:16:42,378 --> 01:16:44,778
( sniffs )
That's not foam.

1526
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:48,012
That's soap.

1527
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,677
( sniffs )
You're right.

1528
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,208
The high-end type.

1529
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:53,551
Eve:
Uh-oh. Um, Zeus?

1530
01:16:53,589 --> 01:16:55,648
All right.
Enough fun and games.

1531
01:16:55,691 --> 01:16:57,625
Nighty-night,
sweet prince.

1532
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,560
( high-pitched whining )

1533
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:08,668
Ted, it's not working.
I told you we should've tried it out.

1534
01:17:08,704 --> 01:17:11,366
Zeus:
Antler muffs, fool.

1535
01:17:11,407 --> 01:17:14,934
Okay, enough of these
baby games again.

1536
01:17:14,977 --> 01:17:17,377
- ( barks )
- I'll strangle him with my bare hands.

1537
01:17:17,413 --> 01:17:20,211
I'll smash him.
I'm gonna commit a doggie homicide.

1538
01:17:20,249 --> 01:17:21,546
( grunts )

1539
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:27,251
( Tony laughing )

1540
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:31,352
Thought you were gonna
sneak off on me, eh?

1541
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:33,861
( groans )

1542
01:17:33,896 --> 01:17:37,332
- Where's my star?
- It's right here, Mr. Rowe.

1543
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:39,061
Ted:
I got it right here for you.

1544
01:17:40,069 --> 01:17:42,264
- There you go, sir.
- Lou.

1545
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,068
It's all forgiven, right?

1546
01:17:50,612 --> 01:17:52,944
( laughing )

1547
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:54,540
This thing is a fugese.

1548
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,050
- Stewey: What? What?
- Ted: What?

1549
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:57,518
It's fake. Forget about it.

1550
01:17:57,553 --> 01:17:59,851
These things are made out of glass.
Somewhere in China.

1551
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:01,617
- That can't be.
- No, can be.

1552
01:18:02,624 --> 01:18:05,320
So much for legends. Guess we're gonna
have to settle for their thumbs.

1553
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:07,295
- Stewey: Don't! No!
- Don't do it! No, no, no, no, no!

1554
01:18:08,297 --> 01:18:10,857
I get a pretty penny for them
on the black market.

1555
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:12,924
Hold on.
( humming )

1556
01:18:12,968 --> 01:18:16,734
No, no, no. It's okay.
Just think peaceful, loving thoughts.

1557
01:18:16,772 --> 01:18:17,864
Yeah, like that.

1558
01:18:17,906 --> 01:18:19,567
Zeus:
Follow my lead, Eve.

1559
01:18:19,608 --> 01:18:22,406
It'll help you process the pain.

1560
01:18:22,444 --> 01:18:23,433
- Come here.
- No!

1561
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:25,879
- Zeus: Timber!
- Eve: Whoo-hoo!

1562
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:28,178
Mikey:
Boss, look out!

1563
01:18:29,785 --> 01:18:31,082
- ( sirens wailing )
- ( barking )

1564
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,917
I don't believe it.

1565
01:18:32,955 --> 01:18:34,286
Zeus saved us.

1566
01:18:34,323 --> 01:18:36,848
- ( door opens )
- Police officers!

1567
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:38,223
Let's blow this joint.
Come on, let's go.

1568
01:18:41,797 --> 01:18:44,061
- Hey, nobody move.
- Hands in the air!

1569
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:46,932
No, go this way!

1570
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:49,837
Zeus:
They're all yours, boys.

1571
01:18:49,872 --> 01:18:51,635
Me and my little sis
took care of them.

1572
01:18:51,673 --> 01:18:52,901
Eve:
Boo-yah.

1573
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:54,374
Is that who I think it is?

1574
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:56,674
Partner: That's Tony Rowe,
the infamous loan shark.

1575
01:18:56,712 --> 01:18:58,771
( officer grunts )
Infamous, huh?

1576
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:01,408
- Where am I, Ma?
- Officer: Not quite.

1577
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,042
( police radio chattering )

1578
01:19:03,085 --> 01:19:05,553
- Partner: Let's go.
- Come on. You're going downtown.

1579
01:19:10,392 --> 01:19:11,950
This way, Tony.

1580
01:19:19,935 --> 01:19:21,266
Ted, what do you see?

1581
01:19:21,303 --> 01:19:23,601
I never saw these guys before
in my life.

1582
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:26,039
- ( laughs ) I don't believe it.
- What?

1583
01:19:26,075 --> 01:19:28,066
Ted: Tony Rowe and his goons
are gonna take the fall.

1584
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:30,101
- They're gonna take the rap.
- ( laughs )

1585
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:32,170
Watch this.
They're probably gonna tell you

1586
01:19:32,214 --> 01:19:33,772
they live here or something.
Don't believe them.

1587
01:19:38,187 --> 01:19:40,087
What's going on here?

1588
01:19:40,122 --> 01:19:42,420
These two
broke into the house.

1589
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:44,824
- On Christmas Eve?
- George: Yeah.

1590
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,020
Happens to us all the time.

1591
01:19:47,696 --> 01:19:49,823
I was framed, lady.
I'm telling ya, I was framed.

1592
01:19:49,865 --> 01:19:52,459
- I didn't do nothing.
- ( laughs )

1593
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:54,264
- I hope he rots in jail.
- Shh.

1594
01:19:54,303 --> 01:19:56,703
Stewey, do you know
what this means?

1595
01:19:56,738 --> 01:19:58,968
- What?
- We're free.

1596
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:01,669
No more Tony Rowe,
no more debt we owe anybody.

1597
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,042
We can finally go
where we always talked about going.

1598
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:06,411
- The Vatican?
- No, you idiot.

1599
01:20:06,448 --> 01:20:08,143
Miami.

1600
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:11,152
Ah! That's where he hit me
in the head with a shovel.

1601
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:14,019
We frisked 'em good.
They're clean, thanks to these dogs.

1602
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:16,616
- The dogs?
- Yeah, it seems these two labs

1603
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:18,785
had a hand
in stopping these guys.

1604
01:20:18,827 --> 01:20:21,887
- I can't believe it.
- Babs: Oh, my goodness.

1605
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:25,457
- Isn't that wonderful?
- ( barking )

1606
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:26,991
Eve:
All in a day's work.

1607
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,332
- ( barking continues )
- Babs: You know,

1608
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,531
I've got a date
with a fuse box.

1609
01:20:30,572 --> 01:20:32,563
If you could just--
thank you.

1610
01:20:32,608 --> 01:20:34,166
- Oh.
- Let's go to jail, Tony.

1611
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:35,870
- ( Zeus barks )
- George: Hey.

1612
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:37,845
- Aw.
- Hey, Zeus.

1613
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,472
Daddy didn't mean
to blow up on you.

1614
01:20:39,515 --> 01:20:42,450
No, Daddy loves you.
You know that.

1615
01:20:42,484 --> 01:20:44,577
- ( Eve whines )
- And you, too, you little squirt.

1616
01:20:46,121 --> 01:20:49,989
Here, honey.
Take Eve, okay?

1617
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:52,050
Be careful.

1618
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:53,686
Good boy, Zeus.

1619
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:55,754
Wish I could say
the same for you, George.

1620
01:20:55,797 --> 01:20:57,492
( sighs )
Belinda, please.

1621
01:20:57,533 --> 01:20:59,398
It's all gonna work out.
Trust me, okay?

1622
01:20:59,434 --> 01:21:01,265
- What is going on?
- I'm gonna let you know

1623
01:21:01,303 --> 01:21:03,066
- in about two minutes.
- ( car approaching )

1624
01:21:07,676 --> 01:21:09,007
Sarah Sattler?

1625
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:13,375
- George Bannister?
- Yes.

1626
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,280
Thank you so much
for coming.

1627
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:18,218
How could I not?
I mean, I felt partially responsible

1628
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:19,948
for this whole
misunderstanding.

1629
01:21:19,988 --> 01:21:22,354
- Here it is, just like you wanted it.
- Thank you.

1630
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:24,416
Thank you so much.
Belinda, honey,

1631
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:26,893
this is Sarah.

1632
01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:29,227
Sarah Sattler,
from Sattler Jewelers.

1633
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,789
Formerly from Atlanta,
but now we're here in Malibu,

1634
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:33,460
- living the good life.
- Oh.

1635
01:21:33,502 --> 01:21:35,561
Oh, wow.
You were right.

1636
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:37,401
What a dynamic smile.

1637
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:40,875
I know.
First thing I fell in love with.

1638
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:45,211
Plus, she's a little preggo,
so she's glowing.

1639
01:21:45,247 --> 01:21:47,272
I'm really confused.

1640
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:49,910
Oh, well.
Merry Christmas to you both.

1641
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:52,250
- Bye.
- George: Thank you again.

1642
01:21:55,991 --> 01:21:57,720
- George, what are you doing?
- ( car engine starts )

1643
01:21:57,759 --> 01:22:01,559
I'm so sorry for sneaking
around on you, but I wasn't.

1644
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:03,394
But if I was, I'd be sorry.

1645
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,601
But I wasn't.
I just wanted this to be a surprise.

1646
01:22:07,636 --> 01:22:11,072
- What to be a surprise?
- Your anniversary gift.

1647
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:17,903
- Belinda: Oh.
- Belinda Theodora Bannister,

1648
01:22:17,946 --> 01:22:21,109
will you marry me again?

1649
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:22,616
Oh--

1650
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:26,087
- George.
- You gotta read the inside.

1651
01:22:28,624 --> 01:22:33,391
"Love, your cuddly
Georgie Porgie Bear."

1652
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:38,393
Oh, George.
I feel like such a fool.

1653
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:39,695
Right?

1654
01:22:39,735 --> 01:22:41,703
( gasps )
Is this from the--

1655
01:22:41,737 --> 01:22:43,602
Yeah, yeah.
That's from your earring.

1656
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:46,335
- The first gift I ever gave you.
- The first gift you ever gave me.

1657
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:48,843
Oh, George,
this is so romantic.

1658
01:22:48,877 --> 01:22:50,674
I know,
so what do you think?

1659
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:56,713
Yes! Yes, of course I will marry you
again, George Bannister!

1660
01:22:56,752 --> 01:22:59,243
( laughing )

1661
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:04,614
( beeps )

1662
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:09,862
( yells, laughs )

1663
01:23:10,866 --> 01:23:12,629
They finally worked.

1664
01:23:18,974 --> 01:23:20,965
Yes! Yes!

1665
01:23:21,009 --> 01:23:22,909
Well, better late than never.

1666
01:23:22,944 --> 01:23:26,880
- Oh.
- I concede, Babs.

1667
01:23:26,915 --> 01:23:29,383
You're smarter
than you look, Ned.

1668
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:32,819
Don't let it go to your head.
Halloween is right around the corner.

1669
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:34,219
I know.

1670
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,295
You know, there's a--

1671
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:44,925
there's this big Christmas light
convention in spring.

1672
01:23:44,966 --> 01:23:48,060
Top-of-the-line
North Pole paraphernalia.

1673
01:23:48,103 --> 01:23:50,333
The one in Boston.

1674
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:54,475
You know your stuff.

1675
01:23:54,509 --> 01:23:57,842
I always wanted to go.
I just didn't want to go alone.

1676
01:24:00,248 --> 01:24:02,614
Well, uh...

1677
01:24:02,651 --> 01:24:04,881
I thought...

1678
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:08,613
maybe--
maybe the two of us--

1679
01:24:08,657 --> 01:24:10,818
I'd love to, Ned.

1680
01:24:14,196 --> 01:24:16,426
- I love you, honey.
- I love you, too.

1681
01:24:16,465 --> 01:24:18,194
- ( whistling )
- ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪

1682
01:24:18,233 --> 01:24:20,394
♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪

1683
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:23,962
♪ And a Happy New Year. ♪

1684
01:24:24,005 --> 01:24:26,269
Zeus:
Merry Christmas to all...

1685
01:24:26,308 --> 01:24:28,208
Eve:
And to all a good night.

1686
01:24:48,697 --> 01:24:52,098
Stewey, you think that star
ever really existed?

1687
01:24:52,134 --> 01:24:54,659
( beeping )

1688
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:58,739
Ted:
This is peaceful, huh?

1689
01:24:58,774 --> 01:25:00,207
- What'd you say, Ted?
- It's peaceful.

1690
01:25:00,242 --> 01:25:01,607
Yeah, it's okay.

1691
01:25:01,643 --> 01:25:04,544
( meter squeals )

1692
01:25:04,579 --> 01:25:06,672
Ted: Stewey, you're always worried.

1693
01:25:06,715 --> 01:25:09,183
Gotta imagine,
no more Tony Rowe,

1694
01:25:09,217 --> 01:25:11,276
no more bathing stinking dogs.

1695
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:12,877
Ted: Yeah.

1696
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:14,513
Nice.

1697
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:16,319
Ted: I say we made it.
I think we've made it.

1698
01:25:16,358 --> 01:25:19,327
- Stewey: Look at it, huh?
- This is what it's all about.

1699
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:20,828
Stewey:
I don't know.

1700
01:25:28,603 --> 01:25:29,938
( music playing )

1701
01:25:29,938 --> 01:25:30,927
( music playing )

1702
01:25:30,972 --> 01:25:32,908
Like it?

1703
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:33,897
( laughing )

1704
01:25:33,942 --> 01:25:36,740
Man:
Ready, guys?

1705
01:25:36,778 --> 01:25:38,075
( laughing )

1706
01:25:38,113 --> 01:25:41,082
- Man: Show her the--
- ( laughs )

1707
01:25:41,116 --> 01:25:43,584
Man #2: All right, roll sound.
We're rolling.

1708
01:25:45,554 --> 01:25:47,078
- Cain: Pull yourself together.
- Keep smacking me.

1709
01:25:47,122 --> 01:25:49,022
Keep smacking me.
Keep smacking.

1710
01:25:49,057 --> 01:25:50,319
Cain: Stewey, come on.
Pull yourself together.

1711
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:51,848
Keep smacking,
keep smacking.

1712
01:25:51,893 --> 01:25:53,360
Backwards, the other--
with the backhand.

1713
01:25:53,395 --> 01:25:55,124
Cain:
Pull yourself together, Stewey.

1714
01:25:56,465 --> 01:25:58,831
Woman: Aw.

1715
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,664
- Aw, she's very sweet.
- Aw, she's so good.

1716
01:26:00,702 --> 01:26:02,033
- She's so cute.
- So sweet.

1717
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:03,970
Aw, what a cute girl.

1718
01:26:04,005 --> 01:26:06,200
( laughing )

1719
01:26:09,044 --> 01:26:10,375
Salud.

1720
01:26:10,412 --> 01:26:11,504
( laughs )

1721
01:26:11,546 --> 01:26:12,877
- Really?
- I had to.

1722
01:26:12,914 --> 01:26:15,109
- In the middle of this?
- Listen to me. I'm not finished.

1723
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:17,311
- Smell it.
- I'm not only--

1724
01:26:17,352 --> 01:26:19,980
- ( laughs )
- Smell that, live that. It's lunch.

1725
01:26:20,021 --> 01:26:22,148
Diaz: Sorry about that.
No bueno.

1726
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:25,819
The North Pole will be calling me
about my strategy for--

1727
01:26:25,861 --> 01:26:28,421
( mumbles )

1728
01:26:28,463 --> 01:26:30,931
Man: And, uh, try not to step away
from your mark, okay?

1729
01:26:30,966 --> 01:26:33,059
Madonne.

1730
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:35,365
- Man: You ready?
- ( laughs )

1731
01:26:37,672 --> 01:26:40,937
( laughing )
What's the matter?
