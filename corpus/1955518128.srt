1
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,022
Flash: Speed it up, will you?

2
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,356
You drive like my granny.

3
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,991
We're moving with
the flow of traffic.

4
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,359
When do I get to drive?

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,528
My car, so, never.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,563
Ooh, I'm gonna sign in
this thing called Twitter.

7
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:34,366
You put up what you're
thinking like, "I love pizza,"

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:38,237
or "I'm having pizza now",
or even "pizza is awesome."

9
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,106
All your thoughts don't
have to be pizza related.

10
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,241
Says who?

11
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:43,475
Hey, I could order a pizza,

12
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,511
while we're puttering
along here.

13
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:46,812
Ooh, great idea.

14
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,947
Gonna have pizza soon.

15
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,215
First twit sent.

16
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,784
What the heck is that?

17
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,122
- Flash, go find out.
- On it.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,628
- Report.
- You need to see for yourself.

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,129
I'm not totally sure.

20
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,616
Big week for us. First, we
stop the fearsome five.

21
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:25,717
They were so pissed.

22
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,686
"You'll pay for
interfering with us."

23
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:28,921
Blah, blah, blah.

24
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,323
Speedy: And now we get to
stop an alien brawl.

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,597
Speedy: Which side do we join?

26
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,133
- Really?
- Looks can be deceiving.

27
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,578
Titans, go!

28
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,149
And the fact that she's hot
has nothing to do with it.

29
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,489
Buzz off, lizard lips!

30
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,591
Coming through. Excuse me.

31
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:06,658
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

32
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,423
I think rapunzel is trying
to tell us something.

33
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,928
Speedy, you got something
loud to close that thing?

34
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,229
Got you covered, boss.

35
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,048
Whoa!

36
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,679
I did not see that coming.

37
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,916
Thank you.

38
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,452
I am koriand'r of tamaran.

39
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,288
Our kind can learn language
from the act of kissing.

40
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,557
Useful.

41
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,198
Are you all right?

42
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,035
My sister, komand'r, staged
a coup and took the throne.

43
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,370
I had to flee.

44
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,606
But I will soon return.

45
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,908
Well, you can stay with us
until you figure it out.

46
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,276
Okay?

47
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,479
Yes, please.

48
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,048
I will ask sanctuary
for two or three days.

49
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,583
A week at the longest.

50
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,452
Let me introduce you
to my friends.

51
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,258
Oh, by the way,
I speak some Spanish,

52
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,459
if you wanna learn that.

53
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,060
Second year high school French.

54
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,431
Welcome to the teen titans.

55
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,784
Man: Careful, you fool.

56
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,520
This equipment is worth
more than your lives.

57
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,294
What?

58
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,797
Deathstroke: <i>The titans will be
there in less than a minute.</i>

59
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,834
I see no signs of that.

60
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,737
Believe, don't believe,
your choice.

61
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,426
They're ready.

62
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,894
They're slow.

63
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,896
I hardly had time
to answer a post.

64
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,436
It's a tough climb,
especially in this moonlight.

65
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,471
Starfire: Nightwing.

66
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,739
They're bound to spot us.

67
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:14,573
Nightwing.

68
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:15,907
If we wait for those clouds...

69
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:16,975
Dick!

70
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,043
What?

71
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,811
Terra is taking us up there.

72
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:20,979
She is?

73
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,582
Yeah, I do all the dirty work
around here.

74
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,126
Going up.

75
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,462
You've been gone
a long time, cowboy.

76
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,432
Let's move.

77
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,214
Quiet down.

78
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,449
The bug is nervous.

79
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,584
I'm not feeling too good
about this myself.

80
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,786
How come you're so calm?

81
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,721
You have never been a gopher.

82
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,960
Hey!

83
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,095
Scarab, stop.

84
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,229
Control that thing, beetle,

85
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,031
or I'll control it for you.

86
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,699
You're going to have
a sword fight in here?

87
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,635
How about some place roomier
like a broom closet?

88
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,270
Everyone, calm down.

89
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,704
The enemy is above us.

90
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,573
You have to channel
all your thoughts to that.

91
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,109
Remember, these
opponents are different.

92
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,144
Uh, as kori will tell you.

93
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,979
No, keep going.

94
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,248
I've been studying them
since I left the titans.

95
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,250
They're zealots, extremists.

96
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,086
They'll sacrifice themselves
without hesitation to get to you.

97
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,456
So, the quicker we
take them down, the better.

98
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,558
That about cover it?

99
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,625
Very well said.

100
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,629
Terra, can you do this?

101
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,533
Yes, if you'd all shut up.

102
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,441
We're six inches
under the floor.

103
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,677
Who wants to knock?

104
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,620
Titans, go!

105
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,136
"Thanks for getting us into the
impenetrable h.I.V.E base, terra."

106
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,705
"Yeah, you're the best."

107
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,743
This bad guy is yours, mama.

108
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:41,186
Terra, stay with us.

109
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,855
Like I couldn't take out
all these jokers by myself.

110
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,694
We've been compromised.

111
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,263
Abandon the base.

112
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,972
They prepared well.

113
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,574
Their reaction time
is much better.

114
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,809
Robin, stop complementing
the bad guys.

115
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,145
But he's right.
Be ready for anything.

116
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,783
These dudes must buy their
bad guy stuff in bulk.

117
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,288
How about we do that move
you taught me last weekend?

118
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,856
Now?

119
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:21,026
I admire your boldness,
but what will the team think?

120
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,161
What? No, not...

121
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,364
Okay, you got me.

122
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,066
The training move, please.

123
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,198
Get in the truck.

124
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,872
Your service has come to an end.

125
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,677
Bless you all.

126
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,803
Watch it, dude.
Those are my friends.

127
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,240
At least act like you're trying to
keep your parasite in line, beetle.

128
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,750
That was unbearable.

129
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,985
Get it?

130
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,754
Seriously?

131
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,530
Could you not leave yourself
open like that?

132
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:06,831
I worry.

133
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,299
I'm sorry, babe.

134
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,802
I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

135
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,137
About what?

136
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,352
I think we should take the
next step in our relationship.

137
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,283
To be continued.

138
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,165
Say cheese,

139
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,966
and post.

140
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,235
Hey, how about a movie tonight?

141
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,503
Whoa!

142
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,905
Keep moving, magilla.

143
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,843
The base is ours.

144
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,717
So, what were you saying
before we were interrupted?

145
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,485
I...

146
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,697
Okay, good a place as any.

147
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,466
I got an apartment in the city.

148
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,402
I hoped, maybe,
we could share, you know,

149
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,470
together.

150
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,738
Oh, snap!

151
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,678
No rock?

152
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,946
That's so lame.

153
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,784
On tamaran, everyone
would gossip.

154
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,519
So it's a good thing
we live here.

155
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,959
What I'm getting is that they're
too good to hang with us.

156
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,761
Yeah, that's the takeaway.

157
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,332
Hey, I'm over
a million followers!

158
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,562
Call me <i>jefe.</i>

159
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,998
You need to get your head
in the game, gar.

160
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,136
Or, maybe your head
is in a different game.

161
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,072
Who wouldn't want to date me?
I'm awesome.

162
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,241
But everything I do
pisses her off.

163
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,577
Want my advice?

164
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,146
Quit turning into a chimp
and stealing monkey kisses.

165
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,049
People think that's adorable.

166
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,984
Nope, no one thinks that.

167
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,353
Time out.

168
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,088
Gotta make a call.

169
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,353
Terra.

170
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,023
Would you like to join me?

171
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,959
The staff helps clear the mind.

172
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,293
No thanks.

173
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,829
I'm just trying to avoid
green bean for a while.

174
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,397
I never cared much for the zoo.

175
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,534
If he's bothering you...

176
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,903
He's just a jerk.

177
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,442
Is it true what they
say about her,

178
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,478
that she has her father trapped
in that Jewel on her head?

179
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,082
Yes, his name is trigon.

180
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,650
He's a demon.

181
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,987
They have issues.

182
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,556
Well, she knows
where she can find him.

183
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,024
You should talk to her more.

184
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,059
You'll find that raven
can be quite

185
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,362
interesting.

186
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,931
No thanks. Too creepy for me.

187
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,474
Sounds like a good time,
milagro.

188
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,109
Did you get my gift?

189
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:15,513
<i>Sure did. Gift card to the
seventeen forever. My favorite.</i>

190
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,982
Mom and dad wanna say hi.
Love you.

191
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,853
There's my baby boy!

192
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,521
Are you getting enough to eat?

193
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,492
Yeah, how's it goin'?

194
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,096
<i>Still doesn't like me, huh?</i>

195
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,498
It's getting better.

196
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,867
Let's not talk about that thing.

197
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,635
It's been two years.

198
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,003
I'm working on it, dad.

199
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,705
But it's hard, you know.

200
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,006
It's got a mind of its own.

201
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,708
- And a temper.
- Aldo.

202
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,411
For god's sake. He's with
a bunch of super heroes.

203
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:49,747
Aldo: <i>You think superman or someone
could take that thing off him.</i>

204
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,382
<i>You're supposed to calm down.</i>

205
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,885
<i>We can't have every call
end this way, Aldo.</i>

206
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,620
<i>Jaime won't wanna talk to us.</i>

207
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,256
Jaime's mom: <i>Why is the cake</i>

208
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,558
coming out? It's not time!

209
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,161
Ah, your aunt, consuela,
<i>esta loca.</i>

210
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,463
Go, mom, we can talk later.

211
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,231
I love you, Jaime.

212
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,299
Be good.

213
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,068
Consuela, give me that cake!

214
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,171
I better go too.

215
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,173
I'm sorry. It's just...

216
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,710
I miss my son.

217
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,068
Female voice: <i>Accessing most
recent footage on brother blood.</i>

218
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,903
Brother blood: <i>Lies.</i>

219
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,672
<i>My church is a holy place</i>

220
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,874
<i>and we strive only to do good.</i>

221
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,576
<i>Come now, brother blood.</i>

222
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,012
<i>Isn't your church
just a glorified cult?</i>

223
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,914
Brother blood: <i>Unlike you,
Bryce, I believe in an America</i>

224
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,318
<i>where all beliefs should be
treated with respect.</i>

225
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,453
<i>It's a shame the press doesn't.</i>

226
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,226
<i>I'm afraid that's all we're going
to get from brother blood.</i>

227
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,694
<i>I'm Bryce Peterson.</i>

228
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,462
<i>Have a good night.</i>

229
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,331
Grandfather would have been
impressed with blood,

230
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,067
running a worldwide cult
as well as h.I.V.E.

231
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,468
They're the same thing.

232
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,370
He just makes them
look separate.

233
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,940
Do you ever get out
of that uniform?

234
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,542
Only when I bathe.

235
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,610
Might be time.

236
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,182
I'm good.

237
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,151
Goin' out.

238
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,786
I hear you're gone a lot.

239
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,555
Where do you go?

240
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,325
You realize I'm not a child who
needs permission to go outside.

241
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,760
Correct?

242
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,596
Damien, I wasn't interrogating.

243
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,798
Just taking an interest.

244
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh!

245
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,002
I go out on patrol.

246
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:54,505
By the way, I should offer congratulations
on your cohabitation, Grayson.

247
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,175
Starfire has proven herself
to be a decent leader.

248
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,143
I approve.

249
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,512
Thank you.

250
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,314
Have you found anything
in the h.I.V.E. Files?

251
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:06,017
Nothing earth-shaking,
but I'm still checking.

252
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,252
Terra: Sounds like
you got squat.

253
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,288
I love endangering
my life for nothing.

254
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,024
Which is why I've added
the newest files to the ones

255
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,359
too damaged to read,
from the previous raids.

256
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,229
I'm hoping the computer will
find a connection we missed.

257
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,931
It may take the program
a day or two.

258
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,499
Not your worst idea.

259
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,701
What?

260
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,640
Ugh!

261
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,943
Hey, anyone seen Jaime?

262
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,145
Yeah, he's right there.

263
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,850
Something is wrong.

264
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,786
Yeah, there is. He's about to
be crushed at foosball.

265
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,987
You wanna come see?

266
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,055
Buzz off.

267
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,563
Maybe you should go.

268
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,799
Might be good to have
two of you down there.

269
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,473
<i>And I say to you.
Those who deny the chosen,</i>

270
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,076
<i>have no place in
the Eden that shall be built.</i>

271
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:09,013
<i>Sinners and blasphemers
who do not share our values</i>

272
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,149
<i>need not apply,</i>

273
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,984
<i>brothers and sisters.</i>

274
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,685
Crowd: <i>Hail, brother blood!</i>

275
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,053
<i>Hail, hail, hail.</i>

276
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,722
<i>Hail, brother blood.</i>

277
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:18,890
<i>Hail, hail, hail...</i>

278
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,097
Ah, there you are, mayhem.

279
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,232
Punctual as always.

280
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,641
How can you be so calm?

281
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:40,244
That was the third base
the titans have destroyed.

282
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,847
My plan is nine centuries
in the making.

283
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,449
In every age, there are always
those who oppose me.

284
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,851
But as you can see,

285
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,720
I am always victorious.

286
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,827
Is that the reporter?

287
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,063
Yes.

288
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,799
Our friend won't be asking
impertinent questions anymore.

289
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:05,403
His heresy does not compare
to the titan's threat.

290
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,672
We barely escaped them.

291
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,006
But you did,

292
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,409
because he warned you.

293
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,544
Our guardian angel.

294
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,979
Oh, stop your fretting, mayhem.

295
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,317
He'll keep the titans at bay.

296
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,289
I've foreseen it.

297
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,626
Plus, I pay the bastard enough.

298
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,504
Beast boy: Could you
slow down, Jaime?

299
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,306
Go back to the tower then.

300
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,708
Nobody asked you to come.

301
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,977
Oh, come on. We're here
to support you.

302
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,245
I'm not.

303
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,850
What I mean is, I respect
Jaime not wanting to talk.

304
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,353
In fact, more people should
learn to shut their mouths.

305
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,787
Well, that's no fun.

306
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,066
Uh, okay, I give up.

307
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,334
The center.

308
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,004
My parents volunteer
for the one in my town.

309
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,071
And...

310
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,840
Maybe I should volunteer.

311
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,575
Yeah, right.

312
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,311
We're titans.

313
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,746
We don't serve soup.

314
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,214
You don't have to
move a mountain

315
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,349
to help people, terra.

316
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,285
Besides, I gotta find a way
to make the bug

317
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,287
more comfortable around humans.

318
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,028
Can I help you?

319
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,095
Yes, um,

320
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,730
Traci.

321
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,433
I was wondering who I can
speak to about volunteering?

322
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,768
That would be me.

323
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,570
And there it is.

324
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,938
Just because we have powers

325
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,007
doesn't mean we can't, you know,

326
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,442
have relationships.

327
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,710
Don't you think?

328
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,416
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with having a life, right?

329
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,718
Kill her!

330
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,253
Kill the demon!

331
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,056
What's the matter?

332
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,262
Nothing.

333
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,930
This is lame. I'm out.

334
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,809
For nearly a millennium, I have
bathed in my enemy's blood,

335
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,777
and for some mysterious reason,

336
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,246
it has provided me immortality.

337
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,115
I have often wondered why?

338
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,350
Why me?

339
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,884
But now I know.

340
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,222
It was meant to bring me
to this age,

341
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,358
this place, this moment,

342
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,497
where technology can at last
be made to serve my greatness.

343
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,733
Proceed.

344
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,086
You've done well.

345
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,922
Advance the preparations,
mayhem. The time has come

346
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:49,627
for us to move from
immortality to glory.

347
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,563
Mayhem: Your service
has come to an end.

348
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,532
Bless you, my son.

349
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,448
Nightwing: For a space Princess,

350
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,016
you sure have a lot of stuff.

351
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,657
I've had this
since I was a little girl.

352
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,826
It was the only thing
I had time to take.

353
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,232
Not again.

354
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,839
Robin: Terra, are you okay?

355
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,540
She's going to bring
the building down.

356
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:37,975
I can help.

357
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,981
What are you doing?

358
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,082
Get off me!

359
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,384
You were shaking
everything, terra.

360
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,686
We came to check on you.

361
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,753
Are you all right?

362
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,422
It's a freaking nightmare.

363
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:53,123
Just leave me alone.

364
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,027
I'm okay, so, get going.

365
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,963
You heard me. Get going.

366
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,133
You too, greeny.

367
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,774
Does that happen a lot?

368
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,142
It happens enough.

369
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,513
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

370
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,315
And if I did see anything,
it wouldn't be your business.

371
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,685
Everything that goes on
in the tower is my business.

372
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,988
Just like it should be
for all of you.

373
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,992
The last I checked, Damien,
kori was in charge, not you.

374
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:38,202
So good to see you again,
my friends.

375
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,970
It's been too long.

376
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,108
Too long.

377
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,011
Man: Don't make this weirder
than it already is, blood.

378
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:49,647
Are you referring
to the setting?

379
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,882
I myself take strength from it.

380
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,653
The cemetery isn't a place
to be feared.

381
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,288
It's a place of renewal.

382
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,356
Man: I have no problem meeting
anywhere you want,

383
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:02,826
but I get concerned when
my employer talks to himself.

384
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,563
I talk to the dead,

385
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:11,201
for no matter how rotted the corpse,
there's always a tiny wisp of life left.

386
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,938
Sometimes enough life
to bring them back.

387
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,273
You of all people
should know that.

388
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,311
What do you want, blood?

389
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,846
I want to move everything
up by a week.

390
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,748
I've waited long enough,
deathstroke.

391
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,217
That wasn't the deal.

392
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,420
I'll double your price.

393
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,555
Is that acceptable?

394
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,992
As before, I want
all the titans.

395
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,094
Can you do it?

396
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,668
To be ready for anything,

397
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,937
you must train for everything.

398
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,840
That was the most
important lesson

399
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:52,676
instilled in me by
the warlords of okaara.

400
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,145
Them again?

401
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,547
Dude...

402
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:59,316
And so it shall be
instilled in you.

403
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,584
Let's pair off.

404
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,087
Those not fighting,
watch and learn.

405
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,221
Nightwing.

406
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,796
Shall we dance, good sir?

407
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,665
But of course, my lady.

408
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:37,388
Guess we know who's taking out
the garbage at the new place.

409
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,659
That was not
a confidence booster.

410
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:42,893
You did very well.

411
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:45,329
You lasted far longer this time.

412
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,599
I meant in training, of course.

413
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,200
He's very proficient
when we have...

414
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,268
Kori!

415
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,438
Blue beetle, raven.

416
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,792
Sorry, raven, the bug
doesn't wanna lose.

417
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,427
And you do?

418
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,839
<i>Dios mio!</i> I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

419
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:31,909
What the hell are you doing?

420
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:34,011
Ah, I'm fine.

421
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,249
But dad feels
I've disgraced myself.

422
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,317
So that's nice.

423
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,456
Beast boy, terra, you ready?

424
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,261
Right. Sorry.

425
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,932
I'll take it easy on terra.

426
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,067
I'm gonna enjoy shutting you up.

427
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,336
Only if you catch me, mama.

428
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,760
<i>Mon cherie,</i> let Garfield
give you a big hug.

429
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,828
Mmm, so soft.

430
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,297
I let you go for a little kiss.

431
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,148
Man: Kill her!

432
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,522
Now, witch, you get
what's coming to you!

433
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,024
Who you calling a witch?

434
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,167
Terra!

435
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,404
She's going to kill him!

436
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,144
Argh!

437
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,115
Terra, control yourself!

438
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,383
What?

439
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:21,018
What's going on?

440
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,857
I'm sorry, it's not my fault.

441
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,692
- Let me calm your mind.
- No!

442
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:32,496
- Don't touch me.
- It's okay terra, we understand.

443
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:33,831
Take a breath.

444
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,399
We're here for you.

445
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:39,036
Yeah. I know you didn't mean to hurt me.
I took it too far.

446
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,341
What's wrong with you people?

447
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:09,867
I know what you're going to say.
Terra needs more training.

448
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,935
No, it's something else.

449
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,470
She knows.

450
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,476
Since we talked, I have sensed
something off about terra.

451
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,478
She needs to be
watched, Grayson.

452
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,748
She needs understanding
not surveillance.

453
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,652
Terra, has her rough edges. But
Corey thinks she's worth it.

454
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,320
And I agree.

455
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,957
Making decisions with your
heart will get people killed.

456
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:05,255
It's not like I can't sense the
vibrations of someone following me.

457
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,291
Even if they are on a roof.

458
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:10,694
I know what it's like not
to fit in with the group.

459
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,930
What's wrong?

460
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:18,001
Aside from monkey boy making me melt
down, or raven staring all the time,

461
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:22,239
nightwing, acting like a den
mother, Jaime and his freako bug,

462
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:25,943
miss smiles-a-lot,
and you, my new stalker,

463
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,478
huh, nothing I guess.

464
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,449
If you need to talk

465
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,418
let us help you.

466
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,322
Such an observant,
considerate boy.

467
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,657
You would think he truly cares.

468
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:45,028
Slade? Look what hell
just spit up.

469
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,397
Stay back.

470
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:54,671
Let me guess, they got you to
a Lazarus pit, just in time.

471
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:58,308
Yes, I've been bathing in it
quite a bit, lately.

472
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,444
You might say, it's addictive.

473
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,049
Improves muscle tone too.

474
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,933
Losing your edge.

475
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:25,202
Your friends have made you soft.

476
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,382
Like I said, soft.

477
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,759
Took you long enough.

478
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,402
You betrayed us, why?

479
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,805
Betrayed?

480
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:05,242
That assumes I was ever on
your side in the first place.

481
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,290
There you go, Mr. Fernandez.

482
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,594
- Great to have your help. Thanks.
- No.

483
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:25,962
Thank you.

484
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,964
I kinda needed this.

485
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,233
This just reminds me of home.

486
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,104
- Ow! Huh, hot.
- Careful.

487
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,408
You don't wanna get burned.

488
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:42,379
Do you hear that?

489
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,781
- I heard it before.
- Uh...

490
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,283
I hope there's not a short.

491
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,452
I think I heard it
move over there.

492
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,023
I know my pulse is racing.

493
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,891
But I'm in no danger. None.

494
00:34:54,893 --> 00:35:00,797
Defensive measures are not needed.
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

495
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:04,434
There's something humans
call sexual attraction.

496
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,170
Aye, my life.

497
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,540
Uh, Jaime?

498
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,456
What are you doing?

499
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,292
I thought I'd get
more comfortable.

500
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,962
Don't.

501
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,498
You can't run over here at
the first sign of trouble.

502
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,867
I was losing it.
I had to see you.

503
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:39,136
Luckily taking Robin out works.

504
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,971
Grabs a handful.

505
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,273
Best to get him out of the way.

506
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,242
He was suspicious.

507
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:46,810
Always is.

508
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,213
Didn't say he was stupid.

509
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:53,283
He damaged the camera lens.

510
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:55,752
Greenie was asking for it.

511
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:02,659
It's taken a year to get the information
I need to defeat the titans.

512
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,896
Could've ruined everything.
Stay still.

513
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,907
Man: Kill her!
All: Kill the witch!

514
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,210
Kill the witch! She's a demon!

515
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:21,711
Kill her now!

516
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,401
Leave or die. Your choice.

517
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,343
Terra markov?

518
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,247
I heard you're a special girl.

519
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:58,882
Is that true?

520
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,551
My name is Slade.

521
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,589
Looks like I got it.

522
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,391
Not yet, you haven't.

523
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:10,860
But you could.

524
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:14,464
- We discussed this.
- I'm not a kid.

525
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:17,500
- You said we'd be together.
- Not yet.

526
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,669
The contract is everything.

527
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:22,606
We need total
concentration for it.

528
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:24,674
You know it's taken
a lot of work to get here.

529
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:27,811
- Especially by you.
- I don't wanna go back.

530
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:30,847
The titans are always
acting like they care so much.

531
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,882
It messes with my head.

532
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,619
Just a little longer, terra.

533
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:39,155
With the money from blood we'll
form our own league of assassins.

534
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:40,690
You and I.

535
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,594
Together in every way.

536
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:01,077
I didn't see you bringing quite
so many weapons to our new place.

537
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,781
- If you don't like them...
- No, no. They're great.

538
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:08,985
Is something up?

539
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,224
After the incident
at the training field

540
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:17,694
you met with members
of the team without me.

541
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:20,864
Yeah, we talked.
But it wasn't a meeting.

542
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:23,233
Kori, you know I'd never
undermine you, right?

543
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:24,768
They went to you.

544
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,305
You were... Are a great leader.

545
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:31,541
So, they instinctively look
to you, now that you're back.

546
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,712
After all, I'm not even
from your world.

547
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,784
Hey. Stop.

548
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:43,586
You were chosen
by the team to lead them.

549
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:47,490
And have I told you how glad I am that
you've chosen to move in with me?

550
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,093
At least I was your first
choice for that.

551
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:53,897
Yeah. Well, gar's got his house and
Jaime couldn't afford the rent.

552
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,932
You brat.

553
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,139
Damian! Of course.

554
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,641
Perfect timing.

555
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,846
- Solo?
- He's working on something.

556
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,881
Have I mentioned
he approves of us?

557
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,350
So do I.

558
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,626
Yeah? Problem?

559
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,562
Not yet.

560
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,565
Nice visit.

561
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,169
I know I'm not easy
to get close to.

562
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,971
We have that in common, I think.

563
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,840
But I could teach you
some meditation techniques.

564
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,641
It might help you
stay in control.

565
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,879
Maybe. Maybe so.

566
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:47,851
The other reason I'm here is to tell you
the team's assembling in the common room.

567
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,587
I need a minute.
You go on ahead.

568
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,265
They know about Robin.

569
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,466
Slade: <i>They don't.</i>

570
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,335
Raven, being nice?

571
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,337
And there's nothing scheduled.

572
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:08,805
They know I'm working with you.

573
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:11,107
If they knew,
she wouldn't have come alone.

574
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,209
<i>Unless they wanted
to get my guard down.</i>

575
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,478
I don't think I can take
them all if they're ready.

576
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,581
<i>Calm yourself.
The fools trust you.</i>

577
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,049
<i>Use that.</i>

578
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,435
All: Surprise!

579
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,807
Shit.

580
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:46,876
You guys scared me.

581
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,611
We can see that.

582
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,880
- Are those for me?
- They sure are.

583
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,650
For your one year anniversary
as a member of the titans.

584
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:56,686
- It was all raven's idea.
- I...

585
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:59,222
No one has ever done
anything like this for me.

586
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,658
Thanks.

587
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,827
Thanks a lot.

588
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:11,201
Dry those tears and let's
get this party started, mama!

589
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,931
The computer's done.

590
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:45,468
- The one with blood's files.
- Let's take a look.

591
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,872
Computer: <i>File reconstruction
and integration complete.</i>

592
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,612
That scientist used
to work for h.I.V.E.

593
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,580
Body never recovered.

594
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:00,550
Seems his personal lab
is still being paid for

595
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:03,586
by one of blood's
holding companies.

596
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,889
Starfire: The titans
should look into this.

597
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,895
Beast boy's sending you
pictures of terra's party.

598
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,367
Shame you're missing it.

599
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,037
You should go. Playing with
teenagers is about your speed.

600
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,640
I'm not gonna let
you bait me, kid.

601
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,808
Oh, what the hell.

602
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,549
Big man.

603
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:36,953
Why not get me out of here so
I can defend myself properly?

604
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:40,757
- Unless, you're afraid.
- Really?

605
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:45,595
You're down to hoping I'm gonna act
like the biggest stooge in a b-movie?

606
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:48,097
Your outfit said
"give it a shot."

607
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:53,102
Grandson of the demon's
head, you are not.

608
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,572
You're an entitled brat.

609
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:59,909
I rose from nothing while you
had everything handed to you.

610
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,612
You cost me my rightful place.

611
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:05,648
And the family you betrayed.

612
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,885
They turned on me
by choosing you.

613
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:11,321
You took my old family, Damian.

614
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,458
So I'll take your new one.

615
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,931
I should reply.

616
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,901
"I am well and will
see you soon."

617
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,073
You're more of a dick.

618
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:35,678
"Undercover. Don't bother me."

619
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,282
Shame I don't have more
time to break you down.

620
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:44,354
Inside a month, I'd have you bringing
me my pipe and calling me papa.

621
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:47,924
Terra: <i>Slade? Get your
head out of your ass.</i>

622
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,960
- You seeing this?
- And if we do find the scientist,

623
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,596
we want him alive at all cost.

624
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,331
We leave in five minutes.

625
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,772
Be a good boy.

626
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,267
Careful. Watch your spacing.

627
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,755
Beast boy: Any idea
what that gizmo is?

628
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:54,691
Nothing good.

629
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,598
He's deleting.
I vote we stop that.

630
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,133
That makes two of us.

631
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:08,004
Okay, three.

632
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,776
Step away from the computer.
You won't be hurt.

633
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,815
Go after him. I'll cover you.

634
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,865
We should have
stayed at the party.

635
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,466
Quit complaining.

636
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,110
Uh-oh!

637
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,819
Oh, you wanna play?

638
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,827
That's it? Lame.

639
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,841
What do you want
to ask him first?

640
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,957
Bad luck for him.

641
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,892
At least it wasn't one of us.

642
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,430
Yes, bad luck.

643
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:17,233
That we couldn't speak
with him about these.

644
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,371
Maybe he was a fan?

645
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,380
Is it really a surprise
they would study us?

646
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,282
We've been defeating
them for months.

647
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,751
And you were after them
even before that.

648
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:38,187
But this stuff is so in-depth.

649
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,856
Things on genetic makeup.

650
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:41,724
Theories on raven's power.

651
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:43,526
Beast boy's too.

652
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,261
And beetle's suit.

653
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,163
What's it for?

654
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:49,098
We need to get Robin back here.

655
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,967
You know how stubborn he can be.

656
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:55,104
He's a titan.
He needs to be here.

657
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:59,475
Nothing like laser-spewing h.I.V.E
drones to take you out of a party mood.

658
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:03,679
I'm beat and I'm making
lunch at the center tomorrow.

659
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,448
In more exciting news,

660
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:10,219
I've been invited to be on Kevin
Smith's podcast at metrocon tomorrow.

661
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,655
Hold up, starfire's got
something to say.

662
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,992
With what we discovered tonight,

663
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:18,194
we all need to be extra vigilant

664
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:21,130
and not take any chances.

665
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:23,432
Are you kidding me?
It's Kevin Smith.

666
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:27,203
I didn't say don't do
what you have planned.

667
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:31,207
But keep your eyes and comm
lines open at all times.

668
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:35,645
I have a feeling whatever blood is
planning tonight is just a prelude.

669
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:01,637
Sorry your party
was interrupted.

670
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,106
That's the way it goes.

671
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,842
Don't let all that talk
back there shake you up.

672
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:09,111
You know I got your back.

673
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:12,682
It's other stuff.

674
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,684
Like what?

675
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,720
I'm all ears.

676
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,558
You've a pretty smile.

677
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,630
Do you know
how I became an orphan?

678
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,700
Uh, your parents died?

679
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,269
No.

680
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:36,405
After I got powers,
they freaked.

681
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:38,607
Thought I was possessed
or something.

682
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,111
I'm sorry.

683
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,013
Don't be.

684
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,582
I don't need your pity.

685
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,355
It can be a bond, you know?

686
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,490
Everyone on the team's
had it rough.

687
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,325
Yeah.

688
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,562
I can tell Princess sparkle thong knows
all about eating from a dumpster.

689
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:03,332
Kori is a refugee being stalked
by her homicidal sister.

690
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,368
Jaime has a family
that loves him.

691
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:09,372
And, because of the bug, odds are he's
never seeing them face-to-face again.

692
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:15,878
I think pain is what
makes a hero.

693
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,149
It's like a pressure that either forms
a diamond or grinds you into dust.

694
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,554
But what about you, chuckles?

695
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:29,025
Aside from an unhealthy online
presence, you're normal.

696
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,096
Yeah, you're green.

697
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,965
You wouldn't change
it if you could.

698
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:37,767
You like the attention.

699
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:39,101
Besides

700
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:40,636
it looks okay on you.

701
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,661
Wow.

702
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,264
You didn't kill me.

703
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,533
This time.

704
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,536
Don't get used to it, jerk.

705
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,141
Yes! Yeah!

706
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:21,477
Whoo-hoo! Yeah, baby! Ha-ha!

707
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:26,215
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

708
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,752
Oh, yeah, baby!

709
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,587
Let's go!

710
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,427
Deathstroke: <i>Nice play.</i>

711
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,596
<i>Almost bought it myself.</i>

712
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,432
<i>We move tomorrow.</i>

713
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,409
I'm tired, gar.

714
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,279
Yeah, sure, totally get it.

715
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,786
See you tomorrow.
And the next day.

716
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,221
Whoo!

717
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,547
Yeah, I got them all in.

718
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:34,450
Hey, I know I'm
a noob but I got this.

719
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:37,353
See you when you
get here, Traci.

720
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,733
The guest of honor with
one million followers is...

721
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,234
Uh, here?

722
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,540
Hello?

723
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,143
Kevin? Other guy?

724
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:22,264
I think we should look over the
files again, this afternoon.

725
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:24,567
Make sure we didn't
miss anything.

726
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:25,634
Oh!

727
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:28,771
Nightwing: Sure thing.

728
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:32,741
And per your orders,
I'll check on Jaime and gar.

729
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:35,744
You don't have
to do that, but thanks.

730
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:37,413
By the way...

731
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:43,219
The warlords of okaara didn't
teach me much about cooking.

732
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:46,121
I think you should pick
something up on the way back.

733
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:47,623
<i>See you soon, babe.</i>

734
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:22,925
What's going on?

735
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,227
Not sure. It should be open.

736
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:26,595
We got a new guy.

737
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,407
Jaime?

738
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,749
Jaime?

739
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,044
Argh!

740
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,952
Titans, blue beetle
has been taken.

741
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:25,254
Gather at the tower.

742
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:30,259
Answering machine: <i>This is kori and dick.
We're not home now.</i>

743
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:32,928
<i>So leave a message.</i>

744
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:36,131
Starfire, pick up if you're there.
I'm going to get beast boy.

745
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,067
Get to the tower now.

746
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,424
Argh!

747
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,763
Oh, come on, gar.

748
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,938
Kori, you here?

749
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,079
Kori.

750
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:27,750
Argh!

751
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,487
Bad day, nightwing?

752
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,222
It's about to get worse.

753
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:35,891
What have you done
with kori and the others?

754
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,094
Don't fret.

755
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:41,029
I'm here to take you to them.

756
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,667
Bring it, asshole.

757
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,076
Akido needs work.

758
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:55,744
Your spacing's for shit.

759
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,756
You're overrated, kid.

760
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,494
Damn it.

761
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:19,668
Argh!

762
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:43,859
Argh!

763
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,532
Enough.

764
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:51,867
Screw this.

765
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,783
You could have died by the
blade with honor, Grayson.

766
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,152
Loser.

767
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,758
Deathstroke: <i>Is it done?</i>

768
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,164
Yeah, we're good.

769
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,841
Argh!

770
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,330
He's lying to you.

771
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:30,165
About everything.

772
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:32,568
He had you
pegged from the start.

773
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,703
That's how he does it.

774
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:36,572
Mixing truth with lies.

775
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:38,473
You're so freaking annoying.

776
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,309
You don't know anything
about him.

777
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:42,110
He saved me.

778
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:45,647
Let me guess,
he kept you isolated.

779
00:59:45,649 --> 00:59:47,215
Dependent.

780
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:49,685
Told you everyone
was your enemy.

781
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:52,521
Trained you, ruthlessly.

782
00:59:52,523 --> 00:59:55,324
And promised you
exactly what you wanted.

783
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,628
Believe me, I know.

784
01:00:06,737 --> 01:00:09,071
I've always hated you.

785
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:11,540
You and all the others.

786
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:14,409
The titans
treated you like family.

787
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:16,845
And you threw it all away.

788
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,749
Stop...

789
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,185
Argh.

790
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:25,821
Can't I leave you
for two minutes?

791
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:31,660
I can see why you want him dead.

792
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,016
What's wrong?

793
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,952
In a few hours, we're gone.

794
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:58,720
It's as good as done.

795
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,956
Just glad this is over.

796
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,828
You've been in deep cover
for a year.

797
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,332
It's perfectly normal
to have feelings for them.

798
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,768
But after this
we can be together.

799
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,336
Just like you wanted.

800
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,872
Concentrate on that.

801
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:44,900
Computer, track
terra markov's phone.

802
01:01:44,902 --> 01:01:47,135
Computer: <i>Discovered,
subject is moving.</i>

803
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,304
I'll bet she is.

804
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,777
Brother blood: <i>Brothers and
sisters, I have spoken many times</i>

805
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:57,713
<i>about false gods.</i>

806
01:01:57,715 --> 01:02:02,250
<i>These so-called heroes with
no allegiance to our cause,</i>

807
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:06,354
<i>are nothing but secular idols
and must be ended.</i>

808
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:12,194
<i>This is the true house of faith
and I am the one true god.</i>

809
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:16,298
Hail brother blood. Hail, hail!

810
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,102
<i>Today, I am claiming
their powers for us all.</i>

811
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:23,872
<i>For we are the seeds
of the next generation.</i>

812
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:26,775
<i>We are the hive of humanity.</i>

813
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:29,578
<i>And nothing
will stand in our way.</i>

814
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,646
<i>Raise me this holy day.</i>

815
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:33,849
<i>The day of blood.</i>

816
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:36,118
Crowd: <i>Hail brother blood.
Hail...</i>

817
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,420
Place gives me the creeps.

818
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:39,788
I hear you.

819
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,324
Ugh...

820
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:46,495
Huh? Guys, raven's not moving.

821
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:49,798
Something's keeping me
from using my powers to morph.

822
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,900
Yeah, the machine's doing that.

823
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:53,969
But, I'm the one
who put you here.

824
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,304
Deathstroke.

825
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,508
What have you done to Robin?

826
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:02,410
I beat the crap out of him
for being mouthy.

827
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,581
Come on,
you've all had the urge.

828
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:10,118
Once I get out, I'm gonna
break you into little bits.

829
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,121
It's good to have goals, <i>ese.</i>

830
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:17,025
Me, I'm having waffles,
after you're dead.

831
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,731
By the way, can I introduce
you to my assistant?

832
01:03:22,733 --> 01:03:24,299
I think you've met.

833
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:29,137
Hey, team, how's things?

834
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,973
Terra, what did he do to you?

835
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:35,310
Nothing. And I've asked
a bunch of times.

836
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,346
Terra was a key part of my plan.

837
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:40,348
A natural double agent.

838
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,983
That can't be true.

839
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,019
What can I tell you, goldilocks.

840
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:46,288
You win some, you lose some.

841
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,355
We took you in.

842
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:48,623
Helped you.

843
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:50,458
Yeah, well, thanks.

844
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,027
Now you're gonna die.

845
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,965
Geez, not a lot of
gray area there, huh.

846
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,039
Terra...

847
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,080
Place reminds me
of my parents' church.

848
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:46,581
Bunch of crazies.

849
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,083
Insolent trash.

850
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:50,185
Who you calling trash?

851
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,387
Keep it together.

852
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:57,959
Let's be civil to our guests.

853
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,929
Our business
is not yet complete.

854
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:02,931
Sure it is.

855
01:05:02,933 --> 01:05:05,867
You wanted the titans,
and here they are.

856
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:07,702
Not all of them.

857
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:09,771
Not nightwing.

858
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:12,540
It ruins the machine's symmetry.

859
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:15,844
We agreed some deaths
might be unavoidable.

860
01:05:15,846 --> 01:05:17,045
Things happen.

861
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,747
I accept that.

862
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:22,250
But I told you even in death
there is life to be drawn.

863
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:25,954
Where is the body? Unless you
have a body, you're one short.

864
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:31,660
Therefore, our contract
is not complete.

865
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:36,331
Happily there is still a path
to the salvation of our deal.

866
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:37,532
Don't you agree?

867
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:43,338
Excellent.

868
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,572
Mayhem.

869
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:47,108
Argh.

870
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,545
Terra!

871
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:53,548
Ugh.

872
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,151
Oh...

873
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,625
I should have charged more.

874
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:06,294
With her powers,
you're getting an upgrade.

875
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,904
Amen.

876
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:19,174
Now, our business is complete.

877
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:27,015
Slade, help me.

878
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:35,023
Sorry, kid.
But a contract is a contract.

879
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:37,325
You'll pay for this.

880
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,061
Oh, it's a shame
you have to go, sweet cheeks.

881
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:42,464
We would have been
fantastic lovers.

882
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:45,367
You know,
since we're both newly single.

883
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,344
Let it begin!

884
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,741
You think yourself
a holy man, blood?

885
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:28,009
You're filth.

886
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:29,844
Take heart, sinner.

887
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:33,348
You are about to become
part of the greater good.

888
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,817
We're gonna show you
the greater good.

889
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:37,752
By kicking your ass.

890
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:48,396
No god is going to
save you, deathstroke.

891
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,300
Word to the wise, blood,

892
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:55,270
whatever you're gonna
do to them, do it quickly.

893
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:19,861
Not feeling so good.

894
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:24,466
I consider their pain a retribution
for their sins against me.

895
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,367
Right.

896
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,636
Have a nice day.

897
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:34,342
Oh, don't leave now, brother.
Everyone stays for this part.

898
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:37,345
What part is that, brother?

899
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:45,019
When their powers are transferred
and I ascend to god state.

900
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:51,359
Hail me, brethren, for the moment
of ascendency has arrived.

901
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:54,529
Hail, brother blood. Hail, hail.

902
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:57,799
Hail, brother blood. Hail, hail.

903
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,400
Hail, brother blood. Hail...

904
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:04,906
Yes, my children, this vessel
shall now transform me...

905
01:09:04,908 --> 01:09:08,643
And you are witness.

906
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,179
Hail, brother blood. Hail, hail.

907
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,616
I feel it.

908
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:17,152
Yes!

909
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:20,922
My godhood is nearly complete.

910
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:23,258
Praise him.

911
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:27,028
All hail brother blood.

912
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,730
Hail, hail.

913
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,374
Yes...

914
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,717
I knew you'd come.

915
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,687
Hey, papa, here's your pipe.

916
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:04,792
Argh.

917
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,396
Save some for me.

918
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:08,349
Don't you know, I am the chosen?

919
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,986
Don't you know, I am divine...

920
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,434
I'm gonna kill you.

921
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:35,042
I was being studied,
like all the rest, wasn't I?

922
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:38,112
You planned this
right from the start.

923
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:39,480
Calm down.

924
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:42,083
This is all
a big misunderstanding, love.

925
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:43,518
Terra, no.

926
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,100
Oh, shit.

927
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,540
You heathen brats.

928
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:08,042
You've destroyed my holy temple.

929
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,545
Argh.

930
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:16,984
You've robbed me of my destiny.

931
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:18,619
You will die.

932
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,124
You cannot harm...

933
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:35,837
No, you stay away from me.

934
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,339
You demon filth.

935
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:39,774
They're not demons.

936
01:14:39,776 --> 01:14:41,209
Let me show you one.

937
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,083
What the hell?

938
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,319
I planned so long.

939
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:29,090
I was destined, can't you see?

940
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:32,126
Please, I beseech you.

941
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:34,962
I am blood.

942
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,163
I...

943
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,202
I am...

944
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,740
Saved.

945
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:49,911
I won't let them cage you,
my love.

946
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,280
Come on.

947
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:24,278
Argh!

948
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,194
So long, kid.

949
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:57,311
Terra...

950
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,282
I'm sorry.

951
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,619
No, terra...

952
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:29,644
- No...
- We have to go. The place is gonna collapse.

953
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:30,978
Terra!

954
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:56,303
So, let me ask you this, man, how
do you become a titan exactly?

955
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:59,273
I mean, is there an audition?
Do you look at videos?

956
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:01,942
'Cause I've been working
out, you know, I want in.

957
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:05,212
Beast boy: <i>Well, kev, I guess the most
important thing to being a titan,</i>

958
01:18:05,214 --> 01:18:07,848
<i>is to have
a strong sense of family.</i>

959
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:14,422
<i>Some of us don't have our own,
so, we support the ones that do.</i>

960
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:40,414
Of course, an outgoing personality
does hurt but, you know,

961
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:41,649
you gotta have a power.

962
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:43,617
Something cool.

963
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:47,254
Something cool? Listen, you turn into
animals, man, that's beyond cool.

964
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:47,254
Thanks.

965
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:50,925
<i>But, it's not just about
the cool super powers,</i>

966
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:53,828
<i>snazzy uniforms
and daring adventures.</i>

967
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:56,997
It's about us
helping each other grow.

968
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:58,799
Be better people.

969
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:10,711
Kevin: <i>Listen, I know you're not supposed
to talk about this, but I just gotta ask.</i>

970
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:13,147
<i>There's a new girl, right?</i>

971
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:16,784
Beast boy: <i>All I can say is that she's
a wonderful addition to the team.</i>

972
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:20,121
<i>- Come on, gar...
- Starfire would kill me.</i>

973
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:23,924
Kevin: <i>There's no way starfire is listening
to this, man, she's brushing her hair.</i>

974
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,698
Forget it. My lips are sealed.

975
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,068
Whoa, man, he just turned into
a seal, folks, I swear.

976
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:37,371
But really, gar, is she gonna,
like, replace terra?

977
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,573
Terra?

978
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:42,476
Yeah, you know, there are lots
of stories about her.

979
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,145
I know.

980
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,781
Ooh, too soon?

981
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,750
Yeah.

982
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:51,285
I mean, that's cool honestly,
if you don't wanna...

983
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,788
But, I'd like
to say something...

984
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,957
<i>There are a lot of people who've
been handed a rough life.</i>

985
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,393
<i>They never asked for it, but...</i>

986
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,562
<i>They do what they can.</i>

987
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,000
<i>Many of them
can't rise above the hurt.</i>

988
01:20:06,002 --> 01:20:07,401
<i>It's just too hard.</i>

989
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,873
<i>But in the end,
when the chips were down,</i>

990
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:17,244
<i>and she finally showed
her true self,</i>

991
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:22,249
<i>terra markov was like a diamond.</i>

992
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:25,152
<i>Most beautiful thing
that I'd ever seen.</i>

993
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,092
Brother blood:
<i>I talk to the dead.</i>

994
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:54,094
<i>For no matter
how rotted the corpse,</i>

995
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:57,631
<i>there's always
a tiny wisp of life left.</i>
