1
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,371
Jeez, this is terrible.

2
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:37,508
It's the stupidest.
I can't--

3
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:41,987
It's an hour's difference.
The time zone is different here.

4
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,584
Fuck. It's unbelievable.
How the fuck can that happen?

5
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,150
Okay. Here.

6
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:50,492
Okay, there. That's done.
Now what?

7
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:51,895
Okay. Got it. Okay.

8
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:53,455
Pull it up.

9
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,967
Okay, now let's get your...

10
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,373
A few years ago, we wanted to...

11
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:11,042
try to help out with some activist's
anti-corporate activities.

12
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,281
And we heard about this website
called rtmark.com.

13
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:16,584
And we went there, and they--

14
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:19,489
they handed us a domain name--
gwbush.com--

15
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,686
and asked us if we might like
to make a website

16
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:23,821
that was critical of George Bush.

17
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:27,628
Because George Bush's real
domain name was georgewbush.com.

18
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:31,296
And this was 1999,
so it was just during the campaign

19
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,498
when he was beginning
to run for president.

20
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:36,167
And we didn't really know
quite what to do,

21
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:38,575
so we went to Bush's website
and looked at it.

22
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:41,375
And it turned out to be full
of strange hypocrisies, like,

23
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:44,508
for example, he called himself
"The environmental governor of Texas,"

24
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:47,678
but we looked a little closer
at his record and found out

25
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:51,212
that he had actually created
the most polluted state in the country

26
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,089
because he dismantled
the Clean Air Laws while he was there.

27
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:56,891
And, actually, that's, I guess,
what he's doing now nationally.

28
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:59,158
So we thought,
"Well, this kind of hypocrisy

29
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:02,395
we can easily poke fun at
by making a satire website."

30
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,199
And we made this satire website
that looked exactly like Bush's

31
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,604
except for a few key differences.

32
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:10,165
Like there was a photo on the banner--

33
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:14,976
instead of him and his wife
in front of the capitol building in Texas,

34
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:17,915
we showed him pointing the finger
at black people.

35
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,579
And this seemed to get him
a little bit angry.

36
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:23,589
So the Bush campaign
tried to shut us down

37
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:25,648
by sending us
a cease and desist letter

38
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:28,125
and by complaining
to the Federal Election Commission.

39
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:30,459
But we were able
to just take those threats

40
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,964
and send them to the media.

41
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,092
And immediately the <i>New York Times</i>
wrote an article,

42
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:37,102
and there were a whole bunch
of other articles.

43
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,832
In fact, one reporter
read these articles and,

44
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:42,238
at a press conference,
asked Bush,

45
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:45,904
"So, what about this website--
gwbush.com--what do you think of that?"

46
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,268
So it was all over the place.

47
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:13,931
A lot of people read about it,

48
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:18,000
including a guy who had another
domain name called gatt.org.

49
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:21,241
And, of course, GATT is the
Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,

50
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:24,477
and it's the predecessor agreement
to the World Trade Organization.

51
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:26,951
And he said,
"If you could do this for Bush,

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,955
then maybe you can
also do this for the WTO."

53
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:36,491
The WTO is supposed to be
sort of a United Nations of commerce,

54
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:40,727
a conglomeration
of all these countries in the world...

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,395
that get together every now and then
to discuss trade policies

56
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:50,239
in how exactly goods will be bought
and sold throughout the world.

57
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,076
I'm sure, originally,
the stated purpose of the WTO

58
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:57,878
was to help these countries
who are developing

59
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:02,479
so that, you know, the world community
can help raise them out of poverty.

60
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:05,787
In fact, what it's done is
it's allowed large corporations

61
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:09,351
to go in and exploit these people
even further

62
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,296
so that Americans
become even wealthier

63
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:16,699
and the people in these countries
continue to struggle to get by.

64
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:22,402
And I think that's--
at this point it's upset quite a few people.

65
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:40,458
So I gotta try
and remember where Sal lives.

66
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:45,362
It's a little bit complicated. There's, like,
this snaking road up over the hills.

67
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,263
And who is Sal?

68
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:51,202
Sal is a friend who I met in San Diego,

69
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:55,002
and he moved to L.A.
to work in the movie industry,

70
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:59,239
and that's why now he does,
actually, costuming professionally.

71
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,473
He builds, like, weird suits

72
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:04,813
out of pretty much
any material you can imagine.

73
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:08,183
And so, when we needed a costume,
I knew who to call.

74
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,129
Yeah, this is it. Yeah.

75
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:26,838
I'll maybe bring him his mail, actually,
as long as we're at it here.

76
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,268
- Yeah--I don't like it.
- Okay.

77
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:34,245
It looks too much like sex stuff
instead of--it's not very modern-looking.

78
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:37,715
Remember, this is the future.
This isn't about, like, straps and stuff.

79
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:40,150
That's like dungeons and torture
in the past.

80
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,553
The costume
is a manager's leisure suit.

81
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:46,285
And the idea is that Hank Hardy Unruh,

82
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,919
the representative
from the World Trade Organization,

83
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:52,897
is going to go and wear
this breakaway business suit

84
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,456
that's gonna be pulled off of him

85
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:57,128
during the middle
of the keynote address to the conference.

86
00:05:57,203 --> 00:06:01,435
And then a big inflatable phallus
is going to emerge from this golden suit,

87
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:03,442
and on the end of it is a TV screen

88
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,775
that he uses
to manage sweatshops remotely.

89
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:10,107
The reason we got invited
to these things

90
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:12,413
is we have a website
called gatt.org.

91
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:16,285
The gatt.org website looks a lot
like the WTO website,

92
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:19,519
but it is critical of the WTO.

93
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:21,753
Most people, though,
who find gatt.org

94
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:25,320
by searching
for the World Trade Organization...

95
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:28,890
will go without reading it
and will send us e-mail directly.

96
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:32,768
So a lot of people ask us
weird questions about tariffs and trade,

97
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,239
and we try to answer
as accurately as we can.

98
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:37,367
And occasionally invitations come in

99
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:41,175
from official
or quasi-official organizations

100
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:44,648
asking for opinions
or asking us to attend a conference.

101
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:48,381
And so, when they ask, they really think
they're talking to the WTO,

102
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:52,516
and we respond by giving them
what we think they want--

103
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:54,992
which is the opinions of the WTO--

104
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,222
as accurately
as we can represent them.

105
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:59,959
You know what I'm thinking,
actually, looking at this...

106
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:03,227
is that maybe this is a zipper.

107
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:04,361
Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

108
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:07,167
Then he just unzips it
and pulls the thing at the same time.

109
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,105
- That could be really good.
- Because...

110
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:13,168
to have it burst out of the Velcro,
it might not be strong enough to burst out,

111
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,941
and then he'd have to pull it.

112
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,213
Part of the thing
that gives us the courage

113
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:23,347
to go to Tampere...
with this really absurd suit

114
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:26,415
is that we already went
to Salzburg, Austria, to represent

115
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:30,486
the World Trade Organization
at a conference on tariffs and trade.

116
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:35,762
There, our representative--the same guy
who is Hank Hardy Unruh here--

117
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:38,770
was Dr. Andreas Bichlbauer there.

118
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:40,772
And he gave a lecture that focused

119
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,675
on basically doing away with
all customs in the name of free trade,

120
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:49,306
like getting rid of the <i>siesta</i>
in Spain and Italy

121
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:52,112
so that business hours
could be the same.

122
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:55,313
In Italy, on the other hand,
you have a totally different situation,

123
00:07:55,388 --> 00:08:01,054
in which sleep is...done during
the day as much as at night almost.

124
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:05,860
And allowing people to sell their votes
over the Internet to the highest bidder

125
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:10,665
so that the barriers to free trade
and things like votes were out of the way.

126
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:14,673
One possible solution is being tested
in the field of American politics

127
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:19,508
to streamline the grotesquely
inefficient system of elections.

128
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:24,573
Vote-auction.com, in turn,
employs only four people

129
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:27,085
to transmit not merely information,

130
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:30,782
but actual money
directly to the consuming voter.

131
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:37,854
It's a--a forum for people voluntarily
to offer their vote to the highest bidder.

132
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,865
And despite giving what we thought

133
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:43,266
was a lecture that would immediately
get us booed off stage

134
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:46,169
or get Bichlbauer
maybe even thrown in jail

135
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,639
because people would figure out
he was an impostor,

136
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,300
the exact opposite happened.

137
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,037
Everybody was super polite.

138
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:57,242
It didn't seem like everybody even noticed
that what he said was so absurd.

139
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:20,269
Well, so far...

140
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,700
...we thought Bichlbauer
would be very extreme

141
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:27,769
and people would react to it
and we'd get shut down,

142
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,247
and nothing of the sort happened.

143
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:34,650
So...this time we just have to really
push it and make it totally extreme.

144
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,053
I mean, we keep trying
to push things further

145
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:43,062
to try to really clarify the positions
of the WTO to make them very legible.

146
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,597
It's one back,
but this--this is good.

147
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:56,798
<i>Andy.</i>

148
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,535
It has a terrible siren.

149
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,110
I have to check the Web
when we get upstairs.

150
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:10,121
Oh, my God. What are we
gonna do about this--

151
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,623
we gotta watch the Patrick video.

152
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,524
It's weird stuff, isn't it?

153
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:18,524
That's one way of putting it.

154
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:20,259
It's really a problem.

155
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,599
It seems about the weirdest
I've seen from him ever, I think.

156
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,871
It looks pretty good on this.

157
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,038
Yeah, it's all right.

158
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:39,109
What we have here is that we have
our cyber Andy here

159
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:42,120
who's going to be wearing the suit.

160
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:45,783
And I'm going to be showing
all the different ways

161
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:50,693
in which the Management Leisure Suit
can be useful in industry today

162
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:54,927
and maximize leisure potential.

163
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:59,634
Sometimes I don't think they know
what the hell to expect out of me.

164
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,103
What I'll come up with...

165
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:09,240
is frequently not exactly
what they had in mind,

166
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:12,580
but it's...you know,

167
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:16,816
it fits in perfectly with what they're--
what they're going to do.

168
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,955
Well, I came out
of a corporate environment

169
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:25,760
and a company that I really gave,
you know, a good bit of my soul to

170
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:28,232
over a long period of time progressively.

171
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:31,429
And there were a lot of downsizings
and, of course,

172
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:35,099
the company I was with I thought
was gonna take care of me.

173
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:38,007
And I realized
that the bottom line is the bottom line,

174
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:42,480
and there really isn't any humanity
in corporate structures,

175
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:46,882
so therefore I hope that maybe
being part of the Yes Men

176
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:51,686
might, in some way, help raise issues
about global work issues

177
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:56,422
and social issues that are being
brought about by globalization, etcetera.

178
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,157
I grew up in the suburbs here,

179
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:07,537
and then I moved to Troy six years ago
for a job at the university.

180
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:11,976
There's a place there called Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, and I teach there.

181
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,377
I was moving back home, really,
because I'd been away--

182
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:17,416
I'd been on the West Coast
for about 12 years.

183
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:18,643
Wait, what is this?

184
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,050
This is--it's this...

185
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,022
...SimCopter hack.
Here it is.

186
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:27,889
I wanted to watch this tape
'cause this is the tape--

187
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,726
I've been cleaning out the archives,
and I found this tape in there.

188
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:34,892
I met Andy through a friend, actually.
A mutual friend.

189
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:38,130
Actually, two people
that we both knew

190
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:41,173
suggested that me and Andy
get in contact with one another

191
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,572
because we'd both
done similar projects.

192
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:47,977
One of the jobs that I had was
at this games company called Maxis

193
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:49,776
that makes SimCity.

194
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:54,513
One of the games they were making
at the time was SimCopter.

195
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:57,420
I was in charge of the little people
that run around in the game.

196
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,948
And I made them
wearing nothing but swim trunks.

197
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:04,428
They'd all be boys, and they'd
be running around kissing each other.

198
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:08,092
So all the people who ordered
this very popular video game

199
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:12,331
suddenly were treated
to a completely different spectacle.

200
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,600
So he got a lot
of press attention for it,

201
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:18,166
and it was seen as a kind of--
an activist kind of statement

202
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:21,680
about video games and the sort
of macho nature of them.

203
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:23,681
It all involves
the unexpected appearance

204
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:27,150
of some gay, kissing muscle men
every Friday the 13th.

205
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,053
He's becoming a celebrity of sorts
in the computer world--

206
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:32,182
especially the gay computer world.

207
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:35,523
And then I had done a project
using Barbie dolls,

208
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:39,031
where we switched the voice boxes
of Barbie dolls and G.I. Joes.

209
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:43,262
<i>Troops! Attack that Cobra jet</i>
<i>with heavy firepower!</i>

210
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:48,998
And that ended up in G.I. Joes that
said things like, "I love to shop with you,"

211
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:53,068
and Barbie dolls that said things like,
"Dead men tell no lies."

212
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:56,240
And we got them back
on store shelves

213
00:13:56,315 --> 00:14:00,183
all over the country in what we called
our "Shop Giving Program."

214
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:02,084
We're like Santa Claus,
only less radical,

215
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:04,715
because Santa Claus
breaks into people's houses. We don't.

216
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,156
So that when kids
got them at Christmas,

217
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,955
they were surprised to find their doll

218
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:11,360
saying something other
than what they expected.

219
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,423
And the kids thought it was hilarious.
They loved having these crazy dolls.

220
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:16,991
We sent out press releases,

221
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:21,130
so it was in the news on Christmas Day
and for the week following.

222
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:26,008
It just went through every kind
of media channel imaginable.

223
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,842
<i>- The B.L.O...</i>
<i>- The Mission of the B.L.O...</i>

224
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:32,146
<i>The Barbie Liberation Organization--</i>
<i>the B.L.O...</i>

225
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:36,814
<i>It was real funny 'cause it looks</i>
<i>like, "Come on, fight me. Fight me!"</i>

226
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,619
<i>- Except it says...</i>
<i>- I love school. Don't you?</i>

227
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,023
<i>Let's sing with the band tonight!</i>

228
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:42,754
Now we're--with the Yes Men,

229
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:46,559
we're calling that sort of basic idea
"Identity Correction,"

230
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,361
like saying, these things--

231
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,699
these things that are not
really presenting themselves honestly

232
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:55,434
or that hide something about their nature
that's really scary,

233
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:56,839
we want to bring that out.

234
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,241
We want to show that.
We want to demonstrate that.

235
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,145
And so, like for the WTO--

236
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:04,046
we think that the WTO

237
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,778
is doing all these terrible things
that are hurting people

238
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:08,843
and they're saying the exact opposite.

239
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,913
And so we're interested
in correcting their identity.

240
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:15,483
In the same way that an identity thief
steals somebody's identity

241
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:19,395
in order to basically
just engage in criminal practices,

242
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:21,797
we target people
we see as criminals,

243
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,461
and we steal their identity
to try to make them honest

244
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:26,801
or to try to present
a more honest face.

245
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:29,864
And so...you know,
I guess this whole thing

246
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:32,433
has its roots for both me and Andy

247
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,843
in stuff that we've been doing
for a long time,

248
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:38,577
which is trying to create public spectacles
that, in some kind of poetic way,

249
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:43,179
reveal something about our culture
that's profoundly a problem.

250
00:15:58,371 --> 00:15:59,736
That must be Sal.

251
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,006
- Oh, dude.
- Are you okay?

252
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,067
I got fuckin' lost on that...

253
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,476
Oh, no.

254
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,005
It's been a long day.

255
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,482
Holy shit!

256
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:18,723
Well, I probably started it
in June or July.

257
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:23,124
So, on and off
for a good two to three months.

258
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:27,131
Just a couple more pieces
of Velcro, and that'll really be it.

259
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,691
And, yeah, we're...
at the end of the line.

260
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,767
Okay, look.
So we're making a list here.

261
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:38,571
Wednesday we leave
for Finland early,

262
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:41,511
so, Sunday...

263
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,911
make lecture.

264
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,916
Bigger?
Oh, no. That's a big one.

265
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:51,150
PowerPoint...
and then speech.

266
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:52,281
Finish.

267
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:11,070
It's 4:03 a.m., and I guess
I'll just keep working until morning.

268
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:13,475
I feel...somewhat awake.

269
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:16,538
And then Andy can take over again.

270
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:21,475
We can do
around-the-clock shifts, I guess.

271
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:28,090
I'm just trying to add a few slides
into the PowerPoint here.

272
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:34,690
Because, actually, a lot of the things
that business leaders of the world

273
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:39,170
say in relation to these issues
are actually sort of very similar

274
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:40,899
to what Unruh Hank Hardy says,

275
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:44,875
even though maybe Unruh Hank Hardy
is a little bit more frank about it.

276
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:47,970
And, in fact,
when he talked to CNBC,

277
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:49,378
when he was debating,

278
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:52,440
an activist, Barry Coates,
just sort of agreed with what he said

279
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:56,352
when he said that this is what
the WTO does, and this is our position.

280
00:17:56,422 --> 00:18:01,086
And Barry Coates said,
"Well, that's funny. That's exactly right."

281
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:09,090
So...after Salzburg, we got an e-mail
asking a representative of the WTO

282
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:12,228
to appear on CNBC
MarketWrap Europe.

283
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:18,971
And the producer apparently didn't notice
that gatt.org was not the WTO site.

284
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:25,347
And Granwyth Hulatberi, which is
another name that Andy just came up with,

285
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:28,012
responded and, of course, said,

286
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:31,579
"Well, I'd be happy to go
on CNBC MarketWrap."

287
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:37,493
And the producer wanted him to debate
an anti-globalization protester.

288
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:43,661
If the WTO is serious about addressing
the issues of world poverty,

289
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:47,228
it would do things
completely differently than it is now.

290
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:50,901
Let me bring in Granwyth on that.
Is that a fair point?

291
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:56,480
Well, of course it is, but I think Barry,
as well as all the other protesters,

292
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:01,646
are simply, in a word, focused too much
on reality and on facts and figures.

293
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,212
And I think I would have to say
that this is a long-term problem

294
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,782
that comes down
to a problem of education.

295
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,354
We have to find a way to convince
perhaps not the protesters

296
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,262
but the protesters' children

297
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:20,067
to follow thinkers like Milton Friedman
and Darwin and--and so on,

298
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:23,074
rather than what the protesters
have been reared on--

299
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:26,202
Trotsky and Robespierre
and Abbie Hoffman.

300
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:30,271
And I think that putting
the direction of education,

301
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:33,079
being put into private hands--

302
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:36,246
a concentration of resources
in the private sector--

303
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:38,483
will naturally lead to this result,

304
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:41,048
and we'll see
the protesters' children being reared

305
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,617
with an entirely different
set of concerns.

306
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,357
Let me bring you in on that, Barry.

307
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:47,092
Can--can I just say

308
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,361
that these kind of simplistic arguments

309
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:53,098
are really, I mean, too insulting
to most people to believe.

310
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:56,903
The fact that we have a choice between
Milton Friedman or Abbie Hoffman

311
00:19:56,976 --> 00:20:00,377
for where we get our source
of economic history and philosophy.

312
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:03,438
There are many, many thinkers
from around the world--

313
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:06,007
just not those ones
employed by the WTO--

314
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:09,953
that think the World Trade Organization
policies are deeply damaging

315
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:12,684
for the development prospects
of the poorest countries.

316
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,419
Let me go out to Granwyth.

317
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:21,558
Yes. Well, I wanted to speak
to Granwyth--sorry--to Barry's point

318
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,124
that there are other thinkers.

319
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:27,468
Well, who actually has the power
in the world, and so who is correct

320
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,201
in this kind of world view?

321
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,607
I mean, I think the answer is easy.

322
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:35,511
And if you look at the views
held by myself, my organization,

323
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:39,244
and many, many
of the decision-makers in the world--

324
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:43,311
the powerful people--they happen
to coincide with what I'm explaining.

325
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:46,881
And I think this is enough
in this sort of view.

326
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,119
Briefly, Barry.

327
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:49,990
So, I mean--what we have here

328
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:53,657
is a picture of the rich and powerful people
believe a certain philosophy

329
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:57,065
which they then propound
through the institutions

330
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:58,728
in which they have a powerful voice.

331
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:02,205
And I think this is exactly the model
that is being questioned.

332
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:07,211
And, increasingly, what there is
is a very large body

333
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,611
of people who are concerned
about these rules.

334
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,742
The people on the streets
of Genoa and Seattle

335
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:15,286
are not representative
of the overall movement.

336
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:16,946
They are the tip of the iceberg.

337
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:20,856
We did a study last year
that looked across developing countries

338
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:24,020
and found that in the space
of one year, in 50 protests,

339
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,929
more than a million people
from developing countries

340
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:29,661
were out trying to change the rules

341
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:32,465
that were being imposed on them
by the World Bank and the IMF

342
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:35,200
and locked down
through the World Trade Organization.

343
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:38,141
Thank you. We must finish.
Barry Coates, thank you for joining us.

344
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,044
And also Granwyth Hulatberi and
Vernon Ellis on the line from New York.

345
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:10,206
Section three?

346
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:14,572
Well...

347
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:17,980
It's not exactly a garment bag,
but it's, uh...

348
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:20,349
...it'll work.

349
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:25,150
Yeah? You think this
is very business-like?

350
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:26,885
It's like very official?

351
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:29,018
Very...very big money.

352
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:32,894
Okay, good. That's what I need.
I need a big money watch.

353
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:38,697
So are you as nervous
as you were for Salzburg?

354
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:41,171
The thing is, like,
even with the Salzburg thing,

355
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,970
we went into it, like...

356
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:47,843
sort of--we went there really nervous,
but the whole time kind of--

357
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:50,575
it doesn't really sink in
till you're actually there.

358
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:51,775
Right.

359
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,251
Well, I think it's good you guys,
from what I've seen of the speech,

360
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,721
it kind of starts out
the most normal that it is,

361
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,282
so that he can get comfortable,
and people--

362
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,524
he can sort of slowly
work his way up into it.

363
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:09,257
Son of a fucking bitch.

364
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,501
Shit.

365
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:16,633
Yeah, do you have a rag? Fuck.

366
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:21,474
Shit. I have one that has shoe polish
on it, but that's not right, right?

367
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:26,715
- The screen get a little paint on it?
- Yeah.

368
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,652
- It sounds like a lawn mower.
- It's a little loud, yeah.

369
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:40,328
- That's not good.
- Forget it.

370
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:53,305
Look, it made a new noise.
Good. Good. Good. Great.

371
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,970
- Is it great?
- Try it.

372
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,639
It doesn't work now.

373
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,546
- Oh, listen! Yeah.
- There it goes!

374
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:00,782
Gotta hurry!

375
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,863
Okay, ten minutes.
They're both here.

376
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:19,827
Hey, Sal.

377
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:22,131
Thanks.

378
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:25,136
Good luck.

379
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:28,309
- We'll see how it goes.
- Thanks for everything.

380
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,974
Yeah, sleep good.
Have a good time here.

381
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,611
- Enjoy.
- See you soon.

382
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:36,210
Move into my room.
Have enjoyment.

383
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:37,448
Okay.

384
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:43,158
Is this everything?
Wow. Look how efficient.

385
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:44,388
Okay.

386
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:48,664
Efficient.
A model of efficiency right here.

387
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:55,240
You have some crap on your face
right here. No, over here.

388
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:58,133
Much better.

389
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:32,407
We arrived last night.

390
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:34,809
You had to take a nap.
You had to get some sleep.

391
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,211
I just crashed, yeah.

392
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:40,115
And I went and basically
scoped out the lecture site.

393
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:43,586
There was a sign on the door
that said, "Textiles of the Future,"

394
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:47,591
Unruh Hank Hardy was
the first speaker--Hank Hardy Unruh.

395
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:50,059
And, you know,
it all looked sort of official.

396
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:52,790
The coffee cups were out
for the morning.

397
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:54,856
So I thought,
"This is great. I'm all ready.

398
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,094
I know exactly where it is.
We can go there."

399
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:59,569
I had a time--
I set up a little timetable,

400
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:03,836
I got maps of the thing and all
the updated conference information.

401
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,940
Came back here.
Then we went to sleep early.

402
00:26:08,013 --> 00:26:13,007
Hank was snoring immediately,
but I wasn't able to sleep at all, really.

403
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:14,780
I just stayed there awake in bed

404
00:26:14,853 --> 00:26:18,516
and occasionally I'd go in the bathroom
and turn on the light and read brochures

405
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,491
because I was, like,
just unable to sleep.

406
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,893
And eventually I think I fell asleep
just before waking up.

407
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:29,894
Great.

408
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:35,401
So I'm leaving my wallet here.

409
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:40,234
Okay, let's go.

410
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,510
- Wait.
- It's 8:00.

411
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:47,575
I think I really will leave it here.

412
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:54,924
Are you coming?

413
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,922
Hank, this is a little early
to get up.

414
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:06,499
- It's all right.
- I mean, I thought this was a vacation.

415
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:08,232
- Like what?
- A vacation.

416
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:09,706
I know.

417
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,437
- I wanna go on a vacation.
- They take me to Finland...

418
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:20,682
Let me take care of this egg for you.
I'll just peel it.

419
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:22,413
That'll be nice. Thank you.

420
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,783
- But we're behind schedule.
- Are we?

421
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:35,026
A little bit. It's after 8:00, and I really
wanted to be at the venue at 8:00.

422
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,761
- Okay.
- But we're doing fine.

423
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:38,996
- Is it after 8:00?
- It is after 8:00.

424
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:40,231
Yeah.

425
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:44,969
You know, pretend like...

426
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,383
Great. We're early.

427
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:57,615
Oh, good.

428
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:03,025
Hello, I'm Hank Hardy Unruh.
I'm from the--

429
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:05,495
- Oh, right. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

430
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:07,725
- We were expecting you.
- Oh, good.

431
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,428
It's not 9:30--no.
It's 8:30, right?

432
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:16,071
- But you will have a...
- It's 8:30 now...is it?

433
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:20,475
lt...is...it's 9:30, yes.

434
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:21,876
- Now?
- Yes.

435
00:28:21,947 --> 00:28:24,108
- Yeah.
- The time is 9:30?

436
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:25,581
- Yes.
- Yeah. Almost.

437
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,380
- I'm on at...
- It's 27 past 9:00 at the moment.

438
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:30,944
Oh, my God.
We're an hour off.

439
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:33,014
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

440
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:36,458
- Well, we have to--we start in three--
- Anyhow, it was nice to see you.

441
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,462
Do they know
that he's going on now?

442
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,124
Yeah--well,
...was expecting you.

443
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:43,258
- Oh, jeez. Okay.
- Okay, we...

444
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:48,667
Are you coming, too?
Have you registered?

445
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:53,166
I'm his assistant.
We're both working with him.

446
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:55,736
We have to go take care
of a few things now.

447
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,543
- Here it is.
- Okay.

448
00:28:57,616 --> 00:29:00,608
- Would you like to join the dinner?
- Yes, please.

449
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:03,279
- Is there a fee, or...
- No, it's included.

450
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:06,620
Okay. Yes, we'll--
we'll join the dinner. That's great.

451
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:09,357
- Wow.
- We must hurry, I guess.

452
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:12,022
- Yes. I will accompany you.
- Please. Yes.

453
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:15,696
Actually, no, you can't go in now

454
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,099
'cause you first have
to take care of that business.

455
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,662
We're an hour--we're...
we had an hour off.

456
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,402
- I have to do something.
- Yes.

457
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:26,808
He has to make
a very important phone call right now.

458
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:28,709
- It'll take me five minutes.
- Right now?

459
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,838
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:32,748
But you will have your presentation
starting after two minutes.

461
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,309
Please tell them
that I'll be three minutes late.

462
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:43,288
Well, there's a detail.

463
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:46,524
Jesus. Fuck.
How come we didn't know that?

464
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:48,759
I don't know.
That's really incredible.

465
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:52,292
- Come on.
- Okay. Pick up.

466
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:55,766
Jeez, this is terrible.

467
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:58,105
It's the stupidest--
I can't...

468
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:02,044
There's--it's an hour's difference.
The time zone is different here.

469
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,147
It's unbelievable.
How the fuck can that happen?

470
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,054
- Okay, there. That's done now.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

471
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:14,524
Okay, quick,
that shirt--the underwear.

472
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:17,256
The gold underwear.

473
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:18,591
Okay...

474
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:21,989
Do I have to put
something through here?

475
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,728
- No.
- Okay.

476
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:24,962
Need help?

477
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:29,238
- Your testicles hanging out?
- Uh, yeah.

478
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:32,267
Okay.

479
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:33,504
Here you go.

480
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:35,939
Okay. Great.

481
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:41,647
Oh, God.
Okay...great.

482
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,188
- It's got a little air in it.
- Okay, now the pants.

483
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:45,847
Hurry.

484
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:53,094
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm so sorry.

485
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:13,348
Thank you.
I'm terribly sorry--

486
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:17,618
Yes, I have my presentation.

487
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:20,788
Terribly sorry.

488
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:24,727
I think the World Trade Organization is
supposed to know about time zones, but...

489
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:28,922
Somebody said,
"Isn't there a time difference?"

490
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,096
And I said, "Nope.
All of Europe, same time zone."

491
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:36,004
- So that convinced us all.
- Me too.

492
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:40,238
We were convinced that it was the right
time, and we woke up this morning...

493
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:43,440
And we were running five
or ten minutes late,

494
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:47,474
and then figured out
that the laptop wasn't working.

495
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:49,952
No, maybe we could switch the order.

496
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:52,353
Could we have somebody else go,
and then I go later?

497
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:54,153
They said, "I think we can do that."

498
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:57,320
Then they called the coffee people
and talked to the coffee people

499
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,953
to see if the coffee was possible.

500
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,019
That was it.

501
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,538
Thank you very much.

502
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:16,368
This one...

503
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:21,373
It's quite an honor to be here
in Tampere addressing this audience

504
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:25,177
of the most outstanding
textile workers in the world today.

505
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:30,451
I see on all the faces here today
a touching childlike eagerness

506
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:34,390
to tackle the biggest
textiles questions in the world.

507
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,791
How do we at the WTO fit in?

508
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:41,355
What we want to do at the WTO
is help you achieve your dollar results.

509
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:43,697
And in just 20 minutes from now,

510
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm going to show you
the WTO's very own solution

511
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:51,804
to two of the very biggest problems
in management.

512
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:55,107
One--maintaining rapport
with distant workforce,

513
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,014
and two--maintaining
healthful amounts of leisure.

514
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:03,282
This solution, appropriately enough,
is based in textiles.

515
00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:09,191
But how did workers
ever get to be a problem?

516
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:12,227
Before unveiling our solution,

517
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:17,291
I'd like to talk a bit about the history
of the worker management problem.

518
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:21,032
We all know about the American
Civil War--at least in the U.S.

519
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:25,270
It was the bloodiest, least-profitable war
in the history of our country.

520
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,709
A war in which unbelievably
huge amounts of money

521
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:30,942
went right down the drain--
and all for textiles.

522
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:35,952
By the 1860s, the South
was utterly flush with cash.

523
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,511
It had recently benefited
from the cotton gin--

524
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,058
an invention that took
the seeds out of cotton

525
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:44,095
and the South
out of its pre-industrial past.

526
00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:45,823
Hundreds of thousands of workers

527
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,331
previously unemployed
in their countries of origin

528
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,391
were given useful jobs in textiles.

529
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:55,162
Into this rosy picture of freedom
and boom stepped--you guessed it--

530
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,231
the North.

531
00:34:57,308 --> 00:35:01,301
Now, some Civil War apologists have said
that the Civil War, for all its faults,

532
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:03,609
at least had the effect of outlawing

533
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,616
an involuntarily imported
workforce model of work.

534
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:09,278
Now, this model is, of course,
a terrible thing.

535
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:11,345
I myself am an abolitionist.

536
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:15,757
But, in fact, there is no doubt
that, left to their own devices,

537
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:20,423
markets would've eventually replaced
slavery with cleaner sources of labor.

538
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:23,363
To prove my point,
please join me

539
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:26,768
on what Albert Einstein used to call
a thought experiment.

540
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:32,006
Suppose involuntarily imported labor
had never been outlawed.

541
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:35,671
That slaves still existed,
and that it were easy to own one.

542
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:39,581
What do you think it would cost today
to profitably maintain a slave,

543
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,642
say, here in Tampere?

544
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:47,123
Let's see...a finished clothing set
costs $50 at the very least.

545
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:50,923
Two meals from McDonald's
cost about $10.00.

546
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:54,988
The cheapest small room
probably runs for about $250 a month.

547
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,001
To function well, you have to pay
for your slave's health care.

548
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:02,130
If its country of origin was polluted,
for example, that might run expensively.

549
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:05,199
And, of course, what with
child labor laws here in Finland,

550
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:08,109
much of the youth market
is simply not available.

551
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:13,150
Now leave the same slave
back at home. Let's say Gabon.

552
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:17,086
In Gabon, $10 pays
for two weeks of food.

553
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:22,218
$250 pays for two years
of housing, not a month, at best.

554
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:25,956
$50 pays for a lifetime
of budget clothing.

555
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,964
And health care is,
of course, cheaper.

556
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:32,867
On top of it all...youth can be
gainfully employed without restriction.

557
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:35,428
The biggest benefit
of the remote labor system, though,

558
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:37,668
is to the slave him or herself,

559
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:42,008
because in Gabon there is no need
for the slave not to be free.

560
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,479
This is primarily because

561
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:46,483
there are no one-time
slave transport costs to recoup

562
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,542
and so the potential losses
from fleeing

563
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,919
are limited to the slave's
rudimentary training.

564
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,049
Since the slave can be free,

565
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,617
he or she suddenly becomes
a worker rather than a slave.

566
00:36:57,695 --> 00:37:01,290
Also terrific for morale
is that slaves--workers--

567
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,766
have the luxury of remaining
in their native habitat

568
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:06,702
and don't have to relocate to places
where they would be subject

569
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:10,263
to such unpleasantries
as homesickness and racism.

570
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:14,172
I think it's clear
from our little thought experiment

571
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:17,737
that if the North and South
had simply let the market sort it out

572
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,612
without protectionist tariffs,

573
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:23,745
they would've quickly given up slavery
for something more efficient anyhow.

574
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:25,152
By forcing the issue,

575
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:29,159
the North not only committed a terrible
injustice against the freedom of the South,

576
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:31,161
but also deprived slavery

577
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:34,426
of its natural development
into remote labor.

578
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,324
Had the leaders
of the 1860s United States

579
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:40,963
understood what our leaders
understand today,

580
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,303
the Civil War
would never have happened.

581
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:47,009
In a world where the headquarters
of a company might be in New York,

582
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,342
Hong Kong, or Espoo, Finland,

583
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:53,578
and the workers are in Gabon,
Rangoon, or Estonia,

584
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:56,984
how does a manager maintain
proper rapport with the workers,

585
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,216
and how does he or she
ensure from a distance

586
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,350
that workers perform their work
in an ethical fashion?

587
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:05,790
I'm about to show you
an actual prototype

588
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:10,323
of the WTO's solution to two major
management problems of today.

589
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:13,234
Now, we all know that not even
the best workplace design

590
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:16,967
can help even the most
astute manager keep track of workers.

591
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:22,308
What you need is a solution that enables
complete rapport with workers--

592
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,871
especially when they're
located far away.

593
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,245
Mike, would you help me a moment?

594
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:52,106
Thank you.

595
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:54,906
This is much better.
Much more comfortable.

596
00:38:56,414 --> 00:39:00,578
This is the WTO's answer to two
of the major management problems,

597
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:03,712
and we're calling it
the Management Leisure Suit.

598
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:06,120
It's--the two problems again--

599
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,023
how to maintain close rapport
with distant workers

600
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:13,928
and how to remain comfortable
and increase leisure activities.

601
00:39:13,998 --> 00:39:16,831
How does
the Management Leisure Suit work?

602
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:20,064
Besides being extremely comfortable,
as I can guarantee you.

603
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:23,904
Well, allow me to describe
the suit's core features.

604
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,625
This...

605
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:54,103
This is the E.V.A.--

606
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:58,040
the Employee Visualization Appendage.

607
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:01,476
It's an instantly deployable,
hip-mounted device

608
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:04,606
with totally hands-free operation...

609
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:09,016
that allows the manager to see
his employees directly right here.

610
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:13,490
Signals communicating the exact
amounts and quality of physical work

611
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:15,651
are transmitted
not only visually right here,

612
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:21,359
but directly through electric channels
implanted directly into the manager.

613
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:25,766
The workers, for their part, are fitted
with corresponding transmitting chips

614
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:29,637
that are implanted humanely
directly into the shoulder.

615
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:32,699
But the other equally important
achievement of the MLS

616
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:34,438
has to do with leisure.

617
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:38,312
In the United States, leisure--
another word for freedom, really--

618
00:40:38,382 --> 00:40:42,284
has been decreasing steadily
since the 1970s.

619
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:45,948
The Management Leisure Suit
permits the manager to reverse this trend

620
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:48,321
by letting him do his work anywhere

621
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:51,486
while remaining
in complete touch with the workers,

622
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:55,225
physically sensing what's going on
in the workforce, on the floor,

623
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:58,234
through channels implanted
directly into the manager.

624
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:01,135
Again, the manager
sees the employees,

625
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,366
but also feels what they're feeling

626
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:07,775
and can select where to focus
in the workplace environment.

627
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,011
So, in conclusion,

628
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:14,745
I'd like to ask,
is this a science-fiction scenario?

629
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:21,914
The answer is no.

630
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,452
Everything we've seen here,
everything we've been talking about

631
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,020
is entirely possible today.

632
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:31,233
We can always look forward
on the highways of progress

633
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:33,361
towards ever-new horizons

634
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:37,703
with cooperation and mutual delight
in the fruits of prosperity.

635
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:40,835
I'm very excited to be here.
Thank you very much.

636
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:10,098
Something we're trying
to do more and more as...

637
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:32,620
I wasn't depressed
by people not reacting,

638
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:36,098
I wasn't depressed by people just
swallowing it and not asking questions

639
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:40,661
because I thought, "Well, that shows
that you need some sort of control,"

640
00:42:40,738 --> 00:42:44,071
because the WTO--me--
can come in

641
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:48,407
and say these amazingly hideous things
to this group of the most educated people,

642
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:52,210
like the top .1% education-wise people
in the entire world

643
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:54,148
in a developed country
like Finland--

644
00:42:54,218 --> 00:42:56,686
these people all have PhDs
or advanced degrees--

645
00:42:56,754 --> 00:42:58,745
and you can say
the most atrocious things

646
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:02,315
and nobody will really react
and nobody will really care.

647
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:06,921
It's like, you know,
what can't corporations get away with?

648
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,641
So, where are we?

649
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:23,305
Well, we're arriving
in Helsinki right now.

650
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:26,416
We left the conference this morning.

651
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:31,478
It was just--it had driven us
completely mad after dinner last night.

652
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:33,955
I think we had our fill with dinner.

653
00:43:34,025 --> 00:43:36,084
I had to actually leave
a little bit early.

654
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,494
I went over to the table where Unruh--

655
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:44,694
Hank Hardy had to sit
with the big men and eat,

656
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:47,101
and I told him
that we needed to leave

657
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:51,835
because we had a telephone meeting
with Mobutu Oblongatu immediately.

658
00:43:53,878 --> 00:43:55,209
- Great.
- Hi.

659
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:56,610
Sorry to butt in a minute,

660
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:59,013
but we're supposed to meet
Manduka Djubango...

661
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,812
- Oh, God.
- ...at 10:00.

662
00:44:00,885 --> 00:44:02,716
And then we both started laughing,

663
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:05,984
which was really not convenient
for the context.

664
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:10,016
So we left, and we just decided
that, basically,

665
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:14,497
we couldn't figure out what else
we could possibly do at this conference,

666
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:18,228
so we just thought, "Well,
let's go to Helsinki instead."

667
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:20,665
So, this is the paper.

668
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:23,070
On the front page--
I just discovered it--

669
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,473
it says there's a seminar
at the university

670
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:30,878
and that somebody talked
about controlling remote workers

671
00:44:30,948 --> 00:44:34,111
with electrical impulsions.

672
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:37,018
And then you turn to the page, and...

673
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:39,846
...and that's what you get.

674
00:44:39,924 --> 00:44:45,794
And this right here represents
the World Trade Organization.

675
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:50,891
This... <i>is</i>
the World Trade Organization.

676
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:59,600
I went down to these
Mexican border towns in the mid '80s.

677
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:01,508
They were called "Maquilladoras"

678
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:04,173
when they had
the first trade agreements

679
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:06,944
between Mexico and the United States.

680
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:10,283
And everyone was saying, "This is
gonna raise Mexico out of poverty,"

681
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:12,845
and things were gonna be so great,
and within ten years,

682
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:15,517
they'd all be driving
shiny new cars in Mexico.

683
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:18,528
And I went down there and saw this--

684
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:22,430
the incredible poverty
in these Mexican border towns.

685
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,402
Fifteen years later, I went back.
Not a damn thing had changed.

686
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,928
Here's all these workers working
for all these American corporations,

687
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:32,532
and you just go across the street

688
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:35,704
and you found people
living in the same horrid conditions,

689
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,771
the same poverty existing.

690
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:41,579
And you had to ask,
"Well, who's benefiting from this?"

691
00:45:41,652 --> 00:45:44,143
Who benefited were
these American corporations.

692
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:46,712
During the 1990s,
they became even more wealthy,

693
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:49,954
they posted record profits--
larger record profits,

694
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:52,757
and the people in Mexico
just continued to suffer.

695
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,390
It was all a big scam.

696
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,949
Is this the one?

697
00:46:14,018 --> 00:46:17,419
No. You got the wrong one.

698
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:18,648
Shit.

699
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,681
"Will WTO stand up?"

700
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:24,751
Oh, my God. It's got pictures.
They're nice, too.

701
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:26,820
Yeah, they actually look okay
at that size.

702
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:30,560
"Bichlbaum isn't...
but he plays one on TV."

703
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:33,034
This is basically the core
of what we do.

704
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:36,801
All of these newspapers
and magazines have articles

705
00:46:36,874 --> 00:46:38,603
on the Yes Men,

706
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:42,168
and this is why
we are doing these things.

707
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:44,237
This is why we go
and do these conferences.

708
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:46,647
It's not for the 200 people
or the hundred people

709
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:48,878
that might see us give the lecture.

710
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:50,784
Although we'd like them to come away

711
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:53,517
with an interesting experience
from the lecture,

712
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:57,994
the reason we do it is so that people
who read <i>Bizarre</i> magazine

713
00:46:58,062 --> 00:47:00,860
or the <i>New York Times</i>
or <i>Fortune</i> or <i>Harper's</i>

714
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:03,593
can read about it
in the mainstream press.

715
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:06,192
This is how millions of people
could read about it

716
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:11,572
and potentially get turned on
to some of the ideas of anti-globalization.

717
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:14,805
One of the problems
with the <i>Fortune</i> thing

718
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:18,610
is that it's in this--
well, <i>Fortune--</i>

719
00:47:18,682 --> 00:47:22,846
it's read by business people
and accountants and that kind of thing.

720
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:29,758
And that's exactly who we're supposed
to be talking to in Australia in May.

721
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:31,658
It's an accounting conference.

722
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:34,721
It's a little...
a little worrisome.

723
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,743
You need a new shirt?
One that's not wrinkled?

724
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:48,800
Yeah.

725
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:50,710
Will that be good with your thing?

726
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:53,213
Do you think it'll work
with your suit?

727
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:56,776
This one's extra large. Yeah, they'll all
work with my suit. It's terrible.

728
00:47:56,854 --> 00:47:59,186
- It's striped, though. Is that okay?
- Yeah.

729
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:02,489
- Sure it's okay.
- Why don't you go get a shirt, then?

730
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,893
I'll just get this. Wait.
Oh, it's not very much cotton.

731
00:48:05,963 --> 00:48:07,624
- How much is it?
- I hate that.

732
00:48:07,698 --> 00:48:10,360
- 35%?
- It's 35%. It's like...

733
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:11,526
No, it's fine for--

734
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:13,536
It doesn't wrinkle much--
that's nice about that.

735
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:16,164
I'll just wear it. All right.

736
00:48:22,846 --> 00:48:25,508
The thing is, there's a question
of whether he's--

737
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:28,313
at what point he recognizes you
doesn't really matter.

738
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:31,877
What we want is that moment
when he does recognize you.

739
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:34,948
So if he recognizes you here
and sees that you're in the room,

740
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:38,290
then he'll be looking back and forth
at you, at the screen.

741
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:41,695
At that point, if he recognizes you,
we better say something.

742
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:47,868
No, I think it's down here,
but I don't know.

743
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,801
It must be right down Morris.

744
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,035
Remember we walked...

745
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,442
It's on the end of this line here.

746
00:49:11,228 --> 00:49:12,286
Thanks.

747
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:18,260
- Andy, hi. How're you doing?
- Barry. Nice to meet you.

748
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,963
- Good to meet you.
- Good. Great.

749
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:22,198
We're in London,

750
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:26,266
and we were just at the offices
of the World Development Movement

751
00:49:26,343 --> 00:49:27,833
where we talked to Barry Coates,

752
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:30,072
who's the director
of the World Development Movement

753
00:49:30,147 --> 00:49:34,140
and who showed up
on CNBC MarketWrap Europe

754
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:37,881
debating our friend here--
Granwyth Hulatberi--

755
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:42,289
about the prospects of WTO
and globalization.

756
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:46,022
We kind of expected him maybe to have
a glimmer of recognition immediately,

757
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:47,358
and he didn't--okay.

758
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:50,025
Then we put on the tape and...

759
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,264
he laughed
at how horribly stupid it was,

760
00:49:54,338 --> 00:49:55,999
but he never realized

761
00:49:56,073 --> 00:49:59,406
that this wasn't really
a representative of the WTO.

762
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:02,070
Even when he saw me
like this right next to him,

763
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:05,172
and then we switched seats
and he still didn't notice.

764
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:08,707
Then I had to put my face
next to the thing and go...

765
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:10,913
Yeah, let's just pause it here.

766
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:13,149
- Okay. Hit stop.
- Is there a pause?

767
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:15,054
- Stop button.
- There's no pause.

768
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:18,754
I don't know what I could've said
after that clip.

769
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:20,558
I mean...really...

770
00:50:21,965 --> 00:50:26,129
"Where did they get this guy from?"
might've been my first comment.

771
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:28,865
So did you ever figure out
where they got the guy from?

772
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:36,136
I understood that he was in the External
Relations Department for the WTO.

773
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:39,080
- That's what they thought, too.
- That's what they thought, as well.

774
00:50:39,783 --> 00:50:40,943
- But...
- But...

775
00:50:41,018 --> 00:50:44,010
- ...as it happens, he wasn't.
- Yeah.

776
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:47,057
- In fact--
- Just take one more close look.

777
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:50,854
Wait, can we--is this reverse?

778
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:55,888
No!

779
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:01,533
I wasn't gonna mention the likeness.

780
00:51:02,573 --> 00:51:05,565
You were being very polite,
weren't you? Yeah.

781
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:08,238
- Yeah.
- You did it as a spoof?

782
00:51:08,379 --> 00:51:10,108
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Basically...

783
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:14,644
That's good. We weren't sure
how you would react.

784
00:51:14,718 --> 00:51:18,313
We were really hoping you wouldn't be
too offended. We were like, "Oh, no!"

785
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:20,721
Hell, no. That's great.
That's really--

786
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:23,624
I was wondering,
'cause I hadn't seen that guy before,

787
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:27,095
and I did know some of the WTO
External Relations people,

788
00:51:27,164 --> 00:51:31,260
and I was thinking, "My God,
they really put up a right one this time."

789
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:33,997
We wanted to talk
to Barry Coates as well

790
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:39,008
because he has a lot of statistics
and information about globalization

791
00:51:39,076 --> 00:51:42,443
that we thought would be useful
for the lecture in Australia.

792
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:45,004
All of the WTO agreements bar one

793
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:48,347
are all about restricting
what governments can do.

794
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:53,015
And so, essentially, the whole
trading system is built on the premise

795
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:58,255
that the companies trading internationally,
investing internationally,

796
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:03,322
are going to be preyed upon
by nasty governments.

797
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,732
And, really, what we have

798
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:08,738
is an international system
that is entirely the reverse.

799
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:11,001
What's got squeezed out of the system

800
00:52:11,074 --> 00:52:14,066
is democracy,
is development, is environment,

801
00:52:14,144 --> 00:52:17,136
is the kind of human values

802
00:52:17,214 --> 00:52:20,650
which really ought to be the center
of what we're trying to do.

803
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:24,209
We don't live to trade, you know.

804
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:27,121
We live to have decent lives.

805
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:29,682
And that ought to be the goal
of our trade policy,

806
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,788
not maximizing trade
or getting rid of any impediments to it.

807
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:02,351
Looks good.
I've got that.

808
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,721
Need to get the video...

809
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:08,929
...and we'll be off.

810
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,432
Let's see...

811
00:53:13,237 --> 00:53:16,070
One of the big reasons
why I'm up here

812
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:20,098
is that we have the Australia gig
for the Yes Men.

813
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:24,170
I did an animation about the recycling
of post-consumer waste

814
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:27,979
into hamburgers and fast food.

815
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:30,281
So...here we go.

816
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:34,516
The answer to the world's
sustainable food future is in recycling.

817
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:38,420
Since over half our nutrients
taken in are eliminated,

818
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:39,894
valuable resources are at risk.

819
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:43,364
By using post-consumer waste,
reBurger allows essential nutrients

820
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:46,732
to be offered to developing countries
for greatly reduced cost.

821
00:53:48,038 --> 00:53:49,699
Okay...

822
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:56,072
It gets better.

823
00:53:57,314 --> 00:53:58,576
- Wait.
- What was that?

824
00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:01,140
- Was that in outer space?
- What the hell was that?

825
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:04,720
I think it does the job.
I think it does the job.

826
00:54:07,624 --> 00:54:11,617
We're here in New York
because Herb Alpert,

827
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:14,687
of Herb Alpert
and the Tijuana Brass,

828
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,926
gave us this award.

829
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,664
A bunch of money to do
the kind of stuff that we do.

830
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:24,229
So we had to come here
and have dinner with him

831
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:26,970
and get the money
and thank everybody.

832
00:54:27,044 --> 00:54:29,877
It was very nice
and very surprising.

833
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:33,280
But we're very pleased.
I think we can say we're very pleased.

834
00:54:34,184 --> 00:54:35,845
Yeah, it was a big chunk of money.

835
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:39,753
It's gonna bankroll a lot
of future activities like going to Australia.

836
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:42,949
Yeah, so we got
this chunk of money but,

837
00:54:43,026 --> 00:54:45,358
of course, now we're
also using this opportunity

838
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:48,091
and this hotel room here in New York
to meet up with Matt

839
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:51,157
who's been working on the PowerPoint
presentation for Australia,

840
00:54:51,234 --> 00:54:52,826
and to meet up with Patrick

841
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:56,498
who's been working on animations
for Australia as well.

842
00:54:56,573 --> 00:55:00,703
Fortunately we were lucky, too,
because Snafu was in town.

843
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:03,507
He's sort of a European Yes Man.

844
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,673
He's been circulating
in the European scene

845
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:08,240
doing Yes Men-type activities.

846
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:11,253
But it's a good thing
he's here in the States

847
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:13,653
so he could go
to Plattsburgh with us.

848
00:55:13,724 --> 00:55:16,215
Yes, trade liberalization
is a religious undertaking.

849
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:18,853
A project of faith, a crusade of sorts,
and it has been

850
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:22,296
ever since its founders declared
that financial success comes from God

851
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:25,358
and that wealth
is a sign of divine favor.

852
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:29,667
Now, why is starvation a problem?
First, the facts.

853
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,834
As we all know, investment
and exports have been on the rise...

854
00:55:35,646 --> 00:55:37,307
There's some bad news.

855
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:40,646
There's some really bad news
that came down in the last two days.

856
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:43,984
The conference in Australia--

857
00:55:44,054 --> 00:55:46,716
the people from the conference
in Australia wrote an e-mail

858
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:51,454
saying that the conference has been
canceled because of low enrollment.

859
00:55:51,528 --> 00:55:54,190
In some ways
it's really kind of, I guess,

860
00:55:54,264 --> 00:55:56,596
a nice thing
that there was underenrollment

861
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,828
because it was really
a hideous conference

862
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:00,961
and it seemed like a really dire thing

863
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:03,871
that people would actually
want to go to that thing.

864
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,272
And so, it's really
encouraging for humanity

865
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:08,743
that the conference
actually has been canceled.

866
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:12,839
But at the same time, it's really
made things difficult for us.

867
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:14,907
So I wrote back to them
as Hildegard West

868
00:56:14,985 --> 00:56:18,648
and I asked them if they
would please set up another venue

869
00:56:18,722 --> 00:56:22,317
because Kinnithrung Sprat
is already en route to Australia.

870
00:56:22,392 --> 00:56:25,793
So right now I'm waiting to see
if they come back to us

871
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:29,696
with a suggestion that they'll actually
have a public presentation,

872
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:32,496
but since the conference
has been canceled,

873
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:38,098
now the event in Plattsburgh might be
the only venue we have for this lecture.

874
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:41,611
So it's really important now that we get
the lecture done and sort of together.

875
00:56:41,678 --> 00:56:48,413
So it's no longer a dress rehearsal.
It's actually, like, the final production.

876
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:51,317
It's about time.

877
00:56:51,388 --> 00:56:53,481
I was so worried about your shoes.

878
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:56,355
This guy brought
real shoes for you. Look.

879
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:58,257
Do we have the hamburgers yet?

880
00:56:59,062 --> 00:57:01,121
- We have to pick them up.
- You mentioned--

881
00:57:01,198 --> 00:57:03,530
They're ordered.
Richard ordered them already.

882
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,431
- That's fantastic.
- We pick them up?

883
00:57:05,502 --> 00:57:08,562
Basically, there's this guy
named Richard Robbins who I met

884
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:10,629
at a conference
about a month ago,

885
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:15,508
and he has written
several books on globalization.

886
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,843
He was interested
in having the WTO

887
00:57:18,915 --> 00:57:21,315
come speak
at the Economics Department.

888
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:24,785
Only he really knows that this
isn't really the WTO.

889
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:27,119
Everybody else will think
that it's the WTO.

890
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:30,437
But another good thing is
that it will be a hungry audience,

891
00:57:30,511 --> 00:57:33,503
so there's a good chance
they are going to eat those hamburgers,

892
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,741
which we weren't sure
was actually gonna happen

893
00:57:35,816 --> 00:57:38,148
with the accountants in Australia.

894
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,513
I think, for look,
I should probably carry these in.

895
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:45,581
Okay. Can you do it?

896
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:49,493
I'm thinking that you probably shouldn't
be associated with the hamburgers.

897
00:57:49,563 --> 00:57:50,825
Okay.

898
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:53,298
I'd like to thank everybody for coming.

899
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:59,033
You have many education choices,
and we're all grateful at the WTO

900
00:57:59,106 --> 00:58:02,075
that you have chosen
to listen to us for an hour

901
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:05,475
and to our messages about things
that will impact everyone.

902
00:58:05,546 --> 00:58:07,878
I'd like to say that,
by joining us here,

903
00:58:07,948 --> 00:58:11,008
you're essentially embarking
with us on a mission.

904
00:58:12,052 --> 00:58:14,646
I'd like to start right at the beginning.

905
00:58:14,722 --> 00:58:16,383
As I was saying,

906
00:58:16,457 --> 00:58:20,518
trade liberalization is a project of faith;
it's a crusade.

907
00:58:20,594 --> 00:58:22,653
And in any crusade,
there are problems.

908
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:25,392
There are invading armies,
there are big blockades.

909
00:58:25,466 --> 00:58:30,301
And one of the problems
that we run into in this crusade

910
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:32,065
is starvation in the Third World.

911
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:35,472
You may recognize that symbol
from those green bins you see...

912
00:58:35,542 --> 00:58:37,737
where cans, bottles, blah, blah.

913
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:41,645
The kind of recycling I'm talking about
that we have developed at the WTO

914
00:58:41,715 --> 00:58:46,778
is...not--not really
this irrelevant kind of recycling

915
00:58:46,854 --> 00:58:50,017
where the target--
individual consumers like you and me

916
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:55,585
or of non-edible industrial products--
is such a tiny part of the problem.

917
00:58:55,662 --> 00:59:00,861
Rather, we're talking about really
recycling what counts where it counts.

918
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:03,095
To begin to understand
the theory behind this,

919
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:06,867
you must first realize that the human body
is not really very efficient.

920
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:11,434
When ingesting heavy foods,
only about 20% of the nutrients

921
00:59:11,512 --> 00:59:14,276
are absorbed
by the alimentary passageway

922
00:59:14,348 --> 00:59:18,341
while the other 80% finds itself
expelled in post-consumer byproducts.

923
00:59:18,418 --> 00:59:19,908
Already 20 years ago,

924
00:59:19,987 --> 00:59:23,821
NASA scientists began
to tap into this nutritional gold mine

925
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:27,383
by developing filters that could
transform their astronauts' waste

926
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:31,591
into healthy, hygienic,
and even delicious food once again.

927
00:59:31,665 --> 00:59:33,326
With the use of this technology,

928
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,393
a single hamburger, for example,
can be eaten more than ten times,

929
00:59:37,471 --> 00:59:42,374
providing a cumulative total
of three times the nutritional value

930
00:59:42,442 --> 00:59:44,603
of the original fresh hamburger.

931
00:59:44,678 --> 00:59:48,478
Now, again, a certain amount
of cultural openness is required

932
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:51,382
as we investigate solutions.

933
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:53,476
And I'd love to take any questions.

934
00:59:53,554 --> 00:59:54,612
Yes, you've been--

935
00:59:54,688 --> 00:59:56,519
Coming from a Third World country,

936
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,424
I found most of what you said
pretty offensive.

937
01:00:00,494 --> 01:00:05,329
It's as if everyone is equal,
but some are more equal than others.

938
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:07,390
And...who is to say

939
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:10,664
whether people in the Third World
want a burger?

940
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:13,900
You know, I, in my heart,
sometimes find it to agree

941
01:00:13,974 --> 01:00:17,637
that cultures deserve
an equal consideration

942
01:00:17,711 --> 01:00:19,645
perhaps to develop on their own terms,

943
01:00:19,713 --> 01:00:21,044
but we're different.

944
01:00:21,114 --> 01:00:23,776
We're culturally different.
We're rich, they're poor.

945
01:00:23,851 --> 01:00:26,319
This is the most humane solution
we can come up with

946
01:00:26,386 --> 01:00:28,081
that stays within the market logic.

947
01:00:28,155 --> 01:00:31,818
If it's all right, I could answer
a portion of that question, as well.

948
01:00:31,892 --> 01:00:35,919
And this answers the question
about desire for the product

949
01:00:35,996 --> 01:00:39,329
because the biggest growth areas
are the developing world.

950
01:00:39,399 --> 01:00:43,392
And so, in fact,
people do want the product.

951
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:48,635
We do have a kind of video presentation
about this that I came prepared to show.

952
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:53,339
It's not--the program isn't actually
completely ready yet.

953
01:00:55,549 --> 01:01:00,953
So, as you can see here,
there's a consumer in the First World

954
01:01:01,021 --> 01:01:04,684
entering McDonald's
and consuming a hamburger.

955
01:01:06,393 --> 01:01:11,023
And, afterward, this is the process
we're all familiar with.

956
01:01:11,098 --> 01:01:13,225
I don't need
to explain it to anyone.

957
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:17,430
But...

958
01:01:17,504 --> 01:01:20,029
You see, it's rendered out
in this style

959
01:01:20,107 --> 01:01:24,476
because studies have shown
that consumers are most responsive

960
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:28,640
to 3-D animation right now,
particularly in developing cultures.

961
01:01:30,117 --> 01:01:32,779
So, as you can see,
it goes through a piping system,

962
01:01:32,853 --> 01:01:34,514
and this isn't unusual.

963
01:01:34,588 --> 01:01:38,080
We do this for oil.
We could do this for food, as well.

964
01:01:38,158 --> 01:01:42,288
And, as you can see,
it goes back up through the plumbing...

965
01:01:42,362 --> 01:01:45,354
and emerges in a McDonald's.

966
01:01:45,432 --> 01:01:49,095
Now, the part of this video that isn't
completed yet is the filtering process.

967
01:01:49,169 --> 01:01:53,663
There will be
a very well-rendered filtering...

968
01:02:04,518 --> 01:02:08,079
As you can see--this might answer
somebody's question from before,

969
01:02:08,155 --> 01:02:10,715
but at the McDonald's
in a developing country

970
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:12,782
and, in fact,
in this country as well,

971
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:15,350
you would be able to choose--
the number one, number two,

972
01:02:15,429 --> 01:02:17,294
number three,
number four, number five

973
01:02:17,364 --> 01:02:19,992
would no longer refer
to combinations of food,

974
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:23,628
but rather just the number of times
the product had been recycled.

975
01:02:25,472 --> 01:02:29,067
We're lucky to be able to partner with
the World Trade Organization which,

976
01:02:29,142 --> 01:02:31,042
you know, has slightly different goals.

977
01:02:31,111 --> 01:02:34,103
Of course, McDonald's goals
are to profit and grow,

978
01:02:34,181 --> 01:02:35,842
and we hope that we can provide

979
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:38,407
a nutritious and tasty product
in the process.

980
01:02:38,485 --> 01:02:42,649
Our goals are to help McDonald's profit
and grow, and all other corporations.

981
01:02:42,723 --> 01:02:45,556
I think you guys--
like, the WTO--

982
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:49,686
is kind of lacking kind of, like,
a human element, you know?

983
01:02:49,763 --> 01:02:55,633
Like...if you saw--
have you ever seen starving people?

984
01:02:55,702 --> 01:02:57,533
In pictures. Yes.

985
01:02:58,405 --> 01:03:01,465
So, tell me, if you saw
somebody starving to death,

986
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:03,702
you would probably think a lot--

987
01:03:03,777 --> 01:03:08,976
like, that would kind of hit you
in a sensitive place to say,

988
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:13,884
"Oh, maybe markets and money
and this and that don't really mean as much,

989
01:03:13,954 --> 01:03:16,946
and, actually, feeding people
means a little bit more."

990
01:03:17,024 --> 01:03:19,959
Well, it is true that there's
a personal side of it that--

991
01:03:20,027 --> 01:03:22,188
I have to say, in the WTO

992
01:03:22,262 --> 01:03:25,925
there are questions that we have
about this as human beings,

993
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:28,797
but we're not as subject--

994
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:30,860
we have a kind
of firmer grasp on theory.

995
01:03:30,937 --> 01:03:33,770
We are able, fortunately,

996
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,674
to simply direct world trade
in a much more theoretical way...

997
01:03:37,744 --> 01:03:41,407
in collaboration with our colleagues
at the largest corporations.

998
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:47,317
So...you know. Yes, probably,
if I went to these countries,

999
01:03:47,387 --> 01:03:53,121
I'd feel...l'd think about things
a little differently, perhaps.

1000
01:03:53,193 --> 01:03:56,685
But, at the same time, I don't think
I would forget all my schooling.

1001
01:03:56,763 --> 01:03:59,596
I don't think I would forget
all these theories and so on.

1002
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:02,999
So, perhaps one day I'll do that.

1003
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,368
This is a money-maker, correct?

1004
01:04:05,439 --> 01:04:09,307
Yes. Well, it's a money-maker,
starvation-solver, sure.

1005
01:04:09,376 --> 01:04:12,812
How much did McDonald's pay you to
come here and speak this garbage to us?

1006
01:04:12,879 --> 01:04:15,973
Did I see a mouse with an ear
growing out of its back?

1007
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:19,382
How are you going to get around
the cultural and legal implications

1008
01:04:19,453 --> 01:04:22,354
of cannibalism and basically
asking us to recycle shit?

1009
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:55,178
The reality is that we already
treat people in the Third World

1010
01:04:55,255 --> 01:04:57,723
far worse than we treat
our domestic animals.

1011
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:02,125
That's--that's not saying it's right.
It's just saying that's the reality.

1012
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,902
Well, after thinking about it
for a little while,

1013
01:05:12,973 --> 01:05:16,306
it seems the Plattsburgh lecture
just went great,

1014
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:20,210
and it went exactly the way we
originally expected these lectures to work,

1015
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,545
which is that, at a certain point,
it was like a light bulb's going off

1016
01:05:23,617 --> 01:05:26,017
in the heads of the different people
in the audience,

1017
01:05:26,086 --> 01:05:29,681
and they were realizing that it
was just too crazy to be real,

1018
01:05:29,756 --> 01:05:31,917
and yet it was
sort of based in reality.

1019
01:05:31,992 --> 01:05:35,428
So, you know,
they started throwing globes at us,

1020
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:37,759
they got angry,
they got frustrated.

1021
01:05:37,831 --> 01:05:40,095
It worked exactly
like we thought it would.

1022
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:45,270
They don't ask if you believe in it.

1023
01:05:45,338 --> 01:05:48,432
You don't get to vote
on World Trade Organization treaties.

1024
01:05:48,508 --> 01:05:51,102
They don't let you vote on it.
They don't give you a say.

1025
01:05:51,178 --> 01:05:54,079
They let you listen
to the one-sided propaganda.

1026
01:05:54,147 --> 01:05:57,639
Name me a single columnist in America
who doesn't stand up and cheer

1027
01:05:57,717 --> 01:05:59,878
under the banner
of so-called free trade.

1028
01:05:59,953 --> 01:06:01,511
There's no public discussion,

1029
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:05,422
there's no dissent
in any of the political parties.

1030
01:06:05,492 --> 01:06:08,655
There's no debate,
there's no discussion, there's no vote.

1031
01:06:08,728 --> 01:06:13,665
In fact, the only nation
which has called for a vote is Brazil,

1032
01:06:13,733 --> 01:06:18,397
which is saying that it
will not sign any more trade treaties

1033
01:06:18,471 --> 01:06:20,598
without a plebiscite of its people.

1034
01:06:20,674 --> 01:06:24,337
And the world trade barons
are losing their damn minds

1035
01:06:24,411 --> 01:06:29,246
trying to prevent this type of democracy
from spreading planet-wide,

1036
01:06:29,316 --> 01:06:32,979
'cause once people know what this stuff
is about and get to vote on it,

1037
01:06:33,053 --> 01:06:35,783
no one's gonna vote themselves
into poverty.

1038
01:06:39,826 --> 01:06:42,488
Here we go.
"Australia country code."

1039
01:06:45,332 --> 01:06:47,129
Australia, 61.
It's 61.

1040
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,360
Sixty-one.

1041
01:06:53,473 --> 01:06:57,466
Hi, this is Kinnithrung Sprat
from the WTO.

1042
01:06:57,544 --> 01:07:00,206
- <i>Hello. how are you?</i>
- Good, thanks. How are you?

1043
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,443
<i>- Where are you now?</i>
- I'm in New York at the moment.

1044
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:05,677
<i>- In New York, are you?</i>
- Yes.

1045
01:07:05,752 --> 01:07:11,156
Kinnithrung Sprat just called the person
who's coordinating Sprat's visit.

1046
01:07:11,224 --> 01:07:15,160
I'm due in Hong Kong
the week after this,

1047
01:07:15,228 --> 01:07:17,219
and that date is firm,

1048
01:07:17,297 --> 01:07:22,030
but my travel to Australia
is as yet not firm. Yeah.

1049
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:25,265
She's actually, it turns out,
been e-mailing all these people

1050
01:07:25,338 --> 01:07:27,670
and basically calling journalists

1051
01:07:27,741 --> 01:07:29,936
and getting people
to attend his lecture.

1052
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:34,174
She fully expects him to attend because
she had spoken to Hildegard West,

1053
01:07:34,247 --> 01:07:37,375
Sprat's assistant,
and Hildegard West had told her

1054
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:40,510
that everything was on
and Sprat was definitely going.

1055
01:07:40,587 --> 01:07:43,078
So now we've just decided
we really have to go

1056
01:07:43,156 --> 01:07:46,592
to honor this arrangement
with Australia.

1057
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,652
So it's back on now
after we totally thought it was off.

1058
01:07:49,729 --> 01:07:53,790
And instead of giving this lecture that
we've been planning for, like, nine months,

1059
01:07:53,867 --> 01:07:57,803
we're gonna, like, you know,
just disband the WTO.

1060
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:03,503
Shouldn't we get you a pair of shoes
that actually are reasonable?

1061
01:08:03,576 --> 01:08:06,909
They just don't look like dress shoes.
They look like wrestling shoes.

1062
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,414
There are no shoes here
for you. Never mind.

1063
01:08:09,482 --> 01:08:11,450
No. Shoes are out.

1064
01:08:11,518 --> 01:08:12,507
A tie.

1065
01:08:13,653 --> 01:08:14,915
Around, then...

1066
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,580
Wait--did you try this?

1067
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:21,455
Yeah.

1068
01:08:23,463 --> 01:08:27,627
I did a set of these with inkjet,
and they just don't look as real.

1069
01:08:27,701 --> 01:08:29,635
Something about them.
They look...

1070
01:08:29,703 --> 01:08:31,637
- These look perfect.
- ...kind of handmade.

1071
01:08:32,305 --> 01:08:34,136
I printed off some letterhead for you.

1072
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:35,868
- Nice.
- You guys already saw that.

1073
01:08:35,942 --> 01:08:38,308
- And I just kept it real simple...
- It's perfect.

1074
01:08:38,378 --> 01:08:40,778
...so that it would show up well
on the fax.

1075
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:44,046
That is the most ridiculous photo.

1076
01:08:44,117 --> 01:08:48,349
There's something really weird
about this maniacal public relations guy.

1077
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:51,322
- A little magnetic strip on the back.
- A logo of the WTO.

1078
01:08:51,391 --> 01:08:52,585
Really beautiful.

1079
01:08:54,327 --> 01:08:57,490
You know what I did?
I went to Google...

1080
01:08:57,564 --> 01:09:02,399
and I went to Google image search
and I typed in, "I.D. card."

1081
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:05,961
And you wouldn't believe
the number of pictures of I.D. cards

1082
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:07,870
that show up on the Web.

1083
01:09:07,941 --> 01:09:10,808
And I just went through
and took a little bit from each one.

1084
01:09:10,877 --> 01:09:14,040
I said, "All right, this one's got
a little bar code at the bottom,

1085
01:09:14,114 --> 01:09:16,344
and this one uses
the logo over here."

1086
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:18,407
That is so nice.

1087
01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:32,190
- I know.
- Wow. Airplane.

1088
01:09:34,534 --> 01:09:36,229
Where's the rental car area?

1089
01:09:56,322 --> 01:09:58,313
No, I don't know.
I'm just really nervous

1090
01:09:58,391 --> 01:10:01,883
'cause this feels different from all
the other things that we've done.

1091
01:10:01,961 --> 01:10:08,696
It's not like the same kind of play,
fun, crazy, weird, impossible stuff.

1092
01:10:08,768 --> 01:10:10,258
This is sincere, you know.

1093
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:13,203
It's about replacing the WTO
with something better.

1094
01:10:13,273 --> 01:10:16,333
- Do you think that satire is more fun?
- Yeah, definitely.

1095
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:19,640
I got this feeling that it's--
for some reason--

1096
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:22,203
maybe it's less fun to be sincere.

1097
01:10:22,282 --> 01:10:24,273
But it is less fun, isn't it?

1098
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:26,181
In a way, yeah.

1099
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:31,849
Maybe it's more fun
to be satirical than serious.

1100
01:10:31,925 --> 01:10:33,085
Yeah.

1101
01:10:37,697 --> 01:10:39,790
It's about 9:00 in the morning,

1102
01:10:39,866 --> 01:10:42,426
and this is the big day
for Kinnithrung Sprat

1103
01:10:42,502 --> 01:10:44,402
to go talk to CPA Australia

1104
01:10:44,471 --> 01:10:46,632
and close down the WTO.

1105
01:10:46,706 --> 01:10:51,905
It's kind of an exciting day for us
'cause we finally get to shut it down.

1106
01:11:06,226 --> 01:11:10,720
I'm writing the local phone number
for this cell phone on the business cards.

1107
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:13,732
So if we give these to journalists
or anybody else

1108
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,533
who wants to contact Mr. Sprat--they'll be
able to do it in the next couple days.

1109
01:11:20,974 --> 01:11:23,135
We have to leave
in ten minutes, though.

1110
01:11:23,209 --> 01:11:24,642
I know.

1111
01:11:24,711 --> 01:11:27,544
I'm just gonna do
as little as possible.

1112
01:11:30,683 --> 01:11:34,175
Okay, let's just go by there.
We have some time yet.

1113
01:11:34,254 --> 01:11:36,586
Let's just keep walking.
Just walk straight.

1114
01:11:36,723 --> 01:11:40,716
Don't look.
Don't turn left. Don't...

1115
01:11:40,793 --> 01:11:43,819
Hey, no. Don't.
Don't do that.

1116
01:11:45,665 --> 01:11:46,825
Answer it.

1117
01:11:47,767 --> 01:11:49,598
Hello, Michael Bonanno here.

1118
01:11:52,505 --> 01:11:54,063
Hi, Jane. How are you?

1119
01:11:55,675 --> 01:11:59,111
All right, then. I guess
we'll see you in just a few minutes.

1120
01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:01,510
And we just come up
to level three, then?

1121
01:12:01,581 --> 01:12:04,846
Great. Thank you very much.
All right. Bye-bye.

1122
01:12:04,918 --> 01:12:06,010
Run!

1123
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,687
Oh, wait. Shit!
This is the building!

1124
01:12:13,192 --> 01:12:14,887
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having us.

1125
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:18,692
Sorry for the confusion
and problems and everything else.

1126
01:12:18,765 --> 01:12:20,926
It's to be expected
these days, I think.

1127
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:26,167
No. Thanks for going out of your way
to arrange this. This is really terrific.

1128
01:12:31,811 --> 01:12:34,336
Thank you all for coming.
I'd like to...

1129
01:12:35,582 --> 01:12:38,983
I'd like to thank the organizers
for going out of their way

1130
01:12:39,052 --> 01:12:43,853
to create this panel,
this luncheon,

1131
01:12:43,923 --> 01:12:48,019
in the face of some odds--the conference
having been canceled, of course.

1132
01:12:48,094 --> 01:12:50,756
And I'd especially like to begin

1133
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:54,664
by apologizing for a rather sudden
change in the program,

1134
01:12:54,734 --> 01:13:01,003
consequent upon a rather dramatic
development in Geneva yesterday.

1135
01:13:01,074 --> 01:13:04,908
I originally intended to transmit today
an upbeat report

1136
01:13:04,978 --> 01:13:09,915
on some new technologies that affect
agribusiness in a global sense.

1137
01:13:09,983 --> 01:13:14,920
Instead, I find myself the messenger
of some rather disturbing news.

1138
01:13:14,988 --> 01:13:17,718
The WTO will be issuing
a public statement

1139
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:19,985
in detail by the end of the week.

1140
01:13:20,059 --> 01:13:22,050
But the die has been cast.

1141
01:13:22,128 --> 01:13:24,289
As of September 2002,

1142
01:13:24,364 --> 01:13:26,958
having seen the effects of policies

1143
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:30,560
whose only intent was to bring
greater prosperity and peace,

1144
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:35,438
the World Trade Organization,
in its present form, will cease to exist.

1145
01:13:36,376 --> 01:13:37,866
Over the next two years,

1146
01:13:37,944 --> 01:13:43,007
we at the WTO will endeavor to re-found
our organization along different lines,

1147
01:13:43,082 --> 01:13:47,143
based in a different understanding
of the purposes of world trade.

1148
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:51,178
The new organization will have
as its foundation and basis

1149
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:55,091
the United Nations'
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

1150
01:13:55,161 --> 01:13:59,564
upon which we feel
we can make a good foundation

1151
01:13:59,632 --> 01:14:02,294
to ensuring that the organization
will have human

1152
01:14:02,368 --> 01:14:05,303
rather than business interests
as its bottom line.

1153
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:07,202
My reaction was one of total surprise.

1154
01:14:07,273 --> 01:14:09,104
We were expecting
a speech more based

1155
01:14:09,175 --> 01:14:13,111
on what the World Trade Organization
does in its relation to Australian trade.

1156
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:16,171
It sort of blew me out of the water
when the announcement was made

1157
01:14:16,249 --> 01:14:19,980
that the World Trade Organization
is significantly reinventing itself

1158
01:14:20,053 --> 01:14:25,787
to focus on issues relating to people
as opposed to economics--

1159
01:14:25,858 --> 01:14:28,691
something that hopefully could be
of significant benefit

1160
01:14:28,761 --> 01:14:33,095
to the poor and needy throughout
the world in all developing countries.

1161
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:37,330
The U.N. estimates that poor countries--
the poorest countries in the world--

1162
01:14:37,403 --> 01:14:43,069
lose approximately $2 billion a day
because of unjust trade rules,

1163
01:14:43,142 --> 01:14:46,407
many of them instituted
by our own organization.

1164
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:48,743
And this is 14 times the amount

1165
01:14:48,815 --> 01:14:51,545
that they receive in aid
from developed countries.

1166
01:14:52,552 --> 01:14:57,216
I thought the speech itself was compelling
in terms of its information.

1167
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:02,887
I was astounded to find that they're
actually gonna dismantle the WTO.

1168
01:15:02,962 --> 01:15:07,695
I was also amazed to see that there was
a mission that perhaps had failed.

1169
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:11,100
It's gonna have a huge effect
on international business

1170
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:14,333
and particularly for us
as an organization, I feel.

1171
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:18,138
The hardest thing, I find,
will be the balance that, let's say,

1172
01:15:18,211 --> 01:15:20,736
the U.S., E.U., and Japan--

1173
01:15:20,813 --> 01:15:24,544
in terms of being major components
of the world economy--

1174
01:15:24,617 --> 01:15:28,451
the effect--will they really change
in terms of this new organization,

1175
01:15:28,521 --> 01:15:31,183
and will there actually
be genuine change

1176
01:15:31,257 --> 01:15:34,590
and perhaps a benefit
to the world's poorest countries?

1177
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,754
I must admit I'm a cynic
with regards to that occurring.

1178
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:41,095
Liberalization--
the process of liberalization

1179
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:43,226
often enables
the knowledge of the poor

1180
01:15:43,302 --> 01:15:47,170
to be converted into the property
of global corporations.

1181
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,607
Specific statistics are rather shocking.

1182
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:59,277
Out of 26,000 patents
applied for in Africa in 2000 and 2001,

1183
01:15:59,352 --> 01:16:03,186
only 31 were from residents of Africa.

1184
01:16:03,256 --> 01:16:06,089
The rest were from residents
of first world countries.

1185
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:10,220
31 out of 26,000 patent applications.

1186
01:16:10,296 --> 01:16:11,957
It wasn't what I was expecting.

1187
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:14,022
I was expecting something
on agribusiness

1188
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,591
and what
the World Trade Organization does.

1189
01:16:16,669 --> 01:16:20,264
But I'd have to say
I believe it's fairly positive

1190
01:16:20,339 --> 01:16:24,070
because I think that,
as the gentleman said,

1191
01:16:24,143 --> 01:16:27,510
the strong are getting stronger,
and the weak are getting weaker.

1192
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,411
And you can't let that keep on going.

1193
01:16:29,482 --> 01:16:31,313
Even we notice it here in Australia

1194
01:16:31,384 --> 01:16:34,979
with some of the trade arrangements
that are made.

1195
01:16:35,054 --> 01:16:37,318
If you're powerful,
you can get whatever you like,

1196
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:39,221
and if you're not, you can't.

1197
01:16:39,292 --> 01:16:42,784
The world, with the population we've got,
can't keep going that way.

1198
01:16:42,862 --> 01:16:44,454
So I think it was fairly positive,

1199
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:47,192
and I think it's a very brave decision
by an organization

1200
01:16:47,266 --> 01:16:50,758
to admit that they've been going down
the wrong track and dissolve themselves

1201
01:16:50,837 --> 01:16:54,637
and start to look for something different.
And I think it's fantastic.

1202
01:16:54,707 --> 01:16:57,039
Disparity is growing
between rich and poor.

1203
01:16:57,109 --> 01:16:59,600
The richest fifth have 80%
of the world's income,

1204
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,011
and the poorest fifth have 1%.

1205
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:04,140
This gap--we all know this figure,

1206
01:17:04,217 --> 01:17:09,814
but we don't always remember that
this gap has actually doubled since 1960.

1207
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:13,222
More and more thinkers
are therefore noting

1208
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:16,784
that there is no evidence
that liberalization favors growth

1209
01:17:16,863 --> 01:17:18,592
or benefits the poor.

1210
01:17:18,664 --> 01:17:21,326
I think we're all generally aware
of increases in poverty

1211
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,494
and low living standards and issues
faced by developing countries.

1212
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:28,734
And what Mr. Sprat had to say today
really is a terrific sign of hope

1213
01:17:28,808 --> 01:17:31,834
for what I think we all aspire to,

1214
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:35,847
and that's a global economy
that benefits all people.

1215
01:17:44,056 --> 01:17:47,958
Now, after protected, protracted,
and detailed review

1216
01:17:48,027 --> 01:17:51,793
of current trade policy,
the World Trade Organization has decided

1217
01:17:51,864 --> 01:17:54,856
to affect a cessation of all operations

1218
01:17:54,934 --> 01:17:57,425
to be accomplished
over the next four months

1219
01:17:57,503 --> 01:18:00,939
culminating by the end of September...

1220
01:18:01,007 --> 01:18:03,840
Well, I think that the Yes Men

1221
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,639
have kind of played out their course

1222
01:18:05,711 --> 01:18:08,874
in relation to the World Trade
Organization for the moment.

1223
01:18:08,948 --> 01:18:12,145
You never know when we
might get another invitation.

1224
01:18:12,218 --> 01:18:17,520
We were lucky to be able to provide a sort
of sense of closure by ending the WTO.

1225
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:20,582
We also hope that other people
will just start doing the same things

1226
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,491
in all kinds of different contexts--

1227
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:28,022
impersonating whoever holds power
that needs to be criticized.

1228
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,160
So if the opportunity arises,
we're just gonna keep doing it.

1229
01:18:31,237 --> 01:18:34,638
We're gonna go and...
be the Yes Men again,

1230
01:18:34,707 --> 01:18:37,642
or I should say,
be the WTO again in another event.

1231
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,543
The future's bright for the Yes Men.

1232
01:18:40,613 --> 01:18:44,549
The future of the world
is a different story.

1233
01:19:19,185 --> 01:19:22,586
No, this isn't the way
he usually dresses.

1234
01:19:22,655 --> 01:19:26,182
He works for the World Trade
Organization--you know, the WTO.

1235
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:29,421
He works--
see, we're at a conference,

1236
01:19:29,495 --> 01:19:33,261
and he's demonstrating
a new kind of technology.

1237
01:19:33,332 --> 01:19:38,292
This is--well, it's a device
to measure employee working

1238
01:19:38,371 --> 01:19:40,498
in less developed countries.

1239
01:19:40,573 --> 01:19:44,304
There's a thing here where...

1240
01:19:44,377 --> 01:19:48,279
on this screen I can see...

1241
01:19:48,347 --> 01:19:51,316
See, he watches people working there.

1242
01:19:51,384 --> 01:19:54,444
And they have little devices
that give them shocks.

1243
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,511
It's just regular fabric.

1244
01:19:56,589 --> 01:19:59,922
In the future,
it'll be sensitive-smart fabric.

1245
01:19:59,992 --> 01:20:01,584
It's a little hot, but...

1246
01:20:02,862 --> 01:20:04,193
That one looks better.
