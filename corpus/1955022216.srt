Wi-i-i-i-de *

397
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,900
We're just so excited that

398
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,169
You decided to sign with us,

399
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,004
Miss mamie.

400
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:04,471
Aww!

401
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,138
I know we are going to do

402
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,541
Some amazing things together.

403
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,709
I feel so blessed.

404
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:10,576
[Laughs]

405
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,543
Really, I do.

406
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,112
Girl, we are the blessed

407
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:13,480
Ones.

408
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,248
You could've signed with anyone,

409
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,984
You fresh-faced little munchkin

410
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:17,316
You!

411
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:17,749
Ooh!

412
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:18,651
[Both laugh]

413
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,686
Oh, my God! Gina!

414
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,722
Hey! Did you get my message?

415
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,056
Hi, halley.

416
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,258
Uh, yes, if you can just give me

417
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,160
A minute.

418
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,194
Oh, yeah.

419
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,230
Oh, hey, mamie!

420
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,035
Hey.

421
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:35,767
[Laughs]

422
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:36,668
Thank you.

423
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:38,138
So, I hug. We hug.

424
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:38,638
Gina.

425
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:39,371
Okay.

426
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,009
[Both laugh]

427
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,210
Now, do you need any help

428
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,410
Getting to all your meetings

429
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,078
This week?

430
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,213
Jessica can book you a car

431
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:46,613
Service.

432
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,081
Oh, no, no, no. That's fine.

433
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:48,780
Thank you. Thanks.

434
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,616
Are you sure?

435
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,416
Yeah, yeah.

436
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,551
Okay, well, if you need

437
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,684
Anything, you let me know.

438
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:53,720
[Chuckling] Okay.

439
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,621
I'm always here.

440
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,655
I have no social life.

441
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,057
Phbt!

442
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,726
[Laughter]

443
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,294
Okay. Thank you.

444
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,164
Bye, Jessica. Bye, Gina.

445
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,198
Oh, wait! I hug, we hug.

446
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,068
We're hugging? Okay.

447
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,169
I dropped my...

448
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,804
Oh, I got it! I got it!

449
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,738
Oh, my God!

450
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,341
My brother dates him.

451
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,376
The gay guy from "ugly Betty."

452
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,243
Really?

453
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,711
Michael's a client.

454
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,179
Oh, he's so sweet.

455
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,514
Ah, yeah, I know.

456
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,550
He's gonna be the man of honor

457
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,616
At my wedding.

458
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,654
Not your brother?

459
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,421
Do you want to keep it?

460
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,123
What? Oh, no, no, no.

461
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,225
No, keep it.

462
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,093
Really?

463
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:33,792
Totally.

464
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,794
Oh. Thank you.

465
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,098
Okay. Bye.

466
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:38,765
Bye!

467
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,533
Oh! She's so sweet.

468
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,269
You look beautiful!

469
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:48,307
Love you, gummer.

470
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,410
Okay, let's do this.

471
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,706
Trifles, really.

472
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,672
Um, okay.

473
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,308
So, you just signed

474
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,309
Mamie gummer?

475
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,778
She's meryl streep's daughter.

476
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,313
People say I'm the poor man's

477
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:27,614
Her.

478
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:28,380
[Chuckles]

479
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,815
Um, can you give me her e-mail?

480
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,450
Halley, nothing I said on the

481
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,419
Phone has changed.

482
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,753
"A," can I have a piece of

483
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:38,325
Your baguette?

484
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:38,758
Mmm.

485
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,760
"B," I have a really exciting

486
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,130
Movie idea that I need your help

487
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,596
With.

488
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,464
And "c," spring-clean your

489
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,766
Canvas.

490
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,535
I have eaten hundreds of dried

491
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,502
Fruits.

492
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,273
I'm sitting on the toilet with

493
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,541
Diarrhea oozing out of me

494
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,544
Slowly, like a mister softee.

495
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,379
The diarrhea...

496
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,080
Symbolic of my career.

497
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,416
The dried fruits?

498
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,786
You guessed it. That's you.

499
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,921
I was in the biggest indie of

500
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,522
The last century...

501
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,757
Noah baumbach's

502
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,725
"The squid and the whale."

503
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,895
I mean, ring-a-ding-ding-dong.

504
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,398
I know you love ding dongs.

505
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,531
Listen to me.

506
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,600
Can you listen?

507
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,534
I took a six-week course on

508
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,570
Listening with Austin Pendleton.

509
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,606
"The squid and the whale" had

510
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,441
A limited release six... or

511
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,543
Seven years ago... and you

512
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,544
Played a supporting role.

513
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,479
Um, aloha?

514
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,480
I was the only

515
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,415
Sympathy-garnering character in

516
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,385
A movie populated exclusively by

517
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,220
Narcissistic literati, little

518
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,688
Miss "I'm smarter than my"

519
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,421
Client."

520
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,190
I'm sorry.

521
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,724
I don't need to make fun of the

522
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,492
Way you think and speak to when

523
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,295
It's already obvious enough that

524
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,729
You can barely fit into that

525
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:50,330
Chair.

526
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:50,929
Aah! Sorry!

527
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,564
I haven't had a drink yet this

528
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,233
Morning.

529
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,734
No one will hire you because

530
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:55,768
You drink too much.

531
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,204
You're starting to get a

532
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:57,770
Reputation.

533
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,771
I am so sorry.

534
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,472
Have you forgotten who my father

535
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:00,773
Is?

536
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:01,140
World-famous

537
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,542
Pulitzer prize-winning satirist

538
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,543
Jules feiffer.

539
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,378
Most people don't even know

540
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:10,816
He's still alive!

541
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,319
I can get you in touch with

542
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,888
People in our h.R., and they can

543
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,692
Help you find a rehab that takes

544
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,263
Your insurance.

545
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,966
Re-hab?

546
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:27,999
[Gasps] Oh!

547
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,270
You mean like a publicity stunt.

548
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,671
I like it. I like it.

549
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,806
Halley, no.

550
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,776
Not a publicity stunt.

551
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,379
You are a great actress, and I

552
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,848
Have much faith in your talent.

553
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,351
But you have become rude and

554
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,719
Unruly and impossible to work

555
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,288
With.

556
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,988
You need to make a significant

557
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,958
Change in your life, and if you

558
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,925
Don't, I can no longer work with

559
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:54,526
You.

560
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,895
Shh! Shh, shh, shh!

561
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:56,729
Are you done?

562
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,529
Okay, great.

563
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,030
I'm gonna come in next week, and

564
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,499
We can finish this little

565
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,200
"Intervention" once I have a

566
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,336
Tasty drink under my belt.

567
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,838
I'm letting you go.

568
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,946
Fine. [Sniffles]

569
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,015
Fine.

570
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,385
You want to know why that's

571
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:18,951
Fine?

572
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,454
I'm gonna take this piss-poor

573
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,922
Attitude of yours and spin a web

574
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,491
Of gold with it!

575
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,793
I'm writing my own movie.

576
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,528
In fact, it's basically already

577
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:28,994
Written!

578
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:29,861
That's right!

579
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,497
I'm starring in it, and it's

580
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,899
Gonna get into the sanddunes

581
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,000
Screenwriters lab.

582
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,503
Oscar gold, here comes mama!

583
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:39,005
And guess who's not getting 10%?

584
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,842
Fatty McGee! And that's you!

I should have never let you

594
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,550
Into my life in the first place.

595
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,085
You don't understand how

596
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,387
Talented I am.

597
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,421
I'm gonna be the biggest movie

598
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,122
Star you ever heard of!

599
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:36,796
* throw away the key *

600
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,031
Ryan, Ryan, hey, Ryan?

601
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:41,501
I have to talk to you, like,

602
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,369
Right now, Ryan.

603
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,069
Oh, my God, Ryan.

604
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,035
Are you there, ry...

605
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:45,103
Geez, halley, what?

606
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,672
Oh, my God, I have something

607
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,974
Really important to tell you.

608
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:48,774
What? What?

609
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:49,976
What's the matter?

610
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,010
Oh, my God.

611
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,445
Ooh. Whoa. God.

612
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,381
If you didn't like sticking your

613
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,047
Penis in other boys' mouths, I

614
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:57,984
Would totally smunk your donk.

615
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,452
That's disturbing.

616
00:21:59,452 --> 00:21:59,952
Why?

617
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,320
Because you're my sister.

618
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,088
Okay, I have something

619
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,924
Vitally crucial to tell you, but

620
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,593
Before I do, do you have any

621
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,093
Alcohol?

622
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,627
Sure, I think we have

623
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,095
Something, but geez, halley,

624
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,031
It's like not even noon.

625
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,067
So, what is it? What's going on?

626
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,034
Oh, my gosh.

627
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:16,736
Hmm?

628
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,169
It's not dad, is it?

629
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,406
No, no, no.

630
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,172
I know he's like 100, but it's

631
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:21,941
Not him.

632
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,010
All right, then what is it?

633
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,677
I feel, like, nervous.

634
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,813
I kind of feel, like, sad all of

635
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,680
A sudden.

636
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,549
I know. Me too.

637
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,419
Me too.

638
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,185
Okay.

639
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:35,522
Are you ready?

640
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,187
Yeah.

641
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:38,089
Oh, don't make that face.

642
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,190
All right.

643
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,593
Throwing caution to the wind...

644
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,429
Okay.

645
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:43,729
You're so pretty.

646

[Laughs]

647
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,965
Okay. This is hard.

648
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,133
Okay, what is it?

649
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,968
All right, I'm just gonna go

650
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:49,636
For it.

651
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:50,168
Do it.

652

Look. [Laughs]

00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,590
Aah!

659
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,959
Open it. Open it.

660
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,660
It's my screenplay!

661
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,629
Aah! Can you believe it?

662
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:17,829
Open it again.

663
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,531
It's my screenplay!

664
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,901
What? Isn't that awesome?

665
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,535
Where are you going?

666
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,004
Ryan, what are you...

667
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,038
Did you see... Ryan, did you

668
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,208
See... ry... i just went through

669
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,876
My flipcam and transcribed

670
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,811
Everything that happened between

671
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,145
Me and Michael chernus.

672
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:35,781
It's gonna be next year's

674
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,518
[Sarcastically] Yay!

675
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:39,785
What are you... Ryan!

676
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,187
It took me all night and two

677
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:42,888
Pitchers of sangria to assemble

678
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,090
That genius packaging.

679
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,757
Oh, that is what you wanted

680
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,892
To talk to me about?

681
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:47,560
Yeah.

682
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,860
You made this sound so

683
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,496
Urgent!

684
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:50,896
I thought somebody had died.

685
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,532
Somebody did... my career!

686
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:53,099
Uh-huh.

687
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,200
Ryan, why are you

688
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,233
Minimalizing this?

689
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,636
I am the most pathetic

00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:01,440
That whore bag mamie gummer

Pretends that I'm a stranger

695
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,743
Even though I pole-danced for

697
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:06,878
Birthday party.

698
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,782
That was Haley Joel osment!

699
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,049
Aah! Stop correcting me,

700
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:11,583
Ryan!

701
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,952
You didn't even go to college!

702
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,521
I have been at Juilliard for

703
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:15,587
The past seven years.

704
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,923
Oh, so you're getting your

705
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:17,824
Master's in air?

706
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:18,890
That is not nice.

707
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,891
You know what?

708
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,260
Ryan, why are you doing this?

709
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,962
You always make everything about

710
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:23,696
You, Ryan.

711
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:24,631
Halley, look.

712
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:25,131
What?!

713
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,833
You have worked with the most

714
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,233
Incredible people, and you've

715
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,901
Never even had formal training.

716
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,070
I mean, I've never even had an

717
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,571
Agent.

718
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:32,772
Well, neither do I, anymore,

719
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:33,905
And I always liked that your

720
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,107
Career was worse than mine, and

721
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,242
Now I think we're on the same

722
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:37,677
Level, and that makes me want to

723
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,979
Fucking kill myself!

725
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,213
No, Ryan... this is rude!

726
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:43,815
I'm not drunk enough yet.

727
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,717
Look, halley, why do you want

728
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,252
Michael?

729
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:48,020
Why can't you just put me in

730
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,854
Your movie?

731
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,157
[Snickers]

732
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,223
How is that funny?

733
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:53,693
Ryan, you can't play my

734
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:54,193
Boyfriend.

735
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,194
You're my brother.

736
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:55,894
Halley.

737
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,327
What?

738
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,665
It is 2011.

739
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,066
Nobody cares if ice skaters are

740
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:00,732
Siblings.

[Sighs]

742
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,869
We'll just get, like, a body

743
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,236
Double for the sex scenes, and

744
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,772
If we need to kiss, we'll cut

745
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:06,738
Away or something.

746
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,074
Okay, do you really need me

747
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,240
To spell it out for you?

748
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,141
I guess I do.

749
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,777
This is very, very sad.

751
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,813
That was my blanket.

Can you read?

753
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:15,982
Yep. I can read.

754
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,618
Great.

755
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,791
Great.

756

I need somebody famous!

757
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:44,176
Okay.

758
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,812
The script is, honestly, more

759
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:47,079
About Vanessa Williams than

760
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:47,913
Anything else.

761
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:48,914
Vanessa Williams?

762
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,281
You never once mentioned she's

763
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:51,117
In the script.

764
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,151
Well, she is now.

00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,723
Maybe she could direct it?

768
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,289
There is no way America is

769
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:59,091
Available.

770
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,127
She's way too famous.

771
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,195
But actually...

772
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,963
Michael is looking to branch out

773
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:05,898
Into directing.

774
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:06,364
What?

775
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,033
The gay guy from "ugly Betty"

776
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:08,701
Directs?

777
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,001
Then I could be in it.

778
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:10,903
Oh, my God!

779
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,671
The gay guy from "ugly Betty" is

780
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,873
Gonna direct my movie?

781
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,141
I'm gonna be the best

782
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,909
Michael chernus ever.

783
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,678

I'm still biking.

787
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,015
All right, just put this on

788
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:24,651
Here.

789
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,185
Just hold that there for a

790
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,153
Minute, okay?

791
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:30,589
Okay.

792
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:40,767
[Laughs]

793
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,269
Okay.

794
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,237
Yeah, just...

795
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,338
Oh, I like that. Harder.

796
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:48,907
Mmm, smooth that.

797
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,877
Oh, yeah, it feels good.

798
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:53,145
Oh, yeah. Harder. Harder. Mmm.

799
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,180
Okay, miss feiffer...

800
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,214
Oh, you know my work?

801
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,347
No, you ask me that every

802
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:57,415
Time... I've not seen your

803
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,150
"Whale" movie.

804
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,218
Fine, fine, fine. What?

805
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,386
It's just a minor cut this

806
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,620
Time, but you should really

807
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,922
Think about cutting back on your

808
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:03,322
Drinking.

809
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,957
I wasn't drinking.

810

Beautiful brown eyes.

814

Please don't touch me.

815
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:13,966
This isn't a joke.

816
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,300
You could really hurt yourself.

817
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,069
[Smacking lips]

818
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,238

820
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,207
Will you lift me out and

821
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,473
Gingerly place me on my bike?

822
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,243
No.

I think I have vertigo.

827

I'm falling.

828
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:41,893
My bones are melting because of

00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,895
Radiation.

00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,030
I was in chernobyl.

Before I get another concussion.

Well, I think I agree with

Him.

839
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,474
You should probably cut back on

00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,408
Your drinking.

Janis joplin, Marilyn Monroe.

846
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,020
Maybe you should try drinking

Than anything, to help us with

940
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,446
This because I have had a lot of

And if we don't do this as a

944
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,583
Team, it'll never happen, and I

945
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,185
Will never amount to anything

946
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,586

And we have to make that

What... [Sighs]

963
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,007
Well, what do you have to do for

964
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:16,641
The deadline?

965
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,177
Um, the first 10 pages of

00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:19,678
Your script, a letter of intent,

967
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:22,481
And, to set ours apart, we want

We'll see how that goes, and

982
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,432
Then we'll move from there,

983
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,000
Okay?

984

Text me if you're lonely.

995
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,050
What are you doing for

996
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,118
Thanksgiving?

997
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:01,252
Why did he say that was your

998
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:01,920
Last 911 visit?

999
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,423
I think he has a drinking

1000
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,257
Problem.

1001
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,158
It's really sad, actually.

1002

00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:11,497

Oh, my God, I haven't seen

You since the show ended.

1009
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,572

1018
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,123
Does he ever... Ask about me?

1019
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,157
No, halley.

1020
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,126
His experience on Broadway with

1021
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,660
You was not very positive.

1022
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,427
Okay.

1023
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,429

What's up with your face?

1027

Um, it's for a part.

1028
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:52,538
Are you gonna meet Ben stiller

1029
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,073
Right now, by any chance?

Thank you!

1063
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:36,715
Who are you texting?

1064
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,184

[Gasps]

1067
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,552
I know... but he says he's

1068
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,819
Not coming to dinner now that

1069
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:42,654
You've crashed.

1070
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:43,388
What?

1071
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,256
Well, halley, the last time

1072
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,857
You saw him, you asked him if

1073
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,794
You could make a semen milkshake

1074
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:49,795
With his seed.

1075
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:52,598
I make a really good shake.

1076
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,166
But regardless, did you ask him

1077
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,567
If he wants a life-changing role

1078
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,334
In my movie?

[Cellphone beeps]

1080
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,637
Yeah, he said his eardrums

1081
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,206
Were clicking last night, so he

1082
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,506
Didn't get much sleep, so he

1083
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:02,040
Can't do the movie.

1084

You know, they do say that the

1099
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:32,871
First step to recovery is

1100
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,573
Actually admitting that you have

1101
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,306

Now.

1123
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,825
I could really use a friend to

1124
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,760
Share all this bounty with.

Anywho... [Laughs]

1127
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,633
I was just having a drink and

1128
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,933
Thinking of you.

1130
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,338

In between setups on

1132
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,741
"The squid and the whale."

1133
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,643
That must seem like a million

1134
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,645
Years ago for you... you've done

1135
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,414
So many movies since then.

1136
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:52,218
But, um...

1137
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:53,719
Sometimes when things are really

1138
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,952
Good, you can feel really

1139
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:59,490
Lonely.

1140
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,260
I wonder if that's how you felt

1141
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,962
On Oscar night.

1142
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,999
I hope it isn't, but, um...

1143
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,735
If it is, I just want you to

1144
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:13,704
Know...

1145

00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:20,746
Anyway. [Laughs]

1147
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:24,916
That's all. I love you.

1148

[Indistinct conversations]

1150
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,524
Are you okay?

1151
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,893
Oh, yeah, totally.

1152
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,427
Um, so, now that the

1153
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,496
Stillmeister is out, who's gonna

1154
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,431
Play Ryan's part in my movie?

1155
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,401
Tracee, we have to get someone

1156
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,835
More famous than Ryan.

1157
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,636
I mean, can you imagine walking

1158
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,373
Down the street and passing a

1159
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,039
Movie poster with Ryan's face on

1160
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:49,540
It?

1161
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,041
Ew! No one would go see that

1162
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:51,676
Movie.

1163
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,444
Let me lob this idea to you

1164
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,679
And see what you buy.

1165
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,348
In exchange for an executive

1166
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,883
Producer credit, how would it

1167
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,684
Tickle you if I were to contact

1168
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,220

No! [Crying]

1186
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,384
That was a dramatization of my

1187

Favorite scene from

1188
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,519

"Harry and the Hendersons," and

1229

She said that John lithgow does

1230
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:16,722
Coke on all his sets.

Does coke in the middle of

1234
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:21,860
Scenes while they're filming,

1235

1246
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,858

1265
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,955

Isn't that rad?

1291
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,629
No. Shut the front door.

1292
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,532
Wait. Tracee didn't tell you

1293
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:08,233
That Ben stiller is subsidizing

1294
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:12,670

1299
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,611
Just love it if, you know, for

1300
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,246
The rest of today, you could...

1301
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,948
You could really try to stay

1302
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,784

1303
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,184

It is. It's very exciting.

1310
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,694
And I think that you and I

1311
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:37,162
Should, um, you know, be able to

1312
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,096
Trust each other.

1313
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,296

00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:58,123
Halley?

1708
00:50:58,123 --> 00:50:59,889
I need to talk to you a mano

1709
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:00,725

1710
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,392

1712
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,230
I'll be right down.

1713
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:22,447
Hi, halley.

1714
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:28,518
How are you?

1715
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,588
Wow. You look really pretty.

1716
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,356
I know I do.

1717
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:35,193
Now shut your bloated face and

1718
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:37,795
Listen carefully to the words

1719
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:40,365
Spilling from my silvery lips.

1720
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,603

[Exhales deeply]

1725
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,946
I thought you were mad at me!

1726
00:51:56,946 --> 00:51:58,915
How could little old me be

1727
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:02,287
Mad at such a ravishing acorn?

1728
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:05,223
You secured funding for my film

1729
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:09,559
By extortionating Ben stiller.

1730
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,929
I have never seen such

1731
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:13,931

Ah!

1736
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:22,507
The word "no" does not exist

1737
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:23,773
In your dojo.

1738
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:24,675
Ahh.

1739
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:26,511
Mmm.

1740
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:30,648
Tastes like a fairy do.

1741
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,683
You made this film a priority

1742
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:36,287
Against all odds.

1743
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,356
You set your eyes on the prize,

1744
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:40,390
And you didn't let go until the

1745
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,293
Fat lady sang, and you don't

1746
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:43,728
Even know how to sing.

1747

1748
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,431
Mmm!

[Both gasp]

1751
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,901
Hollywood? Ha ha!

1752
00:52:51,901 --> 00:52:54,839
More like halleywood.

1753
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:55,972
Ah!

1754
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,476
And it's all thanks to you.

1755

1757
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,784
Can we go upstairs?

1758
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:08,352
Oh, I can't.

1759
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,619
I just can't.

1760
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,787
Oh, yes.

1761
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,722
I can't. I just...

1762
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,693
Yes. Oui.

1763
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:16,860
Ohh! Yes!

1764
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,762
I can't!

1765

[Door closes]

1770
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:26,504
You want some coffee?

1771
00:53:26,504 --> 00:53:27,604
Um, do you have half and

1772
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:27,904
Half?

1773
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:28,905
No, just almond milk.

1774
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,275
That's fine. Two splendas.

1775
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:31,408
So Michael and Ryan say we

1776
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,377
Can't resume principal

Off-Broadway.

1788
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,054
Do you think she'd be willing to

1789
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:45,756
Do our movie?

1790
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:46,956
On it... totally on the

Appearance.

1796

Wait. What... what's going on?

2272
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:09,666
Technical difficulties.

2273
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:10,399
Holding.

2274
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:11,200
Halley.

2275
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,068
Holding.

2276
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:14,137
[Groans]

2277
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,504
Babe, just don't waste your

2278
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:16,172
Breath.

2279
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,240
She's not worth it.

2280
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,641
She's clearly mentally ill.

2281
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,210
Okay, alcoholics are the

2282
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,578
Elite of the mentally ill.

2283
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:22,212
Hey.

2284
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:23,713
The gay guy from "ugly Betty."

2285
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:24,747
I worked with you.

2286
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:25,614
Hi, Ralph.

2287
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,116
I can't believe that I

2288
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:27,750
Trusted you.

2289
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,418
I worked really hard on this.

2290
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,356
This was gonna be our chance.

2291
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:34,058
My one chance.

2292
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:37,226
Oh, Ryan.

2293
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:39,728
You can't make an omelet if you

2294
01:06:39,728 --> 01:06:42,166
Don't even have a chicken.

2295
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:44,101
And one day, you will be a

2296
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:44,733
Chicken.

2297
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:46,503
I can promise you that.

2298
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,505
But right now, you're more like

2299
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,239
A tiny, preemie, chickety

2300
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,176
Thingie that was ripped out of

2301
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:54,078
The uterus of a raped preteen

2302
01:06:54,078 --> 01:06:56,080
Chicken who shouldn't have been

2303
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,413
Having a baby anyway.

2304
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,814
I can be a chicken.

2305
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,816
Babe, babe, don't waste your

2306
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:01,551
Breath.

2307
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:04,020
Just let it g...

2308
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,755
Oh, no, Michael!

2309
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,091
Where are you going?

2310
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:08,358
We have a movie to make.

2311
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,094
I mean, I scored Ralph macchio.

2312
01:07:10,094 --> 01:07:11,395
I scored a bona fide teen

2313
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:12,195
Heartthrob.

2314
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,630
Halley.

2315
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,833
Celebrities don't make a movie

2316
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:17,601
Great.

2317
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,137
Heart is what makes a movie

2318
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:20,803
Great.

2319
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:24,307
And you have no heart.

2320
01:07:24,307 --> 01:07:26,675
[Scoffs]

2321
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,311
[Sighs]

2322
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:30,114
I'm sorry, everybody, but that's

2323
01:07:30,114 --> 01:07:30,414
It.

2324
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:32,216
Sorry for wasting your time, but

2325
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:33,816
You can go ahead and pack it up.

2326
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,184
This movie's wrapped.

2327
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:35,684
What?

2328
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,385
Yeah.

2329
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,187
Wrapped?

2330
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:39,256
No. Wait...

2331
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:41,424
No, guys, that's fine, because

2332
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,627
We still have Ralph macchio, so

2333
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:45,695
I'll just make my movie with

2334
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:46,462
Ralph!

2335
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:47,264
Right, Ralph?

2336
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:48,565
I will snap you in half.

2337
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:49,465
Did you ever see

2338
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:50,399
"The karate kid"?

2339
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,534
I mean, all the action

2340
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:52,236
Sequences?

2341
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:52,901
Just like that.

2342
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:58,807
Just like... huh?

2343
01:07:58,807 --> 01:08:00,244
You know what?

2344
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:02,146
This is all tracee's fault!

2345
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:03,812
She's the one ruining this

2346
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:04,080
Movie, not me!

2347
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,217
It was her idea to replace Ryan

2348
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:08,551
With Ralph macchio!

2349
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,420
Halley!

2350
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,660
[Grunts]

2351
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,395
Tracee.

2352
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:19,896
No, tracee, i...

2353
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:21,297
No! [Sobs]

2354
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,832
All right, well...

2355
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,768
[Chuckles]

2356
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:25,934
I was in

2357
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:27,803
"The squid and the whale."

2358
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,221
* hushabye *

2359
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:45,554
* now it's time

2360
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:49,259
To close your little eyes *

2361
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:51,494
* I apologize

2362
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:55,665
If I forgot to say good night *

2363
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:57,366
* it's dreamy time *

2364
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,868
* and we can find a brand-new

* where everyone is nice *

2367
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,176
* and we can fly *

2368
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:19,588
What?

2369
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:24,593
Ugh.

2370
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,996
Halley.

2371
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:30,900
Halley.

2372
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:34,503
Huh.

2373
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,506
Natasha?

2374
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,876
[Chuckles]

2375
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:41,678
So, I guess you drank.

2376
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:42,746
Oh, my God.

2377
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:43,979
Nata... i... whoa.

2378
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,849
I can't even believe you're

2379
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:46,515
Here.

2380
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:47,416
Thank God.

2381
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,917
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

2382
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,687
Do you think you can

2383
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:53,323
Convincingly portray the role of

2384
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:55,725
My ex-boyfriend Michael chernus

2385
01:09:55,725 --> 01:10:00,629
In my movie?

2386
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,030
Let's put this barleycorn

2387
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:02,598
Down.

2388
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:04,200
Why don't we go downstairs and

2389
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,602
Natasha, I don't have time

2390
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:07,404
For coffee.

2391
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:09,372
The sanddunes screenwriters lab

2392
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:10,907
Deadline is in three days.

2393
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:11,908
All right.

2394
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:13,909
Put the screenwriters lab on the

2395
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:15,612
Back burner for a second.

2396
01:10:15,612 --> 01:10:17,046
If you don't want coffee, we can

2397
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,481
Get you a nice green juice

2398
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:19,648
Maybe, kale smoothie...

2399
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:20,317
Pffft!

2400
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:20,950
Kale smoothie?

2401
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,485
Spinach with lemon ginger,

2402
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:23,520
Some cayenne pepper.

2403
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,553
I don't think so.

2404
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,688
I think I'd rather die.

2405
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:27,324
Yeah, well, if you keep this

2406
01:10:27,324 --> 01:10:28,458
Shit up, you might die!

2407
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:29,425
What are you...

2408
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,895
Natasha, I don't have a drinking

2409
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:32,829
Problem!

2410
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:34,331
[Chuckles]

2411
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:35,631
I went to your 12-step

2412
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,000
Meeting, and you guys were

2413
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,335
Really, really nice.

2414
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,503
It's a little boring.

2415
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:41,004
And now my break from drinking

2416
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:42,406
Is done, and I'm fine.

2417
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:43,373
Obviously. Look.

2418
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:44,007
[Chuckles]

2419
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:44,941
I'm drinking.

2420
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:46,343
Nothing's happening.

2421
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:47,976
So, thank you so much for your

2422
01:10:47,976 --> 01:10:48,577
Help.

2423
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,479
But just because you can't drink

2424
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:51,980
Anymore doesn't mean that I

2425
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,882
Can't, okay?

2426
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:54,451
Is this how you drink?

2427
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:55,919
Do you want to smell the

2428
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:56,585
Bottle?

2429
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,355
Get that shit away from me.

2430
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,023
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2431
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:00,623
Hey.

2432
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,691
Back in the '90s, I was supposed

2433
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:04,260
To be the Sundance kid, but I

2434
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,862
Was too boozed up.

2435
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:06,896
That's you!

2436
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,697
I'm different and younger!

2437
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,600
We were all younger.

2438
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,801
Hey, if you want my help, you

2439
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,671
Know where to find me.

2440
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:16,872
If not, good luck, all right?

2441
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:17,906
Oh, break a leg!

2442
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,442
What? Is this a fucking

2443
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,910
Important movie?

2444
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,679
No, nata... okay, Natasha.

2445
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,548
Come on, Natasha.

2446
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:37,427
Natasha.

2447
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:38,694
Oh, fuck!

2448
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,564
Ow.

2449
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:03,387
Yeah?

2450
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:08,123
I need help.

2451
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:11,760
That's a start.

2452
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,530
It's gonna be all right.

2453
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,032
Thank you.

2454
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,135
Okay.

01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:21,905
* we'll be starstruck and

2456
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:23,640
Sunblind *

And an accompanist?

2647
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,299
Yeah, and three tea cups?

2648
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,200
[Chuckles] No.

2649
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,368
No, we don't have tea cups.

2650
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:53,169
That is fine.

2651
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:54,203
We will do it a capella.

2652
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:54,771
Okay.

2653
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:55,839
Do you want to loosen up?

2654
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,404
Yeah, yeah.

2655
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:57,105
All right.

2656
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:57,774
Here we go.

2657
01:17:57,774 --> 01:17:58,140
Okay.

2658
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,275
Okay, I'm gonna drop you

2659
01:17:59,275 --> 01:17:59,975
Down, ready?

2660
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:00,976
Get down on your knees.

2661
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:01,344
Okay.

2662
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,510
Okay, I'm gonna push your

2663
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:03,011
Head.

2664
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:03,747
Push it in.

2665
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:04,680
All right.

2666
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:09,484
[Both groan]

2667
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:10,253
Okay.

And a-five, and a-six, and

2669
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,789
A-five, six, seven, eight.

That's a wrap!

2683
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:41,284
[Notes play]

2684
01:18:41,284 --> 01:18:42,852
Both: * then it's dramatic *

All! All!

2705

Fish her in.

2706
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:23,959
Fish her in.

2707
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:24,928
Fish her in.

2708

[Chuckles]

2711
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,007
Bang!

2712
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,075
Okay, that's it.

2713
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,509
Aah! [Laughs] Thank you!

2714
01:19:41,509 --> 01:19:42,577
Thank you, guys.

2715
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:44,047
Thank you. Thank you.

2716
01:19:44,047 --> 01:19:44,579
Thank you.

2717
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:45,414
[Laughs]

2718
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,015
Thank you. Thank you.

2719
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:48,351
[Chuckling] I'm sorry.

2720
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:50,585
I'm completely confused here.

2721
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:51,153
Um...

2722
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:52,187
Yeah, me, too.

2723
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:53,556
I'm not sure what it is you

2724
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:54,156
Want.

2725
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:55,491
I mean, I don't mean to be

2726
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,192
Dense, but what... what is the

2727
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:57,994
Movie idea?

2728
01:19:57,994 --> 01:20:00,528
I don't... i don't get it.

2729
01:20:00,528 --> 01:20:02,431
Um... I got it.

2730
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:07,536
Yeah, it's basically about...

2731
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:10,306
A girl in the ballet, and she

2732
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:13,209
Has to play two different kinds

2733
01:20:13,209 --> 01:20:16,179
Of swans, and one is really nice

2734
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:19,081
And sweet, and the other's very

2735
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:20,482
Dark and sexy.

2736
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:24,420
And how does she play both,

2737
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,288
Basically.

2738
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:30,092
Halley...

2739
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:31,427
Okay, you're right.

2740
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:32,361
[Chuckles]

2741
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:34,931
That song has nothing to do with

2742
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:36,199
Our movie idea.

2743
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:38,133
No, Ryan's right.

2744
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:38,935
Yeah.

2745
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:42,237
Oh, my God.

2746
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,440
Yeah, my whole life I've just

2747
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,509
Been trying to do the least

2748
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:48,444
Amount of work possible.

2749
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:49,946
Trying to trick people into

2750
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:51,114
Giving me things I don't

2751
01:20:51,114 --> 01:20:54,182
Deserve.

2752
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,052
Do you want to talk to her?

2753
01:20:56,052 --> 01:20:56,619
Yeah.

2754
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,186
Um, again, I don't mean to be

2755
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:59,455
Obtuse, but I think we're

2756
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:00,990
Probably all just wondering.

2757
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:04,860
What... what is the movie?

2758
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,962
We don't know.

2759
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:06,628
We don't know.

2760
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:07,563
We have no idea.

2761
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:08,231
Yeah.

2762
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:09,632
We're totally unprepared for

2763
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,166
This meeting, and it really

2764
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,635
Breaks my heart because I have

2765
01:21:12,635 --> 01:21:14,270
[Voice breaking] Dreamed about

2766
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:18,207
This moment my whole life.

2767
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,142
You know what, Ryan?

2768
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:21,177
It's okay.

2769
01:21:21,177 --> 01:21:23,278
Let's go.

2770
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:29,118
We finally have humility.

2771
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:30,486
Uh, okay. Goodbye.

2772
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:32,020
Halley, thanks a lot.

2773
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,889
Bye, Ryan.

2774
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:42,465
Have a good flight.

2775
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:44,400
So, that's it?

2776
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,569
Yeah, you're not gonna try to

2777
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:47,403
Stop us?

2778
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,572
Oh, no, I think we've got it.

2779
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:50,305
Yeah.

2780
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:51,440
Yeah. Thank you.

2781
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,409
I'm not sure exactly what we

2782
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:54,010
Got.

2783
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:54,543
Jesse.

2784
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:56,278
[Chuckles] Yeah. I know.

2785
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:56,711
Sorry.

2786
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:58,514
I'm... I'm not really sure what

2787
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:00,083
It is you want us to say.

2788
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:03,686
I don't know.

2789
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:04,920
Don't forget your keyboard

2790
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:11,526
Application.

2791
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:12,495
Ryan.

2792
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:13,997
I don't know.

2793
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:15,664
Bye. Good luck.

2794
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:17,532
Great energy.

2795
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,010
Hey, guys.

2796
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:28,444
Hey, wait up.

2797
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,578
Listen, before you go, for

2798
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:33,081
Whatever it's worth, you both

2799
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,217
Seem to have such a unique

2800
01:22:35,217 --> 01:22:37,685
Connection, and I think maybe if

2801
01:22:37,685 --> 01:22:40,288
You looked into that, you might

2802
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:45,594
Have an interesting story.

2803
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:46,562
Whoa. Whoa. Okay.

2804
01:22:46,562 --> 01:22:47,429
Oh. All right.

2805
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:48,430
Okay. Thanks, guys.

2806
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,565
Whoa, thank you, Ryan.

2807
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:50,633
Thank you, Jesse.

2808
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:51,567
Thanks. Okay.

2809
01:22:51,567 --> 01:22:52,568
Thank you so much.

2810
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:54,103
Really, it's time to go now.

2811
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:54,802
Oh, come on.

2812
01:22:54,802 --> 01:22:56,438
Shut up, Facebook.

2813
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:58,241
That's cute. Thank you. Okay.

2814
01:22:58,241 --> 01:22:58,674
Thanks.

2815
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:00,109
No, no. Don't do that.

2816
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:00,509
Oh.

2817
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:02,745
Okay. Thanks. Okay.

2818
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:04,113
Hey, halley, come here for a

2819
01:23:04,113 --> 01:23:06,649
Second.

2820
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,484
I still think you're cool, okay?

2821
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,284
All right.

2822
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:10,319
[Chuckles]

2823
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,188
Now get out of here, scamp.

2824
01:23:22,565 --> 01:23:26,434
So, Michael chernus, the last

2825
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:28,403
Part of my ninth-step amends is

2826
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,838
Something that is really, really

2827
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:35,178
Difficult to tell you.

2828
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:39,548
A year ago, i... Violated your

2829
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:44,620
Privacy in a major way by, um,

2830
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:47,123
Turning the intimate details of

2831
01:23:47,123 --> 01:23:49,491
