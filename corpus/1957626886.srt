1
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,669
(Upbeat music playing)

2
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,213
Hi, glenda.

3
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,517
Sorry.

4
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,528
I'm early!

5
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,398
My god, it's a miracle.

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,432
(Chuckles)

7
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,574
Did she pay
for last week?

8
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,843
She did
when I reminded her.

9
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,446
(Coughing)

10
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,215
Sorry, glenda.
Sorry.

11
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:11,697
Hi, Geoffrey.

12
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,402
Hey, mavis,
I've been working
on this all week!

13
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,638
(Scatting) Ball change.

14
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,672
Mavis: Excellent!

15
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,241
(Women giggling)

16
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,418
(Sneezes)

17
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,488
Hi, Dorothy.

18
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,290
Sorry, mavis.
It's the pollen.

19
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,224
Mavis: I know.

20
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,328
Okay, there,
there, there...
You go around...

21
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,832
Then you clap again.
Oh!

22
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,901
Mavis: Ah, Sylvia,
you didn't practice,
did you?

23
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:49,735
Sylvia: I know... I know...

24
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,341
Excuse me.

25
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:02,498
Is this the tap class?

26
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,515
Oh, my god.
It's Princess di.

27
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,851
Hi, I'm mavis.
I run the class.

28
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:06,952
Can I help you?

29
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,287
Am I too late to join?

30
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,290
No. (Chuckling)

31
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,725
Let me just
sign you up.
Uh...

32
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,693
Have you taken
any tap before?

33
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:19,231
Well, I did start
another class, yes,

34
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,633
but to be perfectly honest,
I didn't like the teacher.

35
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,203
Are you English?

36
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,671
How did you know?

37
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,972
(Chuckling)
Uh, lucky guess.

38
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,807
Oh, gee. I thought
I'd lost my accent.

39
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:29,841
(Chuckles)

40
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:31,510
Mrs... Miss...

41
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,679
Mrs. Andrews.
Mrs.

42
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,847
Mrs. Lionel Andrews.

43
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,584
Andrews, Lionel.

44
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:39,451
All right.
And what should
we call you?

45
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,453
Oh, yes. Vera.

46
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,655
Okay, Vera. Yeah.

47
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,624
Welcome to class.

48
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,893
Now, it's $10
for every lesson

49
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,261
and you can
pay Mrs. Fraser
after the class.

50
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,463
And, uh,
I was wondering

51
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,731
how many there were
in the class?

52
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:55,867
Oh, not too many,
just about
the right amount.

53
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,604
They're like flies.

54
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,805
They come out
in the summer

55
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,005
and then they just
disappear in the winter.

56
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,243
(Chuckling) Right.

57
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,278
And, uh, is that
where we get changed?

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,247
Yes, uh, I'll have
Sylvia you show...

59
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,682
No, no, no, no.
That's all right.
I can manage.

60
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,583
I'll just get rid
of these for you.

61
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,252
Thanks.

62
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,887
Thanks a lot, Vera.

63
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,497
Good evening, Rose.
Nice of you to join US.

64
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,567
If that...

65
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,303
If that boy of mine
would get himself
a job instead of...

66
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,571
I'm sorry, mavis.

67
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,506
You know I hate
being late for class.

68
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,907
Don't worry about it, honey.
I'm just glad you're here.

69
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:39,678
Mavis:
All right, come down
towards the mirror.

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,746
Sorry, Andy.

71
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,481
Thanks, lynne.

72
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,715
Come towards the mirror,
everyone.

73
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,954
Okay, just...
Dorothy, put the bag down.
You won't need it.

74
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,006
Just put it down.

75
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,057
Geoffrey, how would you
like to come to the front
of the class, huh?

76
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,526
All right,
just switch with Dorothy.

77
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,727
All right...

78
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,829
Mrs. Fraser,
whenever you are ready.

79
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,431
We're gonna start
with the warm up
we did last week.

80
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,799
Fabbo.

81
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,067
Okay, everybody,
here we go.

82
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,436
Mrs. Fraser,
whenever you're ready.

83
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,437
Do you remember
what it was?

84
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,006
It's tap, tap, tap, tap,

85
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,342
step, hop, step,
flap, ball change.

86
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,377
Tap, tap, from the ankle,

87
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,546
step, hop step,
flap, ball change.

88
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,349
Flap, heel,
stamp, ball change.
Flap, heel...

89
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,384
Oh, hi, Vera...
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,486
Vera, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Vera.

91
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,754
So, sorry to keep
you waiting, everyone.

92
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,523
That's okay.
Okay, here we go.

93
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,891
Flap, heel, stamp...

94
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,309
Vera, would you like
to stand in the back

95
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,726
so maybe
you can pick it up
a little quicker.

96
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,696
You know...
Don't worry about it.

97
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,897
If you get it wrong,
you're not gonna
get fired.

98
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,732
It's not an audition.

99
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,500
All right.
Whenever you're ready,
Mrs. Fraser.

100
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,835
I'm just sorting
my music.

101
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,841
Glenda, it's just
that Patrick got US
a gig tonight.

102
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,876
You know, I'd like
to get out of here
as soon as I can.

103
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,713
Don't blame me.
I'm always ready.

104
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,582
Yeah. Right.

105
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,584
(Chuckling) Okay...

106
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,889
(Whispering) There's some
very peculiar writing
on the bathroom wall.

107
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,726
That's not US.
Cub scouts.

108
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,563
Five, six, seven and...

109
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,898
Toe, toe, toe, toe,

110
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,667
step, hop, step,
flap, ball change.

111
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,968
Good.

112
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,670
From the ankle, Geoffrey.

113
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,139
Step, hop, step,
flap, ball change.

114
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,441
Flap, heel, step,
ball change.
(Playing lilting tune)

115
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,543
Flap, heel, step,
ball change.

116
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,479
Flap, heel, flap, hold.

117
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,086
Follow, Rose.
(Chuckling)

118
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,721
All right,
light on your
feet everybody.

119
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,989
Very good.

120
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,023
Very good.

121
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,932
Flap, heel,
flap, ball change,

122
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:41,900
flap, ball change.

123
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,772
Step, hop, step,
flap, ball change.

124
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:52,944
<i> ¶ You treat me coldly</i>

125
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,013
how we doing over here?

126
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,682
<i> ¶ Each day of the year</i>

127
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:05,157

<i> ¶ ...mean to...</i>

133
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,640
Well, you're right.
It is.

Let's hear it

138
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,738
<i> ¶ You shouldn't</i>
<i> because can't you see</i>

143

(scatting)

144
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,199
(Crowd cheering)

145
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,571
Goodnight and god bless.

146
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,706
(Crowd cheering)

147
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,756
They want US to do more.

148
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,091
They don't deserve you.
You're too good for them.

149
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,628
Yeah, uh...

150
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,200
Honey, I was
doing something

151
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,102
on the end of
the last song tonight
that I kinda liked.

152
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,137
But the end of
the second chorus
is all wrong.

153
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,139
What?
You mean the riff?

154
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,307
It's too much.
You don't need
to add anything.

155
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,175
Uh-uh.

156
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,244
(Stuttering)
It felt right.
You know with the...

157
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,180
No, but you're right,
it's wrong. It's wrong?

158
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,649
It's right.
I'll just go back
to the old way.

159
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,783
Do it the way
I told you to do it.

160
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,617
Yeah.
(Knocking on door)

161
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,052
Come in.

162
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,155
Hi, kids. Great set.

163
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,557
Thanks, Jerry.

164
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,692
And you...
You are really good.

165
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,594
Mavis: Thank you.

166
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,329
And believe me,
I know quality.

167
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,997
And the people out there,
they loved you.
My people.

168
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,832
Well, Patrick...

169
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,701
Hey, listen,
I want you to
come back next week

170
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,769
and play Saturday
night for me.

171
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,004
What do you say?

172
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,306
Yeah, well,
we'll let you know.

173
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,174
Great. Love you.

174
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,943
Um, Jerry,
what about our
money for tonight?

175
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,012
Just pop by the office
and pick up the cash.

176
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,647
And do an
encore next time,
will you, buddy?

177
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:44,983
Catch you.
Thanks.

178
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,352
(Door closing)

179
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,056
Creep!

180
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:51,823
Yeah, but at least
he's a creep

181
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,625
who wants US
to come back
next Saturday.

182
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,826
I'm doing him
a favor, okay?

183
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,695
Okay.

184
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,802
How's your throat?
Fine.

185
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,671
Where's your scarf?

186
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:08,974
I lost it in Pittsburgh.

187
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,643
Jesus, mavis.

188
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,014
Are you going to
take care of yourself
or what?

189
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,260
Uh.
(Giggling)

190
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,331
Mavis:
That was a good set.

191
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,699
(Patrick laughing)

192
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,410
(Mouthing)

193
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,154
It just seems like
nowadays there are fewer
and fewer buses, right?

194
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,322
Yeah.

195
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,225
I mean, the weather's
not that bad right now,

196
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,393
but later on...

197
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:02,861
Oh, I know, I just...

198
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,829
I just hate
waiting for the bus
in the snow

199
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,232
but sometimes I have to
when my husband
takes the car.

200
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,335
He's traveling
right now.

201
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,171
He's in sales.

202
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,073
Aluminum products.

203
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,041
Aluminum, huh?

204
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,410
Do you live
on hartington?

205
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,179
(Stuttering)
I live on bedford.

206
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,715
Uh, it's just off,
well, off hartington.

207
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,050
Oh, yeah.

208
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,952
I was just asking you
because I...

209
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,220
I thought I saw
you walking there
the other night.

210
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,288
Really?

211
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,276
Thursday.

212
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,393
(Stuttering)
Do you live
on hartington?

213
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,128
No, no, I just go
to the methodist
church there.

214
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,898
Is it choir practice?

215
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,032
Pardon?

216
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,802
Uh, Thursday,
the methodist church.

217
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,371
No, no, I don't sing.

218
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,139
I just work
in their kitchen.

219
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,341
Cooking for the homeless.

220
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,243
Really?
Yeah, we make lunch
for them every day,

221
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,211
including holidays.

222
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,914
I'm the, uh...

223
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,049
I'm the meal planner.
Really?

224
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,485
Well, I try to make
every meal nutritious,

225
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,153
well balanced, yet fun.

226
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,790
Well, I think
that's a true gift.

227
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,858
Making a meal like that.
I mean, it's...

228
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,227
It's better than singing.
(Laughs)

229
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,430
(Humming)

230
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,507
(Flushing)

231
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,387
He's very brave, Andy,
isn't he, Geoffrey?

232
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,356
Being the only man
amongst all US girls.

233
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,026
I mean, he must
feel very awkward
at times.

234
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,262
I wonder
why he comes?

235
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,031
Maybe you should ask him.

236
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,367
Oh!

237
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,869
I already have.
He says he enjoys it.
(Laughs)

238
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,204
Well...

239
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,539
Well, yes, possibly.

240
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,810
You know
his wife left him,
don't you?

241
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,078
I mean I suppose
that's why he's here.

242
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,446
I suppose
he enjoys the company.

243
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,114
You know...

244
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,916
Oh, yes.
I hope you
don't mind

245
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,185
but I've been
meaning to ask you

246
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,254
what is Andy
short for?

247
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,523
Oh, it isn't short
for anything.

248
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,957
It's long for Ann.

249
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,992
Excuse me.

250
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,796
Oh!

251
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,336
Step, shuffle,
ball change, stamp.

252
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,972
Step, shuffle,
ball change, stamp.

253
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,475
Cross, turn, clap, clap.

254
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,377
Cross turn, flap,
ball change...

255
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,880
All right?
Let's try it.
Let's try it.

256
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,415
Nice and easy.
Mrs. Fraser.

257
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,818
Same tempo as last week.
Here we go.

258
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,353
Five, six, seven, eight...

259
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,056
(Fast-paced music playing)

260
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,195
Okay, hold it, hold it.

261
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,167
All right, let's take
it again it from the top,
all right?

262
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,468
A little slower
this time, glenda.
Okay?

263
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,039
Five, six, seven, eight!

264
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,208
(Fast-paced music playing)

265
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,212
Hold it.

266
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,080
Glenda! Glenda!

267
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,483
It's too fast.

268
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:16,020
It's exactly the way
it was last week.

269
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,389
Maxine: Uh, no.

270
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,058
I mean, it was
slower last week.

271
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,227
Uh, it doesn't
affect me but...

272
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,529
It was definitely slower.
Definitely.

273
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,331
Dorothy:
Definitely, yes.

274
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:28,900
Wasn't it, Geoffrey?
Wouldn't you say?

275
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,438
(Stuttering) Oh...
I... at the last...
It was a little...

276
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,343
You were playing it
too fast, dear.

277
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,379
Anyone else?

278
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,382
You? Don't you
have any suggestions?

279
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,386
No, I...

280
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,954
All right.
This is going
to be the one.

281
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:50,655
Here we go, glenda.

282
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:55,326
And five, six,
seven, eight!

283
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,428
Step, shuffle,
ball change.
(Plays slow tempo)

284
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,372
It's ridiculous.

285
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,573
Glenda! Glenda!

286
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,247
What's the matter with you?
It's too slow.

287
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,616
You just said
it was too fast.

288
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,551
Yeah, well,
now I'm saying
it's too slow.

289
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,558
No doubt,

290
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,193
when you make
up your mind

291
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,561
you will let me know.

292
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,471
Uh-huh...

293
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,173
Take it through,
will you, lynne?

294
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,174
Yes.

295
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:44,709
Glenda...

296
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,178
I'm sorry.
Look, it was my fault.

297
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:52,334
I don't have to do this.

298
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:53,251
I have my social security
and my pension.

299
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,455
The money you
are paying, remember?

300
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,624
I was the only one
who answered your ad.

301
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,960
Yes. I know that.

302
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,661
Look, I've just been
under some financial
stress lately.

303
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,063
Glenda, i'm...

304
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,233
No excuse for
bad manners, right?
(Chuckles)

305
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:12,971
Glenda, I can't do
this without you.

306
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,605
Come on.

307
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,075
(Clicks tongue)

308
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,610
Come on. I need you.

309
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,149
Mrs. Fraser,
whenever you're ready.

310
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,354
Five, six, seven, eight.

311
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,356
Step, shuffle,
ball change, step.

312
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,291
Step, shuffle,
ball change, step.

313
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,593
Cross, turn, clap, clap,

314
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,996
cross, turn, flap,
ball change.

315
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,731
Step, shuffle,
ball change, step.

316
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,000
Step, shuffle,
ball change, step.

317
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,368
Cross, turn, clap, clap...

318
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,641
Pam leichner...

319
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,076
First floor offices.
That way, please.

320
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,211
Thank you.

321
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,095
(Giggles)

322
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,364
(Woman instructing)

323
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,169
Woman: One, two,
three, four, five, six...

324
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,115
(Knocking on door)

325
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,417
Yes, come in.

326
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,153
Ah!

327
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,621
Yes, hello.
Mavis Turner.

328
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:37,789
Mavis, how are you?

329
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,290
Good.

330
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,392
No, really.
How are you?

331
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,628
Good.

332
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,296
How's the tap
class going?

333
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,065
Good.
It's small, but good.

334
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,534
So you're sticking
with it?
Yeah.

335
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,701
Good for you.

336
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,105
(Sighing)

337
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,275
Well...
(Clears throat)

338
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,385
Well...

339
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,488
You're probably wondering
why I've asked you here.

340
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,157
I'm taking away
all your business

341
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:13,858
and you want
to buy me off.
(Chuckling)

342
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,363
I think it's fairly
well known that Dale,
my husband,

343
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,299
and I do a great
deal of charity.

344
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,202
Yes, I do read about it.

345
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,837
Our committee has been
asked to organize

346
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,272
a charity event for the
save the children fund.

347
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,740
And we came up
with a terrific idea

348
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,843
for an evening
of song and dance.

349
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,544
And of course
they want me to run
the entire shooting match.

350
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,780
Of course.

351
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,816
Now, I didn't
want to use

352
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,520
just professionals
or people from my studio.

353
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,322
I wanted to give
the little local people
a chance as well.

354
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,424
And that's why
I've asked you here.

355
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,726
You want US
to do something?

356
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,895
Yes.

357
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,631
What, cater?
(Laughing)

358
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,835
Now, mavis,

359
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,537
I hope you're not carrying
some kind of a grudge.

360
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,740
Pam, I would only...
There's no way

361
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,675
I could have hired
someone who had
never taught before.

362
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,811
And really,

363
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,613
a smidgen of
chorus work in New York

364
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,499
just isn't going
to cut it here.

365
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,249
Pam, if you will
recall my resume,

366
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:12,884
it was more
than just a smidgen...

367
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,919
Mavis. Mavis.

368
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,654
When was the last time
you danced professionally?

369
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,657
Six years ago.

370
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,462
Teaching is very
important to US here.

371
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,733
As a teacher
you have to
be committed,

372
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,835
you have to
be dedicated.

373
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,303
I thought you had
to be a dancer.

374
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,871
Our teachers are young.

375
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,773
They are professional.

376
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,275
They have a future
in front of them.

377
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,845
Anyway,

378
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:41,913
back to the charity.

379
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,783
Now, what I'd like to do

380
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,452
is to get together
two or three of
the smaller groups

381
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,189
and put together a big,
but simple, tap routine.

382
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,193
Now, your reputation
will not be
on the line here.

383
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,429
I will provide
a professional choreographer.

384
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,698
Trust me, she can make
even the worst students
look good.

385
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,369
So, may I put you
on my list?

386
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,606
Okay.

387
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,309
But on our own.

388
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,579
Don't you think
you should accept
my help?

389
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,515
You can put US
on your list

390
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,585
but I'll choreograph
my people

391
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:21,452
in my own way.

392
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,754
And I'll call you
next week.

393
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,261
Don't worry, Pam.

394
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:30,995
We won't embarrass you.

395
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,840
Excuse me, Sylvia.

396
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,676
Do you chew gum
because you've
given up smoking?

397
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,378
No.

398
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,013
Because I might
meet someone nice.

399
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,749
How do I keep
finding it everywhere?

400
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,384
That's because
I keep putting
it everywhere.

401
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,655
You know, I could
really use someone
like you at home, Vera.

402
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,761
Anybody?

403
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,763
Oh, yes, thank you.

404
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,498
I really think
we should do something.

405
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,566
Do we have a problem?

406
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,368
Mavis isn't here yet.

407
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,802
Oh, dear!

408
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,571
Just follow me, girls.
I've got music in my soul.

409
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:14,839
(Laughing)

410
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:17,008
(Vocalizing)

411
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,512
I thought you said
you all couldn't move.

412
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,913
You bet your tail
we can move.

413
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,548
The problem
being in my case,

414
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,783
is that
it all moves in
different directions.

415
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,819
Careful, you'll
knock your wig off.

416
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,421
Uh, can I make
a suggestion?

417
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,358
Geoffrey is about
to make a suggestion.

418
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,660
(Chuckles)

419
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,028
Hey, Geoffrey,
I hope your sex life

420
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,496
is as busy
as your sweater.

421
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,530
(Laughing)

422
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,401
Why does she
always have to be
so rude to him?

423
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,036
Yes.

424
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:46,337
Rose: Well, now,
come on, ladies.
Let the man speak.

425
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,605
Sylvia:
Come on, everyone.
Quiet.

426
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,407
Yes, come on, Geoffrey.

427
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:52,327
What were you
going to say?

428
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:53,044
I was going to say,
that if we want,

429
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,812
why don't we
start the warm-up
while we're waiting?

430
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,549
That is brilliant!

431
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,885
That is just brilliant,
Geoffrey.

432
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,620
(Sylvia snorting)
Rose: Well, I'm starting
if nobody else is.

433
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:03,754
All right.
Come on...

434
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,057
Right behind you.

435
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,525
(Vocalizing)

436
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,762
(Playing slow-paced tune)

437
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,669
(Tempo increases)

438
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,340
(Playing fast-paced tune)

439
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,708
(Women laughing)

440
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,975
(Women screaming)

441
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,447
Whoa, Geoffrey,
look at you.

442
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,969
(Piano stops)

443
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,006
(Playing slow-paced tune)

444
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,513
(Pounds)

445
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,882
(Chuckling) Geoffrey,
that was fabulous.

446
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,618
Why don't you get
Mrs. Fraser's chair,
all right?

447
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,759
Hidden talents,
huh, glenda?

448
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:15,693
Okay, everybody.

449
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,495
Hi.

450
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,462
Come on. I've got
something really
important to tell you.

451
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:21,499
First of all,
I'm sorry I'm late,
you guys.

452
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:25,136
But I have just come
from a meeting
with Pam leichner.

453
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,138
You know
the lady who runs the
performing arts center.

454
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,072
Some of you
may know her.

455
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,141
Oh, yes.

456
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,176
Anyway she told me
that she is organizing

457
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,013
the biggest benefit
show that this town
has ever seen.

458
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,883
I mean professionals
will be in it.

459
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,185
Amateurs... amateurs
from all over the city.

460
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,654
All the local
dance academies
are gonna take part in it.

461
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:44,855
And she called me

462
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,792
because she wants US
to be in it.

463
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:48,926
Isn't that great?

464
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,428
Oh, my god!

465
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:51,962
Oh...

466
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,765
Would we have to...
I mean...

467
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,133
You'd want US
all to be in it?

468
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,568
Of course,
I want you to be in it.

469
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,669
Andy, it's gonna be
a lot of fun.

470
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,439
I mean, we're, we're
in a theater and...

471
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,742
Do you know why
this is so good
for US, you guys?

472
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,745
Because it gives US
something to work for.

473
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,448
I mean, it's a goal.
We need a goal.

474
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,683
Besides,
I want to show that

475
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,186
dame over at the
performing arts center

476
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:16,887
just how terrific
you guys are.

477
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,622
(Laughing)

478
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,559
Oh, what charity is it?

479
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,526
Save the children.

480
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,163
When you say
we would be in it, um...

481
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,599
Geoffrey,
we'd do a number...

482
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,101
Look, you already
know a lot of steps.

483
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,637
I mean we just
put it together and...

484
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,807
And we go out there
and show them what
we can do, you know.

485
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,709
It won't be anything
more difficult than
what we've already done.

486
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,478
Anyway,
it's only for charity.

487
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,012
Charity, yes.
Yeah.

488
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,515
I mean, they probably
wouldn't expect much, right?
Yeah.

489
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:45,716
Well, I'm no
ginger Rogers, so...

490
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,185
Right, Geoff?

491
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,654
(Indistinct speech)

492
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,556
Okay. Okay, you guys.
Hold it, you guys.

493
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:53,591
This is the wrong attitude.

494
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,759
I mean, as far as
I'm concerned,

495
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,761
they're lucky to get US.

496
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:58,762
You know, I just...
I thought it was
kind of an honor

497
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:01,649
they asked US.
That's all.

498
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,266
I wouldn't ask you
to do something

499
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:03,133
I didn't really
believe you could do.

500
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:08,072
Look, think about it okay.
Just think about it.

501
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,540
If you don't wanna do it,
we don't have to do it.

502
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,142
We just won't do it.

503
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,617
Mavis, uh, personally

504
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,885
I think
it's a great idea.

505
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,788
I would have preferred
save the parents but...

506
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,657
Okay, count me in.

507
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,058
Mavis: Oh, honey!

508
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,860
Oh, Sylvia,
you won't be sorry.

509
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,095
It will be the best.

510
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:32,229
We'll have more
fun doing it.

511
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,731
We'll be good.
We'll be good.

512
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,568
A theater.
A theater, Rose.

513
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,203
Geoffrey, we're
gonna be in a theater.

514
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,938
(Inaudible)

515
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,973
Shh, shh!
Dorothy? What, Dorothy?

516
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,542
We're really gonna
knock the socks
off of them.

517
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,710
(All laughing)

518
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,746
The woman's right.
We're going to
go out there,

519
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:49,580
we're gonna show
them what we've
been doing here.

520
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:51,365
Yeah.
Yeah.

521
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,149
I bet we can show them
anything they can do,
we can do better!

522
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,151
Yeah.
Yeah.

523
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,020
Right?
Right!

524
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,722
Right, glenda?
Why wasn't
I told about this?

525
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:04,228
Well, I wanted to wait
until we were all together.

526
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,164
Nevertheless,
I am very familiar
with this sort of thing.

527
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,899
And I should have
been consulted.

528
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,037
Five, six, seven, eight.

529
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,572
Shuffle off to buffalo.

530
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,240
Shuffle off to buffalo.

531
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,608
Shuffle off to buffalo.

532
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,776
Shuffle off to buffalo.

533
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,210
(All laughing)

534
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,279
(Speaking indistinctly)

535
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,083
Jerry, hi.
I'm sorry I'm late.

536
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,085
Honey,

537
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,789
your partner called.
He's not doing
the gig tonight.

538
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,324
What?

539
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:36,160
The guy's got
an attitude problem.

540
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:39,263
Are you sure?
Let me call him.
No. No. Listen to me.

541
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,099
The guy had a hit
seven years ago
that nobody remembers

542
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,101
and he thinks
he's a genius.

543
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,903
Screw him, you know?
Screw him.

544
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:48,772
Jerry, please.
I don't need a genius.

545
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,841
I need somebody good
and I need somebody here.

546
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,979
Now, look,
you stick around,
work with my boys,

547
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,315
work out a set.

548
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,218
I don't work
without Patrick, Jerry.

549
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,288
Well, then
there's nothing
I can do for you.

550
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,726
Call me
when you decide to
dump the schmuck.

551
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,143
(Rock music playing)

552
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,869
Patrick, I wasted
two bus fares
getting to the club.

553
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,438
I tried to call,
you weren't home.

554
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,106
I didn't have the number
where you did that class.
I'm sorry.

555
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,976
The guy liked US.

556
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:00,177
We could have
had steady work...
Mave,

557
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,713
I'm just saying
we could do better.

558
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,351
Did you get any dinner?

559
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,321
Come. Let's go home.

560
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:14,792
You know what else?

561
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,029
I really wanted
to sing tonight.

562
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,765
Then you can sing
to me tonight.

563
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:22,833
Oh.

564
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,204
(Upbeat music playing)

565
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:32,309
(Humming)

566
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:45,956
That's too hard.

567
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,091
(Music ends)

568
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:48,726
(Sighing)

569
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,196
(Orchestral music playing)

570
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,045
(Tempo quickens)

571
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,384
(Humming)

572
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,036
Ha!

573
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,272
Hey!

574
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,241
(Vocalizing)

575
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,080
Five, six, seven, eight!

576
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,095
Ah!

577
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,847
Whee-ha!

578
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:54,985
Ha!

579
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,488
Hey!

580
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,102
Ah-ha!

581
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,571
Hey! Hey!

582
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,974
Ho!

583
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,355
Ah-ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

584
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:35,158
Uh! Ah!

585
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,043
Five, six, seven, eight!

586
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,455
Ha!
(Exhales sharply)

587
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,528
Oh, lynne.
I didn't see you.

588
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,064
I'm sorry. I...
No, no, no.
It's fine.

589
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,032
I just didn't know
you were standing there.

590
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,635
I'm sorry.
No!

591
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,338
You know what I was doing.
I was going over
some stuff for tonight

592
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,040
in the hopes of staying
one step ahead of you guys.

593
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,308
And I got a little
carried away.

594
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,411
I wish I could
dance like that.

595
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,113
You dance great.

596
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,049
No, not really.
There's a difference.

597
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,453
Yeah, but I've been
doing it for a lot
of years, remember?

598
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,021
(Chuckling)
Too many years.

599
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,390
No.
There's a difference.

600
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,501
Oh!

601
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:53,570
Phew. (Chuckling)

602
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,106
(Sighing)

603
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:00,444
Lynne, are you okay?

604
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,612
You seem a bit down.

605
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,357
One of my old ladies
died this morning.

606
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,159
I'm in geriatrics
this week.

607
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,563
Oh...

608
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,698
To be honest,
it's the first patient
I've seen die.

609
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,303
I didn't think that
I was going to be
this upset.

610
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:28,572
Fine nurse I am, right?

611
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,610
I think what upset me
so much was that

612
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,113
nobody ever
came to see her.

613
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,751
And all last night
she just kept wanting
to talk with me.

614
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,421
And we were
extremely busy.

615
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:47,724
Some nights
it's very empty,
but last night it was

616
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:51,128
very busy.

617
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,399
I'm sorry.

618
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,136
It's just that when
I told the doctor
that she had died

619
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,405
he said, "good,
we needed another bed."

620
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,810
And I have to get
used to it, aren't I?

621
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,181
Yes. You are.

622
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:15,285
Somehow it makes it
seem worse, doesn't it?

623
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,337
Did you always
want to be a dancer?

624
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:38,809
Did I always
wanted to be
a dancer?

625
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,745
(Chuckles)

626
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:42,846
Yeah, I suppose I did.

627
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,449
I bet you were
really good.

628
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,517
I was okay.

629
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,120
Pretty hot stuff
in my day.

630
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,222
Do you miss it?

631
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,826
Yeah.
Sometimes I do.

632
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:59,162
But not so much
now that I'm teaching.

633
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,865
I mean I see you guys
getting better

634
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,134
and it makes me
feel better
about everything.

635
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,605
Did you ever do
any big shows?

636
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,173
Oh, yeah.

637
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,342
I worked all the time.

638
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:13,410
I did a lot
of big shows.

639
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:16,179
It was mostly
in the chorus,

640
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,448
but still, I...

641
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,152
Actually the last show
I did...

642
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,822
Do you remember a show
about eight years ago called
<i> the wonderful years?</i>

643
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,258
No.

644
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,330
Too young.
(Laughs)

645
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,265
Anyway, the music
I was dancing to
in the other room,

646
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,766
that's from that show.

647
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:37,868
Oh, Leonard had
a wonderful score.

648
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,805
Anyway,

649
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,374
I got to understudy
the star in that show

650
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:45,842
and she got sick
and I went on.

651
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,578
I bet you were great.

652
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,451
I killed them. I did.
I killed them.

653
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,655
It was only for a week,
but for a week
I killed them.

654
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,226
After that she came back
and finished the run.

655
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,594
But some good things
started to happen to me.

656
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,363
You know I...

657
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:07,664
I got my picture
in the paper
a couple of times.

658
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,867
I got some
really good auditions.

659
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,171
I even audition
for Bob fosse once.

660
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:19,309
I didn't get the job,
but I got to
touch his sleeve.

661
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,917
You know they told me
if I'd stuck around
I could have...

662
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,692
Anyway, I left town
shortly after that.

663
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,294
What happened?

664
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,702
I fell in love.

665
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,805
(Upbeat music playing)

666
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,616
Good.

667
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,785
Mavis, was I all right
in the middle section?

668
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:03,420
Yes. You were fine
but take it easy, honey.

669
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:04,721
I mean this is
a short step.

670
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,822
It's like life,
enjoy it!

671
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,891
Oh, yes, sure.
Easy.

672
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,859
Rose, you're still
having trouble with
the scissors, yes?

673
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,112
Cross...

674
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:14,364
Yeah, but the thing is
I don't really see myself
as a scissors person.

675
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,800
(Chuckling)

676
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:18,235
Why are you still
on the wrong foot?

677
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,769
You start
on the wrong foot
every time!

678
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,305
I know, it's chronic.
Well, how can I help you?

679
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,441
I just seem to use
whatever foot
comes to hand.

680
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,276
I'm going to
kill you!

681
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,544
Are you all right,
darling?
Mmm.

682
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,646
Okay, everybody.
Um, take a minute.

683
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,014
Uh, Andy, where are you?

684
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,717
Look, ma, I'm dancing.

685
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,852
Michael Jackson,
eat your heart out!

686
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,721
Michael Jackson,
now that is one
fine little man,

687
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:39,022
and I ain't kidding!

688
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,657
You like them small,
do you, rosey?

689
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:44,728
Well, I like them small,
honey, but not that small.

690
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,963
Do you like small men,
Dorothy?

691
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,431
I try not to
think about it.

692
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:50,834
(Speaking indistinctly)

693
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,802
There'll be a number
for each...

694
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,672
Thanks, Vera.

695
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,407
There'll be numbers,
you won't have to worry
about anything.

696
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,410
I'd like to start again
if you will.

697
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,945
I wanna see it
just one more time...

698
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:02,979
Glenda: Just a minute.

699
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:06,283
I don't suppose
any of you know,

700
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,051
and I don't suppose
that any of you care,

701
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:14,724
but today is the anniversary
of Irving Berlin's birthday.

702
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,429
And I for one
could not let it pass
without tribute.

703
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:25,402
<i> ¶ He was</i>
<i> a jolly good fellow</i>

704
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,771
<i> ¶ he was</i>
<i> a jolly good fellow</i>

705
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,874
<i> ¶ he was</i>
<i> a jolly good fellow</i>

706
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,076
<i> ¶ which nobody can deny</i>

707
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,711
<i> ¶ which nobody can deny ¶</i>

708
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,050
it's my birthday
next Tuesday.

709
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,521
You wanna start
something or what?

710
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:46,389
(Stifling laugh)
Yes, we're starting.

711
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,058
I would like to start...
That was beautiful, glenda.

712
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,726
I would like to start
from the crisscross,

713
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,094
I wanna see it
one more time
before we leave.

714
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:52,629
Okay, go right into it.

715
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,564
Five, six, seven, go!

716
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:57,534
(Piano playing)
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

717
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,836
Hold your lines.
Hold your lines.
Hold your lines.

718
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,504
(Speaking indistinctly)

719
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,418
Bye.
See you guys.

720
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,354
Rose: Hmm, all right.

721
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:23,827
I'm going to a wedding
this Saturday.

722
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,862
Oh, anyone you know?

723
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,765
Lionel's cousin.
It's going to be
a very big affair.

724
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,533
They're having a tent.

725
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,001
I do love weddings,
don't you?

726
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,737
Not a lot.

727
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:37,440
Mine was lovely,
I must say.

728
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,609
Mine was quite boring.
I'm sorry I went.

729
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,078
Do you know, I remember
every detail of mine.

730
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,566
So can I.

731
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:46,383
Meet you at the car,
Rose.
All right, baby.

732
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,551
See ya.

733
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,789
Do you remember your
wedding, Maxine?

734
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:55,759
When it comes to my
weddings, instant recoil,
sweetheart, ugh.

735
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:56,826
Instant recoil.

736
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,763
Oh, have you been
married a lot then?

737
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,966
Just twice, Vera.
Don't get excited.

738
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,407
Yes, Andy?

739
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,442
I just wanted to say
that I felt better tonight.

740
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,846
What I mean is that
I felt more relaxed.

741
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:17,680
I mean, I know
I'm not very good.

742
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:19,482
Andy,

743
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:21,651
why do you come here?

744
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,421
Why?

745
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:25,655
Yeah. I mean,
what do you get
out of it?

746
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,959
Well, I come because...

747
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,862
I come because
it's the only thing
in the week that I do for me.

748
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:33,963
Everything else is
for other people.

749
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,633
Oh.

750
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,469
You know what
I get out of it?

751
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:43,540
I just love having
a good time.

752
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:45,809
I just love the laughing.

753
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,110
I haven't laughed
like that in years.

754
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,912
I mean, tonight,
when you hit Geoffrey,

755
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,847
I thought his hair
was gonna fall out,
you hit him so hard.

756
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:53,817
You are improving,
you know.

757
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,586
You are!

758
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,887
Okay, bye.
Goodnight.

759
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:01,558
Thanks.
Yeah.

760
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:12,735
Rose, um, did your boy
get a job yet?

761
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:15,505
Mmm-mmm.
Everywhere he tries
it's the same story.

762
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:16,906
You know, all the while
he was at school,

763
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:20,243
we kept telling him,
no qualifications,
no work.

764
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,779
Mine's just the same.
He doesn't know
what he wants.

765
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,013
One minute
he's in a rock group,

766
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,849
the next minute
he's in a coma.

767
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:28,184
You know what
the latest is?

768
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:30,153
Now he wants to go
to art school.
Art school!

769
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,021
He can't even
draw a breath
without fainting.

770
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,256
(Laughing)

771
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,258
Look, about your boy,

772
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:37,861
I've got a job opening
at my store.

773
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,164
Now, if he's interested,
you know where the shop is,

774
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,866
get him to come
and see me, okay?

775
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:47,203
Oh, thank you, Maxine.
I think I will.
Thank you.

776
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:51,708
Goodnight.

777
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,510
Sylvia: Come on.

778
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,512
(Car engine starts)

779
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,747
Can I give you a lift?

780
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,301
Sure.

781
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:01,951
Glenda: Mmm-hmm.
Mavis: What?

782
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:05,889
Glenda:
She is giving him a ride.

783
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,857
So what?
So she is giving him
a ride, so what?

784
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,894
It's always
those quiet ones.

785
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,662
(Car engine starting)

786
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,931
You are
a wicked old broad
at times, glenda.

787
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,799
All right, we'll see.

788
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,711
Well, thank you so much
for the ride. I...

789
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,284
I would ask you in
for a cup of coffee
or something, I don't know...

790
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:36,085
Oh, that's okay.
Um, I have to get home.

791
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,253
My husband needs the car.
All right.

792
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,057
How was...
I'm...

793
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,876
No, go ahead.
Go ahead.
No, please.

794
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:44,694
I was just going to say,
some other time if you like.

795
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:46,162
Yeah.

796
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:48,698
Thank you. Goodbye.

797
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,285
Sorry, we're closed.
Can I talk to you?

798
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,988
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
I've got an appointment
this morning.

799
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,957
So do I.
I'm Alan, Rose's son.

800
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:20,074
Alan!

801
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:21,452
Maxine:
Like I told your mother,

802
00:43:21,453 --> 00:43:22,830
it's not much more
than this, pick-ups
and deliveries.

803
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:26,069
But it's a start.
I mean, we're not saks
but we're growing.

804
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:27,203
So, what do you think?

805
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,639
What do you think,
Mrs. Grozinski?

806
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:30,340
What do I think?

807
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,742
I think you'll be okay.

808
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,247
But if you get one scratch
on this little baby
and you're in shit city.

809
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,819
How's he behaving himself?

810
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,954
Oh, he's a good kid.
I'm very pleased with him.

811
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,357
Well, his daddy told me
to tell you, if he
gives you any trouble...

812
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,659
If he gives me
any trouble,
he's out.

813
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,830
Come on, Rose.
He's doing fine.

814
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:55,131
(Indistinct speaking)

815
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,369
Do you like it?

816
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:01,838
It's incredible.

817
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,275
Let me guess,
Judy jetson?

818
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,211
I was in town,
and I called into
the dance center,

819
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:10,213
and I simply
couldn't resist it.

820
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:12,882
(Laughing)

821
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,250
Do you like it, Maxine?

822
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:17,754
I think it's very nice,
very nice.
Very nice, yes.

823
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:21,157
Vera: Not too bold?
(Women laughing)

824
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,959
Be careful they don't
mistakenly launch you.

825
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,894
(Laughing)

826
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:27,964
Rose: Well, what we need
is a man's opinion.

827
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:31,901
Yo, Geoffrey,
is that too bold
or is that too bold?

828
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:35,872
Well, uh, no...
I mean, it's...

829
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:38,975
Well, that
sums it all up.

830
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:40,810
(Women laughing)

831
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:41,444
Rose: Thank you, Geoffrey.

832
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:48,284
(Humming)

833
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:03,266
I hope you don't mind
my asking, Andy,

834
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:06,469
but why do you
cover yourself
up all the time?

835
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,438
Why do I what?

836
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,940
Well, what I mean is
you've got a nice body.

837
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:13,476
In its own way.

838
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,211
Really?
Really!

839
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:19,916
It's long, but it's nice,
you know.

840
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,318
It seems a pity
to cover it up
all the time.

841
00:45:23,455 --> 00:45:25,788
I think you're being
a bit rude, don't you?

842
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,057
I wasn't being nosy
or anything.

843
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,826
There's nothing
to be nosy about.

844
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:31,160
I wear what
I wanna wear.

845
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:32,962
Sorry, Vera.

846
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:41,337
What happened?

847
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,206
Oh, I was just, um,
getting out of my car

848
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,841
and I seemed to
lose my balance.

849
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:46,843
It was really dumb.
(Chuckles)

850
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:48,778
Geoffrey: But, I mean,
you'll be okay?
Andy: Oh, I'm fine.

851
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,750
I used to be fat,
you know.

852
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,986
Really!

853
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,421
Just after I had my baby.
I was almost as big as you.

854
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,958
Seventeen she is now.

855
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,793
All she ever thinks
about is horses.
Horse-mad she is.

856
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,197
Well, it'll keep her off
the streets, won't it?

857
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:14,070
Okay, everybody,
the break is up.

858
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:16,272
Can I please see you
in your opening positions.

859
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,341
Opening positions.

860
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:19,976
All right, we still got
a lot of work to do.

861
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:21,928
The show's
not very far away.

862
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:23,879
By the way,
thank you, everybody,
for staying late tonight.

863
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:27,116
All right, uh...

864
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,085
I would like to take it
from the step we did
before the break.

865
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,319
Do you remember
what that is?

866
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:34,891
It's cross, cross,
open, cross, turn.

867
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,994
All right?
Now, I would like to
try that in groups.

868
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:42,965
So, you are standing
with your back
to the audience.

869
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,433
The right arm is up,
the left hand
is on your hip.

870
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,837
Stay stark still.
Do absolutely nothing.

871
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,005
So far I like it.

872
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:51,491
(Women laughing)
And then,

873
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:53,976
after the introduction,
which will be
the third eight, right?

874
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:58,915
You start the steps,
so you guys will go on
the one of the third eight.

875
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:02,218
You guys will go
on the one of
the fourth eight, right?

876
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,488
And, Geoffrey,
you're gonna go on the
one of the fifth eight.

877
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,224
And remember,
you have to turn, this
has gotta be a fast turn.

878
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:09,859
So that when you land
the right arm is out

879
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:11,127
and the left hand
goes to the hat.

880
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,429
Are we having hats,
mavis?

881
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,863
I didn't hear you say
anything about hats.

882
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:15,898
Yes, we're having hats.
(Gasps)

883
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,569
Right, Max?
I forgot, I'm sorry...

884
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:21,470
Okay. Come on,
let's try this,
everybody.

885
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:24,240
Please concentrate.
It's very complicated.

886
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:25,408
This is the third eight.
You're ready?

887
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,876
Five, six, seven, go!

888
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:28,177
(Vocalizing)

889
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,478
Good! Go!

890
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,514
(Vocalizing)

891
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,850
Geoffrey...
(Vocalizing)

892
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:34,617
Turn!

893
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,252
(Screams)

894
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:37,486
(All clamoring)

895
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:44,594
Mavis, you're
forgetting the canes.

896
00:47:44,596 --> 00:47:46,095
All: Canes?

897
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:47,897
No, wait. Don't panic!
Don't panic!

898
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:50,233
Thank you, Mrs. Fraser.
You're right, um...

899
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,033
I have forgotten
the canes.

900
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:53,102
Hats and canes...

901
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,104
You're asking
for trouble.

902
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:58,474
All right, so,
everybody, please.

903
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:01,110
The cane is
up in the air,
on the turn,

904
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,614
the left hand goes
to the hat,

905
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:06,249
the cane lands
firmly on the floor.

906
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:08,885
Lynne, demonstrate that.

907
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,453
Okay.

908
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:13,589
When you make the turn,
the left hand is on the cane,

909
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:16,626
and the hat lands
firmly on the floor.

910
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:19,028
Mavis: No, no, no,
that's not what I said,
I said...

911
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,330
Oh, wait a minute,
Geoffrey, don't move.

912
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:23,132
Don't move,
I want you down here
in the solo spot.

913
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,234
Just stay there.

914
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,036
Wait, we'll get it.
Let's try it again.

915
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:28,437
Come on, here we go.
(Clears throat) And...

916
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,439
(Vocalizing)

917
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:32,575
Mavis, can I ask
you a question?
What?

918
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,976
Yes, Max.
Uh...

919
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,145
What do you mean,
a solo spot?

920
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:39,982
You mean Geoffrey?

921
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,951
Is he going to be
special or something?

922
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:43,152
I'm not being funny
or anything, Geoffrey.

923
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:47,089
Geoffrey is special
inasmuch as he's
the only man here

924
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,424
and sticks out
like a sore thumb.

925
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,959
Oh, I see. Okay.

926
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:53,195
Excuse me.
Yes, Rose.

927
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:55,598
I can think of someone else
who'll sticks out
like a sore thumb.

928
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,034
Well, maybe Rose
should be upfront
with Geoffrey, then.

929
00:48:58,036 --> 00:48:59,368
Or I'd be very happy
to change.

930
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,037
Rose: Oh, no, no,
Geoffrey.

931
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,339
If I'm gonna be ignored,
I prefer to be ignored
at the back.

932
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:04,273
Thanks all the same.

933
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,611
You guys, this is
a big heavy tap number,
right?

934
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,446
Mmm-hmm.
You are working
as a team.

935
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:13,149
There is no solo spot.

936
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:14,984
There will be sections

937
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:17,453
where I'll have you
dance in groups
of twos or threes,

938
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,122
but even if I give you
a step on your own,

939
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,491
it doesn't mean that
you're a big superstar,

940
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:25,428
you know, there is
no solo spot.
We're a team.

941
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,029
Yes? Right.
Of course.

942
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:28,397
Okay. Yes?

943
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:29,665
Did you say do
a step on our own?

944
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:30,733
This is so exciting.
Mavis...

945
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:32,685
Mavis.
Yes?

946
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:34,636
Are we gonna be
getting some canes,
I mean, to practice with?

947
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,205
To practice with?
Yes.

948
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,257
Andy: Mavis.
Yes?

949
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:40,308
If we're gonna have canes,
I'd like to have them
as soon as possible.

950
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,345
Absolutely.
The sooner the better.

951
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:45,081
I was gonna suggest
you bring something
in next week, okay?

952
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:47,216
So does that mean
for tonight that
we should just...

953
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:49,218
Pretend, honey,
like you do
with your husband.

954
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,488
Go through the motions
and make like
you're enjoying it.

955
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,156
Incidentally,
there's gonna be
some pretty fast

956
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,358
bouncing around
in this number,

957
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,193
some of you may have
bust problems.

958
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:58,127
So wear something
good and firm, yes?

959
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:03,399
Mavis: And listen,
you know something

960
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:06,068
when you turn around
and face your audience
for the first time...

961
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,571
Baam!
It's gotta have style.
Boom!

962
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:09,739
It's gotta have
the three t's.

963
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:11,040
You know what
the three t's are?

964
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:13,776
Teeth, taps and tits.

965
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,880
(Women laughing)

966
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:18,546
You've only got
two t's, right,
Geoffrey?

967
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:22,151
Don't worry, Geoffrey.
I've got plenty.

968
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,386
You can have
some of mine.
(Rose laughing)

969
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:26,122
Mavis: Okay, everybody,

970
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,057
let's have you
in your opening
positions, please.

971
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:30,359
Right away, please,
your opening positions.

972
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:34,196
Thank you. All right.
Legs crossed,
everything still.

973
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,532
You're neat,
you're very tidy.

974
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,534
Now, you hold this
and you keep holding it.

975
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,102
Don't move a muscle.

976
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:42,104
My husband would be
good at this.

977
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,140
Okay.
Let's try it again,
shall we?

978
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:45,674
Let's really do it...
You know what we need?

979
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,276
We need some music, huh.
How about a little music?

980
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,078
(Snoring)

981
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:53,549
Great. All right. Go!

982
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:55,785
(Mavis vocalizing)

983
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:57,119
Turn, go.

984
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:58,754
(Vocalizing)

985
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:02,291
And Geoffrey.
(Vocalizing)

986
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:05,061
Turn.
You've got to turn
the other way.

987
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,629
That's right.
You gotta do that
the other way.

988
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:08,364
Let's try that again.

989
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:10,766
We'll get this.
Let's try and get this
while we're young.

990
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,101
All right, Dorothy,
just a little bit
smaller, right.

991
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:13,302
And Sylvia,
get rid of the gum.

992
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:14,703
I want to see your teeth
not hear them.

993
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,305
Vera, no, Vera!

994
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,408
Come on, Vera.

995
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,078
The theater's gonna be
filthy. You can't clean
the whole theater!

996
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,680
Okay, here we go. Ready?
Five, six, seven, go!

997
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:26,715
(Vocalizing)

998
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:29,185
Turn. (Vocalizing)

999
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,687
Turn, good.
Geoffrey,
cross, cross,

1000
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:33,856
open, cross,
turn, turn...

1001
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:35,791
Mavis: Oh, Geoffrey...

1002
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:39,595
Rose: I got it.

1003
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,495
(Vocalizing in horse voice)

1004
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:41,464
Turn. Good.
Geoffrey...

1005
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,399
(Continues vocalizing)

1006
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:51,540
I'll never get it.

1007
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,442
Geoffrey, you got it.
You got it, you know...

1008
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:56,345
So you're just choking
on the turn, just relax,
you got it.

1009
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:58,481
Okay, class. Come here.

1010
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:03,119
If everybody will
really concentrate

1011
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:06,489
and do this step right
just once,

1012
00:52:06,491 --> 00:52:07,756
we can all go home!

1013
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:12,862
No pressure.

1014
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:16,565
All right, everybody,
opening positions.

1015
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:20,369
Glenda! Glenda, hit it!
(Snorts)

1016
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:23,472
Five, six...
Five, six, seven and...

1017
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,807
(Vocalizing)

1018
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:28,544
Great!
(Vocalizing)

1019
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,179
Good, go and...
(Vocalizing)

1020
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:32,915
(Gasps)

1021
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,154
(In accent) By George,
I think he's got it!

1022
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:40,389
(All cheering)

1023
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,704
(Vocalizing)

1024
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,239
(Chuckling)
That's good.
Yeah.

1025
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:59,842
Well, not good.
Adequate.

1026
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:06,515
You know, there's something
that, uh, I've been meaning
to ask you

1027
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:09,185
but, I didn't know
whether I should
or, you know...

1028
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:10,386
I didn't know
whether I knew you
well enough...

1029
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:12,454
Um...
What?

1030
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,424
Well...

1031
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:18,527
I just... I was wondering
how long you'd lived alone?

1032
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:21,897
Uh...

1033
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,833
Three years
in December.

1034
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,836
It must have been...
It must have been
very difficult for you.

1035
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,807
Well... at first.

1036
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:37,346
At first I kind of
just let myself go.

1037
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:40,849
Self-pity, I guess.

1038
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:45,321
If you're gonna survive,

1039
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:49,291
you're going to have
to find some kind of
a system or a daily routine.

1040
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:50,226
Something.

1041
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:54,530
Although, like about
a year later I...

1042
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:57,499
I'm just going on
and on about this...

1043
00:53:57,501 --> 00:54:00,603
No, no, no.
I really wanna know.

1044
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:02,805
Well, I have
to say, uh...

1045
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:06,375
After about a year,
I thought, you know,
this daily routine is

1046
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:08,477
turning you into a

1047
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:10,879
Mrs. Fraser
or something.

1048
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,481
(Laughing) No.
Yeah.

1049
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:14,483
No, it's because,
when you live alone,

1050
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,287
it's so easy to
turn in on yourself.

1051
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:21,590
So, I thought I should...

1052
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,996
(Vocalizing)
Or something.

1053
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:36,805
I wonder if it takes
as much courage
to live alone

1054
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:38,374
as it does to live
with someone else?

1055
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,711
(Piano music playing)

1056
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,797
(Upbeat music playing)

1057
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,845
Yeah, that's better.
Andy...

1058
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,347
I'm just still having
trouble with this.

1059
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,582
I can't...
I don't have any
control over it.

1060
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:55,951
Well...
You're acting kinda
like it's your enemy.

1061
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:58,053
You know,
you grab that sucker.

1062
00:55:58,055 --> 00:55:59,755
Your assignment this week
is to make friends
with your cane.

1063
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:03,992
Sylvia, do you know
the step in the middle?

1064
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,661
The thing is
I know what it is
in my head

1065
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:07,096
but I can't get it
through to my feet.

1066
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:09,732
Then stop thinking
about it.

1067
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:12,034
Oh! Okay.
Just do it.

1068
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,002
Rose, you know
what I'm going to say
don't you?

1069
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:17,439
Stop hiding?

1070
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:19,875
We wanna see you.
I mean, girl,
if you got it, flaunt it.

1071
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:23,145
Honey.
(Both chuckling)

1072
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:25,714
Dorothy,
you're still...

1073
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,149
Both: Pushing it
too hard. Yes.

1074
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,918
Yes?
Right. Yes.

1075
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:33,555
Ah, Rose,
you're a step behind.

1076
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,457
Mmm-mmm, sweetheart,
I'm 40 years behind.

1077
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:37,459
(Laughing)

1078
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:40,562
Well, practice, honey.
Tonight your concentration
was terrific.

1079
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,866
Well, thank you, mavis.
Okay, anybody else,
anything?

1080
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:46,168
All right, that's it.
Good class.
Thank you very much.

1081
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,036
(Playing finale)

1082
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:51,807
Maxine, the hats!

1083
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,977
Next week, definitely.
I'm sorry...

1084
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:56,512
We got to have them.
Oh, mavis.

1085
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:58,714
Yes?
Yes, there is one thing

1086
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:00,849
we were all
wondering about.
Yeah.

1087
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:04,553
As it's a real show
and everything,

1088
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:07,189
will we be having
Mrs. Fraser
or proper music?

1089
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:10,659
I heard that.

1090
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:11,827
I'm not being funny
or anything, dear.

1091
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,762
Glenda: I'm sure.

1092
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:17,666
And just who is
the royal "we"
you are referring to?

1093
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:19,902
It's just a general
topic of conversation with
one or two girls, that's all.

1094
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,939
I see.

1095
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,041
Well, you know something,
it's a good, um, question.

1096
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:29,578
Actually, I don't know.
Glenda would know.

1097
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,814
(Stuttering)
Well, how do they usually,
in this kind of thing,

1098
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:34,750
how does it usually
go down?

1099
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:37,119
In my experience,
it depends entirely

1100
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,122
upon the quality of
the people involved.

1101
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:47,463
Mavis, I will wait
for you outside.

1102
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,533
Vera,

1103
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:53,936
I have spoken with
Pam leichner.

1104
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:55,938
They're providing
a proper orchestra.

1105
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,207
They're even giving US
an orchestration.

1106
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:01,477
But I wanted to tell...
I was being
perfectly reasonable.

1107
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:05,481
It's not reasonable to hurt
that old lady's feelings.

1108
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:06,915
God, Vera,
you've got the
sensitivity of linoleum.

1109
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,892
Well, we need to know,
don't we?

1110
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:21,997
Well...
(Speaking indistinctly)

1111
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,268
Well, thanks. Bye.

1112
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:31,507
That was ray gold
from Los Angeles.

1113
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:34,910
Oh, yeah?

1114
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:35,810
You met him.
I introduced you

1115
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:36,710
back when you were doing
all that old-fashioned
Broadway crap.

1116
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:38,914
He helped
promote my song.

1117
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:43,235
Gee, honey,
I don't remember him.

1118
00:58:43,236 --> 00:58:43,785
He said as soon as
we get a gig out there,

1119
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:44,820
he'll bring people
down to see US.

1120
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:47,523
He gave me
the name of a club.

1121
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:48,690
It turns out
the guy who runs it
has heard of me.

1122
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,926
Good.

1123
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:52,628
He promised me
a booking, mavis.

1124
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:56,131
Start packing, baby.

1125
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:08,677
How are we gonna
get out there?
Oh, it's all set.

1126
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:12,281
I found this service where
you drive someone's car
for them cross-country.

1127
00:59:12,283 --> 00:59:14,116
Well, if someone needs
a car in L.A. next week,
it couldn't be more perfect.

1128
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:25,227
Patrick, this show
that I'm doing is
important to me.

1129
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:27,696
I care about these...
Mavis...

1130
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:30,032
It's great that
you've got a hobby.

1131
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:32,935
I'm talking about
real life here.

1132
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:34,336
Real life!

1133
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,612
Are we starting
or what?
Yes, glenda.

1134
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:47,583
Sorry, mavis.
Max...

1135
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,985
Are those the hats?
Yes!

1136
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:52,187
Ah! Thank goodness.

1137
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:54,089
The famous hats
have finally showed up.

1138
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,159
Mavis: (Clapping)
Okay, everybody...

1139
00:59:57,161 --> 01:00:01,063
Tonight we are going to
go through the number
with the straw hats.

1140
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:03,198
Well, will you be
requiring some sort of
introduction

1141
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:05,968
or shall I make do
with a starting pistol?

1142
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:07,970
Ta-da!

1143
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:14,242
Oh, mavis, I...
That's not a straw hat!

1144
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,378
Maxine: No kidding!

1145
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,180
I thought you were
bringing the straw hats.

1146
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:19,881
So did I and look
what they gave me.

1147
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:23,785
Oh, my god!

1148
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:24,653
I think that's rather me.

1149
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:27,956
Didn't you check them?

1150
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:30,225
I asked for straw hats.

1151
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,997
I expect the man
to give me straw hats.

1152
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:40,886
What are we doing,
<i> the music man?</i>

1153
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:41,803
You should have
checked, Maxine.

1154
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:43,872
Should?
What's this word
"should?"

1155
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:45,374
Here's one.
Do you like it?

1156
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,075
Thanks.

1157
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,677
Thank you, Maxine.

1158
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,350
Mavis: Rose...
You're kidding!

1159
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,021
They'll be all right
to practice with,
won't they, mavis?

1160
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,857
No.

1161
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:05,060
But they'll just
have to do, won't they?
Here.

1162
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:06,428
Maxine: Mavis, next week,
I guarantee it.

1163
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,964
I am so sorry.
Truly I'm sorry.

1164
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:10,549
Change the record,
will you?

1165
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,133
Mavis: It's all right, Max,
I should have done it myself.

1166
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:13,935
Maxine: (Stuttering)
Mavis, please...
Max!

1167
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:16,004
I should have
checked them...

1168
01:01:17,074 --> 01:01:18,340
There's one missing!

1169
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,408
Oh!
I don't believe it!

1170
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,909
I don't have a hat, mavis!

1171
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,444
Well, you'll just
have to mime it,
Dorothy.

1172
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:24,179
Well, I've been
miming it all month.

1173
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,947
Well, then you should be
really good at it, right?

1174
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:27,315
(Sneezing)
Oh, god!

1175
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:30,886
Mavis, please, just...

1176
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,690
Oh, for heaven's sake!

1177
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,362
Thank you, Mrs. Fraser.
Thank you.

1178
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:49,938
(All laughing)

1179
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,809
Five, six, seven, eight!

1180
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:56,411
(Upbeat music playing)
All: One, two three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1181
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:59,314
All: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1182
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:02,384
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1183
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,320
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1184
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:08,056
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1185
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,124
One, two...

1186
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:10,292
Ouch!

1187
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:11,827
...six, seven, eight.

1188
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:14,396
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1189
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:17,299
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1190
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,267
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

1191
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,503
(Clamoring)

1192
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,040
(Arguing)

1193
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:38,420
God, we were
terrible tonight,
and I mean terrible!

1194
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:40,255
We were trying.
(Sighs)

1195
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:44,926
Would you look
at that Sylvia?

1196
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,262
(Laughing) Yeah, well,
I'll think about it.

1197
01:02:48,065 --> 01:02:49,131
Thanks for the beers.

1198
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,137
Are you at it again?

1199
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,972
I'm playing them along.

1200
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:58,840
Doesn't your husband mind?

1201
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:00,008
What, you mean me
having a night out?

1202
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:02,544
Yes, you are married.

1203
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,846
Thursday's my night out.

1204
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:06,948
I go out, he babysits.

1205
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,550
He'd mind if he thought
you were talking to him.

1206
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:09,818
Sylvia:
He knows, right.

1207
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,787
You talk to him
about it?

1208
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,489
I don't talk to him
about it. I tell him.

1209
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:16,158
(Laughs)
Take a pill, Dorothy.
He loves it.

1210
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:21,196
That's why I do it.
(Laughing)

1211
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:23,265
I mean, if he
really believed me,
he'd kill me, right?

1212
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:25,167
Right, yes.

1213
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:28,303
What he enjoys
is the idea of
being jealous.

1214
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,874
Take my word for it,
it works wonders
for your sex life.

1215
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:37,112
We used to do it more
before we were married.

1216
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:39,815
I mean, come on,
you do, right?
Right, yes.

1217
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:41,817
A friend of mine
was married for
10 years,

1218
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:43,985
and every day
her husband wanted sex,

1219
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,521
not once
but three times.

1220
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,591
Three times a day,
for 10 years.

1221
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:52,527
Well, in the end
she had to divorce him.

1222
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:54,162
Over-consummation
of marital rights.

1223
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,464
(Sylvia laughing)

1224
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,200
Hell, I'm not surprised.
That man is sick.

1225
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,436
Where's he living now?

1226
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:02,938
(Squealing)

1227
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:09,511
So, seven, eight
and one, and two,

1228
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:14,216
and three, and four,
and five...

1229
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:16,384
Wait for the music, lynne.

1230
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:21,022
And seven, go, Max...
And eight, Sylvia, good...
And nine...

1231
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:29,197
Everybody, everybody.

1232
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,900
When you use a cane,
it's got to be clean
and precise

1233
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:33,034
but mostly it's
got to be together.

1234
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:35,904
Now, that takes time,
you guys,

1235
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:38,006
and if there's one thing
we don't have, it's time.

1236
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:39,641
This is not your fault,
this is my fault.

1237
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,645
So, I've made a decision,
I'm cutting the canes.

1238
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:45,914
(Speaking indistinctly)

1239
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,649
Give the canes
to me, please.

1240
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,486
Give your canes to me.

1241
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:53,054
Believe me,
it will be better.
Thank you, mavis.

1242
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,155
All right?

1243
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:57,959
Mavis: Just trust me
on this one,
will you, please?

1244
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,527
The canes are out
of the number,
the hats are in.

1245
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:01,529
Everybody,
the double line.

1246
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:03,899
Okay, Andy,
you're right down here.

1247
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:05,400
Maxine, change places
with lynne.

1248
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,202
(Sneezing)

1249
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:09,037
Can't you do something
about that, Dorothy?

1250
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,473
Sorry, mavis,
it's the pollen.

1251
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:13,942
All right, do this
with your right foot...

1252
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,411
Brush, pull.

1253
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,280
Right. Now,
with your left foot.

1254
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:19,581
(Blowing nose)

1255
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:23,151
There's got to be
a spray or there's
got to be something.

1256
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:25,687
Now, if you can
do that together.

1257
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:28,690
I will put it
in the number
at this point.

1258
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:31,526
Both feet together
at the same time?
Yeah.

1259
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:32,527
Just practice it,
see if you can get it.

1260
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,263
Can I say something,
mavis?

1261
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:38,300
Yes, lynne.
We were all wondering if,

1262
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:40,268
when we do this bit that...

1263
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,537
Well, if we might
be able to do
something different.

1264
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,272
I know how important it is
that we're a team
and everything,

1265
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:47,242
but we just thought

1266
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:50,211
that this might be the moment
when we all might be
able to do something...

1267
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,580
Individual.

1268
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:57,986
You mean,
kinda like a solo?
A solo, yes.

1269
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,254
Only if you think it's
a good idea though.

1270
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:02,424
Well, what do you
have in mind?

1271
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:03,959
(All speaking indistinctly)

1272
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,473
Shut up! Just shut up!

1273
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:24,512
Evidently you all feel
that there's something
missing in this number.

1274
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:27,115
I mean, you think you're
capable of doing something
that I don't know you can do?

1275
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,152
If you don't think
I know what you can do

1276
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,587
just show me
something else,
all right, just show me.

1277
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:35,623
You work it out
on your own.

1278
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,059
You have
two counts of eight,
by yourselves.

1279
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:40,462
Just show me,
that's all.

1280
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:44,466
I mean, you teach me

1281
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:46,534
because I'm tired
of being the teacher.

1282
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:47,769
You have five minutes.

1283
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:00,181
I hope you're all
very proud of yourselves.

1284
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:05,387
I shouldn't have
said anything.

1285
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:07,622
No, no, no,
it's not your fault.

1286
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:08,623
I don't know
what happened.

1287
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:15,397
I don't know
what I'm doing.

1288
01:07:18,602 --> 01:07:20,535
I mean,
this is crazy, glenda.
This is gonna be terrible.

1289
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:21,803
(Sighs)

1290
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:27,809
(Sobbing)

1291
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:36,184
Reading between
the lines, I think
they have a hard time.

1292
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:38,653
Money.

1293
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:41,756
Have you seen her shoes?
Have you?
Yes.

1294
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,391
Always wears
the same shoes, always.
(Gasps)

1295
01:07:44,528 --> 01:07:46,294
Well, she can't make much,
that's for sure,

1296
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:47,695
especially having to
rent the room.

1297
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:49,431
Mmm-hmm.
And pay Mrs. Fraser.

1298
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,167
(Sneezing)

1299
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:53,835
That doesn't help, either.

1300
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:57,338
I'm sorry, it's the...
All: Pollen!

1301
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,673
In December?
(Blowing nose)

1302
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,242
Oh, no. Thank you.

1303
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,479
Okay, what you got?

1304
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:08,817
All right...

1305
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:12,187
Look, I know that you know
how to do a lot of things

1306
01:08:13,457 --> 01:08:15,190
but you don't know
how to do this.
I do.

1307
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,227
I know how to,
and I am trying

1308
01:08:20,197 --> 01:08:22,297
to highlight all of you
in this.

1309
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:24,432
But we've got to
work together, you guys.

1310
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,267
If we're not
a team out there,
it's gonna be a disaster.

1311
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:28,870
Here's what I need,
all right?

1312
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:31,639
I need you to
listen to me,

1313
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:35,143
I need you to trust me

1314
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:37,212
and I need you to do
what I tell you to do.

1315
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:41,649
I also need to say,
just once,
that I apologize,

1316
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:43,318
I'm sorry,

1317
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,220
I lost my temper
and it won't happen again.

1318
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:47,689
No, mavis we should
apologize to you.
We were out of line.

1319
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:49,224
(All speaking)

1320
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:52,227
We're very, very sorry.

1321
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:54,762
(Speaking indistinctly)

1322
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:05,540
We understand, mavis.

1323
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:08,343
No, you don't understand.

1324
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:10,278
You don't understand.

1325
01:09:12,516 --> 01:09:14,349
I am pregnant
and I don't want to be.

1326
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:18,286
Now, can you
understand that?

1327
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:19,354
Can you understand that?

1328
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:23,258
Okay...

1329
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,294
You know what
I wanna do?

1330
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,262
I want to take it from
where the melody of
<i> happy feet</i> comes in.

1331
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:29,697
You know,
the scissors, right?

1332
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:32,300
But not in the mirror,
all right?

1333
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:34,235
Not gonna have
mirrors on stage,

1334
01:09:34,237 --> 01:09:35,837
so better get used to it.
Positions, everybody.

1335
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,739
Come on, come on.

1336
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:41,509
Okay, glenda.
And five, six,
seven, eight.

1337
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,744
(Piano music playing)
(Mavis vocalizing)

1338
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:46,514
Smile.

1339
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:48,616
(Mavis vocalizing)

1340
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:49,817
That's it. Come on.

1341
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,387
Come on. Smile!

1342
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:55,356
Yeah, we're a team.
(Vocalizing)

1343
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,258
Good. (Vocalizing)
This is the big time,
you guys. Hit it.

1344
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:00,328
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

1345
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:04,432
Because I knew
you'd try to
talk me out of it.

1346
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:09,304
You're a beautiful
and gifted lady.

1347
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:11,239
I'm trying to keep you
from wasting your life.

1348
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:12,540
I'm not wasting my life.

1349
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:15,410
We're making a big
career move to L.A.

1350
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,197
There's nothing here
for you.

1351
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:20,848
It's a cultural wasteland
with dirty snow.

1352
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,284
Yeah, and in six months
you'll be bitching
about L.A.

1353
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:25,920
And the fact that
the freeway is crowded
and it never rains.

1354
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,290
That's bullshit, mavis.

1355
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,926
Patrick, for god's sake,
I'm starting to make
a life for myself here.

1356
01:10:33,496 --> 01:10:34,729
I'm making friends.

1357
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,600
In seven years,
you're the only person

1358
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:40,435
I've had a chance
to get close to.

1359
01:10:40,437 --> 01:10:41,569
It's that damn class,
isn't it?

1360
01:10:42,973 --> 01:10:44,689
You know,
I didn't spend
all this time with you

1361
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:46,406
just so you can
throw it all away on
a bunch of lousy amateurs.

1362
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:50,311
I don't know what
you're talking about...

1363
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:54,549
I know what
a professional is,
all right?

1364
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:56,417
A professional is
somebody who's there,
who shows up!

1365
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,855
A professional is
somebody who you can
ask a question to

1366
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:03,825
and maybe they'll answer
because they know a little
bit more than you do.

1367
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:06,594
A professional is somebody
who takes responsibility
when you need them!

1368
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,463
Patrick, with them
I am a professional!

1369
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:09,731
With you I'm an amateur.

1370
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:11,532
Don't lecture me
about responsibility!

1371
01:11:13,003 --> 01:11:13,901
Having a kid
wasn't in our deal.

1372
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:16,871
It is now.

1373
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:25,913
Not for me.

1374
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:33,554
Well, that's your decision.

1375
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:36,991
But our child
is in my body.

1376
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:43,431
And whether it stays
there or not,
that's my decision.

1377
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:47,669
Patrick, I love you
very, very much.

1378
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:51,806
But I'm not
going with you.

1379
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,478
I look like a dancer.

1380
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,479
You are a dancer.

1381
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:00,882
You're right,
I am a dancer.

1382
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:03,851
Mavis.
Mavis: Yes.

1383
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:05,320
What I was going to do...

1384
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:07,488
Yeah?
Oh, that's perfect, Rose.

1385
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:11,025
I was going to try
and make them all
the same length.

1386
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:13,361
Now, see, go down,
Geoffrey, darling.
Thank you.

1387
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:17,031
That's it.
All the bottoms line up.

1388
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,467
Do you see?
Hmm.

1389
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:21,836
It would be
ever so effective.

1390
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,838
It would be
a lot more effective
if our bottoms lined up!

1391
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:26,374
(Chuckling)

1392
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:28,843
Well, they don't, so...

1393
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,112
Vera, that's a really good
idea, but I don't think,
you know...

1394
01:12:31,114 --> 01:12:32,447
(Stammers)

1395
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:35,650
No?
No.

1396
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:36,584
Oh!

1397
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,419
How many?
Nine.

1398
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,023
You're bringing
your whole bus tour?

1399
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:43,991
My colleagues from
the library, they're really
looking forward to it.

1400
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:46,961
Are you sure
you want them
to come?

1401
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:49,564
(Laughing) Yes.
Nine.

1402
01:12:51,134 --> 01:12:54,469
How many?
Two... please.

1403
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:56,471
It's cash.
Can I pay you next week?

1404
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,675
Yes.
Thanks.

1405
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:02,377
Mavis: Everybody,
listen to me.

1406
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:06,114
We only get the stage
of the theater
the day of the benefit,

1407
01:13:06,116 --> 01:13:08,149
the dress rehearsal
that's it, okay.

1408
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,151
That's only two more
rehearsals.

1409
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,854
Don't say it.

1410
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:14,522
Just thinking about it
turns my stomach.

1411
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:17,625
I must remember
to get my hair done.

1412
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,396
Have you ordered
any tickets?

1413
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:23,097
No, there really
isn't anyone I...

1414
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:25,166
Not that I'm sorry.

1415
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:27,835
What about you?

1416
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:29,871
Oh, no.

1417
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:31,172
To tell you the truth
I haven't told anybody...

1418
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:35,510
Well, it's gonna be
hard enough without...

1419
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:37,545
(Whispering) Listen,
do you wanna have
a party after the show?

1420
01:13:37,547 --> 01:13:38,946
Oh, great idea!

1421
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:40,681
You guys,
do you wanna have
a party after the show?

1422
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:43,050
All: Yes!

1423
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:44,786
We could do it here.
(Speaking indistinctly)

1424
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:46,521
Maxine: Scene of the crime.
(Laughs)

1425
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:48,423
My husband won't be
here that weekend.

1426
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:51,025
He has to be
away on business.

1427
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:54,629
And I was
just wondering if, um,
maybe instead of a party,

1428
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:56,164
you'd like to come over
for a meal or something?

1429
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,666
You know, I could cook...

1430
01:13:58,668 --> 01:13:59,834
I mean,
only if you want to.

1431
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:02,103
I'm not trying to...

1432
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:06,073
Andy?

1433
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,479
Um, well...

1434
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:14,816
I did sort of vaguely
promise someone
that I would...

1435
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:17,852
Well, we'll miss you.
Uh, Geoffrey?

1436
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,156
Well, I...

1437
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:25,993
I don't, uh...

1438
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:27,728
Oh, come on,
you're the only guy.

1439
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:31,732
Well, it sounds good.

1440
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:34,502
Yes, I would like to come.
Thank you, Maxine.

1441
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:35,870
(Women continue talking)

1442
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:45,680
Huh.

1443
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:50,017
So...

1444
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:52,119
I made you some coffee.

1445
01:14:53,957 --> 01:14:54,755
You know where I'll be.

1446
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:58,793
You'll let me know
how, when...

1447
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,662
Sure. Sure, I will.

1448
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:08,536
You wanna beat
the traffic.

1449
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:38,900
(Engine starting)

1450
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,167
Do you need me to
take you to the airport?

1451
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:14,835
Yes, thank you.

1452
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:16,671
It's at 10:00, right?

1453
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:18,172
It was but
it's been changed, Ann.

1454
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,675
I'm leaving
this evening, 8:30.

1455
01:16:25,782 --> 01:16:26,914
I can't take you
this evening, frank.

1456
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,350
Oh.

1457
01:16:29,352 --> 01:16:30,217
Why is that, Ann?

1458
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:33,621
I have one of
my classes.

1459
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:35,623
Then you'll have to miss
one of your classes.

1460
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:36,691
I can't.

1461
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:42,997
What do you mean,
you can't?

1462
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:47,702
It's one of my classes,
it's, um...

1463
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:50,271
It's a dancing...
A dancing class.

1464
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,607
And we're putting
on a show.

1465
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,108
It's, um,
sort of a benefit

1466
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:55,910
and I'm supposed
to be in it.

1467
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,713
(Scoffs)

1468
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,247
Dancing classes?
Yes.

1469
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:04,919
And how long
have you been going to
these dancing classes?

1470
01:17:06,389 --> 01:17:07,989
For about six months now.

1471
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:10,191
And you never thought
to tell me?

1472
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,160
I thought that
you wouldn't approve.

1473
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:14,996
I see.

1474
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,000
All right...

1475
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:23,337
Show me.

1476
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,173
What?

1477
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:28,109
You're taking dancing
lessons, you're in
some sort of show...

1478
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:30,711
Show me.

1479
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:43,057
(Tapping)

1480
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:48,162
Go on, go on, go on.

1481
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:51,699
(Tapping)

1482
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:59,106
(Frank laughing)

1483
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,350
You won't be
doing any show.

1484
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:12,420
Frank...
No, listen to me!

1485
01:18:12,422 --> 01:18:15,256
You won't be doing
any show because
you'll look ridiculous.

1486
01:18:15,258 --> 01:18:17,391
And more to the point,
you'll make me
look ridiculous.

1487
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,370
Rose: He says, "honey,
there's no reason
for you to be worried.

1488
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,305
"You move like an angel."

1489
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:33,741
(Scoffs) Sure,
I move like an angel.

1490
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:35,009
I've been moving
like an angel
for the past half hour

1491
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:36,877
to the toilet.

1492
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:39,013
The thing is
it's not just my stomach
that's turned to water,

1493
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:39,880
it's my whole body.

1494
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:47,288
Sylvia, are you listening
to what I'm saying?
What? What?

1495
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,223
Would you stop flirting
with these guys?

1496
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,058
Sylvia: What, Rose?

1497
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,827
I'm not doing
anything wrong.

1498
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:54,495
Rose:
You're driving me crazy.
(Sylvia laughing)

1499
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:56,897
I'm just having
a little bit of fun.
Sure, fun, right.

1500
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,200
He was cute,
wasn't he?
Yeah, right, fun.

1501
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:00,267
(Both screaming)
Watch out!

1502
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:01,969
(Tires screeching)

1503
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:11,479
No conversation, baby,
you're gonna pay!

1504
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:14,749
Mom!

1505
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:17,351
(Sighs)

1506
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:18,419
(Dramatic music playing)

1507
01:19:22,225 --> 01:19:23,858
Mavis: (Whispers)
Hi, girls.
Both: Hi.

1508
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:26,927
Hi, Pam.
Hi.

1509
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,265
Good?
Good.

1510
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:33,768
Wait until you see
the a team.

1511
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:39,406
They haven't seen
nothing yet.
Yeah.

1512
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:41,842
Okay, you guys,
are we all here?

1513
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:43,410
Everybody is,
except Andy.

1514
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,212
Andy?

1515
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:47,348
I wonder where
she could be.

1516
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:51,318
Wow! Wow, fabbo!

1517
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,554
Oh, my god!
Oh! I forgot my shoes.

1518
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:55,089
You can't rehearse
without your shoes.

1519
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:56,223
You think maybe someone
will have mine?

1520
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:58,559
Oh, hello, Rose.

1521
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:03,531
Mavis: Everybody...

1522
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:07,835
Okay, just a second,
let me talk to
the lighting guy.

1523
01:20:07,837 --> 01:20:11,338
Hello. Hello.
Mavis Turner tappers.

1524
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,140
Uh, can you show me
what you got
on this front pipe?

1525
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,308
You got it, babe.

1526
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:17,011
Mavis:
You got any specials?

1527
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:18,512
Man: Yeah.
Mavis: Can I use them?

1528
01:20:18,514 --> 01:20:19,914
Man: No, they're all set
for miss leichner.

1529
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,450
Uh, well, look,
just light US so
you can see US.

1530
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:27,388
Okay, everybody.

1531
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:28,889
Here we go.
Opening positions.

1532
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:31,091
Oh, sorry, Max.

1533
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:34,261
Now, yeah, here...
Hats up.

1534
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:36,330
All right.
Just back up,
just a little bit.

1535
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,364
(Curtains raising)

1536
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:11,866
It's so clean!

1537
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:14,068
(Chuckles)

1538
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:17,905
Don't panic.

1539
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:20,441
Hey, mister,
can we have these?
Can we have these?

1540
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:23,344
Ah!

1541
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:28,649
Great! I love you!

1542
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,120
Excuse me.
I'm really starting to
worry about Andy, now,

1543
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:34,989
she's still not here.

1544
01:21:34,991 --> 01:21:36,123
Didn't she say
anything to anybody?

1545
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,960
All right, look,
don't worry, uh...

1546
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:41,495
Let me go see
if I can find out
what's happening.

1547
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:42,596
Go through
the spacing, huh?

1548
01:21:42,598 --> 01:21:43,898
Thank you.

1549
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:44,665
(Speaking indistinctly)

1550
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,401
Problems?
No problems.

1551
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:50,971
It's not like Andy
to be late.

1552
01:21:50,973 --> 01:21:54,208
No, but life's always
a bit of a drama
for poor Andy.

1553
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:56,010
Why do you always
say things like that?

1554
01:21:56,512 --> 01:21:58,078
She's...
She's what?

1555
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:01,015
It doesn't matter.

1556
01:22:04,387 --> 01:22:07,388
Could you break in
and see if there's anybody
talking on that line?

1557
01:22:12,028 --> 01:22:13,193
It is off the hook.

1558
01:22:14,397 --> 01:22:15,696
Thank you.

1559
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,313
Okay, let me see you
on your opening marks again.

1560
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:34,581
Everybody, please,
you are still looking
at the floor.

1561
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,567
All of US?
All of you.

1562
01:22:36,568 --> 01:22:38,552
I mean, uh,
they wanna see your faces,
not your roots, you know.

1563
01:22:38,554 --> 01:22:40,154
And, you know,

1564
01:22:40,156 --> 01:22:41,288
if you look like you're
having a good time,

1565
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,957
the audience will have
a good time.

1566
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:45,259
The three t's.
Mavis: Yes!

1567
01:22:45,261 --> 01:22:46,493
Mavis?
Mavis: Yes, Vera?

1568
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:48,529
You wanted to
change something.

1569
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:50,297
Change?
What do you mean?
Mavis: Don't panic, everybody.

1570
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,099
It's one thing

1571
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:53,000
and it's good luck
to change something
the opening night.

1572
01:22:53,536 --> 01:22:55,269
Watch, it's easy.

1573
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:59,039
Here we go. We go
one, two and go on
three instead of four.

1574
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:01,075
Three, four, five,
six, seven.

1575
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:03,377
See? Let's try it.

1576
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:04,979
And...

1577
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:08,415
All: One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

1578
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,317
Mavis...
Mavis: Yes?

1579
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,987
What happens
if somebody drops
their hat?

1580
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:14,622
Mavis: Well,
nobody's gonna
drop their hat.

1581
01:23:14,623 --> 01:23:16,256
But if you do
drop your hat,
you just keep going.

1582
01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:18,592
For god's sake keep going.
Don't stop for anything.
Keep moving.

1583
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:19,727
Yes.
Yes, I thought so.

1584
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,030
What you mean is
if I drop my hat.

1585
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:24,631
No, Andy, I think
she means if anybody
drops their hats.

1586
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:26,567
No, no. You mean me.

1587
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:28,202
That's what you meant,
isn't it, Vera?

1588
01:23:28,204 --> 01:23:30,237
Andy, don't be so touchy.

1589
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:31,538
I didn't ask
your opinion,
thank you.

1590
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,007
Rose: Come on, come on.

1591
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:34,274
Yeah, come on.
Let's try it again.

1592
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:36,043
Just once more,
here we go.

1593
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:38,579
Okay, one, two,
three, four...

1594
01:23:38,581 --> 01:23:40,147
I'm sorry, mavis,
but I really wanna
have this thing out.

1595
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:42,716
Okay, Andy.

1596
01:23:44,587 --> 01:23:45,386
So, what's the problem?

1597
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:49,490
I know exactly what
you're thinking.
All of you.

1598
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:53,627
You don't think that
I should be in it.

1599
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:55,562
You think that
I'm gonna be letting
you all down.

1600
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:57,598
You're very good,
Andy.

1601
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,699
(All speaking indistinctly)

1602
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:02,603
Please, I am not good.

1603
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:03,570
Mavis: Andy...

1604
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:07,508
I don't know
why I'm here.

1605
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,809
I don't know
what I'm doing.

1606
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:11,712
I mean, I...
I can't do it.

1607
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:14,748
I can't do the steps.

1608
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:18,585
But that's what we all
admire about you.

1609
01:24:19,622 --> 01:24:23,123
Mavis: Vera...
The way you try
so hard.

1610
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:25,659
Vera, I'll handle this.

1611
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,626
Just trying to be helpful.

1612
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:29,396
I don't want you
to be helpful.

1613
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,165
I'm sick to death
of you trying to be
helpful all the time.

1614
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,167
You're so stupid!

1615
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:35,069
Andy, take it easy.

1616
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:39,073
You were just the same
at the last class
you went to.

1617
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:41,742
You didn't leave
because you didn't
like the teacher.

1618
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:44,211
You left because
they asked you to leave

1619
01:24:44,213 --> 01:24:47,181
because they couldn't
stand you interfering
all the time.

1620
01:24:47,183 --> 01:24:49,850
Well, I'm sick of you.
I'm sick of this.
I'm sick of all of it.

1621
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:52,853
Oh, god!

1622
01:25:03,866 --> 01:25:05,332
That's not true,
actually.

1623
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:08,502
I left because
I wanted to.

1624
01:25:08,504 --> 01:25:09,703
It's all right, Vera...
All: It's all right.

1625
01:25:14,844 --> 01:25:17,211
May I take it
that the rehearsal
is concluded?

1626
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,486
Geoffrey...

1627
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:31,792
You remember when Andy
sprained her wrist?

1628
01:25:32,595 --> 01:25:34,695
I saw her
at the hospital

1629
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:36,897
and I saw her file
when it came down
from X-ray.

1630
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:39,266
Geoffrey, please,
listen to me.

1631
01:25:41,237 --> 01:25:42,669
They've been
talking about her
at the hospital.

1632
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:45,839
They don't think that
she just fell down.

1633
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:48,509
Apparently she's
been there before.

1634
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:50,911
They think
it's her husband.

1635
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:53,280
They think she
gets beaten up.

1636
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:06,760
So, how many you got
coming, Vera?

1637
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:10,731
What? Oh, sorry, uh,

1638
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:14,168
just my husband
and my daughter,
actually.

1639
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:15,269
Hmm. That's nice.

1640
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:23,677
Rose: She's just like you.

1641
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:26,380
She does look like me,
doesn't she?

1642
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,416
She's not
Lionel's daughter.

1643
01:26:29,418 --> 01:26:30,651
He adopted her.

1644
01:26:31,887 --> 01:26:35,522
I was married before,
in england.

1645
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,291
I was very young.
It didn't last.

1646
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:43,430
He was such
a gentleman, Lionel.

1647
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,333
Well, he still is.

1648
01:26:46,335 --> 01:26:47,467
You can see.

1649
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:51,438
It was him who
taught me everything.

1650
01:26:52,308 --> 01:26:53,941
About dress,
and everything.

1651
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,345
He said "I don't
want to be ashamed
of you, do I?"

1652
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:02,482
He says some
terrible things
sometimes.

1653
01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:07,321
But it's just
his sense of humor.

1654
01:27:07,323 --> 01:27:09,856
You know, very dry.

1655
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:17,531
But he thinks
the world of my daughter.

1656
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:20,367
My Louise.

1657
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:23,337
She's 17.

1658
01:27:25,274 --> 01:27:28,775
He says she looks
almost exactly
like I did

1659
01:27:28,777 --> 01:27:29,643
when he first met me.

1660
01:27:30,846 --> 01:27:31,945
They're never apart.

1661
01:27:33,549 --> 01:27:34,648
They go everywhere
together.

1662
01:27:36,285 --> 01:27:37,784
Theaters, concerts...

1663
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:40,921
Everywhere.

1664
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:42,990
I mean, I don't mind.
I've got plenty to do.

1665
01:27:42,992 --> 01:27:45,592
And anyway I like
making a nice home
for them, you know.

1666
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:49,863
Then they tend to
talk about things
I don't really understand.

1667
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:56,703
I'm sorry I messed up
your practice, mavis.

1668
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:58,805
I just couldn't help it.

1669
01:27:58,807 --> 01:28:00,774
I mean,
this means a lot to me
and I just...

1670
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:02,743
Flipped!
(Exhales)

1671
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:06,546
Well, at least you
didn't throw up.

1672
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:08,849
What?

1673
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:11,351
Oh, I threw up before
every opening night
I've ever had.

1674
01:28:11,353 --> 01:28:12,386
It was awful.
(Chuckles)

1675
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:16,490
She just makes me
so mad.

1676
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:20,527
I thought
you were terrific.
I was proud of you.

1677
01:28:22,665 --> 01:28:24,564
God, it feels good
to fight back,
doesn't it? (Chuckles)

1678
01:28:25,334 --> 01:28:26,700
Yeah, it really does.

1679
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:34,741
You drop that hat,
I will kill you.

1680
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:37,311
(Both chuckle)
I won't.

1681
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,379
I know.
I won't.

1682
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:46,019
(Bell jingling)

1683
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:55,929
Oh, look. Oh, wow!
That looks fantastic.

1684
01:28:55,931 --> 01:28:56,963
(Knocking on door)

1685
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:02,186
Oh, Max. Max.

1686
01:29:02,187 --> 01:29:03,670
Uh, flowers for
the mavis Turner tappers.

1687
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,072
Oh!
Really?

1688
01:29:05,074 --> 01:29:07,941
You guys, they're
from mavis. Thank you.
Oh, wow!

1689
01:29:08,477 --> 01:29:09,710
Oh, here.

1690
01:29:09,712 --> 01:29:11,545
Show business,
I love it.

1691
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:12,846
(Orchestral music playing)

1692
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,981
Shh, you guys.
You guys, listen.
Listen.

1693
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:22,122
Man: Overture and places,
please.

1694
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:32,099
I'm here to see my wife.

1695
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:33,700
Um, you can't go
back there just now...

1696
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,502
That's not my problem,
old man.

1697
01:29:35,504 --> 01:29:36,954
Hey, hey, hey,
just a minute...

1698
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,405
I don't give a damn
about your show.

1699
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:40,607
My name is pennington
and I wanna see
my wife now!

1700
01:30:06,435 --> 01:30:08,935
Mr. Pennington?
You're Andy's husband,
is that right?

1701
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,173
I take it you're one
of her associates.

1702
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:14,808
