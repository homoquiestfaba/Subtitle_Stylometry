What up, man?

352
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,301
So you ain't wearin' no pants.

353
00:25:52,428 --> 00:25:55,848
Jeez. You steal all this stuff?

354
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,392
No... I collected it.

355
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:01,229
That's a good one, I should
use that one, collected.

356
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,648
You can use anything you want
as long as you return it.

357
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:06,359
This is Dr. Greiss,
known for his famous

358
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,194
confrontational therapy.

359
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:11,239
Yes, yes! Oh, do you want
to see my favorite thing?

360
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:16,285
Doctor, your critics have been
extremely vocal

361
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:18,704
about this radical, what do you call it?

362
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:21,958
Confrontational Therapy.
Some liken it to torture.

363
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,668
What do you say about that?

364
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,378
I've heard it all before.

365
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,129
What they fail to realize

366
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:30,049
is that we need to confront our fears.

367
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:32,426
Conquer them, not coddle them.

368
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:35,263
Our deepest fears, the ones that
terrify us the most,

369
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,515
cannot be alleviated by locking
people up and drugging them

370
00:26:37,557 --> 00:26:40,059
into catatonia.
It's our moral imperative

371
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,311
to get to the root of these fears
and destroy them.

372
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:44,105
Confrontational therapy does this.

373
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:47,567
Yes, there are side effects,
but there are side effects

374
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,402
with chemotherapy and surgery.

375
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,778
We submit our patients

376
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,447
to their phobic triggers
in a safe environment.

377
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:55,741
Reprogramming them, so to speak.

378
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:58,619
Eloise was the biggest asylum
in the world at one time.

379
00:26:58,661 --> 00:27:03,541
It had its own zip code, farm,
fire department, train station.

380
00:27:04,183 --> 00:27:06,685
The first X-ray machine
was developed here,

381
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,103
tested on patients.

382
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:09,855
Not you, Emma...

383
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:12,816
Oh, oh, oh, do you want to
hear about the lobotomy craze?

384
00:27:12,858 --> 00:27:14,359
Yo, man, he's touching me.

385
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:15,986
- Stop.
- Maybe not.

386
00:27:16,228 --> 00:27:19,106
( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )

387
00:27:19,147 --> 00:27:21,982
Hey, man, come on, man, cut
the camera off, dude. Cut the camera!

388
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:25,111
Look, I took out the IR filter,
so it only shoots infrared.

389
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:26,987
I've been dying to try this out!

390
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:28,739
I'm hoping to capture some
ghosts with it.

391
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,866
I just recorded three seconds,
one for each of us.

392
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:32,493
Good. Three seconds.

393
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,662
Beautiful, buddy.

394
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:37,956
Hey, Scott. I have
a proposition for you.

395
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:42,252
How would you like to use your
camera here tonight?

396
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:45,505
Uh... listen, I need to collect
some papers...

397
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:47,257
Documents.

398
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,301
Documents... on my aunt,
and they're locked away

399
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:51,720
in a top secret location...

400
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:53,471
- Annex.
- What?

401
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,472
- The Annex.
- Yes.

402
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:57,849
The Annex, it's on
the 5th floor of the Annex.

403
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,726
Yeah, let's go!

404
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:01,018
The Annex, the Annex,
it's on the 5th floor,

405
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,478
I need to get permission first.

406
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,604
No! He's gotta get
permission first.

407
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:05,398
But she's running away.

408
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,442
Yes, you go in through here,

409
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:10,528
then down this corridor,
up the back stairs.

410
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,572
The administration building
is locked tight,

411
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:14,449
but you can get in
through the power station.

412
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,616
They never lock it.

413
00:28:15,658 --> 00:28:17,869
Oh, oh, this will be great!

414
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,037
- This will be, an adventure!
- And he's touching me.

415
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:21,388
[WOMAN'S VOICE]
Hey, Scotty, can you help me

416
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,890
with the groceries, please?

417
00:28:22,931 --> 00:28:24,600
There's just a few more bags in the car!

418
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:25,809
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

419
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:29,021
- Who's that?
- I'll be back.

420
00:28:29,063 --> 00:28:30,481
Keep walking back slow.
Look at this.

421
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:33,359
No, no, no, hell no, man.

422
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,693
I know what you're thinking.

423
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:36,612
I am not going to Eloise,

424
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:39,831
with a crazy dude, jumping on
the bed like he's Daffy Duck.

425
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:41,024
You know what, I'm done, dude.

426
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,693
Look, he obviously knows all
of this shit like the back

427
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,403
of his hand, we're golden.

428
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:45,487
Rain Man's on me.

429
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:46,655
Yeah, you babysit him.

430
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:48,115
Okay.

431
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:49,741
This is them.

432
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:54,121
This is Dell. This is...
I don't know his name.

433
00:28:54,162 --> 00:28:55,622
What the hell are you doing here?

434
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:57,457
I was just gonna ask you
the same question.

435
00:28:57,499 --> 00:29:00,544
I live here, he's my bro and
you've got 15 seconds

436
00:29:00,586 --> 00:29:02,129
before I call 911.

437
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,672
- Whoa, whoa.
- I have friends!

438
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,509
How did you meet them, sweetie?

439
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:09,970
No, no, we found him,
we found him, all right?

440
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:11,179
We just want to take a tour of Eloise,

441
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,264
and Scott's the best person...

442
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:13,640
How did you meet?

443
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,425
- [DELL] We met him on his site.
- Yeah.

444
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:16,510
He's got a hot, little site @eloise.

445
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:18,386
We looked him up, right?

446
00:29:18,428 --> 00:29:19,805
We found the site, his picture's
on there, all the information.

447
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:21,431
It's great.

448
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:24,768
Okay, well then,
tomorrow we can call the staff

449
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,269
and get back to you guys.

450
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,438
No, no, I was gonna use my new camera!

451
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,523
He wants to use his new camera.

452
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:31,024
I just said that.

453
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:32,484
I need to talk to you
outside for a minute.

454
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:33,610
Okay.

455
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:35,612
Scotty, you stay with Dill.

456
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:38,973
Jacob, no. Don't leave me...

457
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,903
Okay, just let me start
from the beginning, all right?

458
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:47,157
My father just passed away, okay?

459
00:29:47,198 --> 00:29:50,285
Hey, man, Jacob, man, come on, man,
y'all playing games.

460
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:51,786
I wanna touch you.

461
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:54,538
No, not with no pants on.
Get your pants on.

462
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,599
And I know it's asking a lot,
but no one knows

463
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:59,125
that place better than your brother.

464
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,077
[DELL] Put your pants on!

465
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:02,870
I know, and he's all I've got
and I won't

466
00:30:02,912 --> 00:30:04,497
have him taken advantage of.

467
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:05,957
He is obsessed with that place

468
00:30:05,998 --> 00:30:08,459
and if he wanders off
or something happens...

469
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:10,836
Quick in, quick out.
I'll watch him, I promise.

470
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:11,813
You'll watch him?

471
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,857
- Yeah.
- In Eloise?

472
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:17,318
I think you're gonna have your
hands full keeping up with him.

473
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,403
- Put your head here.
- Yo, man.

474
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:19,463
Put it there. Put it on!

475
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:21,089
[PIA]
Now that you got him all riled up,

476
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:23,216
it's impossible to say no to him.

477
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:29,205
Okay, quick in, quick out,
and I'm coming.

478
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:30,999
Yes! Thank you.

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,293
Hey... Pia's in.

480
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,837
You guys wanna see something funny?

481
00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:37,922
- Scott, don't!
- ( CHUCKLING ) No.

482
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:39,924
Don't!

483
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:44,520
No, this will be fun,
this will be an adventure.

484
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:45,430
Yeah, yeah...

485
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:47,974
- It's all good.
- ...it's gonna be something.

486
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:50,567
Don't look too happy about it.

487
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:52,778
It's gonna be a disaster,
that's what it's gonna be.

488
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,946
This is ridiculous.

489
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:55,614
Pants!

490
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:58,492
Do you need like a bag or...

491
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:00,369
Bag!

492
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:05,999
Has anyone ever died during
this therapy, Doctor?

493
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:10,379
Medicine is not an exact science.

494
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:18,011
Why is he so fascinated with this place?

495
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:20,097
Careful, careful, man, careful!

496
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:22,558
Our mom used to be a nurse here.

497
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:25,436
She left for work one day
when I was about four,

498
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:27,855
so Scotty was six.

499
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:29,523
She just never came home.

500
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:32,484
Never heard from her again, either.

501
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:34,945
Sometimes I think Scott still thinks

502
00:31:34,987 --> 00:31:37,030
she's in here for something.

503
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:39,825
- So, you know where we are?
- Yes... I have a map.

504
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:42,453
You got a map. So, what used
to be here, anyways?

505
00:31:42,494 --> 00:31:44,121
It's always been this, it's a cemetery.

506
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:46,123
Potter's Field, it's where they
buried the patients.

507
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:47,750
The patients? You mean all this
time we walking

508
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,668
on crazy dead people?

509
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,587
Of course they're crazy,
it's a mental institution.

510
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:54,631
Our dad went a little nuts
with Scotty needing

511
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,800
special attention and all,
so it was pretty much

512
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,761
up to me to look out for him
once we realized

513
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:01,388
she was never coming back.

514
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,016
That's gotta be pretty tough
for a four-year-old.

515
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:07,186
Yeah, but... that's life
I guess.

516
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:10,439
So, what was it like living
without a mom?

517
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:12,524
You have no idea.

518
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:15,819
Actually I do.

519
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:19,072
I barely even remember her.

520
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:21,742
When she left I was probably
a little angry,

521
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:24,828
so I tried to just forget all about her.

522
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,455

This patient suffers from an

924
01:09:09,936 --> 01:09:12,188
The most severe and frightening
of which is specifically...

925
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,148
the fear of waking up and discovering...

926
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,483
that you're buried alive.
