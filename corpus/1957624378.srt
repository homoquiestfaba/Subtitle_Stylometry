MUSSED-UP HAIR,

509
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,908
THE FERRARI.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

510
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:01,646
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
I'M SOME KIND OF
MALE MODEL WANNABE.

511
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,487
FACE IT, RALPH,
EVERYTHING YOU DO,
SAY, OR WEAR

512
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,758
IS SHREWDLY CALCULATED
TO ATTRACT MEMBERS
OF THE OPPOSITE SEX.

513
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,693
EVERYTHING
EVERYBODY DOES IS.

514
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,861
YEAH, BUT FOR YOU
IT'S, LIKE,

515
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,964
THE CENTRAL ACTIVITY
OF YOUR LIFE, RIGHT?

516
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,801
SOMEHOW I SUSPECT IT'S
ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY.

517
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,772
WELL, YEAH. AS FAR BACK
AS I CAN REMEMBER.

518
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,541
Man: HEY, TERESA,
GET BACK IN THE HOUSE

519
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,244
BEFORE I SMACK YOU
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO BAY RIDGE, HUH.

520
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,146
FUCK YOU, VINNY,
YOU...PIGFUCKER!

521
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,715
HEY, DON'T YOU RAISE
YOUR VOICE TO ME!

522
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,849
Ralph: I GREW UP
IN BROOKLYN,

523
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,753
WHICH COULD BE THE SOURCE OF
ALL MY PROBLEMS RIGHT THERE.

524
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,222
SEE, MY MOTHER'S JEWISH,
AND MY FATHER'S ITALIAN,

525
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,660
WHICH, I GUESS, SORT OF
MAKES ME A PIZZA BAGEL.

526
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,662
ANYWAY, JEWS AND ITALIANS
ARE VERY SIMILAR.

527
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,799
OF COURSE, YOU'LL NEVER HEAR
ANY ITALIAN SAYING THAT.

528
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,802
BOTH HAVE GENEROUS TRADITIONS
OF GUILT. CATHOLIC GUILT,

529
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,170
WHICH FOCUSES MOSTLY ON SEX,

530
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,606
AND JEWISH GUILT,
 WHICH DEALS MAINLY IN FOOD.

531
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,544
Woman: MARLENE, LITTLE RALPHIE
WON'T EAT VEGETABLES?

532
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,845
A BILLION CHINAMEN
ARE STARVING,

533
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:11,283
AND THIS
MESHUGGENEH
SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE
 ANYTHING GREEN!

534
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,285
Ralph: MY FATHER'S SIDE
OF THE FAMILY IS HUGE

535
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,687
BECAUSE HE HAD 5 SISTERS
WHO ALL HAD CHILDREN,

536
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,088
WHICH MADE FOR LOTS
OF COUSINS,

537
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,859
AND LOTS OF BIRTHDAYS,
AND HOLIDAYS, AND SUNDAYS.

538
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,093
GOOD OLD DAYS.

539
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:27,666
I USED TO BE LIKE THIS
TO THE UNDERBOSS
OF THE GAMBINO FAMILY.

540
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,868
HE'S THE GUY WHO MADE
BIG PAUL.

541
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,036
SHUT THE HELL UP, TOMMY!

542
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,105
YOU'RE ABOUT
AS CONNECTED AS A PHONE
WITH AN UNPAID BILL!

543
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,608
OH, YOU'RE A LIAR! YOU
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN A LIAR!

544
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:41,613
LITTLE RALPHIE, WOMEN
ARE THE DOWNFALL OF ALL
MEN IN THIS WORLD.

545
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,782
LITTLE RALPH, GET YOUR
HAND OUT OF YOUR TROUSERS!

546
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:48,687
WHAT, HE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT
FROM ALL THE OTHER MEN
IN THE FAMILY?

WELL, OK.

566
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,086
I MET THIS GUY FRESHMAN
YEAR AT ORIENTATION.

567
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,689
AND, UM, WE TOOK THIS
HIKING CLASS TOGETHER.

568
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,725
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE
ONE-CREDIT DEALS,
YOU KNOW?

569
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,663
AND, UH, AND THE WHOLE
CLASS IS TAKING A HIKE
IN THE WOODS,

570
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:10,068
AND HE STARTED READING
 ALOUD FROM
JONATHAN 
LIVINGSTON SEAGULL.

571
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,704
IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT
BOOKS IN HISTORY.

572
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,705
IT WAS ROMANTIC.

573
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:18,410
ANYWAY, UM, SO WE ENDED
UP SHARING A TENT AND...

574
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:21,780
SO, WERE YOU GUYS
FRIENDS AFTERWARDS?

575
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:25,216
WELL, ACTUALLY,
WE WENT OUT FOR 3 YEARS.

576
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,851
WHOA.

577
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,086
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

578
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:33,792
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
WE JUST GREW IN
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

579
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,927
BUT, UM, WE STILL TALK.

580
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,664
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU'RE JUST, LIKE,
FRIENDS?

581
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:40,932
LIKE, HEY, BUDDY?

582
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,869
WHAT, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
FRIENDS THAT ARE WOMEN?

583
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,938
NO, I DO. IT'S--

584
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,441
BUT I STILL
SLEEP WITH THEM.

585
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,776
WELL, WOULDN'T IT BE
NICE JUST TO HANG OUT
WITH A WOMAN

586
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,881
WITHOUT THE SPECTER
OF SEX HANGING OVER
YOUR HEADS ALL THE TIME?

587
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,354
IT IS NICE.

00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,932

UH...

590
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,434
A GAY WOMAN.

591
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,268
ARE YOU ONE?

592
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:27,105
'CAUSE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT A GAY MAN.

593
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,506
THAT'S TRUE.

594
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,809
NO, I'M A WRITER.

00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,343

596
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,079

OH, YOU'RE
AN IMAGE MAKER.

602
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,192
YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY CONSIDER
KILLING YOURSELF.

603
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,763
IF YOU'RE NICE,
I MIGHT PUT YOU
IN ONE OF MY ADS.

604
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,200
GREAT.

605
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,938
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE A WRITER.

606
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,107
UH, SORT OF.

607
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,542
THINKING ABOUT
BECOMING ONE.

608
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,513
YOU A DYKE?

609
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,516
SORT OF.

610
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,984
I'M THINKING
ABOUT BECOMING ONE.

611
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:19,424
I NEVER THOUGHT OF SEXUAL
ORIENTATION AS A MAYBE,
KIND OF, SORT OF THING.

612
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:23,361
YEAH, WELL,
I'M DEFINITELY
CHANGING SOMETHING.

613
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:27,499
WELL, HOW ABOUT SOMETHING
NORMAL, LIKE YOUR OVERALLS--

614
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,534
I THINK I'M GONNA
CHANGE MY NAME.

615
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,569
TO WHAT?

616
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,037
REX.

617
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,875
REX WHAT?
NO, JUST REX.

618
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:37,742
YEAH.

619
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,910
UH, WELL, I THINK MAYBE
YOU SHOULD START

620
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,980
WITH SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE LOW-KEY,
LIKE YOUR HAIRSTYLE.

621
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,283
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT SHAVING IT OFF.

622
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,050
REX IT IS.

623
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,585
I THINK YOU SHOULD
STICK WITH REX.

624
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,486
YOU THINK SO?
YEAH.

625
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,623
DO YOU WANT TO GO TAKE
A WALK OR SOMETHING?

626
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,457
WITH YOU?

627
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,893
NO, JUST DID YOU
WANT TO GO WALKING...

628
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,629
[LAUGHS]
YEAH, WITH ME.

629
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,165
UH, I HAVEN'T FINISHED
MY COFFEE. SO...

630
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,568
WELL, THAT'S THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THE SOLO PLASTIC CUP.

631
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:07,238
YOU CAN JUST GO
OUTSIDE WITH IT.

632
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,509
ALL RIGHT.

633
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,478
I GUESS.

634
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,013
OK.
OK.

635
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,181
LET'S GO.

636
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,515
I WAS SERIOUS
ABOUT THE AD.

OOH, BIG WORD.

640
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,991
AH, FRESH OYSTERS.
HEY.

641
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,259
DO YOU LIKE OYSTERS?

642
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,527
NO, I DON'T REALLY
GET INTO PUTTING WET,

643
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:32,897

THINGS IN MY MOUTH.

644

GUESS YOU DON'T
EAT PUSSY, THEN.

645
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:38,536
I COULD.

646
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,639
Rex, grunting: BAG IT.

647
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,241
COME ON...

648
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,510
NO, YOU COME ON,

00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,545
OK, OK.

00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,921
WHAT DO YOU NEED,
A CRANE?

651
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,561
WELL...

652
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,365
I CAN ONLY COME
FROM GETTING HEAD,
ANYWAY, SO...

653
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,333
AND I'M HAVING
MY PERIOD.

654
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,169
WAIT, WAIT. AND YOU WANT
ME TO GO DOWN ON YOU?

655
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,303
YEAH, SO?

656
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,572
YOU HAVE YOUR PERIOD.

657
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,911
MY GIRLFRIEND DOES IT
ALL THE TIME,
YOU LITTLE SISSY MARY.

00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,980
[GROANS]

659
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,382
SOUNDS LIKE
A REAL BAD ASS.

660
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,049
I LIKE HER.

661
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,619
I COULD SET UP
A RENDEZVOUS.

662
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:28,620
MY PLACE?

663
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:29,420
YOU WISH.

664
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,289
HEY, IT WAS WORTH
A SHOT, YOU KNOW.

665
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,458
YOU ARE REALLY NOT...

666
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,027
NOT WELL.

667
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,663
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

668
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,699
WHAT'S NOT WELL
ABOUT ME?

669
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,167
MY LIFE ROCKS.

670
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,636
I GOT EVERYTHING I WANT.

671
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,670
I GOT A GREAT JOB.

672
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,538
I MAKE TONS OF MONEY.

673
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,706
I GET LAID EVERY NIGHT.

674
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,376
RALPH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET SO DEFENSIVE.

675
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,644
I WAS ONLY KIDDING.

676
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:53,544
WELL, I'M NOT
BEING DEFENSIVE.

677
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,649
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE
ALWAYS JUDGING ME...

678

LAST NIGHT,

I CONVERTED A LESBIAN

00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,666
MY LIFE IS SICK.

I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T

I MEAN, IF YOU'RE NOT
COMFORTABLE TALKING TO ME,

697
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:49,634
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
THINK ABOUT TALKING TO
SOMEBODY ELSE.

698
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:50,768
WHAT, LIKE A SHRINK?

699
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:55,606

THE COOP WOKE UP
IN THE MORNING,

00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,185
HE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR,

707
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,253
HE KNEW EXACTLY

WHEN HE WENT OUT
TO GET THE BAD GUYS.

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,777
JUST A SURENESS

THAT CAME FROM
KNOWING WHO HE WAS.

719
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,551

738
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,201
I WAS TELLING HER
HOW GREAT MY LIFE IS,

HOW I HAVE ALL THESE GREAT

WHAT DO YOU WANT
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE?

00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,670
I HAVE SEX ALL THE TIME
WITH THESE WOMEN,

THESE WOMEN WHOSE NAMES
I DON'T KNOW.

00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,840
AND WHAT I REALLY
WANT FROM LIFE

757
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,675
IS A--IS A WOMAN

758
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,244
TO START A FAMILY,
TO HAVE KIDS.

759
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,546
AND I CAN'T SEE
THAT HAPPENING

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,414

761
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,582

MISERABLE NOW?

 THE EXPERIENCE I HAD

774
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,716

SOME KIND OF ADVERTISEMENT.

BUT YOU MEAN LIKE
FREUDIAN SLIPS OR--

781

THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A FREUDIAN SLIP.

782
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,833
IT'S YOUR CAPACITY
TO SUBLIMATE

 SO SUCC-SEXUAL.

01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,570
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD ON. HE DIDN'T
HAVE ANY CHANGE.

1543
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:51,573
NO CHANGE, BUT I'M
STILL WORKING HER.
IT'S NOT GONNA STOP ME.

1544
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:52,908
NO, NO, NO.

1545
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:53,876
I'M SERIOUS.

1546
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,545
FOR ONE NIGHT,
WE CAN JUST NOT
TALK ABOUT SEX

1547
01:11:56,578 --> 01:12:01,450
OR RELATIONSHIPS
OR WOMEN AT ALL?

1548
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,217
YEAH, SURE.

1549
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,485
YEAH, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING.

1550
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:06,522
WE CAN TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

1551
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:16,532
WE CAN...HIT THIS DOOBIE.

1552
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,567
RIGHT?
YES!

1553
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,503
YES!
GIVE ME SOME
OF THAT.

1554
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,109
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I NEED WOMEN

1555
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:29,978
WHEN I GOT
CHUNKY STICKY
MONKEY.

1556
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,881
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
COSMO
 HAD A REALLY
 INTERESTING ARTICLE

1557
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:36,018
ABOUT THAT. THEY HAD,
LIKE, 5 GUYS WHO HAD
GIVEN UP SEX--

1558
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:37,186
WHOA! WHOA! OK.

1559
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,755
PETER, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH YOU AND THESE
WOMEN MAGAZINES?

1560
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:42,591
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

1561
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:43,859
I MEAN, IT'S JUST--I
MEAN, THEY'RE GOOD,
YOU KNOW?

1562
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:48,564
Y-YOU CAN OCCASIONALLY
GLEAN A GOOD TIP
ON--ON WOMEN FROM THEM.

1563
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:49,898
THEY'RE GOOD.

1564
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,000
DO THEY WORK?

1565
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,635
UH...NO.

1566
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,938
BUT, UH, WELL, OK,
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE,

1567
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:59,041
I HAD THAT DATE
WITH CLAIRE
THE OTHER NIGHT, RIGHT?

1568
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:01,443
AND, UH, AND THINGS
GOT A LITTLE HAIRY.

1569
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:02,711
I MEAN, PUN INTENDED.

1570
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,546
SHAVE HER.
I BET SHE'D DIG IT.

1571
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,582
NO, NO. THAT ACTUALLY
WASN'T THE PROBLEM.

1572
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:10,219
IT WAS THAT, WELL,
LIKE, SHE WANTED ME
TO GO DOWN ON HER.

1573
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,622
AND THIS WAS
A PROBLEM FOR YOU?

1574
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:18,927
NO. NO, NO, NO.
IT WAS JUST THAT
I'M NOT SURE IF, UH,

1575
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,196
IF WHAT I DID WORKED.

1576
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,034
WORKED?

1577
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,703
WELL, NO, YOU KNOW.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

1578
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:31,240
I MEAN, I--I--I DON'T
KNOW IF I HAVE A
TECHNIQUE, YOU KNOW?

1579
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:33,075
I MEAN, IT'S KIND
OF A MESS DOWN THERE.

1580
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:33,942
SERIOUSLY.
OH, SURE.

1581
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,878
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING, REALLY.

1582
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,913
OH, YOU'VE NEVER
DONE IT BEFORE?

1583
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,115
NO, IT'S JUST THAT
I--I'VE DONE IT

1584
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:43,185
LOTS OF TIMES,
JUST NOT WITH...

1585
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:44,286
A WOMAN.
NO.

1586
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,523
OK, FUCK YOU. OK?
ALL RIGHT, NOW I'M
TRYING TO TALK--

1587
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:48,824
I'M SORRY,
MR. SENSITIVE.

1588
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,559
AND YOU'RE BEING
 AN ASSHOLE ABOUT IT...

1589
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,528
I'M SORRY.
AND I DON'T WANT
YOUR ADVICE.

1590
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:53,962
OK. OK!

1591
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:58,567
ASK RALPH, HE'S
THE RESIDENT EXPERT.

1592
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:02,971
YEAH.
NO, I'M SORRY.
NOT ANYMORE.

1593
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,808
OH, COME ON.
SERIOUSLY, HELP ME OUT.

1594
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,676
NO, LOOK, GUYS,
YOU KNOW,
TO EACH HIS OWN.

1595
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:08,944
YOU HAVE YOUR
 LITTLE THING,

1596
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:11,113
WHICH I'M
SURE IS
PRETTY STRANGE,

1597
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:13,282
AND YOU GOT
YOURS.

1598
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:15,884
LET'S JUST KEEP
IT THAT WAY.

1599
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:18,587
Claire: I FINALLY
WENT OUT WITH PETER.

1600
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,023
Elizabeth:
YEAH? HOW DID IT GO?

1601
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:24,126
HMM. I DON'T KNOW.

1602
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,561
WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO?

1603
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,162
WELL...I GAVE HIM HEAD.

1604
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,932
OH, CUT TO THE CHASE,
WHY DON'T YOU, CLAIRE?

1605
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,768
THAT'S THE BEST PART,
BABE.

1606
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,770
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

1607
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,705
WHAT? YOU ACT LIKE IT'S
A TRAGEDY OR SOMETHING.

1608
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:38,640
NO, BUT HAVE YOU EVER
THOUGHT ABOUT MAYBE

1609
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,743
ESTABLISHING JUST A LITTLE
EMOTIONAL INTIMACY?

1610
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:44,112
HEY, MAYBE GET
TO KNOW THE GUY.

1611
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:47,316
I DID.
IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE.

1612
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:48,417
CLAIRE...

1613
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:52,554
WHAT? I LIKE DOING IT.
I HAPPEN TO BE
VERY GOOD AT IT.

1614
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,091
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1615
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,326
YOU KNOW HOW PETER'S
ALWAYS QUOTING

1616
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,597
VOGUE
 AND
BAZAAR
AND ALL THOSE
 MAGAZINES?

1617
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,566
I SAW THIS BACK ISSUE
IN HIS BATHROOM,

1618
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,668
AND IT'S FOLDED BACK
TO THIS ARTICLE CALLED,

1619
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:11,740
"HEAD GAMES:
SHOW HIM HOW TO DO IT,
AND YOU BOTH WIN."

1620
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:15,878
I FELT REALLY BAD
FOR HIM

1621
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:19,648
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE HAS
ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE
WITH WOMEN.

1622
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:23,185
BETTER NO EXPERIENCE
THAN THE ENTIRE
METROPOLITAN AREA.

1623
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:26,722
AND WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

1624
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:27,756
RALPH.

1625
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:33,228
OH, YOU'VE GOT
THAT BOY ON THE BRAIN,
GIRLFRIEND.

1626
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,897
YEAH.

1627
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:40,702
OH. SO, YOU LIKE HIM?

1628
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:41,637
PRETTY STUPID, HUH?

1629
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,338
WHY? BECAUSE OF THE
WHOLE THING WITH WOMEN?

1630
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,141
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING. ALL MEN HAVE
THAT THING WITH WOMEN.

1631
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:49,211
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY. I JUST...

1632
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:51,680
I DON'T BUY THAT.

1633
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,315
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM.

1634
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:56,718
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
ON YOUR MIND.

1635
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:01,757
[SIGHS]

1636
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,326
I CAN'T TAKE THIS
ANY MORE, MAN.

1637
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:07,362
I'VE BEEN CELIBATE
FOR I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG.

1638
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,098
YOU NEED TO GET LAID.
LIKE, A LOT.

1639
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:11,767
HE'S RIGHT. GET THIS
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.

1640
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,637
YOU SHOULD HAVE
AS MUCH SEX IN AS SHORT
A PERIOD OF TIME

1641
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:16,972
AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

1642
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:19,141
IT'D BE TOUGH FOR YOU TO
BREAK YOUR OWN RECORD.

1643
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,276
BUT I THINK
YOU SHOULD TRY.

1644
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,645
YOU GOTTA GET OUT
OF THIS CELIBATE MODE.

1645
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,713
FIND YOURSELF
A WILLING HONEY

1646
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,915
TO RELEASE
ALL THIS STRESS INTO.

1647
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:31,086
OR ONTO.
AS THE CASE MAY BE.

1648
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,323
NO, I--I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT OTHER WOMEN.

1649
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:37,326
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT ELIZABETH, HUH?

1650
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,662
WHY DO YOU SPEAK?
WHAT DID I SAY?

1651
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:42,698
NO, IT'S OK.
PETER'S RIGHT.

1652
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,666
I THINK
ABOUT ELIZABETH
ALL THE TIME.

1653
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,135
THEN CALL HER, MAN.
I'M SURE SHE'LL
TAKE YOU BACK.

1654
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:47,903
SHE WOULDN'T
TAKE ME BACK.

1655
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,805
SHE HATES ME.
 SHE HATES MY WORK.

1656
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:52,207
SHE THINKS I'M
A SUPERFICIAL,
MISOGYNISTIC,

1657
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,110
CHAUVINISTIC,
PHILANDERING PIG.

1658
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,411
YOU ARE.

1659
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,313
YOU WERE.

1660
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:59,348
THANKS.

1661
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:04,386
IT HAS, LIKE, UM, THIS BIG
ROMANTIC ENDING, RIGHT?

1662
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:05,520
AND THERE'S THIS PART
WHERE--

1663
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:10,192
WHERE GARY COOPER
PULLS AUDREY HEPBURN
ONTO THE TRAIN.

1664
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:13,395
AND, UH, AND I LOOK
OVER AT RALPH, AND, UH,

1665
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:16,398
AND HE'S, LIKE, CRYING.
 YOU KNOW?

1666
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:21,236
AND HE WASN'T EVEN TRYING
TO HIDE IT, YOU KNOW?
HE JUST...

1667
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,041
OH, GOD.

1668
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:28,276
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HIM
AT WONDER CAMP, YOU KNOW?

1669
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,947
HE JUST--HE'S JUST GOT
THIS WAY WITH KIDS, RIGHT.

1670
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:35,450
THERE'S THIS LITTLE GIRL,
 THIS ADORABLE LITTLE GIRL,

1671
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,453
AND HE GOT RIGHT DOWN
ON HIS KNEES,

1672
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:43,058
AND, UH, SHE HAD
 BROKEN HER DOLL.

1673
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:46,395
AND HE MADE HER
THIS NEW DOLL...

1674
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,433
AND, UM, AND THE WAY--

1675
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,502
THE WAY HE OPENS
DOORS FOR ME.

1676
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:58,907
YOU KNOW? IT JUST--IT
MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD.

1677
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:03,111
AND, UM...

1678
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:05,080
SHH.

1679
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:10,786
HE'S TRYING SO HARD
TO CHANGE FOR YOU,
ELIZABETH.

1680
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,389
WELL, HE HAD...

1681
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:18,126
HAS SUCH A...

1682
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,761
NATURAL AFFECTION
FOR WOMEN.

1683
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:20,896
WELL, THAT'S
EXACTLY IT, RIGHT?

1684
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:24,466
THAT IS EXACTLY THE BEST
AND THE WORST THING
ABOUT HIM.

1685
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:28,403
WELL, HONEY, YOU COULD
GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT
OF THE DOUBT.

1686
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,739
WELL, I TRIED.

1687
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,009
BUT?

1688
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:38,080
BUT I NEVER FELT LIKE
I COULD TRUST HIM.
YOU KNOW?

1689
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,917
WELL...

1690
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:45,454
THEY SAY CREAM
RISES TO THE TOP.

1691
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:49,091
HE MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.

1692
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:53,495
SOME MEN CAN
ACTUALLY CHANGE
FOR THE RIGHT WOMAN.

1693
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:57,199
CLAIRE, YOU CAN'T CHANGE
SOMEONE THAT MUCH.

1694
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:00,135
BESIDES, I MEAN, WHY WOULD
HE WANT TO CHANGE

1695
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:03,371
WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD
IS TELLING HIM THAT
THE WAY HE IS

1696
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,541
IS EXACTLY THE WAY TO BE?
