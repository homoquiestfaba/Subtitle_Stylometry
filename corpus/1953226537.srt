1
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:06,416
In 1785, several children

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:10,094
in the township of Blair, Maryland

3
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:14,765
accused Elly kedward of witchcraft.

4
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:20,640
She was found guilty and
banished in the middle of winter.

5
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:24,589
It was assumed she died from exposure.

6
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:29,547
The following year, all of her accusers

7
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:36,378
and half the town's children had vanished

8
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:38,338
fearing a curse.

9
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:42,658
The entire township fled
as soon as the weather broke

10
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,367
and vowed never to utter the name

11
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:50,067
Elly kedward again.

12
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:12,474
Curse of the Blair witch

13
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,808
you look a little blurry.
Let me zoom out on you.

14
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:32,809
- Ok?
- Ok.

15
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:34,951
- More.
- Got it?

16
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:36,527
Okay, I got you.

17
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:39,281
- This is my home.
- Ok.

18
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:43,021
Wich I am leaving the comforts
of for the weekend

19
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:46,342
to explore the Blair witch.

20
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:50,030
Well, Heather was probably

21
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:52,049
one of the two or three best students

22
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,449
that I've had the pleasure of teaching.

23
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,409
She was committed she was
energetic she was very creative.

24
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,828
She was someone who I think

25
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,153
remind me of myself really a lot at her age.

26
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:10,086
She was looking to develop
and find her voice.

27
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:12,614
Plus, she was interested in documentaries

28
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:15,178
which my own background is in documentaries.

29
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:17,737
I met Heather in high school.

30
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:21,633
I met her when I moved

31
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:23,854
to Montgomery county Maryland.

32
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:27,740
She was one of the first
people thet I actully met.

33
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,826
Just met her in passing in the hallway

34
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:33,010
and then we were in a play together.

35
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:37,303
And, uh, that's how
we really became acquainted.

36
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:40,783
She was this tiny little thing that

37
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,342
first go in and, of course, mom was there

38
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:47,280
and the baby's been brought up
for the first time.

39
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,989
I stick my arms out to go pick her up, and

40
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,582
" careful, carefull, you'll break her".

41
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,425
I said " I didn't break the others
how am I going to break this one?"

42
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:58,335
So, uh, I picked her up and held her and

43
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:02,628
I guess for an hour or so
before I gave her back to mama.

44
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,237
She had submitted a proposal to me

45
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:09,197
to do a short documentary on

46
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:11,550
the legend of Blair witch.

47
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:15,047
It was something I had never heard
of before to tell you truth.

48
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:17,122
- we're doing a documentary.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:19,308
- about the Blair witch.
- Oh.

50
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:23,779
- oh, have you heard of the Blair witch?
- That's and old, old, old story

51
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,962
- as I remember.
- He wa a legend

52
00:03:27,963 --> 00:03:32,104
that had developed in this area
over the course of couple of centuries.

53
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:37,628
Whenever a particular bad sequence
of events happened in this community

54
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:43,262
there seemed to be a tendency
to blame it on Blair witch

55
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:46,642
who apparently was a woman
who had been cast out

56
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,161
during the colonial era as a witch.

57
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:53,774
It seem like a great opportunity
to interview people

58
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:58,810
who had been passing down
this legend for a couple of centuries.

59
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,626
Could you just run it for a
couple of feet for me

60
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,979
- so that we can check that it's ok.
- Sure.

61
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,850
Joshua was more glitz.

62
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:10,996
He thought it would be cool
to be in the film business.

63
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:13,919
He was not willing I don't think

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,937
to do the kind of work that was
really necessary

65
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:20,098
to develop a voice.

66
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,860
I think Heather and Josh were really
sort of polar opposites in a lot of ways,

67
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:28,792
but clearly they liked each other.

68
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:31,230
I didn't know Heather very well I think.

69
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,703
I guess I really only met her once

70
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:37,528
and that's when she was talking about

71
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:41,722
the Blair witch documentart
and going into the woods

72
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:43,767
and wanting Josh to be a part of that.

73
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:46,488
They collaborated on several
projects together.

74
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:49,599
I mentioned to her a couple of
times that I was concerned

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,899
that his some of the negative
aspects of-of his

76
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:59,146
really lack of-of commitment
and energy would

77
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:01,196
perhaps be negative for her, but

78
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:04,644
it turns out that they did
like working together.

79
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:08,446
It didn't really go over too well
cuz I remember we fought about it

80
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:10,391
before he left.

81
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:14,953
And I mean, I feel really badly
about that now

82
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:17,666
cuz, I mean we argued horribly

83
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,215
but I just had this I just had this feeling.

84
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:24,337
I didn't want him to go off
with him. It was just something about

85
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:27,372
her that rubbed me the wrong way

86
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:29,864
it was just instinct, I guess

87
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,504
I didn't want him to go off
for the whole weekend

88
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:35,768
so what's up? Are you happy
with the way the documentary is going?

89
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:36,490
Yes I am.

90
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:38,013
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

91
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:41,228
And I'm very pleasantly surprised
by our little Mikey

92
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,882
- our little Mikey?
- Little Mikey

93
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:47,664
when he was a little kid he was
a pain in the, uh, you know

94
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:51,727
he was a pain. He was, uh
he was really, uh,

95
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:53,881
always pushing my parents' buttons

96
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:58,079
um, sort of the devil with the
halo on his head

97
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,172
we had the golden rule of on
cursing in the house

98
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:04,723
and of course, he'd have to walk
by and slip out the little ones

99
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:10,721
nothing bad, but he was always
sort of, you know, on the side

100
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:13,993
and, you know, they'd catch it
and then you'd catch it

101
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,463
so he was always that kind of character

102
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:19,666
I met him a couple of times actually

103
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:25,008
Josh used to go with Mike to go
drinking and stuff and

104
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,778
um, but I wouldn't say I knew
him really well

105
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,975
the last night I saw him he was excited

106
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:37,932
he was really happy with himself
he came into the house

107
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:41,657
he was all packed and ready
to go for the next day

108
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:44,669
and we sat down. We had
a cup of coffee together

109
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,856
and we talked about the whole
the whole thing

110
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:52,409
he really didn't know too much about it.
That's what they were going to find out

111
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,291
but it was something he really
felt that he loved doing

112
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:58,800
you know, doing the sound
equipment stuff, and

113
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:02,019
you know, I just told him to go
out and be happy

114
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,496
make yourself somthing.

115
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:06,197
- I could help you, but I'd
rather stay here and record - ok

116
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:09,324
- packs are on.
- Let's rock - we're ready to go

117
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:13,242
- we gotta go up to the shack? The shanty?
- Yeah

118
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:14,243
wow

119
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:21,924
- yeah, that can help the...
- Oh, my God

120
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:30,253
the search of the three missing
Montgomery college students

121
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:32,298
continues in Frederick county tonight

122
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:35,853
as dozens of volunteers and state
officials join local forces

123
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:39,108
in what has now become a full-scale
search of the black hills area

124
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:43,139
local officials, combined with
over 100 search volunteers,

125
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,615
have failed to come up with any
signs of the three missing filmmakers

126
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:50,370
Montgomery college film
students Heather donahue

127
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:53,023
Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard

128
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,892
were reportedly shooting a school project

129
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,622
about a local myth called the Blair witch

130
00:07:57,623 --> 00:08:01,842
at this time their whereabouts
are still unknow

131
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,903
Josh feels it's necessary to
look at the map now

132
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:17,421
even though I know where we're
going, and we're going straight up there

133
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:19,649
if you'd know where we're going
we wouldn't be hiking like

134
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,655
- we're in the middle of the woods.
- Some of it is off-trail hiking

135
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:26,365
I have harbored some guilt

136
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:31,795
cuz, as I looked back over
the proposal later

137
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:35,074
I realized that I had neglected
to notice that

138
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:38,448
Heather had suggested going into the woods

139
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:41,579
for a couple of days, working on the film

140
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,725
we started to wonder the next day

141
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,351
and my parents started panicking

142
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:50,376
and for weeks after that it was just numb

143
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:55,771
I don't really remember feeling
too much other that numbness

144
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,871
when I saw her mother

145
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:58,872
that's

146
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:03,920
that was probably the first
time I really felt it

147
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:06,904
and I started to cry

148
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:12,841
the only piece of evidence found by police

149
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:15,257
was Joshua Leonard's car

150
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:18,172
parked on black rock road

151
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:23,391
we checked the car over completley
never found any clues with the vehicle

152
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:28,426
we checked with witnesses that
may have seen the film students

153
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:31,094
and never could we could never locate 'em

154
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:35,608
the black hills search of three missing
filmmakers has been called off

155
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,131
ten days and thousands of man-hours
have been unable to produce

156
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:42,571
any clues to the cause of the
mysterious disappearances

157
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:45,516
family and friends of the Montgomery
college graduates

158
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:50,737
are holding on to the hope that
someone or something will provide some answers

159
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:54,029
well, when the story turned into
a really big story

160
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,034
I went to the sheriff's office and I
tried to talk with him

161
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:58,345
and he's really been no help

162
00:09:58,346 --> 00:09:59,346
I mean, it's. Uh

163
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,005
I joined the search party, and

164
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:06,962
I called when we didn't find
anything on the search party

165
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,842
and I told him I though we should
still keep looking

166
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:11,688
cuz I know there are clues out there

167
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:15,687
I still go out and I still look and
I know there's somthing out there

168
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,520
he's talked to me a few times, but
I... he just doesn't

169
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:21,839
he doesn't want to hear anything
I have to say.

170
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,203
- December 12, 1994
- Dear sheriff cravens

171
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:28,716
I have tried repeatedly to
reach you on the phone

172
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:31,403
but you have not returned any of my calls

173
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:33,829
you and I both know the history
of burkittsville

174
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,426
and the events that have earned
our town its peculiar reputation

175
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:40,192
past events have proven that
something evil resides

176
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:42,314
in the black hills that surround us

177
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:46,796
the same black hills that those three
young people hiked into a few month ago

178
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:48,507
and never came back from

179
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:53,015
I urge you to look to the past fot
the answers you seek

180
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:55,508
sincerely, dottie fulcher

181
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:59,696
they won't tell me anything
that why there's this

182
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:04,195
feeling that I have that they know
more than they're willing to talk about

183
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:08,262
I think that they don't want to
admit that they saw her and that's she's there

184
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:12,353
you know, Elly is not very far from
any of us at any time

185
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:15,123
and she chooses her time to appear

186
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:16,124
and um

187
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:21,301
they just don't want to acknowledge that

188
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:27,192
the origin

189
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:40,978
my name is luken Johnson and I'm a witch

190
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:44,797
mystic occurrences

191
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:56,937
witchcraft is basically a science

192
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:59,427
you have a delineation between paganism

193
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:03,052
or polytheistic religions more than one God

194
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:08,940
and witchcraft, which is a scientific
study of energies and materials

195
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:13,602
but the power of air,
I bless and consecrate thee

196
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:16,704
from the goddess to the God
soon would it be

197
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:20,393
wiccanism is a new religion

198
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:23,141
what you got to understand here, man, is

199
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,870
we lost most of the records for
what would be considered witchcraft

200
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,888
throughout the latter part
of the 1700 to 1800s

201
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:35,689
and a lot beforehad with
burning times as we refer to it

202
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:38,460
bring out Elizabeth selwin

203
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:43,717
these are when people were tortured
and killed.. The Salem witch hunts

204
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:46,632
a simple case of bad bread..
The grain in the bread..

205
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,111
Cuz hallucinogenics

206
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:51,519
you get a bunch of kids hallucinating
that someone is making fun of them

207
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,433
or torturing them, then, of course parents
are going to react in a protective manner

208
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:58,860
before you know it, people are
dying by hundreds because

209
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,290
so-and-so did somthing evil

210
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,966
witch

211
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,399
burn . Burn

212
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,343
most of the time it wasn't
anything to do with evil

213
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:13,221
these were people that were trying
to help through either natural lore, herbalism

214
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:18,300
any kind of medicine that may
not have been standard practice

215
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:20,036
burn the witch

216
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,161
but by the revolutionary war

217
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:30,746
these trials, which were quite
common at the time

218
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:36,656
had somewhat faded out and witchcraft had

219
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:40,868
was a thing of the past

220
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:42,765
except in the rural areas

221
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:47,727
and there we had a lot of
superstition among the populations

222
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:50,779
and people still practiced witchcraft

223
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,760
two example come to my mind

224
00:13:53,777 --> 00:13:58,110
one being a 1786 case

225
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:00,993
of the Blair witch of Maryland

226
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:07,254
the other one being the bell witch
of Adams, Tennessee, in 1817

227
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:12,358
now, while both of these cases are
interesting academically

228
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:17,880
I find the Blair witch of Maryland
the most colorful

229
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:20,614
I mean what's your take on the
Blair witch at this point?

230
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:24,274
- Do you think she exists?
- I don't know

231
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:30,864
this is burkittsville, formerly Blair

232
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:34,818
it is a small, quiet Maryland town

233
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:37,731
much like a small quiet town anywhere

234
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:41,310
I'm bill Barnes I'm the executive director

235
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:44,288
to the historical society here
in burkittsville

236
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,350
I've been that for quite a few years and

237
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:48,629
am know as the town historian

238
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,608
and I've tried to keep up with
our history and make it

239
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:56,191
be alive to the people that come behind me

240
00:14:56,192 --> 00:15:01,480
burkittsville was actually founded
on another old town by the name of Blair

241
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:08,253
and it was founded here in 1734 to
protect the Western approaches to Baltimore

242
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:11,875
from attack by the Indians and so forth

243
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:18,142
but it died out because of a witch

244
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,736
her name was Elly kedwards

245
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:28,447
and she took a bunch of the
children .. Kidnapped them

246
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:31,519
and carried them off into the woods
and they never found them again

247
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,042
and the people became very afraid
and they pulled up

248
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:36,459
and left and abandoned the town

249
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,966
and it stayed abandoned for 40 years

250
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:43,532
though records from this period
of history are scarce

251
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:47,755
this registry of the seafaring
vessel the reliant

252
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:50,378
shows that a woman name Elly kedward

253
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:53,909
the woman history has labeled
as the Blair witch

254
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,179
did in fact sail from Ireland to Baltimore

255
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,553
in the summer of 1769

256
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:04,150
the Blair witch story begins like

257
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:08,478
all other witch stories with an
old haggard lady

258
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:11,513
and in this particular case
she was a catholic

259
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:15,602
living in a predominantly
protestant community

260
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:19,070
the story goes that she had
bled a few children

261
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:21,178
and by the pinpricks

262
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,351
probably cuz of some sort of
illness that she detected

263
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,508
or something to that effect

264
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:30,403
the children went back and
reported it to their parents

265
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:34,257
this is, of course at that time
an early sign of witchcraft

266
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:38,619
she was tried summarily
convicted and banished

267
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,971
the winter she was banished
was supposedly the worst ever

268
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,998
and no one knows what happened to her

269
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,739
she was left by herself out in the woods

270
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,419
what they did was they blindfolded her

271
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,288
took her out into the woods

272
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:53,834
and this was in the middle of the winter

273
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:56,863
tied her to a tree and left her

274
00:16:56,864 --> 00:17:00,155
where she soon succumbed to the elements

275
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:04,411
the following year the young
lady who was her first accuser

276
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,600
and most of the other children
who were her accusers

277
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:09,348
and children of the village

278
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,938
vanished throughout the
course of the winter

279
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,262
by the end of the winter over half
the town's children has disappeared

280
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:20,323
immediately the townspeople
blame these disappearances

281
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:22,338
on Elly the witch

282
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,438
the people simply vacated
the area.. They left

283
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,312
they abandoned the community

284
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,841
and they never spoke about
the incident again

285
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,387
as he related to me

286
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:37,050
he had lived in a small town
40 Miles to the north

287
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:39,419
the place had been abandoned he told me

288
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,610
as it had come under a curse

289
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:46,259
the well-built homes that still
stood there were boarded up and empty

290
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,921
with no sign as to why their denizens
had chosen to leave so abruptly

291
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:55,163
this man had heard that the town
had been cursed by a witch

292
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:59,372
and he claimed he had seen a cemetery
full of the gravestones of children

293
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:03,381
but whether that is true or not
I could not say

294
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,261
in 1809, a rare book about the occurrences

295
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:10,409
surrounding the Blair witch
legend was discovered

296
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,326
entitle the Blair witch cult

297
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,873
this Tome is supposedly a collection

298
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:18,947
of firsthand accounts
that illustrate the effects

299
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:21,049
of the infamous Blair witch

300
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,876
and the book is filled with bloodletting

301
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:29,544
all kinds of bloody Gore
witchcraft, paganism

302
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:33,187
basically it's a pack of lies
don't believe any of it

303
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:36,673
but the people of the time
did believe in it

304
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:40,358
the awful hag wrenched the boy's
head from his writhing body

305
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,435
and defiled the church with his warm blood

306
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:48,689
it was then that I noticed a dog's
teat had sprouted from her leg

307
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,943
she controlled the animals in the
forest even the trees

308
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:54,346
seeming to do her bidding

309
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:58,320
when she walked she didn't touch the ground

310
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:00,847
and her followers made a horrible mulch

311
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,240
of the countless dead littering the streets

312
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:09,366
the Blair witch cult by anonymous, 1809

313
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,856
it was about the Blair witch
and it was pretty true

314
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:15,007
pretty factual book about what
really happened here

315
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:17,748
but the Maryland historical
society wanted it back

316
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:21,285
and they took it over almost
over.. My dead body

317
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:25,144
but I couldn't keep it cuz
it did belong to them

318
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:28,577
thirty-eight years later
a chance encounter

319
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:32,250
resurrected the abandoned township of Blair

320
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,552
they were building a railroad through here

321
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:35,822
and the gentleman building the railroad

322
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:37,979
was out ridin' his horse and got lost

323
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,631
stumbled up on an old road

324
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:43,572
and it led into what was Blair at the time

325
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:46,613
he had a friend named burkitt

326
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:49,330
and Mr. burkitt was a
developer

327
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:52,993
and he talked him into coming
here and developin' this area

328
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:55,143
and he named it burkittsville

329
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:58,598
the town was actually formed about 1824

330
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,981
and right about a year after that

331
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,222
the crops had come in

332
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:05,757
wheat was mostly what the
farmers grew there

333
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:11,591
and the crops were in and they decided
to have a picnic down on the local creek

334
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:15,507
tappy east creek has been
possessed by a demon

335
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:18,253
since ilene's horrible death
a fortnight passed

336
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:23,849
the creek has been polluted by a
foul oil and an abundance of strange totem

337
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,838
Mary Johnson, 1825.

338
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,933
There was an incident that occurred

339
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:39,987
involving a young child bt the
name of ilene treakle

340
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,317
this little girl was playing in a very
shallow stream of water

341
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:45,360
and she drowned

342
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:51,723
that creek was real shallow

343
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:54,193
it was only probably six to
eight inches deep

344
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:57,023
a child could just wade across
or crawl across there

345
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:58,944
really it was so shallow

346
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:00,790
well supposedly according to the story

347
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,698
there was 12 witnesses who observed

348
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:07,430
a ghostly white hand

349
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:10,276
come up out of the water and
drag the child under the water

350
00:21:10,277 --> 00:21:13,533
that's all they could see.
Nobody ever saw a face or body

351
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:16,633
all they remember seeing was
the arm and the hand

352
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:18,010
and before they could get to her

353
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,643
she had went and pulled her down

354
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:22,625
she went under the rocks and the mud

355
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:25,447
and everything was calm again

356
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:28,201
but I have a problem with this story

357
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:33,013
how is it that 11 people happend
to be in the right place

358
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:37,601
at the same time to simultaneously
see this chostly hand come up

359
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:40,271
and drag this child under the water?

360
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:41,852
The river is searched

361
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:44,060
now unfortunately you're talking
about knee-deep water

362
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:46,102
it's only two or three feet at the maximum

363
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:49,717
her body should have easily been
found. It's never found

364
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:52,041
I think that in the case

365
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:56,278
of the ilene treakle story

366
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,219
is that there's another explanation

367
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,987
that perhaps it was something
like parental neglect

368
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,351
someone wasn't watching the child
amd the child drowned

369
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:09,136
for the first time in recorded history

370
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:11,954
a death is blamed on the Blair witch

371
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,575
the news of it spreads as far as Baltimore

372
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:16,878
sparking this reaction

373
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:20,168
dear sir: I find myself force to
write this letter

374
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:24,504
upon the atrocity I found within
your pages this Sunday past

375
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:29,128
I've never seen such callousness
shown towards the death of ayoung child

376
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:33,954
especially one who taken from this
world in such a terrible manner

377
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:36,832
as to your humorous view of
the beliefs of the parents

378
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,020
that she was murdered by a ghost

379
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:42,545
I remind you that there have been
many reports of such terrible specters

380
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:45,215
witnessed in the nearby townships

381
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:49,128
whether or not these wild tales
are true is incidental

382
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:52,894
the fact remains that a young girl
has tragically drowned

383
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:54,871
and her memory should not be tarnished

384
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:57,719
by such wild and torrid speculation

385
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,907
over the manner of her death

386
00:22:59,908 --> 00:23:02,917
sincerly, Eugene robertson

387
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:07,021
the river according to what we've
been told through written records

388
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:09,627
then turns oily and has a bunch
of stick figures

389
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:12,370
floating into it for the next week

390
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:15,741
no one can use the river for any kind
of water for food or drinking

391
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:18,412
or anything like that.
It's totally unusable

392
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:20,690
after that the people wouldn't even go
near the creek

393
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,639
they wouldn't fish in it

394
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,292
they didn't swim in it. They didn't
do anything in it.

395
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:26,304
Cuz it just scared them completely to death

396
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,446
and they blamed that on the Blair witch

397
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:35,419
may, 15, 1829: Delivered twin
calves this morning

398
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,933
I'm moving the entire herd
to the fallow pasture

399
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:41,506
cuz three cattle died from
drinking creek water

400
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,849
I'm using the pond instead

401
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,263
Lloyd wellens farming journal

402
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:53,775
and the town again kind of
returned to normal

403
00:23:53,776 --> 00:23:56,601
one more time

404
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,339
they went into the woods
prepared to find death

405
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,333
what they found was a
desecration of humanity

406
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:11,835
at the site which trappers have
referred to as 'coffin rock'

407
00:24:11,836 --> 00:24:14,035
on top of the rock formation

408
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,716
there was a lady lived there in
town when I was a boy

409
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:23,989
she was 50 years old when I knew her

410
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,026
and she told me when she was a little girl

411
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:29,578
she had been walking in the woods one day

412
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:31,634
and this lady appeared to her

413
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:35,454
and she wasn't walking, she was
floating in the air, really

414
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:39,551
and took her by the hand and led
her to an old house back in the woods

415
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:41,498
and took her down in the basement

416
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:44,234
and left her there and said she'd ba back

417
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:45,440
and she left

418
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,463
and the little girl sat there she
said, for several hours

419
00:24:48,464 --> 00:24:50,074
and finally she got scared

420
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:52,792
she was able to crawl through a window

421
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:54,625
and ran back to town

422
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,453
but in the meantime

423
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,248
the town had started to search for her

424
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:01,014
they sent out a search party
to look for her in the woods

425
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:04,169
but it's plausible here that
this little girl

426
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,876
was only telling a story

427
00:25:06,877 --> 00:25:10,112
of the Blair witch as she had
heard it from, maybe,

428
00:25:10,113 --> 00:25:13,761
her parents, her siblings or her friends

429
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:17,551
but what is strange about this case

430
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:20,408
was that the first search party
that had gone out

431
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:23,003
to look for the little girl had vanished

432
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:27,087
when the entire search party
failed to return

433
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:31,477
another search party was
dispatched to find them

434
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:35,265
what they found was a massacre

435
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:38,837
and that search party come up
on coffin hill or coffin rock

436
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,908
and found those men

437
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:43,983
the first search party had been killed

438
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:46,546
laid out on a flat rock in the woods

439
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,445
they had been disemboweled

440
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,446
and on their faces hands and feet

441
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:56,183
were carved these strange pagan symbols

442
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:59,120
and they were heavily cut in by the ropes

443
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,344
so they were alive when they were tied up

444
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:04,994
and somebody had disemboweled
every one of them

445
00:26:04,995 --> 00:26:07,436
and cut some letters and stuff
in their foreheads

446
00:26:07,437 --> 00:26:11,386
very good.. It wasn't crude
you could read what was there

447
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:14,368
it was all symbolic-type
stuff

448
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:16,591
and it scared them very bad

449
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:18,873
like most it would anybody

450
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:20,942
I couldn't have stood there very long

451
00:26:20,943 --> 00:26:26,380
their bodies were in a severe
state of decomposition

452
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:30,023
so the search party goes back to get help

453
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:31,741
and when they return

454
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:34,785
the bodies have vanished without a trace

455
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:37,884
but they could still smell death in the air

456
00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:40,598
which where men die or women die

457
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,715
that you can always smell that

458
00:26:43,716 --> 00:26:46,746
and there was no sign of them there

459
00:26:46,747 --> 00:26:50,514
now, you notice there has been an interval

460
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:53,678
of about 60 years in between these events

461
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,661
and if we move forward to 1940

462
00:26:57,662 --> 00:26:59,607
which is about 60 years

463
00:26:59,608 --> 00:27:03,321
we find another interesting situation

464
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:06,185
happens in this very same area

465
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:10,152
there are an unusually high
number of children laid to rest here

466
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:13,089
most of whom passed in the 1940s

467
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,881
yet no one in the town seens to
recall anything unusual about this time

468
00:27:17,882 --> 00:27:19,478
to us anyway

469
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:22,090
yet legend tells a different story

470
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,817
one whose evidence is all around us

471
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:26,934
etched in stone

472
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:51,666
subtitle by: Farhad 767
linkinpark_767_bonjovi@yahoo. Com

473
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:49,738
- as I rememver Mr. parr was an old hermit.
- Right

474
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:53,440
and he lived up on the Mountain
he had a place up there

475
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:54,990
it'd been there a long, long time

476
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:59,833
sort of in the winter, I guess
the fall or the winter 1940

477
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,802
some of the young kids started to disappear

478
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:07,362
nobody knew anything about
why they were disappearing

479
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:10,934
finally one day old Mr. parr
come down into the market

480
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:12,930
and said: I'm finally
finished

481
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,188
and what did he mean by that?

482
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:16,301
Well I guess nobody knew at first

483
00:29:16,302 --> 00:29:20,419
but the police finally went up
on the Mountain

484
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,522
and they search his house

485
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:25,436
and they found the bodies
of 7 kids from the area

486
00:29:25,437 --> 00:29:27,556
and those were the seven kids
that were missing

487
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,439
and then they brought them out of the woods

488
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,727
one at a time. It just was a
terrible thing

489
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:34,630
it just tore the community up

490
00:29:34,631 --> 00:29:36,467
each of them had again been disemboweled

491
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:40,579
there was again reported strange
markings of carvings on their hands

492
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,452
on their foreheads ritualistic
carvings, if you well

493
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:48,432
well, rustin parr admitted to this crime

494
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:51,172
and in the court he said that

495
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:54,696
the reason he killed the children
is that he was doing

496
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:59,110
what this old lady ghost had told him to do

497
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:03,025
now it's possible that this man

498
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:05,799
was trying to fit himself

499
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,008
into the mythos of the Blair witch

500
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:12,107
but that's conjecture

501
00:30:12,108 --> 00:30:15,279
one child, Kyle Brody

502
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,945
would escape from parr's clutches

503
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:22,597
he was able to give testimony
and it was his words

504
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:26,371
that decided the fate of the
burkittsville killer

505
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:27,372
order order

506
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:31,746
and ladies and gentlemen
I once again quote Kyle Brody

507
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,842
he told me to stand in the
corner and face the wall

508
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:38,026
I could hear Emily screaming
he was cutting her

509
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:41,808
I looked. He was cutting a
symbol on her face

510
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:44,969
sometimes he would come up
to me do you hear her?

511
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,067
Do you hear the woman's voice?
I would cry

512
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:52,539
after a few days, he killed her
he cut her open

513
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,019
and after he took everything out
of her, he left with her

514
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,885
and I never saw her again

515
00:30:57,886 --> 00:31:00,728
when he came back he told me not to be sad

516
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:04,840
that he'd bring someone else back soon

517
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,693
they burned rustin parr's house
to the ground that night

518
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:13,795
he was hanged four months later

519
00:31:13,796 --> 00:31:17,914
on November 22, 1941

520
00:31:19,674 --> 00:31:24,409
I had a tape one time of a
TV .. Of a newsreel

521
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,237
showing him where he was murdered

522
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:30,336
he was killed for murdering
those seven boys

523
00:31:30,337 --> 00:31:33,387
why did you do it Mr. parr?

524
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,774
- I hear voices in my head.
- What kind of voices?

525
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:41,955
- A woman's.
- Whose voice, Mr. parr?

526
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:48,101
- No idea who it was.
- Was it Satan? Was it Blair witch?

527
00:31:48,102 --> 00:31:51,841
- Could've been.
- How did you kill the children Mr. parr?

528
00:31:51,842 --> 00:31:55,550
- With knives.
- Were you alone in the killing?

529
00:31:55,551 --> 00:31:59,731
- Yes how did you get the
children into the woods?

530
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:02,568
- Promised them things.
- What kind of things?

531
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:04,601
- Candy

532
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:06,632
- did you kill other children
that we don't know about?

533
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,269
- No.
- Over here Mr. parr.

534
00:32:10,286 --> 00:32:13,892
Mr. parr why those seven
children?

535
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:16,069
That's what the voices told me

536
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:21,452
the writings on the wall in your
house what do they mean?

537
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:25,798
What were the writings on the
wall, Mr. parr

538
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,696
- did you write those? Did
you write on the walls? - No

539
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:32,949
who wrote on the
walls Mr. parr

540
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,647
you've been sentenced to death
do you feel this is fair?

541
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:37,247
Yes.

542
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,309
Mr. parr do you think God
has forgiven you?

543
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,310
Yes

544
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,180
have you asked the priest for absolution?

545
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:46,955
Yes

546
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:50,116
members of your family been to see you?

547
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:51,117
No.

548
00:32:51,118 --> 00:32:53,160
Mr. parr Mr. parr

549
00:33:15,114 --> 00:33:16,882
- what?
- Nothing I don't know why

550
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:18,502
you have to have very conversation on video

551
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:20,400
- tape some ambience.
- We're making a documentary

552
00:33:20,401 --> 00:33:21,667
not about us getting lost

553
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:24,399
we're making a documentary about a witch

554
00:33:25,094 --> 00:33:26,705
I have a camera

555
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:33,397
doesn't hurt cuz we'll look back
on this and laugh heartly. Believe me

556
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,161
so we're working over there
and all of a sudden

557
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:04,686
I hear kind of a commotion from
the other side of the foundation

558
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:07,821
and I hear, like, rocks banging together

559
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:10,788
and we kind of ran around the side
and apparently what happened

560
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:13,252
was that Pete was removing a stone

561
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:15,078
and a section of the wall just caved in

562
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,904
nobody was hurt this was only

563
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:21,805
this section of the wall by this was
only about four or five feet off the ground

564
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:24,407
and so I checked and nobody was injured

565
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:26,862
and I told them clear this out a little bit

566
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:29,592
and about 20 minutes later
Pete comes running up

567
00:34:29,593 --> 00:34:34,784
and he's got this dirty old like
a backpack in his hand

568
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:37,995
by the way they had located those

569
00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:40,132
it appeared the stones had been there

570
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:45,136
for many many years and had
not been disturbed

571
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:50,389
so it makes you wonser how
someone had removed those stones

572
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:54,049
forensically in other words stone by stone

573
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,105
carefully not disturbing them

574
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:58,963
and then putting them back
in the same exact order

575
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:02,322
that they were originally in the ground

576
00:35:02,323 --> 00:35:06,887
make you wonder why
they were hiding them there

577
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,872
certaintly not for someone to find them

578
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:13,204
cuz they would stay there for
years and years more

579
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:16,871
if they hadn't have done
that anthropology dig

580
00:35:16,872 --> 00:35:21,149
what I recognized real quickly were
a couple of 16-millimeter film cans

581
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:25,989
and there was also what looked like some
videotape cartridges in there

582
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,358
this had nothing at all to do

583
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,886
with colonial period stuff of course

584
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:33,870
and so, I called the sheriff

585
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:36,881
footage was found allegedly

586
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:40,166
that was filmed by the three students

587
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,818
I contacted the local color lab

588
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:46,258
we got it developed and I reviewed the film

589
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:49,536
and all I found was the students themselves

590
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:53,445
some scary noises in the woods at night

591
00:35:53,446 --> 00:35:55,611
and a few examples of that

592
00:35:55,612 --> 00:36:00,979
but no concrete evidence
on what happened to the students

593
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:06,665
listen

594
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,124
hello?

595
00:36:10,185 --> 00:36:11,954
Hello?

596
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:21,694
It's all around us

597
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:25,383
this backpack was found

598
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:28,090
in sterile soil

599
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:29,676
which is like the bottom of the site

600
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:33,968
it's just you know from there to
the middle of the earth is just dirt

601
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:36,670
the original house at the site
had burned down

602
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:39,436
and so there was a layer of ash
that was like sitting

603
00:36:39,437 --> 00:36:41,756
in the interior of the house
like the basement

604
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:45,634
so this knapsack had been in sterile soil

605
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:48,656
with no evidence around it of disturbance

606
00:36:48,657 --> 00:36:52,166
over the top of it was an
undisturbed layer of ash

607
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:54,743
and the whole thing was boxed in by

608
00:36:54,744 --> 00:37:00,713
basically a colonial-era wall
that was undisturbed

609
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:06,441
it was even a forensic expert

610
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:09,060
could not have put that thing
into the site without disturbing

611
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:13,498
the charcoal, the wall or the sterile soil

612
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:15,813
it was as if it materialized

613
00:37:15,814 --> 00:37:17,705
and of course that not the
language of science

614
00:37:17,706 --> 00:37:21,551
so I can't I just don't know
what to say about this, really

615
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:25,152
at the time that the footage
was found it was scary

616
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:27,143
it was very very eerie

617
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:31,627
and it's not something that I'd
really want to look at

618
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:35,792
to tell you the truth
I've kind of avoided it

619
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:39,035
I really don't feel too comfortable

620
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:43,018
with seeing the last few days
of my brother's life on video

621
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:48,221
I really just don't feel too
comfortable with that it's very eerie

622
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:49,805
well, when they found

623
00:37:49,806 --> 00:37:53,564
this videotape or film or recordings
of whatever it was

624
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:58,230
immediately the Blair witch
business emerged

625
00:37:58,231 --> 00:37:59,720
and people became superstitous

626
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:03,036
and they said, well mabe this is
connected to the Blair witch

627
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:06,195
well, I though it was kind of fishy myself

628
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:09,032
I looked at th whole thing as

629
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,936
possibly a hoax or whatever

630
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:13,385
but it was still strange

631
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:17,652
after reviewing the film I still
thought it was a hoax

632
00:38:17,653 --> 00:38:21,009
well, there's always that
possibility, but, uh

633
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,606
I think I mentioned earlier

634
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:26,335
I think it would be remote that it's a hoax

635
00:38:26,336 --> 00:38:29,745
cuz of the way the tapes were hidden, and

636
00:38:30,954 --> 00:38:32,439
the fact that it

637
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,340
just to view the tapes they
are very realistic

638
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:39,138
and they do the tape is from a
time period the students

639
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:42,508
would have been able to have taped it

640
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:45,283
oh God God

641
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:50,597
- hurry up.
- I'm coming

642
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:52,601
my boots aren't laced

643
00:38:52,602 --> 00:38:55,398
oh my God what the fuck is that?

644
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,853
What the fuck is that?

645
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,703
The case of the black hills disappearances

646
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:07,986
has once again been closed

647
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:12,894
the investigation was reopened last
October after film reels and videocassettes

648
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:16,161
supposedly belonging to the three
missing film students

649
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:19,617
were found by a Maryland university
anthropology class

650
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:22,105
Frederick county police officials
declared today that

651
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:24,279
the found footage was inconclusive

652
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,944
and that all possible leads on the
case have been exhausted

653
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:31,237
Heather donahu, Joshua Leonard
and Michael Williams

654
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:35,559
disappeared in 1994 while shooting
a documentary film project

655
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,332
in the black hills area near burkittsville

656
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,397
the three student filmmakers
are still missing

657
00:39:42,398 --> 00:39:45,644
burkittsville has only got
myself and one deputy

658
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:47,567
we did the best we could

659
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:51,319
we called in the county authorities early

660
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,043
and we contacted the FBI later

661
00:39:54,044 --> 00:39:57,238
for more in-depth searching

662
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:00,055
and I hate to publicly criticize

663
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:02,035
someone in law enforcement

664
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:04,881
I was in law enforcement for 32 years

665
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:07,559
I just saw that there were thing, maybe

666
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,918
that could have been done that weren't done

667
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:11,685
I did a very good job

668
00:40:11,686 --> 00:40:14,551
well, it seems like that the

669
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:20,399
this something happens about
every 50 or 60 years

670
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,353
to make the Blair witch theory continue on

671
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:28,276
and I think that's probably what
the cameramen are doin'

672
00:40:28,277 --> 00:40:30,935
they were hopin' to carry it on in
some way and maybe they did

673
00:40:30,936 --> 00:40:33,577
they may have disappeared
who knows for sure?

674
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:36,158
But it's just strange that

675
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,545
it always happens almost
in a 50-year pattern

676
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:43,319
that she somehow surfaces

677
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,160
or something surfaces that lead to her

678
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:50,671
I think they knew the legend but
I don't think they knew the whole history

679
00:40:50,672 --> 00:40:52,636
I don't think they felt

680
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:55,603
any fear

681
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:57,825
but I don't think they felt
any kind of respect

682
00:40:57,826 --> 00:41:00,957
I think to them it was just another project

683
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,954
it was a way to get a grade

684
00:41:02,955 --> 00:41:06,250
and, uh, I think they met her

685
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:08,831
and I think she met them when
she was ready to

686
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:10,860
and I think they're gone

687
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:14,081
I am so, so sorry

688
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,390
for everything that has happened

689
00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:25,104
because, in spite of what Mike
says now, it is my fault

690
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:27,890
because it was my project

691
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:31,677
everything had to be my way

692
00:41:31,678 --> 00:41:34,633
and this is where we've ended up

693
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:38,854
and it's all cuz of me that we're here now

694
00:41:38,855 --> 00:41:42,132
hungry and cold

695
00:41:43,938 --> 00:41:46,195
and hunted

696
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,162
I think it's unexplained

697
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:57,231
I think it remains unexplained
what happened to them

698
00:41:57,232 --> 00:42:02,061
in my law enforcement career I've seen
people that have actually decided to

699
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:03,754
disappear on their own

700
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,394
and reestablish a new identity

701
00:42:05,395 --> 00:42:08,141
there was no reason in this case to do that

702
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:11,376
and there's no indication that they did

703
00:42:11,377 --> 00:42:15,159
there's never been any evidence found

704
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,236
to show that they're

705
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:19,827
that they fell upon foul play

706
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,970
that they're no longer living

707
00:42:24,347 --> 00:42:26,534
so it's something in between

708
00:42:26,535 --> 00:42:32,807
or certainly, in the very least
something very suspicious

709
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:44,214
