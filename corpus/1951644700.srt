1
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,115
You know what they say? The minute they
look at you, bingo, they can read your mind.

2
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,033
- You fall for that stuff?
- I'm telling you!

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,159
So this is where you've
been hiding. Everybody's upstairs.

4
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,869
Anyway, so, as I was telling you,
I met this psychic...

5
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,389
Well, if it isn't my favorite
sister and brother act.

6
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,235
- Glad you could make it.
- So am I.

7
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,039
You know me. Regular party animal.

8
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,038
So is Dad here yet?

9
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,476
When I left the office
he said he'd be here in 20 minutes.

10
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,838
- That was two hours ago.
- He can spend an entire holiday in the lab.

11
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,273
Yeah.

12
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,156
Uh... I guess I'm off to mingle.

13
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,875
Come here, I got something for you.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,956
Oh, wait, wait.

15
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,190
Merry Christmas.

16
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,633
Alex.

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,752
It's beautiful.

18
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,633
- Put it on.
- Help me.

19
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,357
- I bet you believe in Santa too.
- Give me a break.

20
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,910
No, but it's true. This cousin of mine,

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,630
he knows a guy that was scanned by one
of them at a convention in Des Moines.

22
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,757
- You guys are talking scanners?
- We're talking science fiction.

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,752
Oh, yeah? Hey, Alex!

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,759
- What's up, buddy?
- These guys don't believe in scanners.

25
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,796
Oh, yeah? Well, they're right.

26
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,835
Don't mind Santa,
he gets a little crazy this time of year.

27
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,514
Alex, make believers out of these guys.

28
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,512
Come on, give me a break,
it's Christmas Eve.

29
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,472
Party pooper.

30
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,952
Ooh!

31
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,271
That's it. Come on, now,
give me one of those.

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,636
You know, come on now.
Let's show these guys.

33
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,792
- You're not gonna leave me alone, Taylor.
- Do it.

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,678
- You ready?
- Come on, I'm ready.

35
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,550
All right. Hold on to your beard.

36
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,480
Whoa.

37
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,031
You can do better than that.

38
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,152
Whoa!

39
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,155
Man, this guy's incredible.

40
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,991
Come on.

41
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,715
Like I told you, these guys are fantastic.

42
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,678
No!

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,592
No!

44
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,591
Look, Mommy.

45
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,031
Taylor!

46
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,471
'Even if I was declared not guilty
for what they called an accident,

47
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,516
'I had no choice but to leave.

48
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,154
'I couldn't face my friends, or Joyce.

49
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,835
'And I couldn't face the man that adopted
me and my friend Helena,

50
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,629
'taking us out of that horrible
scanners institution.

51
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,512
'I had to find a way to master my powers.

52
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,912
'I went around the world

53
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,798
'and finally found a place,

54
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,836
'a monastery in Thailand.'

55
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,276
I can't believe you talked
a Polish girl into lingerie.

56
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,636
- I thought it was just for hookers.
- Come on, Helena.

57
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,872
It's the '90s. We're women, we're strong,
and we can do whatever we want.

58
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,916
Where am I supposed to wear it?

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,956
Under your clothes.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,594
To work, anywhere you feel like it.

61
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,150
Just imagine you and your new boss,
the takeover king.

62
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,633
Mark Dragon. Maybe you two could hit it off -
takeover king meets makeover queen.

63
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,995
Sounds like a match made in heaven.

64
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,913
Unfortunately, I'm not interested.

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,310
I know it sounds crazy.
It's been almost two years

66
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,597
but even after all this time
I'm still hung up on Alex.

67
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,198
Helena, are you all right?

68
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,034
No, not again...
These damn migraines.

69
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,272
Any time I get in a crowd
or any pressure situation, I get paralyzed.

70
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,352
No wonder I can't hold a job.
How am I supposed to?

71
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,557
Let's get you home.
I know a short cut back to the car.

72
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,029
This is what always happens
when I forget my pills.

73
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,839
Shouldn't you take them every day?

74
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,232
Yes, but they make me stupid like
a sleepwalker. Almost anything is better.

75
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,158
Let's get out of here.

76
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,993
Well, well, well, what have we got here?

77
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,038
Two uptown babes walking down my street.

78
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,193
Whatever you're doing
is none of our business so just let us go.

79
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,352
Didn't you know
it was dangerous in this part of town?

80
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,512
You don't want to do this,
you'll just get into trouble.

81
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,752
Thanks for the warning.
But we're not the ones in trouble - you are.

82
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,395
Run, Helena!

83
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,358
OK, suck on this.

84
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,235
I think we'd better get out of here.

85
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,954
I haven't scanned anyone
since I was 12 years old.

86
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,554
It was pretty amazing.

87
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,234
I just didn't know I had it in me.

88
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,871
- I knew Alex could do that, but you?
- Just don't tell Father. Please.

89
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,679
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

90
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,753
Thanks.

91
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,312
Helena.

92
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,958
Helena?

93
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,510
Darling, are you all right?

94
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,556
I have a headache, Dad.

95
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,039
Oh.

96
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,916
So you were with Joyce.

97
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,112
I just saw her leaving. Hardly recognized her
without her lab coat and clipboard.

98
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,349
Here.

99
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,476
Take one of these, try to relax.

100
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,675
You know I hate those pills.

101
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,638
Well...

102
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,398
I don't want to get your hopes up but...

103
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,789
I have something.

104
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,839
Something which could change your life,
and every other scanner.

105
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,353
That, my darling, is EPH-3,

106
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,431
a new delivery system.

107
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,193
Electronically charged skin patches.

108
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,239
You wear it behind the ear and the drug is
absorbed into the bloodstream.

109
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,311
One patch should last 24 hours.

110
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,188
And you think it'll stop the pain?
And the voices?

111
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,478
I certainly hope so. We've done everything
possible to purify the compound.

112
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,431
When can I try it?

113
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,238
As soon as I've finished testing.

114
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,279
I hope it's soon cos I can't stand those pills
any longer.

115
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,318
They stop the pain, but everything else too.

116
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,631
We don't know,
if any, what the side effects are.

117
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,796
As you know, there's no such thing
as scanner lab rats.

118
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,751
Let me work with you on it. I understand
the problem better than anyone.

119
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,229
I can be your personal control group.

120
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,912
Helena.

121
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,676
We've been through this before.

122
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,116
Who are you going to test it on?

123
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,318
I've found two terminally ill scanners
who will volunteer.

124
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,356
They're at Baumann Clinic.

125
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,789
You're working with Dr. Baumann again?

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,230
That pervert.

127
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,471
It's the only clinic for scanners in the region.

128
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,515
I don't want anything to do with EPH-3
if that sadist is going to be involved.

129
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,556
Helena, be reasonable.

130
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,277
I'm sorry, Dad, I just have
so much work to do.

131
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,955
- I'm meeting tomorrow with ASN.
- I know. Get some rest.

132
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,474
Go on. You can catch up in the morning.

133
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,549
Stop!

134
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,949
No, stop, please!

135
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,353
The subject demonstrated pain responses
which require further examination.

136
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,671
Quiet, Helena! It doesn't hurt that much!

137
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,876
No, please don't!

138
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,830
Oww! Stop, please.

139
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,514
No, no, no...

140
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,756
No...

141
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,477
'No, stop!'

142
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,391
Eurgh...

143
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,672
Oh, you stupid creature.

144
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,229
- Well, if it isn't my gorgeous goddaughter.
- Well, if it isn't our expensive attorney.

145
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,199
- How do you feel this morning, Helena?
- Like pure electricity.

146
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,236
Well, that's a change.

147
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,311
Yes, it certainly is.

148
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,279
So I hear you're taking the world by storm
with Mark Dragon.

149
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,669
- They haven't seen anything yet.
- Oh.

150
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,354
Aren't we the confident one these days?

151
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,712
Thanks to Daddy dear.

152
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,237
Have a good day!

153
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,636
What's with her?

154
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,076
I'm not sure. She's been a little...

155
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,674
- flighty lately.
- I see.

156
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,628
So why don't you bring her
into the business?

157
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,756
I'm not convinced she's ready.

158
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,034
Oh, you're right.

159
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,998
It's Alex. I just feel he should have
something to come home to.

160
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,070
I guess when you adopt children
you always are afraid

161
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,958
that your hold on them is a little tenuous.

162
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,237
Elton... you've adopted them both.

163
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,311
I mean, they're both your children

164
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,871
and I think it's time that you faced the fact
that Alex might not be coming back.

165
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,799
So give her a chance.
It could make things easier for both of you.

166
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,836
I've lost Alex, Michael.

167
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,196
I don't want to lose her too.

168
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,713
ASN Broadcasting.

169
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,954
54 TV stations.
Satellite pickup in 15 countries.

170
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,710
Well... here's to
the new kid on the block, Helena.

171
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,836
I'm very flattered, Mr. Dragon.

172
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,797
I didn't know if you realized how much work
I put into the ASN deal.

173
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,273
Not you - me, Mark Dragon.

174
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,555
Takeover king. Your boss.

175
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,590
Oh, come on, Helena. People expect
my employees to do the courting.

176
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,875
And you do it very well.

177
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,756
But when it comes to the wedding,
they want me as the groom.

178
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,400
I am always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

179
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,118
It takes time, sweetie.

180
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,678
But if you play your cards right, you'll be fine.

181
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,752
And... what exactly am I doing here,
Mr. Dragon?

182
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,029
You're, um, window dressing.
Know what I mean?

183
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,915
Look who's here.

184
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,470
Mr. First World Bank himself.

185
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,879
You wanna be the big cheese one day?
Watch a master at work.

186
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,031
Mr. Crandall. What a surprise.

187
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,792
Ah.

188
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,518
Mark Dragon.

189
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,112
- Mr. Dudswell and Mr. Bentley.
- Won't you join us?

190
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,909
- No, I'd hate to bust up your evening.
- Oh, not at all.

191
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,956
- We're just celebrating.
- Oh?

192
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,158
- Are you about to make an announcement?
- Yes. But not the kind you mean.

193
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,391
It's business. A little thing
called ASN Broadcasting.

194
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,835
- I just bought it.
- Oh, really?

195
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,956
How do you plan to finance this?

196
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,271
That's exactly what I wanted
to talk to you about.

197
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,035
Helena Monet, VP finance,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

198
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,839
Always a pleasure to meet a beautiful lady.

199
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,109
Where was I? Erm... Listen, honey,

200
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,430
go get us some more champagne, babe.

201
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,876
And one more thing, I...

202
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,638
gotta dance!

203
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,111
Look at that guy!

204
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,831
Don't take it personal.
You just fucked with the wrong person.

205
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,199
See ya.

206
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,070
Dr. Baumann.

207
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,718
No one's allowed in here.

208
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,351
Oh, don't worry, Doctor, I'll just take
a moment of your precious time.

209
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,670
Who are you? What do you want?

210
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,598
I guess for you I'm just a distant memory.

211
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,636
But where are your awards?

212
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,077
All those experiments and no recognition
from the psychiatric community.

213
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,718
What a pity.

214
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,115
I thought that your work with that little girl
from Poland was Nobel prize material.

215
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,555
What was her name?

216
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,517
Helena Loey.

217
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,072
That's right.

218
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,958
Dear little Helena.

219
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,634
Dear little Helena, my ass!

220
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,793
You were always a brat. And I can see now
that things haven't changed.

221
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,110
You know it's not polite to point.

222
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,713
Where did you get the idea

223
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,870
- that you could waltz in here...
- I said...

224
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,713
it's not polite to point.

225
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,518
The subject demonstrated pain responses
which could not be verified

226
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,556
without further examination.

227
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,069
- Still a photographer, though, I see.
- I...

228
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,630
I was just trying to help you.
There was no other way.

229
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,271
I guess I should have felt honored
being your favorite lab rat, but I didn't.

230
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,590
I felt like shit!

231
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,478
Now what do you say?

232
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,993
I'm sorry!

233
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,230
No, that's not it.

234
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,077
Look at the camera, Doctor. Come on.

235
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,515
Darn, I hate the way the flash
makes their eyes go red.

236
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,196
Hey, lady. Looking for someone?

237
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,835
Work, work, work.

238
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,196
You're starting to piss me off.

239
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,356
Oh, shit.

240
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,238
That too can be arranged.

241
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,638
Gotta get out of here.

242
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,069
Oh, I hope you're not going to shoot me
with that.

243
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,989
That's better. Now come here.

244
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,193
Yeah, that's it.

245
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,114
Just a little closer so we can
get to know each other better.

246
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,638
Did you ever play doctor
when you were a kid?

247
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,711
Uh-huh.

248
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,870
It was fun, wasn't it?

249
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,996
Do you want to play it now?

250
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,433
OK.

251
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,356
Open your mouth.

252
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,155
And now say, "Aah."

253
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,593
Aaaah!

254
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,392
Next!

255
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,795
You could... You could be...

256
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,595
You could be in big trouble, lady.

257
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,596
It's OK, really.
I worked it all out ahead of time with...

258
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,194
... with Dr. Baumann.

259
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,558
Don't worry, I'm one of you.

260
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,395
An alumni of the hallowed halls
of Baumann Institute.

261
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,711
And guess what. It's graduation day.

262
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,268
You a scanner? Like us?

263
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,951
Not like you, not by a long shot.

264
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,669
You know those skull-crushing headaches
that make you feel like your brain's on fire

265
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,709
and that endless cacophony of voices
that runs on and on and on in your head

266
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,839
until you would gladly claw out
your own eyes with your bare hands

267
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,835
if it will only give you one single second
of blessed silence.

268
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,353
But you know what?

269
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,908
I got it licked. And so can you.

270
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,715
With EPH-3, the latest miracle
of neuropharmacological research.

271
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,030
I had a headache this big

272
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,839
but then I tried EPH-3

273
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,229
and it went away just like that.

274
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,039
So don't delay, get your free samples.

275
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,873
They're free now, while quantities last.

276
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,792
And then maybe, just maybe,

277
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,839
if you're willing to give it your all,
one hundred per cent,

278
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,309
you will not only win your freedom

279
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,155
but the opportunity to stand beside me,
tall and proud,

280
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,435
and say, "We are scanners.

281
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,116
"We do not belong on the bottom
of the dung heap. We belong on the top!"

282
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,598
We're going to go out there

283
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:25,028
and make those self-righteous normals
squirm like worms on hooks.

284
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,519
There will of course be a small price
for the second installment.

285
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,840
Do any of you remember a patient here

286
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,678
from about 15 years ago
named Alex Malone?

287
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,909
I know him!

288
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,916
You wanted to speak with me, Master?

289
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,356
Yes, Alex. I would like to speak with you.

290
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,793
Come.

291
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,072
Now, tell me,

292
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,958
you have been here a long time,

293
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,395
but why do you continue to stay here?

294
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,557
Because I don't belong in the outside world.

295
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,596
You don't belong here either.

296
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,917
This is not the place
for you to hide from yourself.

297
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,834
- Nor from your past.
- I wanted to go back, Master.

298
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,992
I tried everything but I can't find the answer,

299
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,556
a way to live with myself.

300
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,393
You have special powers.

301
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,913
You must choose whether to treat them
as a curse or a gift.

302
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,792
I killed my best friend
with my special power.

303
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,716
Instead of denying them,

304
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,874
you could do good with your powers.

305
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,235
There is a saying -

306
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,912
That means, "If you receive a boat as a gift,

307
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,593
"do not criticize the hull."

308
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,436
Hello?

309
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,953
Who's there?

310
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,709
Helena? What are you doing?

311
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,157
I thought I'd throw a little party
to thank you for your magnificent gift.

312
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,359
You took EPH-3?

313
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,991
And it works wonderfully, Daddy.
You're a genius.

314
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,036
Are you insane?

315
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,916
Take it off, it's dangerous.

316
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,878
But I've never felt so marvelous.

317
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,350
- You've got to give me more.
- That's out of the question.

318
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,795
Why don't you come in and we'll discuss it?

319
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,314
Come out of there this instant!

320
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,512
Remember when you adopted us?

321
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,839
Two poor little orphans that no one wanted.

322
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,152
We were freaks.

323
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,474
You told us you wanted a little boy
to succeed you,

324
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,276
and a little girl of your very own.

325
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,276
But you didn't say what for.

326
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,430
That's why you didn't want me to work.

327
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,719
You wanted me all for yourself.

328
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,358
It's the drug!

329
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,079
- Take it off!
- All that pain,

330
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,116
and all this time...

331
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,589
you've had the answer.

332
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,636
Take it off!

333
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,910
Nothing personal, Daddy,

334
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,551
but with you around,
I'd never get control of your company.

335
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,030
Oh, Michael.

336
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,588
I got here as fast as I could.

337
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,477
What happened?

338
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,036
They say it was a heart attack.

339
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,869
Michael, I just saw him floating out there
and I tried to help him but...

340
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,916
I was too late.

341
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,198
What was he doing in the hot tub
at this hour? He hated that hot tub.

342
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,316
Michael, he's dead.

343
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,436
Mike, Dad's dead.

344
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,716
Of course I'll make
all the arrangements.

345
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,189
At least his will is in order.

346
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,035
As you know, I'm the executor,
so I can go over it with you in detail.

347
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,953
In a few days. There's no rush, don't worry.

348
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,711
And of course I'll have to contact Alex.

349
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,997
He has to make several decisions
about the company.

350
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,672
I don't think he can.

351
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,513
- Father tried to find him for a year.
- Yes.

352
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,112
Perhaps that's why Alex didn't want
to be found, not by his father at least.

353
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,670
- Michael, you...
- Don't get your hopes up. We'll see.

354
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,516
I've gotta make some calls.

355
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,916
And don't worry, please.

356
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,036
I'm taking care of everything.

357
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,232
Alex, hmm...

358
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,792
my dear...

359
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,029
beloved brother.

360
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,198
Your passport is due to expire
in less than a week.

361
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,714
I'm only gonna be here a couple of days.

362
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,597
Sorry, you cannot enter Thailand

363
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,310
without a passport valid for at least
six months after the day that you arrive.

364
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,828
Oh. Of course.

365
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,195
We'll make an exception in your case.

366
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,472
Enjoy your stay, sir.

367
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,398
Thank you.

368
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,639
Welcome to Thailand.

369
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,950
Yeah, right.

370
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,316
My master says...

371
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,356
we must accept death as karma.

372
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,830
But there's a long way
between theory and practice.

373
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,233
I cannot accept Father's death, Michael.

374
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,992
Been hard on all of us. You should
come back, it's been over a year.

375
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,435
No one blames you for what happened.

376
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,552
I never understood. Even if I hadn't...

377
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,791
Even if things hadn't turned out this way,
I still wouldn't have gone back.

378
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,589
Well, he was obsessed with having
an heir to the family business.

379
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,435
- I wish it had been Helena.
- It might be if you don't come back.

380
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,275
Don't get me wrong but there's something
strange about your father's death.

381
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,319
Alex, I didn't come here just to tell you
about your father.

382
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,273
It's Helena.

383
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,316
Something's happened to her.

384
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,356
Yes, I'm certain.
I saw the patch on her neck.

385
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,396
Why would she do that, Mike?

386
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,117
She was never the impulsive type.

387
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,954
She's changed, Alex. Not for the better.

388
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,996
What do you mean?

389
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,270
I can't put my finger on it, but it was as if she
resented the way your father treated her.

390
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,512
Alex!

391
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,955
It's a long way from Baumann's clinic, huh?

392
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,158
My brother Alex is dead.

393
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,075
As you can imagine, the second blow
has affected me deeply.

394
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,234
However, because both my father
and my brother are now gone,

395
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,276
I have, through these tragic accidents,

396
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,148
been left in the position
of being my father's sole heir.

397
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,357
And after a great deal of soul searching,

398
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,590
I have decided to succeed him

399
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,998
as chairman and CEO
of Monet Pharmaceutical.

400
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,869
Well, we... we all share your grief,
Miss Monet.

401
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,471
And I believe that I can safely say

402
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,156
that we appreciate your desire to continue
your father's work.

403
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,829
However, a decision of this nature
must be brought to a vote.

404
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,309
I presume you have a candidate in mind.

405
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,631
Yes. I would like to nominate...

406
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,030
Ugh...

407
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,429
Miss Helena Monet.

408
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,798
My father was a brilliant scientist.

409
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,836
He was a great humanitarian.

410
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,638
But, as many of you no doubt realize,
he was not an aggressive businessman.

411
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,953
He was content to simply maintain
corporate stature of Monet Pharmaceutical.

412
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,837
However...

413
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,229
I am not.

414
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,117
So here is the game plan.

415
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,952
First...

416
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,158
annihilation of MPI's competitors
in the pharmaceutical field. Second...

417
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,119
strategic diversification and expansion
into new areas. Third...

418
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,829
total domination of all new markets
and territories.

419
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,993
Things have changed around here, guys,
and it's gonna be a bumpy ride,

420
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,435
so if you want to bail out, bail out now.

421
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,756
'Alex.'

422
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,398
'I know you are traumatized

423
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,040
'but there is evil in this world

424
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,317
'that not even a stoic can ignore,

425
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,793
'and we must face the conflict
between such evil

426
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,994
'and its opposite, good.

427
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:12,392
'We must have criteria for deciding
what in any situation is good,

428
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,789
'what is evil.

429
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,189
'You will find the fulcrum in your heart.

430
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,790
'Now go deep inside yourself.

431
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,994
'Use the long breath method.'

432
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,875
'Now that you can control your breath,

433
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,474
'you learn to control your heart.'

434
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,277
Hi. How are you?

435
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,918
Fine.

436
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,592
Listen, Joyce, uh...

437
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,636
I have a question.

438
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,279
Before Father's heart attack, he was
working on a new formula, EPH-3.

439
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,794
- You know about it?
- Mm-hm, a little.

440
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,192
- Because I want to go into production.
- Helena, that's impossible.

441
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,114
Your father was making progress
but it was still experimental.

442
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,875
That's OK, Joyce. I tried it myself.

443
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,837
Helena, how could you do that?

444
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,229
Anything could have happened to you.

445
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,834
I know, I know, but it works, Joyce.

446
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,631
It works beautifully. No negative side effects,
just a complete release from pain.

447
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,077
The problem is Dad only left a small supply
and I need more to keep going.

448
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,277
Especially if I'm going to run this company.

449
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,113
I can't do that, I don't have the formula.

450
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,839
Here. You have to do top to bottom analysis

451
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,993
and I want you to put it
into full-scale production immediately.

452
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,516
This is what Dad wanted.

453
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,513
It was his dream to make scanners' lives
bearable, to cure their pain.

454
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,556
We cannot let it be destroyed.

455
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,036
It's gonna take some time.

456
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,393
I'm so glad I have at least one friend here.

457
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,311
Thank you, Joyce.

458
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,676
You wanted to see me, Miss Monet?

459
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,354
- Yes. George, isn't it?
- Yes, Miss Monet.

460
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,192
Have a seat.

461
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,312
- I liked your presentation to the board.
- Thank you.

462
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,437
I want you to be my personal assistant.
Any problems?

463
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,238
- No, I'd be...
- Good.

464
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,949
I want all of the company's financial records,
an earnings report,

465
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,113
a list of our assets, particularly liquid
assets. I want it complete, and...

466
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,156
I want it in an hour. Got that?

467
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,117
Yes, Miss Monet.

468
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,918
One more thing.

469
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,434
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

470
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,192
Ditch her.

471
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,354
You are going to be a very busy boy.

472
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,869
'You must be just so very excited.

473
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,873
'You've got a new rock video,
a new hairdo, I see.

474
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,952
'And, if my researchers haven't
screwed up again,

475
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,712
'a new man in your life.'

476
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,553
- 'Whoa, the new man in my life...'
- 'Tell us.'

477
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,349
Come on, Georgie boy,
use your imagination.

478
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,830
'Well, the video's coming out next week...'

479
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,876
Oh, yes.

480
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,428
That's much better.

481
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,638
'Oh, yes. That's much better.'

482
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,029
You're making me tingle all over.

483
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,194
'You're making me tingle all over.'

484
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,397
I didn't say that, did I?

485
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,271
'Better watch it, we're on live television!'

486
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,069
I need you so bad. I need you now.

487
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,912
'I need you so bad.

488
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,956
'I need you now.'

489
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,550
Let's make it with the naked nasty.

490
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,074
'Ooh, yeah.

491
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,879
'Let's make it with the naked nasty.'

492
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,989
'Please stand by. We are experiencing
technical difficulties.'

493
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,949
I hope you're not experiencing
any technical difficulties, George.

494
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,235
No, no, no, no. Just watch the TV, OK?

495
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,358
It works.

496
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,872
I've got a feeling
we'll be going network on this.

497
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,039
What's happening to the ASN stock?
You're supposed to be in charge of it.

498
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,236
Well, how the hell did it happen?

499
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,957
Well, tell him to stop selling, jerk-off!

500
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,033
I am the goddamn takeover king.
Nobody does this to me.

501
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,476
Find out who the hell's behind it
and find out now.

502
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,478
Jesus!

503
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,710
Helena. Who the hell let you in here?

504
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,236
Is that the way to greet
your favorite girl Friday?

505
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,437
What did you do? Slip a Mickey in my drink?

506
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,671
I actually slipped a Mickey...

507
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,512
into your life.

508
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,869
By the way, how am I doing?

509
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,918
You... You're behind this?

510
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,831
Let me tell you something.

511
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,717
You don't have a hope in hell

512
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,679
because I am gonna rip off your balls
and shove 'em down your throat.

513
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,352
Ooh!

514
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,591
- I don't have any balls, Mark.
- Goddamn right.

515
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,399
But by the look of things I do have ASN.

516
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,712
What was it again, 15 stations
in 54 countries or the other way round?

517
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,155
Over my dead body.

518
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,232
I knew you had a knack for business, Mark,

519
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,038
but wow,

520
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,678
that's brilliant.

521
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,513
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

522
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,272
I mean...

523
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,592
how about a nice, cool dip in the old pool?

524
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,671
What, are you nuts? It's freez...

525
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,992
Now that you mention it...

526
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,279
...um... It's not such a bad idea.

527
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,669
Mark, Mark, Mark, this exhibitionist thing.
I start to worry about you.

528
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,556
Mmm, excellent form, Mark,

529
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,274
I must say, you do have balls.

530
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,310
Now hang on to them.

531
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,356
'Now that I think of it,

532
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,830
'it was 54 stations, 15 countries.'

533
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,753
'Exactly what I need for my next takeover.'

534
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,518
Helena?

535
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,752
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm here to see Helena Monet.

536
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,796
- I'm her brother Alex.
- Just a moment.

537
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,875
Miss Monet's brother is here to see her.

538
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,469
- They'll just be a moment.
- Thank you.

539
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,553
Alex.

540
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,156
You haven't changed.

541
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,271
You heard...

542
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,236
Yeah, I've heard.

543
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,470
- Michael told me.
- Michael?

544
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,476
When did you talk to him?

545
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,112
He's dead.

546
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,872
Oh, my God.

547
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,311
Not Michael.

548
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,272
What happened?

549
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,155
I've been over in Thailand, Helena.

550
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,999
Michael came to tell me about Dad.

551
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,874
He was attacked, no reason.

552
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,236
There was a scanner there
that I think was responsible.

553
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,311
Scanner?

554
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,597
- Something must have set him off.
- It wasn't like that.

555
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,679
It was deliberate, cold-blooded murder.

556
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,156
Why would anyone want to kill Michael?

557
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,837
I was hoping you'd be able to tell me.
I've been in a monastery for two years.

558
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,434
Suddenly Dad's dead, Michael's dead,

559
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,996
and you've taken over here.

560
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,154
And what's with the scan signal

561
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,277
- on the video, Helena?
- Oh, that.

562
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,636
- I was just playing around, Alex.
- Burning cigars?

563
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,516
Michael was concerned,
said you were taking a new drug.

564
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,354
'Miss Monet, your car's downstairs.'

565
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,916
Thank you, George, I'm on my way.

566
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,754
I'm sorry, I have a meeting
with our Japanese affiliates.

567
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,310
Look, er... there is a drug, it's true.

568
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,037
EPH-3.

569
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,475
Dad invented it. It's for scanners.

570
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,555
Completely relieving their pain.

571
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,428
But I don't know what Michael was
talking about. It's a miracle drug.

572
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,715
Ask Joyce if you don't believe me.

573
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,230
Joyce is involved?

574
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:06,359
Yeah, she's up at Baumann. They're doing
wonderful things for scanners.

575
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,396
The place has changed so much.

576
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,914
Go and see for yourself.

577
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,275
I think Joyce would love to see you.

578
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,430
Dr. Baumann is unavailable.

579
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,715
May I take a message?

580
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,439
Uh-huh, yes. Thank you.

581
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,633
I can help you.

582
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,233
Hi.

583
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,392
I'm looking for Joyce Stone.
Tell her it's Alex Monet.

584
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,436
Of course, sir.

585
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,516
If you'll just follow me.

586
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,032
I think you'll find what you're looking for...

587
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,076
right in here.

588
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,789
Ah...

589
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,915
Uh... Miss...

590
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,752
- Suzy.
- Suzy.

591
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,276
Suzy, look, I don't think this is a good idea.

592
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,112
See, I, er...

593
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,876
I live in a monastery.

594
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,599
Well, this'll give you
something to think about

595
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,910
when you lay in bed.

596
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,194
Alone in the dark.

597
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,633
Doing...

598
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,110
whatever it is you do.

599
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,151
- Where's Dr. Stone?
- She's been detained.

600
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,836
But I'm here to take care of your every need.

601
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,393
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.

602
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,392
They're not real.

603
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,798
Well, well, well, well,
well, well, well, well, well.

604
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,598
What do we have here?

605
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,955
Boys, I think we've got us a rapist.

606
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,271
Oh, come on, Mitch, he was willing.

607
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,640
Not you, nimbo-bimbo.

608
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,631
- Him.
- Me?

609
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,110
- Hmm.
- What the hell's going on around here?

610
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,279
- And what?
- Well, let me explain.

611
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,069
This is the breakdown of the analysis
of the EPH-3 prototype.

612
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,596
Paraoxon hydrochloride, cyanocabalamin,
cupric oxide.

613
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,114
- I know that. And so?
- So nothing.

614
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,909
It's inert. You might as well
be taking vitamin pills, Helena.

615
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,991
You must have missed something.

616
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,959
We're running it through again
but I don't think so.

617
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,554
If there's anything I can do to help...

618
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,914
I know. I know.

619
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,073
I'll look through Dad's video tape.
See if I can find something there.

620
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,072
- Wake up now.
- Guard the door.

621
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,516
We're taking a little stroll
down memory lane.

622
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,315
Oh, come on, come on.

623
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,676
A taste of Baumann's laser therapy to
teach a guy to keep his hands off the staff.

624
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,317
Wake up, Romeo.
We wanna show you our new toy.

625
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,790
Quick, get around the back door.

626
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,951
Get in the bus!

627
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,392
Come on, come on,
the creep's getting away.

628
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,953
Faster! Faster!

629
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,996
I think I got him.

630
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,911
Can you swim?

631
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,755
Better safe than sorry. Go check.

632
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,317
Alex?

633
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,633
Jesus.

634
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,836
What's happened to you?

635
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,312
I'm, uh... not sure you're gonna believe it.

636
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,999
I'm still not sure I do.

637
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,993
What is it?

638
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,478
I, uh...

639
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,996
I had to kill a man today.

640
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,836
I just got back this morning.

641
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,872
I wanted to see you
so I went out to Baumann.

642
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,518
Baumann? Why?

643
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,558
Cos Helena told me that you would be there.

644
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,872
But it was a trap.
She sent me out there deliberately.

645
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:45,556
A group of scanners attacked me.
- That's impossible.

646
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,278
She's your sister.

647
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,836
She's my best friend.

648
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,676
She's changed.

649
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,958
Listen.

650
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,593
Can you tell me anything
about this new drug she's taking?

651
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,353
EPH-3? Your dad developed it.

652
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,069
Are you sure there's no side effects
to that drug?

653
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,116
I never saw the test results.

654
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:24,473
Helena said it herself. I believed her when
she told me there were no side effects.

655
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,677
But maybe there are.

656
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,512
The way she's been acting.

657
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,717
I think it's somehow blocked out
her conscience.

658
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,429
And with scanners, Joyce,
that can be a dangerous thing.

659
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,194
It's hard to explain but when a...

660
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,236
when a scanner loses control,

661
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:52,513
there are these forces,
strange feelings inside,

662
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,114
it's... it's almost like a rage.

663
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,597
It just builds and builds and builds

664
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,636
and builds inside you.

665
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,592
Is there, Alex?

666
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,635
Is that what you were afraid of?

667
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,755
Is that why you ran away?

668
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,677
'Exterior application
is necessitated.

669
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,518
'Now I have with me a rough prototype
skin patch which...

670
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,431
'Oh, shit.

01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,355

'... which... Oh, shit.

'Uh, this is continuation of lab report

675
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,313
Daddy... what have I done?

676
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,393
'In order to, uh... isolate...'

677
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,791

Bingo.

683
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,870
'Now I'm going to turn this off.'

684
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,518
- Alex?
- Mm-hm?

685
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,789
I've been thinking about
what you said about Helena.

686
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,910
- Mmm...
- Is that what you've been thinking about?

687
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,956
Seriously!

688
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,308
I'm gonna go down to the office
and see what I can find out.

689
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,718
Mmm...

690
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,116
Are you listening to me?

691
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,720
- No.
- No, I didn't think so.

692
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,233
Hi there.

693
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,434
Go! He's going around the other side!

694
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,950
I hate this bloody city.

695
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,198
I really hate this city.

696
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,870
Interesting reading?

697
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:51,512
It's nice to see my employees in
bright and early snooping through my office.

698
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,556
Speaking of eager beavers,

699
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:59,030
I hear you and Alex had
a very tender evening in.

700
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,910
- Helena, what have you done?
- You're such an innocent, such a prude.

701
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,792
I'll tell you what I've done,
I've come into my own.

702
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:11,714
I've finally gotten the power
I've always deserved.

703
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,593
By the way, while you were
making whoopee,

704
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,150
I was making history.

705
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,230
Yep. I cracked the code, Joyce.

706
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,031
Seems like poor old Dad
just forgot to mention

707
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,315
that the missing element

708
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,834
is only to be found

709
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,876
in bodily secretions...

710
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,151
of the scanners' metabolic type.

711
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,071
Helena...

712
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,832
please, listen to me.

713
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,832
You've got to stop taking the drug.

714
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,629
The psychological side effects
could be devastating.

715
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,950
- You think so?
- Yes.

716
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,156
This isn't you, Helena, you're not normal.

717
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,472
You can say that again.

718
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,516
You're n-not normal.

719
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,397
That's better.

720
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,873
I wanted to get you between the sheets...

721
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,640
but this is ridiculous!

722
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,592
Oh, well.

723
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,356
Easy come, easy go.

724
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,799
Oops!

725
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,791
Good night, sweet prince.

726
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,630
- Who are you?
- I'm, er...

727
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,073
temporary.

728
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,515
Huh. Not too temporary...

729
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,556
I hope.

730
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,672
Uh, say...

731
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,274
after I've finished with my rounds...

732
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,669
I can't wait.

733
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,111
Neither can I.

734
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,758
'Now that you can
control your breath...'

735
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,637
Bye.

736
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:21,113
'... you learn to control your heart.'

737
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,710
Jesus! We've got a code blue! Move it!

738
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,995
Don't just stand there. Prep him!

739
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,557
- Nothing.
- Let's try and jump-start the poor bastard.

740
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,513
- Clear.
- Clear.

741
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,318
Nothing.

742
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,356
- Clear.
- Clear.

743
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:51,030
Ah, there's nothing, Doctor.

744
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,758
Mark the time and take him down
for an autopsy.

745
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,916
Mind if I use your phone?

746
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,549
Is it... is it a-a-a... a local call?

747
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,237
I've got total control over
Worldwide Satellite Network

748
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,550
and EPH-3 in full production.

749
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,518
Now let's go on the air
and take over the world.

750
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,751
Scanners are in control,
thanks to you, Joyce.

751
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,435
- My job was simple.
- By the way, how are you feeling?

752
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,715
I have never felt better, Helena.

753
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,439
That's good, because it's show time.

754
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,155
Come on, Joyce, answer the phone.

755
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,633
'He's fading back long,
and there's the pass.

756
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:21,157
'Oh, look at that!
He's cut down on the 45 yard line.'

757
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,834
Joyce Stone, I need to see her.

758
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,952
Now!

759
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:33,149
- I don't know where she is.
- Where did she take her?

760
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,550
- I don't know.
- 'Enjoy the game, Miss Monet.'

761
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,714
'The Unstoppable Force, this year's
highest points per game average,

762
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,189
'go head to head with Immovable Objects.

763
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:51,032
'And ASN is bringing all of the excitement
and action to an additional 25 countries.

764
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,270
'And now back to you, Jim.'

765
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,511
'Right, Miss Monet.
It's two and ten on the 45

766
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,195
'and there's the snap back... Ohhh!'

767
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:06,594
'And, Jim, I think I can guarantee
that our estimated 75 million viewers

768
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,989
'have a big thrill in store, right?'

769
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,640
'Right, Miss Monet.
Back to the playing field.'

770
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,712
'Third down with ten to go,

771
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,075
'and there's the snap.

772
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,116
'He's fading back for the pass.

773
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,111
'Oh, and he's going for it!

774
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,919
'Up to the 30! He could go all the way!'

775
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,156
'Like I said, Jim.

776
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,071
'A violent game.'

777
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,313
- Hey, man, what's going on?
- I don't know.

778
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,510
'There goes a doctor.'

779
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,032
'First, let's take another look
with ASN's iso-cam.

780
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,076
'Wow! Talk about special effects!'

781
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,877
'You will obey without hesitation

782
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,952
'my every command.'

'And you will serve,
united by a glorious common goal -

'Yes. Because, from this moment on,

Come on, Joyce, I gotta get you out of here.

795
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,994
That wouldn't be a very good idea, Alex.

796
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:04,870
Wouldn't want you to ruin everything
we've been working so hard for.

797
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,958
Get him!

798
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,193
Look, Joyce, I gotta go back.

799
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,669
Excuse me but nobody leaves
until after intermission!

800
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:53,151
So get your popcorn, back to your seats,
and get ready for act two.

801
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,755
You ready for the second act?

802
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,432
I'll give you the second act.

803
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,078
Helena!

804
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,311
You meddlesome little twerp.

805
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,589
'Sweet, sweet revenge.

806
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,756
'A dish best served cold.'

807
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,794
But some like it hot.

808
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,872
And it's gonna get a hell of a lot hotter
before I'm through.

809
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,476
Give it a rest, Helena.

810
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,351
You always wanted to hog my glory,
didn't you?

811
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,318
I never wanted your glory, Helena.

812
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,959
I never did.

813
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,156
Liar!

814
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,435
You pathetic weakling.

815
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,998
Alex!

816
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,996
I didn't have any choice.

817
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,237
I had no choice, Joyce!

818
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,068
I had no choice, Joyce!

819
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,595
Argh!

820
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:29,199
No, Helena!
