1
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:11,819
- [Emcee] Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:15,574
receiving his fourth decoration
for meritorious service,

3
00:00:15,574 --> 00:00:17,995
Lieutenant Ray Harlan.

4
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:21,165
(audience applauding)

5
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:30,053
- [Dispatcher] All
units in the vicinity

6
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:32,848
of central Manhattan
bus terminal respond

7
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:35,102
to a possible hostage situation.

8
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,729
Shots have been fired.

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,317
(gunshots banging)

10
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:41,694
- [Ray] No!

11
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:44,407
- [Mom] Oh god, my boy!

12
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:45,992
- [Doctor] It's the
opinion of this doctor

13
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:48,078
that due to his involvements
in recent events culminating

14
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:51,166
in the death of an 11-year-old
boy, it would be best

15
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,128
if Lieutenant Harlan be
relieved of duty until...

16
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:08,023
- [Vlad] My people and I
make millions each year

17
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:11,360
while you scrape by
on the cop's salary.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,195
Justice, hm.

19
00:01:23,294 --> 00:01:24,629
- [Lou] Ray, will you come home?

20
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:27,007
There are other
cops in New York.

21
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:29,219
You don't have to be there.

22
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,055
You need some family.

23
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:33,058
Besides, I need you now.

24
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:47,202
- [Darcy] Ray Harlan,
ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:50,707
whose accomplishments
include four service awards,

26
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:54,838
three years with the NYPD, and
one very distinguished honor,

27
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,759
jumping the bones of
Mary-Jo Bronkowski.

28
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:08,775
- How you doing, brother?

29
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:11,153
Hey, that was cute.

30
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:12,405
- [Darcy] Yeah, I
thought you'd enjoy that.

31
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:13,990
Now get in, man,
we're in a hurry.

32
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,253
- Lookin' good.

33
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:26,758
(upbeat electronic music)

34
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:32,308
(siren blaring)

35
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:33,768
What's with the cherry?

36
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:35,187
- Well, the Black Rose Boys
are up to some mischief.

37
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:37,606
- Black Rose, huh?
- Russians.

38
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,025
I thought you should
hit the ground running.

39
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:49,122
(gunshots banging)

40
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:58,886
So they tell me the crime rate
in the Big Apple has dropped.

41
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:01,056
- Yeah, action's
getting a little stale.

42
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,016
I'm glad to be out of there.

43
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,980
- I can tell the boys here are
gonna love you coming back.

44
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,149
- I can always ride with
you, little brother.

45
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:10,444
- Just remember, that's
ride with me, not on me.

46
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,926
(gunshots banging)

47
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,064
- Gimme a break.

48
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:38,483
If it wasn't for me, you'd
probably be rotting away

49
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:40,861
in some cell with a bunkmate
who calls you Sally.

50
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,697
- I miss those lectures.

51
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:43,532
That's beautiful.

52
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:46,202
- You know, by the
way, those cigarettes,

53
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,164
they kill more people
than car accidents, drugs,

54
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:51,251
alcohol, and bullets combined.

55
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:52,210
- You quit again, huh?

56
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,838
How long's it been?

57
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:55,799
- Three days.
- Three days. (laughs)

58
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:59,805
(gunshots banging)

59
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,071
(gunshots banging)

60
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,117
Let's go.

61
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:16,745
- Put that away.

62
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:18,706
- Oh, you've got that
look in your eye.

63
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,796
(gunshots banging)

64
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:36,982
(gunshots banging)

65
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,455
(tires screeching)

66
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,289
- What the?

67
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,210
(fence clattering)

68
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,341
(gunshots banging)

69
00:04:57,301 --> 00:05:00,180
(gunshots banging)

70
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:05,855
- We can't stay here.

71
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:06,815
- What are you doing?

72
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:08,985
- Let's go inside, inside.

73
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,657
Split up.
- Of course.

74
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,380
- Cowboy Ray Harlan, I
should've known it was you.

75
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,214
- How you doin', Frenchy?

76
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:25,174
Good to see you.

77
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,384
- What's going on in there, huh?

78
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:27,218
- They knocked off a
high-stake poker game.

79
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:27,928
- Frenchy, the door.

80
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,432
Clear!

81
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:07,942
Just like hold times, eh?

82
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:12,949
- And as usual I'm
still watching your
back, little brother.

83
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,002
Nice homecoming.

84
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,541
(gunshots banging)

85
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,305
Go.

86
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:31,226
(gunshots banging)

87
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,911
(gunshots banging)

88
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:52,213
(gunshots banging)

89
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:02,519
(man shouting)

90
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,522
- He's gone over,
the son of a fell.

91
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:10,572
(man groaning)

92
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,081
(gunshots banging)

93
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,296
You have the right
to remain silent.

94
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:23,048
- Help, oh god!
(gunshots banging)

95
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:24,258
- The guy's a real
Einstein, huh?

96
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:25,134
- Noo too bright.

97
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,470
- Help, help me!

98
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,560
- I suggest you drop
that pea-shooter first.

99
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,689
- Help, help!

100
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:35,857
- Drop it!

101
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:37,526
- Okay, okay, okay.

102
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,120
Okay, it is gone, okay.

103
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:52,255
Help me, help me.

104
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:53,173
- How you doin'?

105
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:54,217
- [Man] Help.

106
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:55,552
- Say uncle.

107
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:57,179
- You crazy bastard, uncle.

108
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,058
- Say uncle please.

109
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:04,189
- Uncle, uncle please, help me.

110
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:11,115
- I don't know, I say
heads we drop him.

111
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,117
- Heads we drop him.

112
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,329
- I don't have any change,
you have any change?

113
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:16,956
- What are you doing?

114
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:17,791
Oh my god.

115
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:21,755
(dramatic music)

116
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:42,075
- [Dispatcher] 911.

117
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,578
- I think there's an
intruder in my apartment.

118
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,998
- [Dispatcher] One moment.

119
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:49,544
Megan Stewart, 2 Bolton
Street, Apartment 3.

120
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:51,046
Mam, the police have
been dispatched.

121
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:52,965
Stay where you are until
the officers arrive

122
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,133
and keep the line open.

123
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:05,983
- Hey, Frenchy, catch.

124
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:10,699
Heads or tails?

125
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:12,868
- Tails!

126
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:20,337
Hey, listen, Yankee and
Doodle, dispatch got a call.

127
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:21,464
Intruder.
- What are you doing?

128
00:10:21,464 --> 00:10:23,424
- 2 Bolton, number 3.

129
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,636
The building behind you.

130
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:26,804
- What'd he say?

131
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:27,722
- Come on, move!
- Where are you going?

132
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:28,807
- Get this guy down, now!

133
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:30,685
Let's move!

134
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:33,188
- Hey, what are you doing?

135
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:34,857
Freaks! You can't...

136
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:40,907
(dramatic music)

137
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:46,289
- You want the front or rear?

138
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:47,500
- I'm a backdoor man.

139
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,168
Stay behind him, let's go.

140
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:25,929
(Megan screams)

141
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:57,764
- [Dispatcher] Miss Stewart,
are you still there?

142
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:00,227
(Megan gasps)

143
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,075
- Drop the weapon.

144
00:12:12,244 --> 00:12:15,581
- Do not test me,
I will kill her.

145
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,000
- You kill her, I kill you.

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,585
- Hey!
- Shut up!

147
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:19,879
- Drop the weapon
and maybe your lawyer

148
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,172
will have you out on
the street by morning.

149
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:22,674
Now drop it.

150
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:27,681
- Yeah, don't do this, don't.

151
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:31,479
- All right.

152
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,775
- Easy.

153
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:50,380
(gunshots banging)

154
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,009
(Ivan groaning)

155
00:12:57,014 --> 00:13:01,228
- What kind of stupid, macho,
Neanderthal move was that?

156
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:02,480
- You're welcome.

157
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,400
- Who the hell do
you think you are?

158
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,526
You could've killed me.

159
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,613
- Ain't life a bowl of cherries.

160
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,491
(Frenchy and Darcy laughing)

161
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,910
- Ouch.

162
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,039
- I work for the police
department, I've got friends.

163
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,543
I want your badge number
because I'm gonna report you!

164
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,215
- What the hell happened here?

165
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:23,426
- That moron blew up my toilet.

166
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,639
- Well, that's a hell
of a first day, brother,

167
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,600
considering you
haven't punched in yet.

168
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:33,398
- [Ivan] Be careful!

169
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:35,485
- Wait till you
get to your cell.

170
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:36,612
Cuff him.

171
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:39,281
- [Darcy] Come on, scumbag.

172
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,702
- We got right to
make phone call.

173
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:44,122
- Don't tell me about
your rights, you moron.

174
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,751
- Can I have some
service over here?

175
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:47,585
Go on.

176
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:50,756
Gonna miss you guys.

177
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:02,273
Go in.

178
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,116
- Lou.

179
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:15,081
- Goddamn, it's good to see you!

180
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:20,924
It's hard to believe you've
only been here a few hours.

181
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:22,634
The whole station is buzzing.

182
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:26,222
Your reputation as a
hard-ass precedes you.

183
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:30,353
(upbeat rock music)

184
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:33,316
- [Vlad] The reports
I am getting are not
favorable, Mikael.

185
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:34,400
- [Mikael] Yes, Uncle.

186
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:38,239
- [Vlad] You waste
my time and my money.

187
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:39,783
- Uncle, they are lies.

188
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,414
We've had a few setbacks,
but nothing unusual.

189
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:49,338
I need more money for
bribery, to compete.

190
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:51,800
In this respect, the
competition is well ahead of us.

191
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,887
- [Vlad] No, there will
be no more investment

192
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,598
until I see results.

193
00:14:56,598 --> 00:15:00,103
This opportunity you
are squandering will
not last forever.

194
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:01,689
And Mikael.

195
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,358
- Yes, Uncle Vladimir?

196
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,527
- [Vlad] I have just
learned that my old friend

197
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:08,615
Lieutenant Ray Harlan has
arrived in your back yard.

198
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,284
- [Mikael] Should
this concern me?

199
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,786
- [Vlad] Very much so.

200
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,873
He has been a big problem
for me here in New York.

201
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:17,210
Do not underestimate him, he
doesn't play by the rules.

202
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,254
- Neither do we.

203
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,383
Do not worry, I will
take care of it.

204
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,428
- [Vlad] Do not let
me down, Mikael.

205
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:27,475
Even if you are my
blood, you will die.

206
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,209
- Now, Ray, you know
better than most

207
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,711
how Russians love payola.

208
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,884
You talk to me, huh, and
anyone I say is okay.

209
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,806
We'll put you on the
clock starting tomorrow.

210
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,435
Okay then.

211
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,482
Darcy, get him out of here.

212
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,829
Oh, hey, tonight you and
Darceú are coming for dinner.

213
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,249
- Oh, oh.

214
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:21,383
- What?

215
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,972
What are you looking
so warm and fuzzy for?

216
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:27,016
- Thanks for bringing me back.

217
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:31,064
New York was getting a little
shaky, you know, empty.

218
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:36,696
You two guys are the only
family I got, you know.

219
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,450
It's good to be home, Lou.

220
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:43,539
- Go, will ya?

221
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:44,625
I'm about to shed a tear.

222
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:47,378
- Thanks.

223
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,726
(light jazzy music)

224
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:07,573
- It's great having
you boys here.

225
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:11,620
I miss all the great
dinners we used to have.

226
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,541
- Great, I don't
know about that.

227
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,837
- Hey, wise guy, I
make a great stew.

228
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,841
- Brace yourself, Ray,
here comes the stew speech.

229
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,886
- Stew's a real healthy meal.

230
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:26,099
Did you know that poor people
don't get sick like the rich

231
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,477
because they eat a lot of stews?

232
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,729
Yeah, it's cheap to make,

233
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,692
and it has all the
necessary vitamins.

234
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:35,195
Now eat, you
ungrateful delinquents.

235
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,738
(Ray and Darcy laughing)

236
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:38,366
- I'm sorry, Lou, it must
have been tough for you, huh?

237
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:40,369
Raising a couple of
tough heads like us.

238
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,122
- Ah, it wasn't so bad.

239
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:47,796
As a matter of fact, most of
the time we had a ball, right?

240
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,302
You boys, you turned
out just fine.

241
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,017
I love you both very much.

242
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,276

258
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:48,798

272
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:38,493

274
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,330

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,874
And she's gonna be
working with you.

276
00:19:42,874 --> 00:19:44,126

I mean, she was so
pissed off at you

279
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:51,302
that she wanted me to have you
busted down to traffic cop.

280
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:54,932
Anyhow, after I calmed her down,
I found out that she worked

281
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:58,521
at Central Database
uptown at 21st Division.

offered her a raise

284
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:04,404

join our precinct.

285

- Well, how about buying me a
new toilet bowl, Mr. Harlan?

307
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:14,752
- Maybe we could take
up a little collection.

308
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:17,631
Maybe we'll pass around
a bowl, huh? (laughs)

- Yeah, three years now.

Just a little investment
for the future.

00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:24,559
Hey, Blue, Frenchy.

357
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,811
- [Frenchy] Hello, Ray.

358
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:26,771
- Take your best shot?

359
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,567
- Nice church, how many?

360
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:32,905
- [Darcy] Only four, but they
got the caretakers hostage.

361
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,283
I think they might be going
for the padre as well.

362
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:38,203
- I don't mind taking out a
gas station, but a church?

363
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:39,580
- Listen, anything or anybody

364
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,875
comes out those
doors, shoot 'em.

365
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,795
Let's go, little brother.

366
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:46,590
(dramatic music)

367
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,407
- I'm telling you,
we can't stay here.

368
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:06,035
They're stacking up out there.

369
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:07,620
- Who did Mikael put in charge?

370
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:15,882
- So what are you waiting for?

371
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:17,551
- Shut up and let me think.

372
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:27,648
Would you like to pray?

373
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:30,235
I'll let you pray
to me. (laughs)

374
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:46,091
- Look what I found.

375
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:49,637
- Excellent, Father, come here.

376
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:51,181
I have something
I want to confess.

377
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:53,684
- You mustn't do this, it
is an offense against God.

378
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:57,064
- We are your new
congregation, Father.

379
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:59,985
However, I must warn you,
we are pretty much atheists.

380
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,530
(men laughing)

381
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:09,957
- Boris, look out!

382
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:13,921
(gunshots banging)

383
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:16,508
(man shouting)

384
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,892
(gunshots banging)

385
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:30,486
(smack cracking)
- How dare you!

386
00:27:30,486 --> 00:27:33,323
- Get down!
(gunshot banging)

387
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:36,202
(gunshots banging)

388
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,708
- Stop this, this is blasphemy.

389
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:43,254
- Amen.

390
00:27:43,254 --> 00:27:45,715
(gunshot banging)
(priest groans)

391
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:48,636
(gunshots banging)

392
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,079
(gunshot banging)

393
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:40,417
(gunshot banging)
(man groans)

394
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:12,003
(blows cracking)

395
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,511
(blows cracking)

396
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,444
(blows thudding)

397
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:51,934
(blows thudding)

398
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:02,448
- Freeze, you son of a bitch.

399
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:06,787
You take your hands out
of that coat real slow.

400
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:07,956
Take 'em out slow!

401
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:10,418
- Relax, it's only a phone.

402
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:19,472
(laughing) I love America.

403
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:21,016
I'm going to call my lawyer.

404
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:23,645
He's going to get me out in
a few hours for a fraction

405
00:30:23,645 --> 00:30:26,274
of the price that I used
to pay in bribes in Moscow.

406
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:29,111
We own you, Yankee.

407
00:30:29,987 --> 00:30:30,821
- You all right?

408
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:35,495
(phone beeping)

409
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:36,329
- What are you doing?

410
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:37,706
I give up.

411
00:30:37,706 --> 00:30:40,001
- Two people died,
one was a priest.

412
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,588
(gunshot banging)
(man groaning)

413
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:43,756
- You shot me!

414
00:30:43,756 --> 00:30:44,674
You shot me!

415
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:47,595
- Guy's a real Einstein, huh?

416
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,430
- You missed.

417
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:54,688
- [Ray] No.

418
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:55,481
- You all right?

419
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,693
- He resisted.

420
00:30:58,652 --> 00:30:59,611
- Uh huh.

421
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:04,869
- Hey, by the way,
thanks, little buddy.

422
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:06,705
- Oh, you're welcome,
Marshall Dillon.

423
00:31:06,705 --> 00:31:09,375
- You have the right
to remain silent.

424
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:12,088
You have the right
to an attorney.

425
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:15,425
Everything can and will
be used against you

426
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,637
in a court of law.

427
00:31:17,637 --> 00:31:21,767
♪ I am blind, wrong or right

428
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:25,565

429
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:30,572

434
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:02,659
- Sit down.

435
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:10,252
I think you might want to take
it easy for a little while.

436
00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:12,923
Internal Affairs is
already sniffing around.

437
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:14,967
- I don't think you
should get involved, Lou.

438
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:21,310
- You know, when I asked
you to leave New York

439
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,772
and come and work with me,
and you said you were glad to,

440
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:26,942
I did everything I
could to make it happen.

441
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:31,574
Well, I called in favors
I didn't even know I had.

442
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,328
And now I owe favors.

443
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,083
The point that I'm making is.

444
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:40,795
- Thanks.

445
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:41,964
- You're like my
own flesh and blood.

446
00:32:43,424 --> 00:32:45,009
There isn't anything in the
world I wouldn't do for you.

447
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:49,933
But there's still a
job to be done, hm?

448
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:52,061
I'll deal with Internal Affairs.

449
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:54,063
You take care of
Mick and his boys.

450
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,695
And honestly I don't care
if they leave on a bus

451
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:03,619
or in a body bag, I
just want 'em wiped out.

452
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:09,335
- You know, Lou, I haven't seen
anything on these guys yet.

453
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:10,837
I mean, what do we
really know about them

454
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:13,966
besides the fact that Mikael
and Vladimir are related?

455
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:15,551
Nothing.

456
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:18,890
- Yeah, it is a
little disorganized
around here, isn't it?

457
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,018
Let's go to the computer room.

458
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:23,438
I think it's time you and
Megan got reacquainted.

459
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:27,443
- I don't think she
likes me too much, Lou.

460
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:30,572
- Use your boyish
charm, come on.

461
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:32,075
- Please, come on.

462
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:43,299
- Megan, you remember
Lieutenant Harlan.

463
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:44,217
- Not by choice.

464
00:33:45,678 --> 00:33:47,138
- Well, good to see you
again, too, Miss Stewart.

465
00:33:48,932 --> 00:33:53,605
- Megan, I know this isn't
your job description,

466
00:33:53,605 --> 00:33:55,524
but I'm in a time crunch.

467
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:57,652
I want you to work with Ray.

468
00:33:57,652 --> 00:33:59,989
Get this fancy equipment
to work up a composite

469
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:01,157
of what we're up against.

470
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:04,454
- I'll start on it
right away, Captain.

471
00:34:04,454 --> 00:34:08,292
- Good, well then I'll leave
you two to get to work.

472
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:34,537
- Are you gonna keep circling
around like a Mexican ass

473
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:37,166
grinding grain or are we
gonna get some work done, huh?

474
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,545
- Hey, what is
your problem, lady?

475
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,757
- You, I just don't like you.

476
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:44,593
- Why, because I
shot up your toilet?

477
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:47,472
Hey, you don't know me
well enough to dislike me.

478
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:49,141
- I know all about you.

479
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:51,645
Did you know that the FBI and
the NSA have files on you?

480
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:53,898
- Oh really, I had no idea.

481
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:57,528
- I know that you
received four decorations

482
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,322
for meritorious service.

483
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:02,451
- Well, see, I guess
I'm not so bad then.

484
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:03,953
- I also know you were
the biggest disturber

485
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:05,748
in the history of your precinct.

486
00:35:05,748 --> 00:35:07,583
I know that you were on
sick leave for six months,

487
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,628
then had to go through a
psych evaluation because of

488
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:12,549
your unorthodox behavior that
almost cost you your shield.

489
00:35:15,804 --> 00:35:19,434
- That's privileged information,
could get you arrested.

490
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:20,811
- I'm covered.

491
00:35:20,811 --> 00:35:22,354
- I'll bet you are.

492
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,857
- Look, the point
is, Lieutenant,
don't brush me aside.

493
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:27,946
I'm not some chick, I'm
an asset to this force.

494
00:35:27,946 --> 00:35:31,534
- Hey, files don't tell you
everything, Miss Stewart.

495
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:33,536
They have a tendency to
leave out the person.

496
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:35,622
- Oh, fill in the blanks for me.

497
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:40,254
- Well, maybe one day when
you cut me some slack, I will.

498
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:47,389
- You're so full of it.

499
00:35:47,389 --> 00:35:50,435
The captain stole that
sword from some sushi bar

500
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:52,521
in San Francisco,
everybody knows that.

501
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:54,316
- You know, this was
given to Lou by a family

502
00:35:54,316 --> 00:35:58,321
of sword masters on
the island of Shiku--

503
00:35:58,321 --> 00:35:59,239
- Shokoko.

504
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,199
- Shokoko, it doesn't matter.

505
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,408
Anyway, it's not about that.

506
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,203
It's about the steel
and the force of spirit

507
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,538
behind that steel, which
you wouldn't understand.

508
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,040
- We've listened to
lot of your stories,

509
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,961
but there's no way that you
can expect me to believe that

510
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:13,009
the lieutenant here can cut
through steel with that sword.

511
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:17,014
- This is Japanese samurai,
strongest steel known to man.

512
00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:19,017
Wrapped over 200 times.

513
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:19,851
Ray.

514
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:24,149
- You got money that
says this can't be done?

515
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,734
- 100 bucks.

516
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:26,986
- Whoa.

517
00:36:26,986 --> 00:36:28,488
100 bucks, man, put
that money up here.

518
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:29,990
- He's a rich boy.
- You hear that? 100 bucks.

519
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,576
We got any other takers?

520
00:36:31,576 --> 00:36:32,494
French, collect
the money, come on.

521
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,664
- Here, take it.

522
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:36,833
- 100 bucks.
- Hey, anybody else?

523
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,419
Come on, losers.

524
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:39,921
- What are you
packin' in here, man?

525
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:41,298
- .357 magnum.

526
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:43,009
- Oh, that's a big boy.

527
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:44,010
- That's stopping power.

528
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,888

672
00:48:58,537 --> 00:49:00,958
I went to college, I got

678
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,412
- So Lou said he
raised you and Darcy.

679
00:49:29,873 --> 00:49:33,628
- Mhm, my mom died about six
months after Dad passed away.

680
00:49:35,464 --> 00:49:36,382
- How did she die?

681
00:49:39,261 --> 00:49:41,765
- I guess a broken heart.

682
00:49:47,939 --> 00:49:49,567
- That must've been really hard.

683
00:49:51,111 --> 00:49:53,406
- Well, abandonment
is always tough.

684
00:49:59,623 --> 00:50:02,460
- I guess Lou had to pull a
lot of strings to get you here.

685
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,754
- Yeah, well you know Lou.

686
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:06,925

687
00:50:09,428 --> 00:50:12,182

only family I've got.

688
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:19,150
- Lou seems to have a
really protective demeanor.

689
00:50:20,235 --> 00:50:21,445
- He's got a good reason to.

690
00:50:21,445 --> 00:50:24,407
I mean, him and my dad,
they were like this.

691
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:25,952
They were closer than brothers.

692
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:30,791
And he saw my father die along
with a lot of other guys.

693
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:35,172
And then he came home to what?

694
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:39,053
Not exactly a hero's
welcome after Vietnam.

695
00:50:45,562 --> 00:50:48,859
And how he's a cop,
a damn good one too.

696
00:50:52,655 --> 00:50:53,782
Another thankless job.

697
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:58,497
- I don't why anybody would
ever want to be a cop.

698
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:01,292
I mean, it certainly
isn't the money.

699
00:51:03,003 --> 00:51:03,796
What is it?

700
00:51:06,675 --> 00:51:08,970
- Free parking. (laughs)

701
00:51:18,817 --> 00:51:21,362

Oh, and Ray.

704
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,186
- You know, it's been a
long time since I picked up

705
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:45,896
one of you boys
from the hospital.

706
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,819
- Hey, nice, Lou.

707
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:52,656
Last time I was driving
in the car with you,

708
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:54,784
I think you had tape
on your ripped seats

709
00:51:54,784 --> 00:51:56,411
and it smelled like cat piss.

710
00:51:57,955 --> 00:52:00,041
- Come a long way since then.

711
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:02,127
Things have changed,
for Darcy too.

712
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,425
Our investments have paid
off, haven't they, Darce?

713
00:52:09,096 --> 00:52:11,933
Hey, slugger, we gotta
talk about your future.

714
00:52:11,933 --> 00:52:13,685
You know, getting
you on board with us.

715
00:52:13,685 --> 00:52:16,564
We're family, right?
Got to stick together.

716
00:52:16,564 --> 00:52:18,150
- I don't have any money, Lou.

717
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,736
I mean, I spend it
faster than I make it.

718
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,864
- Did you hear me ask
this guy for a loan?

719
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:24,951
I'm talking about making money.

720
00:52:27,955 --> 00:52:29,540
- Paid Mikael Pushkin a visit.

721
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,168
- You what?

722
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:33,713
You're one crazy son of
a bitch, you know that?

723
00:52:33,713 --> 00:52:35,508
I'm surprised you
didn't get killed.

724
00:52:36,592 --> 00:52:37,426
What happened?

725
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:42,643
- He went on about how great
and powerful his people are.

726
00:52:42,643 --> 00:52:46,023
- Hey, the only thing they're
good at is drinking vodka.

727
00:52:46,023 --> 00:52:47,566
What else?

728
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:49,485
- Some bull about how some

729
00:52:49,485 --> 00:52:51,613
of the city's police
department is corrupt.

730
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:56,871
- Those Ruskie bastards, they
think everybody's corrupt.

731
00:52:56,871 --> 00:52:58,415
- Yeah, well I asked
him for some names.

732
00:52:58,415 --> 00:53:00,292
He couldn't give me any, so
I told him he's full of it.

733
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:03,171
- And then what happened?

734
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:05,174
- He said one thing or another,
I said one thing or another.

735
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:08,637
And then he threatened to
kill me next time he sees me.

736
00:53:10,306 --> 00:53:11,850
- Jesus, Ray, come on,
take it easy will you?

737
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,726
Be careful.

738
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,857
I can use a drink.

739
00:53:18,401 --> 00:53:20,862
Why don't we go to our
place and have a few, huh?

740
00:53:20,862 --> 00:53:23,325
Darcy could probably use
one, what do you say?

741
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,159

end up putting together a
place like Kops and Krooks?

750

the investments go.

01:02:00,464 --> 01:02:01,507
Trust no one.

878
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:15,194
- Hi, Ray.

879
01:02:18,656 --> 01:02:23,121
I heard about
Darcy, I'm so sorry.

880
01:02:34,762 --> 01:02:36,598
- I loved him so much.

881
01:02:38,768 --> 01:02:39,603
- I know.

882
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,447
- Boy, Lou took it really hard.

883
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:49,658
He took it real, real hard.

884
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:57,335
- Ray, I don't know
how to tell you this.

885
01:03:00,757 --> 01:03:01,549
- What?

886
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:05,680
- I think Lou was involved.

887
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:11,981
- Oh, come on, Megan,
don't do this to me.

888
01:03:11,981 --> 01:03:13,483
Not right now. Come on, please.

889
01:03:13,483 --> 01:03:15,110
- No, Ray, you
need to hear this.

890
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,448
I had suspicions.

891
01:03:18,448 --> 01:03:21,286
There were rumors
about crooked cops,

892
01:03:21,286 --> 01:03:22,954
so I ran a random
check on the computer.

893
01:03:22,954 --> 01:03:24,165
I found something on Lou.

894
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:27,420
- Can't be. You have no proof.

895
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,297
- No, Ray, I know how
hard it is to hear this,

896
01:03:29,297 --> 01:03:30,632
but I do have proof.

897
01:03:36,473 --> 01:03:39,770
He's got $1.3 million
in a Cayman account.

898
01:03:45,945 --> 01:03:47,906
- I don't believe this.

899
01:03:47,906 --> 01:03:50,535
- Lou and Frenchy
have about the same.

900
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,369
- What?

901
01:03:57,002 --> 01:03:57,837
What?

902
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:01,926
What?

903
01:04:06,432 --> 01:04:07,726
What about Darcy?

904
01:04:12,941 --> 01:04:15,027
Well, goddamn it all.

905
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:16,696
Goddamn it all.

906
01:04:22,622 --> 01:04:24,040
That does not mean that Lou

907
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,293
had anything to do with
Darcy's death though.

908
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:30,257
Pushkin has got to have
something to do with this.

909
01:04:37,518 --> 01:04:39,145
Hey, Joe, it's Ray.

910
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:40,397
- [Joe] Yes, sir?

911
01:04:40,397 --> 01:04:42,483
- Listen, I want you
to bring Mikael Pushkin

912
01:04:42,483 --> 01:04:44,944
to the interrogation
room right now.

913
01:04:44,944 --> 01:04:46,196
- [Joe] Blue and Frenchy
just picked him up.

914
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:47,114
- What?

915
01:04:47,114 --> 01:04:48,366
- [Joe] Yeah, Captain's orders.

916
01:04:48,366 --> 01:04:50,369
- When?
- 15 minutes ago.

917
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:54,667
- Thanks, Joe.
- Sure.

918
01:04:59,464 --> 01:05:00,466
- [Megan] What is it?

919
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,804
- Blue and Frenchy
just picked up Pushkin,

920
01:05:03,804 --> 01:05:05,264
and Lou ordered the release.

921
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:35,306
(blow cracking)
(man groaning)

922
01:05:49,534 --> 01:05:52,539
- Hello, Ray, look what I got.

923
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:03,846
- What are you doing, Lou?

924
01:06:03,846 --> 01:06:05,348
- What you should've
done when you had him.

925
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:08,936
You're not getting soft
on me, are you, Ray?

926
01:06:11,064 --> 01:06:12,901
- He didn't kill Darcy.

927
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:13,693
- No?

928
01:06:16,822 --> 01:06:17,658
Then who did?

929
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:27,129
- Ray, please help me.

930
01:06:28,172 --> 01:06:31,510
Please, I know.

931
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:36,517
(gunshot banging)
(Mikael shouts)

932
01:06:37,686 --> 01:06:39,897
- That's for Darcy, you
Ruskie son of a bitch.

933
01:06:44,445 --> 01:06:46,281
- What did he know, Lou?

934
01:06:46,281 --> 01:06:49,160
- Nothing. What's there to know?

935
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,884
- I know about your
Cayman bank account.

936
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:05,600
I know about yours too.

937
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:11,858
And yours.

938
01:07:13,276 --> 01:07:17,157
- Well, that's very interesting.

939
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:21,162
How did you come by
this information?

940
01:07:24,209 --> 01:07:27,380
Of course, Megan Stewart.

941
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:31,677
Who else have you shared
this information with?

942
01:07:32,721 --> 01:07:33,555
- Nobody yet.

943
01:07:40,106 --> 01:07:43,611
I want to know who
killed my brother.

944
01:07:43,611 --> 01:07:44,445
Was it you?

945
01:07:46,323 --> 01:07:47,533
- I could never do that.

946
01:08:05,934 --> 01:08:07,352
He had no choice.

947
01:08:10,982 --> 01:08:15,989
- No choice, huh?

948
01:08:16,574 --> 01:08:17,826
No choice?

949
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,747
And you stood by and
you just let it happen.

950
01:08:21,747 --> 01:08:23,500
- I didn't know
anything about it.

951
01:08:25,086 --> 01:08:26,128
It's out of my hands.

952
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:32,596
This is way bigger
than you, me, or Darcy.

953
01:08:33,973 --> 01:08:38,688
Ray, I'm just a pawn
in the king's court.

954
01:08:40,523 --> 01:08:43,570
You wouldn't believe the power
of the people involved here.

955
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:46,073
- A pawn, you mean like me?

956
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:51,163
You called me in here
to take care of Mikael

957
01:08:51,163 --> 01:08:53,083
because he was cuttin'
in on your business.

958
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:54,961
And that's the only
reason, isn't it?

959
01:08:56,296 --> 01:08:58,716
- No, I wanted you
to come in with us.

960
01:08:58,716 --> 01:09:01,637
You, me, and Darcy, we
would've been great together.

961
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:04,933
- You know, I
might've done it, Lou.

962
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:10,733
I might've done it, but now
the sight of you makes me sick.

963
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:18,869
I thought you were our father.

964
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,627
I was wrong because a
father would never, ever

965
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,254
let anybody do that to his son.

966
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:30,135
- We had no choice, Ray.

967
01:09:30,135 --> 01:09:33,682
He was getting
weak. He wanted out.

968
01:09:33,682 --> 01:09:36,060
People above thought he
was talking too much.

969
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,315
- You always have
a choice, Frenchy,

970
01:09:40,441 --> 01:09:43,111
and apparently you
guys have made yours.

971
01:09:45,323 --> 01:09:47,117
Now I'm gonna make mine.

972
01:09:47,117 --> 01:09:52,124
- Ray, I'm begging you, join us.

973
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:53,334
It's not too late.

974
01:09:54,669 --> 01:09:56,129
- Oh, come on, Lou.

975
01:09:56,129 --> 01:09:57,841
Oh, it's way too late for that.

976
01:10:05,226 --> 01:10:06,310
Jesus Christ.

977
01:10:16,617 --> 01:10:18,870
What are you gonna do, Lou?

978
01:10:21,665 --> 01:10:24,168
You gonna kill me too, Father?

979
01:10:29,385 --> 01:10:30,762
(gunshots banging)

980
01:10:30,762 --> 01:10:33,724
(glass shattering)

981
01:10:38,523 --> 01:10:41,443
(gunshots banging)

982
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:51,248
(dramatic music)

983
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,835
(horn honking)

984
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,020
- [Frenchy] Should
we make a call?

985
01:11:12,946 --> 01:11:14,990
- No, this is personal.

986
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:16,200
He'll be back.

987
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:18,579
I know him well.

988
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:22,709
- Megan!

989
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:24,127
God, are you all right?

990
01:11:24,127 --> 01:11:25,046
- Ray, what the
hell is going on?

991
01:11:25,046 --> 01:11:26,214
Where have you been?

992
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:27,424
I've been leaving
messages all over town.

993
01:11:27,424 --> 01:11:28,759
- Just listen to to
me, listen to me.

994
01:11:28,759 --> 01:11:30,136
- What happened?
- I gotta get you out of here.

995
01:11:30,136 --> 01:11:30,929
- What's going on?
- Look, I can't explain it

996
01:11:30,929 --> 01:11:32,306
to you right now, okay?

997
01:11:32,306 --> 01:11:33,390
- Where are we going?

998
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,268
- I don't know, a motel maybe.

999
01:11:35,268 --> 01:11:36,186
- A motel?

1000
01:11:37,313 --> 01:11:38,982
- I don't even know
who I can trust.

1001
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,487
But you got to trust me, okay?

1002
01:11:43,655 --> 01:11:44,906
Please, please, come on.

1003
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:53,418
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1004
01:12:14,407 --> 01:12:15,324
- Why don't you take a shower

1005
01:12:15,324 --> 01:12:16,660
and grab a couple hours' sleep?

1006
01:12:18,913 --> 01:12:23,628
I think you could use it.

1007
01:12:23,628 --> 01:12:24,462
- Yeah.

1008
01:12:39,107 --> 01:12:41,695
(somber music)

1009
01:12:46,034 --> 01:12:46,868
Oh Jesus.

1010
01:13:03,266 --> 01:13:06,062
Never, ever let anybody
do that to his son.

1011
01:13:06,062 --> 01:13:08,482
- [Darcy] Just a little
investment for the future.

1012
01:13:08,482 --> 01:13:09,900
You know, can't be
cops forever, right?

1013
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,111
- [Megan] There were
rumors about crooked cops,

1014
01:13:11,111 --> 01:13:12,779
so I ran a random
check on the computer.

1015
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:14,281
- [Mikael] Check your
own department, Ray.

1016
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:15,575
That's where the answer is.

1017
01:13:15,575 --> 01:13:17,620
- [Megan] I found
something on Lou.

1018
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,080
- [Lou] Things have changed.

1019
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,084
- [Megan] He's got $1.3
million in a Cayman account.

1020
01:13:22,084 --> 01:13:24,921
- [Lou] Our investments have
paid off, haven't they, Darce?

1021
01:13:24,921 --> 01:13:27,509
- [Megan] Lou and Frenchy
have about the same.

1022
01:13:27,509 --> 01:13:30,053
- [Frenchy] People above
thought he was talking too much.

1023
01:13:30,053 --> 01:13:31,514
- [Darcy] You know
I love Lou, right?

1024
01:13:31,514 --> 01:13:34,894
This partnership with
him is killing me.

1025
01:13:34,894 --> 01:13:38,440
- [Ray] Are you gonna
kill me too, Father?

1026
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:52,460
- What are you doing?

1027
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:55,298
- I'm going.

1028
01:14:00,012 --> 01:14:02,265
- Where are you going, Ray?

1029
01:14:11,904 --> 01:14:13,448
- What are you doing?

1030
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:15,326
- I'm not sitting around here
while you get yourself killed.

1031
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,457
I'm going back to the police
station to back up the files

1032
01:14:19,457 --> 01:14:21,459
so nobody erases them.

1033
01:14:21,459 --> 01:14:23,503
- Hey, that's a
really good idea,

1034
01:14:23,503 --> 01:14:25,047
but I don't want you doing it.

1035
01:14:25,047 --> 01:14:26,758
Now come on, this is very
personal to me right now.

1036
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:28,260
This is between me and Lou.

1037
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,137
I don't want you involved.

1038
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:32,099
- I'm already involved, Ray.

1039
01:14:32,099 --> 01:14:33,226
They want me dead too.

1040
01:14:35,061 --> 01:14:38,066
Besides, I'll be at the police
station where I can be safer.

1041
01:14:43,782 --> 01:14:45,326
- Know how to use one of these?

1042
01:14:47,496 --> 01:14:49,123
- Yeah.

1043
01:14:49,123 --> 01:14:51,126
- The safety's on, take it.

1044
01:15:57,134 --> 01:15:59,137
- [Frenchy] I can't
believe you came back, Ray.

1045
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,726
I thought you were
smarter than that.

1046
01:16:05,521 --> 01:16:06,898
You may not be in New York,

1047
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:10,778
but you're way out of
your league, mon ami.

1048
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:12,990
Welcome home.

1049
01:16:21,252 --> 01:16:25,173
- You're gonna wish I
never came back, Frenchy.

1050
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:28,345
When you shot my brother,
you killed yourself.

1051
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:36,648
(gunshots banging)

1052
01:16:55,883 --> 01:16:58,804
(gunshots banging)

1053
01:17:24,924 --> 01:17:27,219
(gunshot banging)
(Blue shouting)

1054
01:17:27,219 --> 01:17:30,181
(gunshots banging)

1055
01:17:40,237 --> 01:17:43,157
(gunshots banging)

1056
01:19:00,349 --> 01:19:03,312
(gunshots banging)

1057
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,909
(gunshot banging)

1058
01:19:13,909 --> 01:19:16,580
(siren blaring)

1059
01:19:37,151 --> 01:19:38,736
- I'm standing behind you, Ray.

1060
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:41,072
Drop your guns.

1061
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,294
It's all been said before.

1062
01:19:52,297 --> 01:19:53,715
There's nothing more to say.

1063
01:19:55,802 --> 01:19:56,636
- Wrong.

1064
01:19:59,182 --> 01:20:00,892
Drop the guns or I drop you.

1065
01:20:03,062 --> 01:20:03,896
Now!

1066
01:20:13,535 --> 01:20:14,369
One.

1067
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:17,123
Two.

1068
01:20:20,294 --> 01:20:21,128
Three.

1069
01:20:21,128 --> 01:20:22,130
(gunshot banging)

1070
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:25,093
(kick thudding)
(Frenchy groans)

1071
01:20:25,093 --> 01:20:25,927
- Run!

1072
01:20:30,433 --> 01:20:33,354
(gunshots banging)

1073
01:20:43,827 --> 01:20:44,661
Geez.

1074
01:20:46,247 --> 01:20:48,166
Gimme the gun.

1075
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:51,129
Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, are you?

1076
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:31,936
- What are you doing here?

1077
01:21:31,936 --> 01:21:32,938
- You're welcome.

1078
01:21:32,938 --> 01:21:34,523
- I can't believe you shot him.

1079
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:37,026
- I said I would.

1080
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:38,320
- That you did.

1081
01:21:40,657 --> 01:21:43,619
(gunshots banging)

1082
01:21:58,724 --> 01:22:00,101
We can't stay here too long.

1083
01:22:01,978 --> 01:22:02,813
Oh geez.

1084
01:22:05,483 --> 01:22:07,444
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1085
01:22:08,779 --> 01:22:09,739
- There's some gas in there.

1086
01:22:09,739 --> 01:22:11,074
I hope there's enough.

1087
01:22:11,074 --> 01:22:12,033
Hey, take my tourniquet off.

1088
01:22:12,033 --> 01:22:13,077
- What?

1089
01:22:13,077 --> 01:22:14,246
Oh god.
- Just take it off.

1090
01:22:14,246 --> 01:22:16,248
- Oh god, oh god, there.

1091
01:22:21,589 --> 01:22:22,423
Careful.

1092
01:22:22,423 --> 01:22:25,344
(gunshots banging)

1093
01:22:29,099 --> 01:22:32,020
(gunshots banging)

1094
01:22:36,777 --> 01:22:40,490
- Oh, damn it, I shouldn't
have quit smoking.

1095
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:42,160
- Here, here, here.

1096
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,161
- You smoke?

1097
01:22:49,628 --> 01:22:50,838
- Gimme that.
- Damn it.

1098
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:52,715
Try to get it there.

1099
01:22:52,715 --> 01:22:53,926
- [Megan] There, I got it.

1100
01:22:53,926 --> 01:22:54,843
That's it, it's going.

1101
01:22:54,843 --> 01:22:57,264
- Okay, now run like heck, go.

1102
01:23:01,562 --> 01:23:05,025
(gunshots banging)

1103
01:23:05,025 --> 01:23:07,695
(dramatic music)

1104
01:23:24,969 --> 01:23:25,971
- Oh my god.

1105
01:23:28,265 --> 01:23:30,227
(explosion booming)

1106
01:23:30,227 --> 01:23:33,189
(Frenchy shouting)

1107
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,334
- Megan?

1108
01:23:59,976 --> 01:24:01,771
- I remember teaching
you how to use that.

1109
01:24:08,488 --> 01:24:12,286
Hurts like hell,
but I'm still alive.

1110
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:25,554
- You all right?

1111
01:24:31,938 --> 01:24:35,401
- It's the final
scene, huh, Ray?

1112
01:24:35,401 --> 01:24:36,485
Father against son.

1113
01:24:39,865 --> 01:24:42,869
- No, Lou, no.

1114
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,959
Father against himself.

1115
01:25:05,151 --> 01:25:06,862
Megan and I are
walking out of here.

1116
01:25:11,702 --> 01:25:12,620
- I don't think so.

1117
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:27,724
- Trust me, he won't shoot you.

1118
01:25:45,624 --> 01:25:46,751
- Don't move.

1119
01:26:09,908 --> 01:26:11,493
Ray, don't test me.

1120
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:16,375
Ray.

1121
01:26:18,587 --> 01:26:19,421
Ray!

1122
01:26:22,092 --> 01:26:22,926
Ray!

1123
01:26:25,054 --> 01:26:25,888
Ray!

1124
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:46,877
Ray!

1125
01:26:49,839 --> 01:26:51,466
I'm sorry.

1126
01:26:51,466 --> 01:26:52,259
Darcy!

1127
01:26:57,266 --> 01:26:58,101
Darcy.

1128
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:46,210
(dramatic music)

1129
01:32:29,564 --> 01:32:32,485
(triumphant music)
