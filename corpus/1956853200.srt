1
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,040
Yes?

2
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,870
Someone is here, someone is in my room

3
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,320
Someone will be up immediatly.

4
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,640
Something is...

5
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,240
Come in!

6
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,010
Someone was in here.

7
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,620
Whoever it was left that bag.

8
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,710
Did you open it?

9
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,720
No.

10
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,220
Did you touch it?

11
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,500
No.

12
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,750
Who knows what's inside of that bag?

13
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
I was afraid to even go near it.

14
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,500
Perhaps...

15
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,980
...there's another person...

16
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,310
...who left the bag...

17
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,810
...which is...

18
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,590
...very beautiful.

19
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,490
You know...

20
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,690
I just arrived yesterday.

21
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
I don't know anyone here in Shanghai.

22
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,270
You have met no one here?

23
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,230
No, I'm telling you. I met no one.

24
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,460
I went out today for a lunch meeting with
a woman I work with.

25
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,470
Several others in our company will arrive
tomorrow.

26
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,540
We needed...

27
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,580
...to go over arrangements.

28
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,340
Lunch...

29
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,750
yes,

30
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
but now, it's very late in the night.

31
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,550
Yes.

32
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,910
I went after lunch to see the tower

33
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,340
The Pearl Tower

34
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,910
I went to see it.

35
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,510
I had learned it was inspired by a poem

36
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,620
a poem about...

37
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,970
...different sized pearls falling in jade...

38
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,780
...a jade plate...

39
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,210
I thought I heard this sound...

40
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,530
...as I looked up at the Tower.

41
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,120
I felt...

42
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,710
Yes?

43
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,200
I...

44
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,980
It's... 

45
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,540
...it's silly

46
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,980
What?

47
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,170
I felt I had been here before...

48
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,560
...in Shanghai

49
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,670
This feeling came over me as I heard...

50
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,020
...the pearls...

51
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,930
...falling and hitting the jade...

52
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,340
That most beautiful sound

53
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
I don't know...

54
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,550
...where or how I...

55
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,390
...went in.

56
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,930
It seemed as if suddenly I was in the old Shanghai

57
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
I saw...

58
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
...buildings...

59
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,390
...winding alleys...

60
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,060
...narrow stairs...

61
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,710
...I heard music...

62
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,790
I can't be here.

63
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,210
I wish I could...

64
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,980
...to be with you.

65
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,620
It's all very beautiful...

66
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,630
...so beautiful...

67
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's very beautiful...

68
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Yes...

69
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
You know...

70
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,710
...I have to leave you...

71
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,460
Please...

72
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
...I love you!

73
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
And I love you!

74
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,070
I love you!
