1
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:37,305
- I don't know if I want to do this.
- Relax, Laine.

2
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,653
It's fun.

3
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:41,040
First, the rules.

4
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:44,023
You can never, ever play alone.

5
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:48,933
You can never play in a graveyard
and you always have to say goodbye.

6
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:52,992
To start, you circle the
board, once for each player.

7
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:57,861
Then we say, as friends we
gather, hearts are true.

8
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,583
As friends we gather, hearts are true.

9
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:05,259
- Spirits near, we call to you.
- Spirits near, we call to you.

10
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,504
Is someone here with us?

11
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:18,834
- Debbie, cut it out.
- If a ghost is here...

12
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:21,356
you can see them through the planchette.

13
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:25,539
It's the eye to the other side.

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,353
If someone is here with us, make yourself known.

15
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:50,608
- What are you guys doing?
- Get out of here, Sarah!

16
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:55,077
Calm down, it's only a game.

17
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:32,394
Goodbye.

18
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:06,997
Laine, hey.

19
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:07,847
<i>Deb.</i>

20
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:08,797
<i>Where are you?</i>

21
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,893
<i>I'm... I'm here.</i>

22
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,379
<i>I've been here.</i>

23
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,328
<i>Just been a little rough...</i>

24
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,614
<i>this week.</i>

25
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,113
You've gotta tell me what's been going on,
and don't think you're bailing on me, again.

26
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,457
We're gonna be late for the game.

27
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:23,588
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

28
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,814
<i>You know, I don't think I'm coming.</i>

29
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:30,028
Oh, well, I'm not leaving
until I get to talk to you.

30
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:33,009
Fine.

31
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,558
I'll be right out, just gimme a sec.

32
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,555
<i>What's going on?</i>

33
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:57,672
- You sick?
- No.

34
00:03:57,998 --> 00:04:00,599
- Did you and Pete have a fight?
- No, nothing like that.

35
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:03,171
- Then what is it?
- Nothing.

36
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:04,469
Debbie, tell me.

37
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:06,841
I just don't wanna go out tonight.

38
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,935
No secrets between us, remember?

39
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:15,517
Remember that game we used to play?
Where you ask questions about the future.

40
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,012
- The Ouija board.
- Yeah.

41
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,803
Couple weeks ago...

42
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:21,896
I played it.

43
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:24,839
Just... messing around and...

44
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:30,962
I don't know, I don't know.

45
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,192
That is just a game.

46
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:39,353
- You know you've always been like this, right?
- Like what?

47
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:41,230
Just a total and complete spaz.

48
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:46,189
You're right, I'm being crazy.

49
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:48,493
Look, I don't even have to
go to the basketball game.

50
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:50,474
We always lose, I'm just
gonna come with you, and...

51
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:51,130
No, don't.

52
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,672
I mean... my folks are gonna be home any minute.

53
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:57,246
And I'm just being dramatic.

54
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:59,254
And everything is fine.

55
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,825
Are you sure you don't wanna come?

56
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:05,852
I have leftovers inside, I'm gonna rock
it out, but I will see you in the morning.

57
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,099
- Thats for sure.
- Okay. Do you want me to order for you?

58
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,662
- And give you the works?
- Uh, huh.

59
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:11,326
Okay.

60
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:13,962
- I miss you.
- I miss you already.

61
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:06,338
No.

62
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:39,659
Laine, hey, sorry I'm late.

63
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:41,893
I have a surprise for you.

64
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,870
Check this out.

65
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,616
Oh, you have a map.

66
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:47,921
Yep, this is the place I was telling you about.

67
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:51,054
It's up the coast, away from everyone,
we make camp right about here.

68
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:51,890
Yeah.

69
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:53,585
Hike down to the beach any time we want.

70
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:56,932
- The first time I'm here and it is we?
- I want you to come with.

71
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,862
But I thought this was your big
camping trip with the guys.

72
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:04,266
I know, but I started thinking about it,
and I reaIzed I'd miss you too much.

73
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,732
Okay, you're surfing all day, what do I do?

74
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,269
I'm gonna teach you, by the end of the
week you'll be one with the waves.

75
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:11,588
- Its gonna be awesome.
- Oh my, no.

76
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,382
I promise, come on. Forget about the world
for awhile, leave it all behind.

77
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,260
- I can't wait to see you run this past my dad.
- I got that covered, too.

78
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,878
Tell him it's a Senior trip. Fully chaperoned.

79
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,131
- Good luck with that.
- What? I can be persuasive.

80
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:25,745
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been told this.

81
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:26,808
- By who?
- You.

82
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:28,419
Every day.

83
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,834
Okay, very cute, break it up, you two..

84
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:33,532
- Hi.
- Hello.

85
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:35,182
- Hey, Iz, a little more brain juice?
- Uh, huh.

86
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:39,819
Where's Debbie?

87
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:41,574
Oh, I think she's running late.

88
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:45,331
So, what time will you be
leaving that party, tonight?

89
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:47,591
- I think we're passing.
- Yeah.

90
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:50,182
- Like, watch a movie, or something.
- No.

91
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,455
Come on, you guys can't.
Lainey's making you bail on me.

92
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:56,203
You're a big girl, Iz. There's
nothing wrong with flying solo.

93
00:10:56,426 --> 00:10:58,154
Yeah, me showing up alone.

94
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,878
Its not really a good "look" for me.

95
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,341
- And everybody has, you know, "this."
- What's "this"?

96
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:05,133
Your perfect couple situation.

97
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:09,134
Look at her. Acting like she's not the one who
breaks up with every guy she goes out with.

98
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,235
I can't help it, I'm a picky bitch.

99
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,676
God!

100
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:19,352
What's up?

101
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:22,352
I gotta go, it's my dad.

102
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,118
Let me guess, your sister?

103
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,951
Yep, causing chaos, wherever she goes.
I'm sorry, guys. Come on.

104
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:42,317
- What's going on?
- I'm so sorry.

105
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:45,839
Nona wanted to be here for you.
Laine, sit down, we need to talk.

106
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:47,784
I don't wanna sit down. Just
tell me what's going on?

107
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:48,809
Laine, sit down!

108
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:51,154
I don't wanna sit down! Someone
tell me what's going on!

109
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,292
It's about Debbie.

110
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:31,048
- Nona, can I talk to you?
- Uh, huh.

111
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,778
I don't think I can go in.

112
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:38,692
This doesn't seem real, she
should-she should still be here.

113
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:40,917
She's still here.

114
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,364
She's right here.

115
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,597
Here.

116
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:54,285
I just don't understand.

117
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:56,253
None of us can.

118
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,958
She told me, she told me that
she'd see us next morning.

119
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:00,743
Why would she say that if she was going to...?

120
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:01,983
We'll never know.

121
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:09,274
I wish she would've talked to
us, about whatever it was.

122
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,101
I know what the police say,
but I can't believe she'd ever...

123
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,412
And that Carol found her like that?

124
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:27,626
It's just horrible.

125
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:30,445
They're packed and coming to stay with me.

126
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,235
Can't be in this house and feel right.

127
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,359
Pete.

128
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:39,749
Laine.

129
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:44,827
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

130
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,933
I brought flowers.

131
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,404
- Debbie liked this kind.
- They're really pretty.

132
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,121
Do you want me to put them in some water?

133
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:00,998
No, I'll find her mom. I should give them to her.

134
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,667
Laine.

135
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:24,793
- You were everything to her.
- Mrs. G.

136
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,272
Sorry, I just...

137
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:33,297
I just wanted to be in her room.

138
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,873
It's okay.

139
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:41,464
The hours you two spent in here.

140
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:46,293
By fifth grade, you-you'd picked out your college.

141
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:52,541
She used to draw pictures of...

142
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,388
of what our dorms would look like.

143
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:58,313
Everything was purple.

144
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,209
Yeah, I remember that.

145
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:05,471
Her purple phase.

146
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:09,411
Thank you for watching the
house while we're gone.

147
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,818
I don't know when we'll be back.

148
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:15,508
Here.

149
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,972
I put these things together for you.

150
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:22,966
She'd want you to have them.

151
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,473
Always remember her.

152
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:31,244
<i>No, that's it, that's the one, look.</i>

153
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,463
<i>Let me see your...</i>

154
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:35,748
<i>See? Its good.</i>

155
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:39,150
<i>Ladies, you need to keep it down in there.</i>

156
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:40,907
<i>We do have other customers.</i>

157
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:45,289
We were a lot cooler than we're making this seem.

158
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:46,312
<i>Right.</i>

159
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,736
<i>Look at my girls.</i>

160
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:52,357
<i>Oh, my God, I'll gonna fly.</i>

161
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,350
Oh, my girls, look at you.

162
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,464
You have to get on that.

163
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:00,434
Oh, my goodness!

164
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,685
<i>Why are you always pulling up my dress?</i>

165
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,045
Whether or not you have any
sort of affection inside

166
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,134
of you that you wanna give to your boyfriend.

167
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:10,456
- You don't think I have any affection?
- I mean, right now, I don't know.

168
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:18,149
<i>You gonna love me for doing that?</i>

169
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:19,273
<i>Um-hmm, why?</i>

170
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,876
Really, Sarah?

171
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,559
After everything that happened
today, you have to do this?

172
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:02,052
Do what?

173
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:03,427
Sneak out.

174
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,677
Make things so hard all the time...

175
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:10,640
Look, I just wanna get out of here
and forget this shitty day, alright?

176
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:12,407
Oh, I'm sorry, but you're not going anywhere.

177
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:16,225
Mom's not around, hasn't been for a while.

178
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:19,171
And you don't need to be her? Okay?

179
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:22,364
It's not your job, to hover over me all the time.

180
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,756
I wish I didn't have to.

181
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,726
Well, then, just don't care so much.

182
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,287
It's way easier.

183
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:35,973
- Okay, dad, here's your flight confirmation.
- Once the permits get approved

184
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:38,216
I'll be back. It might be
a few days, though. Okay?

185
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:38,988
Okay.

186
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:40,917
Nona knows I'm leaving so call
her if you need anything.

187
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:42,598
Yeah, I got it covered, dad, don't worry.

188
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:43,820
Bye.

189
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:45,753
Have a safe trip.

190
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:49,178
I'll text you when I get there.

191
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:11,667
You've class in a half hour,
how long's this gonna take?

192
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:14,497
Uh, Mrs. G. just wants to check
a few things, so, two minutes?

193
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:15,624
Sure.

194
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:19,383
Oh, and-and can you go around back
and and check the other pool cover?

195
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,611
Yeah, I got it.

196
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:32,356
Hello?

197
00:21:56,504 --> 00:21:57,886
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!

198
00:21:58,021 --> 00:21:59,426
It's me. Are you ready to go?

199
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:02,233
- I didn't ever hear you come up.
- What is that?

200
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,632
Just something Debbie and I used to do.

201
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,508
- Ages ago.
- It was a joke, right?

202
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:10,280
We pretended it was real.

203
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,160
We asked it questions, like,
do I have a secret admirer?

204
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:15,825
Will we be friends forever? Things like that.

205
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:18,800
One of you just pushing it?

206
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,345
Yeah.

207
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,139
I didn't know she had one.

208
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:27,796
I have so many questions.

209
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:32,220
If I had just stayed, I was right here
if I hadn't of left her, you know?

210
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:33,245
Laine...

211
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:35,980
it's not your fault.

212
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:39,124
You just don't know when it's gonna be the
last time you get to talk to someone.

213
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,747
We never even got to say goodbye.

214
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:48,872
I know.

215
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:08,006
Pete.

216
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:10,023
- Hey.
- Hi.

217
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:11,753
Can you talk?

218
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:13,656
Yeah, sure.

219
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:15,206
Okay.

220
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:19,228
I haven't gotten a chance
to check in with you, yet.

221
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:20,869
You doin' okay?

222
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,175
I guess.

223
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,616
I can't bring myself to erase her voicemails.

224
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:28,178
I keep listening to them and
it's like she's here, you know?

225
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:30,707
Leaving me messages, making plans.

226
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,420
Before Debbie died...

227
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,716
did you notice anything going on with her?

228
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,319
Like what?

229
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:39,627
Acting different?

230
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,416
Yeah, she seemed worried about something.

231
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,275
Did she ever say what it was?

232
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:51,027
It just kinda started out of nowhere.
I didn't know what was going on.

233
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:52,852
I'd text her, she'd blow me off.

234
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,526
I thought, maybe she wanted to
break up with me or something.

235
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:59,265
A few days ago, I went to
her house to try to talk to her.

236
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:02,298
- She didn't even want me to come inside.
- She did the same thing with me.

237
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,161
Why are you asking me all this?

238
00:24:07,624 --> 00:24:09,847
I guess, I'm just not ready to let her go.

239
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:12,587
Neither am I.

240
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:21,867
I don't know.

241
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:23,788
When I'm in that house, it just feels strange.

242
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:27,507
- You miss Debbie, I mean, we all do.
- No, this-this is different.

243
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,147
I can't explain it, it-it's like she's there.

244
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:32,647
Lainey, listen, everyone's still in shock, okay?

245
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:36,462
But those things you were telling me
the other day, about feeling guilty...

246
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:38,859
You don't have to keep doing this to yourself.

247
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:42,817
You ever feel like, even after
someone you love has died,

248
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,702
there's still a way you can talk to them?

249
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:46,617
But you can't do that, she's gone.

250
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,631
The board, isn't that what
you're supposed to do with it?

251
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,996
But, yesterday you said it was just a game.

252
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,745
If we play the game and nothing happens,
then I'll never bring it up again.

253
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,001
But I really want to try, so...
will you guys just do this with me?

254
00:25:24,743 --> 00:25:25,827
Sarah?

255
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,103
I'm heading out. I'll be an hour.

256
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:30,929
Sarah!

257
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,520
Yeah?

258
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:36,504
- I'm going out. I'll be back in a bit.
- Hour. Yeah, cool, got it.

259
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,148
Hey, get outta here!

260
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:52,589
What the hell, Laine?

261
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:54,649
For a minute, there, I actually
had a little faith in you.

262
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:56,491
We hang out! What's wrong with that?

263
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:57,888
What's wrong with that, is that you're a kid

264
00:25:57,912 --> 00:25:59,273
and that guy is too old for you.

265
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:02,249
Alright, since you can't be left
alone, you're coming with me.

266
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:04,924
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Bring your stuff. I'll be in the car.

267
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:44,091
I don't wanna be in this house. Feels wrong.

268
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,933
Well, this is where Debbie died.

269
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:50,585
We have to play here.

270
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:53,462
It's okay.

271
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:56,228
We're all together.

272
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,425
So where are we gonna do this?

273
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:08,376
In there.

274
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,409
I'm gonna go and get the board.

275
00:27:24,838 --> 00:27:28,346
How are you even supposed to talk
to someone using a board game?

276
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,799
I mean, yo, can you hear me?

277
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:35,084
Signal's real bad, I only got, like, one bar in here.

278
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:39,521
Your sister wants to do this,
so just zip it and go along.

279
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,839
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus.

280
00:27:56,862 --> 00:27:58,312
- Pete.
- It's okay.

281
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:00,723
Just me, I heard you coming through the front.

282
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,057
What the hell are you doing, man?

283
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:05,524
I have a spare key for the back.
I come in that way all the time.

284
00:28:25,132 --> 00:28:26,600
- So let's play.
- Wait.

285
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:28,950
There's a few rules, first.

286
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,768
Like: You're never supposed
to play in a graveyard.

287
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:35,355
Never play alone and always say goodbye.

288
00:28:35,532 --> 00:28:37,342
Can we just do this?

289
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:43,612
I don't even think I believe in these things.

290
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:48,357
- But, I still don't wanna touch it.
- Come on, it's only toy stories.

291
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:58,802
Circle the board.

292
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:00,948
Once for each of us.

293
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:12,173
And then you say these words:

294
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:19,728
As friends we've gathered, hearts are true.

295
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:21,741
Spirits near, we call to you.

296
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:26,717
If there's a presence here,
please make yourself known.

297
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:32,362
Is there a presence here among us?

298
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:43,895
This is a joke.

299
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,818
Come on, you guys, who's doing that?

300
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:54,795
- Sarah, cut it out!
- I'm not pushing it.

301
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,928
Is there something you wanna tell us?

302
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,179
<i>H...</i>

303
00:30:12,248 --> 00:30:13,250
<i>I...</i>

304
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:23,980
Spelled, hi friend.

305
00:30:25,878 --> 00:30:27,283
Hi, friend.

306
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:32,980
When I was here yesterday, was that you?

307
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:38,261
Who is this?

308
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,284
Debbie.

309
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:56,543
Sarah, if that's you, pretending to be
Debbie, then that's really messed up.

310
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:58,799
- I swear, it's not me, alright?
- Hey, this is freaking me out.

311
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,093
Let's just stop it, now.

312
00:31:00,128 --> 00:31:02,602
I'm sorry, Iz, just-just put
your hand back, please.

313
00:31:11,595 --> 00:31:12,845
Debbie...

314
00:31:15,013 --> 00:31:16,806
was there something I could have done?

315
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,438
Was there some way we could have helped you?

316
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,896
If there's anything you want to tell us,

317
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:26,196
about what you did,

318
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,435
if you did this to yourself.

319
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:32,692
Did you really do this?

320
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,013
Guys...

321
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:46,024
Calm down. It's an old house.

322
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:49,333
Laine, keep going.

323
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,517
- Debbie, I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

324
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:56,663
We all do.

325
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,957
If you can hear us, we just...

326
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:02,611
I don't know, we just wanted
a chance to say goodbye.

327
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:27,709
Laine.

328
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:30,760
Iz, it's not even real, okay?

329
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:32,429
It's just a game.

330
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,089
It's all the lights. They're all out.

331
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:25,105
Let's be honest...

332
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,078
- was it you moving the planchette?
- No.

333
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:29,962
- You?
- No!

334
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:31,102
No way.

335
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:33,594
For all we know, it was Laine.

336
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:36,947
Maybe it was really something she needed.

337
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:40,221
Might not have even known she was doing it.

338
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:01,351
Is it Debbie, did she do this?

339
00:34:07,017 --> 00:34:09,675
- Where are you going?
- Just a second.

340
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:38,487
- Debbie, is that you?
- Laine, Laine, please, stop.

341
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,927
Okay? It's not her.

342
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:42,192
What if it is? What if she's
trying to tell me something?

343
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:57,282
Oh, my God.

344
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:00,524
- What happened, are you okay?
- What was that?

345
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:04,098
I saw a reflection in the mirror and then
someone pushed me from behind.

346
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:06,395
Can we just get out of here, please!

347
00:35:06,602 --> 00:35:07,863
Come on.

348
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:30,825
- Why you bringing that home?
- It was hers, I want it here.

349
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:34,225
What?

350
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:37,057
It's just... that you need to
believe that was really Debbie.

351
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:38,357
You were there.

352
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,319
It was weird, right?

353
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:42,613
Yeah, it was weird.

354
00:35:43,637 --> 00:35:45,566
But I don't know if it means anything.

355
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:48,191
But, what if it's her? What if
she wants to tell me something?

356
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,751
You wanted us to play, we did,
and now we can leave it alone.

357
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,344
Laine, you said goodbye to her.

358
00:35:57,896 --> 00:36:00,298
I know you'll find the moment
when you're ready, but...

359
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,904
I think you can start to move on.

360
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:07,479
- Good night.
- 'Night.

361
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:58,759
I couldn't sleep last night.

362
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,735
We don't have to talk about it.

363
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:04,616
Had all these weird dreams. Keep
thinking about being in her house.

364
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,160
Iz, I know you didn't wanna be there.

365
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,789
You did it for me...

366
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,186
So thank you. I owe you.

367
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:15,823
Let's just forget the whole deal.

368
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:16,848
Yeah?

369
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:18,762
Yeah, okay.

370
00:37:46,773 --> 00:37:48,126
Nona, what are you doing?

371
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,229
You should never touch these things.

372
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:52,056
You used it, didn't you?

373
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:54,240
I-it was just once.

374
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,787
Promise me Laine, do not go
seeking answers from the dead.

375
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:02,252
- Get rid of the board.
- Yeah, I will. I promise, Nona.

376
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:05,503
Who is that?

377
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,483
- Goodnight, Hank, see you tomorrow.
- Uh, huh.

378
00:40:18,037 --> 00:40:20,501
Oh, hey, can you grab the
garbage on your way out?

379
00:40:20,937 --> 00:40:22,077
Thank you.

380
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:29,185
Hi, Isabelle.

381
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,744
Where?

382
00:41:33,872 --> 00:41:35,730
No, no, it doesn't sound crazy at all.

383
00:41:36,748 --> 00:41:39,124
I'll pick you up. I'll be there in a few minutes.

384
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:47,146
<i>This idea of messages from the board,</i>

385
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:49,380
<i>is nothing more than our unconscious minds.</i>

386
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,846
<i>It's known as the ideomotor effect,</i>

387
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:54,050
<i>involuntary motor muscles kick in,</i>

388
00:41:54,073 --> 00:41:56,137
<i>which drive the movement of the planchette.</i>

389
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,934
<i>We're simply telling ourselves
what we wanna believe.</i>

390
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:19,916
Sarah?

391
00:42:27,707 --> 00:42:29,619
- Was that you?
- I thought it was you.

392
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:34,191
Dad, you home?

393
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,499
Dad!

394
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:39,302
Go, get...

395
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:01,420
Do you have your phone?

396
00:43:01,444 --> 00:43:02,674
- No.
- No?

397
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:03,956
Shit.

398
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,024
Okay, just be quiet. Just be quiet.

399
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:21,812
Sarah, stay back, okay?

400
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:52,843
Isabelle was shaking when I
picked her up last night.

401
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:56,461
I called this morning to check in. She
doesn't even wanna leave the house.

402
00:43:57,285 --> 00:43:58,433
And I saw it, too.

403
00:43:58,818 --> 00:44:01,742
"Hi friend". Carved right into my desk.

404
00:44:02,277 --> 00:44:03,551
Did we all see it?

405
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:08,721
Debbie's trying to reach us.

406
00:44:09,702 --> 00:44:12,615
- What could she want?
- If we wanna know...

407
00:44:13,244 --> 00:44:14,666
We gotta ask her.

408
00:44:27,568 --> 00:44:29,492
I think we should say the words together.

409
00:44:32,661 --> 00:44:35,765
As friends we've gathered, hearts are true.

410
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:38,529
Spirits near, we call to you.

411
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,992
If there's a presence here, make yourself known.

412
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:56,221
Debbie, we're all here for you.

413
00:44:56,244 --> 00:44:58,204
We all got your messages, we're here.

414
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:11,983
Can you show us a sign?

415
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:14,633
Are you here?

416
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:42,129
Come on, guys.

417
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:54,242
You didn't kill yourself, did you?

418
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,084
I knew it.

419
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:04,054
Debbie, if you didn't do this, who did?

420
00:46:05,246 --> 00:46:07,898
Did someone hurt you, did-did someone...?

421
00:46:10,172 --> 00:46:11,204
Who did it?

422
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:12,941
Who hurt you?

423
00:46:17,622 --> 00:46:19,536
Debbie, why won't you answer us?

424
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:25,913
I have a question.

425
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:32,273
On our first real date, away from everybody else.

426
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:35,712
We told everybody we went to the fair.

427
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:37,918
But where did we really go?

428
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:44,572
We went to the lookout.

429
00:46:46,415 --> 00:46:48,422
By the point, in the canyon.

430
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:54,173
Do you remember that? What I said to you?

431
00:47:01,707 --> 00:47:03,400
This isn't Debbie.

432
00:47:03,424 --> 00:47:08,275
- What do you mean?
- I never took her there, not once.

433
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:10,309
This is you, Debbie?

434
00:47:13,457 --> 00:47:15,320
Then who the hell is this?

435
00:47:17,383 --> 00:47:18,626
<i>D.</i>

436
00:47:22,528 --> 00:47:23,529
<i>Z.</i>

437
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,279
Is this who we were talking to the other night?

438
00:47:32,575 --> 00:47:33,581
Oh, my God!

439
00:47:33,605 --> 00:47:35,475
Were we ever talking to Debbie?

440
00:47:38,124 --> 00:47:40,302
Laine, we can stop.

441
00:47:40,326 --> 00:47:43,198
When Debbie played the Ouija,
did she made contacted you?

442
00:47:46,758 --> 00:47:48,214
D.Z., where are you?

443
00:47:51,575 --> 00:47:53,003
At the chair.

444
00:48:17,601 --> 00:48:18,601
I don't see anything.

445
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:22,117
Guys, I think we should get out of here.

446
00:48:26,293 --> 00:48:27,293
Run?

447
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:32,827
She's coming.

448
00:48:32,851 --> 00:48:33,930
Who! Who's coming?

449
00:48:37,454 --> 00:48:38,480
Mother.

450
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:04,412
- Sarah, wait.
- What happened in there, Laine?

451
00:49:04,436 --> 00:49:06,435
Doesn't matter because we're not playing any more.

452
00:49:06,578 --> 00:49:07,579
Okay?

453
00:49:07,585 --> 00:49:09,797
We're walking away from
the board, the whole thing.

454
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,029
Debbie played, and now she's dead.

455
00:49:12,102 --> 00:49:16,022
Look, w-what if we made the same mistake?
What if we broke some sort of rule?

456
00:49:18,177 --> 00:49:20,235
Hey. Hey.

457
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,118
We're finished with this, okay?

458
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:37,047
<i>Operation Clean House.</i>

459
00:50:38,052 --> 00:50:40,083
<i>I get to clean...</i>

460
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:42,697
<i>the attic.</i>

461
00:50:42,726 --> 00:50:44,123
God.

462
00:50:45,172 --> 00:50:46,255
Right.

463
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:48,133
Attic done, I did the best I could.

464
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:52,091
Oh, my God, that was not fun.

465
00:50:52,438 --> 00:50:55,338
However, I did find something.

466
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:58,174
<i>Along with a lot of old junk
from the previous owners.</i>

467
00:50:59,964 --> 00:51:01,937
<i>Ta-da, it's cool, right?</i>

468
00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:03,338
Oh!

469
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:06,730
They go together.

470
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:08,329
She found it in her house.

471
00:51:09,089 --> 00:51:10,822
Do I like my find?

472
00:51:12,024 --> 00:51:13,224
Oooh!

473
00:51:15,445 --> 00:51:16,445
Yes.

474
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,729
Am I cleaning the attic, again? No!

475
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,092
<i>So answer my question, I'm waiting.</i>

476
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,593
<i>R.</i>

477
00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:36,628
She played alone?

478
00:51:45,641 --> 00:51:48,909
<i>H-I-F-R-I-E-N-D. Whoa!</i>

479
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:51,829
 Hi friend.

480
00:53:35,252 --> 00:53:38,733
As you know, our community has been
devastated, the last few weeks.

481
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,853
First, with Debbie and now, Isabelle.

482
00:53:44,894 --> 00:53:46,614
I wanted to talk to each of you, because...

483
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:49,720
I just want to make sure you
and your friends are okay.

484
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,056
When you lose someone close to you...

485
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,994
there's always help available.

486
00:53:54,218 --> 00:53:55,747
We care about you.

487
00:53:56,552 --> 00:53:57,744
Now, um...

488
00:53:58,294 --> 00:54:02,321
there's a lot of very, very helpful
information in here, about...

489
00:54:02,545 --> 00:54:04,883
dealing with loss, and moving forward.

490
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:07,436
You have no idea what you're talking about.

491
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:10,997
Laine, w-we're only trying to help you.

492
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:12,046
You can't.

493
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:14,348
I'm not even sure who can.

494
00:54:15,978 --> 00:54:16,978
Trevor.

495
00:54:17,961 --> 00:54:20,044
We need to talk, all of us.

496
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:25,693
You made us play. Now Isabelle's dead.

497
00:54:25,753 --> 00:54:27,728
I know, and I'll never forgive myself.

498
00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:29,484
This thing...

499
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:31,334
is haunting us.

500
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,187
Wherever we go...

501
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:35,270
watching everything we do.

502
00:54:35,294 --> 00:54:37,055
It's coming for all of us.

503
00:54:37,378 --> 00:54:38,675
So who's next?

504
00:54:43,896 --> 00:54:46,736
Hey, look, back there, with Trevor.

505
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,226
- He's right.
- Pete, I need you.

506
00:54:48,921 --> 00:54:50,357
It's just us, now.

507
00:54:50,979 --> 00:54:53,182
What does this spirit wanna do with us?

508
00:54:53,306 --> 00:54:55,729
It's angry. When Debbie played...

509
00:54:55,753 --> 00:54:57,264
she woke up something up in her house.

510
00:54:57,899 --> 00:54:58,959
Okay?

511
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:02,264
Pete, please, I need your help.

512
00:55:51,505 --> 00:55:53,441
I think that's where Debbie found it.

513
00:57:57,901 --> 00:57:59,067
Laine, you alright?

514
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:03,483
- Laine.
- I'm coming!

515
00:58:13,065 --> 00:58:14,102
Pete.

516
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:17,196
Pete, grab this.

517
00:58:20,128 --> 00:58:21,142
It's heavy.

518
00:58:21,266 --> 00:58:22,410
Okay.

519
00:58:57,619 --> 00:58:58,691
Laine!

520
00:59:09,687 --> 00:59:11,541
Hey, this is the family.

521
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:14,495
For some reason, they're still
connected to the house.

522
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:18,465
From the look of these photos, I'd
say this is the late '40s, the early '50s.

523
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:20,250
Is there a way to get any records?

524
00:59:20,251 --> 00:59:22,663
I don't know, property archives or something?

525
00:59:23,145 --> 00:59:24,232
I can try.

526
00:59:24,745 --> 00:59:26,457
We need to find out who they are.

527
00:59:41,763 --> 00:59:43,512
Laine, you should come look at this.

528
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:50,310
I found this old article.

529
00:59:52,946 --> 00:59:54,487
Doris Zander.

530
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,379
D.Z., D.Z., this is-this is her.

531
01:00:00,743 --> 01:00:01,742
Pete, what's that.

532
01:00:01,743 --> 01:00:02,819
Doris Zander.

533
01:00:03,662 --> 01:00:06,357
She used to live in Debbie's
house, with her mother.

534
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:07,939
D.Z. was a missing girl.

535
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,560
They never found her.

536
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,340
They suspected the mother had something
to do with her disappearance.

537
01:00:16,564 --> 01:00:19,299
So who is the other girl
in the pictures with them?

538
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:24,201
Doris had a sister.

539
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:26,756
She might still be alive.

540
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:40,596
<i>May I help you?</i>

541
01:00:41,357 --> 01:00:43,121
I'm here for visiting hours.

542
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:08,178
Thank you.

543
01:01:11,191 --> 01:01:13,551
They told me my niece was here to visit.

544
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:15,566
I don't have a niece.

545
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,404
My name is Laine.

546
01:01:17,648 --> 01:01:20,192
I'm here to ask about your sister, Doris.

547
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,010
Oh, Doris.

548
01:01:23,033 --> 01:01:26,539
My best friend, Debbie, lived in you old house.

549
01:01:28,516 --> 01:01:30,011
She's not alive any more.

550
01:01:32,933 --> 01:01:35,349
And this gonna sound really strange, but...

551
01:01:36,108 --> 01:01:37,285
But...

552
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:38,555
I think I know why.

553
01:01:39,816 --> 01:01:42,138
I believe there's a presence in that house.

554
01:01:43,274 --> 01:01:46,453
I wouldn't be surprised if there's more than one.

555
01:01:48,441 --> 01:01:50,570
I found pictures of you and your sister..

556
01:01:51,984 --> 01:01:53,406
You found pictures?

557
01:01:53,725 --> 01:01:55,413
You found my family photos?

558
01:01:55,448 --> 01:01:58,124
Yeah, I can bring them to you,
or send them, if you like.

559
01:01:58,149 --> 01:01:59,159
Please bring them.

560
01:02:00,024 --> 01:02:04,467
I haven't seen my sister's
face... in a very long time.

561
01:02:06,142 --> 01:02:07,954
At least, not her real face.

562
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:17,050
I believe I saw her, me and
my friends, and her lips....

563
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:19,197
they were stitched shut.

564
01:02:21,609 --> 01:02:23,497
Mother did that to her.

565
01:02:34,644 --> 01:02:36,856
My mother practiced mediumship.

566
01:02:37,418 --> 01:02:39,392
And if practice makes perfect, let me tell you,

567
01:02:39,459 --> 01:02:42,339
she was pretty damn good,
depending on your point of view.

568
01:02:42,986 --> 01:02:47,082
She conducted seances, she
used spirit boards, anything.

569
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:49,146
A bit reckless, actually.

570
01:02:49,271 --> 01:02:52,451
Doris loved my mother. She wanted to help.

571
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:55,213
She was fascinated by it all.

572
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,281
And when the seances got bigger and

573
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,684
my mother really made connections...

574
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:04,357
she needed a vessel, a
vessel to give them a voice.

575
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,381
Who?

576
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:06,974
The spirits.

577
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:09,858
She used Doris.

578
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:14,743
And then something went wrong with mother.

579
01:03:14,767 --> 01:03:18,384
Chasing the dead and living in all
those shadows, something snapped.

580
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:21,117
She couldn't turn it off, she
couldnt break the connection.

581
01:03:22,487 --> 01:03:24,460
Mother was consumed by them.

582
01:03:25,611 --> 01:03:26,950
She was insane.

583
01:03:29,487 --> 01:03:31,241
So she did that to Doris.

584
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:33,824
To her lips.

585
01:03:34,486 --> 01:03:36,408
To stop them from talking.

586
01:03:36,433 --> 01:03:37,914
And then Doris went missing.

587
01:03:40,354 --> 01:03:41,515
Missing.

588
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:46,688
She never left the house, did she?

589
01:03:46,744 --> 01:03:47,744
No.

590
01:03:47,768 --> 01:03:49,120
No, she didn't.

591
01:03:50,902 --> 01:03:52,816
Mother wasn't herself.

592
01:03:53,437 --> 01:03:54,993
She killed Doris.

593
01:03:55,862 --> 01:03:59,511
And after that, I did what I
needed to do to stop mother.

594
01:04:02,695 --> 01:04:03,986
That's why I'm here.

595
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:07,753
But that doesn't mean mother is gone.

596
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:16,386
- How did you see her?
- What?

597
01:04:16,821 --> 01:04:18,468
You said you saw her.

598
01:04:19,504 --> 01:04:22,288
You said you saw her lips.
How did you see her?

599
01:04:22,312 --> 01:04:24,936
You wouldn't have been able
to see her, not unless...

600
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,475
Look, I just wanna stop whatever it is
that is happening, my friends are dying.

601
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:32,859
No, no, you, you-you opened up a
channel, you-you made a connection.

602
01:04:32,883 --> 01:04:33,999
With what?

603
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,959
- A spirit board, I bet?
- Yeah.

604
01:04:39,113 --> 01:04:42,833
You played in a graveyard.
And now she's awake, again.

605
01:04:42,856 --> 01:04:43,625
Uh, um.

606
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:44,811
Mother, too.

607
01:04:45,404 --> 01:04:48,567
- And if you could see them...
- Just through the planchette.

608
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:49,591
Not for long.

609
01:04:50,072 --> 01:04:51,825
They're getting stronger.

610
01:04:52,573 --> 01:04:57,107
The points of connection, in your
case, it's the body and the board.

611
01:04:57,132 --> 01:05:00,977
The link is between them. The energy is growing.

612
01:05:01,613 --> 01:05:04,358
And it is hard to stop.

613
01:05:07,281 --> 01:05:09,246
<i>Mother used to have a secret room.</i>

614
01:05:09,671 --> 01:05:12,873
<i>She sealed it up, after
Doris, down in the basement.</i>

615
01:05:13,656 --> 01:05:17,193
<i>Don't go alone. Mother will try to stop you.</i>

616
01:05:17,216 --> 01:05:18,218
<i>What do I have to do?</i>

617
01:05:18,795 --> 01:05:21,255
<i>You need to cut the stitches from her mouth.</i>

618
01:05:21,378 --> 01:05:22,917
<i>And if it works...</i>

619
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:26,356
<i>you have to pray that Doris can deal with mother.</i>

620
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,064
Supposed to be somewhere, here.

621
01:05:30,088 --> 01:05:31,191
Pete, grab this.

622
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:40,435
This is crazy, Laine.

623
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,283
We should just leave, we shouldn't be here.

624
01:05:47,915 --> 01:05:48,915
What?

625
01:05:49,448 --> 01:05:50,814
The shadow.

626
01:05:56,241 --> 01:05:57,241
Trevor!

627
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:01,991
Trevor.

628
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:06,499
Pete.

629
01:06:06,585 --> 01:06:08,213
Trevor, Pete!

630
01:06:13,924 --> 01:06:14,924
Laine.

631
01:06:15,324 --> 01:06:16,483
Keep going.

632
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:18,934
Trevor, I need your help.

633
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,329
- Laine!
- Stay there, I found her.

634
01:07:55,722 --> 01:07:58,017
No, no, no, not now.

635
01:07:58,419 --> 01:08:00,653
Come on. Stop. Come on!

636
01:08:13,286 --> 01:08:14,483
Come on.

637
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:45,136
No.

638
01:09:21,154 --> 01:09:23,203
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

639
01:09:24,044 --> 01:09:25,307
Where's Laine?

640
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:22,913
<i>Okay, so our feature sells... I hope
we look back on this and... um...</i>

641
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:24,386
<i>No, it's so good.</i>

642
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:26,241
<i>Okay, turn around, what does
it look like in the back?</i>

643
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,223
<i>Hold on, let me see.</i>

644
01:10:28,331 --> 01:10:30,629
<i>- You look so beautiful.
- I know.</i>

645
01:10:30,674 --> 01:10:33,141
<i>- Thanks..
- Oh, my babies, look at my angels.</i>

646
01:10:39,624 --> 01:10:41,152
I miss you, Debbie...

647
01:10:41,306 --> 01:10:42,566
all the time.

648
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,499
Debbie?

649
01:12:06,543 --> 01:12:09,513
<i>Call me ASAP. Something happened to Pete.</i>

650
01:12:19,952 --> 01:12:21,207
Ms. Zander.

651
01:12:22,127 --> 01:12:24,602
My tenacious little niece.

652
01:12:24,627 --> 01:12:26,145
I did everything you said.

653
01:12:26,369 --> 01:12:29,388
We found the body, I cut the
stitches, she sent mother away,

654
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:31,393
but it didn't work, why didn't it work?

655
01:12:32,544 --> 01:12:35,793
Mother must have come back, because my
friend Pete, another friend, is dead.

656
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:42,895
She's free.

657
01:12:43,877 --> 01:12:45,376
You lied to me.

658
01:12:49,978 --> 01:12:53,573
Your mother didn't try to hurt us.
She tried to stop us.

659
01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:58,150
Your mother wasn't the one that was evil.

660
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,233
- It was...
- I told her...

661
01:13:00,257 --> 01:13:02,150
that I would help her.

662
01:13:04,962 --> 01:13:06,820
I heard the voices, too.

663
01:13:07,718 --> 01:13:09,013
They tell you...

664
01:13:09,311 --> 01:13:13,562
the most wonderful... awful things.

665
01:13:15,594 --> 01:13:19,001
You're gonna hear them too, little girl.

666
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:25,221
You'll hear them soon enough, because
she's coming to get you, too.

667
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:28,134
I always told her, because... I told her.
I always told her.

668
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:30,550
She's gonna be nice to me.

669
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:32,301
I was gonna help her.

670
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,465
And now, she's gonna be nice to me.

671
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:36,647
She's gonna keep her promises.

672
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:39,536
She's gonna keep her promises.

673
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,068
No! No!

674
01:13:43,812 --> 01:13:45,617
You have to break the connection,

675
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,084
or it will keep coming back for you.

676
01:13:48,295 --> 01:13:50,969
- I'll burn the board.
- That won't be enough.

677
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,211
A spirit this strong could bring it back.

678
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:57,150
<i>A connection, once made, to a
spirit, is very difficult to break.</i>

679
01:13:57,174 --> 01:13:59,327
The board is just the conduit.

680
01:13:59,587 --> 01:14:02,300
You have to sever the connection on both sides.

681
01:14:02,324 --> 01:14:03,949
- How?
- Your connection...

682
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:06,389
is through the board and that little girl's body.

683
01:14:06,612 --> 01:14:10,097
The spirit lives through both of them,
so you must destroy them both.

684
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:12,368
- What? Destroy the body?
- And the board.

685
01:14:12,392 --> 01:14:13,769
And you must hurry.

686
01:14:13,993 --> 01:14:15,136
I'll call Trevor.

687
01:14:15,361 --> 01:14:16,621
Thank you.

688
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:35,907
- Trevor?
- Sarah?

689
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:36,992
We're back here.

690
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:39,373
Wait up.

691
01:14:56,106 --> 01:14:57,106
Sarah?

692
01:15:00,715 --> 01:15:02,020
Laine?

693
01:15:25,757 --> 01:15:27,182
Trevor's already here.

694
01:15:35,007 --> 01:15:36,076
Trevor?

695
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:41,416
Where is he?

696
01:16:31,542 --> 01:16:32,543
Trevor?

697
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:44,232
No!

698
01:16:59,318 --> 01:17:00,639
Laine, what do we do?

699
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:03,969
Laine!

700
01:17:06,419 --> 01:17:07,419
Go get the board.

701
01:17:30,336 --> 01:17:33,050
- I need the body, too.
- Let's burn this damn thing... alright?

702
01:17:35,552 --> 01:17:37,589
- Laine!
- Sarah!

703
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:39,870
Sarah!

704
01:18:08,515 --> 01:18:09,515
Hey!

705
01:18:18,612 --> 01:18:21,372
As friends we've gathered, hearts are true.

706
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,406
Spirits near, we call to you.

707
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:27,025
Doris, I'm playing alone, you have to play.

708
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:46,842
Hey.

709
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,859
- Feeling any better?
- Yeah.

710
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:52,002
Yeah, I-I guess so.

711
01:20:52,526 --> 01:20:53,526
I just...

712
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,262
I miss them... all the time...

713
01:20:57,086 --> 01:20:58,554
Yeah, me, too.

714
01:21:00,084 --> 01:21:02,523
I guess you never really feel
like you could say goodbye.

715
01:21:02,548 --> 01:21:03,679
<i>Hmmm...</i>

716
01:21:04,451 --> 01:21:05,451
Maybe that's okay.

717
01:21:07,545 --> 01:21:08,982
Maybe there are no "goodbyes".

718
01:21:10,576 --> 01:21:12,013
Not really.

719
01:21:18,143 --> 01:21:20,339
I keep wondering about that night.

720
01:21:22,676 --> 01:21:24,156
That poor little girl.

721
01:21:27,184 --> 01:21:30,635
All of those dark spirits that were in her.

722
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:34,183
Where do you think they went?
