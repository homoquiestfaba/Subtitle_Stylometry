1
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,029
Professor !

2
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,229
Catherine !

3
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,229
Professor...

4
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,586
We found something beautiful !

5
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,109
l don't believe it !

6
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,345
Big, big, big surprise !

7
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,949
Over here !

8
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,389
Taylor !

9
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,063
Dr Langford, hello.

10
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,101
What have we here ?

11
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,229
Cover stones.

12
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,147
lt's fantastic.

13
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,707
Caterina, come !

14
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,425
What in God's name is that ?

15
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,665
l wish l knew.

16
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,663
There are symbols
painted everywhere.

17
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,782
Names, titles of owners,
lists of oferings.

18
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,786
All major structures at the time...

19
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,185
..were covered with hieroglyphics.

20
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,949
When will
the academic community accept...

21
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,106
..the pharaohs of the 4th dynasty...

22
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,301
..did not build the Great Pyramid ?

23
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,226
Look, look...

24
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,899
lnside the most incredible
structure ever erected...

25
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,783
..there are no writings whatsoever.

26
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,945
Doctor Jackson !

27
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,550
You left out the fact
that Colonel Vyse...

28
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,702
..discovered
quarrymen's inscriptions...

29
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,469
..of Khufu's name
within the pyramid.

30
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,502
Uh, his discovery was a fraud.

31
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,381
Well, l hope you can prove it.

32
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,580
Who do you think
built the pyramids ?

33
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,025
l don't have any idea. l mean...

34
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,264
Men from Atlantis ?

35
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,948
Or Martians, perhaps ?

36
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,068
The point is not who built them,
but when they were built.

37
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,822
l mean, we all know...

38
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,748
..new geological evidence
dates the Sphinx...

39
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,860
..back to a much earlier period.

40
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,822
l think we have
to begin to re-evaluate...

41
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,101
..everything
we've come to accept about...

42
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,584
l mean, l've been able to show...

43
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,586
..a fully developed
writing system...

44
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,943
..appeared
in the first two dynasties.

45
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,582
You know, which...

46
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,098
Almost as if it was based...

47
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,186
..on an even earlier prototype.

48
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,028
ls there a lunch or something
that everybody...

49
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,938
- Doctor Jackson ?
- What ? Yes ?

50
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,106
Someone wants to speak with you.

51
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,508
The Air Force ?
What's this ? What is this ?

52
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,620
Step over to the car, please.

53
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,419
Sir ?

54
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,550
- We goin' somewhere ?
- You'll be fine.

55
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,581
We'll take care of these.

56
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,459
Jackson,...

57
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,341
..those your parents ?

58
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,822
Foster parents.

59
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,705
What is this all about ?

60
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,229
A job.

61
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,306
What kind of a job ?

62
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,939
Translation.
Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

63
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,788
lnterested ?

64
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,427
l'm gonna go now.

65
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,827
Go where ? You've just been evicted
from your apartment.

66
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,020
Your grants have run out.

67
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,460
Everything you own
are in those two bags.

68
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,621
You want to prove
that your theories are right ?

69
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,666
This is your chance.

70
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,183
What's this ?

71
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,868
Travel plans.

72
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,459
Sir ?

73
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,826
Mrs O'Neil ?

74
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,222
Come on in.

75
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,066
Mrs O'Neil, is your husband home ?

76
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,229
Yes.

77
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,026
Might we be able to speak with him ?

78
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,101
You can try.

79
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,100
Excuse me, Colonel O'Neil.
We're from General West's ofice.

80
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,459
Sir ?

81
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,782
We're here to inform you
that you've been reactivated.

82
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,221
That guy's a mess.

83
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,946
How'd he get like that ?

84
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,426
His kid died.
Accidentally shot himself.

85
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,869
Jesus !

86
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,624
''Clear.''

87
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,424
Cold ?

88
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,301
Allergies.

89
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,900
Always happens when l travel.

90
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,428
There you go.

91
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,819
Hi.

92
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,341
Doctor Jackson ?
Doctor Gary Meyers. How are you ?

93
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,789
What is this place ?

94
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,628
Nuclear missile silo.
But it's been converted.

95
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,262
- Barbara Shore.
- Hello.

96
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,229
Okay, Jackson.

97
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,385
- Welcome.
- Hello !

98
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,109
This...

99
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,341
Where'd you find this ?

100
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,826
Giza Plateau, 1928.

101
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,065
l've never seen anything like this.

102
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,702
Of course you haven't.

103
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,342
No-one has.

104
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,028
There's two lines of hieroglyphs.

105
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,106
The inner track
has the classic figures.

106
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,301
But the outer track is like
the cartouche in the centre.

107
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,784
lt's got writing
unlike we've ever found before.

108
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,343
Those aren't hieroglyphics.

109
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,099
lt might be some form
of hieratic or maybe cuneiform.

110
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,823
The translation
of the inner track is wrong.

111
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,180
Must've used Budge. l don't know
why they keep reprinting him.

112
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,221
Excuse me ?
What... what are you doing ?

113
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,340
We... we've used
every known technique.

114
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,460
That's a curious word to use
- ''Gebbeh''.

115
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,499
Yeah.

116
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,387
Then an adverbial ''sedjem-en-ef''.

117
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,461
Then ''sealed''...

118
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,938
..and ''buried''.

119
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,823
Excuse me.
What are you... what are you doing ?

120
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,861
lt's not ''cofin''.

121
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,981
lt's ''for all time''.

122
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,541
Who the hell translated this ?

123
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,941
l... l did.

124
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,060
lt should read
''A million years into the sky...

125
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,466
..is Ra, sun god,
sealed and buried for all time''.

126
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,421
lt's not ''door to heaven''.

127
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,903
lt is...

128
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,103
..''Stargate''.

129
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,144
So why is the military
so interested...

130
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,499
..in 5,000-year-old
Egyptian tablets ?

131
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,586
My report says 10,000.

132
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,348
Afternoon, Colonel.

133
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,301
Um... do l know you ?

134
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,625
Col. Jack O'Neil
from General West's ofice.

135
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,706
l'll be taking over from now on.

136
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,621
This figure of 10,000 is ludicrous.

137
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,706
Egyptian culture
didn't exist until...

138
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,265
We know. But the sonic and
radiocarbon tests are conclusive.

139
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,029
These are cover stones.
Was there a tomb underneath ?

140
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,540
No, no, no, no. But we found
something a lot more interesting.

141
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,818
Excuse me.

142
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,145
This information
has become classified.

143
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,264
From now on,
no information is to be passed on...

144
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,701
..to non-military personnel
without my express permission.

145
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,747
Catherine, what's going on here ?

146
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,183
l'm not sure.

147
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,468
Colonel O'Neil ?

148
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,707
l think you owe me an explanation.

149
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,264
l was told l had complete autonomy.

150
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,426
Plans change.

151
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,702
Why are you here ? Why did they
bring you on this project ?

152
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,666
l'm here in case you succeed.

153
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,260
''Searched for cuneiform and
other pre-dynastic hieroglyphics.''

154
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,222
''No matches whatsoever.
l've exhausted all sources...

155
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,022
..in comparing
the cartouche symbols...

156
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,222
..against all writing samples
from the period, pre- and post-.''

157
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,261
''Still no similarities.''

158
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,501
''l'm never gonna get paid.''

159
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,339
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

160
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,466
Can l borrow this ?

161
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,742
Orion.

162
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,065
Hi.

163
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,829
Right here.

164
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,543
Jackson, l'd like you
to meet General West.

165
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,579
Hello.

166
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,541
Oh, right - General !

167
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,181
So you think you've solved
in 14 days...

168
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,346
..what they couldn't solve
in two years ?

169
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,584
Two years ?

170
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,149
Any time.

171
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,419
Um...

172
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,983
l have some stuf to look at.

173
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,988
Uh... if you'll just pass 'em down.

174
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,180
You'll have to share them cos l...

175
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,141
Sorry, l don't have enough of those.

176
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,624
But, anyway... Okay, all right.

177
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,230
We're looking at a picture
of the cover stones.

178
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,101
Now, on the outer track,...

179
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,664
..these figures
that you had believed...

180
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,941
..to be words to be translated
were, in fact,...

181
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,548
Sorry about that.

182
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,423
Were, in fact, star constellations.

183
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,823
These constellations
were placed in a unique order,...

184
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,259
..forming a map
or an address of sorts.

185
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,620
Seven points to outline
a course to a position.

186
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,944
And, uh,...

187
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,540
..to find the destination within
any three-dimensional space,...

188
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,418
..we need six points...

189
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,662
..to determine an exact location.

190
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,065
You said you needed seven points.

191
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,019
Well, no. Six for the destination.

192
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,345
But to chart a course you need...

193
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,786
..a point of origin.

194
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,583
Except there's only six symbols
in the cartouche.

195
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,667
The seventh actually
isn't inside the cartouche.

196
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,189
lt's below it here,...

197
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,620
..designated
by a little pyramid with...

198
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,384
..two...

199
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,302
..funny...

200
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,861
..neat little guys,...

201
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,102
..and a funny little line
coming out of the top.

202
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,389
Anyway, uh...

203
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,708
He did it.

204
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,742
No ! That symbol
isn't anywhere on the device.

205
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,861
What device ?

206
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,902
Show him.

207
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,666
What is that ?

208
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,861
lt's your ''Stargate''.

209
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,027
Come, Jackson.

210
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,302
''Technical personnel
report to command centre.''

211
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,783
Monitors up !

212
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,104
Monitors are up.

213
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,223
Mitch, bring up the details
on the centre monitor, please.

214
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,427
l've got details... on.

215
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,425
Hold it !

216
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,539
Wait.

217
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,900
Do you have a... ?

218
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,941
Oh, here. Sorry.

219
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,942
Hey, hey, hey, don't... !

220
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,343
Two figures...

221
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,346
..on either side...

222
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,339
..praying beside a pyramid
with the sun directly above it.

223
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,583
He's right.

224
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,666
lt was in front of us
the whole time.

225
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,141
General West,...

226
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,262
..Jackson has identified
the seventh symbol.

227
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,425
Go ahead.

228
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,507
Programming seventh symbol
into computer.

229
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,222
Chevron one is holding.

230
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,985
Chevron one is locked in place.

231
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,262
Power output at 23 per cent.

232
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,501
Chevron two is holding.

233
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,585
''Engage.''

234
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,825
Chevron two is locked in place.

235
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,622
We're at 35 per cent.

236
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,230
We got a condition red in the gate.

237
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,749
Evacuate all personnel.

238
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,907
Area secure. Heading back.
Seal of the door.

239
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,026
lt was under the cover stones ?

240
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,506
Yes. My father found it in 1928.

241
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,940
Made out of a mineral
unlike any found on Earth.

242
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,424
Chevron five locked in place.

243
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,222
79 per cent.

244
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,101
Chevron six is holding.

245
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,784
Chevron six is locked in place.

246
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,867
This is as far as we have
ever been able to get.

247
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,864
Chevron seven...

248
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,899
''Engage.''

249
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,783
Chevron seven is locked in place.

250
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,581
Send in the probe.

251
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,266
Let's go ! Let's go !

252
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,699
Yes, sir.

253
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,389
Record all information
from the Stargate.

254
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,421
Clear inner silo for approach.

255
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,028
''Clear inner silo.''

256
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,425
Everybody outta here !
Let's go, let's go.

257
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,989
lt's guiding itself.
Can you believe that ?

258
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,183
The beam has locked itself
onto a point somewhere...

259
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,261
..in the Kaliam galaxy.

260
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,382
lt has mass. lt could be a moon
or a large asteroid.

261
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,182
Where are we on that map ?

262
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,822
The blue dot.

263
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,149
That's right, Jackson.

264
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,346
lt's on the other side
of the known universe.

265
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,783
We're losing the signal.

266
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,747
This is the information
the probe sent back to us.

267
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,462
Freeze and enhance.

268
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,789
You can clearly see the gate
on the other side.

269
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,584
Both gates must have functioned
as a doorway between our worlds.

270
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,861
These readings tell us
it's an atmospheric match.

271
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,980
Barometric pressure, temperature...

272
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,427
..and, most importantly, oxygen.

273
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,422
These markings are diferent.

274
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,428
They don't match the symbols
on our gate.

275
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,586
That's why we may have to abort.

276
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,903
This project is for naught
without a reconnaissance mission.

277
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,383
Once on the other side...

278
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,944
..we'd have to decipher
the markings on their gate...

279
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,548
..and, in essence, dial home...

280
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,706
..in order to bring the team back.

281
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,389
Based on this new information,
l don't see how we can do that.

282
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,580
Well, l could do that.

283
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,102
Are you sure ?

284
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,069
Positive.

285
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,102
Your call.

286
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,823
You're on the team.

287
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,909
Jackson...

288
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,623
Hello. Hi.

289
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,548
l have something for you.

290
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,262
No, l...

291
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,299
Yes.

292
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,262
l found it with Stargate
when l was a child.

293
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,460
lt has brought me luck.

294
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,785
You can bring it back to me.

295
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,778
Back-up storage.

296
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,542
Reserve power on.

297
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,104
All right, we're secure.
Let's clear this area.

298
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,621
Surveillance and monitoring
equipment, reserve power,...

299
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,659
..and on.

300
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,189
lf anybody has anything to say,
now's the time to say it.

301
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,781
''Vector tracking set.''

302
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,663
Molecular deconstruction
in progress.

303
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,940
Jackson, it's all right.
lt's over. Stay with him.

304
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,026
Jackson, listen to me. Keep moving.

305
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,981
lt wears of in a minute.

306
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,100
What a rush !

307
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,020
Prepare to move out.

308
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,741
Three teams. Let's go.

309
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,781
''White team, go.''

310
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,541
Brown, Freeman, bring up the rear !

311
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,341
''Team two, move up.''

312
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,749
Clear. No contact.

313
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,867
Freeze. Hold for sounds.

314
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,301
''One-two ratio stable.''

315
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,102
Conditions are similar to inside.

316
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,141
l wanna take a look around.

317
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,829
Kawalsky. Feretti.

318
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,461
''Move up there.''

319
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,629
l knew it.

320
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,100
''Point three, three, two.''

321
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,059
Report.

322
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,580
Our quarter-mile perimeter survey
is just about complete, sir.

323
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,304
Wrap this up and
get everybody back inside.

324
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,660
l want you all back through
the Stargate within the hour.

325
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,862
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Colonel ?

326
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,741
- Sir ?
- Jackson !

327
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,746
Start working on the Stargate.

328
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,100
- What's that all about ?
- l don't know, Feretti.

329
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,186
l'm gonna need more time.

330
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,346
There's bound to be
more structures here.

331
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,824
Or some other traces
of civilisation.

332
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,658
Not this trip. Just get back
in there and re-establish contact.

333
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,747
lt's not so easy. This is a replica
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

334
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:39,180
We won't find any hieroglyphic
inscriptions or carved relief.

335
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,824
l mean,
we really need to look around more.

336
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,102
Your job is to realign the Stargate.
Can you do that or not ?

337
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,462
l can't.

338
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,546
You can't or you won't ?

339
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,581
l can decipher the symbols
on the Stargate,...

340
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,621
..but l need an order of alignment.

341
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,230
Those co-ordinates were
on tablets back on Earth.

342
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,909
There must be something
like that here and l just...

343
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,747
l just need to find it.

344
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,424
Find it ?
What do you mean, find it ?

345
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,745
You didn't say anything
about finding anything.

346
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,020
Well, l assumed the tablets
would be here.

347
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,059
You assumed ?

348
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,066
You're a lyin' son of a bitch !

349
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,147
You didn't say a word
about finding anything !

350
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,226
Kawalsky.

351
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,979
Set up a camp down here.
Organise our supplies.

352
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,423
Sir...

353
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,745
You've got your orders.

354
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,788
This is hot.

355
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,980
You know, l can't believe
we're stuck here.

356
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,180
Don't be such a doomsayer, Feretti.

357
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,460
- Yeah, give it a rest.
- Yes, please.

358
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,102
lf we're not back soon...

359
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,505
..they'll turn on the gate
from the other side.

360
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,302
Oh, no. lt doesn't work that way.

361
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,628
lf you don't turn it on from here,
we're screwed. Okay ?

362
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,901
So l'm tellin' you guys,
we're not goin' anywhere.

363
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,303
Shut up.

364
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,741
This is a nice tent.

365
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,383
Oh, we each get a tent.
That's nice.

366
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,223
What the hell is that ?

367
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,381
l got everything here but sun block.

368
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,419
Hey !

369
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,822
- Hi.
- Hey.

370
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,700
lsn't there something
you should be doing ?

371
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,547
Like gettin' us outta here ?!

372
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,501
Foot powder. Great (!)

373
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,661
Base camp is up, sir.

374
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,309
Where's Jackson ?

375
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,105
lt's okay. lt's okay.

376
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,268
Shh, shh, shh...

377
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,749
That's a good boy.

378
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,382
Good boy.

379
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,104
lt's okay.

380
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,629
Good boy.

381
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,225
What ?

382
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,306
What do you want ?

383
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,624
You want some of this ?

384
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,821
Here you go. You like that ?

385
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,661
l wouldn't feed that thing !

386
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,987
lt's got a harness !

387
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,627
lt's domesticated !

388
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,225
- Damn it !
- Let go of it !

389
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,382
Do something !

390
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,980
Help me !

391
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,707
You okay, Jackson ?

392
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,627
Kawalsky.

393
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,183
You dropped these.

394
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,219
Brown.

395
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,302
Get away from me.

396
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,979
Easy...

397
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,300
All right, Jackson.

398
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,429
You're on.

399
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,669
Me ?

400
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,549
You're the linguist.
Try to talk to 'em.

401
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,949
Hi.

402
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,781
What the hell did you say to him ?

403
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,229
Nothing.

404
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,869
Hey...

405
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,983
Hm ?

406
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,021
lt's okay.

407
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,388
lt's okay. See ?

408
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,181
''Quartz primary element.''

409
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,982
l can't make it out. lt sounds
familiar. A bit like Berber.

410
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,588
Or maybe it's Chadic or Omotic.

411
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,709
Thank you.

412
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,745
Mmmm... !

413
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,699
Bonni...

414
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,659
Bonniwae !

415
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,109
Bonniwae ?

416
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,549
Bonniwae !

417
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,143
Bonniwae. Bonniwae.

418
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,543
What's that mean ?

419
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,581
l have no idea.

420
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,625
He's inviting us to go with him.

421
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,661
How can you be so sure ?

422
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,863
Because he's inviting us
to go with him.

423
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,580
We were looking
for signs of civilisation.

424
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,109
Obviously, we've found it.

425
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,664
You want me to get us back home,
this is our best shot.

426
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,825
Colonel, he's right.

427
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,942
l took some readings
on what they're mining.

428
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,782
This is the same material
as the Stargate.

429
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,261
Radio base camp.

430
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:44,460
Tell them to keep that area secured
until we get back.

431
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,499
Yes, sir.

432
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,701
The eye of Ra.

433
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,501
lt's the Egyptian sun god.

434
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,941
They think he sent us here.

435
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,620
Yeah. Wonder what could've
given 'em that idea.

436
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,699
Ra.

437
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,345
Ra ?

438
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,901
Where are they all going ?

439
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,749
Come in. Come in.

440
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,508
Feretti, l can't hear you.

441
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,541
Sir, l can't make this out.

442
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,908
Feretti, say again.

443
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,346
We have to abandon base camp !

444
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,748
Repeat,
we have to abandon base camp !

445
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:47,258
lt's useless !
lt won't work in this !

446
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,823
Freeman, let's go ! Let's go !

447
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,303
Everybody back inside !

448
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:13,585
The pyramid ! Back to the pyramid !

449
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,025
Where the hell did that come from ?

450
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,066
Kawalsky, Brown, do you read ?

451
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:47,306
Hey, Jackson. l don't think
we should eat any food here.

452
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,342
l don't know.
They might consider that an insult.

453
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:04,179
Well, we don't want to ofend them
now, do we, Daniel ?

454
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,508
Tastes like chicken.

455
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,983
Tastes like chicken.

456
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,702
lt's good.

457
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,309
lt tastes...

458
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,828
Tastes like chicken.

459
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,940
Tastes like chicken. Good !

460
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,703
Jackson.

461
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,105
You said
that was an Egyptian symbol.

462
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,220
Yeah. The eye of Ra.

463
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:48,185
Would you say, then, that if they
know one Egyptian symbol... ?

464
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,229
Yes.

465
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,939
Yes.

466
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,269
No, no.

467
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,258
What's going on ?

468
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:23,305
lt seems like writing
is forbidden to them.

469
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,068
What ? What ?

470
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,580
They want me to go with them !

471
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,029
Should l stay ?

472
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,423
l'll go with them.

473
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,181
l'll go. l'll be fine.

474
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,620
Okay, that's good. All right.

475
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:56,221
What is that smell ?

476
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,259
Oh, it's...

477
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,309
Okay, that's good.

478
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,659
That's good.
My hands are pretty clean.

479
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,348
Thank you very, very much.

480
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,823
Thank you very...

481
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,787
Thank you. That was great.

482
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,307
l smell much better now...

483
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:12,505
Yes...

484
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,341
Oh, Christ.

485
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,221
l smell like a yak.

486
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,506
No, no, please. No more.

487
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,744
Please.

488
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,223
Please, no more.

489
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,261
l'm fine. l'm clean, l'm...

490
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,024

491
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:34,503
l thought... you were
one of the other... cleaning...

492
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,104
No. No, no, no, no. You don't...

493
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,942
You don't have to do that. Please.

494
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,503
Maybe you should go.

495
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,541
Okay ? lt's okay.

496
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:57,861
Maybe you should go.

497
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,901
No, it's okay. lt's all right.

498
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,941
Here, let me take care of it.

499
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,579
No, no, no.

500
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:16,268
lt's me.

501
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,301
l wanted to thank you. l wanted...

502
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,102

Thank you.

504
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,789
Um...

505
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:33,819
Daniel.

506
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,945
Daniel.

507
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:38,902
No. Uh... l'm, uh...

508
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,538

l'm Daniel.

510
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,589
Sha'uri.

511
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,943
Sha'uri.

512
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,542
Uh... you, uh...

513
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,542
We came...

514
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,422
This...

515
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,269
..pyramid.

516
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,299
See, we...

517
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:07,548
..we came from the pyramid.

518
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,022
lt's... it's okay.

519
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:11,662
Never mind.

520
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,703
lt's okay.

521
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,743
Earth.

522
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,699
You... you know the symbol ?

523
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,741
You know the symbol ?

524
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:54,020
You've seen... the symbol ?

525
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,706
Show me.

526
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,741
You show me.

527
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:07,298
Kawalsky, this is base.
Do you copy ?

528
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,226
You're wasting the battery.

529
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:14,146
You won't get anything in this
storm. Wait till it passes.

530
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,259
Yeah, right.

531
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,707
lf it passes.

532
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,661
What the hell is goin' on ?

533
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,341
All right, spread out.

534
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,221
Behind the columns - move !

535
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:07,559
lt's okay. lt's just a lighter.

536
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:13,876
See ?

537
00:58:17,524 --> 00:58:19,116
Here.

538
00:58:30,044 --> 00:58:32,035
Yeah, it's pretty fabulous.

539
00:59:22,764 --> 00:59:24,755
Yeah, you're right.

540
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:26,795
lt's pretty stupid.

541
00:59:32,164 --> 00:59:34,439
No, you... keep it.

542
00:59:37,284 --> 00:59:38,797
lt's yours.

543
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:50,919
No !

544
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:56,000
lt's dangerous !

545
01:00:18,924 --> 01:00:20,915
What is this place ?

546
01:00:37,924 --> 01:00:39,596
Cypian.

547
01:00:39,644 --> 01:00:41,202
Rem-e-n-jef.

548
01:00:41,244 --> 01:00:43,314
Bah-ka-naf Sema.

549
01:00:43,364 --> 01:00:45,434
Tah-pah-rief.

550
01:00:46,044 --> 01:00:48,035
l'll be damned !

551
01:00:48,724 --> 01:00:50,157
Tah-pah-rief ?

552
01:00:50,204 --> 01:00:51,683
What ?

553
01:00:52,724 --> 01:00:54,123
Tah-pah-rief ?

554
01:00:54,724 --> 01:00:56,123
Tah-pah-rief ?

555
01:00:56,164 --> 01:00:57,756
Tah-pah-rief.

556
01:00:58,764 --> 01:01:00,356
Tah-pah-rief.

557
01:01:00,404 --> 01:01:01,996
Tah-pah...

558
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:04,073
Neh-jed ?

559
01:01:04,124 --> 01:01:05,079
Neh-jed ?

560
01:01:05,124 --> 01:01:06,079
Neh-dah.

561
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:08,194
Neh-dah. Neh-dah.

562
01:01:08,804 --> 01:01:09,793
Tiu.

563
01:01:09,844 --> 01:01:12,233
Tiu. Tiu.

564
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:13,683
Ah...

565
01:01:13,724 --> 01:01:15,043
Netjer ?

566
01:01:15,084 --> 01:01:16,437
Netjer-u ?

567
01:01:16,484 --> 01:01:17,712
Bah ? Netjer-u ?

568
01:01:17,764 --> 01:01:18,753
Natay.

569
01:01:18,804 --> 01:01:20,396
Naturu.

570
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:22,435
Natay. Naturu.

571
01:01:22,484 --> 01:01:24,281
Nafi.

572
01:02:19,484 --> 01:02:21,440
No signal at all ?

573
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:22,963
Nothing.

574
01:02:25,644 --> 01:02:27,635
More interference ?

575
01:02:28,084 --> 01:02:29,563
No.

576
01:02:29,804 --> 01:02:31,795
They're simply not there.

577
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:57,799
l haven't been able
to locate Jackson, sir.

578
01:03:16,124 --> 01:03:18,115
l'm looking for Jackson.

579
01:03:18,164 --> 01:03:20,678
Jackson.
The guy who wears this jacket.

580
01:03:20,724 --> 01:03:24,956
He's, uh, he's got, like,
long hair that comes down...

581
01:03:25,044 --> 01:03:26,272
No...

582
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:28,315
No, no, no. lt...

583
01:03:28,524 --> 01:03:29,923
He wears glasses...

584
01:03:29,964 --> 01:03:31,761
..so he can see.

585
01:03:37,204 --> 01:03:41,083
l guess the word ''dweeb''
doesn't mean anything to you guys.

586
01:03:41,124 --> 01:03:45,037
l'm on planet X looking for a dweeb
who wears green fatigues.

587
01:03:45,084 --> 01:03:47,473
He wears this jacket.
He's got long hair.

588
01:03:47,564 --> 01:03:50,237
lt comes over his eyes,
he wears glasses, and...

589
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,842
..sneezes.

590
01:03:58,564 --> 01:03:59,713
Chicken.

591
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:01,198
Chicken.

592
01:04:01,924 --> 01:04:04,313
Chicken. Chicken man. You got it.

593
01:04:12,524 --> 01:04:14,560
You want this ?

594
01:04:46,044 --> 01:04:48,638
l thought
you couldn't speak their language.

595
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,675
Hi... Scared me.

596
01:04:51,484 --> 01:04:53,759
lt's an ancient Egyptian dialect.

597
01:04:53,804 --> 01:04:57,240
Unlike the rest of their culture,
it's evolved independently.

598
01:04:57,284 --> 01:04:59,081
But once you know the vowels...

599
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:01,194
Just answer the question.

600
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:04,475
Well, l mean, l just
had to learn how to pronounce it.

601
01:05:04,524 --> 01:05:06,913
lt hasn't been a living,
spoken language...

602
01:05:06,964 --> 01:05:08,955
..in more than 1 ,000 years.

603
01:05:09,524 --> 01:05:13,563
Look at this. lt says
a traveller from distant stars...

604
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:15,362
..escaped from a dying world...

605
01:05:15,404 --> 01:05:18,555
..looking for a way
to extend his own life.

606
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:21,755
His body decaying and weak,
he couldn't prevent his own demise.

607
01:05:21,804 --> 01:05:25,240
Apparently, his whole species
was becoming extinct.

608
01:05:25,284 --> 01:05:27,559
So he travelled,...

609
01:05:27,604 --> 01:05:29,356
..or searched the galaxies,...

610
01:05:29,404 --> 01:05:32,123
..looking for a way to cheat death.

611
01:05:32,164 --> 01:05:33,233
And, uh,...

612
01:05:33,284 --> 01:05:36,754
..look here.
He came to a world rich with life...

613
01:05:36,804 --> 01:05:39,682
..where he encountered
a primitive race.

614
01:05:39,724 --> 01:05:41,521
Humans.

615
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:45,079
A species which, with all
his powers and knowledge,...

616
01:05:45,124 --> 01:05:46,762
..he could maintain indefinitely.

617
01:05:46,804 --> 01:05:50,956
He realised within a human body
he had a chance for a new life.

618
01:05:51,004 --> 01:05:54,633
Now, he apparently found
a young boy.

619
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:58,836
lt says as the frightened villagers
ran, night became day.

620
01:05:59,484 --> 01:06:02,794
Curious and without fear,
he walked towards the light.

621
01:06:06,324 --> 01:06:09,680
Ra took him
and possessed his body...

622
01:06:09,724 --> 01:06:13,842
..like some kind of a parasite
looking for a host.

623
01:06:13,884 --> 01:06:18,321
And, inhabiting this human form,
he appointed himself ruler.

624
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:23,195
He used the Stargate to bring
people to this planet...

625
01:06:23,244 --> 01:06:25,360
..as workers for the mines.

626
01:06:25,404 --> 01:06:27,315
Just like the one we saw.

627
01:06:27,364 --> 01:06:31,482
This mineral is the building
block of all his technology.

628
01:06:31,524 --> 01:06:33,754
With this
he can sustain eternal life.

629
01:06:33,804 --> 01:06:34,793
Now,...

630
01:06:34,884 --> 01:06:36,840
..something happened on Earth.

631
01:06:36,884 --> 01:06:41,321
A rebellion or uprising,
and the Stargate was buried there.

632
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:45,323
Fearful of a rebellion here,
Ra outlawed reading and writing.

633
01:06:45,364 --> 01:06:47,753
He didn't want people
to remember the truth.

634
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,877
Jackson, l think
you'd better look at this.

635
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:01,876
That's it.
That's what we're looking for.

636
01:07:01,964 --> 01:07:03,602
They must've hidden it here,...

637
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:06,636
..in hopes that one day
the gate on Earth could be reopened.

638
01:07:06,724 --> 01:07:09,363
l knew they'd have it
written down someplace.

639
01:07:09,844 --> 01:07:11,402
Wait a minute.

640
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,639
Where's the seventh symbol ?

641
01:07:13,684 --> 01:07:15,197
lt must have broken.

642
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:17,235
lt's got to be here somewhere.

643
01:07:19,324 --> 01:07:21,554
l got it here.

644
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:26,676
lt's worn of.

645
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:31,834
l can't make it work
without the seventh symbol.

646
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:34,357
All right, that's it.

647
01:07:34,404 --> 01:07:35,883
Kawalsky. Brown.

648
01:07:48,524 --> 01:07:50,116
Come on, Jackson !

649
01:08:33,884 --> 01:08:35,875
What the hell is that ?

650
01:08:42,524 --> 01:08:43,798
Here.

651
01:08:43,844 --> 01:08:45,641
You might need this.

652
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:02,683
Look out !

653
01:10:05,684 --> 01:10:07,481
Where are we going ?

654
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:12,393
Why are we going to the Stargate ?
l can't make it work.

655
01:10:12,444 --> 01:10:15,481
Stay here and shoot anything
that comes down that ramp.

656
01:10:15,524 --> 01:10:16,843
What are you doing ?

657
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:17,919
Just cover me.

658
01:10:24,644 --> 01:10:26,236
What is that ?

659
01:10:29,044 --> 01:10:31,319
- What are you looking for ?
- lt's gone.

660
01:11:03,724 --> 01:11:05,316
Put it down, Jackson.

661
01:13:05,444 --> 01:13:08,277
You have come here to destroy me.

662
01:13:11,004 --> 01:13:12,517
What is that ?

663
01:13:17,964 --> 01:13:21,513
lt's a bomb, isn't it ?
That's what you were looking for.

664
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,361
What the hell were you thinking ?

665
01:13:23,404 --> 01:13:25,474
What did you come here for ?

666
01:14:13,684 --> 01:14:14,878
Wait ! Don't !

667
01:14:16,884 --> 01:14:17,873
Wait !

668
01:14:17,964 --> 01:14:18,794
No ! No !

669
01:15:15,484 --> 01:15:17,236
Colonel ! lt's me !

670
01:15:18,204 --> 01:15:19,956
You all right ?

671
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:31,592
Where's Jackson ?

672
01:17:28,364 --> 01:17:31,276
Sha'uri, what happened here ?

673
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:33,679
Ra punished us.

674
01:17:33,724 --> 01:17:35,123
Why ?

675
01:17:39,684 --> 01:17:42,482
What happened to Daniel ?

676
01:18:04,404 --> 01:18:07,953
Son, we should not have helped
the strangers.

677
01:19:18,844 --> 01:19:20,562
l was dead ?

678
01:19:24,164 --> 01:19:27,395
bThat is why l chose your race.

679
01:19:27,444 --> 01:19:31,039
Your bodies, so easy to repair.

680
01:19:35,684 --> 01:19:37,959
You have advanced much,...

681
01:19:38,004 --> 01:19:41,838
..harnessed the power of the atom.

682
01:19:41,884 --> 01:19:43,875
What are you going to do ?

683
01:19:46,804 --> 01:19:51,195
You should not
have reopened the gate.

684
01:19:56,684 --> 01:20:00,563
Soon, l will send your weapon
back to your world...

685
01:20:00,604 --> 01:20:04,074
..with a shipment of our mineral...

686
01:20:05,684 --> 01:20:09,359
..which will increase
your weapon's destructive power...

687
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,554
..a hundredfold !

688
01:20:11,604 --> 01:20:13,879
Why would you do that ?

689
01:20:13,924 --> 01:20:16,677
l created your civilisation.

690
01:20:18,084 --> 01:20:20,552
Now l will destroy it !

691
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:42,003
But before my workers
question my authority,...

692
01:20:42,044 --> 01:20:45,036
..you will prove
that l am their one god...

693
01:20:45,964 --> 01:20:48,558
..by killing your companions.

694
01:20:50,724 --> 01:20:52,123
lf l refuse ?

695
01:20:52,844 --> 01:20:56,120
Then l will destroy you...

696
01:20:56,164 --> 01:20:59,236
..and all who have seen you.

697
01:20:59,284 --> 01:21:04,677
There can only be one Ra !

698
01:21:21,964 --> 01:21:22,953
Sha'uri,...

699
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:25,996
..Ra has called an assembly,...

700
01:21:26,444 --> 01:21:29,117
..an execution.

701
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:32,474
Skaara, Nabeh,
l want you all to listen.

702
01:21:38,404 --> 01:21:41,123
We can't let this happen.

703
01:21:41,164 --> 01:21:43,724
l want you to know
what Daniel told me...

704
01:21:43,764 --> 01:21:47,074
..about where our people
came from...

705
01:21:48,484 --> 01:21:51,794
..and why we can no longer
live as slaves.

706
01:23:30,884 --> 01:23:31,873
Come on !

707
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:47,593
Freeman !

708
01:23:49,804 --> 01:23:51,157
Freeman !

709
01:23:56,644 --> 01:23:57,997
Over there ! Come on !

710
01:23:58,044 --> 01:23:59,033
Kawalsky !

711
01:24:17,644 --> 01:24:19,635
To our victory !

712
01:24:23,844 --> 01:24:26,836
We recovered your weapons.

713
01:24:29,004 --> 01:24:30,403
Here, Colonel.

714
01:24:34,564 --> 01:24:36,361
So what do you think ?

715
01:24:36,844 --> 01:24:38,914
They're not exactly
Special Forces...

716
01:24:38,964 --> 01:24:41,717
..but they sure were
eager to join up !

717
01:24:41,764 --> 01:24:45,074
Take these guns away
before they hurt themselves.

718
01:24:46,404 --> 01:24:47,393
Sir ?

719
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:49,162
You heard me. Send 'em all home.

720
01:24:49,204 --> 01:24:51,798
There's no place
for these kids to go.

721
01:24:51,844 --> 01:24:54,312
Anyway, we could sure
use their help.

722
01:24:54,364 --> 01:24:56,082
For what ?!

723
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:57,443
Huh ?

724
01:24:57,484 --> 01:24:59,281
To do what ?!

725
01:25:09,084 --> 01:25:11,120
Why don't you
just tell 'em everything ?

726
01:25:12,844 --> 01:25:16,359
Why don't you tell 'em
about the bomb ?

727
01:25:16,404 --> 01:25:18,315
What's he talkin' about ?

728
01:25:23,604 --> 01:25:25,595
My orders were simple.

729
01:25:27,724 --> 01:25:30,875
Track down signs
of any possible danger.

730
01:25:30,924 --> 01:25:32,994
lf l found any,
blow up the Stargate.

731
01:25:34,764 --> 01:25:36,402
Well, l found some.

732
01:25:36,444 --> 01:25:38,082
Well, your bomb is his now.

733
01:25:38,124 --> 01:25:40,797
And tomorrow
he's gonna send it back to Earth.

734
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:43,358
With a shipment of that mineral
they mine here.

735
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:44,962
And when it goes of...

736
01:25:45,004 --> 01:25:47,677
..it'll be 100 times
more destructive...

737
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:51,239
..than that bomb alone
is capable of.

738
01:25:51,284 --> 01:25:54,162
l'll intercept that bomb
before he can send it through.

739
01:25:54,204 --> 01:25:55,796
Why wasn't l told of this ?

740
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:59,320
There was no reason to tell you.
You weren't supposed to be here.

741
01:25:59,364 --> 01:26:01,434
You were all gonna
go back with Daniel.

742
01:26:01,484 --> 01:26:04,601
l was gonna stay behind
and blow up the Stargate,...

743
01:26:04,644 --> 01:26:06,362
..and that's what l'm gonna do.

744
01:26:06,404 --> 01:26:08,679
lt's the gate on Earth
that poses the threat.

745
01:26:08,724 --> 01:26:10,555
That's the one
we have to shut down.

746
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:12,435
You're absolutely right.

747
01:26:12,484 --> 01:26:15,920
But since you don't know
how to get us back,...

748
01:26:15,964 --> 01:26:18,558
..we don't have that option, do we ?

749
01:26:36,604 --> 01:26:38,754
Where are they ?

750
01:26:41,804 --> 01:26:43,601
Answer !

751
01:26:43,644 --> 01:26:46,442
We looked everywhere.

752
01:26:48,124 --> 01:26:50,080
Some kids are helping them.

753
01:27:03,604 --> 01:27:06,801
You would have accepted that
no matter what happened...

754
01:27:06,844 --> 01:27:09,074
..you would not be going home ?

755
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:12,874
Don't you have people
who care about you ?

756
01:27:12,924 --> 01:27:14,721
Do you have a family ?

757
01:27:16,404 --> 01:27:17,837
l had a family.

758
01:27:21,084 --> 01:27:24,156
No-one should have to outlive
their own child.

759
01:27:24,924 --> 01:27:26,516
l don't wanna die.

760
01:27:27,684 --> 01:27:29,436
Your men don't wanna die.

761
01:27:29,564 --> 01:27:32,237
And these people here
don't wanna die.

762
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:35,598
lt's a shame
you're in such a hurry to.

763
01:28:20,004 --> 01:28:22,154
How could you let them escape ?

764
01:28:33,244 --> 01:28:36,475
l will not accept failure !

765
01:29:13,524 --> 01:29:15,116
Why are you laughing ?

766
01:29:15,164 --> 01:29:17,280
Husbands don't do this work.

767
01:29:19,884 --> 01:29:21,283
Husband ?

768
01:29:48,444 --> 01:29:49,843
Married ?

769
01:29:51,524 --> 01:29:53,196
Don't be angry.

770
01:29:54,204 --> 01:29:56,160
l didn't tell them.

771
01:29:56,204 --> 01:29:58,843
Tell them what ?

772
01:30:04,884 --> 01:30:07,876
That you did not want me.

773
01:30:47,524 --> 01:30:49,560
What are you drawing ?

774
01:30:52,404 --> 01:30:54,395
The day of our victory.

775
01:31:14,004 --> 01:31:15,801
Connect the moons.

776
01:31:19,164 --> 01:31:21,155
bThis is the symbol for this planet.

777
01:31:21,204 --> 01:31:22,956
That's it.

778
01:31:25,164 --> 01:31:26,995
The point of origin.

779
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:31,802
What're you doing ?

780
01:31:31,844 --> 01:31:33,163
l've found it !

781
01:31:33,204 --> 01:31:34,842
What're you talkin' about ?

782
01:31:34,884 --> 01:31:37,239
The seventh symbol.

783
01:31:39,084 --> 01:31:41,075
We're goin' home.

784
01:32:04,884 --> 01:32:06,283
Let's go.

785
01:32:09,484 --> 01:32:11,839
You'll bring disaster
on all of us, son.

786
01:32:11,884 --> 01:32:15,160
Father, we will not live as slaves.

787
01:32:20,484 --> 01:32:21,599
Kasuf !

788
01:32:24,684 --> 01:32:26,800
Take a look at your gods.

789
01:32:33,724 --> 01:32:35,442
Take a good look.

790
01:32:58,444 --> 01:33:00,514
The caravan is approaching.

791
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:05,633
Send the bomb down to the Stargate.

792
01:34:05,364 --> 01:34:07,355
What's happening up there ?

793
01:34:31,044 --> 01:34:32,238
How you doin' ?

794
01:34:45,644 --> 01:34:46,759
Damn !

795
01:34:46,804 --> 01:34:48,920
Come on, Feretti !

796
01:34:58,644 --> 01:34:59,713
Come on !

797
01:35:00,964 --> 01:35:03,080
Get that door !

798
01:35:27,244 --> 01:35:29,235
Hey, you okay ? You all right ?

799
01:35:37,084 --> 01:35:37,834
Spread out !

800
01:35:45,724 --> 01:35:47,760
Let's go !

801
01:35:51,724 --> 01:35:52,713
We're dead !

802
01:35:52,764 --> 01:35:55,562
- Quit talkin' like that !
- Well, what are we gonna do !

803
01:35:55,604 --> 01:35:56,593
Cover me.

804
01:35:56,644 --> 01:35:58,123
Cover you ?!

805
01:35:58,564 --> 01:35:59,679
Kawalsky !

806
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,232
Feretti,
help me push this thing over !

807
01:36:23,644 --> 01:36:25,475
Send the bomb to Earth now !

808
01:36:25,524 --> 01:36:27,958
l will send it myself !

809
01:36:45,724 --> 01:36:48,716
- What are you doing ?
- Completing this mission.

810
01:36:48,764 --> 01:36:51,722
We agreed to dismantle
the gate on the other side.

811
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:53,755
And you will.

812
01:36:53,844 --> 01:36:55,835
That's your job now.

813
01:36:55,884 --> 01:36:58,762
l'm gonna stay here,
make sure this goes of.

814
01:37:07,044 --> 01:37:09,035
You've got seven minutes.

815
01:37:58,804 --> 01:37:59,793
What are you doing ?

816
01:38:02,684 --> 01:38:04,197
Jackson !

817
01:38:04,244 --> 01:38:05,677
Wait for me.

818
01:40:07,364 --> 01:40:10,674
- You got any rounds, Feretti ?
- We're all out of ammo !

819
01:40:10,724 --> 01:40:12,077
lncoming !

820
01:40:39,844 --> 01:40:43,075
Kawalsky, we gotta do something.

821
01:40:44,244 --> 01:40:45,233
Damn !

822
01:40:47,484 --> 01:40:48,519
Hey !

823
01:40:48,564 --> 01:40:50,236
Stop !

824
01:40:50,284 --> 01:40:51,194
Hey !

825
01:41:42,084 --> 01:41:43,915
l am no longer amused.

826
01:42:02,684 --> 01:42:05,118
You will die together.

827
01:42:19,284 --> 01:42:22,356
Give my regards to King Tut,
asshole.

828
01:45:33,604 --> 01:45:36,402
- How much time do we have left ?
- 45 seconds.

829
01:45:36,444 --> 01:45:38,162
He's leaving. Turn it of.

830
01:45:38,204 --> 01:45:40,240
l'm trying to. l can't disarm it.

831
01:45:40,284 --> 01:45:41,080
What ?

832
01:45:41,124 --> 01:45:43,354
l can't stop it.
They've got it rigged.

833
01:45:57,964 --> 01:46:00,080
l've got an idea.

834
01:48:17,924 --> 01:48:21,041
- l always knew you'd get us back.
- Yeah, right.

835
01:48:21,084 --> 01:48:22,073
Later.

836
01:48:23,964 --> 01:48:25,556
Thanks, Daniel.

837
01:48:33,244 --> 01:48:35,235
You sure you wanna do this ?

838
01:48:35,284 --> 01:48:36,876
Yes. l'm sure.

839
01:48:37,884 --> 01:48:39,636
You gonna be all right ?

841
01:48:45,004 --> 01:48:46,596
How about you ?

842
01:48:50,924 --> 01:48:52,118
Yeah.

843
01:48:54,684 --> 01:48:56,675
Yeah, l think so.

844
01:49:03,724 --> 01:49:06,192
Tell Catherine this brought me luck.

845
