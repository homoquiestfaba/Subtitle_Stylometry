1
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:27,357
Under power of the State,
I am hereby authorized to put you...

2
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:30,472
Lee Ray Oliver,
to death by lethal injection.

3
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:32,570
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

4
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:34,369
Fuck you!

5
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:36,507
Fuck every last one of you!

6
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,683
Fuck you!

7
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:41,738
Cover that up, please.

8
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:48,083
Let 's get the bag open.

9
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:54,424
Thank you.

10
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:26,115
- Where am I?
- You're in the County Morgue.

11
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,802
I'm not dead.

12
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:42,147
The injections you got were all
saltwater except the anesthetic.

13
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:49,089
- What the fuck is going on?
- You're getting an opportunity...

14
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:53,163
to be part of a medical
research project.

15
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:55,566
If you agree to participate
in the experiment...

16
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:59,242
I'll take you toe tag here put
it on that body over there.

17
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:02,542
He'll be cremated,
you'll go on with these gentlemen.

18
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:05,848
If you don't agree the doctor will
inject you with sodium pentathol...

19
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,788
and the execution will proceed
right now in this room.

20
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,392
What kind of experiment?

21
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,638
It 's a behaviour
modifying drug trial.

22
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:18,268
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm a neuropharmacologist.

23
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:21,607
I'm involved in the research
and development of new drugs.

24
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,014
- I like drugs!
- The drug we're going to give you...

25
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,126
is not a narcotic. It won't
give you narcotic sensations.

26
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,228
And there may be side effects.
Some severe, possibly fatal.

27
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,143
- You want me to be a guinea pig?
- No, you'll be a test subject.

28
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,514
You have 1 minute
to make your decision.

29
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,282
Fuck you, Warden!

30
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:45,824
Proceed.

31
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:50,464
This is your last chance to do
something good in your life.

32
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,864
A chance to give something
back to society.

33
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,282
Fuck society! What the fuck
has society ever done for me?

34
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,047
Doctor!

35
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:12,701
Just wait!

36
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:33,774
Wherever we're going I hope it
smells better that it did in there.

37
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:36,913
Let 's go.

38
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:51,474
You greedy fuck!

39
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,844
So now you see how it goes.

40
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,545
Every time I say fuck...

41
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:05,423
he does that!
Because you, Warden...

42
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,203
have a lot of fucking nerve!

43
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,708
You thought you're gonna
get another one, didn't you?

44
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:14,748
But I said fucking, not fuck.

45
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:22,120
- Please, stop!
- Didn't I pay you well...

46
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:25,333
to let my men go after
Lee Ray in prison?

47
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:29,669
When Lee Ray offered him instead,
did I complain? No.

48
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,972
I didn't give a flying fuck!

49
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,590
I found out the State was gonna
execute him. So I am satisfied.

50
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:45,160
But now you tell me that
Lee Ray is actually alive...

51
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:47,431
and that you will find
out where he is...

52
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:49,868
if I pay you?

53
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:53,348
I'm sorry,
I'll do it for free. It 's fair!

54
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:56,519
You'll find him, and we'll kill him.

55
00:08:57,357 --> 00:08:59,384
Third time's the charm, right?

56
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:02,664
Yes, Mr. Vertov. Third time's the...

57
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,631
Don't fuck up!

58
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:20,723
You'll start off by taking
one pill every six hours.

59
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:24,770
Wait a fucking minute!
Wait a minute.

60
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,246
What 's this pill gonna do?

61
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:33,278
My name is Dr. Copeland. I designed
the medication you'll be taking.

62
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:37,551
It 's called Anagress. It works by
altering the brain's chemistry...

63
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:41,824
by suppressing your violent tendencies.
And with you aggression reduced...

64
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:45,835
you'll begin to experience feelings
of good will and compassion...

65
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:50,410
a sense of right and wrong,
even remorse over past mistakes.

66
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,155
- Good fucking luck.
- This is the first time Anagress...

67
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:58,798
has been tried on humans. We don't
know what the side effects are.

68
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,536
Hopefully they're minor:
Dry mouth, dizziness, nausea...

69
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:05,534
but there is a chance they
could be more severe.

70
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:07,406
Like what?

71
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,313
Liver failure, brain seizures...

72
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:13,587
...a stroke...
- Whatever.

73
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:15,454
Years ago, they might have
given you a lobotomy...

74
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:20,064
carved out a piece of your brain
like a rotten part of an apple.

75
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:23,670
But today we're more civilized.
We do it biochemically.

76
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:30,615
I rather have a bottle in front
of me than a frontal lobotomy!

77
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:38,263
How long is your little
experiment gonna last?

78
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:43,532
It 's never over.
You and the other 19 test subjects...

79
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,407
will be observed indefinitely.

80
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:48,646
That ' one pill every six hours.

81
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:51,183
Open wide.

82
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:54,361
Let 's go.

83
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:04,847
Open back up.

84
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,779
Smart man.

85
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:40,770
- Hey, Michael! How you doing?
- Good. I'm doing good.

86
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:42,273
Excellent.

87
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:45,211
Is that Austin?

88
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:47,887
He scored two goals
in the first half.

89
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,055
- He's getting real tall.
- They grow up so fast, don't they?

90
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:55,024
Ah, jeez!

91
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,731
I just came to see
how the team was doing.

92
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:00,775
We're doing good.

93
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:05,141
- It 's not the same, but...
- No. Nothing is.

94
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:07,754
Yes!

95
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:37,970
The guy seems a real teddy bear.
Two days and not a peep.

96
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:40,646
I want blood,
urine and saliva samples.

97
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:42,444
I have a PET scan and
SPECT scheduled.

98
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,985
Add a cerebral spinal
fluid analysis.

99
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,785
Yes, doctor.

100
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,793
Mr. Oliver...

101
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:55,107
we're going to remove
your last restraint.

102
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,710
<i>Iwant you to relax.</i>

103
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,105
I just died and live
to talk about it.

104
00:13:00,283 --> 00:13:02,549
<i>It doesn't get more
relaxed than this.</i>

105
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:04,747
Is it all right
if I smoke in here?

106
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,746
<i>We have a security breach.</i>

107
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,317
<i>I repeat,
we have a security breach.</i>

108
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,016
Go!

109
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:03,849
We got him!

110
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:24,693
- The man is a fucking animal.
- He's perfect!

111
00:14:49,842 --> 00:14:51,333
Hey, Aiku!

112
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,790
<i>- Shit!
- Zone 8 activated.</i>

113
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:04,657
<i>- Zone 8 activated.
- Aiku!</i>

114
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,139
- Hello.
- There you are!

115
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,338
I've been looking for you everywhere.
You've changed the code again.

116
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:17,247
I'm sorry. We agreed you were
gonna call before you came by.

117
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:19,618
It 's my weekend.
You knew I was coming by.

118
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:24,058
- I forgot. I'm sorry.
- How unusual!

119
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:29,176
Hello, Aiku!
How are you?

120
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:35,446
- What happened? You look terrible!
- It was a rough day at the office.

121
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:38,122
You look terrific, by the way.

122
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:44,530
I got a call from Jenny. She said
you showed up at the soccer match.

123
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:46,740
- That was fast!
- She was worried about you.

124
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,501
And I'm worried about you too.

125
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:52,845
I just wanted do feel
what it was like to...

126
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:57,187
be there again.

127
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,896
- I hurt too, you know.
- I know.

128
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,076
- That 's why I've gotta go.
- I know that too.

129
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:13,152
Come on. Time to go to mom's house.
Next time I call before I come.

130
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:15,291
- All right.
- Come on!

131
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:28,038
You never told me your
ex was so beautiful.

132
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,815
- How long have you been here?
- Not long.

133
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:33,579
I was just in the pool
and I saw her drive up.

134
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:39,331
It wouldn't be a brilliant idea for me
to be toweling off in the living room.

135
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:43,105
I went upstairs and
hid in your closet.

136
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:45,677
How's your jaw?

137
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:47,538
The truth?

138
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:56,824
- I'm gonna make you feel better.
- Make me forget everything.

139
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,869
Can you do that for me?

140
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:02,736
I can try.

141
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:38,893
- What the hell is going on?
- Take the pill first.

142
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:41,542
Where's my hair?
Where's my tattoos?

143
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:44,380
Erased. Like your past.

144
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:48,043
In the next few weeks we'll be
making changes on your outside...

145
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,922
while the medication
changes you on the inside.

146
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:54,324
After what you guys did to me, you
guys should be taking these pills!

147
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:56,326
OK, but you first.

148
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,408
Attaboy.

149
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,628
The guy is pretty good.
Beat my high score.

150
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,292
Seratonine metabolate levels?

151
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:35,327
Barely registering.

152
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:37,735
The guy is a textbook sociopath.

153
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,137
Is it true he stabbed an inmate
in the eye with a screwdriver?

154
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:43,042
Yes. He goes for the head.

155
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,188
- Increase game difficulty.
- Ok.

156
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:53,565
Let 's crank it up to mach 5.

157
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:07,689
- How'd he do with his MMPI?
- Just what you'd expect from...

158
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:09,863
a guy with antisocial
personality disorder...

159
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:12,967
...with psychotic tendencies.
- And that 's just for starters.

160
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:19,242
Your fucking thing is rigged!

161
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:20,742
<i>You can't hit a thing!</i>

162
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,212
Fuck!

163
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,738
This fucking thing is rigged!

164
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,140
Get the fuck...

165
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:41,509
Get the fuck...
thing is rigged!

166
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:44,484
This thing is fucked up!
It 's a broken machine!

167
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:47,291
Get the fuck outta here!

168
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:49,999
Fix your fucking machine!

169
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:53,129
There goes 1O grand.

170
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,338
Take it out of my paycheck.

171
00:19:59,953 --> 00:20:02,115
Nikolai Vertov. 27 years old.

172
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:05,053
Do you ever feel bad
about taking his life?

173
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:09,493
- Bad? I feel really bad.
- You do? Tell me.

174
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:13,608
If I'd known the motherfucker was
the nephew of a Russian mobster...

175
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:17,215
I never would've robbed him, let
alone put a bullet through his head.

176
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,527
Manoel Jose Gutierrez.

177
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:30,105
- You ever been in prison, Doc?
- Let 's not get distracted.

178
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:34,041
I didn't think so. It 's probably
not what you're exactly used to.

179
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,421
The Russian mobster took a contract
out on me for killing his nephew.

180
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:42,583
Gutierrez here tried to
cash in on that contract.

181
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:44,420
I just defended myself.

182
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:48,101
- You felt justified in...
- I felt fucking justified!

183
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:53,474
I don't give a fuck if you believe
me or not! That 's what happened.

184
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:56,846
I got the jump on him,
he's dead, I'm alive.

185
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,592
Gary David Caputo.

186
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:07,631
We got a minor bump.

187
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,975
He's alive.

188
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:16,378
- Just a little worse for wear.
- Tell me what happened with him.

189
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:22,759
Just wrong place, wrong time.
It 's not my problem.

190
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:26,367
You threatened to kill his brother
for testifying at the trial.

191
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,805
- Is that true?
- Are we done? This is getting boring.

192
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:33,676
You were 12 years old
when your mother died?

193
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,150
- You know exactly how old I was!
- These files have discrepancies.

194
00:21:37,323 --> 00:21:41,593
I just wanna make sure I get it right.
A former boyfriend killed her...

195
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:43,757
and you witnessed the murder.
Is that true?

196
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:46,537
Just give me the drugs
and let 's get on with it.

197
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,335
You never said anything about
answering any of these questions!

198
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:52,243
- Just answer the question.
- I'll answer whatever I want!

199
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:56,388
And don't you go talking to
me like that. I'm not your kid!

200
00:21:57,392 --> 00:22:00,693
If you don't answer the question,
you're of no use to me.

201
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:04,664
I'll transfer you back to the
custody of the warden right now.

202
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:07,438
You are only alive because of me.

203
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:11,043
Why don't you answer the questions,
so I can help you?

204
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:19,592
I was 1O...

205
00:22:19,932 --> 00:22:21,298
not 12.

206
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:22,833
I was 1O.

207
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,770
Thank you.

208
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:27,707
Yes, I saw her
thrashing around.

209
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,815
I saw the whole
goddamn thing.

210
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:36,726
And then the fuck who killed
her took a piss in front of me.

211
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:41,099
Then he turned around and said:
"When you got to go...

212
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:43,204
you got to go".

213
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:46,233
You wanna hear about what my
uncle John used to do with me?

214
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:49,081
He had a little hobby
that he called golf.

215
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:51,776
He used to beat me with his
driver every Tuesday night.

216
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,984
Write that down. Why don't you
write a fucking book about it?

217
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:59,232
- All right, that 's enough for today.
- It is e-fucking-nough!

218
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:03,028
I'm everything you hate
in the world, huh, Doc?

219
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:57,561
He's more at ease.
Much less agitated.

220
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,234
Five of the rhesus monkeys showed
results after only three doses.

221
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,040
- When is his next PET scan?
- "Mañana".

222
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,513
Let 's do it now.

223
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:19,530
- Hey, Doc!
- How ya doin'?

224
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:24,210
I'm actually doing really good!
It 's strange. I feel... different.

225
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:29,491
Everything seems clearer,
I feel less wound up.

226
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:30,954
Good.

227
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:35,565
- Shit... it really works.
- We just got to do...

228
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:37,129
Come here!

229
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,401
Everybody, get away!

230
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,443
Nobody move! Back up!

231
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,184
I'm gonna stick this
pen in his eye!

232
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:47,388
Put the fucking guns down!

233
00:24:47,557 --> 00:24:49,458
- Get away!
- Put it down!

234
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:52,462
- So what he says!
- Put the gun down!

235
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:54,564
- Help me outta here, Doc.
- I will!

236
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:56,099
Put 'em down!

237
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:58,032
Put the guns down!

238
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,439
Get away! Put the guns down!

239
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,711
Put it down!

240
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:06,388
I swear to fucking Christ
it 's going in his eye!

241
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,491
Tell him to put the gun down.

242
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:11,560
- Do as he says.
- Get outta here!

243
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:13,797
Tell me how to get outta here!

244
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,637
Tell me how to get outta here!

245
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:32,963
We'll take it from here.

246
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:36,703
Get the fuck... jeez...

247
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:43,078
You're just as fucked
up as I am, Doc.

248
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:46,484
You got a fancy suit...
You're just as fucked up as I am.

249
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:49,459
You're just as fucked up.
Get off of me!

250
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:56,066
Jesus, are you okay.

251
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:58,714
Increase the dosage.
8 milligrams three times a day.

252
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:01,516
That 's more than 3 times
the previous.

253
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,121
Just do it.

254
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:08,865
<i>Hart-Mercer Pharmaceuticals...</i>

255
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,594
<i>dedicated to making the world
a happier,healthier place.</i>

256
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,207
<i>Now and in years ahead,
we will continue our...</i>

257
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:19,715
You are too involved.
There's a reason why they...

258
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:23,482
don't want a primary researcher
conducting his own clinical trial.

259
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,596
The man is out of control. Unsuitable.
We'll find another one.

260
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:30,669
We have to give him more time.
I'm increasing the dosage.

261
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:34,343
If you don't like it, you can hand
my resignation in to the board.

262
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:42,054
Be careful. If one threatens to
resign one time too many...

263
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,716
they get taken up on it.

264
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:48,061
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Senior
V.P. Of Research and Development...

265
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:49,997
Dr. Arlo Penner.

266
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:02,014
Thank you.

267
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:06,860
Not too long ago, the acronym
SSRI was virtually unheard of.

268
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:12,333
Now, of course, Selective
Seratonin Reuptake Inhibitors...

269
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:16,242
help millions of people
lead better lives.

270
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,188
Today, as we speak...

271
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,526
a new class of pharmaceuticals
is being developed...

272
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:28,262
that has the potential to
change society as we know it.

273
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:34,646
As you're probably aware,
the reason why Hart-Mercer stock...

274
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:37,754
remains strong within this
volatile market sector...

275
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,652
is largely because of Dynax.

276
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:43,155
And I'm pleased to be able
to announce to you that...

277
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,527
Dynax has once again
been named...

278
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:49,870
as this year's most
prescribed anti-depressant.

279
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:55,618
So, on behalf of...

280
00:27:56,688 --> 00:28:01,094
the board of directors and the
shareholders of Hart-Mercer...

281
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,993
I wanna thank you,
Dr. Michael Copeland...

282
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:08,741
for your groundbreaking work
which continues to this day.

283
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:26,330
- Congratulations, doctor.
- Thanks.

284
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:31,279
- You look surprised to see me.
- Maybe a little.

285
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:33,810
Did you forget that
I'm a shareholder?

286
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:35,319
Made us both rich.

287
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,017
As you keep climbing the ladder,
don't forget to count the rungs.

288
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,927
Remember when all we wanted
was that one bedroom house?

289
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,999
With our very own washer and dryer.

290
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,007
- And I was gonna open up a center...
- Stop. You're making me feel old.

291
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,945
- How are you?
- I'm good.

292
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:53,617
- Congratulations, doctor.
- Thanks.

293
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:59,654
Barbara, this is Eden Ross.
She's a post-doc. Part of the team.

294
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,926
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

295
00:29:02,236 --> 00:29:03,830
When I was an undergrad...

296
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:07,776
I read your paper on the educational
deficits effect on family violence.

297
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,377
- It was really brilliant.
- Thanks.

298
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:15,116
Now I officially do feel old.
Next time invent a pill for that. Bye.

299
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:18,130
- Nice seeing ya.
- Bye.

300
00:29:23,574 --> 00:29:26,978
- So am I gonna see you tonight?
- I hope so.

301
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:57,426
Are you buying a car?

302
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:02,040
- Tuesday! Must be beef stew.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

303
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,679
I'm sorry, Lee Ray.

304
00:30:10,189 --> 00:30:12,716
It 's all right. It 's cool.
No swat.

305
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,994
I'll get something to clean it up.

306
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:23,076
- He didn't hit me.
- I could've made that accident...

307
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:24,474
more natural.

308
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:28,279
- This is very good, gentlemen.
- I did a decent Yago, senior year.

309
00:30:28,454 --> 00:30:31,290
- Who the hell is Yago?
- We've got his MAO level.

310
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:33,895
Lambda K three is point one four.

311
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:06,877
This is your last chance to do
something good in your life.

312
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:25,045
OK. I'll be right there.

313
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:29,323
- Who was it?
- Security.

314
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:32,762
I'll go with you.

315
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:47,482
Come on, man, just chill.
It 's all right.

316
00:31:48,562 --> 00:31:50,224
No, it 's not.

317
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:55,165
- I'm gonna be sick again.
- Take a deep breath.

318
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,033
What 's going on?

319
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,310
What 's going on?

320
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:04,419
- I can see his face.
- Whose face?

321
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:08,086
Gary Caputo's.

322
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:11,799
Wrong time, wrong place.

323
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:15,835
He was just standing on the
stairs with a bag of groceries.

324
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:21,685
I should've just ran by, passed him
and just gotten the hell outta there.

325
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:26,224
It 's OK.

326
00:32:35,845 --> 00:32:38,178
He was in a coma
for seven months.

327
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:42,717
He had to learn to do
everything all over again.

328
00:32:45,628 --> 00:32:49,692
When I was in prison,
I used to joke about him.

329
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:56,878
I used to brag about how
I made the guy into a vegetable.

330
00:32:57,482 --> 00:33:01,148
What 's important is you know
that what you did is wrong.

331
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:04,089
The treatment is working.

332
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:07,889
- It 's working.
- Why can't I sleep?

333
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:11,530
I wanna put my head on my pillow...

334
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:14,770
close my eyes and don's
see his face anymore.

335
00:33:16,783 --> 00:33:17,841
It 's gonna be OK.

336
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:28,329
We'll give him Somnubel.
5 milligrams.

337
00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:31,873
Brock, that 's two tablets
whenever he can't sleep.

338
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,310
Ladies and gentlemen...

339
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:37,517
we've got remorse.

340
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:40,549
How can we be sure
he's not faking again?

341
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:42,591
All of his biomarkers back it up.

342
00:33:42,762 --> 00:33:47,169
Ever since week 5 his serotonin
and MAO levels have improved...

343
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:49,499
limbic and amygdale activity...

344
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,042
as well as BFS measures
have responded in kind.

345
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:57,076
I think we're ready for Phase 2.

346
00:33:58,423 --> 00:34:02,419
Are you sure? The board
and I both believe that is...

347
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,291
absolutely your call.

348
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:09,768
But we all know the risks involved
in moving forward too quickly.

349
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:15,975
It 's going to work. I think that
we've uncreated a monster.

350
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:31,204
- Lot more cell phones!
- Tell me about it.

351
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,279
- This thing is tight.
- You'll get used to it.

352
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,718
The only way that truly gauge...

353
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:43,163
the effects of Anagress is to
observe you in the real world.

354
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:46,197
A controlled environment
can only tell us so much.

355
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:49,369
I haven't been on the
outside in a long time.

356
00:34:51,115 --> 00:34:54,143
- What if I fall on my ass?
- You get back up.

357
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,286
This is it?

358
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,325
- I thought you were made of money.
- Beats your last address.

359
00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:35,591
That 's fine, guys.

360
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:40,457
- Thanks.
- Let 's do it again.

361
00:35:41,002 --> 00:35:42,972
- What 's your name?
- Joe Monroe.

362
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,206
And what have you been
doing for the last 5 years?

363
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:49,306
Working in Cincinnati, Ohio,
in a packaging plant.

364
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:53,414
- Loading boxes in a warehouse.
- Good.

365
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:56,885
Here's 3OO bucks and an
ID to get you started.

366
00:36:00,303 --> 00:36:03,571
- And then what?
- Another 3OO next week.

367
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:05,567
You're on your own.

368
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,356
It 's nice.

369
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,494
- There's nothing in the fridge!
- Guess you'd better go to the store.

370
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,712
Something wrong?

371
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:34,556
No, just looking at the view.

372
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,533
All right.

373
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:42,169
I'll let you get settled.

374
00:37:06,486 --> 00:37:10,050
He hasn't stabbed anybody in
the eye yet. So, that 's a start.

375
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:14,998
Eden, I want a seratonin
metabolite analysis.

376
00:37:20,176 --> 00:37:21,702
Attaboy!

377
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:40,803
- Tracking okay?
- We're on.

378
00:37:57,374 --> 00:37:59,469
Oh, man, he's oh for eight.

379
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,311
What we'll do if no
one will hire him?

380
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:04,647
The question is, what he'll do?

381
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:32,930
He's into current events now?

382
00:38:33,672 --> 00:38:36,700
- He's checking out the classifieds.
- Impressive!

383
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,548
Yeah, Sully. Sully from inside.
He told me to call you.

384
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:46,320
25O is all I can spare,
you understand?

385
00:38:46,862 --> 00:38:49,024
Why? 'Cause I gotta
buy groceries.

386
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,258
Sully, yes.

387
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:54,337
All right. Good.
I'll see you there.

388
00:39:21,823 --> 00:39:24,020
- You guys hiring?
- You see a Help Wanted sign?

389
00:39:44,496 --> 00:39:46,864
You in the blue shirt.
Come here.

390
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:53,677
- What?
- Think I can help you.

391
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:58,586
You can fill out this application.

392
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:04,664
- What d'ya wanna know?
- The usual.

393
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:08,870
I know everything about cars.
Foreign, American, everything.

394
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:13,837
All you need to know is how to drive
them 1O feet without crashing them.

395
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:15,414
I could do that.

396
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:28,167
I'm gonna have to get back to you
for the numbers for references.

397
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:32,704
Don't worry. Put any number. I'm
the one who makes the phone calls.

398
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:36,542
Give these away to people who get the
hot wax. You getting the hot wax?

399
00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:39,783
- No, sir.
- He's filling out the application.

400
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,292
It 's looking really good.

401
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:43,328
- Are you a hard worker?
- Very hard.

402
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,571
- Take drugs?
- No. Vitamins, but that 's it.

403
00:40:46,906 --> 00:40:48,966
You bullshitting me? I don't
want drug addicts working for me.

404
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:51,008
I don't take drugs.
Honest. No drugs.

405
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,086
I'll start you at 5,75 an hour,
plus tips.

406
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,760
Go grab a rag and talk to Alfonso.
Tell him Ralph sent you.

407
00:40:59,995 --> 00:41:02,124
- I'll be back at one.
- Thank you.

408
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:06,606
Here. Better go before
he changes his mind.

409
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:09,402
- Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
- Sure.

410
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:39,988
You Sully's friend?

411
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,627
Do I know you?

412
00:41:43,873 --> 00:41:45,205
I'm Sully's friend.

413
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:47,969
You got what I want?

414
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:53,788
You sound like someone
I knew. I think he's dead.

415
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:58,392
- Some son-of-a-bitch he was.
- I guess he can be me then.

416
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:02,202
- What 's he doing?
- Looking for us.

417
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:16,530
I'd say that Lee Ray just took
the hidden out of hidden camera.

418
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,639
Nightmares again?

419
00:44:25,155 --> 00:44:28,719
Can't give you any more.
Doc said two pills a night, max.

420
00:44:29,863 --> 00:44:31,593
Did you ever try these things?

421
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:33,759
Nah. Soon as I hit
the bed, I'm out.

422
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,606
My daddy used to say that...

423
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,444
an honest man's pillow
is his peace of mind.

424
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:42,676
Wanna play cards? It 's gonna take 2O
minutes for these things to kick in.

425
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:46,982
I'm not supposed to do anything
that could affect your environment.

426
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:50,165
Winning a hand of cards is
really gonna affect my life!

427
00:44:50,767 --> 00:44:52,929
Come on, I've got this
kick-ass root beer here.

428
00:44:53,103 --> 00:44:55,232
You won't let me have any alcohol,
so I sprang for the good stuff.

429
00:44:55,775 --> 00:44:57,768
All right,
but then I'm out the door.

430
00:45:02,053 --> 00:45:03,146
Cheers.

431
00:45:16,778 --> 00:45:18,805
How long have you been
working with theses guys?

432
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:21,715
Three years this month.
I used to be a cop in Detroit...

433
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:23,781
but this is much better.

434
00:45:25,094 --> 00:45:28,031
I'm not even supposed to
talk to you. I gotta go.

435
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:30,499
- Get some sleep.
- No, take it with you.

436
00:45:30,903 --> 00:45:32,735
- It 's fine.
- Thanks, man.

437
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:23,952
What are you wearing?

438
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,267
Really?

439
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,404
Is that all?

440
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:34,439
I think you are a
very naughty girl.

441
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,721
Shit!

442
00:46:52,747 --> 00:46:54,613
Come on, Brock.

443
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:57,481
<i>I see your goddamn walkie.</i>

444
00:46:58,624 --> 00:47:01,858
<i>The Blue Line for Davenport
now boarding on Track 4.</i>

445
00:47:27,508 --> 00:47:30,604
Dr. Copeland?
It 's Norton. We've lost him.

446
00:47:38,193 --> 00:47:41,358
The train is bound to Davenport.
We got him on GPS.

447
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,435
This piece of shit has been playing
a big con on us all along.

448
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:46,335
That 's not possible.

449
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:48,806
What the hell's he
doing in Davenport?

450
00:47:49,312 --> 00:47:51,908
Shit. That 's where
Gary Caputo lives.

451
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:54,144
The guy Lee Ray shot
in the stairwell?

452
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:57,393
And his brother that testified
against Lee Ray lives there too.

453
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:47,911
Bill's not here!

454
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:51,715
Gary?

455
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:53,619
Bill's not here.

456
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:57,424
I'm not looking for Bill.

457
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,734
I came here to see you.

458
00:49:07,383 --> 00:49:09,080
I like this commercial.

459
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,661
Who are you?

460
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:18,431
My name is Joe.

461
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,105
- I don't know anyone named Joe.
- I'm a new friend.

462
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:29,881
I wanna tell you something.

463
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:40,331
Long time ago,
somebody hurt you.

464
00:49:42,578 --> 00:49:45,014
Really bad.
They hurt you really bad.

465
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:49,255
And they want me to tell you they
were really sorry for what they did.

466
