don't wanna be alone right now.

You should take a nap.

You know, I have an idea.

963
01:09:00,099 --> 01:09:02,701
I have to run a few errands
for Mr. Bell, okay,

964
01:09:02,735 --> 01:09:06,973
and then I'll pick up some food,
and we can watch a movie,

965
01:09:07,006 --> 01:09:08,975
and in the meantime
just get some sleep, okay?

966
01:09:09,008 --> 01:09:09,809
No, I'd like to come.

She actually just fell asleep
in my RV.

Okay, um, don't be mad,

1054
01:17:09,054 --> 01:17:11,990
but I went into your room
looking for you,

1055
01:17:12,024 --> 01:17:15,527
and I saw this old iPod
on a nightstand,

1056
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:17,162
and I thought you know,
maybe your music

1057
01:17:17,196 --> 01:17:18,097
could calm me down.

1058
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:27,673
But on it was this recording
of a boy being punched

1059
01:17:27,706 --> 01:17:29,942
and it was weird,
and it was like a... a drum beat,

1060
01:17:29,975 --> 01:17:30,943
but on a kid,

1061
01:17:30,976 --> 01:17:35,547
and then there was
this little girl giggling,

1062
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:39,017
and I thought maybe
that was you.

1063
01:17:39,051 --> 01:17:40,219
I mean it reminded me
of the other night

1064

Yeah, but the little boy wasn't.

1071
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,634
I was young.

1072
01:17:58,437 --> 01:17:59,972
The orphanage
was a fucked up place

1073
01:18:00,005 --> 01:18:05,344
and when kids heard
I killed my dad, they...

1074
01:18:05,377 --> 01:18:07,312
Kids are assholes.

01:18:07,346 --> 01:18:07,980

But you were...
you were enjoying it.

01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:22,361
Yeah, I was

1079
01:18:22,394 --> 01:18:26,064
enacting my revenge
and making music.

1080

that was cathartic.

1107
01:19:19,819 --> 01:19:22,421

losing my hearing again, and I...
