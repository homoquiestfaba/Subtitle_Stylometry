well, I'm sorry I didn't get
a chance to see him.

13
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:45,667

about whom my wife marries.

Ah. Do you mind if I meet him?

It wouldn't do any good, really.

- I suppose Bruce, uh... what's his name?
- Baldwin.

28

Baldwin... I suppose
he opens doors for you.

29
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:15,037
He does, and when he's with
a lady, he takes his hat off.

Oh, I am sorry.

31

How do you do, sir?

36
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:34,249

I'm already married.

at the bus stop, 9 A.M.

525
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:15,816
Hey, leave me alone now.

526
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,948
Don't touch me!

527
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:22,892
I'm fine.

528
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:28,930
You still gonna help me out?

529
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:31,164
9 A.M.

530
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:32,900
What's
your writer friend's name?

531
00:28:33,908 --> 00:28:34,897
Mickey Hopkins.

532
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:47,551
Where's the kid?
Out screwing around again?

533
00:28:48,756 --> 00:28:51,554
He's in his room
working on his computer.

534
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:53,753
Probably some internet scam.

535
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:56,592
No. Cameron's really focused.

536
00:28:56,664 --> 00:28:58,325
Yeah, that is the word.

537
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,390
He's focused
on something these days.

538
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:02,024
Yeah, right.

539
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:06,296
So we got dessert?

CAMERON: Mickey is amazing.

548
00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:39,316
I looked up his credits
online last night and...

549
00:31:40,194 --> 00:31:42,822
Well, Roman Holiday. Jesus.

550
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:45,127
Now, you see
that building over there?

551
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:47,133
Used to be
Charlie Chaplin's studio...

552
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,362
when he was
running United Artists...

553
00:31:49,437 --> 00:31:51,428

554
00:31:52,273 --> 00:31:53,262
Wow.

555
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:29,073
Yes, may I help you?

556
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:31,509
Hey, Mickey... it's Flash.

557
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:34,503
Huh?

You know, Flash Madden.

00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:43,151
Flash Madden?

561
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:45,988
Oh, my God. How wonderful!

562
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,255
Well, come in, Flash.

563
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:50,627
Please make yourself at home.

564
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:08,014
Flash, it's been a hundred years
since I saw you last.

565
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:09,845
Two hundred.

That's a good idea, Mickey.

the kid here is, uh...

575

He's about to make a movie.

576
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,329
It's a student film.

577
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:04,428
He asked me to help him.
I mean, what the hell?

578
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:09,204
But when I heard his idea,
I knew he needed a writer.

579
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:10,868
Really?

580
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:12,139
Yeah.

I know exactly what you mean.

585
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:24,487
We had a similar problem.

586
00:34:24,558 --> 00:34:27,425
First of all,
there are no problems...

588
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:33,665

figure out how to end it.

Yeah, sure, Flash. I'll, um...

I don't think he was
in a union that provides for it.

I'm lucky.

and especially Africa...

Oh, no.

She's different now.

669

So then he's an asshole, right?

670
00:38:58,365 --> 00:38:59,764
Yeah, probably.

671
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,391
Yeah, you're better off
without him.

672
00:39:04,772 --> 00:39:07,673
Eh, the world's upside down.

- Nietzsche said that too.

688

But what do you know
about Nietzsche?

No, I, I meant...

691
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:58,850
Nietzsche was
full of shit most of the time.

692
00:39:58,926 --> 00:40:02,020
Tolstoy says
that Nietzsche was stupid...

693
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:04,029
and, uh, abnormal...

694
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:06,463
and so is your friend Murphy.

695
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,160
Yeah, well, you got
the abnormal part right.

696
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:09,532
I'd keep an eye on him.

00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:12,265
Oh, not to change
the subject...

698
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:15,001
from Nietzsche
and the great Murphy...

699
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:18,977

how you doin' on my Cubans?

700
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:23,208
Just what the doctor

no wankers?

877
00:49:35,568 --> 00:49:36,557
Right.

878
00:49:37,637 --> 00:49:39,832
I always wanted to be
a wanker... director.

879
00:49:39,906 --> 00:49:42,602
A director, huh?
The man in the chair, huh?

880
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:43,733
I guess.

881
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,141
You guess?

882
00:49:45,211 --> 00:49:47,236
The man in the chair
can't ever be a guesser.

883
00:49:47,313 --> 00:49:48,541
He's gotta make decisions.

884
00:49:48,615 --> 00:49:49,946
You know, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom.

885
00:49:50,016 --> 00:49:51,347
He's gotta know
what he's doing.

886
00:49:51,418 --> 00:49:54,182
Frank Capra says, "If you're
half right, you'll be a genius."

887
00:49:54,254 --> 00:49:56,381
Frank Capra, cool director.
Money!

888
00:49:56,456 --> 00:49:58,287
Hello? [Mutters]

889
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:00,988
CAMERON:
Did you ever direct a movie?

890
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:02,790
Yeah, I got close to it
a couple of times...

891
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:08,095
but it wasn't exactly my cup of,
uh, tea... if you get my drift.

892
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:11,160
Oh, you had a little booze,
drinking problem...

893
00:50:11,237 --> 00:50:12,226
thing, problem?

894
00:50:13,273 --> 00:50:15,605
Oh, yeah, I had my...
[Chuckles]

895
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:19,202
fair share of, mmm,
missed opportunities.

896
00:50:23,817 --> 00:50:24,806
Flash?

897
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:25,873
Yeah, kid.

898
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:33,492
You're the only one who
can help me out with this.

899
00:50:35,328 --> 00:50:37,660
And I want to know everything
there is to know.

900
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,426
Teach me how to make movies...

901
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,060
how to watch them...
everything.

902
00:50:43,136 --> 00:50:45,400
It means
that much to you, huh?

903
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:47,440
To be the man in the chair?

904
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:50,169
Yeah, it does... everything.

905
00:50:50,243 --> 00:50:52,541
Will you be willing
to pay the price?

906
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,580
Cigars and Wild Turkey?

907
00:50:55,648 --> 00:50:57,548
No, no, no.
Well, yeah, yeah, of cour...

908
00:50:57,617 --> 00:50:58,606
[Sharply] No.

909
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:02,010
I mean, the real price.

910
00:51:04,023 --> 00:51:05,456
CAMERON: What's that?

911
00:51:05,525 --> 00:51:08,016
A promise... to me...

912
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:12,563
that if you ever make it,
you won't crap on people...

913
00:51:12,632 --> 00:51:14,293
like Mickey and the others...

914
00:51:15,301 --> 00:51:17,292
like these fine folks.

915
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:25,534
And that you'll never forget
how and who...

916
00:51:27,147 --> 00:51:28,808
got you to the chair.

917
00:51:30,216 --> 00:51:31,877
Can you make that promise?

918
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,510
Sure, Flash.

919
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:39,286
Now we're talking Technicolor.

920
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:43,792
Well, it'll actually
probably be 24p digital video.

921
00:51:43,863 --> 00:51:44,852
Yeah, whatever.

922
00:51:55,475 --> 00:51:57,409
- You know all these people?
- Yeah, most of them.

923
00:51:58,578 --> 00:52:00,136
Do you have a star?

924
00:52:00,213 --> 00:52:02,078
The only thing in the ground
with my name on it...

925
00:52:02,148 --> 00:52:03,638
will be a gravestone.

926
00:52:03,716 --> 00:52:05,149
Why? You made
some great movies.

927
00:52:05,218 --> 00:52:08,585
Oh, come on.
You gotta be famous, adored.

928
00:52:08,655 --> 00:52:09,952
- I'm neither.
- [Bell ringing]

929
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:11,547
You should get a star just
for helping out me and Murphy.

930
00:52:11,624 --> 00:52:15,355
Hey, remember this.
The glitter ends at La Brea.

931
00:52:15,428 --> 00:52:16,793
What does that mean?

932
00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:20,162
You see the glitter that
the city puts in the pavement...

933
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,599
- where the stars are, huh?
- Yeah?

934
00:52:22,669 --> 00:52:25,365
Well, look, it ends at La Brea.

935
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:27,962
No stars, no glitter.

936
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,566
In other words, uh,
it don't last forever...

937
00:52:30,643 --> 00:52:32,076
like fame in Hollywood.

938
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:34,613
It lasts for only a second,
if at all.

939
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:37,844
So don't friggin' worry
about gettin' famous.

940
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:39,680
Get good at your job.

941
00:52:39,752 --> 00:52:42,380
If fame comes along, so be it.

942
00:52:42,455 --> 00:52:43,479
CAMERON:
You're famous to me.

943
00:52:43,556 --> 00:52:46,184
FLASH: That's because you
don't know anybody else.

944
00:52:55,568 --> 00:52:56,694
NURSE: Oh!

945
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:00,736
YOGA INSTRUCTOR ON TV:
As you can see, we have...

946
00:53:00,807 --> 00:53:02,035
MAN: Oh, come on, Speed.
We're all trying to see that.

947
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:05,703
Move back please, Speed,
so we can all see.

948
00:53:05,778 --> 00:53:06,767
What?

949
00:53:07,747 --> 00:53:09,146
MAN: Get out of the way.

950
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:16,044
- Hey!
- Well, what's happening?

951
00:53:16,122 --> 00:53:18,113
- Flash, I was dancing.
- [Overlapping chatter]

952
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:20,218
FLASH:
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

953
00:53:20,293 --> 00:53:21,726
Shut up! Shut up!

954
00:53:21,794 --> 00:53:23,785
I got something to tell you.

955
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,227
We're going on location.

956
00:53:28,401 --> 00:53:30,232
It's time for my medication?

957
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:31,292
[Murmuring]

958
00:53:32,505 --> 00:53:34,564
MAN 2:
No, we're going on location.

959
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:37,337
- Oh, Speed.
- Not yet, we're not rolling.

960
00:53:38,544 --> 00:53:41,877
I just love location shooting!

961
00:53:41,948 --> 00:53:45,179
The hotels, the parties,
the fun, the dancing...

962
00:53:45,251 --> 00:53:46,843
Slut.

963
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:48,443
Mrs. Erskine!

964
00:53:48,521 --> 00:53:49,510
Oh, she's a tramp!

965
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:51,648
You silly old biddy.

966
00:53:51,724 --> 00:53:54,693
Why, your chariot's so low,
it's dragging the basement floor.

967
00:53:54,761 --> 00:53:55,785
Get a life.

968
00:53:55,862 --> 00:53:56,920
FLASH: Hey, hey, ladies...

969
00:53:56,996 --> 00:53:58,429
Is that Animal Planet?

970
00:53:58,498 --> 00:53:59,931
FLASH: Hey, hey ladies, relax.

971
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:02,991
Ladies... we're not exactly
going on location...

972
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:05,196
- but we are going into production.
- MAN: O.K.

973
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:06,260
MRS ERSKINE:
Yeah, what's the rate?

974
00:54:06,339 --> 00:54:07,829
What did he say?

975
00:54:07,907 --> 00:54:09,374
That's great, that's hot.

976
00:54:09,442 --> 00:54:11,410
[Whistling] Let him talk!

977
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:16,243
Well, I met a kid who needs
our help with his student film.

978
00:54:16,316 --> 00:54:18,409
- Hey, Flash!
- Yeah, Montana.

979
00:54:18,484 --> 00:54:19,951
What's he need?

980
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:21,452
He needs your help
with wardrobe...

981
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:23,648
and, Rich, he needs your help
with art direction.

982
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:25,213
Speed can help with sound.

983
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,782
- What?
- You can do the sound.

984
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:30,461
Bernie here can give him
a hand with props.

985
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,191
I'm retired.
I got out of the rat race...

986
00:54:32,265 --> 00:54:33,630
a long time ago, thank you.

987
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,964
Butch can help with camera,
me with lighting...

988
00:54:36,035 --> 00:54:38,003
- and Big John with grip.
- You betcha.

989
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:41,598
Oh, boy, does he have
the best crew in town.

990
00:54:41,674 --> 00:54:43,301
Well, the oldest crew, anyway.

991
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:45,071
[Laughter]

992
00:54:45,144 --> 00:54:46,509
The what?

993
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:50,345
And the only one
with a deaf sound mixer.

994
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:53,442
- [Laughter]
- Oh, I heard that.

995
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:56,010
Flash, I'm available.

996
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:57,681
Newsflash!

997
00:54:57,757 --> 00:54:59,952
So, who's the kid?

998
00:55:00,026 --> 00:55:01,550
CAMERON: We're just
doing research. You'll be fine.

999
00:55:01,627 --> 00:55:03,720
MICKEY: I don't know, Cameron.

1000
00:55:03,796 --> 00:55:05,593
It's cool. You'll be all right.

1001
00:55:05,665 --> 00:55:08,998
Eh, Flash said you were
a pushy little so-and-so.

1002
00:55:12,071 --> 00:55:14,869
Don't be afraid, Mickey.
It's only a computer.

1003
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:16,875
It's real easy, O. K?
Computers are really stupid.

1004
00:55:16,943 --> 00:55:18,274
They do exactly what
you tell them to.

1005
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:21,040
That's what I'm afraid of,
what to tell them.

1006
00:55:21,114 --> 00:55:23,639
No problemo.
Check it out, we can Google.

1007
00:55:23,716 --> 00:55:24,705
Google?

1008
00:55:25,585 --> 00:55:27,450
Yeah, a lot of bloggers Google.

1009
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,454
Bloggers that Google.

1010
00:55:29,522 --> 00:55:31,319
Or they Dogpile.

1011
00:55:31,391 --> 00:55:32,688
Dogpile.

1012
00:55:32,759 --> 00:55:35,922
Dogpile or a Hotbot
or Lycos, Linkslut...

1013
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:37,724
Ask Jeeves, Web Crawler.

1014
00:55:37,797 --> 00:55:39,321
You can always Yahoo.

1015
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:43,330
Yahoo... Tell me, son,
when do we get to the easy part?

1016
00:55:43,403 --> 00:55:45,303
Those are
just search engines here.

1017
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:47,305
Let's just Google.
Click on "search" right there...

1018
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:49,568
and now, type in
anything you want.

1019
00:55:49,642 --> 00:55:51,075
- Anything?
- Yeah, anything.

1020
00:55:51,144 --> 00:55:52,406
Think of something.

1021
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:53,467
Uh, fly fishing.

1022
00:55:54,213 --> 00:55:56,078
Type it in, "fly fishing."

1023
00:55:56,149 --> 00:55:57,548
[typing]

1024
00:55:59,585 --> 00:56:00,813
Yeah, now press "enter."

1025
00:56:03,222 --> 00:56:05,053
There it is.

1026
00:56:06,626 --> 00:56:07,854
- MICKEY: This is it?
- CAMERON: Yeah, yeah...

1027
00:56:07,927 --> 00:56:10,088
I'll be a striped-ass baboon.

1028
00:56:10,163 --> 00:56:11,596
[laughs]

1029
00:56:11,664 --> 00:56:12,824
Hey, well, what about tractors?

1030
00:56:12,899 --> 00:56:14,389
I've always
had a thing for tractors.

1031
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:15,798
Tractors, type it in.

1032
00:56:19,605 --> 00:56:23,006
This is wonderful. [Laughs]

1033
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:24,542
Here, check this out.
Check this out.

1034
00:56:37,156 --> 00:56:40,284
Thank you very much
for this, Cameron.

1035
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:42,725
It's... Thank you. That's nice.

1036
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:48,457
See, you haven't
been forgotten, Mickey.

1037
00:56:49,969 --> 00:56:52,733
D... D-Did you look up Flash?

1038
00:56:52,805 --> 00:56:55,137
Yeah, I showed him
his rsum and his credits.

1039
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,436
What'd he say?

1040
00:56:56,509 --> 00:56:59,103
"Yeah, big f-bomb deal."

1041
00:56:59,178 --> 00:57:00,475
[Laughs]
That sounds like Flash!

1042
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:04,073
[Chuckles] And wait, Mick,
go back to, go back to Google.

1043
00:57:05,618 --> 00:57:08,280
Click on search and type in
"Nursing home neglect."

1044
00:57:08,354 --> 00:57:10,481
[Typing]

1045
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:22,134
"Top 10 of 775,062 matches."

1046
00:57:22,201 --> 00:57:24,999
Yeah, try that...
Try that first one.

1047
00:57:29,275 --> 00:57:34,611
Does that mean there are

01:08:07,513 --> 01:08:08,502
"Finish the movie."

1221
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,639
We haven't even started
filming the movie...

1222
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:12,343
and with more bullshit
like you pulled last night...

1223
01:08:12,417 --> 01:08:13,611
we never will!

1224
01:08:13,685 --> 01:08:15,243
Well, that was my fault.

1225
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,685
Yeah, you're totally right.
It was your fault.

1226
01:08:16,755 --> 01:08:18,052
It was your bad.

1227
01:08:18,123 --> 01:08:22,025
Yeah, I know,
I know it was my b... bad.

1228
01:08:22,094 --> 01:08:23,925
It won't happen again.

1229
01:08:23,996 --> 01:08:25,827
I won't do it again.

1230
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:27,832
I just got pissed off.

1231
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,390
Pissed off about what?

1232
01:08:29,468 --> 01:08:31,800
- It's a long story.
- I got all winter.

1233
01:08:34,873 --> 01:08:39,776
Look, I gotta eat a shitload
of crow to get you your money.

1234
01:08:39,845 --> 01:08:43,542
A guy I haven't talked to for
some 40 years, a guy I hate...

1235
01:08:43,615 --> 01:08:45,549
You hate everybody.

1236
01:08:45,617 --> 01:08:47,278
But this
one's special vintage.

1237
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:49,514
So why can't we get
the money from somebody else?

1238
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:51,920
We can't, not...
not so quick, anyways.

1239
01:08:52,858 --> 01:08:55,622
O.K., Flash, you know
that so many people are in...

1240
01:08:55,694 --> 01:08:57,252
on this thing now,
that if you go off again...

1241
01:08:57,329 --> 01:08:58,990
it's not just me
you'll be letting down.

1242
01:08:59,064 --> 01:09:01,999
You think I don't know that?
Come on.

1243
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:03,796
CAMERON: O.K.,
when we started this thing...

1244
01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:05,166
you made me
make a promise to you.

1245
01:09:05,237 --> 01:09:07,102
Now you have to make
a promise to me.

1246
01:09:07,172 --> 01:09:09,299
FLASH: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I get it, I do, yeah, yeah.

1247
01:09:09,374 --> 01:09:10,363
CAMERON: No more drinking.

1248
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:12,433
No more drinking
till we're wrapped.

1249
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:22,346
The guy that pissed you off
lives here?

1250
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:23,410
Yup.

1251
01:09:24,089 --> 01:09:27,024
- What's his name?
- Taylor Moss.

1252
01:09:27,092 --> 01:09:28,081
Taylor Moss?

1253
01:09:29,695 --> 01:09:33,028
Taylor "Three-Time Academy
Award-Winning Producer" Moss?

1254
01:09:33,098 --> 01:09:34,087
FLASH: That's right.

1255
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:36,224
CAMERON: Jesus.

1256
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:39,065
What did Taylor Moss do
to piss you off so bad?

1257
01:09:39,137 --> 01:09:41,731
- He screwed my wife.
- What?

1258
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:43,365
MOSS' BUTLER ON INTERCOM:
May I help you, sir?

1259
01:09:43,442 --> 01:09:45,637
Yeah, we're here
to see Taylor Moss.

1260
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:47,804
BUTLER:
Whom shall I say is calling?

1261
01:09:47,879 --> 01:09:50,347
Calling? We're not calling.

1262
01:09:50,415 --> 01:09:52,849
We're here, standing...

1263
01:09:52,918 --> 01:09:55,011
waiting... on you.

1264
01:09:55,087 --> 01:09:56,782
BUTLER:
I do beg your pardon, sir.

1265
01:09:56,855 --> 01:09:58,789
Tell him it's Flash Madden.

1266
01:09:58,857 --> 01:10:01,052
Now, go get him.
Show some huevos.

1267
01:10:01,126 --> 01:10:03,822
Pretentious prick,
act like he got a butler.

1268
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:06,090
[Gate rattles...]

1269
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,731
Anyway, this guy Moss
not only screws my wife...

1270
01:10:11,803 --> 01:10:13,771
she runs off with him.

1271
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:15,101
What?

1272
01:10:15,173 --> 01:10:16,970
Broke my heart
in a million pieces.

1273
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:22,841
So where the hell is he?

1274
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:38,792
I don't believe my eyes.

1275
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:42,061
Well, if it ain't
Pancho "Oy Vey" Gonzales.

1276
01:10:42,134 --> 01:10:45,262
Oh, I see those standup
classes really paid off.

1277
01:10:45,337 --> 01:10:47,737
Up yours
and happy Hanukkah.

1278
01:10:47,806 --> 01:10:50,741
This here is Cameron.
He needs your help.

1279
01:10:50,809 --> 01:10:53,471
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Moss.

1280
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:55,505
Cameron.

1281
01:11:17,336 --> 01:11:19,133
CAMERON: So that's our story.

1282
01:11:19,204 --> 01:11:21,263
It's about $5,000 in hard costs.

1283
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,798
She died
a couple of years ago.

1284
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:24,864
FLASH: I heard.

1285
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,770
She was the greatest person
I ever knew.

1286
01:11:28,847 --> 01:11:31,782
[Chuckling]
Tell me something I don't know.

1287
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:35,217
Uh, I can see that you
really miss her.

1288
01:11:37,155 --> 01:11:39,646
MOSS: It was two years ago.

1289
01:11:39,725 --> 01:11:41,352
Seems like yesterday to me.

1290
01:11:45,397 --> 01:11:46,591
Cigar?

1291
01:11:46,665 --> 01:11:48,724
Eh, don't mind if I do.

1292
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:55,762
[Spits]

1293
01:11:57,342 --> 01:11:58,536
Cameron?

1294
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,170
Oh, no, thanks, sir.
I'll watch and learn.

1295
01:12:01,246 --> 01:12:03,180
FLASH: Thanks for the cigar...

1296
01:12:03,248 --> 01:12:05,478
but don't confuse it
with a calumet.

1297
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:06,539
CAMERON: A what?

1298
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:08,847
A peace pipe.

1299
01:12:11,323 --> 01:12:13,188
After forty years,
no forgiveness, huh?

1300
01:12:13,258 --> 01:12:14,555
Forty-three.

1301
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:16,457
Forgive you? Hey, screw you.

1302
01:12:19,064 --> 01:12:22,158
I'm sorry that your life
has been so, uh...

1303
01:12:22,234 --> 01:12:25,397
joyless, so unhappy, so sad.

1304
01:12:27,305 --> 01:12:29,296
Well, yours
is so fulfilled, right?

1305
01:12:29,374 --> 01:12:31,035
Don't confuse activity
with achievement.

1306
01:12:31,109 --> 01:12:34,044
I've seen those pieces of shit,
those celluloid abortions...

1307
01:12:34,112 --> 01:12:35,443
that you call movies.

1308
01:12:36,281 --> 01:12:38,078
Well, they weren't all stinkers.

1309
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:40,482
Even won
a couple of brass dolls.

1310
01:12:41,386 --> 01:12:42,375
Three of them.

1311
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:44,986
The picture business
has been good to me.

1312
01:12:45,056 --> 01:12:47,650
Oh, cut the bullshit.

1313
01:12:47,726 --> 01:12:50,718
That bullshit
is the reason you're here.

1314
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:57,101
Yeah, all right, yeah.
You made your point.

1315
01:12:59,438 --> 01:13:00,427
So...

1316
01:13:01,573 --> 01:13:04,337
do we get the five large
or not?

1317
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,170
Sure, Flash.

1318
01:13:11,616 --> 01:13:12,947
For old times' sake.

1319
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:21,884
Listen, I'm sorry I screwed up
your life, Flash.

1320
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,655
I didn't mean to
get you into all this.

1321
01:13:23,728 --> 01:13:25,787
A man has to kill
his own snakes.

1322
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:28,424
You did me a solid today, Flash.

1323
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,161
I owe you big time.

1324
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:34,337
Yeah, well, we'll cash
the check tomorrow...

1325
01:13:34,406 --> 01:13:37,136
and uh, don't you worry, kid.

1326
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:40,440
We'll get this epic of yours
on the road.

1327
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:54,458
[Sleigh bells jingling...]

1328
01:13:57,863 --> 01:13:59,728
MILDRED: Two of hearts.

1329
01:13:59,798 --> 01:14:02,790
Ace of diamonds... a bullet!

1330
01:14:03,835 --> 01:14:07,601
And jack of clubs...

1331
01:14:07,672 --> 01:14:09,003
WOMAN ON TV:
So this is Holiday Inn.

1332
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:10,905
[Flash turns off TV]

1333
01:14:27,759 --> 01:14:28,748
Well, I...

1334
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:32,423
I could say
that I got buttered...

1335
01:14:32,497 --> 01:14:36,297
that Wild Turkey
did most of the talking...

1336
01:14:36,368 --> 01:14:39,303
but you know, I, I...

1337
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:42,966
I've been hiding behind that
longer than I care to admit.

1338
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:48,643
Surprise, surprise.

1339
01:14:58,523 --> 01:15:00,855
I'm real sorry
about what I-I s...

1340
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,451
About last night.
I didn't mean what I said.

1341
01:15:04,529 --> 01:15:07,089
You're not forgotten souls.

1342
01:15:07,165 --> 01:15:09,497
You're not a bunch
of pathetic jerks.

1343
01:15:11,036 --> 01:15:13,300
Just me.

1344
01:15:23,682 --> 01:15:25,377
MAN: So?

1345
01:15:26,885 --> 01:15:31,015
Does that kid still want us
to make his movie or not?

1346
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:35,048
Well, we raised
a little money today...

1347
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:40,029
and it looks like we're back on
if-if... if you still wanna...

1348
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:42,889
Yes, Montana?

1349
01:15:43,835 --> 01:15:45,166
What time is call?

1350
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:48,404
Seven A.M., Monday morning.

1351
01:15:48,473 --> 01:15:50,498
- Then we're in.
- Vin!

1352
01:15:50,575 --> 01:15:53,271
- Why the hell not?!
- [All exclaim and applaud]

1353
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,681
I think you lot are insane.
All of you!

1354
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:03,414
Oh, goddamn it, you...
you folks are the best.

MILDRED: Goody goody!

1356
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:09,290
[Tearfully] That kid is so lucky
to have you on his team.

1357
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:11,522
Ah, it's your team too, Flash.

1358
01:16:11,596 --> 01:16:13,257
I guess I'm lucky, too.

1359
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:15,231
We're gonna make a movie!

1360
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,426
All right!

1361
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:17,490

[Flash sobs]

1363
01:16:21,473 --> 01:16:24,408
It's O.K. We love you, Flash.

1364
01:16:27,112 --> 01:16:29,137
CAMERON: Nursing home abuse
and neglect has become...

1365
01:16:29,214 --> 01:16:31,273
widespread
and a growing epidemic.

1366
01:16:31,349 --> 01:16:33,544
The last two to three years
have seen an increase...

1367
01:16:33,618 --> 01:16:35,586
in litigations
against nursing homes...

1368
01:16:35,654 --> 01:16:38,646
and rather sizeable verdicts
across the country.

1369
01:16:38,723 --> 01:16:41,283
As the population of the United
States gets older and older...

1370
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:44,192
more and more people end up
in nursing homes.

1371
01:16:44,963 --> 01:16:46,225
Moving a parent
to a nursing home...

1372
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:48,390
is one of life's
most difficult decisions.

1373
01:16:50,802 --> 01:16:52,702
[Keyboard clicking]

01:16:55,507 --> 01:16:57,236

700 cubic inches...

1375

- [Engine revs loudly]
- of fuel-lnjected fury!

1376
01:16:59,944 --> 01:17:03,471
It's the Fred Payne entry,
"Daddy-O", crushin' them buses.

1377
01:17:03,548 --> 01:17:05,675
In the near lane, we've got
Nicky's Nitro supercharged...

1378
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,844
small block, currently points
leader on the circuit...

1379
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,081

the giant against the giant killer!

more big block opponents...

1382
01:17:16,828 --> 01:17:18,489
this year than anyone else...

1383
01:17:18,563 --> 01:17:22,863
Thanks, honey.
I really appreciate that.

1384
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:25,926
I'm sorry for being
a pain in the butt.

1385
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:29,862
Um...

1386
01:17:31,209 --> 01:17:34,007
I mean, going to jail...
and the fight.

1387
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:36,070
Maybe you learned something
this time.

1388
01:17:36,915 --> 01:17:38,041

01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:36,184
that boy'll make you proud...

1736
01:35:38,729 --> 01:35:40,526
if you just give him a chance.

1737
01:35:44,468 --> 01:35:46,026
Huh?

1738
01:35:47,437 --> 01:35:48,426
Ah, come on.

[Choir singing faintly]

1740
01:35:54,545 --> 01:35:56,479
FLASH: Hey, Cameron...

1741
01:35:56,547 --> 01:35:59,516
we were just listing
your shortcomings.

1742
01:36:01,018 --> 01:36:02,315
I know, I gotta do better.

1743
01:36:02,386 --> 01:36:04,752
FLASH: Oh... my God.

1744
01:36:04,822 --> 01:36:06,551
Mother Kincaid...

1745
01:36:06,623 --> 01:36:09,820
what a culinary wizard
you turned out to be.

1746
01:36:09,893 --> 01:36:13,090
- Well, she's the best, right?
- She is.

1747
01:36:15,465 --> 01:36:16,932
Thank you, honey.

1748
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,797
Here, Floyd. Here you go.

1749
01:36:18,869 --> 01:36:21,838
Thank you.

1750
01:36:21,905 --> 01:36:24,305
So how's your movie coming?

1751
01:36:24,374 --> 01:36:25,898
Huh?

1752
01:36:25,976 --> 01:36:27,409
Oh...

1753
01:36:27,477 --> 01:36:30,810
It's good. We're editing now.

1754
01:36:30,881 --> 01:36:32,542
I'd like to see it.

1755
01:36:33,984 --> 01:36:35,781
Yeah, as soon as it's done.

1756
01:36:35,853 --> 01:36:37,480
JUD Y: I can't wait.

1757
01:36:37,554 --> 01:36:40,523
- Flash is the man.
- Ah.

1758
01:36:40,591 --> 01:36:42,525
I could not have done it
without this man here.

1759
01:36:42,593 --> 01:36:45,585
And the entire west wing of
the Motion Picture Residence.

Hey, the toast then, huh?

1762
01:36:55,272 --> 01:36:57,263
Let me think, let me think.

1763
01:36:58,108 --> 01:37:01,976
Even though we may fall
into misfortune...

1764
01:37:02,045 --> 01:37:05,208
um, still let us remember...

1765
01:37:05,282 --> 01:37:09,651
what it was once like here
when we were all together...

1766
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:12,416
united by a good
and kind feeling...

1767
01:37:14,324 --> 01:37:19,956
when we were perhaps
better than we are.

1768
01:37:21,031 --> 01:37:22,760
Um...

1769
01:37:24,468 --> 01:37:25,799
Yeah, that's, that's it.

[Choir singing,
glasses clinking]

1771
01:37:42,986 --> 01:37:45,716
See how Hitchcock only shoots
in singles in this scene?

1772
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:48,781
We never see
Barbara Bel Geddes...

1773
01:37:48,859 --> 01:37:50,793
or James Stewart
in the same shot.

1774
01:37:50,861 --> 01:37:52,726
We never feel we're, we're
watching from the outside.

1775
01:37:52,796 --> 01:37:54,730
We're involved.
We're in the scene.

1776
01:37:54,798 --> 01:37:56,698
It's like the actors
are talking to us.

1777
01:37:56,767 --> 01:37:59,065
I wake up at night seeing
that man fall from the roof...

1778
01:37:59,136 --> 01:38:01,502
and I try to reach out to him...

01:38:30,734 --> 01:38:32,258
I found wheelchairs
facing the windows...

1782
01:38:32,336 --> 01:38:34,327
This is great, Cameron.

1783
01:38:34,404 --> 01:38:37,032
- This is really great.
- Thanks.

they are forgotten in cages...

MOSS:
That's not the take I wanted.

1787
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:46,781
Yeah, I, um, I stuck with
this take because I thought...

1788
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:49,318
Put the take in
that I wanted, O. K?

1789
01:38:49,386 --> 01:38:50,683
I know what I'm doing.

1790
01:38:50,754 --> 01:38:51,743
CAMERON: You see how we're...

1791
01:38:51,822 --> 01:38:53,881
- pulling back and it flows...
- [Telephone ringing]

1792
01:38:53,957 --> 01:38:56,118
Just make the tweaks
I asked for...

1793
01:38:56,193 --> 01:38:58,320
and it'll be ready
to be submitted.

MICKEY: Today is the day.
Uh, in by 5:00...

1795
01:39:00,597 --> 01:39:02,724
- no exceptions.
- No problemo.

from Chatsworth High School...

[?...]

1850
01:46:04,788 --> 01:46:06,722
CAMERON: Brett Raven
won the scholarship.

1851
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:08,052
Not a big deal.

1852
01:46:08,124 --> 01:46:09,785
This is my film school.

1853
01:46:10,727 --> 01:46:13,662
I learned more in a month
than he will in a lifetime.

1854
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:15,095
And Flash was right.

1855
01:46:15,165 --> 01:46:17,565
Nietzsche was full of shit
most of the time.

1856
01:46:17,634 --> 01:46:19,829
There are no expendable masses
in the world.

1857
01:46:19,903 --> 01:46:21,564
Every person matters.

1858
01:46:21,638 --> 01:46:25,039
What we do, who we are
can affect a generation.

1859
01:46:26,109 --> 01:46:27,906
It's not the strength...

1860
01:46:27,977 --> 01:46:29,638
but the duration
of great sentiments...

1861
01:46:29,712 --> 01:46:31,043
that makes great men.

1862
01:46:31,714 --> 01:46:33,705
Nietzsche got that one right.
