Boy, talk about

I'd give anything if
only I could become

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,400
a real live boy
like that pinocchio.

00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Aah!

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,720
Is that what
you wish for

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,640
above all other things,
dear spot?

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,320
Oh, yes,
dear blue fairy.

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,160
Being a real
live boy

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,600
is the most
important thing

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,720
in the whole
wide world to me.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,680
Then close your eyes
very tightly,

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,240
dear spot,

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,400
and wish for it
with all your heart.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,680

(Man's Voice)
I ain't no fairy!

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,320
And it's time to get up.

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,520
Sorry, pretty boy.

39
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,200
It's just that
I was having

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,520
the most
wonderful dream.

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
Him with the dream again.

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,520
It's not enough
you dress up like a boy

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
and go to that
cockamamie school every day!

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,640
No. "I want to be a boy.
I want to be a boy."

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,400
Well, wise up, pupchik!

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I want to be a rooster
in a henhouse,

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,200
but I don't see it
happenin'!

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,520
Although I'd be
a darn good one,

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,720
wouldn't I,
Mr. Jolly?

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,640
Ohhh...la.
It's a bit early in the day

51

speculations,

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
but...you? A rooster?

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,280
(Laughs)

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,600
It is to laugh.

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,560
Who asked you,
tuna breath?

56
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
You're still in bed?!

57
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,760
Come on, get up.
You don't want to be late

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,560
for the last day
of school, do you?

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,600
And ruin my perfect
attendance record?

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,280
I don't think so.

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,440
for hacking into

181
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,880
That's why I'm glad
I'm a principal.

182
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,840
None of this messy
student/teacher involvement.

183
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,680
They grow, they leave--
good riddance.

184
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,680
But I suppose it is
just that sort of

186
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,640

Oh, come on,

Don't give me

221
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,640
They're the only eyes
I got, leonard.

222
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,040
The eyes of a dog--

223
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,040
a dog who's not
going anywhere.

224
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,640
Just staying home...
(Sniffle)

225

226
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,800
Here...alone!

227
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,040
The dog.

228
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
But you're not
going to be alone.

229
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,000
You've got pretty boy
and jolly,

230
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,880
and Mrs. Boogin's the nicest
pet-sitter in the whole world.

231
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,000
And besides,
it's only for 2 weeks.

232
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,680
Yeah, in boy-time, 2 weeks,

233
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,960
but everything in dog-time
is 7 times longer,

234
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,760
so for me it's 14 weeks.

235
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,960
(Sighs) It might
as well be forever.

236
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Man, this really stinks.

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,200
You should smell it

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,040

355
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,320
Oh, you want to play
that game. Ha ha ha!

356
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,200
All righty, I spy
with my little eye--

357
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
spot!

358
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,840
No, come on, honey,

359
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,280
spot can't be
the answer every time.

360
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,080
(Dramatic Music playing)

361
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,360
(Vroom)

362
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,960
(Chomp)

363
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,080
Mom, you gotta stop!

364
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,520
Ooh, ooh, you're right.
We do. We need gas.

365
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,120
(Screech)

366
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,920
(Cawing)

367
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,080
Ok, you fill 'er up, sweetie.
I've got to go powder my nose.

368
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,400
Cleanliness is next
to godliness,

369
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,120
but gas station
bathrooms are not.

370
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,200
Spot? Spot?
Where are you?

371
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,400
(Gasps)

372
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,400
(Vroom)

373
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,040
(Crying)
Oh, no...

374
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
Lose something, bunky?

375
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,160
Spot! Ha!

376
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,920
You're ok!
I can't believe it!

377
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,920
What are you
doing here?

378
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,560
I had to come, lenny!
How could I stay away?

379
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,520
I just love you so much

380
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,080
and wanted to be
with you so bad.

381
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,440
A friend needs a friend.

382
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,480
(Crying)
A boy needs a dog.

383
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,000
Ok, I also need
a lift to Florida

384
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,320
for my own self-serving
reasons, but why spoil

385
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,400
this beautiful moment
with that?

386
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,960
I love ya!
I want to be with ya!

387
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,160
Mmm, give us
another hug!

388
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, spot, good ol' boy!

389
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,560
Hey, wait a second.
Are you crazy?

390
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,160
You heard what
principal strickler said

391
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,480
about no dogs
in his wentawaygo.

392
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,200
And here comes
my mom right now!

393
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,040
What are
we gonna do, spot?

394
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,200
Spot?

395
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,040
Did you
just say spot?

396
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,200
No, Mrs. Helperman,
he said scott!

397
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,080
As in
scott leadready ii,

398
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,320
your old pal
from back home!

399
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,600
Who'da thunk it and
fancy meeting me here.

400
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,200
He's good.

401
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,560
Oh, scott,
I've missed you.

402
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,320
Really, Mrs. H?
How much?

403
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
Enough to take me on
the rest of your trip

404
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,160
to sunny southern
Florida? Heh heh!

405
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,160
Could we, mom?

406
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,560
Well, of course not, honey.

407
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,480
Scott's obviously
traveling with his family.

408
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,360
What family?
Oh! My family!

409
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,480
Sure, I'm traveling
with my family.

410
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,480
My whole family--
mom, sis, grandma,

411
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
uncle jojo,
the ventriloquist,

412
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,040
his dummy floyd--

413
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
my family!
Ooh, I love 'em!

414
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,120
I love 'em,
but darn the luck,

415
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,120
wouldn't you know,

416
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,240
they can't
go to Florida,

417
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
because--
because why?

418
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,320
There's been
an emergency?

419
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,200
Good. I mean,
it's a good emergency.

420
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,080
The kind where
they all have to go home,

421
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,080
but I can still
go to Florida with you.

422
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,280
Which is the good part,

423
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,200
so, come on,
let's hit the road!

424
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,080
Well, hmm, I'd certainly
need to discuss it

425
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,360
with your mother first.

426
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,240
Oy, you don't
make this easy.

427
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,080
She'll meet you
right over there.

428
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,520
<i>She just, uh,</i>
<i>has to get dressed.</i>

429
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,520
(Rattling)

430
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,520
(Whoosh)

431
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,120
Ooh, jeez!

432
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,480
What I have to go through
to become a real live boy!

433
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,160
Ooh!

434
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,480
<i>Spot:</i>
<i>Why, mary lou helperman!</i>

435
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,160
<i>Hello and halleloo!</i>

436
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,440
Ha ha ha!

437
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,080
If you weren't just
sent from heaven above

438
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,640
to take our dear
little scott to flor--

439
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Mrs. Leadready,

440
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,160
but do you want to hear
the funniest thing?

441
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,360
I brought that exact
same dress on this trip.

442
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,560
Oh, that is funny.
You're a stitch!

443
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,680
Anyway,
back to poor scott.

444
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
He so desperately
wants to go to Florida.

445
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,440
And I believe I packed that
same shade of lipstick, too!

446
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
Really?
What a coinkidink!

447
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,560
Anyway,
as I was saying--

448
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,240
and those earrings
look awfully familiar.

449
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,440
Are you gonna take him
or not?! Darlin'.

450
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,040
Well, gee,

451
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,480
shouldn't we check with
the rest of your family?

452
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,360
Oy. The rest of my--

453
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,680
I'll see
who's round the corner!

454
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
Yeah, yeah,
I tell ya--

455
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,360
thanks, gals.

456
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,360
(Lisping) Missus,
please take scott

457
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,320
to sunny
southern Florida,

458
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,160
so I can
have some peace

459
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,280
from all his
merciless teasing!

460
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,320
Young lady, I missed
my chance to see Florida

461
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,320
when I was the boy's age,

462
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,520
and look what a bitter old
woman I turned out to be!

463
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,720
You must be scott's--

464
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,600
I can't talk to you!
I'm too bitter!

465
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,480
(Irish Accent)
Hoity-toity-toity-toity-toi.

466
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,200
An' 'tis wishin' I am
that some fine soul

467
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,680
would take me scotty boy
to Florida.

468
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,720
Uncle jojo
the ventriloquist?

469
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,720
'Tis!

470
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,200
And where's
your dummy floyd?

471
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,440
Great St. Patty's
shillelagh!

472
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,360
The little leprechaun must
be around here somewhere.

473
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,320
Ok, you be floyd.

474
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,520
Me? I don't know
what to do!

475
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,760
Just shut up
and act dumb!

476
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
What?
Perfect!

477
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,560
Mrs. Helperman,

478
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,200
Take our scott, please!

479
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,720
Oh, ha ha ha! Ohh,
leonard's gotta see this.

480
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,640
Where'd he go?
And where's scott?

481
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,320
Oh, I'll find 'em,

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,200

483
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,720
to fair Florida.

484
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,280
Well, of course,
I'll take him!

485
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
I've been planning
to take him all along.

486
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,200
And you couldn't
have just said that

487
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
to the lady in
the flowery dress?

488
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,800
Saints preserve us!
Say good-bye, floyd!

489
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,440
Top o'
the mornin' to ya!

490
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,400
Hey, I do the cliched
irish dialogue around here.

491
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,560
So, whassup?
So, whassup?

492
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,280
Well, scott, it looks like

493
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,840
you're coming with us
to Florida!

494
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,400
Yes!
Yes!

495
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,560
I'm on my way
to Florida!

496
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Come on, everyone!
Time's a-wastin'!

497
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,720
Let's hit the road
and sing a song about it!

498
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,440
What is it with
this family and singing?

499
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm starting to feel
von trapped.

is it really necessary

Yes, we may be

The one that's
finally going to work!

760
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,240
Dare you torment

761
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,920
You cannot help me!
Aah!

762
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,320
You're nothing but
a worthless boy!

763
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,480
You're wrong, Dr. Krank.

764
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,120
I am a dog who wants
to be a worthless boy.

765
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,240
I mean, who wants

767
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,040
Good lord,
I was totally fooled.

768
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
Don't worry.
Happens all the time.

769
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,480
Now, here's your problem
as I see it, doc.

770
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,120
While your theories
are scientifically sound

771
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,280
and your equipment
technically flawless,

772
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,320
you keep hitting
a failure point

773
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,200
when it comes
to the selection

774
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,400
of your
subjects.

775
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,360
See, you've been
experimenting

776
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,240
on swamp
creatures,

777
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,400
insects, and,
uh, reptiles.

778
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,280
And all-ee-gators!

779
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,280
All-ee-gators
<i>are</i> reptiles.

780
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,400
Proceed.

781
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,280
Mm-hmm. But
the fact is, Dr. Krank,

782
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,160
if you want
to make a man,

783
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,000
you've got to start
with a mammal!

784
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,120
Yes. Of course.
It's so simple,

785
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,240
and yet so utterly
brilliant!

786
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,520
Ha ha ha!

787
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,360
(Sighs)
I wish I had a nickel

788
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,280
for every time
I've heard that.

789
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,960
I shall give you
a nickel...

790
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,520
If you will be
my mammal.

791
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,520
I'll take it!

792
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,120
Then I shall
make you a boy.

793
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,480
Oh, boy!

794
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,160
Oh, no!

795
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,440

00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,320
traveling around
the world with me

885
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,240
as living proof
of my genius!

886
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,200
Ah. Well, uh, gee,

887
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,680
fun as that sounds
for me,

888
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to pass.

889
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
I can't spend the rest
of my life with you.

890
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
I--i--i live
with this guy...

891
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,760
At his house, in his room.

892
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,520
I sleep on the bottom bunk.

893
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,280
Heh. Although, now that
I'm a big, grown man

894
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,240
with knuckle hair and--
uhh--lower back pain,

895
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,680
that may present
a slight problem.

896
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,400
But we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

897
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,440
Let's go, leonard!

898
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,560

Come, dennis, adele!

905

watching the news with her?

it's terrible.

1583

about if
you can't be his dog,

1585
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,840
then he'll have to get
that Dr. Krank

1586
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,920
to turn him
into your dog.

1587

It's all my fault.

1614
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,000

messed with nature.

Oh, that is just wrong
on so many levels.

1619

this, Dr. Krank.
