1 
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,267
[Bull shit]
-  Language, Duncan.

2 
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,901
Whatever, fine.
Me and my bad attitude are outta here.

3 
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,834
That's fine with me.

4 
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:03,267
[Frustration]

5 
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:10,101
How do you like ... THAT!

6 
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:12,767
[Falls] Uhh.

7 
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,334
[Background music...]

8 
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:52,201
[Door opens] After you....
- Thanks.
See you next week.

9 
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:54,301
[Expletive]  Finally.

10 
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:59,467
Wait wait.  Duncan..it's me, Duncan.  
[Jake:] It's my brother, it's Duncan.

11 
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:00,867
What are you doing out here?

12 
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:02,967
Geez, you scared the piss out of me.

13 
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:04,367
It's my apartment.

14 
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:09,567
Hey, Wonder Woman,
Could you point that somewhere else please?
 ... Thank you.

15 
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,234
Sandy, why don't you go
warm up the car, okay?

16 
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:15,501
You'll be safe, I'll watch you. I promise.
- Okay, but watch close.
Okay.

17 
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,267
She seems nice.

18 
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:33,000
And vigilant.

19 
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:35,901
I'm sure your wife would like her.

20 
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:37,734
Why do you always do that?

21 
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:41,201
What happened to work?
Did you get fired again?

22 
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:46,601
I was just ... why do you always do that?
- Jesus you got fired again.
  You've only been there a couple of weeks.

23 
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:48,334
God, you are such an incompetent.

24 
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:50,567
Come on, cut me some slack, Jake.

25 
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:52,801
I haven't asked you for money in a long time.

26 
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:55,867
Yeah but I've given you plenty.  I've left
a little something on the table tonight.

27 
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:59,801
That doesn't count.  You think you're doing me
a favor by bringing all these bimbos here?

28 
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:01,267
Go screw 'em somewhere else.

29 
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,567
Alright, quit being a dick.
  Do you want some capital or not?

30 
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:04,967
No, actually.

31 
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,567
I'm fine.
I'll ... work it out.

32 
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:09,467
[Horn honks]

33 
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,401
Sheez, the shit I put up with.

34 
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,234
Just let me know if you need some cash okay?

35 
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:18,101
And go visit grandma and grampa's new place.
They've been asking about you.

36 
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:23,367
Eh, I dunno I got a lot of stuff to do.
- Yeah I know you're a really busy guy
but maybe you could squeeze in

37 
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,501
ten minutes of your hectic
unemployed schedule and go see 'em.

38 
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,801
I just don't like to see 'em like that.

39 
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:32,367
It doesn't matter dude.
It's why they moved to the city,
to be close to us.

40 
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:37,667
Pull your head out. Take the fifty I left you,
get grandma a coffee cake and get your ass over there.

41 
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:39,201
See ya.

42 
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:45,267
What am I, made of money?

43 
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:52,601
[Background music...]

44 
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:44,701
[Background music]

45 
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,867
Jesus Dunc, how many jobs is that?

46 
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,501
Why, you writing my resume?
Do you even have a resume?

47 
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:00,834
Is that how you landed that great gig
as piss boy at the paint store?

48 
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,401
What about your office?
Got any jobs there?

49 
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:07,967
Oh please, come on. Even the guys in
the mailroom have a college degree.
[Hey Lindy.]

50 
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,467
Besides you don't work there.
Eveyone's an asshole.

51 
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,734
Including you? 
- Especially me.

52 
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,434
Maybe Finn can give you a job
at the warehouse, huh?

53 
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,567
Finn! Would you want to work for Finn?

54 
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,534
The predominant majority of jobs
here are union, Dunc.

55 
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,267
I'm totally union.
I'm like Norma fuckin' Rae.

56 
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,101
It's a grand to join.
You have to apprentice for six months.

57 
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,101
Apprentice what, it's a forklift.

58 
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:33,201
It's like a golf cart
with the lifting thing on front.

59 
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,034
It's not that easy.

60 
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,801
Well, you do it.
[Slams on brakes, Duncan falls off.]

61 
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,867
Oops. Okay, very funny.

62 
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,734
Yeah.

63 
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,334
Nice!

64 
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:46,901
I don't think you appreciate the
precariousness of the situation here.

65 
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:50,601
If you hurt yourself,
if you break something,
that's a liability.

66 
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,567
Yeah, precariousness?

67 
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,134
You realize that you sound like Don King
when you use big words, Finn?

68 
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:59,834
And, come on,
it's moving boxes of liquor.

69 
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:01,201
I think I can handle that.

70 
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,801
You know something Dunc, the
last time I gave you a job [muffled].

71 
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,967
Jesus we were seventeen,
we were mowing lawns.

72 
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:11,167
I know that, okay?
And you mowed the word asshole into
somebody's lawn and I got fired, Dunc.

73 
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,167
I got fired.

74 
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,234
Whatever happened to your sense of humor?
And that was a long time ago.

75 
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,901
Well what have you been doing
with your life since then?

76 
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:22,601
I've been working my ass off
trying to improve my status quo.

77 
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,134
Why would I just give you a job?

78 
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:33,301
I don't know.
I do appreciate how hard you had
to work here at Finn and Son, Finn.

79 
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:38,401
But I was hoping that maybe
you would have my back on this.

80 
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:45,067
Nah, no Doug, I can't.  I'm sorry.

81 
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,401
Don't kick it.
- I didn't do anything.

82 
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:57,134
[Background music]

83 
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:13,734
But he sees me in the hall with the thing,
and he says to me that's not how you do it.

84 
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:22,301
So I says back "Well Christ."
How do you do it,
you saw dog midget half-wit?

85 
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,634
Ronald, you did not say that to him.

86 
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,667
I'm telling this story, Ruth.

87 
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,067
Mmm.  So tell it right.

88 
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:35,467
I bet ten years ago
you had to set him straight, grampa.

89 
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,501
Damn right, Duncan.

90 
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:38,601
Damn right.

91 
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:45,434
I may be old, but
I still got my two friends,
my left fist and my right.

92 
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:51,334
It's too bad your old pal
common sense left so long ago.

93 
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:56,767
Ten years!
Duncan, I was going to call you on Monday.

94 
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,101
Did you remember that?

95 
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:01,334
Yeah, yeah.

96 
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:03,901
I saw it on the calendar.

97 
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,601
How's the shoe store, kiddo?

98 
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:09,734
The shoe store?

99 
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:13,467
Jacob says he's working in groceries.

100 
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:15,467
Yeah, I was.

101 
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,334
I was, for about three months.

102 
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,067
Groceries.

103 
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:23,534
That's not a good racket.
Markups no good.

104 
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:27,334
You know, I should probably get going.

105 
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,867
I've just got a bunch of stuff
I should be doing today.

106 
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,667
You do not. You just got here.

107 
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:36,101
You haven't even seen the view.

108 
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,667
Come see the view.
 - Yeah.

109 
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:47,467
See?

110 
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,101
That's beautiful. You've got
both the downtowns and a river.

111 
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:52,101
Yeah.

112 
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:55,334
At night, can see the northern lights.

113 
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:00,834
Really, the northern lights?
Seen 'em last night, dancin'.

114 
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,767
That's funny, I didn't know [...].
- Ronald, did you go yet today?

115 
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:07,467
Didn't I go, Ruth?

116 
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:12,134
Well, I know, but you have to be
 on a schedule with this medication.
 It's your kidneys.

117 
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:13,267
Okay.

118 
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:18,934
Alright, get up now.  One..two.
- No need Duncan, we got a system.
[Up]

119 
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:22,834
Well that was slitch.
(archaic: slide + pitch)

120 
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:26,434
Grampa's little helper.
You remember that, Ruth?
- Yep.

121 
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:31,967
You used to follow me around the hardware
store all day long trying to help.

122 
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,201
You look like your dad.

123 
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:41,967
So do you.

124 
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,967
I'm better lookin' than he ever was.

125 
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:50,667
Grampa's little helper.

126 
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,000
Well yell if you need some assistance.

127 
00:10:59,134 --> 00:11:00,267
Assistance?

128 
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:02,934
Taking a leak for Christ sakes.

129 
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:07,701
That's where grampa's little helper
draws the line okay? [Laughs]

130 
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,101
Excuse me.

131 
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:31,101
Could I get an application?
- We're out.  Waiting for the
printer to send more, about a week.

132 
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,667
Just need your name and address,
I can send you one then.

133 
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:38,334
So this is the admission forms desk
and you're out of admission forms.

134 
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:48,367
Great.

135 
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:55,134
[Background music]

136 
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:12,301
[Phone rings]

137 
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:13,867
Hello?

138 
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,034
Hey, good morning.

139 
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,034
Well what sort of situation?

140 
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:24,634
Did you call 911?

141 
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:29,034
Grampa, if you're having an
emergency you call 911.

142 
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:31,734
Okay I'll be right here.

143 
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,234
Grampa?
- In here.

144 
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:41,134
You Okay?
- You need to get this out
into the other room.

145 
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,667
What? The TV?
- Yeah yeah, this is what I need.

146 
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:46,867
You gotta slide it out there.

147 
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,101
I thought that you were hurt.
- I said emergency and it is.  Come on.

148 
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,067
Let's get the goddamn thing outta here.

149 
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:58,767
No no don't. You don't take off your coat.
You don't have time. She'll be back any minute now.

150 
00:12:59,034 --> 00:12:59,434
I'm baking in this thing.

151 
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,567
Hurry.
- I'll have it done in a second.

152 
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,501
Ronald, I'm home.

153 
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:05,801
Oh Christ.

154 
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,967
No matter now, Duncan [mumbles].

155 
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:11,601
Ronald, you know Kate's gonna be here.
You're gonna need to get cleaned up.

156 
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:13,667
Duncan, hi!

157 
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,467
Ronald!
- I was just having the kid
 move some things.

158 
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,167
No TV, you know that.
- Ruth.

159 
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,334
Why can't he have the TV?

160 
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:29,567
Because he'll just sit and watch it and do not
another damn thing.  It mushes his brain.

161 
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,634
Load of shit.

162 
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,000
[Knocking at door]

163 
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,901
Listen, would you get the door?

164 
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:36,167
We'll be out in a minute.

165 
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:47,601
Ronald, don't you bring him into this now.

166 
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:48,701
He wanted to help.

167 
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:52,334
Nothing wrong with a kid helping out his grandfather.

168 
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:53,834
[Knocking at door]

169 
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,667
[Door opens]
Um, am I in the right place?

170 
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:00,967
Yeah, the Shorters, Ruth and Ronald.

171 
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:05,701
I'm Duncan.
- Oh, I'm the home assistant. Kate.

172 
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,534
Hi.
- Hi.

173 
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:11,667
Is that Kate?
- Yeah it's me, Ruthie.

174 
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:21,767
How ya feeling today, Ronnie?
You're runnin' a little hot, your pressure's up.

175 
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:23,667
It's cause you're here.

176 
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:28,267
His pressure's up because he was up to no good.
- Shit.

177 
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:30,734
Follow the light.

178 
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,101
Follow.

179 
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,634
And who is the president?

180 
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:40,701
That slick dickweed in the suit.

181 
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:42,901
I didn't vote for him.

182 
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,467
And what's his name?
- Hmm?

183 
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,134
The dickweed.  What's his name?

184 
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:56,767
Bob Hope.

185 
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,067
Ronald, what's his name?

186 
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,067
Duncan, who's the president?

187 
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,134
It's Bing Crosby.

188 
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:07,067
[Laughs]

189 
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:10,934
For God's sake.
- That's my grandson.

190 
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,334
He's a good'un.
- Yeah.

191 
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:15,401
Best hockey player you ever seen.

192 
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,901
Skates like a goddamn Canuck.

193 
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:21,167
Good lookin' to boot.
- You're blushing.

194 
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:23,767
His grandfather's embarrassing him.

195 
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:30,834
Duncan?
- That's okay.

196 
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:31,634
I got him.

197 
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,167
He's a good one.

198 
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,801
Always there to help his grandfather.

199 
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:43,467
Okay, well I'll see you next week.

200 
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:44,367
Okay.

201 
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:46,301
Bye, Duncan.

202 
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:12,234
[Lady drops groceries]

203 
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:13,767
Oh, oh my.

204 
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:17,367
Let me get this for you.

205 
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:20,334
[Grunts] 
Oh, thanks!

206 
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:21,534
Thank you so much.

207 
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,534
Thank you.

208 
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:39,834
Bye.
- Bye.

209 
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:47,734
Can you patch a wall?

210 
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, I've been known to spackle.

211 
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,101
You ever go to jail?

212 
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:53,801
You steal?
- [Shakes head "no"]

213 
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:59,000
No sir, but if I was a thief
I'd probably also be a liar.

214 
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,267
So it's kind of hard to trust
a guy either way, isn't it.

215 
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,534
[Laughs]  True, really true.

216 
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:11,467
I've had a bit of a checkered
employment history but I need this job.

217 
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:16,434
For more than just me. I need to be in this
building and I promise you I will work my ass off.

218 
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,867
A promise from a thief and a liar?

219 
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:21,867
Okay.

220 
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:28,267
Tomorrow. Eight. Do not be late.
The guy before, always late.

221 
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,667
Sorry, my bad.

222 
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:47,801
[Trying to start car]
[Horns honking.  Drivers yelling.]

223 
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:51,967
Hey Stu. 
- Hey numnuts.

224 
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,601
Whoa, whoa, stinky!

225 
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:01,567
Holy balls, the battery melted.  Must have
fallen off when you stomped on the brakes.

226 
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,501
See?

227 
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:06,567
Two posts hit the metal on the hood,
then POW!

228 
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:11,134
What do you mean, POW? It's a brand new battery.
- Don't I know it, I sold it to you.

229 
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:11,934
At cost.

230 
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:19,234
You didn't attach those two brackets I gave you,
did you.  They're to keep the battery in place, dipshit.

231 
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:22,634
Well you never told me that did you.
- Telling you now.

232 
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,567
I'll nose around and see if you didn't
smoke up the electricals too bad.

233 
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:38,434
Not that I want to make
 your car my life's work.

234 
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:40,034
Ah, you lack vision, Stu.

235 
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:42,801
Yeah but you gotta find something new.

236 
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:46,534
I can't afford something new. I
can't even afford to fix that piece.

237 
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:50,301
Yeah, we'll see what we can work out.
Maybe I can get you to plow for me.

238 
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:52,034
But, um...

239 
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,967
I'm just glad to help out.

240 
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,367
You know that was ten years ago?

241 
00:18:58,567 --> 00:18:59,601
What's that?

242 
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,934
It's been ten years since dad died.
This week.

243 
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:04,567
Ten years?

244 
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,267
Oh man.

245 
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:11,000
I was thinking about him this weekend
watching the blow-job Vikings.

246 
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:18,367
God, he used to hate it when they'd try to
make a field goal from the one yard line.
He'd fucking scream out: ONE YARD?

247 
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:21,467
Give it to me I'll carry it three fuckin' feet.

248 
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,101
Drive me fuckin' nuts.

249 
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:27,801
Yeah.

250 
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,167
Anyway, thanks for the ride. 
- See you.
[Door closes]

251 
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:43,467
Did you want to make out with me?
- Hey, don't hit on the redhead.
  I don't appreciate it.

252 
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:47,334
[Yo Judas. Hey Arnold.]
[What's happenin' ladies.]

253 
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:48,934
So you win tonight?

254 
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,467
Not with that woman Hacksetter at goal.

255 
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,101
Hey hey hey

256 
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:58,267
You know I've seen better
hands on a snake.

257 
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:02,801
Where were you? We needed you.
  They killed us man, they literally killed us.

258 
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,801
You literally got killed.
That's interesting.

259 
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,401
You know Finn, maybe you shouldn't
use words that you don't understand.

260 
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:10,467
Hey, dumb ass, I didn't mean
literally as in "literally."

261 
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,934
Well, how else could you possibly
mean it, college boy?

262 
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,967
Oh, oh college boy.

263 
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,501
Do you want a little of this ... ?

264 
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:23,234
... literally ...

265 
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:26,901
Knock it off you hooligans.
Hey stop it.

266 
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,967
What is this crap?
How am I supposed to pommel him to this?

267 
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,000
Sorry, that was uncalled for.
I apologize.

268 
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:43,501
[background singing]
"so all worthwhile"

269 
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:47,067
What's with the singing?
- It's Hack's new scam.
  [It's hard]

270 
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:53,934
He plays this song and then he tells people
that his wife just left him and that
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was her favorite show.

271 
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,534
Guarantees some poor slob buys him a drink.

272 
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:59,367
Every time.
- So then, Hacksetter is actually
a horrible human being.

273 
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:01,501
Oh, a horrible human being by all accounts.

274 
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,667
[Toast] To horrible human beings.

275 
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:08,634
But at least that horror showed up to the game.
- Where were you, dipstick?
We needed you man. We had six.

276 
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:14,401
No subs, no subs.
And chunky butt here's not in good shape.
- Don't call me chunky.
  ... cry about it later fatty.

277 
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:19,334
I got stuck at my grandparents' place
and my goddamn car broke down again.

278 
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:23,601
Christ almighty on a crutch, would
you please just buy a new one already.

279 
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:24,601
With what, Finn?

280 
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:30,000
Get a job, fuckup.
- Uh, I got a job but now I don't
have a car to get me to the job.

281 
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:36,101
Wait, what, what, what? You have a job?
Oh my God, you sellout, what are you doing?

282 
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:40,967
Well, you know, I'm gonna be working at an
apartment building. Going to be a maintenance man.

283 
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,534
What, like handyman?

284 
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:48,634
Like, a ... tool belt, like that guy Schneider
on the TV show, "Hey Miss Romano"?

285 
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,867
Unbelievable.
That works every time.

286 
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:53,734
Shit, that was fast.

287 
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:56,434
Like under two minutes, man.

288 
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:59,934
A record.
- Hey Lindy, can you give me
  a ride to work tomorrow?

289 
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:04,101
Hell no. That's like 10 minutes out
of my way, 20 minutes during rush hour.

290 
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,734
You don't even know where he works.

291 
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:07,334
That's not the point.

292 
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:14,000
Come on man.  Don't make me fight the
bus. Now I've gotta figure out the
fares and schedule and the transfers and

293 
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:16,801
[mumbling]

294 
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:20,601
Why not do what you normally do.
Don't show up and get fired
and whine about it.

295 
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:22,701
Nope, I actually need this job.

296 
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:25,967
Then you better get on the bus, Gus.

297 
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:39,634
Okay, you knock.

298 
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,167
Why me?

299 
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:47,134
She's crazy.  She do not answer door
if a black man knocks. You knock.

300 
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:53,801
[Knocks] Who is it?

301 
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,501
Maintenance.

302 
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:00,401
Two of you.

303 
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:05,901
I don't like that.
I don't like that one bit.

304 
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:08,134
I'm watching you.

305 
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:11,101
Oh boy.

306 
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:13,967
Ronald, did you hear that?

307 
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:18,534
Duncan is now working in the
building. He started this morning.

308 
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:19,467
The building?

309 
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,067
He works at the bank.
- No, that's Jake, grampa.

310 
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,000
Jacob works in the bank.
I'm going to be a handyman here.

311 
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:29,567
Handy man.

312 
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:34,034
You don't even know the difference
between hammers, do you?

313 
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,334
Are you kidding, I worked for you
all those summers.

314 
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:39,034
You don't know a hammer from your dick.

315 
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,201
Ronald!

316 
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:43,134
Don't worry, I know my hammers, old man.

317 
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:47,934
Then can grab me a ball peen
from my toolbox.

318 
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:50,267
It's under the sink.

319 
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,301
Sure, sure I'll be right back.

320 
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,801
No, make that a claw, wise-ass.

321 
00:23:58,534 --> 00:23:58,901
[Laughs]

322 
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,767
Come on, honey, let's do this.
See?

323 
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:27,367
That's not a claw.

324 
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:30,901
Oh, yeah it is.

325 
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:33,034
Is it good?

326 
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,701
Let me see it.

327 
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:38,801
Ruth?
- [mmm?]

328 
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:41,434
Cover your eyes.

329 
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:44,334
What?
- Cover your eyes.

330 
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:49,701
[Groans]  Ronald.

331 
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:54,601
What a mess.
- The ball's there.

332 
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:57,167
[Laughs]

333 
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,801
[Loud music]
Do you want a ride?

334 
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:17,967
Okay.

335 
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:22,434
Thanks.

336 
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:26,334
What's wrong with him?

337 
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:32,234
Well, he's got Parkinson's and the kidney
problems and his heart is a little shaky.

338 
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:36,734
But your grandma's main concern
is that he might have the A-bomb.

339 
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:39,501
Alzheimer's?

340 
00:25:40,134 --> 00:25:42,301
Yeah, she wants me to keep an eye on it.

341 
00:25:42,434 --> 00:25:44,034
Apparently he had a brother who had it.

342 
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:45,801
Yeah, Sterling.

343 
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:51,134
But he was one of those crazy northwood
types to begin with so when he lost his
mind it wasn't all that easy to tell.

344 
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,334
You know I just mostly [Whoa]

345 
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,734
What are you doing?
- Alright, I got it.
  I can drive with my knee.

346 
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:02,667
You've never seen that before?
Look. I'm turning.
Well, I need to turn here.

347 
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:06,967
Yeah with hands.
- I just think he's more
  depressed than anything.

348 
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:07,501
You know?

349 
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,901
But he talks about you a lot.

350 
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:12,567
Don't believe anything that's
coming out of his mouth.

351 
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:16,634
Well, he's got some good stories
about you and your brother David.

352 
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:18,167
That's Jacob.

353 
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:21,467
David is my dad.

354 
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:24,334
 Oh.

355 
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,967
And I just find it's hard
to meet people around here.

356 
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:33,367
But that's not true.

357 
00:26:33,434 --> 00:26:39,067
Yes it is.  Okay, I bet that you've known
all your friends since the fourth grade.

358 
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:44,834
Am I right?
- Yeah, but I'm not a good example.
  I don't get out much.

359 
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,901
Besides, where have you lived
that's any different?

360 
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:53,000
Oh, Portland, Seattle, Jackson Hall, Atlanta, Boston.

361 
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:56,767
Hey Dunc.
- Hey Mishak. [Sorry]
You gonna come watch the game?

362 
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,834
Of course. I'll be there. I'll see you there.

363 
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:01,834
Go Vikings!
[Vikings! Woo! You know it, baby!]

364 
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:07,434
Okay, what is up with
everyone watching the game?

365 
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:09,801
Women watch the Vikings game.

366 
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:14,267
Gay guys watch.  People who have
absolutely no interest in football watch.

367 
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:21,034
I met this guy in the orchestra, and
he couldn't go to the movies with me
on Sunday because he had to watch the game.

368 
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:23,901
And I was like dude you're a violinist.

369 
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:27,401
It's not even about the football.

370 
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:28,634
It's a loyalty thing.

371 
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:30,934
Tell me.

372 
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,000
To the team, to the guys
you watch the game with.

373 
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:39,734
And you know you gotta remember
that we're in Minneapolis, there's
not really a lot to do here.

374 
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,967
No, but you're so wrong.
  This is a great place to live.

375 
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,334
Just not here in my neighborhood.

376 
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,401
Yeah, this is a little more adventurous
than my place over in St. Paul.

377 
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:53,667
Saint what?

378 
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:57,667
St. Paul. It's on the other side of the river.

379 
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:00,601
Never heard of it.

380 
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:06,734
Wow, does this smart-ass junior-high
routine work with all the ladies?

381 
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:08,167
Not yet.

382 
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,901
And the sad thing is I actually thought
I was carrying on an adult conversation.

383 
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,167
[Laughs]

384 
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:28,667
You working a puzzle?

385 
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:32,401
My damn hand shakes so much.

386 
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:33,967
I can't do it.

387 
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:37,901
Afraid I might shove a piece right up my ass.

388 
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,801
Oh I don't think you're doing it quite right.

389 
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,034
I got no interest in it.

390 
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:46,301
Got an interest in that sandwich, though.

391 
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:57,901
Right here?
-Right there.

392 
00:28:58,901 --> 00:28:59,734
Good!

393 
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:05,967
Got mustard?

394 
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:22,467
I could have been mayor.

395 
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:24,501
How about that.

396 
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:28,734
Had my campaign fund, everything.
[Thanks.]

397 
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:32,234
Mayor Shorter.

398 
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:36,334
Didn't do it, though.

399 
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:40,301
Good.

400 
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:44,801
You know...

401 
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:47,734
... shoulda done it.

402 
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,467
[See you tomorrow.]

403 
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:59,067
Hey!

404 
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,134
Young fella.

405 
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:02,201
Come here.

406 
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:07,967
We need a fourth.
Will you sit in and play with us?

407 
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:20,234
You deal.  You deal.

408 
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:24,401
Take your hat off.

409 
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:30,000
Okay, what's your poison?

410 
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:33,501
[Loud music]

411 
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,967
I love this room!

412 
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:40,967
11:30.

413 
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,967
Oh my God! Billy and the Bronzed Gods.

414 
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:07,167
I know couple of these guys
from when I lived in Austin.

415 
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,134
I've seen these guys before.

416 
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,567
Like when they were in their
replacements phase.

417 
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:15,234
Do you know their replacements
is why I came here?

418 
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh God, you're one of those.
- No, I'm not.

419 
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,567
Wait, one of what?

420 
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:25,334
One of those people who moved
to Minneapolis because you thought
it would be like a replacement song.

421 
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:28,467
You mean there are others?

422 
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:34,767
Aw, I can't believe that. Shit.
When am I going to have an original thought?

423 
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:37,934
I don't know.
Now you're just one of the masses.

424 
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:41,834
Hunting down Paul Westerberg
so you can tell him that his
music saved your life.

425 
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,601
Yeah, so. No, you know what,
I just want to meet him once.

426 
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:47,967
You know, just to ...

427 
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:52,834
maybe look adoringly at him
and smell his hair.

428 
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,767
Do you think that's crazy?

429 
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:56,567
Yes!

430 
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,067
But I'm glad you're here anyway.

431 
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:11,401
[Last call.  Drink up and get out.]

432 
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:14,501
What are you doing tomorrow?

433 
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,267
Gonna hang out and watch the Vikings game.

434 
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:37,967
Anyhoo, working on a whole new thing right?

435 
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:45,434
It's going to make Hacksetter a
little more appealing to the ladies.
- Oh yeah, you getting yourself a facelift?

436 
00:32:46,434 --> 00:32:49,234
Pretendin' to be an Indian.

437 
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:50,034
Really? An Indian.

438 
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:56,167
And that's going to make you more attractive?
- Oh yeah.
  It's gonna give me a whole sense of mystery.

439 
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:58,601
Or exoticness.

440 
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:01,434
Like I'm not going to come right out and say...

441 
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:05,401
Hi, I'm a quarter Chippewa. No.

442 
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,234
You know,
I'm going to be casual about it.

443 
00:33:07,534 --> 00:33:11,267
You know.  I'll refer to the president
as uh, the Great White Father.

444 
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:13,601
And uh, someway bring up, uh

445 
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:22,934
uh whatever one of them, Lake Superior,
Lake Superior I'm a, you know, say or as 
as my people call it ...

446 
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:26,567
Gitchigumi, or whatever they say.

447 
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:28,267
Next thing you know

448 
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:30,901
back at the sweat lodge, man.

449 
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,367
That is a good plan that is
going to get you scalped.

450 
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:34,967
Mmm.

451 
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:36,967
It is going to give me a lot.

452 
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:41,534
Scalped and then some.
Maybe they'll skin me.
Whole.

453 
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,101
[Cheering]

454 
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:50,834
Yep.

455 
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:52,334
It's fried, Sparky.

456 
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:56,301
Well I'm broke, Stu.

457 
00:33:57,234 --> 00:34:00,401
If it costs a nickel to get to
the north pole I couldn't make
it as far as Duluth.

458 
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,534
Ronald, Duncan's here.

459 
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,734
Ronald?
- [grunts] Yeah, yeah.

460 
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:14,801
Just finishing.

461 
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:27,967
What's it do?
- It's a sculpture. It doesn't
do anything. You look at it.

462 
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:31,534
It's big cherry in a goddamn big spoon.

463 
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:36,534
Oh the shit.
- Remember when you used to
  tell Jake and me to go outside
  and blow the stink off?

464 
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:43,667
Ehh, you two could drive me nuts.
- Well, you're driving grandma nuts
  so we're blowing the stink off, old man.

465 
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:46,467
Hardware.

466 
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:48,734
Goddamn, hardware!
[excited]

467 
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,267
7-6 ...

468 
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:57,534
I can tell just by the feel.

469 
00:34:58,701 --> 00:35:00,701
I lost his store and he died.

470 
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:02,534
Same year.

471 
00:35:06,534 --> 00:35:07,634
That's a long time ago, now.

472 
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,334
You got a raw deal
but you turned out alright.

473 
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:14,267
Gosh Christ. Look at that, will ya?

474 
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:15,934
Yeah.

475 
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,667
Must be 1950, for God's sakes.

476 
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,434
I'll do something for you some someday.

477 
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:26,267
You turned out all right you know.

478 
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:28,934
You go hunting.  You need shells?

479 
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:31,567
I could get you some shotgun shells.

480 
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:33,401
I'm good thanks.

481 
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,034
Want to get some for me, then?

482 
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:39,267
What the hell do you need shells for?

483 
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,667
You do a lot of hunting
up there on the sixth floor?

484 
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,367
Is she hot?

485 
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:48,301
You're was such an asshole.
- I'm just asking.

486 
00:35:49,301 --> 00:35:55,167
Well I'll have to check with Cara.
She has a very precise table plan
at Thanksgiving. Another person
may throw it off.

487 
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:56,467
You know how she can get.

488 
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:00,067
You know, it's been ten years.

489 
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:08,134
No, not 'til grandma told me.
You know it's kind of a female
thing to remember dates and
anniversaries like that, isn't it?

490 
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,201
He's our dad, dickhead.

491 
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:13,367
Don't you ever think about him?

492 
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:17,501
Well I know if he were here right
now he'd be flipping you shit
for missing that deer.

493 
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:21,034
Uh, Duncan, on your next shot
I want you to scare it my way
so I can hit it.

494 
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:27,901
I always hated hunting anyhow.

495 
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,501
I just liked going out in the
woods with you guys.

496 
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,134
Really?  That's gay.

497 
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:36,334
Hey, don't tell Cara you hate it.
She thinks we're going up north
the last weekend of pheasant season.

498 
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:38,367
Lemme guess.

499 
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:41,834
You're holding another meeting
of the Bimbo-of-the-Month club.

500 
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:43,834
Yeah, going to a bed and
breakfast down south.

501 
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:45,867
Why?

502 
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,267
Cause I'm tired of fucking her
in Minneapolis, want to fuck her
in Rochester for a change.

503 
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,134
Then I'll fuck her in Dubuque for a change.

504 
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:57,401
You know, I could just shoot you
out here and tell everybody it was
an accident.

505 
00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,967
Hey, don't joke about shit like that.

506 
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:02,501
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend
your delicate sensibilities.

507 
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:04,501
You're not my brother.

508 
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:10,734
Oh right, my high school dropout
loser mooch brother disowns me.
Whaddya doing? Whoa. Quit
fucking around D, it's not funny.

509 
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,601
Shut up. Deer.

510 
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:17,567
Now now wait wait for me.
Just, shh, I got it.

511 
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:27,634
[Misses, deliberately]

512 
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:31,301
Not even close.

513 
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:40,934
I love Thanksgiving.
I mean the idea of it anyway.

514 
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:45,534
Because I never had the big family Thanksgiving.
- What are you doing this year?

515 
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh, the usual.

516 
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,634
You know, curl up with a bottle of gin.

517 
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:53,701
Then pie.

518 
00:37:56,301 --> 00:38:02,667
Well, uh, my brother's having
everybody out to his place to
 eat and pray. That might be cool.

519 
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:12,534
What is that, like a half-ass
Duncan version of an invitation?
[Laughs]

520 
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:16,101
Alright.

521 
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:20,634
Alright, a big family Thanksgiving.
Count me in, I'll do it.

522 
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,467
Yeah?
- Yeah.

523 
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,967
Good. Aw, good,
 'cause I needed a ride.

524 
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:28,567
Such an asshole.

525 
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:34,434
I just wanna watch one of these
big bitches crash already.
Wouldn't that be cool?

526 
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:37,834
Well, Beavis, you're aiming
at the wrong bitches.

527 
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:44,334
That is, the big bitches have a
base proportional to the height.
You can't break 'em. You should
aim for the little bitches on the side.

528 
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,467
You love these icicles, don't you?

529 
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,567
I just like knowin' how things
are put together, how they're built.

530 
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:53,634
What, like an architect?

531 
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:54,734
You could do that.

532 
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:59,401
Well no, architecture is more about
how things look and I don't give a
shit how things look.

533 
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,834
I like how they're designed,
and engineered.

534 
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:03,601
Which is why I like this bridge.

535 
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:08,601
Some things are built to last,
and some things just fall apart.

536 
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,067
Which one are you?

537 
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:21,701
Aww, I can't believe it.

538 
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:24,101
Can't believe you got one before I did.

539 
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:27,467
Kind of embarrassing.

540 
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,000
[Kissing]

541 
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:13,134
Grampa?  Grampa.

542 
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:18,301
What's going on?

543 
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,101
I wanted to watch the Today Show.

544 
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:25,167
Well you're scaring grandma.

545 
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:26,101
Bull shit.

546 
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:29,201
Ruth!  Ruth!

547 
00:40:29,534 --> 00:40:32,767
She's downstairs in the lobby right now crying.

548 
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:33,701
For Christ's sakes.

549 
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,034
Did you actually tell her that
I was going to buy you shotgun shells?

550 
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:44,634
That was between her and me.
- Well congratulations,
  I'm in the middle of it now.

551 
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:49,401
And what the hell is this?
- Yeah yeah yeah.  It's empty.

552 
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:52,967
Well then what are you doing with it?

553 
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:54,734
Give me a shell.

554 
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:57,601
What?
- Just need one.

555 
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:04,501
This is what you wanted, right?
You wanted your TV so you threw a tantrum.

556 
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:06,267
My brother I shoulda.

557 
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,967
Sterling your ...

558 
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:17,367
Life of the party, he was.
Couldn't put together two words at
the end. They put him in one of them...

559 
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,134
He didn't know where he was.

560 
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,767
Thought he was living at the airport.

561 
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:25,901
I shoulda, he would have thanked me.
- Well, I know exactly where you are.

562 
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,167
You're in your living room with your team.

563 
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:32,000
You got what you wanted.
Are you happy now?

564 
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:34,301
Because now you gotta do two things for me.

565 
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:38,301
First, stop scaring grandma with this shit.

566 
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:41,567
If you do this again I swear old man,
I will beat you senseless.

567 
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,834
What's the other thing?

568 
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:47,867
I want you to go to Jake's for Thanksgiving.

569 
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:52,634
I don't like people seeing me like this.

570 
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:56,801
Is that what this is about?
You're embarrased?

571 
00:41:57,967 --> 00:41:59,334
I'm not embarrassed, you little shit.

572 
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:03,701
Not of me.  This isn't me.
You think this is me?

573 
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:11,301
Alright, that should do it.

574 
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,201
There you go.

575 
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:20,734
Just like new.

576 
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:24,834
Hold on.

577 
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:32,367
Always trying to steal.
Rob ya blind unless you catch 'em.
Sneaky bastards.

578 
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:50,201
You have a lovely day Mrs. Hollerich.

579 
00:43:00,467 --> 00:43:07,000
I just don't know about this. I mean the
recipe I got it was from a woman with ALS.
- Okay don't worry about it.

580 
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,601
It's not like anybody was
going to eat 'em anyhow.

581 
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:12,034
I'm sorry.  That was a bad joke.
I was just kidding.

582 
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:16,067
Okay but maybe we shouldn't do this.
It just doesn't feel right
and they might not like

583 
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:21,101
what I made and I don't even
fucking like sweet potatoes.
- Hey, calm down, you're nervious.

584 
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,501
I get that it's your first big
family Thanksgiving dinner but

585 
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:29,234
I got your back, I promise.
And if we sit down, you don't
 like it, lemme know, and I will
 whisk you away to safety.

586 
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,234
I promise.  Okay?
- Okay.

587 
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:32,167
Deep breath.

588 
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:33,367
You good to go?
- mm Hmm.

589 
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:34,501
Excellent.

590 
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:36,234
Yuck.
-  Oh.

591 
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,667
Hey, girls.
 Happy Thanksgiving!

592 
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:40,701
Daddy,

593 
00:43:41,634 --> 00:43:42,967
Uncle Duncan's here.

594 
00:43:43,534 --> 00:43:44,434
What, no hug?

595 
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:46,901
Hey. Alright, go play.

596 
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,401
What's up, shithead.
Happy Thanksgiving.

597 
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:54,634
Hi, you must be Kate. Nice to meet you.
-  Hi, I brought sweet potatoes.

598 
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:57,201
Great, well come on in,
I'll get you a drink.

599 
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:04,034
I'm such a fan of stuffing.
You want some more?

600 
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:08,134
She's gonna have to put him in a home soon.
You know that. Look at him.

601 
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:11,834
He's fine, Jake.
Just takes a little patience.

602 
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:14,934
Okay.

603 
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:19,067
Cara, this is turkey is amazing.
- Oh, yeah.

604 
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:23,000
I hope so.
I've been basting it for two days.

605 
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:24,467
Wow.

606 
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:27,734
Sweet potatoes are good.

607 
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:33,367
Duncan?

608 
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:38,934
Grampa's boots had some mud on them,
so now there's a mess in the foyer.

609 
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,334
Okay, I'll take care of that as soon as I can.

610 
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:44,534
Thank you.

611 
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:48,634
So, you're in a new place on the river.

612 
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:50,801
How do you like it?

613 
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:53,867
Why is he talking like that?

614 
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:56,467
We just love it, Tom, we love it.

615 
00:44:57,134 --> 00:44:59,601
Yeah, there's some great views out
there of the river, both skylines.

616 
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:03,401
The girls love the elevator.
[Laughs]
- Fantastic.

617 
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:05,134
At night

618 
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:07,701
you can see the northern lights.

619 
00:45:10,034 --> 00:45:12,367
Northern lights. Really [disbelief].

620 
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:16,101
I've seen them up north in Canada,
but down here?

621 
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:18,101
You can see them down here sometimes.

622 
00:45:19,034 --> 00:45:20,767
This time of year in the city...

623 
00:45:21,534 --> 00:45:25,701
He sees them so obviously they're there.
- D?
Look, he sees them from the balcony.

624 
00:45:25,734 --> 00:45:27,734
Hey, he sees them; it doesn't matter.

625 
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:30,134
Is it really important?

626 
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:34,801
Sorry, grandma.

627 
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:40,034
Do you know that there is some
tribal dancing that relieves stress?

628 
00:45:41,134 --> 00:45:42,934
You have open your chest, kinda.

629 
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:50,401
Could be reflected city lights.
Ronald ...

630 
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,034
you sure?
- Yeah.

631 
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:56,101
Yeah, I'm sure.
I lived up north seventy years.

632 
00:45:56,534 --> 00:45:59,334
You think I never saw northern lights,
you think I don't know what they look like?

633 
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:01,867
I know what they are, you jackass.

634 
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:04,234
I saw 'em.  I see 'em.

635 
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:15,067
Turkey's a little dry.

636 
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:24,301
I loved it.
I loved every minute of it.

637 
00:46:24,634 --> 00:46:27,867
The family tension
and the sweaters and the

638 
00:46:28,234 --> 00:46:30,767
the little marshmallows on the dessert.

639 
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:33,801
It could have been worse,
my mom could have been there.

640 
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:37,534
Yeah, where is she?

641 
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:40,801
She moved down to Florida
when Jake went to college.

642 
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:44,901
I was actually supposed to move in
with her after dad died, but ...

643 
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:47,134
How could I go to Florida?

644 
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:48,934
There's no hockey down there.

645 
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,434
Well, it would be nice to visit her.

646 
00:46:54,467 --> 00:46:55,367
I wouldn't know, actually.

647 
00:46:56,301 --> 00:47:00,534
Because Jake takes his family down there,
but I only see her when she comes up
for a couple weeks in the summer.

648 
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:02,501
She hates the winters up here.

649 
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:04,767
Yeah, I can't say I blame her.

650 
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,201
I mean it's not even December

651 
00:47:07,401 --> 00:47:10,167
and my nipples are so hard
they could cut glass.

652 
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:14,000
Is that a warning?

653 
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:17,167
I don't know.

654 
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:23,967
[Loud music]

655 
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:51,034
It's running good, all the electricals.
I changed the oil too.
Don't mention it.

656 
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,034
And you gotta watch that radiator.

657 
00:47:53,434 --> 00:47:55,034
I filled it but it's gotta slow leak.

658 
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:57,034
Good to know.  Thank you.

659 
00:47:57,767 --> 00:47:59,967
What is up with you? Are you high?

660 
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:01,867
No.

661 
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,101
I had too much turkey,
it makes me giddy.

662 
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,267
Mmm.
I remember when I used to get giddy.

663 
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:09,767
Stu?

664 
00:48:10,934 --> 00:48:14,101
You know how some days when you wake
up the world just seems right?

665 
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:18,767
You know, everything comes together,
just feels like [interruption]
- Holy ...

666 
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:21,000
You got laid.

667 
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:23,401
Huh.

668 
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:28,934
So, is it dangerous?

669 
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:31,901
Just if you walk by it.

670 
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:33,901
Or look at it.

671 
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:40,434
I, look, I'll just throw a
couple brackets under there to
distribute the weight more evenly.

672 
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:44,034
And by the time I'm finished
you'll be able to store a herd
of elephants up there.

673 
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:46,534
My, that should be handy.

674 
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:49,034
How's your grampa?

675 
00:48:50,301 --> 00:48:51,000
He's doing fine.

676 
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:59,467
[Music...]

677 
00:49:15,267 --> 00:49:19,434
[Music...]

678 
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:34,901
[Horn honks]

679 
00:49:52,634 --> 00:49:56,834
[Learning to plow snow]

680 
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:04,367
[Fence, fence, fence!]

681 
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,467
[Gently, gently.]

682 
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:34,534
You know, you're really missing out,
staying in one place.

683 
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:38,101
You're missing chile rellenos
in Boston.

684 
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:41,467
You're missing crab cakes
in Baltimore.

685 
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:46,167
Uh, Brooklyn bagels,
grits in Georgia.

686 
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:47,567
You're just naming food.

687 
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:49,734
I know, I'm hungry.

688 
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:55,967
Then what's the next place?

689 
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:01,634
I like right here, right now.

690 
00:51:06,134 --> 00:51:09,634
Just until you're done
stalking Westerberg, right?

691 
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:12,634
Hey listen, restraining orders
mean nothing to me.

692 
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:18,867
I actually have friends who've
seen him at the Wally's Roast Beef
down in Bloomington.

693 
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:23,101
Oh my God, that's amazing.
You have friends?

694 
00:51:24,267 --> 00:51:26,867
Well, just the guys I've been
hanging around with since the
fourth grade.

695 
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,701
Yeah I know.
When am I gonna meet these guys?

696 
00:51:31,534 --> 00:51:35,134
Ah, hope the snow keeps up.

697 
00:51:36,234 --> 00:51:37,601
Probably take the sleds out tomorrow.

698 
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:40,867
You're gonna go sledding?

699 
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,801
Duncan, that is so quaint,
that's so nineteenth century.

700 
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:48,867
Can I come?

701 
00:51:50,201 --> 00:51:52,634
[aaaaah]

702 
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:58,667
[I feel like James Bond.]

703 
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:06,101
[You drive like a girl.]

704 
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:15,201
I can't feel my toes.

705 
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:18,034
I think some skin came off with that.

706 
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,301
My teeth are so frozen.

707 
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:30,834
I love you.
- No I love you.
[That's disgusting.]

708 
00:52:33,334 --> 00:52:35,467
He's eighty two.

709 
00:52:35,701 --> 00:52:37,367
But he's still pretty active.

710 
00:52:38,801 --> 00:52:42,201
I mean he fishes, and complains
about the government, anyway.

711 
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,167
My grandfather's just sitting out on his
balcony watching the northern lights.

712 
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:47,701
Waiting for the end.

713 
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,000
Hey hey.

714 
00:52:53,067 --> 00:52:54,201
What's in it?

715 
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:56,201
We don't know.
Hacksetter makes it.

716 
00:52:56,201 --> 00:52:57,267
He calls it firewater.

717 
00:52:58,401 --> 00:52:59,867
Oh, careful.

718 
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:05,301
Ugh.

719 
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,267
Dr. Pepper and Robitussin.

720 
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:11,567
Nice, here I'll take some of that.

721 
00:53:12,701 --> 00:53:14,434
You know a lot of Indian tribes

722 
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:16,601
Oh Jesus, Hack, don't pull
that Indian shit on me.

723 
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:18,567
No, this is serious man, I've done

724 
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:20,034
lots of research on it.

725 
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,967
Lot of tribes feel that
when person is ready

726 
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:26,067
they just die.

727 
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:30,101
They, uh, fulfilled
their missions and

728 
00:53:31,134 --> 00:53:33,434
taught all their lessons and uh,

729 
00:53:34,634 --> 00:53:36,234
they're ready to move onto the next world.

730 
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:38,901
You still see their souls passing

731 
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:40,501
the northern lights.

732 
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:43,667
They sort of just quietly

733 
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:45,767
expire.

734 
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:52,634
You're full of shit. That's the
old Indian guy from "The Outlaw
Josie Wales." I've seen that movie.

735 
00:53:52,701 --> 00:53:54,701
Okay it was pretty cool though,
you gotta admit.

736 
00:53:54,801 --> 00:54:00,334
This Indian shit works. Even you
kinda wanted a little Hacksetter
action, didn't ya.

737 
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:03,767
You know, Kate, and excuse the
impertinence of this question, but

738 
00:54:04,701 --> 00:54:06,101
What the hell are you doin' with Duncan?

739 
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:09,334
Yeah, I mean haven't you
noticed that you're

740 
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:10,534
way out of his league.

741 
00:54:11,267 --> 00:54:13,934
Hey listen guys,
I tell him that all the time.

742 
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,534
I mean we're his best friends
so we know what a fuck-up he really is.

743 
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:21,434
Wow, did you ever think it might
not help to have his best friends
calling him a fuck-up?

744 
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:26,234
What, what do you mean, we made him
drop out of school and piss his life away?
- I destroyed his life?

745 
00:54:26,334 --> 00:54:30,201
No, that was Michak.
- Oh come on, don't be so hard on him.

746 
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:34,701
He was the best hockey player
I ever played with.

747 
00:54:34,701 --> 00:54:38,567
He was skating varsity in the
eighth grade. He could have
had a scholarship pay for
college right there.

748 
00:54:39,201 --> 00:54:41,801
He just quit.
He had so much potential and he just quit.

749 
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:48,201
Why did he quit?
- I don't know.  Drive you crazy
  trying to figure out why that
  guy does anything.
- I got my theory.

750 
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:50,034
Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

751 
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:51,734
Yeah?

752 
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:56,134
You know when you're a teenager

753 
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:58,201
and you rebel against your parents,

754 
00:54:58,501 --> 00:55:00,501
shave your head, pierce your ass,
that kind of crap?

755 
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:03,467
Everybody does.
Everybody does it.

756 
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:05,267
But Dunc

757 
00:55:06,134 --> 00:55:07,801
never got a chance to rebel because

758 
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:11,101
his dad, when his dad died
he was still god to him,

759 
00:55:13,234 --> 00:55:15,134
and that's what happens when your god dies.

760 
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:19,234
Wow, Lindy.

761 
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:20,667
That's tremendously profound.

762 
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:23,334
Why don't you lick my ball sack, Finn.

763 
00:55:23,434 --> 00:55:25,267
Oh.
- Oh, would you like that?

764 
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:27,967
Ball sack is never really necessary,

765 
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:31,767
to say, out loud, you know?
Now I'm going to have

766 
00:55:34,534 --> 00:55:37,534
[Taking a picture]
- Balls.  Balls.

767 
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:38,134
Got it!

768 
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:47,034
Oh, Jesus.

769 
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:49,501
Oops.

770 
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:53,601
Do you want me to drive?
I don't mind driving at all.
- No! I'm good.

771 
00:55:55,634 --> 00:55:57,667
People keep warning me about you.

772 
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,467
Dunc.

773 
00:56:01,101 --> 00:56:04,867
I can't believe I'm having sex
with a guy named Dunc.

774 
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:07,934
But I can't believe
I'm having sex, period.

775 
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:09,601
Ha, aww.

776 
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:18,067
How did your father die?

777 
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:23,267
Um, the usual way.
He stop breathing.

778 
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:27,634
Keep your eyes on the road.
It gets really icy here in the winter.

779 
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,067
It's dangerous.
- How old were you?

780 
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:36,767
I was 15 and he was 39.

781 
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:40,501
And he died of a heart attack.

782 
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:42,534
God that's so young.

783 
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,067
Yeah, you think?

784 
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:48,801
Oh?

785 
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:50,834
It is young, but

786 
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:53,834
it was the lifestyle that he was living.

787 
00:56:53,901 --> 00:56:57,201
It was the eighties and his business
was doing really good so

788 
00:56:58,134 --> 00:57:00,967
you know why save all that money
when you can shovel it up your nose.

789 
00:57:03,601 --> 00:57:06,667
But he was, you know,
he was in rehab for the

790 
00:57:06,701 --> 00:57:07,701
last couple of years.

791 
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,734
He got sober but that night he just went
over to his buddy's, to his house and

792 
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:16,867
was playing poker...
look watch out... slow down

793 
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:21,101
I can drive.
- I know you can drive, but 
people go into this ditch all the time.
I can see the road.

794 
00:57:22,267 --> 00:57:26,267
Okay. It's just ...
- It's gone.
[Duncan sighs]

795 
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:30,101
He died.  He went to his
 buddy's, to his house and

796 
00:57:31,101 --> 00:57:35,934
he was playing poker with his
old drug buddies and Stu
was his dealer, and he died.

797 
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:39,934
And ...

798 
00:57:41,767 --> 00:57:42,967
I think

799 
00:57:43,601 --> 00:57:44,801
it's possible that

800 
00:57:46,534 --> 00:57:51,401
maybe he did a couple of lines
with the guys that night knowing
that it would have killed him.

801 
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:54,301
I dunno. I just...

802 
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:57,367
Stu's the only guy who really
knows what happened.

803 
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,000
And uh,

804 
00:58:03,967 --> 00:58:08,401
And I've never had the balls to ask
him because I think I'm a little
afraid of what the truth might be.

805 
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:12,934
Yeah.

806 
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:55,867
Why did you tell me that about your dad?

807 
00:59:03,234 --> 00:59:04,301
Thanks for telling me.

808 
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:37,567
Kate.

809 
00:59:37,934 --> 00:59:38,767
Kate.
- Hey.

810 
00:59:39,934 --> 00:59:40,401
Uh, god.

811 
00:59:41,901 --> 00:59:45,734
I'm sorry I'm late.
- You have to make it up to me the hard way.

812 
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:51,367
How about some brownies
from Mrs. Nigard in room 704?

813 
00:59:52,034 --> 00:59:53,601
A little harder than that.

814 
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:55,901
Really?
- Yeah.

815 
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:01,301
Okay. You know, you really shouldn't be
out here by yourself in this neighborhood.

816 
01:00:01,301 --> 01:00:06,067
Really?  Well you know ain't nobody
gonna mess with a girl who's 
carrying a copy of Bullitt.

817 
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:07,401
With Steve McQueen.

818 
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:13,234
Why is it that we can't go
to your place, again?

819 
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:16,167
I like your place.
It's got nice lighting, and ...

820 
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:21,467
Hey Jake, what's up?

821 
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:31,067
Oh.

822 
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:37,201
Kate, this is Sandy. 
Sandy, this is Kate.

823 
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:37,701
Hi.

824 
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:39,934
Hi Sandy.

825 
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:43,667
What are you doing, D?

826 
01:00:45,134 --> 01:00:48,767
We got a video
so we came to watch the video.

827 
01:00:50,934 --> 01:00:52,101
Steve McQueen.

828 
01:00:53,634 --> 01:00:54,701
Lotta action.

829 
01:00:57,201 --> 01:00:59,134
We should go.
- Yeah.  - Okay. - Yeah.

830 
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:01,967
Oh, you guys are leaving.
That's terrible.

831 
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,367
Sorry, have fun.
- Okay.

832 
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:16,834
Wow. That is creepy.

833 
01:01:17,701 --> 01:01:22,334
That kinda reminds me that Jack
Lemmon movie where he lends his
apartment to the boss.

834 
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:24,901
That's where he got the idea.

835 
01:01:28,134 --> 01:01:30,601
And you let him do this because ...

836 
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,034
I work at Wentworth sometimes.
It's a good nursing home.

837 
01:01:38,434 --> 01:01:39,567
Yeah?
-Yeah.

838 
01:01:40,034 --> 01:01:41,234
Good. Maybe I'll move there.

839 
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,767
I think I'm getting a touch of
the A-bomb myself.

840 
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:47,834
You know Ruth isn't going to be able
to take care of him much longer.

841 
01:01:48,134 --> 01:01:51,234
Just in the last month his
dementia has progressed.

842 
01:01:53,401 --> 01:01:55,134
I dummo.
He seemed pretty good today.

843 
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,901
Ready for the movie?

844 
01:01:59,367 --> 01:02:02,734
Wait what is this?
University of Minneapolis?

845 
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:06,967
I'm so impressed with you.

846 
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:12,334
Dingus McDonkey?

847 
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:17,901
Address: 666 Your Ass

848 
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:22,834
That's smart.
Why all the juvenile shit?

849 
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:25,901
Because, I started filling it out,
and it's stupid.

850 
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:29,767
You need a bunch of random bullshit
for it: your high school transcripts

851 
01:02:29,901 --> 01:02:32,601
recommendations, you gotta write
a fucking essay, it's just dumb.

852 
01:02:33,567 --> 01:02:35,334
Plus, I probably wouldn't get in anyhow.

853 
01:02:36,034 --> 01:02:37,034
Maybe you wouldn't.

854 
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:40,134
But Dingus definitely won't.

855 
01:02:41,334 --> 01:02:43,167
You know the great thing about
Dingus McDonkey?

856 
01:02:43,934 --> 01:02:45,534
He's a real bobcat in the sack.

857 
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,634
Hey, it's a joke.

858 
01:02:54,401 --> 01:02:55,401
Yeah, exactly.

859 
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:57,034
It's a joke.

860 
01:02:57,634 --> 01:02:58,501
Ha ha ha.

861 
01:03:45,101 --> 01:03:48,101
You're actually really good
at these exercises, Ronny.

862 
01:03:48,834 --> 01:03:50,467
And your legs are quite strong.

863 
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:55,101
Those used to be like tree trunks.

864 
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:58,134
Now does this hurt, or are you
pretending like you did last time?

865 
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,867
Oh god. Everything hurts.

866 
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:02,201
Ha.

867 
01:04:03,867 --> 01:04:04,601
Alright.

868 
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,501
Point and flex, you know the drill.

869 
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:13,934
The day you met Duncan

870 
01:04:14,867 --> 01:04:17,634
I just pretended to
fall out of the chair

871 
01:04:19,434 --> 01:04:21,867
so he'd come and help me
and you'd see what

872 
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:23,367
a good guy he is,

873 
01:04:24,267 --> 01:04:25,534
helping an old man.

874 
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:31,401
Well it worked,
you crafty old matchmaker you.

875 
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:32,867
You're good for him.

876 
01:04:35,434 --> 01:04:37,134
Like you are with me and these exercises.

877 
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:40,834
He needs someone being hard on him.

878 
01:04:43,101 --> 01:04:43,767
You've gotta help him.

879 
01:04:47,934 --> 01:04:50,267
I'm not sure I know how to help him, Ronny.

880 
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:51,034
Yes, you do.

881 
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,601
Just keep on at him like you been doin'.

882 
01:04:54,801 --> 01:04:55,467
You and me.

883 
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:57,301
We'll help him, Katie.

884 
01:05:03,434 --> 01:05:07,501
You're cheating, Gunderson.
I know you are, you're hiding
cards, aren't you?

885 
01:05:07,634 --> 01:05:08,934
[Laughing]

886 
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:10,567
Take his oxygen tank.

887 
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:13,701
[More laughing]

888 
01:05:21,301 --> 01:05:24,501
You ARE cheating,
you old son of a bitch.

889 
01:05:25,734 --> 01:05:28,634
And under your ass too,
that's disgusting.

890 
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:36,134
We've been playing in this place for years.

891 
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:41,067
Yeah you'll probably be playing
for another couple of decades.

892 
01:05:41,434 --> 01:05:43,267
Ha ha, at least until Finn
runs his dad's business into the ground.

893 
01:05:46,101 --> 01:05:48,534
Hey, you remember my friend Anna?

894 
01:05:50,101 --> 01:05:52,534
Yeah, Anna from San Diego right?
- Yeah.

895 
01:05:52,634 --> 01:05:54,934
She called me the other night.
She wanted me to

896 
01:05:55,401 --> 01:05:56,167
to move.

897 
01:05:59,434 --> 01:06:01,501
Move where, to San Diego?

898 
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:03,801
Yeah, there's this couple and they're

899 
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:08,434
going to Europe for a year, and their
house-sitter fell through so she
wanted to know if I want to stay there.

900 
01:06:09,201 --> 01:06:16,034
And it's like a couple blocks from
the beach, so there's gonna be
ocean and sunshine and fish tacos.

901 
01:06:16,334 --> 01:06:17,167
What do you think?

902 
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:21,501
San Diego so great why are those people leavin'?

903 
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,934
Because people go places, Duncan.

904 
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:32,167
Look what the cat dragged in.
A Duncan.

905 
01:06:41,734 --> 01:06:44,734
[Cheering] [Clapping]

906 
01:06:57,367 --> 01:06:58,134
[Arguing]

907 
01:06:59,067 --> 01:07:00,501
Your girlfriend's here, right?

908 
01:07:01,034 --> 01:07:03,434
Fuck you, take the goddamn
game seriously.

909 
01:07:04,267 --> 01:07:09,701
[Fighting] [Cursing]

910 
01:07:12,734 --> 01:07:14,667
We're on the same team.

911 
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:19,367
Hey, what's wrong with you.  Laugh!

912 
01:07:19,934 --> 01:07:22,967
Get off me.
What's wrong with you, anyway.
... it's a goddamn game.

913 
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:24,734
Let's go get a beer, Finn.

914 
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:36,601
Why don't you come?

915 
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:39,634
So then that's it.
You've made up your mind.

916 
01:07:40,967 --> 01:07:44,634
No, um, but I would
have to be there in January.

917 
01:07:54,234 --> 01:07:56,567
Um, what are you going to do for work?

918 
01:07:57,134 --> 01:08:00,367
I am a healthcare professional.
So there's always sick people.

919 
01:08:01,301 --> 01:08:04,667
What, I don't get this, Kate.
How you can,

920 
01:08:04,734 --> 01:08:08,967
how you can pack up everything
that you have here and just
leave it behind.

921 
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:11,501
What do I have here besides you?

922 
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:14,367
Why, that's not enough?

923 
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:19,401
Oh.

924 
01:08:21,067 --> 01:08:23,201
Okay, that's not enough,
well that's good to know.

925 
01:08:23,701 --> 01:08:25,534
I don't know, I thought you were joking.

926 
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,701
No, I'm being serious.  Surprise!

927 
01:08:28,934 --> 01:08:33,401
Okay, well I can't tell what's
what's serious to you.
- I'm being serious right now.

928 
01:08:34,234 --> 01:08:37,000
I just watched you get in a fight
like a 12-year-old.

929 
01:08:37,134 --> 01:08:39,234
And that guy was on the same team as you.

930 
01:08:39,301 --> 01:08:43,067
Well he had it fucking coming.
He was being a jackass, and
that's not the point that's hockey.

931 
01:08:43,134 --> 01:08:45,434
You don't even know hockey.
- It's such bullshit.

932 
01:08:45,534 --> 01:08:47,667
Why are you trying to pick a
fight with me? This is stupid.

933 
01:08:48,301 --> 01:08:51,467
You know what?  Have a good time
in San Diego. I'm going home.
It's too cold for this.

934 
01:08:51,567 --> 01:08:54,767
I thought we were having an
adult conversation.
- Good night!

935 
01:09:25,934 --> 01:09:27,434
Quit sulking, Ronald.

936 
01:09:28,734 --> 01:09:30,901
Duncan is going to take you
to the store tomorrow.

937 
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,967
I thought we'd play cards,
penny a point, quarter a game.

938 
01:09:36,367 --> 01:09:37,667
You used to love cards.

939 
01:09:39,101 --> 01:09:44,601
You had a lot of interests.
You know, you liked woodworking
and hunting and dancing.

940 
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:45,034
Huh.

941 
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:50,934
We used to go dancing every
Saturday night.

942 
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:51,667
At the Legion.

943 
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:55,134
But I never had an interest
in it, sweetheart.

944 
01:09:55,867 --> 01:09:57,601
You loved dancing.

945 
01:09:58,467 --> 01:09:59,901
I loved being close to you.

946 
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:02,000
Holding your hand.

947 
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:03,567
That's all.

948 
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:05,834
I had an interest in you.

949 
01:10:06,734 --> 01:10:08,567
Just holding your hand.

950 
01:10:16,234 --> 01:10:17,967
I love you, sweetheart.

951 
01:10:20,767 --> 01:10:21,567
I love you too.

952 
01:10:27,634 --> 01:10:30,034
[music lyrics ...]
I need no soft lights

953 
01:10:31,734 --> 01:10:33,867
to enchant me.

954 
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:37,067
It's true.

955 
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:40,901
Only grant me

956 
01:10:43,401 --> 01:10:45,601
The right

957 
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,301
To hold you ever so tight.

958 
01:10:55,301 --> 01:10:59,667
And to feel in the night

959 
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:08,167
The nearness of you.
[End of song]

960 
01:11:37,267 --> 01:11:41,301
[Car won't start]

961 
01:11:56,934 --> 01:11:59,034
[Finished?]
-  Just about.

962 
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:06,034
I'll go on balcony in December.
Very cold.

963 
01:12:06,434 --> 01:12:10,000
I gotta bird feeder out there.
For the birds, and some squirrels.

964 
01:12:12,201 --> 01:12:12,534
Okay.

965 
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:16,301
There you go, all finished.

966 
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,501
I dunno how exactly he could
have taken anything. You were
with him the whole time.
- Sneaky.

967 
01:12:32,534 --> 01:12:37,234
Thief! This is mine! Thief. I'm calling the police.
- I don't know how that got in there, Mrs. Hollerich.

968 
01:12:37,534 --> 01:12:42,167
My husband's medals.
Thief. Robbing me blind.

969 
01:12:44,067 --> 01:12:46,934
But you know I didn't take that
tin. It was an accident.

970 
01:12:47,434 --> 01:12:51,367
Not to crazy woman.
She sees you taking,
that's only thing that matters.

971 
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,567
If she calls the police you are fired.

972 
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:54,634
I am fired.

973 
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,167
I'm sorry, my friend, I'm sorry.

974 
01:13:01,601 --> 01:13:07,267
The woman is just a nightmare.  She only keeps
that there because she's crazy. Honestly, who
keeps stuff hidden under the kitchen sink?

975 
01:13:07,434 --> 01:13:12,201
She's lonesome, Duncan, not crazy.
Do you want me to talk to her?  I can try.

976 
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:14,667
No, forget it.
There's no point. Look, I've,

977 
01:13:14,734 --> 01:13:16,401
I've been fired from better jobs
than this one.

978 
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,000
I was only here because of him.

979 
01:13:18,667 --> 01:13:20,067
So you're just going to give up?

980 
01:13:20,534 --> 01:13:22,101
Why should I put up with all this shit?

981 
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:25,734
But she said you stole a box of medals.
- But I didn't steal anything.

982 
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:33,434
That's what I'm telling you, grandma.  I didn't steal a
thing. For once in my life I didn't actually do anything wrong.
- I know but they'll say you did.

983 
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:38,101
And I didn't raise you just to accept [interrupted].
- No, you're right. You didn't raise me.
  You didn't, my dad didn't.

984 
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:39,634
My mother certainly fucking didn't.

985 
01:13:39,701 --> 01:13:42,967
So you tell me, who did?  Who
raised me because they did a crap job.

986 
01:13:42,967 --> 01:13:45,901
[Ronald: Come on, kiddo.]

987 
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:49,000
Let's go blow the stink off.

988 
01:13:55,401 --> 01:13:57,534
[Ronald: Hurry up.]

989 
01:13:58,567 --> 01:13:59,634
So that's it.

990 
01:14:00,901 --> 01:14:04,134
She's leaving me here and she's going to San Diego.
- San Diego?

991 
01:14:04,434 --> 01:14:10,601
That's where the war is.
- Uh, yeah, we're going to be closing up in
about five minutes.  Do you two need anything?

992 
01:14:10,701 --> 01:14:12,267
You got shotgun shells?

993 
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:16,000
Don't listen to him, we're fine.
We'll be outta your hair in a sec.

994 
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:21,867
You know if you were serious about
this suicide business you wouldn't
need shotgun shells.

995 
01:14:22,434 --> 01:14:25,701
Just drop a toaster in the tub or
throw yourself off the balcony.

996 
01:14:26,601 --> 01:14:27,701
Why don't you go?

997 
01:14:28,867 --> 01:14:31,567
What's that?
- Why can't you go to San Diego?

998 
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,434
Because I got things here, grampa.

999 
01:14:34,967 --> 01:14:37,901
All my friends are here, Jake
and the girls, you and grandma.

1000 
01:14:38,034 --> 01:14:38,734
Ruth.

1001 
01:14:39,334 --> 01:14:42,101
She can take care of herself
damned well, believe me.

1002 
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:46,000
You got a raw deal kiddo.
- [Hands.]

1003 
01:14:46,934 --> 01:14:47,801
Your dad.

1004 
01:14:49,167 --> 01:14:50,967
Think about him, how he died.

1005 
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:52,967
I didn't, didn't help him.

1006 
01:14:54,201 --> 01:14:55,000
He needed me.

1007 
01:14:56,434 --> 01:14:57,101
I shoulda helped him.

1008 
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,867
He's gone.

1009 
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:06,267
What were we talking about?

1010 
01:15:08,901 --> 01:15:11,834
Yeah, alright.

1011 
01:15:17,701 --> 01:15:19,934
I'm the mayor.
[Good night, sir.]

1012 
01:15:20,134 --> 01:15:21,334
Hump.

1013 
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:33,267
Ok, bye.
- Bye.

1014 
01:15:42,134 --> 01:15:44,000
[coughs]

1015 
01:15:45,634 --> 01:15:48,434
I'm thinking maybe you're right.
- Jesus Christ. D.

1016 
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:50,134
What are you doing?

1017 
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,201
I know it's sad, D,
but it'd be better for him.

1018 
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:00,401
He's suicidal.

1019 
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,567
Yeah right, can you see him
jumping off the balcony?

1020 
01:16:06,601 --> 01:16:08,234
He asked me to buy him shotgun shells.

1021 
01:16:09,901 --> 01:16:12,567
Anybody who talks about killing
themselves isn't really going to do it.

1022 
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:16,967
Whadda you know about it, anyway?

1023 
01:16:27,601 --> 01:16:33,401
I think dad would have done it.
- For the love of fuck, D, would you
  just shut up about dad? He's not here.
  It doesn't matter what he would have done.

1024 
01:16:34,801 --> 01:16:36,634
You know something.
He never made good decisions when he was.

1025 
01:16:36,901 --> 01:16:38,534
Well, he'd have known what to do.

1026 
01:16:41,434 --> 01:16:43,000
Yeah, he was just a man, Duncan.

1027 
01:16:48,234 --> 01:16:48,867
Hey.

1028 
01:16:49,367 --> 01:16:52,234
Last week, did you tell Kate
what was going on?  With Sandy?

1029 
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:56,734
I can't let you use my apartment anymore.

1030 
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:01,367
I just don't feel good about it.

1031 
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:03,934
She think I'm a scumbag?

1032 
01:17:06,367 --> 01:17:07,567
I don't know, Jacob.

1033 
01:17:10,034 --> 01:17:12,000
You think you're a scumbag?

1034 
01:17:42,434 --> 01:17:44,601
You're freezing, you want to go inside?

1035 
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:46,667
No, the cold is good for you.
It's invigorating.

1036 
01:17:47,734 --> 01:17:48,967
My dad used to say that when you can

1037 
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:50,867
see your breath it means you're still alive.

1038 
01:17:54,601 --> 01:17:56,901
Okay, so Kate, look, I've been thinking,

1039 
01:17:56,967 --> 01:17:57,634
and

1040 
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,434
you can't leave yet.

1041 
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:04,901
You just you can't go okay,
you can't go to San Diego.

1042 
01:18:05,234 --> 01:18:08,967
Because whatever it is that you're
running from we can take care of it here.

1043 
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:17,701
You can solve it here.
- Whatever I'm running from?  I'm not running
from anything.  I'm running to things, to opportunity.
No, I'm I'm calling bullshit on that because

1044 
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,501
to run to something you have to run from somewhere.

1045 
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:21,367
And that, that's what you do Kate.

1046 
01:18:21,367 --> 01:18:26,767
You you you run away from places because it's
easier for you. You're not attached to anything
so you never get hurt, right?

1047 
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:31,101
I mean, be honest.
Is there a guy like me in every town?

1048 
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:34,101
I don't think there's a guy like you anywhere.

1049 
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:38,834
You can always come with me, you know.

1050 
01:18:39,767 --> 01:18:40,901
To San Diego.

1051 
01:18:42,034 --> 01:18:44,101
Somebody else actually suggested
that too, but...

1052 
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,501
he's losing his mind.

1053 
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:50,267
What's keeping you here?
Your friends?

1054 
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:54,301
The Vikings?
Your misguided sense of loyalty?

1055 
01:18:54,301 --> 01:18:55,401
Kate,

1056 
01:18:55,634 --> 01:18:58,667
I'm loyal because these people stay.

1057 
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:02,000
They stay here and
I like things the way that they are.

1058 
01:19:02,434 --> 01:19:04,834
The way they are or the way that they were?

1059 
01:19:05,934 --> 01:19:08,201
Look, you said it yourself,
this is a good place.

1060 
01:19:08,467 --> 01:19:12,000
Yes it is, but you'd have to go
to other places to know that.

1061 
01:19:12,267 --> 01:19:17,934
Do you think your father would want you
to stay here for eternity, chained to his
memory, chained to your grampa?

1062 
01:19:18,601 --> 01:19:21,834
That's not loyalty Duncan,
that's just being afraid.

1063 
01:19:22,134 --> 01:19:24,601
You know what?  Fuck you Kate.
- Why?

1064 
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:26,067
You don't ...

1065 
01:19:26,867 --> 01:19:29,401
You just ...

1066 
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:35,967
You think this is fun for me?

1067 
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:40,967
Saying goodbye?

1068 
01:19:44,401 --> 01:19:46,801
I liked you before I even met you.

1069 
01:19:47,067 --> 01:19:50,301
From Ruthie's pictures
and Ronald's stories.

1070 
01:19:52,467 --> 01:19:54,501
And then when I met you ...

1071 
01:19:55,201 --> 01:19:56,367
you remember that?

1072 
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,567
It was just familiar.

1073 
01:20:01,601 --> 01:20:02,567
I don't know why.

1074 
01:20:16,967 --> 01:20:18,834
I don't know why.

1075 
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:41,634
[Background music...]

1076 
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:30,401
Hey grampa.

1077 
01:21:34,867 --> 01:21:36,000
Grampa?

1078 
01:21:38,634 --> 01:21:39,634
Grampa!

1079 
01:21:41,634 --> 01:21:43,134
Hey.

1080 
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:45,000
You okay?

1081 
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:47,701
David?

1082 
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:55,267
No grampa, it's Duncan.

1083 
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:57,867
Duncan?

1084 
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:05,134
Duncan Duncan Duncan.

1085 
01:22:08,934 --> 01:22:12,201
Oh Christ.  Oh.

1086 
01:22:14,134 --> 01:22:17,134
You'd think they could have stayed open
a bit longer for the mayor, huh?

1087 
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:17,767
Whoa.

1088 
01:22:20,801 --> 01:22:21,667
Well.

1089 
01:22:22,901 --> 01:22:25,767
What do you say we go buy a
Christmas present for grandma?

1090 
01:22:25,767 --> 01:22:27,067
Christmas?
- Yeah.

1091 
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:30,767
Yeah.

1092 
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:54,167
Disgusting, isn't it?

1093 
01:22:58,734 --> 01:23:01,767
I need, uh.
- What?

1094 
01:23:04,901 --> 01:23:08,834
What? Whaddya need?
- The place.  Where I go.

1095 
01:23:09,534 --> 01:23:10,467
A bathroom?

1096 
01:23:10,834 --> 01:23:17,667
Yes, urinal. Urinal. Urinal.
- Ok, hold on.
Hurry. Goddamn fountains.

1097 
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,101
I should get you a handicap parking sticker.

1098 
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,234
My legs are frozen.

1099 
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:31,534
You alright?
I'll be right outside this door.

1100 
01:23:31,667 --> 01:23:34,067
The zipper, the zipper.

1101 
01:23:37,501 --> 01:23:40,101
Oh God I'm sorry kiddo.

1102 
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:46,601
I'm going, I'm going and I can't stop.

1103 
01:23:47,101 --> 01:23:48,734
I can't stop.

1104 
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,701
I got it. I got it.  Okay.

1105 
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:53,967
Alright. Tilt down a little bit.

1106 
01:23:54,067 --> 01:23:55,201
Okay

1107 
01:23:55,701 --> 01:23:56,467
Okay.

1108 
01:23:56,934 --> 01:23:57,767
You got it from here?

1109 
01:23:58,567 --> 01:24:01,901
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.
- Aw Jesus. Okay.
   There we go. There we go.

1110 
01:24:11,867 --> 01:24:13,000
I'm done.

1111 
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:14,467
Yeah?

1112 
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:20,867
You don't need to wring it out, you know.

1113 
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:27,501
Christ, I gotta go wash my hands.

1114 
01:24:28,434 --> 01:24:29,101
Gotta wash my dick.

1115 
01:24:30,534 --> 01:24:31,834
I don't know where your hand's been.

1116 
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:39,734
Alright, let's get you home.
Unless you actually want to do
some more Christmas shopping.

1117 
01:24:39,734 --> 01:24:41,967
Soaking wet.
I gotta change my pants.

1118 
01:24:41,967 --> 01:24:43,834
Uncle Duncan!

1119 
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,267
Ooh.  Hey.  Hey. ... Hi.

1120 
01:24:47,367 --> 01:24:48,734
What are you doing?

1121 
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:52,434
Uhh, just doing a little Christmas
shopping with grampa.

1122 
01:24:52,701 --> 01:24:57,334
No, I mean what are you doing, you doing here?
You're supposed to be up north hunting.

1123 
01:24:58,101 --> 01:25:00,434
Oh yeah, yeah.  The hunting trip.

1124 
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:04,034
Yeah, hey girls, why don't you
give your grampa a hug?

1125 
01:25:04,701 --> 01:25:07,634
Say hi to grampa.
- I'm all wet, sweetheart, I spilled my coffee.

1126 
01:25:08,034 --> 01:25:08,934
So.

1127 
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,134
What happened?

1128 
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:14,234
Why, I couldn't go.

1129 
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:17,267
I lost my job and uh,

1130 
01:25:18,267 --> 01:25:22,434
I've been helping out with grandma and
grampa which takes up a bunch of time,
so I couldn't make it.

1131 
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:25,434
Yeah, Jacob didn't um,

1132 
01:25:25,934 --> 01:25:26,867
mention that to me, so

1133 
01:25:27,734 --> 01:25:28,101
I just...

1134 
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:33,034
Say goodbye to your grandfather, please.

1135 
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:37,301
Bye grampa.
- Bye girls, bye.
Bye grampa.

1136 
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:41,834
Oh, it's good to see you.

1137 
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:43,501
Bye bye.

1138 
01:25:44,434 --> 01:25:45,434
Bye.
- Merry Christmas.

1139 
01:25:52,867 --> 01:25:54,201
What's her name?

1140 
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:56,334
Cara.

1141 
01:25:59,901 --> 01:26:00,867
It could have been worse.

1142 
01:26:01,634 --> 01:26:02,000
Yeah.

1143 
01:26:02,901 --> 01:26:07,634
I coulda shit myself.
Sterling did that all the time at the end.

1144 
01:26:08,801 --> 01:26:10,201
Like a goddamn baby.

1145 
01:26:10,767 --> 01:26:11,134
Alright, up you go.

1146 
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:15,034
He would have told me to do it.

1147 
01:26:15,267 --> 01:26:16,834
Put him out of his misery.

1148 
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:21,034
But he lost his sense.
- Well, you haven't lost your sense, old man.

1149 
01:26:22,201 --> 01:26:23,967
Those moments come, kiddo.

1150 
01:26:24,967 --> 01:26:26,434
Faster and faster.

1151 
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:29,901
Before you know it, it'll be all the time.

1152 
01:26:31,267 --> 01:26:32,101
Like under water.

1153 
01:26:33,434 --> 01:26:36,000
Then I won't have the brains to

1154 
01:26:36,434 --> 01:26:38,201
ask you to help me.

1155 
01:26:39,601 --> 01:26:41,867
Oh, for Christ sakes, enough of this, old man.

1156 
01:26:42,034 --> 01:26:43,534
Think of grandma.
- I am.

1157 
01:26:44,934 --> 01:26:46,634
Imagine what that woman could do [if]

1158 
01:26:48,701 --> 01:26:53,067
she didn't have me dragging her down.
- I gotta get you ready, she's going to be home soon.

1159 
01:26:53,634 --> 01:26:57,367
Yeah she's out at class, trying to live.

1160 
01:26:59,134 --> 01:27:01,034
I'm like a dead weight.

1161 
01:27:02,101 --> 01:27:04,000
Holding her back from her life, David.

1162 
01:27:05,601 --> 01:27:07,234
Stop doing that.

1163 
01:27:08,901 --> 01:27:13,234
This is David. I'm Duncan.
I know you know the difference, old man.

1164 
01:27:13,301 --> 01:27:14,000
Stop doing that.

1165 
01:27:16,701 --> 01:27:17,467
I loved him.

1166 
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:22,134
I wasn't a good enough
father to him, Duncan.

1167 
01:27:23,301 --> 01:27:24,534
Nothing's been the same.

1168 
01:27:27,767 --> 01:27:28,767
He's gone, isn't he?

1169 
01:27:30,301 --> 01:27:30,834
Yes.

1170 
01:27:32,101 --> 01:27:33,534
Yes, he's gone, grampa.

1171 
01:27:35,101 --> 01:27:35,834
He would have helped me.

1172 
01:27:36,734 --> 01:27:37,367
He loved me.

1173 
01:27:38,534 --> 01:27:40,767
He would have pulled the goddamn

1174 
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,634
trigger if I'd asked him to.

1175 
01:27:47,301 --> 01:27:47,634
Oh.

1176 
01:28:01,301 --> 01:28:04,301
[Packing ...]

1177 
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:43,000
Grampa, what are you doing out there.
It's freezing.

1178 
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:48,667
Grampa.

1179 
01:28:49,867 --> 01:28:50,301
Grampa.

1180 
01:28:52,467 --> 01:28:54,667
This reminds me of the porch out here.

1181 
01:28:55,234 --> 01:28:56,401
Remember the porch?

1182 
01:28:57,401 --> 01:29:00,534
We used to sit out there eating
ice cream, you and me and Jake.

1183 
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:04,301
Jake always went inside early.

1184 
01:29:05,634 --> 01:29:07,534
You'd stay on the porch with me.

1185 
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,201
Look at 'em dance.

1186 
01:29:12,467 --> 01:29:16,867
Look at what, the stars?
- The lights. The northern lights.

1187 
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:18,501
Aurora

1188 
01:29:21,701 --> 01:29:22,367
Aurora

1189 
01:29:24,701 --> 01:29:26,101
Aurora Borealis, grampa.

1190 
01:29:29,334 --> 01:29:30,634
Colors are good tonight,

1191 
01:29:31,967 --> 01:29:34,567
just like they used to be on the porch up north.

1192 
01:29:35,967 --> 01:29:36,834
Your dad.

1193 
01:29:38,134 --> 01:29:40,801
Only way I could get him to sit still.

1194 
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:44,201
He loved the lights.

1195 
01:29:45,101 --> 01:29:45,901
Sit and watch him.

1196 
01:29:46,901 --> 01:29:53,067
Okay, let's go inside.
- If I was an eskimo.
Please grampa, let's go inside.
- If I was an eskimo.

1197 
01:29:53,867 --> 01:29:58,234
I'd just walk out into the snow
and go to sleep.

1198 
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:02,467
That's what they do up there,
the old ones.

1199 
01:30:03,101 --> 01:30:05,167
Just walk out into the lights.

1200 
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:09,967
It's what's expected.
You're a wonderful skater, Duncan.

1201 
01:30:10,467 --> 01:30:12,034
You're a wonderful skater.

1202 
01:30:12,834 --> 01:30:15,134
Tell Santa Claus what you want, David.

1203 
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:20,000
His house is there,
underneath the lights.
You tell the lights.

1204 
01:30:20,934 --> 01:30:23,267
Your dad, he loved the lights.

1205 
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:26,967
Just to sit and watch.
The lights take the cold away.

1206 
01:30:28,567 --> 01:30:29,167
Cold.

1207 
01:30:31,034 --> 01:30:32,167
Like Chris[mas].

1208 
01:30:33,067 --> 01:30:34,234
coming off ice.

1209 
01:30:34,867 --> 01:30:37,401
I can walk out onto the ice.

1210 
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:41,334
Tell Santa Claus what you want, David.

1211 
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,434
His house is there,

1212 
01:30:44,267 --> 01:30:46,301
underneath the lights.
You tell the lights.

1213 
01:30:47,334 --> 01:30:48,301
Tell him out loud.

1214 
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,567
What you want.

1215 
01:30:51,401 --> 01:30:51,967
You want a sled.

1216 
01:30:59,134 --> 01:30:59,501
Duncan.

1217 
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:02,567
Oh Christ.

1218 
01:31:02,934 --> 01:31:06,134
Duncan.  Oh.

1219 
01:31:20,567 --> 01:31:22,867
Move the chair there, against the wall.

1220 
01:31:23,334 --> 01:31:25,634
Back it up against the wall.
I don't want to make a mess.

1221 
01:31:26,867 --> 01:31:28,801
Christ, kiddo, don't cry.

1222 
01:31:29,301 --> 01:31:31,000
This is the best gift you could have

1223 
01:31:31,134 --> 01:31:31,667
given me.

1224 
01:31:32,467 --> 01:31:34,401
I love you Duncan. I love you.

1225 
01:31:36,567 --> 01:31:38,067
Take off my sock, will you?

1226 
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:41,467
Take off my sock, that's how they do it.

1227 
01:31:42,967 --> 01:31:43,701
With the toe.

1228 
01:31:45,734 --> 01:31:46,201
Oh Christ.

1229 
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:47,434
Thank you.

1230 
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,901
Oh thank you.

1231 
01:31:50,634 --> 01:31:53,834
Look my goddamn hands are shakin' too much.
I can't hold the gun.

1232 
01:31:54,501 --> 01:31:55,534
Hold it for me will ya?

1233 
01:31:56,567 --> 01:31:57,934
Oh.  I love you, kid.

1234 
01:31:59,167 --> 01:32:02,334
Move it away, move it away a little.
I've got to get my leg up.

1235 
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:05,567
That's a boy, that's a good boy.

1236 
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:08,034
Okay, good boy.  Now when I get my

1237 
01:32:08,467 --> 01:32:09,167
toe set,

1238 
01:32:10,101 --> 01:32:11,401
you give the gun back to me,

1239 
01:32:12,034 --> 01:32:13,667
get the hell outta here.

1240 
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:15,234
You tell Ruth...

1241 
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:16,934
No!
[Shotgun goes off]

1242 
01:32:17,134 --> 01:32:19,801
Jesus Christ.
- I can't do this for you, grampa.

1243 
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,934
Duncan, it was my shell.

1244 
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:24,401
[Bring it back.]

1245 
01:32:25,701 --> 01:32:26,267
Oh.

1246 
01:32:27,767 --> 01:32:28,334
Oh.

1247 
01:32:31,734 --> 01:32:33,834
[Heart attack]

1248 
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:38,501
[Door opens]

1249 
01:32:38,767 --> 01:32:40,467
Ronald, I'm home.

1250 
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:42,367
[Door shuts]

1251 
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:44,901
Ronald?

1252 
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,667
Oh... [panic]

1253 
01:32:47,201 --> 01:32:48,201
Ronald?

1254 
01:32:49,434 --> 01:32:50,567
Ron?

1255 
01:32:52,201 --> 01:32:53,567
Oh, it's alright.

1256 
01:32:54,501 --> 01:32:55,167
It's alright.

1257 
01:32:56,101 --> 01:32:56,834
It's alright.

1258 
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:06,134
It's alright, Ronald.

1259 
01:33:09,367 --> 01:33:13,767
Grandma?  Hey, grandma! Grampa!
- He's gone, Duncan.

1260 
01:33:13,967 --> 01:33:14,567
Duncan.

1261 
01:33:15,434 --> 01:33:16,201
It's alright.

1262 
01:33:17,701 --> 01:33:18,534
It's okay.

1263 
01:33:19,701 --> 01:33:20,567
He's gone now.

1264 
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:44,834
Oh.  God.

1265 
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
[Knocks on door]

1266 
01:33:53,434 --> 01:33:55,267
Kate?

1267 
01:33:57,501 --> 01:33:58,401
[Knocks on door again]

1268 
01:33:58,901 --> 01:34:00,801
Kate!

1269 
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
[Knocks on door again]

1270 
01:34:07,634 --> 01:34:09,467
Kate.

1271 
01:34:20,601 --> 01:34:24,101
[Crying]

1272 
01:34:30,534 --> 01:34:32,067
Let us give a moment of silence.

1273 
01:34:46,401 --> 01:34:46,901
Amen.

1274 
01:35:16,667 --> 01:35:20,834
Hey Kate?
Can you help with the car, please?
- Okay.

1275 
01:35:45,367 --> 01:35:47,234
Did you know I come up here?

1276 
01:35:47,267 --> 01:35:48,534
When I'm ever, um,

1277 
01:35:48,601 --> 01:35:50,767
out fishing at a cabin or whatever.

1278 
01:35:52,201 --> 01:35:53,734
Oh yeah, four, five times a year.

1279 
01:35:57,534 --> 01:35:58,301
Nah, I never knew that.

1280 
01:35:59,101 --> 01:36:01,467
Oh yeah, yeah.
Sort of a motivational thing for me.

1281 
01:36:07,934 --> 01:36:10,401
Everything I've ever done
I've done to make him proud.

1282 
01:36:10,867 --> 01:36:11,701
Make this

1283 
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:14,234
block of granite proud.

1284 
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:17,701
School. The job.

1285 
01:36:18,901 --> 01:36:20,367
Cara and the girls.  All for him.

1286 
01:36:33,234 --> 01:36:36,434
Lately, I don't think he'd be so proud.

1287 
01:36:37,534 --> 01:36:39,134
So I needed to see this, you know?

1288 
01:36:39,367 --> 01:36:40,301
Remind myself that...

1289 
01:36:42,734 --> 01:36:45,401
And you, you fuckin' idiot,
you need to remind yourself of this.

1290 
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:48,167
It was a long time ago, Duncan.

1291 
01:36:49,667 --> 01:36:50,267
Quit

1292 
01:36:50,801 --> 01:36:54,501
wasting your shit, you know.
Do something. Make him proud.

1293 
01:36:55,767 --> 01:36:56,601
Make 'em both proud.

1294 
01:36:59,367 --> 01:37:02,534
[Cries]

1295 
01:37:06,567 --> 01:37:08,734
He'd have been proud of you, Jake.
- Yeah.

1296 
01:37:12,967 --> 01:37:13,467
ah

1297 
01:37:17,434 --> 01:37:20,301
Oh yeah, I uh,
I need a place to stay for a few months.

1298 
01:37:26,601 --> 01:37:27,034
Oh.

1299 
01:37:29,201 --> 01:37:30,901
Hey.  Come here, man.

1300 
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:44,601
[Exits door]
[Proprieter: Thank you.]

1301 
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:57,834
Okay, so here's my address where
I'm going to be for the next 
twelve months.

1302 
01:37:58,367 --> 01:37:59,734
And I expect you to write.

1303 
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:02,567
Or you could just

1304 
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:04,767
stop by one day.

1305 
01:38:06,867 --> 01:38:07,601
Maybe I'll do that.

1306 
01:38:08,934 --> 01:38:09,867
You know, when your nipples thaw.

1307 
01:38:10,634 --> 01:38:11,134
Laughs.

1308 
01:38:15,401 --> 01:38:16,267
I got this for you.

1309 
01:38:20,934 --> 01:38:22,501
So you can start your collection.

1310 
01:38:23,967 --> 01:38:25,801
You're gonna make me cry.

1311 
01:38:28,767 --> 01:38:31,567
I don't know which one is me.  [Laughs]

1312 
01:38:32,401 --> 01:38:33,367
That's you right there.

1313 
01:38:34,167 --> 01:38:36,367
That looks like Finn.
- No, that's Finn.

1314 
01:38:36,434 --> 01:38:36,967
That's you.

1315 
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:38,867
[Laughs]

1316 
01:38:39,067 --> 01:38:40,201
[Horn honks]

1317 
01:38:43,267 --> 01:38:44,101
Okay.

1318 
01:38:53,901 --> 01:38:56,000
Duncan, I know you think I just

1319 
01:38:56,434 --> 01:38:59,467
breeze through these towns
and I never get hurt, but ...

1320 
01:39:02,534 --> 01:39:04,567
It really hurts to leave you here.

1321 
01:39:08,201 --> 01:39:10,334
And this is just a place, you know.

1322 
01:39:15,034 --> 01:39:16,267
[Horn honks again]

1323 
01:39:16,267 --> 01:39:18,134
Asshole!

1324 
01:39:19,534 --> 01:39:22,000
Please don't let that be the
 last word I ever hear you say.

1325 
01:39:22,967 --> 01:39:24,201
[Horn honks again]

1326 
01:39:25,534 --> 01:39:26,267
Prick!

1327 
01:39:26,701 --> 01:39:27,634
Much better.

1328 
01:39:28,934 --> 01:39:29,801
Okay.

1329 
01:39:59,901 --> 01:40:04,000
Kate!
[Westerberg getting gas,
giving an autograph]

1330 
01:40:21,967 --> 01:40:22,901
It's all yours, Stu.

1331 
01:40:24,534 --> 01:40:24,901
Right.

1332 
01:40:31,534 --> 01:40:32,434
Put in a little extra for you, you know?

1333 
01:40:33,367 --> 01:40:34,167
In case you need some help.

1334 
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,601
Thanks, Stu.

1335 
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:40,967
Anything to help, peckerwood.

1336 
01:40:41,634 --> 01:40:42,134
You know that.

1337 
01:40:53,734 --> 01:40:55,101
Hey Stu?
- Yeah?

1338 
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:10,334
The night that my dad died.

1339 
01:41:14,467 --> 01:41:15,567
Was he doing cocaine?

1340 
01:41:16,067 --> 01:41:16,801
Is that what killed him?

1341 
01:41:18,334 --> 01:41:18,634
No.

1342 
01:41:20,101 --> 01:41:20,601
Not at all.

1343 
01:41:26,501 --> 01:41:27,934
I need to know that that's the truth.

1344 
01:41:29,901 --> 01:41:30,367
Please.

1345 
01:41:33,567 --> 01:41:33,901
Yeah.

1346 
01:41:37,767 --> 01:41:40,000
I tried to get him to do a few lines but um,

1347 
01:41:41,867 --> 01:41:42,501
that night

1348 
01:41:44,501 --> 01:41:45,234
he was scared man.

1349 
01:41:52,934 --> 01:41:54,567
He was so much fun when he got high, but...

1350 
01:41:55,367 --> 01:41:56,601
I dunno.

1351 
01:42:00,101 --> 01:42:02,067
He didn't want to do anything,
you know, he was afraid

1352 
01:42:02,101 --> 01:42:02,501
he thought that

1353 
01:42:03,501 --> 01:42:05,134
if he did something
he'd leave you and your brother

1354 
01:42:06,201 --> 01:42:07,067
behind and

1355 
01:42:08,701 --> 01:42:10,234
that would be not so good, you know.

1356 
01:42:10,367 --> 01:42:10,801
So,

1357 
01:42:11,867 --> 01:42:13,601
you two were the only thing
in his life you know that.

1358 
01:42:18,667 --> 01:42:19,701
We all flipped him shit, and uh,

1359 
01:42:23,434 --> 01:42:24,501
it got real heated.

1360 
01:42:26,601 --> 01:42:27,167
Then uh,

1361 
01:42:29,067 --> 01:42:31,501
we got all worked up and stormed out.

1362 
01:42:36,034 --> 01:42:37,934
I found him face down on the driveway.

1363 
01:42:43,534 --> 01:42:45,334
My best friend

1364 
01:42:49,901 --> 01:42:50,501
and I

1365 
01:42:54,301 --> 01:42:54,734
I called.

1366 
01:42:57,467 --> 01:42:57,901
Okay.

1367 
01:43:04,034 --> 01:43:05,667
That was a long time ago.

1368 
01:44:19,101 --> 01:44:23,601
[Traveling]
[Traveling music]

1369 
01:45:40,601 --> 01:45:43,401
So, turns out they got a pretty good
engineering school here in San Diego.

1370 
01:45:45,334 --> 01:45:47,934
I can't believe.
