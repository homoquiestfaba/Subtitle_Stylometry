1
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,226
Doctor, the captain told me
we were in the South Seas now.

2
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:33,235
Right in the heart of them.

3
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:35,464
That's right, madame.

4
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,870
The South Sea islands.

5
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:42,241
The last hiding place
of beauty and adventure.

6
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,140
That's what all
the travel folders say.

7
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:50,846
l thought you'd been here before,
and that you adored the islands.

8
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,185
Yes, l do in my own way.

9
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:59,659
What's that wretched-looking spot
we're passing?

10
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:02,721
lt's one of the South Sea isles.

11
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,632
Nothing like that is mentioned
in the folders.

12
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:09,331
Well, it's a little in disrepute.

13
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,306
lt was mentioned
in all the folders once.

14
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:17,745
That silly-looking sand waste?

15
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:20,510
Has it a name?

16
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,983
lt's the island of Manukura.

17
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:27,489
That was once the most beautiful
of all the islands...

18
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:30,822
that raised their little green heads
above these waters.

19
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:36,628
The most beautiful and enchanting
bit of paradise in all the world.

20
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:47,933
l always throw it a kiss
when l pass it.

21
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,979
Excuse me, madame.

22
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,681
What happened to it?

23
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,380
lt made the mistake of being born
in the heart of the hurricane belt.

24
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:59,146
You've stolen a canoe.
Stealing is against the law.

25
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,706
You must pay the penalty
for breaking the law.

26
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:04,753
You are sentenced
to 30 days punishment.

27
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:10,054
When you have finished 30 days, you will
know better than to break the law again.

28
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,261
l don't understand.

29
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:16,764
He says...

30
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:22,430
He's defending himself against the power
of the French government and very ably.

31
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:24,200
Does he deny the theft?

32
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:28,573
No. He offers in rebuttal
that there was moonlight.

33
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:31,044
An awful lot of it.

34
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,878
And his lady love says...

35
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,817
she saw a gold fish in the sea.

36
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,183
My dear doctor...

37
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,954
l am as sensitive to the whims of love
as the next man.

38
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,087
But as governor of these islands,
l cannot afford...

39
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:50,894
to sit 'round admiring
the quaint and the curious.

40
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,958
Thirty days, my good fellow.

41
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,769
lt's not exactly my business,
de Laage...

42
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,535
but you've only been here a year.

43
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,203
Whereas l, indolent wretch...

44
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,475
have spent a pitifully long time
on these islands.

45
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:08,210
- l know these people.
- You're wasting your time pleading.

46
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,879
l'm not pleading.
l'm pleading for you...

47
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,650
not this scoundrel of a canoe thief.

48
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,994
You're a sensitive man.

49
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:22,554
You'll do something to yourself if you
govern these somewhat childish people...

50
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,567
according to your ideas
instead of theirs.

51
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,569
You'll destroy yourself.

52
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:32,574
That sounds very ominous.
What is that?

53
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:38,004
Father Paul has sighted the Katopua.

54
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,845
- He's chattering in his belfry.
- Come along, Doctor.

55
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:44,819
You can complain about
my tyrannical soul to Madame de Laage.

56
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:49,654
Your wife will like it if you let
this miserable canoe-snatcher go.

57
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:53,422
As a homecoming gift!

58
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:58,058
Chief Mehevi, he's sentenced to
30 days hard labor on the coral reef.

59
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:01,263
My dear Doctor...

60
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:05,671
l am ready to give my wife and my
friends anything l own in the world...

61
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,675
except my sense of honor and duty.

62
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:11,839
A sense of honor in the South Seas
is about as useful and often as silly...

63
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:14,280
as a silk hat in a hurricane.

64
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,798
Marama!

65
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:06,244
- l think the ship never comes home.
- Me, too.

66
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:08,483
l think the wind never blows.
l feel like praying...

67
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:11,492
for the wind that overturns the world
to hurry the Katopua home.

68
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,653
l worry about everything
when you're away.

69
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:17,221
About the wind, the waves.
Sometimes l worry the fish eat you up.

70
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,598
Me? You worry about me?

71
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:22,160
- Why l'm the best sailor in the world!
- l know.

72
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:24,229
- l'm the best swimmer, too.
- l know.

73
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:29,006
And tonight when we come out of church,
l'm the best husband in the world.

74
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,979
- l know, l know.
- Shut up. You don't know anything yet.

75
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,244
Eugene.

76
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:28,498
- Oh, Germaine.
- Darling, it seemed forever!

77
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:32,007
All my happiness went with you
to France...

78
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:34,042
but it's returned now.

79
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,951
O Heavenly Father...

80
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,080
we thank Thee for the safe return
of our loved ones.

81
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:49,784
Amen.

82
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,091
Your health, madame.

83
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:03,195
We certainly missed
your civilizing influence.

84
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,206
Here's to your homecoming.

85
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:08,903
Your health, Doctor, and Father Paul's
and yours, Chief Mehevi.

86
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,414
All our people are happy
that you come back.

87
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,881
Thank you.
Tell me, Father Paul...

88
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,418
how's my husband been
conducting himself in my absence?

89
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,011
Like a good governor.

90
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,785
- Has he fallen under the tropic's spell?
- No, madame!

91
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:26,316
He's been staunchly under the spell
of honor and duty.

92
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:29,762
l don't suppose there's any use
of my inquiring...

93
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,995
whether my uncle answered
my application to return to France?

94
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,865
No. He said nothing.

95
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:39,340
Farewell, old Cafe de Rostand
for another year.

96
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:40,773
l'm sorry.

97
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:45,337
Yes. And in Paris, our good doctor
would weep day and night...

98
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:48,110
for his little half-drowned homeland...

99
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,243
the island of Manukura.

100
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:54,949
Why, he's as deeply rooted in this place
as l am, or Chief Mehevi.

101
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,050
My roots are parched, Captain.

102
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,561
We'll drink this one to Mehevi.

103
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,893
l brought him back the finest
bridegroom in the islands.

104
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:06,696
Yes, l know.
l see him jump from mast.

105
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,760
Who's that?

106
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,305
Terangi.

107
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,535
l'm delighted to hear the news. l didn't
know he was marrying your daughter.

108
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:17,943
You've been too busy
with your report cards to France.

109
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:20,743
The romance is known
to every child in the islands.

110
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:22,249
l'm delighted.

111
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,253
Terangi is utterly charming.
He was delightful on the trip.

112
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:29,815
He'd hang from the top of the mast like
a bird with wings stretched for home.

113
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,725
l hope you'll be able to leave him
behind for one voyage, Captain.

114
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,389
He's planning on spending
his honeymoon in a canoe.

115
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:38,956
lt won't be a long honeymoon.

116
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:43,994
l'd as soon sail without sails
as without my first mate.

117
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,601
The more l see these natives, the more
l think they're more bird than man.

118
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:51,874
Terangi can smell a wind
before it's begun to blow.

119
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:54,575
He knows every rock
on the sea bottom...

120
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,346
and he runs a ship
as if it were a pair of shoes.

121
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,479
l was saying that very thing
to de Laage.

122
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,719
l wasted ten good minutes pointing out
he's the governor of a flock of birds.

123
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,522
Not birds that should be put
in a cage...

124
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:11,294
but birds that should be allowed to
flutter through the sky which they own.

125
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14,359
With stolen canoes in their bills,
you forgot to mention.

126
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,203
When are the nuptials
to take place, Father?

127
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,539
The wedding will begin at sundown...

128
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,047
and will continue until the entire
native population is exhausted.

129
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,489
Wait a minute.
l wanna give a toast.

130
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:24,492
My dear people...

131
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,327
l am very happy
and l'm a little sad...

132
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:32,299
because when l return to France...

133
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:34,301
any day now...

134
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:38,237
l shall miss your happy faces.

135
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:43,973
But l leave with you
my very, very dearest love.

136
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:50,618
And to Terangi...

137
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,483
and Marama...

138
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:11,746
Terangi, l had a dream.

139
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,948
l had no dream. l slept.

140
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,550
Terangi, don't sail away
on the ship.

141
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:21,357
Without me,
the ship doesn't move.

142
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,194
lt stands still
in the middle of a wind.

143
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:26,996
Don't sail away.

144
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:30,163
l don't want to,
but l smell a wind coming.

145
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:33,105
By noon, the wind will be good.

146
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:37,703
l dreamed that all the birds
flew away from Manukura.

147
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,212
From Manukura?

148
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:42,739
Where did they fly to?
There's no place to go.

149
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:45,286
They flew away.

150
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:47,549
Did you dream there was a wind?

151
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,518
No. lt was quiet.

152
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:57,153
Only the sky
was full of birds flying away.

153
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:00,763
The dream's no good.

154
00:22:02,871 --> 00:22:06,830
Because how could the birds fly away
if there is no wind?

155
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,639
They only leave
when the ifu mantui comes.

156
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:13,374
The wind that overturns the world.

157
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:19,745
The world is gone when you go away.
Stay here.

158
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:23,757
You're married a few days and already
you're an old wife full of worries.

159
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:25,759
What are you worried about?

160
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:28,762
- About your going away.
- l come back!

161
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,856
- lf something happens to the boat...
- l swim back. Where's my cap?

162
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,002
lt's very funny what a difference
a cap makes in the world.

163
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:42,203
ln Tahiti, when l wear this cap,
everybody is my friend.

164
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:46,771
You think l'm just Terangi who swam
with you when you were a little fish.

165
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:53,552
ln Tahiti, when l sit in a cafe with
this cap on l'm the same as a white man.

166
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:56,448
Take me with you.

167
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:59,426
No, please.
l like to, but l can't.

168
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:03,294
Please! l won't take any room.
l'll sleep on top of the mast.

169
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:07,233
You can hang me over the boat's side
at night and pull me along with a rope.

170
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,738
Only take me.
Please, take me.

171
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:36,054
Quiet, quiet.

172
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:45,626
What in blazes are you doin' aboard
this boat, Marama?

173
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,634
Please, l go to Tahiti.

174
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:51,502
- How did she get aboard? You bring her?
- No, l come in a bag like a coconut.

175
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:56,169
What's wrong with going to Tahiti?
l never been. l go just once.

176
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:00,305
Listen, the longer you stay aboard,
the further you'll have to swim back.

177
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:02,316
You have no reason to go to Tahiti.

178
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:06,184
Oh, yes. l buy a dress
with a ribbon on.

179
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,188
And red shoes with high heels.

180
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,986
And a hat with a feather,
and a petticoat with flounces.

181
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:13,118
And a doll that dances.

182
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:16,722
All right. You stay on board.

183
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,757
But we'll take Terangi's cap away
and he's through being a first mate.

184
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:26,171
l can't have a first mate with a bride.
He'll be an ordinary sailor.

185
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,436
Scrubbing decks. Gimme that cap.

186
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,843
Oh, no, no. Don't take his cap.

187
00:25:31,913 --> 00:25:34,677
No, Terangi, he won't.

188
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:36,182
Good-bye.

189
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:38,242
Hurry back.

190
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,609
Aloha!

191
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:05,138
l can't give you anything but love

192
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,847
Marama!

193
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:51,214
Get up!

194
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:56,347
Get up!

195
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,086
Get up, l said!

196
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:14,402
Clear out!
Get up when a white man tells ya!

197
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:39,166
Terangi, get back on the ship.

198
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,907
My warrant says
the man's jaw was broken.

199
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,779
l don't care if his jaw was broken!
Pity it wasn't his neck.

200
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:57,340
l saw the whole thing,
and my mate is not to blame.

201
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,685
lf you're his witness, Captain,
there won't be any trouble.

202
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:03,849
But he's got to be surrendered.

203
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:07,022
All right. Come on.

204
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,454
But l'm going along.
l'll see the governor about this.

205
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:15,094
l've spent hours, Governor,
trying to find out why my first mate...

206
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:20,198
is sentenced to six months in jail
for doing exactly as you or l would do.

207
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:22,209
Your boy hits too hard.

208
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:26,737
Not hard enough. l saw the whole thing.
l even testified in court.

209
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:29,249
The sentence is unjust.

210
00:29:30,218 --> 00:29:32,948
But surely six months in jail
isn't unheard of...

211
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,990
in a serious case
of assault and battery.

212
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:39,254
Come, Nagle, it isn't a matter
of life and death.

213
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:41,488
You don't know the Tuamotu natives.

214
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:45,329
They're not like your Tahitians.
They can't stand confinement.

215
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,497
There's something behind this. A matter
of maintaining European prestige?

216
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:53,268
A native mustn't raise his hand
against a white man?

217
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:56,208
Your boy not only hit too hard...

218
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:59,041
but he hit the wrong man.

219
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:00,944
That rum-soaked bully.

220
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:04,507
Strange as it seems,
he has influence at home.

221
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:07,384
As soon as he recovered consciousness
in the hospital...

222
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:10,015
he cabled the Ministry of Colonies.

223
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:13,219
So Terangi is made
a victim of politics.

224
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,660
l'm afraid you're right, Nagle.

225
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,463
l sail for Manukura in three days.
You can't pardon him?

226
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:23,231
Later, perhaps. Not now.

227
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:29,534
l've done all l can.

228
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:33,479
You'll have to take your punishment
quietly and cheerfully.

229
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:35,982
You hit too hard, man.
That's all.

230
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:40,978
The next time you hit a man,
take care not to break his jaw.

231
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:44,513
You're too much of a man
to store up any bitterness.

232
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,686
Your berth will be waiting on my ship.

233
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,698
Time will pass quickly.

234
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,394
l'll explain everything to your wife.

235
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:02,108
Will you give her this?

236
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:04,269
Sure, l will.

237
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:07,212
Don't you worry about her.

238
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,443
Remember what l've told you.

239
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:30,704
l'll tell you what l'll do.

240
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:35,573
l'll put him on the road gang.
Keep him outdoors all day.

241
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,305
He's going to take his medicine
all right.

242
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,414
l hope so.

243
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:57,878
Wasting water, eh, convict?

244
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:02,381
The Katopua.

245
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,018
And wouldn't you like
to be going home on her!

246
00:34:09,263 --> 00:34:11,663
Come on, pick 'em up.
Get movin'.

247
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:51,961
Captain Nagle!

248
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:10,250
Chappeli, coffee.

249
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,478
Captain Nagle!

250
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:07,533
l wouldn't have had this happen
for anything, son.

251
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:11,544
lt just hangs another year
on your sentence. That's the penalty.

252
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:16,278
That's what l've got to go by:
the law.

253
00:37:17,618 --> 00:37:22,180
Lucky you didn't break from the inside.
That would've added five years.

254
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:27,322
Now you behave yourself.

255
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:30,592
We don't want to keep you here
any longer than we've got to.

256
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:38,564
The long and short of it was,
l couldn't do a thing for Terangi.

257
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:40,566
How silly, how unjust.

258
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,568
- lt's up to you.
- To me?

259
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:45,002
l fail to see in what way.

260
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,337
As governor of his island, you can ask
to have him paroled in your care.

261
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,608
And much as l should like
to do just that...

262
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:57,617
l don't think it wise to interfere
with the administration of the law.

263
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:01,815
Oh, administration of fiddlesticks!
The man's absolutely right.

264
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,915
lt isn't a matter of law.
lt's political pull and injustice.

265
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:10,020
Just a minute. Let me explain the case
a little less legally.

266
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:14,625
De Laage, our friend Terangi
isn't just an errand-running islander.

267
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:18,968
He's the best loved of every man, woman
and three-year-old child in Manukura.

268
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,067
You're not only allowing him to rot
in jail, but offending your subjects.

269
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:26,079
And what's worse,
you're hurting yourself.

270
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:29,913
Your concern for my soul
has flattered me for some time.

271
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:33,044
l must ask you to concern yourself
with my more physical ailments.

272
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,420
He means well, dear.
He's only saying what we all think.

273
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:41,894
l know he means well.
l know you all mean well.

274
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,897
But l am not the representative
of well-meaning points of view.

275
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,899
l represent a civilization...

276
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:51,995
that cannot afford to show confusion
or conflict to the people it governs.

277
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:56,133
The law has spoken in Tahiti.

278
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,337
l must uphold that law.

279
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:04,543
Would it influence
your sense of duty at all...

280
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:07,712
to know that Mrs. Terangi
is about to be a mother?

281
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:09,722
Really?

282
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,519
That's wonderful!

283
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:14,823
That puts everything in a different
light. Explain to the authorities.

284
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,829
No. lt puts me in a worse light.

285
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:22,335
Now l'm not only Terangi's persecutor,
l'm the oppressor of an unborn child.

286
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:25,736
l think it's unfair to appeal
to a side of me that's very strong...

287
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:28,741
but that simply cannot
function as governor.

288
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:31,004
l understand you, de Laage.

289
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:33,069
Thank you.

290
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:35,945
And my heart feels sad for you.

291
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:40,112
Though six months isn't forever.

292
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,418
Terangi's young.
Let's make the best of it.

293
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:46,790
So easy to say, Father.
But l have to tell her.

294
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:52,022
Yes. He sent her a little gift.

295
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,727
Oh, l'll take it to her.

296
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:57,862
There's no need for you
to put yourself out, darling.

297
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:03,475
Yes, there is.

298
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,741
ln six months, it'll all be over.

299
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:11,842
He'll be back, and you'll both
forget so soon.

300
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,477
Go away.

301
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:19,047
l want you to come with me and live
in my house while you're waiting.

302
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:21,151
There's a lovely garden
and you can sit...

303
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,992
l don't go to your house.

304
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,657
lt'll be easier.

305
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,100
l don't want it any easier.

306
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:32,566
Terangi in a jail.

307
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:36,405
You're right.

308
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:38,945
lt won't be long...

309
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:42,449
because no jail can hold Terangi
very long.

310
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:45,246
lf it has a window, he'll fly away.

311
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:47,719
lf it has water around it,
he'll swim away.

312
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:51,019
And everybody will laugh at the jail
that tried to hold Terangi.

313
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:54,026
They'll laugh.

314
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:06,640
lt's another two years, Terangi.

315
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:10,438
Every time you try to break out,
it's two more years.

316
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,273
Understand? Two more years.

317
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:10,095
That's two more years, Terangi.

318
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,247
He cannot possibly escape.

319
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:13,824
- You have jurisdiction over this case!
- l don't deny it.

320
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,667
You're the only man who can save him
from this mad thing that's happening.

321
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,672
- He's broken the law.
- What law?

322
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,937
The law that condemned him
unjustly to prison?

323
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,945
That refused him the simple rights
of a human being?

324
00:44:26,013 --> 00:44:28,481
l can't.

325
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:32,713
Eugene, don't be angry
at what l'm going to say.

326
00:44:32,786 --> 00:44:35,448
l love you. l know your heart.

327
00:44:35,522 --> 00:44:39,925
Please stop. My feelings are my own.
l won't have them discussed.

328
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:45,856
Sixteen years in a cell with rats
for companions! And for what?

329
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,959
For thinking himself
greater than the law.

330
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:53,132
For breaking jail.
For defying authority.

331
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:56,608
Man alive!
You can't do it!

332
00:44:56,677 --> 00:45:00,875
You know what these people are,
and Terangi's the best of them.

333
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,883
He'll not live in a cell!
He'll die!

334
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:07,953
You're condemning
an innocent man to death...

335
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:11,616
out of a cold-blooded whim
called honor and duty.

336
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:15,719
Will you listen to Mehevi? Perhaps
the chief can think of something.

337
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,060
Tell him what you think would be just.

338
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,123
Excellency...

339
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,692
the people in my island
were all happy before.

340
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:26,331
Now they're very unhappy.

341
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:29,535
This is not good law
or good justice.

342
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,677
You once asked me not to worry
about your soul...

343
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,743
but to concern myself
with more pharmaceutical matters.

344
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,984
Well, l'm back on that worry.

345
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:48,118
You're not only condemning poor Terangi,
you're condemning yourself.

346
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:51,756
You're condemning yourself to black
nights and dreams of ugly remorse...

347
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:56,997
to the betterment of a man who prefers
to be a martinet instead of a human.

348
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:02,032
You'll see your guilt as a man
written in every face in Manukura.

349
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:06,443
You'll walk as if you were dead among
them, without a smile or a greeting...

350
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,346
if you lived in these islands
for 100 hears.

351
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:12,676
lt'll dry you up!

352
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:16,682
lt'll kill your heart.

353
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:20,816
l am doing my duty.

354
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:27,293
l come of a family that has administered
my country's affairs for generations.

355
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:31,360
l understand how strongly
your humanitarian feelings run.

356
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:35,238
And yours, Germaine,
and yours, Mehevi.

357
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:38,870
Understand mine then.
They run as deep.

358
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:40,880
There is no Terangi.

359
00:46:40,948 --> 00:46:45,078
There is only a man who has set himself
above and beyond the law.

360
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:51,187
lt is not a question of justice
or injustice to a human being.

361
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:55,957
lt is a question of upholding the law
under which these islands are governed.

362
00:46:56,029 --> 00:47:00,523
l am not asking for anyone's smiles
as my reward.

363
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,188
Take a good look, convict.

364
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:32,358
You haven't got fat Sam to deal with.

365
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:36,266
He wouldn't take my advice
and now he's out.

366
00:47:36,336 --> 00:47:38,270
And now l'm in.

367
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:41,935
And by all that's holy,
you're in.

368
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:48,312
And you're gonna serve every day
of your 16 years.

369
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:52,512
And if you ever want
that iron off your leg...

370
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:54,713
you're gonna break, see?

371
00:47:56,056 --> 00:48:00,720
You're gonna open that ugly mouth
of yours and act like a human being!

372
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,783
Get that door open!
Hurry up!

373
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,095
Come on, you blundering fool!

374
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:34,271
Warden.

375
00:54:59,279 --> 00:55:02,442
Did you ask the doctor over tonight
for chess?

376
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:05,143
Yes. l'm sorry, he was busy.

377
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,776
And Father Paul?

378
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,611
He had a christening.

379
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:13,155
What's that noise?

380
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:16,428
l don't know.

381
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:20,224
There's no festival
this time of year.

382
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,335
What are you going to do?

383
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,496
Gonna have a walk,
take a look around.

384
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,506
l'll go with you.

385
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,983
Get your wrap.

386
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,493
l will.

387
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:54,328
Perhaps it's something nice, a native
dance we haven't been told about.

388
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:56,562
Get your wrap.

389
00:56:51,624 --> 00:56:53,057
Mehevi!

390
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,997
l heard this noise. l came here
to find out what it was.

391
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:06,038
The people are celebrating, Excellency.

392
00:57:06,106 --> 00:57:09,337
- What are they celebrating?
- Their happiness, Excellency.

393
00:57:10,643 --> 00:57:14,044
- What has given them happiness?
- Terangi.

394
00:57:14,114 --> 00:57:19,552
- What about him?
- He has escaped, Excellency.

395
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:22,645
When did you hear this?
Who brought the news?

396
00:57:22,722 --> 00:57:24,690
l have had no official report.

397
00:57:24,757 --> 00:57:28,716
600 miles from Tahiti.
The drums have brought the news.

398
00:57:28,795 --> 00:57:31,730
The birds have brought it.
Do you hear that wind?

399
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:35,666
lt came on the wind.
What have you got to say to all this?

400
00:57:35,735 --> 00:57:40,138
ls there any law against dancing
and singing when the heart's happy?

401
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,698
As your governor, l demand
what information you have.

402
00:57:43,776 --> 00:57:46,176
ls he on this island?
Have you seen him?

403
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:49,340
You don't have to see him.
He's a legend.

404
00:57:49,415 --> 00:57:52,179
You can celebrate him
like Bastille Day.

405
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:56,450
He's the soul and symbol
of all these good people.

406
00:57:56,523 --> 00:57:58,718
No cage can hold 'em.

407
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:02,454
They're the last of the world's
afflicted race of humans...

408
00:58:02,529 --> 00:58:04,463
who believe in freedom.

409
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:05,964
Look at 'em dance!

410
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:21,679
There's the island's answer
to your law.

411
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:58,595
How long have you known of his escape?

412
01:00:58,671 --> 01:01:02,402
- The last voyage.
- Why wasn't l informed?

413
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:04,409
lt was an official matter.

414
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:09,073
l saw no reason to interfere with the
excellent official communication system.

415
01:01:09,148 --> 01:01:10,581
Murder!

416
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:15,149
Did you know there was a man
murdered by him?

417
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:18,622
He broke the bars that held him
in a cage he didn't belong.

418
01:01:18,691 --> 01:01:19,953
But murder!

419
01:01:20,026 --> 01:01:24,360
l imagine this puts an end
to the legend of Terangi.

420
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,398
There'll be no more escapes.

421
01:01:26,466 --> 01:01:30,027
He'll be caught
and sent where he belongs.

422
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,436
Sent to the fortress of Cayenne
and stowed away in a dungeon...

423
01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:35,701
until he's dead and forgotten.

424
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,676
Dead and forgotten
like any law breaker.

425
01:01:38,745 --> 01:01:42,340
Murder and anarchy
will leave no legend behind.

426
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:49,106
Father!

427
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:54,946
- What do you see, lad?
- There.

428
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,447
What is it? A log?

429
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:04,513
No. There's a man hanging on it.

430
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:36,745
Feel better?

431
01:04:36,822 --> 01:04:38,255
Yes, Father.

432
01:04:39,225 --> 01:04:42,661
And you came from Tahiti
in that canoe?

433
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:44,389
Yes.

434
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:46,954
At least 600 miles.

435
01:04:49,235 --> 01:04:51,169
Why did you come?

436
01:04:51,237 --> 01:04:53,228
l want to go home.

437
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,831
They say you killed a man.

438
01:05:00,513 --> 01:05:02,777
l don't know.

439
01:05:02,848 --> 01:05:05,009
l hit him hard.

440
01:05:06,552 --> 01:05:10,682
- Did you mean to kill?
- No! Only to go home.

441
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:15,025
You're only a few miles away now.

442
01:05:15,094 --> 01:05:20,225
Before you tell, Father,
let me go home for one day.

443
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:22,233
l have a daughter.

444
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:25,803
l've never seen her.

445
01:05:26,606 --> 01:05:28,039
And Marama.

446
01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:32,702
Tell me, Father,
has she waited for me?

447
01:05:32,778 --> 01:05:36,544
Yes, she's waited.

448
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:45,356
lt's good to be alive...

449
01:05:46,392 --> 01:05:49,452
after being drowned.

450
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:53,656
How can l be your judge?

451
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:57,726
You've sinned, but others
have sinned more against you.

452
01:05:59,138 --> 01:06:01,606
You weren't meant for evil.

453
01:06:01,674 --> 01:06:04,108
You were made to do evil.

454
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:07,036
How can l judge?

455
01:06:07,113 --> 01:06:10,105
You won't tell, Father?

456
01:06:10,182 --> 01:06:11,615
No.

457
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:17,087
We found you in the sea,
we shall leave you on land...

458
01:06:17,156 --> 01:06:19,590
near to those who love you.

459
01:06:21,327 --> 01:06:25,696
No, you owe me no thanks, my son.

460
01:06:25,765 --> 01:06:28,859
This is between me...

461
01:06:28,934 --> 01:06:30,902
and somebody else.

462
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:13,938
Father, can l tell Marama that Terangi's
waiting for her on Motu Tonga?

463
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:16,174
No need to. She's there.

464
01:07:16,248 --> 01:07:18,546
Went there yesterday, fishing.

465
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:22,553
To Motu Tonga? He doesn't know it.
Why didn't you tell him?

466
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,885
What? And spoil their surprise
tomorrow morning?

467
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,755
You young rascal, l'm ashamed of you.

468
01:07:39,438 --> 01:07:42,532
Mama, l saw a man.

469
01:07:42,608 --> 01:07:44,235
A strange man.

470
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,778
A strange man?

471
01:07:46,846 --> 01:07:51,306
Why, Tita,
there are no strange men.

472
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:40,127
Marama, l've come back.

473
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:43,360
l've been waiting.

474
01:08:43,435 --> 01:08:47,997
Eight years. Long time.

475
01:08:48,073 --> 01:08:50,132
You are the same.

476
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,938
You?

477
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:53,444
The same.

478
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:00,818
Who is that?

479
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,454
She is Tita.

480
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,827
Mine?

481
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,658
Yes.

482
01:09:21,841 --> 01:09:24,810
This is what l dreamed of
all the time.

483
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:32,146
l dreamed l'd see you again,
and my child.

484
01:09:32,218 --> 01:09:34,880
They'll find you and take you away.

485
01:09:36,055 --> 01:09:39,024
They can't take this hour away,
or this day.

486
01:09:40,559 --> 01:09:43,528
They can only take away tomorrow.

487
01:10:38,617 --> 01:10:39,879
l heard.

488
01:10:39,952 --> 01:10:43,615
l have waited as long as l dared.
You must go now.

489
01:10:43,689 --> 01:10:46,886
- They know?
- The island knows, but not de Laage.

490
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:50,019
Not yet. He will find out.
He will hunt you down.

491
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:51,722
De Laage?

492
01:10:51,797 --> 01:10:55,494
Why will he hunt me?
What have l done against him?

493
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:58,559
His heart is black against you.
You must go tonight.

494
01:10:58,637 --> 01:11:01,367
- Where, Father?
- Fenua lno.

495
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,671
Fenua lno.
The forbidden place.

496
01:11:04,743 --> 01:11:07,268
lt is taboo. No one goes there.

497
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:10,213
No one will look there.
You will be safe there until you die.

498
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:14,150
Stay hidden till the darkness.
We will load my big canoe.

499
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:16,414
You will start
when the island is asleep.

500
01:11:56,495 --> 01:11:59,225
Gee, quite a wind coming up.

501
01:11:59,298 --> 01:12:01,789
This is the worst l've seen or heard
for a long time.

502
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:03,801
Like devils running around.

503
01:12:05,371 --> 01:12:08,932
Can you imagine Paris
in a wind like this?

504
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:13,570
All the silk hats blowing off,
all the bouquets blowing away.

505
01:12:13,645 --> 01:12:16,705
All the ashcans bouncing
down the avenue.

506
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,813
l'm afraid civilization wouldn't look
very pretty in a high wind.

507
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:26,385
l've missed you
from our dinner table, Doctor.

508
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:29,518
Eugene's been pining for a game of chess
for a long time.

509
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:32,564
So have l.
You know...

510
01:12:32,631 --> 01:12:35,759
Eugene and l
have been having a feud.

511
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:37,802
- Cognac, Doctor?
- No, thanks.

512
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:40,896
Sort of a battle of souls.

513
01:12:40,973 --> 01:12:43,999
Let's check our souls for tonight,
de Laage.

514
01:12:44,076 --> 01:12:47,011
Let's be Frenchmen,
both of us.

515
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:49,809
You're not angry at the doctor,
are you?

516
01:12:49,882 --> 01:12:51,873
No, l'm not angry at anyone.

517
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,350
lt's they who are angry with me,
all of them.

518
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:57,218
Black looks and mutterings.

519
01:12:57,289 --> 01:13:00,747
Father Paul!
Why isn't he here tonight?

520
01:13:00,826 --> 01:13:03,556
Praying for my soul, l suppose.

521
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,462
They love their precious murderer.

522
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:09,626
Let's forget Terangi,
just for tonight.

523
01:13:09,701 --> 01:13:13,728
Forget him? He haunts this island
like a school of ghosts.

524
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,303
l can no longer sense what's going on.
l took a walk through the village today.

525
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:21,813
- There's something strange in the air.
- Strange?

526
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,214
Well, the wind gives the island
a different smell.

527
01:13:26,285 --> 01:13:30,085
No, not the wind.
The natives behaved queerly.

528
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:32,783
Some of them smiled at me.
Kept watching me and smiling.

529
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:37,227
l had a feeling something queer
was going on behind my back.

530
01:13:37,296 --> 01:13:41,096
Something strange. Hidden.

531
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,498
lmportant.

532
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:47,061
The only thing important that's
happening in the village today...

533
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:49,334
is that Mama Rua is dying.

534
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:51,771
Terangi's mother.

535
01:13:52,911 --> 01:13:55,243
Afraid she's gonna die.

536
01:13:55,314 --> 01:13:58,010
And Marama's sister's having a baby.

537
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:01,712
l play a kind of chess game...

538
01:14:01,787 --> 01:14:04,381
with the oldest gambler
in the world: death.

539
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:08,217
He takes Mama Rua...

540
01:14:08,293 --> 01:14:12,093
and l checkmate him with a baby.

541
01:14:16,168 --> 01:14:18,728
l think l'll have
another drop of cognac...

542
01:14:18,804 --> 01:14:22,535
just to keep the wind out of my bones
on the way home.

543
01:14:22,608 --> 01:14:26,203
l've never been on the island
in a storm. Do they get bad?

544
01:14:26,278 --> 01:14:28,769
l've heard tales of them.

545
01:14:28,847 --> 01:14:32,078
Winds that blow the islands
out of the sea.

546
01:14:32,151 --> 01:14:35,279
But l think Manukura
is pretty well anchored.

547
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:41,449
At least part of it.

548
01:14:47,966 --> 01:14:49,900
The devil's abroad tonight!

549
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:52,561
We're all on edge tonight.

550
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,434
What are you doing, boy?

551
01:16:39,244 --> 01:16:41,041
Answer me.

552
01:16:42,314 --> 01:16:44,509
What are you up to?

553
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:48,545
What are you doing
with the chief's canoe?

554
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,918
Stealing?

555
01:16:50,989 --> 01:16:54,390
Stubborn, eh?
Very well.

556
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:56,791
Come along to Father Paul's house
with me.

557
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,842
Be careful with the sail.

558
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:29,119
- Excuse me coming at this hour, Father.
- You are welcome.

559
01:17:29,194 --> 01:17:32,220
- l want your help.
- lt's yours, de Laage.

560
01:17:32,297 --> 01:17:36,358
- You know this boy?
- Yes. Mako. He's a good boy.

561
01:17:36,435 --> 01:17:39,233
- He won't lie to you, Father Paul.
- Oh, no.

562
01:17:40,105 --> 01:17:42,437
Ask him where he was going
with that canoe.

563
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,467
Whose canoe?

564
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:47,978
A boat loaded with food.

565
01:17:48,046 --> 01:17:50,844
Food being smuggled to Terangi.

566
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:54,283
He's on this island.
He's being hidden.

567
01:17:54,353 --> 01:17:57,186
He's waiting for the boy in that canoe.

568
01:17:57,255 --> 01:18:00,656
Father, l didn't tell!
l didn't tell!

569
01:18:00,726 --> 01:18:03,388
Hear that? He confesses.

570
01:18:03,462 --> 01:18:07,125
Captain Nagle smuggled him in.
l'd been waiting for that.

571
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,230
And you refused to come
to my home tonight. Why?

572
01:18:12,304 --> 01:18:17,503
Because you know. You were afraid
to face me. You're guilty.

573
01:18:17,576 --> 01:18:20,909
They're all guilty.
The whole island.

574
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:24,972
l'll break Nagle for this.

575
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:30,147
Neither this boy nor Captain Nagle
had anything to do with it.

576
01:18:30,222 --> 01:18:34,386
Terangi was picked up at sea
ten miles from here.

577
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:36,188
By whom?

578
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:40,994
You! When?

579
01:18:41,066 --> 01:18:42,499
Last night.

580
01:18:43,402 --> 01:18:46,963
You helped Terangi.

581
01:18:47,038 --> 01:18:49,268
You, my own priest!

582
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:52,401
- l'm his priest, too.
- You helped a murderer.

583
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:55,674
l aided a man
whose heart is innocent.

584
01:18:55,747 --> 01:18:58,181
You betrayed your own government.

585
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,548
You've given aid to anarchy
and bloodshed.

586
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:03,918
- l'll answer for it.
- You'll answer me, Priest.

587
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:07,015
- Where is he?
- l don't know.

588
01:19:07,092 --> 01:19:10,425
He knows! You're in the presence
of your own priest, boy!

589
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:14,022
You dare not lie.
Where is Terangi?

590
01:19:14,099 --> 01:19:18,001
Would you ask this child
to betray someone he loves?

591
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:22,062
l'm asking him to tell the law
what he knows.

592
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:25,405
The government demands information
against the murderer.

593
01:19:26,478 --> 01:19:31,040
There are stronger things
than governments in this world.

594
01:19:31,116 --> 01:19:32,674
Something deeper.

595
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:34,184
More real.

596
01:19:35,654 --> 01:19:38,088
This child has that in his heart.

597
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:43,054
Though you tortured him,
he wouldn't speak.

598
01:19:44,463 --> 01:19:46,431
He shall pay for his silence.

599
01:19:46,498 --> 01:19:49,092
And l shall bless him for it.

600
01:20:11,823 --> 01:20:15,020
- l've never seen the barometer so low.
- Did you send my note to Captain Nagle?

601
01:20:15,093 --> 01:20:17,323
Yes, he's waiting inside.

602
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:21,222
l'll come to the point at once.
l am commandeering your schooner.

603
01:20:21,299 --> 01:20:24,268
- This wind is too strong to be out in.
- How soon can you be ready to sail?

604
01:20:24,336 --> 01:20:26,702
- The weather's bad.
- How soon can you be ready to sail?

605
01:20:26,771 --> 01:20:29,604
- Nagle's thinking of your safety.
- He's trying to frighten you.

606
01:20:29,674 --> 01:20:32,700
l'm not trying to frighten anybody.
We can't find Terangi in this storm.

607
01:20:32,777 --> 01:20:35,541
- lt'll get worse.
- lt'll blow itself out in 24 hours.

608
01:20:35,614 --> 01:20:37,639
lf l delay, it may be too late.
He'll get away.

609
01:20:37,716 --> 01:20:40,617
We're in the track of a rising wind.
The barometer's falling!

610
01:20:40,685 --> 01:20:43,347
- You must listen.
- l'll listen to one voice, my own.

611
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:47,050
De Laage, l told you
you'll end by destroying yourself.

612
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:49,958
l'm ordering your schooner
in the name of the government.

613
01:20:50,028 --> 01:20:53,293
Take him along.
Go out in this wind, de Laage.

614
01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:56,095
Maybe you'll find something
more important than Terangi.

615
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:59,034
When you feel the might of the sea
and wind, maybe you'll discover...

616
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:02,972
there's something greater in this world
than the French criminal code.

617
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:04,508
Terangi's out there.

618
01:21:04,576 --> 01:21:07,636
He's paddling through this storm
in a canoe.

619
01:21:07,712 --> 01:21:12,445
Go chase him. Then hear God howl
and laugh at you.

620
01:21:15,086 --> 01:21:17,919
- Get your ship ready.
- l'll be ready when you are.

621
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:20,150
Oh, Eugene.

622
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,291
Look! What is it?

623
01:21:58,129 --> 01:22:01,690
The birds. They're flying away,
like your dream.

624
01:22:05,136 --> 01:22:08,537
- Terangi, where are you going?
- Back to Manukura.

625
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:20,417
Look!

626
01:22:36,668 --> 01:22:41,435
The great storm is coming,
the wind that overturns the land.

627
01:22:41,506 --> 01:22:44,600
Go to Tavi's store.
Get ropes. Anchor your houses.

628
01:22:44,676 --> 01:22:47,474
Take to the trees
if the sea should cover the land.

629
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:49,570
- Go quickly!
- Go!

630
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,232
- What's that?
- Either the wind or end of the world.

631
01:23:41,299 --> 01:23:43,494
And me with a baby to deliver.

632
01:24:00,952 --> 01:24:04,888
- Take her to the church.
- No. Surf boat! Surf boat better.

633
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:06,981
Surf boats?
Are you crazy?

634
01:24:08,226 --> 01:24:10,956
Sea will cover land.
Surf boat better!

635
01:24:11,029 --> 01:24:13,725
All right, take her to the surf boats.

636
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:17,894
Surf boats!
And l commit suicide.

637
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:30,603
- You'll need me to help you.
- Everyone go to the church.

638
01:24:30,682 --> 01:24:33,173
No! Sea rising.
Carry church away.

639
01:24:33,251 --> 01:24:36,243
No, the church is on high ground.
Come with me.

640
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:39,017
No, come to the boat!

641
01:26:10,515 --> 01:26:12,073
Come on.

642
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,860
The reef!

643
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:29,264
lt's breaking.

644
01:26:29,334 --> 01:26:30,858
Come on!

645
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:44,881
Come on!

646
01:27:54,986 --> 01:27:57,784
Father, will the sea rise
and cover the island?

647
01:27:58,756 --> 01:28:01,782
We're on the highest spot here,
my daughter.

648
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:06,228
Even if the sea reaches us,
the walls will keep it out.

649
01:29:13,898 --> 01:29:16,924
The church! lt's going!

650
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:37,675
Father Paul, come. The sea is breaking
in. The walls are going. Look!

651
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:45,714
Take those who want to go.
l am staying here.

652
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:47,781
You will drown.

653
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:50,692
You saved me. Take my arm
and let me save you.

654
01:30:50,761 --> 01:30:53,753
- No, my son. Take madame.
- No, l'll stay here with you.

655
01:30:53,831 --> 01:30:57,631
Take her back safe to the world
that has wronged you.

656
01:30:59,837 --> 01:31:02,897
Please, madame, go.
Terangi, take her.

657
01:31:02,974 --> 01:31:04,407
Yes, Father.

658
01:31:05,943 --> 01:31:10,073
Those of you who wish to go, go now.

659
01:31:10,148 --> 01:31:15,085
Those who wish to sing with me
for the last time, stay.

660
01:36:03,441 --> 01:36:05,966
Where is the child?

661
01:36:11,549 --> 01:36:12,982
There.

662
01:36:18,923 --> 01:36:23,053
ls it boy or girl?

663
01:36:27,264 --> 01:36:32,031
You don't know! You haven't got it!
lt's dead!

664
01:36:32,102 --> 01:36:35,503
No, my daughter. lt's here, alive.

665
01:36:42,279 --> 01:36:44,213
lt's a boy!

666
01:37:14,044 --> 01:37:16,171
How many survivors, Doctor?

667
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:29,559
ls that all?

668
01:37:31,862 --> 01:37:33,352
Germaine, my wife?

669
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:39,369
l wish it could've been me
instead of her.

670
01:37:43,807 --> 01:37:46,935
l gave you up as well.
How did you pull through?

671
01:37:50,414 --> 01:37:52,712
We were at the edge of the hurricane.

672
01:37:57,254 --> 01:37:59,222
You were at the center.

673
01:38:10,334 --> 01:38:12,461
What is it, Terangi?

674
01:38:12,536 --> 01:38:14,436
A canoe.

675
01:38:14,505 --> 01:38:16,439
A war canoe.

676
01:38:36,093 --> 01:38:41,827
Then Father Paul took your wife to
the church. lt seemed the safest place.

677
01:38:41,899 --> 01:38:45,164
l'd have gone too,
except l couldn't desert my patient.

678
01:38:45,235 --> 01:38:47,726
That's the last you saw of her?

679
01:38:47,805 --> 01:38:51,901
lt grew so dark, you couldn't see
the church from the reef boat.

680
01:38:51,976 --> 01:38:55,935
But when that bell stopped ringing,
l knew what happened.

681
01:38:57,214 --> 01:39:00,615
As soon as you can get your
engine running, we'll make a search...

682
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:02,345
for survivors.

683
01:39:04,321 --> 01:39:07,586
l must make a report, list all dead.
l shall want all details.

684
01:39:07,658 --> 01:39:09,751
Come with me to the ship.

685
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:22,530
The ship will find us.
l know that.

686
01:39:23,807 --> 01:39:26,970
The ship will come,
and then they'll take Terangi.

687
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:29,604
Oh, no, Marama, no.

688
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,773
But l know they will.

689
01:39:31,849 --> 01:39:33,874
Terangi knows it.

690
01:39:33,951 --> 01:39:36,215
But l'll make them take Tita
and me, too.

691
01:39:36,286 --> 01:39:39,016
Be quiet, Marama.

692
01:39:39,089 --> 01:39:41,614
lt doesn't matter now.

693
01:39:41,692 --> 01:39:43,626
We're lucky to be alive.

694
01:39:49,166 --> 01:39:51,225
Katopua.

695
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:15,358
- Good-bye, Marama.
- Good-bye, madame.

696
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:17,360
Good-bye, little Tita.

697
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:26,995
God bless you, Terangi.

698
01:40:38,882 --> 01:40:40,315
Captain!

699
01:40:48,592 --> 01:40:50,025
Easy left!

700
01:40:57,601 --> 01:40:59,626
Germaine.

701
01:40:59,703 --> 01:41:02,900
My dear. My dear.

702
01:41:04,174 --> 01:41:08,440
l thought l lost you,
but l never gave up hope.

703
01:41:11,782 --> 01:41:15,081
Germaine, forgive me.

704
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:18,121
Forgive you?
For what?

705
01:41:18,188 --> 01:41:20,850
For everything l failed to be
since we were married.

706
01:41:22,292 --> 01:41:26,023
l faced it all today.
l've nearly gone mad.

707
01:41:35,906 --> 01:41:38,966
Take me back to the boat now.

708
01:41:39,042 --> 01:41:41,408
l'm so dreadfully tired.

709
01:41:41,478 --> 01:41:43,503
l know, dear.

710
01:41:48,285 --> 01:41:52,381
- Where are the others?
- There are no others. Not a soul.

711
01:41:52,456 --> 01:41:55,289
l was tied to a tree and drifted here
alone. All the others were lost.

712
01:41:56,059 --> 01:41:58,391
Let's go back to the boat.

713
01:42:01,665 --> 01:42:04,964
Eugene, take me back to the boat!

714
01:42:06,603 --> 01:42:08,594
There's something out there.

715
01:42:08,672 --> 01:42:11,038
lt's only a floating log.

716
01:42:31,628 --> 01:42:33,619
You're right, Germaine.

717
01:42:35,499 --> 01:42:37,558
lt's only a floating log.

718
