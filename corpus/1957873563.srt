00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,625
In centuries past,

2
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,875
when the world was full of mystery,

3
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:17,541
and traveling was reserved
for the very few,

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,833
a new form of collection was born.

5
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,666
The cabinet of curiosities.

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,208
Now, this collection
could be lodged in a building,

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:26,875
a chamber,

8
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,083
or a piece of furniture.

9
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,625
In these private collections,
one would find books,

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:40,166
paintings, or specimens
of natural and unnatural history.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,416
A dragon's tooth,
a Fiji mermaid, a unicorn's horn.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,333
And behind each of these,

13
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,416
a story.

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,125
One could encounter something
as large as a suit of armor

15
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,166
or as small as a set of keys.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,416
The keys to a storage room.

17
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,750
That old place where
one keeps the past... alive.

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,041
The things that remind us
of our deeds, our darkness, our sins.

19
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,541
The story today is Lot 36.

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,291
And the director,

21
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,125
Guillermo Navarro.

22
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,875
<i>Just two hours ago,</i>

23
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:27,625
<i>allied air forces began an attack
on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait.</i>

24
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,333
<i>These attacks continue as I speak.</i>

25
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,041
<i>We have before us</i>

26
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:38,458
<i>the opportunity to forge
for ourselves, and for future generations,</i>

27
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,708
<i>a new world order.</i>

28
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,583
<i>A world where the rule of law,
not the law of the jungle,</i>

29
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,791
<i>governs the conduct of nations.</i>

30
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,791
<i>When we are successful, and we will be,</i>

31
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,958
<i>we have a real chance
at this new world order.</i>

32
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,583
<i>An order in which
a credible United Nations</i>

33
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,791
<i>can use its peacekeeping role</i>

34
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,583
<i>to fulfill the promise and vision
of the UN standards.</i>

35
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,666
<i>We have no argument
with the people of Iraq.</i>

36
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,625
<i>Indeed, for the innocents</i>

37
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,625
<i>caught in this conflict,</i>

38
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,375
<i>I pray for their safety.</i>

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,333
<i>Our goal
is not the conquest of Iraq.</i>

40
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,125
<i>It is the liberation of Kuwait.</i>

41
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>It is my hope that somehow
the Iraqi people can, even now,</i>

42
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:33,250
<i>convince their dictator
that he must lay down his arms,</i>

43
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,500
<i>leave Kuwait, and let Iraq itself...</i>

44
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,833
<i>...rejoin the family
of peace-loving nations.</i>

45
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,291
<i>Thomas Paine wrote...</i>

46
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:50,166
<i>..."These are the times
that try men's souls."</i>

47
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,750
<i>Those well-known words
are so very true today.</i>

48
00:03:55,875 --> 00:04:00,958
<i>But even as planes
of the multinational forces attack Iraq,</i>

49
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,583
<i>I prefer to think of peace, not war.</i>

50
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>I am convinced
not only that we will prevail,</i>

51
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:16,083
<i>but that out of the horror of combat
will come the recognition</i>

52
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:20,500
<i>that no nation can stand
against a world united.</i>

53
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,458
<i>...our land.
We fought for it and won.</i>

54
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:30,250
<i>These immigrants take and take,
and give nothing back.</i>

55
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,083
<i>Who told them they were welcome here?
Who invited them in?</i>

56
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,583
<i>We made this country,
fought for its freedoms,</i>

57
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,458
<i>and they want to fit right in.</i>

58
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,500
- Fuck yeah.
<i>- Reap the benefits.</i>

59
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,000
<i>Loot the social programs.</i>

60
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,333
<i>Brown rights, Black rights,
well, what about white rights?</i>

61
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,625
<i>Oh no. No, we can't talk about that.</i>

62
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,625
No, we can't.

63
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,208
<i>We're gonna take calls soon.</i>

64
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,125
<i>No self-righteous,
liberal assholes, please.</i>

65
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,625
<i>We've got Fred from Williamsville
on the line. What's on your mind today?</i>

66
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,458
<i>♪ Then I went through the jewelry ♪</i>

67
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,541
<i>♪ And I found our wedding rings ♪</i>

68
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,291
<i>♪ I put mine on my finger ♪</i>

69
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,541
<i>♪ And I gave yours a fling ♪</i>

70
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,375
<i>♪ Across this lonely... ♪</i>

71
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,875
Nice wheels.

72
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,291
My pride and joy.

73
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,916
<i>Good afternoon, everyone.</i>

74
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,166
Don't be shy. Come to Daddy.

75
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,458
Join your brothers and sisters.

76
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,375
I'm Eddie, and you're in the Gold Coast.

77
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,000
For new faces, that's long-term rentals.

78
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,666
Folks who don't trust banks,
who stash gold bricks

79
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,041
inside of old couch cushions,
fur coats in boxes.

80
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,916
For some reason, they leave it all behind,
you know, the three Ds.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Death,

82
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,166
divorce, debt.

83
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,125
Bad luck for them, good luck for you.

84
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,250
But sometimes we roll up the door
praying for a big score

85
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,583
only to find a pile of shit
on the other side.

86
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,416
We're short and sweet today,
starting with lot 36.

87
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,125
This is the one
owned for decades by the same man.

88
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:26,041
May he rest in peace up there,
down there or wherever he may be.

89
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,625
I'm just covering all the bases.

90
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,958
Without further ado...

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,250
Yeah.

92
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,458
A peek, a whiff.

93
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,666
It's all you get.

94
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:12,041
Let the bidding begin!

95
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,291
All yours, Bill.

96
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,916
And we are on the block.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,250
On the block, starting with 50.
50 going, 50 goes.

98
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,625
- We got 50 dollars.
- 100.

99
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,583
- 100 going, do I hear 150?
- 150.

100
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,708
- Oooh, one five zero, we got her once!
- 175.

101
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,583
- 250.
- 250 going once...

102
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,500
350.

103
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,541
Routing out the competition.

104
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:36,125
I got four bills, four bills I got.
400 going once, twice, three times.

105
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,458
Sold, to the shy man
with the deep pockets.

106
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,416
All right, everybody, start filing out.
Next one's down the hall.

107
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,125
I heard you, Tommy.

108
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,291
<i>Did you, fuck-nut?</i>

109
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,000
<i>I remember telling you not to cross
county lines before settling in full.</i>

110
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,541
- I haven't.
<i>- Oh.</i>

111
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,291
<i>So, my guy eyes on you was lying?</i>

112
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:05,291
- I'm here to make money, to pay you.
<i>- I want my money now, lying piece of shit.</i>

113
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,583
Pay phone's outside.

114
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,083
<i>- You've gotta give me some room.
- Sure.</i>

115
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,517
- I'm handling it.
<i>- Better have it tonight, motherf...</i>

116
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,875
You got that contract?

117
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,416
Your cut from the last unit.

118
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,750
Did it bear fruit?

119
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,166
Stones were made of glass,
melting the gold yielded some.

120
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,583
- Looks light. What about the wooden canes?
- Replicas. Shitty wooden resin.

121
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,250
That's minus the legwork and gas money.

122
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,791
Guess that's why you got the truck
and I ride a busted moped.

123
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:47,208
- I'll cut you a check for the unit.
- Get the fuck out of here. A check.

124
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,916
You better get me my money.

125
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,375
A check.

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,250
- That's slick.
- Got any idea how much I make an hour?

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,041
Got my keys?

128
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,416
Before we get to that,
I wanna show you something.

129
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,166
Here it is.

130
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,666
Check this out. You gotta see.

131
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,083
This is the guy
that owns the one you bought.

132
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,166
Every day,

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
same guy.

134
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,875
Carrying the same bag.

135
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,166
Stayed in there for an hour,
hour-and-a-half.

136
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,708
- And then...
- What's this got to do with me?

137
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,875
Ain't you curious?

138
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,875
No, I'm not, and I've never been.
Maybe that's why I'm still alive.

139
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,541
You gotta be shitting me.

140
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,375
Guy's had it
since this place opened.

141
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,250
Going back to '45.

142
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,583
Kept mostly to himself, polite,

143
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,958
tighter than a Tupperware lid.

144
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,416
White anger.

145
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,125
White anger...
Am I allowed to say Black anger?

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,083
I didn't think so.

147
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,833
Anyway, something special in there,
for him to check on it like this?

148
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,041
Yeah, old clothes and worn-out shoes.

149
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,250
I bought a unit in Palmetto
packed with jars.

150
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,125
Urine, feces, hair, and toenails.

151
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:20,041
And bags and bags of coupons.
The older we get, the stranger, man.

152
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,125
Now look.

153
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,250
Bag's empty when he comes out.

154
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,333
- Of course, it's a fucking storage unit.
- Yeah, but what was he up to?

155
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,458
He dropped something in there.
Every day for decades.

156
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,791
Here's with the hopping again.

157
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,791
What do you think it is?

158
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,041
I'll dig around.

159
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,791
For your lot 36.

160
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,333
Enjoy.

161
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,208
Remember, I'm the one tipped you off.

162
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,083
Don't forget to spread the love.

163
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,416
Stingy bastard.

164
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,250
<i>The skies over Baghdad
are illuminated tonight</i>

165
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,291
<i>as allied forces
unleash an assault. Another...</i>

166
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,416
Hello, Mr. Eddie. I came to pay my bill.

167
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,875
Two months.

168
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,583
Uh, I thought you left the unit.

169
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,458
Gave it up. We sold it
on the block when we didn't hear from you.

170
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,500
Oh, no, no, no.

171
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,791
Mr. Eddie,

172
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,500
how long I am renting here?

173
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,083
We sent you
an eviction notice, Ms. Amelia.

174
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,541
- Your phone was disconnected.
- I telled you, I moved.

175
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,750
I have a new number.

176
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,958
Maybe you sent the notice
to the older address.

177
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,291
- The wrong one.
- Well, whose fault is that?

178
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,375
You!

179
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:15,458
I called. I said,
"Please, Mr. Eddie, don't forget."

180
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,166
That was...

181
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,125
You see that guy right there?

182
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,875
His name is Nick Appleton.

183
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,583
He bought your unit.

184
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,500
Go see him.

185
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,333
Maybe you can get
some of your things back.

186
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,083
Hmm.

187
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,708
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

188
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,958
Thank you very much.

189
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,000
Eyes on me.

191
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,208
Mr. Appleton?

192
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,166
- Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton.
- Whoa!

193
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,458
Sorry. My name is Amelia,
Mr. Eddie said you bought my unit.

194
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,583
- It's on the other side. Number 87.
- What if I did?

195
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,875
They made mistake.

196
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,958
- Who's they? You were evicted, right?
- They send wrong address.

197
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,625
- Talk to the manager.
- No. Mr. Eddie said I speak to you.

198
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,583
Fucker.

199
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,958
Is that right?

200
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,250
- Speak fast, this ear.
- All my family things are there.

201
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,083
Uh, letters, photos,
personal stuff, you know?

202
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,125
Well, I threw a lot of stuff away
and sold some others.

203
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:37,125
There may be some stuff left in there,
but whatever is in there is mine now.

204
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,791
No, it's not yours.

205
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,250
- Where are you from?
- My name is Amelia, and I am from here.

206
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,625
I took two buses.

207
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:51,208
Legally, you lost whatever is in there.
I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.

208
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:55,125
All my children's pictures.
My mama, my papa's letters.

209
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,500
What good are they to you, Mr. Appleton?

210
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,416
You let me look around
and I bother nobody.

211
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,166
Maybe some things are still there,
and I'll go quick.

212
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,708
I'm sorry for your troubles,
but they're not mine.

213
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,375
You can do nothing for me?

214
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,041
A thousand bucks.
You can have what's left there.

215
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,875
I make this money in a month, cleaning.

216
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,166
Here.

217
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,000
This is yours, I bet you can still use it.

218
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,208
What's that?

219
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,083
Do you speak Spanish?

220
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,166
No. And clearly you don't speak English.

221
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,375
Make an effort when you're in my country
and try and insult me in my own language.

222
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,458
Dumb bitch.

223
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,833
I said I hope you rot in hell!

224
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,000
As usual, it's all on me.

225
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,708
All on me.

226
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,125
Like I don't have enough problems.

227
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,625
I don't need this shit.

228
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,375
It's always something with this shit.

229
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,875
If it ain't the rain, it's the pipe.
I gotta get a new job.

230
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,833
Hey, Eddie.

231
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,000
The unit I got is a lot smaller than this.

232
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:05,125
What you talking about? Ain't planning
on getting a discount on account of size?

233
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,875
What made you so cheap, man?

234
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,125
Smaller space, fewer items.
All's I'm saying.

235
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,666
Nothing's up to code in this section.

236
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,416
It was built in the 1940s.
Units were wider, deeper, steeper.

237
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,791
Connected to each other.

238
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,750
I don't know what the fuck is...

239
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,875
Excuse me. I gotta get a mop.

240
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,541
That lady Amelia's sitting outside.

241
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,333
Yeah, thanks for ambushing me
with that, by the way.

242
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,083
Let the lady see if any
of her stuff's left, for Christ's sake.

243
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,416
I'm not buying into
being the bad guy here,

244
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,833
especially not from you.

245
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,000
Don't be a hypocrite like everyone else.

246
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,375
Hey, look. You and me got our thing going?

247
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,500
Okay. I got my stuff on the side, sure,
but this lady? She's too good.

248
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,791
The game has rules.
You win some, you lose some.

249
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,708
Look at me.
I did what I had to for this country.

250
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,583
How the fuck do you bring that
into every conversation?

251
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,666
Because it bears fucking repeating!
The game I played was rigged.

252
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,500
Lost this ear except
for high-pitched ringing day in, day out.

253
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
Fine. Wife? Gone.

254
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,583
I'll take all the losses.
But now it's my turn.

255
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,500
You're not the only one
that feels fucked, brother.

256
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,291
Rigged? The front line
is all Black and Brown.

257
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,333
Maybe you didn't recall all
the dark-skinned bodies you stepped over

258
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,296
on your way to take a leak
in the Perfume River.

259
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,541
I bought that unit fair and square.

260
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,250
So fuck you,
fuck her, and fuck this guilt trip!

261
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,916
And in my unit, everyone was green.

262
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,791
Pfft.

263
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,791
Fuck me blue!

264
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,750
Twelve K, tomorrow.

265
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,583
You made your fucking point.

266
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,875
Now I made my point.

267
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,833
Fuck.

268
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,333
Dammit.

269
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,333
Shoo!

270
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,083
Shoo!

271
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,041
Fucking hell.

272
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,750
Oh!

273
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,166
The fuck happened to you?

274
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,208
I'm borrowing your first aid kit.

275
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,125
- Maybe you should sit for a minute.
- What?

276
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:50,250
Why? I'm fine.
I gotta get some shit appraised.

277
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,666
- Must be something good.
- Antique pieces, some gold.

278
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,125
Maybe you should skip
the five-and-dime this time.

279
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,166
Go over to Agatha's joint
on Douglas Drive.

280
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:08,541
She's good people.

281
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,625
Don't be hostile with your big,
weird eyes, and your bloody head.

282
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,708
Fuck off.

283
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,125
You need a chill pill, Nick.

284
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,666
It's gold, sure,
but I'll only pay scrap for it.

285
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,291
Eddie said you'd do better for us.

286
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,416
Sure, if you guys do better for me.

287
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:00,708
Look at this.

288
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:05,083
No certified marks on the metal,
craftsmanship's crude.

289
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,000
Can't even dress it up.

290
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,666
Next, please.

291
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,666
The table and chairs are good.
That inlay is real.

292
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,375
Now those are excellent.

293
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,541
It's a séance table.

294
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,208
Like Ouija-board séance?

295
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,833
A bit more serious than that.

296
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,875
What have we here?

297
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:47,333
Have you ever seen a...

298
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:50,541
Yes.

299
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,000
"<i>Liber Primus, Daemonia.</i>"

300
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:59,125
"<i>Liber Secundus,</i>

301
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,375
<i>Symvolia."</i>

302
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,291
<i>"Liber Tertius,</i>

303
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,416
<i>Perilipsi."</i>

304
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:13,833
What does it mean?

305
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:16,500
They're important, right? Valuable, I bet.

306
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,750
Not my province.

307
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,291
Whose then?

308
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,541
I have an associate in mind.

309
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:31,625
And this...

310
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,625
- I've never seen one like it.
- I have.

311
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,541
Many times.

312
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,916
Feel. She's a beauty.

313
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,666
Gently. It gets brittle.

314
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:47,791
Try. Touch.

315
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:53,416
Can you guess the material?

316
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:56,708
Wool.

317
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:58,875
Human hair.

318
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:00,208
Smell.

319
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,958
Yeah. No thanks.

320
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,083
I'll go call my guy about the books.

321
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,833
Roland. It's Agatha.

322
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,166
- Jesus Christ.
- I'm at the store.

323
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,583
I have a client here
with some very interesting items.

324
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,041
Right up your alley, know what I mean?

325
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:37,458
Come quickly.

326
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,250
Trust me.

327
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,333
<i>Hallo</i>, my dear.

328
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,791
How's it going?

329
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:56,791
Mmmwah!

330
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,416
This is Nick.

331
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,166
Ah, hello. Hello.

332
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,333
Take a look. What do you think?

333
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:03,583
Ah...

334
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:08,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very interesting. Yeah.

335
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:09,833
This is

336
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:11,625
indeed

337
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,708
a séance table.

338
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:18,208
- It's exquisite.
- Nineteenth century Austria.

339
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,416
The wood is

340
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,208
white cedar and sandalwood,

341
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,583
treated in a very...

342
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,166
unique way.

343
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:33,041
And arranged to facilitate
the summoning of an entity.

344
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:36,333
You see?

345
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,708
The reddish tint on the lacquer? Huh?

346
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,166
Guess what went into it? Hey?

347
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:44,833
Sick fucks.

348
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,291
My God.

349
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,166
I knew you'd be thrilled.

350
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,875
Oh!

351
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,583
Was there a fourth volume?

352
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,708
Not that I saw.

353
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:07,625
But... it's possible you could have it?

354
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:10,000
Well,
I've barely touched the unit.

355
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,125
There's a life's worth of crap in there.

356
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,791
The books are extremely rare.

357
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,833
I would say 10,000 for all three.

358
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, well.

359
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,208
How much for all four?

360
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:26,125
If placed at the right auction,
with multiple buyers,

361
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,250
in excess of $300,000.

362
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,833
You see, the fourth volume
is the rarest one.

363
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,583
<i>Liber Quartus Sacramentum.</i>

364
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,666
The most desirable piece.

365
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,583
It's legendary.

366
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:48,458
Full of symbols and spells
to bind a demon,

367
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,000
to make it earthbound.

368
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:51,625
<i>Ja?</i>

369
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,208
A demon?

370
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:57,208
The reason the...
the fourth volume is the rarest

371
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:02,875
is because it burns down completely
at the end of the transaction

372
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,666
with the purveyor of its favors.

373
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,416
Except when...

374
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:16,208
- Cut the fuckin' drumroll, will you?
- You've got a tough case here, Rolly.

375
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:21,375
Except when the demon has been betrayed.
Therefore, unable to collect its debt.

376
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,208
This transaction has to happen tonight.

377
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:33,166
This is the payment for the candelabra,
the table, and the chairs.

378
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,083
But the wreath I donate to you,
<i>mein liebshe, </i>Agatha.

379
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:40,166
For the referral, <i>danke schön.</i>

380
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,708
But...

381
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,666
if we find the missing fourth volume,

382
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:50,125
I will write you a check for $300,000.

383
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:58,083
My truck's outside.
I'll drive us over there.

384
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:11,416
<i>- </i>Thank you. Thank you.
- Mm.

385
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,500
Thank you very much.

386
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:18,833
Great.

387
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:22,500
Now we're getting ass fucked
with rain on top of all this shit.

388
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:25,708
Did you, uh, hurt your head
on the windshield?

389
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,833
Yeah. When I was rear-ended.

390
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,875
Uh, do you mind closing,
uh, the side window, please?

391
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,333
I, uh...

392
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,458
I have a confession to make.

393
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,166
Jesus, really?

394
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:49,666
You see, I know all about the family

395
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,500
who owned the unit that you bought.

396
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,625
They were very rich,

397
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:59,166
made their money from steel in Europe,

398
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,458
and emigrated to America
at the end of World War II.

399
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:04,208
They made weapons.

400
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,916
Wolfram for tanks.

401
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,208
But for the wrong side.

402
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:13,166
Yeah, I saw some old war photos
in a photo album in there.

403
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,541
Whoever this guy was.

404
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,875
I hate to disabuse you
on your relative notion

405
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,958
of good and evil,

406
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:22,208
but this man knew and did evil
on a scale almost absolute.

407
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,250
Well, God's got him now.

408
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Ah, yes.

409
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:28,333
God.

410
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,041
Silent, strong type

411
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:33,791
that loves to see us squirm
with free will and other delusions.

412
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:37,166
But what about his adversary? Huh?

413
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,875
Relentless, feisty even.

414
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:44,000
You know, whispering in our ears
at every waking moment. Huh?

415
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,166
Something tells me

416
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,875
you traffic in the wrong,
feisty side yourself there, Hans.

417
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,291
Is this relevant to this transaction?

418
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,875
The owner of the unit was a sick man.

419
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,958
Gambled his fortune away,
destroyed his family,

420
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,375
never had enough of anything.

421
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,666
Bottomless appetites.

422
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,125
You understand?

423
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,458
Yeah, another empty asshole.

424
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,625
That's right.

425
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:24,541
He moved in occult circles
in Berlin and Vienna.

426
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,833
And he invoked an entity.

427
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,041
Offered it a vessel to occupy.

428
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:33,875
To possess.

429
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:36,833
His sister.

430
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,583
Dottie Wolmar,

431
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,250
I believe

432
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:43,791
was her name.

433
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,208
It was...

434
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:47,791
quite the scandal.

435
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,166
Did they ever find her?

436
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,041
No. They searched but...

437
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,083
it was futile.

438
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,541
All right, enough.

439
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:01,916
I'm not interested in any
of this creepshow shit you favor, okay?

440
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,083
Anyway, we're here.

441
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:06,875
Here.

442
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,666
You've gotta be kidding me, put that away.

443
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,583
No, no, no, no.

444
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:15,083
The molten metal was collected
from a very peculiar source.

445
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,541
Bit by bit.

446
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,166
You see, if we find the book,

447
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,833
the light from the candelabra
will yield protection.

448
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,083
No offense, but shut the fuck up.

449
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:25,416
Huh.

450
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,583
You take the left side.

451
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,750
We don't leave until we find it.

452
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,291
Books don't spontaneously combust.

453
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,625
Ah<i>, </i>shit!

454
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,250
You take anything
out of here, I'm gonna know.

455
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,708
And there's only one exit.

456
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,375
Yeah, yeah.

457
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,541
Where are you, Dottie Wolmar?

458
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,541
Ah, fuck!

459
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,666
It's hollow.

460
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,000
You heard that?

461
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:34,333
I knew
these fucking measurements were off.

462
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,166
- Help me with this thing.
- Yes.

463
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,625
You know that book's locked in here.

464
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,291
Now we'll find out
why he came here every day.

465
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,458
Oh!

466
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,708
What is that fucking smell?

467
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:20,833
- In my field, we call it effluvia.
- Oh, man.

468
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:24,333
You know, like when a cat
or a dog mark their territory.

469
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:28,291
Do not touch anything.

470
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:30,833
Do not say anything.

471
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:35,041
- Follow my precise instructions, please.
- You platoon leader now?

472
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,958
If anything not from the natural world

473
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,416
is found on the other side
of this threshold,

474
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,166
I have one piece of advice for you.

475
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:48,875
Do not make eye contact with it,
do not speak with it.

476
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,583
It will sense the dark in you as I do.

477
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:55,250
It will be greedy for it, hungry.
Do you understand?

478
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,916
I'm pretty sure
that's two pieces of advice,

479
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,666
and you don't know shit about me.

480
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,750
So fuck off.

481
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:48,166
It fucking smells horrible.

482
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,666
God dammit.

483
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,708
Unbelievable.

484
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,333
Never in my imagination.

485
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,583
He trapped his poor sister.

486
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,541
Must be weak.

487
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,875
Starving. Poor thing.

488
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:27,125
It was pinned
inside the circle for so long, see?

489
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,625
The hair is fused to the floor.

490
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:33,541
Look. Look how the demon writhes.

491
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,625
See, it took her face as a way in.

492
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:41,541
- There it is.
- Do not cross that line.

493
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:46,041
- Fuck this, I'm going for the book.
- No, stop, don't!

494
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,875
You have no idea
what you've awakened!

495
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,375
Holy mother of God.

496
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:18,875
Dottie.

497
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,458
Oh, fucking hell!

498
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,708
Oh, thank God.
Could you please open the door?

499
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,875
Could you open the door, please?

500
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,958
Can you open the door, please?

501
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,958
Open the door, please!

502
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,541
Thank you.

503
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,708
No! No, please!

504
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,458
I'm in danger here, I need your help!

505
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:57,708
Please! Open the door!

506
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:58,666
No!

507
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,416
Please! I'll give you whatever you want,
anything you want! Please!

508
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,375
Please! Open the door!

509
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,416
Open the door, please!

510
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,291
Open the door!

511
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,875
Please! Please!

512
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:52,916
My career as an artist ended
the moment I saw your work.

513
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,041
Do you feel it, Will?

514
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,666
The fear.

515
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,625
Youse telling me
rats is stealing bodies out of coffins?

516
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,333
I've seen a forest
that takes the dead inside.

517
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,833
We need to get back there.

518
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,833
- This house gives me the creeps.
- I'm very worried about you!

519
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,416
- I don't think you should use that lotion.
- This is what's gonna fix me!

520
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:19,083
Tonight, I'm gonna gift you
a singular experience.

521
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,375
What am I gonna find?

522
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,500
Did that just happen?

523
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,083
Oh God!

524
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:38,583
The darkness has a way
of catching me.
