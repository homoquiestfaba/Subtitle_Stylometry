1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:02,999
- PREVIOUSLY ON <i>THE EXES...</i>

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:03,999
- LOOK,
WE'RE FRIENDS,

3
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:05,999
AND--AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WE'RE AVOIDING EACH OTHER

4
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:06,999
BECAUSE OF, WHAT,
ONE SILLY KISS?

5
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:08,999
- I KNOW.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

6
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:11,999
- FRIENDS?
- FRIENDS.

7
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:15,999
DUDE.
- DUDE.

8
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,999
- LET'S GO,
LET'S GO.

9
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:24,999
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR THE WEDDING.

10
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:25,999
WOW.

11
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:27,999
YOU LOOK GREAT.

12
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:29,999
- I KNOW.

13
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:31,999
I LIKE TO THINK THIS IS
WHAT JAMES BOND WOULD LOOK LIKE

14
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:36,999
IF HE WASN'T ALWAYS
A PASTY WHITE, ENGLISH DUDE.

15
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:37,999
- UH, WHAT IS KEEPING HASKELL?

16
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:38,999
IF HE MAKES US LATE
FOR THIS WEDDING,

17
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,999
I AM GONNA BE
ONE HOT MESS.

18
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:42,999
- DON'T WORRY,
WE'LL GET YOU THERE

19
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:45,999
IN TIME
TO CATCH THE BOUQUET.

20
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:46,999
ANYWAY, RELAX.

21
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,999
THIS IS PAUL'S WEDDING,
NOT YOURS.

22
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:49,999
- HELLO, GENTLEMEN.

23
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:51,999
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING,

24
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,999
BUT I THINK
WE CAN ALL AGREE

25
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:55,999
IT WAS WORTH IT.

26
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:57,999
- HASKELL,
THAT IS ONE BEAUTIFUL TUX.

27
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:59,999
WHAT IS THAT, HUGO BOSS?
ARMANI?

28
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:02,999
- NOPE.
SHING-SHING WOO.

29
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:04,999
THIS LITTLE BABY COMES

30
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:08,999
FROM THE CHINESE PROVINCE
OF GUANGDONG CHENG.

31
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:10,999
IT COST ME $49.95,

32
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:12,999
AND MOST OF THAT
WAS SHIPPING.

33
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:14,999
- WELL, LET'S GO.

34
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:15,999
I DON'T WANT
TO KEEP MY DATE WAITING.

35
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:16,999
SHE'S MEETING ME
AT THE WEDDING.

36
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:17,999
- WHOA.
YOU'RE BRINGING A DATE?

37
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,999
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

38
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:20,999
WEDDINGS ARE MEANT
TO BE SHARED WITH SOMEONE.

39
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:21,999
WHEN I WAS MARRIED,
I ALWAYS HAD LORNA,

40
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:22,999
BUT NOW, I DON'T WANT
TO BE THAT SAD BASTARD

41
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,999
ALONE IN THE CORNER.

42
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:28,999
- A DATE?
AT A WEDDING?

43
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,999
WHAT A WASTE.

44
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:35,999
WEDDINGS ARE STACKED
WITH BITTER, LONELY WOMEN

45
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:38,999
WONDERING,
"WILL IT EVER HAPPEN FOR ME?"

46
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,999
THEY'RE DESPERATE.
THEIR DEFENSES ARE DOWN.

47
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,999
THEIR BAR IS LOW...

48
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:48,999
WHICH IS WHERE I COME IN.

49
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:52,999
THE LAST TRAIN
OUT OF SAD TOWN.

50
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,999
- THERE ARE MY BOYS.

51
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,999
OH, YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.

52
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:57,999
- HOLLY, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH US

53
00:01:58,751 --> 00:01:59,792
GOING TO PAUL'S WEDDING?

54
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:00,999
- OH, OF COURSE.

55
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:01,999
LOOK, IT WAS SWEET OF THEM
TO INVITE ME,

56
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:02,999
BUT LET'S FACE IT--

57
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,999
HAVING THE HOT, SUCCESSFUL,
CHARMING EX-GIRLFRIEND THERE

58
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,999
WOULD BE A DISTRACTION.

59
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:11,999
YEAH, IT WOULD BE SELFISH
OF ME TO GO.

60
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,999
AND, AFTER ALL,
THE WEDDING'S NOT ABOUT ME.

61
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:15,999
- WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

62
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:16,999
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU WEREN'T GOING

63
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:17,999
'CAUSE YOU WERE
FEELING JEALOUS

64
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:18,999
THAT PAUL
WAS GETTING MARRIED.

65
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,999
- HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ME.

66
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,999
- I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU WERE THINKING

67
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:24,999
YOU MADE A MISTAKE
BREAKING UP WITH PAUL.

68
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,999
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

69
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:31,999
- WELL, I THOUGHT--
- STOP THINKING!

70
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:34,999
GUYS, REST ASSURED,
I HAVE NO REGRETS

71
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:36,999
ABOUT BREAKING UP
WITH PAUL, ALL RIGHT?

72
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:38,999
I HAVE A RICH,
REWARDING LIFE--

73
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:41,999
[gasps]
THERE'S THAT COOKIE.

74
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:44,999
I'M SAVING YOU FOR LATER.

75
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,999
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

76
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:50,999


[upbeat music]

77
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:57,999


?

78
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,999


- WOW.
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

79
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:06,999


ORCHIDS, DOM PERIGNON,
CAVIAR--

80
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:10,999


IT'S THE KIND OF WEDDING
EVERY YOUNG GIRL DREAMS ABOUT.

81
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,999


AND THE OCCASIONAL
40-YEAR-OLD MAN.

82
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,999


- DAMN, CHECK HER OUT.

83
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:16,999


WHEN IT'S TIME
TO KISS THE BRIDE,

84
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,999


I'M GETTING IN LINE.

85
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,999


- WELL, IF LUCK IS ON MY SIDE,

86
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,999


SHE'LL HAVE
A SAD, DESPERATE TWIN

87
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,999


WITH A DRINKING PROBLEM.

88
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:28,999


- HEY, THERE HE IS.
THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

89
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,999


- CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY.

90
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,999


- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

91
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,999


- YOU SENT AN INVITATION.

92
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:35,999


- WHAT INVITATION?

93
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,999


- YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO INVITE US?

94
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,999


- WHY WOULD I WANT
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S BEST FRIENDS

95
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:42,999


AT MY WEDDING?

96
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:44,999


- OH, WOW.
SORRY, MAN.

97
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:45,999


- YEAH, WE DIDN'T MEAN
TO INTRUDE

98
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,999


ON YOUR SPECIAL DAY.

99
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,999


- I'M JUST MESSING
WITH YOU GUYS.

100
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,999


- YOU GOT US AGAIN, BUDDY.

101
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,999


- YOU RASCAL.

102
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:57,999


- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

103
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,999


I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU DO THAT.

104
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:01,999


- WELL, I GOTTA RUN.

105
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:02,999


I PROMISED MY NANA
I'D TAKE A PICTURE WITH HER.

106
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:05,999


- AH, YOU MEAN THAT OLD LADY
LYING FACE DOWN ON THE FLOOR?

107
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:06,999


- WHAT?

108
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,999


- I'M JUST MESSING
WITH YOU.

109
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,999


- WHAT AN AWFUL THING
TO SAY,

110
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:18,999


AND ON MY WEDDING DAY.

111
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,999


- I CANNOT TELL YOU
HOW SORRY I AM.

112
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:24,999


- I'M JUST MESSING
WITH YOU.

113
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,999


I THOUGHT
IT WAS HILARIOUS.

114
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,999


[shouts]

115
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,999


- GIRL, YOU ARE LOOKING
SMOKIN'.

116
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,999


- THANKS.
YOU LOOK PRETTY HOT YOURSELF.

117
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:41,999


- WELL, UH, SINCE WE GOT
ALL THIS HEAT,

118
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:42,999


MAYBE LATER,
WE CAN SNEAK OFF

119
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,999


AND PUT EACH OTHER'S FIRES OUT.

120
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,999


- SOUNDS FUN, BUT--

121
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:47,999


- HERE YOU GO, EDEN.

122
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,999


- AH. THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

123
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,999


- UM, BRETT, THIS IS PHIL.
PHIL, BRETT.

124
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:54,999


- WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN?
- HEY.

125
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,999


- OKAY.

126
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,999


UM, SO YOU BROUGHT A DATE.

127
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,999


THAT'S COOL.
IT'S COOL.

128
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:01,999
- DIDN'T YOU BRING A DATE?

129
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,999
- HELL, YEAH.

130
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:08,999
BECAUSE THAT IS
HOW I ROLL.

131
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,999
NOW I JUST GOTTA
FIND ONE.

132
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:12,999
- WOW.
EDEN LOOKS GORGEOUS.

133
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,999
- YEAH.
- WHO'S THAT GUY SHE'S WITH?

134
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,999
- SOME DATE.

135
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:17,999
- GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

136
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,999
- OH, YOU THINK
THAT'S GOOD-LOOKING?

137
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:26,999
STUART, THIS HERE?
THIS IS GOOD-LOOKING.

138
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:27,999
YOU'RE JUST USED TO IT
'CAUSE YOU SEE IT EVERY DAY.

139
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:31,999
YOU'RE SPOILED.

140
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,999
- ALL RIGHT,
I'VE SCANNED THE ROOM.

141
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,999
THIS PLACE IS PACKED WITH
BITTER, DESPERATE, LONELY WOMEN.

142
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:42,999
THE ONLY QUESTION IS, WHO'S
GONNA WIN THE LUTZ LOTTERY?

143
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:44,999
[laughs, winces]

144
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:45,999
- WHAT'S WITH THE SCRATCHING?

145
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:50,999
- MY, UH--MY SHING-SHING WOO
IS A--IS A TAD ITCHY.

146
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:56,999
- HASKELL, THIS THING IS MADE
OF 10% WOOL AND 90% YAK.

147
00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:00,999
[cell phone ringing]

148
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:02,999
HI, HELEN.

149
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,999
UH, WHA--WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT?

150
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,999
HOW SICK?

151
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:09,999
YES, 104 IS ALARMING,

152
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:13,999
BUT YOU MADE A COMMITMENT.

153
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:14,999
NO, IT'S FINE.
I--YES.

154
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,999
I UNDERSTAND.

155
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:18,999
FEEL BETTER.

156
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:19,999
- WHAT'S WRONG?

157
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,999
- BITCH CAN'T MAKE IT.
- OH, GOD.

158
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:22,999
- OH, NO, NO.

159
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,999
I'M ALONE AT A WEDDING
WITHOUT A DATE.

160
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:27,999
THANK GOD
YOU AND I CAN HANG OUT.

161
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:30,999
- I LIKE YOUR DESPERATION,

162
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,999
BUT I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
PICTURING A BIG PAYOFF

163
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:36,999
AT THE END OF THE EVENING.

164
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:40,999
- HOLLY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

165
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:41,999
I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

166
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:42,999
- OH, WELL,
I WAS SITTING AT HOME,

167
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:46,999
THINKING ABOUT HOW UNSELFISH
I WAS BEING BY NOT COMING,

168
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:50,999
WHEN I REALIZED,
HOW SELFISH OF ME NOT TO COME.

169
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,999
I MEAN, THEY'RE ALL
GONNA BE THINKING,

170
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:54,999
"WHERE'S HOLLY?
WHY ISN'T SHE HERE?"

171
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,999
AND THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO

172
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,999
IS MAKE THIS WEDDING
ABOUT ME.

173
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,999
- MM.
OF COURSE.

174
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:01,999
- MM-HMM.

175
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:06,999
OH, THERE THEY ARE,
THE HAPPY COUPLE.

176
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:07,999
- YEAH, THEY DO LOOK HAPPY,
DON'T THEY?

177
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,999
- MM.
THAT COULD'VE BEEN ME.

178
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:11,999
BUT IT'S NOT,

179
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,999
AND, FORTUNATELY,
I'VE MOVED ON.

180
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,999
- HOLLY--
- I SAID I'VE MOVED ON.

181
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,295
- HOLLY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

182
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:46,295
- I'M JUST TAKING A PICTURE
WITH THE GROOM.

183
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:47,295
- HOLLY, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME.

184
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:48,295
YOU'RE CLEARLY
HAVING SOME REGRETS

185
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:49,295
ABOUT BREAKING UP
WITH PAUL.

186
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:51,295
- WHAT? THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I'M FINE.

187
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,295
- OKAY, GOOD.

188
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:54,295
- I GOTTA GO
MEET THE BRIDE.

189
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,295
- WAIT.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

190
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:57,295
BAD IDEA.
YOU CAN'T.

191
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:58,295
- NO, I HAVE TO.

192
00:07:58,295 --> 00:07:59,295
SEE, I'VE JUST REALIZED,

193
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,295
I R.S.V.P.'D NO,

194
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:03,295
AND IF SHE WALKS DOWN THE AISLE
AND SEES ME,

195
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,295
SHE'LL GET SO DISTRACTED,

196
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,295
SHE WON'T EVEN
HEAR HER VOWS.

197
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:08,295
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN,

198
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:11,295
'CAUSE THIS WEDDING'S
NOT ABOUT ME.

199
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:16,295
- [sighs]
KEEP 'EM COMING.

200
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,295
- LOVELY WEDDING.

201
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:21,295
- WHAT'S SO DAMN LOVELY
ABOUT IT?

202
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:22,295
I'M SO SICK
OF BEING A BRIDESMAID.

203
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,295
I MEAN, WHEN'S IT GONNA
BE MY TURN?

204
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,295
WHEN IS IT--I'LL TELL YOU WHEN.
I'LL TELL YOU WHEN.

205
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:28,295
NEVER.

206
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:30,295
I'M SORRY, SORRY.
I DIDN'T--

207
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:34,295
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SOUND SO DESPERATE.

208
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:36,295
- ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

209
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:40,295
HASKELL LUTZ.

210
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,295
- HELLO.

211
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,295
- HI.

212
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:53,295
- [chuckles]

213
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:55,295
HOW'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
IN THE ROOM?

214
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,296
- [sneezes]

215
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:01,295
NOT SO GOOD.

216
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:03,295
I HAVE
THE WORLD'S WORST COLD.

217
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:08,295
OH.
SAMANTHA.

218
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:09,295
- PHIL.

219
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:10,295
- NICE TO MEET YOU, PHIL,

220
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:12,295
BUT I THINK I NEED
TO GO HOME AND REST.

221
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:13,295
- OH, NO, NO.

222
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:14,295
THAT'S THE WORST THING
YOU CAN DO.

223
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:17,295
I MEAN,
YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING.

224
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:22,295
"WALK OFF A COLD,
PARTY ON WITH A FEVER."

225
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,295
- YOU THINK SO?

226
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:25,295
- LET THE HEALING BEGIN.

227
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:27,295
- OKAY.

228
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,295
- I KNOW
I'M ALREADY FEELING BETTER.

229
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:33,295
- HEY, EDEN,
CAN I GET YOU ANOTHER DRINK?

230
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:35,295
- HUH?
- A DRINK?

231
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:37,295
- OH, YEAH.
SURE.

232
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:39,295
- YEAH.

233
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:41,295
- WOW, WHO'S THAT GIRL
THAT PHIL'S WITH?

234
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:43,295
SHE'S GORGEOUS.

235
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:45,295
- GORGEOUS?
YOU THINK SHE'S GORGEOUS?

236
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:49,295
THAT'S NOT GORGEOUS.
I KNOW GORGEOUS.

237
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:51,295
- OKAY.
UH, SORRY.

238
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:52,295
I JUST THOUGHT
SHE WAS KIND OF PRETTY.

239
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:53,295
- OF COURSE YOU DID.

240
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:54,295
ANYONE LOOKS PRETTY

241
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:56,295
IF YOU'RE ALONE AT A WEDDING,
STUART.

242
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,295
- OH--

243
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:00,295
[knocking at door]

244
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:06,295
- HELLO?
LAUREN?

245
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:10,295
ANYONE HERE?

246
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:28,295
[chuckles delightedly]

247
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,295
AAH, AAH.

248
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:35,295
OH.

249
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:45,295
HEY.

250
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:50,295
OH, ALL THE WAY
FROM HAWAII.

251
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:53,295
I DO.

252
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,295
[clears throat]
I DO.

253
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:56,295
OH, I DO.

254
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:59,295
[gasps]

255
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:01,295
OH, CRAP.

256
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:03,295
HI, PAUL.

257
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,295
- I MUST ADMIT,
I ALWAYS WONDERED

258
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,295
WHAT YOU'D LOOK LIKE
AS A BRIDE.

259
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:08,295
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

260
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:10,295
- REALLY?

261
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:15,295
- REALLY.

262
00:11:17,295 --> 00:11:18,546
[knock at door]
- PAUL?

263
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:20,295
UH, WE'RE READY FOR YOUR PICTURE
WITH THE FAMILY.

264
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:24,295
- OKAY.

265
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:37,199
- WELL, MY FATHER
WAS ALWAYS WORKING,

266
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,199
AND MY MOTHER
SPENT ALL HER TIME

267
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,199
WITH MY SISTER
AT HER BEAUTY PAGEANTS.

268
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,199
LITTLE MISS TIPPY-TOES.

269
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,199
- YES.

270
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,199
BUT YOU HAD THE REAL TALENT,
THE REAL BRAINS.

271
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:47,199
YOUR MOTHER JUST
COULDN'T SEE IT.

272
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,199
- NO.
NO, SHE DIDN'T SEE IT AT ALL.

273
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:52,199
YOU KNOW, BOYFRIENDS WOULD
COME OVER TO MY HOUSE,

274
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,199
AND GUESS WHO
THEY WERE INTERESTED IN.

275
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:55,199
- YOUR SISTER?

276
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:58,199
- NO, MY MOTHER.
- OH.

277
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:01,199
IT WAS YOU THEY SHOULD HAVE
BEEN LOOKING AT,

278
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:04,199
A BEAUTY THAT TOOK
A MORE DISCERNING EYE TO SEE.

279
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,199
- AWW.

280
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,199
HASKELL, YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE RIGHT THING TO SAY.

281
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:11,199
- WELL, I'M JUST SPEAKING
FROM MY HEART.

282
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,199
UH, COULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

283
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:17,199
- SURE.
- THANK YOU.

284
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:21,199
[grunting]

285
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,199
THANK YOU.

286
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,199
LOVELY WEDDING.

287
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,199
TRY THE PRAWNS.

288
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,199
- STUART, STUART, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED.

289
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:37,199
- OH, WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE BRIDE?

290
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,199
- OH, SHE WASN'T THERE.

291
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,199
- AND YET THAT CRAZY LOOK IN
YOUR EYE TELLS ME THERE'S MORE.

292
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,199
- SO I'M IN THE BRIDAL SUITE,

293
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:45,199
WEARING THE VEIL,
HOLDING THE BOUQUET,

294
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,199
AND THEN
SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENED.

295
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,199
- WHAT COULD BE WEIRDER
THAN THAT?

296
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,199
- PAUL CAME IN
AND KISSED ME.

297
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,199
- OKAY, YOU WIN.

298
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,199
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU DOING

299
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,199
KISSING THE GROOM
BEFORE HIS WEDDING?

300
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,199
- HE KISSED ME.

301
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,199
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THE BEST PART IS?

302
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:09,199
- THERE'S A BEST PART?

303
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,199
- I FELT NOTHING.

304
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,199
SO NOW I'M SURE
I DON'T WANT TO MARRY PAUL.

305
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,199
IT WAS JUST WEDDING FEVER.

306
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,199
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

307
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,199
BUT WHAT ABOUT PAUL?

308
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,199
- OH, MY GOD.

309
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,199
YOU'RE RIGHT.

310
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:27,199
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
STILL IN LOVE WITH ME.

311
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,199
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

312
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,199
I'VE DESTROYED THIS WEDDING.

313
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,199
[gasps]

314
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,199
I'M LIKE A GORGEOUS,
SEXY WRECKING BALL.

315
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,199
- [sighs]

316
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:39,199
YOU BETTER GO
SET PAUL STRAIGHT.

317
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
- YEAH, YEAH.

318
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,199
YOU KNOW, I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

319
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:44,199
SUDDENLY, THE WEDDING'S
ALL ABOUT ME.

320
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,199
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

321
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
- [laughs loudly]

322
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,199
- HEY, UH, WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME CHAMPAGNE?

323
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,199
- WHY NOT?
- OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

324
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,199
OH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE THIS ONE.

325
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,199
NO, NO, MAYBE--
[stammering]

326
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,199
EDEN.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU OVER HERE.

327
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:05,199
- WHO IS YOUR FRIEND?

328
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,199
- OH, I'M SORRY.
EDEN, SAY HI TO SAMANTHA.

329
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:11,199
SAMANTHA, THIS IS EDEN,
AND HER DATE, BRAD.

330
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,199
- NO, BRETT.
- BRETT, THAT'S RIGHT.

331
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:16,199
BRETT. BRETT.
BRETT. BRETT.

332
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:18,199
- SO, UH,
NICE WEDDING, HUH?

333
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:24,199
- YEAH, IT IS WHEN YOU'RE, UH,
WITH THE RIGHT PERSON.

334
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,199
- YEAH.
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

335
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,199
OOH.

336
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,199
- WELL, THIS WOMAN HERE
HAS GOT IT ALL, OKAY?

337
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,199
- [coughs]

338
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,199
- WELL, NOT AS MUCH
AS THIS GUY.

339
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,199
[growls playfully]

340
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,199
- OH, REALLY?

341
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,199

342
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,199

00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,199
I'MA KEEP IT REAL
WITH YOU, GIRL,

344
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,199
THAT'S JUST NASTY.

345
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,199
- I KNOW.
I BETTER GO.

346
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,199
IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU, PHIL.

347
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,199
- "MEETING YOU"?

348
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,199
SHE WASN'T EVEN YOUR DATE.

349
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,199
- HEY, EDEN,
I BETTER GO, TOO.

350
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,199
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE VALET STATION.

351
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:15,199
SORRY.

352
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:21,199
- VALET STATION?

353
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,199
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

354
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,199
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BRINGING A DATE,

355
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,242
AND SO I PANICKED
LAST MINUTE,

356
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,199
AND I PULLED BRETT
OUT OF A MOVING PRIUS.

357
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,199
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?

358
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,199
- I DON'T KNOW.

359
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,199
WE'RE ACTING LIKE PEOPLE
WHO ARE MORE THAN FRIENDS.

360
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,199
- AND WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO ABOUT IT?

361
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,199
- WELL, I-I--
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ABOUT IT?

362
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,199
- WELL, I'M WILLING
TO GIVE IT A TRY IF YOU ARE.

363
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,199
- REALLY?

364
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,199
- YEAH, REALLY.

365
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:57,199
- WELL, I'M UP FOR THAT.

366
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,199
- I WOULD LOVE
TO KISS YOU RIGHT NOW.

367
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,199
- I WOULD LOVE
TO BE KISSED RIGHT NOW.

368
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,199
- YEAH.
- BUT WE CANNOT.

369
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,199
- RIGHT.
RIGHT.

370
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,199
- NOT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

371
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,199
- YEAH.
YEP.

372
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,199
WAIT FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT
TO TELL HOLLY AND THE GUYS.

373
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,199
- YES.
- RIGHT.

374
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:13,199
- NEAT WEDDING, HUH?

375
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,199
- GREAT WEDDING.

376
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,199
LET'S GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

377
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,199
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

378
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:22,199
- I ALMOST DIDN'T
COME TODAY.

379
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,199
- BUT YOU THOUGHT
THAT FATE MIGHT STEP IN

380
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,199
AND YOU WOULD
MEET A MAN--

381
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,199
MR. GOOD ENOUGH.

382
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,199
- OH, YOU KNOW ME SO WELL.

383
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,199
I'VE GOT
A CRAZY IDEA, HASKELL.

384
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,199
- I LIKE IT ALREADY.

385
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,199
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE BLOW OFF THIS WEDDING,

386
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,199
GO UPSTAIRS TO MY ROOM,

387
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,199
AND, I DON'T KNOW,

388
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,199
YOU MAKE MY LIFE PERFECT
FOR ONE NIGHT?

389
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,199
- YES.
YES, YES.

390
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,199
BUT FIRST, JUST ONE THING.

391
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,199
[shouts]

392
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,199
- WHY DO I EVEN
SHOW UP TO THESE THINGS?

393
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:10,809
- LAUREN, HAVE YOU
GOT A MINUTE?

394
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:11,809
THERE'S SOMETHING
I REALLY NEED TO TELL YOU.

395
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:12,809
- PAUL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

396
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:13,809
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO SEE THE BRIDE

397
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:14,809
BEFORE THE WEDDING.

398
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,809
- I'M SORRY.

399
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:17,809
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN
TO UPSET YOU.

400
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:18,809
- WELL, YOU DID.

401
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:19,809
AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

402
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,809
- OH, MY GOD.
I'M TOO LATE.

403
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,809
- WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M PAUL'S EX-LOVER, HOLLY.

404
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:26,809
- I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

405
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:28,809
- OH, WELL, YES,
BUT THAT WOULD BE SELFISH,

406
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:32,809
AND IT'S YOUR DAY,
YOUR SPECIAL DAY.

407
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:33,809
SO LET ME PUT YOU AT EASE.

408
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:35,809
WHEN PAUL KISSED ME,
IT MEANT NOTHING.

409
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:36,809
- YOU KISSED HER?

410
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,809
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?
- NOPE.

411
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,809
- OH.

412
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:43,809
LOOK, IT WASN'T
PAUL'S FAULT.

413
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,809
I MEAN, HE CAME IN,
SAW ME WEARING YOUR VEIL--

414
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:47,809
- WHY WERE YOU
WEARING MY VEIL?

415
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,809
- OH, LET'S NOT
GET BOGGED DOWN IN DETAILS.

416
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:53,809
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
THIS WEDDING MUST GO ON,

417
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:58,809
BECAUSE, PAUL,
YOU AND I WILL NEVER BE.

418
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:00,809
- PAUL?

419
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:01,809
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

420
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:04,809
- LAUREN, IT'S TRUE.

421
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:06,809
I DID KISS HOLLY.

422
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:07,809
- HE COULDN'T HELP HIMSELF.

423
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:09,809
- [shrieks]

424
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:11,809
- AND I FELT NOTHING.

425
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,809
- NOTHING?
- NOTHING.

426
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,809
- BUT YOU STILL
KISSED ANOTHER WOMAN

427
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,809
ON OUR WEDDING DAY.

428
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:19,809
- LAUREN, I'LL ADMIT THAT THERE
WAS A TEENY, TINY PART OF ME

429
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,809
THAT WAS WONDERING IF I STILL
HAD ANY FEELINGS FOR HOLLY.

430
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:25,809
KISSING HER WAS LIKE
KISSING MY 90-YEAR-OLD AUNT.

431
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:27,809
- OH, COME ON.

432
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,809
- AND NOW I'M MORE CERTAIN
THAN EVER

433
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,809
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE I WANT TO
SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

434
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:36,809
- OH, PAUL.

435
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:37,809
- HOLLY...
- OH.

436
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:38,809
- THANK YOU.

437
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,809
THIS IS THE GREATEST GIFT
YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN US--

438
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:46,809
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MEAN
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ME.

439
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,809
- IT WAS BETWEEN THAT
AND A BREAD MAKER.

440
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,809
- COME ON, SWEETHEART.
LET'S GO GET MARRIED.

441
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:55,809
- THERE YOU GO.

442
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,809
[sighs heavily]

443
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:01,809
- WHAT HAPPENED?

444
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,809
- WELL, LET'S JUST SAY,
STUART,

445
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,809
THANKS TO ME,
A MARRIAGE WAS SAVED.

446
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:11,809
THANK GOD I HELD BACK
ON THAT KISS.

447
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:12,809
- HOLLY, DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

448
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,809
BUT IF I EVER
GET MARRIED AGAIN,

449
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,809
I'D REALLY LIKE IT
IF YOU STAYED HOME.

450
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,809
- HEY, STUART,
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

451
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:22,809
DO YOU EVER THINK
I'M GONNA MEET A GUY

452
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,809
I LOVE ENOUGH TO MARRY?

453
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,809
- YES, I DO.

454
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,809
THE TRICK WILL BE FINDING
A GUY WHO DESERVES YOU.

455
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,809
- THANKS, STUART.

456
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:32,809
- OUT OF MY WAY!

457
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,809
OUT OF MY WAY!
MY SKIN IS ON FIRE!

458
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,809
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

459
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,809
OH, MY GOD.

460
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:51,809
- E-EDEN?
PHIL?

461
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,809
- HI, HI.

462
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:58,809
- LOOK WHO I BUMPED INTO.
