 into some trouble?

Don't worry, Yanna.

Everything will be fine.

 could she possibly get into?

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,620

 off at this way station 36.

to get some of the special fuel
 additive for the t-bird ship.

 that's not true.

 took it for a spin

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,450
Hey.

181
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,590
Mr. Elrick, how you doing?

182
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,930
Don't call him Mr. Elrick.

183
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,490
And don't call
 me late for lunch.

184
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,650
Uncle Bud.
 - Uncle Bud.

185
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,860
Oh, wow.

186
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,470
You surf?

187
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,700
Hell yeah.

188
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,740
I still get out now and again.

189
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,360
But now I'm more
 into cosmic surfing.

190
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,600
Well, you know, meditating,
 jogging on the beach,

191
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,010
living a healthy life, eating
 good food, chasing a girl

192
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,360
every now and then.

193
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,670
You see, the trick is
 positive thinking, yeah?

194
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,170
Positive thinking.

195
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,960
You just don't worry
 about anything.

196
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,330
I mean, it's not worth it.

197
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,070
I'm worrying about
 going to college.

198
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,020
About college, about jobs,
 about making the car payment.

199
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,050
I mean, people don't
 realize how happy

200
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,880
they can be with so little.

201
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,810
I mean, they're into--

202
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,310
their int0 what?

203
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,990
Big houses, and big cars,
 and expensive wardrobe.

204
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,020
It doesn't mean anything.

205
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,400
People are funny.

206
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,080
He's pretty cool
 for being your uncle.

207
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,240
Hey, thanks.

208
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,670
You fellow's hungry?

209
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,790
Yeah, we're starved.

210
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,660
Well, all right.

211
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,650
Come on.

212
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,640
Come on in.

213
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,550
XENA: Oh, man.

214
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,470
Are you guys OK?

215
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,170
Yeah.

216
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,560
Yeah.

217
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,120
XENA: Oh, my parents
 are going to ship me

218
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,520
to the Death Star for this one.

219
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,850
LUNA: You should have checked
 the fuel before we left.

220
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,760
What I should have done
 is not listen to you.

221
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,630
SOLA: Girls, girls.

222
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,150
Let's not argue about this.

223
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,520
Let's just figure
 a way out of here.

224
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,220
You're right.

225
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,100
Great.
 Communicator's out.

226
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,570
Let's check out Beta-45.

227
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,530
I mean, we're here.

228
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,780
The Earth's
 supposed to be safe,

229
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,980
but let's check to be sure.

230
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,560
Oxygen, nitrogen, some
 hydrocarbons, sulfur.

231
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,980
It's a little polluted,
 but we can breath.

232
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,940
Come on.
 Let's go.

233
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,020
I made this lifestyle
 choice a long time ago.

234
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,810
Used to be I felt terrible.

235
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,210
I'd do that-- I'd
 do that red mean.

236
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,130
I'd do dairy products.

237
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,050
I'd surf in nasty beaches.

238
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,430
Now I have changed my life.

239
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:04,620
I'll probably live to be 100.

240
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,700
Got another eviction
 notice for you, Bud.

241
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,380
Ooh, Hassler.

242
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,130
Just put it in the circular
 bin with the rest of them,

243
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,330
will you?

244
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,500
Who are these two?

245
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,790
This is my nephew, David.

246
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,490
And this is his friend Jerry.

247
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,800
This is Hassler.

248
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,310
Welcome to California.

249
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,960
That's nothing to
 worry about, right?

250
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,900
Exactly.

251
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,180
Look, why don't you fellas
 go down to the beach

252
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,910
down there, will you?

253
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,360
I got a little business
 I got to take care of.

254
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,500
Is there anything
 we can do to help?

255
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,510
There is.

256
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,250
You can go down to that water.

257
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,400
You can enjoy yourself, have
 a good time, chase some girls.

258
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,050
Enjoy California, OK?

Jerry, man, be cool.

It's like you haven't
 seen a girl before.

 Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What are you doing?

266
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,900
I don't want to get sunburned.

267
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,460
If you're smart
 you'd put some on.

268
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,910
No, I don't need no
 stinking lotion, man.

269
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,250
You know, that girl over there
 is going to eat her heart out,

270
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,270
buddy.
 - OK, Mr. Sun God.

271
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,280
No, sir.

Hey, you were right, man.
 The chicks dig you.

Thanks.

Man, this place is incredible.

walked by and winked at me.

No, she probably had
 something in her eye, Dave.

Anyway, I'm thirsty.

282
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,720
Let's get something to drink.

 go, sweetheart.

Thank you.

How can I help you guys?
 - Hey.

287
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,470
Yeah, can I get a Coke
 and a cheeseburger?

288
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,060
We don't serve animal
 products or raw sugar here.

289
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,530
Listen, I'm allergic to
 anything with vegetables in it.

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,360
Pizza?

291
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,300
I could make you one with
 soy cheese on ciabatta.

292
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,140
I'll have one of those.

293
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,140
And how about a glass of water?

294
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,620
You got it.

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,330
Could I get one of
 those, too, please?

Put it on my tab, OK?

Do you want this on this

Whatever, man.

Dr. Veg is a genius.

He was a full professor
 at MIT in Physics.

We used his propulsion
 system in the space shuttle.

My Uncle Bud's,
 down the beach.

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,800
Wow.

00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,700
You're Bud's nephew?

Why didn't you say so?

 been called that before.

Who are those people
 with Bud down there?

You didn't know
 that Bud's nephew

321
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,640
came into town for the summer?

322
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,320
It's too bad he won't have
 any place to stay after I

323
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,060
get done with his uncle.

00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,140

 we'll have him in jail.

 likes your designs

333
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,960
and invests in your company,
 uses their Marketing Cloud.

Well, the sky is the limit.

But if you don't win,
 you could go under.

Unfortunately, you're right.

337
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,890
Of course I am.

 I tell you to shoot.

 some representation,

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,900
I hope they haven't
 all died or something.

359
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,330
What I wouldn't give
 for a drink right now.

360
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,370
What you do it with
 Gonad for a drink?

361
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,140
You're sick.

362
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,060
What are you going to do
 if we run into Betonians?

363
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,110
Run like hell.

364
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,990
I heard if they catch you,
 they cook you and eat you.

365
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,410
Stop it.
 Why?

366
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,550
Are you scared?

367
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,920
No.

368
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,730
Don't they say when your
 vehicle breaks down you're

369
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,400
supposed to stay with it?

370
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,430
It's a little late for that.

371
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,330
Babes out here are
 easy to figure out, man.

372
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,820
It's like, you just ignore them.

373
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,850
Don't even try to
 understand them.

374
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,730
It's like they're
 from another planet.

You see, out here,
 they're all amazing looking.

377
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,080
I mean, all of them.

378
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,330
They're a dime a dozen.

379
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,040
It's all in your attitude.

380
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,800
Is there, like, a
 walk or something?

381
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,530
Something like this.

383
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,690
Kind of like that?

It's cool.

385
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,920
You guys will get it.

386
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,740
These are very interesting
 specimens, the Betonians.

387
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,940
What are they doing?

388
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,490
Ingesting nutrients and doing
 some sort of mating rituals.

389
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,450
They're not the
 most graceful bunch.

391
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,350
Did you hear something?

392
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,290
It must be the
 Santa Ana winds.

393
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,760
They're kind of cute.

394
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,990
I wonder if they eat?

395
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,090
I'd hate to be lunch.

396
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,450
I think we should
 talk to them.

398
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,190
What if they take us captive?

399
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,190
So anyway, you guys be cool.

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,060
You'll get some girls.

401
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,380
Hi, beta boys.

402
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,590
Whoa.

403
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,090
Be still my beating heart.

404
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,350
I'm with my friends and
 our vehicle ran out of fuel.

405
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,840
And we got a little lost.

406
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,540
I'll say.

407
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,150
Is your vehicle a submarine?

408
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,350
No, it's a spaceship.

409
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,430
Shut up.

410
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,820
California is a great place.

 has a place here.

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,830
Sure.

414
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,320
Having a place on the
 beach will do it every time.

415

They're kind of
 cute for beta's.

Is your settlement that way?

417
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,090
You could call it that.

Why is your skin so red?

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,880
Well, like I was on this
 wave the size of a house.

421
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,610
I crashed right through the
 tube and I hit it really hard.

422
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,250
I thought I was going to die.

423
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:14,800
These tattoos are an ancient
 Sumarian symbol of manhood.

424
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,490
That's very exciting.

425
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,800
So where are you girls from?

426
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,770
You got some kind of accent.

We're exchange students.

Are we having them for dinner.

They looks pretty
 tasty, don't they?

Well we've got plenty
 of soy burgers.

 - Well, we--

We have to go back.
 Don't you remember?

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,670
Well, look, while we're
 here, this could make

a great social studies project.
 - Or biology.

449
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,450
Well, I guess until
 we find the fuel

450
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,240
we really have no choice.

00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,240
You'll see at the contest.

898
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,190
We saved her.

899
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,430
And I got the suits.

00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:41,920
- Oh, that's great.
 - Oh, great.

Dave?

902
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,360
You saved me.

00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,860
What's wrong?

905
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,200
Isn't that what I
 was supposed to do?

906
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,190
Yeah, of course.

907
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,860
That means I have to go back.

908
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,460
I have to leave you.

 I'll be grounded

00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,890
Probably never get to
 leave Vasquez ever again.

Did you see [INAUDIBLE].
 Wow.

Yeah, this is-- this is
 what I meditated for.

01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,520
This-- this is gnarly.

959
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,630
Oh, but now I feel
 sorry for Sally.

960
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:17,950
You know, she and I, well,
 we used to go out together.

961
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:20,790
You should have told me.

962
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:25,910
We were going to get
 married, but I was young.

963
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:27,210
I didn't want to be tied down.

964
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,700
Now I'm kind of having
 second thoughts.

01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,600
You still care about her?

01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,010
Yeah.

Well, I know she
 cares about you.

969
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,290
She doesn't want to
 change you or anything.

970
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:45,590
Nothing like that.

01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:48,600
She loves you just
 the way you are.

972
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,340
It's kind of hard living
 out on your own on the edge

01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,740
all the time.

974
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,180
I think you should talk to her.

Yeah, don't you-- don't

Well, sure.

 younger and younger,

I feel like Rip Van Winkle.

I wake up 20 years later
 and everything's changed.

There's nothing wrong
 with getting older.

I've been thinking.

Maybe we ought to get
 back together again.

I'd be a brand name?

01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,740
You'd be a consultant
 and you'd make appearances.

 to buy every souvenir

We can barely move
 around in here.

 I marry ends up being so cheap.

GORK: You know, you were right.

This trip was exactly what
 I needed to clear my head

Recharge it you did, didn't you?

01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,920
You know, but I'm still a
 little worried about not

 weekend at Sola's or Luna's.

Good luck.

01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,780
It's a spaceship.

01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,560
Told you.

1076
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,670
Whoa, dude.

1077
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:49,180
You mean, you're a
 beach babe from beyond?

1078
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,830
Bet your ass, dude.

1079
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:52,800
Oh, wow.

1080
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:59,030
Luna, I mean, what do I say?

1081
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,750
Don't say anything.
 We'll be back.

1082
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:12,490
This has been great.

1083
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:14,440
I'm so glad I met you.

1084
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,780
I have to go.

1085
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,000
I can't ask for your phone
 number or your address?

1086
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,230
I'll find you.
 Don't worry.

1087
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:51,930
