1
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,642
<i>I need money</i>
<i>and I need jobs.</i>

2
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:42,376
<i>So is this-- Is this</i>
<i>a thing you can provide?</i>

3
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,111
- <i>Yes.</i>
<i>- 'Cause you said you could.</i>

4
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,647
<i>I-- I'd like to do one TV spot,</i>

5
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:47,314
<i>- maybe, could you...</i>
<i>- Yeah. Oh, yeah.</i>

6
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,683
<i>Could you get me</i>
<i>on one of the</i> Jimmys?

7
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:50,484
- <i>Yes.</i>
<i>- I need money...</i>

8
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:51,653
- <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- ...and I need</i>
<i>opportunities.</i>

9
00:00:51,753 --> 00:00:52,921
<i>And I wanted to get--</i>

10
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,154
<i>I want to get</i>
<i>into the comedy clubs,</i>

11
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,523
<i>like, uh, the--</i>
<i>The Laughing Hut.</i>

12
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,324
<i>Yes, I could</i>
<i>totally see you there.</i>

13
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,993
<i>And can you-- can you</i>
<i>get me into these places?</i>

14
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,394
<i>Yeah, I can get you</i>
<i>into all those places, buddy.</i>

15
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:01,996
- <i>Yes.</i>
<i>- Yeah, like, I need--</i>

16
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,598
<i>But I need that</i>
<i>to happen, like, now.</i>

17
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,165
<i>I need something to happen</i>
<i>finally, you know what I mean?</i>

18
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,067
- <i>Yes!</i>
<i>- Okay, so let's go.</i>

19
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,102
- Make it happen.
- Hey, I get it.

20
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:12,272
Look, fame, fortune,
that's everything

21
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,308
and don't let anybody
tell you otherwise,

22
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,644
because without that,
you're nobody.

23
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:20,648
But you can't do it alone.
It takes two to tango.

24
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,952
Okay, I feel like
you're not listening to me
or hearing me at all.

25
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:25,385
No, I hear you.
You're in a rut.

26
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,421
You're not booking.
You wanna make some changes.

27
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:30,257
So, we'll find a new agent,
new manager,

28
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,092
and, you know, maybe
you could shake things up too.

29
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,161
Like, work a dummy
into your act or something.

30
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,129
I hear ventriloquism
is making a comeback.

31
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,198
It's not. I don't know
who told you that.

32
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,400
- People, and it is.
- No, it is not.

33
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,435
Yes, it is.

34
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,504
Find a puppet
that looks like you.

35
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,907
I can see it right now.

36
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:47,976
That's not a thing.

37
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:49,409
- It is a thing.
- No, it's not.

38
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,878
- It's a great thing.
- What are you talk--

39
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,046
What is this? What is this--

40
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,280
this puppet suggestion?

41
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,215
Look, it's been months, okay?

42
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,383
And you've brought me nothing.

43
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,151
Nobody. No agents,
no managers.

44
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,120
You've introduced me
to zero people.

45
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,023
Well, it takes time.

46
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,658
Yeah. I'm not sure
I even know what you do.

47
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:05,225
What do you do?

48
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,395
What do you mean "what"?
I do it all. I'm your guy.

49
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,531
You said you're a publicist,
but you don't even
have a website.

50
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,299
- There's no
phone number to call.
- No, I am. I am.

51
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,635
Oh, excuse me, uh...

52
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:16,470
- Are you a publicist?
- Yes. Eight dollars?

53
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,171
- You are?
You're a real publicist?
- Yes.

54
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,775
- You have other clients?
- Excuse me, I'm counting.

55
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:22,577
One...

56
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,277
Two...

57
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,451
- Three.
- I'm letting you go.

58
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,553
- I'm moving on.
- What?

59
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,489
- You're fired.
- What about us?

60
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,224
- What about our relationship?
- "Us"? What does that mean?

61
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,159
- What about the tip
that you promised?
- There is no us. The tip?

62
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,228
There is no us.
You care about yourself.

63
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,462
You don't care
about me at all.

64
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:46,000
That is not true.
No, I think of both.

65
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,334
I need you.

66
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,336
I don't need you.

67
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,474
Fine! Rip my heart out,
why don't you?

68
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,877
No, I don't need you, anyway.

69
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:57,945
I'll find somebody better.
Just you wait and see.

70
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,648
- I'll find myself
a real somebody.

71
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:04,317
The patient,
essentially, is nobody.

72
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,722
- No family, no friends.
- Hmm.

73
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:11,759
His condition is quite frankly
bizarre, to say the least.

74
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,462
He has the mind of a--
a five-year-old,

75
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:19,734
or say, um,
a Labrador retriever.

76
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,201
Understanding very little

77
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,204
and allowing himself
to be quite easily led.

78
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,842
Observe. Patient,
would you stand up?

79
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,812
Stand up. Yeah, up, up.

80
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:32,547
Yeah. Perfect.

81
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,816
How about you, uh, maybe
put your hand on your head?

82
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,350
Can you do that for me? Yeah,
put your hand on your head.

83
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,986
On your head. Yep.

84
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:41,723
Now your nose,
your finger on your nose.

85
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:45,358
Yeah, yeah. Right.
How about your chin? Do that?

86
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,628
How about for your--
Can you find your ear?

87
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:50,698
Yeah. Great. Have a seat.

88
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,567
You can have a seat now.

89
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,334
Have a seat.

90
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,537
No, no. Sit. You're done.

91
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,873
Here you go, just sit down.
Yeah, you're good.

92
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,274
You're good. We're done.
No, no, you did great.

93
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,645
You did wonderfully.
Good job.

94
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,782
- See? It's...
- What do you think it is?

95
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,382
Age regression, perhaps?

96
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,652
We do think
it is that, in part,

97
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:14,354
possibly caused
by some severe trauma,

98
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,356
the loss of a loved one.
It's hard to say.

99
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,559
The patient has lost
the ability to speak.

100
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,162
- Oh, I see.
- He's not deaf

101
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,197
and he's technically not mute.

102
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,133
His case is medically
undefinable.

103
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,534
Is his condition reversible?

104
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,002
Mm, you know,

105
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,336
with a proper amount of care

106
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,073
and, uh, a lot
of exposure therapy

107
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,776
and neurophysical
cognitive therapy,

108
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:39,147
and if he were to have
one meaningful connection,

109
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:43,184
yes, it's possible
that he could regain
his understanding of the world,

110
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,521
his ability to speak,
his-- his emotions.

111
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,123
- Fascinating.
- Hmm.

112
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,324
So, what's our first course
of action?

113
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,628
Well, the state is not gonna pay
for any of that,

114
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:57,899
so we are gonna put his ass
on the first bus downtown.

115
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,387
Hey, Don, it's Lenny!

116
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,659
You don't even know
why I'm calling you, buddy.

117
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:28,696
Okay, that, yeah, that is why
I'm calling you. But listen.

118
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,965
No, I'm just talking
about representation.

119
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,567
Hello? Oh, man.

120
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,435
Geez, Louise. Geez, Louise!

121
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,516
Mikey. Mikey, please.

122
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,018
I just-- I'm begging you.

123
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:54,088
I just-- I need a client.

124
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,488
No, you're getting personal.

125
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,558
I am a real publicist, Mikey.

126
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,260
No, I get people things.

127
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,547
What? Are you kidding?

128
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:22,950
No!

129
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,418
God! Ugh!

130
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:34,494
Hi, Armando.

131
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:37,732
Yeah. How you doin', buddy?

132
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,767
Oh. Oh, shoot.

133
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,469
Hold on, let me call you back.

134
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,607
Hey, it's Lenny
from Starmaker Publicity.

135
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,077
I'm sorry, I just don't see
your name on the list.

136
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,379
Um, which film production
are you with again?

137
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,747
I'm with the, um...

138
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,816
Um, you know me,
I'm a big-time publicist, so...

139
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,551
- You said that.
- I mean, well, you know,

140
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,554
I'm not some bozo
that, um, you know, just...

141
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:37,625
I-- I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I don't, um...

142
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,027
Okay, look.
I can give you some money.

143
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,997
I mean, just a little bit.
I mean, not now,
but down the line.

144
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:46,734
Look, I find the right client,
I cut you in on the profits.

145
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,936
Bing, bang, boom.
We're somebodies.

146
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,838
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

147
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,640
Okay, well, wait,
wait, wait. Okay.

148
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,608
I'll give you
five dollars. Please.

149
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,610
Just let me on the lot, please.

150
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,813
Please let me on the lot.
Please let me on the lot.

151
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:01,481
Please let me on the lot.
Please let me on the lot.

152
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:08,856
What?
 What do you mean he won't get outta the trailer?

153
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,825
<i>I don't know, he said</i>
<i>he lost the character.</i>

154
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:15,495
Ugh, you know what? I've had it
with his method acting bullshit.

155
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,264
It's just all nonsense.

156
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:21,369
All he's gotta do
is go hit the mark,
say his words and that's it.

157
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:22,737
Spencer Tracy said that.

158
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,905
Good enough for him,
that's good enough for me.

159
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,874
- Put him on the phone.
<i>- I tried already.</i>

160
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,709
<i>He said phones</i>
<i>weren't invented yet.</i>

161
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,579
Trailers with air conditioning
weren't invented yet either,

162
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,515
but he doesn't mind sitting
in one of those all day.

163
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,917
- Fuck off.
<i>- Well, production's</i>
<i>at a standstill.</i>

164
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,020
- Fuck off!
- <i>They need you</i>
<i>to think of something.</i>

165
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,521
<i>Please. Now.</i>

166
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,593
Holy shit.

167
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,271
Oh.

168
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,341
Get in.

169
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,543
Come here. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Get in.

170
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,513
Get in. You--
you speak English?

171
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,447
Come here, I got a job for you.

172
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,015
Come on, this is gonna be good.

173
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,151
Come on, I promise you.
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

174
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,253
Oh, you should have
brought some. That's okay.

175
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,626
Latte. Pronto.

176
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,161
Got it.

177
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,597
Get Booker a latte
as fast as possible.

178
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,503
Updates?

179
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,270
Mr. Bingsley's still
in his trailer.

180
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,672
- Sir.
- Excuse me?

181
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,640
Remember to call him
Sir Bingsley.

182
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,676
I don't want another episode
like last time.

183
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,611
Sorry, Sir Bingsley's
still in there.

184
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,046
We've been shooting
second unit stuff,

185
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:13,881
but the rest of the cast
is getting a little irritated.

186
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,584
Nobody's-- nobody's walked.

187
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,118
Chad Luxt went for a drive
to blow off some steam,

188
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:18,886
- but he said he'd be back.
- Is he sober?

189
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,387
- For now.
- All right. Christiana?

190
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:22,756
She's fine. She's Skyping
with the government of Uganda

191
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,992
about a charity visit
or something.

192
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,663
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

193
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,398
So, what's the plan?

194
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,234
Him.

195
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,753
Look at that!

196
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,789
Sir Bingsley. May I come in?

197
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,926
What the hell kind
of highfalutin name is that?

198
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,396
I answer to one name
and one name only...

199
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,964
and that's Billy the Kid.

200
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:08,169
Uh-huh. All right,
Billy the Kid.

201
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:09,970
Okay, what-- Hang on,

202
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:11,872
don't drop the "Sir" part now.

203
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,141
- Excuse me?
- Sir Billy the Kid.

204
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,743
I think that gonna
suit me just fine.

205
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,745
Got kind of a nice ring
to it, don't it?

206
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,581
How about you call me that
from now on, all right?

207
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,082
Yeah, make an announcement
to whoever all
is out there, right?

208
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:25,219
It's Sir Billy the Kid
from now on.

209
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,720
Listen to me, fuckface.

210
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,123
You're either a Sir
and an actor from England,

211
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:32,359
or you're Billy the fucking Kid,
but you can't be both.

212
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,930
No, I'm done. I'm done.
I'm sick of this shit.

213
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,265
I'm sick of it.

214
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,834
Yappin' your fuckin' mouth,
you ain't worth shit.

215
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:42,203
Take a look at this guy.

216
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:46,240
What about him?

217
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,908
He's a dead ringer for you.

218
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,243
This man don't look
nothin' like me.

219
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:50,711
I mean, look at him.
He's too short.

220
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,112
He's the exact
same height as you.

221
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,781
He's just not wearing
lifts like you do!

222
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,115
Hey, now you listen
to me, all right?

223
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,951
I never worn a lift
in my goddamn life.

224
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:58,752
You know what? I'm done.
I'm fuckin' done.

225
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,187
I probably don't even know
what a lift is

226
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,590
- 'cause they haven't
been invented yet.
- Stop.

227
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,024
- Stop the shit.
- Stop and cut the shit.

228
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,627
Don't think I'm not gonna
take him into makeup

229
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,228
so he can finish
the day for you.

230
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,897
Ooh!

231
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:10,731
Yeah?

232
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,400
Now we rollin',
big boss-man.

233
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,768
Now we rollin'.

234
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,003
And guess what, fuckface?

235
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,005
I'd like to see you try that.

236
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,808
Let's go. Let's go!

237
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,410
Okay, let's see what
we're working with here.

238
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:25,547
- Oh, my God,
it's a spitting image.
- Oh, my God...

239
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:28,115
- You look exactly like him.
- I don't see it at all.

240
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,284
- How are gonna do this?
- All you have to do

241
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:31,785
is just put some color on.

242
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,187
You're actually
way more attractive.

243
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:34,755
I would agree with that,
actually. The bone structure.

244
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,457
But I don't see it at all,
I don't see it all.

245
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:38,359
- You are always so negative.
- You're crazy.

246
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,160
Would you help instead
of hurting things?

247
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,396
- I just-- Over here.
- Is this your first time?

248
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,765
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Okay, let's sit back down.

249
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,467
Let's sit back down.
You're stressing him out.

250
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,637
- Why are you moving your face?
- Look at you,
how gorgeous you are.

251
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:51,171
All right, so this is
the sound stage. Real dirt.

252
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:54,475
That's the bank over there,
that's the saloon.

253
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:57,177
So... Tony. Tony.

254
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,413
This is Tony London,
the director.

255
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,115
This is the guy.

256
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:08,757
Fine.

257
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,291
Chad, Chad. Chad.

258
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:11,392
This is Chad Luxt.

259
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,927
Okay, he plays Black Bart,
the other lead.

260
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,967
I understand you're
from the streets, hmm?

261
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:23,904
Mad respect, bro.
Mad respect.

262
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,641
Word. All right.

263
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,175
He's a character.

264
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,944
Uh, and this is the great
Christiana Dior.

265
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:34,081
I'm sure you know who she is.
She's playing your wife,

266
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,350
the one that you're leaving
for Bart's girl.

267
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,422
Nice meetin' you.
Oh, right. Uh...

268
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:44,124
See, you ain't accustomed
to seeing me like this.

269
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,260
I'm fixin' to stay
in character.

270
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,732
- Too short, ain't he?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

271
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,833
I'm gonna put him
on an apple box.

272
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,506
All right, as for you--
Hey, hey, hey.

273
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:02,343
As for you, Bart knows
you're sleeping with his girl.

274
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:05,045
Your wife is ready
to blow her brains out,

275
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,482
so what I need from you
is give me a--

276
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,819
"This is such a mess."

277
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,387
That kind of look, that--
that kind of feel.

278
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,423
You got it? Yes or no?

279
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:20,894
Jesus Christ,
can you even talk?

280
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,031
You don't know
if you can talk?

281
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,301
- Let's go, it's hot.
- All right, just fuck it.

282
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,469
Do nothing.

283
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,204
Works for tons of actors.

284
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,610
Take it, Tony.

285
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,850
Fly.
Fly like a bird.

286
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,484
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

287
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,220
Ready? Say a prayer.

288
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:49,223
Right here, sir.

289
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,728
Nope, nope, nope.
Right here. Just hold still.

290
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,964
Right, I need you here.
I need you here.

291
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,299
The guy won't stop moving.

292
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,402
No, it's fine.

293
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,339
Up on the box, please, sir.

294
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,675
Stay, no, right there.

295
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:09,343
- On the box.
- On the box, buddy?

296
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:10,210
Got him? Fine.

297
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,679
- On the box.
- On the box.

298
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,814
Right there.

299
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,817
All right, just be yourself now.
Be yourself. Come on.

300
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,820
Just connect your emotions with
the suffering of the streets.

301
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,255
Feel me? Hmm?

302
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,957
I'm gonna come at you hard, bro.
I'm gonna come at you real hard.

303
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,561
Stay on the box.
Right here. Good.

304
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,362
Come on, let's spin 'em.

305
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,365
32-A, take one.

306
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:33,434
All right.

307
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:36,036
And... action.

308
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:39,841
You think you can mess
with my girl, Billy?

309
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,074
You get him, Bart.

310
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,143
He's a cheatin'
sack of shit as it is.

311
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,780
You think you're fast,
but I'm faster.

312
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,850
You wanna get to know my blade?

313
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,685
You wanna get to know my blade?

314
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:53,287
- He's looking right
into camera.
- Just keep rolling.

315
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:56,758
You wanna-- You wanna
get to know my blade? You wanna?

316
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:58,626
Do you want-- What is the line?

317
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:01,663
- "And you will know the other.
- " - I don't need the line reading.

318
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:04,198
- Also, it's a stupid line.
- Just say the goddamn line,

319
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,633
- will ya?
- It's a terrible line.

320
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,267
The line is terrible, okay?
I don't wanna say it.

321
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,336
I'll say it for you
if you can't figure out how.

322
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,238
- No, I know how to say it.
- Talkin' about your gun.

323
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,608
- No, I know what...
- In case you didn't
read the script.

324
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,910
- Maybe you should go home...
- Try not looking

325
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,879
at the camera on this one?

326
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,379
- Yeah, you.
- Terrible line.

327
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,448
- Come over here. Step...
- Marker.

328
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,585
And, action.

329
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:26,654
- You think you can mess...
-  - Right into camera.

330
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:28,188
It's his first time doing this.

331
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,090
He's a cheatin'
sack of shit as it is.

332
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,392
Over there. Over there. There.

333
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,328
All right. Can we--
Can I just go back?

334
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:35,897
Put him back on the box.

335
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,566
- Take three.
- And, action.

336
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,336
- There we go.
- Four.

337
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,037
- Action!
- I'm feelin' good now.
Feelin' good.

338
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,875
- Can I just go back?
- Yes. Uh, take it
from the top.

339
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:48,141
Take five.

340
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:51,211
You gonna step in line
and get the blade,

341
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,347
or you gonna get the...

342
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,316
- What-- what is the line?
- Just the word "other"!

343
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,186
The other.

344
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,655
- Oh.
- Twenty.

345
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:01,956
- Action.
- You think

346
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,925
you can mess
with my girl, Billy?

347
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,459
You get him, Bart.

348
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,762
- Hmm?
 - He's a lyin' sack of shit as it is.

349
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:10,899
- Cut his tiny little balls off.
- Oh, shut up, you.

350
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,266
Hey, don't improv.

351
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,401
- You don't improv.
- How many fucking times?

352
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:17,137
We're over lunch by an hour.
All these extras
are in pain and...

353
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,172
Rolling. Action.

354
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:23,778
Now, you should step in line
and get the blade...

355
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,589
- The other.
- I hate you, Billy!

356
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,927
Bang, and cut!

357
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,096
Hey, hey, hey.

358
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,099
- You gotta breathe.
-  - We're going to go again.

359
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,702
Latte, pronto.

360
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,470
Good work.

361
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,776
Excuse me, Mr. Pronto.
I'm a publicist for the, um...

362
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,310
Can I call you Latte?

363
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,580
- Is that your name?
- Oh, my God, I love that name.

364
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,314
- Amazing. You are.
- I had no idea!

365
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,817
A lot of big stars are going
by inanimate objects these days.

366
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,853
Stepping in. Uh, we're
at lunch, folks. That's lunch.

367
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,287
- Oh, thank you. Yeah, yeah.
- Aww.

368
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,423
I'm gonna take Latte Pronto
if you need us.

369
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:11,491
I'm sorry. Who?

370
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:13,962
Oh, oh, no, it's,
uh, Latte Pronto.

371
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:15,763
He's the star of--
Yeah. Latte Pronto.

372
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,066
- Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry,
Mr. Pronto.
- Oh.

373
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:19,166
I will write that down.

374
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,467
- Oh, that's okay.
- It's okay.

375
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:21,936
You're doing great,
you're doing awesome.

376
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:23,805
- So sweet.
- No, you guys are so sweet.

377
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:26,440
Are you kidding me?
You've just been so great
in expediting everything.

378
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,543
- Thank you. Okay,
I'm so sorry again.
- Oh, it's okay.

379
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:30,044
All right, see you
guys at lunch.

380
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,244
- We'll be on the lot.
- See you at lunch.

381
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,446
- Absolutely, thank you.
- See you there.

382
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:33,748
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

383
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,382
- She's disgusting.
- She is the absolute

384
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,618
- worst person on this Earth.
- I can't stand her.

385
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:38,151
Are you kidding me?
"It's time for lunch."

386
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,487
Right here.

387
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:41,789
Hmm.

388
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,826
Mm...

389
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,895
Wow. Latte Pronto.

390
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:50,732
You and me are gonna do
big things, pal, I can feel it.

391
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,634
Look, that guy's the head
of the studio over there.

392
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:55,103
All his teeth are fake,
by the way. I'll say hi later.

393
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,071
Oh, see her? The one
who looks like a model?

394
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,406
Don't look. She's actually
a prostitute.

395
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:02,209
- Hi.
- Hi. Let's do two
of the salmon salads--

396
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,745
Hold the salmon
'cause of the mercury.

397
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:06,346
No cheese or fatty nuts
of any kind on there, please.

398
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,216
Oh, balsamic on the side--
Actually, scratch that.
No dressing,

399
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,986
just the lettuce rinsed
thoroughly with Evian water,
we're gonna split that.

400
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:14,421
Oh, and five energy drinks.
You want any?
Oh, and take this away.

401
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,124
What, are you
trying to kill us?

402
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,126
Who still serves bread
at a restaurant?

403
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,527
Might as well feed us
a pack of cigarettes.

404
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:21,062
You don't smoke, do you?

405
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,264
Well, hang on.
That's the production. Hello?

406
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,634
Yeah, I'm with Mr. Pronto.

407
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:27,769
Wait, what?

408
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,172
Slow down. What? What?

409
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:33,941
Okay.

410
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,844
I'll let him know.

411
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,549
Great news, Latte. Sir
Bingsley's dead.

412
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:44,118
As some of you may have heard,

413
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,587
Sir Thomas Kit Bingsley

414
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:49,222
died a few hours ago.

415
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,725
Died?

416
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,126
Who? What? How is...

417
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,293
Of course, there's gonna be

418
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,997
a complete autopsy eventually,

419
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:59,767
<i>but it appears</i>
<i>that he asphyxiated himself,</i>

420
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,335
presumably while trying
to find some truth

421
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:05,707
for the big hanging scene
we're shooting tomorrow.

422
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,478
The asphyxiation
may also have been...

423
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:15,049
autoerotic in nature.

424
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:16,651
Now, that makes sense.

425
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:20,688
We, we-- we don't know and--
and it's all very unclear.

426
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,256
Uh, but I think it was.

427
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,694
- Wow.
- Well, that was stupid.

428
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:30,031
Now, I'd like to take
a moment to speak towards

429
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:32,867
what-- what Tommy
would've wanted.

430
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,169
He, of course, would say,

431
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:38,271
"Let's stop filming,
can the entire movie."

432
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,240
- What? That's crazy.
- Yeah.

433
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,177
No, no, we gave it a go.
You know, we tried.

434
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:46,814
But you all know
and would agree,

435
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,684
Tommy was a fuckin' asshole.

436
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:50,852
- Yes.
- Well...

437
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:52,687
- Yeah, he was.
- He was a bit of an asshole.

438
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:55,723
That's the long
and short of it.

439
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:57,390
But we're gonna
finish this movie

440
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,326
and we're gonna finish it
with that guy.

441
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,700
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck.

442
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,739
Got no time to lose.
Can't let them
change their minds.

443
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,909
This is big time.
Move outta the way.
Move, move!

444
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,210
Stars coming through.

445
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,180
Hey, Latte. Welcome.
Welcome to your team.

446
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,615
You got me, your agent.

447
00:21:20,715 --> 00:21:23,151
I'll handle all incoming calls.
I take ten percent.

448
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:25,418
Got your manager.
He'll manage affairs.

449
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,822
Ten percent also.
It's industry standard.

450
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:28,956
Got your business manager.

451
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:31,458
He'll manage business affairs.
Five percent.

452
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,228
Got your lawyer,
litigation, of course.
Five percent too.

453
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:37,064
Got your publicist,
you know him,
we'll put him on a weekly.

454
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:38,398
Stylist. Weekly, also.

455
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,902
We got a personal assistant.
She's hourly.

456
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,369
Plus, we got you an intern.

457
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:45,006
Good news is he's free.

458
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,341
Really? Hmm.

459
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:52,013
Well, I guess there's a law
against that now,
so you'll have to pay him too.

460
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,514
Ah.

461
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,252
Ah, Latte. Who's got
your back, huh?

462
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,354
You know, the studio was gonna
stick you in some hotel
or apartment somewhere,

463
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,057
but I talked
some sense into them.

464
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:04,926
Look at this spot.

465
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:07,528
It's perfect for you,
Latte. Think about it.

466
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:10,531
You can look over the streets
you once begged on.

467
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,800
Latte Pronto killing it.

468
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,743
Latte! What, are you
trying to sleep out here?

469
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:31,478
What are you looking for?
Drugs? That's no good.

470
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:35,182
Look, I can get you some
if you need it, but we can't
have that in the papers.

471
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:36,817
No, I've been
following you all night.

472
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:38,418
I was parked
outside your house,

473
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,553
waiting to take you
to set tomorrow,

474
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:41,322
but enough is enough, buddy.

475
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,991
Gosh, you gotta be
on set in two hours.
You're gonna be exhausted.

476
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,426
I mean, I like a good walk
as much as anybody,

477
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:47,929
but let's not make a habit
out of this, okay?

478
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,764
- Walking around the street?
- Walking around outside?

479
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:51,732
- The streets of LA?
- You could've been mugged.

480
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,234
That's insane.
Nobody walks in LA.

481
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:54,568
Have the studio
call a car for you.

482
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:56,103
Are you serious right now?

483
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:58,706
Looking really-- it's looking
blotchy on this side.

484
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,107
- On this side...
- Wake up.

485
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:01,676
Oh, my God, this is insane.

486
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:03,311
Oh, I'm sorry, are you
knocking on the door again?

487
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:05,279
- Wow, wow.
- He just got in the chair!

488
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:08,282
I need you not to rush me,
all right? Where is the wig?

489
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,151
Cameras rolling.

490
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,386
Action.

491
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:13,888
Don't leave me, Billy.

492
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:17,525
You leave me, Billy,
I swear to God,
I'll blow my brains out.

493
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:20,493
Christ. He can barely
keep his eyes open.

494
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:21,929
Just keep rolling.

495
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,131
Latte. Open.

496
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,834
Open. Eyes open.

497
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:28,069
I mean it, Bill.

498
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,938
What does that other girl
have on me, huh?

499
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:34,175
Is it the tobacco?
'Cause I can quit that.

500
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:35,509
Why is he smiling?

501
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,777
There's nothing
in the script about smiling.

502
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:38,779
I-- I know there's nothing
in the script.

503
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,948
Look, he's about to leave
his wife, right?

504
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:43,451
And I can't have him
smiling!

505
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:46,887
Latte. Latte, no.
No, no smiling.

506
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:49,757
The script says,
"Look sorrowful," so...

507
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,792
Just do nothing!

508
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:54,228
It doesn't say do nothing.
It actually says,
"Look sorrowful,"

509
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,697
- if you have the sides.
- Elaine?

510
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:58,332
- I'm just gonna...
- Oh, God...

511
00:24:58,432 --> 00:25:00,768
Bill, is it my clothes?

512
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,471
My hair? Is it the fact
that we's cousins?

513
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:05,639
He's blinking now.

514
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,275
Look at...
Look at her.

515
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:09,977
Look, look, look at her.

516
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:14,582
Her. Yeah, yeah, look at the--
the pretty dirty lady.

517
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:16,484
Yes!

518
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:19,620
Have it your way, Billy.
I hate your guts, anyway.

519
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:25,359
Now she's doing it.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

520
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,727
Cut!

521
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:28,929
Moving on.

522
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,364
I think we got it.

523
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,734
Are you ready
for this next bit?

524
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,870
I'm gonna come at you hard, bro.
You better start stretchin'.

525
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,072
Stretch 'em out now.
Stretch 'em out.

526
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,812
Fuck. Ugh.

527
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:53,120
That's what you get.

528
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,455
Dumbass.

529
00:25:56,891 --> 00:25:58,292
How did that feel?

530
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:04,832
I'm gonna kill you,
Billy, you no good,
woman-stealing sack of shit.

531
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:06,667
Hmm?

532
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,636
- Yeah, that's it!
- More pain.

533
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:10,505
- Harder! Harder!
- More pain!

534
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:13,007
Come on, now,
get on up there.

535
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:14,442
Yeah.

536
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:17,144
Yes, yes,
it's great. Yes!

537
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,880
Yeah. Messin' around

538
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,650
- with another man's wife.
- Excellent!

539
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,218
- More struggle.
- There's rules.

540
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:26,253
There are rules to this, Billy.

541
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,989
- You gonna pay the price now.
- More pain!

542
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,459
More pain, it hurts!

543
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:34,595
Nice, huh? That's nice
and tight, huh?

544
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:36,531
Yeah. Now, how that feel?

545
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,966
That's it. Perfect.

546
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:42,504
Can I get you a coffee, sir?

547
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,972
Or did you wanna sit?
Let me get you a chair.

548
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,374
Hey, bud. How you feelin'?

549
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:49,076
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Hey, hey, hey.

550
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:50,711
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

551
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:54,348
You were good.
You were good,
I felt the fear.

552
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:55,550
It was palpable.

553
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:59,687
Yeah, I go half method
these days, yeah.

554
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:00,988
Used to go full method.

555
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:03,157
But, uh, you know,
some people got hurt.

556
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:04,959
Not me.

557
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:07,795
Kinda like Tommy,
you know.

558
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:10,831
Couldn't handle it.

559
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:14,368
Amazing how much
you look like him, huh?

560
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,437
It's like, it's
truly remarkable.

561
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:17,838
It's uncanny.

562
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:19,140
Can I get you guys
some chairs, or--

563
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,941
No, no, no.
We're good.
We're good.

564
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:26,581
Hey, I just want to tell you
that I dig what you're doing.

565
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:32,820
Really, I just think,
like, words are overrated.

566
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,589
You know? They're such
crutches for us as actors.

567
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:37,526
- Can I get you guys
some chairs?
- No. We're standing.

568
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:41,462
You know, Spielberg said
that you should be able
to watch a movie

569
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:42,930
with the sound off if it's...

570
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,534
Hey, guys.
Got those chairs for you--

571
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:47,034
Get 'em outta here.

572
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:52,607
You know, sometimes
I'll go to the movies

573
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:55,042
and I'll plug my ears. Yup.

574
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:58,078
I'll even go the extra mile
and close my eyes too.

575
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:03,552
Yeah. You know, to really
experience something,

576
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:05,920
you have to completely
shut it out.

577
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:10,457
I did that
with my ex-wife too.

578
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,229
Yeah, didn't talk to her
or look at her for a month once.

579
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:18,032
She didn't get it at all.

580
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,636
Hey, I'm throwing
a party tonight.

581
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:24,371
You'll love it. But, uh,
I'll give you a ride.

582
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:27,875
I'm gonna go do some push-ups.
Get jacked for this one. Ah.

583
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:30,778
I got your chair, Mr. Pronto.

584
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:32,446
They're ready
for you, Mr. Pronto.

585
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:45,359
Have some of that.

586
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:48,796
James Dean died
right over there.

587
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:52,499
Terrible tragedy.

588
00:28:53,434 --> 00:28:56,937
Except I got the big brake kit
in this baby. Watch it go.

589
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:01,809
Yeah, motherfucker!

590
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,411
Hold the wheel.
Stay straight,
stay straight.

591
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:07,314
Where the fuck is it?

592
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:15,189
Whoo! Yeah!

593
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,765
What the fuck?

594
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:27,736
That was a fresh
fuckin' drink, douchebag!

595
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,638
Ugh, Christ.
Who the fuck does that?

596
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:31,905
This party sucks.
And this house sucks.

597
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:33,240
Hey, have any of you
seen my boyfriend?

598
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,510
Hello? No one? None of you
have seen Greg?

599
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,778
Awesome. Thanks so much
for nothing.

600
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:39,346
Where is my boyfriend?

601
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:43,784
- Chad, hi.
- Hey.

602
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:46,854
- Your house is so sick.
- Cool.

603
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:49,524
Got a boyfriend?

604
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,593
- No, Mm-mm.
- Nice.

605
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,194
- Hm.
- You good? Have fun.

606
00:29:56,631 --> 00:29:58,566
<i>Great party, huh?</i>

607
00:29:58,667 --> 00:29:59,734
Yes.

608
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,268
You lookin'
for representation?

609
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:04,138
Okay, all right.
I got my eye on you.

610
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:06,807
You ever heard
of Latte Pronto?

611
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:08,208
You will.

612
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,978
Um, yeah, so, like,
I was doing, like, gluten-free,

613
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:14,181
you know what I mean, for like
a year, but that's actually,
like, bullshit,

614
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:16,417
so I pretty much
just switched up and--

615
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:20,120
Like, you know, I'm doing,
like, a raw diet now,

616
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,089
so it's like
back to basics.

617
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:24,858
Like, nothing cooked?

618
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,594
No, no.
It's like total--

619
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:28,395
- It's total, like, caveman style.
-  - Mm-hmm.

620
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,431
Like, you know, like going back
to before they, like, pump food

621
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:32,433
with all these sorts of
chemicals and shit and, like,

622
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:35,102
before everybody, like,
burnt out all, like,
the healthy nutrients in food

623
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:37,338
by, like, cooking everything.

624
00:30:37,438 --> 00:30:40,608
Yeah, but didn't
they die at like 30 years old?

625
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:41,975
That's a common
misconception.

626
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:43,444
That's a common
misconception, like--

627
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:45,780
like, there's a lot of, like,
conflicting data on that.

628
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:46,947
- Like, like...
- Oh.

629
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,484
- Come on, dude.
- Seriously?

630
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,506
Probably learned that
on the streets.

631
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:00,320
Full service,
full stop. I do it all.

632
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:03,323
I get you movies, I get you TV,
I get you talk shows,

633
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:06,493
I get you social media.
I get you all the hits
and all the lights.

634
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:09,396
You know who Latte Pronto is?
Nice stripes.

635
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:51,205
I don't know
why I subject myself

636
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,173
to Chad's dreadful parties.

637
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:56,578
They're full of nothing
but sycophants and philistines.

638
00:32:57,211 --> 00:32:58,780
You're different,
though, Latte.

639
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:01,281
You're not like
most men, are you?

640
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:03,918
You have a secret past.

641
00:33:04,017 --> 00:33:06,788
There's pain in your soul.
I can see it.

642
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:09,824
I was watching you
at the party.

643
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:11,960
You didn't fit in.

644
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,194
I saw you dance
and I loved it.

645
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:17,765
Stay.

646
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:20,835
It reminded me of the tribal
wedding challenge

647
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:23,403
of the ancient Aztec
princess's suitors.

648
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,273
The suitors would all dance
to impress her

649
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,208
and then the winner
would get her hand

650
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:31,144
and then the loser would
get fed to poisonous snakes.

651
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:34,081
You may never be able
to tell me your secrets, but...

652
00:33:34,782 --> 00:33:36,618
maybe I can feel them.

653
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:39,621
Make love to me, Latte.

654
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:44,893
I'm gonna be a huge star!

655
00:33:44,993 --> 00:33:47,027
Gonna be huge.

656
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,001
I wanna be a huge star.

657
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,242
God, that was wonderful.

658
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:07,047
I felt so much... truth.

659
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:10,350
You have a tender heart.
I love that.

660
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:13,287
You can't find that
in a man anymore.

661
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:17,559
Hmm. Can I tell you
a secret of mine?

662
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,295
My real name
isn't Christiana.

663
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:24,464
It's Mildred.

664
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,133
Mildred Lumpshitz.

665
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:29,069
Terrible, right?

666
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:34,241
I think we should
get married.

667
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:40,782
Thank you. Thank you.

668
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:42,316
- Thank you.
- Honey, over here.

669
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,118
- Oh, how wonderful to see you.
- Oh!

670
00:34:45,218 --> 00:34:47,287
Latte Pronto!

671
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:50,592
Oh, this is a huge move
for you, Latte.

672
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:54,261
Very big. Publications
are going nuts with
a capital Z.

673
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:56,864
There's paparazzi everywhere.

674
00:34:56,965 --> 00:34:59,968
<i>All the talk shows,</i>
<i>magazine covers,</i>
<i>whole nine yards.</i>

675
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:03,437
Now, this cluster
of tropical islands

676
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:07,609
is actually made up
of over 500 separate islands.

677
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,944
It really is the ideal
place to honeymoon.

678
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,446
Is it safe to be flying?

679
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:15,415
Oh, uh, no. Normally,
I would never fly in this,

680
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:17,852
but I am such
a big fan of yours.

681
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:20,454
Oh! Oh, fuck.

682
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:23,390
- Oh, my God!
- I said be cool.

683
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,027
- That one, that one.
- That's a very nice choice.

684
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,394
One of my favorites.

685
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:29,162
Oh, I'm gonna engrave
"Publicist",

686
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:30,497
right there along the side.

687
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:32,634
- You're gonna engrave what?
- Publicist.

688
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:35,837
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm very sure.

689
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:37,137
- Fine, it's your money.
- Yes.

690
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:48,650
We're very excited to adopt.

691
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,350
We just-- We have so much

692
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,353
and it's so important to us
to give back.

693
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:56,289
Oh, I wish we could
take them all.

694
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,862
- No.
<i>- Oh, check this out.</i>

695
00:36:00,962 --> 00:36:03,698
Got myself a bracelet.

696
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:05,232
Solid gold, this is.

697
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,300
Yeah, I had "Publicist"
engraved on it and everything.

698
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:10,170
Latte, things are looking up
for us, pal.

699
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,240
Up, up, up. Life is good,
my man. Whoo!

700
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,076
Terrible.

701
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:19,212
What season is it, though?
I'd prefer not to do
any winter stuff, if possible.

702
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:22,817
Honey, let the nannies.

703
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:26,420
"Christiana and the late
Sir Bingsley is palpable,

704
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:29,356
but it is not until the role
is taken over by Mr. Pronto

705
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:32,325
that the pair truly
becomes electric.

706
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,327
Latte is often seen looking
directly into lens..."

707
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:38,533
"Christiana also appears
at moments to be breaking
the fourth wall as well.

708
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:42,070
Perhaps this is the most
powerful moment of all,

709
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,838
husband and wife
torn apart on film

710
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:47,207
and brought together in life
looking to us and saying..."

711
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:50,210
"Feel our connection."
This is huge, pal.

712
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,047
Plus the kids? Great move,
man. We are killing it.

713
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:55,415
But I said,
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

714
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:57,185
I don't think I'm gonna fit
in your shoes."

715
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:03,524
- Oh, yeah.
-  - You wouldn't fit in his shoes.

716
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,127
Okay, let's-- let's give him
a warm welcome.

717
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:09,296
Ladies and gentlemen,
Latte Pronto.

718
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:13,568
- I think he's stuck.
- He might, he might be.

719
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:15,870
Come on. Over here.

720
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,039
- You might need to do
some fishing.
- Should I reel him in?

721
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,841
- Yeah.
- Should I get him in there?

722
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:21,909
Hey, oh!

723
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,847
He's going
the wrong way.

724
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:30,484
- Oh, there we go.
There we go.
- There we go.

725
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:31,686
- It's slow going.
- He's here.

726
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,654
It's slow going.

727
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:36,657
- I'll get the net.
- Come on. Get the net.

728
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:38,526
He's gonna get the net.

729
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:40,360
I'll cut the line,
I'll cut the line.

730
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:42,096
- Go!
- Snip!

731
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:43,263
There we go.

732
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:47,235
Oh! Latte.

733
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:49,237
Latte, tell me, man,

734
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:51,706
you have got a big film
premiere tomorrow night.

735
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:53,875
You gotta dress
to the nines, do it all up.

736
00:37:53,975 --> 00:37:57,044
Tell me something, buddy.
Does that make you
a little nervous?

737
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:23,403
Latte, what are you wearing?

738
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,039
And, Latte, what is
your wife wearing?

739
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:28,375
And, Latte, I saw an early
screening of the movie, Latte,

740
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:29,577
and I don't wanna give
anything away,

741
00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:31,411
but I do have
one burning question.

742
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:32,847
What are you wearing?

743
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,182
Actually, um,

744
00:38:34,282 --> 00:38:35,850
I'd like to tell you
what I'm wearing.

745
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:45,560
Congrats, you two.
It's a big night. Big night.

746
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,327
- You look beautiful.
- I'm thrilled.

747
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:49,429
This is just fantastic.

748
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,266
- Do I know you?
- Oh, "Do I know you?"

749
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,540
Whoo!

750
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:02,009
Whoo!

751
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:14,121
Now, why is it
when most folks see me,

752
00:39:14,222 --> 00:39:16,356
they just see
some funny little kid?

753
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:18,726
Man, I never understand that.

754
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:21,128
I mean, hell, I don't know.

755
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:24,565
I guess people just see
what they wanna see, don't they?

756
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,901
Don't bother me none.

757
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:30,071
I don't pay no never mind.

758
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:35,543
Because you know what I see
when I see them?

759
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:39,113
Dead people.

760
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:44,185
Oh, wow.

761
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:46,453
My name's Billy!
Billy the Kid!

762
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:58,599
Fantastic stuff.
Really great work.
And from what I'm hearing,

763
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:00,334
- you were
the audience's favorite.
- Really? Really?

764
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:01,869
- I sensed it was good. Yeah.
- Oh.

765
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:04,471
- Yeah, I wanna hear specifics.
- Oh, tons of specifics.

766
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:06,707
Oh, my gosh.
I got a whole list
from the test...

767
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:09,644
Amazing. Tony, the way
you have them look
into the camera?

768
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:12,380
- Oh, thank you.
- Ah, don't you try
to take credit for that.

769
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:13,648
It was my idea. Thanks.

770
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:15,383
Christiana, it's so good.
You look amazing.

771
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,051
- Look at you. Oh.
- Oh, are you sure?

772
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:18,786
- I feel like my eyes
are looking old.
- No, very young eyes.

773
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:21,522
- Very young eyes.
- Mark? You have
an eye lift guy, right?

774
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:22,657
Oh, the best.

775
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:24,424
His work is just so natural.

776
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:25,526
Like, look at me...

777
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:28,195
Latte, oh, my God.

778
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:30,231
You are testing
through the roof.

779
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:31,532
People loved you.

780
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:33,000
You got in there
at the sweet spot

781
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,602
and you scored big.

782
00:40:34,702 --> 00:40:36,404
I hate to say it,
you won this thing, pal.

783
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,005
We have so many things
planned for you.

784
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:39,373
- Things are already...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

785
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:40,608
Who the hell are you?

786
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:42,043
Oh, I'm his junior agent.

787
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:43,577
Junior agent?

788
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:44,812
Yeah, pretty much
senior agent,

789
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:46,681
but junior right now
as a placeholder.

790
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:48,683
So, where's his senior agent?

791
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:50,184
Oh, she's with all
the top guys.

792
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:51,285
You should not go
over there.

793
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:52,620
Wait, Latte's a top guy.

794
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,322
Of course he's a top guy.

795
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:55,656
No, I'm not saying
he's not a top guy.

796
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:57,024
Wait, you're saying
he's not a top guy?

797
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:58,793
- No. No.
- Latte, that's not something

798
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:00,194
- you should stand for.
- Latte, that's not
what I'm saying,

799
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:01,494
- No, no, no. You're a top guy.
- You're a top guy.

800
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:02,730
He's putting words--
Excuse me.

801
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,098
Can you excuse us
for a second?

802
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,866
Yeah, absolutely,
I'm making a laugh, anyways.

803
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,335
Wow. Oh, my God,

804
00:41:07,435 --> 00:41:09,603
the nerve of that guy.
It starts with this.

805
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:11,739
They get the junior agent,
they sink their claws on you

806
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,473
and they try to steal you
away from me

807
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,876
and then they dump
the whole team
starting with me.

808
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:17,912
- I am not replaceable.
- Excuse me.

809
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:19,714
- Is there a problem here, sir?
- I am not replaceable.

810
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:21,415
- Sir, calm down.
- I am not replaceable.

811
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:23,117
- I need you to calm down.
- Latte, I need
to hear you say it.

812
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:24,986
- Sir, if you can't calm down...
- Say you won't leave me.

813
00:41:25,086 --> 00:41:26,921
- ...I'm gonna have to ask you--
- Sir, don't talk to me
right now.

814
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:28,556
- This is a private
conversation.
- Calm down right now,

815
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:29,757
- or I'm taking you out of here.
- I'm his publicist,

816
00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:31,158
- he's the star of the movie.
- Okay,

817
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:32,492
you're out. You're done--

818
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:34,095
Stop it, no, I'm not leaving.

819
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:35,596
You're done here, let's go.

820
00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:37,198
- Get your hands off of me.
- Can I get some back up?

821
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:39,300
I'm gonna get you kicked out.
Get your hands off of me!

822
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,169
No, I'm a somebody.
I'm a somebody!

823
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:45,439
I'm a somebody!
I'm a somebody!

824
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:47,875
I'm a somebody,
I'm not a nobody.

825
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:50,177
I'm a somebody.

826
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:52,113
I'm a somebody!

827
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:54,448
No! No!

828
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:56,417
I'm a somebody!

829
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:58,953
I'm a somebody!

830
00:41:59,053 --> 00:42:02,189
No! I'm a somebody!

831
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:07,762
Well, I don't know
what that episode was, Latte.

832
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:11,665
It was so selfish of you
to do that on my big night.

833
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:13,868
You caused quite the disruption.

834
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:18,205
I can't have
negative press, you know?

835
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:20,574
Nations full
of decrepit children

836
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:23,244
depend on my pristine image.

837
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,380
I want you to see my shaman.

838
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:29,750
She does anger management
through spiritual journeying.

839
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,986
She'll put you
on a heavy herbal regiment

840
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:34,055
and clean out
some of your toxins.

841
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:36,525
You're full of toxins.

842
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:39,593
And there's
a raw food diet

843
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:41,796
that cleanse some
of your negative energy

844
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:44,999
and just general
bad attitude.

845
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:52,239
Sorry about last night.

846
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,575
Oh, I can't believe
he didn't know who we were.

847
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:56,577
What a jerk.

848
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:57,812
Man, is he gonna eat crow

849
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:59,847
when my name
is in lights one day.

850
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:04,351
Thank God I'm a nice guy.

851
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,587
Thank God.

852
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:09,423
Ah.

853
00:43:09,524 --> 00:43:10,925
Okay, some good news
and some bad news.

854
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:13,594
Good news first.
Did you ever hear of Lex Tanner?

855
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:16,363
- Oh!
- Okay, I'll fill you in.

856
00:43:16,464 --> 00:43:18,265
<i>Fast Racer, Fast Racer 2,</i>

857
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:21,435
- <i>Fast Racer Shanghai.</i>
- All classics.

858
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:23,237
Okay, Latte. Cheer up, buddy.

859
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:26,640
This guy is the best in the biz,
and he's gonna be directing
<i>Mosquito Man.</i>

860
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,776
Or is it <i>Mosquito Boy?</i>
Doesn't matter.

861
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:30,411
It's one of the lesser-known
comics, really.

862
00:43:30,512 --> 00:43:32,913
But the point is, they're
thinking if the movie hits,

863
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,815
they can add the character
to the Quester movies

864
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,250
and he wants you, bud.

865
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,918
Oh!

866
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:39,820
I'm sending you
to meet him at his home
in Bel Air.

867
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,021
- This is huge.
- Ee! Ah!

868
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:42,857
You score in this
and home run, pal.

869
00:43:42,957 --> 00:43:44,859
- Game, set, match.
- Latte Pronto,
you are killing it.

870
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,727
- Could you just please let me--
- Sorry.

871
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:48,195
You're killing it, pal.

872
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:52,833
Right, the bad news.

873
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:55,035
Apparently that security guard
you punched is suing you.

874
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:57,171
I guess you tweaked
his neck or something.

875
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,156
This is the place,
Mr. Pronto.

876
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,324
Go ahead and hop on out.

877
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:26,700
They told me I'm not allowed
to stay, Mr. Pronto.

878
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:48,455
Greetings. Welcome
to Lex Tanner's humble abode.

879
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:51,825
Please remove your shoes
and come inside.

880
00:44:57,264 --> 00:45:00,201
Lex is known for his
great charitable deeds.

881
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:04,338
And his awesome
heroin connection.

882
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:09,843
He discovered me
at an Arby's.

883
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:17,418
Uh, the tiles
are a little hot.

884
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:23,257
Have a seat. Lex will
see you in a moment.

885
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:16,745
Hey!

886
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:20,014
Latte Pronto.
Oh, shit, my man.

887
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:22,216
Go ahead, take a seat.

888
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,953
Ah! Sorry to keep you
waiting like that, dude.

889
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:29,290
Was dealing with some, uh,
bank stuff, you know, just...

890
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:31,292
Anyway. Hey...

891
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:33,794
Maria! Sun!

892
00:46:34,562 --> 00:46:36,797
- Yes?
- Sun!

893
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:38,700
- What?
- Sun!

894
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,167
Okay!

895
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:42,936
There you go.

896
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:44,171
Dude, I can't believe
you're here, man.

897
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,640
Thanks so much for coming by.

898
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,907
Huge fan. Huge fan.

899
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,242
I love the shit
you've been doing, man.

900
00:46:48,342 --> 00:46:49,644
Breaking the fourth wall
and everything,

901
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:51,045
and it-- it got me thinking,

902
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:52,647
got the old wheels turning,

903
00:46:52,747 --> 00:46:54,381
that, you know,
you look into the camera

904
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,217
with two eyes and the audience
just, you know, they love it.

905
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:00,821
They love it, right? So, what if
you had a thousand eyes?

906
00:47:01,756 --> 00:47:04,892
'Cause mosquitoes got a shit ton
of eyes, you know that, right?

907
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:07,227
I mean, can you imagine
the audience's reaction

908
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:09,798
if you locked all those
fuckin' eyes on 'em?

909
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:12,032
I mean, it'd be crazy.

910
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:14,501
Their brains would explode
inside of their skulls.

911
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:16,538
It would just be like
a fuckin' lava lamp in there

912
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:17,938
when they get MRIs.

913
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:20,007
Yeah. Hey, come on.
Lemme show you the house, right?

914
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:22,042
Maria, espressos!

915
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:24,512
Oh.

916
00:47:24,612 --> 00:47:27,549
So if you have any questions,
please, fire away.

917
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:31,553
Yeah, and all this wood is real,
you know, I think so.

918
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:34,188
Oh, here, here we go.
This is it. This,
this right here?

919
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:36,256
This was a gift
from Prince Harry.

920
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:37,858
Uh, I think
it was Prince Harry.

921
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,761
The, you know,
the ginger one.

922
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,196
Yeah, it, uh-- it was
one of the original

923
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:44,498
<i>Knights of the Round Table</i>
sword or somethin'.

924
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:46,266
Can't really remember,
'cause I wasn't listening

925
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:48,135
when he gave it to me,
but, uh, yeah.

926
00:47:48,235 --> 00:47:50,371
No, it's, uh, like one
of three in the world.

927
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:52,973
A lot of the art
in this joint is very rare.

928
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:54,776
All has a story behind it.

929
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:58,112
Uh, I mean, you could literally
take all day talking about it.

930
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:00,749
The house was built
by Orson Welles.

931
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:03,417
I had to redo most of it though.
The guy had terrible taste.

932
00:48:03,518 --> 00:48:05,419
Olivia Newton-John lived here
for a short time too.

933
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,221
She put in the disco room.
Oh, dude,

934
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:09,724
I had the craziest
Russian chicks in here
the other day.

935
00:48:09,824 --> 00:48:12,627
I mean, just insane.
Yeah, I mean,
Russians know how to party.

936
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:15,162
It's 'cause of all that snow
they got over there,
you know that, right?

937
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:17,898
Makes people insane.
Yeah, Russians love me.

938
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:19,333
Putin actually asked me
to be best man

939
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:20,934
at one of his
karate tournaments.

940
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,302
Whatever that means.

941
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:23,638
I actually couldn't do it.
Here, check it out.

942
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:29,611
Wanna go ahead,
take a deep breath, relax.

943
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:33,914
<i>Namaste.</i>

944
00:48:34,783 --> 00:48:36,684
<i>Focus your eyes on mine.</i>

945
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:38,653
<i>Three...</i>

946
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:40,522
<i>Two...</i>

947
00:48:40,622 --> 00:48:41,723
<i>One.</i>

948
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:45,392
There you go.

949
00:48:47,896 --> 00:48:50,598
I'm creating a book
of celebrity photos.

950
00:48:53,568 --> 00:48:56,336
You know, I feel like
the mosquito
isn't appreciated by people

951
00:48:56,437 --> 00:48:58,338
because of the itchiness
of the bite.

952
00:48:58,439 --> 00:49:00,974
You know? But you gotta
respect 'em, man.

953
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:02,309
I mean, they can fly around

954
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:04,445
with a tremendous amount
of blood in their noses,

955
00:49:04,546 --> 00:49:07,347
which is much more than
I can say for you or me.

956
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:09,784
Hey, Maria!

957
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:12,186
Maria?

958
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:14,121
Yeah?

959
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:16,089
- Which belt?
- They're the same, yeah?

960
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,991
- Belt?
- Yeah.

961
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:20,260
- Which belt?
- Both?

962
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,995
Hmm, all right.
I'll try it, yeah.

963
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,466
Okay, I gotta get
to the bank. Maria.

964
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,535
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

965
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:28,937
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

966
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:31,104
Shoo, shoo, shoo,
shoo, shoo, shoo.

967
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:33,741
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.

968
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:37,110
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo,
shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo...

969
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,614
Hop in, Mr. Pronto.
They want us out of here.

970
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:57,699
Latte.

971
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:01,736
I'm going to the south
of France for a few days.

972
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:03,972
I've been invited
by Louis Ver,

973
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:06,741
the handbag designer,
to stay at his villa,

974
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:08,375
and I'm taking
the children.

975
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,144
I just think we need
a little breather,

976
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:14,649
given your rage episodes
and this whole lawsuit thing.

977
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,417
The shaman is out back
waiting for you.

978
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:26,995
Look at me.
Don't look at me.

979
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:29,964
Look at me.
Don't look at me, ha!

980
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:33,568
Look at me in the face.
Don't look away.

981
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:34,636
Do look at me.

982
00:50:34,736 --> 00:50:37,471
Beige banana.

983
00:50:37,572 --> 00:50:39,641
Beige banana.

984
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:43,578
Do you have any bananas?

985
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:44,913
I'm hungry.

986
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:49,984
Good, we're done.

987
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,351
I really do apologize

988
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:54,154
for getting a little bit
of wax in your eyeball.

989
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:58,993
So, today's session
will be 6,000 dollars,

990
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:01,461
and, uh, for check
writing purposes,

991
00:51:01,563 --> 00:51:03,397
I know I told you my name
is Mountain Bride,

992
00:51:03,497 --> 00:51:06,634
but, uh, if you could
make it out to Shelley Gube.

993
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:09,037
We are mosquito people now.

994
00:51:09,136 --> 00:51:10,872
- We sure are.
- Isn't that right, Latte?

995
00:51:10,972 --> 00:51:12,840
My psychic said
it was gonna happen.

996
00:51:12,941 --> 00:51:14,241
I knew we were gonna
work together again.

997
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:15,442
- We are so excited.
- Have you been working out?

998
00:51:15,543 --> 00:51:17,045
We're so excited.
You look so good.

999
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:18,513
You do, it looks like
you've been in the sun.

1000
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:20,314
- Have you gotten sun?
You've gotten sun.
- Yeah.

1001
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:22,482
I feel like--
have you been using that--

1002
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:24,519
- Which line?
- Hey, boss?

1003
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:26,554
I know you're waiting
on number one
to jump out of HMU,

1004
00:51:26,654 --> 00:51:29,691
but I want you to know
that FX is all set
and ready to pop, okay?

1005
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,959
What the hell is this?

1006
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:34,261
This is your tennis ball
cannon, okay? We're set,
we're ready to go.

1007
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:35,630
I got your speed,
I got your violence,

1008
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,532
I got your velocity,
I got all you can handle.

1009
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:39,033
Okay, I thought it was
gonna be like a--

1010
00:51:39,132 --> 00:51:40,935
Like a handheld thing
so you can--

1011
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:42,369
That's-- that's not
what I was told.

1012
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:44,204
Talk to your production
designer. Watch your face.

1013
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:46,941
But we're gonna be over here.
I'm on 13. You tell me
anything you need.

1014
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,009
- All right?
- Excellent. Thank you.

1015
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,476
You look great in that hat.

1016
00:51:50,477 --> 00:51:51,579
Thank you.

1017
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:56,483
Oh, um...
Ugh, this is Victor.

1018
00:51:56,584 --> 00:51:58,553
He specializes
in monster makeup.

1019
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:00,487
He'll be applying
your mosquito prosthetics,

1020
00:52:00,588 --> 00:52:02,624
- so good luck with that.
-  - Just hold your breath.

1021
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:04,124
- Wow.
- Hold your breath.

1022
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:05,593
You look like
the Mosquito already.

1023
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:08,529
It's almost on
your face. Just count to three.

1024
00:52:20,742 --> 00:52:21,709
Oh!

1025
00:52:26,981 --> 00:52:28,716
Okay, let's do this.

1026
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:31,251
Okay, so, uh,
here's the action.

1027
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:32,920
You got tennis ball one.

1028
00:52:33,021 --> 00:52:34,221
That's gonna be Crow Man.

1029
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:35,723
All right?
Crow Man comes at you.

1030
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:37,025
Ah! You duck.

1031
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,425
Tennis balls two and three,

1032
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:41,361
those are blasts
from his bug spray cannons.

1033
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:43,497
All right, they hit you.
Okay, then I need a, you know,

1034
00:52:43,598 --> 00:52:46,034
"Oh, shit, I'm down. Crow Man's
gonna eat me," kind of face.

1035
00:52:46,134 --> 00:52:47,835
And that's when you do your
eye thing right to the camera.

1036
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:49,604
You ready? Here we go, folks.

1037
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:51,539
And playtime.

1038
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:55,710
Okay, let's-- let's do it again.

1039
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,912
Again, you gotta duck.
All right, buddy?

1040
00:52:58,012 --> 00:53:01,314
Just don't let it hit you.
Just, you know, avoid it.

1041
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:04,217
- Gotta get down, big time.
- No, that's all right.

1042
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:05,720
I got it, I'll direct him,
if you don't mind.

1043
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,855
All right, this one's coming
real quick, real quick,

1044
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:10,424
so get ready to duck.
All right, ready and playtime.

1045
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:13,427
Playtime!

1046
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:15,228
And playtime!

1047
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:17,330
All right, now you hit him.

1048
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:19,767
More, more juice.
Come on, hit him harder!

1049
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:21,268
More speed. Faster, faster!

1050
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:22,537
You're likin' it now.
Right, tell your talent

1051
00:53:22,637 --> 00:53:23,971
- to slow down a little bit.
- Playtime!

1052
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,943
Ugh! Cut! Nose came off, Victor.

1053
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,148
You're like
cool-going.

1054
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:35,616
You look so good.

1055
00:53:35,717 --> 00:53:37,018
Okay, okay.

1056
00:53:37,118 --> 00:53:38,218
This is gonna get really bad.

1057
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:40,387
Oh, God.

1058
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:42,355
Ooh!

1059
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:43,858
All right, Latte,
here's the deal.

1060
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:45,258
We're gonna help you out
with the choreography now, okay?

1061
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:47,028
So, uh, let's get ready.

1062
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:52,133
Here we come.

1063
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:53,968
And playtime.

1064
00:53:58,338 --> 00:54:01,609
And playtime. More speed.
Come on. Beautiful!

1065
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:06,214
And cut!

1066
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:08,415
All right, that's a wrap
for today, everyone.

1067
00:54:16,991 --> 00:54:18,726
Latte. Energy drink?

1068
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:24,031
Nope? Good news, bud.
I got you into the <i>Sexism</i>
magazine party.

1069
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:26,834
I think that's what it's called.
Sounds wrong now that
I'm saying out loud.

1070
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:29,837
Anyway, big-time publication,
classy stuff,

1071
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:32,206
and I'm pushing to get you
on the cover, but it's tough.

1072
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:34,108
They normally go
for a monster set of cans.

1073
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,610
Okay, we gotta roll, hmm?

1074
00:54:36,611 --> 00:54:37,578
Oh.

1075
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,380
Let's go.

1076
00:55:58,059 --> 00:55:59,694
Oh.

1077
00:55:59,794 --> 00:56:01,394
Oh, shit.

1078
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,399
I just pissed on a rat.

1079
00:56:07,535 --> 00:56:10,972
Oh, man, I love it
down here.

1080
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:12,807
I can just see the air.

1081
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:19,379
Parties, man,
they're so cliché.

1082
00:56:20,982 --> 00:56:22,049
Like words.

1083
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:24,585
You want some?

1084
00:56:29,323 --> 00:56:31,491
Yeah, it's real
small batch stuff.

1085
00:56:33,995 --> 00:56:35,997
Yeah, I made it myself.

1086
00:56:36,097 --> 00:56:37,899
I'm into that, yeah.

1087
00:56:38,532 --> 00:56:40,935
Sustainable
indoor farming.

1088
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:43,638
Oh, and gold.

1089
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:46,607
Yeah, I got pockets
full of it, yeah.

1090
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:48,976
Want some?

1091
00:56:49,944 --> 00:56:50,778
Yeah, here.

1092
00:56:51,345 --> 00:56:55,349
Yeah, I make rings
and bottle openers
and whatever, yeah.

1093
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:57,551
Keep it, keep it.
That one's, uh...

1094
00:56:58,286 --> 00:56:59,620
That one's, uh...

1095
00:57:01,689 --> 00:57:03,324
I think that one's
a paperweight, I think. Yeah.

1096
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:05,793
Chad,
Latte! Over here!

1097
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:09,163
These fuckin'
guys. Hey, man.

1098
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:10,631
Hey, man,
you think I'm some--

1099
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:12,533
You think I'm some
animal in the zoo

1100
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:13,968
you could just take
a picture of?

1101
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:15,336
- Easy!
- Huh? Is that what you think?

1102
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:16,771
- Get off me, man. I'll sue.
- Huh?

1103
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:18,272
- What am I, just a cow
in the zoo...
- Get off me!

1104
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:19,472
...you can take a picture of?

1105
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:20,975
- Moo!
- Get off me, man. Get off me.

1106
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:22,677
Moo!

1107
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:24,011
Moo!

1108
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,246
Moo!

1109
00:57:28,716 --> 00:57:30,184
Okay,
now face your right.

1110
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:32,286
Nope, sir, face the camera.

1111
00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:34,221
Nope, sir, we're not done.

1112
00:57:45,399 --> 00:57:47,001
Look, I'm not mad at you.

1113
00:57:47,868 --> 00:57:48,903
I get it.

1114
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:52,940
You gotta let off some stream.

1115
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:55,309
You know, sow your wild oats.

1116
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:57,578
But do not blow this for me!

1117
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,014
I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you.

1118
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:01,415
No, look, I'm your guy.

1119
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:03,517
I got your back no matter what.

1120
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:05,820
No matter what.

1121
00:58:07,188 --> 00:58:08,589
I'm always on your side.

1122
00:58:13,027 --> 00:58:16,330
So, Latte, what are you,
big time now? You a hotshot?

1123
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,965
- Don't be a hotshot.
- Shh.

1124
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:20,500
I-- I don't wanna deal
with your macho shenanigans.

1125
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:23,137
Listen to me.
These outbursts,
they gotta stop.

1126
00:58:23,237 --> 00:58:24,438
- They gotta stop.
- Shut up.

1127
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,040
The head of the studio,
he's coming down here

1128
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,708
right now
to chew you out.

1129
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:29,510
- This is a problem.
- This isn't good, Latte.

1130
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,078
Just stop it.
This is not good.

1131
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:32,813
They are mumbling
about replacing you.

1132
00:58:32,913 --> 00:58:35,883
- Are mumbling about
replacing you--
- Just shut up!

1133
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:36,951
You!

1134
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:39,286
Now you listen here, you...

1135
00:58:39,387 --> 00:58:40,654
Latte.

1136
00:58:40,755 --> 00:58:43,157
All right, we can't be missing
shoot days on...

1137
00:58:44,325 --> 00:58:45,860
...the <i>Mosquito Man</i> because...

1138
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,896
...Boy, <i>Mosquito Boy</i> .

1139
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:52,600
I mean, we've already spent,
uh, two million...

1140
00:58:53,401 --> 00:58:54,702
Two million...

1141
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:56,203
Two hundred million

1142
00:58:56,303 --> 00:58:57,705
fuckin' dollars!

1143
00:58:57,805 --> 00:59:00,141
And I'm not gonna spend
one more cent on your dumbass

1144
00:59:00,241 --> 00:59:02,009
macho bullshit, understand?

1145
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:06,380
What?

1146
00:59:07,948 --> 00:59:09,550
Well, where's the fuckin' actor?

1147
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,886
Right.

1148
00:59:13,522 --> 00:59:15,156
So don't just, you know,
don't, don't--

1149
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:18,192
Right, don't waste
our fuckin' money!

1150
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:30,704
Hey, uh, Mr. Pronto,

1151
00:59:30,805 --> 00:59:33,542
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

1152
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:35,342
- I'm-- I'm your stand-in.
- Ah.

1153
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:39,580
I stand on, you know, your marks
while they light the scenes.

1154
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:42,216
It's a huge honor to meet you.

1155
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:46,487
I really respect all--
all you, every--

1156
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:48,155
your whole story of how
you made it, honestly.

1157
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,457
Thank you, thank you.

1158
00:59:50,124 --> 00:59:52,259
- You're a real
inspiration to me.
- Yeah.

1159
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:56,897
- It's so cool to be...
- Okay.

1160
00:59:56,997 --> 00:59:59,733
- ...in an elevator with you.
- Yeah. We get it.

1161
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:02,203
I'm just so impressed
with your talent

1162
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:03,538
and I respect the fights
you get in and stuff,

1163
01:00:03,637 --> 01:00:04,638
- but I--
- Will you get away?

1164
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:05,840
- Yes, sir, sorry.
- Geez.

1165
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,308
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

1166
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:09,343
Good to have you back.

1167
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:11,078
Excuse me.
Hey, uh, look,

1168
01:00:11,178 --> 01:00:13,080
I just wanna talk you through
the stunt we're doing today,

1169
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,483
and then I'll get you
through hair and makeup
and all that shit, okay?

1170
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:17,051
- Good plan.
- Hey, shut up, please.

1171
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:18,553
Thank you. All right,
come with me.

1172
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:20,020
Okay, so, here's the scene.

1173
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:21,789
You get chased up
to this rooftop, right,

1174
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:23,491
by, uh, Crow Man's
henchman, right,

1175
01:00:23,592 --> 01:00:24,792
because you got
the secret blood formula.

1176
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:26,160
And it's inside your nose

1177
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,862
or whatever the fuck,
I don't know. But anyway,

1178
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:29,930
you've been backed into
this corner right here, right?

1179
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:32,333
And-- no way out.
What's gonna happen?

1180
01:00:32,433 --> 01:00:35,537
For the first time,
this is when you sprout
your wings,

1181
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:37,805
you jump and then you fly.

1182
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,710
Right? Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, don't worry.

1183
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,513
Don't worry, no stress, okay?
It's easy. All right?

1184
01:00:44,613 --> 01:00:47,848
All you gotta do is just go over
and let gravity do the rest.

1185
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:50,084
Latte, all the top guys
do their own stunts.

1186
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:51,852
- Mm-hmm. Will you
fuck off, please?
- Okay.

1187
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:54,054
Yeah, thank you.
All right, here, listen.
This stuff is easy.

1188
01:00:54,155 --> 01:00:56,390
You know what?
We'll rehearse one.
You'll get a feel for it.

1189
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:57,725
Hey, are my henchmen ready?

1190
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:00,895
Okay, so, all right,
here we go. And playtime!

1191
01:01:24,785 --> 01:01:26,921
There he is.

1192
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:28,856
You're lucky to be alive.

1193
01:01:30,457 --> 01:01:32,026
Energy drink?

1194
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,029
No? Okay.

1195
01:01:35,129 --> 01:01:38,365
There's someone here
who wants to see you.

1196
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:43,837
Latte, I can't actually see you.

1197
01:01:43,938 --> 01:01:45,574
I've had a little work done

1198
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:47,074
and I have to wear
these bandages

1199
01:01:47,174 --> 01:01:49,076
for another week or so, but...

1200
01:01:49,176 --> 01:01:51,312
I understand you're
in terrible shape.

1201
01:01:51,412 --> 01:01:54,048
Well, I'm glad you're alive,
I really, truly am,

1202
01:01:54,148 --> 01:01:58,085
but I can't take these wild
emotional swings anymore.

1203
01:01:58,185 --> 01:02:00,788
You're getting arrested
and then the lawsuits,

1204
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:02,657
and now this attempt
on your own life.

1205
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:05,226
Well...

1206
01:02:05,326 --> 01:02:07,895
There's no easy way
to say it, but...

1207
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:10,431
we're getting divorced.

1208
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:14,235
I'm with Chad now.

1209
01:02:15,637 --> 01:02:17,871
- Where is he?
- I'm over here.

1210
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:23,010
Sorry, bro.

1211
01:02:23,844 --> 01:02:25,012
Take care, Latte.

1212
01:02:25,112 --> 01:02:26,747
Oh...

1213
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:36,257
Bummer.

1214
01:02:37,726 --> 01:02:39,026
Well, look on the bright side.

1215
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:41,262
They finished the film
with your stand-in

1216
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:42,329
and word on the street,

1217
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,398
and I don't want you
to get too excited,

1218
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:48,302
is that it's the best movie
in the history of filmmaking.

1219
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:50,672
"One of the worst movies

1220
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:52,840
in the history of filmmaking"?

1221
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,309
"Latte Pronto's old tricks
of breaking the fourth wall

1222
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:58,312
grow older than
a fossilized mosquito.

1223
01:02:58,412 --> 01:03:00,715
In this he sucks
more than just blood."

1224
01:03:00,814 --> 01:03:02,283
Okay, guys,
let's keep it going, huh?

1225
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:05,052
I got you a second truck so it
wouldn't take forever. Let's go.

1226
01:03:05,152 --> 01:03:06,820
What the hell's
going on here?

1227
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:08,889
- What are you doing?
What is that?
- Oh.

1228
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,057
What's going on here, guys?

1229
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:12,059
Hey, Latte, how you doin'?

1230
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:14,094
Remember me?
I'm your business manager.

1231
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:15,929
Yeah, a little bit
of bad news.

1232
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:19,701
Uh, it looks like between
the shamans, the divorce,

1233
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,536
and your expensive lifestyle
in general,

1234
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:23,804
you-- you don't have any monies.

1235
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:25,540
Isn't it your job
to make him money?

1236
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,542
You from the IRS?

1237
01:03:27,642 --> 01:03:28,942
No, I'm an intern.

1238
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:30,612
Oh, well, then the answer is no,

1239
01:03:30,712 --> 01:03:32,046
it's my job to make me money.

1240
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:34,616
That's what a job is.

1241
01:03:34,716 --> 01:03:36,551
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1242
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:38,720
Do you need an intern?

1243
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:39,953
I can't pay you.

1244
01:03:40,054 --> 01:03:41,589
Legally you'd have to.

1245
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:42,791
Well, no, there's
ways around that.

1246
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:44,693
You got a lot to learn, kid.

1247
01:03:44,793 --> 01:03:46,060
You want the job or what, eh?

1248
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,028
- Sure.
- Ah, good move.

1249
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:50,197
You're gonna do
very well in this town.

1250
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:52,701
Now, go get me a coffee
and keep the receipt, okay?

1251
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:53,834
Oh, no problem.

1252
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:55,369
Take care, Mr. Pronto.

1253
01:03:58,038 --> 01:04:01,743
Latte, things turn around
for you, you gimme a call, okay?

1254
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:03,210
I'm your guy.

1255
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,945
I think it's time
we popped in on your agent

1256
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:07,114
and let her know you're ready
to get back in the game.

1257
01:04:07,214 --> 01:04:08,849
And there's nothing to panic
about here, pal.

1258
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:12,119
You're still an A-list guy,
so let's keep
our heads up, right?

1259
01:04:12,219 --> 01:04:15,623
Hi, I'm here with Latte Pronto
to see his agent.

1260
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:17,792
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's in a meeting.

1261
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:19,126
We can wait.

1262
01:04:19,226 --> 01:04:21,495
Well, she has a lot
of meetings today.

1263
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:24,465
How can you-- How do you know?
What is-- You know what?

1264
01:04:24,566 --> 01:04:28,268
You can't do this.
I'm here with Latte Pronto.

1265
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:29,870
- Uh-huh?
- Do you know who he is?

1266
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,905
He's an A-list guy.

1267
01:04:32,005 --> 01:04:34,676
- Uh-huh, right.
- No, he's an--

1268
01:04:34,776 --> 01:04:37,244
- He's an A-list guy!
- Right.

1269
01:04:37,344 --> 01:04:39,346
You can't do this,
and you know what?

1270
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:42,550
I need to talk to your--
No, I don't-- We're going in.

1271
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,452
Hey, you can't go back there!

1272
01:04:45,553 --> 01:04:47,488
What the hell is going on?

1273
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:51,593
This some kind of power play?
Latte Pronto is an A-list guy.

1274
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:53,460
He's an A-list
and he wants to work,

1275
01:04:53,561 --> 01:04:56,698
so let's get cracking--
Wait, what is this?

1276
01:04:56,798 --> 01:04:58,733
Look, I would love
to help you guys,

1277
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,501
but between the fighting
and the ODs,

1278
01:05:00,602 --> 01:05:03,137
and most importantly,
the bad movie,
the phone's just not ringing.

1279
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:05,272
What-- You put him
in that movie.

1280
01:05:05,372 --> 01:05:09,977
What do you want me to say?
The phone... is not... ringing.

1281
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:11,546
What the--

1282
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:13,581
Well, then call somebody.

1283
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:16,183
Look, why don't you just lay low
for a little while?

1284
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:17,451
I'll call you
if something comes up.

1285
01:05:17,552 --> 01:05:19,153
Right now, there's just
nothing happening.

1286
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:21,288
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

1287
01:05:21,388 --> 01:05:23,290
You remember
your stand-in, right?

1288
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:26,393
Is this has-been
gonna take up all my time?

1289
01:05:26,493 --> 01:05:29,329
Get the hell outta here, man.
You make me sick.

1290
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:32,366
You make me sick!
You're why <i>Mosquito Boy</i> sucked.

1291
01:05:32,466 --> 01:05:35,035
You know what?
We don't need you guys.

1292
01:05:35,135 --> 01:05:37,672
I'll get Latte a gig myself.
You're fired!

1293
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:06,266
Come this way.

1294
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:08,101
Just down here.

1295
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:20,715
This one's mine.

1296
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,355
I'm sorry, this place
is a bit of a mess.

1297
01:06:28,455 --> 01:06:31,191
Just all about work these days.

1298
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:39,801
Also, if I'm being
completely honest, I...

1299
01:06:39,901 --> 01:06:41,301
I haven't made much money.

1300
01:06:43,103 --> 01:06:44,739
You're my first real client.

1301
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,476
I'm from a small town
in Northern Canada.

1302
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,850
I don't really have
anyone back there.

1303
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,184
Or here, for that matter.

1304
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,094
Except you.

1305
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:14,067
I'm so grateful to you.

1306
01:07:15,003 --> 01:07:17,739
You have no idea.

1307
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:22,911
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

1308
01:07:23,011 --> 01:07:25,279
Let me finish.

1309
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:29,416
Don't worry, pal.
I'll get us back on top.

1310
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:33,420
- It's just baby steps.
- It's just baby steps.

1311
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:36,991
I'll get you in front
of that camera where you belong.

1312
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,661
'Cause it only takes
one good gig.

1313
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:51,806
Okay,

1314
01:07:51,906 --> 01:07:53,140
they're reducing
the offer by half,

1315
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,408
but they'll let you
keep the mask.

1316
01:07:54,509 --> 01:07:56,911
I know I used your celebrity
to get the gig,

1317
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:58,613
but I'm starting to think
it's for the best

1318
01:07:58,713 --> 01:07:59,747
that you stay anonymous.

1319
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:01,983
Are you sure you don't need
an energy drink? Mm.

1320
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:04,484
Remember, it's not porn,
it's erotica,

1321
01:08:04,586 --> 01:08:06,621
so just be yourself
and try to have fun.

1322
01:08:11,593 --> 01:08:16,096
Well, I can't afford
the rent, Mr. Landlord.

1323
01:08:16,196 --> 01:08:19,767
But I'm sure there are some
other ways I can pay you.

1324
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:24,338
Come on, big boy.

1325
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:29,443
Let's see what we're
workin' with here.

1326
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:32,513
Huh? Huh?

1327
01:08:32,614 --> 01:08:33,548
Here. Here.

1328
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:37,018
What the fuck, Lance?
What is this?

1329
01:08:39,219 --> 01:08:42,657
Oh, yeah, oh yeah.
You like that, baby?

1330
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:45,459
You like watching your wife
fuck the landlord

1331
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,796
'cause your limp dick
can't pay the fucking rent?

1332
01:08:50,598 --> 01:08:52,700
Okay. That was not
a great idea.

1333
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,502
Erotica, my ass.
That was definitely pornography.

1334
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:58,171
We should have tried to book
a sitcom or a commercial.

1335
01:08:58,271 --> 01:08:59,641
No, we went too far, too fast.

1336
01:08:59,741 --> 01:09:01,241
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second. Wait a second.

1337
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:02,342
Did they see your penis?

1338
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:04,912
Oh, I can see the papers now.

1339
01:09:05,013 --> 01:09:06,213
Oh, it's the only thing
in showbiz

1340
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:07,414
you can't get away with.

1341
01:09:07,515 --> 01:09:09,517
They'll crucify you!
We'll be ruined!

1342
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:11,085
Mm, mm, mm.

1343
01:09:11,184 --> 01:09:13,655
Okay. Okay, we can put
a good spin on this.

1344
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:16,356
No, no. Ah, there's, uh...

1345
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:18,726
I just gotta--

1346
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:22,262
Oh, God.

1347
01:09:45,452 --> 01:09:47,320
Excuse me, Mr. Pronto?

1348
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:49,691
Could I speak to you
in the hall, please?

1349
01:09:57,197 --> 01:10:00,601
So, there's no easy way
of saying this.

1350
01:10:04,072 --> 01:10:05,139
Could I take a selfie?

1351
01:10:05,773 --> 01:10:08,609
For my wife, really.
She's a big fan!

1352
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:11,112
This one is stable.
I'll move him down to three.

1353
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:12,714
I got a dead John Doe here.

1354
01:10:12,814 --> 01:10:15,583
Take him down to cremation.
I'll start the paperwork.

1355
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:20,353
Oh, this is great.

1356
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:22,355
Oh, this is perfect!

1357
01:10:22,456 --> 01:10:23,490
Sorry it's so many.

1358
01:10:23,591 --> 01:10:25,760
Maybe funny faces this time.

1359
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,595
<i>Mosquito Boy</i> sucked!

1360
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:31,231
Sorry about that.

1361
01:10:31,331 --> 01:10:33,634
Let's take a couple
more pictures. Carol, come here!

1362
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,437
My wife's gonna love this.

1363
01:10:37,538 --> 01:10:41,274
My whole family's
gonna love this.

1364
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:44,411
Oh. Were you with the patient?

1365
01:10:45,445 --> 01:10:46,748
I'm afraid he passed.

1366
01:10:46,848 --> 01:10:49,249
We just sent him down
to cremation.

1367
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:53,487
I'm so sorry.
You missed his final moments.

1368
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:06,299
Hello, is anyone there?

1369
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:07,969
How are you feeling?

1370
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:11,773
Alive. That's good, I guess.

1371
01:11:11,873 --> 01:11:13,306
That's everything.

1372
01:11:16,376 --> 01:11:18,012
Is there anyone here for me?

1373
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:21,916
Hmm, there was a man,
but he left.

1374
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:23,416
He didn't come back.

1375
01:11:27,054 --> 01:11:29,624
Hmm... That makes sense.

1376
01:11:33,161 --> 01:11:35,062
I did him wrong, really.

1377
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:39,066
I never should have
pushed him that hard.

1378
01:11:43,237 --> 01:11:44,806
What was I thinking?

1379
01:11:46,207 --> 01:11:48,276
Erotic films?

1380
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:50,310
I lost my mind.

1381
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:55,750
I don't always see
the big picture.

1382
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:08,563
I need to be more observant
to the needs of others
around me.

1383
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:19,607
I mean, you get that.

1384
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:21,809
That's what you do
all day, right?

1385
01:12:25,412 --> 01:12:27,380
Oh, she's gone.

1386
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:34,689
I'm sorry about the epitaph.

1387
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:39,060
It was the only urn
I had available
in your price range.

1388
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:45,099
On another note,
I'm a huge fan
of all your movies.

1389
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,768
The big ones
and the little ones.

1390
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:52,039
Catch my drift?

1391
01:12:55,877 --> 01:12:57,879
- <i>Hey, Don.</i>
<i>- Who's this?</i>

1392
01:12:57,979 --> 01:12:59,046
<i>Oh, it's Lenny.</i>

1393
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:01,082
- <i>Who?</i>
- Lenny.

1394
01:13:01,182 --> 01:13:02,415
<i>What-- what number is this?</i>

1395
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:04,652
Oh, it's a new number. New cell.

1396
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:06,020
<i>No! I told you not to call me.</i>

1397
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,455
From that number.
Yeah, but this is a new number.

1398
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:09,957
<i>- Don't call me</i>
<i>from any number!</i>
- Okay.

1399
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:12,425
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>
<i>to you anymore, Lenny!</i>

1400
01:13:14,028 --> 01:13:16,330
- It's solid gold.
- I can see that,

1401
01:13:16,429 --> 01:13:18,165
but you engraved
that stupid saying on it

1402
01:13:18,266 --> 01:13:22,069
- and nobody is gonna
want it now.

1403
01:13:22,169 --> 01:13:23,470
Fine. I'll take anything.

1404
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:25,339
- Nope, it's worthless.
- Please.

1405
01:13:25,438 --> 01:13:27,375
Buddy, it is worthless to me.

1406
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:29,243
Have some compassion.

1407
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,145
- It's worthless.
- I'm on my last legs.

1408
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:32,780
- No!
- I...

1409
01:14:17,391 --> 01:14:18,693
Keep in touch.

1410
01:14:38,579 --> 01:14:40,681
Latte, where are you, buddy?

1411
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:43,117
Latte?

1412
01:14:44,484 --> 01:14:45,786
Latte...

1413
01:14:51,092 --> 01:14:52,460
Latte...

1414
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,271
<i>Pronto, wake up.</i>

1415
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:07,341
Pronto, wake up!
Wake up, Pronto!

1416
01:15:07,441 --> 01:15:09,143
It's me, the Dagger.

1417
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:11,379
You're not safe here.

1418
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:13,047
Come with me. Come on.

1419
01:15:16,017 --> 01:15:19,587
They watching us, man.
They always watching.

1420
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:26,627
Come on, this way.

1421
01:15:40,408 --> 01:15:42,109
There.

1422
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:43,477
Welcome to my hideout.

1423
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:45,880
The trains disrupt
the government frequencies.

1424
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:48,115
They can't listen to us here.

1425
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:49,583
We can speak freely.

1426
01:15:50,418 --> 01:15:52,686
Now, I know you think
what's been happening
to your career

1427
01:15:52,787 --> 01:15:55,022
is accidental, or fate even.

1428
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:58,726
But I'm telling you,
everything is by design.

1429
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:00,861
Climb a little too high

1430
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:02,763
and they'll take you
down eventually.

1431
01:16:02,863 --> 01:16:04,131
It keeps happening.

1432
01:16:04,765 --> 01:16:07,034
Bruce Lee, dead.

1433
01:16:07,134 --> 01:16:09,103
Brandon Lee, dead.

1434
01:16:09,203 --> 01:16:11,572
George Lopez?
Where the hell is he?

1435
01:16:11,672 --> 01:16:12,973
Is he in that urn
you're holding?

1436
01:16:14,008 --> 01:16:17,445
Inch by inch, they'll try
to erase you from the record.

1437
01:16:17,546 --> 01:16:19,046
I should know.

1438
01:16:19,146 --> 01:16:20,347
It happened to me.

1439
01:16:21,849 --> 01:16:23,451
I was Kyle Tyson.

1440
01:16:23,552 --> 01:16:26,153
The biggest box office star
in the world.

1441
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:28,656
Millions of fans,
with a seven-picture deal.

1442
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:31,025
But I must have climbed
a little too high.

1443
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,428
But you know what?
The joke's on them, man.

1444
01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:36,764
Because I had the realization.

1445
01:16:36,864 --> 01:16:40,501
They can take away the movies,
and the cars, and the women,

1446
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:42,537
but they can't take away
the Dagger

1447
01:16:42,636 --> 01:16:44,305
because I am the Dagger!

1448
01:16:45,706 --> 01:16:47,741
And you're the Mosquito.

1449
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:50,277
And I can prove it.

1450
01:16:53,914 --> 01:16:56,684
See all these cars rushing
here and there to work?

1451
01:16:57,985 --> 01:16:59,120
Watch this.

1452
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,454
By Zeus's sword,

1453
01:17:00,555 --> 01:17:03,224
I summon the power
of invisibility!

1454
01:17:13,868 --> 01:17:16,270
Look, they don't even see us.
They're riding right past.

1455
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:21,642
You hungry?

1456
01:17:23,512 --> 01:17:24,745
Watch this.

1457
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:29,650
By Odin's hammer,
freeze these insubordinates!

1458
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:44,265
You want a bite?

1459
01:17:45,966 --> 01:17:48,302
You see? Look at that.

1460
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:49,604
That's you.

1461
01:17:49,703 --> 01:17:51,939
Yeah, the Mosquito.

1462
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:54,341
It's in the universe.

1463
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:55,610
And what's this?

1464
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:59,079
"When emotions get in the way
of your cons.

1465
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:03,717
Christiana Dior and Chad Luxt
are Emoticons."

1466
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:05,219
That look like shit, right?

1467
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:08,222
Oh...

1468
01:18:09,056 --> 01:18:10,157
Hell, man.

1469
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:13,794
See you later, Lopez.

1470
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:16,430
<i>Vaya con dios.</i>

1471
01:18:30,811 --> 01:18:32,213
Let's send him off here.

1472
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:44,491
Lopez, you made us laugh,
you made us cry.

1473
01:18:44,593 --> 01:18:46,961
Travel now down the River Styx.

1474
01:18:47,562 --> 01:18:49,830
May Zuul meet you
at the smoky gates

1475
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:52,866
with the power
of a thousand daggers.

1476
01:19:08,349 --> 01:19:09,383
Damn, man.

1477
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:11,452
My bad.

1478
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:42,049
Good thing you were here.
You saved that guy's life.

1479
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:43,183
Wait.

1480
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:45,252
Are you Latte Pronto?

1481
01:19:47,488 --> 01:19:49,023
Oh.

1482
01:19:49,123 --> 01:19:51,526
Oh, my God, Alvie!
It's Latte Pronto!

1483
01:19:51,626 --> 01:19:53,561
Latte Pronto. Huh?

1484
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,130
Oh, my gosh. Yeah.

1485
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:58,700
Look, Lenny,
you're just not on the list.

1486
01:19:58,799 --> 01:20:00,669
But you know me by now, Gandhi.

1487
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:02,269
Yeah, but that doesn't put you
on the list.

1488
01:20:02,369 --> 01:20:04,438
But you're not even looking
at the list.

1489
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:05,939
'Cause I know you're not on it.

1490
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:10,311
Look, I'm sorry, you're right.
Anything we can work out?

1491
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:12,681
Hey, did you hear about Latte?

1492
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:14,848
No. You know something
about Latte?

1493
01:20:14,948 --> 01:20:16,984
They're giving him a key
to the city.

1494
01:20:17,084 --> 01:20:18,819
Some guys got all the luck, huh?

1495
01:20:18,919 --> 01:20:20,220
<i>In honor of his courage</i>

1496
01:20:20,321 --> 01:20:22,289
<i>and sense of civic duty</i>
<i>toward his fellow man,</i>

1497
01:20:22,389 --> 01:20:24,659
<i>no matter what their</i>
<i>place in society,</i>

1498
01:20:25,192 --> 01:20:26,427
- <i>it is with great pride...</i>
- Wow.

1499
01:20:26,528 --> 01:20:27,762
<i>...that I present Mr.</i>
<i>Pronto with this,</i>

1500
01:20:27,861 --> 01:20:29,963
the key to the city
of Los Angeles.

1501
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:35,537
Now, don't try to get in
the City Hall with that.

1502
01:20:35,637 --> 01:20:36,738
It's purely symbolic.

1503
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,742
But all jokes aside,

1504
01:20:40,841 --> 01:20:44,411
I'd like to talk to you
in earnest about
running for office.

1505
01:20:44,512 --> 01:20:46,080
Let's grab lunch, huh?

1506
01:20:47,081 --> 01:20:48,482
I've had a good run.

1507
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:51,151
But nobody wants
to be mayor forever.

1508
01:20:52,986 --> 01:20:54,088
If you're not moving up
in this world,

1509
01:20:54,188 --> 01:20:57,024
you're moving out, or over.

1510
01:20:57,124 --> 01:20:59,326
Or whatever
the expression is.

1511
01:20:59,426 --> 01:21:03,263
That's why I'm gonna take a run
at the Senate.

1512
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:06,200
Now, I'm gonna need somebody
to fill my shoes.

1513
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,969
Somebody who's gonna
endorse me, of course.

1514
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:11,872
And someone
who the people will love.

1515
01:21:11,972 --> 01:21:14,743
And that's where you come in.

1516
01:21:14,843 --> 01:21:17,311
Well, people love
a comeback story.

1517
01:21:17,411 --> 01:21:20,114
If you can pretend to be
a person in the movies,

1518
01:21:20,214 --> 01:21:22,449
you can pretend to be
a person in life.

1519
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,719
Sorry, I'm late.

1520
01:21:24,819 --> 01:21:26,920
Did some quick polling.
They love him.

1521
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,455
They absolutely love him.

1522
01:21:28,556 --> 01:21:30,424
- Ah.
- I've always been able
to pick a winner.

1523
01:21:30,525 --> 01:21:33,961
Well, speaking of winners,
Latte, this is Terry.

1524
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:35,730
We have a lot to do.

1525
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,231
His image is fine,

1526
01:21:37,331 --> 01:21:39,266
but we have to figure out
what platform he'll run on.

1527
01:21:39,366 --> 01:21:41,803
Oh, that's easy.
He's for the people.

1528
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:43,671
Well, every candidate
is for the people.

1529
01:21:43,772 --> 01:21:45,105
That's why it works.

1530
01:21:45,205 --> 01:21:47,975
No. The people
are ready for change.

1531
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:50,411
How about, um...

1532
01:21:50,512 --> 01:21:54,381
Freeing America
from its corporate grip?

1533
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:57,017
He's the anti-big
business candidate.

1534
01:21:57,117 --> 01:22:00,187
The-- the corporation killer.

1535
01:22:01,955 --> 01:22:03,056
I like that.

1536
01:22:03,825 --> 01:22:06,628
And, yes, he is for the fucking
people too, for Christ's sake.

1537
01:22:09,997 --> 01:22:11,666
We'll be in touch, Latte.

1538
01:22:11,766 --> 01:22:13,267
You're gonna be great, Latte.

1539
01:22:13,367 --> 01:22:15,102
But I'm gonna need this back.

1540
01:22:15,969 --> 01:22:17,304
They're just for show.

1541
01:22:30,919 --> 01:22:32,219
Get in.

1542
01:23:52,499 --> 01:23:57,005
I'm afraid my brother is under the weather, Mr.
 Pronto.

1543
01:23:57,639 --> 01:24:01,743
So, I will be speaking
on his behalf.

1544
01:24:03,076 --> 01:24:05,445
You're a man of few words.

1545
01:24:08,683 --> 01:24:12,486
It is very hard to trust
a man of few words.

1546
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:15,389
It is hard to know
where he stands.

1547
01:24:15,489 --> 01:24:18,826
So when he is selected,
and believe me,

1548
01:24:18,927 --> 01:24:21,563
all men in your position
are selected,

1549
01:24:21,663 --> 01:24:26,266
it is very disconcerting
to discover that suddenly,

1550
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:28,703
he is a man with an agenda.

1551
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:33,240
He has traded in
his cape for a cause.

1552
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:36,878
He is a "corporation killer."

1553
01:24:36,978 --> 01:24:38,713
"Anti-big business."

1554
01:24:39,714 --> 01:24:42,617
He's for the people.

1555
01:24:45,853 --> 01:24:47,722
Some dissent is good.

1556
01:24:49,857 --> 01:24:52,259
You must allow some dissent.

1557
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:57,497
But is that what
"the people" want...

1558
01:24:59,934 --> 01:25:01,335
Mr. Pronto?

1559
01:25:02,737 --> 01:25:06,774
What do you know
of the people, hmm?

1560
01:25:07,575 --> 01:25:12,479
For the people
are bloodthirsty, Mr. Pronto.

1561
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:17,885
They sit in the dark
and sip syrupy sodas

1562
01:25:17,986 --> 01:25:20,387
like the blood of their enemies

1563
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:25,526
while they watched
hyper-realized versions
of themselves

1564
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:29,797
kill and kill
and kill some more.

1565
01:25:29,897 --> 01:25:31,799
And do you know why?

1566
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:36,470
Because it makes them forget.

1567
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:42,043
It makes them
stop asking questions.

1568
01:25:42,577 --> 01:25:46,413
Because we want
to ask the questions.

1569
01:25:47,048 --> 01:25:48,916
Such as...

1570
01:25:49,017 --> 01:25:52,920
Who are you really,
Latte Pronto?

1571
01:25:58,893 --> 01:26:00,293
Where do you come from?

1572
01:26:02,864 --> 01:26:04,632
What do you want, really?

1573
01:26:04,732 --> 01:26:08,268
Our little birdies
couldn't find a thing on you,

1574
01:26:08,368 --> 01:26:11,471
and we find that
most disturbing.

1575
01:26:12,272 --> 01:26:14,876
Most disturbing, indeed.

1576
01:26:17,045 --> 01:26:22,050
However, I do not need
to know your true identity.

1577
01:26:22,717 --> 01:26:25,318
I don't need to know
your past history

1578
01:26:25,419 --> 01:26:28,355
to know what it is
that you really want,

1579
01:26:28,455 --> 01:26:30,725
because it is what I want.

1580
01:26:30,825 --> 01:26:33,226
It is what all men want.

1581
01:26:33,326 --> 01:26:38,032
That is why we crave fame,
and power and money.

1582
01:26:38,132 --> 01:26:41,102
For what you want,
what I want,

1583
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:43,538
and what all men want

1584
01:26:43,638 --> 01:26:48,943
is the unimpeded expulsion
of our jism!

1585
01:26:50,144 --> 01:26:52,714
And when you seek to destroy

1586
01:26:52,814 --> 01:26:56,684
another man's fame,
or wealth, or power,

1587
01:26:56,784 --> 01:26:59,352
you seek to eliminate
the very tools

1588
01:26:59,453 --> 01:27:03,758
he has amassed to ensure
that expulsion!

1589
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:09,997
My brother and I
will not be robbed

1590
01:27:10,098 --> 01:27:12,499
of our ability to expel!

1591
01:27:13,134 --> 01:27:18,539
We will not have the flow
of our natural desires
plugged up!

1592
01:27:19,807 --> 01:27:23,644
Our fluid will not be forced
to retreat inward!

1593
01:27:24,377 --> 01:27:25,847
So help me God!

1594
01:27:31,652 --> 01:27:34,354
Latte! My man.
It's good to have you back!

1595
01:27:34,454 --> 01:27:36,891
You're a hero.
Everybody loves a hero!

1596
01:27:36,991 --> 01:27:38,593
Key to the city? Come on!

1597
01:27:38,693 --> 01:27:39,794
And great news.

1598
01:27:39,894 --> 01:27:41,729
Despite being a colossal
critical failure,

1599
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:43,396
<i>Mosquito Boy</i>
did rather well overseas.

1600
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:46,100
I guess, uh, mosquitoes
are kind of a global irritant,

1601
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,235
so people could relate.

1602
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:48,636
I just feel like,
at this point,

1603
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,005
you need someone
that gets you.

1604
01:27:51,105 --> 01:27:52,940
"I get Latte."
You know?

1605
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,275
And the first step--
'cause you and I
are gonna do big things.

1606
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:59,346
So the first step for that
is you gotta cut the rest
of the team loose.

1607
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:03,251
Cut ties. You and me
are now doing big things.

1608
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:05,052
We are out there.
We are scared.

1609
01:28:05,153 --> 01:28:07,855
We don't have a plan,
so we're thinking on our feet.

1610
01:28:07,955 --> 01:28:10,258
We're on our backs,
thinking on our feet.

1611
01:28:10,357 --> 01:28:12,226
We don't know what these
big opportunities are.

1612
01:28:12,325 --> 01:28:13,861
We just know that
we have to get them.

1613
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:16,197
And that-- that's what's
so exciting about being--

1614
01:28:16,296 --> 01:28:17,698
being a young performer
at this time.

1615
01:28:17,799 --> 01:28:19,432
Like, Latte, we want
big things together.

1616
01:28:19,534 --> 01:28:20,668
What are you doing
up there, bud?

1617
01:28:20,768 --> 01:28:22,435
Bud, we want big things,
not this.

1618
01:28:22,537 --> 01:28:25,173
Bud? Hey, excuse me, bud?
Bud, what are you doing, Latte?

1619
01:28:25,273 --> 01:28:27,875
Latte! Can't have
you there! Latte!

1620
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:29,177
Latte!

1621
01:28:29,277 --> 01:28:30,578
Latte!

1622
01:28:31,245 --> 01:28:33,080
Latte! Latte!

1623
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:11,185
<i>Look, you gotta</i>
<i>take him back.</i>

1624
01:29:11,285 --> 01:29:12,887
Come on, you know you love him.

1625
01:29:12,987 --> 01:29:14,956
You know you need him.
He's got what it takes.

1626
01:29:15,056 --> 01:29:16,824
Give us another shot.

1627
01:29:16,924 --> 01:29:18,025
Please.

1628
01:29:18,693 --> 01:29:20,928
- I thought you didn't need me.
- Oh, but I do.

1629
01:29:21,629 --> 01:29:25,333
I do. And I'm willing to change.
Big time, right?

1630
01:29:25,432 --> 01:29:28,769
Yeah. I want
the Latte Pronto treatment.

1631
01:29:33,473 --> 01:29:35,475
Latte Pronto...

1632
01:29:36,844 --> 01:29:38,012
I don't know.

1633
01:29:38,112 --> 01:29:41,015
Fame, fortune,
do they matter?

1634
01:29:42,516 --> 01:29:44,484
You really wanna be somebody,

1635
01:29:44,585 --> 01:29:48,689
I'd say find someone
who really cares about you.

1636
01:29:50,591 --> 01:29:51,993
That's what really matters.

1637
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:00,034
Jumpin' Jesus.

1638
01:30:01,269 --> 01:30:02,336
Latte!

1639
01:30:02,435 --> 01:30:03,804
Latte, wait!

1640
01:30:03,905 --> 01:30:05,072
Latte!

1641
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:08,843
Latte! Latte!

1642
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:11,411
Latte, wait!

1643
01:30:21,956 --> 01:30:23,691
Latte!

1644
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:24,825
Latte!

1645
01:30:25,993 --> 01:30:27,061
Latte.

1646
01:30:28,461 --> 01:30:29,697
Latte.

1647
01:30:31,165 --> 01:30:32,199
Latte.

1648
01:30:33,868 --> 01:30:34,902
Latte.

1649
01:30:43,044 --> 01:30:47,048
Latte, please.
Just let me say one thing.

1650
01:30:47,715 --> 01:30:49,449
I'm sorry.

1651
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,953
I did you wrong.
I see that now.

1652
01:30:52,053 --> 01:30:53,587
If there's something
you need to tell me,

1653
01:30:53,688 --> 01:30:55,122
then just say it.

1654
01:30:55,222 --> 01:30:56,791
Say it.

1655
01:30:56,891 --> 01:31:00,328
I can handle it. I can change.
Just let me have it.

1656
01:31:00,428 --> 01:31:02,763
Help me become
the better version of myself.

1657
01:31:04,565 --> 01:31:07,969
Got it. Silent treatment.
That's fair.

1658
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:09,236
You probably hate my guts.

1659
01:31:09,337 --> 01:31:11,238
But listen,
for what it's worth,

1660
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:13,908
I don't care about the work.

1661
01:31:14,642 --> 01:31:16,043
I just miss you.

1662
01:31:17,244 --> 01:31:20,614
I just miss you.

1663
01:31:20,715 --> 01:31:22,650
'Cause I really love you, pal.

1664
01:31:23,284 --> 01:31:24,652
I mean it.

1665
01:31:29,757 --> 01:31:31,926
I... love you too.

1666
01:31:35,363 --> 01:31:36,597
Thank you.

1667
01:31:38,032 --> 01:31:39,066
Thank you.

1668
01:31:42,703 --> 01:31:44,939
Thank you.

1669
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:46,073
Thank you.

1670
01:31:55,383 --> 01:31:56,951
What's this? For me?

1671
01:32:03,824 --> 01:32:06,060
Is this for real, pal?
It's just...

1672
01:32:08,729 --> 01:32:10,631
What am I looking
at here? Is this...

1673
01:32:11,732 --> 01:32:14,535
Could be real. Yeah...

1674
01:32:14,635 --> 01:32:16,670
It could be a bunch
of fool's gold.

1675
01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:20,307
You know?

1676
01:32:23,044 --> 01:32:24,111
You know what?

1677
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:25,946
Forget it. We got each other.

1678
01:32:27,982 --> 01:32:30,584
You hungry? Come on,
let's grab a bite to eat.
