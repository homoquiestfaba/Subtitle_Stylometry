1
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:38,080
I think ... know ... what they do is fantastic

2
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,786
the two have been through this,

3
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:41,667
and know the shit that must withstand

4
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:43,780
when they see the same person every day.

5
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:47,422
For us it is absolutely the best arrangement,

6
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,918
because we're both very busy,

7
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:50,699
I work by day, by night she

8
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:55,681
I can see the Knicks without interruption ...

9
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:56,752
I get up at noon,

10
00:00:56,953 --> 00:00:59,059
I take a coffee in peace without having to talk to anyone

11
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:01,373
or comment as I like the rings.

12
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:02,842
What we are saying is that actually

13
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:04,643
not have to do ever.

14
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:06,275
Exactly

15
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:07,788
Therefore we do not have to endure the attacks of other

16
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,097
-Hmm!

17
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:11,516
Absence makes everything more fun

18
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,074
And it makes sex hotter

19
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:15,613
Oh, beware the details! -Is true

20
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:17,953
I did not tell what we did?

21
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:18,829
Contále! - Is pretty good ...

22
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:20,247
Is your face ... like, baby?

23
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:22,291
Oh. is a little sore

24
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:23,792
So are "friends with benefits"

25
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,002
but with papers, right?

26
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:26,903
No, no! listen to me!

27
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:29,381
We are both in our second marriage

28
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:31,203
and we are trying to be a little more realistic

29
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:32,623
this time, about what we need ...

30
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:33,624
... Or we do not need

31
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,970
I am fully aware

32
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:36,513
since my last blowjob and I'm fine with it

33
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,441
Enough!

34
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:39,242
is supposed to have a nice lunch!

35
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,199
I have no idea what it means

36
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:48,463
traducirmelo could you?

37
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:49,607
No. .. I think about many things

38
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,071
and I think eventually

39
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:52,072
you will gain a great blowjob

40
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,311
When we met I really felt

41
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:57,034
we were perfectly compatible

42
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:59,536
but then began to haunt both

43
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,121
I think ... what ...

44
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:02,349
we started to distance ourselves, right?

45
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:05,334
this fucking ... this fucking!

46
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:06,752
of course we are very much in love!

47
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,254
Very! - Somehow it again more sensitive.

48
00:02:09,236 --> 00:02:11,924
Oh ... I'm obsessed with the whole relationship,

49
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,009
what I mean is that my sister and I

50
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:16,762
were educated in a home very, very Catholic

51
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:19,445
and ... taught us that ...

52
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:22,392
that marriage is ... is ... sacred!

53
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:24,561
and to be respectful of it

54
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,021
and ... do not know ...

55
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:27,689
talk about oral sex at lunch ...

56
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:29,983
not being respectful.

57
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,070
I heard that if you wake up at least

58
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,363
once a week, look at your partner and you think:

59
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:36,698
"I made a serious error"

60
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:37,658
then something is really wrong

61
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:38,909
with your marriage

62
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:40,661
Marsha feels that way every morning

63
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:42,746
then? that is normal too?

64
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,873
Listen ... this conversation is very,

65
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:45,890
very annoying for me.

66
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:47,042
No. .. Yes it is.

67
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:48,669
Marriage is something very special

68
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:50,128
Oh, yes it is.

69
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,505
is a sacrament, it is!

70
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:53,048
should be married by that ...

71
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:55,175
want to spend their life together!

72
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,469
not because she sucks good ...

73
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,846
I think you missed the point

74
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:00,389
she does not "blow jobs" at all!

75
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,765
Enough!

76
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:03,350
The problem with your argument is that

77
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:04,816
We are not married by ...

78
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,615
by ... something special ... a sacrament .... or ...

79
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:07,646
because they are deeply in love

80
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,690
So I got married!

81
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:11,128
After 18 years together

82
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,527
going to reveal something else?

83
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:16,071
you said 18?-Wau, it sounds amazing!

84
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:18,532
I know. I just said ... OK

85
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,953
when you suggested it, we were in love, ok?-Yes!

86
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:25,358
well ... when I imagined my life

87
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:26,748
"Mapeandola" in front of my

88
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:28,959
I thought "maybe" ... only "maybe"

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,503
could have had a musical career

90
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:33,839
Ha, that music career!? Ha ha! dale!

91
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,647
I do not know "what musical career," that's my point

92
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,551
That's my point, you got a music career

93
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:39,011
If you had not become pregnant,

94
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:40,470
we had not married!

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,930
Look, I do not understand what you say

96
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:43,533
think you repent of having married me.

97
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,726
I do not regret anything! I am saying:

98
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,519
let's pretend instead of this wonderful thing

99
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:49,394
"So lovely" we have

100
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,815
we had other things to do

101
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:54,067
If we had not married, then, who knows?

102
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:55,652
could have had more time to meet,

103
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:57,487
maybe start a career ...

104
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:59,109
Yes, and then you never would have married me,

105
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,742
I see, yes, I understand what you say

106
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:04,536
Hey! been married 18 years!,

107
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:06,330
have an amazing son,

108
00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:08,457
is in a great school ... I mean ...

109
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:11,335
no ... if everything ended today

110
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,631
probably would call a success, right?

111
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,966
Look, I did not want to ruin the lunch

112
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:19,676
but honestly ...

113
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:21,136
are unhappy.

114
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:24,389
Maybe it should have done is to be honest.

115
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:25,641
Could have made things worse

116
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:26,558
because I wanted to say:

117
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,810
"Hey, you two hate each other, divorciense!"

118
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:31,688
And so it should not go to those unhappy lunches
anymore.

119
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,398
Do not know why we do more often

120
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:34,983
was hilarious, once a week is little

121
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:37,361
Ah! I know!, you can believe what he said

122
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,404
about her marriage in front of us???

123
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:41,615
If you ever feel so

124
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,450
comes to beware that shit please

125
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,161
Seriously!. I liked your comment about the blowjob

126
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,665
Just in case you suck if you really want the

127
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:52,167
would not be happy, but would

128
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,461
Good to know, because as you know

129
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,214
my birthday is coming ...

130
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,216
Yeah ... mmm ... look what I've done ....

131
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:01,802
I forget ... you can tie

132
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:02,785
I thought of a nice pair of socks ...

133
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,265
Sox? 'If

134
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:11,186
You know, I jack off with those stockings ...

135
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:13,063
I think relationships should be easy

136
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:15,732
My first marriage was pure drama

137
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,526
was a nightmare.

138
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,027
And it was a relief to find someone so ...

139
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,696
So ... "free-of-drama"

140
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,448
Look, all these relationships

141
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,951
have so many unnecessary complications

142
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:28,662
as my first wife, who was ...

143
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:31,290
Mad-A Challenge

144
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:33,292
It's nice to find someone

145
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:36,044
with a balanced personality,

146
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:38,630
a rational human being, haha!

147
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:40,465
These relations are always

148
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,050
in which are one above the other

149
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:47,014
and we promised not let us

150
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,350
... Not drown in a glass of water ...

151
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:54,521
No ... it may be fanciful

152
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,648
But the thing is that maybe

153
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,443
this period of honeymoon ...

154
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:01,653
Last forever.

155
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,040
There you have.

156
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,852
Hey!, Dara?

157
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:11,364
Hi, I can help?

158
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,460
ehhhh ... if, wait

159
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:18,754
Love is for you, is Dara.

160
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:20,240
Do it go

161
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:23,229
I went

162
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:28,430
you want me to say?

163
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:29,750
you are? you went to work?

164
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,763
No, no. Tell him I'm sleeping. - Ok

165
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:34,269
Love, please do not give money

166
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,348
I will not give money, I promise

167
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,770
... Yes, give ...

168
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:41,401
I promise! I have no need to spend!

169
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:44,780
Dara I married at a time of ...

170
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,156
confusion.

171
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,368
I do not know, I looked dark and mysterious

172
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:51,912
Then I grew up and not

173
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,580
and then I realized that

174
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:54,706
was not dark or mysterious

175
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,629
only alcoholic.

176
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,004
Hey! Shakespeare!

177
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,810
Hey! this Katie?

178
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,292
I wanted to ask something ...

179
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:05,043
is, but this napping

180
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:07,148
Look, just in case

181
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,665
I have no money to give you, as you know

182
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,430
And Katie ...

183
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:15,041
I know you said he could not give a penny more

184
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:16,987
makes you think I look for silver

185
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:19,220
a knight can not go to say hello?

186
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:22,099
Look ... the unexpected visit of the ex-husband

187
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,953
a Sunday afternoon ... usually ...

188
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:25,912
is not the best idea

189
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:29,000
regardless I'm always glad to see you

190
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:31,591
then ... I can do for you?

191
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,772
Nothing, he was in the area

192
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:36,132
Actually, I have an audition for a play

193
00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:44,644
Dara is a type not so bad ...

194
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:47,113
is just an actor.

195
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:49,457
Ok, I'm not being totally honest

196
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,770
there is a hearing

197
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,272
I'm in a financial downturn

198
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,320
so if you got a few dollars I'd appreciate it much

199
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,321
as live as "light"?

200
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:59,884
where are you going to stop these days?

201
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:00,735
A girl

202
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:01,905
this week

203
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:04,764
let me stay at home

204
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,826
You know what I can do for you?

205
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:12,827
I have a crap that was going to give

206
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,532
The you can sell on E-Bay

207
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,533
you can them out, 50 or 100 dollars

208
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,397
still works ...

209
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:25,484
Ok ... I'm taking

210
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:28,319
Chau Buzz

211
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,452
Always a pleasure

212
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,069
Buzz is that he tried to do the right thing

213
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,371
giving me the vacuum cleaner to sell

214
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:37,199
I do not know computers,

215
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,212
I do not have much luck

216
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:39,819
selling it on a website

217
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,351
but I will try to sell on the street

218
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:45,798
There the coast is clear

219
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,083
To be clear, do not you see him

220
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:51,299
that guy.

221
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,021
Oh, I was very young

222
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,022
his face was tortured artist.

223
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:58,513
How much did you give?

224
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:00,926
Why do you assume that you say something?

225
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,346
Because I know ...

226
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:05,975
The?

227
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:09,970
mmm .... you saw the old vacuum cleaner?

228
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:13,017
That? Why?

229
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:14,200
Can sell it on E-Bay!

230
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:15,520
You may be given some money for that

231
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,976
My God, you're so easy to convince!

232
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:17,901
It seemed hopeless!

233
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:21,011
Why are you so soft with my ex-husband?

234
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:23,083
Look, I feel bad for the guy, okay?

235
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,906
He had a chance with you and shit

236
00:09:25,907 --> 00:09:27,810
I have it now

237
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,636
so I'm someone who feels empathy for the cause

238
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:34,320
When I married you inherited your family, yes?

239
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,760
Then I dealt with the Irish crazy

240
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:39,366
Your sassy sister, her husband lunatic

241
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,081
and I'm just trying to do

242
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,917
things right for them all, mmm?

243
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:49,965
Also, I think you would do the same in my situation, right?

244
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,500
In fact it is very good.

245
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:54,360
I do not look inviting your ex-wife psycho-

246
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,287
to tea

247
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,563
Think is true,
what they were talking at lunch

248
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,062
we are a successful couple

249
00:10:01,063 --> 00:10:02,704
because we never see?

250
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:03,705
Yes, absolutely

251
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:04,706
I think it's important to keep

252
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:07,369
a safe distance, otherwise

253
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,088
you will fully satiate me

254
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:11,882
But, what if ...?

255
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,230
If we were to see each other again?

256
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:15,402
If you are pregnant, or something?

257
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:19,757
Are you pregnant?

258
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:21,285
No! No!

259
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:22,035
Are you sure?

260
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:23,591
Yes, I am

261
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:25,303
No, because I remember that night

262
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:27,309
a month ago, we drank too much ...

263
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,384
I'm not pregnant

264
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:29,385
was all hypothetical

265
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:33,317
If we need to spend more time together

266
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:35,055
desmoronaríamos us?

267
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:37,586
No, we desmoronaríamos ...

268
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:41,387
but I'm a little confused ...

269
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:43,863
We both agree on the children.

270
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:45,568
Yes!, I do not want children

271
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:47,123
It was purely hypothetical

272
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:47,939
All right.

273
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,092
It's all

274
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:52,040
I wanted to be sure we can take

275
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,363
Absolutely, yes. I say, yes

276
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,724
We can handle anything

277
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:57,956
that life throws us.

278
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:58,789
Do me a favor

279
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,527
As you spell Vasectomy?

280
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:39,146
Hello? 'Hi, I'm looking to Buzzy O'Rourke

281
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:42,781
Ok ... ahh ... is working, who is?

282
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,923
I'm his sister, Linda

283
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:47,783
Ah ... If your sister ... ok ....

284
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:50,826
mmm ... Hello

285
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:51,827
In fact his half-sister

286
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:54,098
we have the same piece of shit father

287
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:56,848
Listen, I can upload? very cold

288
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,541
and I'm not properly dressed.

289
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,170
Sure ... just went to work, but ...

290
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,070
Yes, I went.

291
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:11,839
Hi, My God! Hello, you must be Katie!

292
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,496
And you must be Linda!

293
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:15,224
My God, you're beautiful!

294
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:16,968
Thanks, thanks.

295
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:17,969
You're welcome.

296
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,523
Oh, sorry I wanted you to know that a lot

297
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:22,102
I missed the wedding

298
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:24,303
I really wish I could be

299
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:29,146
Come in, come

300
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:31,410
Oh, Wau!, Look here!

301
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:35,768
It's giant twine must be filled!

302
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:38,951
You have something to drink? a beer or something?

303
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:41,144
Yeah, sure, Thanks!

304
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:45,165
Recently I get off the plane

305
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,082
and travel is so stressful ... and all that ...

306
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,034
All that traffic in New York

307
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,623
It Heineken-Oh yeah, you have to be cool ...

308
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:54,984
That's one reason I wanted to go poque LA

309
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:55,985
Thank you.

310
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:59,266
You know, traffic is horrible

311
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:01,062
Yes, completely

312
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,524
Buzzy you warn him you were coming?

313
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:04,854
Because I do not say anything

314
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:07,221
Really?, I say, I called back about a month ago

315
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:08,222
and told him I thought to come

316
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,223
Ah.

317
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:10,942
What time back to work?

318
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:12,578
In a couple of hours, close to 19.

319
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:16,124
Ok!, I will take a shower, freshen up

320
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,826
There is a good place where I can accommodate?

321
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:19,827
if ... if ...

322
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:23,082
There is an extra room

323
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,083
Perfect, I leave you free

324
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:26,932
is that you have to go to work

325
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,884
and thank you very much for letting stay here

326
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:34,179
and I want you to know, do not worry ...

327
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
... Until I find my own place

328
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,320
Beautiful, totally gorgeous

329
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:45,387
He never spoke of having a sister,

330
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:48,405
or I who said they

331
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:51,950
I think the invite to the wedding but did not come

332
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:56,055
when he arrived and said he hoped to stay

333
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,185
I was a little surprised.

334
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:04,249
Hey! guess who I ring the bell this morning?

335
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,921
Your sister!

336
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,486
my brother ...?

337
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:11,318
Shit! Do not tell me really came

338
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,782
Yep! I left the department

339
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,614
my jewelry will be safe?

340
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:17,866
do not know if I can guarantee

341
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,833
Well, then better home andd

342
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,398
Look, I have another client

343
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,047
finished, go home and take care

344
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:29,159
You knew that was coming?

345
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,730
I called a couple of months and said

346
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:33,142
I was thinking about leaving Los Angeles

347
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,986
save for a plane ticket

348
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,468
but I never really going to show up

349
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:38,469
Well, it appeared!

350
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,035
and "the impression" that will stay with us

351
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:45,226
shit!

352
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:47,687
Heart, look, I will take care of this

353
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:50,158
I will accommodate in a hotel or ...

354
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,306
no, no, okay, it's your sister, I'm your woman

355
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:55,833
do the right thing

356
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,528
Cornered, thanks

357
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,385
See you at night

358
00:14:58,386 --> 00:14:59,963
See

359
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:05,249
I know Linda is a pretty burned mine

360
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,290
our father died when he was 16

361
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,291
and ran away from home after that,

362
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:12,751
went to Los Angeles, then ...

363
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:16,214
16, a fugitive in Los Angeles ...

364
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,752
Not exactly a recipe for success.

365
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:28,095
Guess who?

366
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:31,781
ehhh .... I'm in town!

367
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:34,737
I wanted to call and say hello

368
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:39,250
and know how are you? ... how are you?

369
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:43,083
I need to see, I'm here in N.Y.

370
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:45,323
I thought we could be

371
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:48,526
I'm here! really!

372
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:51,388
Where were your honeymoon?

373
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:52,389
He was good?

374
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:01,982
Dale ... I just want to see

375
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:05,684
You still there?

376
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:08,765
Listen do not be an asshole

377
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:11,260
Let's meet for a drink, yes?

378
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,791
Yeah, ok ... hey!

379
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,386
Thank you.

380
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:31,013
You're kidding?

381
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:32,602
My God!

382
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:34,486
I can not believe it! 'Hello!

383
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,641
We are in N.Y. - Yes!

384
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,231
Here I am

385
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,584
Wau, I was rushing to get home

386
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:41,585
to greet you, where are you going?

387
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,906
Yes!, Right now I'll find me with a friend

388
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:44,907
we drink

389
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,319
but I'm glad that we are crossed!

390
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,977
I'm shocked

391
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:49,465
Look at you, you grew a lot

392
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,113
When was the last time you saw?

393
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:54,008
It was still a teenager

394
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,686
Actually it was Dad's funeral

395
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:56,598
Yeah, right.

396
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,462
Neither cried

397
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:01,152
You keep talking to your mother?, Or ...

398
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,276
No, I do not

399
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:07,242
and I have no plans to contact her

400
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,736
I can not blame you, either

401
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:13,186
That's the Katie bag?

402
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:15,278
Oh, yes, oh you know ...

403
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,900
I did not come prepared for this climate

404
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:20,905
on the other hand, is nuts-Si, if

405
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,019
I hope you do not mind, you think?

406
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,392
No, no, this also

407
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,718
You should know that

408
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:31,506
I forgot to mention that perhaps you were coming ...

409
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:35,793
Ah! ... So this morning was so rare

410
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:37,382
I mean, a little weird

411
00:17:37,383 --> 00:17:38,911
Look, I have to go fast

412
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:40,649
I have to meet my friend

413
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,650
but I see you later, we find,

414
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:43,580
we can chat some more.

415
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:44,581
I'll be home all night

416
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:48,215
Excellent! 'See you then!

417
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,689
Welcome to N.Y. and see you tonight, ok?

418
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,488
Yes, totally, we later

419
00:17:54,311 --> 00:17:56,688
Not to tell Buzzy if asked, but

420
00:17:56,689 --> 00:18:01,886
I felt very close to him as a child

421
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:06,078
He was at home all the time,

422
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,982
and I'm glad I could come

423
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,901
and see for a while,

424
00:18:11,902 --> 00:18:13,936
and re-meet him, I think ...

425
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:16,749
Linda ... I can say about it?

426
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,046
I can not say I really know her well

427
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:21,844
I was already in college

428
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:24,976
when she was a baby

429
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:28,834
and really I have no memories of her.

430
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:31,445
What surprised, really!

431
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:39,952
Because with my band ... we'll be
all weekend.

432
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,418
How many are in the band?

433
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,587
I and three kids

434
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,560
My wife owns the studio ...

435
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:50,524
and she goes out on weekends.

436
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,980
I can schedule you at this time

437
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:54,687
How old are you?

438
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:57,079
Well ... How old are you you? - 23

439
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,057
Really? 'If

440
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:01,664
Okay ... - If I was born in '87

441
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:03,530
'87? - JA-

442
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:05,946
And where were you in '87?

443
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:11,413
Actually .... it is a long history

444
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:13,446
I think I have the Oedipus complex

445
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,352
My God, you're giving me a heart attack

446
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:23,216
Excuse me ....

447
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,406
What? - What are you doing?

448
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:32,299
Do nothing

449
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,937
Why not ask her out

450
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,374
I mean, I'm sitting here, but again

451
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,953
why not ask her out?

452
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:37,954
Yes ... but .... no!

453
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:39,907
I can see you! through the glass, I can hear you!

454
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:41,938
P.T., you saw it?

455
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,497
Dress like trying to cogérsela or what?

456
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,388
Not out of this!

457
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,763
Marsha, we were checking the lines

458
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:49,772
and you're making a fuss about nothing

459
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,441
I do not understand ... 'I do not lie

460
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,673
I'm not lying!

461
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:53,674
We were just talking about it!

462
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:56,512
Ah! you're the composer and musician ...

463
00:19:56,513 --> 00:19:58,450
and the owner of the studio!

464
00:19:58,451 --> 00:20:00,750
Look, this should be my job, ok?

465
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,672
You're here for me

466
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:04,426
You do not know anything, you do not know anything!

467
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:06,765
You have this job because I gave it to you

468
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:10,009
No? ... Okay?

469
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,609
Because I have to sit down and look at you

470
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,483
trying to fuck a minita

471
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:16,877
while I'm here in the fourth

472
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,657
if you do, do it in private!

473
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:22,588
You're turning into a disgusting old

474
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:29,360
I am a musician, I have ideas, I have dreams

475
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:34,229
I can do something creative, but ...

476
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,230
not ...

477
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:57,926
By the way, thanks for making me wait 2 hours

478
00:20:58,409 --> 00:20:59,392
I could not get a taxi

479
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:00,497
and I come from Queens

480
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:02,133
Ok! but I say ... 2 hours!

481
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:06,388
So you do in N.Y.?

482
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:08,979
I came for you

483
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,727
You came for me?

484
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,338
I think you came 10 months later

485
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:18,504
Yes, I see. Why not tell me you were gonna marry?

486
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:20,676
I told someone I had known

487
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:22,386
and that was serious, I told you

488
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:25,496
That is very different from saying "I do"

489
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:27,004
When you left L.A. I did not think

490
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:29,044
the next I saw you'd see that married

491
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:32,138
I would have to go

492
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:34,067
What is this? you hate me yet?

493
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,255
That's the point?

494
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:36,317
No, do not hate you

495
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:39,237
I do not want to have this conversation, Linda

496
00:21:39,238 --> 00:21:40,784
He took the job after I told

497
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:42,510
I would not marry him

498
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:45,958
I guess I was not prepared

499
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:50,562
But ... now I think it was a mistake

500
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:52,866
It broke my heart once

501
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:55,535
Why do not you follow on with your life?

502
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:57,946
Because even I love you 'No, no

503
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,079
I do not want to hear that

504
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,569
Why, if it is true

505
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,031
Because I'm married reverendamente, ok?

506
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:03,485
That's not my fault!

507
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:04,678
could you not marry me

508
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,713
does not mean you could run away and marry another

509
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:10,213
No! no! is not it, that's not what happened!

510
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:12,513
that's not what happened

511
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:18,496
I want to ask something

512
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:23,530
What are you doing here?

513
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:25,918
I do not know

514
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,696
I do

515
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:42,830
Recontra still be crazy, right?

516
00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:52,046
You say?

517
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:54,469
I can not

518
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:59,261
Really?

519
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:07,494
Yes

520
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:09,840
Yes, really

521
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:26,970
He is about to go home

522
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:29,351
and go to bed with his new wife

523
00:23:29,352 --> 00:23:32,200
wanted me to see that maybe

524
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,046
I can go to bed with someone too,

525
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:35,808
if to

526
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:39,336
men respond to that.

527
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:40,166
I got to a guy jealous

528
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:43,544
and they will do almost anything you want, yes?

529
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,401
Cute!, Sooo cute.

530
00:23:47,402 --> 00:23:49,927
You're kidding!

531
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:06,087
Hello dear!

532
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,088
Hello baby!

533
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:08,089
Hey!

534
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,032
It was a good night?

535
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,218
A very good night!

536
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:13,162
We covered 94

537
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:14,294
Wau Wau!

538
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:18,653
Let's stay here and take a glass of wine, shall we?

539
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,694
How was your night?

540
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:22,157
You met your sister?

541
00:24:22,158 --> 00:24:25,415
Yes and no is to do with the subject

542
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,797
Yes, it's my sister

543
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,630
but I do not recognize ...

544
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:30,936
and best of all, this here
by a bed of shit

545
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,538
Glad to hear you say this

546
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,170
because I think it is a "little problem"

547
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:37,788
say, a little, a little bard

548
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:38,789
Just a little bit

549
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,326
Yes, I know

550
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:41,327
Is he here?

551
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,828
No, no, actually came

552
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:44,584
You have friends here?

553
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,571
I have no idea, but

554
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,866
appeared in N.Y. in the middle of winter

555
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:49,867
without a coat ...

556
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:52,372
let him take one of your closet ...

557
00:24:52,373 --> 00:24:54,546
Okay ... good ...

558
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:58,360
If ... you know which grabbed?

559
00:24:58,361 --> 00:25:00,735
No. .. I know ...

560
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:02,172
wrong?

561
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:03,593
No!

562
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:05,169
Enough then 'Welcome to N.Y.

563
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,251
Why come to N.Y. in the middle of winter

564
00:25:08,252 --> 00:25:10,764
without a coat?

565
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:12,964
I do not understand.

566
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:18,030
totally, you're super generous

567
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:19,093
Thanks ...

568
00:25:19,094 --> 00:25:20,807
No, no! of course.

569
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:22,658
You're the boss

570
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:25,239
I drink to that

571
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,714
And now I go for a swim

572
00:25:27,715 --> 00:25:28,565
a bath?

573
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:30,821
Yes, and I'm taking this with me

574
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:35,935
Want some company ...?

575
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:37,104
No, this also

576
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,181
Ah, is there!

577
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:26,082
that sh ...!

578
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,083
what the hell goes here!

579
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:29,564
For!

580
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:32,432
Okay! is my friend!

581
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:35,618
Parala! Shut the fuck up!

582
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:36,619
Shut up!

583
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,620
Andate the whore of a mother

584
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:41,821
What the fuck is wrong with you! 're playing the father here?

585
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:44,345
What the heck is it, my God?

586
00:26:44,346 --> 00:26:46,189
Get out of my house Andate to shit "friend"

587
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,095
Andáte to shit

588
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:50,581
Take this all

589
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:52,615
It's your problem!

590
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:53,616
Andate to shit!

591
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:56,507
Wait for me!

592
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,793
Do not know how Katie will react

593
00:27:12,794 --> 00:27:15,652
obviously this upset

594
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:17,401
because Linda took shelter

595
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,127
and also lied to Katie

596
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:20,668
saying that I gave him shelter

597
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:21,669
Steal the warm, bring a chabón,

598
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,587
All within 12 hours of being here

599
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:27,905
this is not good ...

600
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:29,477
You should be grateful

601
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:31,538
not heard it again last night

602
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,623
Why? what happened?

603
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:35,406
I got up at 5 am

604
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:37,805
to find an unknown type

605
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:40,265
zarpados fully in the kitchen counter

606
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:41,266
That?

607
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:42,786
Yes, I know, is crazy

608
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,372
... Very funny.

609
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,373
Due to security

610
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,734
clean up the kitchen

611
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:50,302
Thank you.

612
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:51,804
But the point is not the kind of thing

613
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:52,805
you want to see by your sister

614
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:53,806
What did you do?

615
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:54,807
The kicks take the

616
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:56,986
and are taken

617
00:27:56,987 --> 00:27:59,698
But she was re-in fart

618
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:00,747
and made shit

619
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:01,748
Not like no one woke up

620
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:03,375
I was screaming in the hall

621
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:07,188
Wau ... well, I can not make much fuss, I think

622
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:10,476
this is what kids do today

623
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:12,859
go to a bowling alley, know any kid

624
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,860
take them home and ...

625
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,996
Garchan ... the kitchen counter

626
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:18,300
So that's what they do today.

627
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:19,301
Absolutely, I read in a magazine

628
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:21,595
Are not really being of any help

629
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:23,949
That's my sister

630
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,569
and do not need that image in my mind-pad

631
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:30,822
No, I'm not angry

632
00:28:30,823 --> 00:28:33,118
Why should she not feel at home?

633
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,778
Been here ... 12 hours ...

634
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,052
Never eat breakfast on the counter ...

635
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:40,431
then, all right

636
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,400
Now, seriously

637
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:44,556
maybe I become puritanical,

638
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,234
but I think bringing a strange,

639
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:51,718
the first night in a strange house

640
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,596
is a little ... promiscuous? I must say ...

641
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:38,236
Even as you could not sleep

642
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:40,466
in the midst of this madness last night

643
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:42,942
It was a bizarre appearance

644
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:47,078
you almost tear your head with a baseball bat

645
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,488
I guess you were protecting me!

646
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,309
I did not know who was!, Listen to noises

647
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,984
I figured that someone had entered the house

648
00:29:56,706 --> 00:29:57,339
waiting

649
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,978
Speaking of Rome

650
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:04,218
Ah! There she is

651
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,286
Hello

652
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:09,384
Buzzy? ... Hey, so ...

653
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:12,438
these ... very angry about last night ....?

654
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,706
Yes!, If

655
00:30:13,707 --> 00:30:15,530
I'm a little more than angry

656
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,512
Excuse me!, Look, I was half drunk

657
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:19,569
and we were closer to home than his

658
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,207
and I thought it would be more comfortable, or something ...

659
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,803
Then I can ...

660
00:30:24,804 --> 00:30:26,182
I can go back? or ...?

661
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:28,236
Waiting

662
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:32,648
Want to know if its okay to stay with us

663
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:34,072
If-If welcome back!

664
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:35,574
Are you sure? - Aha

665
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:40,226
Hey! good news,

666
00:30:40,227 --> 00:30:43,401
You're welcome back

667
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:45,366
I'm going to work in a while

668
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:46,367
but when I get home

669
00:30:46,368 --> 00:30:49,545
We need to have a looong talk on

670
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:51,637
"Rules", if you stay with us

671
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:52,638
for a little while

672
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:54,312
Ok.

673
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,313
secure a long talk ...

674
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:09,223
When I go crazy, I only see red

675
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:12,253
I do not think I react

676
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:16,719
I inherited from my father, was very impulsive

677
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:24,193
and often exciting because things happen so

678
00:31:24,194 --> 00:31:25,859
others, only shitty situations

679
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,404
Good day

680
00:31:31,408 --> 00:31:33,746
No, I did not

681
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:36,903
was supposed to do with you

682
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:39,641
Why?

683
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:43,093
We can try to start again, shall we?

684
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:48,410
I know! but I made a mistake!

685
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:50,657
I was wrong

686
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,449
I did not think about your upcoming move to N.Y.

687
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,568
and you'd get married in 10 months

688
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:56,269
I thought maybe we would have another chance

689
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,137
I was wrong

690
00:31:58,138 --> 00:31:59,817
Is that what you are playing?

691
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,345
I made a mistake and was wrong

692
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:07,636
Ok ... well

693
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,605
if you're 100 percent sure

694
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:13,290
that are ready to go

695
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,712
and say goodbye forever

696
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:16,828
then I'm leaving tomorrow

697
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:18,221
I go back to L.A.

698
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:19,132
and leave you in peace

699
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:21,535
but if so, call me, ok?

700
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:39,390
Hey! Buzzy are you?

701
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,343
No, no, it's me

702
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:42,932
Hey!

703
00:32:46,495 --> 00:32:49,577
Yes, yes, shameful return, right?

704
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:50,909
It happens to all

705
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,678
Also, you have fun?

706
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,324
It was the best night, you know?

707
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:58,462
Oh, Buzzy told me you took one of my coats

708
00:32:58,463 --> 00:33:00,639
Oh ... shit ... shit!

709
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,649
I should leave it somewhere

710
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,650
the "left somewhere"?

711
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:08,451
Do you remember where?
somewhere we can call?

712
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:12,406
No, not where it was

713
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,306
But maybe ... you can replace it?

714
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:15,578
was very expensive?

715
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:17,558
It was ... yes

716
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,559
Hey ... ok, fine

717
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,758
We are happy you are here

718
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,554
There are a couple of things you can do

719
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:24,555
that would be helpful

720
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:26,147
and the first would

721
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:28,961
not use as many towels when you shower

722
00:33:28,962 --> 00:33:31,402
a lot because I hate washing

723
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,636
and the other thing is ...

724
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,528
if you can avoid bringing home strange guys

725
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:38,468
would be great

726
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:40,271
Buzzy told you?

727
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:43,681
Yes ... yes, yes, of course

728
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:46,463
Oh! ok

729
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:48,919
Well, first of all

730
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,689
so forgive me for towels

731
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,641
I thought they were there to be used

732
00:33:53,642 --> 00:33:55,222
and then ...

733
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,008
You never had a night of pop?

734
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:02,269
Yes, yes ... of course it is.

735
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:07,124
I do not want strangers in my apartment

736
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,125
late at night, if that's okay

737
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:10,288
understood

738
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:16,488
I have to hit me a shower

739
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,650
and ... I'm not too dry

740
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:21,754
Sorry, there are some water here?

741
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:27,224
Perfect

742
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,191
They saw that, right?

743
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:39,192
was as hostile ...!

744
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:40,861
I opened the door in my face!

745
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:41,862
just trying to be nice

746
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:46,065
... And she did not like

747
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:47,735
Ok ...

748
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:50,169
It's official ... I do not like it

749
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,025
I know I was a guacha

750
00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:54,614
I have this hangover from hell,

751
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:56,078
I get home

752
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,674
and the first thing I get is what the towels

753
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:01,503
Who the hell cares about towels?

754
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,585
They broke my heart last night!

755
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:05,898
To be clear,

756
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:09,176
I had uncontrolled nights before I got married

757
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:19,083
Hi, I need to talk

758
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:25,694
Hey! 'Hello

759
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:30,138
Hey, my love, by chance this Buzzy at home?

760
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:32,208
No, Max is training

761
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:33,771
Ok, I just wanted checkearlo

762
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:35,692
I do not believe a word these days Max

763
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:37,239
Heart, listen,

764
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,304
Buzzy I mention something about Max

765
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,305
cheating on ...

766
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,942
No! happening?

767
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:44,365
I would say if he knew?

768
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,159
Yeah, right! could not hide a secret

769
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
to me.

770
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:48,968
do not know, Katie is half naive

771
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:49,969
men know

772
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,115
they do not share that shit

773
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,343
Marsha! you are my sister!

774
00:35:53,344 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm his wife!

775
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:57,629
Want a drink?

776
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,753
If water, please

777
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,827
When I graduated from college

778
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,893
I was married to Max, we met at school

779
00:36:05,894 --> 00:36:08,072
and had a son shortly after

780
00:36:08,073 --> 00:36:09,073
It is he who goes to school

781
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,280
For me, I am involved in the life of John

782
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:18,841
I mean, when a mother is

783
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:20,056
is very involved with the kids

784
00:36:20,057 --> 00:36:21,057
Max and I think also

785
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:24,117
now I feel all the passion

786
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:27,584
to my son has to focus on other things

787
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,753
I am a little worried about you and Buzzy

788
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,516
Oh, Marsha not start, please!

789
00:36:31,517 --> 00:36:33,334
how well you know her?

790
00:36:33,335 --> 00:36:35,108
I say that this wedding rush

791
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,607
way too fast for my taste

792
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:38,460
I'm fine, thanks

793
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:40,783
Trust me, one never really knows

794
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:42,758
I mean, I'm with Max always

795
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:44,159
and still do not know

796
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,875
Why insist on doing this, Marsha?

797
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:48,200
It turns me off, but my husband

798
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:48,974
and I love it

799
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:50,251
Heart, I tell you something:

800
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:51,911
Why do not you said

801
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:53,746
that his sister would come and stay with pc?

802
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:55,006
Is not it strange?

803
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:56,562
No, is a hanging

804
00:36:56,563 --> 00:36:58,006
called 3 months ago

805
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,007
saying that came

806
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,008
and did not call to confirm!

807
00:37:02,363 --> 00:37:04,074
Do you remember what Dad said?

808
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:06,300
Better to ask forgiveness, ask for permission

809
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:08,502
I feel that these projecting

810
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:10,037
your relationship in mine

811
00:37:10,038 --> 00:37:12,347
No! no! -Something happened to Max?

812
00:37:12,348 --> 00:37:15,736
Today I am hypersensitive to dishonesty

813
00:37:15,723 --> 00:37:17,627
I can smell the 1 km

814
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:21,109
Why be afraid to tell

815
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,107
her sister was coming to stay?

816
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,622
I do not know ... maybe, thought you were going to say no

817
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:28,135
or maybe he knew it was a pain in the ass

818
00:37:28,136 --> 00:37:30,977
I do not know, the point is he knew and did not tell you

819
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:32,453
you have to start dwelling on these

820
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:34,510
little lies, that's what they do men lie

821
00:37:34,511 --> 00:37:36,762
Yeah, I know, and maybe you're right

822
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:39,175
Maybe I said because it did not want you to know

823
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:41,284
the very slutty and it's busted

824
00:37:41,285 --> 00:37:42,285
his sister

825
00:37:42,286 --> 00:37:44,990
Last night, brought home a guy at 3 am

826
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:47,103
and it was trincando on my kitchen counter

827
00:37:47,104 --> 00:37:50,549
and also I banque ... more or less

828
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,563
Until today when I try to talk

829
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,326
and became the canchera

830
00:37:56,635 --> 00:37:58,251
As if asking something unreasonable

831
00:37:58,252 --> 00:37:59,714
to ask strangers not to bring home

832
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:01,862
Look, the guests are always a problem

833
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,737
but, when a family member, as a

834
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:07,658
English whore old mother

835
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:10,664
or a sister trolita of Los Angeles

836
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:12,466
then it is a bad, bad idea

837
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:13,467
and that said Buzzy?

838
00:38:13,468 --> 00:38:15,390
I did not tell even

839
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:17,133
not to say, not as telling

840
00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:20,080
when your sister going to my fucking house?

841
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:22,367
I thought you said you could tell all

842
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:24,116
Yes, I can!, But this is different

843
00:38:24,117 --> 00:38:26,110
is his sister, and was always sympathetic

844
00:38:26,111 --> 00:38:27,683
with Dara and you ...

845
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:29,868
I?

846
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:31,921
Why is understanding me?

847
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:35,657
no ... you know ... the 'He' what '?

848
00:38:35,658 --> 00:38:37,448
He thinks you do not like

849
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,983
Well ... not

850
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,714
At least it is smart to recognize

851
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:44,749
Why, did you?

852
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,138
I did nothing ... look at you to you yourself

853
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:49,360
're a desirable woman

854
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,511
're beautiful, successful

855
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:53,161
these wealthy

856
00:38:54,182 --> 00:38:56,216
not, was in a hurry

857
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:57,803
to put a ring on your finger

858
00:38:57,804 --> 00:39:00,658
A ring that paid you

859
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:03,273
I think Marsha believes that

860
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,336
I'm not good enough for her sister

861
00:39:05,337 --> 00:39:07,702
We come from different worlds

862
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:12,900
No ... she never opened me

863
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:16,468
and it's funny, it grabs with Max

864
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:20,496
because it was he who introduced us.

865
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:22,221
she hates me!

866
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:23,552
I do not hate you!

867
00:39:23,553 --> 00:39:25,485
although it may be that this no longer
"Madly in love"

868
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:27,668
I have to get away from this marriage

869
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:30,133
I told you not want to hear this bullshit

870
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,134
Ok? I do not want to go home

871
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,173
and having Katie wondering

872
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:35,764
about pc, and forced me to lie

873
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:37,647
Tell her the truth!

874
00:39:37,648 --> 00:39:39,396
Seriously!, Finish with this

875
00:39:39,397 --> 00:39:40,397
and it is for you!

876
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:42,365
Yo! I have to see me

877
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:44,236
When you said "18 years is a success"

878
00:39:44,237 --> 00:39:46,026
It's true!

879
00:39:46,027 --> 00:39:47,681
John is in school

880
00:39:47,682 --> 00:39:49,403
does not need us closer together

881
00:39:49,404 --> 00:39:50,757
Do me a favor, okay?

882
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:52,405
I upload this shit to me, yeah?

883
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:54,039
I was trying to soften

884
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,253
what was becoming

885
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:56,254
in a very uncomfortable conversation

886
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:57,673
Yes! but what you said was true!

887
00:39:57,674 --> 00:39:58,977
Forget I said it!

888
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:00,610
I can not forget!

889
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:02,243
I ended

890
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:03,410
I'll ask Marsha divorce

891
00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:03,887
No, you do not

892
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:04,888
No need to bother your wife

893
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:07,307
I do, somehow, responsible

894
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:10,076
for planting the seed in your head sick

895
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,077
that you are going to divorce!

896
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:12,407
This the girl in the study

897
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:14,511
I swear by God that is beautiful

898
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,651
I do not want to hear this boludez

899
00:40:16,652 --> 00:40:18,650
I cogermela everywhere

900
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:21,058
Back to work, you're a fucking skeleton

901
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:24,762
The more I give to this

902
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,717
Hello

903
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:37,096
had hoped that you would know

904
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:40,116
Listen, sorry about last night

905
00:40:42,677 --> 00:40:44,669
No, nothing happened with that guy

906
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,384
was trying to make you jealous

907
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:51,130
wanted to come running after me

908
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:52,263
and tell me I do not go

909
00:40:52,264 --> 00:40:53,580
but you did not

910
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,582
No, I will not leave you alone

911
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:57,970
because I'm in love with you

912
00:40:57,971 --> 00:40:59,473
and I want to be with you

913
00:40:59,474 --> 00:41:02,996
No you can see me for one night

914
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:05,048
one night

915
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:08,619
I do not care ... where you want

916
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,105
We can go to a hotel, no matter

917
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:16,150
See you then

918
00:41:26,452 --> 00:41:27,876
If, if, if ...

919
00:41:28,242 --> 00:41:29,531
Hello

920
00:41:29,532 --> 00:41:30,532
Hi, Dara

921
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:32,800
Who?

922
00:41:33,341 --> 00:41:34,889
Dara Flynn, who are you?

923
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,919
I'm Linda's sister Buzzy

924
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,058
Who are you?

925
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:40,808
Sorry, I'm the ex-husband of Katie

926
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:44,001
I have this vacuum that had to restore

927
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:44,993
let me go?

928
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:47,176
Oh, apparently I have no permission

929
00:41:47,177 --> 00:41:48,852
let men of the department

930
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:51,732
so, better bass and give it to me

931
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:53,661
Barbaro, thanks

932
00:41:53,662 --> 00:41:55,303
Ok, give me 5 minutes

933
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,540
My nature is my nature

934
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:00,698
I see a beautiful woman

935
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:02,250
react, respond

936
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:03,251
I ask out ...

937
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:08,736
pass

938
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:14,003
it's almost like ... hello, good afternoon

939
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,050
Concerned?

940
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:20,829
felt in the stomach

941
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,637
it's almost like being hurt

942
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:25,967
lies with them

943
00:42:25,968 --> 00:42:28,650
I need tenderness

944
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:33,312
she has the style Blanche Dubois

945
00:42:33,313 --> 00:42:38,001
someone who relies on the kindness of strangers

946
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:39,002
figuratively speaking

947
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:45,107
I was excited and a little nervous

948
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:46,797
to meet Miles

949
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,403
and there was beer in the fridge

950
00:42:48,404 --> 00:42:51,925
and thought it was okay to go for a couple of free drinks

951
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:56,307
Katie never understood the temperament of an artist

952
00:42:58,262 --> 00:43:01,728
was never emotionally in tune

953
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:02,981
to really understand where it came from I

954
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:05,790
Yes, they are so organized

955
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,369
like to have everything in order and so

956
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,542
There is no room for spontaneity

957
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:13,035
Yes! Yes! I want to take me in your life

958
00:43:13,036 --> 00:43:14,036
wild ride

959
00:43:14,037 --> 00:43:16,223
The road of excess leads to the gates of wisdom

960
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:22,583
but do not drink ... and pass the gates of wisdom

961
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:25,005
For me as an artist, I feel ...

962
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:27,625
is true? is more honest?

963
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:31,593
I think it's important, you know?

964
00:43:31,594 --> 00:43:35,120
what kind of artist are you?

965
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:37,830
I'm an actor, stage actor

966
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:39,849
Ever heard talk of Mizner?

967
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,718
No, it's a writer?

968
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,764
No, no ... Mizner was ...

969
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:46,765
as decribir at Mizner

970
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:52,238
It was a God, of the buildings

971
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,141
Give me a second, do a little exercise

972
00:43:56,142 --> 00:43:58,916
Sacudite all, try to relax

973
00:43:58,917 --> 00:43:59,917
Focus

974
00:44:02,653 --> 00:44:04,219
Look into my eyes, ok?

975
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:07,720
Inspire

976
00:44:07,718 --> 00:44:11,011
and allowed him to leave, exit

977
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:12,012
at any time

978
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:16,291
How to talk?

979
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:18,516
As talking, perfect

980
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:32,586
Wau, this is intense!

981
00:44:33,948 --> 00:44:35,302
Wau, this is intense

982
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:39,272
He was flirting with her?

983
00:44:39,273 --> 00:44:41,436
is hard to say

984
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:44,501
as an artist, what I felt was a kind of connection

985
00:44:44,502 --> 00:44:46,757
was a spontaneous reaction

986
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:51,490
and her eyes seemed to be appropriate
for the moment

987
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:55,694
Oh, oh, there it is

988
00:44:55,695 --> 00:45:01,326
Hey! I found Katie's ex-husband, Dara

989
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:03,590
Dara? where you found it?

990
00:45:03,591 --> 00:45:08,164
Here. He came to leave the vacuum

991
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:10,931
But ... do not leave it up

992
00:45:10,932 --> 00:45:12,896
Katie because I said I can not let

993
00:45:12,897 --> 00:45:14,936
strangers in the department

994
00:45:14,937 --> 00:45:16,062
Then you talk to Kate

995
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:17,531
And I was a little brash with me

996
00:45:17,532 --> 00:45:19,298
Do me a favor, do not talk nonsense Katie

997
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,223
is being very generous leaving you be

998
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:23,035
Yes! there would be no problem between us

999
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:25,054
if you had not told you what happened last night

1000
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,348
Of course he had to tell!

1001
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,136
It is my wife, and this is your department!

1002
00:45:28,137 --> 00:45:30,799
Yes! but I came with all his judgments

1003
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,668
and do not need your blame

1004
00:45:32,669 --> 00:45:33,880
Seriously, you can blame her?

1005
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:35,708
with all your performance in the kitchen ...

1006
00:45:35,709 --> 00:45:38,079
Well! that's what I need not tell you!

1007
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:39,483
Well good ...

1008
00:45:39,484 --> 00:45:40,484
which is supposed to mean?

1009
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:43,417
Do not you remember how it all was when we were kids?

1010
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:45,527
You brought a new girl every night

1011
00:45:45,528 --> 00:45:47,658
and dad harangued and complimented?

1012
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:49,254
Yes, I was in college

1013
00:45:49,255 --> 00:45:50,886
and it was acceptable behavior,

1014
00:45:50,887 --> 00:45:53,503
you're an adult, staying in this department

1015
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,906
Listen, I'm not angry!

1016
00:45:55,907 --> 00:45:58,179
and I'm not judging

1017
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,180
She is going to break the balls

1018
00:45:59,181 --> 00:46:02,062
if this behavior continues

1019
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:04,529
Look, I'm happy you're here

1020
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,400
miss you, and it's great to see you

1021
00:46:06,401 --> 00:46:08,619
but please do me a favor

1022
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,756
and just ... calm down a bit while you stay

1023
00:46:11,757 --> 00:46:14,146
Ok ... ok

1024
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:15,580
I'll calm down a little

1025
00:46:19,546 --> 00:46:21,707
Oh ... I have to tell

1026
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,008
I lost the shelter of Katie

1027
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:27,377
Lost you grabbed your coat?

1028
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:29,703
Yes, but I said it would pay

1029
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,884
Trust me, you could not afford that coat

1030
00:46:31,885 --> 00:46:34,229
I got it ...

1031
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,910
I appreciate that you said you find it

1032
00:46:40,481 --> 00:46:42,025
Told our story ...?

1033
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:46,526
We met ... Max was training at the gym

1034
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,514
listen to me ... my sister

1035
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,707
this very good

1036
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:55,515
said the other day who was horny

1037
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:57,874
that you want this ...?

1038
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:00,091
Why is your sister telling you walked

1039
00:47:00,092 --> 00:47:01,794
how hot was it?

1040
00:47:01,795 --> 00:47:04,040
No, he told Marsha, Marsha told me my

1041
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,837
Where's the catch?

1042
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:08,035
if she is so good, why is single?

1043
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:10,705
Obviously I thought there was something wrong with you

1044
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:13,136
you were mentally unstable or something

1045
00:47:13,137 --> 00:47:15,281
but luckily did not have anything bad

1046
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:18,182
Bought on the first date!

1047
00:47:18,183 --> 00:47:21,383
We started dating

1048
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:25,428
and soon it got serious,

1049
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:29,581
I became infatuated, I proposed to her one night

1050
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:32,177
they were returning from dinner

1051
00:47:32,178 --> 00:47:33,917
You say?

1052
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:35,528
If

1053
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:37,506
I said that if

1054
00:47:37,507 --> 00:47:38,128
and here we are

1055
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:39,345
here we

1056
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:43,619
She was pregnant

1057
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,382
it was a big surprise

1058
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:49,609
and I remember him at the show

1059
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,466
we went in a tiny pub

1060
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:56,011
and wrote that song

1061
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:58,061
for me,

1062
00:47:58,062 --> 00:47:59,417
yes! did!

1063
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,612
and proposed to me right there

1064
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:03,308
opposite worldwide.

1065
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:07,004
I remember being totally scared

1066
00:48:07,005 --> 00:48:09,704
with the "project" of parenting, and ... not ...

1067
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:12,950
it all happened very fast

1068
00:48:12,951 --> 00:48:13,951
but still sweet

1069
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:16,292
those were good times

1070
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:17,492
If ...

1071
00:48:23,704 --> 00:48:25,200
She was upset ...

1072
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:26,579
said, "we can go???"

1073
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,926
Actually I said stronger

1074
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:32,107
Forgive me, I can not by meeting and

1075
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:34,269
If they insist on talking in this way at dinner

1076
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:36,426
I mean, it's fine in the locker room,

1077
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:38,018
there is acceptable

1078
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:39,019
but it bothers me

1079
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,549
Please Marsha! calm down!

1080
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,213
You look like an old woman!

1081
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:46,362
People talk about sex and whore at dinner

1082
00:48:46,363 --> 00:48:47,900
ok?, leave aside

1083
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:49,199
No, I will not drop it

1084
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,200
because I find it offensive,

1085
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:54,776
on the other hand, you called me an "old"?

1086
00:48:54,777 --> 00:48:56,939
No, I said "looked like" an old

1087
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,544
Please explain to me rather as "look" an old

1088
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:01,231
So what say you ...

1089
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:05,355
Is that everything and everyone bother you at all times

1090
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:08,965
Everything?-Yes! I like walking on eggshells

1091
00:49:08,966 --> 00:49:11,136
terrified of what I can tell you you will fall ill

1092
00:49:11,137 --> 00:49:12,571
That's not true!

1093
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:14,098
Katie, you feel like that with me?

1094
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:15,013
No, not at all

1095
00:49:15,014 --> 00:49:17,232
See! Buzzy and clearly not

1096
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:20,469
but speak in front of me like a gentleman

1097
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,988
Knight? ... That'll never happen!

1098
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:26,042
I think the only person you're terrified

1099
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:27,719
You know Marsha? - What?

1100
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,480
You lost the taste for life

1101
00:49:30,481 --> 00:49:31,481
The taste

1102
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:35,098
The taste!, Yeah! The fun, joy, happiness

1103
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,099
all gone!

1104
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,827
Chota and complaining

1105
00:49:37,828 --> 00:49:39,915
So your personality became

1106
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:40,916
I'm sick!

1107
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:43,022
Nothing you say fun

1108
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:45,120
Do not even remember the last time you laughed

1109
00:49:45,121 --> 00:49:46,121
When was the last time you laughed?

1110
00:49:46,122 --> 00:49:47,898
Seriously, when was it?

1111
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:49,142
Want to know? - Yes!

1112
00:49:49,143 --> 00:49:50,564
Ok, when I saw you trying pathetically

1113
00:49:50,565 --> 00:49:51,978
get up to that girl in the study

1114
00:49:51,979 --> 00:49:53,535
I turned hilarious

1115
00:49:53,536 --> 00:49:55,378
You should have seen! being "charming"

1116
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:57,843
I re-shit of laughter

1117
00:49:57,844 --> 00:50:00,211
Hey! why not leave it there, eh?

1118
00:50:00,212 --> 00:50:03,219
Buzzy! contales of those freaks you train at your gym

1119
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,220
is very funny

1120
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:07,280
Ok ... let me see ...

1121
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:10,029
This this Chabon, Aaron, Wall Street

1122
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,442
that embodies his maid ...

1123
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:13,685
that's funny!

1124
00:50:13,686 --> 00:50:16,368
I want a divorce

1125
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:18,447
Yes! ... No ... you know what? ...

1126
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,797
Buzzy, you're right

1127
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:22,869
were 18, and we consider it a success

1128
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,656
I involucres ...

1129
00:50:24,657 --> 00:50:27,174
I say that? I do not remember having said

1130
00:50:27,175 --> 00:50:29,553
Is over, right here

1131
00:50:31,022 --> 00:50:32,358
Well, that sounds like music to my ears

1132
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:35,650
If? well then!

1133
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:36,517
but I stay with the department

1134
00:50:36,518 --> 00:50:38,801
Okay! I go to sleep to study

1135
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,149
Great, "perfect"

1136
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,075
Max, Max! e-e-e-wait! wait!

1137
00:50:42,076 --> 00:50:44,619
what happened?, go get it!

1138
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,095
Ask anything!

1139
00:50:46,096 --> 00:50:49,049
I have ... to deal with my sister ... then ...

1140
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,077
Great ...

1141
00:50:51,078 --> 00:50:54,199
Sorry ... I'm fine

1142
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,486
pc is what awaits

1143
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,612
Yes! I think 18 is a super-successful

1144
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:01,479
My first marriage lasted 6 years

1145
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,295
yours, how much? 4 years?

1146
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:05,300
Get to 18???

1147
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:08,437
I think they did a job from hell

1148
00:51:08,438 --> 00:51:09,596
Just out of curiosity

1149
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:11,346
future as we see us?

1150
00:51:11,347 --> 00:51:13,942
I want more than 18,

1151
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:15,584
I want forever

1152
00:51:15,585 --> 00:51:18,656
is that what you imagine, but ...-Yeah, me too!

1153
00:51:18,657 --> 00:51:20,077
When I said ... "I do"

1154
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:23,818
Yes! I totally agree

1155
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:26,494
but, 18, say, if we were to 18

1156
00:51:26,495 --> 00:51:28,706
'd both be very happy

1157
00:51:33,269 --> 00:51:35,205
Why am I back here?

1158
00:51:35,206 --> 00:51:38,160
mmm ... I think

1159
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:41,539
to learn that he married

1160
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,566
was ...

1161
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,675
motivating factor, probably

1162
00:51:47,431 --> 00:51:50,474
It made me really want to see what

1163
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:52,153
and go after it

1164
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,191
And one for me ...

1165
00:52:08,303 --> 00:52:09,295
Ok

1166
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:14,156
Health-Health

1167
00:52:22,241 --> 00:52:24,048
than another?

1168
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:25,493
a more

1169
00:52:51,256 --> 00:52:52,889
Miss you

1170
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:05,551
I want to put a song for you

1171
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:06,552
I think you'll like

1172
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:10,130
we

1173
00:53:20,912 --> 00:53:22,343
good!

1174
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:24,952
you remember?

1175
00:53:28,922 --> 00:53:30,970
Dale, you want to dance

1176
00:53:30,971 --> 00:53:32,284
I know you want!

1177
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:35,090
Come on!

1178
00:54:03,311 --> 00:54:04,912
Seguis love with my

1179
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:06,680
So what?

1180
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:09,078
it does not matter

1181
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,345
Of course it matters

1182
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:18,869
I brought you something

1183
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:22,822
That?

1184
00:54:22,823 --> 00:54:25,381
You have to wait and see

1185
00:54:25,382 --> 00:54:26,382
not go anywhere, ok?

1186
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:33,487
Ok I'm here-

1187
00:54:41,607 --> 00:54:45,768
Men are so predictable ...

1188
00:54:45,769 --> 00:54:50,130
if you use your sexuality in the right way

1189
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:51,988
then you can get them to do

1190
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,848
almost everything you want to do

1191
00:54:59,545 --> 00:55:02,353
Hey guys, did not think they would be still here

1192
00:55:02,354 --> 00:55:07,020
We're going to have a few drinks, if you want to come ...

1193
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:08,155
What, now?

1194
00:55:08,156 --> 00:55:09,941
Yes!

1195
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:10,702
Come with us!

1196
00:55:10,703 --> 00:55:11,703
If?

1197
00:55:11,704 --> 00:55:15,456
Yes! ... Uh ... 'Give,' Ok!

1198
00:55:15,457 --> 00:55:18,691
I can drink ... actually, you know?

1199
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:21,068
I invite you!, who do you think?

1200
00:55:22,957 --> 00:55:25,829
My God! I can not believe what just happened!

1201
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,794
Divorce! ... At dinner? ... How?

1202
00:55:29,795 --> 00:55:32,825
I will take another glass of wine, shall we?

1203
00:55:32,826 --> 00:55:35,881
Si-Si ... thought they were really happy

1204
00:55:35,882 --> 00:55:38,306
Really? 'If,' why you thought they were happy

1205
00:55:38,307 --> 00:55:40,251
Never saw them laughing

1206
00:55:40,252 --> 00:55:42,531
never say anything cornered

1207
00:55:42,532 --> 00:55:44,590
No, no! in the beginning,

1208
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,962
years before knew

1209
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:47,223
when they were still with Johnny

1210
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:49,767
were like ... never saw a couple so in love

1211
00:55:49,768 --> 00:55:51,600
The way he looked

1212
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:53,769
buy her flowers every day!

1213
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,248
That when he was 18 years ago?

1214
00:55:56,249 --> 00:55:58,444
Why did you say your marriage was a success?

1215
00:55:58,445 --> 00:56:00,267
Look, I was trying to soften

1216
00:56:00,268 --> 00:56:01,886
"Other" uncomfortable dinner

1217
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:05,906
God! known to have problems

1218
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:08,284
but I thought they were any problems as

1219
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,152
I had no idea

1220
00:56:10,153 --> 00:56:13,181
and you? you noticed?

1221
00:56:13,182 --> 00:56:14,905
No. .. no ...

1222
00:56:14,906 --> 00:56:16,752
not really

1223
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,490
Not really ..??

1224
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:20,622
Sometimes ...-What?

1225
00:56:20,623 --> 00:56:25,539
Sometimes in the gym, Max spoke she pests

1226
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,708
I thought they were boludeces,

1227
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:30,045
most bad-mouth their wives

1228
00:56:30,046 --> 00:56:32,093
You talk plagues me in the gym?

1229
00:56:32,094 --> 00:56:34,443
No, not pests of you

1230
00:56:34,444 --> 00:56:36,663
where this is going? I will not badmouth you

1231
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:38,768
for at least 2 months ... or so

1232
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:39,769
Cheers-health

1233
00:56:41,526 --> 00:56:43,471
You're a "prince" ...

1234
00:56:43,472 --> 00:56:46,151
she told me something ...

1235
00:56:47,034 --> 00:56:50,173
look ... I did not know

1236
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:51,174
I was going to ask for a divorce at dinner!

1237
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:54,137
We promised to tell all

1238
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:56,454
and now, tell me to the worst

1239
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:59,395
I know everything, have no fear

1240
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:03,312
I agree ... in the future I'll tell you what you know

1241
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:06,015
Because I was blind at the restaurant

1242
00:57:06,016 --> 00:57:08,676
was a holy shit ...

1243
00:57:08,677 --> 00:57:11,539
Understood ... understood loud and clear

1244
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,099
Ok?

1245
00:57:20,352 --> 00:57:21,975
I think that relationships work

1246
00:57:21,976 --> 00:57:23,631
you have to be completely honest

1247
00:57:23,632 --> 00:57:26,875
count everything, even the smallest detail

1248
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,510
I agree to some extent

1249
00:57:29,511 --> 00:57:32,305
there are certain "things"

1250
00:57:32,306 --> 00:57:34,475
that, frankly, is better

1251
00:57:34,476 --> 00:57:36,492
silent-If?

1252
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:38,509
Like what?

1253
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,351
Well, I do not want to hear about

1254
00:57:40,352 --> 00:57:42,663
my deepest, darkest thoughts

1255
00:57:42,664 --> 00:57:44,128
I can sometimes get to have

1256
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:47,347
Yes, I want ... I'm telling you all

1257
00:57:47,348 --> 00:57:50,510
Bue ... say ... that was me!

1258
00:57:50,511 --> 00:57:54,794
sexual fantasy that you got a "temporary"

1259
00:57:54,795 --> 00:57:57,907
for example, 2 to 1, with two types of the pizzeria

1260
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:00,104
I do not want to hear-I have no such fantasies

1261
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:02,981
two types in the pizzeria, if you?

1262
00:58:02,982 --> 00:58:06,526
No! I have not the fantasy

1263
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:09,742
the girl in the Starbucks not so bad ...

1264
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:15,429
as I said! better beware those things!

1265
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:27,204
Wow ... you look amazing

1266
00:58:28,988 --> 00:58:31,656
Why did not you say "yes" when I asked you

1267
00:58:31,657 --> 00:58:33,059
Ask me now

1268
00:58:34,452 --> 00:58:37,399
Ask me again, now

1269
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,808
You know? were the only thing I really wanted

1270
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:41,988
could we be so happy together

1271
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:44,244
We can still be happy together

1272
00:58:44,245 --> 00:58:47,511
How could we? if I am already married

1273
00:58:47,512 --> 00:58:50,423
Divorciate!, Who gives a fuck?!

1274
00:58:50,424 --> 00:58:52,490
if you still love me

1275
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:53,944
I can not

1276
00:58:53,945 --> 00:58:56,162
Why not?! if you were not even

1277
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:58,408
married a couple of weeks?

1278
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,058
people get divorced every day!

1279
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:04,039
Fuck it, you do not understand

1280
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,534
We're having a baby

1281
00:59:06,535 --> 00:59:09,480
why I married such a hurry

1282
00:59:09,481 --> 00:59:11,688
I'll have a baby ...

1283
00:59:14,222 --> 00:59:18,038
What? ...-In a few weeks

1284
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:19,039
I will be father

1285
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:48,679
I am angry with Linda

1286
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,903
because he said he wanted to be with me now!

1287
00:59:50,904 --> 00:59:52,150
but it is too late.

1288
00:59:52,151 --> 00:59:54,858
I asked, I gave my heart

1289
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:55,859
and she did not accept

1290
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:04,364
I wanted to spend time with Linda

1291
01:00:07,532 --> 01:00:10,948
and I'm happy as things happened,

1292
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:11,949
could not live with myself

1293
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:17,056
know ... we're talking ...

1294
01:00:17,057 --> 01:00:20,213
Yes! three wet towels lying on the floor

1295
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:23,435
Touch them 'Look, I used that towel

1296
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:26,439
No! you always colgás towels

1297
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,862
Do you mean? that she purposely shot the towels

1298
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:32,611
on the bathroom floor, yes, yes, 'Why would I?

1299
01:00:32,612 --> 01:00:34,842
Because I asked him to cool him not to,

1300
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:37,309
and clearly does not like being told what to do

1301
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,388
I think you are putting a little paranoid

1302
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:42,621
but, look, I'll wash the towels

1303
01:00:42,622 --> 01:00:44,164
My love is not for towels

1304
01:00:44,165 --> 01:00:47,976
but we could put a date to go?

1305
01:00:50,123 --> 01:00:51,647
And .. what is it supposed to say?

1306
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,905
Ask about plans to stay!

1307
01:00:53,906 --> 01:00:57,050
and then to stay sugerile least

1308
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:58,051
not so long

1309
01:01:00,071 --> 01:01:02,804
Thursday you fair?

1310
01:01:02,805 --> 01:01:04,960
Until Thursday I feel great, thanks

1311
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:07,216
Now, I'm going to shower

1312
01:01:09,713 --> 01:01:11,961
I'm going to wash ...

1313
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:16,491
My sister is swollen balls sometimes

1314
01:01:16,492 --> 01:01:20,561
Buzzy's sister is
completely on another level

1315
01:01:22,893 --> 01:01:24,944
It tests the patience of the saints

1316
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:27,973
This kind of boludeces are those types

1317
01:01:27,974 --> 01:01:29,794
not bancan

1318
01:01:29,795 --> 01:01:32,697
Who cares if you lost a coat

1319
01:01:32,698 --> 01:01:34,017
or someone uses many towels

1320
01:01:34,018 --> 01:01:37,408
At chabones do not care "so much" stuff

1321
01:01:37,409 --> 01:01:40,113
except except encamarte

1322
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:41,114
with an ex-girlfriend of another

1323
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,115
that's probably the only thing that matters

1324
01:02:11,262 --> 01:02:12,354
Hello

1325
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:14,786
Hello

1326
01:02:14,787 --> 01:02:16,299
Pass

1327
01:02:21,643 --> 01:02:23,873
as an actor, you know,

1328
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,473
Live as if the extreme forces

1329
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:27,667
come to a by themselves

1330
01:02:27,668 --> 01:02:29,445
Linda is a pure force

1331
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,770
sheer force

1332
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:34,474
You know what I need?

1333
01:02:34,475 --> 01:02:36,269
that accurate?

1334
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,903
I need a drink

1335
01:02:40,873 --> 01:02:42,928
Sorry, but I have drinks at home

1336
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,019
I have no alcohol at home

1337
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:51,004
What is true

1338
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:53,584
is that if you and I are here

1339
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:54,585
and all the things you see

1340
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:57,861
is all I need to have

1341
01:02:57,862 --> 01:02:58,862
I need no more

1342
01:02:58,863 --> 01:02:59,863
to "focus"

1343
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:09,391
You know that is incredibly sexy

1344
01:03:09,392 --> 01:03:11,376
when you talk and

1345
01:03:13,855 --> 01:03:16,241
I wish we can do this but

1346
01:03:16,242 --> 01:03:18,051
we're like ... "family"

1347
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:20,643
No, no! relatives are not

1348
01:03:20,644 --> 01:03:23,343
No! but you're the sister of my ex-wife

1349
01:03:23,344 --> 01:03:25,711
and this relationship ... Oh, oh -

1350
01:03:25,712 --> 01:03:26,712
I mainly hot ... your brother!

1351
01:03:26,713 --> 01:03:30,479
this, this is not a relationship

1352
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,480
Now, take me to the bedroom,

1353
01:03:43,481 --> 01:03:46,050
or want to talk about it ... mmm?

1354
01:03:50,078 --> 01:03:52,991
We up-Ok!

1355
01:04:04,365 --> 01:04:06,563
No. .. no, no, do not go ..

1356
01:04:06,564 --> 01:04:08,231
is so sad!

1357
01:04:08,232 --> 01:04:09,687
which part?

1358
01:04:09,688 --> 01:04:12,637
Oh ... the whole fucking thing is sad!

1359
01:04:12,638 --> 01:04:14,524
You said 15???

1360
01:04:14,525 --> 01:04:18,300
I was ... with a silver in Hamburg but cost

1361
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:22,427
If ... is your wife going to live up?

1362
01:04:22,428 --> 01:04:24,298
She will live up

1363
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:26,399
I down here in the studio

1364
01:04:26,907 --> 01:04:28,269
You know ...?

1365
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:33,585
15 is muchism time

1366
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:36,001
I'll do something really nice for you

1367
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:40,709
Come on!

1368
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:46,858
Hagomoslo right here ...

1369
01:04:54,286 --> 01:04:57,444
Oh ... that good!

1370
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,206
Are you okay?

1371
01:05:06,675 --> 01:05:07,906
If

1372
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:09,402
you keep on crying

1373
01:05:09,403 --> 01:05:10,403
Not

1374
01:05:10,404 --> 01:05:11,885
want to talk about it?

1375
01:05:13,772 --> 01:05:15,674
Indeed, no

1376
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:18,677
I can ask?

1377
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:26,602
It was just a boy who knew ...

1378
01:05:28,265 --> 01:05:30,510
You have to tell me about it

1379
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:31,511
Why?

1380
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:34,203
To you that you care?

1381
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:47,091
Yes, Linda cried the first time we had sex

1382
01:05:47,092 --> 01:05:51,024
but, and it is true, it usually happen the first time

1383
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:52,855
whatever it is,

1384
01:05:52,856 --> 01:05:55,016
seems to have a strong impact on women

1385
01:05:58,141 --> 01:06:01,428
Baby, it seems she's not coming tonight

1386
01:06:01,429 --> 01:06:03,394
then why not ...

1387
01:06:03,395 --> 01:06:06,280
we do something?

1388
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:08,681
If, 'I think it would be good for us

1389
01:06:08,682 --> 01:06:12,748
What is love, but I do not encourage this evening

1390
01:06:12,749 --> 01:06:15,737
Oh, I can put you in tune?

1391
01:06:21,096 --> 01:06:22,537
I can do it quickly!

1392
01:06:22,538 --> 01:06:25,368
Ha ha! sounds great

1393
01:06:25,369 --> 01:06:27,442
Maybe you can do when she leaves

1394
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:29,666
after Thursday

1395
01:06:32,314 --> 01:06:34,398
Touche

1396
01:06:38,107 --> 01:06:42,806
I do not think that not having sex is a punishment

1397
01:06:42,807 --> 01:06:45,867
see it more as an incentive

1398
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,924
to kick the crap out of my house to his sister

1399
01:06:54,436 --> 01:06:57,546
Guess what? Max was with the mine

1400
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:59,411
last night in the study-what?

1401
01:06:59,412 --> 01:07:01,600
Yes - my God! These kidding

1402
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:04,302
No, no, I hear 'Oh my God!

1403
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:07,781
Yes! I can not be sure, but it was pretty obvious

1404
01:07:07,782 --> 01:07:10,268
My God! is very serious! - I know!

1405
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:12,581
I can not stay in the department

1406
01:07:12,582 --> 01:07:14,316
if these droppings will be sent

1407
01:07:14,317 --> 01:07:16,576
I can stay with you?

1408
01:07:16,577 --> 01:07:19,009
Just for a little while

1409
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,904
Yes, but Buzzy's sister is still with us

1410
01:07:21,905 --> 01:07:24,661
We have no free rooms, you can get you on the couch

1411
01:07:24,662 --> 01:07:26,899
The sofa?

1412
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,281
You remember what I did for you

1413
01:07:30,282 --> 01:07:32,232
when you divorced?

1414
01:07:32,233 --> 01:07:34,100
When you came home and

1415
01:07:34,101 --> 01:07:36,538
contained you every night until you sleep?

1416
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:38,280
You remember?, Yeah!

1417
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:40,068
Makes this trolita on the couch

1418
01:07:43,062 --> 01:07:45,485
When would be good to start dating

1419
01:07:45,486 --> 01:07:46,867
I wait a few months

1420
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:48,640
I know, but you were young and you could afford it

1421
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:53,581
Would have to shave? Brazilian style?

1422
01:07:53,582 --> 01:07:56,605
I want to do is what I did in years

1423
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:59,400
and want to do now ... tonight!

1424
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:03,487
It might be good

1425
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:09,633
I mean, in a way ...

1426
01:08:09,634 --> 01:08:11,530
There are possibilities waiting

1427
01:08:11,531 --> 01:08:14,579
that could be fun, exciting ...

1428
01:08:16,145 --> 01:08:17,553
and ... who knows,

1429
01:08:17,554 --> 01:08:20,468
I'm more mature now and I have more experience

1430
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:37,443
That shit happens here!

1431
01:08:37,444 --> 01:08:39,143
Do not tell me two ... PC!

1432
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:40,144
that this is happening!

1433
01:08:40,145 --> 01:08:42,383
Not what you think - not what you think?

1434
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:44,081
who is this then?

1435
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:45,768
Come with me, we need to talk

1436
01:08:49,003 --> 01:08:50,975
What the hell is it? -What?

1437
01:08:50,976 --> 01:08:54,293
What happens here? - We were walking

1438
01:08:54,294 --> 01:08:55,656
Walking??

1439
01:08:55,657 --> 01:08:57,202
There are 8 million people in this city

1440
01:08:57,203 --> 01:08:58,203
and you have to go with him??

1441
01:08:58,204 --> 01:09:01,337
Listen, I appreciate that you try
be my brother

1442
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:02,899
I'm trying to do shit!

1443
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:03,900
but these like crazy, we talked about yesterday!

1444
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:09,592
I know, I know, but it happened, ok? things happen

1445
01:09:09,593 --> 01:09:11,225
I'm driving the ...

1446
01:09:11,226 --> 01:09:12,818
No, you're not driving a shit

1447
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:14,151
What you do is lie

1448
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:16,024
with my wife's ex

1449
01:09:16,025 --> 01:09:18,329
No, no, I'm sleeping with him

1450
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:20,483
I slept "yesterday" with him, there is a difference

1451
01:09:21,135 --> 01:09:22,729
Obviously I can not talk to you, Hey asshole!

1452
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:26,529
Entendelo, that ends today

1453
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,407
Not going to see more

1454
01:09:28,408 --> 01:09:30,184
No, you do not understand you, I love it!

1455
01:09:30,185 --> 01:09:31,996
love her?! not even know her!

1456
01:09:31,997 --> 01:09:33,396
Fuck me that you talk

1457
01:09:33,397 --> 01:09:35,123
Your sister and I are cut from the same yardstick

1458
01:09:35,124 --> 01:09:36,741
from here, from the guts, Katie and you from here

1459
01:09:36,742 --> 01:09:38,932
head, think

1460
01:09:38,933 --> 01:09:40,853
streamlining all the time

1461
01:09:40,854 --> 01:09:42,890
I do not expect you to understand

1462
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:44,439
You're aware that this asshole

1463
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,133
in love with you?

1464
01:09:46,134 --> 01:09:47,134
That's what I just said 'No, not this!

1465
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:50,414
No! not these! Listen

1466
01:09:50,415 --> 01:09:53,424
're a really sweet guy, but ...

1467
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:56,921
Date around and andate to your house

1468
01:09:58,354 --> 01:10:00,342
You mind if I take my coat, please?

1469
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:01,343
these fucking me?

1470
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:03,068
Devolvele the damn coat

1471
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:11,428
Chau! Come on, we need to talk

1472
01:10:17,744 --> 01:10:19,787
It is clear that you put me

1473
01:10:19,788 --> 01:10:22,074
in a wild storm of shit, yeah?

1474
01:10:22,075 --> 01:10:23,075
So this is what you have to do

1475
01:10:23,076 --> 01:10:25,169
you have to go and tell Katie

1476
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,805
because I'm not going to

1477
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:29,172
Why would anyone have to tell you something???

1478
01:10:29,173 --> 01:10:31,301
I must say, I do not want to tell

1479
01:10:31,302 --> 01:10:33,266
you put us in this situation

1480
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:34,966
so you have to explain it to you

1481
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:36,390
that's what we do

1482
01:10:36,391 --> 01:10:38,310
we tell all, honesty is called

1483
01:10:38,311 --> 01:10:40,974
Really? this idea sounds terrible!

1484
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:43,276
You have to promise me when you return,

1485
01:10:43,277 --> 01:10:45,361
Now I have to go to the gym, you have to tell you!

1486
01:10:45,362 --> 01:10:47,378
if I tell you I will take!

1487
01:10:49,696 --> 01:10:51,160
You should have thought of before

1488
01:10:57,973 --> 01:11:00,461
Hey!, There you are

1489
01:11:00,462 --> 01:11:01,919
Linda, this is my sister Marsha

1490
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,739
Marsha, this is Buzzy's sister, Linda

1491
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:05,355
Nice to meet you

1492
01:11:05,356 --> 01:11:07,746
Nice to meet you at last

1493
01:11:09,861 --> 01:11:11,879
Listen to Katie, I would ...

1494
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,201
I would like to talk to you

1495
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:16,098
if that's okay

1496
01:11:16,099 --> 01:11:18,849
there is something I have to say

1497
01:11:21,062 --> 01:11:22,318
I have to tell you ... ...

1498
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,883
eh ... sorry, we're in the middle

1499
01:11:23,884 --> 01:11:27,147
of a family crisis, right now

1500
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:29,949
My husband left me 18 years ago

1501
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:32,121
Oh no, sorry!

1502
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:34,563
Yes, we need to talk about where they go to sleep

1503
01:11:34,564 --> 01:11:36,124
because I have to spend the couch

1504
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,348
I can not stay in my house

1505
01:11:38,349 --> 01:11:40,283
the-course is still there!

1506
01:11:40,284 --> 01:11:44,642
Yes, because I want to say

1507
01:11:44,643 --> 01:11:47,491
is that today I'm going!

1508
01:11:47,492 --> 01:11:50,256
Are you going? -Yes! 'That's great!

1509
01:11:50,257 --> 01:11:51,257
Thanks Linda!

1510
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:54,448
No, thank you, you were so generous

1511
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:56,972
I do not want to take advantage of your hospitality

1512
01:11:56,973 --> 01:11:59,500
No, no, not really - I'm sure no ...

1513
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:03,877
Well ... I'll pack my things

1514
01:12:03,878 --> 01:12:06,654
you can change the sheets?

1515
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,971
I'm sure that must be changed

1516
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:12,611
Si-Thanks

1517
01:12:12,612 --> 01:12:13,612
Thanks Linda!

1518
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:24,781
Hi, I'm Max

1519
01:12:24,782 --> 01:12:27,137
yes, I do not have session, I wanted to talk

1520
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:28,138
Thanks

1521
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:34,181
That shit thought, pulling the pump

1522
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:35,323
in the middle of dinner

1523
01:12:35,324 --> 01:12:36,914
was not the place for that pedorrada

1524
01:12:36,915 --> 01:12:39,287
I thought not, so I went

1525
01:12:41,962 --> 01:12:43,368
but the sync was amazing

1526
01:12:43,369 --> 01:12:44,762
when I returned to study,

1527
01:12:44,763 --> 01:12:45,763
Vanessa, that girl I told you about

1528
01:12:45,764 --> 01:12:47,581
was still working

1529
01:12:47,582 --> 01:12:50,061
The thing with Max is that it is a poor reflection

1530
01:12:50,062 --> 01:12:51,768
of my ability as a coach

1531
01:12:51,769 --> 01:12:54,313
not gain muscle mass, not weight lost

1532
01:12:54,314 --> 01:12:56,041
all it does is come to the gym

1533
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:57,761
to pelotudear

1534
01:12:57,762 --> 01:13:00,168
All the time I say, do not need a trainer

1535
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:01,169
need a psychiatrist

1536
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,734
I do not want to hear these stories

1537
01:13:03,735 --> 01:13:05,988
okay? so here's the deal

1538
01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:07,611
I think I can not train more

1539
01:13:07,612 --> 01:13:09,643
This is putting me in an uncomfortable position

1540
01:13:09,644 --> 01:13:11,913
I went because I was excited

1541
01:13:11,914 --> 01:13:14,047
I thought I wanted to hear the news

1542
01:13:14,048 --> 01:13:17,166
This guy ... 18 years married, you know,

1543
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:19,142
yesterday sucked me right

1544
01:13:19,143 --> 01:13:21,484
I wanted to tell, share the good news

1545
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:24,469
and I get that I want to train more

1546
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,400
No, I think he understood it all wrong

1547
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:36,555
Hello! I am, I am glad you have not attended

1548
01:13:40,043 --> 01:13:42,175
Just wanted to call ...

1549
01:13:43,835 --> 01:13:47,708
I wish to say this last night

1550
01:13:47,709 --> 01:13:49,920
I just wanted to get out of there

1551
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:52,179
but I wanted to tell you now

1552
01:13:54,562 --> 01:13:59,859
if he had known the situation ...

1553
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:02,687
never have been,

1554
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,844
never have come to N.Y.

1555
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:11,066
I want you to know ... I'm very happy for you

1556
01:14:12,722 --> 01:14:15,698
I think you'll be a great dad

1557
01:14:17,058 --> 01:14:19,904
and I just wanted to call and say goodbye,

1558
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:20,905
bye

1559
01:14:34,947 --> 01:14:37,865
I do not know, I think I have to go

1560
01:14:37,866 --> 01:14:41,096
I think I have to go back to L.A.

1561
01:14:56,736 --> 01:15:00,128
Marsha is a little time with us aquedar

1562
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:02,061
What happened to the other plan?

1563
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:05,627
that you were going to sleep upstairs and Max in the studio?

1564
01:15:05,628 --> 01:15:08,816
Esra well, but last night someone brought Max home

1565
01:15:08,817 --> 01:15:12,480
and I could hear them, and I can not ... you can believe it?

1566
01:15:12,481 --> 01:15:14,653
I dunno, I do not care ... uh ...

1567
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,990
by the way, where is my sister?

1568
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:19,620
Linda was gone!

1569
01:15:19,621 --> 01:15:24,024
We were in the kitchen, came and said he was going

1570
01:15:24,025 --> 01:15:26,127
that you mean by that is "going"?

1571
01:15:26,128 --> 01:15:28,828
He told where he was or where she was staying?

1572
01:15:28,829 --> 01:15:30,330
No! -Not

1573
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:33,876
seemed happy

1574
01:15:33,877 --> 01:15:36,901
He said ... something else?

1575
01:15:36,902 --> 01:15:39,569
About what?

1576
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:42,547
Today when I went to work

1577
01:15:42,548 --> 01:15:44,846
came out of coffee and I found it

1578
01:15:44,847 --> 01:15:47,987
and Dara ...

1579
01:15:47,988 --> 01:15:49,534
My ... were together?

1580
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:53,892
I do not know, I think the quote that was last night

1581
01:15:53,893 --> 01:15:56,417
had to be with him

1582
01:15:59,364 --> 01:16:02,136
What!? This is another type of relationship?

1583
01:16:02,137 --> 01:16:03,137
and as you know this? My God!

1584
01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:07,421
He took the whoring to new level

1585
01:16:07,422 --> 01:16:11,157
But it is a cobarte, came and said he had to go

1586
01:16:11,158 --> 01:16:13,261
packed up and went to hell

1587
01:16:13,262 --> 01:16:16,025
because they wanted to tell me that caught my ex-husband

1588
01:16:16,026 --> 01:16:20,207
I'm sure ... he was afraid to tell you something

1589
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:23,122
is a young lass, is vulnerable

1590
01:16:23,123 --> 01:16:26,373
vulnerable? ... vulnerable! ... then

1591
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:28,908
vulnerable means you have to take

1592
01:16:28,909 --> 01:16:31,741
any of N.Y. life and shit!

1593
01:16:31,742 --> 01:16:33,707
I liked when I saw

1594
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:34,708
her look was suspicious

1595
01:16:34,709 --> 01:16:36,414
You say that my sister is suspect

1596
01:16:36,415 --> 01:16:37,889
Fully suspicious!

1597
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:40,973
He stole my coat, my bloody towels used

1598
01:16:40,974 --> 01:16:42,929
caught on the kitchen counter

1599
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:44,879
and now what my ex-husband garchó

1600
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,263
this is a holy shit, Buzzy, a shit

1601
01:16:47,264 --> 01:16:49,239
Look! I'm mad as like you!

1602
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,984
I have no my sister is encame with Dara

1603
01:16:51,985 --> 01:16:55,239
what you feel is not questioned here, ok?

1604
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,569
Now, your reaction is a bit disproportionate

1605
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:01,463
where not going to stop tonight

1606
01:17:01,464 --> 01:17:04,290
And I was like the pelotuda knew nothing ...

1607
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:06,704
... And if I had left the cafe and I found them?

1608
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:11,201
You did this to me?, I hid all this?

1609
01:17:11,202 --> 01:17:14,634
From this you spoke, units are not known well

1610
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:17,055
before marriage, so I was against it!

1611
01:17:17,056 --> 01:17:19,230
My God, Marsha, shut up!

1612
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,098
Do not tell my sister to shut up!

1613
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:23,860
My sister is a good person

1614
01:17:23,861 --> 01:17:26,828
Your sister is ... the devil!

1615
01:17:26,829 --> 01:17:29,251
You're being a little irrational ... ok?

1616
01:17:29,252 --> 01:17:31,955
why were not on speaking in the morning

1617
01:17:31,956 --> 01:17:35,001
and not have to deal with comments "extras"

1618
01:17:35,002 --> 01:17:37,499
I'm going to work, and tomorrow

1619
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,908
you and I are going to have a conversation

1620
01:17:39,909 --> 01:17:42,804
because I think that maybe, want different things

1621
01:17:42,805 --> 01:17:43,805
in this connection

1622
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:45,548
and I think those different things are important

1623
01:17:45,549 --> 01:17:47,816
Really? let's get to it?

1624
01:17:47,817 --> 01:17:49,541
I told the truth!

1625
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:51,614
my fault what my sister?

1626
01:17:58,317 --> 01:18:00,805
Why the hell did you do that?

1627
01:18:00,806 --> 01:18:02,332
Why do not you tell about this?

1628
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:04,430
My God ... seriously?

1629
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:08,283
No chance that Max let him in to Hell

1630
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:10,931
Christ!

1631
01:18:12,785 --> 01:18:13,563
Dress this girl?

1632
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,419
First, he steals my coat

1633
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,342
then used all the towels, 2 times

1634
01:18:18,343 --> 01:18:20,313
and then take my ex-husband

1635
01:18:20,314 --> 01:18:22,023
I say, my ex-husband!

1636
01:18:22,024 --> 01:18:24,072
I feel that if I had a bunny

1637
01:18:24,073 --> 01:18:26,650
I would be boiling in my kitchen!

1638
01:18:35,288 --> 01:18:36,865
Hello! how are you?

1639
01:18:36,866 --> 01:18:39,701
thanks for re shit against marriage

1640
01:18:39,702 --> 01:18:41,819
I'm super happy that you came to visit me!

1641
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:46,097
do you want!?!-just wanted to talk to someone

1642
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:48,722
Ah! and why did not you call your new friend Dara

1643
01:18:48,723 --> 01:18:50,590
and incidentally, spend the night

1644
01:18:50,591 --> 01:18:54,144
Sorry, I said I was not thinking straight

1645
01:18:54,145 --> 01:18:56,616
I would say you were not thinking at all

1646
01:18:56,617 --> 01:18:58,961
Why do not you tell Katie,
as you said you would?

1647
01:18:58,962 --> 01:19:00,450
I could not!

1648
01:19:01,806 --> 01:19:04,738
I was afraid, and was his dark sister

1649
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:09,068
getting pick, and I thought it best to leave

1650
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:13,418
Ok, now put me up the ass problems

1651
01:19:13,419 --> 01:19:15,246
so that, thanks muchísmas

1652
01:19:15,247 --> 01:19:18,598
I'm sorry! I'm a mess! I know!

1653
01:19:18,599 --> 01:19:21,756
I have no one else, you're my brother

1654
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,629
I need your help

1655
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:26,176
Yes! and I was trying to help

1656
01:19:26,177 --> 01:19:28,732
and all you did was shit more

1657
01:19:30,408 --> 01:19:34,456
Not to do! I have no money

1658
01:19:34,457 --> 01:19:36,423
and I just wanna go home!

1659
01:19:36,424 --> 01:19:42,023
I do not feel well ... want to go home

1660
01:19:43,715 --> 01:19:45,444
Where are you?

1661
01:19:45,445 --> 01:19:48,316
I'm in a hotel, I'm in

1662
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:52,124
Cosmopolitan, close to home

1663
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,771
Why do not we meet for breakfast?

1664
01:19:54,772 --> 01:19:57,249
There is a little bar in the corner, at 9 o'clock and ...

1665
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:02,234
We see that, yes?

1666
01:20:02,235 --> 01:20:05,230
Ok, you'll be alright?

1667
01:20:06,527 --> 01:20:08,768
If

1668
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:09,769
Well, see you in the morning

1669
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:12,700
Ok, thanks

1670
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:28,426
Hey Buzzy! you awake?

1671
01:20:29,123 --> 01:20:31,136
No, I'm asleep!

1672
01:20:31,137 --> 01:20:33,663
Hey! you know what I'll do tomorrow?

1673
01:20:35,951 --> 01:20:38,374
You know what? I could care less

1674
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,375
because I'm sleeping ...

1675
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:43,397
I'm taking one day at the beauty spa

1676
01:20:43,398 --> 01:20:47,594
I'll join hands, I will shave ...

1677
01:20:47,595 --> 01:20:52,169
I'm going to dye the roots, it will be great!

1678
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:54,799
Guess what? I suck an egg!

1679
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,142
and you know I'm going to do next?

1680
01:20:57,143 --> 01:21:01,313
You know Marsha? I think I said I was sleeping

1681
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:06,699
I'm going to a bar and I'll take 200 daisies

1682
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:09,235
and I will raise a type, an asshole

1683
01:21:09,236 --> 01:21:11,096
a nice asshole

1684
01:21:11,097 --> 01:21:12,968
I'll suck it suck it

1685
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:16,577
and then I'm going to get in the kitchen

1686
01:21:16,578 --> 01:21:19,419
Yeah ... sounds wonderful, do me a favor?

1687
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,406
make sure you use lining

1688
01:21:21,407 --> 01:21:23,808
Will not you have to marry again!

1689
01:21:23,809 --> 01:21:27,439
Ah! and guess what I do after that?

1690
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:31,126
You know what? ... Hell I care what you do three!

1691
01:21:31,127 --> 01:21:34,175
I thought you might like!

1692
01:21:34,176 --> 01:21:36,373
're always counting

1693
01:21:36,374 --> 01:21:38,809
about your sexual exploits with my sister

1694
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:42,004
I thought you were going to enjoy what I tell you, right?

1695
01:21:46,155 --> 01:21:49,284
Marsha ... Good night!

1696
01:21:50,137 --> 01:21:51,598
Good night!

1697
01:21:52,721 --> 01:21:55,037
it's 2 am and it is obvious

1698
01:21:55,038 --> 01:21:57,051
I will not be able to sleep

1699
01:21:57,052 --> 01:22:00,399
with Marsha trepanandome ears all night ...

1700
01:22:02,082 --> 01:22:04,413
I can not stay in bed thinking

1701
01:22:04,288 --> 01:22:06,860
how to fix things with Katie or

1702
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:10,818
go to the restaurant to try to fix them

1703
01:22:31,641 --> 01:22:33,310
I can talk a minute?

1704
01:22:33,311 --> 01:22:35,219
I am very busy now, Buzzy

1705
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,961
You can not give me a minute?

1706
01:22:51,345 --> 01:22:55,760
Look ... I understand I should have gone home

1707
01:22:55,761 --> 01:22:58,455
as soon as I saw them and tell you

1708
01:22:58,456 --> 01:23:00,146
I should not expect me to tell her,

1709
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:01,147
I'm sorry, I fucked up, ok?

1710
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:05,051
I'm scared, Buzzy, very scared

1711
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:06,369
Of what?

1712
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:08,693
I think maybe we rush into this relationship

1713
01:23:08,694 --> 01:23:11,831
You're crazy! we are a great couple

1714
01:23:11,832 --> 01:23:13,393
we have the perfect arrangement

1715
01:23:13,394 --> 01:23:16,407
and these ruined! 'You do not want a "fix"

1716
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,075
I want a marriage

1717
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,499
and joked all the time

1718
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,212
about how things are so random

1719
01:23:21,213 --> 01:23:22,213
among us, no dramas,

1720
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:23,214
we never

1721
01:23:23,215 --> 01:23:25,595
I think ... maybe we are being naive

1722
01:23:25,596 --> 01:23:27,658
that perhaps we are avoiding something

1723
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:29,408
you see what we are avoiding?

1724
01:23:29,409 --> 01:23:32,133
We have a great, great

1725
01:23:32,134 --> 01:23:34,490
We are avoiding the real life!

1726
01:23:34,491 --> 01:23:36,430
I mean, true intimacy

1727
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:38,821
I'm not talking only about sex

1728
01:23:40,327 --> 01:23:44,220
I think I was lying to myself

1729
01:23:44,221 --> 01:23:47,293
crao I need much more than this

1730
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:49,668
What more do you need? I love you

1731
01:23:49,669 --> 01:23:51,441
I love you!, More need than that!?

1732
01:23:51,442 --> 01:23:53,677
So why can not you be honest with

1733
01:23:53,678 --> 01:23:56,859
I am honest with you! Ok?

1734
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:59,189
sometimes little things do not tell

1735
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:00,661
I forget to tell you things

1736
01:24:00,662 --> 01:24:01,994
those things add up

1737
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:03,886
and I have fear that after 18 years

1738
01:24:03,887 --> 01:24:06,912
we are so full of hatred and resentment

1739
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:08,807
Max and Marsha,

1740
01:24:08,808 --> 01:24:12,576
and now I look, and not who you are

1741
01:24:12,577 --> 01:24:14,988
It seems that your sister was talking,

1742
01:24:14,989 --> 01:24:17,664
you know me! Look at me, know me!

1743
01:24:17,665 --> 01:24:20,789
I do not know, I'm seeing strange attitudes this week

1744
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:22,099
-If foreign attitudes

1745
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,868
I was protecting my sister

1746
01:24:23,869 --> 01:24:26,763
can you understand that? she's my sister

1747
01:24:26,764 --> 01:24:29,475
If, if, instead of protecting me

1748
01:24:29,476 --> 01:24:30,865
your wife

1749
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:34,900
and understand, I understand, you worry about your sister

1750
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:37,249
Yes-but it was surprising to me

1751
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:39,459
because you never hear mention

1752
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:42,323
until this week, until he came to our door

1753
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,722
and ... I feel I do not recognize you

1754
01:24:47,723 --> 01:24:49,623
and the person I married

1755
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:56,029
I have to go back to work, this is crazy

1756
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:58,327
You took everything out of proportion

1757
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:03,275
I can not believe this happening so fast

1758
01:25:03,276 --> 01:25:06,723
Two days ago we were happy ...

1759
01:25:06,724 --> 01:25:10,380
and now ... she is cuetionando

1760
01:25:10,381 --> 01:25:11,381
if you know me or not

1761
01:25:14,536 --> 01:25:17,201
no ... I was speechless ...

1762
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:41,369
Good day! -Good day

1763
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:44,416
want some coffee? -Thanks - for nothing

1764
01:25:47,569 --> 01:25:49,626
as you sleep? -Not so good

1765
01:25:49,627 --> 01:25:51,442
I had a rare night

1766
01:25:53,522 --> 01:25:55,018
Buzzy came out, early morning

1767
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:58,658
Yes, trains several clients, before going to the gym

1768
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,909
I tell you something really funny?

1769
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:04,800
Last night it was bothering

1770
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:07,722
and said he would go to a bar

1771
01:26:07,723 --> 01:26:09,877
to get up a guy and there cogermelo

1772
01:26:09,878 --> 01:26:13,612
wanted to "give back" your stupid
"Sexual comments"

1773
01:26:13,613 --> 01:26:17,952
He hated it! ... It was so fun!

1774
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:22,852
Marsha know what?, You stay will not work

1775
01:26:22,853 --> 01:26:26,221
What, where did all this?

1776
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:29,229
You do not like Buzzy, and you do not like you the

1777
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:31,369
and just get rid of his sister

1778
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:33,528
and that problem, and not want any more dramas

1779
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:35,204
in my house, I'm trying to do

1780
01:26:35,205 --> 01:26:36,205
my marriage work

1781
01:26:36,206 --> 01:26:37,860
That is, these from the side of it?

1782
01:26:37,861 --> 01:26:39,675
Yes, I am, because he is my husband

1783
01:26:39,676 --> 01:26:41,324
and we are trying to overcome things

1784
01:26:41,325 --> 01:26:42,623
and I have to give priority

1785
01:26:42,624 --> 01:26:44,348
Well, absolutely not!

1786
01:26:44,349 --> 01:26:46,399
You stayed with me when you needed a place

1787
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,329
Now I need a place, then I am!

1788
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,897
I stay

1789
01:26:52,516 --> 01:26:55,887
Ok!, I'm going to bed

1790
01:26:55,888 --> 01:26:58,381
Ok ... you know, I'm getting divorced!

1791
01:26:58,382 --> 01:27:00,359
I have also problems

1792
01:27:04,837 --> 01:27:08,077
I just get u $ s 2000 in cash to give

1793
01:27:08,078 --> 01:27:10,191
must return to L.A. and not even

1794
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:12,240
what kind of life is there, then ...

1795
01:27:12,241 --> 01:27:16,824
better have money in your pocket when you return

1796
01:27:18,841 --> 01:27:20,796
Well, here there are 2000 dollars

1797
01:27:20,797 --> 01:27:23,630
do me a favor, do not tell Katie gave you the

1798
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:25,919
I do not need both

1799
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,960
Yes, you need to cover the plane ticket

1800
01:27:27,961 --> 01:27:29,658
and if you decide to return to N.Y

1801
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:32,589
you go to buy a nice coat before he came, shall we?

1802
01:27:36,233 --> 01:27:38,177
I remember as a kid

1803
01:27:38,178 --> 01:27:40,638
came back home and your life was a mess

1804
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:45,055
as you did to change, become a good guy

1805
01:27:45,056 --> 01:27:46,864
with a normal life

1806
01:27:46,865 --> 01:27:48,024
When I was in my 20,

1807
01:27:48,025 --> 01:27:49,746
also was a total disaster

1808
01:27:49,747 --> 01:27:52,717
I realized that if I kept acting like

1809
01:27:52,718 --> 01:27:54,181
would end only

1810
01:27:54,182 --> 01:27:56,967
And now I see, I see your behavior

1811
01:27:56,968 --> 01:27:59,340
and the same will happen to you

1812
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:01,090
Because you hurt yourself;

1813
01:28:01,091 --> 01:28:03,046
and hurt people who care about you,

1814
01:28:03,047 --> 01:28:04,047
as I

1815
01:28:05,957 --> 01:28:08,685
We re last night shit things

1816
01:28:08,686 --> 01:28:10,337
a little bit, yeah!

1817
01:28:10,338 --> 01:28:13,062
but in a weird way

1818
01:28:13,063 --> 01:28:16,181
was a blessing

1819
01:28:16,182 --> 01:28:17,377
If? as?

1820
01:28:17,378 --> 01:28:21,306
forced me to reevaluate some things ...

1821
01:28:21,307 --> 01:28:24,918
I need to make some changes in my life

1822
01:28:27,929 --> 01:28:29,737
Yes, maybe I feel a little guilty

1823
01:28:29,738 --> 01:28:31,923
I am his older brother and I never had relationship with her

1824
01:28:31,924 --> 01:28:33,944
not saw in years

1825
01:28:33,945 --> 01:28:36,326
and I made no effort

1826
01:28:36,327 --> 01:28:37,327
to keep in touch

1827
01:28:37,328 --> 01:28:40,375
But now, I can do

1828
01:28:40,376 --> 01:28:42,549
is to try harder, and try

1829
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:45,156
keep in touch periodically

1830
01:28:45,157 --> 01:28:46,157
and maybe go to L.A. to see

1831
01:28:57,459 --> 01:28:59,980
You still here ... where is Katie?

1832
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:01,608
Go back to sleep

1833
01:29:03,445 --> 01:29:06,397
Obviously this very angry about something ...

1834
01:29:12,244 --> 01:29:15,076
Ah! entonses you go?

1835
01:29:15,077 --> 01:29:18,118
You know, I was your suitcase ready from day one

1836
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:19,119
Coward!

1837
01:29:20,553 --> 01:29:21,913
Men are cowards ...

1838
01:29:21,914 --> 01:29:24,486
Max is a coward

1839
01:29:24,487 --> 01:29:27,055
Katie's first husband, Dara

1840
01:29:27,056 --> 01:29:28,851
was definitely a coward

1841
01:29:28,852 --> 01:29:32,443
and Buzzy ... could also be a coward

1842
01:29:32,444 --> 01:29:34,909
I think things can get more complicated

1843
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:36,888
and it devastated quedría

1844
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:46,559
What are you doing?

1845
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,983
Oh, you're awake

1846
01:29:47,984 --> 01:29:49,139
I'm packing a suitcase

1847
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,895
Why? what happens?

1848
01:29:50,896 --> 01:29:52,544
I think lingerie is

1849
01:29:52,545 --> 01:29:54,359
I stole my sister or everything?

1850
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,023
Buzzy, para, you're doing?

1851
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:58,610
I need to leave town

1852
01:29:58,611 --> 01:30:00,616
and I would love to come with me ...

1853
01:30:00,617 --> 01:30:03,026
the car is parked at the gate

1854
01:30:05,725 --> 01:30:07,517
I can not go anywhere, I have to work!

1855
01:30:12,434 --> 01:30:15,786
My first thought, after saying "I do"

1856
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:19,149
I wish that my parents were alive

1857
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:22,665
to see, were in my first marriage

1858
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:24,662
did not,

1859
01:30:26,882 --> 01:30:31,132
Buzzy and I think they would have liked, much

1860
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,879
My first thought, after we said:

1861
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,742
"I do", well, she was pregnant

1862
01:30:35,743 --> 01:30:38,697
when we got married 4 months pregnant

1863
01:30:38,698 --> 01:30:40,762
I could not wait to get my dress

1864
01:30:40,763 --> 01:30:42,001
Neither do I

1865
01:30:42,002 --> 01:30:44,535
Yes, but not for the same reason

1866
01:30:44,536 --> 01:30:48,632
My heart broke! boom, boom, boom!

1867
01:30:49,888 --> 01:30:51,977
After saying "I do" was totally happy

1868
01:30:51,978 --> 01:30:55,327
I have an amazing girl, the beautiful

1869
01:30:55,328 --> 01:30:57,321
Linda is so different!

1870
01:30:57,322 --> 01:30:59,495
the opposite, completely

1871
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:01,856
responsible ...

1872
01:31:03,817 --> 01:31:05,344
responsible and loving ...

1873
01:31:06,688 --> 01:31:08,983
My real first thought ...

1874
01:31:10,978 --> 01:31:13,555
was "just wanted a suck of dick more"

1875
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:18,711
My life before meeting Katie

1876
01:31:18,712 --> 01:31:20,629
was always chaotic

1877
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:22,981
My childhood, school, my twenties

1878
01:31:22,982 --> 01:31:23,982
until my first marriage

1879
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,080
and ... after meeting Katie

1880
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:31,534
a feeling of peace finally came into my life

1881
01:31:31,535 --> 01:31:33,302
I think the first thought I had

1882
01:31:33,303 --> 01:31:35,374
after saying "I do"

1883
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:39,024
was probably ... a feeling of ...

1884
01:31:39,025 --> 01:31:41,344
tranquility or serenity?

1885
01:31:41,345 --> 01:31:43,538
Katie is a rock

1886
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:46,139
and do you really need in my life

1887
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:49,534
I think I finally feel

1888
01:31:49,535 --> 01:31:51,080
at peace

1889
01:32:03,115 --> 01:32:04,968
Then! ... Where are we going?

1890
01:32:04,969 --> 01:32:07,324
I have no idea, but I think

1891
01:32:07,325 --> 01:32:09,387
we need to go as far

1892
01:32:09,388 --> 01:32:11,807
of our relatives as we can

1893
01:32:13,132 --> 01:32:14,349
and then what?

1894
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:16,190
and then talk

1895
01:32:16,191 --> 01:32:19,252
know and maybe work a little better

1896
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:27,768
sounds good ... let's go

1897
01:32:50,769 --> 01:32:53,152
