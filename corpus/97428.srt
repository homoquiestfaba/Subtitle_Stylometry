the proud man's contumely,

522
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:32,920
the pangs of despised love,
the law's delay,

523
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,328
the insolence of office,
and the spurns...

524
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:38,334
that patient merit
of th' unworthy takes,

525
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:43,101
when he himself might his quietus
make with a bare bodkin?

526
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,767
- That's nice, David.
- Who would fardels bear,

527
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:49,835
to grunt and sweat
under weary life,

528
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,847
- but that the threat...
- [Warning Whistle]

529
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:55,180
Of something after death,
the undiscovered country...

530
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:58,153
from whose bourn
and no traveller returns,

531
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:02,157
puzzles the will,
and makes us rather bear those ills we have...

532
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,753
than fy to others
that we know not of?

533
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,567
In the second book
of The Republic,

534
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,806
Plato says,
"What will happen to the just man...

535
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:21,571
should he enter this world?"

536
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,637
Well, thejust man
will be scourged,

537
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:28,309
racked, chained.

538
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,013
Then after every kind of misery,

539
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:37,387
he will be crucified
on a pole for all to see.

540
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,454
Any questions?

541
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,397
I've got a question.

542
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,905
- Do you mind?
- Sure.

543
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,807
My question:

544
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,149
If the just man...

545
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,382
is treated as you say,

546
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,687
then what's the just response?

547
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,994
Roll over and let evil
have its wicked way?

548
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,900
Well, what would
you recommend, Major?

549
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,370
Oh, I'd recommend defiance.

550
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,430
Justice for the captors.

551
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,874
An eye for an eye.

552
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,639
- At what price mercy?
- [Chuckles]

553
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,483
Yeah, mercy.

554
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,917
The last bastion
of traitors and cowards.

555
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:43,750
So you would take a man
and crucify him on a pole for all to see?

556
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,793
- I would seek justice.
- [Book Thuds]

557
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,827
Any of you?

558
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,813
Sergeant Major?

559
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,546
- Heave!
- [Shouting In Japanese]

560
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,778
Heave!

561
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,843
Heave.!

562
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:52,157
[Gordon Narrating] Major Campbell
was a natural leader amongst men.

563
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,323
He seemed to draw them
from all nationalities and groups,

564
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:59,232
- #[Ethereal Vocalizing]
- And he had a way with
uniting them in a common cause...

565
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,293
his common cause.

566
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,830
Better get two more of ours.

567
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,206
#[Continues]

568
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,749
[Campbell] The guards change between
5:00 and half 5:00 every single day,

569
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,657
- so we have to be there, men.
- Sorry, Major.

570
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:27,390
Are we interrupting
a church service?

571
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,903
So what's the story?

572
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,772
Major, let's say
your plan works, right?

573
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:47,046
You've confiscated the guns,
captured the guards,

574
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,449
taken over the whole camp.

575
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,320
What then?

576
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,450
You have still nowhere to go.

577
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,758
And when the Nips find out,

578
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,365
we'll have a regiment
a thousand strong...

579
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,731
descend on us
with a vengeance.

580
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,673
You can't possibly
hope to survive.

581
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,709
Who's talkin' about survival?

582
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,012
So that's what this is,
a suicide mission.

583
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,910
Come here. Come here.

584
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,820
So what are you gonna do, eh?
What are you gonna do?

585
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,189
You're gonna throw yourself
on the mercy of Bushido?

586
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,923
[Chuckles]
Aye, now that would be suicide.

587
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,966
Save us the bullshit, Major.

588
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,696
What are they payin' ya, Yanker?

589
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,463
Huh?

590
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,703
Oh, didn't he tell ya?

591
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:54,276
[Laughs]
Some of his best trades are with theJaps.

592
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,012
Well, how'd you think
they get such good medicine?

593
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,350
Ain't that right, Yanker?

594
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,054
You tell them, Yanker, eh?

595
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:08,620
Ha!

596
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,566
You are endangering the life
of every man in this camp.

597
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:15,069
I don't think they agree
with your idea of justice.

598
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:18,107
So, what, are you the voice
of the people now, eh?

599
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:23,802
Or you may be just a wee bit tooJap happy
for your own good.

600
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,288
Ernie,

601
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,086
we Argylls have got
to stick together.

602
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,990
And you know that's what
the colonel would say.

603
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,368
Good boy.

604
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:55,539
[Miller]
Greater love hath no man than this,

605
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:01,349
that a man lay down
his life for his friends.

606
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,080
You have heard that it was said,

607
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,679
that you shall love your neighbor...

608
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,486
and hate your enemy.

609
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:15,895
But I say to you,
love your enemy,

610
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:20,227
and pray for those
who persecute you.

611
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:24,070
For what shall it profit a man...

612
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,506
ifhe gains the whole world,
