1
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,619
I like these
sheets that you bought.

2
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,454
Yeah,
they're so soft.

3
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,831
What's the thread count?

4
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,083
800.

5
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,126
No shit.

6
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,131
Feels good.
Yeah.

7
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,804
You're so sexy.

8
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,930
You're sexy, too.

9
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,349
Thanks.
Welcome.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,310
I love you.
I love you more.

11
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,824
Um...

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:18,412
So I forgot to tell you Seiner
can't do the Rome office stint,

13
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,498
so it looks like I'm going
to Italy for the summer.

14
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,626
Italy.

15
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,212
And therefore, I think
that this is a good time

16
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,339
for us to evaluate
our relationship.

17
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,300
Really?

18
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,678
Honey,
I'm not proposing.

19
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,349
I'm evaluating and
after my evaluation,

20
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,020
I've realized that we're both ignoring
something really obvious here.

21
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,398
We always go to Elizabeth’s
for brunch on Sunday,

22
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,108
we switched from sour cream
to Greek yogurt together,

23
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,651
you wear your bra
when we're having sex.

24
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,945
Look at the fucking pajamas
that we're wearing.

25
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,449
I am saying
that we are boring.

26
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,285
That I am bored,

27
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,788
that I am, like,
crazy-out-of-my-mind bored.

28
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,582
The most exciting part
of the sex that we just had

29
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,918
was when my penis was
chafed by your Sugaring

30
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,047
We can spice things up.
How about a blow job in the bathroom?

31
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,799
No, Lauren, stop it. Just stop it.
I was just inside of you.

32
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,301
No...
Okay, okay.

33
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,519
This is us.
We could fix this.

34
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,021
We could fix this, okay?

35
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,649
Lauren, let's just talk
when I get back, okay?

36
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,568
We'll have had some distance, and
you'll have moved out of this place.

37
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,947
This is my home.
I've lived here for two years.

38
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,282
Lauren, I tried
to tell you.

39
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,492
When?

40
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,785
Last month

41
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,205
when we were walking through the
West Village and I said to you,

42
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,917
"it's not for me, but I could
so see you living here."

43
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,212
I should pack.

44
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,423
I'll just start
in the kitchen.

45
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,678
Lauren...

46
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,477
You're sitting on
my phone, I think.

47
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,569
Thanks.

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,702
Hi, can I please get
some fried dumplings

49
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,328
and an order of
orange chicken?

50
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,122
Thatcher be how long?

51
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,041
Okay, see you
in 20 minutes. Bye.

52
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,628
And who may
I ask is calling?

53
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,046
Hey, it's me,
your pathetic

54
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,132
29-year-old
intern friend.

55
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,218
Well, there's always
a spot for you at Happy Nails.

56
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:42,055
Never. I would never... Comedy?
You wanna see some comedy?

57
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,308
Never. I would never consider
working there in a million years.

58
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,976
Are you kidding?
For one thing, I'm not Asian enough.

59
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,187
Here you go, comedy.

60
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,938
What's up?
You called. Comedy?

61
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,483
Yes, I made you more fliers.
Are you ever gonna let me see your show?

62
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,612
I would consider
letting you go in never,

63
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,364
but I will meet you at
Shake Shack in 20 minutes.

64
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,158
I can’t
I'm overexercise

65
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,076
And this place is
full of windows...

66
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,078
Hello! Excuse me?
...gets lots of light.

67
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,705
I'm being robbed.
Got to go, bye.

68
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,081
Look at this nice,
long hallway.

69
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,501
As a matter of fact, why don't
you go look in the living room?

70
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,087
Great crown molding,
a view of Programer Park.

71
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,964
Yeah, my view
is beautiful.

72
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,467
What the hell, man?
I live here.

73
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,135
You cannot just drop
in on me like this.

74
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,137
I told you 60 days ago

75
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,139
that this building
was no longer

76
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,099
going to be rent-controlled
as of June 1st.

77
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,769
And I told you that this is
my grandmother's apartment

78
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,437
and I've lived here
for five years

79
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,189
and Gram doesn't want me
moving her things.

80
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,443
All right, hey, why don't you
just give me another month

81
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,196
so I can get
my book advance, okay?

82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,198
You're writing a book?

83
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:46,203
Not at this exact second,
but I have a lot of ideas.

84
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,038
You've got
four days, Katie.

85
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,582
If you can't pay,
you've got to move on,

86
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,876
or find a damn roommate.

87
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,421
Hey, what
do you think?

88
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,756
All right, let's go.
Come on.

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,801
That's fine!
Have fun with my grandmother's ghost.

90
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,637
She talks in her sleep
about the Holocaust!

91
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,724
Okay, honey,
you have to stop pouting

92
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,228
because now you're depressing
me, you're depressing Zelda,

93
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,438
you're just
creating this, like,

94
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,815
pea soup of depression
in this room.

95
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,734
Look at her.

96
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,111
She has a permanent
frown-y face, okay?

97
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,072
It's not her face.
It's her energy.

98
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,158
Her energy is so off and
Tuesday's her favorite day.

99
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,952
I don't care.
I'm the one who just found out

100
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,412
that my person is
no longer my person.

101
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,623
Look, look, I haven't
said anything before

102
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,874
because I like to
be a good friend

103
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,042
and I don't wanna
be judgmental,

104
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,795
but right now, I'm gonna
drop a real bomb on you

105
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,713
so I'm glad
you're sitting down.

106
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,591
Charlie is boring.

107
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,804
Sorry, everyone talks about
it, no one says it to you.

108
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:09,930
He is boring.

109
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,517
It's a struggle to have a
20-second conversation with him.

110
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,936
And you know what else?

111
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,772
He always seems like he's kind
of looking for a better deal.

112
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,107
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,859
I'm a great deal.

114
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,362
Honey, oh, my God, I know that.
Of course, you are.

115
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,155
You're my favorite.
You're the best deal in the world.

116
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,157
You're like
a Subway gift card.

117
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,536
But then why would he go all the way
over to Italy without you, huh?

118
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,999
To what? To shack up with
some woman named Catalina

119
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,668
who has perfect
teardrop breasts

120
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:43,755
and a nice Sicilian bush
that smells like lavender,

121
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,674
and she makes her
own pesto sauce?

122
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:47,885
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,013
I don't even know
why we're packing.

124
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,599
I can't afford an apartment
by myself in this city.

125
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,521
I've a place for you.

126
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,773
Where?

127
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,650
Before I tell you,
you have to promise me

128
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,527
that you'll keep
an open mind

129
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,863
and let Uncle Jesse
take care of you.

130
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,448
Keep talking.

131
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,075
Okay, remember Monica
and Rachel's apartment?

132
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,160
Of course, you do.

133
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,871
This one makes that one
look like a fucking shoebox,

134
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,874
and bonus,
it overlooks Zelma’s

135
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,919
third favorite park
in the world, Programer.

136
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,054
You.

137
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,138
You!

138
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,432
Come on. Please?

139
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,643
You sure you don't wanna come inside?
There's a Keg!

140
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,938
Come on, it'll be like high
school with no curfew.

141
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,107
Hey, could you bum
a cigarette off me?

142
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,442
He'll be here.

143
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,194
Good, yeah.
What more do you want?

144
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,529
Jesse!

145
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,199
want to Mac arena
with you Jesse, Jesse, Jesse

146
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,367
Oh, yeah, girl.

147
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,660
That's the girl Katie
I told you about

148
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:55,911
from my
Religious Studies class.

149
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,373
She's the bomb. She's so cool and smart.
I wanna be friends with her.

150
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,041
Hey,
Jesse Lawson! Yeah!

151
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,626
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

152
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,505
Stop showing your body
to everybody.

153
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,131
I wanna show you my body!

154
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,217
No, no.
This is my friend, Drunk McGee.

155
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,469
This is my friend, Lauren.
She's gonna drive you home, okay?

156
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,887
Please, please, please?
KATIE: Yes.

157
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,305
She's on the way, She's
right near your dorm.

158
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,431
I'm gonna beat you!

159
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,516
Okay,
you're gonna beat me!

160
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,018
Please? Just so she doesn't
get date-raped by somebody.

161
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,149
How was the party?

162
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,235
Well, these two guys
were totally

163
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,653
fighting over me
and I was like,

164
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,406
"Listen, you guys, I can't blow
both of you at the same time!

165
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,490
"Fuck off!"
You know what I mean?

166
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,036
Anyways,
whatnot you do tonight?

167
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,122
I'm just gonna
watch some Felicity.

168
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,292
I hate British people.

169
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,171
Are you sure we're
going the right way?

170
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,173
Is this yours?

171
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,716
Yeah. Sorry,
I think it's empty.

172
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,260
Perfect.
I'm just gonna borrow it.

173
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,138
Stop! This is my new car!

174
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,598
It was
a graduation present!

175
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,892
I do this all the time.
Just shh, shh!

176
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:05,189
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

177
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,027
Ta-DA! See,
no spills at all!

178
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,036
Get out.

179
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,122
But it's scary here.

180
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,875
Get out of my car!
I hate you!

181
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,842
Why don't you
just chill out!

182
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,428
Urine is sterile!

183
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,476
Hi! Come on in! Come here.
You're gonna love it.

184
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,478
Move. Get in here.

185
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,063
What are you thinking?
I can't live with her!

186
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,191
You know, I totally don't
appreciate surprises, Jesse.

187
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:53,320
Close, close, close,
close and open sesame!

188
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,614
Wow.

189
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,033
Incredible, right?
Could you die?

190
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,493
Literally,
could you die?

191
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,371
Hardwood floors, the windows,
Programer Park is right out there

192
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,164
and it's
a historical landmark.

193
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:06,166
Katie's grandmother
got this place in the ’40s

194
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,335
She was a knitting maven.

195
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,963
Oh. And a stripper, too, I see.
What is that?

196
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,840
You don't need to
judge my bubble.

197
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,634
Honey, no one's
judging anybody's bubble.

198
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,011
You know what?

199
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,222
Katherine, why don't you tell Lauren
a little bit about the place?

200
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,599
I'm gonna go get some Monster
because I'm a little...

201
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,351
Look at me, I'm shaking.
I'm a little low energy.

202
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,186
I'll be right back, okay?
You want some Io man?

203
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,271
You wanna finish it off?
No.

204
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,106
Okay. I'll throw it away
or put it in the fridge?

205
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,774
I don't care.
Okay.

206
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,234
Well, this is
an apartment.

207
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,695
I'm sure you're familiar with
what that is structurally.

208
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,154
This is a living room.
That's a dining room.

209
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,531
There's a chair.
That's a lamp.

210
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,867
Grandma, and down the
hall is my room.

211
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,869
That's private because I'm
a very private person

212
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,495
and across the hall
is Bobbie’s room.

213
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,207
She died in there.

214
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,004
Let's go see your bedroom.
Come on. Come on.

215
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,632
Don't go in my room!
I said it was private!

216
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,093
And you can hang
all your pictures.

217
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,345
Okay, now don't mind the odor.
It's a bit pungent.

218
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,055
That's Bubble
She's still lingering,

219
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,682
but that'll be gone.
it'll be dissipated.

220
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,934
Look at this, though.
Look at this personal space.

221
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:09,479
Invaluable in New York, right?
This is a bedroom, or is it?

222
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,358
Or is it a dance studio?
I don't know, there's so much space here.

223
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:16,820
I mean, can you believe this?
And the closet space?

224
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,323
Forget the windows, the windows
with the light coming in.

225
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,074
It's like living
on the sun!

226
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,242
These hardwood floors,

227
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,578
if there was a knot in the floor
big enough for my ding-dong,

228
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,746
I would fuck
the shit out of them.

229
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,248
Good. Good. How could you trick me?
You know I hate her.

230
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,251
'Cause you need a place to
stay and she needs a roommate.

231
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,503
I don't want to.

232
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,712
I know.

233
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,672
Fine. Okay.
Okay.

234
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,341
The place is amazing.
You're right, okay? Right?

235
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,302
Yes, the windows are huge,
the floors are lovely, okay?

236
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,471
What is that?
Is that a pedicure chair?

237
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,224
It is for my back.

238
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,684
Okay, it's for her back.
She's got a bad back.

239
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,186
What is all this shit?
I don't know.

240
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,104
Stop touching
Bobbie’s things!

241
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:53,941
Okay, you, you,
let's go, outside.

242
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,192
Don't touch it!

243
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,944
In the hallway.

244
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,280
Conference, family conference.
Get over here.

245
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,783
Yeah, I know, pouting!
We're gonna take a walk.

246
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:06,453
Bitch one and bitch two, go.
I need a minute of your time, okay?

247
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,205
A minute where
you are just neutral

248
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,873
and you're not
judging each other

249
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,375
and you're not holding
onto all this shit.

250
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,795
Close your eyes, close your eyes.
Open your hearts, please.

251
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:17,047
Indulge me. Please.

252
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,008
Oh, god bless you!
Thank you, Katherine.

253
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,844
You guys, together,

254
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,263
could take this place
from nursing home

255
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,974
to "let's nurse some
cocktails at home," right?

256
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,643
I'm talking about a trip to Design
Within Reach led by Lauren,

257
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,563
I'm talking about cool
street-art done by Katie,

258
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,607
I'm talking about getting rid of
that floral print monstrosity,

259
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,443
taking it outside, pissing
on it and burning it,

260
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,946
and then you know what, we'll
replace it with something simple,

261
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,407
something from...
I don't know.

262
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,868
Now, I want you to open your
eyes on the count of three.

263
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,786
And I want you to
see your new home.

264
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,913
And I don't want you to
thank me right away,

265
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,708
but overtime, yes, I think
I'm owed a little thanks.

266
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,169
One, two, three.

267
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,587
I release you.

268
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,757
It does sound like
a nice place to live.

269
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,261
Yeah, almost as nice as that neighborhood
you left me in so I could get raped.

270
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,679
What?
You were raped?

271
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:06,847
No, but I could have been.
God!

272
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,849
Why can't my friends
be ducking friends?

273
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,684
Whenever I smell urine,
it reminds me

274
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,477
of the time
you peed in my hair.

275
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,605
Oh! There was a bump!
What do you want me to say about it?

276
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,398
There was no bump!
Okay, stop it!

277
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,233
You two hate each other
for no reason!

278
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:22,696
I am so sick and tired of
living like a child of divorce.

279
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,864
Why don't you
just live together

280
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,032
for the summer?
See how it goes?

281
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,950
Okay.

282
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,287
Lauren, honey,
I have a question.

283
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,371
Where are you
sleeping tonight?

284
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:32,497
'Cause it's not at my place.

285
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,875
I have that Peruvian boy
coming over from the gym.

286
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,335
And, Katherine,
may I remind you

287
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,711
that your most
promising applicant

288
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,421
has been that woman
that looked like Ted Danson

289
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,131
and could not
stop queening?

290
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,133
Do you want that? Hmm?

291
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,012
You two,
my gorgeous angels,

292
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,932
are about to be homeless
in Washington Square Park

293
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,142
over a fucking party foul.

294
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,521
And I don't like to give out spare
change, so you're on your own.

295
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,160
Hey, can you
watch my stuff?

296
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,745
I'd love to.

297
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,664
Thanks.

298
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,582
I was thinking
about that barf color

299
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,000
you have on the walls
of your living room,

300
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,503
and I thought this dove gray would
actually really open up the space.

301
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,466
You get two walls,
I get two walls.

302
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,051
Welcome home.

303
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,012
Great.

304
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,560
How much for the lamp?

305
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,397
$10.

306
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,525
I'm moving
your chair out of my room!

307
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,152
Oh, my God, yeah.

308
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,446
I love the way you feel.

309
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,283
You feel so good. Yeah.

310
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,286
Ooh, I do like when you
tickle my boobies like that.

311
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,621
Tickle my boobies.
Tickle them.

312
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,004
Hey,
can I get in there?

313
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,630
I just really
have to pee and then

314
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,174
I have to get ready
for work. I'll be so fast.

315
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,384
All right.
I don't care. Come in.

316
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,935
Go ahead.

317
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,646
Okay.

318
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,152
Where do you work that
requires so much makeup?

319
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,405
I'm just doing a lot of writing,
being super creative.

320
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,660
Did you have someone
over here last night?

321
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,996
It's none
of your business.

322
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:38,916
But yes.

323
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:41,710
Okay.

324
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,756
Oh, my God, Lauren.

325
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,343
Sounds like
somebody has a US.

326
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,552
You can't hear a US.

327
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,679
I'd invest in some cranberry
juice if I were you.

328
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:57,017
Okay, fine, you know what?
You pee in cups in cars while they're moving.

329
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,937
Ooh. I like
a little fire in you.

330
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,277
Katie,
there's no toilet paper.

331
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,448
Katie,
there's no toilet paper.

332
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,368
What? I can't hear you!
I'm running late! Bye!

333
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,080
I have to let you go.
I'm old. I'm tired.

334
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,085
And let's face it, it's time
to close the place down.

335
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:27,214
You're smart.
That's why I hired you.

336
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:31,218
And that's why you're gonna be
great out there on your own.

337
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:35,472
I thought I would take over when you retired.
What about your clients?

338
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:39,017
You're gonna be great
out there on your own.

339
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,858
Work is good.
it's just...

340
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,693
...really busy.

341
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,319
Sweetie, tell us some more
about the new place.

342
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,905
We've been dying to come over and
help you set it up. I mean...

343
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,908
Yeah, just give us a good
time and we'll come over.

344
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,579
Did you eat
all my hot dog buns?

345
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,746
I'm on the phone!

346
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,873
They're kosher!

347
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,374
I know you stole my lamp!

348
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,792
What?
What’s you say?

349
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,252
Sorry, Dad.

350
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:09,131
The apartment is spectacular.
My roommate is whatever.

351
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,508
Well, you won't have to live
with this person for long, honey.

352
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,343
Charlie will come back.
They always do.

353
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,929
But, sweetie, lock up Grandma's pearls.
We don't know this girl.

354
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,631
Burlington! It's Charlie.
I can't get to my phone right now

355
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,050
because I'm probably doing
something awesome in Italy,

356
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,010
but i'll get back to you
as soon as I can. Ciao!

357
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,409
Is this your job?

358
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,370
No.

359
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,623
Yes, you have paint all over
your face and also on your body.

360
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,460
Take a seat. Come on.

361
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,842
You got to sit down to have
your nails done, so...

362
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,513
So you're not a writer?

363
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,597
I write every day.

364
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,308
Like I said, I'm creative, so I
have a lot of outlets for it.

365
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:46,311
This is New York City.
Most people need more than one job.

366
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,313
How many jobs do you have?

367
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:51,817
Well, my top faves
include doing nail art

368
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,528
because I'm good at it and
it lowers my beauty budget.

369
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,196
I also hand out
fliers for Jesse

370
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,241
because I support the arts
and I'm a really good friend.

371
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,326
And I also really like
taking orders at W-Hop

372
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,995
because they have the
best Chinese in the city.

373
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,080
Everybody knows that,
and I get it for free.

374
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,415
Switch.

375
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,670
Why aren't you at work?

376
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,382
Did Jesse tell you?

377
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,801
You kind of gave it away
with the greasy hair and the pajamas.

378
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,721
How you gonna pay
your rent, girl?

379
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,598
I have a savings account.

380
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,224
Oh, right, your rich
parents from Long Island

381
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,268
that cut your sandwich up
into cute little four squares

382
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,561
until you went
to prep school.

383
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,854
Whatever.

384
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,231
You're not a writer.
You're some fake nail tech

385
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,442
with a counterfeit diploma you
probably printed at Kinko's.

386
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,154
Oh, Ming Lee!

387
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,161
What did you say to her?

388
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:52,836
Yeah, I'm your slave.
I love being your slave.

389
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:58,133
Yeah, put me in your cage!
I wanna go in the cage!

390
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:02,554
Wait! Wait, it's dark in here!
I don't wanna be in here anymore!

391
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,598
I don't wanna be
in here anymore!

392
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:08,310
Yeah, your dick looks so big
and it's looking at me!

393
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,103
Let me out! I'm scared!
Katie?

394
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:14,274
Please, let me out!
Please, let me out! Let me out!

395
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,526
I wanna...

396
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,738
Just cum on my face.
Got to go, bye.

397
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,114
NO, HO, HO...

398
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,461
I'm hungry.

399
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:37,214
You want the story
or not?

400
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,551
Yeah, sure.
Fine. Whatever.

401
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,765
When I first came to New
York,

402
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:49,017
I didn't have money,
like I'm sure you did.

403
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,978
And I didn't have
parents that were like,

404
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,022
"Oh, you can be the first pretty
president," or whatever, okay?

405
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,732
My gram let me
move in with her,

406
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,401
but I was pretty
much on my own.

407
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,653
And then she died
and I saw an ad

408
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,864
in the Village Voice
for a phone sex line

409
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,658
and I called it,
and I nailed my interview.

410
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,577
And that's how I'm here.

411
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,620
Why are you so mopey?

412
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,708
Charlie changed his Facebook
status to "single" today.

413
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,547
Sorry. I mean, I don't
really deal with break-ups,

414
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,176
but it's not so bad
being alone.

415
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,553
Take the cookie.

416
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,895
So, how does it work?

417
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,522
Basically, like,
whatever they say,

418
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,691
I just tell them
I wanna lick it.

419
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,485
Like, nipple guy, lick it.
Hairy balls? Lick 'em all.

420
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,570
Okay. O.

421
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,322
You have to know
some dirty words.

422
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,032
Didn't you talk
during sex with Charlie?

423
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,409
I mean, he loved when I
would tell him he was sexy.

424
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,369
Wow.
Whatever.

425
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,538
I meant,
how do you get the calls?

426
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:54,708
It's easy. I just call and tell 'em when
I'm on and they forward me the calls.

427
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,585
How much are
these guys paying?

428
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,545
I think like $4.99.

429
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,798
I get $1 a minute.
It's a decent enough living for me, though.

430
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:04,635
Except I'm always going over
my cell phone minutes, but...

431
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,220
Okay.

432
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,847
First, get a land line.

433
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,724
You're wasting your time
for a buck a minute

434
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,643
and this depraved
company you work for

435
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,395
makes four times as much
as you for doing nothing.

436
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,105
Get your own hotline.

437
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,650
Okay, rude.
I've thought of that.

438
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,236
It just sounds
like a ton of work.

439
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,321
It's not a ton of work.

440
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,823
You just call
the phone company,

441
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,909
they'll give you
a new number,

442
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,328
you'll set up
a PayPal account,

443
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,998
tell your repeat callers your
new number and you're done.

444
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,961
You seem to know
how to do this.

445
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,255
Don't even think
about it.

446
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,589
Help me make this
a business

447
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:45,759
and I'll pay $100 of your rent
until you get another job.

448
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:46,927
No.

449
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,053
Okay, forever.

450
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,307
I have an interview
tomorrow at Caxton Press.

451
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:55,018
It is the second best
publishing house in the world,

452
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,813
it is my dream job
and I'm perfect for it.

453
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:01,024
Really? Okay, well, you go
get your fancy-pants boring job

454
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,277
and I'll just be
here being exciting.

455
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,528
Fine.

456
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,866
It's my 10:00 regular.
His name's Sean.

457
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,284
You know,
you're not better than me.

458
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,160
You're not better
than phone sex!

459
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,998
I'm better than phone sex.

460
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,294
Just imagine me playing with
your balls while you fuck me.

461
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:23,338
I wanna lick you
from top to bottom.

462
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,382
I wanna hear you cum.

463
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,511
Fuck!

464
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:36,852
Hi.

465
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,896
Hi.

466
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,151
So, not to drop
a bomb on you,

467
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:47,821
but it's our two-month
anniversary this week.

468
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:52,701
Yeah, I know. You don't got to tell me.
I got the phone bills.

469
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,579
And don't take that the wrong way.
You know I like you.

470
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,581
Yeah, I figured.

471
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,542
Am I the only one
you're phone banging?

472
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,628
You're the only one,
period.

473
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:06,882
I don't know, it's just easier on the phone.
I get quiet around people.

474
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,218
I'm shy, too.

475
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:10,928
No, you're not.

476
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:14,848
Last week you described a
gang-bang you had in college

477
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,017
while I came
all over my coffee table.

478
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,105
Stop! Do not ever tell me
what I've said to you ever again.

479
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,399
I have another
call coming in

480
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,692
and you need to
save your pennies.

481
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,736
I'll talk to
you later, lover.

482
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:28,904
Bye.

483
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,033
Hello?

484
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,620
Look, I'm qualified.
I'm more than qualified for this job.

485
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,415
I have wasted the last five years of
my life working for the wrong company.

486
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,125
I'm ready to take my
career to the next level

487
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,794
which is why
I'm here with you.

488
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,045
Okay.

489
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,006
I am the most organized
person you will ever meet.

490
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,384
I am the most hard-working
person you'll ever meet.

491
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,468
Probably
one of the smartest.

492
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,178
Listen, the job
we called you in for

493
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:54,847
was filled via
nepotism this morning.

494
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,349
Actually, it's not really nepotism.
it's cronyism or...

495
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,892
I don't know what
it's called when you hire

496
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:00,394
someone's nephew,
but there's no job,

497
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,729
and there won't
be another one for

498
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:04,982
about three months
for a junior editor.

499
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,526
Three months?

500
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,364
I really need
a job right now.

501
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,285
From the looks of this,
you've had everything

502
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,745
planned out since you
were five-years-old.

503
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:21,498
Maybe take a summer off

504
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:26,920
from escorting Down's Syndrome
children to the Broadway theater.

505
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,174
We all made fun of you.

506
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:36,430
Work, you fucking piece of
fucking motherfucking shit!

507
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:37,514
Hi.

508
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:39,224
Hi.

509
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,894
Caxton Press isn't hiring
for another three months.

510
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:44,855
So, until then, I'm yours.

511
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,106
I wanna make
a third of the profits

512
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,316
and I'm not
getting on the phone.

513
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,442
It's strictly business.

514
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,526
I wouldn't want
you on the phone.

515
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,777
You wouldn't have
any idea what to do.

516
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,029
Can you help me
make a website?

517
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,238
Of course, I could,

518
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,781
but you don't
need a website yet.

519
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,784
You need a phone number and a
phone for your new landlines.

520
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:01,872
Oh, my God,
you got me a gift!

521
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:02,956
You're welcome.

522
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,875
And it's pink!

523
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:06,919
Okay.

524
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:10,464
So I've been thinking
about the concept of my line

525
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,634
and the thing about it
is that it's classic.

526
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:17,471
It's always in style just
like my pretty pink phone.

527
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:21,183
These men wanna jerk off to your voice.
They don't need a concept.

528
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,893
What's your number?

529
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,770
Okay, slave driver.

530
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,481
What about

531
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:32,110
1-900-ASS-TIME?

532
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,445
No?

533
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:36,657
1-900-U-FINGER?

534
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,035
1-900-ASS-BAGS?

535
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,370
No, no, no.
TEA-BAGS?

536
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:42,704
Something with "bags"
in it. I don't know.

537
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,456
1-900-AVG-BAGS?

538
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,375
Mm.

539
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,877
Oh, my God,
this smells so good.

540
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,087
Mm!

541
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:52,506
That's not bad.

542
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,258
1-900-AVG-BAGS?

543
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,676
No.

544
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,638
NO. 1-900-mmm-HMM.

545
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,723
Mm!

546
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:04,309
Like, 'I-900-M-M-M...

547
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:07,020
BOTH: H-M-M-M.

548
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,105
Yeah.

549
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,107
ooh.

550
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,650
Like it.

551
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,444
That's it!

552
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,446
Yes!

553
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:20,534
I love it!
I love it so much!

554
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,996
Hello, world!

555
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,001
For a good time,
call 1-900-M-M-M-H-M-M-M!

556
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:34,923
We have a business!

557
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,719
1-900-MM-HMM?

558
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:42,347
Yes, I am. Hold for billing, please.
Billing!

559
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,683
Misty, it's Dan
from Connecticut.

560
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:47,227
Cheryl, it's Eddie
from East Lansing.

561
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:49,188
Rachel, it's
Schlemiel again.

562
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,733
Guzzling cum?
My favorite! Lauren!

563
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,109
Tootsie!

564
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,319
Champagne!

565
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,821
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

566
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,114
D.J.?

567
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:00,574
Stephanie?

568
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,951
No! No! Said no! No!

569
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,037
Cindy, Aaron with
the low-hangers.

570
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,872
April, get the
water bottles.

571
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,832
It's John, the one who
likes to hear you pee.

572
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,627
Mm. You sound like a redhead.
Do you have freckles on your dick?

573
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,837
See, what I do is just wait
till it comes out on DVD

574
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,422
and then I just
watch it all in a row.

575
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:17,216
Oh! Fuck,
that's my cervix!

576
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,469
Whoa, whoa! This is
still Billing!

577
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:23,597
Hi, it's Katie. Leave a message- Bye!

578
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,559
Hey, good job not calling me back.
Well done.

579
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:31,313
Is this number a beeper?
Because a human never answers. Jesus.

580
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,233
Oh, I love that smell.

581
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,443
Mm.

582
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,028
Can I lick it?

583
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:42,658
You're a dirty girl, Misty.
Oh, my God, you're gonna make me go.

584
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:46,411
Ooh, it's so good.
It's so good!

585
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,207
I want to get on
my hands and knees

586
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,584
and reverse
into that big cock.

587
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,629
Yeah, back it up.
Back it up.

588
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,094
Beep.

589
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,889
Beep, beep.

590
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,142
Beep.
Beep. 

591
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:13,355
Toot, toot! Oh!
Beep, beep! Toot, toot!

592
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:15,607
Beep, beep, beep, beep!

593
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:18,193
Beep, beep, beep, beep!

594
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:22,406
Loading dock! Loading dock!
Dick dock! Dick dock!

595
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:24,700
Yeah, fill me,
fill me up!

596
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:34,334
You all done? Okay, honey.
Call us back soon. Bye.

597
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:36,211
I thought he was
never gonna cum.

598
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,511
Welcome to Jersey,
ma'am.

599
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:54,813
You're right.
It really does open up the space.

600
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:56,064
Actually, I have
some things to tell you.

601
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,525
I've instated
a 10-minute minimum

602
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,819
so we don't have to waste time with
those two-pump Johnnys anymore.

603
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,446
I like it.
Okay.

604
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,572
Second, and this is
the big one.

605
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:04,656
Okay.

606
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,451
We've made $12,000
in three weeks!

607
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:08,577
No.
Yes.

608
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,037
Oh, my God!
I know!

609
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,665
And because of that, I felt like
just to be safe business-wise,

610
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,626
I incorporated us
so we're now an LL.

611
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,127
No shit!
Yes.

612
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,922
Well, fuck Grandma!
Can I get us that new couch?

613
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,465
Sure. Okay.

614
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,384
I really, really need you to drink
this green tea I made for you

615
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,178
because you're
getting all hoarse again.

616
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,222
I know. I got to
keep the throat lubed.

617
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:32,559
I have also been thinking
and I was wondering

618
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:34,686
if maybe we could
hire some dumb ass

619
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,772
to work for us
for $1 a minute?

620
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:39,733
Um...

621
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,026
Yeah. Yeah,
we could do that.

622
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:44,530
Perfect because
I already found her!

623
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,114
You did?
Yes. She writes...

624
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:49,243
"Dear slut talkers,
look no further.

625
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:52,955
"l scared my last boyfriend away
by how dirty I talked in bed.

626
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,790
"Here's a taste."

627
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,501
"Fuck my tits
until they're so raw,

628
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,419
"you have to move
down to my titty bitty..."

629
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:03,799
gritty bitty,
edible gummy-wear thong.

630
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:06,969
I am loud,
I am creative

631
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:10,347
and I love
giving phone blowiest.

632
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:14,726
So this is a nice couch.

633
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,772
And also, I've been
practicing my baby voice.

634
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,860
"That won't fit, mister!"

635
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:27,906
Not really for us. We really try
to stay away from the peso thing.

636
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,701
You do really sound like a baby,
though, so congrats on that.

637
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,328
M
av I?

638
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:36,832
Oh, the stripper pole?
Sure, go for a spin.

639
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,208
Has it been
used today?

640
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,585
KATIE: Not today.

641
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:40,961
Okay, great.

642
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,045
I love her!

643
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:43,172
Love her!

644
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,846
Look at you,
you're a natural.

645
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,056
So... You are
very flexible.

646
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:54,349
She's better than me.

647
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:55,475
Well, let's not...

648
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,561
Okay, we charge
a 10-minute minimum,

649
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:01,148
so the point is just keep the guys
on the call as long as possible.

650
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,901
Just make sure that they bring
up the sex stuff, okay?

651
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,319
You just small talk
from the get go

652
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,653
and see what
happens after that.

653
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:08,113
I'm from Maui

654
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:10,407
and I love to take
my cat to the dog park

655
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,451
on Sunday mornings
in my bikini.

656
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:16,997
I mean, it's perfect.
Amazing.

657
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,874
You got to be on your A-game,
though, for every call.

658
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,000
All right,
don't listen to this,

659
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,336
but I don't care if they wanna
take a pretend dump on your boobs.

660
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,921
You just roll with it
and act like it's sexy.

661
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,088
Can we see it?

662
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:30,511
Steamy!
I like it right there!

663
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,262
Ooh!

664
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:35,933
Get over here!
Welcome to our family!

665
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,444
I just came in my panties
and I'm a squinter, honey!

666
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:51,365
You wanna smell them?
'Cause they smell so good!

667
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:56,245
Yeah, you can have them for $29.95,
plus shipping and handling.

668
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:02,209
Good boy. I'm gonna make 'em
nice and wet just for you!

669
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,003
Surprise!
Hi! Hi!

670
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:06,880
Hello! Oh, my God!

671
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,423
Hi!

672
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,551
Daddy had an appointment
in the city this afternoon

673
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:11,969
and I wanted to check out
the sale at Barneys

674
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,720
and we figured as long as we
were in the neighborhood...

675
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:15,931
Your mother's lying.
So sorry we didn't call.

676
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,683
Okay. Just give me
one second, okay?

677
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:18,809
Sure.

678
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:22,813
Fuck.

679
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:27,067
I'm so glad Charlie let you
keep the dishes. That's only fair.

680
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,654
This is like the longest
hallway in Manhattan.

681
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,575
Brought your favorite, boo-boo kitty.
Magnolia!

682
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:35,701
Thanks, Mom!

683
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,412
Hello. Hello. Oh,
and this is a potted plant.

684
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,080
Great. Thank you.

685
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:42,583
Hit it!
I'm so close!

686
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,002
That's...

687
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:48,422
That's my roommate.
She's exercising in her room.

688
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,174
What is that?

689
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,925
Is that a stripper pole?

690
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,218
Oh!

691
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:54,970
Yeah, it is.

692
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:57,681
Oh, my God, is your
roommate a stripper?

693
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:01,768
No! Oh, my God. No, she's not a stripper!
She exercises on there.

694
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:02,895
You know,
it's good for your abs.

695
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,354
That's not structural.

696
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:07,191
Have one of these guys.
You had me worried for a second.

697
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,693
Actually, honey, Daddy and I
were in your account this week

698
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,446
to make
a little gift deposit.

699
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:13,697
You guys still
watch my account?

700
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,115
We couldn't help
but notice that

701
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,491
you have 10 grand
in that account.

702
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,453
Did Mort finally
give you that promotion?

703
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,997
Did he?

704
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,418
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

705
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:30,464
I know, I am so sorry.
I don't know why I forgot to tell you guys.

706
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,090
That's awesome.
Sweetie, it's just not like you

707
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,842
to keep these things
to yourself.

708
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:35,594
Scott! Adele!

709
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:39,806
Katie. Oh, God,
what a pleasure.

710
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,475
It's so nice to meet you.
You.

711
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,101
Well, okay.
Oh, my goodness.

712
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,187
Lauren didn't tell me
how good-looking you were.

713
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,648
Why don't you sit down?
Let's get to Know each other, then.

714
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:48,857
I would love that.

715
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:52,402
I would love to do that
because I love parents,

716
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:58,367
but our very good friend
Kristy is coming over

717
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,453
and she just
went through one of

718
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:04,581
the worst break-ups
I've ever been privy to.

719
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,500
Don't even get me started.
Oh, my God.

720
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,544
I told you this was gonna be a bad time.

721
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:10,128
You guys... We'll stop into
the city again really soon.

722
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:12,756
She's just heart-broken.
If we can just do this another time?

723
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,216
I understand. Okay.

724
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,467
They need some time.

725
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:17,219
Your promotion's a big deal.
We've got to celebrate.

726
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,346
I know.
Oh, thank you.

727
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:20,681
Oh, dear.

728
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,933
Look who I found,
just surviving.

729
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,518
You're doing good.
Hi.

730
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:25,853
Hi.
I'm Kristy.

731
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:30,065
Kristy, I'm Adele.
Sweetie, I know we just met, but listen,

732
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:31,775
life is full of
ups and downs

733
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:32,943
and good times will come again.
It is.

734
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,194
Adele and I were separated,
it worked out fine.

735
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:35,487
Come on, honey,
let's go.

736
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:36,697
Feel better, honey.

737
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,073
I'm gonna walk them out.
Okay.

738
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:39,616
Nice to
meet you, Katie.

739
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:46,331
There, there, sweet thing.
I've got you.

740
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:47,583
Okay.

741
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,834
I've got you. I do.

742
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,043
It's over, you guys.

743
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,170
Oh.
Oh.

744
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,505
Let's get this
fuck show started!

745
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,300
Please hold for Misty.

746
00:36:57,176 --> 00:37:00,095
Kristy!
It's John from San Jose!

747
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:04,391
Oh, God, it feels good
to have a night off.

748
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,310
I feel like I was always
meant to be an employer

749
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,270
and not an employee.

750
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,565
Do you remember the last
time we left this apartment?

751
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,151
No, I really don't.

752
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,485
Can I braid your hair?

753
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,822
Okay.

754
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:20,991
I want you to
go get a bowl of milk.

755
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,744
A very, very full
bowl of milk.

756
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:26,038
And then I want to
squat over top of it.

757
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:28,415
You're gonna dangle
your boys in there.

758
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,375
What's that, did I hear a
dog in the background?

759
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:34,046
Okay. I want you to go get some
kibble Yes, go get some kibble

760
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:36,590
I want you to take two pieces,
put them in your mouth.

761
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,592
Take three pieces and
put them in your bum.

762
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,720
Okay, do you have any
potted plants around you?

763
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,264
Okay, I want you to
go grab that potted plant.

764
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:45,349
Good. Did it crack?

765
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:46,934
Ooh. I like that.

766
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,311
Okay, now I want you
to crack all your toes.

767
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:50,771
Now, when you're
on the tenth one,

768
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:55,817
I want you to pull each lace out of
your shoe very slowly. Good boy.

769
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:57,486
Now, when you have
that lace out,

770
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,530
I want you to wrap it
around your balls.

771
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,615
You're gonna start
tugging really gentle.

772
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:04,785
Now, I'm gonna deliver you
a very special message

773
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:07,621
and when I do that, I want
you to pull real hard, okay?

774
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:09,248
You got that lace? Good.

775
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:11,959
Here's your special message,
Mr. Phone Caller.

776
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:15,504
Girl, you do a good braid.

777
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,383
I feel like she's talking
a lot of calls in there.

778
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,260
Do you wanna go check?
Yeah.

779
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:22,636
Okay.

780
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,180
 You've got your hairy
dick in your hand, yeah?

781
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:28,934
That plastic bag over your head?
You feel like a naughty boy?

782
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,646
You know who else thinks
you're a naughty boy? G-O-D.

783
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,816
Forget this number.
Do you want God to damn you to Hell?

784
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:38,402
Because he just did.

785
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,195
What the fuck!
Get the fuck off the phone!

786
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,030
We're running
a business here!

787
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:44,408
God bless you.
Jesus loves you.

788
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:49,079
Your business
is disgusting.

789
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:53,959
What is that?

790
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,043
It's a cross.

791
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:58,130
I know what it is!
I know what it is!

792
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:01,008
I am an undercover
agent of the Lord.

793
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,343
And you two didn't
even know. Even you.

794
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,345
And you seem smart.

795
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:07,431
I saved
some souls tonight

796
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:10,350
and that's more than I can say
for you two phone whores!

797
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,437
All right, well, obviously you're fired!
Out! Outwith you!

798
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,147
Get out!
Jesus loves you, too.

799
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,357
Come on!
Out, out, out!

800
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,859
Let there be
no filth in this...

801
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:20,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
We're Jews.

802
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:25,449
I don't
wanna hear it!

803
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,747
Oh, God, h’m cumming!

804
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,998
Amen!

805
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,962
Oh, my God.
Fucking Centralist.

806
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,465
What happened?

807
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:47,054
I just picked up
the phone and he came.

808
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:50,015
I should be
our second operator.

809
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,935
I don't wanna be
boring anymore.

810
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:55,938
Are you high?

811
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:57,397
I appreciate the sentiment,

812
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:59,983
but we just lost
half our callers

813
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:02,528
to fucking Jesus of
Nazareth back there.

814
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,157
Look, I will do
whatever you tell me to do.

815
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:10,661
I will lick whatever
you want me to lick.

816
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,248
I will make us so much money.

817
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm good at everything.
You know that.

818
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:19,336
All right.

819
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,714
I'm gonna take
a chance on you, kid.

820
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:25,968
We start training tomorrow.

821
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:31,473
Now, you just say the words
as I point to them, okay?

822
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:33,684
"Dripping, hole,
clenches."

823
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:34,768
Next.

824
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,770
"Hard, cock, jams."

825
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:37,813
Next.

826
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,940
"Wet, snatch, opens"

827
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,024
Say it like you mean it!

828
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,068
Okay, let's
give this a try.

829
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,237
There's a lot of
dildos in there.

830
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,197
What? I used to
work in a sex shop.

831
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:53,871
Oh, I love it when
your cock is in my mouth!

832
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:56,874
Now you try.

833
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,461
Has this ever been
in your...

834
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:04,214
Hello?

835
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,633
Tell me what you're wearing,
you dirty little slut.

836
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,427
Oh, it's this cute dress
from Cynthia Vincent.

837
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:11,763
Lauren! Hey, I thought we were
gonna take this seriously, right?

838
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:13,015
Harder!
Faster!

839
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,267
Harder!
Faster!

840
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:18,896
I'm wearing a lacy, pink thong.
It slid right up my ass.

841
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:22,482
And a bra that is just so
tight on my heaving breasts.

842
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:23,775
Good. Good.

843
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:31,241
I like it when
they're long and hard,

844
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:35,787
oh, when they really
are just so, so meaty.

845
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,669
Jesus, have you
murdered each other?

846
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:45,005
It's some real
War of the Roses shit.

847
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:46,507
I feel like Danny Devi to.
Call me.

848
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:53,680
I wanna rub your breasts
when I see you in that dress.

849
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:54,890
Mm-hmm.

850
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:56,767
I wanna rub my own breasts
when I see you in that dress.

851
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,937
Ooh, yeah?
Where else are you pink?

852
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,315
I wanna take you to dinner
when I see you in that dress.

853
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:06,276
Then, after dinner, I'm gonna take
you home and I'm gonna fuck you.

854
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:08,278
I'm gonna rip
that dress off you

855
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:09,780
and I'm gonna
fuck you so hard.

856
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:10,864
Cum for me, baby.

857
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:11,949
Loop!

858
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:16,119
Yes! Yes! Oh, I'm cumming! I'm cumming!
I'm cumming! I'm cumming!

859
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:19,081
Oh, God, yes!
Oh, yes.

860
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,838
Well, I just blew my load all over your tits.
I'll see you inside.

861
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,802
Hey, don't make fun of me, but I'm
gonna send you that essay I wrote.

862
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,637
You'd send you
that film I cut-

863
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,475
it's only the longest short
film in the history of cinema.

864
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,477
Is this the one
about the little man

865
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,437
that lives inside
of the cardigan?

866
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:46,733
No, this one is about the conjoined
twins who found happiness.

867
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,444
Oh, okay.

868
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:51,947
That's my other line,
but call me later

869
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,449
and let's talk
about them. Bye.

870
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:59,037
1-900-MM-HMM.

871
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:01,832
Uh, a three-way?

872
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:04,710
Um...

873
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:07,796
Yes, we can do that.

874
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:10,591
Hold for Billing, please.

875
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,343
Lauren!

876
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:16,180
You need me to
run the card?

877
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:20,851
Yes, and then
I need you to stay.

878
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,731
It's time for your
first call, honey.

879
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:29,693
Ready?

880
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,986
Yes.

881
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,202
Hi.

882
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:42,164
I'm Kitty and I'm
here with my friend.

883
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,501
Hello, L’Amour

884
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,378
scatty

885
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:50,297
Hello,
Kitty and Batty.

886
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,009
I guarantee you, that's gonna confuse
me once I start whacking off

887
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:56,136
but for now
that's okay.

888
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,891
I've heard you've been a bad
boy and I'm here to save you.

889
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:05,062
I'm actually the one who
will be doing the saving

890
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,773
because I am
a goddamn man

891
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:11,818
who flies people through the
sky on a bird made of steel.

892
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:16,907
I'm an airplane pilot and I'm
masturbating while taking a shit.

893
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,325
Tell me what you
ladies are wearing.

894
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:22,704
Well, Catty is
wearing a lace nightie

895
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:27,084
and I'm caressing her
with my tongue.

896
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,921
Okay. I'm starting to
masturbate and I'm done pooling.

897
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:33,423
What part of her
skin specifically

898
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:35,926
are you caressing
with your tongue?

899
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:39,596
My nipples.

900
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:41,181
Nice.

901
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:43,350
Okay. Great.

902
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,435
Now you know what
I want you guys to do?

903
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,522
I want you to put your tongues
on a collision course

904
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,732
and just ram
those fuckers.

905
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:51,859
Ram tongues.

906
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:02,870
Catty is... Oh,
she's such a good kisser.

907
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,165
Her lips are so
luscious and wet.

908
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:09,793
Okay, so, Catty,

909
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:13,088
what do Kitty's
underpants look like?

910
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:17,217
Oh! They're so cute!

911
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:21,722
I mean, they're....
Well, they're leopard print.

912
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:26,476
There is an animal up
her tight, sexy ass.

913
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:29,313
Nice.

914
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,024
Kitty, what do Patty’s
underpants look like?

915
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:36,153
She's not wearing any panties.
Do you like that?

916
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,531
No, I don't. I think that's
gross, to be totally honest.

917
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:40,616
You're just, what?

918
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:43,869
You're just sweating vagina
juice in your jeans all day?

919
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:45,537
That's disgusting.
Put on underpants.

920
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:49,583
Tell me when you have them on.
So I can keep masturbating.

921
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,876
MAN: Jerry, come on,
the flight's about to leave.

922
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:53,587
Dude, I'm jerking off in here,
right this second, literally,

923
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,381
and you're ruining it.
Just delay the flight, okay?

924
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:00,844
Now, Catty, look at Kitty
and tell me what you see.

925
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,855
She's so pretty.

926
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:17,110
She has the most
beautiful eyes.

927
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:22,533
And her hair is
soft around her face.

928
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,120
And Catty is
so beautiful.

929
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:33,210
She has this luminous skin
that I would kill for.

930
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:37,798
She is so nice
and honest,

931
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:39,716
and such a good friend.

932
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:45,055
Kitty is just so
fun and outgoing

933
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:48,392
and she lights up
every room.

934
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,562
And she gives
great manicures.

935
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:57,609
You guys have any dildos or
anything like that around?

936
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:18,338
Listen, last nightwatchmen

937
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:22,801
You made me proud.
You're a real phone sex operator now.

938
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:24,970
I know.

939
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:27,764
I'm a slut.

940
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,392
Is it okay I'm a slut?

941
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:31,768
Yeah.

942
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:36,231
A slut that made
$800 in one night!

943
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:43,530
I don't know if I'm just,
like, being emotional

944
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:45,324
because of last night
or whatever,

945
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,202
but I want you to stay.

946
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:51,413
Really stay.
Past the summer.

947
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:54,082
Okay.

948
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,710
Pinky swear.

949
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:10,641
I have a friend who's a girl.
And I like it!

950
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:15,145
You can't take that job at Caxton Publishing.
Let's go full time.

951
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:16,522
Okay.

952
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:18,690
It's Caxton Press.

953
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,568
And last night
was my first night,

954
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:23,278
so let's just take this
as it comes, okay?

955
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:26,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I get it.

956
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,575
I almost forgot.

957
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:31,870
We're gonna be twins!

958
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,750
I'll have you know
I schlepped all the way

959
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,502
to Brooklyn to
get this for you.

960
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:41,129
I will not let you down.

961
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:46,844
I'm only giving it to you because
you said I had a nice ass.

962
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,770
Mm. Eat me
for lunch at your desk!

963
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,025
That feels so good.

964
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:05,112
Do you have a big calculator?

965
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:09,241
I have to pee so bad!
It's Harold, our new tax attorney.

966
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:10,701
HAROLD: I got a big calculation
I got the biggest!

967
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:13,328
Yeah, I got a big
calculator for you.

968
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:18,792
I want you to
press 5-8-0-0-8.

969
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:22,212
You know what
that spells? "Boobs."

970
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:24,298
Audit me, Harold!

971
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:28,927
Inspect every inch of my bod
with a fine-tooth comb.

972
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:30,971
I'm about to jazz!

973
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:32,973
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

974
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:34,892
I think you
found my loophole!

975
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:37,853
It happened!

976
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,147
Pleasure doing
business with you, Harry.

977
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,817
Hey, can you fax over
those I-9? Okay. Bye.

978
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:46,278
Okay, bye-bye.
Thank you. Bye.

979
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:49,740
Becky!

980
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:53,702
Thank you.
What a relief.

981
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,040
You're welcome.

982
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:00,834
Is that a gift for me?
Yes.

983
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:03,420
And I have one, too,
and we're going out.

984
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:08,133
Oh, my God!

985
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,303
We're matching!

986
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:13,680
Let's start with
the artichoke dip.

987
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,850
Yes, and then do you maybe wanna
do like the brown sugar pork?

988
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:18,644
Yes, and like a salad.
With dressing on the side?

989
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:20,270
With dressing on the side, of course.
Okay, good.

990
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:24,024
Okay. What is going on here?

991
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,443
Let's just tell him.

992
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:28,612
Are you guys scissor dancing?
Honestly.

993
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,364
You know, I hate lesbians,
but you have to tell me.

994
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:32,199
I'll make an exception,
I'll get past it for you two.

995
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:34,159
No!
What then?

996
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:38,372
We are running a phone sex line.
Boom!

997
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:40,707
Shut up.

998
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,251
Not my idea!

999
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:43,585
And this doesn't
make me a whore!

1000
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:46,213
A whore? No!
This makes you awesome!

1001
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:49,550
She just phone-fucked the
shit out of our accountant.

1002
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:51,844
What's going on?

1003
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:54,805
What? Wait, wait, wait, wait!
But what happened to Lawson Press?

1004
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,724
Caxton Press, and that bitch
never called me back, so...

1005
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:59,810
Screw her! She has me.

1006
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:00,978
Wow.

1007
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:05,315
You ladies are living some fucked-up
version of the American dream.

1008
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:07,568
You have to tell me,
what do these guys say?

1009
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:10,237
Is it all like penis in vagina?
Where do the dicks go?

1010
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,573
I've had phone anal.

1011
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:15,242
You had phantom?
Oh, my God, I'm so good at that!

1012
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:16,451
Can I work for you guys?

1013
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:17,703
No! it's girls only.

1014
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:19,246
No.

1015
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:22,124
This stinks.
No fair.

1016
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:24,918
I could be the unicorn
this time if you want.

1017
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:27,713
Actually, I was
thinking since we both...

1018
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:31,717
Hey, sorry I wasn't here
for your call at 10:00,

1019
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,886
but I had to get
out of this apartment.

1020
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,305
You know, it's okay.

1021
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:39,808
I was thinking
maybe we could meet up?

1022
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:42,144
In person?

1023
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:44,646
What?

1024
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,941
Well, we haven't had
phone sex in a week

1025
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:50,110
and we still
talk every day.

1026
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:53,614
And I loved your essay

1027
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:55,407
and you made it
through my short film.

1028
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:57,868
It's kind of like
we're already dating,

1029
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:01,872
so I thought maybe we could meet up?
Like Friday?

1030
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,126
Hello?

1031
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,797
I fucked this up.
I'm sorry.

1032
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:11,965
Okay, let's do it.

1033
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:13,133
Really?

1034
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:15,010
You don't have to.

1035
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:18,180
No. No, Wantoner.

1036
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:20,015
I do, I really want to.

1037
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:23,519
Quandary, I can't wait to meet you.

1038
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:25,437
Oh, yeah.

1039
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:27,272
Um...

1040
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:30,567
Actually my name
is Katie.

1041
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,277
Hello.

1042
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,446
Lauren?

1043
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,574
Lauren? Lauren?

1044
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:41,036
Hey. What?

1045
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:45,290
What were you
doing in there?

1046
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:46,667
I was working. What?

1047
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,128
Did you just
have phone sex?

1048
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:52,506
Do we not run
a phone sex line?

1049
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:55,092
Well, yeah, but...

1050
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:59,179
You slut! You just put
your fingers in your puss!

1051
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,014
O! NO!

1052
00:53:01,098 --> 00:53:03,851
You know that a little pony
dies every time you do that.

1053
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:05,769
Did you wash your hands?

1054
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,230
Maybe I didn't!
E!

1055
00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:09,982
Whatever.
You must do it all the time.

1056
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:11,316
E. No.

1057
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:14,194
You're not that
good of an actress.

1058
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,445
Anyways...

1059
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:17,197
Um...

1060
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:20,701
10:00 Sean lives in Brooklyn.
That is not just a billing address.

1061
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:25,122
And now we have
a date on Friday night.

1062
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:27,291
So.

1063
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:28,625
No.

1064
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:30,043
Why nor?

1065
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,129
I don't know, 'cause
he's probably a rapist.

1066
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:36,383
Oh, please! Don't judge him.
You and I are the ones on the phone.

1067
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:38,302
Please?

1068
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:42,306
I haven't been on
a date in forever.

1069
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:44,933
Now I've had a taste
of the outside world!

1070
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:47,269
I want more!

1071
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:50,189
It's just gonna be
a cool bar in Brooklyn.

1072
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:52,774
I'll come home,
I promise.

1073
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:56,695
Fine. But you
play by my rules.

1074
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:58,655
What are your rules?

1075
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:01,325
You'll see on Friday,
won't you?

1076
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:03,577
Is that a new shower head?

1077
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,370
Yeah.

1078
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:08,749
It pulsates. On my body.

1079
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,668
Cute dance.

1080
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,337
Okay. That's good.

1081
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:16,173
I, literally, never wanna
see that dance ever again.

1082
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,425
Oh! You just blinded me
with that dance.

1083
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:19,718
I am now blinded.

1084
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:39,446
These are the rules.

1085
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,198
Step one, put these on.

1086
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:42,699
Way too small for me.

1087
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:43,867
That's the point, okay?

1088
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:45,786
10:00 will never be
able to get in these.

1089
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:48,330
It is rape-prevention
wear at its best.

1090
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:50,415
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1091
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:52,042
Okay, step two.

1092
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:54,878
Bug spray.

1093
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:56,046
What?

1094
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:57,881
I didn't know where to buy
mace and I just figured

1095
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:00,592
it'll do the same thing when
you spray him in the face.

1096
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:02,845
What the hell kind of purse
would that even fit in?

1097
00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:05,180
You can borrow my tote.

1098
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:07,641
I've already filled it
with some other stuff.

1099
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:11,061
What, no canned goods
for my survival?

1100
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:16,567
All right, I'll take it.
Hell, throw it in my new tote bag!

1101
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:23,365
I am ready to
survive date rape!

1102
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:24,908
Ta-DA!

1103
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,206
Can I please get
one drink? Please?

1104
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,834
My blood alcohol
level's dangerously low.

1105
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:35,627
No, you're leaving.

1106
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:37,504
Don't make me go.
I don't wanna go back to that apartment.

1107
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:38,839
I'm outside.
Guys!

1108
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:40,174
Is that him?
Is that him?

1109
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,258
He looks like
T.T. Barber.

1110
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:44,094
All right, I need you both to,
like, bring it down a notch.

1111
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,346
All right? I will
know him when I see him.

1112
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:47,848
Is that him?

1113
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:51,476
Look at that lumberjack.
A lot of bears here.

1114
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,769
You like a bear.
I like a bear.

1115
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:56,648
Katie?

1116
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:58,942
Yes.

1117
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,361
Hi.
Hi.

1118
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:06,200
Wow! You are really pretty.

1119
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:09,328
And you are
really pretty, too.

1120
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:11,955
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were bringing people.

1121
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:13,582
That's cool.

1122
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:15,250
These are just my
overprotective friends

1123
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:17,794
that are gonna be
leaving in a second.

1124
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,129
I'm Katie's
Lauren. Hello.

1125
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:20,380
Hi.

1126
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:21,798
What's up, man?
Jesse Lawson. Hey.

1127
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:22,883
How are you doing?
Good.

1128
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:25,552
You like comedy?
Do you like to laugh?

1129
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:28,096
Check it out.
You're welcome to come.

1130
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,516
It's a $10 cover.
Two drink minimum.

1131
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:31,600
Great.
Yeah.

1132
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:32,893
Okay.
Awesome.

1133
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:35,062
Okay, good.
I'm good, guys.

1134
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:37,064
My word.
Nice to meet you.

1135
00:56:37,147 --> 00:56:39,107
Nice meeting you.
Bye.

1136
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:40,984
I'm just gonna
say this.

1137
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:42,486
I do not think
it's weird at all

1138
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:43,946
that you guys met
on a phone sex line.

1139
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:46,198
I don't think it's weird.
'Cause, you know what? Fuck it.

1140
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:47,741
Life is weird, right?
Let's go.

1141
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:49,034
No. I was in
the shower this morning

1142
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:50,118
and have you ever
thought about hair?

1143
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:51,578
Think about human hair.
Let's go.

1144
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:52,746
Somme’s curly, somersault
it's weird.

1145
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:53,956
Bye.

1146
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,707
Don't worry about it.
All right.

1147
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:56,834
Sorry. Sweet.

1148
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:57,918
Yes.

1149
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,628
Sweet as can be.
And very funny.

1150
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:02,714
Yeah. Well, he's a
comedian, you know, so.

1151
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:07,177
Nice to finally meet you.

1152
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,316
All right. Let’s do it.

1153
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,734
Ready. Okay.

1154
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:24,444
Cheers.
Cheers.

1155
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:30,617
You're right. This is so much more
comfortable than being at the bar.

1156
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:32,077
Can I open my eyes now?
No.

1157
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,121
You cannot look at me
and I cannot look at you.

1158
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:36,915
It's easier this way.
Trust me.

1159
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:43,714
You know, I approached two other
girls before I found you.

1160
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,717
I met a Christina
and a Lily.

1161
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:49,428
No, you didn’t

1162
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,513
I saw you walk in and you
walked right towards me.

1163
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:54,641
No, I know, you're right.
I knew it was you.

1164
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:57,102
You're cute.

1165
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:59,313
You better not be peeking.

1166
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:00,606
I'm not.

1167
00:58:02,608 --> 00:58:05,027
Let's open our
eyes anyway, okay?

1168
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:06,945
Okay.
Okay.

1169
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:08,155
Count of three.

1170
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:12,284
One, two, three.

1171
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:26,548
Put it anywhere.

1172
00:58:26,632 --> 00:58:27,633
Lauren!

1173
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:29,218
Put it anywhere.

1174
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:31,136
You're home!
How was it?

1175
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:33,263
It was great!

1176
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:35,057
Did you smoke
that whole joint?

1177
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,183
Uh-huh.

1178
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:37,434
Tell me about your date.

1179
00:58:38,936 --> 00:58:40,771
It was amazing.

1180
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:45,442
Twas, like, the best date
I have ever been on.

1181
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:47,319
It was never awkward.

1182
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:51,031
And then we started kissing,
which, by the way, was just...

1183
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:52,449
He was so good.

1184
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:55,285
And then...

1185
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,787
What? Did he get
in my Span?

1186
00:58:57,287 --> 00:58:58,372
No.

1187
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:01,875
What?

1188
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:06,004
Well, I got my period
when I was 12

1189
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:07,840
and I wasn't
Close with my mom,

1190
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:10,217
so I called my older,
cooler cousin Wendy

1191
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,677
and I went over to her house.

1192
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,471
I bike ride-ed over and she
brought me into the bathroom

1193
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:16,890
to do the whole tampon tutorial,
you know what I mean?

1194
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:20,519
And like we're standing there,
legs open, flaps open.

1195
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:21,812
Are you with me?

1196
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:23,564
Mm-hmm. I'm just stoned.
Okay.

1197
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:26,358
And jamming it up there
and I'm trying to make it fit

1198
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:28,902
and there's blood everywhere

1199
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:31,989
and it just looks like
this horrible murder scene

1200
00:59:32,072 --> 00:59:35,576
and I look over and
that's when I see it.

1201
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:38,954
A wart.

1202
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,415
You had genital warts
at 12?

1203
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:44,585
Not on me!
On Wendy's left Labia!

1204
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:46,086
And she saw me see it.

1205
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:49,339
Obviously I was horrified, and
that's when she said it to me,

1206
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:53,093
"if you don't want one of these,
don't have sex in high school.

1207
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:57,097
"After that, just make sure you're
in love with whoever it is."

1208
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:01,727
And no one was
ever in love with me.

1209
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:10,777
I'm a virgin.

1210
01:00:15,866 --> 01:00:17,868
Oh, no, no, no.

1211
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:20,495
No, that can't be true.

1212
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:22,122
Yes, it is.

1213
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:25,292
I've never even
had a boyfriend.

1214
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:28,295
But I went to
college with you.

1215
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:30,047
I thought you
were the school slut.

1216
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:33,634
Well, that's what everyone thought.
But I wasn't doing any of it.

1217
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:36,261
I was just
talking a lot of shit.

1218
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:40,724
And then I just got so scared around
guys, I would just like clam up.

1219
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,937
You just...

1220
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:46,730
All the time?

1221
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:50,776
You don't ever?

1222
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:58,867
Just stop looking at me!
I'm just all talk, literally!

1223
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:01,453
Okay.

1224
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:05,624
Tina Fey lost her
virginity at, like, 27.

1225
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:08,418
Okay? And she's
pretty cool, I think.

1226
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:12,714
And you are gonna be
mind-blowing at sex.

1227
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:15,467
I mean, if your body
can keep up with your mouth,

1228
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:18,387
you are gonna make some guy's
head just pop right off his neck.

1229
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:21,765
And being in love
when you do it?

1230
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:23,267
Only gonna make it better.

1231
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,603
I have an idea.

1232
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,152
Bum-bad-bum!

1233
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,573
These are yours.
Use them.

1234
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,951
That way,
when you're ready for Sean,

1235
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:44,621
or whoever else is lucky enough
to fall in love with you,

1236
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,165
you'll be ready.

1237
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:50,919
Okay.

1238
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:54,965
Maybe not Earl.

1239
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,929
How about this one? Kevin.

1240
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:06,643
Thanks, Re.

1241
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:21,366


1242
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:27,915
1-900-MM-HMM.

1243
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:32,419
T Hat’s 1-900-M-M-M-H-M-M-M.

1244
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:34,755
And cut!

1245
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,173
Yeah, it's still
feeling a little stiff.

1246
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:37,591
Really?

1247
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:40,302
Well, no, I mean, I'd call.
I mean, I already did call.

1248
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:41,803
Maybe you guys
should have a drink.

1249
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:43,347
It doesn't take much,
friend.

1250
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,432
Can you get me
a glass of wine, please?

1251
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:47,309
Will you get me a glass
of wine, please, too?

1252
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:50,812
Yeah, fine. I just think a little
bit more like, "Are you alone?"

1253
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:53,106
Well, we'll talk about it.
I just felt like you weren't in the tub.

1254
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,858
All right.
We'll do better!

1255
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:56,610
Thank you.
Thank you!

1256
01:02:56,693 --> 01:02:57,945
I just
saw your nipple!

1257
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:12,042
I can never find
my keys in this bag.

1258
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:15,629
I don't know why you don't
use that zipper compartment.

1259
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:19,424
Oh, my God.
it's Caxton Press!

1260
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:24,471
Well, I'm not gonna get it.
I'm never talking to that bitch ever again.

1261
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:26,682
No, get it!
I have an idea.

1262
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:28,392
Get it!

1263
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:30,727
Hello? This is
Lauren Powell.

1264
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:40,863
You are a vision in
my dress! My God!

1265
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:44,116
I want to go with you
to the interview.

1266
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:46,994
I can't believe I'm gonna tell
Caxton Press to shove it.

1267
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:48,036
Are you sure I'm
doing the right thing?

1268
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,162
Yes!

1269
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:51,582
You have nothing to lose.
It's not like you're gonna work there.

1270
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,834
Go in there and tell her what
a good phone fucker you are

1271
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,252
and then come home to me
and we can celebrate

1272
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:56,712
'cause it's commercial night!

1273
01:03:58,589 --> 01:03:59,965
I have something
I wanna say.

1274
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:01,466
Have you been
masturbating again?

1275
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,885
Because you don't have
to tell me every time.

1276
01:04:02,968 --> 01:04:05,220
No, no, no, no.
It's not that.

1277
01:04:06,638 --> 01:04:08,765
I love you.

1278
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:20,694
Should we hug or something?

1279
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:24,323
Yeah.

1280
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:25,449
Okay!

1281
01:04:32,456 --> 01:04:33,582
Okay.

1282
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:37,211
Go have fun at
your bogus interview.

1283
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:41,048
Make that lady feel sorry she never
hired you in the first place.

1284
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:42,341
Hmm.

1285
01:04:43,592 --> 01:04:44,801
You're different.

1286
01:04:46,637 --> 01:04:48,055
What's going on here?

1287
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:50,224
Oh!

1288
01:04:50,307 --> 01:04:51,558
Oh.

1289
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:53,393
I've been running
a phone sex line.

1290
01:04:53,477 --> 01:04:57,064
You? Yeah,
that's funny.

1291
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:00,943
For reals?

1292
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:02,402
Is it for charity?

1293
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,030
Hi, Jess.

1294
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:06,406
Hi, Katie!

1295
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:07,491
I'm here with Zelda.

1296
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:10,369
Doesn't she look a lot like
a young Carol Canning?

1297
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:11,703
She's so cute.

1298
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:13,622
Hey, who's ready
to put some of

1299
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:15,541
my famous bean dip
in their mouths

1300
01:05:15,624 --> 01:05:18,627
while watching the first cut
of our phone sex commercial?

1301
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:20,254
I am! I am!

1302
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:21,797
Ooh-ooh!

1303
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,382
Hey, is Lauren back yet?

1304
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:25,717
From her power play
interview? No, not yet.

1305
01:05:25,801 --> 01:05:28,095
I have to say, I think
what you guys are doing

1306
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,514
is so weird and
Single White Female-y,

1307
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:35,352
but then again, I'm stroking
Zelda like I'm a Bond villain.

1308
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:36,895
So, who am I to
talk about weird?

1309
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:38,272
Did you get the DVD?

1310
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:39,648
Yes,
it's already in the player.

1311
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:43,944
Wait, somebody's here. I got to go.
I can't wait to see you. Bye!

1312
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,737
We're back!
Hey.

1313
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,783
Hi.

1314
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:52,411
Can we come in?

1315
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:54,204
Yes, yes, please.
Come on in.

1316
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:55,289
Nice to see you.

1317
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:56,373
Nice to see you!

1318
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:57,457
Hey, you.

1319
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:58,542
And you!

1320
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:00,961
We could really use
a strong female editor

1321
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:03,172
that wants to grow
with our company.

1322
01:06:03,255 --> 01:06:07,467
Just somebody like you that
understands a good business model.

1323
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:10,804
I know you've had a fun
summer doing phone sex.

1324
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:12,890
It's a phase.
I love a good phase.

1325
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:13,974
I'm a hasbian.

1326
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:16,560
I made love to a woman with
crooked bangs for six months.

1327
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:18,228
Are you following me
back to reality?

1328
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:20,480
'Cause what happens?

1329
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:23,066
What happens when you're
crossing Seventh Avenue,

1330
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,152
holding that hot soy latte,

1331
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:29,406
and a cab comes out of nowhere
and just takes you out?

1332
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:32,409
And you don't
have benefits?

1333
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:43,003
Are you really gonna be a phone sex
operator the rest of your life?

1334
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:45,255
Take the job, Lauren.

1335
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:50,844
This place
just looks great.

1336
01:06:50,928 --> 01:06:53,514
The balloons are
really festive.

1337
01:06:53,597 --> 01:06:54,973
Thank you.

1338
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:56,517
Hard not to
focus on this here.

1339
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,851
This...

1340
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:02,439
What? What are you talking about?
Just kidding.

1341
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:03,690
I know.

1342
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:07,945
We're having a bachelorette
party here tonight

1343
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:11,698
and I had 'em and I thought, "Hell,
I'll throw 'em on the table."

1344
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,575
Titty fuck me!

1345
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:15,035
Stoop sale.

1346
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,621
You get the damnedest
things there.

1347
01:07:18,664 --> 01:07:20,874
You guys,
I just wanna tell you

1348
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:24,837
Lauren and I have been having
such an amazing summer.

1349
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,880
I honestly feel
like she is my sister.

1350
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:31,134
Which, cha-ching,
makes you guys my parents!

1351
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:33,720
I always wanted normal parents.

1352
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:34,972
Hi.

1353
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:40,394
What time was
her appointment?

1354
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:41,937
2:00.
It was at 2:00.

1355
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,898
Man, I cannot wait to
hear about that, huh?

1356
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:46,650
Hi. Another surprise visit?

1357
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:48,402
There's my girl!

1358
01:07:49,736 --> 01:07:52,906
Honey, my goodness, what
are you wearing, sweetie?

1359
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:54,241
I can see your bra.

1360
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:56,410
Never mind.
Sweetheart, you get the job?

1361
01:07:56,493 --> 01:07:57,494
HOW was it?

1362
01:07:57,619 --> 01:07:58,579
It was really good.

1363
01:07:58,662 --> 01:08:00,289
It was a great interview.

1364
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:02,499
They actually offered me
the job right on the spot.

1365
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:06,587
I know, it has insurance
and a 401 (K) plan.

1366
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,339
The position is really,
really fantastic.

1367
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:12,342
So...

1368
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:15,470
So I took it.

1369
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:17,556
This is great news!
We have to celebrate!

1370
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:20,601
Are you serious?

1371
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:22,019
Honey, I am so proud.

1372
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,645
Why don't you change
and we'll all go

1373
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:25,230
have a big lunch
at Elizabeth’s.

1374
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:26,607
Put on something
that fits

1375
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,609
'cause you know we always run
into Daddy's work friends there.

1376
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:32,446
Katie, why don't you
come to my room with me

1377
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:34,031
and you can help me
pick out an outfit,

1378
01:08:34,156 --> 01:08:35,699
and I'll tell you
more about the job.

1379
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:38,410
I'm sure you'll be
fine on your own.

1380
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:40,913
Okay.

1381
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:54,384
Mom, Dad.

1382
01:08:55,552 --> 01:08:58,180
I would love to tell you more
about our special summer

1383
01:08:58,263 --> 01:09:01,558
because Lauren has been so shy
about it, but at our party tonight

1384
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:03,644
we were gonna have a screening
of something we made

1385
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:05,354
and I would love to
share it with you. Please.

1386
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:07,064
Sure.
Come with me, will you?

1387
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,399
Oh! So exciting!
I love an audience.

1388
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:14,112
Oh, hi.

1389
01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:17,824
It's nice to see you.

1390
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:23,413
Do you ever wonder why
you're alone in the tub?

1391
01:09:24,831 --> 01:09:27,209
It's so lonely when you're
in the tub alone, isn't it?

1392
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:30,712
You don't have to
be so lonely anymore.

1393
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,090
If you have one of these.

1394
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:36,593
You can just
give me a call.

1395
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:45,936
The bubbles were all
her idea, by the way.

1396
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:49,481
I mean, she's a smart
cookie, that one.

1397
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:50,607
I'm gonna be sick.

1398
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:51,692
What the hell is
wrong with you?

1399
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,318
What? I was just
catching your parents up

1400
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:55,028
on what a beautiful
summer we've had.

1401
01:09:55,112 --> 01:09:57,281
While we're at it, should I tell
them about how Mort fired you?

1402
01:09:57,364 --> 01:10:00,534
Or do you wanna tell them? Oops!
Cat's out of the bag, sorry.

1403
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:04,413
I should have never
moved in with you.

1404
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:06,331
If you'll excuse me,
I have an errand to run.

1405
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,920
It's dirty money.

1406
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:17,384
Okay. I know that you're really
more of a business manager

1407
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:20,762
and you're not actually
listening to guys...

1408
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:52,377
I know you're mad.

1409
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:57,216
Just because you don't give
a shit about your parents

1410
01:10:57,299 --> 01:11:00,344
doesn't mean
I don't care about mine.

1411
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:02,179
I know.

1412
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,267
And I'm sorry. Okay?

1413
01:11:07,351 --> 01:11:10,854
No. No, it is not okay!

1414
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:13,815
You lied to me!

1415
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:17,069
I did not know that
I was gonna take thatjob.

1416
01:11:17,152 --> 01:11:20,697
And it's not even that big of a deal.
I can still help out here.

1417
01:11:20,781 --> 01:11:22,699
Well, don't
do me any favors.

1418
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:25,452
If you were my real friend, you would
understand why I took thatjob.

1419
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:27,663
Excuse me! Real friend?

1420
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:30,040
I am not the one that
lied to my partner today.

1421
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:34,419
That's hilarious, because last time I
checked, you lied about being a whore.

1422
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:36,505
I go off and I do
one thing by myself

1423
01:11:36,588 --> 01:11:39,758
and you prove to be
some insecure virgin.

1424
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:51,228
You make me feel like I will
never be good enough for you.

1425
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:56,525
So why don't you and your
shit get out of my apartment?

1426
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,074
This is our apartment.

1427
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:08,912
I told you I loved you
this morning.

1428
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:13,083
And you were too
scared to say it back.

1429
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:16,253
I wasn't too scared.

1430
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:20,215
I just don't love you.

1431
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:25,554
Who wants some bean dip?

1432
01:12:33,312 --> 01:12:34,813
Oh, yeah,
that feels good.

1433
01:12:38,942 --> 01:12:39,985
Oh, yeah.

1434
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:43,572
Yeah, I want you to
finger-bang me in the shower.

1435
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,325
Uh...

1436
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:49,077
Why don't you just flip me
over and do me from behind?

1437
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:50,621
Are you even listening?

1438
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:52,331
No, I do like it.

1439
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:54,791
It's so depressing.

1440
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:57,711
You know, I call you,
I get one phone call a week.

1441
01:12:57,794 --> 01:12:59,046
This is
so fucking depressing.

1442
01:12:59,129 --> 01:13:03,050
This is more depressing than the
macaroni necklace that my kid sends me.

1443
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:05,093
What the shit am I supposed
to do with that in here?

1444
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:07,763
Just tell me
what you want.

1445
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:11,266
Well, what I want, Sandy,

1446
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,852
is for you to get your head
in the fucking game!

1447
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:15,270
That's what I want!

1448
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:18,649
What I want is for you to start
taking Discover card again.

1449
01:13:18,732 --> 01:13:20,651
That's the one
we use in here.

1450
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:23,612
What I want is for you
to keep doing two on ones.

1451
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:27,407
What I want is to not have to
make a dildo out of soap, okay?

1452
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:28,617
It hurts!

1453
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,494
It takes a longtime.

1454
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:32,829
But you know that's not
what we all get.

1455
01:13:32,913 --> 01:13:34,289
We don't all get that.

1456
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:38,126
But now what I'm gonna have to
do, what I didn't want to do,

1457
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:42,339
is go to your house
and steal your fucking dog,

1458
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:44,758
and then steal your car.

1459
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:46,593
And then, when you come
outside to look for your dog,

1460
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:48,679
you'll say, "Oh, where's my dog?
Where's my dog?"

1461
01:13:48,762 --> 01:13:51,306
Oh, bam!
I'm gonna hit you with my car!

1462
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:56,186
I'm gonna vehicular manslaughter
you because that is what I do.

1463
01:13:57,104 --> 01:13:58,230
That's what I do.

1464
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:00,148
I don't even have a car.

1465
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:04,570
I'll lick your pussy.

1466
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:09,449
No, you don't wanna do that.
We don't get razors in here.

1467
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:11,451
Kind of lost the
mood now, anyway.

1468
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:23,922
Lauren.

1469
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:27,134
Happy hour.
Ruby Foo's. Sake bombs.

1470
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:29,553
4:00 to 7:00, half price,
all the apps you can eat.

1471
01:14:29,636 --> 01:14:31,638
Hot Asian guys. Let's go.

1472
01:14:31,722 --> 01:14:34,224
Okay, just
give me a minute.

1473
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:38,312
I have a plan.

1474
01:14:38,395 --> 01:14:39,563
Yeah?

1475
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:40,939
Yeah. My lease is up soon.

1476
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:43,483
I could move in here
with you.

1477
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:45,277
Ohh.

1478
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,821
Yeah. No.
We're not there yet.

1479
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:51,325
But thanks for offering.

1480
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:55,078
We should probably, like, have
sex before we live together.

1481
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:57,247
Yes. That's a great idea.

1482
01:14:57,331 --> 01:14:59,833
Not today. But...

1483
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:02,252
...soon.

1484
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:06,381
Thank you so much for
letting me stay here.

1485
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:09,009
I promise, I'm gonna
find a place so soon.

1486
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:11,512
No, I totally
like having you here.

1487
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:16,099
I love having my own living space, though.
But, you know.

1488
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:17,226
God, this Greek yogurt
is so good.

1489
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:21,480
Who is that?

1490
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:22,523
I'm gonna take this.
I'll be right back.

1491
01:15:22,606 --> 01:15:24,024
Who is that?
Who is it?

1492
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:30,614
Oh, girl. Who has
she replaced me with?

1493
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:33,408
You're never gonna
replace me, are you?

1494
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:35,827
'Cause I love you.

1495
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:44,503
Do you have any tens?

1496
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,840
No, I do not.
You must go fish.

1497
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:51,885
Do you have any sixes?

1498
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:55,931
Yes! Do you
have any fives?

1499
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:01,728
This is stupid.

1500
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:06,108
Stop being such
a girl and call Lauren.

1501
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:14,032
Let's have sex.

1502
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:17,578
Come on.

1503
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:18,662
Okay.

1504
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:21,999
Oh, wow.

1505
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:27,462
Now what?

1506
01:16:27,546 --> 01:16:30,632
And the wine and the cheese
and the gelato and...

1507
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:33,927
Just everything about it was so fresh.
It was vivacious.

1508
01:16:34,011 --> 01:16:37,139
And so, on this one day, I
decided to take a little stroll.

1509
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:38,932
You know,
I'm feeling high on life.

1510
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:42,102
You know, the case is going
great, so I walk up this hill

1511
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:43,854
and I'm walking up,
and all of a sudden

1512
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:45,647
I see this little
shoe shop in the corner.

1513
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:49,568
Okay, and I'm walking in and this old
couple, they fall in love with me.

1514
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:51,612
I mean, they just take me in
like I'm their own.

1515
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:53,572
The old woman, you know,
she's probably 82,

1516
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:56,158
she starts making
risotto and it smells...

1517
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:57,701
You would love it,
it smells so good.

1518
01:16:57,784 --> 01:17:00,078
And the old man, he gets
out this old contraption

1519
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:01,455
and he starts
measuring my feet.

1520
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:03,582
And then it starts
raining outside, pouring.

1521
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:05,125
So I said to the guy,
"Listen, I got to go.

1522
01:17:05,209 --> 01:17:07,753
"You Know, thank you.
I had a great time. I got to leave."

1523
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:10,214
And he grabs my shoe
and he won't let me go.

1524
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:11,965
And he...

1525
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:13,383
L.M

1526
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:16,803
How's the newjob?
How's that?

1527
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:19,431
It's good. it's really good.
I'm learning...

1528
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:21,308
That's great. Listen.

1529
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:24,937
I forgot to tell you.
They are grooming me for partner

1530
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,190
now that I saved
the job in Italy.

1531
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:32,319
And, you know, I'm kind
of enjoying the job now.

1532
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:34,321
Kind of a thing,
so that's good.

1533
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:46,166
You okay?

1534
01:17:48,168 --> 01:17:49,336
Mm-hmm.

1535
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,510
Is that okay?

1536
01:17:58,262 --> 01:18:00,639
Sorry, I get a little...
I'm just so nervous.

1537
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:02,933
It's okay.
It's okay, just...

1538
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:05,185
Just relax.

1539
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:08,313
You know what?
I have an idea.

1540
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:15,237
No, just get it.
I'll only be one second.

1541
01:18:21,577 --> 01:18:22,953
Hello?

1542
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:25,789
Hello.

1543
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:30,502
Well, this is Silly.

1544
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:31,670
Mm-hmm.

1545
01:18:37,342 --> 01:18:38,969
You feel so good.

1546
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:46,727
I've been wanting to do this since
the first time I heard your voice.

1547
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:50,105
I've wanted this, too.

1548
01:18:54,318 --> 01:18:57,029
Yeah, after I saved
that case in Italy they thought,

1549
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:00,490
"Okay, this is a guy we've
got to make something of."

1550
01:19:02,326 --> 01:19:05,454
Look, Lauren, there is a reason
that I asked to see you today.

1551
01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:08,165
And that's because I realized
that I made a mistake.

1552
01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:10,792
I should have
never left you.

1553
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:13,170
You're my person.

1554
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:15,631
I am?

1555
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:17,424
I'm gonna
shoot you straight.

1556
01:19:17,508 --> 01:19:18,842
When I was in Italy,

1557
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:22,971
I had a brief yet intense
relationship with a Sicilian woman.

1558
01:19:23,472 --> 01:19:25,933
Okay? And at first,
it was exhilarating.

1559
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:28,268
The passion was immense.

1560
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:31,396
But then the fighting
would start, Laur, and...

1561
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:35,234
And slaps across my face, screaming,
and doors slamming, and...

1562
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:37,027
It was exhausting.

1563
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:41,532
And I started to think about
you and what I love about you.

1564
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:46,036
And you're so simple.

1565
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,288
You know?

1566
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,083
Lauren, I want you
back in my life.

1567
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:53,710
Back in my apartment.
I got a place on the Upper East Side.

1568
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:54,837
Come home with me.

1569
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:59,258
Babe, bring the NuvaRing.
You know? Iwanna feel it.

1570
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,471
You're an asshole.

1571
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:06,181
I'm leaving.

1572
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:09,101
Wait, no.
Okay, I'm not an asshole.

1573
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:11,311
Yes, Lauren,
I was an asshole.

1574
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:14,022
But now it's out of my system
and I want you back.

1575
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:18,443
You know, you've been
calling me for months.

1576
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:21,989
I made a lot of calls
this summer, Charlie.

1577
01:20:22,072 --> 01:20:26,076
Turns out you were right.
We were boring. And you still are.

1578
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:29,288
You're not my person.

1579
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:31,373
You were never my person.

1580
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:40,716
I think I just came.

1581
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:51,018
I love Lauren.

1582
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:56,273
But I'm inside of you.

1583
01:20:57,274 --> 01:20:58,692
I know.

1584
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:01,862
I think I might
love you, too.

1585
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:06,783
But she would be so
proud of me right now.

1586
01:21:07,451 --> 01:21:10,370
And I just wanna tell her,
but I can't tell her.

1587
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:13,624
Because I hate her
and she hates me, so.

1588
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,127
I think
I love you, too.

1589
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:23,800
Now call her.

1590
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:28,263
Do it.

1591
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:39,608
Hey, it's Lauren.
Sorry I missed your call.

1592
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:40,817
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back-

1593
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:42,110
What the fuck?

1594
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:45,030
Hi, it's Katie.
Leave a message.

1595
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:46,615
Really?

1596
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:49,243
Fuck! See?

1597
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:01,088
It's me.
Please don't hang up.

1598
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,714
I love you.

1599
01:22:02,798 --> 01:22:04,424
I love you!

1600
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:06,593
And I'm out of breath because
you've been running through my mind

1601
01:22:06,677 --> 01:22:08,220
all day and I'm coming!

1602
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:10,097
I'm coming!
I'm coming! I'm coming!

1603
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,765
You're coming to me?

1604
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:13,392
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1605
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:15,394
Are you close?
I'm so close.

1606
01:22:15,477 --> 01:22:17,437
I'm down the street.
I wanna be with you.

1607
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:18,897
Please let me come inside.

1608
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:21,650
I want you to come inside.

1609
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:24,152
I want you!
I want you so hard!

1610
01:22:25,529 --> 01:22:28,949
Come to me! Come to me!
I love you back!

1611
01:22:29,032 --> 01:22:30,033
I love you, too!

1612
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:31,118
I think I love you.

1613
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:32,786
I know
I love you, but...

1614
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:34,913
Okay, I can't
stop saying it!

1615
01:22:34,997 --> 01:22:37,624
I'm close!
I'm so close!

1616
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:40,752
Here I come!
Oh, this feels so good!

1617
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:42,087
I know! I know!

1618
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:43,630
I love you.
I love you. I love you.

1619
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:45,757
Now I can't
stop saying it!

1620
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,261
Where are you?

1621
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:50,345
I'm here!

1622
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:54,892
I missed you!

1623
01:22:54,975 --> 01:22:55,976
I missed you.

1624
01:22:56,059 --> 01:22:57,728
You're so sweaty!

1625
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,898
I just ran 11 blocks
in heels!

1626
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:05,194
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1627
01:23:05,277 --> 01:23:06,820
You know I love you.

1628
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:09,948
I don't know why I didn't say it
that morning and I should have.

1629
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:12,367
No. I was wrong to take the
job without talking to you.

1630
01:23:12,451 --> 01:23:15,662
Of course you took the job.
What are you gonna do, not take it?

1631
01:23:15,746 --> 01:23:18,874
Who am I to stand in the way
of your dream job?

1632
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:22,753
Can I come home?

1633
01:23:23,504 --> 01:23:24,588
Obvs.

1634
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:26,798
But what are you wearing?

1635
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:29,134
What are you, like the
Programer Park flasher now?

1636
01:23:29,218 --> 01:23:30,886
Charlie called me
and I went to see him

1637
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:32,679
and I thought that
I would wear this

1638
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:35,182
because I thought
that maybe he would like it.

1639
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:37,976
Oh, my God!

1640
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:39,102
Who wears this?

1641
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:41,021
All right.

1642
01:23:41,104 --> 01:23:44,566
Let's get you inside and
put on something sensible.

1643
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:47,069
Oh, my God!
Speaking of letting people inside...

1644
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:50,697
I let Sean inside, my vagina!
We just had sex!

1645
01:23:50,781 --> 01:23:52,324
Oh, my God!

1646
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:57,663
I mean, "ow" at first,
but then out of this world.

1647
01:23:57,746 --> 01:23:58,956
I have to hear
all the details.

1648
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,207
Oh, I have details.

1649
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:03,210
Like, who knew their stuff runs
right out as soon as they're done?

1650
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:05,045
And it's so warm.

1651
01:24:06,004 --> 01:24:09,132
I got some running
down my leg right now!
