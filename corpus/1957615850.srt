 piano, wrote silly love songs

00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:14,941
and sang me fast asleep.

4
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:18,903
You drove me to New York, 
 healed my first heartache.

And I remember how every 
 night and every day

 always say that I'm your moon

You told me stories, 
 took me to movies

13
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:54,181
and held my hand so sweet.

14
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:58,477
We dressed in our snowsuits, 
 made pretty angels.

15
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:02,480
And I remember lying on 
 our backs, taking a rest,

00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:06,191
making a guess, trying our best
 to count the moon and stars.

 that's an honor.

 local girls at rush.

 part to ensure that only

 on a hornet's nest

Yep.

 have taken matters
