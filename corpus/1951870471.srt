1
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,572
Always in my dream,

2
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,407
l'm clinging to a branch,

3
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,618
Knowing full well that
death inevitably awaits me.

4
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:27,421
The fear of dying without ever having
Known love was greater than the fear

5
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,425
of death itself l Know now l was not alone
in the horror of this darKness.

6
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,763
So, too, was the fear
of Anna Karenina.

7
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:14,051
lt was then that a drop of honey
sweet enough to divert my eyes

8
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,303
from the cruel truth
came into my llfe.

9
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,555
She was the princess

10
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,558
EKaterina ScherbatsKy.

11
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,483
Thank you, Constantine Dmitrich.

12
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,901
l didn´t know that
you were in Moscow.

13
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,487
l arrived yesterday.

14
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,905
l mean, today.

15
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,741
l was going
to come to see you.

16
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,577
l didn´t know
you could skate so well.

17
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,579
l´m awful.

18
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,498
But the rumor is that

19
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,500
you are a superlative skater.

20
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,587
Oh, years ago. lt used to be
my passion.

21
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,923
Skate with me.

22
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,389
Must be dull in the country
in the winter.

23
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,391
Not at all. l´m very busy.

24
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,435
Mama said that you live
like a barbarian out there

25
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,397
and wear peasant clothes.

26
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,606
There´s a lot more to it
than you think.

27
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,859
lt´s very scientific.

28
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,237
Are you here for long?

29
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,866
l don´t know.
That depends on you.

30
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,457
Mama´s waiting for me.

31
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,379
-May l call on you?
-We´re at home on Thursday as usual.

32
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,423
Today, then.

33
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,425
Au revoir!

34
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,554
You said you wanted my advice
on a delicate matter?

35
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,600
Yes, Stiva.

36
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,438
l think l´m in love...

37
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,818
but l´m plain and too old.

38
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,072
She may be able to love me as a friend,
but l would´ve to be handsome

39
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,575
and more remarkable to make
her love me as a husband.

40
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,410
Who is the lucky girl?

41
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,536
Can´t you guess?

42
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,413
l´d be your brother-in-law.

43
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,873
Kitty.

44
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,583
Do you think there´s
any possibility?

45
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,418
Oh, why shouldn´t
there be?

46
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,713
For God´s sake, be absolutely
frank with me.

47
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,299
l´ll tell you something.

48
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,593
My wife Dolly is a most
wonderful woman.

49
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,596
-She can see through people.
-What do you mean?

50
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,806
Well, l mean, not only that
she likes you,

51
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,809
but she says Kitty is certain
to be your wife.

52
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,312
They are sisters,
after all.

53
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,439
She... she said that?

54
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,656
Constantine Dmitrich Levin.

55
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,782
Oh, God.

56
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,575
He´s come early.

57
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,747
l don´t think l´ve come
at the right time.

58
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,792
-l´m too early.
-Oh, no.

59
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,799
This is what l wanted...

60
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,343
to find you alone.

61
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:03,679
The guests should be
here in a moment.

62
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,598
l told you that l didn´t know
whether l would be here long...

63
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,687
that it depended on you.

64
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,402
l meant...

65
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,865
l meant do say...

66
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,705
be my wife.

67
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,624
l cannot be.

68
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,795
Forgive me.

69
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,552
lt was not meant to be.

70
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,893
Why, Constantine Dmitrich.

71
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,437
Do stay. Have some tea.

72
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,440
Ah, Constantine Dmitrich.

73
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,484
Back in our corrupt Babylon.

74
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,821
Well, is Babylon reformed,
or have you been corrupted?

75
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,575
That you remembered my words so well.
They must have made an impression on you.

76
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,577
Of course. l note down
everything you say.

77
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,750
What´s the matter with Levin today?Why
doesn´t he launch into one of his tirades?

78
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,585
Please.

79
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,754
Constantine Dmitrich.

80
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:22,591
How´s it that at home in our village of
Kaluga, the peasants have spent their all

81
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,760
on drink and now pay us nothing?

82
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,262
What is the meaning of that?

83
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,389
You´re always so full of praise
for peasants.

84
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,393
Do let me introduce you.

85
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,563
Constantine Dmitrich Levin,

86
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,399
Count Alexei Kirillovich
VronsKy.

87
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,612
Constantine Dmitrich despises
and hates town and us townspeople.

88
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,573
Do you live in the country
all year round?

89
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,450
l should think it must be
rather dull in winter.

90
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,410
Not at all if one has work
to do. Besides, you can´t...

91
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,456
-be dull in your own company.
-l like the country.

92
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,708
l'd be bored to tears.

93
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,628
One simply can't live without
sophisticated conversation.

94
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,256
Countess Nordston was telling me

95
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,759
about a demonstration of table
rapping and spiritualism she attended.

96
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,512
Oh, that would be fascinating.

97
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,389
l´ve never seen anything
supernatural.

98
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,766
Do you believe in spirits,
Constantine Dmitrich?

99
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,602
Why´d you ask me that? You know
perfectly well what my answer will be.

100
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,354
But l want to hear you opinion.

101
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,524
My opinion´s that table rapping
merely proves

102
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,609
that the so-called educated classes
are no better than the peasants.

103
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,778
They, too, believe in the evil eyes
and spirits.

104
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,281
But l´ve witnessed it myself.

105
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,408
But don´t you think
there´s something in it?

106
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,454
lf we admit to the existence
of electricity

107
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,790
of which we know nothing,

108
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,544
Why shouldn´t there exist
some newforces yet unknown to us?

109
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,796
Because with electricity when
you rub wool and resin together,

110
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,466
you invariably produce a
recognizable phenomenon.

111
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,468
But with this hocus-pocus...

112
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,472
Suppose we try now.

113
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,725
Do let us try,
Princess Kitty.

114
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:17,748
Ah, Stiva.

115
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,334
Who are you meeting?

116
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,543
My mother.

117
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,755
-You were missed last night.
-Where?

118
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,716
The Chateau des Fleurs,
of course.

119
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,428
My God, there was this wonderful
little girl doing the cancan.

120
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:36,600
l went home. l felt in such an agreeable
frame of mind when l left the Scherbatskys´,

121
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,394
l didn´t want to go
anywhere else.

122
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,688
´´By the mark of your steed, l can
tell your fine breed

123
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,608
and a young man
in love by his eyes.´´

124
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,779
-And who are you meeting?
-l´ve come to meet a pretty woman.

125
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,365
-Oh, indeed.
-Shame on you.

126
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,200
My sister Anna.

127
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,452
Karenin´s wife?

128
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,371
Yes, well, you must know her.

129
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:01,375
l don´t think so. l know Karenin
by sight and by repute.

130
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,378
You´ve a very illustrious brother-in-law.
Very high up in the Ministry.

131
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,713
Yes, a remarkable man.

132
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,715
But not our kind.

133
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,343
Like your friend Levin. l met him last
night, an insufferable fellow.

134
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,680
Oh, you don´t appreciate my Levin.

135
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,391
But yesterday there was a reason
for him being out of sorts.

136
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,351
You don´t mean he, uh...

137
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,272
Levin has been in love with
Kitty for so long,

138
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,774
and l feel so very sorry
for him.

139
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,278
So that´s it.

140
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,426
Excuse me.

141
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,440
You got my telegram?

142
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,900
How are you?Well?

143
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,444
-Have a good journey, mama?
-Anna Arkadyevna!

144
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,822
Can´t youfind your brother?

145
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,824
Stiva, here!

146
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,327
She´s very charming, isn´t she?

147
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,455
Poor girl. Her husband refuses
to travel with her. He says he´s too busy.

148
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,625
Well, Countess, you´ve met
your son, l´ve met my brother.

149
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,920
Pardon me for not recognizing you,
but l don´t think we´ve ever met before.

150
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:30,464
Anna Arkadyevna

151
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,758
has a little boy of 8, Seriozha.

152
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,469
They´ve never been
parted before, and she´s fretting

153
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,430
at having left him behind. Really,
Anna, you can´t expect never to leave him.

154
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,476
Well, good-bye, countess.

155
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,811
Good-bye, my dear.

156
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,488
Very charming.

157
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,371
Horrible.

158
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,549
He´s dead.

159
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,434
lt is a bad omen.

160
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,436
Nonsense. You´ve come.

161
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,439
That is the chief thing.

162
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,483
You cannot imagine how much
l´m counting on you.

163
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,570
Stiva, l know you´re to blame.
Don´t deny it.

164
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,446
9 years... my children...

165
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,825
all to be thrown away
because of a...

166
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,827
momentary lapse.

167
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,580
True. lt was not nice

168
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,915
that she was the
children´s governess.

169
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,835
What can l do?

170
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,505
Drop me at your house and
go bacK to the court.

171
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,424
ls this Grisha?

172
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,509
How he´s grown!

173
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,888
How happy and well
you look.

174
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,437
He told me.

175
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,439
He met me at
the station.

176
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,905
Grisha, go and find Tanya.

177
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,290
of course she´s young,

178
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,292
and she´s pretty.

179
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,461
My youth and looks are gone,

180
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,379
taken by him and
his children.

181
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,798
l hate him.

182
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,426
l don´t want to speak up
for him,

183
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,763
but what is the best thing to do
in this dreadful situation, Dolly?

184
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,932
Stiva is ashamed.

185
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,435
But he made love to her.

186
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,438
l don´t excuse him, but...

187
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,483
that´s how it is.

188
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,451
Anna's mission to heal the rift
in her brother's family

189
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:08,455
was not unliKe my own desire
to restore the ties with my brother,

190
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,792
so desperate were we both
to feel love.

191
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,339
Good evening.

192
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:24,471
Excuse me. ls Nikolai Levin here?

193
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,641
There is a gentleman here,
Nikolai Dmitrich.

194
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,894
Nikolai.

195
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,816
Kostya.

196
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,444
What is it?
What do you want?

197
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,780
l don´t want anything.

198
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,323
l came to see you.

199
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,658
You´re my brother.

200
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,828
This woman is my life´s
companion.

201
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,414
Maria Nikolayevna.

202
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,918
l took her out of a brothel.

203
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,675
But anyone who wants
to know me must respect her, too.

204
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,727
All right, then, Masha,

205
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,354
supper for 3, then.

206
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,690
with vodka and wine.

207
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,403
Your brother drinks too much.

208
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,530
Take no notice of her.
She´s a whore.

209
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,700
You are a gentleman.

210
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,785
Nikolai, don´t drink.

211
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,414
Leave me a...
Leave me alone.

212
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:33,790
l´ll beat you.

213
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,630
How about supper, then?

214
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:44,551
Have a drink.

215
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,387
Tell me how you do it.

216
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,684
Why aren´t you married yet?

217
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,769
Oh, no luck.

218
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,397
l think there must be something
about me that repels people.

219
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,860
Why?

220
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,738
For me, everything´s over.

221
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,365
For you...

222
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,205
Come back with me...

223
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,790
to the country.

224
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,583
For the sake of your health.

225
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,128
No. Too much to do.
l´ve become a communist.

226
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,130
Nikolai, the police.

227
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:25,717
They´ll persecute me like they do
anyone who´s not a scoundrel.

228
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:30,556
Here.

229
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,902
You want to fell
magnanimous...

230
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:46,738
feel righteous.

231
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,742
l´ll let you have that
satisfaction.

232
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,591
Don´ t think too badly
of me, Kostya.

233
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,599
Mama, please.

234
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,518
Princess Kitty, may l ask you
for the quadrille?

235
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,437
l´m sorry, but l´m promised
to count Vronsky,

236
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,106
but you may have
the second quadrille.

237
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,609
An honor, princess.

238
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,560
The master of ceremonies
can never be refused.

239
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,856
lt was nice of you
to come in good time.

240
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,567
Such a bad habit to be late.

241
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,153
-Where may l take you?
-Madame Karenina´s over there, l think.

242
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,780
Will you take me to her, please?

243
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,576
Pardon, mesdames,
monsieurs, pardon.

244
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,498
You even dance into the room.

245
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,584
Princess Kitty´s one of my
most faithful helpers.

246
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,753
She adorns the ballroom and
makes the ball gay.

247
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,676
-May l have the pleasure?
-No. l never dance if l can help it.

248
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,511
Oh, but you must tonight.

249
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,767
Well, but if it´s impossible
not to dance, let us dance, then.

250
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,885
Well?

251
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:01,683
Nothing.

252
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,289
Princess, you are such
a delight.

253
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,624
ls your card free
for the mazurka?

254
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,303
l should withdraw.

255
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,555
This is turning out
absurdly.

256
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:26,435
Will you stay to supper? l have a
wonderful cotillion in mind.

257
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,478
No, l won´t stay. l´ve danced
more at this ball

258
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,480
than l have in a whole winter
in Petersburg.

259
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:37,446
These few brief moments
intoxicated Anna

260
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,448
liKe a light pouring into
the darK room that was her llfe.

261
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,765
We´ve stopped, mistress.

262
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,601
l want a breath of air.

263
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,300
What are you
doing here?

264
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,469
You know that l have come
to be where you are.

265
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,431
l cannot help myself.

266
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,812
Forgive me if what
l say offends you.

267
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,402
You shouldn´t say that.

268
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:46,658
And l beg you, if you´re a gentleman,
to forget this as l willforget it.

269
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,410
Not one word...

270
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,747
not one gesture of yours...

271
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:53,499
Shall l...

272
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,418
could l ever forget.

273
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,755
Stop it.

274
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:48,428
Yes, as you see, here is
your devoted husband

275
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,639
burning with impatience
to see you.

276
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,809
ls Seriozha all right?

277
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,603
ls that all the reward
l get for my ardor?

278
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,480
Yes, he´s quite all right.

279
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,281
Did you have
a good night?

280
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:09,616
Excellent. Thank you.

281
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,412
Ah, we´ve met before, l believe.
Count Vronsky.

282
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:17,291
You set off with the mother and return
with the son. Back from furlough, l presume.

283
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:18,709
So, my dear, how was Moscow?

284
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,377
l hope l may have the honor
of calling on you.

285
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,298
Delighted. We´re at home
on Mondays.

286
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,570
l told you it was mama!
l knew!

287
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,448
Oh, my pet.

288
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:54,661
Gifts from Tanya
and Grisha.

289
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,665
Tanya can read now, you know?
She´s even teaching Grisha.

290
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,584
ls she nicer than me?

291
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,755
To me you´re nicer than anyone
else in the world.

292
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,381
l know l am.

293
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:17,518
On the whole, then, your
visit was a success?

294
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:22,523
l cannot see how a man
like that can be exonerated,

295
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,525
even if he is your brother.

296
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:29,279
But l´m glad it all ended satisfactorily
and that you´re back again.

297
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:32,533
You wouldn´t believe how
irksome it is to dine alone.

298
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,285
l missed you, too.

299
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,287
Time for bed.

300
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:11,363
Betsy,

301
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,534
-l´m beginning to lose hope.
-Whatever hope could you have?

302
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,786
None.

303
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,874
Excuse me. l´m afraid
l´ve become ridiculous.

304
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:25,419
Oh, my dear, you're in
no danger of that.

305
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:28,255
A man pursuing a young girl
might be ridiculous,

306
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,382
but a man in love
with a married woman,

307
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,427
that has something fine
and grand about it.

308
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,430
lt could never be ridiculous.
Next you'll be telling me

309
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,557
that young girls should be
virtuous, women chaste,

310
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:41,560
men virile, and children should be
brought up

311
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,730
to pay their debts and earn their
bread and all the other nonsense.

312
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:46,732
But look at them...

313
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:48,775
Karenin,

314
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:51,904
that awful Lydia lvanovna.

315
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,573
So old-fashioned,

316
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,909
so stuffy.
They surround her.

317
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:00,537
When l am old and ugly,

318
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:02,372
l´ll become like them.

319
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:05,334
For a beautiful woman
like Anna, it is too soon

320
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,587
for her spirit to be crushed
by such boredom.

321
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,258
We must rescue her

322
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:16,094
before it is too late.

323
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,770
Come to my house
on Saturday.

324
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,618
ls it true that the younger Vlassiev
girl is going to marry Topov?

325
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,870
Yes, they say it´s
quite settled.

326
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:45,541
l am surprised at her parents.
l heard it was a love match.

327
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,544
A love match?What antediluvian
ideas you have.

328
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,547
Who talks of love nowadays?

329
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,298
That foolish old custom´s
not left us yet.

330
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:56,885
The only happy marriages are
marriages of convenience

331
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:00,514
where both parties have sown
their wild oats.

332
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,350
ln my young days, l was
in love with a deacon.

333
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,562
l didn´t know that
it did me any good.

334
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,522
No, but joking apart.
l believe that

335
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,357
before one can know
what love really is,

336
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:12,568
one must have a fall
and pick oneself up again.

337
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,862
Even after marriage?

338
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,531
lt´s never too late.

339
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:30,377
l´ve been wanting to tell you that you
behaved badly, very badly, indeed.

340
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,547
You think l don´t know
that l behaved badly?

341
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,384
But who made me?

342
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,386
How can you say that?

343
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:41,430
You know why.

344
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,433
That only shows
you have no heart.

345
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:52,774
l came here tonight knowing
that l would meet you

346
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,569
to make it perfectly clear
this must stop.

347
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,905
You make me feel as if
l was guilty of something.

348
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:00,282
What do you
want me to do?

349
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,242
l want you to go
to Moscow and...

350
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,036
You don´t want that.

351
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,416
Then do this for me.

352
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,376
Never utter
those words again.

353
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,087
And let us
be good friends.

354
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:38,028
Friends
we shall never be.

355
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:39,738
You know that.

356
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,867
There is only one way
we can be happy.

357
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,630
l have nothing left
but you. Remember that.

358
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:51,930
Nothing matters anymore...

359
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:55,642
Not even life...

360
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,770
for one moment
of happiness like this.

361
00:32:58,937 --> 00:32:59,855
Happiness?

362
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,482
Don´t ever
speak of it again.

363
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,438
l have to warn you.

364
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,316
Warn me?
What about?

365
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,403
That by thoughtlessness and
indiscretion, you may cause yourself

366
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,906
to be talked about
in society.

367
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:53,659
You´re beginning
to attract attention.

368
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:56,161
l´m sure
they´re only rumors.

369
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:02,042
You are always like that.

370
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,962
You don´t like me to be dull,
and then you don´t like it

371
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,964
when l go out
and enjoy myself.

372
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:10,384
Stop it. You Know
l can´t stand it.

373
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,595
And l would like to know
what all this is about.

374
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:15,764
Your feelings are the affair
of your own conscience,

375
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:18,767
but l am duty-bound to point out
to you your duties.

376
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:22,396
Our lives have been joined
not by man but by God.

377
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:25,399
Only a crime
can sever that union.

378
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:28,402
A crime of that nature brings
its own heavy punishment.

379
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,988
l don´t understand
a thing you are saying.

380
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:34,241
And besides,
l´m desperately sleepy.

381
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:38,245
Anna, for God´s sake, don´t
speak like that. Perhaps l am mistaken.

382
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:42,499
But believe me, what l say
l say as much for my sake as for yours.

383
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:44,501
l am your husband,
and l love you, but if

384
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:45,961
-there are the slightest grounds...
-l have nothing to say.

385
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,174
lt is really bedtime.

386
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,313
Here it is.

387
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:49,399
Stupid miss
with the right barrel.

388
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,075
Stiva?

389
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,788
When´s Kitty
getting married?

390
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,332
She isn´t thinking
about marriage.

391
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,459
She´s very ill.

392
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,170
The doctors
have sent her abroad.

393
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:20,848
Where´s Vronsky now?

394
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,394
He´s in Petersburg.

395
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:29,398
He left shortly after you did. And
he´s not been in Moscow once since then.

396
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,277
Do you know, Kostya,

397
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:36,697
l´ll be frank with you.
lt was your own fault.

398
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:41,827
You took fright at the sight of your rival.
Why didn´t youfight it out?

399
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,079
Kitty was never
serious about him.

400
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,707
She was just attracted
by his good looks.

401
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,085
l tell you candidly

402
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:52,838
that when she returns
from her cure,

403
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,633
she´ll be going to Yergushovo
for some quiet country life.

404
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,345
And that´s not too far
from here, Kostya, is it?

405
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:11,773
l don´t know
if you know,

406
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,817
but l don´t care.
l´ll tell you.

407
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,569
l did make an offer...

408
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,781
but l was rejected.

409
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:26,371
Now Kitty´s nothing more than a
painful, humiliating memory. lt´s over.

410
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,459
l was hanging down
that darK well,

411
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,544
but the one thing
l held onto

412
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,379
was worK.

413
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,800
l clutched it and clung to it
with all my might.

414
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:41,845
once l lost my temper
with a bailiff

415
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:45,849
and in a fit of anger tooK a scythe
and began mowing.

416
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:47,476
lt calmed me,

417
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,814
So l resolved
to mow with them... all day long.

418
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,449
As l mowed,

419
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,326
l lost all count of time.

420
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:08,330
l had no idea whether
it was late or early.

421
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:13,252
A change came about my worK,
which gave me intense satisfaction.

422
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:17,464
When l forgot what l was doing
and mowed without effort,

423
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,593
My line was almost
as smooth and good as Titus'.

424
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,390
More and more often now
came those moments of oblivion.

425
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:30,686
When it was not my arms
which swung the scythe,

426
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:34,523
the scythe seemed to mow
by itself.

427
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:38,485
Some externalforce
seemed to propel me on,

428
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:41,822
as though by magic...

429
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:46,702
the worK did itself
regularly and carefully.

430
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,832
These were the most
blessed moments.

431
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,494
lt was she.

432
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,455
lt was Kitty...

433
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,457
on her way to Yergushovo.

434
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,836
Quiet, sweet.

435
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:25,926
Loot at her face, mama.

436
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:31,890
So spirited and yet so gentle.
l feel she could almost speak.

437
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,475
A fine horse.

438
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:38,313
Everybody´s betting on you.
Not entirely for the right reasons.

439
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:39,898
What are you
implying, mama?

440
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,984
Don´t be coy with me.

441
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:46,446
You must know how you´ve
become the center of gossip.

442
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:51,952
An affair
in the highest society

443
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:55,664
puts a finishing touch to
a brilliant young man.

444
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:58,458
Lord knows
l shouldn´t preach, but there are those

445
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,462
who are becoming displeased with you,
Alexei. l want you to break it off.

446
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,090
l will not have anyone cast doubt
on the honor of my...

447
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:08,552
Her honor is nonexistent.
So is yours.

448
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:12,723
l´ve been told you´ve refused
a post in Moscow.

449
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,641
A promotion.

450
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:17,728
Mother, l would ask you
respectfully not to pry.

451
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:20,647
You only get one chance
at a career.

452
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:24,860
Why throw it all away
on some passion?

453
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:28,572
A brilliant, worldly liaison
l would approve of,

454
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:31,742
but not this desperate...

455
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,869
Oh, if my love were some ordinary,

456
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:36,163
vulgar society intrigue,

457
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:38,457
you would leave me alone.

458
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:42,461
You have not the remotest
idea what l feel.

459
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:46,840
l find the lying, the deceit,
the scheming intolerable.

460
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,842
Then give her up.

461
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,841
l wasn´t expecting you.

462
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:32,594
Gracious, what cold hands.

463
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:33,887
You startled me.

464
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:37,558
l´m waiting for Seriozha. l...he went out
for a walk. They´ll come back this way.

465
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,311
Forgive me. l couldn´t go the day
without seeing you.

466
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:44,898
But shouldn´t you be
preparing for the race?

467
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:47,901
What were you
thinking of?

468
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:51,655
Please tell me.

469
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:58,620
Anna, what´s the matter?
l can see that something´s wrong.

470
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:01,415
l´m going to have your baby.

471
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,796
Tell him everything
and leave him.

472
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,215
-Oh, my son.
-You must be free of him!

473
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,301
Free to become
your mistress?

474
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:14,803
When can
l see you?When?

475
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,724
Tonight. 1:00.

476
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:37,826
Well, l must be
at the races.

477
00:43:38,744 --> 00:43:40,579
Do you like horse racing?

478
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:48,754
Good-bye.

479
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:52,591
Seriozha, there is
no need to be so rude.

480
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:55,427
Papa told me always
to be truthful.

481
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:12,277
Save your strength
for the finish.

482
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:13,821
Fine.

483
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:18,617
Watch out for the water jump.

484
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:27,876
Are you riding today?

485
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,301
Here we are!

486
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:40,556
There is so much splendors here.
one´s eyes are dazzled.

487
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:42,307
l will be staying the night.

488
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:45,727
l am sure you are glad
we can be together.

489
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:30,457
We can go
if you like.

490
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,446
l again
offer you my arm

491
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:03,323
if you want
to be going.

492
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,462
l´m obliged to tell you
that your behavior...

493
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:18,797
What about my behavior?

494
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:20,507
Be careful.

495
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:27,514
The despair you were unable to hide
when one of the riders fell.

496
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:36,607
Possibly l am mistaken.

497
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:38,775
in that case,
l beg your pardon.

498
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:42,362
l listen to you,
but l´m thinking of him.

499
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:46,366
l love him
and l´m his mistress.

500
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:49,286
l can´t endure you,

501
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:52,498
and l´m desperately unhappy.

502
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:59,713
You can do
what you like with me.

503
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:20,692
ls everything all right ma´am?

504
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,694
What time is it?

505
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,364
Almost midnight ma´am.

506
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:36,458
l've told my husband everything. l must
see you. Come at once to the house.

507
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:39,586
Count Vronsky!

508
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,882
Ah, General Serpuhovsky!

509
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:46,260
Brooding on your misfortune?
lt won´t do at all.

510
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:47,845
Come on. Let´s go and
have something to drink.

511
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:51,557
l heard news of your promotion. l was
delighted and not a bit surprised.

512
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:55,561
l heard you refused an important
post. Men like you are wanted.

513
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:58,438
-By whom?
-By Russia.

514
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,400
Russia needs men.

515
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:04,486
-The communists are gathering force.
-There´re no such things as communists.

516
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:08,323
Scheming people always have to invent
some dangerous, noxious party.

517
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,242
-lt´s an old trick.
-Oh, well, l won´t fight you.

518
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:13,579
Shall we go outside? l heard Therese
is going to perform as lady Eve.

519
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:16,832
l like to see that kind of show
with a gypsy girl on my knee.

520
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:21,461
-l´m afraid l´ve an assignation.
-Assignation? No, you don´t Vronsky, old boy.

521
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:24,464
Karenin arrived this afternoon.
Saw him at the races.

522
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,508
l wouldn´t keep
that appointment.

523
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:18,560
l took the liberty of ordering you
some brandy and cucumbers.

524
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,443
Drink the brandy.

525
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,829
Oh, and, this came for you.

526
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:44,920
Bad news?

527
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:47,756
She´s told him
everything.

528
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,468
l must go to her.

529
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:06,483
What do you want?!

530
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:09,778
Sit down! l have something
to say to you.

531
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,281
l know l... l´ve done wrong
and l´m...

532
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:15,576
Whatever your conduct may have been,
l don´t consider myself justified

533
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:18,579
in severing the ties through which a
higher power has bound us.

534
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:20,289
l shall ignore it

535
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:25,627
as long as the world knows nothing of it,
as long as my name is not disgraced.

536
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,421
And therefore l simply
warn you that our relations

537
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,424
must remain as they´ve always been.

538
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:33,302
-l can´t be your wife while l...
-So you see nothing wrong with

539
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:35,762
your infidelity yet refuse to perform
the same duties for your husband!

540
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,598
What do you want
from me?

541
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,518
l want you to never
see him again!

542
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:45,522
l want you to be
a dutiful wife!

543
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:48,817
l can´t change
what has happened.

544
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,456
Well, understand this.

545
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:05,459
l´ll go to Moscow. l will not return
to this house again.

546
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,794
l´ll divorce you
on the grounds of adultery.

547
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:10,422
My son will go
to my sister´s.

548
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:14,885
No. You must leave me Seriozha.
You don´t love him.

549
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:18,639
l´ve even lost
affection for my son

550
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:21,558
because he is associated
with my loathing for you!

551
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,728
But all the same,
l shall take him.

552
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,481
You are a whore.
You have no legal rights.

553
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:29,733
Alexei Alexandrovitch,
leave me Seriozha.

554
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,486
You know l can´t live
without him.

555
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,413
lf you´ll conduct yourself
so that neither society

556
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,458
nor the servants can find
anything to say against you,

557
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:49,545
you can enjoy all the privileges
of a respectable wife

558
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:52,506
without fulfilling
the duties of one.

559
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:56,593
and you may
keep your son.
