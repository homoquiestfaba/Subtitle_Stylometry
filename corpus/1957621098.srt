GUINEVERE: My mother died 
 when I was five years old.

13
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,386
Such things as the passing of 
 the queen meant little then,

And so, like all 
 the other local kings,

 by constant wars.

Unable to raise me himself,

Yes, my lady, he has.

Did he...

1251
01:26:50,506 --> 01:26:52,641
give you any message for me?

1252
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:55,978
No, my lady, he said nothing.

1253
01:26:56,979 --> 01:26:58,447
But he...

1254
01:26:58,481 --> 01:27:00,349
just sent you this.

would have come to see this.

He is gone, Arthur.

Both of them are gone.
