1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:03,439
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:19,873
(frogs croaking)

3
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:26,029
(gentle music)

4
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,870
(object clatters)

5
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,453
(gentle music)

6
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:41,480
- I can't believe we're doing this.

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,853
- It's not my fault.

8
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,590
All right guys, where is she?

9
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,533
- [Woman] Arlo?

10
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:50,593
- Just a second, Mom.

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,713
- Arlo?

12
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,610
Oh, Jim!

13
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,730
We haven't seen you in months.

14
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,920
Why don't you stay for dinner?

15
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,360
- Well, I'd love to Mrs. Anderson, but I--

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,130
- He has a date.

17
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,430
- A date!

18
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,590
Jim, that's wonderful.

19
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,670
You boys are getting to be that age.

20
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,240
- Mom, matchsticks won't
stop you from crying.

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,532
It has no basis in science.

22
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:22,728
- Well, it works for me.

23
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:25,395
(playful music)

24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,242
I read it in a book.

25
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:31,075
- Uh...

26
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:35,230
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,034
- Uh, we'll set the table, Mom.

28
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:38,951
- Nonsense.

29
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:46,220
Gertrude!

30
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,120
Come out of there.

31
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:51,220
Oh, poor thing.

32
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,230
Arlo, I believe I'm a
fairly tolerant human being.

33
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,150
We all have our own special
place in this world.

34
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,830
But I do not allow iguanas in my kitchen.

35
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,180
Even Gertrude. Here you go.

36
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,123
- Yes, Mom.

37
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,949
(gentle music)

38
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,330
Gertrude, you've got to restrain yourself.

39
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,730
Do we understand each other?

40
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,521
Hey, Trico, slow down.

41
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:30,810
- For the last time, Arlo,

42
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,643
if I knew we were gonna be

43
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:34,710
messing with your
reptiles again... (sighs)

44
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,620
Snakes, lizards, frogs.

45
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,580
It isn't the same anymore, Arlo.

46
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,500
- Remember when we had 20 guys down here?

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,050
They couldn't believe all our snakes.

48
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,990
- We were in the fourth grade, Arlo.

49
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,180
- So?

50
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,570
Kids still think it's cool.

51
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,790
- Well, maybe the Chess Club does,

52
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,820
but the rest of the school
thinks you're a Rubis.

53
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,000
- Well, these guys still like me.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,240
We have a lot in common.

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,073
Don't we, Henry?

56
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,850
- Look, Arlo, I'll put it to you straight.

57
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,193
You gotta stop talking to snakes
and start talking to girls.

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,000
- Well, I can talk to both, can't I?

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,810
- Arlo, any girl who talks
to a guy who talks to snakes

60
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,430
ain't worth talking to.

61
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,983
You never even kissed a girl.

62
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,860
- I have, too.

63
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,823
- [Jim] Name one.

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,290
- Uh...

65
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,123
Arlene.

66
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,590
- Your sister?

67
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,220
- It was her wedding.

68
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,583
- Uh, everybody in their cages?

69
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:30,970
(animals croaking and hissing)

70
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,510
- Coast is clear, Dad.

71
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,343
- Hey, Jimbo.

72
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,730
Long time, no see, buddy.

73
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,550
You and Arlo get into
a fight or something?

74
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,656
- No, busy.

75
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,730
(Henry hisses)

76
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,330
How'd the game go, Mr. Anderson?

77
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:45,302
(Mr. Anderson huffs)

78
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,200
Well, let's just say that

79
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,470
we're not as young as we used to be.

80
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,050
But I read about your big win over there

81
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,090
at Cleveland Junior High.

82
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,584
Newspaper said you just
flew over those hurdles.

83
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:55,840
- Well, yeah, except for the last one.

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,860
- Yeah, well you stick
with your athletics, Jimbo.

85
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,032
When I was your age, you know
what they used to call me?

86
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,560
- What?
- Lightning Legs Anderson.

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,820
Yeah, you play football, don't you, Jimbo?

88
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,040
Well, when I was a first
string running back,

89
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,120
we didn't wear no pads then
either, you understand?

90
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,612
It was man against man, okay?

91
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,740
And when you got in, whoa!

92
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,323
(gentle music)

93
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,720
- Uh, you want to come over Saturday?

94
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,083
- No, I think I got something planned.

95
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,470
- Oh.

96
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,860
Sure.

97
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,850
- Well, I'll be seeing you, Arlo.

98
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,683
- See ya.

99
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,533
Hey, wait.

100
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,503
Do you think...

101
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,600
You think maybe you could get me a date?

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,150
- Well, uh...

103
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,270
Let me see what I can do, Snake Eyes.

104
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,190
But you gotta promise me one thing.

105
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,300
- You name it.

106
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,793
- You won't act like a nerd.

107
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:55,286
(bright music)

108
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,420
Later, gator.

109
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,693
- In a while, crocodile.

110
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:03,428
(bright music)

111
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,198
- How do I look, guys?

112
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,517
Too much or not enough?

113
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:50,767
(bowling ball striking pins on TV)

114
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,180
- Strike-aroo!

115
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,430
(Mrs. Anderson laughs)

116
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,260
- Dad?

117
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,093
- [Mr. Anderson] Yeah?

118
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,403
- Could I get an advance for my allowance?

119
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:05,220
- Oh, they having the
science fair already, huh?

120
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,510
- No, it's not for another two weeks.

121
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,730
- What is it this time?

122
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,860
Mealworms for a gecko?

123
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,190
A frozen rat?

124
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,473
- It's for a date.

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,240
- Arlo, really?

126
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,550
A date?

127
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,350
- I'm meeting them in
front of the theater.

128
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,490
- Okay, wait, wait.

129
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,960
Here's a 20, it's enough for a movie

130
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,000
and a couple of malts later.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,326
- Whoa, thanks, Dad!

132
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:28,826
(dog barking in distance)

133
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,083
Wow, a two-for-one lizard sale!

134
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,903
Who's that?

135
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:47,425
(playful music)

136
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,277
(frog croaking)

137
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:59,928
Arlo, you don't need a
frog, you've got a date.

138
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:02,595
(playful music)

139
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:12,612
- Well!

140
00:08:12,612 --> 00:08:16,070
I thought the science fair
wasn't for another two weeks yet.

141
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,030
- What kind of frog are you?

142
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,540
- Just came in.

143
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,810
Box says it's from Italy.

144
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,693
- How much?

145
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,270
- Well, for my preferred customers, $20.

146
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,814
(playful music)

147
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:36,404
(register rattles)

148
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:39,237
(shop bell dings)

149
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:43,060
(Jim sighs)

150
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,669
- I'll pay you back tomorrow.

151
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:45,550
(Jim scoffs)

152
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,707
- Now, remember--

153
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:48,124
- I know, I know.

154
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,390
- Arlo, Suzy.

155
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,363
Suzy, Arlo.

156
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,190
- Suzy, did you know
some frogs use their eyes

157
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,009
to push down their food?

158
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,682
- Uh, no, I didn't.

159
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:02,515
- You didn't tell me you were setting up

160
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:04,310
my best friend with Arlo Anderson.

161
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,930
- I thought I did.

162
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,620
- Well, I only mention that because

163
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,580
we're both in Mr. Fried's science class.

164
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,770
- Oh, really?

165
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,972
- Yeah.

166
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,620
Arlo's the one who brought
in the foot-long worms.

167
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,290
- [Suzy] Oh, yeah.

168
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,800
- Arlo always gets A's.

169
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,420
You should see his science projects.

170
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,963
- Oh, I can't stand science.

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,880
But your talk really taught me some things

172
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,440
I never knew about worms.

173
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,080
- Well, actually I'd like
to become a herpetologist.

174
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,520
- Yuck!
- Yuck!

175
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,600
- That's a doctor, right, Arlo?

176
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,450
- Well, yeah.

177
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,660
It's like a doctor of
reptiles and amphibians.

178
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,470
They're extremely interesting creatures.

179
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,100
I mean, did you know that some frogs

180
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,930
raise tadpoles in their mouths?

181
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,763
- [Girls] Yuck!

182
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:45,509
(movie monster growling)

183
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:53,650
(frog croaks)

184
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,703
- Uh, the onions.

185
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:02,460
- Shh!

186
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,354
- [Movie Character] Don't
you think we should be

187
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,269
getting back to the lab?

188
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,936
(playful music)

189
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:19,627
- [Movie Character] Sure,
pull the other one, Bob.

190
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:20,460
- Arlo!

191
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,293
What?

192
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:22,220
- Sorry.

193
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,053
Sorry.

194
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,583
Uh, my shoe.

195
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,320
- Arlo, would you quit moving around?

196
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,959
- Sorry.

197
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,536
Sorry.

198
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:41,143
- [Movie Character] I don't see anything.

199
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:46,382
(suspenseful music)

200
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:52,721
(frog croaks)

201
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,193
- You okay?

202
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,850
- Never felt better.

203
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:09,786
(movie monster growling)

204
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:15,337
(Kathy screams)

205
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:16,796
(suspenseful music)

206
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:19,844
(movie character screams)

207
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:22,844
(suspenseful music)

208
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,610
- You know, Mom was right!

209
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,350
You are a dweeb!

210
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,230
Goodbye. Forever!

211
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,203
- Kathy!

212
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,880
- Sorry, Jim.

213
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,922
Sorry.

214
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:36,840
- (scoffs) Don't.

215
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,520
I've never heard anyone
apologize so much in one night!

216
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,353
- Sorry.

217
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,330
- Look, Arlo,

218
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,823
I gave you a chance.

219
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,780
You have this weird
attraction to reptiles.

220
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,640
You couldn't control
yourself and you had to bring

221
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,913
a frog on your first date!

222
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,433
I'm not mad.

223
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,283
We just don't have
anything in common anymore.

224
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:08,052
(gentle music)

225
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:24,503
(Andersons chattering quietly)

226
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:27,340
(door creaks open)

227
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,562
- Hey, it's 9:15.

228
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:30,873
Is that the best you could do?

229
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,489
Well, I didn't mean anything by it.

230
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:38,489
(door slams nearby)

231
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:45,715

00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:09,251
- Uh...

242
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,520
(Arlo thuds)

243
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,353
Arlo?

244
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,320
- Arlo, are you okay?

245
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,720
- Uh...

246
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,723
Uh, sure, Mom.

247
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,370
I was just reading.

248
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,857
- Oh.

249
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:30,347
- "Timber rattlesnakes are life bearers,

250
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:34,550
"giving birth in early fall to
a litter of nine youngsters."

251
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,640
- You look a little pale.

252
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,390
You want me to make you some nanny tea?

253
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,470
- No.

254
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,700
Um, just tired.

255
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,660
I hope.

256
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,380
- Well, don't worry, sweetie.

257
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,020
Not every day turns out
the way you planned.

258
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,620
When I think of some of my
dates with your father...

259
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,753
Oh, well you're tired.

260
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,430
But I just want you to know, Arlo,

261
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,613
you're a very special person.

262
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,433
- Thanks, Mom.

263
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,653
- We're all special people.

264
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,440
Each one of us unique,

265
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,375
with our very own personality.

266
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,990
(frog croaking)

267
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,020
A little spark, you see,
that burns only in you.

268
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,270
And that's something we must treasure,

269
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,423
each and every day.

270
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,920
- What a day, I'm bushed.

271
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,220
- You know, Henry David
said it best, I think.

272
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:30,947
"If a man does not keep
pace with his companions,

273
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:33,547
"perhaps it is because he
hears a different drummer.

274
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:37,417
"Let him step to that
music which he hears,

275
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:41,217
"however measured or far, far away."

276
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,373
Oh, well!

277
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,950
You better get some sleep.

278
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,700
Sweet dreams, honey.

279
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,470
(Mrs. Anderson sighs)

280
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,720
Oh!

281
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,173
And put that frog in the garage
before your father sees it.

282
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:03,090
(door thuds shut)

283
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,853
- Hey, Arlo, you look confused.

284
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,370
- Are you a dream?

285
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,781
- A dream?

286
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:13,700
You no see.

287
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,277
I'm a frog.

288
00:15:15,277 --> 00:15:16,110
- A frog?

289
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,350
- Well, not really a frog.

290
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,490
- You're not really a frog?

291
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,770
- [Gus] Yeah, of course not.

292
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,603
- Of course not.

293
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:24,083
- I'm Prince Giuseppe Bueno Dono.

294
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,562
- Giuseppe Buen-what?

295
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:30,090
- Better you call me Gus.

296
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,683
I'm a frog, 600 years.

297
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,990
- And I though the teen years were rough.

298
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,970
- But someday you grow up.

299
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,550
I stay frog another 600 years unless...

300
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,260
- Unless what?

301
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,823
- [Gus] Unless I get a kiss.

302
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,900
- You mean?

303
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,123
- One kiss from beautiful
woman turn me back into prince.

304
00:15:51,823 --> 00:15:53,540
(gentle music)

305
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,433
- He's reading.

306
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,293
Out loud.

307
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,873
- It was the dinosaurs.

308
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,720
- What dinosaurs?

309
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,900
- The plastic ones I got
him when he was a kid.

310
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,830
He started reading books on dinosaurs.

311
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,760
Then he started reading
books on (shudders) snakes.

312
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,290
Then he bought some snakes.

313
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,640
Then the snakes took over the garage,

314
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,900
they took over his room.

315
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,183
Now they've taken over our lives.

316
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:26,660
- Bill, we have to remember,

317
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,130
we have a son who gets straight A's,

318
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,397
whose teachers all like him,

319
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:33,373
and who comes home right after school.

320
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,213
- Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.

321
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:40,360
- Well, we should thank our lucky stars

322
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,913
that dinosaurs are extinct. (laughs)

323
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,721
- Are you sure?

324
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:50,970
(Mrs. Anderson laughs)

325
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,040
- Why me?

326
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,240
- What?

327
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,950
- Why did you choose me?

328
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,783
- Hey, Arlo,

329
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:58,533
how many people take a
frog on their first date?

330
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:00,637
(school bell ringing)

331
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:01,923
So this is your school, no?

332
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,900
Hmm.

333
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,450
I see that style coming back.

334
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,513
- Coming back?

335
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,473
Oh!

336
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,783
- Sure you'll be all right?

337
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:25,153
- Uh, yes, sir.

338
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:27,193
(stammering) I just
need a little fresh air.

339
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,740
How was I to know we were
dissecting frogs today?

340
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,623
Are you okay?

341
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:37,390
(bangs into locker)

342
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,430
- The young lady from the theater, no?

343
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,463
- You should know, you sat on her lap.

344
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,383
How's it going?

345
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,003
- [Gus] You sure have a lot of friends.

346
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,119
(dramatic music)

347
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,200
If you don't mind, I stay over here.

348
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,600
Snakes make me, er, uncomfortable

349
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,700
- People make me uncomfortable.

350
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,640
There!

351
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,240
Just wait until those
science fair judges see this.

352
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,170
- [Gus] They want you hurry with crickets.

353
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,750
They hungry.

354
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,740
- I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.

355
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,910
Peter, Mary, now, don't
gulp down your food.

356
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,610
Kenneth, I got your favorite grub.

357
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,250
You know, Gus, we got a chance

358
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,650
to make a great contribution to science.

359
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,700
- I just want a kiss.

360
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,240
- Gus, I'd like to help
you, but let's face it,

361
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,640
how can I get you kissed
when I can't get kissed?

362
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,173
- I thought you liked Suzy.

363
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,920
- Well, it's not a question if I like her.

364
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,310
It's how much she hates me.

365
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,193
- [Gus] She very impressed by those worms.

366
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,600
- Yeah, she did like my talk, didn't she?

367
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,433
Worms.

368
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,150
Do they know their left
hand from the right?

369
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,033
- You go on date, no?

370
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,570
- Date?

371
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,180
Why would a wonderful,
beautiful girl like Suzy

372
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,520
want to go out with me?

373
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,100
- Why not?

374
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,590
- Let me see.

375
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,650
Because I'm skinny, homely, nerdy,

376
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,080
clumsy, and in short, a real Rubis.

377
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,640
- [Gus] Well, those are good reasons.

378
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,443
But what about you being a good scientist?

379
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:29,770
- Oh, who cares?

380
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,940
- [Gus] I met Einstein once.

381
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,550
All the girls liked to kiss Einstein.

382
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,670
- I never heard that.

383
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,423
- Hey, Arlo, all you need is a-confidence.

384
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:43,640
- Well, I'm pretty a-confident
they'll think I'm a nerd.

385
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,030
- Leave it to me.

386
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,973
I get you date, you get me kiss.

387
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,338
(bright music)

388
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,663
Go ahead.

389
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:05,020
- Uh, maybe we should do this later, Gus.

390
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,103
My chemistry class starts in a--

391
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:07,970
- What do you lose?

392
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,840
Already she think you are Aruba.

393
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,170
- That's Rubis.

394
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,703
- Remember, a-confidence.

395
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,962
(gentle music)

396
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,533
- (clears throat) Uh...

397
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:25,533
(voice breaks) Suzy?

398
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,870
Would you...

399
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,130
Well, I mean, could I ask...

400
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,530
- [Kathy] Spit it out, Arlo.

401
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:35,890
- [Gus] A-confidence.

402
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,840
- Would you like to be my science fair?

403
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:44,210
(scoffs) I mean my, my
science fair partner.

404
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,350
- Oh.

405
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,407
Sure, Arlo.

406
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:47,240
(Kathy gulps)

407
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,816
- Oh, well, that's okay.

408
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:49,649
I mean, I didn't think,

409
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,760
well, you know it was
just an idea and I...

410
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,200
Did you say...

411
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,233
- Yeah, sure, I'll be
your science fair partner.

412
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,730
- [Gus] What I tell you?

413
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,170
A-confidence!

414
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,490
- [Kathy] I do not believe it.

415
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,850
- Well, I need the grade.

416
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,520
Otherwise I can't become a cheerleader.

417
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,340
And you heard Jim, Arlo always gets A's.

418
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,840
- I know, but you'll have
to be with him sometimes.

419
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,690
- Well, if I can become a
cheerleader, it'll be worth it.

420
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,923
I think.

421
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,570
(Arlo humming "That's Amore")

422
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:31,760
- Is it me or has Arlo
been acting strange lately?

423
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,490
- It's just another metamorphic stage

424
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,090
of the growth experience, honey.

425
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,017
(doorbell chimes)

426
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:39,980
- [Arlo] I'll get it!

427
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,435
- See what I mean?

428
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:42,268
It's strange.

429
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,973
- Uh, this is Suzy, my
science fair partner.

430
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,580
- Hi.

431
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,413
- Hi.
- Hi.

432
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,390
(Mrs. Anderson giggles)

433
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,269
I can't believe it.

434
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:01,156
(Suzy screams nearby)

435
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:01,989
- Its okay.

436
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:02,910
Wayne only eats chickens.

437
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,040
- Are these all yours?

438
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,960
- They sure are.

439
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,860
Staring from the right, that's
Henry, a green tree python.

440
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,837
That's Terry, a kingsnake.

441
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,620
Bridget, a corn snake.

442
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,220
There's Jonathan, the monitor.

443
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,203
Um, Gertrude, my iguana.

444
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,343
Oh, I guess you'd like to
see our science fair project.

445
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,660
- Can I just see it from here?

446
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,720
- It used to be blind
reptiles, but I changed it.

447
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,973
- I'm glad to hear that.

448
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,610
- Now it's how frogs communicate.

449
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,480
And here's the star of our exhibit, Gus.

450
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,400
- Arlo, so what if frogs communicate?

451
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,050
- Well, the ramifications could apply

452
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,120
to a variety of species.

453
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,236
The brains of frogs are primitive.

454
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,069
(Gus croaking)

455
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,490
Well, the brains of most frogs.

456
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,550
People always underestimate
things they don't understand.

457
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,750
All creatures have feelings.

458
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,870
And maybe our science
experiment will help them

459
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,893
take another look.

460
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,420
Well, they're not really that slimy.

461
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,120
- [Mr. Anderson] Everybody in their cages?

462
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,850
- Oh, I hope so.

463
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,130
- Uh, yeah, I just brought you guys some

464
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,810
Salty Sailor Pretzels.

465
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,620
I know how hard you have to
work with these, uh, toads,

466
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,340
but you still have to eat, right?

467
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,750
- Uh, thanks, Dad.

468
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,040
- Oh, Suzy, I think it's
great that girls like you

469
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,790
love reptiles like my son does.

470
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,423
- Oh, well, uh...

471
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:33,610
- I mean, I love 'em, too. (laughs)

472
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,680
I, I wouldn't,

473
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,040
I wouldn't know what to do without 'em.

474
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,000
They're very interesting and I think--

475
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,361
Ah, ah! Oh!

476
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:41,960
Ooh! (laughs)

477
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,127
Oh, those turtles, they just sorta

478
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:48,060
sneak up on you like that and, uh...

479
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,220
Well, I guess I'll
leave you two alone now.

480
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,990
I know you have a lot of
work to do on your, uh,

481
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,633
science, uh, project.

482
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,830
- Wheat germ cobbler, anyone?

483
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,630
- How do you stand it?

484
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,100
You and him alone,

485
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,970
with all those things?

486
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,500
- Well, at least it'll be over soon.

487
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,380
Arlo will have the whole
thing done in another week.

488
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,410
- I gotta hand it to you.

489
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,760
I mean, I would not have been
able to use Arlo like that

490
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,260
and still look him in the eye.

491
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,183
- Yeah.

492
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,503
Got to hand it to me.

493
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:30,694
(dramatic music)

494
00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:32,110
(frog croaking)

495
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,210
- [Gus] What'd he say?

496
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,330
- Uh, that's easy.

497
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,870
A mating call.

498
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,703
- Close.

499
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:38,773
That a dinner call.

500
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,543
- Two long croaks, one short.

501
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:45,339
You know something, Gus?

502
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:48,900
We're on the trail of a major
scientific breakthrough.

503
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,740
If it wasn't for you, I'd
still be doing blind reptiles.

504
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,820
Alone.

505
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,570
- Oh, this is your idea.

506
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,923
You're the scientist.

507
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,660
- Just think what Einstein
could have done with this.

508
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,570
But we still got a lot of work ahead.

509
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,350
- You work, I sing.

510
00:25:04,513 --> 00:25:06,352
- You know something?

511
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:07,853
I think Suzy really likes me.

512
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,400
Maybe she'd like to go to
Whittlestone's Pet Shop with me.

513
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,930
- Pet shop?

514
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,680
Arlo, what about a nice
Italian restaurant?

515
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,250
A little music, a little pasta.

516
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,300
- Wow.

517
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,870
- By the way, when I get kissed?

518
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,850
- Hey, I'm working on it.

519
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,993
A promise is a promise and I
promise I'll get you kissed.

520
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,710
- Thanks, honey.

521
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,930
Next.

522
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,080
- Uh, would it be any extra

523
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,720
if you kissed me with your eyes closed?

524
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,879
- Oh, for you, handsome, no extra charge.

525
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:39,190
(coins clink)

526
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,863
All right, batter up.

527
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:51,208
(woman screams)

528
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:56,150
- I guess I come on too strong.

529
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,930
- Remember when you used
to kiss me goodnight,

530
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,180
it'd make me feel better?

531
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:02,000
- Oh, Arlo.

532
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,410
You want a goodnight kiss?

533
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,373
- Not me, Mom.

534
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,813
My frog.

535
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:15,080
(playful music)

536
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,840
- [Gus] What about Suzy?

537
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,733
- Absolutely not!

538
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,193
- [Gus] Hey, Arlo, hey,
it was just an idea.

539
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,723
- Gus?

540
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,833
Who's Gus?

541
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:31,712
- His frog.

542
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,350
- He wanted you to kiss a frog?

543
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:37,980
- I bet you did things like
that when you were his age.

544
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,723
- I didn't know what a frog
was until Arlo came along.

545
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,270
I mean, Suzy looks like a nice girl.

546
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,993
Even if she does like snakes.

547
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,130
(sighs) Here I thought Arlo was finally

548
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,100
joining the major leagues.

549
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,220
Is there some disease, you know,

550
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,520
that makes people like
toads more than people?

551
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,490
- Maybe we should have a talk with him.

552
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,740
- Yeah, well, if we talk, it's
going to be in my ballpark,

553
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,503
not with those (shudders) snakes.

554
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,220
- For the onions.

555
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,083
- Hmm, looks scientific.

556
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,183
Arlo.

557
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,200
Your father and I would like
to have a talk with you.

558
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,800
- Gertrude didn't get out again?

559
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,603
- No.

560
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,270
- [Mr. Anderson] Do you see...

561
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,293
- Go ahead, there's no snakes here.

562
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:26,141
- Uh, yeah.

563
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:28,550
Well, you see, son, when I was your age,

564
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,570
I did things that all the other guys did.

565
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,680
- I don't think I'm old enough, Dad.

566
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,100
- No, that's not what I mean.

567
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,580
I mean that, well, maybe we
swallowed a few dozen goldfish.

568
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,720
- Really?

569
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,170
I wish my garter snake ate like that.

570
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,730
- Arlo, what he's trying to say is,

571
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,490
well, we went to parties,
to football games,

572
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,188
to civil rights demonstrations.

573
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,740
(Mr. Anderson tsks)

574
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,290
Well, I went to civil
rights demonstrations.

575
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,180
- Yeah, that's right.

576
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,240
With people.

577
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,040
Arlo, you see, people are
warmblooded creatures, okay?

578
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,170
And toads are coldblooded.

579
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,427
And when yo mix warm
and cold, you get, uh,

580
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,193
lukewarm-blooded.

581
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:13,723
- Uh, thanks, Dad.

582
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:20,758
- Well, you can't argue
with that, can you?

583
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,585
(upbeat music)

584
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,950
- Gertrude, move, you're in the way.

585
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,783
Come on, go.

586
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,922
Go.

587
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,423
- You know, she likes her belly rubbed.

588
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,619
(Suzy laughs)

589
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:45,202
(upbeat music)

590
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:48,990
- Okay.

591
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,590
I think we're ready to test now.

592
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,820
- Boy, Arlo, you really did a lot of work.

593
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,580
- We did a lot of work.

594
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,413
- Yeah.

595
00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:57,620
You got to hand it to us.

596
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,170
- Yeah.

597
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,210
Notice the Subject B frogs
in the soundproof vessel.

598
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,800
Their only auditory input
comes from this speaker,

599
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,650
which is connected to this microphone

600
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,340
in front of Subject A frog, Gus.

601
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,333
Now, watch this.

602
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,070
Prompted by the auditory
and visual stimulation

603
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,113
of the crickets,

604
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:17,150
(crickets chirping)

605
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,014
Gus, Subject A frog, should
begin to croak "food is here."

606
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:21,847
(Gus croaking)

607
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,120
Upon hearing the food call,

608
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,580
the Subject B frogs should
hop towards the speaker

609
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,123
inside the soundproof vessel.

610
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:31,320
(Gus croaking)

611
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,660
- They did it.

612
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,090
- Now watch this.

613
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,880
Snakes are the natural enemies of frogs.

614
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,457
Gus will croak "Get the
heck out of here, danger."

615
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,535
Gus will croak "Get the
heck out of here, danger."

616
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,916
(Gus croaking)

617
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,648
And the Subject B frogs
beat a hasty retreat.

618
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:54,420
- (gasps) Wow!

619
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,723
It works!

620
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:58,185
I mean, Arlo, it really works!

621
00:29:58,185 --> 00:30:00,140
- 'Course it works.

622
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,337
- You know, before I
started working with you,

623
00:30:01,337 --> 00:30:04,410
I'd never given much thought to frogs.

624
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,500
- Yeah.

625
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,950
You didn't even know I
was in your science class.

626
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:12,676
(upbeat music)

627
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,710
- You see, this is a volcano
and this is how they smoke.

628
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:43,659
(smoke hissing)

629
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:45,890
(lava bubbling)

630
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,200
- You did a nice job with the lava.

631
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,516
- Don't you just love lava?

632
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:53,183
(lava bubbling)

633
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,910
- Looking good, Gus.

634
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,743
- Grazie.

635
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,433
- You know...

636
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,672
Nah.

637
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,500
- This is Arlo Anderson, one
of our best science students.

638
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,690
- And this is Suzy Bennett, my partner.

639
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,783
- Suzy?

640
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:15,050
I would never have thought that you took

641
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,723
such an interest in science.

642
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,030
Very smart pairing up with Arlo Anderson.

643
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,583
Well, Arlo, let's see how this works.

644
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,160
As our project will demonstrate,

645
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,770
frogs have an extremely complex
system of communication.

646
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,280
When the bull, or dominant
amphibian, subject A here,

647
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,113
let's out a...

648
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,972
(upbeat music)

649
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,850
Proving the lingual
capabilities inherent in

650
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,763
rana catesbeiana, or the common bullfrog.

651
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,103
- It's not bad.

652
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,670
- How frogs communicate?

653
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,503
Ick!

654
00:33:35,503 --> 00:33:38,470
Only a real Poindexter could
think up something like that.

655
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,200
- Arlo thinks that understanding frogs

656
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,535
will help us understand ourselves.

657
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:44,300
- (laughs) You're kidding!

658
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,500
Gosh, you had a rougher
time than I thought.

659
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:50,420
- Well, Arlo, what happened
to the blind reptiles?

660
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,610
- Well, amphibian
communication has sort of

661
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,980
captured my attention
in the past few weeks.

662
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,990
- You aren't serious about
this, are you, young man?

663
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,093
- Well, yes sir.

664
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:01,930
- (laughs) Why, this is nothing more than

665
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,510
a trained animal act.

666
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,343
How'd you do it?

667
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,770
Electric shocks?

668
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,540
- Electric shocks?

669
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,900
- Arlo, do you realize you're speaking

670
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,140
of a type of communication associated with

671
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,200
higher life forms?

672
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,580
- Well, that's exactly
the question I'm asking.

673
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,610
What do we mean by higher life forms?

674
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,610
- You expect us to believe this?

675
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,980
This toad has a brain the
size of this pencil point.

676
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,900
- But this isn't a toad.

677
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,963
No, don't!

678
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:30,083
- You certainly chose an ugly
representative of the species.

679
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,666
(Gus croaking)

680
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,040
- Could I please have
Subject A back, please?

681
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,200
- What's this?

682
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,920
A scar from an electrode?

683
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,440
- [Gus] Get you peasant's claws

684
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,273
off of me.
- Achoo!

685
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:45,103
- What did you say?

686
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:45,974
- Achoo!

687
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:48,400
Uh, I'm allergic to frogs.

688
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,250
- What are you so nervous about, hmm?

689
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,090
- My theory of amphibian communication

690
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:57,473
is based on a solid
foundation of several tests.

691
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,460
Frogs use the vocal auditory channel

692
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,330
for the communicative act.

693
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,920
They broadcast a transmission

694
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,360
and have directional reception.

695
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,283
- [Judge] Mr. Anderson,
where is your verification?

696
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,790
- [Arlo] Well, I believe this project

697
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,262
presents plenty of verification.

698
00:35:15,262 --> 00:35:17,900
- Hm, they want a verification,
I'll give them verification.

699
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,510
- We're not here to play games.

700
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,960
The integrity of this experiment

701
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,530
has been severely compromised.

702
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,630
- Frogs have a syntax.

703
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,390
True, it has not been proven
that the communicative act

704
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,710
is for communication alone.

705
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,730
- Mr. Anderson, in all my
years of judging science fairs,

706
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,583
I have never seen anyone
falsify their data.

707
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,800
- Can you believe this?

708
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,240
The only reason you worked with that nerd

709
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,410
was to pass science.

710
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,360
Now he's ruining the whole thing

711
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,053
because of some stupid frog.

712
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,480
- Uh, certainly the data here proves

713
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,293
beyond reasonable doubt
that amphibians communicate.

714
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,623
Sometimes better than people.

715
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,990
- [Gus] Those stinking mud-eating serfs!

716
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,650
- Look, Harding, I must say
I find the boy's hypothesis

717
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,573
outlandish, but also intriguing.

718
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,550
From the results of the field tests,

719
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,073
can we review your linear verification?

720
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,193
- Gentlemen, why don't we
move on to the next exhibit?

721
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,623
Arlo, why didn't you stick
with the blind reptiles?

722
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,566
(dramatic music)

723
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:59,056
(overhead speakers crackling)

724
00:36:59,056 --> 00:37:02,798

It was too good to be
true for a Rubis like me.

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,950
- [Gus] I've not been much help, no?

776
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,240
- [Arlo] Well, I haven't been much help

777
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,643
getting you kissed, either.

778
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,903
You did prove my hypothesis.

779
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,110
I don't care what those scientists say.

780
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,160
- [Gus] You're right.

781
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,520
What do they know?

782
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,930
I met Galileo once.

783
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,920
No one believed him world flat.

784
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,253
- [Arlo] Uh, Gus,

785
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,373
the world's round.

786
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,093
- [Gus] What?

787
00:40:02,093 --> 00:40:02,926
I no believe it.

788
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,440
- Maybe they'll let me back in school.

789
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,108
When I get out of jail.

790
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,223
With time off for good behavior.

791
00:40:16,398 --> 00:40:17,813
- [Gus] Hey, a-confidence.

792
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,263
- Let's face it, Gus.

793
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,453
It's not working out.

794
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,830
We keep getting in each other's way.

795
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,383
- Maybe you're right.

796
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,760
- What will you do now?

797
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,980
- Ah, no worry about me.

798
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,147
Just got to stay away from science fairs.

799
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:39,814
(Arlo chuckles)

800
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:44,380
- (sighs) Next time you need a friend

801
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,063
to help you join the human race,

802
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,400
pick someone who really belongs.

803
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:53,011
(birds singing)

804
00:40:56,962 --> 00:40:58,545
Well, so long, Gus.

805
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:06,725
- Arlo!

806
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,957
Someday people realize truth about you.

807
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:13,239
You're a real prince.

808
00:41:15,312 --> 00:41:17,895
(gentle music)

809
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,380
- Coulda told me you were using me.

810
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:48,727
I still would've helped you pass science.

811
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,440
- I never really wanted to
be a cheerleader anyway.

812
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,930
You know, the judges
were wrong about our...

813
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,563
Your science exhibit.

814
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,150
- Yeah.

815
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,140
Gus proved that.

816
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,300
- (scoffs) What do you mean, Gus?

817
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,557
- Well, it was...

818
00:42:16,173 --> 00:42:17,006
You see,

819
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,933
Gus is no ordinary frog.

820
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,143
Gus was sticking up for me.

821
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,400
That's why he started
to sing "That's Amore."

822
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,700
You see, it's like,

823
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,593
it's like a call for a frog's dinner.

824
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,403
Or is it a mating call?

825
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,590
Anyway, frogs love that song.

826
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,740
- Wait, let's get this straight.

827
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,010
Now, I know the science fair
judges couldn't understand

828
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,510
frog communication, but...

829
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:47,400
What are you saying?

830
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,900
- Remember the theater?

831
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,490
You thought the croaks were
coming from the screen?

832
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,386
- I certainly remember that.

833
00:42:53,386 --> 00:42:55,860
- Well, at that time, I
didn't know Gus was Gus

834
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,530
until I went home and there he was.

835
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,370
- Now, go slow, this is
the part I don't get.

836
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,910
- That's when he started talking to me.

837
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,180
- Okay.

838
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,660
Okay, I understand.

839
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,973
Like frog talk, right?

840
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,143
- Well, no.

841
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,810
Like people talk.

842
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:14,713
- People talk?

843
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,580
Like, like English?

844
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,750
- Well, Italian.

845
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,473
But his English wasn't bad.

846
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,530
You see, Gus is very well cultured.

847
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,100
He's been around.

848
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,560
Heck, he knew Leonardo da Vinci.

849
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,393
- Wow.

850
00:43:31,393 --> 00:43:34,060
- You know that underwater
diving suit Leonardo invented?

851
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,020
That was Gus's idea.

852
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,530
Well, Leonardo drew the design, of course.

853
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,690
And you know the helicopter
he was supposed to think up?

854
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,600
- Arlo...

855
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:47,030
- 600 years ago there was a prince,

856
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,680
Prince Giuseppe Bueno Dono Tarantini.

857
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,720
- Giuseppe Bueno?

858
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,170
- You know, Gus.

859
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,823
He's a frog, 600 years.

860
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,713
And he'll stay that way forever.

861
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,812
Unless...

862
00:43:59,812 --> 00:44:01,450
- Unless what?

863
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,713
- Unless he gets a kiss.

864
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,160
- You mean?

865
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,460
- One kiss will change
him back into a prince.

866
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,513
- You really think this frog is a prince?

867
00:44:17,886 --> 00:44:20,009
- Well, if he's not a prince,

868
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:21,609
at least he's a pretty good guy.

869
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,453
- Where is Gus?

870
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,453
- Well, we sorta agreed
to go our separate ways.

871
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,693
Last I saw him, he was
down by Grossman's Pond.

872
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:40,392
(insects chirping)

873
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,433
- I'll do it.

874
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,650
- Do what?

875
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,073
- I'll kiss the...

876
00:44:48,183 --> 00:44:49,016
Gus.

877
00:45:01,814 --> 00:45:04,731
(knocking at door)

878
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:07,554
- Can I help you?

879
00:45:07,554 --> 00:45:10,304
(frogs croaking)

880
00:45:11,855 --> 00:45:13,600
- You know, I always thought
kids were going to the dogs.

881
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,760
- Yeah, maybe we should leave a few frogs

882
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,733
back at the school.

883
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,894
I bet some of them would graduate.

884
00:45:17,894 --> 00:45:18,909
- Yeah! (laughs)

885
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:20,755
With honors!

886
00:45:20,755 --> 00:45:22,220
- [Arlo] Didn't think
they'd call the police.

887
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,613
- [Suzy] Who do you call when
frogs attack a high school?

888
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,090
- That's got to be the last load.

889
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,202
Come on!

890
00:45:28,202 --> 00:45:29,376
Gus!

891
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:30,524
(frogs croaking)

892
00:45:30,524 --> 00:45:31,631
Gus!
- Arlo!

893
00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:32,464
- [Arlo] Hey, Gus!

894
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:33,383
- Arlo!

895
00:45:33,383 --> 00:45:34,305
- Hey, Gus!

896
00:45:34,305 --> 00:45:36,575
(frogs croaking)

897
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:38,020
Gus!

898
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,070
- Well, how do you know which one is Gus?

899
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,300
- Well, he has sort of a

900
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,893
smiley mouth.

901
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,541
- A smiley mouth?

902
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,291
(frogs croaking)

903
00:45:53,864 --> 00:45:54,697
- Gus!

904
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:56,743
- Gus?

905
00:45:56,743 --> 00:45:57,576
Gus!

906
00:45:58,463 --> 00:45:59,296
Gus!

907
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:03,636
Are you smiling or frowning?

908
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,148
- [Arlo] Gus!

909
00:46:05,148 --> 00:46:06,533
Gus!

910
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:07,366
Hey, Gus.

911
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,060
(frogs croaking)

912
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:14,165
Gus!

913
00:46:15,183 --> 00:46:16,683
- [Suzy] Hey, Gus.

914
00:46:17,522 --> 00:46:18,434
Gus!

915
00:46:18,434 --> 00:46:20,363
(frogs croaking)

916
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:21,196
Gus!

917
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,862
(frogs croaking)

918
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:44,386
- Yeah, get 'em in there.

919
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:47,202
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

920
00:46:47,202 --> 00:46:48,035
- Gus!

921
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:50,868
(water splashing)

922
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:53,064
- [Suzy] Gus!

923
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:54,943
Gus!
- Gus!

924
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:59,496
(frogs croaking)

925
00:47:06,676 --> 00:47:09,426
(dramatic music)

926
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:24,291
- [Gus] Arlo!

927
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,124
Suzy!

928
00:47:25,124 --> 00:47:26,170
Please make way.

929
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,314
Thank you very much.

930
00:47:27,314 --> 00:47:28,230
Arlo!

931
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,130
I beg your pardon.

932
00:47:33,005 --> 00:47:33,838
- You think they're crazy?

933
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:35,900
- Nowadays you never can tell with kids.

934
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,913
Let's take 'em in.

935
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,739
(frogs croaking)

936
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:42,572
- [Gus] Suzy!

937
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:44,296
Save your kisses for me!

938
00:47:44,296 --> 00:47:47,213
I'm the only real prince in a pond!

939
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:52,250
- [Officer] All right, the gig's up.

940
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,500
(Gus speaking muffled)

941
00:48:10,947 --> 00:48:14,114
(car doors bang shut)

942
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,457
- Thanks.

943
00:48:16,457 --> 00:48:17,803
- But nothing happened.

944
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,973
I'm not a very good kisser, I guess.

945
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,003
- Well, Gus probably wasn't there.

946
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,340
I'm sure you kiss great.

947
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,553
- You think so?

948
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,580
("That's Amore")

949
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:46,452
(gentle music)

950
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,472
- Couldn't you have just taken us to jail?

951
00:49:05,472 --> 00:49:07,780
(knocking on door)

952
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,820
- You'll never believe
what these two delinquents

953
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,910
have been up to tonight.

954
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:11,990
- These are no delinquents.

955
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,123
This is my son, a scientist!

956
00:49:14,991 --> 00:49:15,824
Ha!

957
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:16,657
Bravo!

958
00:49:16,657 --> 00:49:19,873
(all clapping)

959
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,563
- [Man] Well done.

960
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:22,396
- Come here, you.

961
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:25,370
- Arlo, Suzy, we owe you a big apology.

962
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,990
- Dr. Fritsky rechecked your data.

963
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,277
You've made a great discovery.

964
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:30,747
- Oh, wunderbar!

965
00:49:30,747 --> 00:49:31,580
Mwah, mwah!

966
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,498
Wunderbar!

967
00:49:32,498 --> 00:49:35,860
Mwah, mwah! (laughs)

968
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,270
- We were skeptical that kids your age

969
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,550
could have such insights.

970
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,210
But when we saw all those frogs,

971
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,040
that was all the verification we needed.

972
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,873
- [Arlo] Well, uh--

973
00:49:42,873 --> 00:49:45,090
- I suspected the
hypothesis might be correct,

974
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,403
but such a demonstration
convinced us. (laughs)

975
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:49,210
- Why didn't you tell us
the frogs were coming?

976
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,520
- Of course, both of you
win the science scholarship.

977
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,880
- Science scholarship?

978
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,700
- And the results of your
exhibit will be published

979
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,623
in "Amphibian Today" magazine.

980
00:49:58,057 --> 00:50:00,010
- Oh, I knew all those seaweed casseroles

981
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,630
would pay off someday.

982
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,830
- The first college
graduate in the family,

983
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:05,097
chip off the old block.

984
00:50:05,097 --> 00:50:05,930
- Woo!

985
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:06,763
(all clapping)

986
00:50:06,763 --> 00:50:08,510
- See, I told you to
hang on to those frogs.

987
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:12,051
- I still think Arlo's a dweeb,
but at least you're okay.

988
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,260
(Kathy screams)

989
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,130
- Kathy, calm down.

990
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,747
You're upsetting Gertrude.

991
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:18,330
(all laughing)

992
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,632
(accordion music)

993
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:30,100
- Mm!

994
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,330
Here's to the next Einsteins,

995
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,144
Suzy and Arlo.

996
00:50:34,144 --> 00:50:36,811
(glasses clink)

997
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:43,860
- He's probably in a
Louisiana swamp by now.

998
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,720
- Don't worry.

999
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,943
We'll find him someday.

1000
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,303
- Yeah. (sighs)

1001
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,422
(all clapping)

1002
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:03,890
- Why, thank you, thank you very much.

1003
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,660
I'm gonna sing for you
tonight a love song.

1004
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,460
Love, she's a special language,

1005
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,500
understood by everybody and everything.

1006
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,733
