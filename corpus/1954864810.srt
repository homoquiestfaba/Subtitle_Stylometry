<i>[Episode 15]</i>

3
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,350
I'm not much of a hunter.

4
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:21,281
But, he was hanging out in front of
my house so blatantly.

5
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:23,816
I caught him and brought him here.

6
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:28,554
Oh, I didn't kill him.

7
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:31,714
Instead, I did give him a small amount
of tranquilizer.

8
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:35,623
No wait... it wasn't a small amount.
It was a lot.

9
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:38,702
He'll wake up much later.

10
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:40,636
Why did you bring him to me?

11
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:43,068
He's one of infected that have been
after the both of us.

12
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:45,157
Now that I've caught him,
of course I should share.

13
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:49,021
Is that the only reason?

14
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,320
Of course,
I have a more important reason why.

15
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:57,395
Kill him for me... Director.

16
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:08,652
Whether it's a human or an infected,
I've never killed before.

17
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:13,652
From what I saw of you last time,
you seem very comfortable with it.

18
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:16,009
I'm not all that comfortable with it.

19
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,108
Why don't you take this
opportunity to do it yourself?

20
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:25,627
Isn't it something you
ought try once anyhow?

21
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,550
I'll do when the time comes.

22
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:30,786
But this time,
I'd like to request that you do it.

23
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:36,151
And once it's done,
please send me a picture.

24
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,225
It's not that I don't trust you,
Director.

25
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,541
I'd like to see how he looks
when he's dead.

26
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:49,546
He wouldn't show up somewhere
alive or anything, right?

27
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:53,300
I should get going now.

28
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,090
I'm sorry for the inconvenience
I've caused.

29
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,612
Do you really the Director will
get rid of that infected man?

30
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,114
That's what I'm saying.

31
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:20,327
It will be a while before
the tranquilizer wears off.

32
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:23,489
Whether he kills him or not,
that's not what's important.

33
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,240
If he kills him,
he's killing a long-time follower.

34
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,916
If he doesn't kill him,
he's revealing his true self to me.

35
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:37,224
That's quite the dilemma.

36
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,723
That's true.

37
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:41,305
That could be more frustrating
for the Director.

38
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:46,845
Then, we'll just sit back and
wait for the picture proof.

39
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:49,284
Most likely, he won't kill him.

40
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,084
Why do you think that?

41
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:52,700
It would hurt his pride.

42
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,499
To go along with my prank
like that.

43
00:03:56,996 --> 00:04:01,176
Then, we can sleep without
a worry tonight.

44
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:18,452
Kill him.

45
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:22,705
- But, Doctor...
- Kill him.

46
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:31,471
Thank you for all the years, Doctor.

47
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,792
J is like a brother to me.

48
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,138
So?

49
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:42,208
I will kill Park Ji Sang instead.

50
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:44,009
Then everything will be...

51
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,638
We've been together for 40 years.

52
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:57,884
It is enough that Do Sung and Hyuk Joong
sacrificed their lives.

53
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,580
Tell me why!

54
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:12,120
Tell me why you have become
my weakness!

55
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,597
I apologize.

56
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:19,078
I didn't save you from death,
so that you could be insulted like this.

57
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:26,285
If we fail from a small mistake...

58
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,667
all of our time together...

59
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,699
it becomes nothing,
but time we spent preparing for failure.

60
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:40,600
All that will be left is... nothing.

61
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:59,392
Why aren't you sleeping?

62
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,993
Since you're body temperature is
normal, aren't you cold these days?

63
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,663
I can endure it.

64
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:09,532
It's not so bad.

65
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,964
Do you want to sleep in the room?

66
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,305
What about you?

67
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:17,965
I'll sleep on bed.
Chief, you can sleep on the floor.

68
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,114
There's lots of room the floor.

69
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:23,377
Forget it. There should be a distinction
between women and men.

70
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:25,569
Goodness.

71
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,414
Have you been living since the
end of the Joseon era?

72
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:36,385
I feel like I'm being an annoyance.

73
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:40,715
Should I just go back to my place?

74
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:44,443
What are you talking about?

75
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:47,697
- Forget about it.
- You startled me.

76
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:50,657
Why are you getting so upset?

77
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:53,940
Don't leave until I've decided that
it's safe.

78
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,079
Okay. I won't leave until you
finish making your decision.

79
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:03,618
Go to sleep.

80
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,984
Can't you stay a little longer?

81
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:23,031
I'm having trouble sleeping tonight.

82
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:27,928
Should I sing you a lullaby or something?

83
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,509
I don't need anything like that.

84
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:37,157
Just... stay next to me.

85
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,390
You don't even have to say anything.

86
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:26,808
Come in.

87
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:31,093
It's a nice morning, isn't it?

88
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:34,966
Yes, it is.

89
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:38,126
By the way,
you didn't send me that picture.

90
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:40,073
I waited all night.

91
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:44,050
I didn't think it was necessary
to show you.

92
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,225
Why's that?

93
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:49,201
There's no need to publicize a
harsh image like that.

94
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,695
Because it's too harsh?

95
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:55,912
Thank you for keeping my feelings
in mind.

96
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:59,090
Well, we'll just say that I saw it then.

97
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,301
Since, I trust you, Director.

98
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,558
Oh right, I have something
I need to do today.

99
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:12,974
There might be a small commotion.
Please understand.

100
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,366
- Is that true?
- Yes.

101
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:31,056
But, how are you going
deal with the aftermath?

102
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:33,506
The aftermath? I was depending on you
to take care of it.

103
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,662
- Me?
- Yes.

104
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,675
- Why? Can't you take care of it?
- Well, it's not that.

105
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:41,696
Do it! Just go for it.
I'll take responsibility.

106
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,022
Prepare the apparatus I need to
withdraw blood, please.

107
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:59,221
I'll be drawing for maybe four or
five patients.

108
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,780
Chief...

109
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,555
- Do you, perhaps, have approval?
- No.

110
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:03,950
It's just me, on my own.

111
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,311
We'll take care it,
so don't worry about it, Nurse.

112
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,081
If another commotion arises like
last time...

113
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:13,221
I can't promise that it won't,
but I'll end it as soon as possible.

114
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:15,582
As soon as possible.

115
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:57,823
This has nothing to do with you.

116
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:01,087
You can't get mixed up in this
like last time, so step outside.

117
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:04,244
Go on.

118
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,943
I'll be fine.

119
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:39,302
Restrain them, like you did last time.

120
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:41,326
Don't let them get away.

121
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:03,216
If you keep doing this,
it can get problematic.

122
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:04,907
Then, let it be a problem.

123
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,836
I'm asking you, politely.

124
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:14,905
Please hand over the blood sample.

125
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:17,878
Please move out of the way. We're busy.

126
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,142
We can't move.

127
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:29,304
Move before I finish my counting.

128
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:33,370
If you don't, you'll spend the day
looking at the ceiling of the clinic.

129
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,419
I'll make sure you can't get up.

130
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:19,535
You all should have taken my word for it.

131
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:24,911
Nurse, please call some people
from the clinic.

132
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,723
That looked really painful.

133
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,080
Which way are they heading?

134
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,321
Head over there right now.

135
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:06,472
How could something like this...

136
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:12,134
- Chief!
- Yes, yes.

137
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,149
Yes...

138
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,160
These are the exam results for
the multiple myeloma patient.

139
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:23,473
Did you check the patient's
immunoglobulin, as well?

140
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:24,553
Yes.

141
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:28,385
So, what were you up to?

142
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:31,443
Uh... nothing. Nothing.

143
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:35,384
You're acting strange lately.
It seems like you're hiding something.

144
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:38,262
Hide? What would I hide?

145
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:40,897
What secrets would I have from you,
Doctor Choi?

146
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:42,405
Of course you do!

147
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:44,475
Last year, when you had a prostate
infection, for two weeks you...

148
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:47,443
Hey, hey... why would you bring that up?

149
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:52,121
Anyways if you have another secret,
I'll be very upset.

150
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:55,030
- For real.
- Okay.

151
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:09,958
What's going on?

152
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,698
Chief! These are blood samples
from ward 21A.

153
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,515
Gosh, seriously those punks.

154
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:43,219
What are we? Criminals?

155
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:47,179
I've set aside half of the blood
you withdrew in another place.

156
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,777
Please pass it along to Joo Hyun Woo.

157
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:50,471
I will. Thank you.

158
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,120
But, will you be okay?

159
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,034
You've made a mess out of ward 21A.

160
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:58,452
This would never have been solved
by being a gentlemen.

161
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:01,024
We should have done this to begin with.

162
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:02,764
If it weren't for my uncle back then...

163
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:04,922
That's true.

164
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,162
And I wouldn't have been
embarrassed that wench Suh Hye Ri.

165
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:10,876
I'm sure you know this,
but please handle this with care.

166
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:13,575
Yes. I'll take special care and
handle it well.

167
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:16,787
You need pay special attention and
handle it with care too. Okay?

168
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:20,845
Wait now, it seems like you all know
something.

169
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:24,143
I feel like I'm slightly out of the loop.

170
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:30,214
There is something, isn't there...
something only I don't know!

171
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:35,389
Wow... I have never seen you
enter without knocking, Director.

172
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:42,538
Please return the blood samples
that you took.

173
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:44,905
Oh dear. What should we do, Director?

174
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:47,251
It's already being processed
in the machine.

175
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:49,766
It is not something you people
should handle so...

176
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,036
It's not something we should handle
so carelessly?

177
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:03,227
Why don't we talk... Chief Park Ji Sang?

178
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:21,644
I didn't realize you'd behave so
brashly and thoughtlessly, Chief.

179
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:26,873
Using your skills as a infected on
human beings is not right.

180
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,863
Actually, I am quite the fighter.

181
00:17:28,863 --> 00:17:33,203
It wasn't necessary for me to use
my skills as an infected.

182
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:36,666
It seems like you've become
free of burdens, lately.

183
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:39,997
I had thought you were a very
troubled person.

184
00:17:39,997 --> 00:17:42,977
At that time, I had something to fear.

185
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:45,156
So, I felt anxiety about it.

186
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:48,862
But now,
I have no reason for any of that.

187
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,616
Why did you do something like this today?

188
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:56,856
You're utilizing our virus for
this research.

189
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:59,536
So, I became very curious about it.

190
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:04,566
If this becomes public to the world,
do you realize what would happen?

191
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:09,016
That won't happen.
It will stay within that group only.

192
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:13,204
I have nothing to gain from telling
everyone about this either.

193
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,516
It will be for our eyes only.

194
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:19,937
What would change if you all saw it?

195
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:24,599
We would get to figure out why
this research is falling apart.

196
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:33,183
You are always quite pessimistic.

197
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:36,653
It's not that I'm pessimistic,
I'm just being honest.

198
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,419
On top of that, I suppose we'll find out
just how talented you are, Director.

199
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,598
If you're not up for it,
should we just stop now?

200
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:48,085
No, why don't you give it a go?

201
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:52,193
I'd like to hear a more objective
assessment of my talents.

202
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:53,531
Thank you.

203
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:16,879
<i>[Death Certificate]</i>

204
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:18,993
<i>[Employee Information Card]</i>

205
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:21,622
<i>Suh Hye Ri's place of residence is clean.</i>

206
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:24,002
<i>And her car is still parked in her
parking lot.</i>

207
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:28,461
<i>By looking at her closet and make up,
it's clear that she packed luggage.</i>

208
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,745
<i>However, I can't seem to locate her.</i>

209
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:34,155
<i>Her cell phone has been shut down,
as well.</i>

210
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,390
Stop the investigation for now.
I have something else in mind.

211
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:56,265
<i>If you truly mean that and
you are sincere...</i>

212
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,227
I hope you and I are alike.

213
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:02,520
<i>I hope you will not be swayed or
influenced by what's around you.</i>

214
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,302
<i>And stay true to your convictions.</i>

215
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:09,573
Those convictions should be displayed
by your loyal actions.

216
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,120
Sis.

217
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,750
Hey, Soo Yun.

218
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,790
I have a favor to ask you.

219
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,290
What kind of favor?

220
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,550
You're seriously not leaving?

221
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,540
You can't see the results.

222
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,920
The results are from the tests I ordered.

223
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,710
It's not allowed. Never.

224
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,000
What is this?
Any Joe Schmoe has a say now?

225
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,670
Do not move.

226
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,500
Get the results.

227
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,000
I said... do not move.

228
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,580
What...

229
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,610
Get out.

230
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,020
I can't leave.

231
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,290
Whether we give it to you or not,
you won't be able to leave with it.

232
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,050
Yes, Director.

233
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,460
Yes, sir.

234
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,570
Shouldn't you show them to your seniors first? You're reading them first?

235
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,220
Hey!

236
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,050
It's really true they exist, right?
Right?

237
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,950
You should know since you saw
the test results.

238
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,300
Then if you get infected with VBT-01...

239
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,020
you become a vampire, right?

240
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,040
I guess?

241
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,130
What you tested today was made into
vaccines, so it probably won't work.

242
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,110
In any case, you really need to
keep this a secret.

243
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,840
This is a huge deal, for real.

244
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,880
Okay, I get it. But if...

245
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,150
this virus does exist in real life...

246
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:27,110
Maybe Chief Park Ji Sang is
infected, as well?

247
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,910
I keep having these suspicions.

248
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,280
No way! You're going overboard again.

249
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,430
I'm going to find out. For sure.

250
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,140
Hey, why do you need to find out
about that? Why?

251
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,190
Why are you getting angry?

252
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,280
I mean you two are acting
beyond suspicious.

253
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,750
Now that you guys live together...

254
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,600
Hm, is it nice? Hm?

255
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,640
We're not living together.
Careful what you say!

256
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,140
Well, you guys are living together.
What else would you call it?

257
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,140
I think something happened?
The hospital's been noisy.

258
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,150
I think so...

259
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,080
You shouldn't worry about it.

260
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,430
Honey, the drugs must be quite potent.

261
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,340
It gives me quite a bit of mood swings.

262
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,810
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I understand.

263
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,230
Your progress alone makes
things okay for me.

264
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,050
Thank you.

265
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,360
Rest while they are waiting
on the test results.

266
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,570
Dad.

267
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,220
Yes, Soo Yun?

268
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,870
I wrote a letter for you.
To encourage you.

269
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,170
You did?

270
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,000
I didn't have any nice letter paper and
envelope, so I just wrote it here.

271
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,060
She gave me the paper.

272
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,430
Here you go, Dad.

273
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,670
Wait! You can't read it out aloud.

274
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,220
Oh!

275
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,540
Sorry Dad!

276
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,880
Honey!

277
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,350
Dad...

278
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,060
Are you okay Soo Yun?

279
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,710
Soo Yun...

280
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,250
Soo Yun...

281
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,920
Soo Yun?

282
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,100
Choi Woo Shik got the third round of
vaccine, right?

283
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,120
Yes.

284
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,440
Tell me the truth.

285
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,950
About what?

286
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,420
It's not the same vaccine that
I know about, right?

287
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,440
I said to tell me the truth.

288
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,060
I don't think I need to report to you?

289
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,420
Just because Director values you, it
doesn't mean I should do the same.

290
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Please refrain from touching me
from now on.

291
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,330
As you can see, these are the results.

292
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,750
I mean, what were they thinking?

293
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,040
Oh, yeah.

294
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,860
There's a patient named
Lee Na Jung, right?

295
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,260
Yes, a child.

296
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,530
She doesn't have anything. She's clean.

297
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,460
I guess they left her alone since she's
still a kid. Thankfully.

298
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,820
According to the analysis, it looks like
the vaccine is embedded in the serum.

299
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,930
Is combining like that possible?
I mean medically.

300
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,190
VBT-01 makes it possible.

301
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,700
What is it?

302
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,950
I want to know more about the vaccine
used for the third round.

303
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,950
Why all of a sudden?

304
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,490
It seems to be different than
what I know.

305
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,500
That's right.

306
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,010
It's much improved than the version
you know.

307
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,940
Can you tell me more in detail?

308
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,650
Simply, it's a hybrid of immune serum
and vaccine.

309
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,380
The immune serum increases the immunity
as expected.

310
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,340
But, the vaccine structure and
its level is off.

311
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,860
It could be live vaccine, but still...

312
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,260
VBT-01 subcultures were minimized.

313
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,230
What do you mean?

314
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,250
It's not really a vaccine.
It's in a state similar to the infection.

315
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,250
If it's in a similar state
as the infection...

316
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,650
If its balance with the immune serum breaks,
you can immediately become infected.

317
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,120
And the infected can infect others.

318
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,276
Of course.

319
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:01,474
Right now, that balance is a
serious problem.

320
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:03,435
It's too unstable.

321
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:12,135
Why is your expression like that?

322
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:15,665
Isn't vaccine with minimized subcultures
our last resort?

323
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:20,504
If the top method is the best method,
then there's nothing wrong using it now.

324
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,680
Is something wrong?

325
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:32,140
No, it's not that. I was just curious.

326
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:37,861
It seems like you're asking
many questions lately.

327
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:41,728
I'm sorry.

328
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,051
Doctor...

329
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,325
I want to ask you once more.

330
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:53,006
Please make sure Na Jung
is not used as a research subject.

331
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,219
Okay, I'll do that.

332
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:00,264
Ga Yeon.

333
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:06,241
I hope you do not become
a weakness for me.

334
00:29:07,983 --> 00:29:12,612
If you become my weakness,
it would be a very fatal one.

335
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,696
I will keep that in mind.

336
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,489
- Have you all gathered?
- Yes.

337
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:07,006
Make sure they are medicate themselves
with the compound and hide their true form.

338
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,729
Yes, Doctor.

339
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:27,412
Hey!

340
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:32,356
Who told you,
you could leave the hospital? Huh?

341
00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:34,455
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

342
00:30:34,455 --> 00:30:36,718
All the orders all a mess
because of you.

343
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:39,318
I'm sorry.
I'll start my shift right away.

344
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:41,279
Don't just say it...

345
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,069
Sir, I'll take care of it.

346
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:47,073
Gosh, seriously!

347
00:30:52,013 --> 00:30:55,029
If you're heading out,
you should have told me.

348
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:56,407
I'm sorry.

349
00:30:56,407 --> 00:31:01,153
I don't know about him,
but you can talk to me.

350
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:02,287
Yes, sir.

351
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:05,363
Okay. Get changed and come to ICU.

352
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,585
Yes.

353
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,250
A night stroll for the first time
in a long time. How refreshing.

354
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,990
You had a lot to manage today.

355
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,450
Making appearances here and there.

356
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,290
Although the outcome is serious.

357
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,750
Oh, what's with him?
Why do you keep smiling?

358
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,360
Because I remembered something
all of a sudden.

359
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,480
When I first came to work here,
you and your LA-style makeup.

360
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,020
Gosh, seriously.

361
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,920
Why are you bringing that up?
Don't do that.

362
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,450
Okay.

363
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,030
- I said stop it!
- Okay.

364
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,790
Honey...

365
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,150
Guess where I am!

366
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,080
Honey! I don't know where you are.

367
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,620
Where are you hiding?

368
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,180
I'm right here!

369
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,340
You're so mischievous.

370
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,570
This place is full of flowers so
I couldn't find you.

371
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,350
Oh, I don't know about that...
Let's go.

372
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,680
What the heck was that?

373
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,200
Shall we do it too? For fun?

374
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,890
Don't even think about it.

375
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,160
Just once... As a joke. It's for fun.

376
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,900
Even if it's a joke, I won't. I can't!

377
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,500
I said, don't do it...

378
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,180
Guess where I am!

379
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,510
Right there.

380
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:57,140
Goodness, you should pretend to not know
like that other guy.

381
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,300
How can I pretend?

382
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,870
When there's a talking flower...

383
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,920
Oh, ugh, he is crazy.

384
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,300
What are you going to do with my hand?
Shriveled from corniness.

385
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,300
I can straighten it for you.

386
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,220
If it's all straightened out,
I can let go.

387
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,710
No, it'll take a while.

388
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,440
<i>[32.2]</i>

389
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,060
Reset the CCTV recording right away.
Now!

390
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,820
Make sure the guards don't talk.

391
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,680
Do you have hormone issues or something?

392
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,180
You shed so much hair.

393
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,680
It's like that for all girls with
long hair.

394
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,190
You never dated a girl with long hair?

395
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,240
Nope.

396
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,820
- Then what about girls with short hair?
- Never dated them.

397
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,130
- Then what about medium-length hair?
- Never dated them.

398
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,030
Then you never dated a girl?

399
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,150
When an infected feels love,
the pituitary gland

400
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,440
over-produces phenethylamine and
oxytocin and it can be harmful.

401
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,850
And regulating emotions and cravings
become difficult.

402
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,400
Oh, I see.

403
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:27,840
But, when you were close to me and

404
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,660
when you held my hand before...

405
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,560
Were you okay?

406
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,870
You seemed fine on the outside.

407
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,600
I guess there wasn't much stimulation.

408
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,500
Oh...

409
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,180
I guess I just invoke loyalty, friendship,
colleague-ship or something like that.

410
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,000
There's an exception.

411
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,450
I didn't know this before.
I recently realized.

412
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,520
Even if the pituitary gland is
significantly stimulated...

413
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,450
if the other part gets stimulated more,
it makes things okay.

414
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,450
Where is the other part?

415
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,590
Here.

416
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,840
For me, it's here.

417
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,600
Let me conduct the experiment to
finalize my findings.

418
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,950
You're nervous.

419
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,470
I think I'll be okay.
In the future, too.

420
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,490
All this seems unreal... With you.

421
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,940
I feel the same way.

422
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,870
Seriously, every timings in the world
must be cursed.

423
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,950
Yeah.

424
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,450
What?

425
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,180
I'm sorry, Director.

426
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,400
I had no choice.

427
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,390
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?

428
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,650
It'll be okay.

429
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,580
Doesn't make sense.

430
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,910
There was no reason for suicide.

431
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,100
It makes no sense.

432
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,660
- Are you the one in charge here?
- Yes.

433
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,980
There wasn't a note or a letter,
but it's likely a suicide.

434
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,460
He is not the type!

435
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,520
He was a very cheerful person.

436
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,370
If there's anything else,
I'll give you a call.

437
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,410
Really, there wasn't anything
going on, right?

438
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,880
Yes.

439
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:21,230
When I last saw him,
he was smiling brightly.

440
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,420
There's something more, right?

441
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,150
I sensed a subtle smell of an infected.

442
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:20,280
Does that mean an infected came all the
way here to hurt Byung Soo?

443
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,060
Why Byung Soo?

444
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,990
I don't know either.

445
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:29,040
But, if a person unrelated to the
infection got killed by an infected...

446
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,800
there's only one reason.

447
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:36,250
By chance, unintentionally,
he must've learned their secret.

448
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,690
Just who was it that
did something like this?

449
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,010
The only thing we're sure of...

450
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:20,940
seeing how the smell was hard to detect,
it's an infected that uses that compound.

451
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,940
There's too much happening all at once.
I don't know what's going on.

452
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,820
The only other infected within
the hospital is the Director, right?

453
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,590
It could be someone from the outside.

454
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,230
Breaking in would be simple.

455
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:38,020
Whether it's external or internal,
there's too much exposure to danger.

456
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,520
To the general public, that is.

457
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,130
You're right. If we leave things be,
we'll have bystanders become victims.

458
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,530
The body temperature compound.

459
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,740
What about it?

460
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,910
The infected that take this compound...

461
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:59,460
I'm wondering if there is a way to
identify them.

462
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,910
Identify them?

463
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,550
Perhaps this compound...

464
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,950
might have a reaction with
other unique compound materials.

465
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,370
That's true.

466
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,090
I wonder why I didn't think of that.

467
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,210
How could something like this happen?

468
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,190
- Suicide?
- I'm sorry, Chairman.

469
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm making sure something like
this doesn't happen again.

470
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,920
Taemin cannot afford to have
even a small flaw.

471
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,430
Yes.

472
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,570
What about the police and the media?

473
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:37,330
For the police,
I spoken to Chief Lee Yoon Seok.

474
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,370
As for the media,
they've already been blocked.

475
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,660
Okay. Good job.
You can head out now.

476
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,010
Director, I need to speak with you
for a moment.

477
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,080
I'm sorry. I need to head into surgery.

478
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,920
Oh I see. Then, I'll wait for you.

479
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,270
Wow! Your weight has gone up
and your blood pressure improved.

480
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,370
Everything's good.

481
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,520
At this rate,
you can get surgery next week.

482
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,010
Oh... I don't like surgery!

483
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:21,030
Once you get surgery,
you'll be better soon.

484
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:21,980
Okay?

485
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,980
What?
You always make my life so difficult.

486
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,800
I was going to say this next week,
but I'll just say it now.

487
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,580
Please take good care of Na Jung.

488
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,610
It feels like you're her family.

489
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:42,180
Well, she feels like my little sister.

490
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,170
I'll take good care of her until
the surgery.

491
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,000
Okay.
Don't neglect the other patient's though.

492
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,060
Okay.

493
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,690
What are you looking at?

494
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,940
I was really disappointed by it.

495
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,050
Which part of it disappointed you?

496
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,900
The immune serum was very roughly
put together.

497
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,920
How could someone as smart as you
get the golden goose

498
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,840
and cut it open?

499
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,450
Are you talking about minimized subcultures?

500
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,090
So you know what I'm talking about.

501
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,540
You knew and you still took it out?

502
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,830
In my judgment,
now was the time.

503
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,330
I find your judgment very regretful.

504
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,360
Since it's already been made,
good luck with that.

505
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,810
To put in other words,
it's like a team that's losing 20-1...

506
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,390
having to watch the other team on
the offense in the 9th inning.

507
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,360
- Chief.
- Yes?

508
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,500
It really does seem like you
have no fear.

509
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,230
Of course.
You really didn't have to go that far.

510
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:19,340
It would've been great if your
parents lived longer.

511
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:26,300
If they did, they would've taught you
how to have fear and manners.

512
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,280
How to have fear and manners...
You can keep at it.

513
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,370
Just be mindful of the counterpart.

514
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,110
I have a request, Director.

515
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:50,520
Even if the vaccine is not fully developed,
can I get it administered?

516
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,420
That's not possible.
It can cause a bigger problem.

517
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,910
That's fine. Anything is better than now,
don't you think?

518
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:58,990
I can't, Chairman.

519
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,390
Why is it not possible when I myself
want it?

520
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:06,580
This research was funded with my money.
So do as I ask!

521
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:11,430
Chairman. Please calm down.

522
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,330
I'm sorry.

523
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,730
I got too worked up.

524
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,400
I told you we are almost there.

525
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,150
Why aren't you listening to me?

526
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,930
Never let your frets cause foolishness.

527
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,600
Please don't forget, Chairman.

528
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,840
Doctor!

529
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,560
Oh, Ri Ta!

530
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,850
Wow, how long has it been?

531
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,210
I know, right? What brings you by?

532
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,710
I had a meeting with Doctor Park Do Min.

533
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,910
You can't just leave like this.

534
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,030
You should meet me or Associate Director.

535
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,360
Why... would I bother busy people?

536
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:21,820
Still... I actually had some questions
about my uncle.

537
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:26,070
Oh, you do? Did Associate Director
tell you everything?

538
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,690
- About what?
- Oh.

539
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,080
She didn't tell you?

540
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:45,240
If the Chairman comes asking to be vaccinated,
don't respond and call me right away.

541
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,280
Okay, will do.

542
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,530
But...

543
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,320
Weren't the patients in 21A injected with
the vaccine even though it's unstable?

544
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,950
Still, we can't to Chairman.

545
00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:02,380
If he experiences adverse effects, we may
not be able to continue our research.

546
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,760
I understand what you're saying.

547
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,160
Chief, the data you gave me...

548
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,040
More specifically, VTH-16.

549
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,940
- Yes.
- It's truly amazing.

550
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,970
How you were able to develop such
an antibody.

551
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,130
Hyun Woo put in a lot of effort.

552
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,930
I see.

553
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:32,750
But, as you know, it's a very dangerous
immune antibody.

554
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:37,390
It'll kill off not only virus cells, but
healthy cells as well.

555
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:42,070
Additionally, I ran some reaction tests
with blood from 21A.

556
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:44,170
It was fatal as well.

557
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:48,240
The fact that we couldn't figure out why
was the reason for ending the research.

558
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,050
It won't be easy to find the cause.

559
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:54,310
Perhaps impossible.

560
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:59,970
I, too, re-opened the research many times,
hoping for results, but it always failed.

561
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:04,140
But, I will continue with this.

562
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,070
I will hold my ground with my will.

563
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,910
You should do that then.

564
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:15,740
Oh, how's your passive aggressive
war with Director going?

565
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,950
It's going well.

566
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,620
That's good to hear.

567
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,090
But, don't you think we need to
provoke him with something more?

568
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,440
Yes, I think so.

569
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,300
Aunt, your skin isn't looking
too healthy.

570
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,460
I have too many concerns.

571
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,470
I also need to wrap up acquisition
of Hanche Hotel.

572
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,380
Oh, right, did Uncle get a
physical examination?

573
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,830
That... he asked me to not say
anything to you.

574
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,120
He did get one.

575
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,390
When?

576
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:06,860
Last week at Sung Won Hospital.
He didn't want Taemin people to worry.

577
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,030
What about the results?

578
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:15,400
His glucose level increased a bit,
but he's okay.

579
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,200
I see.

580
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,820
That's a relief.

581
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,820
I was concerned about his hand tremors.

582
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,820
That's also because of his glucose level.

583
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,590
Okay.

584
00:54:30,591 --> 00:54:32,861
You have to pretend not to know.

585
00:54:32,861 --> 00:54:36,240
If you tell him,
I'll lose credit with the Chairman.

586
00:54:37,538 --> 00:54:39,458
Okay, I'll do that.

587
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:33,345
Doctor Yoo.

588
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:38,519
- Yes?
- Is something wrong?

589
00:55:40,175 --> 00:55:42,271
No, you should go back to work.

590
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:59,105
<i>I'm sorry. I should have told you too.</i>

591
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:03,161
She said it could be a problem at
the next shareholder's meetings.

592
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:05,561
The Associate Director was concerned.

593
00:56:06,189 --> 00:56:09,738
She said we should prepare in advance,
so I told her about it.

594
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:14,417
I thought she would tell you herself.

595
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:16,747
She must have kept it from you
to keep you from worrying.

596
00:56:16,747 --> 00:56:18,119
Yes.

597
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,232
That must have been why.

598
00:56:22,787 --> 00:56:24,405
But, Doctor...

599
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:27,182
the rare illness my uncle has?

600
00:56:28,898 --> 00:56:33,064
As of now,
is there no chance for recovery?

601
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:36,629
Right now, that's how it is.

602
00:56:42,885 --> 00:56:44,968
And one more thing.

603
00:56:45,689 --> 00:56:48,650
Is this a hereditary illness?

604
00:56:49,444 --> 00:56:52,614
For you, there's a 50:50 chance.

605
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,021
Your father was fine.

606
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,970
But, that doesn't mean you will be safe.

607
00:57:11,256 --> 00:57:13,405
I saw your composition.

608
00:57:13,946 --> 00:57:16,396
Why don't we evaluate it together?

609
00:57:28,868 --> 00:57:31,098
I thought it was really a bomb.

610
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:37,727
Wow. You're coming off extreme
right off the bat.

611
00:57:37,727 --> 00:57:41,538
It's quite the antibody.
It eats up everything it touches.

612
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:44,498
- Does it have a name?
- Vampire to human.

613
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:48,882
VTH, the 16th version.

614
00:57:49,649 --> 00:57:52,629
I like the meaning.  Anyways...

615
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,635
What's your reason for showing this
to me?

616
00:57:54,635 --> 00:57:55,756
I thought you'd need it.

617
00:57:55,756 --> 00:57:57,213
- Me?
- Yes.

618
00:57:58,338 --> 00:58:00,297
You have a hypothetical situation.

619
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:03,942
If infection spreads through a region
because your treatment fails...

620
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:06,532
that region should be bombarded.

621
00:58:07,748 --> 00:58:10,453
When you do attack,
you should use this.

622
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:11,577
I don't know.

623
00:58:11,577 --> 00:58:14,229
No matter how much I think about it,
I don't think I'll need it.

624
00:58:14,252 --> 00:58:17,654
Not enough time has passed
for you to make that judgment.

625
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,091
I'll give you more time.

626
00:58:24,507 --> 00:58:27,747
I miss the days when we first met.

627
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:31,472
We were very polite with one another.

628
00:58:31,472 --> 00:58:33,215
And we respected each other.

629
00:58:33,215 --> 00:58:35,393
I like things much better, right now.

630
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:40,878
Also, you keep insisting that your
research is perfect.

631
00:58:41,511 --> 00:58:43,581
I'm telling you, it's not.

632
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:48,152
So why did your team disperse like that?

633
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:53,237
If you had stayed with Doctor Jung
and your friends...

634
00:58:53,237 --> 00:58:55,547
you would have succeeded by now.

635
00:58:56,526 --> 00:59:00,087
Oh... I see.

636
00:59:00,087 --> 00:59:04,176
You couldn't bring it up to them
because of pride.

637
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:05,898
'Let's work together.'

638
00:59:08,525 --> 00:59:10,462
I'm more than enough on my own.

639
00:59:10,462 --> 00:59:13,886
Throw away your pride
and just say it.

640
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:17,572
Then, at least, I will help you out.

641
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:21,100
What is it?

642
00:59:21,484 --> 00:59:24,757
Does it hurt your pride to ask me?

643
00:59:27,271 --> 00:59:31,519
Or... is it not a matter of pride?

644
00:59:32,628 --> 00:59:34,078
Did you perhaps...

645
00:59:34,078 --> 00:59:38,180
not get recognition from your
mentor and your friends?

646
00:59:38,983 --> 00:59:40,612
Is that really it?

647
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:45,619
Or...

648
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:49,569
Let's see... did everyone say
it couldn't be done.

649
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:53,587
But, you behaved recklessly and
dangerously...

650
00:59:55,872 --> 00:59:58,202
and pushed forward on your own?

651
00:59:58,202 --> 01:00:00,002
- Shut up.
- Well now.

652
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:02,087
Why are you acting scary like this?

653
01:00:03,738 --> 01:00:06,642
What do you know to talk so carelessly
in front of me?

654
01:00:06,642 --> 01:00:08,139
I'm talking because I know something.

655
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:12,392
I made the right call.
Everyone was scared without even trying.

656
01:00:13,206 --> 01:00:15,866
An individuals' fear nearly threw
everything down the drain.

657
01:00:15,866 --> 01:00:21,338
Wasn't it your greed that you ignored your friends and mentor's conscience?

658
01:00:21,338 --> 01:00:23,826
They were perfectly wrong and
they were cowards.

659
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:26,829
They never had any right to
have this to begin with.

660
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:30,620
So, they were cowards who were wrong.

661
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,961
And they had no right,
so you must have really hated them.

662
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:34,765
Don't talk to me in that way.

663
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:39,818
And that's what's made you think of
having it all to yourself.

664
01:00:39,818 --> 01:00:41,463
I told you not to talk to me that way!

665
01:00:41,463 --> 01:00:43,836
Is that why you killed them?
My parents and everyone!

666
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:47,468
That's right! I killed them!
I ordered them killed! It was me!

667
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:23,471
You didn't forget everything I said,
did you?

668
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,855
Whatever it is, show me everything.
I'll look at it for now and enjoy it.

669
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:30,067
You take pleasure in giving
pain to the patients.

670
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:32,187
And on top of that,
you murdered someone!

671
01:01:32,187 --> 01:01:33,770
This is the last time.

672
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:36,362
The last time the Director's affection's
for you gets you special treatment.

673
01:01:36,362 --> 01:01:40,154
You... I'll kill you very soon.

674
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,789
You say I've been bitten by a dog.

675
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:44,832
How would I stop a dog?

676
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:46,915
I've found the real reason.

677
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:49,924
I want to love with a human's heart.
