1
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,961
Did you hear?

2
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,405
What?

3
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,130
He's close by.

4
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,433
Who?

5
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,974
The coffin man!

6
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,101
Coffin?

7
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,610
The coffin that grants your wishes!

8
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,942
Does it really grant wishes?

9
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,607
Yeah.

10
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,742
He kills people for a hobby...

11
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,514
...and once, he declared war on his
own and destroyed an entire country.

12
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:16,856
By himself?

13
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,880
<i>That's right.</i>
By himself?

14
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,452
He uses a gun

15
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,153
What does he look like?

16
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,694
I've heard he's more than ten
times the average man's height.

17
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,461
Isn't that too big?

18
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:37,367
He's probably not human.

19
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,675
He's a monster.

20
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,307
Really?

21
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:48,554
He has a child with him, but I've
heard that's just for him to eat.

22
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:54,420
Inside the coffin are all the
heads of the people he killed.

23
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,729
I thought the coffin could grant wishes.

24
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,560
No, that's wrong.
There are treasures inside.

25
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,598
Treasures?

26
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,532
Anyway, it's just him.

27
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:10,204
Doesn't it mean we have luck on our
side with the coffin out of the temple?

28
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,101
Archbishop!

29
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,976
Are you all right?
What happened here?

30
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,841
The coffin...

31
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,276
Coffin?

32
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,875
Who took the coffin?

33
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,508
Who were they?

34
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,285
It was one man...

35
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,721
One man?

36
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,284
Don't tell me just one
man took the coffin!

37
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,090
Yes, he did...

38
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:51,971
When the seal of the coffin has been
broken, the end of the world will come.

39
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,380
He must be stopped at any cost.

40
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,077
Go. Pursue the man.

41
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,696
You got anything to eat?

42
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,492
Ye<i>s</i>, <i>sir.</i>
You got anything to eat?

43
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,031
Give me all you've got.

44
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,362
Ye<i>s</i>, <i>sir.</i>
Give me all you've got.

45
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,300
Oh, and that one, too.

46
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,552
Give me your strongest stuff.

47
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,222
Oh, maybe it's that way...

48
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,788
You're the monk from the East Temple?

49
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,292
Where's the coffin?

50
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,317
Can't you speak?

51
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,671
I hate monks.

52
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,599
Die.

53
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,924
Need some help?

54
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,674
Before you run away, tell me...

55
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:24,973
W-What?

56
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,745
Have you seen a man dragging
a coffin around here?

57
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,613
I-I don't know!

58
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,782
Bull's eye.

59
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,898
I thank you for saving my life but...

60
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,066
I don't approve of your
meaningless killings.

61
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,799
Killings?

62
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,242
You can only say that
while you're alive.

63
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,815
You're looking for the
coffin guy, too, right?

64
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,350
Be careful.

65
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:50,226
People around here hate monks.

66
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,394
Why?

67
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,701
Those who went to the East Temple
to rob the coffin never came back.

68
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,630
I heard that the monks killed them
and turned them into stone statues.

69
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,865
Isn't that considered killing?

70
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:09,471
It is to protect the coffin.

71
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,880
Protecting the coffin is important
enough to make monks kill, huh?

72
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,357
By the way...

73
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,603
I gotta say you're one sorry
wimp for a monk from that temple.

74
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,606
That's not true.

75
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,708
Why are you mad?

76
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,810
I am not.

77
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,334
<i>Ar</i>e <i>too.</i>
I am not.

78
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:42,504
I'm sorry.

79
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,588
Where did you get that coffin?

80
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,890
Is he THE coffin guy?

81
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,364
Did you get that from the East Temple?

82
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,871
He doesn't look so tough.

83
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:22,954
You got a problem?

84
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,614
What are you gonna do about it?

85
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:22,977
Our temple has been protecting that
coffin for over a hundred years.

86
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:28,055
Many tried to get their
hands on the coffin...

87
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,692
...but no one ever took
it out of the temple...

88
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,056
Until that man showed up...

89
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,199
Um, excuse me...
Are you listening?

90
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,836
Are you listening?

91
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,881
I don't know what you're talking about.

92
00:20:56,488 --> 00:21:00,185
I'm also after the coffin.

93
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,817
Makes me want to thank that man for
dragging the coffin...

94
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,360
...from that invulnerable temple.

95
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,172
All I need to do now is to kill him.

96
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,773
Why do you seek the coffin?

97
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,683
Don't act like you don't know anything.

98
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:36,189
That coffin grants you all your wishes.

99
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,919
Everybody knows that.

100
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,588
That's...

101
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,568
My mission is to take the
coffin back to the temple.

102
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,939
What can a monk like you possibly do?

103
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:18,435
To rob the coffin all by himself?

104
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,435
He must be very strong.

105
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,100
I wonder what he looks like.

106
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,308
During my travels,
I heard rumors that...

107
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,446
...he was three times the
height of a man, enjoys...

108
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,416
Oh, I'm sorry. Go on.

109
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:41,455
He enjoys killing people and
is a monster that eats children.

110
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,351
What's so funny?

111
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,622
You can't be serious.

112
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,822
Are you trying to scare me or
something?

113
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,297
You can say that because
you haven't seen him.

114
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,767
Have you seen him?

115
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:56,931
No.

116
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,774
Let me tell you something.

117
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,983
It's not about the coffin man...

118
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,688
...but there lives a monster in
the forbidden forest in the west.

119
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,523
But nobody's ever seen him.

120
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,626
Just like your temple,
nobody's lived to tell about it.

121
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,109
Let's play...

122
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,537
Let's play...

123
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,510
Let's play...

124
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,084
Let's play...

125
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,422
Let's play...

126
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,190
What is this?

127
00:24:56,094 --> 00:25:01,225
Take this sword and pursue the man!

128
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,734
I can't use a sword!

129
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,697
Besides, I'm just an apprentice monk.
I am not suited...

130
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,169
...for such an
important duty.

131
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:15,405
If you cannot use the sword,
look for the one who can.

132
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:23,012
The one who is chosen by the sword,
the one who can stop the destruction!

133
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,849
Find him!

134
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,731
That's some strange looking
sword you have there.

135
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,793
Let me see.

136
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:00,682
I can't draw it. It's useless!

137
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,917
Um, can you tell me where we're
heading?

138
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,818
I thought we're looking for
the coffin man, aren't we?

139
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,055
Will you be quiet?

140
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,956
I'm sorry...

141
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:20,166
We're heading to the forbidden forest in
the west to find the coffin, of course...

142
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,135
The forbidden forest in the west?

143
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,540
Wishes are granted if
you take the coffin there.

144
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,806
Your wishes will not be granted...

145
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,944
What's wrong with you?

146
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,053
Why do you have to ruin
someone's dream like that?

147
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,157
You know what's really
inside that coffin, don't you?

148
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,454
You don't want to tell me, huh?

149
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,399
...in that case I
won't ask you anymore...

150
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,399
...but I am going to
get that coffin from him!

151
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:54,560
Can you really do that?

152
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,207
I'm doing it because I believe I can.

153
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,173
If you have any doubts,
then go back to your temple!

154
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,334
When did you...

155
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,838
Please give it back!

156
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,311
Do you know what this sword is?

157
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,477
That is something that our
temple has had for generations.

158
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:56,120
Give it back!

159
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,747
<i>If you don't know what this sword is...</i>
Give it back!

160
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,888
...it's useless.

161
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,896
You can't unsheathe this sword, can
you?

162
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,437
I will borrow this sword.

163
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,801
You won't be needing it yet.

164
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,170
Give it back!

165
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:05,881
Hey.

166
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,876
Wait, wait!

167
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,504
Please hold on a minute!

168
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,173
I'm not your enemy.

169
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,980
I'm looking for the man with a coffin.

170
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,359
Please wait.

171
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,795
He's a cruel, barbaric, vicious
man looking like a monster.

172
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,423
Have you seen him?

173
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,629
Monster?

174
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,571
Is he powerful?

175
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,173
Yes.

176
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,637
He might not even be human.

177
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,107
Where is he?

178
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:21,215
I'm looking for him, I
don't know where he is.

179
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,015
Well then, let me
know when you find him.

180
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,521
I'll take him on.

181
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,537
Excuse me...

182
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,979
Help me look for it!

183
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,316
What are you looking for?

184
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:55,910
A coffin.

185
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,412
A coffin?

186
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,821
Hey. You gonna keep following me?

187
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,557
Didn't you hear me?

188
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,963
It's annoying. Get lost!

189
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,909
Did you really steal the
coffin from the temple?

190
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,085
You.

191
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,362
You have anything to eat?

192
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,564
Food!

193
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:53,665
N-No...

194
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:54,572
You're lying.

195
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:55,766
No.
Y<i>ou'r</i>e <i>lying.</i>

196
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,505
I'm so hungry.

197
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:12,380
If you're the coffin man,
how did you lose the coffin?

198
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,189
Did somebody steal it from you?

199
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,384
I just lost it.

200
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,520
I stole it because I heard
it would grant wishes...

201
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,260
Did you also believe that rumor?

202
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,463
The one where your wishes are
granted if you open the coffin?

203
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,730
But it's not true.

204
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:45,077
A long time ago, there existed a
ferocious goddess in the heavens...

205
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,345
A ferocious goddess?

206
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,686
Is she powerful?

207
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,526
She repeatedly destroyed
and slaughtered...

208
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,961
...and was banished from
the heavens to this world...

209
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,599
Since then, this world
continuously has battles...

210
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:42,172
...because of the conflict
the goddess created.

211
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,468
The Archbishop told me.

212
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:49,705
Conflict provokes another conflict,
and these struggles continue endlessly.

213
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,106
Power is meaningless...
Don't you agree?

214
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,685
W-What did you do that for?

215
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,123
Your stories are too long.

216
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,453
Shut up!

217
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,825
You didn't have to hit me...

218
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,506
You're the one who asked me...

219
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,494
If I destroy this...

220
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,512
What happened?

221
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,618
Was it you? Did you take my coffin?

222
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,928
Why are you smiling?
You're creeping me out.

223
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,530
Since you have that sword...

224
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,964
Why don't you use it?

225
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,470
Sword?

226
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,144
Oh, this?

227
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:39,204
Draw the sword.
Then I'll play with you.

228
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,717
That's great. Let's play.

229
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,578
It's not fun killing when
you're not on top of your game.

230
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,691
I'll give you back the sword.

231
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,169
I guess I wasn't the chosen one.

232
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,631
Are you OK?

233
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,071
I'm hungry...

234
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,144
What?

235
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,745
Give me something to eat...

236
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,519
Who is this guy?

237
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:10,190
Seems to be the coffin
man we were after.

238
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:42,064
Hey, let's play!

239
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,135
Let's play!

240
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,736
Let's play!

241
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,828
Hey, let's play! Come on.

242
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,601
Let's play!

243
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,240
I want to play more! Come on, wake up!

244
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,776
Let's play!

245
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:26,572
<i>Is h</i>e <i>brok</i>e<i>n?</i>
Let's play!

246
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,337
You lose.

247
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,273
It's over.

248
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,208
No good.

249
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:33,815
You're weak.

250
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,386
Let's play more!

251
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,181
He's broken.

252
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,547
He is DONE!

253
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,350
He can't move.

254
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,591
He's done.

255
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:49,490
Shut up.

256
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,873
Are you OK?

257
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,340
Where did she go?

258
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,273
She went to the forest in
the west with the coffin.

259
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,975
Which way is west?

260
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,031
What took you so long?

261
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,675
I was eating.

262
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,277
Excuses? Funny.

263
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,007
Is it?

264
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,380
Don't disappoint me this time.

265
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:55,718
Let's make it grand!

266
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,589
Is that all you've got?

267
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:58,846
I don't need it.

268
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:13,796
You haven't awakened yet.

269
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:22,004
It's not fun killing when
you're not on top of your game.

270
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,172
You can't win yet...

271
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,080
Do you know why?

272
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:37,450
This sword is only to be
drawn by the chosen one...

273
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,154
...which means...

274
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,828
Shut up.

275
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,265
Let's play.

276
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,838
Let's play.

277
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,176
Let's play.

278
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,474
Let's play.

279
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,206
Let's play.

280
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:15,983
Let's play.

281
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,211
Let's play.

282
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,552
Let's play. Let's play.

283
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,779
Let's play.

284
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,619
Let's play.

285
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,621
Let's play.

286
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,097
Let's play.

287
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:10,903

W<i>hi</i>c<i>h kid is it?</i>

297
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,066
We <i>want this kid.</i>

Ye<i>s</i>, <i>l</i>e<i>t's</i> m<i>ak</i>e <i>a trad</i>e.

301
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:43,562
Get down here.

302
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,354
Let's play.

303
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,156
Let's play.

304
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,661
Let's play.

305
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,129
Let's play.

306
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:03,382
Are you OK?

307
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,018
Do I look like OK?

308
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,028
Untie me.

309
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,499
Come on. Hurry up!

310
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,836
That man saved me...

311
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,270
The coffin man?

312
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,706
It's dangerous beyond here...

313
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,146
You should give up.

314
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:35,251
I'm prepared for it.

315
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:40,956
Even if a monk lectures, none of them
will understand what you're saying.

316
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:45,664
That man doesn't understand
what I'm saying either.

317
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,569
Well, I can't go on...

318
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,443
...but if a wish is to be granted...

319
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:09,286
Please revive my daughter...

320
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,661
OK.

321
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,847
It's endless. I guess
it's time to use it...

322
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,810
You're letting me have
some fun, aren't you?

323
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,832
Open the gate! Please, open it!

324
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,920
At last we're here.

325
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,925
What's going on?

326
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,532
Who are you and who is he?

327
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,738
Who is the girl?

328
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,264
What am I supposed to do?

329
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,070
It's the end of the world!

330
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:40,739
You do know, don't you?

331
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,509
Inside the coffin lies...

332
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,648
...the Goddess of Destruction.

333
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:53,053
A long time ago, the Goddess of
Destruction dropped me to this earth.

334
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,864
Destruction is a mere game to her.

335
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:07,107
And the sword chooses the man to
play the game with the Goddess.

336
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:14,015
But he hasn't awakened yet.

337
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,148
It was ludicrous to think
that I could stop him.

338
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:23,356
That's it.

339
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:28,359
He's about to bring the
Goddess of Destruction back to life...

340
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:39,062
A sealed goddess will one
day wake and act up again.

341
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:47,410
A new world starts once
the goddess perishes.

342
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,609
What are you saying?

343
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:04,122
It's too early for you to give up.

344
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,201
Your mission has not yet ended.

345
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:57,983
Stop!

346
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,126
You again.

347
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:11,696
There's the Goddess of
Destruction inside the coffin!

348
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:17,067
If you release the goddess,
this earth will be destroyed!

349
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:18,996
Destroyed?

350
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:22,404
Sounds like fun.

351
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,905
This is my mission!

352
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,088
You can grant any wishes, right?

353
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,756
Then bring me someone who's
the most powerful in this world.

354
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,490
I want to fight.

355
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,204
I exist to destroy.

356
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,375
I can destroy anything you desire.

357
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,043
Then destroy me!

358
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:05,567
My mission...

359
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:09,671
...is not over yet!

360
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,218
Oh great!

361
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:35,567
Did the Goddess of
Destruction go to the heavens?

362
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:39,545
Yes.

363
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:50,121
Is there any hope?

364
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:26,527
He is the hope.
