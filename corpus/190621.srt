00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,600
CINEART

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,520
Dedicated to our fathers and their children

87
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,200
Once upon a time there was a land

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,160
which had as capital Belgrado.

1212
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,680
April, 6th 1941

1
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,360
I'll kill them all, mate!

5
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,360
Watch out!

8
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,040
I'll kill them all!

9
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
It's to dangerous.

10
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,080
Ivan!

11
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,920
Brother!

12
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,080
The vice-president talked

13
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,800
about tightening the relations

14
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,560
between the states of Yugoslavia...

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,400
That's my brother...

16
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,040
and his best friend, Blacky.

17
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,720
Idiots!

18
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
Idiots!

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,360
What can I do?

20
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,400
I don't have anyone else on the world.

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,360
Marko!

22
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,080
Come over and have a cup of coffee.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
I can't, I'm in a hurry!

24
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,320
My friend is tired!

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,800
I'm tired!

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,720
Tomorrow I'll take you out for lunch

27
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,280
in the Russian Czar!

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720
Go back inside!

29
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,040
Vera,

30
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm a free man.

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,640
A free man? Come on.

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,840
Damn!

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,680
Vera, I need to

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,200
tell you something important.

35
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,840
What?
-Don't get mad.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,520
We wrote Petar

37
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,160
in the Communist Party.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,760
You mean in the brothel.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,600
He is now one of us.

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
Inside! -I come.

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,560
A last word to my friend.

42
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,400
I got business to take care of.

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,600
You see what I have to go through.

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,320
Come over here, so I'll kiss you.

45
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,920
Not on the mouth, idiot!

46
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,640
Blacky, inside!

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,640
It's the same thing each morning.

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,480
I'm going to leave you,

49
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,440
just like Marko's wife.

50
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm a free man!

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
Ini Mini Moo...

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,400
First part - The War

53
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,360
A garret

54
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,640
Under the roof

55
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,080
On the wall...

56
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,840
Looloo... breakfast!

57
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,760
On the wall does a clock

58
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,880
Ticktack

59
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,240
A garret

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,960
Under the roof

61
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,600
Does she obey you,

62
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,840
your mother?

63
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Soni!

64
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,720
Yes, that's the way...

65
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,720
Continue...

66
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
It comes...
-Let me go!

67
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,400
Go? You have to come here.

68
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,600
Come back!

69
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,720
Bloody fascist swines.

70
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,720
How can you continue your meal?

71
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,600
I can, don't you see?

72
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,400
How can you, with all these bombs?

73
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,480
Just because.

74
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,560
Do I have to die on an empty stomach?

75
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,800
My shoes!

76
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,880
Don't touch my shoes!

77
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,760
Stupid bastard!

78
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,680
This is the end.

79
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,280
Enough!

80
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,880
My city!

81
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,480
They are bombing my city!

82
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,920
My city!

83
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,200
What are you going to do, Blacky?

84
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,600
I'm going to welcome these criminals

85
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,120
who are distroying my city.

86
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,600
I know where you are going.
-Oh, you do?

87
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,360
I know.

88
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,080
To your whore.

89
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,640
What whore?

90
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,360
You are hallucinating.

91
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,080
Your actrice.
-What actrice?

92
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,800
I'm going to defend my country.

93
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,240
Don't lie!

94
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
You are going to defend your whore!

95
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,400
Impossible to talk with you.

96
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,000
What do you say now?

97
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,880
You are driving me to a nervous breakdown.

98
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,840
I say what everyone says.

99
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,000
Blacky!

100
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,520
Yes, my love? What is it?

101
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,600
You are always at the theatre!

102
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,200
Every night you are at the theatre!

103
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,480
Because I love the theatre.

104
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,440
You love the theatre?

105
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,280
You love the theatre?!

106
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
Is it that strange?

107
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,760
You love your whore, not the theatre!

108
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,400
If you were not pregnant...

109
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,120
What then? You dirty liar!

110
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,120
Me?
-Yes You!

111
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,120
Son of a bitch! Liar!

112
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,960
What? What is it?

113
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,560
You should be ashamed of yourself, Vera.

114
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
Blacky!

115
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,120
What happens?

116
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,640
Don't cry.

117
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,240
I'll build a new zoo for you.

118
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,680
Look.

119
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,000
You, go away!

120
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,000
The animals will eat the survivors.

121
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,760
Here some money for you.

122
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,600
Buy some milk for that little monkey.

123
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,160
Stop crying.

124
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
The germans will laugh with you.

125
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,520
NATIONAL THEATRE

126
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,720
CLEARING WORKS

127
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,640
At work, artists?

128
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,880
You could say so!

129
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,360
Bato, candy.

130
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,040
Uncle Blacky!

131
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,720
Are you afraid of me? Playing is over.

132
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,160
You can be sure about that.

133
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,560
What do you mean?

134
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
You know it very good.

135
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,680
No, really I don't.

136
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,560
Do you want me and Bato

137
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,720
in the working camp?
-What?

138
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,520
The whole city is talking about it.

139
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,360
You are a thief!
- Me?

140
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,960
What are they saying?

141
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,760
Don't act like you know nothing about it.

142
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,800
You are stealing their gold, their money.

143
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,040
Thief!

144
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,160
I steal from the rich...

145
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
what they stole from the poor.

146
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,000
Stop it.
- Stop it also.

147
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,280
At work?

148
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,280
Do you love me?

149
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,720
Yes.

150
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,160
Give me a kiss.

151
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,360
She loves me.

152
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,880
I've been looking for you for days.

153
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,200
I'm scared.

154
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,760
You are getting on my nerves.

155
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,440
You on mine! Did you see this?

156
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
They are looking for you.

157
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Ten thousand!

158
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,320
Is that all? Ridiculous.

159
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,920
Franz!

160
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
Franz?

161
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,760
Fräulein Zovko...

162
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,600
Franz, good morning.

163
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,520
I have been waiting for you.

164
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,400
Our table is waiting

165
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,160
in the Russian Czar.

166
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,400
Yes, and my brother?

167
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,480
Seisenberger, do me a favor...

168
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,680
Take that vehicle and follow us.

169
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,120
But careful!

170
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
Franz...

171
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,640
Ivan, open up!

172
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,120
Stay at the door

173
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,320
and don't move.

174
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,080
Damn, what a smell.

175
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,280
Vera, sit down.

176
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,520
My brother is just like Noach.

177
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,800
He saves the world after the flood.

178
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,080
Don't move and be quiet.

179
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,040
What are you doing?

180
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,920
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

181
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,240
When will you stop trying to hang yourself?

182
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,440
God.

183
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,560
I've had enough

184
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,200
of this life.

185
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,960
Enough? Instead of helping me

186
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,920
and become a hero

187
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,720
you hang yourself like a girlie.

188
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,240
Shame on you.

189
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,000
Message from the Gestapo

190
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,080
to all citizens of Belgrado

191
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,680
and surroundings.

192
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,480
A train with weapons and munition

193
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
has been attacked tonight.

194
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,120
This is the work

195
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,160
of communist bandits.

196
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,760
Petar "Blacky" Popara,

197
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,040
and Marko Dren.

198
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,480
What did you do?

199
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,000
Nothing, we just

200
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,960
hit these thieves a bit.

201
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,400
Marko, good Lord!

202
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,200
What will become of me?

203
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,000
Someone has betrayed us.

204
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,040
A dirty traitor.

205
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,720
Our comrades have been busted.

206
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Do they have Blacky? Busted?

207
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,440
With his balls, yes.

208
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,920
Just like me by the way.

209
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,520
Come on, hurry up!

210
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,040
Why do I have to go?

211
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,440
Because you are my brother.

212
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,560
Leave him!

213
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,080
Come on, children!

214
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,520
No problem. I'm okay.

215
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,680
Who is there?
- It's me, grandpa.

216
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,200
Who is out there?

217
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,840
It's me, Marko.

218
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,680
Who?

219
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,560
Marko, goddammit!

220
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,960
Who?

221
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,760
It's me, Marko! Open up!

222
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,960
Is that you, Marko?
-Yes!

223
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,920
Quick!

224
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,720
The germans can be here any minute.

225
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,560
Go to the cellar,

226
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,520
I'll take care of your stuff.

227
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,720
The cellar is behind the stove.

228
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Let them pass!

229
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,440
What are you doing with these animals?

230
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,160
My cellar is a hideout

231
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,600
for people, not a zoo.

232
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,040
I'll close it off.

233
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,800
Terrible.

234
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,280
Terrible...

235
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,560
Where are you, Blacky?

236
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,080
Son of a bitch.

237
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,440
Yes, it started!

238
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,960
Grandpa!

239
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,000
Marko!

240
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,680
Blacky's wife is about to give birth!

241
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,640
Move!

242
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,920
Fast, please!

243
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,200
Get me some water, a blanket,

244
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,720
and a cloth...

245
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,840
Hurry up, he's coming!

246
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,680
Don't be afraid.

247
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,840
Are you okay?

248
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,600
Yes, but I don't see a thing.

249
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,760
There he is!

250
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,920
Lift the bicycle!

251
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,160
Higher!

252
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,360
Ivan!

253
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,560
I'm not feeling well.

254
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,680
Everything will be allright.

255
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,960
No, I'm feeling terrible.

256
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,880
If something happens with me,

257
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,280
call him Jovan.

258
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,240
Vera!

259
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,040
Three years later

260
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,800
Belgrado was in

261
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,000
a terrible mental state.

262
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,720
Easy, easy

263
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,560
Wild water of the Ibar

264
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,320
Why are you in such a hurry?

265
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
All together!

266
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,360
I'm also

267
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,520
in a lot of grief

268
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,320
More

269
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,040
Then you can imagine...

270
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,280
It's on me!

271
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,480
For the birthday of my son.

272
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,680
Here is my Jovan. Look!

273
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,640
A handsome boy, Blacky. Congratulations.

274
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,000
He will be, Mustafa.

275
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,400
He will study in Moscow

276
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,120
and become an officer,

277
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,680
and not a thief like you, cheat!

278
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,840
We work together,

279
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,760
but how much longer will it last?

280
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,800
Well?

281
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,480
Are the thieves getting nervous?

282
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,960
Mate!

283
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,440
Happy birthday for Jovan,

284
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,240
best friend!

285
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,280
My good old pal!

286
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,720
Look!

287
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,320
Completely my replica.

288
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,320
He has something from Vera too.

289
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,080
Do you think so?
Where were you?

290
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,800
There is a traitor.

291
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,040
We have got problems.

292
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
The three are downstairs.

293
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,440
I've seen it. Don't run away.

294
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,600
Excuse me for waiting.

295
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,040
Good evening.

296
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,960
Please, gentlemen.

297
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm doing this for your own good.

298
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,520
Gentlemen, please...

299
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,040
Franz!

300
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,840
Flowers for Natalija!

301
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,400
He fucks her and kills us.

302
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,520
Excuse me.

303
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,040
Get me a huge bouquet.

304
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,440
Allright.

305
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,280
And the priest?
-I'll fix it.

306
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,640
Great.

307
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,360
Boy...

308
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
there is gonna be a wedding!

309
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,160
Put your cards on the table!

310
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,800
My gun.
Put yours next to mine.

311
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,680
This is fair play!

312
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,840
Here is your gold. You see?

313
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,760
That's the gold, right?

314
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,200
How much do you make with it?

315
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,160
Look!

316
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,320
How much did you get for it?

317
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,160
How much did you get for the gold?

318
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,080
200.000. - 200.000?

319
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,480
Mustafa, you were talking about 120.000.

320
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,680
Tell me where you put the weapons

321
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,440
and we are even.

322
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,280
On my mother's grave,

323
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,240
the germans toke all.

324
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,840
You don't have to swear

325
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,640
on your mother.

326
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,480
Bastard!

327
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,720
Are you stealing my money?

328
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,520
I rob banks

329
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,280
and juwellers,

330
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,320
and you steal from me, mother fuckers!

331
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,040
Filthy thieves!

332
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,440
I kill you all, dirtbags!

333
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,920
I shall liberate Belgrado

334
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,960
from scum like you!

335
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,560
Our comrades die and

336
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,560
starve to death, and you steal!

337
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,120
Are you out of your mind?

338
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,720
No, boys...

339
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,440
you are not playing it well.

340
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,440
Hold this for a moment.

341
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,400
Faster and harder!

342
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,920
Here I come, buddy!

343
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,040
Invincible!

344
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,240
Attention!

345
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,600
Here I come!

346
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,280
Not in the ear!

347
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,480
Left, left, left!

348
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,520
I have to tell you something,

349
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,640
you as party secretary...

350
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,440
If something hurts us,

351
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,080
it's that scum of

352
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,040
thieves and tramps.

353
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,000
We commit robberies for weapons

354
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,200
and food for our comrades,

355
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,440
and these bastards steal from us!

356
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,040
I want to commit suicide.

357
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,840
You say you are gonna commit suicide,

358
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,440
but you won't do it.

359
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,800
Are you sure?

360
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,280
Do you think a man can live...

361
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,920
Quiet!

362
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,200
...without anything or anyone

363
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,000
to live for?

364
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,320
You are capitulating?

365
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,200
No, I'm doing a peace

366
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,440
proposal!

367
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,120
He devours her.

368
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,320
I'll kill him.

369
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
You don't even see the actors.

370
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,600
I really like the captain.

371
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,000
Oh yeah?
-Yes, look.

372
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,040
Quiet, this is a theatre.

373
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm leaving, mate.

374
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,200
Left!

375
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,560
Keep your hands off!

376
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,320
Watch the stage!

377
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,760
Goodnight!

378
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,200
Tell me honestly

379
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,320
the truth

380
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,760
and I'll forgive you.

381
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Is Berta my child?

382
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,240
I can't be guilty from

383
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,680
something I didn't do.

384
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,920
Leave me!

385
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,800
Shame on you!

386
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,040
...and make his dishonesties public?

387
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,720
Is Berta my child?

388
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,920
Is Berta my child?

389
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,760
Is Berta my child?

390
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,480
I'm coming!

391
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
Bato!
-Quiet!

392
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,720
Uncle Blacky!

393
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,360
Natalija is the best.

394
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,240
Franz!

395
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
It's a shame.
-Yes.

396
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,280
Captain!

397
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,960
Good evening, miss.

398
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,400
Captain...

399
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,160
A moment please.

400
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,520
I'm Berta's father.

401
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,840
I'm the father

402
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,960
of your child.

403
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,160
Please...

404
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,520
Do you understand?

405
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,240
Tie them up. Fast!

406
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
I came to collect my Laura.

407
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,840
We love each other.

408
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,640
Faster!

409
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
We leave your house

410
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,640
to live together.

411
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,760
Please, don't be angry.

412
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,200
Ready?
-Yes.

413
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,400
Thanks, captain.

414
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,600
I'm the actor.

415
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,640
I know him.

416
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,560
But where from?

417
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Goodbye, captain.

418
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,680
You are playing for the germans,

419
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,880
bastard!

420
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,360
What an actor, my collegue.

421
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,480
Is that electricity?

422
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,160
Sit down!

423
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,400
Hands up, traitor!

424
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,600
Hands up!

425
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,640
Is that the robe?

426
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,160
Yes, mister, but...

427
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,080
Uncle Blacky! Sister!

428
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Uncle Blacky! Attack!

429
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,240
Do you want my sister?

430
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,760
You won't get her!

431
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,280
Hands up, my friend!

432
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,640
They will kill my brother!

433
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,080
Blow!

434
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,600
I'm not getting married every day!

435
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,040
Congratulations!

436
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,960
Good, Golub. Where is the priest?

437
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,080
On his way. I ordered to get him.

438
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,600
Congratulations, miss.

439
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,360
I'm not getting married!

440
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,920
Yes you do, my love.

441
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,000
You don't even know it, that's all.

442
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,800
I destroyed your life by killing

443
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,560
Franz. Thank you, Natalija.

444
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,520
Who will take care of Bato's medicine?

445
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
Franz or you?

446
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,480
You give me stolen gold.

447
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,120
Stolen from traitors.

448
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,760
Think about it.

449
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,160
Listen to me...

450
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,680
I never loved anyone like you.

451
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,280
But there are rules.

452
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,000
No collaboration with the enemy.

453
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,240
That's right!
-What the fuck are you saying?

454
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,520
I'm just an actrice.

455
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,400
The backers are also open?

456
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,760
Yeah, but you are not the backer's wife!

457
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,440
You don't sell bread.

458
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,280
You sell your soul!

459
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,120
He who sells his soul,

460
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,040
I shall judge myself.

461
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,120
At first I'll kill

462
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,080
your theatre director.

463
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,080
I'll strangle him myself.

464
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,160
Because I love theatre.

465
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,400
Congratulations, Mr. Blacky!

466
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,120
Does the dinner eat us,

467
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,120
or we the dinner?

468
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm gonna roast that fish!

469
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
No problem.

470
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,720
Aren't you ashamed?

471
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,840
Your collegues are nursing the partisans

472
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,240
and you play for these bastards.

473
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,880
It hurts.

474
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,800
Oh, does it hurt?

475
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,280
I love you.

476
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,600
Golub!

477
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,880
That fish needs to be roasted.

478
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,120
Come on, I'm going to pee.

479
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,760
Guard my fiancee, my friend.

480
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,600
Forward!

481
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,440
Marko...

482
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,800
Come on!

483
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,960
I don't want to.

484
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,400
I do not want to marry.

485
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,320
Don't force me to come

486
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,680
over and clear things out!

487
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,000
Don't fear.

488
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,800
You might not know,

489
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,960
but he actually isn't

490
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,600
an electrical engineer.

491
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,480
He is a simple electrician

492
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,640
who climbs up in the masts.

493
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,880
He has been all his life up in the

494
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,000
masts with pincers and clips.

495
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,600
I got him out of there.

496
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,400
I asked him wether he wanted

497
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,920
to be on our side and he said yes.

498
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,880
"Shall you respect our statutes

499
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,040
and rules?"

500
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,240
"Yes"

501
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,480
And that way it continued until he got rich.

502
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,280
Natalija...

503
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,280
An electrician?

504
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,200
A mast worker!

505
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,080
Natalija,

506
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,040
you are our best actrice

507
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,040
Our people in peril

508
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,520
need you.

509
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,480
You need a man who is

510
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,400
reasonable, intelligent,

511
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,720
civilized...

512
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,080
An intellectual.

513
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,000
That's true.

514
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,600
Comrade Leka wants you

515
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,800
in front of the court martial.

516
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,760
Where are the weapons we have

517
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,280
been waiting for for a week?

518
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,000
Here, aboard.

519
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,600
I'll get married and we'll sail off.

520
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
They'll hear the music in Belgrado.

521
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,040
They should. Blacky is getting married.

522
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,600
Enough wining.

523
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,440
Aren't these weapons?

524
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,720
After the priest marries me, I'll go to

525
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,120
the White Rock.I'll be there before you.

526
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,000
Comrade Tito!

527
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,800
When will you come to Uzice?

528
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,240
"Your hands are so white,

529
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,960
so fragile and tender,

530
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,760
like the wings of a bird...

531
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,640
If I only could see them fly

532
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
and land on my face..."

533
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,000
Stop it!

534
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,240
Go away!

535
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,720
What's this?

536
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,160
We were talking about theatre...

537
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,280
What? What are you doing?

538
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,880
I'll kill you!

539
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,120
No, my good friend!

540
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,760
I've killed two men for her

541
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,320
I know.

542
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,320
Why are you doing this to me?

543
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,800
And you...
-It wasn't me.

544
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,680
Wasn't that you?

545
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,480
Who then? Me?

546
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,800
Are you my best friend?

547
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,520
I am your best friend.

548
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,320
I didn't hear you.

549
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,280
I am your best friend.

550
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,400
Who's gonna get married?

551
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,960
We, my love.

552
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,840
We are getting married.
You are getting married.

553
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,000
We are getting married, my love.

554
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,720
We are getting married, honey.

555
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,640
You wanted to drive, no?

556
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Go, stallion!

557
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,120
Old chap!

558
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,360
Where is that priest?

559
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,200
He'll be here soon.

560
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,720
Moonshine at noon?

561
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,760
Or sunshine at midnight?

562
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,600
From heaven above

563
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,480
shines a light...

564
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,840
The germans! What a disaster!

565
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,120
Nobody knows

566
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,080
Nobody knows

567
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,160
where the light comes from...

568
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,560
Together you would be

569
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,920
the ideal man!

570
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,920
You are getting on my nerves.

571
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,320
Get out!

572
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,880
And cover yourself!

573
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,160
Left and right from the boat!

574
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,400
Marko!

575
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,000
Petar Popara!

576
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,760
Bloody idiots!

577
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,480
Your game is out!

578
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,480
Franz...

579
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,040
Show yourself!

580
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,560
And bring Natalija with you

581
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,160
or I'll kill you!

582
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,200
Didn't I shoot him?

583
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,800
No.

584
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,600
He wears a bulletproof jacket.

585
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,320
Next time aim for his head.

586
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,360
I'll smoke another cigarette,

587
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,360
and then my patience ends!

588
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,960
Then I have to see you.

589
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,440
Understood?

590
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,880
Don't shoot!

591
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,560
Don't shoot!

592
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,920
Thank you.

593
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,560
What a disaster!

594
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,200
My beloved saver!

595
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,720
Honey...

596
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,160
Schulz, get out!

597
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,720
And finish that

598
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,760
criminal scum off quickly!

599
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,200
My white dove...

600
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,760
Lot's of pleasure, idiots!

601
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,800
You won't forget me soon!

602
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,720
Shoot, old chap!

603
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,040
Golub, don't shoot!

604
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,280
What a disaster!

605
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,360
Shoot, man!

606
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,720
Where are the guns, Blacky?

607
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,240
Where is the train with guns, bastard?

608
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,720
Dirty traitor!

609
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,720
I'll smash Tito out of your head.

610
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,600
And?

611
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,920
Does he talk?

612
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,560
No.

613
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,840
He's only cursing us.

614
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,400
Petar Popara...

615
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,680
Go to hell, fascist swine.

616
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,360
No.

617
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,000
Lick my ass.

618
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,000
Run the current incrementally up.

619
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,720
Marry uncle Blacky, sister.

620
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,520
He is the strongest.

621
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,880
Forget uncle Blacky, there comes Franz.

622
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,840
He's the strongest of them all.

623
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,760
Don't be such an ass.

624
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,600
What did he say?

625
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,120
He asks

626
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,280
when you can leave the hospital

627
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,600
Next week.

628
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,440
He's going to a sanatorium in Austria.

629
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,760
A sanatorium in Austria?

630
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,680
There he will be safe.

631
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,600
I can't help me here

632
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,280
and it's to dangerous for him.

633
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,560
Good Morning.

634
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,440
Good Morning.

635
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,240
Did our young friend

636
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,600
throw up tonight?

637
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,640
Yes.

638
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,120
No.

639
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,640
Is it yes...

640
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,760
or is it no?

641
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
I don't know.

642
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,520
No, he didn't throw up.

643
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,680
Tell me that he doesn't has to worry.

644
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,400
Please.

645
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,760
Let him explode!

646
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,840
Dirty fascist nazi kraut!

647
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,920
Let him go!

648
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,520
Let him blow apart

649
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,240
like a paper bag!

650
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,600
You killed my Franz.

651
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,120
Is he dead?

652
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,360
Not yet.

653
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,120
Forgive me. Franz. I'm sorry.

654
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,600
Your Franz can fuck himself! Come on!

655
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,000
What's wrong with that piece of crap?

656
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,560
Put it on level 5.

657
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,160
That's lethal.

658
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,960
Lethal? My ass!

659
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,560
Let me try.

660
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,840
It doesn't work.

661
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,320
Put it on.

662
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,920
Colleague...

663
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,040
Wake up!

664
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,320
Good morning, gentlemen.

665
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,000
Everything under control?

666
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,440
What's wrong with him?

667
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,960
He tested the generator.

668
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,200
And did it work?
-Yes, he's dead.

669
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,880
But he isn't hurt.

670
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,760
He's an electrician.

671
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,640
Electrician?

672
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,600
A mast worker!

673
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,880
Mate! Give me a granade.

674
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,040
If they might find me.

675
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,720
Here's your granade.

676
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,080
Come on!

677
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,240
Thank you, Marko.

678
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,120
What piteous, all this loonatics

679
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,120
Sure, sure.

680
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,720
We are all crazy, Natalija.

681
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,880
The only thing is the diagnosis

682
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,960
hasn't been said.

683
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,000
Where is uncle Blacky?

684
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,040
In the basket, my boy.

685
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,680
In the basket?

686
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,400
Mate?
-In the basket?

687
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,000
Uncle Blacky!

688
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,720
Bloody fascist swines.

689
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,400
Ivan!

690
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,280
Golub!

691
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,880
Get us bandages.

692
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,360
Carry on,old friend.

693
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,640
Where is that bandage?!

694
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,760
Come and help us...pick Jovan.

695
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,200
Get rid of that monkey, Help him!

696
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,840
Step harder.

697
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,560
We need more light.

698
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,720
Caution for his leg.

699
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,560
Comrade Blacky,

700
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,080
what did they do?

701
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,720
Bloody fascist swines.

702
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,880
What a disaster!

703
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,920
Jovan...

704
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,160
Comrade Marko!

705
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,200
Get your granddad, he will cure him.

706
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,520
The water of the well his healthy.

707
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,320
Bring the weapons to our comrades.

708
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,720
Don't worry, I'll do it.

709
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,680
Look, here's Jovan.

710
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,480
Here's your daddy

711
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,280
Let him see his daddy.

712
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,880
Jovan...

713
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,760
My son...

714
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,600
Give your daddy a kiss.

715
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,160
Give him a kiss.

716
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,320
This room is dedicated to me.

717
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,400
My room!

718
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,080
Okay...

719
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,920
Yes.

720
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,200
This room...

721
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,800
and the whole house.

722
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,360
And the country, heaven and the stars,

723
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,360
the sun, the moon, the clouds...

724
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,120
even if it unclouded

725
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,240
Is this all mine?

726
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,440
Sure, everything.

727
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,920
Who is bombing us?

728
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,240
The Allies.

729
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,160
If it isn't the Germans,

730
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,080
it's the Allies.

731
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,120
Where are you going?

732
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,240
To the cellar.
-Come...

733
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,680
Come with me.

734
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,240
Are you afraid?

735
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,000
Not if I'm with you.

736
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,600
Drink.

737
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,160
I never drink.

738
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,920
Don't be afraid, drink.

739
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,560
It's not strong, but gentle.

740
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,200
Really.

741
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,000
I don't know, sweety,

742
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,920
wether this is a dream

743
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,400
And what year, which day it is

744
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,320
And I don't know,

745
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,560
My love,

746
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,440
Wether I'm your dream

747
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,040
Or you mine...

748
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,640
For who did you write that?

749
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,400
Tell me.
-For you.

750
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,800
You're lying.

751
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,720
You are lying
-I'm not

752
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,880
You are lying
-I never lie.

753
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,360
Never.

754
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,440
Marko,

755
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,040
you can lie so deliciously.

756
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,880
Easter, april 1944

757
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,000
The Allies ar bombing

758
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,280
what the nazi's had left standing up.

759
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,720
Freedom!

760
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,920
They are trying to steal

761
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,880
a part of our country!

762
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,320
With the weapons we won

763
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,920
the plebiscite and

764
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,640
defended the freedom!

765
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,760
With weapons we will defend Triëste!

766
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,920
Second Part - The Cold War

767
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,440
Years go by, Marko became

768
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,880
a collaborator of Tito.

769
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,400
In 1961 he pays off

770
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,440
his debts to Blacky.

771
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,640
Comrade Marko...

772
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,280
I ask you once more

773
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,440
wether comrade Natalija can

774
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,240
play in my movie.
-No.

775
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,840
But I'm filming you memoires,

776
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,080
and she is our greatest actress.

777
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,080
Exactly.

778
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,400
The movie is dedicated to the revolution,

779
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,080
not to us.

780
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,880
Do you want to honour us

781
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,920
with a visit during the filming?

782
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,080
Sure.

783
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,440
Comrades,

784
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,360
I have the great honour

785
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,960
to open this Cultural Centre

786
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,240
with a statue of our hero

787
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,480
Petar Popara Blacky.

788
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,720
Blacky symbolizes

789
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,120
our battle against the fascists.

790
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,280
He will live eternally in the hearts

791
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,160
of his friends,

792
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,040
his battle comrades,

793
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,280
and of the generations to come

794
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,760
which will come from childhood on

795
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,840
to this Centre to find

796
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,040
inspiration from this believe

797
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,160
for which our brother,

798
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,120
our comrade, our friend,

799
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,600
our Blacky

800
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,600
gave his life and youth.

801
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,080
I'll use this opportunity,

802
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,240
allthough I waste some of your time,

803
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,880
to bring you some poems

804
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,080
from my last poetry book

805
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,920
about the Freedom Battle.

806
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,360
Why is the wind always blowing

807
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,080
If we are commemorate our beloved?

808
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,320
Why does the wind hit the windows

809
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,840
And the doors of our brothers?

810
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,600
Is it only the wind that blows

811
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,800
Or howls the heaven with us?

812
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,440
Petar Popara Blacky, our friend,

813
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,000
glory to you!

814
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,200
Glory to him!

815
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,080
Moonshine at noon?

816
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,400
Sunshine at midnight?

817
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,280
From the heaven up there

818
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,280
Shines a light

819
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,120
Nobody knows...

820
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,720
The sovjet divisions

821
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,080
are surrounded.

822
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,520
The units of general Von Kleist

823
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,760
have broken through...

824
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,280
Continue, sister.

825
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,960
More light!

826
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,400
Daddy!

827
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,600
Bring some water!

828
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,840
What has happened?

829
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,760
It's okay.

830
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,840
The gestapo got me.

831
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,440
Bloody fascist swines

832
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,080
Bloody fascist swines!

833
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,960
Marko, let me out

834
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,680
and in 3 days the war ends.

835
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,680
Not yet.

836
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,240
Where are you waiting for?

837
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,680
Tito asked you to wait.

838
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,480
Tito?

839
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,840
He said:

840
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,160
"Greet Blacky from me

841
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,920
and tell him to wait.

842
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,880
I want to spare him for the last battle."

843
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,000
Did he say that?
-Literally.

844
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,400
He asked me to give you this watch.

845
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,040
Ho, Marko, I can't...

846
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,680
with a mission.

847
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,800
For me?

848
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,760
For you.

849
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,760
Comrade Tito

850
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,320
We promise you formally

851
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,080
We promise you formally

852
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,440
Comrade Tito

853
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,240
We promise you formally

854
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,920
That we'll never depart

855
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,080
from the path you showed us

856
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,920
Comrade Tito

857
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,480
Hope of the people

858
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,400
You are beloved

859
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,920
by old

860
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,560
and youth

861
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,680
Comrade Tito

862
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,480
Our spring flower

863
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,840
Serbia

864
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Shall never forget you

865
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,080
a blue violet

866
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,160
blossomed

867
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,920
on the pillow

868
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,400
of comrade Tito...

869
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,720
Congratulations, Blacky.

870
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,600
Shake hands with comrade Marko.

871
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,160
Not with me. Comrade Marko.

872
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,520
Are we washing ourselves?
-Yes.

873
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,920
And our business, grandpa?

874
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,000
It's... difficult

875
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,240
Are you watching the time?

876
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,240
I turn the hours back,

877
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,640
as you told me to do.

878
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,080
Six hours a day.

879
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,240
Do not exagerate to much.

880
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,400
On 20 years time

881
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,600
I have saved them 5 years.

882
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,000
Can you imagine

883
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,000
what that means...

884
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,600
5 years less in a cellar.

885
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,920
Air strike!

886
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,480
Fast, comrades!

887
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,320
Hurry up! Leave the guns!

888
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,360
Everybody in the tank!

889
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,840
The enemy is attacking again!

890
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,160
No panic!

891
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,520
What are you doing, moron?

892
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,240
Come on, idiot!

893
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,200
You'll kill us all.

894
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,440
Quick!

895
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,640
Comrade Tito

896
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,800
We promise you formally...

897
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,720
Tito, Tito, Tito!

898
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,080
Everybody was singing

899
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,560
and thinking that outside

900
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,160
the fascists of World War II

901
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,000
were still at reign.

902
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,520
What are you doing, Marko?

903
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,080
You'll see.

904
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,440
Ringe, ringe, raja

905
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,440
Here comes uncle Paja...

906
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,400
And now?

907
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,880
Natalija!

908
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,160
Natalija, spring is coming

909
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,240
on a snow white horse!

910
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,840
Stop! Stop! Cut!

911
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,640
Stop? Why are you cutting?

912
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,560
Yugoslav, dammit!

913
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,200
Are you calling this rain?

914
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,400
"Stop! Stop!"

915
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,280
Can you never say "Play"?

916
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,960
Thanks, people. Take a break.

917
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,240
The water has to flow!

918
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,760
There he is! Music!

919
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,400
"The spring comes",

920
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,160
scene 34a, second take

921
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,720
Action!

922
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,080
The Germans!

923
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,160
Natalija, honey!

924
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,880
The spring comes

925
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,880
on a snow white horse!

926
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,480
I am being raped!

927
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,120
Nobody gets

928
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,320
Petar Popara alias Blacky!

929
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,400
Natalija!

930
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,200
Long live the Communist Party

931
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,040
of Yugoslavia!

932
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,840
I'm being raped!

933
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,080
Cut!

934
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,080
Comrade, Marko!

935
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,880
Get up, all of you!

936
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,880
Stop the rain!

937
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,920
Comrades artists,

938
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,320
work full of despair

939
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,720
You interprete...

940
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,280
great men

941
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,360
who are no longer amongst us.

942
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,240
Let's honour them.

943
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,800
Never will they be forgotten.

944
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,720
To a long life, comrades!

945
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,520
Music!

946
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,400
Cheers, comrade Marko!

947
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,960
Comrade Marko,

948
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,480
let me introduce you to

949
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,400
the heroes from your memoires.

950
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,080
Not now!

951
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,080
Who are you?

952
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,400
Marko!

953
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,040
Yes, I am you.

954
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,080
Amazing...

955
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,960
Exactly my portrait.

956
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,160
Where did you find these people?

957
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,360
The casting is half of the work.

958
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,440
True. Unbelievable.

959
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,920
We exchanged our books

960
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,640
for rifles from the same wood.

961
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,360
Shoot, my rifle,

962
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,080
So that mother hears.

963
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,000
Never will I give my country up

964
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,880
To the enemy.

965
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,520
Come on, say something.

966
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,840
Well?
-She is nice.

967
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,520
Sure she is.

968
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,760
Franz?

969
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,360
Franz the vampyre.

970
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,240
Very beautiful, but I got the impression

971
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,160
that someone is missing.

972
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,920
Is this the real Franz or an actor?

973
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,600
Who knows?

974
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,240
An actor.

975
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,400
Yes, an actor.

976
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,120
Unbelievable.

977
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,960
Everything is just like it was back then.

978
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,240
When you killed eleven Germans,

979
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,960
dived...
-What a memory.

980
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,160
...and Blacky and Natalija saved.

981
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,440
True, true.

982
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,120
Excuse me.

983
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,560
Blacky!

984
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,920
My friend!

985
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,240
God, Blacky.

986
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,280
Why did they have to kill you?

987
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,800
Why?

988
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,640
Comrade Marko,

989
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,720
can't you protect the actors?

990
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,160
I got burnt for the third time.

991
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,760
Three times!

992
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,600
Comrade Marko,

993
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,800
it will be an awesome movie!

994
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,720
Are you afraid for God?

995
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,080
Are we afraid for God, you mean.

996
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,160
You should better

997
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,800
learn your script.

998
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,080
Literally.

999
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,400
Understood?

1000
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,680
Goodnight.

1
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,120
What's that?

2
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:35,960
What you will tell him

3
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,760
when you are in the cellar.

4
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,720
This?

5
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,080
This bunch of crap,

6
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,160
who ever the author

7
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,360
of the director is,

8
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,120
it's still crap.

9
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,760
If you are asking for my opinion...

10
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,280
This is my opinion!

11
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,080
You are a poet, Marko!

12
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,760
Write poems!

13
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,680
What's wrong?

14
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:08,920
The truth!

15
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,600
The truth?
-Yes, dear.

16
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,000
You know, the truth...

17
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,960
No text, dear,

18
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,760
contains the truth.

19
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,800
These things only exists in life.

20
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,840
You are the truth.

21
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,920
You.

22
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,800
You are supposed to be the truth.

23
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,200
There is no truth, except your own believe

24
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,920
that what you act is the truth.

25
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,320
Art is a lie.

26
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,400
One big lie.

27
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,600
We are all liars.

28
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,960
At least a bit.

29
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,480
Son of a bitch! Bastard!

30
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,560
They raped me, hit me...

31
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,520
What else?

32
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,840
Is it this important that these people

33
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,800
keep living in the cellar?

34
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,320
Very important, honey.

35
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,720
You gave yourself the role of the hero,

36
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,360
and I can play the whore!

37
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,480
Everybody may fuck your wife!

38
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,040
Get yourself dressed and made up.

39
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,880
I promised them to rescue

40
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,720
you for the wedding.

41
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,440
Could you please get dressed and made yourself up.

42
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,040
I said no.

43
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,200
I said no!

44
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,800
I can't play a role

45
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,480
in which I don't believe.
