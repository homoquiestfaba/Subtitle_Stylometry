00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:20,032

(tense music)

6
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,853
- Haley?

7
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:52,270
(soft whistling)

8
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,103
Haley?

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,913
Here, boy.

10
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,603
Haley?

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,091
What is this?

12
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:03,823
- Shut up!
- What is, what, what?

13
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:04,920
Tell me what you want.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,830
- [Pete] Shut up, man, just shut up

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,190
and give me your wallet.

16
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,860
- Fine, here.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,883
Here, take it all.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,120
Where's my dog?

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,240
Please don't hurt my dog.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,750
- The dog is fine.

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,080
- Well then, what do you guys want?

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,230
Just tell me what you want!

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,063
- [Pete] The ring, gimme the ring.

24
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,800
Give me the damn ring.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,050
- Please don't take my wedding ring.

26
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,550
My wife will kill me.

27
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,383
- Pete, come on.

28
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,323
Pete.

29
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:36,351
(tense music)

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,213
- I can't do it.

31
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:44,461
Billy.

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,373
I can't.

33
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,965
(tense music)

34
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,880
- Oh God, forgive me.

35
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:10,328
(gun firing)

36
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:11,828
- There they come.

37
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:16,602
(tense music)

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,173
How'd it go?

39
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,720
- We did it.

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,553
I killed him.

41
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,791
(reporters yelling loudly)

42
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:38,848
- [Man] What do you mean
there's no more seats in there?

43
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:42,431
(reporters yelling loudly)

44
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,590
- [Officer] Unfortunately,
we have no more room.

45
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,020
- Pamela Smart seemed to
be the perfect role model

46
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,040
for the students of New
Hampshire School District 21.

47
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,220
She was young,

48
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,660
extremely bright,

49
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,773
attractive, and a very hip media director.

50
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,060
Kids looked up to her.

51
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,893
They liked her.

52
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,377
In fact, one young boy, Billy Flynn,

53
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:08,780
developed a crush on her.

54
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,960
Fantasy, really, like
most teenage boys might.

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,960
But unlike most, this
fantasy was encouraged,

56
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,793
nurtured, indeed fulfilled by Ms. Smart.

57
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,300
The defendant initiated an
affair with Billy Flynn.

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,570
She freely admits to
having sexual intercourse

59
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,600
with the then 16-year-old Billy,

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,340
several times, in fact,

61
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,393
in his house, in her car,
in her office at school.

62
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:44,650
But it was after the very
first time they had sex,

63
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,320
in her home, in the bed that she shared

64
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,070
with her husband, Greg, who
was away on a business trip

65
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,380
that she drove Billy back to his place

66
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,910
and on the way, she informed him that

67
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,860
they'd have to break up.

68
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,773
Gregg was getting suspicious.

69
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,190
There wasn't anything
else that could be done,

70
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,653
except murder Greg.

71
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,110
And for the next 12 weeks, Pamela Smart

72
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,570
relentlessly urged and
systematically instructed

73
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,333
Billy Flynn to take her husband's life.

74
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:31,027
(telephone ringing)

75
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,331
(rock music blaring in headphones)

76
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,331
(telephone ringing)

77
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,300
- Hello?

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,720
- Can I interest you in some
term life insurance, ma'am?

79
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,000
- You got the job at Northeastern.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,510
- Dateline New Hampshire:

81
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,800
Gregg Smart follows in
footsteps of father, Bill,

82
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,620
world to become a more
secure place as of Monday.

83
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,000
- Well, congratulations, Greg.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,139
That's good news.

85
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,640
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

86
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,981
Listen, have you seen that
fiance of mine lately?

87
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:20,231
(rock music blaring in headphones)

88
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,560
- Greg's on the phone.

89
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,563
He got the job.

90
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,053
- You really got it?

91
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:32,950
- [Greg] How could they resist?

92
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,053
So, can you pack a bag in an hour?

93
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,303
- For what?

94
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,820
- [Greg] Well, I figured
we'd spend my last weekend

95
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,190
of freedom having a wicked
good time in Boston, huh?

96
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,410
- What do you mean, last weekend?

97
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,130
- Pammy, it's a figure of speech.

98
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,830
So, what, I'll pick you up at six?

99
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,610
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

100
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,220
- Bye.

101
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,100
- This is wonderful.

102
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,410
I think, this is just what Gregg needs.

103
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,360
- What?

104
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,530
- I just meant, he could
do with a bit of maturing.

105
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,280
There's nothing like a real
profession to do the trick.

106
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,498
(heavy metal music blaring)

107
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:22,694
(doorbell ringing)

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,833
- Hi!

109
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:29,810
We have a 6:30 dinner reservation.

110
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,850
Come on, let's move we're gonna hit some

111
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,756
Friday night traffic.
- Your hair.

112
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:33,840
What happened to your hair?

113
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,253
- Well, the barber's still
sweeping it up even as we speak.

114
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,300
Sorry, babe, it had to go, you know.

115
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,740
I'm a big time corporate exec now.

116
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,240
- It was so long; it was so beautiful.

117
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,783
- I know and it's all for you.

118
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,840
- I don't want it in an envelope, Greg.

119
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,940
I want it on your head.

120
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,360
It's so wild you look--

121
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,750
- Pam, I may look like Donald Trump,

122
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,020
but I still feel like Jon Bon Jovi.

123
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,260
- It's not funny, Greg.

124
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,190
- Honey, look.

125
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,970
In a couple of months after
I've knocked 'em all dead

126
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,410
with my sales magic, I'll grow it back

127
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,329
and nobody's gonna care.

128
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,480
In the meantime, I gotta
make an impression, right?

129
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,903
It's just part of the game.

130
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,460
I mean, you don't wear your spiked heels

131
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,310
and your sequined bustier to
the school district, do you?

132
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,202
It's the same thing, right?

133
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:24,035
- I guess.

134
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,680
- Come on, Pam.

135
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,863
It's just hair.

136
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,249
Don't let it ruin our weekend.

137
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,640
I'm still me.

138
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,197
I got all kinds of fun planned.

139
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:37,880
All kinds.

140
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,500
- I better go pack my spikes and sequins.

the murder of her 24-year-old
husband of 11 months?

grieving for the loss of Gregg Smart,

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,550

coolly covering up the fact

161

accomplice in this killing.

165

- Where'd you find room
in there for clothes?

166
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,673
- Who needs clothes?

167
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,223

Yes!

you for making me feel

172
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,760
so much a part of your family.

173
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,350
Sometimes I feel closer to you and Bill

174
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,500
than I do to my own parents,

175
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,690
and I just wanted you to know.

176
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,100
- We're proud to have
you as our daughter, Pam

177
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,590
and you are part of the family, you know?

178
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,233
Now, you go and have some fun.

to let us down onto the private beach.

182
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:27,854

- That's my boy.

00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:28,740
(people chuckling)

184
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,200
- [Judy] You just got
back and you've already

185
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,530
got your pictures organized, remarkable.

186
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,210
- Hey, how 'bout some champagne?

187
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,350
- Great.

188
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,410
- Will you look at all these gifts?

189
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,640
My Lord, you two made out.

190
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,080
If Bill and I had gotten this many gifts

191
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,121
when we got married, he
could have retired early.

192
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:44,490
- That's right.

193
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,360
- This toaster cost $275.

194
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,620
Isn't it just like the most
gorgeous thing you've ever seen?

195
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,667
- For $275, it better be.

196
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:55,401
- For 275, it better make the
damn eggs and bacon, as well.

197
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,570
- Didn't Bill's brother,
Jeffrey, give you a toaster?

198
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,367
- He did, but it was only like 85.

199
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,150
No, no, no, 65 on sale, so I took it back

200
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,170
and got a credit toward another
place setting of our china.

201
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,160
- Hey, Pam.

202
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,300
- Do you know how much
all these things cost?

203
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,550
I mean, did you go down to the
store and price everything?

204
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,030
- 'Course, I know each and every price

205
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,640
right down to the penny.

206
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,860
I also made a whole computer printout,

207
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,520
so I can tell you...

208
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,970
Okay, for instance, the cheapest present

209
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,030
from my side of the family was $95.

210
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,070
- Do tell.

211
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,960
- [Pam] But the cheapest present

212
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,563
from your side was only $55.

213
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,420
The average--
- Pam, cool it, will ya?

214
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,690
Nobody cares.

215
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,080
- Yes, they do, I think, it's important

216
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,150
to know the value of things.

217
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,560
The average on my side was 123

218
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,193
and the average on your side was 89.

219
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,230
I think it's worth something

220
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,830
to know these things, don't you?

221
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,863
- Champagne?

222
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,573
1695.

223
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,950
- Did Pam in any way
engage in the planning

224
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,210
of the killing of her own husband?

225
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,700
We will prove she absolutely did not,

226
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,610
but we will only prove that

227
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,110
if you all keep an open mind to the facts.

228
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,943
All the facts.

229
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,860
The Constitution grants each citizen

230
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,870
the right to a fair trial.

231
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,970
You must now see to it then

232
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,010
that it happens in Exeter County.

233
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,010
It is in your hands,

234
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,410
and you must listen to
everything in context;

235
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,540
context, not little bits and pieces

236
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,810
that seem to give you a kernel of truth,

237
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,530
but rather you must take it in the context

238
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,540
of the person from whom it is coming.

239
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,440
If you do that, if you give Pamela Smart

240
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,210
a fair trial, if you do
not jump to conclusions

241
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,270
but rather let the process
play out before you,

242
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,560
then you will return with
a not guilty verdict.

243
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,980
And you might even end up
a little angry, as I am,

244
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,280
that this case was ever
even brought to trial.

245
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:55,878
(door banging)

246
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,853
- Pam?

247
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,413
What happened?

248
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:10,830
- I just got told by Channel Nine

249
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,096
that I'm not good enough
to be their news person.

250
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:16,804
- [Greg] Oh, god, honey, I'm sorry.

251
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:18,420
You worked hard on that
audition, I know you did.

252
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,330
- Two bit small town local TV station's

253
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,240
too stupid to know
talent when they see it.

254
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,000
Rot in that media center forever teaching

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,493
15-year-olds how to plug in a VCR.

256
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
- Well, listen, do you
think, I don't know,

257
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,450
Barbara Walters hit the big time

258
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,283
first shot out?
- I want it now.

259
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,857
I want it now.

260
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:41,030
- Honey, you're 22 years--
- I know how old I am.

261
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,554
- Honey, all I'm saying
is that one audition--

262
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:46,061
- I'm sorry, I'm just...

263
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:49,797
I know, I'm sorry.

264
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:52,350
Aren't you gonna be late
for your appointments?

265
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,833
- Yeah.

267
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,110
Are you gonna be alright?

268
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,153
Okay.

269
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,200
Listen, I'm gonna be home
probably around 10 o'clock.

270
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,050
You gonna be up?

271
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,697
- No, I have an early
day at the media center.

272
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:09,484
- Okay.

273
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:14,089
Pammy.

274
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,980
I don't know, for what it's worth,

275
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,793
I'd rather hear the news
from you than anybody on TV.

276
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,463
Honest.

277
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:30,654
(melancholy music)

278
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,690
- So, maybe my friends were doing cocaine,

279
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,010
you know, a couple,
three times, maybe more.

280
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,153
You know, said it was really great.

281
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,273
The only problem was,
later, after it wore off,

282
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,390
everything was still there.

283
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,727
You know, I mean,

284
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,993
maybe everything that everybody
thought was bothering them,

285
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,990
that the coke was
supposed to take care of,

286
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,480
it just seemed to bother them worse.

287
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,190
I just figured the best
thing to do is just to,

288
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,483
to solve your problems,

289
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,620
and that way, there's no
reason to do the coke.

290
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:22,680
(melancholy music)

291
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,483
- I think, Billy's absolutely right.

292
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:29,080
You know, there's like this belief that

293
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,970
drugs and rock music kinda go together.

294
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,803
Forget it.

295
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,270
I mean, nobody's more
into heavy metal than me.

296
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,056
I was the D.J. on this radio talk show

297
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:41,806
at this college station in Florida,

298
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,680
and I was known as the Maiden of Metal.

299
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,980
And so I did all the concerts, I hung out,

300
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,230
I got to know the groups.

301
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,820
Well, Eddie Van Halen came on my show

302
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,890
this one time to talk about drugs

303
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,553
and he basically said the same
things that Billy just said.

304
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,393
So, here's the deal.

305
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,020
I guess when the partying stops,

306
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,503
the problems are still there,

307
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:12,243
they're just staring at bloodshot eyes.

308
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,060
- Poor, young, vulnerable Billy Flynn.

309
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,020
How vulnerable, I ask you, how innocent?

310
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,020
How pitiable, malleable
is a person who not once,

311
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,000
but on three separate occasions

312
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,820
admittedly set out to kill Gregg Smart?

313
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,540
A person who admittedly
put a .38 caliber revolver

314
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,550
to the head of another human being,

315
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,830
a human being who begged for his life

316
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,660
and then without so much as a thought,

317
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,020
pulled the trigger,
watched the blood splatter

318
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,410
and then simply left his victim to die.

319
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,290
- [Cecelia] So, what do you do at school?

320
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,370
- What do I do as Media Director?

321
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,020
- Well, I didn't mean anything, I just--

322
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,120
- No, no, no, it's a really good question.

323
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,840
I do just about everything
having to do with the media.

324
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,780
I do the news releases.

325
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,960
I'm in charge of getting out
the District 21 newsletter.

326
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,740
I take the pictures.

327
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,573
I write the articles.

328
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:01,960
I do the layout on the computer.

329
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,580
- [Cecelia] Wow, that
sounds like fun almost.

330
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,980
- [Pam] Well, it is fun.

331
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,490
Jobs can be fun, you know?

332
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,520
- Yeah, I guess.

333
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,500
I never um...

334
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,870
I don't know.

335
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,583
- What do you want to do eventually?

336
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,320
- Well, I was thinking
like, maybe, you know,

337
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,350
to be a journalist or something.

338
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,940
- Well, you should come to
the office and hang out.

339
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,100
Really, I can always use the help.

340
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,650
We could work on some
different stuff together,

341
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,917
see if you like it.

342
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,360
- That'd be great, thanks.

343
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,440
I get out here.

344
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,720
- Which one's your house?

345
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,830
- It's right down there.

346
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,720
- Okay, I can drive you.

347
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,663
- Oh, it's okay, really.

348
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:42,310
(heavy metal music blaring)

349
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,679
Thanks, see you guys.

350
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,096
- [Billy] See ya.

351
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,063
- If you come up here, I won't
feel like I'm your chauffer.

352
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,113
- Oh, sure.

353
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:58,173
(rock music)

354
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:01,296
♪ Somewhere in the night ♪

355
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:06,296
♪ She comes to you a stranger ♪

356
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:08,197

357
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:09,513
- Do you play guitar?

358
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,510
I was watching you in the mirror.

359
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,813
- Oh, I guess.

360
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,740
I try.

361
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,320
- I used to date a guy
who played lead guitar

362
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,620
for this really hot bad.

363
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,670
It takes a lot of work to get good at it.

364
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,213
You into Van Halen?

365
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,850
- Oh yeah.

366
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,720
You really know him, you know,

367
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,970
you were talking about back at the school?

368
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,300
- I don't know him know
him, but he was on my show

369
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,582
and we just hung out for a
while after we got off the air.

370
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,963
- They're like, my favorite band.

371
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:39,810
I mean, after Motley
Crue, maybe Whitesnake.

372
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,677
- Ooh, ooh, I love this song.

373
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:46,344
(heavy metal music blaring)

374
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,860
- Well uh, thanks for the ride.

375
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,570
I guess I'll see ya around.

376
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,150
- Okay.

377
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,600
You did really great tonight.

378
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,253
Your speech about drugs.

379
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,096
- You did, too.

380
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:11,900
- [Pam] Really?

381
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,143
- Yeah, we all thought so.

382
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,673
- Well thanks, that means a lot.

383
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,953
I'll see ya.

384
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,963
If you're really serious
about playing the guitar,

385
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,733
you just have to work
hard at it, you know?

386
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,133
- Yeah.

387
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,730
- Just remember, if you need something

388
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,520
bad enough and you don't give up

389
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,283
you can have anything you want.

390
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,850
It was nice to meet you.

391
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:46,799
- You, too.

426
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,953
- Well, it's Christmas time.

427
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:16,069
What would you prefer Casey At The Bat?

428
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:19,380

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,033

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,313

Or Mr. Toe.
- Will you please

433
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,453
just shut up.

434
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,170
Do you how idiotic you look
when you drink like this?

435
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,460
How many eggnogs have you had, Greg?

436
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,790
I mean, it's just disgusting.

437
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,910
You can't even hear anything I'm saying.

438
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,433
- Pam, that's enough.

439
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,363
- I'm sorry.

440
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:46,633
I just don't like it.

441
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,720
- Pam, I'm not an alcoholic.

442
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,540
I'm just trying to have a good time.

443
00:21:56,484 --> 00:21:57,317
Okay.

444
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,453
(loud knocking on door)

445
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:07,927
- Now what in God's name is that?

446
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:08,896
- I'll go get it.

447
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,813
(doorbell ringing)

448
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,620
Pam.

449
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,760
- Bill, he hit me.

450
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,322
- What?
- He hit me.

451
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:19,134
- Who, who hit you?
- Greg, just now.

452
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:20,750
- Oh, my god, Pam, are you alright?

453
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,750
What happened?
- He hit me.

454
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,300
That's what happened.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Pam.

455
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,133
I'm sorry.

456
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:45,390
- Greg.

457
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:49,271
Greg.

458
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:50,190
Greg, are you--

459
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,023
- Dad.

460
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,290
What are you doing here?

461
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,653
- Did you hit your wife?

462
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,750
- Did I what?

463
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,160
- [Bill] She's over at our house.

464
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,848
- Your house?

465
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,170
Well, how the hell she'd get there?

466
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,250
- She walked in the cold

467
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,430
after she says you hit her.

468
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,363
- I hit her!

469
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,321
Look, come on, dad.

470
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:11,920
You know, I'd never do that.

471
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,740
- Then what the hell
happened for crying out loud!

472
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,090
She's hysterical over there!
- I don't know.

473
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,450
Look, she was bitching at me

474
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,298
from the minute you dropped at us.

475
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:22,470
I mean, it was just
like it was in the car,

476
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,163
you remember, only worse.

477
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:28,240
And, I just wanted to crash, you know.

478
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,790
I told her that we'd
talk about it tomorrow

479
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,460
that right then all I
wanted to do was sleep.

480
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,610
But she wouldn't quilt.

481
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,530
She is standing in the
middle of the bathroom door.

482
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,550
She wouldn't let me by,

483
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,250
so I just pushed past her in the doorway.

484
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,290
I mean, okay, maybe I used the
side of my arm or something,

485
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,190
but I barely touched her for god sake.

486
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,540
I mean come on, dad, I know I'm blasting,

487
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,163
but I'm not comatose.

488
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,203
- Just go to bed.

489
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,723
Listen, you two are married now.

490
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,097
You've gotta resolve your
own problems, understand?

491
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:08,014
- Yes, sir.

492
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:24,990
(footsteps approaching)

493
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:29,550
- Are you sure you don't wanna

494
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,150
stay down there with us tonight?

495
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,023
- No, I'll be okay I just
wanna sleep in my own house.

496
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,724
- Okay.

497
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:42,474
If you need anything, just call us.

498
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,393
- Thank you.

499
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:56,355
(somber music)

500
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:10,750
- [Student] Mason, wait up.

501
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,340
- I know you guys have
classes, so I'll talk fast.

502
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,910
We need your help.

503
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,690
The Florida Citrus Council
is sponsoring this contest

504
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,720
for the most creative
commercial about orange juice.

505
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,620
There's the flyer.

506
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,150
But what I wanna do is
make it a music video.

507
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,930
- How can you make a music
video about orange juice?

508
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,980
- How can we not?

509
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,170
Think about it.

510
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,850
We get to be outrageous
or funny outrageous.

511
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,720
It says be creative.

512
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,120
We can use the school's equipment.

513
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,250
All we have to do is put our
minds together and go wild.

514
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,760
- Well, Billy knows how
to use a video camera.

515
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,480
Right, Billy?
- That's perfect.

516
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,860
What you don't know you'll learn.

517
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,640
- So, what if we win?

518
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,350
Who gets the free trip to Florida?

519
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,760
- It's for two, so Greg

520
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,290
my husband and I, would take the trip,

521
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,710
and we'll split the cash prize between us.

522
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,603
- Come on, you guys, it'll be fun.

523
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,760
- Okay, why not.
(school bell ringing)

524
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,700
- So, we'll get together
in a couple of days

525
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,720
talk about a concept?

526
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,620
Billy, are you in?

527
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,240
- Sure.
- Great.

528
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,380
Cecilia, can I talk to you for a minute.

529
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,288
- [Cecelia] I'll Up with you guys.

530
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:13,150
- [Cecelia's Friend] Okay.

531
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,590
- How would you like to be my intern?

532
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,030
You can work here eight
hours a week for credit.

533
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,470
- Are you kidding that would be unreal.

534
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,930
- Is that a yes?

535
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,870
- When would I start?

536
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,890

656
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,620

- No.

678
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,070
No, as a matter of fact, it's not okay.

679
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,240
Maybe it is about time we started

680
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,300
making an issue out of this.

681
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,220
I mean, you don't wanna
start having kids for a while

682
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,060
or until your career gets
off the ground, that's fine.

683

- To get myself a beer.

687
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,390
It's called oral gratification.

688
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,879
- It's also called getting a beer gut.

689
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,073
- What?
- Nothing.

690
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,750
- No.

691
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,200
What's that supposed to mean?

692
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,463
Pam!

00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,400
- Why did you marry Gregg Smart?

694
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,830
- Because I loved him.

695
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:04,547
I wanted to spend the
rest of my life with him.

696
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:05,509

697
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:07,731
the last part of what you said.

698
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:11,650
- I said, I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with him.

699
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,123
- What was it about him you loved?

700
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,020
- He was a very kind, gentle person.

701
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,283
He was a lot of fun to be around.

702
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:22,300

00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,620
- So, hold on her husband, right

717
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,710
I mean, where's he gonna
be in the guest room?

718
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,710
- Watching probably.

719
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,990
- No, Gregg is on ski vacation, okay.

720
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,620
She's all alone.

721
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,140
- He's just gonna leave her.

722
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,987
- She don't ski.

723
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,720
Besides they don't even get
along that well anymore.

724
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,140
Pam told me she wished
she didn't even marry him.

725
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,480
- So, you're telling us
that just you and Pam

726
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,380
are spending the night together alone?

727
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:32,750
- Well, Cecilia's gonna come along,

728
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,200
so it's not gonna look funny.

729
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,670
I'm telling you guys

730
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,973
she's crazy about me.

731
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,360
She invited me.

732
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,010
- Oh, so, you're gonna get it on?

733
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,583
- I hope so.

734
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:51,280
(car horn honking)

735
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,960
That's her, okay, remember,
you guys promised me.

736
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,397
- [J.R.] I'll call you
if your mother calls.

737
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:56,314
- [Billy] Okay, thanks.

738
00:37:12,758 --> 00:37:15,210
- I don't know, I think, it's weird, man.

739
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,310
She's like a teacher, and he's just a kid.

740
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,330
- You just wish it was you
instead of him, is all.

741
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,680
- No, way, man, I don't even like her.

742
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,407
She's like fake, phony.

743
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:28,688
(sultry music)

744
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,623
- See you guys.

'Cause, I'm really bored.

771
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:09,067
(Pamela and Billy moaning heavily)

772
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,920
- [Pam] Was last night first time?

773
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:28,398
- No.

774
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:30,940
("Soul Taker")

775
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,940
- Well, I'm no virgin either, but...

776
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,590
It was like, um

777
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,670
magical.

778
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,503
- For me too.

779
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,823
- Really.

780
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,483
Why?

781
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,330
- I don't know, you.

782
00:40:54,345 --> 00:40:56,595
- [Pam] What, what, I what?

783
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:05,426
- You're everything a
woman supposed to be.

784
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,613
- Billy.

785
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,235
- [Billy] Pam, what's wrong?

786
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:16,627
- I'm just...

787
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:17,890
I'm so happy with you.

788
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,880
All I want is you.

789
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,140
- Me too, Pam.

790
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,193
All I want is you.

791
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:25,144
- But I don't think we can do this again.

792
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:29,940
- What?

793
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,393
- Because Gregg goes away
like that very, very rarely,

794
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,270
and I'd wanna be with you all the time.

795
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,730
- Why don't you just divorce him, Pam.

796
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,230
Then we can be together forever.

797
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,683
- I would in a minute,
bud he'd take everything.

798
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,583
It's all in his name, the car, the house.

799
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,643
And he can be mean, Billy.

800
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,790
If I left him, he'd go mad.

801
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,883
He'd get revenge,

802
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,893
take the dog.

803
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,560
He might even try to hurt me.

804
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,510
- What do you mean?

805
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,320
- Sometimes he gets drunk,

806
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,283
and he yells and screams
and throws things.

807
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,010
He tried to hit me once.

808
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,213
- Pam, you gotta get
yourself out of there.

809
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:23,966
- I would.

810
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:25,633
If I could, I would.

811
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:27,903
But I can't.

812
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:40,844
I feel so safe with you.

813
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,977
Will you help me?

814
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,270
- I'll do anything you say.

815
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,463
- Do you know anyone
who would kill someone?

816
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,310
- What do you mean?

817
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,870
- Greg.

818
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,540
Do you know anyone who would kill Greg?

819
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,583
It's the only way we can be together.

820
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,180
It's the only way.

821
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,210
- So, before I announce the awards

822
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,160
for this year's top sales reps,

823
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,840
let me ask you a question?

824
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,490
How many brokers does it
take to change a light bulb?

825
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,620
Well, the answer's two.

826
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,330
One to change it, and
one to write the policy

827
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,541
in case of fire, wreckage,
or electrocution.

828
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:43,030
(crowd muttering)
(Gregg cackling sarcastically)

829
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,528
It took me all winter
to think that one up.

830
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:49,770
Now, this year marks the first time ever

831
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,060
that a company rookie has won the award,

832
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,880
and it's the first time ever

833
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,460
that a father-son team have won together.

834
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,470
Of course, you know who I'm talking about.

835
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,210
Bill Smart, our favorite senior

836
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,359
and Gregg Smart, our fabulous freshman.

837
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:03,521
- [Man] Attaboy, Bill.

838
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:04,354
(crowd applauding)

839
00:44:04,354 --> 00:44:06,490
- Pam better take you
out to celebrate this.

840
00:44:25,634 --> 00:44:27,870
- Have you figured it out yet?

841
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,036
- What?

842
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:29,869
- How to do it?

843
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,133
- Do what?

844
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,710
- Make it so you and me could
be together without Greg.

845
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:49,670
- It's I don't understand

846
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,663
why you can't just divorce that guy?

847
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,270
- He would never us alone.

848
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,033
He'd follow us around, really.

849
00:44:59,255 --> 00:45:00,980
I was only doing this for us, Billy.

850
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,510
I mean, I don't know I
thought you loved me.

851
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,025
- Pam, I do love you.
(Pam gasping)

852
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:05,858
What happened?

853
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:06,780
- What do you think happened?

854
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,223
I told you he's mean to me, okay.

855
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,883
- Pam, he hits you.

856
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:14,370
Gregg hits you.
- Between that

857
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,690
and not being able to
see you all the time,

858
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,560
I don't think I can do this.

859
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,413
- That bastard I'll kill him myself.

860
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,303
- You will.

861
00:45:23,146 --> 00:45:25,496
- I didn't realize how
bad things were for you.

862
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:28,703
Pam, I'm sorry.

863
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,343
I'm so sorry.

864
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,193
It's okay.

865
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,530
- Don't worry I'm not gonna
make you do this by yourself.

866
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,280
I'm gonna help you work out the details.

867
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,440
The main thing Billy
is after you kill him,

868
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,890
we can be together

869
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,533
just you and me for good.

870
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,770
That's all that counts.

871
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,763
Now next Tuesday I have an AOC meeting.

872
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,110
Gregg has one of his evening appointments

873
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,060
until about nine o'clock.

874
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,750
He gets home like 9:30, 10:00.

875
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,830
Basically, you have to make
it look like a burglary.

876
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,293
You can take stuff out of
the house and everything.

877
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,350
You have to tie your hair
back and wear all black

878
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,850
that way in case anyone sees you,

879
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,050
you can't be identified.

880
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,420
I'll come right back here to my office,

881
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,613
and wait for you to call
and tell me what happened.

882
00:46:26,762 --> 00:46:27,662
Do you have a gun?

883
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,803
- No.
- Can you get one?

884
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,110
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

885
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,250
Look are you gonna do this or not?

886
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,660
- Pam, I'm gonna do this.

887
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,199
Okay, I promise.
- You guys.

888
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:39,340
You know, how come you're
talking about this stuff.

889
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,940
You're not really serious right?

890
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,610
- We're just tying to figure out

891
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,080
how me and Billy can be together.

892
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,220
That's all we're just
trying to figure it out.

893
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,570
- But you're not really
gonna do it, right?

894
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,663
I mean, kill Greg?

895
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,723
I mean, you can't kill Greg.

896
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,733
That would be crazy.

897
00:47:00,509 --> 00:47:03,009
(tense music)

898
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:23,828
(heavy metal music blaring)

899
00:47:34,582 --> 00:47:37,749
(soft dramatic music)

900
00:47:47,126 --> 00:47:50,360
(telephone ringing)

901
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,293
- Media center.

902
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:53,923
- It's me.

903
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,633
- What happened?

904
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,213
Did you do it?

905
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,613
- Well, not exactly.

906
00:48:04,729 --> 00:48:05,810
You see, I didn't find a gun.

907
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,381
And, nobody wanted to give me their car

908
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:08,823
'cause I don't have a license.

909
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,890
- You mean, you didn't even go out there?

910
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,060
- Well, I was gonna.

911
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:14,910
- [Pam] But what?

912
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,050
How the hell could you do this?

913
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,093
You promised me.

914
00:48:19,195 --> 00:48:20,913
- Pam, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

915
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,750
What was all that crap about loving me

916
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,020
about Gregg being a bastard?

917
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,890
Was all that just so you could

918
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,790
get into my pants one more time?

919
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,320
- No, Pam, I do love you.

920
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,670
- Greg, can get nuts and
slap me around all he wants.

921
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,810
As long as little Billy gets to

922
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,400
get it on with the teacher, right?

923
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,890
- [Billy] No, Pam don't say that.

924
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:42,130
- Well, that's it we're through.

925
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,847
Do you understand?

926
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:45,247
- Come on, Pam, I need you.

927
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,550
(telephone ringing)

928
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,343
- Go on in, it's okay.

929
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,143
- Come here.

930
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,533
Come here.

931
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,379
It's okay.

932
00:49:53,379 --> 00:49:54,212
It's okay.

933
00:49:54,212 --> 00:49:55,593
Everything's okay, come on.

934
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,950
I have another meeting
at the end of April.

935
00:50:01,997 --> 00:50:03,697
I'm gonna give you another chance.

936
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,573
- Are you nuts?

937
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,330
You wanna kill a guy that
you've never even met.

938
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:15,770
- He hits her.

939
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,050
He abuses her.

940
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,100
- [J.R.] You see him?

941
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,873
- She told me.

942
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,020
- Great.

943
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,570
- I've seen the bruises.

944
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,663
- Come on.

945
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,730
- As long as he's around,

946
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,220
me and Pam can't ever be together.

947
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,370
- You sure she really
wants you to do this?

948
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,960
- Wants me to, she's making me.

949
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,173
Otherwise she says she's gonna
break the whole thing off.

950
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,593
I need a gun.

951
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:58,990
J.R., your dad's got guns.

952
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,240
You gonna help me or not?

953
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,163
- Help you kill a guy?

954
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,910
- I'll help you.

955
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,640
My dad's got a gun.

956
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,420
Don't even know where it is, but I do.

957
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,230
- Get real, Raymond.

958
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,750
Guns can be traced.

959
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,100
- She said, "It'll be
worth a thousand bucks."

960
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,023
- She'll pay us.

961
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:19,843
- Yeah.

962
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,745
- What do you think?

963
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:26,633
- I think, this is nuts.

964
00:51:41,106 --> 00:51:44,189
(car engine revving)

965
00:52:02,842 --> 00:52:05,342
(tense music)

966
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,900
- Well, congratulations.

967
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,010
Now that you have our approval
for your media course.

968
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,180
The full board can vote
on funding next month.

969
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,810
- I never would've gotten
this far without your support.

970
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:15,670
Thanks so much.

971
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,503
- Oh, it was my pleasure.

972
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:17,336
Are you going to your car?

973
00:52:17,336 --> 00:52:19,020
- No, I'm gonna pick up
something in my office.

974
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,570
Goodnight.
- See you tomorrow.

975
00:52:36,911 --> 00:52:39,994
(door creaking open)

976
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,703
- [Pam] Don't turn on the light.

977
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,820
- Pam, this is Raymond.

978
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,783
- Hi, Raymond.

979
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,963
So, did you do it?

980
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,500
- Well, Greg, was already
there when we got there,

981
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,297
so we didn't go in.

982
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:19,660
- What he never gets
home before 9:30, never.

983
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,453
- We didn't get there till after.

984
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,693
- Well, actually, we got lost.

985
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:30,783
- Lost?

986
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,420
- I'm sorry, Pam.

987
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:42,725
- Well, next time.

988
00:53:42,725 --> 00:53:44,275
Come on, I'll drop you two off.

989
00:53:47,067 --> 00:53:50,734
(heavy metal music blaring)

990
00:54:09,528 --> 00:54:11,970
Now what the hell happened out there?

991
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:13,730
- I told you, Pam, we
just got lost is all.

992
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,760
- You expect me to believe that.

993
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,630
Lost going to my house.

994
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:18,890
I guess the nights we spent there

995
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:19,910
didn't mean a hell of a lot to you.

996
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,360
You can't even remember how to get there.

997
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,193
- No, Pam.

998
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,026
- Either you're a coward

999
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:25,630
or you never really loved me, which is it?

1000
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,040
- I do love you.
- So you're a coward.

1001
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,750
- No.
- Right, you never loved me,

1002
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,190
which is good, because you make me sick.

1003
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,023
Get out.

1004
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:35,923
- Wait, Pam.

1005
00:54:37,463 --> 00:54:38,690
Pam, I just got lost.

1006
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,180
I promise, that's all.

1007
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,126
- Yeah, fine, sure.

1008
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:43,790
Look I'm gonna tell Gregg everything

1009
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,523
and just beg his forgiveness.

1010
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,490
He'll probably be horrible for a while,

1011
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,840
but eventually we'll work it out.

1012
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,690
Enough is enough.

1013
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,750
- [Billy] Please, I need
you in my life, I swear.

1014
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,330
- There's one way to make that happen,

1015
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,740
and you blew it both times.

1016
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,150
- Just one more chance, Pam, please.

1017
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,983
- I don't know.

1018
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,010
- Aren't you gonna take me home?

1019
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,340
- I don't want your mother to see us.

1020
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,040
No one works on a video this late.

1021
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:16,618
(somber music)

1022
00:55:19,976 --> 00:55:22,893
(tires screeching)

1023
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,053
- If I lose Pam,

1024
00:55:30,676 --> 00:55:33,180
I swear I don't know what I'll do.

1025
00:55:34,947 --> 00:55:35,780
I know what I'll do.

1026
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,923
I'll kill myself.

1027
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,013
If I lose Pam,

1028
00:55:52,262 --> 00:55:53,429
I kill myself.

1029
00:56:12,111 --> 00:56:14,090
They want a thousand each.

1030
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:15,890
- I can only spend a thousand total.

1031
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:21,933
Okay.

1032
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,400
You can get in the car now, if you want?

1033
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:39,589
(heavy metal music blaring)

1034
00:56:49,313 --> 00:56:50,500
Hey, J.R., slow down.

1035
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,250
The last thing we need is a ticket.

1036
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,420
Here's directions to my house,

1037
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,430
so you don't get lost again for god sake.

1038
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,930
See, I'm giving them to Billy.

1039
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:04,520
Memorize them and then destroy the paper.

1040
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,880
You got it?

1041
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,772
Where's the gun?

1042
00:57:06,772 --> 00:57:08,600
- It's right here.

1043
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,240
- Make sure you use it and not a knife.

1044
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,410
No knives.
- What if--

1045
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,440
- No ifs knives are messy.

1046
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,070
You'll get blood on the
furniture and the carpet.

1047
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,127
There's all these light colors,
and blood never comes out.

1048
00:57:18,127 --> 00:57:18,960
Now, don't forget the gloves.

1049
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,660
We don't want fingerprints
all over the place.

1050
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,010
I left a bunch of gold chains and stuff

1051
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,880
in the jewelry box, which you can keep.

1052
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,867
And, Billy knows where the speakers are.

1053
00:57:28,437 --> 00:57:30,410
Make sure you put Haley
in the basement, okay?

1054
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,560
The last thing I need
is a traumatized dog.

1055
00:57:33,598 --> 00:57:35,052
- You left the bolted
door unlocked, right?

1056
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:36,110
- Right.

1057
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,970
Listen, I don't know if...

1058
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,300
I mean, like what should
I do when I get home?

1059
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,290
You know, should I just
like scream out right

1060
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:45,660
and run for the neighbors
or call the police or what?

1061
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,863
- Just, you know, act natural.

1062
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,530
- They're really gonna do
it this time, Bill and them.

1063
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,530
- Do what?

1064
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,920
- Kill Greg.

1065
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,810
- Uh-huh.

1066
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:58,790
- They have a gun.

1067
00:57:58,790 --> 00:57:59,640
- From where?

1068
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,530
- J.R.'s father had it.

1069
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:02,543
Oh, god I gotta go.

1070
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,830
Stop by later.

1071
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:06,420
I'm working straight
through to my meeting.

1072
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,670
By the time I get out,
it should all be over.

1073
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,450
- [Pete] We taking Raymond?

1074
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,720
- Yeah man.

1075
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,913
I don't wanna be alone
in the car all that time.

1076
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,449
Hey, Raymond.

1077
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:43,523
- Well, now all we gotta do is
just wait till it gets dark.

1078
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:45,630
- Alright, well, I'm gonna go over to

1079
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,140
Papa Gino's to use the
bathroom, all right.

1080
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,483
- Me too.
- Same here.

1081
00:58:49,483 --> 00:58:50,933
- Hey, anybody got any money?

1082
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:55,533
Might as well get a pizza as
long as we're gonna be there.

1083
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,390
- Hi, Mrs. Davis.

1084
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,600
Hi, I'm Gregg Smart from
Northeastern Fidelity.

1085
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,508
We talked on the phone.

1086
00:59:01,508 --> 00:59:02,450
- Right, right.

1087
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:03,756
Come on in.
- Thank you.

1088
00:59:03,756 --> 00:59:06,623
- Bob, it's that guy
from the insurance place.

1089
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,910
- Item seven: Cost of living increase

1090
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:11,650
in salary for nontenured faculty,

1091
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,430
and finally a recommendation
from the Winnacunnet Board

1092
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,990
that funds be set aside for
a media course to be taught

1093
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:23,070
in the fall semester by the
current school media director,

1094
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,793
Mrs. Pamela Smart.

1095
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:33,005
(thunder roaring)

1096
00:59:33,005 --> 00:59:36,255
(tense dramatic music)

1097
01:00:15,313 --> 01:00:17,557
- Take it easy, man, we won't use the gun.

1098
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:19,257
It's just for back up, no problem.

1099
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,123
- I'm fine.

1100
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:24,463
- Let's do this.

1101
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,330
- Well, now, Greg, you made a sale.

1102
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:43,160
Now you can call it quits for
the night and get on home.

1103
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,180
Too much works's a bad thing.

1104
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,926
- How would you know?

1105
01:00:46,926 --> 01:00:49,040
- See what you've got to look forward to.

1106
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,530
- Well, at least your home
is better protected now.

1107
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,900
I thank you both very, very much.

1108
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,950
Please if you have any questions,

1109
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,640
don't hesitate to call
me I'm always available.

1110
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,061
- We'll keep it in mind.
- Thank you.

1111
01:00:58,061 --> 01:01:00,144
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1112
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,834
(Haley barking)

1113
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,334
- It's okay, Haley, it's okay.

1114
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,150
- Alright, then if no one else
has anything further to add,

1115
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:01,950
may I please see a show
of hands for funding

1116
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:05,163
Mrs. Smart's media class of
Winnacunnet in September.

1117
01:02:14,662 --> 01:02:16,773
- I can't believe this.

1118
01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:18,200
I mean, the jewelry she left us

1119
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,123
is worth about fifty cents.

1120
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:22,700
What a hoax job.

1121
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,800
- Relax, Pete, let's get going, all right.

1122
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:31,065
(suspenseful music)

1123
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,050
Maybe, we should use these.

1124
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,400
- Maybe we should use this.

1125
01:02:57,928 --> 01:03:01,595
(heavy metal music blaring)

1126
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:13,910
- Alright, Pete.

1127
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:15,883
I can hide behind the kitchen doorway.

1128
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,570
- I'll be behind the front door.

1129
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:21,502
When he comes in, I'll
jump him, pull him in,

1130
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:24,169
and then, you know, we'll do it.

1131
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:56,032
- He's here.

1132
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:56,865
Pete!

1133
01:03:58,175 --> 01:03:59,135
He's here!

1134
01:03:59,135 --> 01:03:59,968
He's here!

1135
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:04,404
(suspenseful music)

1136
01:04:12,923 --> 01:04:13,756
- Haley.

1137
01:04:16,038 --> 01:04:17,122
Here boy.

1138
01:04:17,122 --> 01:04:17,955
Haley.

1139
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,263
Haley.

1140
01:04:23,178 --> 01:04:25,595
(gun firing)

1141
01:05:12,135 --> 01:05:12,968
- Greg.

1142
01:05:22,887 --> 01:05:24,445
Help!

1143
01:05:24,445 --> 01:05:25,518
Help, please!

1144
01:05:25,518 --> 01:05:26,768
Somebody, help!

1145
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,750
- What's happening here?

1146
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:33,583
Where is Gregg Smart?

1147
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:34,580
He's our son.
- Excuse me, sir.

1148
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,413
- No, we've gotta get in there.

1149
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:36,800
- [Officer] Sorry, sir, no one's allowed.

1150
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,330
- We're not no one this is my son's place.

1151
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:39,380
Just tell me what the
hell's going on here.

1152
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,540
Is my son alright?

1153
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,950
- I can't tell you anything, sir.

1154
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:45,390
- For god sake he's
right there on the floor.

1155
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:46,223
Well, help him somebody.

1156
01:05:46,223 --> 01:05:47,320
Why aren't they helping him?

1157
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,153
- He's dead.

1158
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,721
- I've got to go to him.

1159
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:51,972
He's my son!

1160
01:05:51,972 --> 01:05:54,319
Let me go to him, please!

1161
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:55,689
Please!

1162
01:05:55,689 --> 01:05:58,313
Please!

1163
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,330
(man mumbling softly)

1164
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:04,163
Oh, thank you.

1165
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,880
Pam.

1166
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,830
- Could someone call my mother, please.

1167
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,450
And would someone get the dog?

1168
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:28,620
Could someone go to my house
and get the dog, please?

1169
01:06:31,361 --> 01:06:33,944
(somber music)

1170
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,493
- Come on in.

1171
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,803
Sit anywhere.

1172
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,020
I called you in here because

1173
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,320
I wanted you to hear this from me

1174
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,713
before the media starts
trumpeting it about.

1175
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:58,363
There's been a tragedy.

1176
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:02,713
Now I know how close you
all are with Pam Smart.

1177
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,400
Well, her husband was killed last night.

1178
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,543
He was, in fact, murdered.

1179
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,303
- Oh, my god, that's awful.

1180
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:20,123
- Oh, man.

1181
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,410
Do they know who did it?

1182
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,720
- I haven't heard anything about that.

1183
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,880
Yet, I do think though

1184
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,840
that we should all go to the wake together

1185
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,513
and show Pam some support.

1186
01:07:32,768 --> 01:07:35,351
(somber music)

1187
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:44,260
- Oh, Pam.

1188
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,750
- Thank you so much for coming.

1189
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,320
It's so thoughtful of you, really.

1190
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,650
It's so nice.
- Thank you.

1191
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:49,750
Are you alright?

1192
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,980
- Yeah, it's just shock, you know.

1193
01:07:54,182 --> 01:07:55,015
Hi.

1194
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:01,620
Thanks for coming.

1195
01:08:03,347 --> 01:08:05,120
- [Captain] Did anybody have any kind of a

1196
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,670
grudge against your husband?

1197
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,840
- No, absolutely not.

1198
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,520
Gregg was very popular, very loved.

1199
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,637
He had a lot of wonderful friends.

1200
01:08:12,637 --> 01:08:16,290
- Any involvement with drugs of any kind?

1201
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:19,500
- Never, neither he nor
I believed in drugs.

1202
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,560
Do you think this is drug related

1203
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,710
because I heard that on the news.

1204
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:26,803
I tell you it really disturbs
me because it's just false.

1205
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:31,110
You think this was drug
related; is that it?

1206
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:35,790
- There is no it, Mrs.
Smart, only possibilities.

1207
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:37,103
- You can rule out drugs.

1208
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,380
I mean, the television and
the jewelry were all gone.

1209
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,210
What about burglary?

1210
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:44,043
- Maybe.

1211
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,200
Did you husband ever exhibit

1212
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,127
any violent behavior of any kind?

1213
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:50,400
- No, never.

1214
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,830
- [Detective] How about to you?

1215
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,640
- No, I said never.

1216
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,970
- Mrs. Smart, we realize that

1217
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:57,000
this is very difficult for you.

1218
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,712
We just have to be thorough.

1219
01:08:58,712 --> 01:09:01,230
- Well, I agree with that,
I think, you should be.

1220
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:05,810
- Okay, let's see you
were married what, a year?

1221
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,300
- Not quite.
- Happily?

1222
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,600
- Very happily, ask anyone.

1223
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,520
- Was Gregg ever abusive
to you in any way?

1224
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,823
- Look, that's just not possible.

1225
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:20,880
Gregg was a very kind, gentle
soul, especially to me.

1226
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,883
He loved me, and I loved him.

1227
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,843
The only thing I can ever think of

1228
01:09:27,843 --> 01:09:30,533
that we fought about was
what to have for dinner.

1229
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:32,690
- I see.

1230
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,740
- I hope that you do.

1231
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:37,780
- Well, that'll be all for now.

1232
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,670
We'll be in touch.

1233
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:42,410
Oh, please don't mention anything

1234
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:44,440
to the media about this case.

1235
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,983
It'll just hinder the investigation, okay.

1236
01:09:48,453 --> 01:09:49,500
- [Reporter] This okay for you, Pam

1237
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,390
right in front of the house right here?

1238
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,610
- I think so.
- In the walk way

1239
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:53,422
it's better than inside.
- I think so, don't you?

1240
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,810
- [Reporter] Yeah, I mean,
the parents are in there.

1241
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:56,643
It's quiet out here.

1242
01:09:56,643 --> 01:09:58,600
You know about this stuff, right?

1243
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,320
Television, you studied communications.

1244
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,470
- [Pam] Right.

1245
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:02,950
- Can you move that mic
up just a little bit, Jim

1246
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,330
just a little bit close to her face,

1247
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:06,640
you know, so we can hear
what she has to say.

1248
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,980
- You're wondering about the dress, right?

1249
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,440
Gregg gave me this dress.

1250
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,800
He loved it.

1251
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,633
- Don't worry about that.

1252
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:12,810
You look absolutely beautiful.

1253
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:15,160
I mean, you're holding up remarkably well.

1254
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,170
I can't believe how well you're doing.

1255
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:18,360
I really don't know how you do it.

1256
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,720
- I'm really not sure myself

1257
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,420
where the strength is coming from.

1258
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:24,240
Should I start that part again?

1259
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,843
- I'm sorry, could you, yeah.

1260
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,740
- I'm really not sure myself

1261
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,550
where the strength is coming from.

1262
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:31,860
From Greg, I think.

1263
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,080
It's as if he's inside me

1264
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,550
helping me bear up and go on.

1265
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:37,660
- Yeah, listen this morning

1266
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,020
when you called to request this interview

1267
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,231
you said something about
setting the record straight.

1268
01:10:42,231 --> 01:10:44,420
Can you tell us what you meant by that?

1269
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,980
- Set the record straight
is absolutely right.

1270
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,530
I think the media has got this all wrong.

1271
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:50,363
They're making it sound like

1272
01:10:50,363 --> 01:10:52,653
my husband was killed by drug dealers.

1273
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,830
I think, this was a burglary.

1274
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,370
That's what makes it so awful.

1275
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:58,743
It was just a senseless thing.

1276
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,020
Thank you, very much.

1277
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:02,853
Bye, bye.
- Thanks.

1278
01:11:02,853 --> 01:11:04,760
- I'll see you guys back in the van.

1279
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,593
Listen, Pam, let me ask you

1280
01:11:05,593 --> 01:11:06,740
just one more thing off the record.

1281
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:07,960
I'm not gonna use this.

1282
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,506
But, why did you happen to call me,

1283
01:11:10,506 --> 01:11:11,850
I mean, out of all the
people you could've called?

1284
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,250
- [Pam] Oh, your my favorite newscaster.

1285
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,880
I watch your reports all the time,

1286
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,430
and I know what goes into it, believe me.

1287
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,660
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1288
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,910
We should talk sometime
also about the business.

1289
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:21,743
- We'll do that.
- Okay.

1290
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:22,576
- Thanks.

1291
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,960
- There's a call on line two.

1292
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,370
I think you're gonna wanna hear.

1293
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:29,762
- Two.
- Yep.

1294
01:11:29,762 --> 01:11:31,429
- [Detective] Okay.

1295
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,730
- I'm sorry, go ahead, miss.

1296
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:36,890
You said you had some information

1297
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,530
on the Greggory Smart murder.

1298
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:39,363
- [Girl] Yes.

1299
01:11:39,363 --> 01:11:41,720
- Would you identify yourself, please?

1300
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,660
- [Girl] I'd rather not, if that's okay.

1301
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,493
- That's okay.

1302
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:47,510
I'll take down any
information that you have.

1303
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:51,430
- [Girl] Well, I work
at Papa Gino's pizza.

1304
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:54,123
- Oh, the one over in
Seabrook or the other one?

1305
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:57,290
- [Cecelia] Well, if I
tell you that, then--

1306
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:00,710
- Right, all right,
that's okay, that's okay.

1307
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:02,650
So, you work at Papa Gino's.

1308
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:04,630
- [Girl] Yes, and there's this girl

1309
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:06,830
that works there Cecelia Pierce.

1310
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,440
- [Detective] Yes, we've talked to her.

1311
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,420
- [Girl] You did?

1312
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,933
- Yes, but go on.

1313
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,240
What is it that you know.

1314
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,900
- [Girl] Oh, okay.

1315
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,400
Anyway, I don't know when it was,

1316
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,530
but it was about a
month before the murder,

1317
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:21,450
the Gregg Smart murder.

1318
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:23,250
She told me she knew a
teacher at Winnacunnet

1319
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,580
who was paying someone
to kill her husband.

1320
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,610
All the time I thought like,

1321
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:28,123
boy, is this crazy or what.

1322
01:12:28,123 --> 01:12:29,620
But, now with all that's happened

1323
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:30,960
I thought that maybe, you know

1324
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,400
that it was true or something.

1325
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,233
- Right.

1326
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:44,070
- I told you I don't know.

1327
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:45,409
I told you.

1328
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:47,510
- I'm telling you we don't believe you.

1329
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,610
- Well, I guess, that's just your problem.

1330
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,170
- It could become your
problem in about five minutes

1331
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,760
if we decide to go across the hall

1332
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,630
and officially charge you
with harboring a criminal.

1333
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:59,960
- We have an informant that told us

1334
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,406
that you have information
about the murder.

1335
01:13:02,406 --> 01:13:03,250
- Who said that?

1336
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,974
- It doesn't matter who.

1337
01:13:04,974 --> 01:13:05,980
It matters that they did.

1338
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,990
- They lied.

1339
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,870
I don't know anything.

1340
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,578
(heavy sighing)

1341
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:16,190
- You got an appointment or something.

1342
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,671
- I'm supposed to be at driver's ed.

1343
01:13:18,671 --> 01:13:20,710
- Well, excuse us.

1344
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:23,333
I mean, please, accept our apologies.

1345
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,013
- Cecilia.

1346
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,960
We'll be talking to you again.

1347
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,793
I promise.

1348
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:39,893
- How did it go?

1349
01:13:40,747 --> 01:13:41,580
What did they ask you?

1350
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:42,413
Did they grill you?

1351
01:13:47,809 --> 01:13:50,809
(telephone ringing)

1352
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:53,683
- Hello.

1353
01:13:53,683 --> 01:13:54,620
- [Pam] Hi, it's Pam.

1354
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,140
- Oh, hi.

1355
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:58,440
- I'm sorry to bother you.

1356
01:14:00,998 --> 01:14:03,198
I was just sitting here
thinking about Greg.

1357
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,260
I feel like I'm literally
going out of my mind.

1358
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,130
- I know, dear.

1359
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:10,233
I'm in the same boat.

1360
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,090
- I can't sleep without him.

1361
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:16,163
I don't wanna eat anything without him.

1362
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:24,210
I don't know I feel sometimes

1363
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,853
like I just wanna call it quits, you know

1364
01:14:26,853 --> 01:14:30,220
I just wanna find someway to end it all.

1365
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,950
- No, Pam, you stop that.

1366
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,930
That's no answer.

1367
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:34,763
- I know.

1368
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:38,250
By the way, have you heard

1369
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,003
anything about the investigation?

1370
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:43,850
I know Billy Captain Jackson are close.

1371
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:46,713
But, the police's just
completely shutting me out.

1372
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,590
They won't tell me anything.

1373
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,730
I was just wondering.

1374
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:51,980
- So, then, Flynn and Randall

1375
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,090
come running across the field,

1376
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,650
falling down and everything, right.

1377
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:56,176
They finally get to the car and get in.

1378
01:14:56,176 --> 01:14:57,240
I mean, Lattime and me are just like,

1379
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,930
you know, "Did you do it or what?"

1380
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:00,580
Pete's like, "Yeah, man,
let's get out of here."

1381
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,530
Billy's just you know like,
"We did it, killed the guy."

1382
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:06,338
So, we take off, and I start singing.

1383
01:15:06,338 --> 01:15:08,742
♪ Shoo fly don't bother me ♪

1384
01:15:08,742 --> 01:15:10,560
♪ Shoo fly don't bother me ♪

1385
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,404
Only just to calm them down.

1386
01:15:12,404 --> 01:15:13,290
But they don't think it's funny,

1387
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:14,570
and Pete tells me to shut up.

1388
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:16,140
So, what can I do.

1389
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,880
You know, they looked they needed it.

1390
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,260
They were nervous freaking out,

1391
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,577
killed a guy, you know.

1392
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:30,630
(dog barking)

1393
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,060
- [Man] Billy Flynn up there.

1394
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,870
- Uh-uh, just J.R. and Pete.

1395
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,130
- You see Flynn you tell him he ought to

1396
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,880
bust Raymond Fowler in the mouth.

1397
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,713
- Why is that?

1398
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:48,180
- He's been going around
telling all of Seabrook

1399
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,270
that Billy and them were the ones

1400
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:51,013
that killed that teacher's husband.

1401
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:57,953
- Come on cut the crap!

1402
01:16:01,222 --> 01:16:02,070
Now tell me the truth.

1403
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,913
I gotta know.

1404
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,313
Did you do it?

1405
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,440
- How do you think I got these speakers?

1406
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,173
- We got $500 each Ralph.

1407
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:21,193
Pam told Billy she gets
a $140,000 insurance.

1408
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:25,020
I mean, like, this guy's
worth more dead than alive.

1409
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,420
- I grew up with you guys.

1410
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:37,963
Sorry about the time, sir.

1411
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:47,053
- It's just been cleaned, real recently.

1412
01:16:49,385 --> 01:16:51,634
- I'm sorry about this.

1413
01:16:51,634 --> 01:16:52,483
I'm real sorry.

1414
01:16:53,966 --> 01:16:57,216
(tense dramatic music)

1415
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:06,723
- This is my firearm.

1416
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:08,943
It's registered and all.

1417
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:11,400
Anyway, I think, it's a weapon

1418
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,400
that was used in the Gregg Smart murder.

1419
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,240
- Good evening, our lead story tonight

1420
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,710
a major breakthrough in a
case that has captivated

1421
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:24,270
New England, the Greggory
Smart murder case.

1422
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:26,170
Just hours ago, three boys,

1423
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:28,060
all of them students at
Winnacunnet High School,

1424
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,750
were arrested in Seabrook.

1425
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,450
There's also an unconfirmed report

1426
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,840
that there may soon be a fourth arrest,

1427
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,470
a young female friend of the boys

1428
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:37,800
who may have actually
driven a car to Derry

1429
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,150
the night of May 1st,
the night Gregg Smart

1430
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:42,000
was so brutally murdered in his home.

1431
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,913
(gentle music)

1432
01:18:05,838 --> 01:18:08,470
- Kind of late for all, isn't it?

1433
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:11,120
- I believe, my daughter
has some things to tell you.

1434
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:14,003
- Is that right?

1435
01:18:17,256 --> 01:18:18,256
Well, come right in.

1436
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,990
- [Detective] Now you'll just ask the same

1437
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,370
kind of questions we just went over.

1438
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:28,441
All you do is just act natural with her

1439
01:18:28,441 --> 01:18:30,691
the way you've always been.

1440
01:18:42,308 --> 01:18:44,891
(soft sobbing)

1441
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:09,744
- All I can say is no matter

1442
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:11,460
what they try and make you talk about

1443
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,970
if I were you I didn't know a damn thing.

1444
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:15,510
- All I know is I had
to come and talk to you

1445
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:18,150
because, I mean, I don't know what to do.

1446
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:20,810
I have to go and talk
to the attorney general.

1447
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:22,800
I'm just so sick of lying, you know.

1448
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,300
- Well, that's fine all I'm
saying is if you tell the truth,

1449
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,250
you're gonna be an accessory to murder.

1450
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,130
- Right.

1451
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:30,380
- So, that's your choice.

1452
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,050
And not only that, but what's
your family gonna think.

1453
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,240
They're gonna be like, Cecilia,

1454
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,963
you know about this ahead of time.

1455
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1456
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,670
And everybody in town too.

1457
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:41,670
I mean, if I were you--

1458
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:43,580
- Okay.
- Once you say no,

1459
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,413
they leave you alone.

1460
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:47,180
Once you say yes, they
never leave you alone.

1461
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:48,480
- But they're gonna subpoena me, Pam.

1462
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,150
I know they are.

1463
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:51,640
I hate this.

1464
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,860
What if I lie on the
stand, and they find out?

1465
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:55,190
- How are they gonna do that?

1466
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,680
- [Cecelia] If someone
says that I did know.

1467
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,270
- Who the hell is gonna say that?

1468
01:19:58,270 --> 01:19:59,480
- I don't know, J.R.

1469
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,050
Does he know what I know?

1470
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:01,930
- Even if he did know,

1471
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,240
it's his word against yours.

1472
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,723
They can't prove a thing.

1473
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,780
- But what I was saying is

1474
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,960
obviously, I knew about it beforehand.

1475
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,180
If I go up there and lie

1476
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,680
and they find out about it
after, I'm in big trouble.

1477
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,080
- So, that's my point.

1478
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,240
So, you're better off just
lying about it to begin with.

1479
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,430
Just stick to your story
that's the best way.

1480
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:21,960
And, of course, probably J.R.
is gonna roll any day now.

1481
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,320
He was supposedly only in
the car, but who knows.

1482
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,517
So, he's gonna be like, "Well, screw this.

1483
01:20:27,517 --> 01:20:28,750
"I'm not gonna go to jail forever,"

1484
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:30,800
and turn against them and blame me.

1485
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,633
- Right.

1486
01:20:31,633 --> 01:20:34,017
- But, I mean, hell I
never said any words like,

1487
01:20:34,017 --> 01:20:36,677
"J.R., I'm gonna pay you to kill Greg.

1488
01:20:36,677 --> 01:20:37,807
"I never said that."

1489
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,740
Who's a jury gonna believe,

1490
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:42,483
J.R., the 16-year-old
kid in the slammer or me?

1491
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:44,880
I'm a teacher.

1492
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,130
They're gonna believe me.

1493
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,420
Oh, hi, this is a surprise.

1494
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:58,330
- [Captain] Oh, I'm sorry.

1495
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:00,380
We really couldn't call first.

1496
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,770
- It doesn't matter I'm just
in a middle of a few things.

1497
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,010
- [Captain] Keeping busy, huh?

1498
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:05,010
- Well, yeah.

1499
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:05,843
You too, right?

1500
01:21:05,843 --> 01:21:07,010
- [Captain] Always.

1501
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:08,140
- [Detective] Too busy.

1502
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:08,973
- Right.

1503
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,253
- Listen, Pam, would you mind standing up?

1504
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,537
You're under arrest.

1505
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,640
You have the right to remain silent.

1506
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,060
Anything you say can

1507
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,820
and will be used against
you in a court of law.

1508
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,070
You have the right to talk to a lawyer,

1509
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:31,330
have him present with you
while you are being questioned.

1510
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:32,840
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer,

1511
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,350
one will be appointed to represent you

1512
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:36,363
before any questions if you wish.

1513
01:21:39,191 --> 01:21:42,023
(telephone ringing)

1514
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:43,190
- I'll get it.

1515
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:49,503
Hello.

1516
01:21:50,834 --> 01:21:52,284
Oh, hi, captain, how are you?

1517
01:21:53,568 --> 01:21:54,401
Uh-huh.

1518
01:21:55,817 --> 01:21:56,650
What.

1519
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:00,993
I'm sorry.

1520
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,250
Yes.

1521
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,083
Yes, I do.

1522
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:07,203
Uh-huh.

1523
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:08,913
Thank you.

1524
01:22:13,665 --> 01:22:15,153
- Bill.

1525
01:22:15,153 --> 01:22:16,063
What is it?

1526
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,540
- They've arrested Pam as
an accomplice to murder.

1527
01:22:22,716 --> 01:22:24,366
- I just didn't wanna believe it.

1528
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,253
- Children are killing children, Judy.

1529
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:32,670
Who knows what to believe anymore.

1530
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,743
- Listen to me.

1531
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:36,650
They could put us away for life

1532
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:38,000
if we don't take this deal.

1533
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,770
This way we're looking at 30 years max

1534
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:42,653
with 12 off for good behavior.

1535
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:45,883
Eighteen!

1536
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,003
Eighteen versus life.

1537
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,643
- I told her I wasn't gonna tell on her.

1538
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:01,164
I promised her--
- Forget that.

1539
01:23:01,164 --> 01:23:03,410
You think she's thinking about you now?

1540
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:05,130
She's going around saying
it was all your idea.

1541
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:06,783
She had nothing to do with it.

1542
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,420
- You gotta testify against her, Bill.

1543
01:23:12,898 --> 01:23:14,648
We gotta hang together on this one.

1544
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:19,180
Hasn't she ruined your
life enough already?

1545
01:23:22,613 --> 01:23:25,946
(footsteps approaching)

1546
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:38,070
- Well, you boys talk it over?

1547
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:39,463
- Yeah, we talked about it.

1548
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:45,743
- We'll do it.

1549
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,100
We'll testify against Pam.

1550
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:55,799
(somber music)

1551
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,510
- [Prosecutor] Is this the
knife that Pete Randall held

1552
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:09,123
in front of Gregg Smart's face?

1553
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,283
- Yeah.

1554
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:18,863
- So,

1555
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,900
after you found you
couldn't cut his throat

1556
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,507
what did you do then?

1557
01:24:26,742 --> 01:24:29,140
- I took out the gun, and I cocked it,

1558
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:33,993
and I aimed it at his head.

1559
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:38,320
- [Prosecutor] After you
aimed the gun at his head,

1560
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,153
what did you do?

1561
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,840
- I just stood there for a long time.

1562
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,023
- [Prosecutor] For how long?

1563
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:58,175
- It seemed like a hundred years.

1564
01:25:06,509 --> 01:25:07,342
I whispered.

1565
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:12,393
God, forgive me.

1566
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:18,493
- And?

1567
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,910
- I pulled the trigger.

1568
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:30,850
- We'll take a morning recess.

1569
01:25:34,483 --> 01:25:37,900
(people chatting loudly)

1570
01:25:45,082 --> 01:25:48,832
(reporters muttering loudly)

1571
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,314
- No comment please.

1572
01:25:55,314 --> 01:25:58,265
- No comment at this time.
- Absolutely no comment.

1573
01:25:58,265 --> 01:26:01,348
Sorry, coming through.
- No, comment.

1574
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,490
- Has the jury reached a verdict?

1575
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,600
- We have, Your Honor.

1576
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:32,723
- [Judge] Will the defendant please rise?

1577
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,560
How do you find the defendant Pamela Smart

1578
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,050
on the charge of accomplice
to murder in the first degree?

1579
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:47,863
- [Forewoman] Guilty, Your Honor?

1580
01:26:47,863 --> 01:26:50,140
(reporters speaking loudly)

1581
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:52,135
- [Man] Will you be filing an appeal?

1582
01:26:52,135 --> 01:26:55,802
(reporters speaking loudly)

1583
01:26:58,014 --> 01:27:00,597
(somber music)

1584
01:27:49,657 --> 01:27:51,520
- You can finally rest now, son.

1585
01:28:02,224 --> 01:28:04,057
- Come on, sweetheart.

1586
01:28:35,364 --> 01:28:38,531
(soft dramatic music)

1587
01:29:33,521 --> 01:29:36,354
