00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,483
<i>The philosopher  Marcel Proust said,</i>

2
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:54,985
<i> "We say that the hour of
 death cannot be forecast.</i>

3
00:00:56,253 --> 00:01:00,822
<i> But when we say this, we
 imagine that hour to be placed</i>

4
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:03,658
<i> in an obscure and
 distant future."</i>

5
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:09,029
<i>We gather here to offer support</i>

6
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:10,930
<i> to Matthew's family
 and friends.</i>

7
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,433
I must ask now, if your
cell phone is still on,

8
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:17,601
please turn it off now
to be fully present.

9
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:26,408
<i> There is never
 a convenient time</i>

10
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,742
<i> for any of us to die.</i>

11
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,780
<i> And yet, how do we
 make sense of such</i>

12
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:35,415
<i> a promising young man's
 life cut so short?</i>

13
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:46,590
<i> The eventual
 certainty for us all,</i>

14
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:49,024
the hour of our death,

15
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:52,793
suddenly went

16
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:57,796
from obscure and distant
to a very unreal, reality.

17
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,567
Yet, we are also
here to celebrate

18
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:03,834
Matthew Burd's life,

19
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:07,436
and in doing so,
knowing Matthew,

20
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:12,040
he would want each of you
to live life as he did.

21
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,641
To its fullest.

22
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:18,511
That if opportunity
presents itself,

23
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,314
do not hesitate, do not waver.

24
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,382
Do not take time for granted.

25
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:27,984
There is only now.

26
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:33,087
Holy shit!

27
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,124
Bye, see you later.

28
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,959
You can stay as long as
you like, I'm going to Marie's.

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,494
-You goin' there now?
-Mm-hm.

30
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,561
Why?

31
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,962
She asked me to come over.

32
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:45,829
It's some sort of
family emergency.

33
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:48,031
What, her family found
out she works at Hooters?

34
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,166
Why do you always
have to put her down?

35
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:51,600
Maybe it's
because I can't walk

36
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:53,001
from here to the corner without

37
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:54,402
running into eight
guys she's fucked.

38
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:56,970
Bye.

39
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,805
Honey, I was just-- Oh!
Watch the suit, watch the suit.

40
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:01,773
Just kidding, it's
a joke, come on.

41
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:03,007
Don't be so serious.

42
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:05,675
I love you.

43
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:09,411
-I love you!
-Bye, bye.

44
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:10,811
Bye, bye!

45
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:12,546
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye!

46
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:19,685
-Hey.
-Hey.

47
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,890
Yo!

48
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:27,191
Hey.

49
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:28,691
What's up?

50
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:29,925
What's up?

51
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:31,259
I ordered you a drink.

52
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,860
Good, I need one.

53
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,662
-Coming.
-Hey, Zach.

54
00:03:35,963 --> 00:03:37,530
-Hey, Bryce!
-What's up, man?

55
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:38,664
How's it goin'?

56
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,631
All right, how long's it been?

57
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,832
It's been a while.

58
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,533
-You look good.
-Thank you.

59
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:43,800
Thank you. You too.

60
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:44,901
There you go.

61
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:46,568
Can we get another round
when you get a chance?

62
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:47,902
You bet, and there's
your Coke, honey.

63
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,503
Thanks, Stacey.

64
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:51,170
Coke?

65
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:52,871
Twenty-two days sober.

66
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:54,505
No shit?

67
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:55,572
Yeah.

68
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:57,106
You know that line
between being a drinker

69
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:58,507
and being an alcoholic?

70
00:03:58,509 --> 00:03:59,608
Mm-hm.

71
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,009
He crossed it.

72
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:02,110
I crossed the shit
out of that line.

73
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:04,278
Wow, sorry to hear that, man.

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,579
No. Hey, it's cool. I'm good.

75
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,213
So I hear congratulations
are in order?

76
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:08,280
You're getting married.

77
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,314
I'm getting married.

78
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,348
Wow.

79
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,416
Yes.
How 'bout you?

80
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,483
No, no, I've
been seeing someone

81
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:16,418
off and on,
but nothing serious.

82
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:18,152
-To Matthew.
-Yep.

83
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:19,253
To Matt.

84
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,588
Can't believe he's dead.

85
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,024
Getting run over by a
bus in broad daylight?

86
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:26,458
What are the odds?

87
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,459
When it's your time,
it's your time.

88
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:30,393
That's life,
one minute you're walking

89
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,661
down the street,
next minute-- Bam!

90
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,496
Pulling your skull
fragments outta

91
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:36,431
the front grill
of the city bus.

92
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:38,966
I'm not so sure that
it was an accident.

93
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:42,102
What the fuck does that mean?

94
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:45,104
Well, Matthew called
me a couple weeks ago.

95
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:48,973
He was depressed,
he was incoherent.

96
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,874
And he thought he
was being followed.

97
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:52,575
You know what,
and then he told me

98
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:54,242
he had been outta
work since January,

99
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:55,876
and that he was flat broke now.

100
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:57,810
So, anyway, Matt's getting
harassed by creditors.

101
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,511
So he asks you for money.

102
00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:00,912
No, no, he knows
I don't have it.

103
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,780
Look.

104
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:06,183
All I'm suggesting is that,
it wouldn't surprise me

105
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:08,084
if a suicide note turned up.

106
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,419
What was that?
-Shit.

107
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:13,420
Ah, shit, is that Noah Dorfman?

108
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:14,654
Scared the shit outta me.

109
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:15,855
Did you
invite him here?

110
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,989
He cornered me
at the services.

111
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:18,689
Why didn't you invite
the whole goddamn funeral?

112
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:20,524
Bryce! Hey, man!

113
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:22,592
-Hey! Ah-ha!
-How you doin'?

114
00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:24,160
-All right, all right.
-Good to see you, Warren.

115
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:25,594
-Hey, man.
-Good to see you again.

116
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:26,695
-Yeah, yeah.
-Hey!

117
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:28,063
-Hey!
-Come here, buddy.

118
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:29,831
Poodles! How you doin'?

119
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,599
-Are you good?
-Long time.

120
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,099
That's a nice
fuckin' watch, man.

121
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,733
Thanks, man,
that was my dad's, yeah.

122
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,301
Lucky sperm club, huh?

123
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:38,702
It has been a long time!

124
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,670
Hey, make sure I get
all of your e-mails.

125
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,171
I'm on the reunion
planning committee!

126
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:44,239
I'm in charge of
tracking everyone down.

127
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:45,773
-Reunion?
-Yeah!

128
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:47,107
That's in-- You know
that's in three years?

129
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:48,374
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

130
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:50,275
Yeah, you know, but, you know,

131
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:52,210
but my New Year's
resolution was

132
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,078
no more putting off till
tomorrow what you can do today.

133
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,779
True.
-That and buy a Stair Master.

134
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,413
-New Year's resolution?
-Yeah.

135
00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:58,447
It's like, October, Noah.

136
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:02,216
Time flies.

137
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,350
What have you
been doing though,

138
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:05,251
other than planning the
reunion for three years?

139
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:07,253
Well, uh, I am in real estate.

140
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,487
Real estate!

141
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:10,355
Yeah, yeah, let me
give you a card, you know.

142
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,258
Of course, in this market you
can't give shit away, but...

143
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,260
Is that your sales pitch?

144
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:17,527
'Cause you got me.

145
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,029
I hear you're gettin'
married Zach, congrats.

146
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,363
Man, I got some great listings,

147
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:22,363
great neighborhoods
for starting a family,

148
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,497
that kinda thing.

149
00:06:23,898 --> 00:06:25,531
Yeah, I'm good, Noah.

150
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,600
So what about you,
you got a girl, or...?

151
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:29,634
You know, I do actually.

152
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:30,801
Yeah? Oh, good.

153
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:32,769
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's getting
pretty serious actually.

154
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:33,770
It's true what
they say, you know,

155
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,772
there's someone out there
for everyone, even him.

156
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,274
Even you, even you!

157
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:40,008
Even you, come on!

158
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,441
I feel like we're in
high school right now.

159
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,875
Right now, at this moment.

160
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:46,144
I bet your rich
daddy's gonna throw you

161
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:47,311
one hell of a wedding.

162
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:49,145
Well, uh...

163
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,013
He passed, actually,
uh, blood clots.

164
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:53,247
Sorry to hear that.

165
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:54,414
That sucks, man, sorry.

166
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,615
Thanks guys, thank you, yeah.

167
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,650
Yeah.

168
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,485
And he was worth a lot
of money, your father.

169
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,720
You know, I mean
dealing with lawyers

170
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:02,854
and the estate,
that's a big headache.

171
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:04,455
You know, you're spot on about

172
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,223
the real estate market,
I say the same thing

173
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,557
to all my clients when
they come in, I say,

174
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,991
"Until things turn around,

175
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,993
avoid it
like the fuckin' plague."

176
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:13,928
The smart money right now
is in portfolio management.

177
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,496
-Is that right?
-I want you to take my card.

178
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:17,231
Look at that.
Oh, man, that is a card.

179
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,465
I want you to call me.

180
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:19,832
Well, thanks, man,
I appreciate that.

181
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,633
-You gonna call me?
-Sure.

182
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:22,900
All right, I'm gonna
get outta here.

183
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:24,234
Oh.
I got another round coming.

184
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,635
I'm hydrated, I gotta go.

185
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:27,737
Listen, if you, uh,
if you don't want

186
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,972
any more to drink,
you know maybe umm,

187
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:33,341
you guys wanna smoke outside?
A little four-twenty?

188
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:43,116
Truth is, the
most prevalent thing

189
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:44,984
that came out of
a day like today is:

190
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:47,152
at any moment,
that could have been

191
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,020
any one of us in that pine box.

192
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:50,854
Yeah, man.

193
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:53,489
That's why you have
to live in the moment.

194
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:56,591
Like that preacher said, if the
opportunity presents itself,

195
00:07:58,093 --> 00:07:59,593
do not hesitate.

196
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,295
Amen to that, my brother.

197
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:05,364
Hey, you guys ever
hear of Bidexco?

198
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:06,998
Bidexco?

199
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:09,333
Yeah, it's a
pharmaceutical company,

200
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:11,168
small startup, some
guys at my firm,

201
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,502
we helped them raise capital.

202
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:14,270
Why are you asking
about Bidexco?

203
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:15,504
Well, my cousin works for this

204
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:17,372
large accounting firm,
you know,

205
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:20,208
too large to take Bidexco
on as a client, so,

206
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,609
he helps them out
on the weekends

207
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:23,677
and they put all
their cash right back

208
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,545
into research so
instead of paying him,

209
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,547
they just issue him stock.

210
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,015
I hate to break
it to your buddy,

211
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:30,616
but, uh, you should
tell him it's probably

212
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:32,284
not worth the paper
it's written on.

213
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:34,418
Well, maybe.

214
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,355
Or maybe he overheard
a researcher talking.

215
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,955
About a breakthrough.

216
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,089
A month before FDA approval.

217
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,723
And since he'd
been doing all this

218
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,857
under the table, he
put all the shares

219
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,125
in this account, in
this trust account,

220
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,593
under a fictitious name.

221
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:51,460
And now he's
starting to freak out

222
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,928
and he wants
to sell the shares.

223
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:54,395
What's he asking?

224
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,529
Two hundred grand. Cash.

225
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,363
Oh, is that all?

226
00:08:58,365 --> 00:08:59,697
Yeah, why?

227
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:02,166
If what he says is
true about that stock,

228
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,834
it could be worth 10
times that tomorrow,

229
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,869
maybe even more, the
sky's the fucking limit.

230
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:07,370
My rent check
clears this month,

231
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:10,071
my account holds a little
over 300 dollars, so.

232
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,873
Well, everything I got
is tied up in investments

233
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,542
right now, I'm not
really a liquid...

234
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:17,610
You know, I can't get my
hands on that type of cash.

235
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,880
Well, I could, I could get it.

236
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,047
You could get what?

237
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,648
The money. I can get it.

238
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,116
- You can get the money?
- Sure.

239
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,550
How much of it?

240
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:28,917
I can get--
I can get all of it.

241
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,252
-Really?
-Yeah.

242
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,519
Want some more of this?

243
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,853
Thank you.

244
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:35,120
Um, you know of
course, if everyone

245
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,055
wants in, we'd have to split
it four ways, you know?

246
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:41,223
Um, that way we,
you know, would be,

247
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:43,124
equal partners, you know?

248
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:46,393
Uh. On principal
whatever you pay back,

249
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:48,061
plus some accrued interest,
but,

250
00:09:48,063 --> 00:09:51,330
you know, this, I mean this
is how it works, right?

251
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,397
You know?

252
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:56,333
We can, like, uh, be the
Four Amigos or something.

253
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:57,834
With business.

254
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,403
Oh, wait, it was three.

255
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:04,004
Four Musketeers.

256
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,907
Let's sign a treaty!

257
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,574
I like this!

258
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:14,310
It's a great tip.

259
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:15,743
I'm starting to
feel a sensation here.

260
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,252
This is Zach.

261
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,920
Warren, what's up?

262
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,355
What, no, I'm at work.

263
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,325
What?

264
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:39,326
What channel?

265
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:43,229
<i> Hours after
 the SEC seized hard drives</i>

266
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:45,864
<i> from its corporate offices,
 its chief executive officer,</i>

267
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:48,533
<i> Peter Nelson, was apprehended.</i>

268
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:51,068
<i> It seems Bidexco, a startup
 pharmaceutical company</i>

269
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,703
<i> was under heavy surveillance
 by federal authorities</i>

270
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:55,538
<i> for the past six months.</i>

271
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:58,140
<i> It's unclear whether
 Peter Nelson acted alone,</i>

272
00:10:58,142 --> 00:11:00,342
<i> or if Bidexco's executives--</i>

273
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,243
Uh, yeah, Warren.
I think this means

274
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,178
our shares are
fucking worthless!

275
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,582
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

276
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,749
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

277
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:11,816
Fuck! Fuck!

278
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:13,884
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

279
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:15,652
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

280
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:17,220
How many different
ways you want me

281
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:18,788
to say we got fucked, Warren?

282
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,790
The stock has no value!

283
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:24,693
The CFO just got
arrested by the Feds!

284
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:27,461
You know what, I can't--

285
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:28,728
Hey, what?

286
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:30,895
What? Hey!

287
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:33,163
Jesus, what the fuck's
going on? Listen!

288
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:34,330
Listen, listen!

289
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,240
Hey. How ya doin'?

290
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:48,974
Hey, guys, I don't--

291
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:50,108
-Mike.
-Just--

292
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,779
Now, if you don't want
to repeat this exercise,

293
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,347
you'll keep your mouth shut,
and let me do the talking.

294
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,648
Let me be brief.

295
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,016
You and your partners borrowed

296
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:03,983
a substantial amount of
money from my benefactor.

297
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,651
And in light of recent
events, he's concerned

298
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:07,085
about getting paid back.

299
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:08,820
Which is understandable.

300
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:12,423
He wants a sit-down, tomorrow,
the Royale, three o'clock.

301
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,090
That's it.

302
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:15,924
Uh. Oh, and don't forget
to bring your buddies.

303
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:17,058
Little Mike.

304
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:40,478
Where is he?

305
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,679
Fuck if I know!

306
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:42,680
He said three o'clock.

307
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:44,014
Are you sure he said three?

308
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,781
I'm pretty sure he said
three o'clock, Warren, yeah.

309
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,182
Considering I was thrown
in the back of a fucking trunk.

310
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,516
Couldn't wear a nice shirt?

311
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,617
I just got off work.

312
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,619
If you need to borrow a fucking
shirt, you can ask me.

313
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:53,419
I do not want to--

314
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:55,354
Are you sure he said he wanted
to talk to all of us?

315
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:56,821
Actually he said
he wanted to talk

316
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:58,122
to everyone but the black guy.

317
00:12:58,124 --> 00:12:59,990
Yes!
He wants to talk to all of us!

318
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:01,257
Real fucking cute, Zach.

319
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,959
Noah, what the fuck
did you get us into?

320
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:06,561
Guys, you asked me to get
the fucking money, I fucking--

321
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,062
We thought you had
the fucking money!

322
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:09,730
What the fuck are
you talking about?

323
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:11,231
Did you bury it with
your fucking father?

324
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:12,431
Oh, gee, "Hey, Noah, thanks
for getting the money--

325
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:14,132
Shut the fuck up.
I swear to you...

326
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,371
- Would you sit down?
- Shut the fuck up!

327
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:22,905
Who did you borrow
this money from?

328
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:24,572
Huh?

329
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,070
Hey, Eddie.

330
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:59,005
Paula, hold up there.

331
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,873
How you doin'?

332
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,374
It's not as bad as it looks.

333
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:03,441
What happened?

334
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,009
I, uh, fell down
a flight of stairs.

335
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,043
Really?

336
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,577
You know how clumsy I am.

337
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:11,579
Still with the mechanic, huh?

338
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,080
Eddie it was my fault, it was,

339
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:15,916
I screwed up,
it was all my fault.

340
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,250
I gotta get back to work.

341
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:18,684
-Okay, okay.
-Good seeing you, Eddie.

342
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:19,785
Yeah, you too.

343
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,986
They here?

344
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:23,654
They're here, at your table.

345
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:33,663
Yeah, that's him.

346
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:36,364
Oh, guys, I am so
sorry I'm late, traffic.

347
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:40,867
Ah, yes, kale shake.

348
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,169
Dehydrated cactus powder.

349
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:45,370
I'm training for a 5K.

350
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:48,772
Hello, Noah.

351
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,773
Mr. Lovato.

352
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,608
Eddie. Come on, we're in
business together.

353
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,709
Huh?

354
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:57,778
I think it's appropriate to be

355
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,012
on a first-name
basis, don't you?

356
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:00,446
Yeah.

357
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,613
So, how are you?

358
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,116
Good?

359
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,983
Good.

360
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:10,818
You boys ever hear of the
seven rules of economics?

361
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:13,319
That's okay.

362
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:15,620
Basically there's seven
fundamental notions,

363
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,788
let's say, that reflect
how our economy operates.

364
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:20,957
There's scarcity,
there's subjectivity,

365
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,028
there's inequality,
competition, imperfection,

366
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,496
ignorance and complexity.

367
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,730
But I believe there are eight.

368
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:31,964
Luck.

369
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,298
Which as of yesterday morning,

370
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,899
you boys seem shit out of.

371
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,868
Because as of today,
you owe me 400 grand.

372
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:41,136
Uh. The number was 200.

373
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:42,637
Ah, you forget
the cost of money.

374
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:45,906
Which is a theory, another
basic fundamental rule.

375
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:47,507
With all due
respect, sir, we didn't

376
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,176
borrow the money
from you, Noah did.

377
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:51,744
Noah.

378
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:53,212
Are these your partners?

379
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,715
Yes, yes they are.

380
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:58,983
Well, then, you share
the debt equally.

381
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,852
-Mr. Lovato--
-No, Eddie. Eddie, please.

382
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:03,919
Eddie.

383
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,153
Can I ask you a
question, and I mean this

384
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:07,354
with all due respect.

385
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:08,588
Sure.

386
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,724
Are you, you know...?

387
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,259
Am I what?

388
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:19,562
Am I Italian? Yes.

389
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:21,863
What are you getting at?

390
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:23,564
Am I...?

391
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,166
-You know--
-Oh, am I this?

392
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:29,468
Noah, you borrowed money
from the fucking mob?

393
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,936
It's one of your
New Year's resolutions, Noah,

394
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:32,504
become a complete
fucking moron?

395
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:33,771
What do you mean
become a moron,

396
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,005
he's always been
a fucking moron.

397
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:37,640
I am with ya, I swear, and
a guy I know referred me

398
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:39,541
and he borrowed money,
he had no problem.

399
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:40,842
- Noah.
- Yes.

400
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:42,143
Did he pay it back?

401
00:16:42,145 --> 00:16:43,677
Yes. Yes, he did.

402
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,844
Okay.

403
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,047
Fucking idiot!

404
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:49,447
Why am I the only one
catching blame here?

405
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:51,182
-Yell at Bryce's cousin!
-Fuck!

406
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,150
He didn't borrow money
from the fucking mob!

407
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:54,351
Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:16:54,353 --> 00:16:55,552
You guys. Shh!

409
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:56,886
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

410
00:16:58,288 --> 00:16:59,421
Relax.

411
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:02,790
Okay, all right,
this is the deal.

412
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:05,625
My sister's husband,
Buddy, that's his name,

413
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,059
not the brightest bulb
in the lamp store, okay?

414
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,061
He got a cocaine habit,
my sister didn't know it,

415
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,529
nobody knew.

416
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,796
And I don't blame
her, I mean, you know,

417
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,697
she's in love and she,
you know,

418
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,598
sometimes you don't
see the warning signs.

419
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,034
But this habit, you
know, it went from like

420
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:24,070
a few lines a week to
2,000 dollars a day.

421
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:26,504
And he runs a forklift, okay,

422
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,138
so he's not exactly
Warren Buffet.

423
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,439
Right?

424
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:31,506
So now he builds up a
hefty tab to the source,

425
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,808
who's tired of looking in
the mouth for his check,

426
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,277
and now the source is looking
to collect on what he's owed.

427
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:39,211
So, he kidnapped my niece.

428
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,981
And because of this
world-class degenerate,

429
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:45,650
in my opinion, my baby
niece's safe return

430
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:47,885
is of the utmost
importance to me,

431
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:49,786
is being held in
lieu of payment.

432
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,888
So why don't you
just pay off the debt?

433
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,223
Oh, normally that would be the
standard operating procedure.

434
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:58,926
This dealer, this fucking,
Tyrone is his name.

435
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:01,695
<i> Got a chip on his shoulder.</i>

436
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,430
Now he wants Buddy
for my niece.

437
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:06,098
Okay, just to make
some sort of example.

438
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,767
The problem is, uh,
Buddy is MIA,

439
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:12,669
which is
where you guys come in.

440
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,770
How?

441
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:15,471
Well, Tyrone's got a brother.

442
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:17,972
<i> From what I understand,
 he's not gonna</i>

443
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:20,040
be up for Citizen of
the Year Award, either,

444
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,409
so you won't have
an ethics problem,

445
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,943
because you're all
men of principle,

446
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,644
when you go to
pick him up for me.

447
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:27,946
Pick...

448
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:30,381
Mr. Lovato--

449
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:31,849
No, Eddie, Eddie, please.

450
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,650
Eddie.

451
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:37,452
I'm sorry to hear about
your niece, we all are.

452
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:39,020
I mean that's horrible.

453
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:40,621
But we're not criminals.

454
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:41,922
We don't know the
first thing about

455
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:43,356
kidnapping someone.

456
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,759
I mean, look at Noah, I mean...

457
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:49,760
Besides why wouldn't
you just have...

458
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:52,996
Them handle it.

459
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:54,864
Well, that would require
a two-part answer.

460
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:57,199
One, which is of no
concern of yours.

461
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:00,334
They'll be busy looking for
Tyrone to set up the exchange.

462
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:03,536
And two, and this is head and
shoulders above the first.

463
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,038
They don't owe me 400
fucking thousand dollars!

464
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,974
And unlike a bank, there
will be no late slips.

465
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,212
So say we pick
him up, then what?

466
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:17,313
Zach, are you
fucking kidding me?

467
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:18,947
I'm not kidnapping anybody!

468
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,048
Me neither.

469
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,215
I'd be a liability.

470
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:23,149
We have no fucking
choice, he's not asking us.

471
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:24,383
We're classically
fucked no matter

472
00:19:24,385 --> 00:19:25,917
which direction we look in.

473
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,184
Quantum physics.

474
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:28,485
Did you ever hear
of the Quantum Ten?

475
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,285
Group of guys,
they got together,

476
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:32,053
fired by ambition and passion.

477
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:34,555
They created quantum physics.

478
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,891
They knew with
ambition and passion

479
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:39,192
comes execution.

480
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:41,994
Fuck.

481
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:43,829
I'm shitting green,
and then running

482
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,364
three times a day, 'cause I
know what it's like to execute.

483
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:48,932
Okay?
I know what it takes.

484
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:50,099
It takes motivation.

485
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,366
And you guys have plenty of it.

486
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,700
I'm offering you
gentlemen a way out.

487
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:56,635
I'm offering you a
panacea to your problems.

488
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:03,240
All you have to do is collect
him, hold him, for 24 hours.

489
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,442
My guys'll hunt down
Tyrone, they'll set

490
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:08,578
a time and place,
I'll contact you, okay.

491
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,680
We exchange my niece
for his brother.

492
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:14,983
And if you do this for me,
I will consider the slate clean.

493
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:20,854
I hate this shit.

494
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,258
It's like wheat grass, but it's
not as good as wheat grass.

495
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,760
<i> Hey, Bernard,
 lemme tell you though,</i>

496
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,194
<i> Let me tell you what this
 motherfucker said to me</i>

497
00:20:31,662 --> 00:20:33,095
<i> That if I don't give
 him my club seats</i>

498
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:34,929
<i> to the Indians game
 this Saturday night,</i>

499
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:35,930
<i> he will tell his
 little sister about</i>

500
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,131
<i> what I did last weekend.</i>

501
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,665
<i> What about it?</i>

502
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,299
<i> Well you know, I ended up with</i>

503
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:41,867
<i> that redhead chick
 from Lakeview.</i>

504
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:43,168
Give him
the fucking tickets, man.

505
00:20:43,502 --> 00:20:45,636
<i> Man, fuck no!
 Mastiff is pitching!</i>

506
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:47,170
All right, we'll tell
him that if he don't

507
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:49,205
back off, then you'll
break his elbows.

508
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,273
Man, I can't do that man,
he's still my brother in-law.

509
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:53,274
Besides, the nigga so
dumb, he shit in his own hat.

510
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:55,142
By the third drink he
forgot his own name.

511
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,677
Look, man, he can't
open up his mouth,

512
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,845
because if he do, I
spend now until eternity

513
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:02,079
in Lawyer Land.

514
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:03,980
Ah, shit, man.

515
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:05,948
Hey, Marques,
what would you do?

516
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,452
First off, I wouldn't
be stupid enough

517
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:12,887
to cheat on my wife.

518
00:21:13,822 --> 00:21:15,389
And then advertise that shit to

519
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,691
half the fucking neighborhood.

520
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,692
Nigga.

521
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:22,728
You might as well
have posted fliers.

522
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:25,196
Aight, I'll be the
grown-up and say

523
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:27,064
what's on all y'all niggas
minds at this table.

524
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,799
You all mouth, Lamont.

525
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:31,535
That's your problem.

526
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:33,369
And we can't afford
to be havin'

527
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:35,104
no soft-ass niggas
in this crew.

528
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,539
In case you gentlemen
have forgotten,

529
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,507
that is the protocol
to our industry.

530
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:41,375
You wanna climb the
corporate ladder?

531
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:43,243
Keep you mouth--
fuckin' mouth shut!

532
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:46,979
<i> And, unfortunately,
 we got a zero-tolerance</i>

533
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:48,480
<i> policy, my nigga.</i>

534
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:56,153
Lamont, I'm just
fuckin' wit' you.

535
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,558
You cold, man!

536
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:04,726
Cold, man!

537
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:46,099
Hey, this stall's
taken, motherfucker.

538
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,704
Get him!

539
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,709
Grab his fucking arm!

540
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,944
Fuck off!
Fuck off!

541
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,652
Grab the fucker's arm!

542
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:21,857
Hit him!
Hit him!

543
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,329
Man, go check on Marques!

544
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,130
Nah, man, fuck that, you go.

545
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:32,498
Marques!

546
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,799
One of y'all motherfuckers go!

547
00:23:35,968 --> 00:23:37,534
Hurry up, hurry up!

548
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,704
Open up!

549
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:44,806
All right, he's in, he's in.
Go, go, go!

550
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:47,141
Go, go, go!

551
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,543
Go you fucking idiot!

552
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:54,546
Jesus Christ!

553
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,013
Christ! Do you know how
to fucking drive!

554
00:23:56,015 --> 00:23:57,314
It's a junky piece of shit!

555
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:03,185
Are you fucking hit?

556
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:05,620
Go, go!
Go, go, go!

557
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:06,954
Jesus Christ!

558
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:08,522
Jesus, get the fuck
off my foot!

559
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:11,490
We're taking this car too fast!

560
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:22,966
Who in the heck was that?

561
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,300
I don't know.

562
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:26,268
Whoever it was,
they were professionals.

563
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,104
Jesus Christ, Coleman.

564
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:30,171
My bad!

565
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:08,975
Guys?

566
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,579
Guys!

567
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:25,524
What the hell is this?

568
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:26,725
That's on a
need-to-know basis.

569
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,492
Right now you don't
need to know shit.

570
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,826
Who the fuck are you?

571
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,060
Don't worry
about all that, Marques.

572
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:34,562
This'll all be over in 24 hours,
as long as you behave.

573
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:40,100
Behave?

574
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:43,636
You got a set of stones,
I'll give you that.

575
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,339
Where the fuck am I?

576
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,240
It's like an old warehouse.

577
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,742
And artists live, work,
subsidize rental arrangement,

578
00:25:52,744 --> 00:25:54,710
my company has the listing.

579
00:25:54,712 --> 00:25:55,811
Shut up!

580
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:58,579
You're a fucking
real estate agent?

581
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:00,814
No, ah, no.

582
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:02,948
Whoa!

583
00:26:03,182 --> 00:26:04,448
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Don't get stupid!

584
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,715
Hey, hey, be easy,
I'm just trying

585
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:07,349
to get comfortable here.

586
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:09,183
Just put the--

587
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,352
Oh, for fuck's sake,
is that my gun?

588
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:18,958
I mean, it's bad enough
I get jacked by the local

589
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,592
neighborhood watch,
but now you're gonna

590
00:26:20,594 --> 00:26:22,760
point my own fucking
pistol at me?

591
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:24,094
Being that it's
yours, we certainly

592
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:25,862
don't have to remind
you that it's loaded.

593
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,932
Can you bring it closer?

594
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:31,566
Yeah sure, you
wanna hold it, too?

595
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:32,767
What the fuck for?

596
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:35,469
Look, I'm aware
that there's no

597
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:38,405
official kidnapping
handbook, but if there was,

598
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:40,407
I'm almost dead certain
that it would have

599
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:42,375
no objection to you
moving just a little bit

600
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:44,110
closer to me when
there is zero chance

601
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:46,512
of me getting up out this
motherfucking chair!

602
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,647
Go ahead,
he's not going anywhere.

603
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:50,681
I tied him myself,.
He's not going anywhere.

604
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,983
Oh, now, that's just
icing on the cake.

605
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:56,284
It's scratched.

606
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:57,318
What?

607
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,552
Right there on the handle.

608
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,353
Oh, shit, yeah I see it.

609
00:27:00,587 --> 00:27:02,120
God damn right you see it!

610
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,654
You know what that is?

611
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,891
That's one-of-a-kind,
Grade A Tahitian pearl!

612
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:09,759
Fucking flawless!

613
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,993
Do you know what a
scratch that size,

614
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
that sure as shit
ain't coming out,

615
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:13,761
does to its value?

616
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:14,995
Yeah.

617
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:17,163
It's worthless now.

618
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:19,331
Okay, okay.

619
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,066
I just made my first decision.

620
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,500
What's that?

621
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:24,134
When I get outta here,
you the first one

622
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:25,535
I'm gonna shoot.

623
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:29,138
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

624
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,973
and take an educated guess.

625
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,441
Since I've never set eyes
on any of you before,

626
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,975
the reason why I'm
taped to this chair

627
00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:39,145
is not personal in
nature, which makes this

628
00:27:39,147 --> 00:27:41,413
unfortunate chain of events...

629
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:44,215
a business transaction?

630
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:48,084
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

631
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:49,685
Am I gettin' warm yet?

632
00:27:51,187 --> 00:27:53,488
And since I'm
taped here, and not

633
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,756
face-down in the ditch,
somebody

634
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,091
must of offered
to bump you fellas

635
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,194
up a couple of tax brackets
in exchange for me.

636
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:03,829
And factor in y'all
weak-ass gear, my guess is

637
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:05,697
this is a life-changing
sum of money.

638
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:06,964
Am I right?

639
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:08,899
Did I hit the nail on the head?

640
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,434
Well, it's like 400 grand,
but it's not like

641
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:12,768
we get to keep it or anything.

642
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,869
Shut up!

643
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:15,703
I'm sorry, Zach.

644
00:28:16,871 --> 00:28:18,104
Fuck!

645
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:19,371
What?

646
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:21,606
Did we not have a conversation
on the way over here?

647
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:22,773
What the fuck
did we talk about?

648
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:24,040
In the fucking car?

649
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:25,174
What was it about?

650
00:28:25,608 --> 00:28:27,108
No fucking names, man!

651
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,976
Shit man, I'm so sorry.
It's just--

652
00:28:28,978 --> 00:28:30,510
Oh, no, you know
what, I'm sorry,

653
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:31,511
I overreacted, you're
right, you're right.

654
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:32,612
You're right.

655
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,280
What are you doing?
This is my wallet.

656
00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:38,183
Noah Dorfman,
316 North Flushing Avenue.

657
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:39,617
Get the fuck off me!

658
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,853
That's an old address.

659
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,356
What you probably
are unaware of Zach,

660
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:50,993
and Noah Dorfman, is I have
Demetrius Flemmings' blood

661
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,061
coursing through my veins.

662
00:28:58,866 --> 00:28:59,932
Oh.

663
00:29:00,366 --> 00:29:01,866
By the pathetic
look on y'all faces,

664
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:03,934
suffice it to say you've
never heard of him.

665
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,202
Google him!

666
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:13,140
Here, I found something.

667
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,042
A lawyer for Demetrius
Flemmings, head of the

668
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:17,843
black crime syndicate,
filed a motion

669
00:29:17,845 --> 00:29:19,845
Wednesday formally
asking the judge

670
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:22,314
to dismiss all charges
against his client.

671
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:25,016
Flemmings is currently
under felony indictment

672
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:28,219
for drug trafficking,
conspiracy, money laundering

673
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:30,588
and the disappearance
of two federal agents.

674
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,222
It goes on.

675
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:34,724
Me and this kidnapping master

676
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:36,659
share a very special bond,

677
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:38,560
me being
his favorite nephew and all.

678
00:29:38,562 --> 00:29:41,062
And factor in,
you miserable fucks

679
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:43,831
snatched me off the
motherfucking toilet.

680
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:46,232
Which in my books is
as sacred a ground

681
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:49,067
as Saint Mary's
fucking Cathedral.

682
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:51,402
Yeah.

683
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:54,971
That means y'all are
pretty much fucking dead!

684
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:57,072
You're dead!

685
00:29:58,007 --> 00:29:59,407
Eddie just fucked us!

686
00:30:00,576 --> 00:30:01,875
Will you calm down?

687
00:30:01,877 --> 00:30:03,009
Okay, you're gonna
break something.

688
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:04,476
Remember, everybody
promised that

689
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:06,110
we're gonna leave everything
exactly as they found it.

690
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:14,582
Did you not just hear,
less than ten seconds ago,

691
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:16,617
who the fuck we have tied
up in that fucking room?

692
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:17,918
Yes, I fucking heard!

693
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,219
Shut up!

694
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:20,853
We are so fucking
royally fucked!

695
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:22,788
What are you
doing, are you okay?

696
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,789
What is that?

697
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,190
It's fine, okay?

698
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:26,457
It's my anxiety
medication, I'm fine.

699
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:27,991
Oh, great, he's high.

700
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:30,759
I say we just let Marques go.

701
00:30:33,928 --> 00:30:36,129
Okay, all right, that
sounds like an idea.

702
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:38,130
And then what?

703
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:39,464
What do we do then?

704
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:40,431
Eddie blames us
for his dead niece,

705
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:41,865
we end up in the
back of a trunk.

706
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,799
We go to the police, we
ask for protective custody!

707
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,066
No, no, no, no!

708
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:46,267
We did the kidnapping!

709
00:30:47,035 --> 00:30:48,869
Yeah, I know, I could
see how that could

710
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:50,136
potentially work against us.
Okay.

711
00:30:51,138 --> 00:30:52,304
--Fuck!

712
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:53,838
Is that Eddie?
-Hello.

713
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:56,206
Yes, hi, this is him.

714
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,608
Um. Yeah, can you hold please?

715
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,709
It's not.

716
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:00,810
It's not.

717
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:06,248
Warren, Warren can you
have a word with him?

718
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,049
Okay, no one can
know we are here.

719
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:09,850
I could lose my agent's
license over this!

720
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,787
Look, Zach's a little
stressed out right now.

721
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,823
Dude, we have a Crip or
a Blood, or Snoop Dogg's cousin

722
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:19,525
tied up in there. We're all
a little stressed right now!

723
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:22,194
Listen to me,
he's not sure but,

724
00:31:23,062 --> 00:31:24,495
Zach thinks that
his fiancé's been

725
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:25,863
seeing somebody else.

726
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:27,997
What?

727
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:29,731
You know how she was
a registered nurse?

728
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:30,898
Yeah.

729
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:32,398
Yeah, well, she's
been coming home late,

730
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:33,865
and you know, which
shouldn't set off

731
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,967
any alarm bells in itself
but, he finds this little

732
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:38,868
match book from a hotel.

733
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:40,702
Shit.

734
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,303
So then he hires this
private investigator

735
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:43,737
to see if it's true.

736
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:44,971
Really?

737
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:46,138
Yeah, so there's a
lot going on right now.

738
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:47,672
Wow.

739
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,441
I feel terrible
for him that's...

740
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:51,542
Yeah, I know.

741
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,543
You think I'll be
invited to the wedding?

742
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:56,679
Mm. No.

743
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:58,880
Okay.

744
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:03,984
I think I want to move
this right here, yeah.

745
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:12,658
Well, if I was you, my son,
I would take this one

746
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,859
and move it right here.

747
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,761
Because see, you
don't want these mens

748
00:32:16,763 --> 00:32:18,329
to get over on your side.

749
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:20,531
You have to protect your
queen and your king,

750
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:22,833
so if I was you I would
have done that one,

751
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:24,201
that way you can save them.

752
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:26,002
Hey, Bobby.
Go on over with Leon.

753
00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:28,436
For you, boss.
Says it's important.

754
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:36,176
Okay, what is it now?

755
00:32:40,547 --> 00:32:41,847
Are you kidding me?

756
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:44,882
When, who?

757
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:47,851
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hold him down.

758
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,152
I'll take care of it.

759
00:32:50,154 --> 00:32:51,186
Appreciate your call.

760
00:32:51,188 --> 00:32:52,620
Later.

761
00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:17,875
Spread the word.

762
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:21,811
Two million dollars cash
to whoever finds my nephew.

763
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:28,950
I'm starved.

764
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:32,319
Do y'all got any
food in this place?

765
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:34,621
I'm sorry, fridge is empty.

766
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:36,555
Nobody lived here for ages.

767
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:39,257
-I could eat something.
-Yeah, me too.

768
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:41,558
Well, we're shit out of luck,
'cause there's no food.

769
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,892
So let's just stop
talking about food.

770
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,526
Come on, we're
gonna be here for

771
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:45,960
God knows how long, and nobody

772
00:33:46,194 --> 00:33:48,728
took the fucking initiative
to pack some sandwiches?

773
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:51,563
I could go out and
pick something up.

774
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:54,265
You know it's just, there's
not a whole lot around here.

775
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,333
Well, we passed
that ice cream place
on the way here.

776
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:57,467
Oh, yeah.

777
00:33:57,734 --> 00:33:58,800
Okay, yeah, yeah,
that's something.

778
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:00,334
We're not going
out for ice cream.

779
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:01,401
I could pick it up.

780
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:02,902
I said no, no ice cream!

781
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:04,603
We're not fucking going
out for ice cream!

782
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:06,037
Zach, what's the
worst that could happen?

783
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,405
You just got through
saying you were hungry.

784
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:08,506
We're all hungry.

785
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,175
All right.
Fuck it.

786
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,743
Sure, you're right.
Get me mint chip.

787
00:34:14,944 --> 00:34:16,110
Yes.

788
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:17,578
Sea salt caramel, cone.

789
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:20,046
A pistachio cup.

790
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:21,080
Marques?

791
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:22,347
Um, vanilla bean.

792
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:24,682
-Great, all right.
-Don't be long!

793
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:27,084
Ah shit, guys, I need money,

794
00:34:27,086 --> 00:34:28,618
I don't have any cash anymore.

795
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,719
I don't got shit.

796
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:31,053
I only got three bucks, man.

797
00:34:31,055 --> 00:34:32,621
I'm light too,
don't look at me.

798
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:39,827
No.

799
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:44,931
There we go.

800
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:47,366
Triple scoops for everyone.

801
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:48,467
Nice!

802
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:50,101
Thank you.

803
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:54,671
Now that is wrong on
so many fucking levels.

804
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:02,377
It's him!

805
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:10,584
Eddie.

806
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:11,751
Put him on speaker.

807
00:35:11,753 --> 00:35:13,152
<i> How 'bout you, Zach?</i>

808
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,786
<i>- You screwed us!
-  How's that?</i>

809
00:35:14,788 --> 00:35:16,954
-Black crime syndicate?
-You knew who this guy was!

810
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:19,122
You got him then, that's good!

811
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:20,823
For your niece maybe,
not so much for us!

812
00:35:20,825 --> 00:35:22,291
Ah, come on now,
you know, Marques

813
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:24,393
has had a rough day,
he's been kidnapped.

814
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:27,328
You know, it's part of the
territory, occupational hazard.

815
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:28,995
Occupational hazard?

816
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:30,129
Eddie, I hit this
man in the head

817
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:31,630
with a fucking toilet lid!

818
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,164
<i> Putting a bullet in the
 back of my fucking head</i>

819
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,132
<i> is gonna be the first
 thing on his list.</i>

820
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:35,966
<i> You know what, Eddie,
 maybe we'll untie him</i>

821
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,467
<i> and let him go.</i>

822
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,901
Or better yet, why don't
we just let him know

823
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:41,269
and his fucking uncle,
fucking who put us up to this!

824
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:42,503
Oh, really?

825
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:43,937
Now you listen to me, you
little motherfuckers.

826
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:45,138
I'll cut your fucking heads off

827
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,706
and stuff them down your
fucking necks, okay?

828
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,007
Until my niece gets
back, you're gonna do

829
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:51,842
exactly what I want you to do.

830
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:53,476
You don't want to
see my response

831
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:55,311
if something happens
to her, buddy!

832
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:56,679
You don't wanna see it.

833
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,147
All right, Eddie listen,
just relax, okay?

834
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:00,648
--Eddie, Eddie?

835
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:11,991
Let's do it.

836
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:39,750
Hey.

837
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:41,451
Hey.

838
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:43,085
Wow, look at all that.

839
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:48,222
You Julian?

840
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:50,457
Now, come on.

841
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,791
I was told that that's the name

842
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,058
of an athletic-looking brother

843
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,726
wearing a bright red tracksuit.

844
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:55,893
Hangs out in front
of the building

845
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:57,094
with this address.

846
00:36:58,062 --> 00:36:59,395
Unless my information's off by

847
00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:02,230
a country fucking mile,
that makes you Julian.

848
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:03,831
Okay, so I'm Julian.

849
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,132
Good.

850
00:37:05,134 --> 00:37:06,500
'Cause you looked at me
like I asked you

851
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:08,068
to recite the
Gettysburg Address.

852
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:10,136
You got me cracking, now what?

853
00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:12,037
Cut to the chase, I like that.

854
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,804
We're looking for Tyrone.

855
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:15,105
Who?

856
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:17,306
Who?
Again with the perplexing look.

857
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,274
Tyrone.

858
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:21,209
And before you tell me
where I can find him,

859
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:23,811
I want you to know I
see that semi-automatic

860
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:25,612
you're eyeballing on
the table over there.

861
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,047
Little Mike, would
you agree that Julian

862
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,214
reaching for that
pistol would ignite

863
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:32,583
an already flammable situation?

864
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:33,951
Most definitely.

865
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,752
So from where
I'm standing, I see

866
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,386
that you have two options.

867
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,889
One, you can make a
play for that gun,

868
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,057
in which I blow your
fucking brains out.

869
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:46,726
Or two, simply tell me
where I can find Tyrone.

870
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:50,128
Me and my little buddy here
will be ancient history.

871
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:55,732
What do you say?

872
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:56,999
Door number one or
door number two?

873
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,737
Hmm, door number three.

874
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:07,806
Holy crap, that's impressive.

875
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:09,406
Look at him go.

876
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,107
Yeah, probably
lettered in track.

877
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:14,142
Hey, kid.

878
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:18,279
Do you know where
we can find Tyrone?

879
00:38:18,281 --> 00:38:19,613
And if you give me
that same fucking look

880
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:21,514
Julian gave me,
I'm gonna shoot ya.

881
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:26,684
How old are you?

882
00:38:26,686 --> 00:38:27,818
15.

883
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:29,552
15.

884
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:30,653
What's your name?

885
00:38:30,854 --> 00:38:32,020
William.

886
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:33,454
-William what?
-Harrison.

887
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:35,455
Okay, William Harrison,
this is one of those

888
00:38:35,457 --> 00:38:37,290
rare moments in life,

889
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,158
that you're gonna get
a second chance.

890
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:43,695
You're gonna get up,
walk out that door,

891
00:38:44,063 --> 00:38:45,630
check yourself back
into school,

892
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,232
<i>study, read Catcher in the Rye,</i>

893
00:38:48,234 --> 00:38:51,768
graduate, you get a shot
at not ending up back here.

894
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,269
Word gets back to me
that you

895
00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:55,204
so much as fucking
skipped woodshop,

896
00:38:56,573 --> 00:38:58,140
I'll be paying you
a house visit.

897
00:38:58,741 --> 00:38:59,807
We clear?

898
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:02,842
Pick up your shirt,
get the fuck outta here.

899
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,043
Go!

900
00:39:27,163 --> 00:39:28,563
Summer time's here, babe!

901
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:30,164
Jesus, Noah.

902
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:32,165
How long's it take you to
pick up fucking ice cream?

903
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:34,367
Hey, I didn't see you
volunteer to go, Warren.

904
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:37,002
All right,
who had the pistachio?

905
00:39:37,004 --> 00:39:38,737
-That was me.
-All right.

906
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:40,004
What the hell?
It's melted already.

907
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:41,105
I know.

908
00:39:41,107 --> 00:39:42,439
Salted caramel.

909
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:43,506
That's mine.

910
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:45,240
I wanted a cone.

911
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:47,541
Jeez, umm, my bad.
Sorry.

912
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:49,075
Um...

913
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:51,210
This is for you.

914
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:55,213
And, Mr. Marques.

915
00:39:58,283 --> 00:39:59,716
Oh, shit.

916
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:03,085
Umm, we're gonna have to
untie his hands or something.

917
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:04,486
Out of the question.

918
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,087
Well, how's he gonna eat?

919
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,228
I'm sorry about this.

920
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:19,263
What, kidnapping me
or the spoon-feed part?

921
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:20,831
All of it.

922
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,366
Hey, nice tattoo.

923
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:24,766
Oh, that?

924
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,001
Yeah, all the guys
in my squad got one.

925
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:28,435
It was kinda
a solidarity thing.

926
00:40:29,003 --> 00:40:30,837
Hmm, didn't peg
you as ex-military.

927
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:32,772
Me, yeah, signed
up after graduation.

928
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:34,974
I bought into the
whole girls and guys

929
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:36,141
in uniform thing.

930
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,509
Oh.

931
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:40,878
And the... pussy just
fall into your lap?

932
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:43,380
No, I never actually
saw any action in the Army

933
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:45,315
they found out
I had a lazy eye.

934
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,516
Signed me up to SPO.

935
00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:48,484
Strategic planning
and operations?

936
00:40:48,486 --> 00:40:51,820
Yeah, didn't get me
laid, but I learned a lot.

937
00:40:51,822 --> 00:40:54,022
Glad to know our tax
dollars didn't go to waste.

938
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:03,363
You know what?

939
00:41:03,365 --> 00:41:06,865
Sometimes what looks
like a dead fucking end

940
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:12,202
to a dire situation,
can be an opportunity.

941
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,372
I don't follow.

942
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:19,408
Have you ever
ended up at the end

943
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,209
of an unexpected windfall?

944
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,876
Me, no.

945
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:25,011
I don't catch breaks.

946
00:41:25,013 --> 00:41:26,912
I'm like the unluckiest
guy you'll ever meet.

947
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:29,546
Well, maybe, maybe not.

948
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,515
Well, okay.

949
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:33,582
Take this for example.

950
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:36,984
My father, he died this year.

951
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:39,586
I'm sorry to hear that.

952
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:41,520
He was kind of a big
shot on Wall Street, okay?

953
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:43,655
He made a, made a ton of money.

954
00:41:43,657 --> 00:41:45,223
The lawyer calls me,
he tells me

955
00:41:45,225 --> 00:41:47,325
after the sale of three
homes, which is worth

956
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:49,827
less than what is owed
to my father's creditors,

957
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:51,995
his ex-wives, taxes,
all that shit,

958
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:55,264
there's pretty
much nothing left.

959
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:56,732
You know, I walk
away with a check

960
00:41:56,734 --> 00:41:58,600
for 3,000 dollars
and this fucking watch.

961
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,234
Whoa! Gah!

962
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,468
You know what, Noah?

963
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:05,170
Sometimes you gotta make
your own luck in life.

964
00:42:06,372 --> 00:42:08,072
I have a proposition for you.

965
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:12,408
A way for you to
walk away from this,

966
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,210
and in the process,
take with you

967
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:16,978
some very heavy paper.

968
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,613
Un-cuff me.

969
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:22,048
I'll pick a moment where
I'll make it look like

970
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,918
I untied the ropes myself,
I disappear from here.

971
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,152
And you wake up
tomorrow morning

972
00:42:28,953 --> 00:42:34,424
with a bag full of
cash under your pillow.

973
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:40,596
Yeah, I can't do that.

974
00:42:41,898 --> 00:42:43,265
You don't think there's
a search party out there

975
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:45,300
right now looking for me?

976
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:48,803
I bet you dimes to
dollars, somebody

977
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:51,171
caught a few digits on that
license plate of yours.

978
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,473
It's only a matter of time
before that doorbell ring.

979
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,476
I ain't gonna lie to ya, Noah.

980
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,945
Somebody's getting
invoiced for this shit.

981
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:06,882
It just doesn't have to be you.

982
00:43:32,941 --> 00:43:34,074
Hi.

983
00:43:34,842 --> 00:43:36,209
Where's Marques Flemmings?

984
00:43:36,743 --> 00:43:38,710
<i>I didn't even know that
 puto was missing, huh?</i>

985
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:40,778
We know all you
pimps and drug dealers,

986
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,613
you have your noses in
up each others' business.

987
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:43,747
You know somethin'.

988
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:46,015
Yeah, I know
somethin' all right.

989
00:43:46,649 --> 00:43:48,349
My motherfuckin' rights?

990
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,483
This shit illegal!

991
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:51,251
<i>Fuck off me, puto!</i>

992
00:43:52,419 --> 00:43:54,253
Let's see if this
refreshes your memory, huh?

993
00:43:54,854 --> 00:43:55,920
What the fuck!

994
00:43:56,187 --> 00:43:57,253
No!

995
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:58,520
Your memory comin' back now?

996
00:43:58,522 --> 00:44:00,088
Marques Flemmings.

997
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,556
Shit! I told you I don't know!

998
00:44:07,195 --> 00:44:08,595
What the fuck you do?

999
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:11,530
Oh, man, I'm sorry, my bad.

1000
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,669
When he gets into the office,

1001
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:21,370
can you have him
call me, please?

1002
00:44:21,372 --> 00:44:22,504
Thank you.

1003
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,271
Fucking moron.

1004
00:44:25,506 --> 00:44:27,106
Thought you were done
with that shit, man.

1005
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:31,109
I'm trying to stay awake.

1006
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:33,110
-All right.
-Don't judge me.

1007
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:34,978
I am not fucking judging you.

1008
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,946
Don't-- Get off your high
horse, you've been...

1009
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:38,681
you've been sober 15 days.

1010
00:44:38,683 --> 00:44:40,516
I am not judging you,
Zach, take it easy.

1011
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:45,752
Everything okay?

1012
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:47,853
Peachy.

1013
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:49,287
Anything I can do to help?

1014
00:44:49,488 --> 00:44:50,955
This girl's taking a
wrecking ball to my life,

1015
00:44:50,957 --> 00:44:52,356
you could help with that.

1016
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:53,857
Well, maybe there's
nothing there.

1017
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:55,692
That was the
private investigator.

1018
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:57,727
She left the house an
hour and a half ago.

1019
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,028
She still hasn't come back yet,

1020
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,496
she said she was staying in.

1021
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:01,530
Okay, where did
you tell her that

1022
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,731
you were going tonight?

1023
00:45:03,232 --> 00:45:05,299
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

1024
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:06,867
Well, isn't it
obvious that you didn't

1025
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:08,134
tell her the truth either?

1026
00:45:08,368 --> 00:45:09,234
And it's not like you're
out fucking around,

1027
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:10,702
that's what I'm saying.

1028
00:45:10,903 --> 00:45:12,503
I'm not talking about me,
I'm talking about her.

1029
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:13,871
Are you trying to make
me feel worse here?

1030
00:45:13,873 --> 00:45:15,806
-I don't know!
-Whose side are you on?

1031
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:17,541
No, I'm just saying,
maybe look,

1032
00:45:17,543 --> 00:45:19,142
maybe this is
naive of me to say,

1033
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:20,376
but isn't it
possible that there's

1034
00:45:20,378 --> 00:45:21,710
nothing going on?

1035
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:24,479
Oh, no, not possible.

1036
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:25,813
-Okay.
-Too many holes.

1037
00:45:25,815 --> 00:45:26,947
All right.

1038
00:45:27,348 --> 00:45:28,581
Too many gaps.

1039
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,583
God dammit.

1040
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:34,185
Look, Zach.

1041
00:45:34,187 --> 00:45:38,321
I'm not trying to be
your couples' therapist.

1042
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:41,523
All I'm doing is talking to
you as a friend right now.

1043
00:45:41,525 --> 00:45:42,891
Okay, well then, talk to me.

1044
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:44,592
I'm telling you
that if you keep going

1045
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:46,293
down this path,
you're always gonna be

1046
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:49,395
questioning and doubting every
little thing that she does.

1047
00:45:49,397 --> 00:45:51,263
Until it's gonna get
so bad, she can't

1048
00:45:51,265 --> 00:45:52,731
go to the dry cleaners
without you

1049
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:54,733
making a list
in your head

1050
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:56,067
about who she's gonna fuck.

1051
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:56,634
You understand?

1052
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:02,305
If only that
stock went through.

1053
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:05,641
I mean Janie, she's...

1054
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:07,809
she's beautiful.

1055
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:11,078
I mean, I really love her,
we really have a connection.

1056
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:15,281
The only way to manage a
woman like that's happiness,

1057
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:18,349
is with "fuck you" money.

1058
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,588
I put every single one of
my clients into that stock.

1059
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:29,957
What?

1060
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:32,592
All of them.
I mean, how many times

1061
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:33,926
do you get to play
the slots knowing

1062
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,094
the next pull, three
cherries are gonna come up?

1063
00:46:36,462 --> 00:46:39,997
I mean that's a once in
a lifetime opportunity.

1064
00:46:40,732 --> 00:46:43,867
Well, listen, man,
you know, sometimes

1065
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:46,069
these things just
work themselves out.

1066
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:49,372
In my line of work, when
you fuck up like that,

1067
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:52,441
it doesn't really
promote career longevity!

1068
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:53,542
Okay.

1069
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,109
She's gonna leave me.

1070
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,277
Oh, man.

1071
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,478
For sure.

1072
00:47:07,752 --> 00:47:09,219
Hey.

1073
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:10,286
Jerry.

1074
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,020
Go over to Diamond's.

1075
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:13,287
What for?

1076
00:47:15,623 --> 00:47:17,757
Okey-doke, we're on our way.

1077
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,824
Okay.

1078
00:47:26,964 --> 00:47:28,397
Okay, let's do this.

1079
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:29,831
Come on.

1080
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:36,402
Sir.

1081
00:47:36,404 --> 00:47:37,669
How can I help you?

1082
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:38,903
Tommy, is he here?

1083
00:47:38,905 --> 00:47:40,070
He's under that taxi.

1084
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:45,608
Tommy!

1085
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,909
Yeah.

1086
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:49,143
Yeah.

1087
00:47:49,145 --> 00:47:50,511
I'm a friend of Paula's.

1088
00:47:50,513 --> 00:47:51,612
Okay, she's got
a lot of friends.

1089
00:47:51,614 --> 00:47:52,746
Who the fuck are you?

1090
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:53,980
I'm her cousin Eddie.

1091
00:47:55,816 --> 00:47:57,982
Oh, fuck. Oh, God, God!

1092
00:48:01,585 --> 00:48:03,052
Fuck!

1093
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,088
Tell her you're sorry,
you buy her some flowers,

1094
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,522
and don't make me come back!

1095
00:48:39,785 --> 00:48:40,885
Hank.

1096
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:42,452
I've been expecting you.

1097
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,388
What's going on here?

1098
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,256
Oh, him, you haven't heard?

1099
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:49,557
Flemmings' nephew got snatched.

1100
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:51,691
He put up a big bank roll
for whoever can find him.

1101
00:48:51,693 --> 00:48:53,325
Negro over here
knows where he's at,

1102
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:55,026
but as you can see,
we're having a little bit

1103
00:48:55,028 --> 00:48:56,694
of a communication problem.

1104
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:59,029
We're taking a little
break right now.

1105
00:48:59,031 --> 00:49:00,230
Yeah, evidently.

1106
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,498
Well, we're looking for
his other nephew, Tyrone.

1107
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,066
Eddie says you got
an address for us.

1108
00:49:04,068 --> 00:49:05,667
Just waitin' for the call.

1109
00:49:05,669 --> 00:49:07,535
Friend of mine hangs out
with Tyrone all the time

1110
00:49:07,537 --> 00:49:09,370
down at Sullivan's.

1111
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:11,905
Eddie tell you we
agreed to five grand?

1112
00:49:12,506 --> 00:49:13,973
You get this when
I get the address.

1113
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:15,807
Sure.

1114
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:17,141
No problem.

1115
00:49:17,143 --> 00:49:19,243
Have a drink,
shouldn't be long.

1116
00:49:19,811 --> 00:49:20,877
All right.

1117
00:49:25,649 --> 00:49:26,782
Guys!

1118
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:29,216
Come here.

1119
00:49:29,218 --> 00:49:30,383
Come here.

1120
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:37,389
So that was Eddie.

1121
00:49:38,023 --> 00:49:40,724
He said everything on
his end is going forward.

1122
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:43,092
And?

1123
00:49:43,094 --> 00:49:44,226
And that's it.

1124
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:45,894
Now we just sit, and we wait.

1125
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:47,562
Sit and wait, wonderful.

1126
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:49,163
Well, did he give you
any idea how much

1127
00:49:49,165 --> 00:49:50,531
longer it'd be?

1128
00:49:50,533 --> 00:49:51,965
Shut up, Noah!

1129
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:53,933
Look, let's just take shifts
watching him, all right?

1130
00:49:53,935 --> 00:49:55,401
We'll switch out
every two hours.

1131
00:49:55,403 --> 00:49:57,236
This way
we can get some sleep.

1132
00:49:57,238 --> 00:49:58,537
-Yeah, all right.
-Okay, all right.

1133
00:49:58,539 --> 00:49:59,671
I'll go first.

1134
00:49:59,673 --> 00:50:00,872
You sure?

1135
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:01,939
Yeah.

1136
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:09,945
Did I ever tell
you guys how I got

1137
00:50:09,947 --> 00:50:11,613
this scar on my ear?

1138
00:50:11,615 --> 00:50:13,247
-Uh-uh.
-You haven't heard that?

1139
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:14,281
Nope.

1140
00:50:14,283 --> 00:50:15,782
I thought I told that to ya.

1141
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:17,249
Crazy story.

1142
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,284
My older brother, who
was pursuing a career

1143
00:50:20,286 --> 00:50:21,718
in law enforcement,
decided to go

1144
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,252
in a different direction,
and was dealing

1145
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:25,420
eight balls that were
one-third product,

1146
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,954
two-thirds baking soda.

1147
00:50:27,588 --> 00:50:29,388
<i> I'm home with chicken pox,
 when, you know,</i>

1148
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:30,756
<i> one of his disgruntled
 clients decided</i>

1149
00:50:30,758 --> 00:50:32,190
<i> to pay a house visit.</i>

1150
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:35,693
<i> So, he wanted to know
 where my brother was,</i>

1151
00:50:35,695 --> 00:50:37,594
<i> and how a household
 baking ingredient</i>

1152
00:50:37,596 --> 00:50:39,262
<i> ended up inside the bag.</i>

1153
00:50:40,464 --> 00:50:41,931
<i> I told him I don't know,
 and that</i>

1154
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:43,632
<i> my chicken pox was contagious.</i>

1155
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:46,267
<i> He apparently wasn't
 pleased with that answer.</i>

1156
00:50:47,068 --> 00:50:49,102
<i> Meanwhile, this kid
 Isaac was living</i>

1157
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:50,770
<i> in the apartment downstairs.</i>

1158
00:50:52,873 --> 00:50:54,406
<i> On this day,
 he decides to come home</i>

1159
00:50:54,408 --> 00:50:56,340
<i> a little earlier than
 his mother expected.</i>

1160
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:02,444
<i>Finds her home a little earlier
 than he expected as well.</i>

1161
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:06,681
<i> So he goes into the
 kitchen, and instead of</i>

1162
00:51:06,948 --> 00:51:08,581
<i> looking in the
 refrigerator for his usual,</i>

1163
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:10,816
<i> you know, after-school treat,
 he helps himself</i>

1164
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,351
<i> to his father's
 sawed-off shotgun.</i>

1165
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,954
<i> Meanwhile, my situation
 upstairs was deteriorating.</i>

1166
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,689
<i> This asshole was
 gonna cut my ear off.</i>

1167
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,534
<i> It was nothing short
 of divine intervention.</i>

1168
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,936
<i> I'm telling you, man, if it
 wasn't for this kid Isaac,</i>

1169
00:51:38,938 --> 00:51:40,870
<i> the guy would've taken
 my ear clean off.</i>

1170
00:51:43,607 --> 00:51:44,873
It was a fucking miracle.

1171
00:51:45,975 --> 00:51:47,342
--What the fuck?

1172
00:51:49,245 --> 00:51:50,744
You've got a gun, get me.

1173
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:06,690
Fuck.

1174
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:08,658
What the fuck'd you
do that for, Jerry?

1175
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,926
Say hi to Isaac.

1176
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:13,761
Hi, Isaac.

1177
00:52:14,162 --> 00:52:15,462
What are the odds of that?

1178
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:16,563
I don't know.

1179
00:52:30,477 --> 00:52:31,577
Hey, buddy.

1180
00:52:32,946 --> 00:52:34,179
You look like shit.

1181
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,283
Hello?

1182
00:52:41,285 --> 00:52:44,152
<i> Yo, Tyrone
 is hangin' with his ho at
 Second Side Apartments.</i>

1183
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:45,153
<i> Second floor on the left.</i>

1184
00:52:45,155 --> 00:52:46,087
Thanks.

1185
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,556
We're good.

1186
00:52:49,558 --> 00:52:50,723
We're good!

1187
00:52:50,725 --> 00:52:51,857
You good?

1188
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:53,958
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1189
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:12,308
You ever fire one of those?

1190
00:53:14,744 --> 00:53:16,010
What?

1191
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:17,311
Gun.

1192
00:53:18,513 --> 00:53:19,713
Call me crazy.

1193
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:22,214
You don't seem like the type.

1194
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:24,982
Not that you couldn't
if you had to.

1195
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:26,783
Well, let's not give
me a reason to have to.

1196
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:30,452
Hey, I'm on board with that.

1197
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:35,890
You know where I come
from, if somebody

1198
00:53:35,892 --> 00:53:37,892
asks you to put some
iron in the back

1199
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:40,294
of somebody's head
that you never met,

1200
00:53:41,262 --> 00:53:42,428
you just do it.

1201
00:53:43,496 --> 00:53:45,162
No questions asked.

1202
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:50,700
When you was growin' up,
did your pops

1203
00:53:50,702 --> 00:53:54,503
ever tell you to do
uncomfortable shit

1204
00:53:54,505 --> 00:53:56,338
because it made you
build character?

1205
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,405
All the time.

1206
00:53:57,407 --> 00:53:59,073
My pops, too.

1207
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,841
You know,

1208
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:03,008
he was a big proponent
of character building.

1209
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,377
And me, you know, I
was like the oldest,

1210
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:09,646
so he decided he wanted
to get me started early.

1211
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:12,448
Check it out, he sent
me over to this house.

1212
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:16,484
With nothing but a
flare and some matches.

1213
00:54:17,018 --> 00:54:19,386
By the time the
fire truck showed up,

1214
00:54:19,388 --> 00:54:21,221
there wasn't nothing
left but ashes.

1215
00:54:21,223 --> 00:54:22,488
Now I didn't find out
'til I saw

1216
00:54:22,755 --> 00:54:25,223
in the paper the next
morning, that there was

1217
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:26,924
a family of four inside.

1218
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,327
None of which made it out.

1219
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:33,663
Nigga, I was 13.

1220
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:41,435
As you can imagine,
sucked all the fun

1221
00:54:41,437 --> 00:54:43,336
right out of my childhood.

1222
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,210
You ever wonder what
your life would be like

1223
00:54:52,212 --> 00:54:53,878
if you chose a different path?

1224
00:54:54,546 --> 00:54:55,913
You mean doing
something other than

1225
00:54:55,915 --> 00:54:57,848
going into the family business?

1226
00:55:02,452 --> 00:55:04,553
Only every day.

1227
00:55:27,173 --> 00:55:28,472
Hey, Noah, are you awake?

1228
00:55:31,342 --> 00:55:32,575
Yeah.

1229
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:36,578
That cow on the window is
really freaking me out.

1230
00:55:38,782 --> 00:55:40,414
Oh, shit, yeah.

1231
00:55:40,948 --> 00:55:43,215
-That's some freaky shit, man.
-Christ Almighty.

1232
00:55:47,653 --> 00:55:50,488
Hey, Noah, um,
there's something

1233
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,322
I kinda want to
talk to you about.

1234
00:55:54,658 --> 00:55:56,025
Yeah, what is it?

1235
00:55:57,327 --> 00:55:58,960
Well, you know how
in AA there's that

1236
00:55:58,962 --> 00:56:03,330
whole thing about, you know,
making amends, whatever,

1237
00:56:03,332 --> 00:56:05,265
with people that you've
hurt in the past?

1238
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:07,266
Mm-hm.

1239
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,934
You know Zach
and Matthew and I,

1240
00:56:10,335 --> 00:56:12,936
you know back in
the day we, we were

1241
00:56:12,938 --> 00:56:15,738
pretty relentless
about torturing you.

1242
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,706
Warren, I was the
only kid in school

1243
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,841
who knew how to
use the word binary

1244
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:22,642
in a sentence, that pretty much

1245
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:25,011
warranted open season on me.

1246
00:56:25,979 --> 00:56:28,380
I mean, Noah, we really
pulled some shit on you.

1247
00:56:30,316 --> 00:56:31,582
Yeah, well.

1248
00:56:33,151 --> 00:56:36,553
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

1249
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,121
Right?

1250
00:56:38,123 --> 00:56:39,288
Yeah.

1251
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:40,389
Well.

1252
00:56:41,124 --> 00:56:42,891
I just wanted you to
know that, you know,

1253
00:56:42,893 --> 00:56:47,629
I feel bad about it and,
uh, and I'm sorry.

1254
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,765
All right.

1255
00:57:01,641 --> 00:57:05,777
Half, a million, dollars.

1256
00:57:11,316 --> 00:57:12,582
That's my offer.

1257
00:57:14,851 --> 00:57:18,119
All you got to do is un-cuff me,

1258
00:57:18,587 --> 00:57:20,887
and let me walk out
that door unchecked.

1259
00:57:22,723 --> 00:57:23,923
I can't do that.

1260
00:57:25,225 --> 00:57:29,795
500K that you get to keep.

1261
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:31,796
For yourself.

1262
00:57:33,899 --> 00:57:35,966
My brother, you
better think hard.

1263
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,468
My offer ain't just gonna
hang out there in the ether.

1264
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:41,269
Before sunup one of
you's gonna realize,

1265
00:57:41,536 --> 00:57:44,470
that you ain't got the
stomach for this kinda thing.

1266
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:46,671
Now take the dough.

1267
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:25,708
Hey, Bryce, man, I...

1268
00:58:28,912 --> 00:58:30,178
Fuck!

1269
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,316
Fuck! Fuck!

1270
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,333
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1271
00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:11,581
Oh!

1272
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:14,583
Jesus Christ, you scared
the shit outta me!

1273
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:15,650
Fuck are you doing?

1274
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:16,984
I'm planning my great escape.

1275
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,185
What the fuck
does it look like?

1276
00:59:18,986 --> 00:59:20,486
Oh, it stinks!

1277
00:59:20,488 --> 00:59:22,154
Wanna wipe my ass?
You look eager!

1278
00:59:26,926 --> 00:59:28,626
-Paula.
-Hey, Eddie.

1279
00:59:28,628 --> 00:59:29,994
How are ya?

1280
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:31,161
A couple guys showed up,
said that, uh,

1281
00:59:31,163 --> 00:59:32,328
they had a meeting with you so

1282
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,762
I sat them at your table.

1283
00:59:33,764 --> 00:59:35,363
-Oh.
-They're drinking Diet Cokes.

1284
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:36,597
Put it on my tab.

1285
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:37,898
-Eddie.
-Yeah?

1286
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,899
-Thank you.
-For what?

1287
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:42,100
Thank you.

1288
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:45,803
Hey.
How are you?

1289
00:59:45,805 --> 00:59:47,004
Hey, Eddie.
Good to see ya.

1290
00:59:47,006 --> 00:59:48,205
-How you doin'?
-Good.

1291
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:49,339
Take care.

1292
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:51,207
Gentlemen.
Traffic, sorry.

1293
00:59:51,209 --> 00:59:53,209
Agent Reichert.

1294
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:54,677
-Hey.
-What happened?

1295
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:56,145
-Eh, line of duty.
-Ah.

1296
00:59:56,147 --> 00:59:58,647
This is my partner,
Agent Santos.

1297
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:00,215
-How do you do?
- Sir.

1298
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:01,382
-Wanna talk?
-Yeah.

1299
01:00:01,384 --> 01:00:02,449
Let's do it.

1300
01:00:02,883 --> 01:00:04,016
You look good, Eddie.

1301
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:05,684
Ah, thanks, how's the wife?

1302
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,318
Well, you know how it is.

1303
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,553
She ain't getting any younger
or any thinner.

1304
01:00:10,856 --> 01:00:11,988
Mr. Lovato.

1305
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,456
Eddie, please.

1306
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:15,291
Mr. Lovato, as you
may have already heard,

1307
01:00:15,293 --> 01:00:16,725
Demetrius Flemmings'
nephew, Marques

1308
01:00:16,727 --> 01:00:18,359
was kidnapped yesterday.

1309
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:19,526
You know about this?

1310
01:00:20,294 --> 01:00:21,594
I do not.

1311
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:23,295
Well, the two of us
know that the two of you

1312
01:00:23,297 --> 01:00:24,529
have past issues.

1313
01:00:24,531 --> 01:00:25,530
I have?

1314
01:00:25,532 --> 01:00:27,798
Sorry Eddie, we have to ask.

1315
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:30,567
Anything you can give
us will be a big help.

1316
01:00:31,702 --> 01:00:34,236
Sound and fury,
signifying nothing.

1317
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:35,437
Hmm?

1318
01:00:36,005 --> 01:00:37,138
<i>It's a line from Macbeth,
have you ever seen it?</i>

1319
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,539
-No.
-No.

1320
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:40,040
Oh, it's my favorite play.

1321
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:41,241
I love it.

1322
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:43,375
I saw it on Broadway
with Patrick Stewart.

1323
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:45,843
<i>He's the bald guy from
 Star Trek, remember?</i>

1324
01:00:45,845 --> 01:00:47,411
Yeah, he's good.

1325
01:00:47,413 --> 01:00:49,813
Macbeth is the
king of Scotland.

1326
01:00:49,815 --> 01:00:51,881
And he's told by
a bunch of witches

1327
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:53,883
that he can never
be killed by a man

1328
01:00:53,885 --> 01:00:55,651
that was born from a woman.

1329
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,920
So he believes these
witches, why wouldn't he?

1330
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:01,522
And so when his
rival challenges him

1331
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,358
to a fight to the
death, he accepts.

1332
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,394
And, phew, one fell swoop of
a sword, he's decapitated.

1333
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:10,263
Turns out that the
guy who killed him

1334
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:12,765
was taken from
his mother's womb,

1335
01:01:12,767 --> 01:01:15,834
like a C-section,
not natural birth,

1336
01:01:16,402 --> 01:01:19,770
so technically, he is
not born of a woman.

1337
01:01:21,572 --> 01:01:24,040
I'm sorry Eddie,
we are not...

1338
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:25,074
We are not connecting.

1339
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:26,575
Hmm.

1340
01:01:36,017 --> 01:01:38,184
Sometimes things
aren't as they seem.

1341
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:23,394
You ready?

1342
01:03:03,933 --> 01:03:05,033
Hey!

1343
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,533
Tyrone, my man.

1344
01:03:06,535 --> 01:03:07,867
Got somethin' for ya.

1345
01:03:11,637 --> 01:03:12,770
Hello?

1346
01:03:21,479 --> 01:03:22,645
Yeah, all right.

1347
01:03:22,647 --> 01:03:24,045
Okay.

1348
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:28,282
Well, who was that,
what was that?

1349
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:31,951
Janie's fucking
around on me, man.

1350
01:03:33,453 --> 01:03:34,619
Fuck.

1351
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,453
Are you sure?

1352
01:03:36,455 --> 01:03:37,987
I'm pretty sure, yeah.

1353
01:03:37,989 --> 01:03:39,688
He said he's got
fucking photos.

1354
01:03:40,556 --> 01:03:41,955
-Damn.
-Sorry about that.

1355
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:45,791
You know what the
fucked up thing is?

1356
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:47,325
I fucking wanted to catch her.

1357
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:49,460
I mean, how fucking
sick is that?

1358
01:03:49,462 --> 01:03:51,528
Come on, don't do that
to yourself, you know?

1359
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:53,896
I mean, what kind
of fucking sick individual

1360
01:03:53,898 --> 01:03:55,864
is happy that his fucking
fiancé's getting banged

1361
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:58,932
in the back seat of a car
that he's fucking paying for?

1362
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:01,701
You didn't put it
in her name, at least?

1363
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:03,235
Noah, really?

1364
01:04:03,469 --> 01:04:05,470
Listen to me, and stop
fucking talking, I'm serious.

1365
01:04:05,472 --> 01:04:07,038
Okay, okay.
-Okay?

1366
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,205
All right.

1367
01:04:11,642 --> 01:04:13,109
You know, you
spend every fucking

1368
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,210
waking minute going through
their fucking phone,

1369
01:04:15,212 --> 01:04:16,711
going through their
fucking email,

1370
01:04:16,713 --> 01:04:18,312
going through their
fucking laundry.

1371
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:20,247
I mean anything,
anything to fucking

1372
01:04:20,249 --> 01:04:22,082
nail the fucking
bitch to the wall,

1373
01:04:22,084 --> 01:04:23,516
and I fucking knew it!

1374
01:04:23,518 --> 01:04:25,518
I wanted it, I
wanted to be right,

1375
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,152
and I fucking knew it!

1376
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,653
She's a fucking whore!

1377
01:04:29,254 --> 01:04:30,754
Zach, you probably
don't wanna to hear this,

1378
01:04:30,756 --> 01:04:32,589
but at least you
got some closure now, you know?

1379
01:04:34,391 --> 01:04:36,024
You know what
the detective said?

1380
01:04:36,026 --> 01:04:38,860
85 percent of his
clients who think

1381
01:04:38,862 --> 01:04:40,995
that their wives are
fucking around on them,

1382
01:04:41,863 --> 01:04:42,963
they are!

1383
01:04:44,899 --> 01:04:46,199
At least there's some comfort

1384
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:47,300
in knowing
you're in the majority.

1385
01:04:48,902 --> 01:04:51,403
Noah, just stop
fucking talking!

1386
01:04:51,405 --> 01:04:53,071
What, I'm just trying
to make him feel better.

1387
01:04:57,075 --> 01:05:00,743
The way I look at it,
life is a zero sum game.

1388
01:05:01,745 --> 01:05:03,445
It's one of the
evils of humanity.

1389
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:05,913
We all win somethin' and lose
somethin' at the same time.

1390
01:05:06,948 --> 01:05:08,748
Okay, so you're Socrates now?

1391
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:11,249
No, I'm simply saying
that we all brought

1392
01:05:11,251 --> 01:05:13,951
into this world with
a sheet of columns.

1393
01:05:15,086 --> 01:05:16,453
And the shit you
do in one column

1394
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:17,687
has to be balanced
out with the shit

1395
01:05:17,689 --> 01:05:19,288
you do in the other.

1396
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,089
What does that have
to do with anything?

1397
01:05:22,257 --> 01:05:23,690
Okay, stay with me and
see if what I'm saying

1398
01:05:23,692 --> 01:05:25,191
don't start making
perfect sense.

1399
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:26,592
All right.

1400
01:05:26,594 --> 01:05:27,693
Me.

1401
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:29,627
I'm here, cuffed to this
chair, because of some

1402
01:05:29,629 --> 01:05:33,130
malevolent act that
I did out there.

1403
01:05:33,132 --> 01:05:35,031
And, as you can imagine,
given my line of work,

1404
01:05:35,033 --> 01:05:36,932
that side of the column
is pretty god damned full,

1405
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,867
so I'm fairly certain
that your friend here

1406
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:42,136
did something on his
end, let's just say

1407
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:45,105
something that he's
not terribly proud of

1408
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,806
to deserve what's
happening to him.

1409
01:05:46,808 --> 01:05:48,440
Actually, you're
very wrong, Marques,

1410
01:05:48,442 --> 01:05:49,808
because he was faithful.

1411
01:05:50,276 --> 01:05:51,943
No, it don't have to be that.

1412
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:53,977
It can be anything,
I'm talking about

1413
01:05:53,979 --> 01:05:55,611
fucking karma, here.

1414
01:05:55,613 --> 01:05:56,945
Yeah, how about
sometimes things

1415
01:05:56,947 --> 01:05:59,347
just don't add up in the world?

1416
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:01,782
And you just get
fucked over either way,

1417
01:06:01,784 --> 01:06:03,550
no matter what you do.
What about that?

1418
01:06:04,151 --> 01:06:06,652
Nah.
There's always something.

1419
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,787
There isn't anything.

1420
01:06:09,155 --> 01:06:12,357
Come on, Zachary,
there's something.

1421
01:06:12,758 --> 01:06:15,726
Your fucking bullshit theory
doesn't apply here, Buddha!

1422
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,093
Okay, so you want
us all to believe

1423
01:06:17,095 --> 01:06:18,727
that you some kind of saint?

1424
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:20,695
I don't give a fuck
what you believe!

1425
01:06:20,962 --> 01:06:22,762
See the thing is, you
can deny culpability

1426
01:06:22,764 --> 01:06:25,798
all you want, but
the way I see it,

1427
01:06:25,965 --> 01:06:29,600
based on laws of balance,
you might as well have

1428
01:06:29,602 --> 01:06:32,169
dressed your little cupcake
in some lace garters,

1429
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:34,738
and put her pussy up
for auction yourself.

1430
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,905
Shut the fuck up!

1431
01:06:35,907 --> 01:06:37,239
Shut the fuck up!

1432
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,340
Hey, I'm just trying to give
your friend some clarity, here.

1433
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:41,008
Let me give you
some fucking clarity,

1434
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:42,376
you fucking piece of shit!

1435
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:45,144
A man who discovers
that his fucking fiancé

1436
01:06:45,146 --> 01:06:48,847
is cheating on him six weeks
before the god damn wedding,

1437
01:06:49,148 --> 01:06:51,716
is probably not a guy
you want to fuck with!

1438
01:06:52,084 --> 01:06:54,318
That man would probably
have no fucking issue

1439
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,853
fucking blowing your
fucking stupid face

1440
01:06:56,855 --> 01:06:59,355
right across the fucking floor!

1441
01:06:59,357 --> 01:07:00,856
Zach, Jesus
Christ, take it easy.

1442
01:07:01,591 --> 01:07:02,657
I'm gonna fucking shoot him.

1443
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:04,091
Calm down, man!

1444
01:07:04,592 --> 01:07:05,792
Give me the gun.

1445
01:07:05,794 --> 01:07:07,426
Zach, give me the gun.

1446
01:07:07,428 --> 01:07:08,460
He's trying to fuck
with you, and he's

1447
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:09,727
trying to get in your head.

1448
01:07:11,496 --> 01:07:13,029
I'm sorry.

1449
01:07:13,031 --> 01:07:14,196
I'm so sorry.

1450
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:15,297
Be cool.

1451
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:17,265
Man, I'm sorry.

1452
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,533
I'm not having a good day.

1453
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:22,936
This conversation
is fucking over,

1454
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,337
do you understand me?

1455
01:07:24,604 --> 01:07:25,704
No problem.

1456
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:30,741
I didn't mean to upset anybody.

1457
01:07:31,509 --> 01:07:33,710
It's just a healthy exchange
of views, that's all.

1458
01:07:37,648 --> 01:07:39,315
All I was trying to do
is shed some sunlight

1459
01:07:39,317 --> 01:07:42,017
as to what would warrant
some strange guy's jizz

1460
01:07:42,019 --> 01:07:44,886
all over his little
princess' tits, that's all.

1461
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:00,698
-Shit, calm down!
-Get the fuck off me!

1462
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:01,899
He's fucking with me!

1463
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,533
Jesus Christ, you're
gonna fucking kill him.

1464
01:08:03,535 --> 01:08:04,867
What are you doing?

1465
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:06,101
I'm fine.

1466
01:08:06,735 --> 01:08:08,368
Yeah, you're fine, my
fucking ass, you're fine.

1467
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:10,936
Jesus Christ. Ah.

1468
01:08:12,638 --> 01:08:14,405
What the hell is that?

1469
01:08:26,017 --> 01:08:27,450
It's a god damn microphone.

1470
01:08:28,318 --> 01:08:29,384
Holy shit!

1471
01:08:29,386 --> 01:08:30,818
He's fucking wired!

1472
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,986
-What?
-He's wired, Noah, like on TV?

1473
01:08:33,721 --> 01:08:35,521
You mean he's been
recording us this whole time?

1474
01:08:35,523 --> 01:08:36,855
Somebody has been!

1475
01:08:36,857 --> 01:08:38,156
You see anybody?

1476
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,158
-No.
-Fucking screwed.

1477
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,659
Who knows how far
that signal travels!

1478
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:43,460
Warren, smash that
thing, smash it!

1479
01:08:50,067 --> 01:08:51,232
Noah, you can stop.

1480
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:53,934
All right, all right!

1481
01:08:53,936 --> 01:08:55,135
Fuck!

1482
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,136
What the fuck?

1483
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:59,671
Who the fuck is out there,
you fucking son of a bitch?

1484
01:08:59,673 --> 01:09:00,972
Who's listening to us?

1485
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:06,543
Guys, I vote we get the fuck
outta here, right fucking now.

1486
01:09:06,545 --> 01:09:07,677
Yeah, I agree.

1487
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:10,579
Well, wait, wait, wait.
Hold up.

1488
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:11,813
Let's think about this.

1489
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:15,816
Now, if someone
was listening in,

1490
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:18,784
they woulda came through
that door, guns blazing,

1491
01:09:18,786 --> 01:09:20,619
long before now, no?

1492
01:09:20,621 --> 01:09:21,720
Zach's right.

1493
01:09:21,722 --> 01:09:23,054
We'd already be dead.

1494
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:24,188
And...

1495
01:09:27,358 --> 01:09:29,692
Ho, ho, ho.

1496
01:09:30,593 --> 01:09:32,594
- Oh, that's good.
- What?

1497
01:09:32,596 --> 01:09:33,861
That's fucking good.

1498
01:09:34,362 --> 01:09:35,462
What's good?

1499
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:37,296
You don't get it?

1500
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,231
He wasn't wearing
the wire for us.

1501
01:09:39,233 --> 01:09:40,932
He was wearing a
wire for his friends.

1502
01:09:43,634 --> 01:09:46,102
I'd be willing to bet money
that this fucking piece of shit

1503
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:48,471
is working for some
branch of law enforcement,

1504
01:09:48,473 --> 01:09:51,574
most likely the FBI, they
got him all fucking wired up.

1505
01:09:51,576 --> 01:09:54,577
So he can eavesdrop on
his fucking drug-pedaling

1506
01:09:54,579 --> 01:09:56,345
gangster fucking friends.

1507
01:09:56,713 --> 01:09:58,447
And put them all behind bars.

1508
01:09:58,449 --> 01:09:59,614
Isn't that right?

1509
01:10:00,983 --> 01:10:02,383
Isn't that right?

1510
01:10:03,385 --> 01:10:05,219
You fucking piece of shit.

1511
01:10:06,254 --> 01:10:07,687
Holy shit.

1512
01:10:07,921 --> 01:10:09,321
You say he's an informant?

1513
01:10:09,588 --> 01:10:11,989
Actually in his circles,
it's better known as a rat.

1514
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:13,523
Or a snitch.

1515
01:10:13,924 --> 01:10:16,258
Or maybe just a plain
cock-sucking weasel.

1516
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,627
So back in the alley
there, that was probably--

1517
01:10:18,629 --> 01:10:20,895
Most likely Feds chasing us.

1518
01:10:21,463 --> 01:10:22,930
We probably interrupted
one of their

1519
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:25,364
recording sessions
when we showed up.

1520
01:10:26,632 --> 01:10:27,999
I do not feel well.

1521
01:10:35,506 --> 01:10:39,841
Do you guys have any idea
how altogether fucked you are?

1522
01:10:40,475 --> 01:10:43,243
I think you're
confused on who's

1523
01:10:43,245 --> 01:10:45,545
in the fucking
doghouse right now.

1524
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,846
Now I'm not sure if
there's an official

1525
01:10:47,848 --> 01:10:50,615
gangsta handbook,
but I'm dead certain

1526
01:10:50,617 --> 01:10:52,783
that if there was one,
it would frown heavily upon

1527
01:10:52,785 --> 01:10:55,685
you recording conversations
with your gangsta friends.

1528
01:10:56,153 --> 01:10:58,354
I bet Uncle Demetrius
is gonna be tickled pink

1529
01:10:58,356 --> 01:11:00,522
when he finds out
about your bureau buddies.

1530
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:04,925
You guys look umm,
pleased with yourself.

1531
01:11:05,426 --> 01:11:06,692
I wouldn't say pleased.

1532
01:11:07,427 --> 01:11:11,429
What makes you think
my uncle, or anyone

1533
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:15,098
from my side of the
fence is gonna believe

1534
01:11:15,532 --> 01:11:18,934
an inconceivable lie like that?

1535
01:11:21,971 --> 01:11:23,204
What you gonna do?

1536
01:11:25,273 --> 01:11:26,873
You gonna show him that mush?

1537
01:11:31,379 --> 01:11:33,212
And you clowns
were worried about

1538
01:11:33,214 --> 01:11:34,813
what I was gonna do to you.

1539
01:11:34,815 --> 01:11:36,114
Have you ever bumped heads with

1540
01:11:36,315 --> 01:11:37,615
the type of cats at the
other end of this wire?

1541
01:11:38,316 --> 01:11:39,516
Huh?

1542
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:41,250
It's what's known as
a task force, fellas.

1543
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:43,018
Those motherfuckers
have killed

1544
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,286
more motherfuckers than...

1545
01:11:45,288 --> 01:11:47,021
...than you've had hand jobs.

1546
01:11:48,156 --> 01:11:50,557
And you just kidnapped
they star witness.

1547
01:11:50,559 --> 01:11:52,892
In the middle

1548
01:11:53,326 --> 01:11:57,929
of a six-month,
round-the-clock surveillance!

1549
01:12:01,832 --> 01:12:04,099
You guys
are fucking fertilizer.

1550
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:07,301
Hey, Eddie.

1551
01:12:08,002 --> 01:12:10,036
Everything's set,
time and place.

1552
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:11,303
All right, let's call 'em.

1553
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:22,779
Eddie.

1554
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,114
Yeah, good news,
uh, ready for pick up.

1555
01:12:26,549 --> 01:12:27,815
You're ready for pick up?

1556
01:12:30,318 --> 01:12:31,951
Well, there's been a
change of plan, Eddie.

1557
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:33,552
What are you talking
about, there's been

1558
01:12:33,554 --> 01:12:35,086
a change of plans?

1559
01:12:35,854 --> 01:12:37,954
The kind where I
fucking call you back!

1560
01:12:39,389 --> 01:12:40,722
What...

1561
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,090
motherfucker hung up on me!

1562
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,724
Get the fuck out.

1563
01:12:44,425 --> 01:12:45,558
You shouldn't
have hung up on him,

1564
01:12:46,059 --> 01:12:47,559
Why'd you hang up on him?
You shouldn't have--

1565
01:12:47,561 --> 01:12:48,626
Shut up, Noah.

1566
01:12:48,927 --> 01:12:50,060
I can't hear myself
fucking think.

1567
01:12:50,062 --> 01:12:51,394
Oh, sure, no, that's great.

1568
01:12:51,396 --> 01:12:52,895
Guys, let's give
Zach time to think.

1569
01:12:52,897 --> 01:12:54,396
What the fuck are you doing?

1570
01:12:54,563 --> 01:12:55,763
Don't you think that
before you hang up on a guy

1571
01:12:55,765 --> 01:12:57,264
who's most likely gonna see us

1572
01:12:57,431 --> 01:12:58,531
sleeping with the fucking
fishes, you should of

1573
01:12:58,533 --> 01:13:00,065
consulted with us first?

1574
01:13:00,067 --> 01:13:01,533
Are you fucking yelling at me?

1575
01:13:01,535 --> 01:13:03,101
Yes I'm fucking
yelling at you!

1576
01:13:03,103 --> 01:13:04,836
Whoa guys, yelling won't help!

1577
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:06,571
I'm just trying to have
some fucking input here.

1578
01:13:06,573 --> 01:13:07,838
We wouldn't even be
in this fucking mess

1579
01:13:08,072 --> 01:13:09,405
if it wasn't for you,
shut the fuck up!

1580
01:13:09,407 --> 01:13:10,606
Shut up!

1581
01:13:11,007 --> 01:13:12,240
Eddie Lovato?

1582
01:13:12,242 --> 01:13:13,674
Oh, great, fucking great.

1583
01:13:15,176 --> 01:13:16,776
That's who's behind all this?

1584
01:13:16,778 --> 01:13:18,477
Why he got beef with me?

1585
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,079
What the fuck he want with me?

1586
01:13:22,214 --> 01:13:23,681
Do me the decency
of a straight answer

1587
01:13:23,683 --> 01:13:25,115
with the fucking state I'm in.

1588
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,650
Fine, have it your way.

1589
01:13:29,184 --> 01:13:30,417
What's the difference?

1590
01:13:31,419 --> 01:13:33,386
Y'all wrote your
own obits anyway.

1591
01:13:33,388 --> 01:13:34,887
You just shut the fuck up?

1592
01:13:34,889 --> 01:13:36,188
Yeah, shut the fuck
up, you fucking love

1593
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:37,589
hearing yourself fucking talk!

1594
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:38,923
You shut the fuck up!

1595
01:13:38,925 --> 01:13:40,591
You think you a lion?

1596
01:13:40,593 --> 01:13:41,792
You a mouse!

1597
01:13:42,059 --> 01:13:43,959
I dare you to untie
me, motherfucker!

1598
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:47,462
--Everybody, shut the fuck up!

1599
01:13:48,096 --> 01:13:49,296
Shut up!

1600
01:13:49,298 --> 01:13:50,864
Jesus Christ!

1601
01:13:50,866 --> 01:13:52,632
I'm gonna tape
his fucking mouth.

1602
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,640
Yeah, okay, great.

1603
01:14:02,642 --> 01:14:04,274
Yeah, I know where it is.

1604
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:07,009
All right, I appreciate it.

1605
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:08,844
Thanks.

1606
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:11,313
Who was that?

1607
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:13,381
That was a guy I
did some work with

1608
01:14:13,383 --> 01:14:14,882
a couple months back.

1609
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:16,483
He works at the
Treasury Department.

1610
01:14:16,817 --> 01:14:18,384
He says our only
course of action

1611
01:14:18,386 --> 01:14:21,487
right now at this moment,
is to turn ourselves in.

1612
01:14:22,055 --> 01:14:23,155
Voluntarily.

1613
01:14:23,723 --> 01:14:25,056
What about him?

1614
01:14:25,058 --> 01:14:26,490
If he is who he thinks he is,

1615
01:14:26,492 --> 01:14:28,458
they'll be happy
to have him back.

1616
01:14:29,226 --> 01:14:30,492
Where's the car?

1617
01:14:30,494 --> 01:14:31,626
It's out back.

1618
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,160
All right, well, give
me the fucking keys.

1619
01:14:33,561 --> 01:14:34,661
What about Eddie?
What about his niece?

1620
01:14:34,663 --> 01:14:36,396
Fuck Eddie, fuck his niece!

1621
01:14:36,398 --> 01:14:38,698
We're going to the FBI,
this ends right now!

1622
01:14:38,899 --> 01:14:40,466
This is it, this is
it, we're going to jail.

1623
01:14:40,468 --> 01:14:41,934
We're going to jail
for God knows how long.

1624
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:43,001
And when we get out,
Eddie'll kill us,

1625
01:14:43,003 --> 01:14:44,168
or maybe Marques'll kill us.

1626
01:14:44,502 --> 01:14:45,468
Or maybe we'll just
die in jail, butt raped

1627
01:14:46,002 --> 01:14:46,835
with a bullet in the
back of our head.

1628
01:14:46,837 --> 01:14:47,969
Thanks, Zach, fuck!

1629
01:14:48,303 --> 01:14:49,303
I agree with Noah,
we need to stick to

1630
01:14:49,305 --> 01:14:50,804
the original plan, Zach.

1631
01:14:50,806 --> 01:14:52,038
Did you hear what I just said?

1632
01:14:52,639 --> 01:14:54,106
I can't believe you're not
backing me up on this, Bryce!

1633
01:14:54,108 --> 01:14:55,440
What do you think
Eddie's gonna do to us?

1634
01:14:55,442 --> 01:14:57,842
Look, this is
a true life line.

1635
01:14:58,777 --> 01:15:00,144
Trust me!

1636
01:15:02,013 --> 01:15:03,580
Give me the god damn car keys.

1637
01:15:04,114 --> 01:15:05,881
Give me the god damn car keys!

1638
01:15:06,115 --> 01:15:07,348
Give him the fucking keys.

1639
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:11,151
I'm gonna pull the car around.

1640
01:15:11,752 --> 01:15:12,852
All right?

1641
01:15:12,854 --> 01:15:13,919
This is a good thing.

1642
01:15:14,587 --> 01:15:15,820
I'll be right back.

1643
01:15:15,822 --> 01:15:17,354
Get Socrates ready.

1644
01:15:33,637 --> 01:15:35,137
You hung up on me.

1645
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:39,507
Uh, Mr. Lovato, I mean, Eddie.

1646
01:15:39,509 --> 01:15:40,875
I was gonna call you back.

1647
01:15:52,687 --> 01:15:53,953
Hello, Marques.

1648
01:15:53,955 --> 01:15:55,187
Fuck you.

1649
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:57,155
Sounds like he's
happy to see us.

1650
01:15:57,157 --> 01:15:58,556
How'd you find us?

1651
01:15:58,857 --> 01:16:00,691
What's it matter? The important
thing is, we're here.

1652
01:16:00,693 --> 01:16:02,059
You boys did good.

1653
01:16:02,061 --> 01:16:03,527
Your parents should be proud.

1654
01:16:03,861 --> 01:16:06,195
So I just have one little
favor to ask of you,

1655
01:16:06,197 --> 01:16:07,863
one little detail,
and we're done.

1656
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:09,531
Consider the slate clean.

1657
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:11,031
That's it, it's over?

1658
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,198
Yeah.

1659
01:16:12,465 --> 01:16:13,598
No need in discussing
that this guy

1660
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:15,865
had a fucking wire on him
when we picked him up?

1661
01:16:18,034 --> 01:16:19,868
You already knew
that, didn't you?

1662
01:16:20,169 --> 01:16:21,569
Look Zach, I think the
less we know the better.

1663
01:16:21,571 --> 01:16:22,803
Shut the fuck up!

1664
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,537
Zach, Noah's right, let's
just get this over with.

1665
01:16:26,406 --> 01:16:27,906
What's left?

1666
01:16:27,908 --> 01:16:30,842
Okay, I need each of you
to put a bullet in him.

1667
01:16:30,844 --> 01:16:31,943
What?

1668
01:16:32,344 --> 01:16:33,544
Yes.

1669
01:16:34,012 --> 01:16:35,245
Now I know you're asking
why, but I'm gonna give you

1670
01:16:35,247 --> 01:16:36,813
that two-part answer, okay?

1671
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:45,621
Okay one, my niece, done,
safe, I'm happy, phew.

1672
01:16:46,055 --> 01:16:47,388
All right?

1673
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:49,323
Uh. But I do not
need Marques alive.

1674
01:16:50,224 --> 01:16:52,091
Okay, and two, and this
is for your protection

1675
01:16:52,093 --> 01:16:53,759
as well as for mine.

1676
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,160
I can't have you guys
talking about this.

1677
01:16:56,162 --> 01:16:58,262
My feeling is that
accessory to murder

1678
01:16:58,264 --> 01:17:00,931
is the greatest
motivation for you guys

1679
01:17:00,933 --> 01:17:02,399
to shut the fuck up.

1680
01:17:03,033 --> 01:17:05,734
Eddie, this is none of
our business, you know?

1681
01:17:05,736 --> 01:17:07,569
I mean we would
never say anything.

1682
01:17:07,571 --> 01:17:11,172
I know that you
wouldn't talk about it,

1683
01:17:11,174 --> 01:17:13,174
but I need an insurance policy.

1684
01:17:13,176 --> 01:17:15,276
Come on!
It's simple.

1685
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:18,578
So, all you have to do is
decide who's gonna be first.

1686
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:20,580
And you guys can decide
amongst yourselves,

1687
01:17:20,582 --> 01:17:21,981
I don't really care
who's first.

1688
01:17:22,749 --> 01:17:24,116
Let's go, come on.

1689
01:17:24,118 --> 01:17:26,017
- Let's do it.

1690
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:32,388
Noah, you go first.

1691
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:33,889
-What?
-You go first.

1692
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:34,990
What, no!

1693
01:17:35,358 --> 01:17:36,424
You fucking got us
into this fucking mess!

1694
01:17:36,426 --> 01:17:37,525
You're going first!

1695
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:38,659
No!

1696
01:17:39,193 --> 01:17:40,893
It's only fucking fair
that you fucking go first!

1697
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:42,027
No!

1698
01:17:42,294 --> 01:17:43,727
No?

1699
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:45,562
You fucking little
fucking parasite!

1700
01:17:45,564 --> 01:17:46,863
Fuck you, Zach!

1701
01:17:47,097 --> 01:17:49,264
Fucking shoot him, you
little fucking parasite!

1702
01:17:49,266 --> 01:17:50,965
We're not in
high school anymore,

1703
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:52,399
you can't just order me around!

1704
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,134
If you don't
fucking shoot him,

1705
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:56,402
I swear to God I'm
gonna fucking shoot you!

1706
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:58,070
Zach, what the fuck,
put the gun down!

1707
01:17:58,072 --> 01:18:00,272
You wanna fucking
shoot him Bryce?

1708
01:18:00,274 --> 01:18:01,940
Leave Noah alone, put
the fucking gun down.

1709
01:18:01,942 --> 01:18:03,141
Fuck you!

1710
01:18:05,611 --> 01:18:09,279
If you don't shoot him, by
the time I count to three,

1711
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,114
I swear to God I'm
gonna fucking shoot you.

1712
01:18:12,116 --> 01:18:13,215
Zach!

1713
01:18:13,549 --> 01:18:15,149
I am not your
fucking bitch anymore!

1714
01:18:15,151 --> 01:18:16,917
Yes you are, you
are my fucking bitch!

1715
01:18:16,919 --> 01:18:18,118
Fuck you!

1716
01:18:18,285 --> 01:18:19,218
You have always
been my fucking bitch!

1717
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:20,886
Test me!
One!

1718
01:18:22,955 --> 01:18:24,555
-Two!
-Fuck you!

1719
01:18:50,009 --> 01:18:52,310
Jesus fucking Christ, Warren!

1720
01:18:52,644 --> 01:18:54,311
Oh, my fucking God
he's fucking dead,

1721
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,513
he's fucking dead, there's
a fucking dead guy!

1722
01:18:56,515 --> 01:18:57,680
Warren, are you okay?

1723
01:18:57,847 --> 01:18:59,447
-What the fuck?
-Far from fucking okay.

1724
01:18:59,449 --> 01:19:00,548
Fuck!

1725
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:02,650
Uh. Hey, fellas?

1726
01:19:02,652 --> 01:19:04,385
We don't have all night.
Who's next?

1727
01:19:04,819 --> 01:19:06,319
Ah, come on!

1728
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:07,420
Mr. Lovato?

1729
01:19:08,188 --> 01:19:09,588
Noah, yes.

1730
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:11,690
Technically Warren
shot Marques three times

1731
01:19:11,692 --> 01:19:13,458
and since there's four
of us, I was wondering

1732
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,493
maybe if you would
consider the possibility

1733
01:19:15,495 --> 01:19:17,861
of just one of us left
having to shoot him?

1734
01:19:19,363 --> 01:19:20,563
That's not possible.

1735
01:19:21,765 --> 01:19:23,098
Okay,
there you have it.

1736
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,799
We need another volunteer.

1737
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,100
Let's go.

1738
01:19:26,102 --> 01:19:27,367
Let's do it quickly, men.

1739
01:19:28,168 --> 01:19:29,268
Let's get it over with.

1740
01:19:29,702 --> 01:19:32,103
Somebody pick up that
gun, or you're all gonna

1741
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:34,905
wake up tomorrow with
a fucking toe tag.

1742
01:19:35,273 --> 01:19:36,873
We don't have all
night boys, come on.

1743
01:20:29,187 --> 01:20:30,453
Marques...

1744
01:20:31,922 --> 01:20:33,255
was a disappointment.

1745
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:04,251
Well, Noah, friends
think I should of tossed
you in with him.

1746
01:21:04,418 --> 01:21:05,718
What do you think?

1747
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:06,785
Really?

1748
01:21:06,787 --> 01:21:09,354
Well, I think if they got
to know me a little better,

1749
01:21:09,356 --> 01:21:10,822
they'd think differently.

1750
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:15,592
I'm sorry you had to go
through all this, Mr. Flemmings.

1751
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,694
But there's a lesson
to be learned here today.

1752
01:21:19,128 --> 01:21:21,929
You fuck people over, you end
up at the bottom of the lake.

1753
01:21:27,267 --> 01:21:30,869
So do I get the money or
do I end up in the lake?

1754
01:21:39,411 --> 01:21:40,844
<i> And thanks for
 agreeing to meet me</i>

1755
01:21:41,245 --> 01:21:42,311
<i> on such short notice, I
 know you're a busy guy,</i>

1756
01:21:42,612 --> 01:21:44,279
so you know, I
appreciate the gesture.

1757
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,180
I think you'll like this.

1758
01:21:48,716 --> 01:21:50,550
So a friend of mine
works for the FBI.

1759
01:21:52,452 --> 01:21:54,118
<i> White collar crime division.</i>

1760
01:21:56,287 --> 01:21:58,021
Hey, you guys ever
hear of Bidexco?

1761
01:21:58,255 --> 01:22:00,256
<i> A startup
 pharmaceutical company</i>

1762
01:22:00,258 --> 01:22:02,224
<i> was under heavy surveillance
 by federal authorities...</i>

1763
01:22:02,226 --> 01:22:03,792
<i> And one of the
 guys does a coffee run,</i>

1764
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,426
<i> brings my pal
 someone else's latte</i>

1765
01:22:05,428 --> 01:22:07,161
<i> with six spoonful's of sugar.</i>

1766
01:22:08,496 --> 01:22:10,296
<i> So he walks it over to the
 agent with a sweet tooth</i>

1767
01:22:10,298 --> 01:22:12,231
<i> who so happens to be
 working with an informant</i>

1768
01:22:12,233 --> 01:22:13,765
<i> who's spending
 all his afternoons</i>

1769
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:15,633
<i>putting his associates on tape.</i>

1770
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,233
<i> You wanna
 climb the corporate ladder,</i>

1771
01:22:17,235 --> 01:22:19,501
keep your motherfucking
mouth shut!

1772
01:22:20,236 --> 01:22:21,703
<i> You know what
 keeps me up at night?</i>

1773
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:23,771
<i> Knowing that when this cock
 sucker's done testifying,</i>

1774
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:24,805
we're gonna place him
in witness protection

1775
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:26,640
and buy him an Escalade.

1776
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:28,875
So when no one's
looking, why don't you just

1777
01:22:29,109 --> 01:22:30,542
plant one in the back
of his fucking head?

1778
01:22:33,145 --> 01:22:35,646
Noah, you do realize we're
no longer in Iraq, right?

1779
01:22:36,981 --> 01:22:38,848
But the guy
they're really after,

1780
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:41,383
the big prize,
Demetrius Flemmings.

1781
01:22:42,351 --> 01:22:45,719
Very popular with the DEA
Special Operations Division.

1782
01:22:47,088 --> 01:22:49,656
Now, from what I'm
told, the only thing

1783
01:22:49,658 --> 01:22:52,191
more important to
Flemmings than money

1784
01:22:52,193 --> 01:22:53,559
is his family.

1785
01:22:56,963 --> 01:23:00,229
Two million dollars cash
to whoever finds my nephew.

1786
01:23:02,165 --> 01:23:04,900
And that's why I have this.

1787
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:14,108
<i> Let me play it for you.</i>

1788
01:23:14,843 --> 01:23:17,176
<i> I think you'll agree,
the sound quality is excellent.</i>

1789
01:23:19,045 --> 01:23:21,279
<i> Nice work, Marques,</i>

1790
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:22,613
<i> I can't wait to see
 your uncle's face</i>

1791
01:23:22,615 --> 01:23:24,481
<i> when we play this back
 in court.</i>

1792
01:23:24,483 --> 01:23:25,882
<i> Yeah,
 fuck you Detective.</i>

1793
01:23:26,049 --> 01:23:27,082
<i> Next time,
 try taking this thing off</i>

1794
01:23:27,084 --> 01:23:29,250
<i> without taking my
 fucking skin with it.</i>

1795
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:31,517
And that's where you come in.

1796
01:23:33,786 --> 01:23:35,052
We're looking for Tyrone.

1797
01:23:35,353 --> 01:23:36,953
Do you know where
we can find Tyrone?

1798
01:23:36,955 --> 01:23:38,921
So, uh, Eddie says you
got an address for us.

1799
01:23:39,155 --> 01:23:40,288
Hey, hey, hey!

1800
01:23:40,522 --> 01:23:42,422
Tyrone, my man.
Got somethin' for ya.

1801
01:23:44,658 --> 01:23:46,291
<i> Nice work, Marques.</i>

1802
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,060
<i> when they're playing
 this back in court.</i>

1803
01:23:49,327 --> 01:23:50,660
<i> Yeah, fuck you Detective.</i>

1804
01:23:50,662 --> 01:23:51,927
<i> Next time, try
 taking this thing off</i>

1805
01:23:52,228 --> 01:23:53,928
<i> without taking my
 fucking skin with it.</i>

1806
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,563
<i> The way I see it,
 there's a lot of money</i>

1807
01:23:56,565 --> 01:23:57,764
<i> to be made here.</i>

1808
01:23:58,165 --> 01:24:00,866
<i> I get a third, my Army
 buddy gets a third...</i>

1809
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,633
Hoo-rah!

1810
01:24:02,635 --> 01:24:03,867
And you get a third.

1811
01:24:04,835 --> 01:24:06,535
And you've always
said, failing to plan

1812
01:24:06,537 --> 01:24:09,004
is planning to fail,
well you can rest assured

1813
01:24:09,006 --> 01:24:10,638
that while I'm still
working out

1814
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,907
a few last details, I will
have dotted all the i's

1815
01:24:13,909 --> 01:24:17,410
and crossed all the
t's, you have my word.

1816
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:20,078
So what do you
think, Uncle Eddie?

1817
01:24:21,013 --> 01:24:22,880
You came up with
this all by yourself?

1818
01:24:23,882 --> 01:24:24,882
Pretty much, yeah.

1819
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:27,916
That's fucking awesome.

1820
01:24:30,252 --> 01:24:31,719
<i> We say
 that the hour of death</i>

1821
01:24:31,721 --> 01:24:33,420
<i> cannot be forecast.</i>

1822
01:24:34,355 --> 01:24:38,057
But when we say this,
we imagine that hour

1823
01:24:38,059 --> 01:24:41,059
to be placed in an obscure
and distant future.

1824
01:24:43,395 --> 01:24:45,562
Do not take time for granted.

1825
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:48,598
There is only now.

1826
01:24:53,836 --> 01:24:55,436
<i> Let's do this, Warren!</i>

1827
01:24:55,438 --> 01:24:57,304
<i> All over it,
 you fucking sick fuck!</i>

1828
01:24:58,005 --> 01:24:59,805
<i> Hey, ladies. How's it goin'?</i>

1829
01:25:00,072 --> 01:25:01,906
-Yo, is it recording?
-Hey!

1830
01:25:02,073 --> 01:25:03,406
<i> I'm back!</i>

1831
01:25:05,909 --> 01:25:07,476
<i> This is fucked up, man.</i>

1832
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:09,444
<i> Get the fuck outta here,
 faggot!</i>

1833
01:25:09,912 --> 01:25:11,279
<i> Jesus.</i>

1834
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,080
<i>The man of the hour, everybody!</i>

1835
01:25:16,717 --> 01:25:18,917
<i> Faggot!</i>

1836
01:25:20,085 --> 01:25:23,120
<i> You know Zach
 and Matthew and I,</i>

1837
01:25:23,122 --> 01:25:26,022
we were pretty relentless
about torturing you

1838
01:25:26,024 --> 01:25:28,290
on a weekly basis.

1839
01:25:33,095 --> 01:25:34,595
Twenty-two days sober.

1840
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:35,928
No shit?

1841
01:25:41,867 --> 01:25:43,234
<i> On the count of three!</i>

1842
01:25:43,236 --> 01:25:44,435
<i> Everybody ready?</i>

1843
01:25:44,803 --> 01:25:49,439
<i> -One. Two. Three!
 -One. Two. Three!</i>

1844
01:26:03,086 --> 01:26:04,352
<i> Poodles!</i>

1845
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,987
<i> I feel like we're in
 high school, right now!</i>

1846
01:26:06,989 --> 01:26:08,321
<i> Right now, at this moment.</i>

1847
01:26:08,588 --> 01:26:09,821
<i> We always fuck with him.
 He loves it!</i>

1848
01:26:16,494 --> 01:26:20,529
I put every single one of
my clients into that stock.

1849
01:26:21,797 --> 01:26:23,597
You're having a
pretty shitty morning.

1850
01:26:23,599 --> 01:26:25,165
Yeah, yeah.

1851
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:26,633
Sorry in advance
for making it worse.

1852
01:26:26,635 --> 01:26:28,401
You know the man you
asked me to look into,

1853
01:26:28,403 --> 01:26:31,771
Eddie Lovato, seven
nephews, all boys.

1854
01:26:31,773 --> 01:26:33,072
He doesn't have a niece.

1855
01:26:33,306 --> 01:26:34,806
Until my niece gets
back, you're gonna do

1856
01:26:34,808 --> 01:26:36,274
exactly what I want you to do!

1857
01:26:36,276 --> 01:26:38,276
-No niece?
-No niece.

1858
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:39,744
<i> You don't
 wanna see my response</i>

1859
01:26:39,746 --> 01:26:40,711
<i> if something happens
 to her, buddy.</i>

1860
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:07,604
I'm not so sure that
it was an accident.

1861
01:27:07,606 --> 01:27:09,439
Matthew called me
a couple weeks ago.

1862
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:11,140
<i> Matt was getting
 harassed, and he thought</i>

1863
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:12,541
<i> he was being followed.</i>

1864
01:27:54,216 --> 01:27:56,417
You fucking whore.

1865
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:06,759
<i> How about you, Noah?
 You got a girlfriend?</i>

1866
01:28:06,761 --> 01:28:08,827
Matter of fact I do, yeah.

1867
01:28:08,829 --> 01:28:10,061
It's getting, well,
it's getting pretty

1868
01:28:10,063 --> 01:28:11,495
serious actually, yeah.

1869
01:28:11,497 --> 01:28:13,096
It's true what
they say, you know,

1870
01:28:13,098 --> 01:28:14,263
there's someone out there
for everyone, even him.

1871
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,166
Summer time's here, babe!

1872
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:19,734
Jesus, Noah,
how long's it take you

1873
01:28:19,736 --> 01:28:21,268
to pick up fucking ice cream?

1874
01:28:37,518 --> 01:28:38,751
Good timing.

1875
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:41,986
Nice work, kid.

1876
01:28:42,253 --> 01:28:43,286
You know, all these
years I kept you away

1877
01:28:43,854 --> 01:28:45,087
from the family business,
'cause my sister,

1878
01:28:45,089 --> 01:28:46,788
she wanted it that way.

1879
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:48,789
You know, said you
didn't have the stomach

1880
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:50,590
or the head for it but...

1881
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:52,592
Boy, was she wrong.

1882
01:28:53,427 --> 01:28:55,127
What do you say
you come work for me?

1883
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:57,729
Aw, thanks for the offer
but, uh,

1884
01:28:57,731 --> 01:28:59,764
you know, I met a girl,
Uncle Eddie and she wants

1885
01:28:59,766 --> 01:29:02,099
to get away from
all this, you know?

1886
01:29:03,101 --> 01:29:04,468
Can you blame her?

1887
01:29:05,102 --> 01:29:06,602
Well, you know where to come.

1888
01:29:06,604 --> 01:29:08,303
If it doesn't work out, okay?

1889
01:29:08,904 --> 01:29:10,571
Uncle Eddie!
Come here!

1890
01:29:10,573 --> 01:29:12,239
I love you! Oh!

1891
01:29:12,241 --> 01:29:13,440
Awesome, let's go.

1892
01:29:13,442 --> 01:29:14,707
See ya, kid.
