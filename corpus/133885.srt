1
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,700
She shivers in the wind like the last leaf on a dying tree

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
I let her hear my footsteps

3
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,400
She only goes stiff for a moment

4
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Care for a smoke?

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,600
Sure. I'll take one

6
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,500
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

7
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,600
I didn't come here for the party

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,300
I came here for you

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,500
I've watched you for days

10
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,400
You're everything a man could ever want

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,000
It's just not your face

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,500
Your... figure

13
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
Or your voice

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,500
It's your eyes

15
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,200
All the things I see in your eyes

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
What is it you see in my eyes?

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,100
I see a crazy calm

18
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,900
You're sick of running

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,900
You're ready to face what you have to face

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,700
But you don't want to face it alone

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,400
No

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,300
I don't want to face it alone

23
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,900
The wind rises electric

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,500
She's soft and warm and almost weightless

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,800
Her perfume is sweet promise that brings tears to my eyes

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,000
I tell her that everything will be alright

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,000
That I'll save her from whatever she's scared of and take her far far away

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,400
I tell her... I love her

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,400
The silencer makes a whisper of the gunshot

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,800
I hold her close until she's gone

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll never know what she's running from

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,900
I'll cash her check in the morning

33
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,500
Just 1 hour to go. My last day on the job

34
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,500
Early retirement. Not my idea

35
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,300
Doctor's orders. Heart condition

36
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,500
"Angina", he calls it

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,400
I'm polishing my badge and getting myself used to the idea of saying "Goodbye" to it

38
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,700
It and the 35 years of protecting and serving and tears and...

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,700
blood and terror, triumph that represents

40
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,100
I'm thinking of Aileen's slow smile

41
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
about the thick fat steak she picked up at the butcher's today

42
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,100
I'm thinking about the one loose end I haven't tied up

43
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
A young girl who's out there somewhere

44
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,600
helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic

45
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,200
Damnit, Hartigan

46
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,800
I won't let you do this, you're going to get yourself killed

47
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,600
You're going to get us both killed

48
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,300
I won't let you. I'm warning you

49
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,700
Let go of my coat, Bob

50
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,500
You're draggin me down with you. I'm your partner

51
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,000
They can kill me too. I ain't putting up with that

52
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm getting on the horn and calling for backup

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,700
Sure, Bob. We'll just wait

54
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,400
Sit on our ass while that sick Rourk brat gets his sick thrills with victim number 4

55
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Victim number 4

56
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Nancy Callahan, age 11

57
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,200
And she'll be raped and slashed to ribbons

58
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,400
and that backup that we're waiting on

59
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
will just so happen to show up just late enough

60
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,200
for Rourk to get back to his U.S. Senator daddy

61
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
Take a deep breath, Hartigan

62
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600
Settle down and think straight

63
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,600
You're pushing 60 and you got a bum ticker

64
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,900
You ain't saving anyone

65
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,800
Got a great attitude, Bob

66
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,800
Real credit to the force, you are

67
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,300
Aileen's home waiting for you. Think about Aileen

68
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,100
Heck, Bob

69
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,400
Maybe you are right

70
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm glad to hear you're finally talking sense

71
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,800
Hell of way to end a partnership

72
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,400
Hell of a way to start my retirement

73
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,600
Nancy Callahan, age 11

74
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,900
For all I know, she's dead already

75
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
You've been a very good, Nancy

76
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,500
You've been very quiet

77
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Don't be scared

78
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,700
We're going to be taking you home really soon

79
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,100
But first, we're going to introduce you to somebody

80
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,500
He's a very nice man

81
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,500
Half way to the warehouse where Weevil said they took her and it hits

82
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Wicked spot of indegestion

83
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,200
At least that's what I pray it is

84
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,400
I seek only the most lighthearted and momentary degression

85
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,200
The briefest indulgement in automotive pleasure

86
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,300
...for cheap thrills. Such shortlived durability, Mr. Shlubb

87
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,400
You would risk engendering an ill will on the part of our employers

88
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,400
Burt Shlubb and Douglass Klump

89
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,300
2 any-job-there-is thugs with dellusions of eloquance

90
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,500
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,800
temporarily remanded to our customer, though it may be

92
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,100
remains the property of the son of Senator Rourk

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,700
Got to keep this quiet

94
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
Take them down fast

95
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,800
A single dent, the mearest scratch, thereupon on the before

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,400
mentioned consequences of which I so recently made mention

97
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,000
shall surely be afford us

98
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,900
Catch your breath. Give your heart time to slow down

99
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,500
But it won't slow down

100
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Get over it

101
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,400
She needs you

102
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,500
We're all done here, Benny

103
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,300
Let's give them some time together

104
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,100
Give them some privacy

105
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Be with you in a minute, Lenny

106
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm just making sure they get along really well

107
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,400
What kind of beast couldn't get along with a precious little girl like this

108
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,600
You must be awfully scared now

109
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,000
But you got nothing to be scared of

110
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,100
All we're going to do is have a nice little talk

111
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,300
That's all. Just a nice talk, just you and me

112
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,100
Don't you cry now

113
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,000
Doctor said it'd be like this

114
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,700
Just take the pill he gave you

115
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,500
No need to play it quiet. Not anymore

116
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,000
Breath steady old man. Prove you're not completely useless

117
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
What the hell. Go out with a bang

118
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,700
He likes to hear them scream

119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,200
I've seen his victims and their twisted little faces

120
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed

121
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,700
frozen in their last horrible moment of living

122
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,700
No screams. Either I'm just in time or I'm way too late

123
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,000
It's nothing. Barely a flesh wound

124
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,800
On your feet, old man

125
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,300
Rourk

126
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
Give it up

127
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,900
Let the girl go

128
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,400
You can't do a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan

129
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
You know who I am

130
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,300
You know who my father is

131
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,100
You can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop

132
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,300
Look at you. You can't even lift that cannon you're carrying

133
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,000
Sure I can

134
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,800
Cover your eyes, Nancy

135
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,300
I don't want you watching this

136
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,800
I mean it baby. Cover your eyes right now

137
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,100
I take his weapons away

138
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,100
Both of them

139
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,600
Hell of a way to end a partnership

140
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
For God's sakes, don't make it any worse

141
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,500
Don't make me kill you

142
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,100
I'm doing fine, Bob

143
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Never better

144
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,300
Ready to kick your ass

145
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Keep it talking

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
By time, just a few more minutes. Just until backup gets here

147
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,600
Sit down and stay down

148
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I'll kill you if I have to

149
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
Keep his mind off the girl

150
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,900
Skinny little Nancy

151
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,300
Can't kill her once the backup gets here

152
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,700
Run home, Nancy. Run for your life

153
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,600
Hey. Don't listen to him, he's a crazy man

154
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,300
A tough man you are, huh?

155
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,900
You stay right where you're at

156
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,400
You shoot your partner in the back

157
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,500
then you try to scare a little girl

158
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,100
Later, I'll pull my spare rod. Plug you a couple times. Show you how it's done

159
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,100
We could've worked something out, but you've blown that

160
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,700
Sit down or I'll blast you in half

161
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
You're so slow, you'll never stop me

162
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,200
Sit down

163
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
You'll never be able to stop me

164
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,900
I finally sit down, just like you told me to

165
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,600
The sirens are close now. She'll be safe

166
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,700
Things go dark. I don't mind much

167
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,300
Getting sleepy. It's OK

168
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,500
She'll be safe

169
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,200
An old man dies. Little girl lives

170
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,500
Fair trade

171
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
THE HARD GOOD-BYE

172
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,800
The night is hot as hell

173
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,800
It's a lousy room in a lousy part of a lousy town

174
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,500
I'm staring at a goddess

175
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,100
She's telling me she wants me

176
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,300
I'm not going to waste one more second wondering how I've gotten so lucky

177
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
I want you

178
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,700
She smells like angels ought to smell

179
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,300
The perfect woman

180
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,300
The goddess

181
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,100
I need you

182
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,000
Goldie

183
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
She says her name is Goldie

184
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,400
3 hours later and my head's feeling several sizes too big

185
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,900
and that cold thing happens to my stomach

186
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,300
and I realize Goldie is dead

187
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Not a mark on her

188
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,000
You'd have to check her pulse to notice those perfect breasts

189
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,900
of hers aren't moving like they would if she was breathing

190
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,100
She was murdered and I was right here when it happened

191
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,200
Lying next to her

192
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,900
stone drunk, just like she was

193
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,400
Damnit Goldie. Who are you and who wanted you dead?

194
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,200
Who are you besides an angel of mercy giving a 2-time loser like me the night of his life

195
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,600
It sure wasn't my looks

196
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,000
So why the sleazy salloon

197
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,500
Why the kindest Goldie

198
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,400
The cops

199
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,200
They're telling me too much

200
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,000
Showing up before anybody but me and the killer could know there's been a murder

201
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,300
Somebody paid good money for this frame

202
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,700
No reason at all to play it quiet

203
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,200
No reason to play it any way but my way

204
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,700
Whoever killed you is going to pay, Goldie

205
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,500
Open up. Police

206
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,200
I'll be right out

207
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,200
I don't know why you died, Goldie

208
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,200
I don't know why and I don't know how. I never even met you before tonight

209
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,800
But you were a friend and more when I needed one

210
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,600
And when I found out who did it

211
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,500
it won't be quick and quiet like it was with you

212
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,900
It'll be loud and nasty. My kind of kill

213
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,100
And when his eyes go dead, the Hell I send him to will seem like Heaven after what I've done to him

214
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,100
I love you Goldie

215
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Claire?

216
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,600
Don't worry, Lucille. I was just grazed

217
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,100
Got any beers around this place?

218
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
No way I'm giving you any alcohol

219
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,600
Besides, it's not what you came here for anyway, is it

220
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,700
No

221
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Go ahead. It work's without them

222
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Thanks. You're the best

223
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,400
Lucille's my parole officer. She's a dyke, but God knows why

224
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,300
With that body of her's, she could have any man she wants

225
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,200
The pills come from a girlfriend who's a shrink

226
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,900
She tried to analyze me once, but she got too scared

227
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,700
Haven't seen you like this in awhile

228
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,100
Had a fight with some cops

229
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Didn't happen to kill any of them, did you?

230
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,200
Not that I know of

231
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
But they know they've been in a fight, that's for damn sure

232
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,800
How the hell do you suppose I'm going to square this with the board

233
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,700
There ain't no squaring it, not this time

234
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,300
This isn't some bar room brawl

235
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,900
or some creep with a gas can trying to torch someone

236
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,100
Hey hey, this is big

237
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,000
Settle down, Marv. Take another pill

238
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,800
Hey, there isn't no settling down

239
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,700
This is blood for blood and by the gallons

240
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,400
This is the old day, and the bad days, the all or nothing days. They're back

241
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,100
There's no choices left

242
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
And I'm ready for war

243
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,900
Prison was hell for you Marv. It's going to be life this time

244
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,000
How's waking up every goddamn day and not even knowing why you're here

245
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
But I'm out now

246
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,600
It took somebody who was kind to me. Getting killed to do it

247
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,700
But I'm out

248
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,900
I know exactly what I got to do

249
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,400
So you were scared, weren't you Goldie

250
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,000
Somebody wanted you dead and you knew it

251
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,900
So you hit the salloons, the bad places

252
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,400
Looking for the biggest meanest lug around, and finding me

253
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,000
Well I'm going to find that son of a bitch that killed you

254
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,300
and I'm going to give him the hard good-bye

255
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,800
Walk down the right back alley in sin city

256
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,300
and you can find anything

257
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,300
That coat looks like ???

258
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,400
serves your face

259
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Take off

260
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,500
He's new here, Marv. He didn't know

261
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,700
Katie's my kind of joint

262
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,000
Nancy's just getting started with her gig, but already the crowd's breathing hard

263
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy

264
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,500
shoulder to shoulder with all the other losers like me

265
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
But that's not what I'm looking for tonight

266
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,500
What'll it be, Marv?

267
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,300
A shot and a brew, Shellie, and keep it coming

268
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
Sure, honey. You take it slow now

269
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Most people think Marv is crazy

270
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,300
He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century

271
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,500
He'd be right at home on some ancient battlefield, swinging an axe into somebody's face

272
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Or in a Roman arena taking a sword to other Gladiators like him

273
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
They'd have tossed him girls like Nancy back then

274
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,400
Show's over, dickwad

275
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,300
Drink up

276
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,200
Now that's one fine-looking coat you're wearing there

277
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,500
You're killing days are over, you over-the-hill do-gooder son of a bitch

278
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,500
I love hitmen. No matter what you do to them, you don't feel bad

279
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,700
Take it off

280
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
What?

281
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,800
Fine coat like that, and you're bleeding all over it

282
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,400
Alright, it's all yours

283
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,700
Who was it you loosers who killed Goldie?

284
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,700
The guy who did that ... he knew what he was doing

285
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,800
So tell me, man, who sent you?

286
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
I don't hear you giving me any names

287
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,900
So I guess when I shot you in the belly, I aimed a little too high

288
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,300
You keep holding out on me like this, and I'm going to have to get really nasty

289
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,600
It's Telly. Telly Stern... passed me the order

290
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,200
He runs the tables over at the Triple Ace Club

291
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Thanks again

292
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,700
Now the damnedest thing happens

293
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,500
For a second I smell the angel's smell that belonged to my Goldie

294
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,600
Just need my medicing is all

295
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,500
Bastard

296
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
You're going to pay for what you did to me

297
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,900
You like talking, Louie? How many got paid off for the frame, Louie?

298
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,600
How many for the kill?

299
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
It was Connely. He set me up

300
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,400
He'll never talk

301
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't know about you, but I'm having a ball

302
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,900
Connely talks. They all talk

303
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
And what have been your sins, my son?

304
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,500
Well, Padre. I don't want to keep you up all night, so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch

305
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,300
These here hands of mine, they got blood all over them

306
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,900
You're speaking... figuratively

307
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,200
I need to find something out, I just go out and

308
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,500
look for somebody that knows more than me and I go and I ask them

309
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,000
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard

310
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,300
That way, for instance, in fact, I killed 3 men tonight

311
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,700
totured them first

312
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,600
you might say I've been working my way up the food chain

313
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,800
First 2 are minnows, small time messengers

314
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,500
But it was Connely. They money man who fingered you, Padre

315
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,600
Dear Lord, Marv. This is a House of God

316
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
Just give me a damn name

317
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,900
Roark

318
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,200
You really are pushing your luck, Padre, feeding me garbage like that

319
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,300
It can't be that big

320
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
There's a farm out North Cross and Lennox

321
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,700
It's all there

322
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,700
Find out for yourself. While you're at it, ask yourself...

323
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,300
If that corpse of a slut is worth dying for

324
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,500
Worth dying for. Worth killing for. Worth going to hell for

325
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,300
Amen

326
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,500
These keys say the Padre drove a Mercedes

327
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,800
Or at least that's what they're passing off as a Mercedes these days

328
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,600
Modern cars. They all look like electric shavers

329
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,000
Goldie

330
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,700
Goldie

331
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
That couldn't be Goldie

332
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,000
It's my own fault, and nobody elses, that I got confused

333
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,800
I've been having so much fun I forgot to take my medicine

334
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
That wasn't Goldie back there. Goldie's dead

335
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,700
And that's the whole reason I've been doing what I've been doing

336
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,600
When you got a condition, it's bad to forget your medicine

337
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,200
The cold thing, it creeps into my gut and tells me one more time it won't let go

338
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,900
This is a bad place, this farm. People have died here

339
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,900
The wrong way

340
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
I don't want to fight, pooch

341
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,100
I got no gripe with you

342
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,900
Easy boy

343
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,900
No way I was going to use my gun on you, buddy

344
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,300
It's whoever owns you, I'm curious about

345
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,500
Because there's blood on your breath, and I think I know what kind

346
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,400
So I sniff around to see what's burried

347
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,400
Here we go

348
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,900
Impossible. Nobody can sneak up on me

349
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,600
I go blind. Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet

350
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Nobody except the one who snuck in that hotel room 2 nights ago

351
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,100
It was you, you bastard. You killed her. You killed Goldie. It was...

352
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,400
I blew it, Goldie. I found your killer, but he was better than me

353
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,500
Too quiet. Too quick. A killer born

354
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,200
Why didn't he finish the job?

355
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,500
He keeps the heads

356
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,600
He eats the rest

357
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Lucille?

358
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
It's not just that wolf of his

359
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,400
The wolfs just get scraps

360
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,700
Bones. It's him

361
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,300
He eats... people

362
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,100
He cooks them like they were steaks

363
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,800
Let's get you warm

364
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,000
Just like they were steaks

365
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,600
Now he's got both of us

366
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,500
It's alright. Take a nice slow breath

367
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Just look at the heads on the wall

368
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,600
Heads on the wall. The heads on the...

369
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,300
Son of a bitch. He kept smiling that damn smile

370
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,100
made me watch him... suck the meat off my fingers

371
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:33,700
He made me watch. He made me watch!

372
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,200
Christ, I could use a cigarette

373
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,000
Dames. Sometimes all they got to do is let it out

374
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,500
and a few buckets later, there's no way you'd know

375
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,800
You brought us some big trouble this time, Marv

376
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,600
Whoever's behind this little thing, has his connections right in the department

377
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Any leads?

378
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,500
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out that hooker almost before I did

379
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,800
What hooker?

380
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,400
The one you've been obsessing over. The dead one. Goldie

381
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
I didn't know she was a hooker

382
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,400
It doesn't make any difference about anything

383
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,300
But I didn't know that

384
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,500
She was high class stuff

385
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,200
She must've shown you quite a time

386
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,600
Wait. There's a car coming

387
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,700
Kevin

388
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,100
All I've got is a face... and a name

389
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,800
I'll see you later, Kevin

390
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,600
Let's go

391
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,900
They've done checking the house. They're coming this way

392
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
Bastards, I'll show them

393
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
You're not going to get any of us killed, Marv

394
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,500
No, don't shoot. Please, listen to me. I'm his parole officer

395
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,400
He's unconscious and unarmed. So there's no need to kill him

396
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,800
Captain. The target. There's no sign of him

397
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,900
Here's a sign

398
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,500
That there is one damn fine coat you're wearing

399
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,500
I keep coming back to that cop I just killed and what he told me

400
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,500
I was pretty steamed about what he'd done to Lucille

401
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,900
So I took my time with that son of a bitch

402
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,700
It wasn't until I showed him all those pieces of himself that he said... just a name

403
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,600
Patrick Henry Roark. Man of the cloth

404
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,300
He could've become President, but he chose to serve God

405
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,400
And along the way, he just happen to become the most powerful man of the State

406
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,200
He's brought down mayors and governors like they were nothing

407
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,700
He even made his rotten brother a U.S. Senator without breaking a sweat

408
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,100
And here he's going to get killed in the name of a dead hooker

409
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm getting used to the idea. More and more, I'm liking the sound of it

410
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,600
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts

411
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,400
What if I'm wrong?

412
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,200
I've got a condition

413
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,600
I get confused sometimes

414
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,500
And with Lucille dead, I can't get my medicine

415
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,700
What if I've imagined all of this

416
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,200
What if finally turn into what they've always said I was going to turn into

417
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,400
A maniac

418
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,900
A psychokiller

419
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Can't kill a man without knowing for sure you ought to

420
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,900
I've got to know for sure

421
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,300
The merchandise is on display, by the time I make my way to Old Town

422
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,800
For an hour or so, I ask around about Goldie

423
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,600
I don't get any answers, but I know I'm bound to

424
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,600
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker

425
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,000
And if she was, she has roots here. Friends, maybe even family

426
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,700
You can't be Goldie. Goldie's dead

427
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,900
Goldie. Yeah, sure, right.

428
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I haven't eaten anything or taken my medicine for days now

429
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,400
No wonder I'm seeing things

430
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,000
Bastard

431
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,800
He's crazy

432
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,100
Hit him again, Wendy... harder

433
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,600
Wait a minute. Why did she call you Wendie?

434
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,000
Because that's my name, you ape

435
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,100
Goldie was my sister

436
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,300
My twin sister

437
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
I guess she was the nice one

438
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:50,400
Goldie and the other 6. Where are they? What did you do to them?

439
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,000
You crazy goddamn broad. Just take a look at this mug.

440
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,800
Would any of you dames let me get close enough to you to kill you?

441
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,600
None of you would. But Goldie...

442
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,700
And only she did because she thought I could protect her

443
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,100
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn thing about those other girls tonight

444
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:16,000
But as soon as they hit me for a fall guy, they showed up, guns blazing

445
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
But they didn't get me

446
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,100
And I've been killing my way to the truth ever since

447
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:29,000
So go ahead doll... shoot me now. Or get the hell out my way

448
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,300
Nuts

449
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,000
OK, I better be getting all that sorted out

450
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,800
What the hell?

451
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,000
I tied those knots. That's my specialty

452
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,300
You sat there and took it, when you could've taken my gun away from me anytime you wanted to

453
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,000
Well, sure. I thought I might be able to talk some sense into you

454
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
And I probably would've had to paste you one

455
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,100
And I don't hurt girls

456
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,700
We need a pair of handcuffs

457
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,600
What style you want? I got a collection

458
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,100
Just give him the ones you got with you, Gail

459
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,700
It was a farmboy named Kevin who killed Goldie

460
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,600
But it was Cardinal Roark who was behind him and I don't know why

461
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,700
I know that sounds crazy

462
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,300
No it doesn't

463
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,300
Goldie worked the Clergy

464
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,000
Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap

465
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm too dumb to put the whole picture together yet, but...

466
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,600
she fires up 2 cigarettes and hands me one and i taste her lipstick on it

467
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,200
and suddenly my heart's pounding so loud I can't hear anything else

468
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,800
I wanna reach over and touch her and taste Goldie's sweat 1 more time

469
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,700
but she isn't Goldie

470
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,500
Yeah, yeah, this'll do

471
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,500
I'm also going to be needing a dozen 2-foot lengths of

472
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,500
This rubber tubing

473
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,700
And a spool of razor wire

474
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,300
A pair of those special gloves that'll... let me handle the wire

475
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,500
Beefing up the old home security, huh?

476
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,400
You bet your ass

477
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,200
She was my sister

478
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,100
So I'm in this one to the end

479
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,000
But why are you willing to go up against Roark for someone you barely know

480
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,400
She was nice to me. Gave me something I didn't even know existed

481
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:24,400
I wasn't never even able to... buy a woman. Yeah, the way I look

482
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,700
I take my mind off her and I crawl back inside myself

483
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,700
It's almost killing time, and I better get sharp

484
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,000
I check the list

485
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Rubber tubing

486
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,900
Gas

487
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Saw

488
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Gloves

489
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Cuffs

490
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Razor wire

491
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
Hatchet

492
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Gladys

493
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
And my mits

494
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,900
We're close enough. Pull over

495
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,700
Yes, Marv

496
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,200
Keep the engine running

497
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,300
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get the hell out of here. Don't look back

498
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,900
Kill him for me, Marv

499
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,300
Kill him good

500
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,000
I won't let you down

501
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,600
Heading downstairs to the kitchen. Getting himself a midnight snack

502
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,700
And I can guess what kind

503
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,400
Come on, you son of a bitch

504
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,300
Damn, he's slick

505
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,800
Is that the best you can do, creep?

506
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,000
That's right. Get personal, get close. I can take it

507
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,000
I got you, you little bastard. Let's see you hop around now

508
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,700
I try to slow my heart down and breath the fire out of my lungs

509
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,000
My muscles make me a 1,000 promises of pain to come

510
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,200
Let me do it, Marv

511
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,800
She was my sister, let me finish him

512
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,100
You wasn't supposed to come down here, Wendy

513
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh, but I wanted to ki...

514
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,700
I'm sorry kid, but I haven't even started with this creep

515
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,000
and I don't want you watching the rest

516
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,700
it'll give you nightmares

517
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,900
God, I got to tell you, I'm good and bushed

518
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,800
It's not that fight of our that did me in either

519
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,800
It's all that sawing and tying

520
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,000
It's not as easy as it looks

521
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,500
It could've been a real mess around here if I didn't have that tubing for... turniquettes

522
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,000
I got to admit... there was a spurt or 2

523
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,900
You get the scent in the air. To get that friend of yours to come running

524
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Well, what do you know. Look who's here

525
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,700
Here he comes

526
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,700
That's a good dog

527
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,800
He doesn't scream. Not even when the mutt's had its fill

528
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,100
and Kevin's guts are lying all over the place

529
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,100
but somehow the bastard is still alive, still staring at me

530
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,100
Not even when I grab the saw and finish the job

531
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,000
He never screams

532
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:49,000
I put in a call to Katie's and ask Nancy to get her clothes on and meet me at her place

533
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
She say's "Yes" like always

534
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,500
Hey, Nancy. You got any beers?

535
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
Sure, Marv. Who's the babe?

536
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,000
There isn't much of anything Nancy wouldn't do for me

537
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,900
not since a year back when her frat boy roughed her up and I straightened him out but good

538
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,500
it really gets my goat when guys rough up dames

539
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,400
So what do you want me to do with her?

540
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,000
Well, your best bet is... drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks

541
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,100
What about you? Are you leaving town?

542
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,800
Hell no. I like it here

543
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,400
I hotwire a parked cab and stay under the speed limit so as not to get any attention

544
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,600
My head starts to clear, and things start to make sense

545
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,600
I owe you, Goldie. I owe you 1, and I'm going to pay up

546
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,900
So going after Roark means dying, win, or lose?

547
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,200
Hell, I'll die laughing if I know I've done this one thing right

548
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,900
Quiet as a grave out here. No sign of target

549
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Alright, keep a lookout

550
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,800
Kevin?

551
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,000
What's left of him, anyways

552
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,500
The dog ate the rest

553
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,100
Oh, my God

554
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,500
You monster

555
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,700
You... demon

556
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,600
Don't scream of I'll plug you

557
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,400
He had the voice... of an angel

558
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,600
Yet he spoke only to me

559
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,000
And he's dead now because of 1 stupid whore

560
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,100
It's not a real good idea for you to talk about Goldie that way... while I'm around

561
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,000
When he came to me

562
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,200
He was a tormented boy

563
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,300
Tormented by guilt

564
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,000
I tried to council him

565
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,600
But the eating. It filled him with white light

566
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,000
tearful, he swore to me that he felt the touch of God almighty

567
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,200
What the hell do you know?

568
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,800
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people

569
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,100
He didn't just eat their bodies. He ate their souls

570
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,900
And I joined in

571
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,900
They were all whores

572
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,000
Nobody cared for them

573
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,600
Nobody'd miss them

574
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,200
And then your... Goldie almost ruined everything

575
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,000
She stayed in public places. And then with you...

576
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,400
You were so convenient. You'd broken man's jaw that very night

577
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,800
Who would believe a thug like you?

578
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,500
Kevin killed her

579
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,200
I ordered the police in for you. But you wouldn't be caught

580
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,200
You wouldn't stop. And now he's dead and you're here too

581
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,700
Eliminate me

582
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,900
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

583
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,900
Killing a helpless, old fart

584
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
The killing, no. No satisfaction

585
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,900
Everything up until the killing... will be a gas

586
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:34,300
Kevin. We're going home

587
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,100
You could scream now if you want to

588
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,100
It's beautiful, Goldie. It's just like I promised, only better

589
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,700
And when his eyes go dead, the Hell I send him to must seem like Heaven after what I've done to him

590
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,300
Freeze! Oh my God

591
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,100
Jerks. They should've shot me in the head, and enough times to make sure

592
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,700
It's so stupid. Everybody knows what's coming

593
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,800
but they go through the motions anyway, what a waste of time

594
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,000
Month's fall off the calandar while I breath and eat through tubes

595
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,800
Night after night I wait for someone to come and finish me off

596
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,100
After awhile I realize it's not going to be so easy as that

597
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:39,200
I'm on my feet for about 10 minutes before the cops kick them out from under me

598
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,100
They don't ask me any questions

599
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,700
They just keep knocking the crap out of me and waving a confession in my face

600
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,000
and I keep spitting blood all over it and laughing at how many fresh copies they come up with

601
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:56,500
then along comes this worm assitant district attorney who turns the recorder off and says

602
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,600
if I don't sign their confession, they'll kill my mom

603
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,200
I break his arm in 3 places and I sign it

604
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,500
From then on, it's the circus everybody wants it to be

605
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,500
They nail me for the works. Not just the people I did kill

606
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,300
but even Lucille and the girls that Roark and Kevin ate

607
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,300
and even Goldie

608
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,800
the judge is all fire and brimstone when she hands down the sentence

609
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,000
midnight and my death are only a few hours away, when I get my first surprise in 18 months

610
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,100
My only visitor

611
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,300
I'm ready for anything but that scent

612
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,000
I got him for you good, didn't I, Goldie

613
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,800
I'm sorry, Wendy. I got confused again

614
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,100
seeing you like this

615
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,100
You can call me Goldie

616
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,200
She smells like angels ought to smell

617
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,700
The perfect woman. The goddess

618
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,500
Goldie. She says her name is Goldie

619
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,100
They fix fix me a pretty decent steak for my last meal

620
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,100
They even throw in a brew. It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's

621
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,900
Then they shave my head and fix me with a rubber diaper. And get to it

622
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,800
And it's about damn time, if you ask me

623
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,500
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

624
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,600
Would you get a move on, I haven't got all night

625
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,500
You heard the man. Hit it

626
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,300
That the best you can do, you pansies?

627
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,000
He's done

628
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,200
THE BIG FAT KILL

629
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:33,900
Forget it, man. You can bang on that door all night if you want to. There is no way in Hell I'm letting you in

630
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,800
I can't believe you're doing this to me, Shellie

631
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:42,000
Everything we've shared. It has to mean something to you

632
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,900
It meant plenty. Plenty of lost pay on account on how nobody wants to

633
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,300
flirt with a waitress whose face is all purple and swollen up with bruises

634
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,800
I know you're angry, baby. And I forgive you for that without you even asking me to

635
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,400
There's a difference between getting honked off at a guy who's generally not so bad

636
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,700
and... finding out that you've been sweet talked by a total jerk loser

637
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,500
who skips out on a wife he doesn't even tell you about every time

638
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
he gets drunk, which is way too often

639
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,900
especially... the kind of total jerk loser who has to beat up on a girl to make himself feel like a man

640
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,900
That hurts, Shellie. It's one thing for you to play hard to get

641
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,300
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off

642
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,100
I... am impossible to get. Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy, and get help

643
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:32,700
like... a shrink. Get help and... get lost

644
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
Just open the door

645
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,400
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie. I'll take care of this

646
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,200
Just open the door. You'll see how wrong you've been about me

647
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,000
Oblige him, Shellie. I'm ready for him

648
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,200
No. If he knew that you were here with me, you don't know how bad this can get

649
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,200
This clown's got a big mean drunk on

650
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:59,100
And he's got 4 friends out there in the hall, breathing had and just as drunk as he is

651
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,700
I could swear I heard somebody in there with you just now

652
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:09,700
Somebody?! Jackie Boy, it's a regular African lovefest in here

653
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,500
- Let me know who races (???)
- I mean, I got me, I got me all 5 starters...

654
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,400
and half the bench of the Basin City Blues keeping me company

655
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,400
You feel like taking them on?

656
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,000
You are teasing me, baby. Some of my best friends...

657
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,800
but you are really pushing my buttons

658
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,100
and the whole time you've been doing me like this

659
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,900
I've been too polite to point out that at any time I want to

660
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,500
I could kick this damn door to splinters

661
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,100
OK, baby. You know what I can do. You know what I can do

662
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,800
- Alright, Jack
- 1...

663
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,900
- Alright
- 2...

664
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,700
Alright, alright

665
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,900
Troops, make yourself at home

666
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,900
You brought your whole pack with you?

667
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,200
None of these bozos got lives, they got to hang out with you

668
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,400
You're going to love this baby. You're going to call up some of your friends

669
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,300
who work in the salloon. With you and the bunch of us, we're going to

670
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,100
hit every joint in town. It's just going to be great

671
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,500
I ain't calling up nobody

672
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,800
That's a man's shirt, and I sure as Hell it ain't one of mine

673
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,100
You got somebody's slow stink all over you

674
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,500
You've been with another man. You've been with him tonight

675
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,300
He's Superman. He flew out the window just as soon as he heard you were coming

676
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,300
because you scared him so bad

677
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,900
You think I have no feelings at all

678
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,100
If you're going to slug me, just go ahead and get it over with, you sick bastard

679
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:58,100
There you go, lying about me again, right in front of my friends

680
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,600
I have never hit a woman in my life

681
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:14,000
You goddamn bastard. You goddamn coward

682
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,900
Baby, we're all here to have a good time

683
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,000
Got to take a leak

684
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:29,100
Wish you dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy. Then you could've met my boyfriend. Could've seen what a real man looks like

685
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,100
There you go. After my nuts again

686
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,500
But I forgive you. I'm a generous guy

687
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:44,000
He is generous. With temper of his, you never should've picked on him like you did

688
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,600
You don't have to. You don't have to worry about it

689
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,900
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself or I'll cut your little pecker off

690
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,800
I've been told

691
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,100
Hey, baby. I don't hear you making those calls

692
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,700
Answer me

693
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,500
Oh, I don't need this grief

694
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,500
Hi, I'm Shellie's new boyfriend and I'm out of my mind

695
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:20,000
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again, you even think her name, and I'll cut you in ways that'll make you useless to a woman

696
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,700
You're making a big mistake, man. A big mistake

697
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,300
Yeah? You already made a big mistake, yourself

698
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,000
You didn't flush

699
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,000
Troops. Get out of here. No questions, damnit, no questions. Now!

700
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,500
Dwight, what in the Devil did you do to him?

701
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,100
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine

702
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,300
I don't think he'll be bothering you again. How's your jaw?

703
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,600
I've been slapped around worse

704
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,700
Dwight? He was from awhile back

705
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,300
before you showed up again with that new face of yours

706
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,000
and... it was only because I felt sorry for him. It was only once

707
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,000
I've done some dumb things

708
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,500
Seeing as how I'm one of those dumb things, I can't give you too hard a time about that, Shellie

709
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:24,200
But this guy. He's a menace. He might kill somebody if I don't stop him

710
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,600
I'll call you later

711
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,400
No, don't go!

712
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,900
Shellie shouts something I can't quite make out over the racket of a passing police copter

713
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,000
It sounds like "Stop". But I can't be sure

714
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:44,900
It's a chance I shouldn't be taking. But I can't just go home and forget about it and let Jackie Boy and his pals have their fun

715
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,100
They're a pack of predators, and they're out for blood tonight

716
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,000
A woman's blood

717
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:59,100
Damnit, Dwight, damnit. You fool. You damn fool

718
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,000
I cut Caddy across the car to pick up Jackie Boy heading like a bat out of hell up the hill

719
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,600
I'm speeding

720
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,600
That's a good way to get yourself noticed

721
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:15,100
and if you're a murderer with a new face whose 1 fingerprint check away to the fast track to the gas chamber, like I am...

722
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,800
the last thing you want is to get noticed

723
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,900
I don't have nearly enough cash on me to bribe this cop

724
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,200
and even if I did, there's always the outside chance he's 1 of the honest ones

725
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,100
Do I try to talk my way out of this?

726
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,100
Or do I take this cop down and risk it all?

727
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,600
Then Jackie Boy saves me a great big streaming pile of trouble

728
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
Watch it Jack!

729
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,900
Cops. They're right on our ass

730
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,200
Not for long

731
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,000
Not where we're headed

732
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,100
My gut tightens up

733
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,800
Jackie Boy's leading us straight to Old Town

734
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,800
The cop shuts off his siren

735
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,500
He knows he's not the law. Not in Old Town

736
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
The ladies are the law here

737
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,500
Beautiful and merciless

738
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,900
If you got the cash and play by the rules, they'll make all your dreams come true

739
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,500
But if you cross them, you're a corpse

740
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,100
Hop in, sugar. We'll get you there

741
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:39,800
Aww, sweetheart. I work the dayshift, and it's been a long day. Besides, I don't do group jobs

742
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,700
Get in the car, baby. We'll just talk. It'll be nice

743
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,800
I don't do talk jobs, either

744
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,500
Baby doll, I've had me 1 hell of a bad day

745
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I've been beat up every time I turn around

746
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,900
But then day when I get turned down by a hooker

747
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,400
When I got good hard earned cash to pay with

748
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:05,000
Well? There's only so much a man can take

749
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,600
Go try the Alamo over on Dillan Street. That's the Alamo, not the Amigo

750
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,300
The Amigo's a fag joint

751
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,500
Are you having a good time? Humiliating me like this for no damn reason at all?

752
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,800
That's far enough, Dwight

753
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,700
We've been on top of these peckerwoods since they first showed up with that cop behind them

754
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,300
Everything's under control. Enjoy the show

755
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,500
There's no use arguing with her

756
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,500
The ladies are their own enforcers

757
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,200
So how's the barmaid? You know, the one that never shuts up

758
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,500
Not right now, Gail

759
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,700
Oooh, wound up a little tight, aren't we?

760
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,400
That's your whole problem, Dwight

761
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,200
You worry too much

762
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,600
That and your lousy taste in women

763
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,700
These days, anyway

764
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,200
Damnit, Gail. Not right now

765
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,700
Those clowns, down the way. They some of the barmaids' boyfriends?

766
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,000
1 of them thinks he is. He's out of control

767
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,400
I followed them here to make sure he didn't hurt any of the girls

768
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,100
Us helpless, little girls

769
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,900
All kinds of death is about to hit less than 20 yards ahead of us

770
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,500
And still it's hard to take my eyes off her

771
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,700
Us girls are as safe as can be, Lancelot

772
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,600
Those boys in that Chrystler are 1 mistake away

773
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,400
from seeing what Miho can do

774
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,000
And she's been aching for some practice

775
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:34,000
She guards my glance upward to the pixie perched on the roofs edge

776
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,300
Deadly Little Miho

777
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,900
You're running out of valley, cowboy

778
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,900
Turn around. Safe yourself and your buddies a ton of grief

779
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,600
You're a sassy little thing

780
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,200
You ain't hardly in any kind of position to be making threats

781
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,200
The trap is set. Locked and ready to spring

782
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,900
So what? They're scum. They deserve what's coming

783
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,500
So why this rotten feeling in my gut that something is awfully wrong?

784
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,400
They haven't killed anybody I don't know about

785
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,600
They got pretty bad at Shellie's place

786
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,500
but they didn't kill anybody

787
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,300
And they won't

788
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,000
Why this rotten feeling?

789
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,600
Something Shellie said

790
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,100
I can't place it

791
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,700
OK, OK, OK, I sounded off a little more than I should've

792
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,600
I'm a little edge

793
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,800
Over the edge

794
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,000
It's not a woman you need, it's a good night sleep

795
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,800
You couldn't handle a woman in the state you're in

796
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,300
She saying you don't got what it takes, Jack

797
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,400
You want to see it?

798
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,100
You want to see what I got? Huh?

799
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,400
I've seen all shapes, all sizes

800
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,000
Have you seen this one?

801
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,100
Get in the car

802
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:56,100
Oh, sugar. You just gone and done the dumbest thing in your whole life

803
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,800
Oh, God, no

804
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,100
This is crazy

805
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,800
I don't know where... for no reason at all

806
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,100
Go ahead... go ahead

807
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,600
He's got the drop on her

808
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,700
He's got squat

809
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,700
He's dead, he's just too dumb to know it

810
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,900
I got you... right where I want you

811
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,200
This is a carreer ending wound for...

812
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
There's going to be hell to pay

813
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,100
Watch your step, Jackie Boy

814
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,500
Yeesh

815
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,400
This isn't funny

816
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,500
Don't anyone laugh. I got friends you can't imagine

817
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,600
Everyone in here is going to (???)

818
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,400
Hang it up, she's just playing with you

819
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,000
You're only making it worse

820
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,400
You shut the hell up

821
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,300
Don't pull the trigger, she blocked the barrell. It'll backfire

822
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,200
I told you to shut up

823
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,600
Can't see

824
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,300
I can't see

825
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,000
I can't hear anything

826
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,500
For God sake, Miho, finish him

827
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,200
Yeah

828
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,200
Make it quick, will you

829
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,100
She doesn't quite chop his head off

830
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,100
She makes a Pez Dispenser out of him

831
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,500
Then it's straight to business

832
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,400
stretching the corpses on the alley floor and checking their pockets

833
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,300
digging up cash when they find it

834
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,800
I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants. His wallet is packed

835
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,400
Master Card, Discover, Platinum American Express

836
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,300
And nearly 300 bucks worth of 20s that I'm not too proud to stuff into my own pockets

837
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,600
Then I find an atom bomb

838
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:31,300
Jackie Boy. You son of a bitch

839
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,300
There was a helicopter that kicked up such a racket I couldn't quite make out what she said

840
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,400
I thought Shellie said "Stop"

841
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,600
She said "Cop"

842
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,200
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty

843
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,000
"Iron Jack", the papers call him

844
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,200
A goddamn hero cop

845
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,100
It's hell for years, the shaky truce

846
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,400
The cops get a slice of the profits and free entertainment when they throw a party

847
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,600
The girls get to administer their own brand of justice

848
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,000
They get to defend their own turf

849
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,600
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood and he's not shopping for what the girls are selling

850
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,000
They send him packing

851
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,500
But they send him back alive

852
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,500
That's the rules

853
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,800
That's the truce

854
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,200
The cops stay out

855
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,900
That keeps the girls free to keep the pimps and the mob out

856
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,300
Old Town will be left wide open

857
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,000
It'll be war

858
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,300
The streets will run red with blood

859
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,600
women's blood

860
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,600
The cops

861
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,200
The mob. Things are going to go back to the way they used to be

862
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,800
The hell they will

863
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,800
We got guns

864
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:53,200
We'll fight the cops and the and mob and anybody else who tries to move in on us

865
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,300
We'll go to war

866
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,700
Don't be stupid, Gail. You wouldn't stand a chance

867
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,900
Get me a car

868
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,600
Make sure it's a hard top with a decent engine

869
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,800
I'll hide the bodies

870
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,400
Did you forget that cop car that trailed them here?

871
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,500
The cops know Rafferty came here

872
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,400
They'll check the river, they'll check the sewer

873
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,800
They'll find him and come gunning for us

874
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:19,000
I'll hall the bodies to the pits. The cops won't check the pits. Get that gun out of my face or I'll smack you

875
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,900
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

876
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,300
-You got what you wanted out of us
-Shut up, Gail

877
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,100
You got what you wanted out of me

878
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:34,100
And you were gone, off playing with that barmaid. Gone until you brought this unholy mess on us

879
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,600
Miho moves to my back

880
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,400
1 word from Gail and she'll cut me in half

881
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,200
They'll be watching the roads

882
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,700
They'll catch you

883
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,600
It'll be the bad old days, all over again

884
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,900
The pimps, the beatings, the drugs, the raps

885
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,200
They won't be watching the roads, not yet, they won't. Get me a damn hard top

886
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,300
If I don't make it, you can have your war

887
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,400
Get that gun out of my face, now
