2
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,790
Good morning, boss.
Beautiful day.

3
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,259
Great, Leo. Just coffee.

4
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,393
And make it strong.

5
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,429
- I had a late night.
- Oh?

6
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,564
Yeah, the ladies couldn't
keep their hands off me.

7
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:16,135
You mean you couldn't
keep your hands off them.

8
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,103
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey, Tony.

9
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,972
- How are you?
- Good.

10
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,780
Turn that down, will you, Leo?

11
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,318
You see what's happening
in the news today

12
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,020
with this thing of ours?

13
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,722
You mean this thing of theirs.

14
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,257
Greed. Nothing but greed.

15
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,293
That's what they teach these days.
Greed.

16
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,861
They feed it to their young.

17
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,630
And you know their motto?

18
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,665
All for me, none for you.

19
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,303
What's wrong, Bill, tell me.

20
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:55,307
I don't want to disturb you,
but I have no other option.

21
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,176
So what's the problem.

22
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,077
Frankie Andreoli.

23
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,680
My son-in-law opened up an iron
works shop on Washington Street.

24
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,082
Frankie comes by and tells
him that since Bobby Stax

25
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,851
is away for two years now

26
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,486
that he's running
the neighborhood,

27
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,422
and Sean has to pay him every
week to keep the shop open.

28
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,991
We don't want any trouble. I
don't know what else to do.

29
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,560
Patience. Times are changing.

30
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:18,197
Good things are coming soon.
You'll see.

31
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,831
Thank you, Tony.

32
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,536
- So?
- So what?

33
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,905
Since my brother's gone and
I'm retired, what can I do?

34
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:32,044
Now, if someone took care of
the root of the problem...

35
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,579
Another one, Leo.

36
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,921
What's going on, Leo?

37
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,123
Don't shoot the messenger.

38
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,025
Out with it.

39
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,062
- Bobby Stax is getting out.
- What?

40
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,997
That scumbag can't
be getting out.

41
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,432
I just got the word.

42
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,767
He's doing 8 years.
It's not possible.

43
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,037
I wanted to tell you
before somebody else did.

44
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,441
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

45
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,410
Okay.

46
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,729
Hey, Dopey, remember
what I said:

47
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,298
Get a real job.

48
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,744
Father in heaven,
we praise your name

49
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:50,148
for all who have finished their
life loving and trusting you,

50
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,616
for the example of their lives,

51
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,352
the life and the
grace you gave them,

52
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,253
and the peace in
which they rest,

53
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,090
we praise you today for
your servant Roberto

54
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,658
and for all that you
did through him.

55
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,527
May the peace of the Lord
be with you, brother,

56
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:07,065
and may the peace of the Lord be
with all gathered here today.

57
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,124
Are you staying?

58
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,960
His life was useless.

59
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,762
G, he was your father.

60
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:40,932
His life and the
life are useless.

61
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,168
Now is not the time.

62
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,104
It was never the time.

63
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,142
I'm leaving tonight.

64
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,045
I love you.

65
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,947
Me too, kid.

66
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,101
What's this all about?

67
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,805
Roberto Zarra. He was blown
up tonight outside his house.

68
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,107
Fuck Roberto Zarra.
He's nothing to me.

69
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,410
Do you deny that we found these
in the trunk of your car?

70
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,945
Where's my fuckin' lawyer?

71
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,713
You're gonna die, Bobby!

72
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,516
You're dead! You hear me?
You're dead!

73
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,968
There you go, girls.
There you go.

74
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,138
Here you are.

75
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,207
It's all right.

76
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,546
Rodney, take care
of them, you hear?

77
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,932
- Where the hell you been?
- Looking for a parking spot.

78
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,501
They called us already. Where
the hell have you been?

79
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,470
- Okay, so I think we gotta...
- Listen!

80
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,038
I'll tell you what to think.

81
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,241
I'm gonna lay it out for
you so you can do your job.

82
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,843
It's a bullshit DUI.

83
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,313
I had a few drinks and
got behind a wheel.

84
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,981
I mean, I live a
few blocks away.

85
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,118
Who the fuck can afford a
cab these days, you know?

86
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,253
Yeah, right. Yeah, of course.

87
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,789
On the way home,
some fucking boy

88
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,192
runs out in front of the car
in the middle of the road,

89
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,328
chasing after a fucking ball.

90
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,497
Ain't gonna be no pro athlete.

91
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,699
I would assume not. You
broke his arm and leg.

92
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,702
It was an honest
mistake, you know?

93
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,638
And I got my girl... Connie,
get your ass over here.

94
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,874
I'm comin', babe.

95
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:39,411
She'll testify that I was
with her, right, babe?

96
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,313
Of course, babe.

97
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,716
Holy shit.

98
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,956
Wait, you got what I said?

99
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,459
Believe this shit?

100
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:58,496
We get it, the kid's
hurt, but not this bad.

101
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,165
Probably an insurance job.

102
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,835
Probably just dressed the kid up
and propped him up in a chair.

103
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,670
- I mean, a soccer ball?
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

104
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,206
Let's move this along now.

105
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,541
Sorry, Your Honor.

106
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:12,344
<i>State of New Jersey v.
Piscano.</i>

107
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:15,380
Are you prepared
to enter a plea?

108
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,817
Yes, Your Honor.

109
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,952
Hey, what the fuck you doing?

110
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,091
Your Honor, my client here
may very well look like

111
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,160
an exemplary citizen,

112
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,395
but, in fact, he's a drunk.

113
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,663
Womanizer.

114
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,632
He's an asshole, to
be honest with you.

115
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,233
So we plead no
contest, Your Honor.

116
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,571
All right. Sentencing
on the 28th.

117
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,906
You son of a bitch!
I'm come after you!

118
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:46,678
You ain't no fuckin' lawyer,
and I ain't paying you shit!

119
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,714
You keep your money,
you lose my number,

120
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,984
and you get yourself
a new lawyer.

121
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,456
- Have a good day.
- Yeah, take care.

122
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,794
Hey, G man! I got one for you.

123
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,403
- Vanessa Andreoli?
- Yeah, it isn't pretty.

124
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,871
Yeah, I can't imagine why not.

125
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,440
You should make this a priority.

126
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,409
You're the best.

127
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,595
Can I help you?

128
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,431
Yeah.

129
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,900
I'm looking for an
older gentleman,

130
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,235
helps the less fortunate and
thinks he's James Cagney.

131
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,337
You know anyone
around here like that?

132
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,707
Mr. Hero! You've been missed.

133
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,609
Oh, it's good to see you.
Where's the old man?

134
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,144
You know your uncle.

135
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,913
He's either on the boat
or up with those pigeons.

136
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,614
If you see him, you don't
say anything to him, okay?

137
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:57,949
I want it to be a surprise.

138
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,151
- My lips are sealed.
- Thanks, Leo.

139
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,975
There you go, guys.
There you are.

140
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,384
Well, look at you.

141
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,554
Two years and you finally
come to see your uncle.

142
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,556
I'm sorry. I...

143
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,992
Yeah, I know. Busy
becoming a lawyer.

144
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,627
No reason to forget family.

145
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,295
Maybe you're ashamed.

146
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,098
Never be ashamed of
where you come from.

147
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,268
Uncle Tony, it's not like that.
Never seems to be enough time.

148
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,438
Time? You make time.

149
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,774
Family. That's what counts.

150
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:59,344
Hell, you know that.
It's bred in you.

151
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:02,280
Prince Gaetano. Come here.

152
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,518
- I miss you, I miss you.
- I missed you too.

153
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,321
Say, remember your little blue
splash in your first race?

154
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:14,058
You stayed up all night waiting
for that bird to come home.

155
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,694
- What tears.
- How could I forget?

156
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:20,498
It took two days. What
a trouper he was.

157
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,701
400 miles that bird flies home.

158
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,603
It is amazing how they do that.

159
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,572
I missed you, G.

160
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,774
I missed you, Uncle Tony.

161
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,343
Let me get cleaned up.
You're staying for dinner.

162
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,945
Nonna would never forgive you.

163
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,147
- She cooking?
- She's cooking right now.

164
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,316
- Let me go surprise her.
- Go ahead.

165
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,419
- Nonna!
- Who's there?

166
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,957
Hey! Nonna!

167
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,493
Can I help you?

168
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,996
Nonna, it's me. It's Gaetano.

169
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,238
No. The only Gaetano I
know is a wonderful boy.

170
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,274
He loved his grandmother so much

171
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:08,112
that he would come to
visit her all the time.

172
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,448
Nonna, it's...

173
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,021
I got you going!

174
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,957
Why would you do that to me?
Come on!

175
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,360
- I come all the way back and...
- I miss you.

176
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,729
Oh, I missed you too. And you look great.
Look at you.

177
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,165
Oh! Tell me everything.

178
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,300
You have a new job, a new girl?

179
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:33,037
Yeah, I got a job,
working on the girl.

180
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,807
Nonna, it smells
incredible in here.

181
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:39,577
Recipes from Lydia's
cooking show.

182
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,546
I'm making, um...

183
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,182
chicken parmesan,

184
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,184
baked ziti,

185
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,620
uh, meatballs.

186
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,221
But, Nonna, who's
gonna eat all this?

187
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,391
Tony! He's got a big appetite.

188
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,426
Now you have some.

189
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,209
Ma, I'm here! I
told you before,

190
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,045
stop banging on the ceiling
with the broomstick!

191
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,614
Look at what you're doing!
You see the cracks, huh?

192
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,484
I'm hungry! I wanna eat!

193
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,120
What happened to your casserole?

194
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:28,092
The oven. It
burned my eggplant.

195
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,229
It's a lousy oven.
It's too old.

196
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,431
I need a new oven, I
keep telling you.

197
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,134
I'll buy you a new stove.

198
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,405
So now you're gonna start
a law practice, huh?

199
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:44,342
Yeah, I hope so. I mean,
that's the endgame.

200
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,245
You don't hope. You
make things happen.

201
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,880
Yeah.

202
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,715
I gotta get going soon.

203
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,550
Why don't you stay over?

204
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,252
- Stay over?
- Yeah, why not?

205
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,587
Uncle Tony, I live
in Hackensack.

206
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,889
It's not that far.

207
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,458
And it takes you two
years to go 18 miles.

208
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,829
You miss me, huh?

209
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,332
There's something I wanna talk
to you about before I go though.

210
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:11,302
The zabaione will be
ready in five minutes.

211
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,471
Enough grappa, Ma.

212
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,043
I'm thinking about taking
a battered woman's case.

213
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,778
I might need a little
help with the evidence.

214
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,413
Maybe I can help.

215
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,984
Vanessa Andreoli. Married
to Frankie Andreoli?

216
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,518
You remember our
boy Frankie, huh?

217
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,022
Yeah. He's still the same
punk he was back then,

218
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,424
shaking down shops, restaurants.

219
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,494
Lately he's been
hanging out at Roma.

220
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,163
Eats there with his crew.
Never pays.

221
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,799
Are you planning to
take care of that?

222
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,235
I told you, Ma, I'm retired.

223
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:48,840
If Roberto was still here,
he would take care of it.

224
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,441
Nonna...

225
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,778
If there's one thing
that he didn't like,

226
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,180
it's disrespectful punks.

227
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,826
They killed your brother.

228
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,261
Your father.

229
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,130
My son.

230
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:16,434
And nobody did anything about it.
Anything!

231
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:22,340
And now those people that killed
Roberto are walking around free!

232
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,775
Ma...

233
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,777
Oh!

234
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,945
My zabaione!

235
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,615
You made me burn the dessert!

236
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,835
What's with the Lucky Strikes?
I thought you quit.

237
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,203
I did, two years ago.

238
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,205
Keep those right
there in the desk.

239
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,940
Buy a new pack once in a while.

240
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,341
Used to be when I tried to quit,

241
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,010
I wouldn't have any
cigarettes in the house.

242
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,712
When I get a craving,
I'd run to the store

243
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,514
and light up on the way home.

244
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,550
But if they're sitting
right there on the desk,

245
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,753
I know I can have one
if I wanna, so I don't.

246
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,359
What's that?

247
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,361
Your father's favorite piece.

248
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,430
I keep it locked in the drawer

249
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,500
to remind me that my
brother was no saint.

250
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,974
That's a funny thing
there, Uncle Tony.

251
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,242
What's that?

252
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,314
You, me, and my father,

253
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:39,317
we all carried guns, but
for different reasons.

254
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,621
A gun's just some
piece of metal.

255
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,859
It's the person who's holding
it who makes it dangerous.

256
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,131
Hey, so what was Nonna
talking about downstairs?

257
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,632
Who's walking around free?

258
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,101
Didn't wanna tell you.

259
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:01,939
Bobby Stax is getting
out on appeal.

260
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:05,910
After two years? What grounds?

261
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,813
Don't know, but I'm
gonna find out.

262
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,683
I'm going to Roma's.
You coming?

263
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,352
Yeah.

264
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,000
Now he's bringing half
his family to eat free,

265
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,268
that son of a bitch.

266
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,571
Mr. Z! How about a nice booth?

267
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:34,872
Gaetano!

268
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,941
- Nino, how you doing?
- I'm fine.

269
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,576
It's you we're all
worried about.

270
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,179
Come on in, gentlemen. Make
yourselves comfortable.

271
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,881
Gaetano! Our hero!

272
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,317
How you doing, Frankie boy?

273
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,853
Me? I'm doing good.

274
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,657
You see, things have
changed around here a bit,

275
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,859
and I'm on the right
side of things now.

276
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:55,927
Oh, yeah?

277
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:56,929
Yeah, you see them?

278
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,262
They're with me now.

279
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:02,066
And you see this? All mine.

280
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,301
And you see this?

281
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,536
I use it to instruct people

282
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,538
that it ain't
"Frankie boy" no more.

283
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,408
It's "Mr. Andreoli,"
even to you,

284
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,011
so you better know
your place around here.

285
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,646
I know my place
around here, Frankie.

286
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,782
I think it's you who's a
little mixed up though.

287
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:21,619
See, I'll beat the shit out of
you in front of those guys,

288
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,422
then I'll take this...

289
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,958
and I'll blow your fucking
brains out with it,

290
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,526
and then I'll take that money.

291
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,328
I'll take anything I
want from you, Frankie,

292
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,563
just like when we were younger.

293
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,367
Don't you ever fucking
forget it, Frankie boy.

294
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,169
Go ahead and shoot.

295
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,238
No, no, no, please, not here.

296
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,573
Relax, Nino. We're
just playing around.

297
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,575
Right?

298
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,775
Old times.

299
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,411
Say, let me buy you
two heroes a drink.

300
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,348
To safe passage home,

301
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,984
from wherever it may be
that you are coming from.

302
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:02,526
Frankie, I heard you
and Vanessa broke up.

303
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,396
That's none of your
fucking business.

304
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,765
How you treat your wife,

305
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,467
yeah, you're right, that
is none of my business.

306
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,035
- Enough, G.
- No, I gotta let him know...

307
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,271
- I said enough!
- Listen to your uncle.

308
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,106
And you should lighten
up, Frankie boy.

309
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,108
I heard your boss
is getting out,

310
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,877
and you'll be back
to running errands.

311
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,848
Ronnie, let's go.

312
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,854
That motherfucker.

313
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,822
We're not gonna let him
get away with that.

314
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,257
In time.

315
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,026
In time he's gonna end
up like his father.

316
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:36,560
That bastard.

317
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,197
You want to stay?
Have a good time.

318
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,999
But if Frankie comes back...

319
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,834
Hey, no, I'll be nice.

320
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,536
Come here.

321
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:47,972
Good to see you.

322
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,389
Why don't you let me pour
you something stronger?

323
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,492
Hey, Mr. Friendly.

324
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,664
Sorry, no, I was just...
I was... unwinding.

325
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,499
I've been away for
a little while.

326
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,235
Yeah, a lot of people around
here been away for a while.

327
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,937
What'd you do?

328
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,106
Join the Army.

329
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,274
Really?

330
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,343
I joined the Army.

331
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,916
I'm sorry. I just thought...

332
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:33,184
No, no, no, it's okay.

333
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:36,420
Yeah, I know you thought.

334
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,422
Don't worry about it.

335
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,925
Gaetano. You can call me G.

336
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,526
Christine.

337
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,162
You can call me
Crissy or Crystal.

338
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,497
Take your pick.

339
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,034
Tough decision.

340
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,235
Yeah.

341
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:52,970
I'll let you know tomorrow.

342
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,238
Tomorrow?

343
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,107
Yeah, tomorrow.

344
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,175
What'd you have in mind?

345
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,544
I'll keep those to
myself right now.

346
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,482
So what brought you to New York
and Roma's, of all places?

347
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,185
Bright lights, big city.

348
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,587
Wanna come out and
do some theater,

349
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,623
maybe get on Broadway.

350
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,491
And then I realized about
a million other girls

351
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,627
had the exact same idea.

352
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:53,864
But I know that Roma's is about
one step above purgatory,

353
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,533
but it pays the bills,

354
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:57,401
especially when you got big
shots like Frankie coming in

355
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,203
and tipping well.

356
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:03,574
Frankie's a lot of things, but
big shot's not one of them.

357
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:06,210
Not as big as he makes himself
out to be anyway. Trust me.

358
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:24,328
Oh, guys, look who's in town.

359
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,831
Sure, retirement's
getting too much for you.

360
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,998
Can you use a caper?

361
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,967
Matter of fact, I wouldn't
mind a part-time job.

362
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:34,038
You know, Officer Jimmy here is
working on a real crime stopper.

363
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,941
- I bet he could use your help.
- Yeah? What is it, James?

364
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:39,310
Oh, Nathan's is
missing some hot dogs.

365
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,945
Case of the century.

366
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:43,914
- Still a pain in the ass, huh?
- Yes, he is.

367
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,115
Up in the office?

368
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,184
He's waiting on you.

369
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,592
- Chief.
- Tony, how's Ma?

370
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:56,193
Thanks for asking.
Ma's great...

371
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,562
when she's not drinking grappa.

372
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:00,698
She is a great lady.

373
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,534
Jim, I need your
help with something.

374
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,269
- With what?
- Bobby.

375
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,639
We're not talking about Bobby
Stax now again, are we?

376
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,608
I have to find a way to get
this guy off the street.

377
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,510
You really don't know, do you?

378
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,779
Know what? What don't I know?

379
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:19,116
The FBI's been through those
files with a fine-tooth comb,

380
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,384
and the case is closed.

381
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:24,188
Why would the FBI be involved?

382
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,960
So what do you think?

383
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,897
Some guys are lucky
or maybe not?

384
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,965
Doing eight, getting out in two?

385
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,234
Keep an eye on this guy.

386
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,571
Bobby!

387
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,441
Look at you in a suit.

388
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,477
Come on, let's go,
open the door.

389
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,746
I wanna get cleaned
up before this party.

390
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,266
Oh! Nino, how you doing?
Look who's here!

391
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,435
Bobby Stax is back!
That's right!

392
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,771
Yeah, shut the fuck up.
How you doing?

393
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,407
All right, all right,
my boys, all right.

394
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,509
And from the looks of
things around here,

395
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:20,811
it's none too soon, all right?

396
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,414
'Cause things were a fucking
mess, but as of now,

397
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,615
we are back in business.

398
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,550
What business is that, Mr.
Stax?

399
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,519
What the fuck are
you doing here?

400
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:31,288
It's a restaurant. I must
be here to eat something.

401
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,923
Well, the place is closed.

402
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,092
This is a private party, so why
don't you just get the fuck out?

403
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,461
Yeah, you're having a
private party, all right.

404
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,631
But see, the problem is
the terms of your parole

405
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,901
state that you can't
associate with known felons.

406
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,437
Wait a minute. Are you
insulting my cousins?

407
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,871
Is that nice?

408
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,541
Come on, just take a
fucking walk, will you?

409
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:53,510
You and me, we're gonna go.

410
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:57,481
Not today, but we're gonna go.

411
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:58,983
But today?

412
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:01,852
Today is a party. Today
we're celebrating!

413
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,120
Yeah!

414
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,688
Come on, why don't you
come join us, huh?

415
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,590
Come eat, have
something to drink.

416
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,559
Sit with the boys. We'd love
to have him, wouldn't we?

417
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:10,327
Come on, Mr. Zarra, come on.

418
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,129
Go fuck yourself.

419
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,731
You think?

420
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,166
That's too bad, huh, boys?

421
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,335
Everybody say goodbye.
Say goodbye to Mr. Zarra.

422
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,670
Bye, Mr. Zarra!

423
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,039
You take care now, Tone.
We'll see ya!

424
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,708
We'll see you around the
campus, you fucking prick!

425
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,910
That's right! Don't
worry about it.

426
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,612
He'll get his. He'll get his.

427
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,915
He ain't a cop no more.
That's right.

428
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,427
Mr. Zarra.

429
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:44,461
The bulls.

430
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:45,629
No, sir. FBI.

431
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,897
I would've never known.

432
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,467
Special Agent Clarke,
Agent Kinsey.

433
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,169
Let's cut to the chase.

434
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,571
Okay, Tony. Bobby Stax.

435
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,541
You should keep those
scumbags in jail.

436
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,009
We'd like to ask you
not to do anything

437
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,778
that would hinder
our investigation.

438
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,548
Hinder a federal investigation?
I wouldn't think of it.

439
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,283
I'm sure you're aware
that we're in the midst

440
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,818
of an organized crime roundup.

441
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,621
Any move on your part
regarding Bobby Stax

442
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,589
could jeopardize years
of surveillance.

443
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:15,659
So you want me to stay
away from Bobby Stax.

444
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,262
And what are you
gonna do for me?

445
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:20,330
What'd you have in mind?

446
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:23,233
If I leave Bobby Stax alone,

447
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:27,071
you might find something in the
files about my brother's murder.

448
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,739
Anything's possible.

449
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,408
Oh, one more thing.

450
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,777
For personal reasons,

451
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,580
maybe you could find
some hard evidence

452
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:41,285
on that scumbag Frankie
Andreoli for me.

453
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,388
You never know.

454
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,215
You're a lot like
your Uncle Tony.

455
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,883
Yeah, really? How so?

456
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:15,519
Well, you're both
strong male figures,

457
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,454
both feel the need to
protect other people,

458
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,656
and you feel
responsible for them,

459
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,725
strong sense of family.

460
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,127
I think the older you get,

461
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,062
the more like him
you're gonna be.

462
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:28,465
That's scary.

463
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:32,069
What, is this a new talent
of yours I don't know about?

464
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:34,004
Start calling you Madam
Zorra, psychic, or what?

465
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,240
No, it just seems like you're
always trying to save everybody.

466
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:39,877
I'm not trying to save everybody.
I'm just...

467
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:42,112
No, I'm trying to...

468
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,914
What about you?

469
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,783
Why are we talking so
much about me, all right?

470
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:48,218
What kind of secrets you got?

471
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,290
Oh, everybody's got secrets.

472
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,560
Leave the questions in
the courtroom, Mr. Zarra.

473
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,829
You come here.

474
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,493
We're gonna get the order
of protection today.

475
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,462
Oh, the order of protection.
Well, then I'll be fine.

476
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,264
- Okay, let's go.
- He said he would kill me.

477
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,433
- Let's go.
- That's what he said.

478
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:39,503
Frankie says he's gonna do
something, he's gonna do it.

479
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,745
<i>Andreoli vs. Andreoli.</i>

480
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,347
Good morning, Ms. Mahn.

481
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,381
Your Honor.

482
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,916
Thank you.

483
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,919
Miss Andreoli, where's
your better half today?

484
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:59,623
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but that is not funny,

485
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,226
considering the numerous times
that we've had to come here.

486
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,061
Of course it's not funny.
What is ridiculous

487
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:07,664
is how many times you have been
in this court with Ms. Andreoli.

488
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,666
Your Honor, my
client has suffered

489
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,602
physical and
psychological abuse.

490
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,036
Something has to be done.

491
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,705
Your Honor, my client
loves his family.

492
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:15,707
He'd never hurt a fly.

493
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,108
Are you kidding?

494
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,679
Ms. Mahn, I've told
you many times.

495
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,548
You need to provide
further proof

496
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,452
that Mr. Andreoli is, in fact,
violating your client's rights.

497
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:32,623
In that case, I will
rule appropriately.

498
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,964
- Ronnie?
- Yeah.

499
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:43,767
Remember when I told you
about lowlife scum?

500
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:44,835
Yeah.

501
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,403
Well, there's one here now.

502
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,205
Sonny!

503
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,741
- What's up?
- You missed four payments.

504
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:54,111
I'm gonna be nice and maybe
forgive the vig if you pay now.

505
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:57,114
Bobby doesn't recognize
you as his rep anymore.

506
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,083
What can I say? I'm paying him.

507
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,819
Now youse two guys can
leave and go work it out

508
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,122
and leave me out of it.

509
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,492
Fuck you!

510
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,495
Get the fucking money!

511
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,530
Fucking deadbeat.

512
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,166
You still owe me!

513
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:56,907
He's down there.

514
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:58,709
- Ah, thanks.
- Yeah.

515
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,584
Paul.

516
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,687
Anthony!

517
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,223
To what do we owe the pleasure?

518
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:16,126
- Hey.
- Just passing by.

519
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:20,130
Hey, boys! Say hello to Mr. Z.

520
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,099
- Hi, Mr. Z!
- Hi!

521
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:24,401
You here on police matters?

522
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,469
Come on, Paul.

523
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,738
I think maybe I'm
taking a pinch.

524
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,139
No, I'm not.

525
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,274
Having a little excitement
like the old days?

526
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,743
Nice kids.

527
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:34,611
They're beautiful kids.

528
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:35,879
Sit down, will you, please?

529
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:39,783
The future gangsters of America.

530
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,651
Not on my life.

531
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,522
Doctors, lawyers, Peace Corps.

532
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,657
Anything but the life.

533
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,493
Come on, let's eat.

534
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,561
Oh, no, Paul, don't go
through the trouble.

535
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,063
What trouble?

536
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:56,666
You come to visit the house,
you break bread, we eat.

537
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:57,901
You're family.

538
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,771
Your brother, your father,

539
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:03,440
even the black sheep, you.

540
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:06,710
You'll always be part
of the family to me.

541
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,045
Of course. Thank you, Paul.

542
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,746
Thank you, Marie.

543
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,783
Thanks, honey.

544
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,729
Salut.

545
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:26,797
Salut.

546
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,170
I've had something rattling
in my head for years now,

547
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,971
can't see to come to terms with.

548
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:36,573
Maybe you can help.

549
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,676
I'll try, but things
aren't the same, you know.

550
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,278
Bobby Stax.

551
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,881
Bobby Stax is nothing.

552
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,149
Roberto said that...

553
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,218
Oh, that's what you want.

554
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,453
Your brother Roberto.

555
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:52,656
You still got that in your mind.

556
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,624
Please, take it from me.

557
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,726
He was like a son to me.

558
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,496
Him and Paulie Jr. crewed
together for years.

559
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:04,167
Whatever happened,
it was his choice.

560
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:05,535
To be in the family.

561
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,938
It wasn't his choice.

562
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,574
He grew up idolizing our father.

563
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,642
Bobby Stax, I have
this feeling...

564
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:15,712
Come on, please, you're
gonna ruin your mind.

565
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,380
Take it from me.

566
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:21,685
I keep beating myself up
since I lost Paulie Jr.

567
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,821
It has been too long, Paul.

568
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:29,359
From the black
sheep, I love you.

569
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,895
I love you.

570
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:33,630
Black sheep nothing.

571
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,400
You know, you were
always the smart one.

572
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,936
Your father always said that.

573
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,873
We were all very proud of you.

574
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,842
Please eat.

575
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,494
Hey!

576
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,496
Hey, G!

577
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,399
- Look who it is, huh?
- What's going on?

578
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,002
Not too much. Just popping
by to see a friend.

579
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,004
What have you been up to?

580
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,939
I'm a doctor these days.

581
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:19,376
You know, G, four times this
month I'm here changing tires.

582
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:23,446
Steady work for me, right?
Poor girl.

583
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,782
Yeah, I haven't seen
her in a while, so...

584
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,919
Hey, she's having a hard
time of it, all right?

585
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:31,321
We both know how
Frankie can be, right?

586
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:33,857
Yup. Hey, we're gonna
catch up later, all right?

587
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,659
- Yeah!
- All right, good.

588
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,130
Mom, you gotta promise me
that if something happens,

589
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:42,265
you're gonna take John.

590
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,000
- Would you...
- Mom, just promise me.

591
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:46,336
I don't wanna hear this crazy
talk anymore, do you hear me?

592
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:50,674
Stop with the tears now.
No more tears. Stop.

593
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:53,443
Gotta listen to your
mother, Vanessa.

594
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,711
Oh, God.

595
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,281
Sorry. Old habits, you know?
I just let myself in.

596
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:01,017
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, how are you?

597
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,587
Gaetano, come here,
give me a hug.

598
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,388
It's so good to
have you back safe.

599
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,526
Yeah, thank God for that,
you know what I mean?

600
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,461
How's Nonna?

601
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:14,798
She's great, you know? I
mean, she's crazy, but great.

602
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,766
- Still crazy?
- Yeah.

603
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,935
So what have you been
doing with yourself?

604
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,304
Funny you asked.
You got some time?

605
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:25,442
Oh, yeah. Just let me clean up.

606
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,977
All right.

607
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,015
I don't know what to do anymore.

608
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:35,418
I mean, my lawyer Claire,
she's doing the best she can,

609
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,153
but she doesn't really
wanna deal with this.

610
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,055
And you know, we're friends.

611
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:42,292
That's why she's helping me out,
but she's a corporate lawyer.

612
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:45,762
She makes a lot of money, and
I can't pay that much and...

613
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,298
So let me take the case.

614
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,333
- You?
- Yeah.

615
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,035
If you want me to, I'll take it.

616
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,437
- You.
- Yeah, me.

617
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,040
What, you don't
think I can do it?

618
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,175
What, you're like serious?

619
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:02,379
Yeah. Like serious.

620
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,415
Oh, my God, yeah.

621
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:07,417
I'm sure Claire would be
thrilled to be off of it.

622
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,386
- Good. Done.
- I can't pay a lot.

623
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,554
Don't worry about the money. I
don't care about the money.

624
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,958
- Do not even ask about...

625
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,794
Oh, I gotta get back for my son.
He was at a birthday party.

626
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,030
All right, yeah, I'll
just grab the check.

627
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,301
G, I don't know how to
thank you right now.

628
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,568
Well, say thank you.

629
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,003
Thank you.

630
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,872
Oh, well, there you go.

631
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,648
So we're clear on the fee?

632
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,383
Look, Vanessa... G, please, okay?

633
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,752
I can handle that much.

634
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,754
We're clear on the fee.

635
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:49,559
There's somebody I want you to meet.
John, come here.

636
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,362
Can you say hello to Mr. Zarra?

637
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,297
Hello, Mr. Zarra.

638
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,299
Hello, John.

639
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,634
Wanna shoot hoops?

640
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:59,569
Oh, no, no, not today,
but maybe another time.

641
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,906
Uh, yeah, I'll stick around,
shoot some hoops. Sure.

642
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,641
Yes!

643
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,178
- You just made his day.
- He got big.

644
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,213
Gotta be here all
day with him now.

645
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,848
Hours and hours.

646
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,463
Hey! What the fuck
happened with Sonny?

647
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:28,064
Nothing fucking happened.

648
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,567
He's got a mouth on him, so
I taught him some manners.

649
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,534
Manners?

650
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,170
I'll teach you fucking manners!

651
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:38,308
He's a fucking scumbag who
decided he wasn't gonna pay me,

652
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,509
so I took my money!

653
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:40,877
Go ahead, make a move, Ronnie.

654
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,446
Our bust this in your fucking skull!
Go ahead!

655
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:47,050
Sonny belongs to me, Frankie boy!
Me!

656
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,386
I own him. Not you, me!

657
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,221
This is my fucking territory!

658
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,655
Stay out of my business!

659
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,091
I'm fucking warning
you right now!

660
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,926
Stay out of it.

661
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:18,481
Hey, Tommy! Where
can I get a burger?

662
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,483
Hey, I hope you guys are hungry.

663
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:23,052
We got a ton of food back there.

664
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,889
I miss the action, Sal.

665
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:29,826
What action? The same
scumbags doing the same shit.

666
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:33,096
I'm telling you, Tony,
two months, I'm out.

667
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,064
Yeah? Then what
are you gonna do?

668
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,033
Gonna take it easy.

669
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:41,204
Well, let me tell you,
taking it easy ain't easy.

670
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,306
You did the right
thing getting out.

671
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:45,141
Barry, how about a sausage?

672
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,277
- Any onions?
- Nah.

673
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,578
Thanks.

674
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,552
So you put this Bobby
Stax matter behind you.

675
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:57,120
I know you, Tony.

676
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:00,657
He's out now, you're
itching to do something.

677
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:04,861
Sal, I know you're
coasting on the job now,

678
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,797
but I need something
from the inside.

679
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,633
- Like what?
- I need the files

680
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:13,136
from the investigation
of Roberto's death.

681
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:16,906
Files. Tony, you know there's
nothing I wouldn't do for you,

682
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:19,509
but even if I can get to
them, what would they say?

683
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,711
There must be something
there that we missed.

684
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,379
- Something, I don't know.
- I know what they say.

685
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,114
They say "case closed."

686
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,885
It's got to be this Bobby.

687
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:31,387
I had to have missed something,

688
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:34,057
or there must be
something covered up.

689
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:36,626
You can't prove it, Tone.

690
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,963
I'll see what I can do.

691
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,264
Love you, man.

692
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,899
Gotta go, Sal.

693
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:44,834
See you later.

694
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,025
I don't know, Uncle Tony. You
should've seen that kid.

695
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:52,228
I'm telling you, he was
like starved for attention.

696
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,632
You should've seen him when I
was getting ready to leave.

697
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,967
He was just begging me to stay.

698
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,638
A father like Frankie?
No wonder.

699
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,144
Stay away from that kid.
Do your job.

700
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,080
Help Vanessa and stay the hell
away from that kid, you hear me?

701
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:12,615
Yeah, yeah, I know.

702
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:15,551
And remember, like
I told you before,

703
00:44:15,553 --> 00:44:17,754
you're getting into
Frankie's business.

704
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,555
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

705
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:21,691
I can handle myself.

706
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:24,060
Famous last words.

707
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,432
Something else I wanted
to talk to you about.

708
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,768
Frankie and his crew, they're
having lunch at Roma's,

709
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,770
and Crystal overheard
Frankie talking about

710
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:36,039
what he called a "big job."

711
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,410
A day in the life of
Frankie Andreoli.

712
00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:43,513
Terrorize his wife and kid,

713
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:46,416
shake down a restaurant,

714
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:47,950
plan a fire.

715
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:49,986
Fire? How'd you
know it's a fire?

716
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:53,456
Insurance jobs.
Frankie's specialty.

717
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:56,693
I could never nail
that little bastard.

718
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,462
I'll let the guys at
the precinct know.

719
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:01,330
That's great.

720
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,103
Gonna heave one towards
the goal line...

721
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:11,307
He only needed 10 yards for the
field goal, and he goes deep?

722
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,211
Dad was a Jet fan.

723
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,612
There you go.

724
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,915
He liked the Jets.
I like the Giants.

725
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:21,050
Me, the Knicks. Your
father, the Nets.

726
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,852
That's how different we were.

727
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:26,756
Forget the law. Sports!

728
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:29,292
That's what made us argue.

729
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,361
Ah...

730
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:38,568
You know what, G? It's
nice to have you back.

731
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,804
It's good to be
back, Uncle Tony.

732
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:49,712
Tony, there's a man
downstairs asking for you!

733
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:52,381
- Who is it?
- FBI!

734
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,083
I can smell them anywhere!

735
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,853
Ma, send them up to the roof!

736
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,688
What's the FBI want?

737
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,890
We'll see.

738
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,194
You here to give me information
about my brother's murder?

739
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:06,796
What information?

740
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:08,731
I asked you to stay away
from this investigation.

741
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,700
Our reports are that you can't.

742
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,535
You gotta stop asking questions.

743
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:14,370
Let's stop this cat
and mouse game.

744
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:15,671
This isn't the game, Tony.

745
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:16,939
Just bear with us
for a few weeks.

746
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,143
I promise you'll be pleased.

747
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,378
Who has more patience than me?

748
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,785
By the way, your mother,
she's very nice.

749
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,453
You know, she offered me
cookies when I arrived.

750
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,588
How were they? Burnt?

751
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,291
A little, but they
were very good,

752
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,995
especially when you got
past the black part.

753
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:41,964
Surprised she didn't poison him.

754
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,837
Ma, what'd you do, feed
him some of your cookies?

755
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,540
Well, unlike you, he liked them.

756
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:52,809
He left that file for you.

757
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:55,077
Good night.

758
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,256
How'd you pull this off?

759
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,992
Thank you. I owe you.

760
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,795
- I gotta go though, all right?
- Good night.

761
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:14,096
Love you, Uncle Tony.

762
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,935
Please state your
name for the record.

763
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,871
Gaetano Zarra, Your Honor,

764
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:24,607
now the attorney of record
for Vanessa Andreoli.

765
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:26,809
And what do you plan
to do differently

766
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:28,177
than previous counsel?

767
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,379
I have evidence, including
video surveillance,

768
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:33,316
that Frank Andreoli has
violated my client's rights.

769
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:35,985
Well, that would be nice, since
I've yet to see anything

770
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:38,321
that would lead me to
rule on such a violation.

771
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:40,022
Your Honor, I object
to this nonsense.

772
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,991
His client has never submitted
one stitch of evidence.

773
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:43,726
May I approach the
bench, Your Honor?

774
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:45,361
Approach the bench.

775
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,512
All right, with regard to this,

776
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:07,917
there appears to be sufficient
evidence to enter an order.

777
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:10,519
Protection is in full force, Mr.
Rhodes.

778
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:12,555
I don't think I need to
remind you that your client

779
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,858
will face serious charges
if he violates this order.

780
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,994
Order granted.

781
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,569
Look, Frankie, I think we
should lay low a little while.

782
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,170
Shut up. I can't lay low now.

783
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:30,573
Well, hero boy G just
kicked our ass in there.

784
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,041
Punk motherfucker.

785
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:33,876
Well, look, he's looking
to put you back in jail

786
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:36,512
and is trying to get Vanessa
sole custody of your son.

787
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,414
He's dreaming.

788
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,416
Well, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

789
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,719
Court loves this guy.
War hero, Purple Heart.

790
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:46,022
Well, do your job
and shut him down.

791
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:47,957
Look, I'm the last guy to
get you going, Frankie,

792
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:49,558
but your wife doesn't
have any more money.

793
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,660
We made sure of that.

794
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:52,895
So how is she paying this guy?

795
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,697
You know what I mean?

796
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,453
- Fucking bitch!
- Frankie, no!

797
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,754
Huh?

798
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:20,856
What are you doing, huh?

799
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:22,725
Are you fucking...

800
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,460
Mommy, Daddy, stop!

801
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,594
Please stop!

802
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:28,764
Get off of me!

803
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,366
Daddy, please don't hurt Mommy!

804
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:33,135
Get over here! You know I'll
fucking kill you, bitch!

805
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:36,339
Look what you're doing
to your son, Frankie!

806
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:39,075
This is your fault.

807
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:42,311
You're nothing but
a fucking whore.

808
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,854
It's okay, baby.

809
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,459
Come here, let me look at you.

810
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,751
So what's this all about?

811
00:50:21,753 --> 00:50:24,053
I love these pancakes.

812
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:25,755
You sure I can get you
some pancakes, Paul?

813
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,223
Please. It's a treat.

814
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:36,866
So, while I was doing my bid,

815
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,868
this mutt grew a pair of balls.

816
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,169
He's somebody now.

817
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,041
He's disrespecting the
chain of command, Paul.

818
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:47,543
And frankly, he's
stepping all over my dick.

819
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,545
Fuck you. I don't
work for you no more.

820
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:54,150
Maybe not, but you stay the fuck
out of my way, understand me?

821
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:57,386
Just stay out of my way.

822
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,790
You guys talk a little
nicer, for Christ's sake.

823
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:03,492
The whole world is dissolving,

824
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:08,764
and you two can't even sought
out a 15-block neighborhood.

825
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,666
Both of you.

826
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,568
So, Frankie boy, Paul is
here to set you straight,

827
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,171
so pay attention, you
fucking jerk-off.

828
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,840
Fuck you, Bobby.
These are new times.

829
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:19,842
What I've got, I've earned,

830
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,844
and no one's gonna take
it away or deny it.

831
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:25,014
So go fuck yourself and
fuck your manners!

832
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:29,452
You see what I'm
dealing with, Paul?

833
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,654
You see what I'm dealing
with, this fucking guy?

834
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,556
Please sanction it.

835
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:36,859
Let me take care of
this guy, please.

836
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,262
Eat your pancake.

837
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,967
Okay.

838
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,235
Okay, Paul.

839
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,133
Everything we do in life...

840
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,869
Good, bad...

841
00:52:19,871 --> 00:52:22,738
Does it come back to bite us?

842
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,114
What I've got, I've earned.

843
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:35,618
This neighborhood is mine!
You're nothing!

844
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:55,838
I think she likes you.

845
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,473
My friend runs an
animal shelter,

846
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,709
and I saw this girl staring
up at me with big, sad eyes,

847
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:03,078
so I took her home.

848
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,681
- You bought a puppy?
- I didn't buy a puppy.

849
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,216
What are you gonna do with
it, with the hours you work?

850
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:08,984
Oh, no, no. I can't keep her.

851
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:10,052
Not just because of my hours.

852
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:11,420
My roommate's allergic to dogs.

853
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:13,522
So what are you
gonna do with her?

854
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,291
I figure maybe she
could stay with you.

855
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:17,193
Don't you want to stay with G?

856
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:19,061
No. No. Don't even...

857
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:21,063
She's lovely, she's cute.
Not a chance.

858
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:23,399
Fine. I'll take her
back to the shelter.

859
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:27,503
I'm sure someone will
take her home eventually.

860
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:28,771
When? When?

861
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:31,340
- I'll take her back tomorrow.
- All right.

862
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:33,175
Tonight I was gonna
take you to Amalfi's.

863
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:34,910
We can have a nice
romantic dinner, huh?

864
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:37,479
We can have a romantic
dinner at Amalfi's anytime.

865
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:40,349
Tonight I figure we get a
bottle of wine, some takeout,

866
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,351
and a few dog treats.

867
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,421
Just the three of us.
It'll be fun.

868
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:47,856
Threesome. All right.
Sounds good.

869
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:49,325
You convinced me. Good choice.

870
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,527
- That was easy.
- All right, get in the boat.

871
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,936
Oh, shit.

872
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,606
Try to keep your cool, man.

873
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:06,041
You really don't
belong here, ma'am.

874
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:08,777
I am here to protect
my daughter, Frankie.

875
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,546
Get a life.

876
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:14,149
Please! I am begging
you to end this now.

877
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:16,952
Ask your daughter what
she's been doing to me.

878
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:18,988
For your son's sake, Frank.

879
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,389
My son is fine.

880
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:24,560
Fine? This life that you
think is so glamorous?

881
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:27,062
Haven't you heard? This
life doesn't exist.

882
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:29,798
This life is filled
with garbage.

883
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,700
And you are garbage.

884
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:34,370
And if you were
any kind of a man,

885
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:36,438
you would do the right
thing by your son.

886
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,040
And what would that be?

887
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,875
Walk away, Frankie.

888
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:43,012
Oh, let me tell you something.

889
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:44,413
I back down to nobody.

890
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,949
No Zarra's gonna
tell me what to do.

891
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:50,219
This meeting here never happened.
We never spoke.

892
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:51,654
You heard what the judge said.

893
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:54,290
Now I think you better go home.

894
00:54:55,625 --> 00:55:01,430
You are pathetic, Frankie,
and I feel sorry for you.

895
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,220
You look like shit.

896
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:28,424
- Ma, please.
- Out all night?

897
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,363
Was Gaetano with you?

898
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:38,967
Come in the kitchen.
I'm making cannolis.

899
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,136
You want a cannoli?

900
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:43,605
Ma, we have to talk.

901
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:46,041
We have to talk
about the cooking.

902
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:49,778
It's starting to get
dangerous now, Ma.

903
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,080
What do you care?

904
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:52,648
You're gonna burn
the place down.

905
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:56,218
What do you care? All you
care about is the birds

906
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,921
and wasting time with whores.

907
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:00,456
Ma...

908
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:07,463
You know what the neighbors
say about you? Cornuto.

909
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:08,897
Ma!

910
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,433
Your brother had Gaetano.

911
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:13,102
What have you got? Nothing.

912
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:16,872
Nothing to show you were
here, to have left your mark.

913
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,041
The Zarra mark.

914
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,412
Ma, your cooking...

915
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:26,014
I don't care about the
building or the birds.

916
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:27,082
It's you.

917
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:29,218
Why do you think I'm here?

918
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,453
All right, your
brother had problems,

919
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:33,489
but he was about family.

920
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,924
You? I don't know with you.

921
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:37,326
I can't believe you!

922
00:56:37,328 --> 00:56:39,328
I could've been
married so many times.

923
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,929
Why do you think I didn't?

924
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:44,299
Why do you think I'm here
living in this apartment?

925
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:47,503
For you! For you!

926
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,473
I'm just tired.

927
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,289
I'm sorry.

928
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,991
I'm sorry!

929
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:18,700
You were always the strong one.

930
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:23,539
I'm sorry.

931
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:31,513
I'm okay, Ma.

932
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,684
Go.

933
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,451
Hi, poochie!

934
00:58:09,453 --> 00:58:12,454
- This is her.
- Oh, she's so cute.

935
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:14,590
Oh, my, that is adorable.

936
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:16,692
Look at that face!

937
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:17,860
Hi!

938
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:19,194
Look at your face.

939
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,432
Don't worry about it.
John is gonna love her.

940
00:58:23,434 --> 00:58:24,900
John is gonna love you.

941
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:26,635
- You still okay with this?
- Yeah.

942
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:29,171
- You sure?
- He really needs this.

943
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,240
You ready?

944
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:33,075
John!

945
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,612
Look what G brought.

946
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:38,547
Mom, look at the puppy!

947
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:40,449
Isn't she cute? Come here.

948
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:41,683
Does she have a name?

949
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,819
No, not yet. You
wanna name him?

950
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:44,620
Can I?

951
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,922
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

952
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:49,224
- Wow.
- Mom, can we keep her?

953
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,894
Oh, uh, I don't know.

954
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:54,830
I'll name her Smiley.
Hi, Smiley.

955
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,466
She does have a kind of smile.
Who's gonna take care of her?

956
00:58:57,468 --> 00:59:00,602
I will, I will. I
promise I will.

957
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,274
Okay, then. Smiley it is.

958
00:59:05,276 --> 00:59:06,441
Thank you!

959
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,710
- Welcome home, Smiley!
- Come on.

960
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,781
- Thank you so much.
- No, thank you.

961
00:59:12,783 --> 00:59:14,583
Please stay. I'll
get you a drink.

962
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:15,985
- Let's talk in the kitchen.
- Yeah.

963
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:18,086
Listen, G, I can't
thank you enough

964
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:20,222
for how you've taken
on my burdens here.

965
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,723
Really love you for it.

966
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:22,991
Vanessa, you're
practically family.

967
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:24,726
I'm just glad I could
be here for you.

968
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,762
I wish I was there for that.

969
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:29,731
Listen, there something
I gotta tell you,

970
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,067
something I should've
told you a long time ago.

971
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,137
It's about the night
your father was killed.

972
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,041
Okay.

973
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:44,079
I overheard Frankie and
one of his goons, um...

974
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,749
Uh, what'd you hear?

975
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,322
I think that Frankie
was involved.

976
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:49,177
What? You want me?
I'm right here!

977
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:06,695
Night, boss.

978
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,334
Hey!

979
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:49,738
Why don't you just fucking
stop already, huh?

980
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:53,542
Stop asking questions, stop
fucking snooping around.

981
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:56,244
I mean, you ain't a
fucking cop anymore!

982
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,629
Didn't take you too long.

983
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:58,099
Sorry, Paul. I just
needed a friend.

984
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:00,335
You're more than that.
Come on in.

985
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:23,625
Paul Jr. and Roberto
were the best of friends.

986
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:26,428
Always smiling when
they were together.

987
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:30,398
Anthony, they were
like two sons to me.

988
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:35,170
It hurts like hell that
they're not here anymore.

989
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:41,877
Paul, something happened
with Bobby Stax.

990
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,679
Didn't I tell you to stay out?

991
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:47,482
It just happened.

992
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,621
It doesn't matter anymore, okay?

993
01:04:52,623 --> 01:04:54,556
What do you mean?

994
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:57,225
Bobby did not clip your brother.

995
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:17,345
Frankie Andreoli will be at the
mercantile warehouse tomorrow.

996
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:21,750
Maybe we can finally
close this chapter,

997
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:24,119
and I can get some sleep.

998
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,854
What the fuck do you...

999
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:02,057
You mother...

1000
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,294
Now where's Frankie Andreoli?

1001
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:11,333
- Where the fuck is Frankie?
- Who are you, bastard?

1002
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:13,969
Where do you want a bullet?
You want it in this side?

1003
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,904
You want it in
your fucking nose?

1004
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:17,372
Or how about this side, huh?

1005
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:20,041
You tell me where the
fuck Frankie Andreoli is,

1006
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:21,843
or I'm gonna blow your
fucking brains out!

1007
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:24,646
You motherfucker.
Mercantile warehouse.

1008
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:27,208
You killed my brother.
Now I'm gonna kill you.

1009
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:42,490
Uncle Tony!

1010
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,860
G, what are you doing here?

1011
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:47,862
- Put the gun down.
- Like hell I will.

1012
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:50,832
Talk some sense into him, for
Christ's sakes. All I did was...

1013
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:52,834
What you did was
kill my brother!

1014
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:56,337
Get out, G. He's all mine.

1015
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:58,106
Uncle Tony, what
are you thinking?

1016
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:00,875
Call the fucking cops.
I don't care.

1017
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:03,211
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- I'll do my business.

1018
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:05,580
Hey, whoa, whoa! Uncle
Tony, listen to me, okay?

1019
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:09,551
Because of this fucking
scumbag, I lost my father.

1020
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:11,753
But I don't wanna
lose you now, okay?

1021
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:14,422
- He deserves to die.
- I know.

1022
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:16,791
If you pull that trigger, I
will cover for you, okay?

1023
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:18,493
But they might not believe me,

1024
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:20,762
and then they're gonna put
me in prison after the fact.

1025
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,397
Now this is over. You did it.

1026
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,101
Uncle Tony, I'm begging you.

1027
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,869
Please, just put
down the fucking gun,

1028
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:30,405
and we will deal with this.

1029
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,359
I'm going in the front way!
Jimmy, go around the back!

1030
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:26,794
I'm gonna take the inside!
I got two trucks going!

1031
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,355
Bobby was working with
us as an informant.

1032
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,624
That's how we knew
about Frankie.

1033
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,632
Can I talk to you a minute?

1034
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:07,936
Be right back.

1035
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,440
So who am I talking to?

1036
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:15,443
A struggling actress?
FBI agent?

1037
01:10:15,445 --> 01:10:17,712
Look, I know how all this looks.

1038
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,814
But I promise, if you just
give me a chance to explain.

1039
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:22,884
Just save it, all right?

1040
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,353
Okay.

1041
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:29,557
It'll make for good
dinner conversation.

1042
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,001
Need you to come
by the precinct,

1043
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:41,736
give me a statement, okay?

1044
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:42,738
You too, G.

1045
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,639
No problem.

1046
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:47,842
Come on, let's go home.

1047
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,252
What are we gonna tell 'em?

1048
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,687
Don't gotta explain anything.

1049
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:04,392
According to the law, we
were totally in the right.

1050
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:07,528
Yeah? What law would that be?

1051
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,530
Zarra's law.

1052
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:26,014
Hey! Uncle Tony, what's in this?

1053
01:11:26,016 --> 01:11:28,650
Gravel, pieces of stone.

1054
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,186
You sure that ain't a body?

1055
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:33,588
Nobody you know.

1056
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:37,392
The rope is made of hemp.
It'll dissolve.

1057
01:11:37,394 --> 01:11:39,661
The burlap too.
Biodegradable burlap.

1058
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:41,729
That'll leave the
rocks and gravel.

1059
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:44,032
Nice home for the fish.

1060
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:46,401
How long you been doing this?

1061
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:49,771
Been building this
artificial reef now for,

1062
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:51,706
I don't know, six years?

1063
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,908
As a lawyer, I gotta
ask you a question.

1064
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:55,610
You got a permit for this?

1065
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:58,313
For what? I'm just
out here at the bay,

1066
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,981
minding my own business.

1067
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:01,683
Yeah.

1068
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:05,219
Hey, me and Crystal, we're
going out for dinner tonight.

1069
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:06,654
You wanna join us?

1070
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:10,658
Nah. I don't eat with feds.

1071
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,161
Be careful what you
say, Uncle Tony.

1072
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:16,064
You may have to soon.

1073
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:19,701
Look at you. Is she the one?

1074
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:20,935
Maybe.

1075
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:22,337
She could be. I don't know.

1076
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:25,640
Someday women may be scarce.

1077
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:26,908
Yeah.

1078
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,509
Oh! Casablanca.

1079
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,878
Yeah, and look how
Rick Blaine wound up.

1080
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,583
You don't wanna be alone
like Rick or like me.

1081
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:38,086
See, I've decided that
retirement isn't me.

1082
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:39,320
I'm looking for a job.

1083
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:40,855
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1084
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,924
I'm thinking I might
wanna be an investigator.

1085
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,227
Tony Zarra, PI.

1086
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:48,229
Well, that's got a
nice ring to it, huh?

1087
01:12:48,231 --> 01:12:51,299
- Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
- Got any leads?

1088
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:53,501
I heard this young
lawyer from Hackensack

1089
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,903
might need some
help on his cases.

1090
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:56,971
You got a resume?

1091
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58,439
Yeah, I got a resume.

1092
01:12:58,441 --> 01:13:01,109
Hey, got you again!

1093
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:03,144
Let's load it up there, Gaetano.
