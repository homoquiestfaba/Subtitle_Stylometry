1
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,900
Woman, why are you weeping?

2
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
They've taken away my Lord,

3
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
I don't know
where they've laid him.

4
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Why do you search
for the living among the dead?

5
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,900
Mary.

6
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,800
<i>Rabbouni!</i>

7
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,200
Do not hold on to me,

8
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,000
for I have not yet
ascended to the Father.

9
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,300
But go to my brothers and tell them
I am ascending to my Father,

10
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,800
and to your Father, and to my God,

11
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
and to your God.

12
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,300
Mary!

13
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,200
Mary.

14
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Hold on. Hold on right here.
I'll be right back.

15
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,400
Marie! Have you seen Marie?

16
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,800
Jesus Christ.

17
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,600
Come on, let's go, we're gonna
miss the plane, let's go, come on.

18
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
-Where are you going?
-We're going back to New York,

19
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,100
-what are you kiddin' me?
-I'm not, I'm not going.

20
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,400
What are you talking about you're
not going. Come on. C'mon Marie,

21
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,900
you are crazy like a fox.
We're gonna miss the plane.

22
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,900
We've got 15 minutes
to get to the plane.

23
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,400
-Which plane?
-Look Marie,

24
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,800
do you want me to get down on my
hands and knees and beg you? Please,

25
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,700
-just get into the car and let's go.
-I'm not ready. I can't go.

26
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,900
-I can't. I can't go. I'm not going.
-Listen... Marie,

27
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,300
it's over, it's over.
It's over. Alright? It's over.

28
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,800
We're going home.
We're gonna go cut the film now.

29
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,200
-I don't want to go.
-Where are you going?

30
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,300
I'm going to Jerusalem.

31
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
C'mon! Get in the car!

32
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Marie!

33
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,400
Alright. Fine.

34
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,100
You fucking go to Jerusalem. Great.

35
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,200
Crazy bitch. C'mon, let's go.

36
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,800
Look, you have two answers:
The point of view of Romans,

37
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
He was a dangerous revolutionary,

38
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,300
so they wrote on the cross

39
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,900
-"Jews is the King of the Jews".
-Yes.

40
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
-Which means a rebellious,
-Yes.

41
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,400
-which means a revolutionary.
-Ok.

42
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,700
-Second,
-Ok.

43
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,200
the point of view of Jews,
they acclaimed him

44
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,800
-as something...
-A teacher, as a Rabi.

45
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
-Teacher, Rabi.
-Even more.

46
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,100
-More than a Rabi.
-Even more.

47
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,500
-Yeah. Messiah.
-Perhaps...

48
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,500
Perhaps a Messiah.
One of the Messiahs of the time...

49
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,500
So if he started, if... if... if...
there was a disruption

50
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,100
by Jesus coming in to town,
starting these disruptions, then

51
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,200
the Jewish community who had
to protect the Jewish community,

52
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,500
would have had to deal with that
in some way. Thousands of people

53
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,200
could have been killed because
of this man, standing there and

54
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,400
insighting, possibly a writer.

55
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,500
Now, this is hard
because I'm trying to...

56
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,000
-I'm searching a side of your...
-It's hard, it's difficult.

57
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,700
At the time of Jesus, we are sure

58
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,600
that a lot of persons

59
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
suspected of rebellious actions,

60
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
were crucified by Romans.

61
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,800
It is nothing extraordinary.

62
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,500
The problem is,

63
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,000
who could have interest
to kill him?

64
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,800
That is the problem.

65
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,400
And I don't see where

66
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,800
and for what

67
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,300
the Jews could have interest
to kill Him

68
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,900
while He was considered

69
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,200
a chieftain of the people,
a rebellious chieftain,

70
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,900
and perhaps

71
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,400
one who wanted to become
the King of the Jews, perhaps.

72
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,800
How can we imagine
that Jews could have interest

73
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,300
to kill a person

74
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,600
just because He wanted

75
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,100
to teach them something?

76
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Of course it became
such a complicated issue,

77
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,600
we're going to have
to explore it completely.

78
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,000
We'd like to thank our guest,
Amos Luzzatto.

79
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,600
Please join us again at the
same time tomorrow evening for

80
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
"Jesus, the real story".

81
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is Theodore Younger
saying... good-night.

82
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,900
And we're cut.

83
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,600
Thank you.

84
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,400
Mr. Luzzatto, that was... that was
fantastic, that was really...

85
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,300
Gretchen called. The screening's
at BAM tomorrow at two.

86
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
-Yup.
-I really want to get that guy.

87
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,600
-He would do a lot for the show.
-I'll tell you right now,

88
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,200
-don't worry. That's a done deal.
-Ok.

89
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,000
-See you.
-Bye.

90
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,000
<i>The father and son
were reportedly returning</i>

91
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,000
<i>from a trip to purchase a new car,</i>

92
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,500
<i>when they found themselves
caught in crossfire...</i>

93
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,400
Babe.

94
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,800
Babe?

95
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,900
Elizabeth?

96
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

97
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,300
-Hey, what did you... do in there?
-Oh I painted that room.

98
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,500
-Do you like it?
-Is it ok for you to do that?

99
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,600
Oh I mean I painted a room,
I didn't swim the English Channel.

100
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Were they happy?

101
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,000
Are they ever really happy?

102
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,400
I thought it was really good.

103
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,800
-It was good, right?
-It was fantastic.

104
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,300
You were really... amazing.
I'm really proud of you.

105
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,600
Thank you.

106
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
Everything ok with

107
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,200
little Raphael... or Luke?

108
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,600
Or Samuel.

109
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,400
-We're doing great.
-Samuel Younger.

110
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,700
Sammy.

111
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,000
That's nice.

112
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,300
What... what's... what's wrong,
baby? What's wrong?

113
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,900
I couldn't help it, if I could've got
home earlier I would have. You know?

114
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,800
I'm sorry.

115
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,100
-You know I'm here for you, right?
-Well, it doesn't seem like that.

116
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,500
I mean, we used to always talk
and now we don't talk anymore.

117
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,900
Oh, it's just this f...

118
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,800
It's just pressure all on me,
you know,

119
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,900
between Brenda and

120
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,200
the Network, it's just like...

121
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,400
I don't know if I'm coming
or if I'm going.

122
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,500
Yeah, but I'm here too.

123
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,300
I know.

124
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,800
You know what?
The show is going to be over

125
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,100
Friday, and then all this insanity

126
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,400
is going to be over with,
thank God,

127
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,400
and it'll just be me,
and it'll be you

128
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,100
and little Samuel.

129
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,900
How you doin'?

130
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,800
I'm

131
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,300
Tony Childress
and this is my... my picture

132
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,700
"This is my blood".
I know I'm not supposed to,

133
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,700
you know, come down and
talk to you before a screening

134
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,700
with the... with the press, but

135
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
you know, that's me,
hey, what can I say?

136
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,200
At the drive-in theatre that my
father managed, you know, people...

137
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,200
people would come
to see movies and

138
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,200
there was two kinds of movies
that people really loved,

139
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,400
"tits and ass" movies
and they liked to see

140
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,700
horror movies.

141
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,800
Where...
I can understand as a young man

142
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,800
why people would want to come and
see "tits and ass" movies because,

143
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,400
you know, tits and ass.

144
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,100
But horror movies kinda baffled me.
Well,

145
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,400
why would people wanna
come and see a horror movie,

146
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,500
why would people wanna come and
see a horror movie and be terrified?

147
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,400
Why would they want go and see
"The Exorcist" and... and...

148
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,300
and live with those kind of horrible,
frightening images

149
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,000
that they kind of stay
in your mind for weeks,

150
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,300
months and years? That movie
messed up a lot of people's lives.

151
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,400
And I started thinking that...
that maybe that's why people

152
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,600
go to see the movies
because they wanna be...

153
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,200
They want to be terrified
about something horrific,

154
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,400
something horrible because

155
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,500
it's an opportunity to believe
that there's something else.

156
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,900
That there... that there's
some promise of...

157
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,900
of... of a life after this life.
That there...

158
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,500
there's some promise, that...
that... that when we're dead

159
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,100
that if there's something
that's evil, some kind of

160
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
monsters,
then there must be something good.

161
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,300
So, I hope you enjoy
this religious experience.

162
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,000
But why did you play Jesus?

163
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,800
Why did I play Jesus?
Because I'm a good actor and

164
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,600
I couldn't find anyone else
better than me to play the part.

165
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,400
Watch the movie and
have... have a good time.

166
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,300
Alright. Roll the movie.

167
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,500
How are we to go
among the unbelievers?

168
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,800
To announce the
Gospel of the Kingdom

169
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,800
of the Son of Man.

170
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,400
They didn't spare His life,
eh, Peter?

171
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,500
Why they should spare ours?

172
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,700
Do not remain in sorrow and doubt.
For His grace will guide you

173
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,000
and comfort you.

174
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Instead let us praise His greatness

175
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,500
for He has prepared us for this.

176
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,000
He is calling upon us
to become fully human.

177
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,600
Sister.

178
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,400
We all know that
the Teacher loved you

179
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,200
differently from other women.

180
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,800
Tell us whatever
you remember about words

181
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,700
that He told you,
that we did not hear.

182
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,400
I will now speak to you about
which you haven't heard.

183
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,700
I had a vision of the Teacher

184
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,500
and I said to Him,
"Lord, I see you now in this vision"

185
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,800
and then He said to me,
"You are blessed,

186
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,800
for the sight of Me
does not disturb you.

187
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,400
There where is the noose
lies the treasure."

188
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,300
And then I said to Him,

189
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,500
"Lord, when someone meets You
in a moment of vision,

190
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,200
is it through the soul
that they see You or is it

191
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,300
through the spirit?"
And He said to me,

192
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,700
"It is neither through the soul
nor the spirit,

193
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,700
but the noose
which sees the vision"

194
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,100
Tell me,

195
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,800
what do you think
about these things?

196
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,600
As for me, I do not believe

197
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,800
that the Teacher, our Teacher

198
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,400
speak like this.
He wouldn't have speak like this.

199
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,900
-That's what I think.
-How is it possible

200
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,500
that the Teacher talk
in this manner,

201
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,900
with a woman about secrets

202
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,200
that we do not know?

203
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,600
Must we change our customs
and listen to this woman?

204
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,700
Did he really choose her

205
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,600
and prefer her to us?

206
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,400
My brother Peter,
what can you be thinking?

207
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,200
Do you believe that I would...?
This is my own imagination?

208
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,300
That I invented this vision?

209
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,700
Or do you believe that
I would lie about our Teacher?

210
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,900
Peter,
you have always been hot tempered,

211
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,100
and now we see
you repudiating a woman

212
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,700
just as our adversaries do.

213
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,800
If the Teacher held her worthy,
who are you

214
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
to reject her?

215
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Don't stand there staring,
I mean look at it, it's red on red,

216
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,900
you can't read it, you're a smart
lady, you get paid a lot of money.

217
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,800
Call somebody, get it fixed.

218
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
-Well done.
-Thanks very much.

219
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,000
I appreciate you coming.
Thank you very much.

220
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,900
-Very kind of you.
-Excuse me, do you have a moment?

221
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,900
-Don't worry.
-Hi, you did a great job.

222
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,000
A great job. Let me
introduce you to my friend Ted.

223
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,400
-Hi Ted.
-Nice to meet you. Congratulations.

224
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,600
-Think they really liked the movie.
-Yeah, no. It's... it's fascinating.

225
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,400
Marie Palesi, I mean.
How did you get her to do all that?

226
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,500
It was a lot of work, let me
tell you, she's not an easy actress.

227
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
-You must feel great, huh?!
-I'll feel better once I'm outa here.

228
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm not worried about
the picketing on Friday.

229
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,400
-Do you want a lift to the city?
-Yeah,

230
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,000
yeah, can I meet you outside?
Let me answer a few questions.

231
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
-You must have heard of...
-I'll meet you right out front.

232
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm not worried about a damn thing,
and you know what?

233
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,400
I think all the protestors
ought to come in the theatre

234
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,000
and watch the movie and make
their minds up, instead of making

235
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,400
judgements about something they
don't know anything about. Thank you.

236
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,500
-Yes, that's quite a film.
-Yeah, thanks.

237
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,700
-It's a good screening.
-Yeah, before I forget,

238
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,600
let me get you my... my card.

239
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,100
Theodore,
you know what that means, right?

240
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,900
God's gift.

241
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,800
God's gift.
I could use one of those.

242
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,300
Always good to have
God on your side.

243
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,200
I like your show, it's good.

244
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,300
Get the opportunity to present
both sides of an argument.

245
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
And it's getting good ratings.
Good for you.

246
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,600
-You follow my ratings? Nice.
-Yeah.

247
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
I really appreciate it.
I appreciate you... you liking it.

248
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,400
-It means a lot to me.
-You're the man.

249
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,300
It's just television but...

250
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,100
Don't knock television.
Television is where it's at.

251
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,200
My agent's pitching me for a couple
of shows right now, as we speak.

252
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,100
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

253
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
You know what? I would love
to have you on the show.

254
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,500
We are going to be doing "Jesus from
the Hollywood perspective" showing

255
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,100
art and some film clips.

256
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
"Jesus from the Hollywood
perspective", that's funny.

257
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,800
C'mmon, c'mmon, what?
Is it possible or what?

258
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,200
Yeah?

259
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I mean obviously I would show
your film in the best possible way.

260
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,400
I would hope so.

261
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,400
Tony, it would really... be great
for me if you could be on the show.

262
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,300
Alright, let's cut to the chase.

263
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,300
I'll do an interview on your show,
if you come to the premier on Friday

264
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,900
and cover it, live.

265
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,500
Wow. I'd love to do that.

266
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,300
You know, if it were up to me
I'd do it in a heart beat.

267
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,800
Come on. You've got the ratings,
that gives you the power.

268
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,000
I want people to see what's happening
to the First Amendment.

269
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,600
I want people to see
that in New York fucking city,

270
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,400
people are imposing censorship
on my right to freedom of speech.

271
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,700
I want the fucking world
to see this.

272
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,000
It's a great idea.

273
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,200
I'm gonna have to talk to the
Network, but it's a great idea.

274
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,000
There's always somebody.

275
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,200
Everybody can be
as independent like you.

276
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,600
If you only knew...

277
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,500
What about Marie? Do you think
we could get Marie on the show?

278
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
-Marie?
-Yes.

279
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,000
Marie is busy.

280
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,800
We wanted to take
a short cut to avoid traffic.

281
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,400
It just... it just happened, alright?
Does... does...?

282
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
I need some aspirin,
does anyone have any aspirin?

283
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
You know, it's... it's...

284
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,500
You know, it's fine, it's fine, ok?

285
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,700
It's fine. This is... You know,
you can't blame these kids anyway

286
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,500
for reacting like that.
Everybody's fighting over bullshit.

287
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,600
I just wish they would just leave me
the fuck out of it. You know what,

288
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,100
why don't I just go on
the air right now, you know,

289
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,800
blood and all and just talk about
this bullshit, 'cos this is bullshit.

290
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,200
-We can't do that. It's not the news.
-Yeah we can.

291
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,200
-Just put some make-up on it.
-You know what? Don't.

292
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,200
Don't fix it. It's fine, it's fine,
I don't need it to be fixed.

293
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,100
Thank you, Dina. Thanks.

294
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,800
But, the question is, can we live

295
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,900
completely and holdly
as a spiritual being

296
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,700
inside of society?

297
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,300
I'd like to ask you,
how do you accomplish... that?

298
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,900
Yeah, yeah.
It's interesting that in the

299
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,700
tradition monastic,

300
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,800
for example tradition of Camaldoli,
there is

301
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,000
strong experience of solitude,

302
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,500
but at the same time there is the

303
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,400
opening to mission,

304
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,800
so to meet other people,

305
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,300
to be able to welcome people.

306
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,600
Seekers,

307
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,700
seekers of God,
or of a meaning of life,

308
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,300
and to be able to be in touch
to welcome, no, with joy...

309
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,400
The person who visits you
is God incarnate,

310
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,800
because God is inside of everyone,

311
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,900
and you have to treat them as if

312
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,800
-that experience is with God.
-But in Jesus

313
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,300
he reveals as

314
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,400
an extraordinary incarnate,

315
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,100
vulnerable,

316
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,100
passionate

317
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,400
and liberating people,

318
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
-so that is very important, not this
-The Figure of Christ.

319
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,200
full immersion

320
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,300
and contamination,
I would say, you know?

321
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,100
Contamination that is to say

322
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,300
not God as pure,

323
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,800
separated authentic

324
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,600
by the human condition but

325
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,700
in touch with. You know?
And the experience to Jesus is

326
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,300
to be open to the outcasts,

327
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,000
to the marginalized people,

328
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,900
to the sinners, no? The persons

329
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,100
considered far from God.

330
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,000
And Craving said,

331
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,600
"I did not see you descend,
but now I see you rising,

332
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,800
and why do you lie to me
since you belong to me?"

333
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,400
And the Soul answered, "I saw you,

334
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
though you did not see me
nor recognize me.

335
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,300
I was with you as with a garment,
and you never felt me."

336
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,900
I never realized how... how good
she was, you know, she's... God,

337
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,900
she like knocked me out.

338
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,400
Yeah.

339
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,200
She is really good.

340
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,100
She coming back for the premier?

341
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,800
I don't know. I don't think so.

342
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
Kidding, right?

343
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,800
I mean,

344
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,100
she's been away
for like a year now.

345
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,300
A year?

346
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,200
A year.

347
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,000
Where is she?

348
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
I don't know.

349
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,800
You don't know?

350
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,600
No.

351
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,600
How do you not know where she is,
I mean, your best friend, right?

352
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,100
You must know where she is.

353
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,600
We are, I

354
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,700
just don't know where
she is right now, that's all.

355
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,900
Look, she went through some...

356
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,700
This can't leave this room.

357
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,300
No, this can't leave this room.

358
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
-No. What? What?
-Promise me.

359
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,800
You promise me?

360
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
I promise,

361
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,100
I promise, ok so... Come on,
Gretchen, tell me what's up.

362
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,200
She went through some
heavy stuff after the movie.

363
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,700
She told me that

364
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,400
she was living in two worlds

365
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,800
that she could go into the past
and see the truth.

366
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,300
-Oh man!
-Fucking Tony,

367
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
he pushed her to a bad place.

368
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,000
He always fucked with her head.

369
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,800
He always knew
just where to get her.

370
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,300
Well, it seems like

371
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,300
he got a great performance
out of her, that's what I know.

372
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,300
At what cost?

373
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,500
When you're an actor,

374
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,300
sometimes it's really hard
to get back out.

375
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,100
It's a director's job to help you.

376
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,500
He just left her hanging.

377
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,300
Do you think Marie's
gonna come back soon?

378
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,000
What are you, writing a book?

379
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,500
Oh no, I'm just curious,
I'm just curious.

380
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,400
You're curious.

381
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,500
<i>-Marie?
-Yes?</i>

382
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,800
It's Ted.

383
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,800
Theodore Younger?
I'm... I'm one of Gretchen's friends.

384
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,200
<i>-Is Gretchen ok?
-Oh no, she's great, she's great.</i>

385
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,200
Now I went to the... to Tony's
screening this afternoon and,

386
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,800
wow, I mean congratulations,
your were... you were great.

387
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,600
<i>-Your performance was great.
-What is it you want?</i>

388
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,000
I was just wondering
how you were doing, that's all.

389
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,000
<i>-That's all?
-Well that, and the other thing is,</i>

390
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,500
I'm doing a

391
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,000
national television show
on the life of Jesus,

392
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,500
and Tony, he's gonna do
an interview with me,

393
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,400
<i>-and I'd love to have you too.
-Why?</i>

394
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,200
Why what?

395
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,700
<i>Why are you doing a show,
a programme on Jesus?</i>

396
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,000
I do... I don't understand... why.

397
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,200
Do you believe in Jesus?

398
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,500
Well I...

399
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,800
I don't know, I guess he existed.
Yeah, sure.

400
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,300
<i>No, what do you believe?</i>

401
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
I don't know.

402
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,700
<i>It takes courage to</i>

403
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,800
<i>walk in the truth,
and it takes courage</i>

404
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,200
<i>to become fully humans.</i>

405
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,000
<i>Jesus helped Mary Magdalene,
she's helping me now.</i>

406
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,000
Hello?

407
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,100
Hello?

408
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,900
Go back to the city, to the city.

409
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,300
I wanna go back to the city.
I want to go to 54th and Park.

410
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,600
Yeah, I wanna go back. Thanks.

411
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
What do we actually know
about Jesus and his followers,

412
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,100
how do we know it,
and what else didn't we know?

413
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,200
And the answer is
there's a lot we didn't know.

414
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,700
The Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of
Philip, the Gospel of Mary Magdalene,

415
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,500
these were apparently buried
nearly two thousand years ago,

416
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,500
when a bishop,
who thought they were secret

417
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,400
and heretical writings,
told the monks to get rid of them,

418
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,200
and somebody disobeyed
the bishop and buried them

419
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,100
out by a cliff where
they were found in 1945.

420
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,600
It's clear that when you look at
these other secret gospels, including

421
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,600
the Gospel of Mary and the Gospel
of Philip and the Gospel of Thomas,

422
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,500
that Mary Magdalene who appears
in the gospels of the New Testament

423
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,400
just as one of the women,
she's not a disciple,

424
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
she's just a very marginal character.
In these other texts

425
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,200
there's often a running battle
between Mary and Peter.

426
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,100
It could be a rivalry
for the role of

427
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,000
disciple closest to Jesus.

428
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,000
What you find in... in

429
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,900
sort of ancient legend history,
she was a prostitute.

430
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,000
Modern fiction turns her
into a lover and wife of Jesus.

431
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,700
But what you find in
these early texts is that she is

432
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,000
neither a prostitute nor a lover.
She's...

433
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,400
She's one of the disciples,
and one of the most important.

434
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,700
The Jesus of the New Testament

435
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,800
is usually characterized
as somebody utterly unique.

436
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,700
Marc says, "This is the Gospel of
Jesus the Messiah, the son of God."

437
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,000
John says, "He's the only begotten
son of God, there's nobody like Him."

438
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,400
The Gospel of Thomas
suggests that

439
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,400
yes, Jesus comes forth from God,
but the...

440
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,900
the teaching of the Gospel
of Thomas, the good news is...

441
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
So do you, and so do I.

442
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,500
That we also come from

443
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,300
the divine light,
we also come from that source,

444
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,900
because we are created
in the divine image.

445
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,800
And so the Gospel of Thomas
suggests that you too can become

446
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,400
a child of God, just like Jesus,
because you have within you

447
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,200
the divine light,
or created in the image of God.

448
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,000
The fact that you may not need
the Church, or the Priest, or

449
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,700
even Jesus.
You could go back to yourself

450
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,000
and as the Gospel of Thomas
has Jesus say,

451
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,700
"If you bring forth
what is within you,

452
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,600
what you bring forth
will save you.

453
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,900
If you do not bring forth
what is within you,

454
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,200
what you do not bring forth
will destroy you."

455
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,200
And this of course, from the point
of view of Orthodoxy is blasphemy.

456
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,600
<i>-Why was the phone off?
-Why the hell was yours?</i>

457
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,100
I don't know, I... I must have
turned it off by mistake. I'm sorry.

458
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,600
<i>Well, what if I went
into labour last night, huh?</i>

459
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,100
<i>-What's the matter with you?
-Elisabeth, I was working, ok?</i>

460
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
<i>Well, since when do you
stay out working all night?</i>

461
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,900
Since when do I have a national
fucking television programme?

462
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,400
I got the entire responsibility of
the show on my fucking shoulders

463
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,000
or... or... or is that beyond
your comprehension, Elisabeth?

464
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,100
Oh, beyond my comprehension!
Since when did you become such a

465
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,800
fucking asshole?
I've always supported you 100%,

466
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,100
you're an ungrateful
fucking asshole.

467
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,500
<i>Hey! I was doing research.</i>

468
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,000
<i>I lost track of the time.
Ok? Alright?</i>

469
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,600
<i>That's all that happened. I fell
asleep on the couch in my office.</i>

470
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,300
<i>Why... What is this, some kind
of interrogation or something?</i>

471
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,300
Hold... hold on a second,
hold on a second.

472
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,700
Brenda, could you please

473
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,000
tell Elisabeth that
I was doing research all night

474
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,200
and I fell asleep
on the sofa in my office?

475
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,900
I'll be there in a minute.

476
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,800
I can't get into this right now.

477
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,800
<i>My hole future is on the line here.
I gotta prepare for my show.</i>

478
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Your future. What about our future?

479
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,100
<i>-You know what I meant.
-Well that's not what you said.</i>

480
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,000
<i>Listen,</i>

481
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,900
<i>I don't have time to play
these little word games with you.</i>

482
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,700
<i>I gotta go to work.
I got things to do, ok?</i>

483
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,700
Go to hell!

484
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,600
<i>Hello?</i>

485
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,400
<i>-Hey.
-Hey.</i>

486
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,900
Yeah, I... You know... I mean,
I should have called you last night.

487
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,200
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

488
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,800
<i>It's, you know... It's all the
stress and stuff, you know...</i>

489
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,800
<i>I get a... It's not...
I'm not making any excuses.</i>

490
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,900
<i>I shoulda... I shoulda called you,
you know?</i>

491
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,300
Well, I'm sorry I hung up on you,

492
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,700
but I hope you come home soon.

493
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,100
<i>Yeah...</i>

494
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,200
<i>-Yeah, when can you come home?
-Listen, I'm gonna</i>

495
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,800
finish this show and then I'm gonna
come straight home, you know.

496
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,700
I can't wait to see you too.
I need to see you right now.

497
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,700
<i>-I need to see you, ok?
-Ok.</i>

498
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,400
<i>-Ok?
-Ok.</i>

499
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,400
<i>-Sorry.
-Ok.</i>

500
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,000
<i>-Ok, bye.
-Ok.</i>

501
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,100
<i>-Le Christe lui a donné la parole.
-Christ gave her the word.</i>

502
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,400
<i>Avant la résurrection son language
c'est celui decheveux,</i>

503
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,500
<i>-celui du parfum.
-Before the resurrection,</i>

504
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,200
the way she spoke was
with the hair, with the perfume.

505
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,300
<i>Et le Christe I'a conduit
à son accomplissement.</i>

506
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,400
Christ led her
to her self fulfilment.

507
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,400
<i>Non seulement elle
peut être une femme,</i>

508
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,400
Not only can she be a woman.

509
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,200
<i>mais elle peut parler et enseigner
comme un homme.</i>

510
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,300
But she can speak
and teach like a man.

511
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,800
<i>Et cela, un aspect important</i>

512
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,100
<i>-And that is a significant aspect.
-pour</i>

513
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,600
<i>-marcher avec le Christe.
-To go hand in hand with Christ.</i>

514
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,300
<i>Les hommes doivent intégrer
leur dimension féminine</i>

515
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,500
Man must include
and integrate their

516
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,900
female dimension.

517
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,000
<i>et les femmes doivent intégrer
leur dimension masculine</i>

518
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,200
And woman must integrate,
include, incorporate, their

519
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,900
men's dimension.

520
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,300
<i>pour devenir non seulement
des males et des femelles,</i>

521
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,400
<i>-...not just males and females.
-mais des êtres humains.</i>

522
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,900
-But Human Beings.
-A question, a question. Is...

523
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,400
<i>-Peter's problem with Mary
-Le problème de Pierre avec Marie.</i>

524
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,100
<i>-C'est quoi comme problème?
-that she's a woman,</i>

525
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,800
<i>-Le fait que'elle est une femme.
-saying these words,</i>

526
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,400
<i>Qui dit ces mots,
qui prononce ces mots.</i>

527
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,500
that she is putting herself
in the primary position as the

528
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,600
<i>-number one disciple, if you would.
-...position, la plus importante,</i>

529
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,000
<i>comme</i>

530
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,500
<i>-Or both.
-...qui a la primauté...</i>

531
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,100
<i>Je crois que le problème
ce sont les deux.</i>

532
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,200
<i>-Mais surtout, peut-être,
-Both, both are the problems.</i>

533
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,300
<i>-parce que c'est une femme.
-But mostly because it's a woman.</i>

534
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:29,900
Babe?

535
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,600
Elisabeth?

536
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,500
Jesus.

537
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,200
Elisabeth!

538
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,200
Elisabeth!

539
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,600
Elisabeth!

540
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,700
-I tried to call you so many times.
-What happened?

541
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,500
-What happened?
-She was screaming,

542
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,600
-I come inside. She was bleeding.
-Where is she? Where is she?

543
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,300
Where is...? Let's go!

544
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,900
Could you tell me
which way is room 340, please?

545
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,600
Thank you.

546
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,700
Oh my God.

547
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,500
-Is she ok?
-Are you Mr. Younger?

548
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,400
-Yeah. Is she alright?
-Yes. She just need to rest now.

549
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,700
What's wrong with her?

550
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,900
You should speak to the doctor
about that. I don't know.

551
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,500
-Can you go get the doctor, please?
-Yes, but just... You know...

552
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,700
Hey, hey, don't touch me!
What's wrong with you?

553
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,400
-Hey listen. You gotta be quiet.
-I don't go to do nothing.

554
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,700
I'm going to call the doctor right
now but you've go to be quiet.

555
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,400
-Please. She needs to rest, alright?
-Will you just go get the doctor?

556
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,200
Is the baby ok?

557
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,600
-You should talk to the doctor.
-You can't tell me if the baby is ok?

558
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,400
Can you wait for the doctor for just
one minute and he will explain, ok?

559
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,900
Can you just tell me
if my baby is ok? Shit.

560
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,900
This is crazy.

561
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,300
This is crazy, baby.

562
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,200
Little guy.

563
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,200
It's ok.

564
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,100
It's ok.

565
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,200
Don't worry.

566
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,400
Hi buddy.

567
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,500
It's ok.

568
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,900
It's alright.

569
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,200
It's ok. Look, look.

570
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,200
It's me.

571
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,800
<i>In Jerusalem,</i>

572
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,000
<i>observing Jews will soon
begin their preparations</i>

573
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,700
<i>for the passover holiday.
But this year</i>

574
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,400
<i>the celebration of the Israelites</i>

575
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,600
<i>will again take place
against the backdrop...</i>

576
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,400
-Hello?
-Marie?

577
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:41,800
Yes?

578
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,600
-It's Ted.
-Ted? Hi.

579
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,000
You there?

580
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,400
My wife's had the...

581
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,800
She had the baby, you know.
I'm not really sure of that.

582
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,600
I'm really, really, really bad.

583
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,100
They don't know if they're
gonna make it or not, you know.

584
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,200
My baby is so sick, you know.
So sick.

585
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Can't even breath and he's...

586
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,500
-Do you love your baby?
-Yeah.

587
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,200
As his father would you do
everything in your power for him?

588
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,100
Everything.

589
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,600
If your baby asked for something

590
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,400
-would you give it to him?
-Yes. Yeah.

591
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,700
Do you think the father, your father,
would do the same for you?

592
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,300
You know what?
My dad's dead, but yeah, I can s...

593
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,700
No, I mean your Father, Ted,
the Father's always there.

594
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,600
He loves us more than
we humans can comprehend.

595
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,700
Oh well, if He loves me so much,
why is He doing this to me then?

596
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,600
Have you asked Him?
Have you spoken to Him?

597
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,100
How am I gonna ask Him if I don't
even know if I believe in Him?

598
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,500
How am I gonna go to Him?

599
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,000
I don't know how to speak to Him.
I don't know how to do that.

600
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,200
Well, He sent us a messenger
so we could understand,

601
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,400
so go to Him, pray, try.

602
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,000
I can't speak to God.

603
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,200
Oh Ted. Ted.

604
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,700
Ted, is that you?

605
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,300
How are you feelin'?
You o...? How are you feelin'?

606
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,200
-Did you see him?
-Yeah.

607
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,900
How is he?

608
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,700
He's ok, they're... they're
taking care of him, you know.

609
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,200
I didn't get to see him,
they took him away so fast.

610
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,500
I didn't even get to hold him.
Did you hold him?

611
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,100
No.

612
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,700
He was sleeping so I... I... I...
didn't want to wake him up, you know.

613
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,600
How does he look?
I didn't even get to hold him.

614
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,600
Oh man, he is so hansom,
I mean he looks just like you.

615
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,500
He's so... beautiful. Really he...
I can't wait til you see him.

616
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,700
I'm sorry I didn't know what to do,
I mean, your show was on and...

617
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,000
Don't even think about that.
I'm here, ok? I'm here.

618
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,800
What if something happens to him?

619
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,500
Just don't even think about that,
ok? Don't even think about that,

620
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,400
you need to just rest
and you need to get well.

621
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,500
I want to see my baby.
I don't care what the doctors say.

622
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,700
No, baby, baby, you got to rest, ok?
I'm gonna take care of it.

623
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,900
I'm gonna take care of it.
Not right now, you can't, ok?

624
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,000
-You just stay here, ok?
-Go see him. Don't leave him alone.

625
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,500
-You can't get in, you can't get in.
-Is he ok?

626
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,000
He's ok. You can't get in.

627
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,400
Peace I leave with you,
my peace I give to you.

628
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,400
I do not give us, the world gives.

629
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,700
Do not let your hearts be troubled,
do not let them be afraid.

630
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
If you loved me, you would rejoice.

631
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,200
The hour has come when you will be
scattered. Each one to his own home,

632
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,000
and I will be left alone.

633
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,800
Because they will persecute you
as they've persecuted me.

634
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,600
They do this to fulfil the word

635
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,800
that is written in their law.

636
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,900
They hate it without cause.

637
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,400
I've said these things to you
to keep you from stumbling.

638
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,000
The hour is come when you will be
put out of the synagogues.

639
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,000
Indeed, the hour has come

640
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,700
when those who kill you
will think that by doing so,

641
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,200
they are offering
worship... to God.

642
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,000
I've said these things to you
before they occur,

643
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,900
so that when they do occur,

644
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,700
you may remember
that I spoke of them

645
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,200
and you may believe.

646
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,400
Five,

647
01:00:58,900 --> 01:00:59,600
four,

648
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,100
three,

649
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,600
two...

650
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,400
You have just watched the film clip
from the feature film

651
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:11,800
"This is my Blood",
which opens Friday nationwide,

652
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,600
and we are here
with Tony Childress,

653
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,100
writer, director and star

654
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,100
of "This is my Blood."

655
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,800
Tony,
why did you want to make a movie

656
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,500
about Jesus?

657
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,400
Well, 'cuz that gives a movie
maybe like a million dollars.

658
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,200
No, I'm kiddin'.

659
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,200
I mean, the... the story of Christ
today is as relevant today

660
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,100
as it was two thousand years ago.

661
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,900
That when Christ gets nailed
to the cross, it's you

662
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:44,300
getting nailed to the cross, man.
It's me getting nailed to the cross.

663
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,300
It's the whole society
getting nailed to the fucking cross.

664
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,200
-Yeah.
-You know what I'm saying?

665
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,900
Have you been nailed
to the cross, Tony?

666
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,600
Do you know what it's like
to be nailed to the cross?

667
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,000
That's a... that's a...
You know, you're going deep, baby.

668
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,600
-That nailed to the cross...
-Friday night there are going to be

669
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,600
protests.

670
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,100
They are organizing protests
to picket your film

671
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,400
at your premier.
How do you feel about that?

672
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,000
I think that the people
that are protesting films

673
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,200
should have an opinion
and an idea about

674
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,200
what it is that they are protesting.
Religious films

675
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,200
are always subject to criticism.

676
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,700
Look what they did to Scorsese with
"The Last Temptation of Christ."

677
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,800
The thing is that it's a lack
of intelligence, it's a lack of...

678
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,600
Is it a lack of intelligence
or a statement of faith?

679
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,100
Is it a statement
of desecrating a God,

680
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,800
desecrating the...

681
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,800
the image of what
you're supposed to love?

682
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
Well, it depends on
how you interpret faith.

683
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,000
The traditional approach
to religion,

684
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,000
but who decides what is the
traditional approach to religion?

685
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,600
Because something that you read in
a book, because something that you...

686
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,200
We are talking about love.
We're talking about love

687
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,900
and Jesus represents love,

688
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,800
then why are you trying to destroy
the image of Jesus Christ?

689
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,100
-My movie's all about love, baby.
-Ok.

690
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,200
You saw it.

691
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,900
I understand.

692
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,500
-Well...
-We need to get Marie on the line.

693
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,100
I mean we all have opinions about
who Christ is, who Christ was.

694
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:21,200
But those opinions are based on...
on things that we learned in church,

695
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,300
based on things
we've read in bibles,

696
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,300
-religious stories that have been...
-You know what, you know what, Tony?

697
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,400
I talked to my mother
the other night.

698
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,800
I called her up and I said,
"Ma, there are all these

699
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,400
books,
Gospel books I've never seen before,

700
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,900
telling me all these
different things

701
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,700
about Christ and... Mary."

702
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,100
And she said, "Oh well,

703
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,300
I think if God hadn't want it,
He would have gave it to us because

704
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,500
I have everything
I need to know here.

705
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,600
There's nothing wrong with that."
And I said, "Well,

706
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,900
what do you mean, Ma?"
And she said,

707
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,600
"Well, it doesn't matter how many
times you tell or retell the story,

708
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,200
it doesn't matter if you change
it all around, it doesn't

709
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,600
matter because... because

710
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,500
God is talking about love,
God's saying,

711
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,000
"You need to love your fellow man,
you need to

712
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,000
love your family,
you need to love God..."

713
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,400
-Right on.
-So you don't really need to...

714
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,800
to do the thing... You don't
even need to retell the story.

715
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,600
What you need to do is...

716
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,300
I think your mum should come and
watch my movie because it sounds...

717
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,400
Sorry to interrupt you but Marie
Palesi is on the phone, on line.

718
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,700
<i>-Are you still there?
-Yeah.</i>

719
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:43,500
Ok.

720
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,600
-Marie Palesi.
-What's it...?

721
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,000
<i>-Hello?
-Yes?</i>

722
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,200
<i>-Marie?
-Hello.</i>

723
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,300
<i>-It's Ted. It's Ted.
-Hi, hi Ted.</i>

724
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,300
<i>-Thank you for coming on my show.
-Oh, you're welcome.</i>

725
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,100
<i>-Hello Tony.
-Hello Marie.</i>

726
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,600
Yours is a fascinating story.

727
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,400
A successful artist,
promising career.

728
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,500
Yet you decided
to leave it all behind.

729
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,800
What would make you leave behind

730
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,400
being an actress, Marie?

731
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,700
<i>I had no other choice.</i>

732
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,700
<i>I played the role of Mary Magdalene
in Tony's movie and I</i>

733
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,900
<i>-Yes.
-became fascinated and inspired</i>

734
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,400
<i>-by her.
-Yes.</i>

735
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,800
<i>When you decide to change your life
you must give all yourself,</i>

736
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,100
<i>so...</i>

737
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:50,200
<i>You know, my heart was hardly
able to contain anything else.</i>

738
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,600
<i>-Right.
-That's why I stayed and...</i>

739
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,200
What are you doing now?
Healing lepers?

740
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,800
<i>I'd say that we are all capable
of becoming better people.</i>

741
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,300
<i>You know we see the results of
people in inner turmoil every day</i>

742
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,500
<i>and the one thing I'd like to say</i>

743
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,800
<i>is that my wish is that
all people in the world</i>

744
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,500
<i>acquire peace within themselves.</i>

745
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,900
<i>-That's all I wanted to say.
-That's beautiful.</i>

746
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,800
Marie, thanks for

747
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,600
<i>-sharing your insights with us today.
-You're welcome. Thank you.</i>

748
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,900
<i>-"Shalom". Bye.
-"Shalom".</i>

749
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,600
And we're cut.

750
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,600
What the fuck was that? Why did
you have her on during my interview?

751
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,700
It's my idea. Sorry, I'm the producer
of the show, Brenda Sax...

752
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:41,000
I don't give a fuck who you are.
You invited me to come on to my...

753
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,900
-Come on to the show to talk about...
-We... we did, Tony.

754
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,300
-We talked about the film.
-I thought it was a good idea

755
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,900
to have two guests
of the same movie.

756
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:52,000
You invited me to come on to the show
to talk about my movie, not to...

757
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,800
not to do an interview with her.
What was she doing on my show?

758
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,400
-Honestly I...
-What was she doing on your movie?

759
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,200
-What d'you mean...?
-This is bullshit, man.

760
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,500
-We had an agreement.
-We still have an agreement.

761
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:05,700
-Yeah?
-We do.

762
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,600
I'll see you Friday.

763
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
You better hold up
your side of the deal!

764
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,900
<i>-The madness of God.
-The madness.</i>

765
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,600
<i>Madness of God.</i>

766
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,700
<i>Because there is</i>

767
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,700
<i>an extreme, an expressive gesture</i>

768
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:45,800
<i>he does, that is his</i>

769
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,000
<i>taking off his robe,</i>

770
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,000
<i>and beginning to wash</i>

771
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,100
<i>the disciple's feet.</i>

772
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,300
<i>And for me that is</i>

773
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,600
<i>a very important</i>

774
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,700
<i>-Statemen.
-expression because</i>

775
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,400
<i>stripping himself,</i>

776
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:12,800
<i>he puts himself outside</i>

777
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
<i>every</i>

778
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,200
<i>position and</i>

779
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,200
<i>-social status.
-I understand, yeah.</i>

780
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,800
<i>Is that gesture how you reference
when you reference madness?</i>

781
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,800
<i>The last supper,</i>

782
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,100
<i>-the last supper of Jesus,
-Yes.</i>

783
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:30,000
<i>in that one in the John's Gospel,</i>

784
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,500
<i>-he does this gesture
-Right.</i>

785
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,800
<i>and he found the only</i>

786
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,500
<i>hierarchy</i>

787
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,400
<i>possible of his life,</i>

788
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,900
<i>and which is a hierarchy of love.</i>

789
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,800
<i>That is to say,</i>

790
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,100
<i>he wants, just yearns,</i>

791
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,700
<i>to live in the heart</i>

792
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,900
<i>of his own friends there.</i>

793
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,300
<i>So I...</i>

794
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,200
<i>So that gesture was his expression
of how much I care for you</i>

795
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,200
<i>because it was breaking
every social tabu.</i>

796
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,200
<i>"And I am able</i>

797
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,400
<i>to give myself in this way to you,</i>

798
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,200
<i>and so I underline</i>

799
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,500
<i>what is essential in my existence</i>

800
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,000
<i>and that could be important</i>

801
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,200
<i>-for your existence."
-As a last gesture</i>

802
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,200
<i>before he actually</i>

803
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,700
<i>is crucified, he says,
"Here I do this for you"</i>

804
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,400
<i>This is a memory I leave with you,
not necessarily</i>

805
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,600
<i>-an image on the cross,
-No, no.</i>

806
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,000
<i>-my love.
-This is gesture of love,</i>

807
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,400
yes.

808
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,500
<i>If it's because of something I did,</i>

809
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,900
<i>then punish me.</i>

810
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,800
<i>Punish me.</i>

811
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:03,800
<i>I've sinned.</i>

812
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,700
<i>Punish me.</i>

813
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,200
<i>Punish me.</i>

814
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,700
<i>Punish me.</i>

815
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,600
<i>Don't punish them.</i>

816
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,100
I'm asking you,

817
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,000
I'm begging you to please,

818
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,600
take my life, not theirs.

819
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,400
If you could just save my wife

820
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,100
and save my kid,

821
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,600
could you forgive me for all the
things I've done, all the horrible...

822
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,600
things I've done.
I've done so many bad things.

823
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,600
Because I wanna feel You,

824
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,400
I do.

825
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:57,600
There's a hole inside me.

826
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,200
And I'm lost.

827
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,700
I'm so lost,

828
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,000
and I'm so empty inside.

829
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,800
I don't know
how to find myself anymore.

830
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,100
I don't know who I am.
I don't know.

831
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,100
If you could just show me.
If you could help me

832
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,700
find myself again.

833
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,600
Please.

834
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:30,900
Please.

835
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,500
Could you take this away from me?

836
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:41,000
Could you take this away?
Can you make my wife and my kid ok?

837
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,300
Could you just take this away?

838
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,400
Please, 'cuz if it's me,
just take me, 'cuz I don't...

839
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,000
I'm sorry.

840
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,700
I'm so sorry.

841
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,200
I just don't know, you know?

842
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,300
I just didn't know.

843
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,300
I just didn't know.

844
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,700
-Any news?
-No news.

845
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,700
-Keep trying.
-We're waiting for you.

846
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,000
Yeah. I'm coming.

847
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,800
How can he just
disappear like that?

848
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,400
He better be dead.

849
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,600
There's no answer.

850
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,500
Everybody here?

851
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,900
<i>This lie inspired the murder</i>

852
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,200
<i>of my people in the millions
over the centuries</i>

853
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:46,100
<i>and this lie inspires,
inspired the Holocaust itself.</i>

854
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,900
<i>...where people have gathered
in protest of the film director</i>

855
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,000
<i>Tony Childress and his new film
"This is my Blood."</i>

856
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,400
<i>I didn't necessarily find it
anti-Semitic. I'm Jewish,</i>

857
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,700
<i>I did find it more anti-Roman
than anti-Jewish, for sure.</i>

858
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,800
Tony Childress!

859
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,500
-What are your thoughts about it?
-I've got a question. Where's Ted?

860
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,200
-I'm Brenda Sax,
-He said he was going to cover this.

861
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,600
-standing in for Ted.
-Yeah?

862
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,400
I've got nothing to say to you...
What's this?

863
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,700
Ladies and Gentlemen,

864
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,700
we're going to have to ask you
to exit right away from the theatre.

865
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,000
Please remain calm and
just walk straight out to the exit.

866
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,300
Please, do not run.

867
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,500
...and all the people
are evacuated...

868
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,700
There's no bomb. It's just
a bunch of religious fanatics.

869
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,000
<i>Everybody just calm down.</i>

870
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,400
The director's

871
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,600
<i>come in the theatre
and there is no bomb...</i>

872
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,700
<i>What's going on?</i>

873
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,100
Step out, step out.

874
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,800
Come on now.

875
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,900
Everybody just go on back
to your seats, there is no problem.

876
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,700
Just go back to your seats. What
are you doing, man? This is my movie.

877
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,000
Come on!
Everybody go back to your seats.

878
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,600
There's no bomb in here. It was a
false alarm. There's no bomb in here.

879
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,700
Get him out, get him out!

880
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,700
Alright. Good.
Didn't you hear the warning?

881
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,100
There's a bomb in the building.
That's right.

882
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,600
You don't want to be
the projectionist?

883
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,200
What's going on here?

884
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,400
Up here.

885
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,600
Keep searching. C'mon.

886
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,200
I'll show you a bomb.

887
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:06,300
-Hey, what's going on?
-Turn the lights on up there.

888
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,600
Put the light!

889
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,700
-Hey Tony. Come on out!
-There ain't no bomb!

890
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,500
Tony, you've got to leave
the building. Come on, man!

891
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,600
The only bomb is the one
that's in your fucking heart, man!

892
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,600
There ain't no bomb.

893
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,700
Who are they to decide?

894
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,800
How do they know
what's right and what's wrong?

895
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,900
The Pope in Rome?
He knows the truth?

896
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,900
What are they going to fucking
hotline to Rome, to God?

897
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:48,300
You don't let me play my movie, you
might as well take the constitution

898
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,300
and wipe your ass with it.

899
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,600
Yeah.

900
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,800
You hear that? We got lines
around the block at Philly.

901
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,600
<i>You are blessed,</i>

902
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,100
<i>for the sight of me
does not disturb you.</i>

903
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,300
<i>There where is the noose
lies the treasure.</i>

904
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,400
<i>Where do you come from, murderery?.</i>

905
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,300
<i>And where are you going, wanderery?.</i>

906
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,100
<i>-My craving has faded
-It's not what you see</i>

907
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,300
<i>-with your eyes.
-and I am freed from my ignorance.</i>

908
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,300
<i>-It's what you see with your heart.
-I lived the world</i>

909
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,700
<i>with the aid of another world.</i>

910
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,300
<i>A design was erased</i>

911
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,400
<i>by virtue of the Higher Design.</i>

912
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,800
<i>Henceforth, I travel toward repose,</i>

913
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:57,600
<i>where times rest
in the eternity of time.</i>

914
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,700
<i>I go now into silence.</i>

915
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,300
So why should I forgive you?

916
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,200
Well, I'm going to prove to you

917
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,600
that I'm different,
every day over the...

918
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,600
I'm going to show you
how much I love you. Every day.

919
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,100
Every moment you're going
to know how much I...

920
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,900
I fucked up, just fucked up.

921
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,700
You know...
