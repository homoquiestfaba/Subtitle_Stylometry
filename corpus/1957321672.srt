1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,920
Are you sure this is it?
That's what the paper said

2
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,520
AaaAahhh

3
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:58,035
Be safe Ben!

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,040
No promises mom

5
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
hey! hey what took you so long!?

6
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,840
Just crawled out of your cave? as soon as
i got your text! sounds about right.

7
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:41,680
So, where's your girl? shut up you know we're just
friends. still? come on man, i've been gone for three

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:50,400
months and you still are just "friends". Yeah, I guess.
Well is she coming? yeah she's just running a bit late

9
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,040
as usual. how was florida? ah mom wanted
to go see grandma while we still could

10
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600

then all of a sudden it just ♫beep beep♫

11
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Lexi! hey jack how was your summer? haven't heard much.
You know, wet, hot, depressing. not much to write

12
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,720
about. i see. so anything interesting happen while
i was gone? nothing interesting ever happens here.

13
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah i mean the park just got redone, you want Ben
and I to show you around? okay, take me away!

00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,840
Hello?

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,960
and then we went to the park! oh that's
nice of her, well tell her i said thanks.

19
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,800
I'll leave you to your business, i just

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Yeah, yeah, everything's everything's fine! all

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,759
Hey lexi! hey are you doing anything this weekend...

22
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,760
if you're free, maybe we could hang out? uh yeah,
yeah, that sounds great! great we can figure out

23
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:37,040
the details later. okay um that sounds good, i'll
uh i'll talk to you later okay? okay see ya! bye!

24
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,679
Are you all ready for your breakout
rooms? they're all randomly assigned...

25
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,320
and, uh they are open! feel free to head
on in and get started on your worksheet.

26
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,439
Oh hey jack! hey, do you have any idea what's
going on here? i do it's actually quite simple.

27
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,999
Who's that? elliott. elliott williams. do you all
have the worksheet open? hey elliot yeah i have

28
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,479
it. okay let's get started. are you guys any good
at this, i kind of suck? i believe i am, allow me

29
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:30,480
to do some mental calculations, oh yes here it is: three
pi over two. whoa! It's what i do, what can i say.

30
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,840
Damn! okay, what about
number two, can you do that?

31
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,679
Hey mute yourself. why are you calling me?
When i got home after hanging out with you

32
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,800
i found something-the clue. in the text i sent
you?!? oh yeah, i was too tired to look at that.

33
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,600
What was it? i don't know exactly, it looked like
the start of some sort of sketchy scavenger hunt,

34
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,879
and the photo is where the first clue led
me. it was insane, the lights flickered

35
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,639
off- and i'm sorry and you waited all
damn day to text me about it? where'd you

36
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,200
find the clue? it was just in one of the
spokes of my bike, just stuck in there.

37
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:22,959
I was just as confused as you are. and what's
that link you sent me? it was a website with a

38
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,560
weird minimalistic design, it had
gps coordinates listed on it.

39
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,840
I went to them, it was an abandoned mine-wait wait?
You went there? dude you're asking to get kidnapped,

40
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,360
come on! you wanna hear the best part? i told my
mom i was with Lexi! hey guys, you still there?

41
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,480
Uh yeah man you're doing great uh, looks good!
So are we gonna follow the second clue or what?

42
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,599
You were just calling it dumb a minute ago. well if
it was anything creepy like kidnapping, something bad

43
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,079
would have happened already. and, now that i know it's
safe, why not take part? well on sunday I have my

44
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,519
driving test, and on saturday lexi and i are hanging
out-hey we can do it another time, i don't want to

45
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,679
be a third wheel. Nah, it's fine. um we can all do
the scavenger hunt! it'll be like when we were kids.

46
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,840
Yeah as long as you don't piss yourself this time.
Shut up, all right we can talk about the clue later.

47
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:24,560
I don't want to make elliott here do all the "calculations".
All right, talk to you later loser. See ya!

48
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,040
Hiiii. hey i have an idea for
saturday! oh really what is it?

49
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
Hello! what the hell are you doing here?

50
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:50,240
I thought this would be a good friend group
bonding activity! yeah, thanks for inviting me.

51
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Alright, so the clue said "lake by the lines",
so obviously we have to go to a lake. what clue?

52
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,320
He hasn't told you yet?

53
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,079
The other day after we were
hanging out i found something

54
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:20,080
on the back of my bike. A little slip of paper.
I think it's start to a scavenger hunt or

55
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,840
something like that. ben can i
talk to you for a second? okay

56
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,879
why didn't you tell me about it earlier?
I thought it was just gonna be us.

57
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,639
I'm sorry, he really wanted to
come after i told him about it.

58
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,760
And i mean i couldn't just ditch him,
he's my best friend. i understand but

59
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,080
he doesn't have much going for him. yeah he
doesn't. look, i promise today will be worth it.

60
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,320
Whatever, i still want to have
fun with you today! i do too.

61
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Hey! ben and i did some research and there are
two lakes up here. It's gotta be one of them.

62
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,199
Well we assumed it was going to be within
a reasonable distance of where i found the

63
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,680
first clue. i mean, not to mention the
first clue said "lake by the lines" and

64
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,759
the power lines are just up here. i guess we'll just
have to hope at this point! well do we have a map

65
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,440
or anything? we're kind of in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah that's a good point, i don't want to get lost.

66
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,240
Let me just find these two points, mark them,
all right! we're good, let's go! how far?

67
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,280
It's not that bad, heh. what does that mean?
Yeah i didn't like the sound of that.

68
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,840
It's only uh, three,
three and a half miles.

69
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Three and a half miles?!? i'm getting winded! well
i think this is really fun, we're in the middle of

70
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,480
the woods, following some random clues set up by
some random person-okay would you guys just stop?!

71
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,320
You totally seemed on board with this at class
yesterday, so don't act like it was all my idea.

72
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,480
And you know what? If all goes accordingly,
we're going to a lake. it'll be cool.

73
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,840
Okay, let's do this!

74
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,100
♫Branch snaps♫

75
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,680
what are you doing? i don't know,

76
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,200
protecting myself? you know branches fall
right? or it could be a deer, right jack?

77
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Jack?

78
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,840
Calm down, I'm just taking a piss!

79
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,870
♫Jack screaming♫

80
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
i was peeing,

81
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,079
and there was a spider on my arm and it was like this
big! that's it, really? i thought there was like

82
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:52,080
a bear or something, a spider? much worse. listen, jack,
next time we're leaving you! you okay? i will be.

83
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:21,680
All right, well this is the closer lake. If whoever
made the clue is nice, this should be it. well it's

84
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:30,800
a lake. good job everyone! ♫clap clap♫ are you sure this
is it, i mean i don't know? well like i said there are two

85
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,120
lakes it could be the other one. can we just chill
out here for a bit, my legs are about to give out?

86
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,720
Even if this isn't it, it's nice.

87
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,960
Do you have any water? yeah help
yourself! oooh, what do we have here?

88
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,240
I thought i'd bring my camera in case there
was anything uh beautiful to take photos of.

89
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:07,516
Seeing anything?

90
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,920
Yeah, the lake's nice. oh my god haha.

91
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,800
The lake? really? well
yeah i just thought it was-

92
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,360
you are so-guys!

93
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,840
I think i see something.

94
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,840
That's it!

95
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,799
Why the hell is it up there? who knows why it's
up there, real question is how are we gonna get

96
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:16,800
it down? no no no no no no no no way don't even
think about it, all right, that's the stupidest

97
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
idea

98
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,840
ever

99
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,840
okay okay

100
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Ahhhh! ♫hits ground♫ Uhh, i'm okay. you know, it's
probably gonna lead to some gold, or some big prize.

101
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,199
I'm gonna be rich! all right, well guys,
first we have to focus on finding those

102
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,640
three points, all right? okay well i got the
clue so i think i should get a bigger cut.

103
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Yeah, sure. dude i climbed the
tree! i fell out of the tree!

104
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Ugh

105
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:30,240
ugh

106
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,697
come on, pick up pick up!

107
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:46,698
♫Phone ringing♫

108
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,840
hello? hey! why are you calling me
so damn late? jack it's the morning.

109
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,359
Same difference, what do you want? The clue from the
hike, i think i have a hint. i thought they were

110
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,640
just some random coordinates. i know, that's
what i thought but um, they updated the website.

111
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,279
There's a new word on it-i think it's
a hint to help us. what does it say?

112
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,600
Oh that's the thing, i think it's in
a different language or something.

113
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,840
Well i got 'em plotted.

114
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,120
Yep, well there's three of them,
so at least we know that much.

115
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,960
We got the three plotted but, we're still no
closer to figuring out what the hell this means.

116
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,480
You ever been to yakima?

117
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,360
Jack, we're trying to figure
out what it means. "Yakimmaaa".

118
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,720
I mean there's got to be someone
we know who can figure this out.

119
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:15,360
Don't look at me i failed
spanish and chinese... twice! wait,

120
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:25,920
i think we know a guy who can figure it out. no, no,
come on, no, come-no, not him! so in order to get the

121
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,679
secant, we just need to put the hypotenuse over the
adjacent side-hey, um actually can you help me with

122
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:38,799
something? of course what is it? also, where's our
companion jack? oh, good question because i have

123
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:46,319
uh absolutely no clue where he is. um, i don't know
if you're able to solve this problem or if you'd

124
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:53,360
want to, um but-let me have it! all right i have three
coordinate points. what would you like me to calculate?

125
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:02,559
Well that's just it, i am not quite sure. i was
given a hint but i couldn't read it. of course

126
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:10,560
you couldn't. uh please include the message. "egpvgt" i
guess that code talking summer camp was an educational

127
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,280
experience. uh this could be using the caesar shift
code method. it's the most common and well-known.

128
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,439
I could decode this manually, but it would take
hours. well is there any way that you could-

129
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,720
but i can do this with a computer decoder. allow
me to search this up. it's loading... hold on.

130
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,320
Okay, uh the top decode is "center". none
of the other words are in english at least.

131
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:47,680
"center". so it would be the center of the
points? could be, however there are many

132
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,079
definitions of center in math. what are these
numbers for exactly? they're gps coordinates.

133
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,720
Ah i see. i would assume this center would
be the same distance from each point-

134
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,280
the circumcenter. that makes the most
sense in terms of geographical navigation.

135
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Yes, the "circum-center". uh how long is that
gonna take to find? a few minutes at most. all

136
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,880
right thank you! just let me know when you're-done!
What? i'm finished! i just used an online calculator.

137
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:30,960
All right, thank you. now let's get back to the
lesson. hey! what's up loser? i got the coordinates.

138
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,719
Nice! yeah elliott gave them to me during class.
It's behind school. i told you he'd be of some

139
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,840
help. yeah, i do feel kind of bad though, you know.
Taking advantage of him during class. Hehehe

140
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,240
but uh, speaking of class, where were
you today? oh, um, didn't feel like going

141
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,640
"fun guy exclamation three
two four six" ♫bleep♫

142
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,680
oh, okay. ready to go? i can't.
I have to watch my sister.

143

We have to go down the ravine.

149
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,239
Really? you know at the end
of this i'm hoping that this

150
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:04,240
clue turns into something
more than just a piece of paper.

151
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,520
What the hell is that smell?

deer and we ran and he's gone! did you
try looking for him? of course i looked for

164
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,039
him! ever since these clues showed up it's all
you care about. you forgot about our date,

165
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,640
our friend's missing, or dead. did you even stop
to consider what they are where they came from?

166
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Lexi, i'm i'm so sorry okay? but jack is missing
and i just thought i was so close to-to what?

167
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,879
Getting kidnapped? have you even stopped to
consider the danger we might be in, because it

168
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,840
seems like all you care about are those stupid
pieces of paper? That's not fair i-forget it ben.

169
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:08,720
Whatever stupid little adventure you have going on, i'm

174
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
Lexi called me.

175
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:09,840
Lexi. she said we're done. apparently
i missed a date or something stupid.

176
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,920
Don't worry, things
will be okay in the end.

Jack?!? what's wrong ben?

188

What are you? a twisted
reflection of your greed.

189
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,640
And even still, you're chasing
ghosts. you, you're the one behind this!

But why?

are you here? knowing you, there was danger.

193
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:18,240

203
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,680
all right let's get started. so these clues
you were following, describe them. I, um,

204
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,640
one day they just started showing up and
there was just something so intriguing,

205
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,720
something was pulling me to them!
I just got so obsessed that i-

206
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:18,720
you what Ben? i didn't want anyone
to get hurt, you believe me right?

207
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,040
It was like a mine, i don't
know how to describe it.

208
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,879
You said there was a man who was attacking your
friend. no, no, not a man. i thought it was my friend

209
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,200
but whatever that thing was, it wasn't human.
So why do you think your friend kidnapped you.

210
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,920
Jack? no no, it wasn't him, okay? It
looked like him, but it wasn't him!

211
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,560
Ben! your friend, do you know
where he could have gone?

212
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,799
He's still there. we haven't recovered
him, do you know why he ended up in that

213
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,800
location? That thing. i'm sorry? it looked like him,
and it walked like him, but it wasn't him, okay?!

214
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That's the only way it could have happened. it
took him. i'm sorry, i'm sorry. could you please

215
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,840
describe this figure you saw? I didn't
even really get a good look at it, i mean

216
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,720
it all happened so fast. it was dark and eerie,
and when it looked at me i suddenly felt cold.

217
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,840
It wasn't alive. whatever that
thing was it wasn't alive!

218
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,160
Can i see him now please? please?

219
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:01,600
Look i don't care if you don't believe me okay!
Just please! you have to go to the mine.

220
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,880
You have to see for yourself!
What's in there ben?

221
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:15,367
I know what's up there, and
I'd give anything to forget it.
