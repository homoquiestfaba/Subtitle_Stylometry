00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,783
Kiss me.

3
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,382
You been keeping
your mouth shut, right?

4
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,925
Yeah.

5
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,470
Didn't I tell you
to throw that shit out?

6
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:45,939
Listen. I'm a private person.
What we do is between me and you.

7
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:51,153
-You still want this loving, right?
-I understand. Come on.

8
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,701
Yo, Vic! Yo, Vic!

9
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,872
-Yo, Vic, I know you in there.
-Motherfucker.

10
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:06,502
-Yo, Victor, come down here!
-No can, motherfucker--

11
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,963
-Yo, son!
-I'm gonna fucking kill him.

12
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,175
-Yo, Victor.
-Harold, shut the fuck up!

13
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,344
Harold, shut the fuck up, man!

14
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,847
Yo, what the fuck
you doing over there?

15
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,600
Yo, you're in the wrong floor.

16
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,102
Oh, my God.
Are you up there with Donna?

17
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,064
Are you fucking her?

18
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,566
Fuck!

19
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,610
Oh, my God.

20
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,029
Oh, my God!

21
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,745
Hello. Is Sabrina there?

22
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,172
Come here.

23
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:07,563
Oh, my God. You don't know what
I found out. My brother, he was--

24
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,190
-What the hell are you doing?
-Vicki, promise you won't tell.

25
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,942
I'm not promising shit.

26
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,904
I'm gonna tell everybody that you
were with Fat Donna, that ugly bitch!

27
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,406
-Yeah?
-Yes.

28
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,950
-You ain't talking to nobody.
-How you gonna stop me?

29
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,453
-That's it.
-Give me the phone.

30
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,581
-I'll throw it out.
-I ain't playing.

31
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,584
-I'll throw it out.
-Fuck it. Throw it out the window.

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,086
-Promise!
-You'll get in trouble, stupid.

33
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,589
-You think I won't do it?
-Go ahead. Throw it.

34
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,924
-Go!
-Kiss this shit goodbye.

35
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,435
You're so stupid.
How can you live with yourself?

36
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,271
Fuck.

37
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,107
Oh, shit! Yo, son, you fucking
that fat bitch Donna?

38
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,735
Shut up, Harold.
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,738
-I seen your head out that window.
-You didn't see my head.

40
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,073
I can spot your fro
from anywhere, nigga.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,452
-Where the fuck are your glasses at?
-Yo, you don't got them?

42
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,329
Shut the--
Yo, what's my name, son?

43
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,706
-Victor, nigga.
-Why you trying to play me?

44
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,958
You saw me bag how many bitches.
They dimes.

45
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,460
-No doubt.
-You know that.

46
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,213
-What kind of bitches I bag, son?
-Come on, nigga.

47
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,673
-Dimes, man.
-I don't know, son.

48
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,968
I don't know.
I don't know, nigga.

49
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,934
-"Hello?"
-Hello, Sabrina.

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,020
-Yeah, where was I?
-"What happened?"

51
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:06,306
See the short one?
He's fucking Fat Donna Santiago.

52
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,183
Are you serious?

53
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,937
-Oh, my God. Poor girl.
-Poor girl?

54
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,690
Have you seen that girl?

55
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,654
You're so bad.

56
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,616
You stop it.

57
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,453
What you waiting for, playboy?

58
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,499
Waiting for the right moment.
Waiting for the right time, man.

59
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,086
We'll definitely get in this.

60
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,672
Your dick ain't getting any bigger, yo.
Just go!

61
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,382
That's why I don't fuck with you.

62
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:44,094
You talk so fucking loud,
you have no class, man. Damn!

63
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,472
Learn a thing or two.
When you wait, shit will come to you.

64
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,808
I think you're scared.

65
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,686
Get out of here, man.
Get the fuck out.

66
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,231
I heard you're fucking
that fat bitch Donna.

67
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,442
-Oh, shit!
-Get out of here. Who told you?

68
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,236
-Yo, who told you that, man?
-Everybody knows.

69
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,448
Yo, Harold. Let's go right now.
Fuck that. Come on.

70
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,992
Yo, you think you even
got a chance with her?

71
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,160
Shut up, man.

72
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,330
Is he coming this way?

73
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,165
I think so.

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,093
-Why am I here again?
-Why?

75
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,596
Because people piss and shit
in Avenue D pool.

76
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,098
-I don't like going to pools.
-Why did you come?

77
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,726
-Because you dragged me here.
-I dragged you?

78
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,686
-You did.
-I didn't drag you.

79
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,109
Yo, how you ladies doing?

80
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,321
My name is Vic.
This is my associate, Harold.

81
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,951
Enjoying the day?
Nice day in the pool.

82
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,412
Me and my man wanna know
if you wanna double-date one day.

83
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,582
Vic. She has a boyfriend.

84
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,004
Anyway, listen, what's your name?

85
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,966
You're gonna ignore me now?

86
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,718
Me and my man just want to know
if you wanna chill one day.

87
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,387
You can bring your friend.

88
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,472
-Vic?
-Yes.

89
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,934
Do you see the wall of isolation?

90
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,812
You're getting annoying.
I'm trying to talk to her.

91
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,150
-Are you deaf? I have a man.
-I heard. I definitely heard.

92
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:26,488
Let me tell you something. You ain't
been with a man till you been with me.

93
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,533
See? Got you smiling, though.

94
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,535
Where we going?

95
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,876
-What are you doing?
-Look at that.

96
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,503
What, my reflection?

97
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,798
Does that look like God's gift
to women?

98
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,551
I don't think so.

99
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,138
Oh, shit, son.

100
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,975
-That girl got a negative attitude, man.
-Who, Judy? Nah, yo.

101
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,562
-You saw how nice I came up to her?
-Maybe it's not her. Maybe it's you.

102
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,230
You crazy?

103
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,400
Maybe you lost your magic.
You lost your magic. That's it.

104
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,611
Look at this kid.
I bet you it's not even me.

105
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,945
-Look at this kid.
-Who?

106
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,864
He's about to approach her.
See him?

107
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,700
Oh, all right.

108
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,411
-Oh, yeah.
-Look what she does to him.

109
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,083
Oh, shit! Oh, you seen that?

110
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,544
You saw that? Did you?
You saw that?

111
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,714
-Did you? Did you see that?
-She probably knows him, yo.

112
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,886
-Yo, that kid's half your age.
-She probably knows him.

113
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,346
Yeah, right.

114
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,933
You remember what you told me, yo?
Remember what you told me?

115
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,061
''I'm Victor. I'm Victor.
I'm Victor. I'm Victor.

116
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,022
I get all the hottest bitches out here.
What's my name?

117
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,734
I'm Victor.'' Remember that?
''What's my name? Victor, Victor.''

118
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,111
Fuck you, fuck you.

119
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,905
Fuck you.

120
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,118
It's all right, son.
At least you have Fat Donna, son.

121
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,380
I can't take one step without them
crawling up my ass today.

122
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,091
-Think they figured it out?
-That your boyfriend's bullshit?

123
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,260
They're gonna hear you.

124
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,180
You're not in the worst position.
Those guys were not that bad.

125
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,516
-Did the sun fry your brain?
-No.

126
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:21,186
Which one of y'all wanna get
fucked in the doody hole? You?

127
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:25,023
If either one of us gets with a guy
like that, I'm gonna shoot myself.

128
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,150
Well, I'll shoot myself too.

129
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,570
I'll fuck you so hard
your aunt is gonna feel it.

130
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,463
Wait, wait.

131
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,632
You're a lizard.

132
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,468
I'm a baby bird.

133
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,555
Yeah, I see it.

134
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,266
It's pretty good, right?

135
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:03,145
Okay. Check this out. Who's this?

136
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,865
The guy from the pool, right?

137
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,704
-Isn't that funny?
-Least guys like you, you know?

138
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,833
-So what?
-It's not like that for all of us.

139
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,168
You're the lucky one.

140
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,671
You don't have to walk down the street
and be hassled.

141
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:35,969
Guys are dogs.
We don't need that, right?

142
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,222
Right.

143
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,071
Grandma, I told you, it wasn't me.
It was Victor.

144
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,532
Who dropped the phone
out of the window?

145
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,410
Please tell me the truth. It's easy
for you and for me. Who did that?

146
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,621
It was Victor.
It was Victor, Victor, Victor.

147
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,123
-Well, I believe you. You sure?
-I'm positive.

148
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,377
I don't want problems with Victor.

149
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,046
Ma, she told you she threw it?

150
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,382
-She told you?
-Don't even come with that--

151
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,008
Why you pointing at me for?

152
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,052
Oh, my God.
Why you be hitting me?

153
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,428
-Shut up.
-Just say it.

154
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,557
Who drop the phone out
of the window? I want to know who.

155
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,183
-It was her!
-It wasn't me!

156
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,227
She threw it out the window.
She's crazy.

157
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,855
I'm gonna find out.
Nino, come here to Grandma.

158
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,775
Come here, baby.
Come to Mama. Say the truth.

159
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,694
Who dropped the phone
out the window?

160
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,779
Nino, it was Vicki, right?

161
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,615
No! Look, Grandma.
He's doing like that to his eye--

162
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,451
-You don't know nothing?
-I don't know. I didn't see.

163
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,370
-Nino, right?
-No. I didn't see it.

164
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,540
-It was Victor. Oh, my God.
-Why you lie for?

165
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,084
-What the hell--?
-Sit down. She's talking.

166
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,921
Oh, my God.
What kind of kids are you?

167
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,928
Beginning now, is no more phone
in this house. No more!

168
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:04,725
I'm gonna lock it up right now.
I'm gonna put a lock on this phone.

169
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:10,105
Only gonna be phone in the house
for some emergency. That's it. Period.

170
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,566
What if there's an emergency
and you're not home?

171
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,776
The emergencies are gonna be
when I be home.

172
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,279
Grandma, no. That's--
You're very unfair.

173
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,115
If he's the one throwing phones
out the window, I'm--

174
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,326
-What is that?
-Shut up, liar!

175
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,371
-Shut up. I ain't talking to you.
-What is that? Give me the phone.

176
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,957
-Take it. Take it. Take it, Ma.
-Listen.

177
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,794
Just promise me to be a good
family. Do you agree with me?

178
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,755
-Whatever.
-Are we a good family again?

179
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,508
-Yeah, yeah, Grandma.
-You do, honey?

180
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,470
Nino, I know you're a good kid.
You're my baby.

181
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,015
I don't ask the question to you.
How about you, Victor?

182
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,353
Do you promise me to be
a family again? Look at me.

183
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:53,023
Answer with your eyes,
not with the head.

184
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,359
Promise something to Grandma.

185
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:59,321
Be good, and then the rest
is gonna be good too.

186
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:04,576
Supposed to be example
for the family. Okay?

187
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:12,037
How nice. I love it.
That was beautiful.

188
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,122
Did you like it?

189
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,917
You do? How about you?

190
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:21,922
He always try to make
the family happy. Always.

191
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:27,803
Promise me you're gonna be here
to play the piano for Grandma.

192
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,972
-Always.
-I promise.

193
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,599
Thank you. I love you.

194
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,117
So, Victor, how was your day?

195
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,327
Don't push it.
What you did wasn't funny.

196
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,580
Funny. Do you wanna
talk about funny?

197
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:58,917
Was it funny when you pissed
on my shoes or tried to cut my hair?

198
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,504
You know what? It don't matter,
because by the end of this week...

199
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,675
...you won't be able to step a foot
outside without somebody laughing.

200
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:11,221
You'll always be known as Fat
Donna's man, and that will be funny.

201
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,452
Yo, what the fuck you doing, man?

202
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,746
Oh, my God.
Can't you pass the ball?

203
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,665
Yo, little man! Yo!

204
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,084
Over here. Over here.

205
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,381
Yo.

206
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,385
You. Can I talk to you
for a minute?

207
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,347
-I'm trying to play a game here.
-Let me talk to you.

208
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,140
Let me ask you a question.

209
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,851
I saw you kissing
on Juicy Judy yesterday.

210
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,939
And I wanted to ask-- Yo, nice work.
What I'm saying, what's your secret?

211
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,734
She's my sister, you asshole.

212
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,030
My fault. I'm sorry
I called your sister ''juicy.''

213
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,407
-But I'm saying-- What's your name?
-Carlos.

214
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,535
You look like a dude
I could talk to.

215
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,746
I could ask favors for because
we're here, man. You know?

216
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,748
Yo, can you do me a big favor?

217
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,876
Let me guess. You want me
to hook you up with my sister.

218
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,753
You didn't even let me talk.
Can I talk?

219
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:28,382
What if a person came up to you
wanting to go out with your sister?

220
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,427
My sister Vicki is ugly and fat.
Nobody ain't gonna like her.

221
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,721
-Vicki what?
-What do you mean, Vicki what?

222
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,598
-Her last name?
-Vicki De La Cruz.

223
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:41,645
That's her last name. My last name's
Vargas. You like that one? It's better?

224
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,276
What? Are you crazy?
Do you know my sister?

225
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,863
She's fucking retarded and fat
and ugly. She's like Lucifer, man--

226
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,074
Carlos, you gonna play or what?

227
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,994
All right. Fine, fine, fine.
I'll hook you up.

228
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,454
Meet me at Tompkins tomorrow.
We'll be there.

229
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:03,292
At the--? No. No park, man.
Yo, I'm a private person.

230
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,295
I like to keep shit,
you know, on the low.

231
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,922
You wanna go now?

232
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,633
All right. Come on.

233
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,650
Look at this bitch right here.

234
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:32,446
Check this out. I'm a producer.
Know what I'm saying?

235
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,281
This is my star, Double Penetration.

236
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,534
I will lay the pipe game down hard.
I will fuck you in your ass.

237
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,329
-My dick ain't all that big--
-Let me go!

238
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,664
-Fuck off!
-Fucking bitch.

239
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,468
I wanted to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

240
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,553
Wait, wait.
I came to apologize...

241
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,640
...for yesterday, when me and Harold
were acting up in the pool.

242
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,558
There was no need for that.

243
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,977
I thought that was really fucked up...

244
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,563
...so I took it upon myself
to ask your brother...

245
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,360
...to introduce us properly because
we start off on the wrong foot.

246
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,198
Cool?

247
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,368
My name is Victor Vargas.

248
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,756
Damn. That's what you do
when people apologize?

249
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:38,053
-What do you want?
-Can you at least accept my apology?

250
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:43,559
-Okay. Apology accepted. Happy?
-Yeah.

251
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,606
Now what?

252
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:53,235
I mean, we cool, right?
New beginning?

253
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,446
Why was you acting
like an asshole at the pool?

254
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:02,744
I guess you wouldn't know how it feels
to get nervous around certain people.

255
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,045
Listen, if you're not busy, you wanna
take a walk or talk or whatever?

256
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,884
I'll see you later, son.
I'm gonna call you tonight.

257
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,305
What up?

258
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,640
What up, son?

259
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,166
This is it. This is where
all the Victor love happens.

260
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,752
What love?

261
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:56,298
-Damn, it's hot. You not hot?
-Yeah.

262
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:59,176
I got a fan in my room.
Wanna go to my room and chill?

263
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,887
No, I'm not that hot.

264
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,141
You at least thirsty?
You want something to drink?

265
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,311
-Yeah, that'd be nice.
-All right.

266
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:20,322
-I didn't ask for a beer.
-Sorry, it's all I got.

267
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:23,033
Yeah, right.

268
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,372
Thank you.

269
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,749
Who are they?

270
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,543
My grandmother.

271
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,629
"Papi chulo" right there,
that's me, of course.

272
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,465
That's my sister, but she's fat now.

273
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:42,135
That's my brother.
That's my father and my mother.

274
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,805
My sister's father,
we don't know where he's at...

275
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,891
...so we don't have a picture
of him, but fuck her.

276
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,061
Well, she's better off that way.

277
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,693
Who's that?

278
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,321
You can't tell?
The good looks run in the family.

279
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,866
That's my grandfather.

280
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,994
You don't even look like him.

281
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,704
Why you trying to play me for?

282
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,207
Of course I don't look like him
right now, because I'm not posing.

283
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,544
Well, can you pose for me, then?

284
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,765
-Right?
-No.

285
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,985
Where's your brother?

286
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,239
I don't know.

287
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,245
Vicki, do you know where Victor's at?

288
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,915
Does it look like I care?

289
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:59,087
Why you so far away for?

290
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,465
I'm fine here.

291
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:06,637
Yeah, you wanna see something?

292
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,229
This shit's hot, right?

293
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:20,317
-What is it?
-For privacy, girl.

294
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,819
Do you need me to leave?

295
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:26,990
It's for me and you.
Come here.

296
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,003
What's that?

297
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,092
You wanna know?

298
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,597
It means, ''I love Judy.''

299
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,688
All right.

300
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,190
Look, you're my new man.

301
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,944
But I'm warning you,
don't fuck with me.

302
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,823
Go ahead, tell your little friends.

303
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:15,831
Judy Gonzalez?!

304
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,208
-Was there any doubt?
-You the fucking man.

305
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,043
-I don't know what to say.
-Congrats.

306
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,297
-No doubt. Was there any doubt, son?
-No.

307
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,465
Ain't no doubt about that, baby.

308
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:28,969
Ever since I seen you in the pool...

309
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:32,181
Ever since I seen you in the pool...

310
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:36,018
...I can't stop--
I don't eat. I don't sleep.

311
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,816
Just give me a chance.
I can't stop thinking about you.

312
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,068
What do you think this is,
some "Romeo and Juliet" shit?

313
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,905
Think you can come up here
and sweep me off my feet?

314
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,949
Why you got an attitude for?

315
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,035
-I don't have an attitude.
-You have your attitude.

316
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:56,246
-You have an attitude just like Judy.
-No.

317
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,541
So you hate all guys
in general, right?

318
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,544
-Why do you think I hate guys?
-You're always with Judy.

319
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,922
Maybe I'm not like Judy.

320
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,344
You know you look like Julia Roberts?

321
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,554
You know that?
You got a beautiful smile.

322
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:13,931
Thank you.

323
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,892
-Take off your glasses.
-What do you think this is?

324
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,687
Do you think I'm gonna take off
anything you tell me to take off?

325
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:23,857
No, but I would like to see you
with your glasses off.

326
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,902
-No.
-You're prettier with your glasses off.

327
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:29,196
-You never even seen--
-What? I don't bite.

328
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:33,575
All right. So if you take off your
glasses, then I'll take off my glasses.

329
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,702
I don't know.

330
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,872
I don't know.

331
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,917
All right, all right.
All right. On three?

332
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,335
All right.

333
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:44,753
-You ready?
-All right.

334
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,630
One...

335
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,716
...two....

336
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,886
Put your hands
where your glasses are.

337
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,763
Go.

338
00:25:56,849 --> 00:26:00,352
-All right, you got my glasses off.
-Now get your hair down.

339
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,522
What are you trying to do?
Do you think I'm stupid?

340
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:07,526
Do you think I'm gonna
take my hair down for you?

341
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,236
I don't think you're stupid.

342
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,196
Come here.
Why are you pushing me?

343
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,782
-Come on.
-If I take down my hair, will you go?

344
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:17,703
Right. Yeah. I promise. Now,
I promise, I promise, I promise.

345
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,916
I promise. I promise, I promise,
I promise, I promise, I promise.

346
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,305
Put it to the front a little.

347
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,476
Wow. You know you're mad pretty?

348
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,604
Thank you.

349
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,397
-So I'm gonna go now.
-Okay.

350
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:47,149
Before your parents wake up.

351
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:50,527
Before I go, can I get
a kiss on the cheek?

352
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:55,073
Just one little kiss right there.
Please. I promise I'll leave.

353
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,535
-I'm leaving. Please.
-All right.

354
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,708
-You like that? You like that?
-No.

355
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,127
-I think you did.
-No, I didn't.

356
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,630
I'm gonna go, all right?
I'll see you tomorrow?

357
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,049
-No.
-Have a good night.

358
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:23,685
-Yo, where's Mommy?
-She's with Vicki in confession.

359
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,691
Yo, take off my shirt, bro.
What the hell's wrong with you?

360
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,362
You like that shit, right?
Guess whose lips are those?

361
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,656
-Who?
-Guess.

362
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,742
-Who, man?
-Juicy Judy.

363
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,746
-Judy Gonzalez? She was here?
-Yo. Not only that, she's my girl.

364
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,082
You like that shit?
Go wash that shit.

365
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,251
-Listen, listen, listen.
-What?

366
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,045
-What, what?
-I just--

367
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:53,465
-I need help.
-What are you talking about?

368
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,718
-Like with girls.
-What?

369
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,804
Church boy wanna know
about girls? Mommy's boy?

370
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,139
-Get the fuck out--
-I'm serious. Please.

371
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,558
You're dropping
this shit on me. No.

372
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,852
Please.

373
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:10,566
All right, fine. Now, come here.
Let me talk to you. First of all...

374
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:13,443
...I don't even know what to tell you.
It's like an instinct.

375
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,904
It runs in our blood.
In the "sangre".

376
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,740
Look at Papi, how many wives
he have? Like four or five.

377
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,367
How many half-brothers
we have? A lot.

378
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:23,078
See what I'm saying?
He's a player, man.

379
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,748
Now, look.
I'll put you out on one thing.

380
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,251
Lick your fucking
chappy-ass lips, man.

381
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,378
Think girls will talk to you
if you have chappy lips?

382
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,505
They look like dried-up raisins.

383
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,592
What are you doing?
Not like that. Like this:

384
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,181
Do it. Do it.

385
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,892
Because you know why?
When girls talk to you...

386
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,227
...they don't look at your eyes,
they look at your lips.

387
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,105
You didn't know that, right?
Turn away right now.

388
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,109
You didn't know I was looking
at your lips. Do it again.

389
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,570
Bang. You see.

390
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,947
Keep on doing it
because girls always look--

391
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,241
You're not licking them. You wanna
be a "papi chulo" or "papi ferro"?

392
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,994
-"Papi chulo."
-All right. Keep practicing.

393
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,872
Oh, wait. One more thing
I got to ask you.

394
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,583
What? What?

395
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,545
Did--? Do you--?
Like, did you ever, you know--?

396
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:15,923
What?

397
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:19,468
What the fuck are you doing?
What?

398
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,470
-You jerking off?
-No! It's a question.

399
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,431
-Go wash you hands, man!
-No, I'm asking you...

400
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,808
-...see if you did it.
-Hell, no!

401
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,186
Just a question.

402
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:33,398
Look. After I'm done, you ain't gonna
be Mommy's little church boy.

403
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,609
You're gonna be like me.
Don't worry, bro.

404
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:39,780
You're gonna be picking girls
like lottery numbers. All right?

405
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:45,369
You never expect that I listen
to the conversation. It's very nice.

406
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:48,956
You're teaching your brother,
the baby of the house, to be like you.

407
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:52,000
Now you remind me
of your grandpa, my husband.

408
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:54,795
-What are you talking about?
-He was the first gigolo.

409
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:57,881
You're the second one.
You're gonna make him the third!

410
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:01,343
-No, he's not, Ma.
-Don't defense him!

411
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,388
-Ma, he's not bad.
-I was just talking to him.

412
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:06,974
-We're just talking.
-Go to your room!

413
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,060
Please, go to your room.

414
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:14,731
Now, an explanation.
Where you been?

415
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,025
Give me some explanation
where you were.

416
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:20,237
You don't show in church.
Where you been?

417
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,780
Explain to me where you was!

418
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,199
If you ask me nicely,
maybe I'll tell you.

419
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,410
I'm sick and tired with this!

420
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,454
You gotta remember something:
Only thing you have is me.

421
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,708
Keep that in you mind.
Right here in your mind.

422
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:44,052
Vicki, you heard? Judy was here.
Judy Gonzalez.

423
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:46,513
Victor's such a fucking
compulsive liar.

424
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,766
Yo, Vicki, why you gotta hate for?
Why you so jealous?

425
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,227
Shut up and go back
into your fucking tent.

426
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:55,480
But I got evidence. Right, son?
That she was here. See?

427
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,399
Nino, you're such
an airhead too.

428
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,610
-Yo, you a hater.
-Yeah.

429
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:03,322
But what happened? All the people
gonna be talking shit about me?

430
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:06,450
I can't walk down the street?
What happened?

431
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:08,744
-Whatever.
-You know what your problem is?

432
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:12,623
You're always on the couch. You're
gonna die on that fucking couch.

433
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,084
Ain't nobody gonna want you.
You're gonna be all fucking wrinkled.

434
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:20,714
Nobody gonna marry you. When are
you gonna get your own life?

435
00:31:56,583 --> 00:32:00,295
Yo, Victor! Yo, Victor!

436
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:03,423
Get the fuck off me.
What the hell?

437
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:13,267
-Yo--
-What a fucking idiot you are.

438
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,274
-You owe me.
-Yo, shut the fuck up!

439
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,235
She's right there, man.
What the hell you doing?

440
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:26,071
What's wrong with you,
knocking on my door so early?

441
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,447
So it's too early?

442
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,533
Can't you see I'm still
wearing my robe?

443
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,410
Sorry.

444
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,581
-Where's your sister at?
-Oh, man.

445
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:38,959
Tell me where your sister's at,
or you ain't gonna meet Godzilla.

446
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,059
Don't slam my door.

447
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,358
Yo, Vicki-- Come on,
come on, come on, man.

448
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:07,487
This here's my man Carlos.
Carlos, this is my sister Vicki, man.

449
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,575
Sit down, man.

450
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:15,120
I'm gonna go take a shower, man.
Wait right here, all right?

451
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,873
-You can see from there, man?
-Yeah.

452
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,459
You sure? There's a better
view from right there.

453
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,669
All right? Be good.

454
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,882
Hi.

455
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,429
You want to talk
about something?

456
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,640
No.

457
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,487
I don't feel too good.

458
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,745
Oh, my God!
You're so nasty!

459
00:33:56,912 --> 00:34:00,123
Damn, yo! It had to be
one of Victor's fucking friends.

460
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:05,087
Judy, where were
you yesterday?

461
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,972
-Hello?
-I was taking care of some business.

462
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:18,308
What business?
I was waiting forever for you.

463
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,937
I went home with a guy.

464
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,025
-Shut up.
-I'm not lying.

465
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,326
Him? Him, Judy?

466
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:40,622
It's not even a relationship. I needed
to find a way to get them off my back.

467
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:43,500
You know he's gonna think
you guys are really together.

468
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,461
Look, just think of him
as bug spray.

469
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,013
What's up, ladies?

470
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:00,475
What's up, baby?
How you all doing?

471
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,937
Where we going?
We always going somewhere.

472
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,523
Hello?

473
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:11,195
Okay. Let me tell you something
about me. I like my space.

474
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,655
You can't be showing up like that.

475
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:18,118
I'm sorry, I'm saying, I mean,
I don't have your number so....

476
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:21,663
If I would've had your number,
this could've been avoided.

477
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,665
So can I have your number?

478
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,335
No, I'm not allowed give it out.
Can I have your number?

479
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,337
My phone broke.

480
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:31,173
Yo, how about this?

481
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:33,509
-How about we just plan ahead?
-Okay.

482
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:35,511
Next time we just meet
at my house.

483
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,805
No. Let's meet in public.

484
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:44,561
All right. So we just
take things slow.

485
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:47,022
Whatever you want.
You call the shots.

486
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,857
-Cool.
-Very cool.

487
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:13,215
Here, here. Come here.

488
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:17,511
Whoa, it's like
a "familia" here, man.

489
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:20,472
It is a "familia".
Here's Big Mama right here.

490
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:23,851
Gotta grab her gently.

491
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,562
-Stay right there.
-Say hi.

492
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,940
See? What?

493
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,319
All right. Close your eyes,
close your eyes.

494
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,572
Close them.
Trust me, trust me.

495
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,658
Trust me, please?
Please trust me.

496
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,619
I will not do anything stupid.

497
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:45,163
Close them, please?

498
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,920
All right, I'm gonna close them.
Tell them to stay away.

499
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,884
-All right, close them.
-Okay.

500
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,354
All right. Open them.
Open them.

501
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,858
Okay. It's small. It's a baby.

502
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:29,041
You're gonna at least let me
walk you home, right?

503
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:36,632
-I found a quarter.
-I could do my laundry with that.

504
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,384
Sure. Come here, come here.

505
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:44,848
All right. So which one you want?
Pink, red, orange?

506
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:49,645
-I'm okay.
-For real. Which one you want?

507
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,235
What, these tough dudes
right here?

508
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,001
He's in a wheelchair.

509
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,171
No, no, no. This is the better
one right here, yo.

510
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:19,091
Look, look, look.
This is the dude on wheels.

511
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:21,301
You didn't hear
about that, right?

512
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,180
I think I should go.

513
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,058
We're gonna chill though,
later, right?

514
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:31,728
Thank you.

515
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:37,484
I'm gonna see you later, right?

516
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:39,903
Right?

517
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:14,521
Hello? Grandma is home.

518
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:20,235
I'm gonna cook good food.
Hamburger tonight, for my babies.

519
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:24,072
With so much food, we're gonna
make hamburger tonight.

520
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,908
Oh, fuck.

521
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:36,043
Ma! What the fuck, Ma? You just
hit me with the door right now!

522
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:41,215
How did I know that you'd be outside?
It's not my fault. Don't blame me, now!

523
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:44,635
Ma, I'm gonna have
a ching-chung now, Ma.

524
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,347
It's not my fault. I'm sorry.
Anyway, where's your brother?

525
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:52,267
I don't care. I don't know where they
are, Ma. Can you get me some ice?

526
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,439
-Carlos, stop following me!
-Thanks for spending the day with me.

527
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:00,400
I didn't spend the day with you.
You vomited on my floor...

528
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,486
...and I took you out
for fresh air.

529
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,906
My door's open.

530
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,585
-Who is this guy?
-Grandma, this is Carlos.

531
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:20,921
I'm Victor's friend.

532
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:25,801
-Can you walk me out?
-You're already out, stupid.

533
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,136
-I'll call you.
-I'm not allowed.

534
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,973
I'll let it ring twice,
then you meet me downstairs.

535
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,724
Whatever.

536
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:41,650
Victor, what is going on in this house?
Who is this guy outside the door?

537
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:44,528
Tell him to stop introducing me
to his stupid friends.

538
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:49,324
Why you introduce men to your sister?
Don't do that anymore.

539
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,661
Where's your brother?
Where's Nino?

540
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:54,746
I'm gonna cook your favorite food.

541
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,499
But we don't want to eat
by the time he's come home.

542
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,293
Ma, he's right there.

543
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,253
-Where you was?
-In the bathroom.

544
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,756
Why you don't answer me
in the beginning, when I call you first?

545
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:08,051
Because I was in the bathroom.

546
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,513
Oh, God.

547
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,644
Please?

548
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,857
Please, please.

549
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,539
See, that's why you need to leave.

550
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:40,709
Because you touch people
and you think that it's okay.

551
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,378
-I touch people?
-You touch me without my permission.

552
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:46,715
-Why you trying to act so bossy now?
-Because you're my bitch.

553
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:49,468
-I'm your what?
-You're my bitch.

554
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,055
-I'm your what?
-You're my bitch.

555
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,724
-Excuse me.
-I said, you're my bitch.

556
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,644
-Don't push me.
-I'll push you again.

557
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,354
Why are you hitting
me hard for?

558
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:06,652
Why you hitting me hard for?

559
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:14,618
-All right, all right.
-All right.

560
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,421
I could take off my pants?

561
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:32,469
Okay.

562
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:55,492
-You're gonna laugh.
-No, I'm not.

563
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:58,245
-Promise not to laugh?
-I promise.

564
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,091
My ducks. My ducks!

565
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,302
-What the fuck is that?
-My ducks.

566
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,430
-Get out of here. What is that?
-My ducks.

567
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:17,973
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

568
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:20,517
Oh, my God.

569
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:22,477
You need help?

570
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,814
What, are your pants
stuck to your legs?

571
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:27,774
Sweaty.

572
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,319
So, what's up?

573
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:33,655
Ducks! Out of everything,
you're gonna wear ducks?

574
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:37,743
Yeah. They're cool.
Leave them alone.

575
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,344
Why are you laughing?

576
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:59,348
-You can't tell anybody, okay?
-Okay.

577
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,600
I'm serious. Don't tell Victor.

578
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:02,976
Why?

579
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:05,938
Because me and Judy said
that we had this thing.

580
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:10,067
-What thing?
-That we didn't need anybody else.

581
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:12,402
But she's with Victor.

582
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:17,407
-That's different.
-How is that different?

583
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:32,339
Yo, Victor! Yo, Victor!

584
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,637
Oh, my fucking--

585
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,729
Why you wake me up
so early, son?

586
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,085
Judy!

587
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,716
Yo, Judy!

588
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:18,719
I heard something,
and I want to know if it's true.

589
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:22,389
People are saying you're using me.
That you're playing head games.

590
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:25,142
-Is this what it is, a game? This true?
-No.

591
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:28,770
-Why people gotta say that for?
-What do you think?

592
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:33,233
I think you have me around because
you need a guy to take care of you.

593
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:37,112
I don't need no one
to take care of me.

594
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:40,782
-So you are using then, right?
-And like you're not?

595
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:44,077
I know you're trying to cover up
for that Donna girl.

596
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:48,373
What Donna girl? What?
Who told you that? That lie?!

597
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,917
Where you get your sources?

598
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:52,586
The people who you talking to
telling you lies.

599
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:55,005
You're really gullible
if you believe that.

600
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:58,133
You're so easy to see through
that it's embarrassing.

601
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:02,804
You know what? Fuck you.

602
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:54,815
Come here. Listen to me.

603
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:58,569
Listen to me very carefully.
I don't go out with boys.

604
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:02,030
-I called you, and you came down.
-To tell you to stop calling me!

605
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,199
You're like a stalker!
Would you stop?

606
00:47:04,575 --> 00:47:06,827
-Do you need space?
-Yes.

607
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:10,205
So if I call you again,
you won't come down?

608
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:11,999
No.

609
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:18,005
You're gonna cry?

610
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,723
Goodbye.

611
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:11,350
-Ma!
-Oh, my God!

612
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:15,103
Nino, it's Grandma.
Open door for Grandma. Please.

613
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:18,065
Ma, Ma. I'm using
the bathroom, Ma.

614
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:20,108
Let me see your face.

615
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:24,530
-Come on, Nino.
-I'll be out. I'll be out, all right?

616
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:40,128
Oh, my God.

617
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,298
I'm so ashamed.

618
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:47,636
This is what your brother
teaching of you?

619
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:51,223
This is your brother's action.
That's it!

620
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,194
Where we going?

621
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:49,907
Ma.

622
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:51,575
Go.

623
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:53,202
Ma.

624
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:05,464
Here. Keep him.

625
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:08,717
I don't want him in my house
no more!

626
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:12,179
It's finished.

627
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:15,224
Please stop.

628
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,767
It's finished.

629
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:20,229
It's finished.

630
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:25,442
Come in, young man.

631
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:33,033
Have a seat.

632
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:38,705
-What is your name?
-Victor Vargas.

633
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:45,379
-What is your date of birth, please?
-February 1 7, 1 985.

634
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:48,799
Who are your parents?

635
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:52,427
She's my mother and my father.
She's both.

636
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:57,182
-Are you his legal guardian?
-Yes, I am.

637
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:59,893
-And what is your name, please?
-Anna Guzman.

638
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,438
-But you can call me ''Tatika.''
-I'll call you ''Mrs. Guzman.''

639
00:51:03,647 --> 00:51:07,442
-And what is your date of birth?
-7 "l"28"l"1 930.

640
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:10,612
-And where were you born?
-In the Dominican Republic.

641
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:13,574
But I live in the United States
for many, many years.

642
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,492
I believe I am American.

643
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:17,619
Why are you here?

644
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:21,123
This is my family,
but I need help with this one.

645
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:24,835
He do a lot of things wrong
that I cannot accept it.

646
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:26,879
And they told me this place.

647
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:31,508
And I come in here to see what you
can do for me. And for them, so....

648
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:34,595
-Has he committed a crime?
-No, he don't do that.

649
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,264
Has he stolen anything
from someone in the home?

650
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:40,184
That's not the point.
He's not a criminal.

651
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:45,522
-Has he tried anything sexually?
-No! I says, no. Don't go that far.

652
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:51,320
-What has he done that's so bad?
-He's a bad influences in the house.

653
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:54,781
He show him very terrible ideas.

654
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:58,118
Right here, right here
in the head.

655
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:01,788
I raised them with love,
with manners.

656
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:06,543
But this one is going the wrong way.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

657
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,671
He don't have to be a criminal
to throw out of the house.

658
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:12,007
You realize you can't
just put him out?

659
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:13,383
Why?

660
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:17,721
You never heard of people going to jail
for just throwing kids in the street?

661
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:22,309
He can go to the cops.
They'll come and arrest you.

662
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:27,397
Then all three of them could end up
in foster care. Is that what you want?

663
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:32,523
You didn't unpack your bag.

664
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:42,157
You're not gonna leave, right?

665
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:51,750
I don't know, son.
Mommy don't want me.

666
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,419
So you're gonna leave?

667
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:59,174
What's the use if she's trying
to kick me out. What the fuck?

668
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:03,303
-Me and Vicki want you.
-Why, Nino?

669
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:08,016
Victor, we-- I need you.
I mean, I love you.

670
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:11,228
Who's gonna stay here
to be on the bed with me--?

671
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:14,398
Go ask somebody else
about girls. Go ask Mommy.

672
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:21,321
Go ask Mommy?

673
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:24,741
Go ask Mommy about girls?

674
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,956
Thank you.

675
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:38,046
-What are you doing? Get off.
-I'm not letting go.

676
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:39,590
-Get off, Nino.
-No.

677
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:42,634
Where are you gonna stay?
On the street? In Judy's house?

678
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:45,888
-This is your--
-All right. You're hurting me. Get off.

679
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:16,293
Ma, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry for....

680
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,422
You know, for giving you a hard time
and, like, not listening.

681
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:24,760
I just wanted to say that
I don't want to get thrown out.

682
00:56:29,348 --> 00:56:31,558
Nino, do you believe that?

683
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:33,769
Answer me, please.

684
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:40,275
-Yeah.
-You do?

685
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:42,402
How about you, Vicki?

686
00:56:46,156 --> 00:56:48,283
Yeah, Ma, I do.

687
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:59,688
I want to give you something
for some candles.

688
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:03,066
And for the new beginning.

689
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,819
Tomorrow night Grandma
is gonna make a good dinner.

690
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:09,990
We're going to join together and we're
gonna be a nice family again.

691
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:14,244
We hope, okay?
Go ahead, you're the first one.

692
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:52,241
You be next. Do the candle.

693
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:11,635
You're the next one, honey.

694
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:14,888
Get some wishes. Pray to God.

695
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:16,700
Hi.

696
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,752
Can I talk to you?

697
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:32,925
I'm sorry to bother you. I just--
I just wanted to say, I'm sorry.

698
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:36,220
I mean, I was being stupid
and I wasn't thinking.

699
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,972
And I'm really sorry.

700
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:50,025
So how have you been
keeping the guys away from you?

701
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:53,529
Mace.

702
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:59,326
I'll bet you've been using it
a lot, right?

703
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:08,293
You want to come to my house?

704
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:12,589
Oh, nah, nah, nah.
I know what you're thinking.

705
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,883
''Victor wants to get on top of me.''

706
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:18,053
Not like that.
I mean, you know, dinner.

707
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:20,013
You know, the family and shit.

708
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,182
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

709
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:25,853
-Friends can't invite friends to dinner?
-Oh, so now we're friends?

710
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:29,189
I mean, we could be,
but who'd wanna be friends with Vic?

711
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:30,691
You like burgers?

712
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:33,443
It don't matter, because
my burgers are the best.

713
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,238
It's so good it makes you
want to eat like this.

714
01:01:38,073 --> 01:01:40,492
You're not funny.

715
01:01:57,467 --> 01:01:59,720
I can't go.

716
01:02:03,307 --> 01:02:05,184
Whatever.

717
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:17,988
{y:i}So you're not gonna go?

718
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,954
I think you should, Judy.

719
01:02:30,334 --> 01:02:32,794
Remember that guy from the pool?

720
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:35,464
The guy that was with Victor
that day?

721
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:43,013
He was cute, right?

722
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:48,894
What about him?

723
01:02:51,522 --> 01:02:52,940
I like him.

724
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:58,278
-You like him?
-A lot.

725
01:02:59,363 --> 01:03:01,865
You have seen him once.

726
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:07,454
I've seen him more than that.

727
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:12,668
-Why you didn't tell me?
-Because I know you.

728
01:03:12,835 --> 01:03:15,796
And I know you're not
gonna be happy for me.

729
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:19,091
Are you happy for me?

730
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,102
I gotta go, Judy.

731
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:45,075
What's his name?

732
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:50,914
Harold.

733
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,753
How do you know you can trust him?

734
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:51,725
-Take care of my burgers.
-I do it.

735
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:10,369
Open the door, please!

736
01:05:11,328 --> 01:05:13,664
Would you open the door, please?

737
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,625
Ma, I got it.

738
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:25,008
Hey, is Victor here?

739
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:27,845
Yeah, come on.

740
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:40,691
Hey.

741
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:45,654
-Hi.
-Hi.

742
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:50,284
-I'm glad you came.
-Yeah, I thought about it.

743
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:54,413
Cool. Some burgers.

744
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,416
Whatever.

745
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:05,174
-Hi. Who's this girl?
-This is Judy, my friend.

746
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,675
-Hi, Judy.
-Hello.

747
01:06:06,842 --> 01:06:08,427
Ma, I invited her for dinner.

748
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:11,138
Why you don't tell me before?
I know who's coming.

749
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:15,684
Oh, he invited me,
but I told him that I wasn't sure.

750
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:18,812
-Okay.
-And this is my brother Nino.

751
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:22,191
-Nino, this is Judy.
-Oh, hello.

752
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:27,571
-Hi, Nino.
-You met my sister. This is Vicki.

753
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,532
Hey, Vicki.

754
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:33,160
-So....
-You dropped this.

755
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:37,497
Oh, thank you. "Muchas gracias."
Thanks. Oh, she's good girl.

756
01:06:37,664 --> 01:06:39,750
Sit down. Stay with us.
Join the dinner.

757
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:42,169
-Okay.
-Have a seat.

758
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:56,475
Move over, man.

759
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,911
-It smells good.
-It's my food. I already cook.

760
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:20,165
Already cook.

761
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:29,216
-So where are you from?
-I'm from the Dominican Republic.

762
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:33,971
-What part?
-Down the island, "La Altagracia."

763
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:39,351
My father used to have,
resting in peace, his own...

764
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:44,606
...farm. And he produce
his own food.

765
01:07:44,815 --> 01:07:47,776
We be so many of us, is 1 4 kids.

766
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:52,781
My father working too hard.
He produces food. Everything.

767
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:57,119
And he has a lot of cows.

768
01:07:57,286 --> 01:08:01,123
They produce milk with the cows,
almost 1 00.

769
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:04,668
And they get milk like that.
They put a big can on the floor.

770
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:08,839
And they grab the titties
of the cow and do like this.

771
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:12,843
Like this. Maybe that's the reason
why I be so strong lady.

772
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:19,016
-How did that taste? Like, you didn't....
-Taste delicious. I remember.

773
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:30,777
Here is Grandma with the food.

774
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:36,783
Don't sit. Stand up
and let's pray. Please.

775
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,797
Jesus, we pray today with thanks
to you for the food of the day.

776
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:55,135
Also, for my family get together...

777
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:59,848
...and for me to be strong to keep
on taking of care of my grand.

778
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:02,768
-Amen.
-Amen.

779
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:06,855
Have a seat and enjoy
the dinner, okay?

780
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:10,776
-So....
-Can I have one?

781
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:29,002
-So you like my food?
-It's good.

782
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:33,215
I know you love it.
I know you like my food.

783
01:09:34,174 --> 01:09:36,385
You know I made these, right?

784
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:39,388
You don't believe me?

785
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:43,517
-Ma, right? I made these?
-To make you feel good, let's say yes.

786
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:45,227
You help us, that's it.

787
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:46,603
-Oh, my God.
-He help me.

788
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:52,234
-Yes, I did. I was--
-And I say yes. He give a hands to us.

789
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:56,530
Anyway, Judy, where you meet Victor?

790
01:09:56,697 --> 01:09:59,992
My brother introduced us. Carlos.

791
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:04,872
-Are you Carlos' sister?
-Yeah.

792
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,595
Excuse me.

793
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:28,478
What's wrong?

794
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:33,525
I'm sorry, I don't know
why she's acting up.

795
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:51,919
Judy, do you see that? Take a look
at the glasses. That was you.

796
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:55,297
Means for me that you
was here before.

797
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:58,133
I thought that it was the first time
you come to my house.

798
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,761
Why you lie to me?
Why you did you do that to me?

799
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:02,429
Can you sit?
Can you calm down?

800
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:04,640
You always do things wrong
in this house.

801
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,351
-What's the matter with you?
-You know what? She likes him.

802
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:08,977
-No, I don't.
-She likes Carlos.

803
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,773
You make her grown before her time.
That's terrible what you do.

804
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,942
Same thing you did
for your brother.

805
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:18,612
You show to him to do things wrong!
Why'd you do that?!

806
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:23,450
-I didn't even do nothing to him.
-I found my baby in the bathroom.

807
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:26,662
I catch my baby in the bathroom
doing something terrible.

808
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:28,830
-Do this.
-Please! What are you doing?!

809
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:32,918
-My baby.
-You think he'll always be a baby?

810
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:35,796
You always think he's gonna be
a baby. That's it.

811
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,806
Ma-- Judy, don't leave.

812
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,099
-Judy--
-Where you going?

813
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:50,435
-Ma, why'd you do that?
-Don't try to go. If you follow that girl...

814
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:53,856
...don't come back in the house.
I'm gonna change the lock.

815
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:56,733
No, remember what the lady said.
You can't do that.

816
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,571
I don't care what the lady said.
I care the way I feel.

817
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:02,865
You gonna call the police
for Grandma?

818
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:07,494
Then remember only thing
you have is me.

819
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:10,372
No, Ma. You remember.
The only thing you have is us.

820
01:12:22,217 --> 01:12:25,387
Judy, Judy, Judy, wait.
I am so sorry.

821
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:27,639
Why the hell did you
invite me over for?

822
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:30,225
Let me guess. Was it to impress
your grandmother?

823
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:33,604
-It was nothing like that. No--
-Because obviously, it didn't work.

824
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:37,024
You think I invited you over
to my house for hamburgers?

825
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,902
That's part of the reason,
but mostly the reason was...

826
01:12:40,068 --> 01:12:42,029
...because I wanted
you to meet my crazy ma...

827
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:44,698
...and my bitchy sister
and my little brother.

828
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:47,242
I wanted you to see me down
to my "chancletas..."

829
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:50,621
...these fucking beat-down shorts
and shit.

830
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:54,291
Why?

831
01:12:57,252 --> 01:12:59,546
Because that's me.

832
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:11,934
Come on.

833
01:13:37,835 --> 01:13:42,130
Do you remember when I told you
that I had a man?

834
01:13:45,676 --> 01:13:48,720
I kind of made the whole thing up...

835
01:13:48,846 --> 01:13:52,182
...so they won't follow me around.

836
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:06,321
So you're the closest
I've ever been with a boy.

837
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:17,452
Will you come over here?

838
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:49,229
Can I--? Can I have the key
to the phone?

839
01:20:19,528 --> 01:20:22,030
Hello, is Carlos there?

840
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:24,616
It's Vicki.

841
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:28,203
-"Hello."
-Hi, Carlos.

842
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:31,874
Ma, did you eat yet?

843
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:14,142
Good morning.
