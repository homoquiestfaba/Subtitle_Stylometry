1
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,190
<i>I was a good kid.</i>

2
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,359
<i>A strong kid.</i>

3
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:05,097
<i>I always had a deep desire
to win.</i>

4
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,300
<i>Everything for me
was competition.</i>

5
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,671
<i>Hockey was my sport.</i>

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,442
<i>And that sport became my drug.</i>

7
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,440
<i>I got hit a lot in hockey.</i>

8
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,309
<i>I got hit hard.</i>

9
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:54,546
<i>I got driven into the boards.
I dislocated a shoulder.</i>

10
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:58,617
<i>I tore up a knee.
I couldn't walk for a summer.</i>

11
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,588
<i>I fell on my face.
I ate through a straw.</i>

12
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,392
<i>I got hit, I fell,
I got back up.</i>

13
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,529
<i>That's how I won.</i>

14
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:17,636
<i>Until I got hit by something
I couldn't beat.</i>

15
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,511
<i>I became addicted
to another drug.</i>

16
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:04,349
<i>It created a false sense
of victory.</i>

17
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,552
<i>I was in darkness.</i>

18
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,188
<i>I lost my way.</i>

19
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,363
<i>24-hours a day.</i>

20
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,800
<i>I bet the only thing
cranked up in your house...</i>

21
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,509
<i>Maybe the only way
to stop was to die.</i>

22
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,678
<i>We're gonna give you</i>

23
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,579
<i>some more of that coming up.</i>

24
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,348
<i>Let me give you guys
the weather today on this...</i>

25
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,220
<i>Can we call it lovely
February 6, 2004?</i>

26
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,354
<i>Looks like a big storm,</i>

27
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,689
<i>a big storm
coming in later this afternoon.</i>

28
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:48,527
<i>This is the craziest winter
I've seen in years.</i>

29
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,928
<i>Seriously...</i>

30
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,530
<i>Romans seven says,</i>

31
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:54,433
<i>"for I have the desire
to do what is good,"</i>

32
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,401
<i>but I cannot carry it out,</i>

33
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,570
<i>for I do not do the good
I want to do</i>

34
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,506
<i>but the evil
I don't want to do.</i>

35
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,841
<i>"This I keep on doing."</i>

36
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,842
Do you know how many
millions of kids dream

37
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,911
of being a pro athlete,

38
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,680
of having that chance?

39
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:20,319
And... and you're throwing it
away by snorting meth?

40
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,522
Eric!

41
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,024
I'm done.

42
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,726
<i>I'm not going
to help you anymore</i>

43
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,995
<i>until you want to help yourself.</i>

44
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,066
Well, I hired you a lawyer.

45
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,069
He said you absolutely
have to show up in court

46
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,036
in seven days.

47
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,805
You're going
to have to commit

48
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,674
<i>to a 12-step recovery program.</i>

49
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,945
Oh, my god.

50
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,730
My god.

51
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,476
Idiot.

52
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,784
Come on. Oh, god.

53
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,856
That's your equity, idiot.

54
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,152
Wait!

55
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,789
Wait! Wait!

56
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,891
Wait!

57
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,194
God!

58
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,655
Hey.

59
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,524
- Hey.
- Ooh. But...

60
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:49,294
Seriously, there's four reasons
you should not be eating that,

61
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,030
the first one being
that's where Jackson pees.

62
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,601
Yeah.

63
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,103
It also lowers
your body temperature

64
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,905
and makes you prone
to hypothermia.

65
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,907
But the thing that most people
don't know

66
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,742
is it actually dehydrates you.

67
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,278
So, all in all,
not a good idea.

68
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,812
Good to know.

69
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,915
Um, I'm Sarah, by the way.

70
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,017
- Eric.
- Headed up the mountain?

71
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,719
- Yeah.
- Hop in, I'll give you a ride.

72
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,122
This close enough for you?

73
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:28,159
Whoa! Jackson, leave him alone.
We gotta go.

74
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,661
- Be safe out there, ok?
- Thanks.

75
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:33,031
Don't tell your beautiful
mother our secret, okay, buddy?

76
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,804
Enjoy the mountain air.

77
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,007
Always do.

78
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,481
<i>Patrol 2 to base.</i>

79
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,983
<i>We gotta do something soon.</i>

80
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,019
Hey, Corey wants to see you.
He said it's important.

81
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,788
- I know. I've already told him.
- No, he knows.

82
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,424
He's not leaving early. I think
this is actually important.

83
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,591
<i>You've reached
Susan lemarque.</i>

84
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:50,128
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

85
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,332
Hey, mom.

86
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,868
I'm out boarding. Uh...

87
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,971
I just had to get away
for a few days.

88
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,873
Uh...

89
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,480
Look, I never wanted
to bring you into this, so...

90
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,584
It's hard.

91
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,060
I'll talk to you later, okay?

92
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,545
So, the nucleus is going
to hit here,

93
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,946
it's a large impact zone,

94
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,314
it's definitely worse
than we thought.

95
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:46,951
It's predicting
two or three feet tonight.

96
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,054
Patrol 2, this is rm.
What's your location? Over.

97
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:54,392
<i>This is patrol 2.
I'm at the top of the trail.</i>

98
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,428
How's your visibility up there?

99
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,331
<i>Well, the viz
is really bad.</i>

100
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,165
<i>When you get up the top,</i>

101
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,269
<i>there are pockets below
of total whiteout.</i>

102
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,103
<i>We might wanna consider</i>

103
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,605
<i>shutting down
the mountain early.</i>

104
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,427
Argh!

105
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,233
Idiot!

106
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,464
Seriously?

107
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,835
God!

108
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,439
Okay, baby.

109
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,476
It's you and me.

110
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,853
Yeah, okay.

111
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,267
Come on.

112
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,238
Oh, shit.

113
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,980
Yeah.

114
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,943
Ugh!

115
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,447
Ah, damn it!

116
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,692
<i>How many ladders
does lemarque owe me</i>

117
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,527
<i>for being ten minutes late?</i>

118
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,465
But this isn't my fault!

119
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,943
Get up.

120
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,544
I can't.

121
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,979
I'm sorry, what?

122
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,315
I can't. I can't get up.

123
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:27,451
Five more.

124
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,655
Hey, Eric.

125
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:31,922
Son.

126
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:36,761
Son, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

127
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,363
You're a part of this team.

128
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,565
Understand that?

129
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,770
Now, will it always be fair? No.

130
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:48,306
Will it always be easy? No.

131
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,974
Now, you walk off that ice
right now,

132
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:53,511
you're letting your team down,
you're letting me down.

133
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,380
And I can't let you do that.

134
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,017
'Cause you're a lemarque.

135
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,989
And lemarques don't quit.

136
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,699
Come on.

137
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,931
Stop!

138
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,666
Aah!

139
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,755
Easy.

140
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,627
Easy.

141
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:26,630
Aah!

142
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:10,801
All he cares about
is... is pleasing you.

143
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,671
He just wants to be
good enough for you!

144
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:14,972
I get it, I get it.

145
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,774
You want me to let him
off the hook,

146
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,576
just let him do
whatever he wants.

147
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:21,045
You know, maybe our son
would be so much happier

148
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,781
if he had the time to play
and see friends

149
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,616
and watch a little TV,
god forbid,

150
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,985
instead of worrying
about pro hockey and the draft,

151
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:29,587
whatever new skill
you've tasked him with

152
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,722
that he'll never be
perfect enough for you.

153
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:32,990
You're stressing the boy out.

154
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,291
He's gonna have a breakdown
or something.

155
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:38,362
I got it, I got it. I
wanna tell you something, okay?

156
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,029
That boy...

157
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:42,099
That boy, he is never
gonna be a failure.

158
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,635
I am not gonna let him
be a failure.

159
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,136
It is never gonna happen, okay?

160
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,138
He's not gonna wake up
at 25 years old,

161
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,240
he's not gonna put
on a little tie,

162
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:53,277
and he's gonna iron his shirt,
David, iron his shirt,

163
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,678
and he's gonna kiss his wife...

164
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,114
Oh! Who he never
should have married!

165
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,017
Never should have married!
Never gonna happen!

166
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,619
He's not gonna go
to that 9-to-5,

167
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,388
not if I have anything
to do with it.

168
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,341
Okay, find where we started.

169
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,844
Find where we started,
you idiot.

170
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,924
Okay.

171
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,431
Aah.

172
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,142
All right.

173
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:13,050
You made me sleep...
Right about here.

174
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:21,925
Tried to throw me off a cliff
right over here.

175
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,261
And your...

176
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:29,199
Fanged friends paid me
a visit right here.

177
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,476
So that means...

178
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,246
The resort...

179
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,819
Should be right here.

180
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,262
Oh!

181
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,634
Oh!

182
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,370
Aah!

183
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,191
<i>Lemarque!
What are you doing?</i>

184
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:24,194
<i>Move the puck!
Don't be so selfish.</i>

185
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,264
Now move the puck!

186
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,700
Move your feet, get going.

187
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,836
Move it, move it.
Give it to 'em!

188
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:36,740
Move the puck! Use 'em!
Move it! Give it to 'em!

189
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,642
Give it to 'em!
Damn it.

190
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:43,346
Move the puck!
Move it! Move it!

191
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,624
You all right?

192
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,796
You kidding me?

193
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,465
What the hell was that?

194
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,502
Lemarque!

195
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,439
Lemarque, what the hell
are you doing?

196
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,509
You gotta be a team player.
Move the puck.

197
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:14,144
I scored a goal, didn't I?

198
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,479
It's not I, it's we.

199
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:18,548
It's the crest on the front,
not the name on the back!

200
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,418
You're gonna
have to figure that out!

201
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,680
Aah!

202
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,913
<i>Hey, mom.</i>

203
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,783
<i>I'm out boarding. Uh...</i>

204
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:44,421
<i>I just had to get away
for a few days. Uh...</i>

205
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:49,392
<i>Look, I never wanted
to bring you into this, so...</i>

206
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,495
<i>It's hard.</i>

207
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,433
<i>I'll talk to you later, okay?</i>

208
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,515
I'm getting off this mountain.

209
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,953
I'm getting off this mountain.

210
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,690
I'm getting
off this mountain.

211
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,432
Curse!

212
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,634
You can't hold me!

213
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,870
You can't stop me!

214
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:55,525
Yeah!

215
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:58,061
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

216
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,664
Oh!

217
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,699
Yes!

218
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:05,135
Yes!

219
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:08,772
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, it's cold!

220
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:12,008
Oh, my...

221
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,877
Ow-oo!

222
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,779
Oh, my god.

223
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:16,913
Ow-oo!

224
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,748
You idiot.

225
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,118
Ow-oo! Whoa!

226
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,778
Oh!

227
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,085
Oh!

228
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,306
Oh, god!

229
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:05,368
Pounding, I mean pounding
against glass.

230
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,203
Goal!

231
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,472
Red light spinning, whoo!

232
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:12,008
- You want one of these?
- No, I'm good.

233
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,844
Oh, yeah.
I miss it so much.

234
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:17,780
I miss it so much.
I know you miss it, too.

235
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:19,282
You gotta miss it.

236
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:22,852
I don't miss shit about Boston.
It's your shot.

237
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,020
A new rule in my house.

238
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:27,123
And that rule is,
I don't play pool with liars.

239
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,792
Come on, man, it's your shot,
just take the shot.

240
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:31,260
I get it, okay, I understand.

241
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:34,163
It's gotta be really hard
for you to come and see me

242
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:36,299
and see my awesome life
with this great house

243
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:40,203
and this amazing view,
but the only reason why I'm here

244
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:42,872
is because you decided
not to be.

245
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,882
I'm sorry, dude.

246
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,350
I...

247
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,354
I get it, man.

248
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,857
I'm right there
alongside you, man.

249
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,792
I get it, I miss it too.

250
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,762
All the guys that ever played
miss it.

251
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:09,031
That's...
That's why I do this stuff.

252
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:11,100
It gives me that rush back,
that adrenaline,

253
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,269
that feeling I can't get back.

254
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,339
I... I know you miss that, man.

255
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,008
I know you do.

256
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,528
Here, give me that.

257
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,093
Ohh!

258
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:46,329
God!

259
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:56,939
Ohh!

260
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,420
Oh, no.

261
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,018
One...

262
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,987
Two...

263
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:50,459
Aah!

264
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,303
The tram...
Where's the tram?

265
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,648
The tram has gotta be there.

266
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,133
What?

267
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,145
What do you want from me?

268
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,448
What do you want from me?!

269
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:59,789
Damn it!
What do you want from me?!

270
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,380
I'm gonna go this way.

271
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:26,849
I'm going this way.

272
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,251
I'm going this way.

273
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,494
<i>"The sun
shall not smite thee by day"</i>

274
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,795
<i>nor the moon by night.</i>

275
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,931
<i>The lord shall preserve thee
from all evil.</i>

276
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,333
<i>He shall preserve thy soul.</i>

277
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:54,236
<i>The lord shall preserve

278
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:57,673
and thy coming in
from this time forth

279
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,176
"and even forevermore."

280
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:23,432
<i>This is Eric.
Leave a message.</i>

281
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,571
Hi, Eric, it's mom again.

282
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,942
Uh, I just wanna make sure
that you're...

283
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,312
Listen...

284
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:38,714
About what I said before...

285
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,852
I just want you to know
that I'm here

286
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:47,856
and that you don't have to
go through this alone.

287
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,727
So call me.

288
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:53,896
Please.

289
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,467
Okay? Bye.

290
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:27,596
You're the best thing
in the whole world.

291
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,300
Mama loves you so much.

292
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,080
Two...

293
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,055
Aah!

294
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,862
Aah!

295
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,960
<i>Getting by...
It's a breakaway!</i>

296
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,996
Lemarque! He shoots, he scores!

297
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,006
Goddamn it!

298
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,610
Eric!

299
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,480
Eric, what's going on? Eric?

300
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:07,483
What's happening down here?
Are you all right?

301
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:10,519
- Fine, mom.
- What's going on?

302
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:13,856
Come on, Eric.

303
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:15,224
You're living down here
for six months,

304
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:18,494
no job, no money, no nothing
and this is what you're doing,

305
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:19,027
destroying everything?

306
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:21,497
You think I wanna be here? Think
I wanna be living like this?

307
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:25,234
You think I wanna be reminded
of this shit every day?!

308
00:58:25,236 --> 00:58:26,068
No, I don't!

309
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,137
No! And I wanna help you.
I'm your mother.

310
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:32,508
I wanna help you,
but you have to let me in.

311
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,960
A signal.

312
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:55,764
Maybe if I can get a signal.

313
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,767
They can track me.

314
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,970
Find me.

315
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,721
Come on. Come on.

316
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,690
<i>- Oh, crap.
- Yeah, hello?</i>

317
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:23,225
<i>- Oh, hello.
- Hello?</i>

318
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:26,695
Hi, Tony.
This is Susan lemarque.

319
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:29,164
<i>- I'm Eric's mother.
- Oh, hey.</i>

320
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:31,767
Yes, hi. I know that we
haven't spoken much,

321
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:33,635
because, uh, well, anyway,

322
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:36,838
I know he's talked about you,
about snowboarding.

323
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,141
And, uh...
He's up in winter haven,

324
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:41,076
or he was
the last time I spoke to him,

325
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:44,580
but he's missed
a very important court date.

326
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,581
And I'm very worried about him,

327
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,282
and I haven't spoken to him
in six days.

328
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:48,717
<i>What's this have
to do with me?</i>

329
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,252
I was wondering if he'd
reached out to you.

330
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,588
<i>Yeah, I called him
when he was up there.</i>

331
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,756
You did? Oh, when was that?

332
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:55,991
<i>It was Thursday.</i>

333
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:58,226
I see.
Do you have an address for him?

334
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:01,229
<i>Yeah, let me look.
- Oh, fantastic.</i>

335
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:03,231
<i>He's at
the winter haven cabin.</i>

336
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:03,699
Great.

337
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:06,001
<i>Very easy to find.
- Oh, this is wonderful, Tony.</i>

338
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:08,937
More than you can know.
Thank you so much.

339
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,672
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

340
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,307
Aah!

341
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:33,048
Oh, please, please, don't let me
find him lying on the floor.

342
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,883
Please.

343
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:40,856
Eric? Eric?

344
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,358
What?

345
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,193
Eric!

346
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,468
His clothes are still here.

347
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,846
Damn it.

348
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,357
Eric!

349
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,472
- Sarah, risk management.
- Susan.

350
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:32,174
Nice to meet you.

351
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,178
So, exactly how long has it been
since you last saw your son?

352
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,980
Seven days. I went to
the cabin where he was staying

353
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,582
and there was no phone,
wallet or keys,

354
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:42,551
but everything else
was there.

355
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:44,486
And when you last
heard from him,

356
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:45,287
you're sure he was here?

357
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:47,355
Oh, yes, yes, he left me
a message.

358
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:48,924
I just didn't
hear my phone.

359
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:51,026
Okay, the first thing
we do in this situation

360
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:53,995
is file a missing persons report
with the sheriff's office.

361
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,831
Then if they don't
have any leads,

362
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:56,898
I'll call search and rescue.

363
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,901
The process will probably
take about a day or two.

364
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:01,937
No, no, Sarah,
you don't understand.

365
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:05,373
My son had a court date
yesterday that he missed. Okay?

366
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,944
And that message he left me,
that was not normal,

367
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:12,147
him telling me where he was
and what he was doing.

368
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:13,982
He never does that, never.

369
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:15,383
You wanna know why
he did it?

370
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:16,484
Because he
was letting me know

371
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:18,887
he was gonna make it
to the court date,

372
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:20,956
he was getting it together.

373
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,457
So when I walk
into that courtroom

374
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:25,427
and he is not there,
and then I walk into that cabin

375
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:29,898
and I see his clothes
and old congealed food

376
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,400
sitting there and no him?

377
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:34,302
I can't wait a day or two,

378
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:36,171
and if he is out
there in that snow

379
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:39,074
on that mountain,
neither can he.

380
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,144
Okay, you have a photo?

381
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:45,113
Yes, yes, I do.

382
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:49,117
<i>Search and rescue.</i>

383
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,020
Search and rescue? Yeah, this is
rm down at winter haven.

384
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,355
I need to report
a missing person.

385
01:04:53,357 --> 01:04:54,422
<i>What's the name?</i>

386
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:57,125
- Full name?
- Eric lemarque.

387
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,127
Eric... Eric lemarque.

388
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:00,362
<i>How long has
he been missing?</i>

389
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:02,397
<i>- Seven days ago.
- You have a photo?</i>

390
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,900
Yeah, I'm getting
the photo now.

391
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,339
I'm gonna need search and rescue
on the helipad in 15 minutes.

392
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:14,042
<i>Fifteen, copy.
- Thank you.</i>

393
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:14,976
You know my son?

394
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:17,112
- Walk with me.
- You've met my son?

395
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:19,114
I've met your son, okay?
I gave him a ride up

396
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:21,116
the mountain seven days ago,
but that's all I know.

397
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:23,952
Right now I'm just trying
to take precautions.

398
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:24,219
Corey,

399
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,054
get the whole team searching
for anything with radio comms.

400
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:27,923
I'm talking about cell phones,
fm/am radios,

401
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,258
anything that's gonna
receive a signal.

402
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:30,625
You got it.

403
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:33,161
Hopefully, he'll get
to the top of the mountain.

404
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,363
You think he's up there?

405
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,401
I know he's up there.

406
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,674
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

407
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:02,991
<i>Patrol 1,
search and rescue in progress.</i>

408
01:06:02,993 --> 01:06:06,227
"White male, 6' 3" tall.

409
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:19,274
Curt, anything come up yet?

410
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,376
<i>Fm, am, cell.</i>

411
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:24,279
<i>Nothing. T-cast is clear.</i>

412
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:55,377
<i>We've got 15 minutes
till we lose visibility.</i>

413
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,840
Wait!

414
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,843
Wait!

415
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,247
Wait! Wait!

416
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,715
Aaaah!

417
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,555
Wait!

418
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,791
Aaaah!

419
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,299
Wait!

420
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,503
Wait!

421
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:35,577
Wait! Wait!

422
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,517
Wait!

423
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:48,750
Sarah, we have to call it.

424
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:20,715
<i>I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I'm so sorry.</i>

425
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,650
Mama loves you.

426
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,852
With all her heart.

427
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:35,330
No.

428
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:42,937
I can't let her find me
like this.

429
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:52,580
Hey...
Thought you might want these.

430
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,382
It gets pretty cold up here.

431
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:55,383
That's very kind.

432
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,919
You must definitely
want that back.

433
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,755
Yes, definitely, thank you.

434
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:06,361
As soon as the sun comes up,
we'll be back up there.

435
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:08,696
What about tonight?

436
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,932
What's Eric gonna do
out there tonight?

437
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,000
If I take my team
out there tonight,

438
01:11:12,002 --> 01:11:15,803
this becomes a rescue mission
for more than one person.

439
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:18,439
I can't risk that,
I'm sorry.

440
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:25,847
Are you close
with your mother, Sarah?

441
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:28,049
Sometimes.

442
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:32,820
Bet you call her
like once...

443
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:34,956
Every other week or so,

444
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,658
if that much.

445
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,727
I can guarantee you
that those seven minutes

446
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:43,031
are the highlight
of her month.

447
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,732
Because then she gets to feel

448
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:47,568
like she's a part
of your life again.

449
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:49,504
'Cause she still remembers
when you were little

450
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:52,307
and she would hold you
and sing you to sleep,

451
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:56,444
and it was the happiest
time of her life.

452
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,848
I just want you
to imagine, god forbid,

453
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:04,018
something should happen
to you in your line of work

454
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,720
and you were no longer here.

455
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:10,525
Your mother's life
would essentially be over.

456
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:13,961
Her heart would be
an empty hole.

457
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:17,098
I just
need you to understand.

458
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,668
You have to find my son.

459
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:22,804
Please.

460
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,475
You have to find him.

461
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:42,210
Gotta make it to the top.

462
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,137
Hey, this has been the coldest
winter we've had in ten years.

463
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:11,539
Three, four days tops.

464
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,140
That's the longest
someone could survive

465
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:15,710
out there in these conditions.

466
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:17,612
I'll call the report in.

467
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:19,947
Thanks.

468
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:24,519
Comm center
from life flight.

469
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:26,187
<i>Go from comm center.</i>

470
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,989
You can cancel
search and rescue.

471
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:30,825
This is gonna be
a body recovery.

472
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,882
Aaaah!

473
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,181
About 12 more steps.

474
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:08,689
Aah!

475
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,189
<i>All right, results are in.</i>

476
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:50,991
<i>Your kids made the snowmen
you sent us</i>

477
01:18:50,993 --> 01:18:53,227
<i>to our radio station's
website...</i>

478
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,097
Hey, guys, can you
excuse me for a minute?

479
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:57,765
<i>We have some
late-breaking information.</i>

480
01:18:57,767 --> 01:19:01,035
<i>Turns out a face drawn
on the windshield of a car</i>

481
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:03,170
<i>does not count as a snowman.</i>

482
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:05,840
<i>That is just a car...</i>

483
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:14,081
<i>Not actually made
out of snow.</i>

484
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:20,955
Help.

485
01:19:57,893 --> 01:19:59,794
Come on.

486
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,067
Are you kidding me, man?

487
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:08,469
The organization dumped me.

488
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:09,537
You don't gotta lie
to me about it.

489
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:12,406
I was there at that practice
when you walked away.

490
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:15,142
You were the future
of the franchise.

491
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:16,844
You were twice as good
as I ever was.

492
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:18,846
Do you understand
how frustrating that is?

493
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:21,115
To watch somebody
that has everything,

494
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:24,351
everything,
and then you just walk away.

495
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:26,220
You quit!

496
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:42,536
<i>Lemarque! Lemarque!
What the hell are you doing?</i>

497
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:43,604
<i>It's not I, it's we.</i>

498
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:46,507
<i>It's the crest on the front,
not the name on the back.</i>

499
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:48,442
You're gonna have
to figure that out.

500
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:53,414
Now, today, get off my ice.
Beat it! I've had enough of you.

501
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:55,349
You're done for the day.

502
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:57,918
Get off my ice.

503
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:02,089
You're right. I am done.

504
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,928
Don't even think
about it.

505
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,965
That's a one-way ticket, pal.

506
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:17,371
<i>- Dad!
- No, Eric.</i>

507
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:20,574
- Don't go after him.
- Dad!

508
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,277
Dad!

509
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:26,046
Where are you going? Dad?

510
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:28,182
Dad! You can't go!

511
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:31,018
You can't leave!

512
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:34,021
Open the door right now.
You can't go!

513
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:35,556
Come here, baby!

514
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:40,060
Where are you going?!

515
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:44,331
You can't leave
your own son, you coward!

516
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:45,499
No!

517
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:50,638
What are you doing?! Wait!

518
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,406
Don't do it!

519
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,478
Dad!

520
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:24,939
<i>This isn't my fault!
They took my skates!</i>

521
01:22:24,941 --> 01:22:27,074
Stop pointing this
at everybody else.

522
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:29,143
Because you do that in life,
it is gonna hurt

523
01:22:29,145 --> 01:22:32,546
a whole lot worse than this,
do you understand me?

524
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:36,383
- Do you understand me?!
- Yes, sir.

525
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:41,255
The whole world's wondering,
lemarque...

526
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,563
Why'd ya quit?

527
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:48,422
<i>Spencer
and his snowman, is that huge!</i>

528
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:51,625
<i>That is a lot of snow...</i>

529
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,509
Hi, mom.

530
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,116
It's me.

531
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:28,388
I don't really know what it is
I wanna say.

532
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:34,795
But I don't think I have
too much time, so...

533
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:48,675
I just want you to know that
I'm okay without those things.

534
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:02,656
And that I... I'm sorry.

535
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:09,463
I'm sorry for everything.

536
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:21,375
Turns out I'm a bit
of a coward myself.

537
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:48,569
It's funny.

538
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,675
We only get to live
life forward.

539
01:26:56,911 --> 01:27:01,381
But it never makes any sense
until we're looking back.

540
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:20,467
I need you to know that we've
canceled the search and rescue.

541
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:21,735
Why?

542
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:24,271
We've now ruled this
a body recovery.

543
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:34,381
I love you, mom.

544
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:07,407
Hey, uh, Sarah,
we just had a signal pop up.

545
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:10,477
Wait, wait, hold on a minute.

546
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:12,779
We just had a signal popped up
and then it disappeared.

547
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:14,648
- Where?
- Uh, mount widow's peak.

548
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,683
- But it wasn't one of ours.
- You sure?

549
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:17,651
Yeah, positive.

550
01:29:17,653 --> 01:29:19,052
Search and rescue,
this is rm.

551
01:29:19,054 --> 01:29:22,389
We picked up
a signal on mount widow's peak.

552
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:41,808
<i>Coordinates
are north 4-0-3-2-3-0.60,</i>

553
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:47,948
<i>west 111-4-1-3.07.</i>

554
01:29:58,126 --> 01:29:59,960
Hold on, Eric.

555
01:30:20,014 --> 01:30:21,615
<i>Hey, got him!</i>

556
01:30:21,617 --> 01:30:23,817
Up on that Ridge, two o'clock.

557
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:09,629
Please, let him be alive.

558
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,031
Please,
let him be alive.

559
01:31:11,033 --> 01:31:13,500
Please, let him be alive.

560
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,663
<i>Search and rescue
to base.</i>

561
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:46,132
Two minutes out before landing.

562
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:08,755
You're going
to be okay, Eric.

563
01:32:08,757 --> 01:32:10,690
You're going to be okay.

564
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:46,726
Eric!

565
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:51,965
You're alive!

566
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:57,671
I love you, sweetheart!

567
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,074
<i>Sometimes you get hit.</i>

568
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:01,942
<i>You fall.</i>

569
01:33:01,944 --> 01:33:07,113
<i>You can't get back up.
And you fall further.</i>

570
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:12,886
<i>Before the mountain, I couldn't
see how far I'd fallen.</i>

571
01:33:13,287 --> 01:33:16,022
<i>Maybe that's what I had
to go through...</i>

572
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:18,625
<i>To finally live.</i>

573
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:22,862
<i>Sometimes a part
of yourself has to die</i>

574
01:33:22,864 --> 01:33:25,198
<i>maybe even the part
you love most...</i>

575
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,834
before you can realize
what makes you whole

576
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:32,272
and clearly see
that it's larger than us.

577
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,240
If you're in the dark,
get through it

578
01:33:34,242 --> 01:33:38,645
by seeing the invisible so that
you can do the impossible.

579
01:33:38,647 --> 01:33:42,616
Be responsible and accountable
for yourself.

580
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:44,050
Just fail forward.

581
01:33:44,052 --> 01:33:44,818
It will all make sense

582
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:47,921
when you see the light
at the break of dawn.

583
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:50,824
I thank my mother
for being there for me,

584
01:33:50,826 --> 01:33:52,826
I thank my wife for loving me,

585
01:33:52,828 --> 01:33:55,762
I thank my kids
for inspiring me.

586
01:33:55,764 --> 01:33:57,697
And now, by the grace of god,

587
01:33:57,699 --> 01:34:01,067
I can thank you, hockey,
and the mountain

588
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:03,837
for giving me my hope.
