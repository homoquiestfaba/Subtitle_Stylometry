0
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,100
Nice.

1
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,233
I can't find a spot.

2
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:56,600
All right, just lean back...

3
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,033
and I'll help you down, okay?

4
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,166
Okay.

5
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,300
Lower away.

6
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,433
- All right, lowering.
- All right.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,700
Nice.

8
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,667
Whoo!

9
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,300
All right, all right.

10
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,033
Good job.

11
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,100
Ugh, it was a little scary
up there.

12
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:19,633
- Not as easy as it looks.
- No.

13
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:23,734
All right. Who's next?

14
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,500
- Zoe Best is in the house.
- Harris!

15
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,166
It's nice to see you.
How are you?

16
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,700
Never better.

17
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:44,367
- What do you think?
- It's wonderful.

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,533
I heard the book-signing
was a huge success

19
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,500
Yeah, I couldn't
believe the turnout,

20
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,166
especially after
that one newspaper

21
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,200
called my photos
"high school yearbook poses."

22
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,643
Ahh, forget about
that one review.

23
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,166
Your photos are great
and your book is selling.

24
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,800
Hm. I can do better.

25
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:03,266
Of course. That's why
I wanted to see you.

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,834
I've got an idea
for your next book.

27
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:07,433
Really?

28
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,300
You've done a great job
documenting Chicago

29
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,233
and the Midwest.

30
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,467
Now I want you
to take on the West,

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,066
starting with
Yosemite National Park.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,667
Wow. Yosemite?

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,700
I... I've never even been there.

34
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:20,834
All the better.

35
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,633
You'll bring fresh eyes
to the place.

36
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,233
I want you to reveal Yosemite

37
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:26,934
like no one else has ever done.

38
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,667
I like the idea
of focusing on photography.

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
Nature photos as art.

40
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,500
But here's the thing:

41
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,767
I need everything in two months.

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,367
- Two months?
- This will lead

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,300
our fall collection.

44
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:41,734
Leave that to me.

45
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:44,300
But I need you
to get started ASAP.

46
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:47,266
- How many pages?
- A hundred or so photos

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,667
with very brief essays
this time.

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,133
Okay. As soon as
I get your contract.

49
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,400
It's all right here.

50
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,567
This could be the start
of a whole new line.

51
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,834
Zoe's Best of the West.

52
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:05,767
Yosemite... then Santa Fe,
Big Sur, the Rockies.

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,800
But Harris,

54
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:10,767
it's impossible to do
any better than Ansel Adams.

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,800
He was and always will be
Yosemite's master photographer.

56
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:17,300
And a national treasure.

57
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,533
But this book will be
your vision of Yosemite.

58
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,934
I know, it's just...

59
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,433
it's a little intimidating

60
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,767
following Ansel Adams'
footsteps.

61
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,133
This will be a breakout book
for you, Zoe.

62
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,533
I really believe it.

63
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Okay!

64
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
Awesome.

65
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:53,000
Hello?

66
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,000
Hello?!

67
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,367
- Zoe?
- Harris!

68
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Just checking to see
if you made it to Yosemite.

69
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:00,734
Yes, I, uh, got here
a couple hours ago.

70
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:02,033
The drive was fine.

71
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,867
I love it here already.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,433
Good, good.

73
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,100
Can't wait to see the photos.

74
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,667
Keep me posted.

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,633
Will do. Okay, bye!

76
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,400
Man...

77
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:38,967
- Hi, good morning.
- Good morning!

78
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,333
- My name is Zoe Best.
- Sage Morning Star.

79
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,533
It's my first visit,

80
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,934
and this place is spectacular.

81
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:47,066
Welcome to Yosemite.

82
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,333
Thanks!

83
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:49,700
Are you here for a permit?

84
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,000
- A permit?
- Yeah,

85
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:52,734
for campsites in the wilderness.

86
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,066
Oh, no, no, no.

87
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm working on a book.

88
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,066
My publisher sent me out here.

89
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,033
- A book on Yosemite?
- That's right.

90
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,100
I'm taking photos
of the park as it is today.

91
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, this place is
a photographer's dream.

92
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,967
It really is.

93
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,867
Listen, I was wondering.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,767
Do any of your park rangers
offer guided tours?

95
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,460
Oh yeah, there's
lots of organized hikes

96
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,734
led by rangers.

97
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,543
Well, I think I'm looking
more for a guide,

98
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,066
someone who understands
the ecosystem

99
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,066
and the famous landscapes.

100
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,800
You could hike to most of
the famous vistas from here.

101
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:24,533
You've got Yosemite Falls,
you've got the valley,

102
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:25,967
El Capitan from the Meadow.

103
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,734
Hm. That sounds easy enough.

104
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,667
But, hey, the ranger talks
really do help.

105
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,133
I would check it out.

106
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,667
Thank you so much.

107
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:36,734
Actually, I think
I might know someone

108
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:38,166
who can help you.

109
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,100
He knows the ecology
better than anyone.

110
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,667
He used to be a climber.

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,166
- A climber?
- A rock climber.

112
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,100
But he's sort of, um...
off the grid.

113
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,734
But if you can get
his attention,

114
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,033
he really knows his stuff.

115
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,934
I'm intrigued.
What's his name?

116
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,066
Jack Hawkins.

117
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,133
He's a naturalist.

118
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,166
A naturalist?

119
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,867
He knows the natural order
of things,

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,533
from plants to people.

121
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,633
My grandfather actually runs
this small little outfitter shop

122
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:04,934
just outside the park.

123
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,867
He might know
where to find Jack.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,133
Where's the shop?

125
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,233
Hello?

126
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:42,767
Over here.

127
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:50,867
There we go.

128
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,266
You ever seen a woolly bugger?

129
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,734
No, I think that's my first.

130
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:02,934
You lookin' for a guide?

131
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,834
As a matter of fact, I am.

132
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,633
Well, you've come
to the right place.

133
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,533
Springtime fishing is great,

134
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,033
but you're gonna need some help.

135
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,066
Oh! No, I'm...
I'm not here for the fishing.

136
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,633
I'm looking for a guide
named Jack Hawkins?

137
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:17,767
Are you?

138
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,133
Is he in some kind of trouble?

139
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,600
No, no, no, uh...

140
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,533
your granddaughter,
the park ranger?

141
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,867
- Sage?
- Yeah.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,266
She said that you might be able

143
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,800
to connect me with Jack.

144
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,233
Hm.

145
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:30,734
I haven't seen him
in a few weeks.

146
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:34,000
He pops up, then disappears.

147
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,200
Huh.

148
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:39,800
I, uh... the next time I see him,
I'll let him know

149
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,667
you were looking for him.

150
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,300
Thanks.

151
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:52,400
It's a great shop.

152
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:56,133
Do you get a lot of climbers
in here?

153
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:58,300
Oh yeah, all the time.

154
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,333
Hm.

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,567
I understand Jack is a climber.

156
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,900
Climber, guide, carpenter.

157
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,100
Interesting.

158
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,800
Jack's one of these
all-around capable guys.

159
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:12,567
Does a little bit of everything.

160
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,100
Do you happen to know
where he lives?

161
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:17,633
We did a blessing of his land,

162
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:18,967
up in the mountains.

163
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,233
A blessing?

164
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,800
I love that.

165
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:26,867
There's an unmarked road
back towards the park

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,867
off Highway 120,

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,800
just past Coldwater Springs,

168
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,133
on the left.

169
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,800
Thanks...

170
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,233
Kosimay Wilson.

171
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:39,033
Friends call me Kos.

172
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,834
Zoe Best.

173
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,066
It's lovely to meet you.

174
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,734
Zoe, give me your hand.

175
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:51,667
This will take you there.

176
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,433
Thank you.

177
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,400
Beethoven's Ninth

178
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,367
from Chicago's Orchestra Hall,
June 27th, 2017.

179
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,233
Bravo!

180
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:29,367
What the...

181
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,900
Bravo!

182
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,300
Stop that!

183
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:33,533
Okay, okay.

184
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,967
That was really magnificent.

185
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,100
Wait a minute.

186
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,233
First, you ruined my fishing,
and now this?

187
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,400
- That was you?
- Yeah!

188
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,800
I don't know who you are
or what you're doing here,

189
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:52,433
but now would be
a good time for you to leave.

190
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm sorry about the fishing,

191
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,967
but your performance
here today, wow.

192
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,133
Are you Jack Hawkins?

193
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,467
Yes.

194
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,834
I'm Zoe Best, a photojournalist.

195
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:08,767
Kos said I could find you here.

196
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Kos.

197
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah.

198
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:12,967
I don't care
what Kos said, okay?

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,300
It's time for you to leave.

200
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:20,200
Okay. I hear you
loud and clear.

201
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,533
Don't worry,
I'll show myself out.

202
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,200
Good. Bye!

203
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,867
You know, I was there,
by the way.

204
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,100
Orchestra Hall in Chicago,
June 2017.

205
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,166
It was incredible.

206
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,400
You know...

207
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,800
I was there too
at Orchestra Hall.

208
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,834
Best concert ever.

209
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,266
Top ten.

210
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,967
Are you from Chicago?

211
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,567
No. I was just there
that weekend for the concert.

212
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:03,600
What is it that you want?

213
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,200
I'm looking for a guide.

214
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,166
I do coffee table books
based on my photos.

215
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Picture books
for couch potatoes.

216
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,900
Uh, no!

217
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,200
People really like them.

218
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,533
Yeah, armchair adventurers.

219
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,467
My last book was on small towns.

220
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,467
It sold really well, too.

221
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,367
What do I know?

222
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
My next book...

223
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,834
Your next coffee table book.

224
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,800
Is on Yosemite.

225
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,567
I wanna capture the history.

226
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,100
John Muir,
how it was discovered.

227
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,400
Art-like photos of everything.

228
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:39,400
You know, a million photographers

229
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:40,967
have been here and done that.

230
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,433
Well, I just need help finding
the famous landscapes.

231
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,247
You should buy a map,
they're all on there.

232
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,066
I wanna go off-map.

233
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,367
Finding new
and different images.

234
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,900
This isn't a theme park, okay?

235
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:54,433
People die when they go
all gung-ho into the mountains.

236
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,467
Well, that's why I need you.

237
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,500
You know the park and I don't.

238
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,400
Fine. I get it.

239
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,667
You're not into it.

240
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,033
Probably not.

241
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,400
You know what I think?

242
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,000
No, I don't know what you think.

243
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:12,934
I think that you're naive
and a little dangerous.

244
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,400
But I also think
that you need some help.

245
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,367
How long do you need?

246
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,133
A week, give or take,
just to get the photos.

247
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,100
Okay.

248
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:29,900
Okay, you'll do it?

249
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:33,333
I'll do it, but I have one rule.

250
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,467
Which is?

251
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,367
You do what I say when I say it.

252
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,333
The mountains are dangerous.

253
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:40,066
You got yourself a deal.

254
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,500
We get started tomorrow.

255
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,600
Mm, a week from tomorrow.

256
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,467
After I take care
of a few things.

257
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,233
No, no, no, no,
I... I have a deadline.

258
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,934
We need to get started now.

259
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,100
Sorry!

260
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
This was a giant waste of time.

261
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:56,500
You know, I'm gonna go
discover Yosemite on my own.

262
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:58,533
Suit yourself.

263
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,266
Just be careful
where you're going.

264
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,500
Thanks...

265
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,166
for nothing.

266
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,166
- Morning.
- Hey!

267
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,567
- So, did you find a guide?
- Uh, that would be a no.

268
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Jack was tied up?

269
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,400
Jack was insufferable.

270
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,066
Yeah, he can be a little testy.

271
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,480
- A little?
- Well, he's got that

272
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,100
confirmed-bachelor edge.

273
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,633
But he's the best I know.

274
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,033
Too bad it didn't work out.

275
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,467
I did some research last night,

276
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,533
and I'll be just fine on my own.

277
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,200
You wouldn't happen to have
a map, would you?

278
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,800
Um, a few. Here.

279
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,033
Thanks.

280
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,643
I assume you're starting
with day hikes,

281
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,567
- no overnight permits needed?
- Right.

282
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,420
I'm going to take the trail
to Cascade Falls

283
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,734
and from what I read,

284
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,800
should be a pretty easy hike
on a beautiful day.

285
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:05,734
Careful... it gets a little
slippery up near the falls.

286
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,333
- Thanks, Sage.
- For sure.

287
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,467
Hello.

288
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:08,400
Gah! I'm stuck.

289
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,767
Help!

290
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,433
Help!

291
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:36,767
Help!

292
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,900
Help!

293
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,166
- Whoa there, bear.
- Help!

294
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,567
Go on, bear.

295
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,467
Get outta here, go on!

296
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,734
Help!

297
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,000
Help!

298
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:52,667
Help!

299
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,166
Help!

300
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,700
What are you doing down there?

301
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:06,900
Jack!

302
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,367
I'm stuck.

303
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:14,433
All right.

304
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,266
Gimme a minute, all right?

305
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,734
All right, Zoe, I'm gonna
throw the rope down.

306
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,000
Keep clear.

307
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
What happened?

308
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,600
My foot is stuck.

309
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,667
All right.

310
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,976
I'm gonna put some chalk on it

311
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
and it's gonna come
right out, all right?

312
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:08,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

313
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
- Ready?
- Yeah.

314
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:11,900
On three.

315
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,867
One, two, three!

316
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,567
Oh!

317
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,767
Thank you.

318
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,500
I thought I was a goner.

319
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:24,300
You know, that bear was
staring right at me.

320
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,734
Do you have food in your bag?

321
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,033
I had a protein bar.

322
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,467
You're lucky.
That's all I can say.

323
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,033
Now what?

324
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:42,000
- Start climbing.
- How?

325
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,700
You go hand over hand
and your feet will just follow.

326
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,333
What if I slip?

327
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:48,266
If you slip, I have the rope.

328
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,567
Just reestablish your footing
and keep going.

329
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,834
Okay.

330
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,433
Good, you're doing great.

331
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,033
Don't look down, look up.

332
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,700
Okay, Mr. Grouch.

333
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,834
Great.

334
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,433
All right, you're doing great.

335
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,000
Keep it up.

336
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,533
Almost there!

337
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,033
Yeah!

338
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,567
- Good job.
- Yes!

339
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,667
Okay.

340
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,533
I made it!

341
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,533
You must think
I'm a real knucklehead.

342
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:51,967
Yeah, something like that.

343
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,567
Someone said
they wouldn't help me!

344
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,633
Never go into the mountains alone.

345
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,066
Okay.

346
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,767
But you said
you wouldn't take me.

347
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,567
Don't even go there, okay?

348
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,734
You could have died.

349
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,600
Well, I didn't expect
to see a bear.

350
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:04,734
They live here.

351
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,934
We're the visitors.

352
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,666
Yeah, well, it'd be nice
if they'd let us

353
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
- just roam around.
- Most of the time, they do.

354
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:12,033
Just don't carry
unsealed food, okay,

355
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,033
especially protein bars.

356
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,600
I'm really, really grateful
you showed up.

357
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:18,800
Thank Sage.

358
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:20,066
Sage?

359
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,910
Yeah. You told her you were
hiking to Cascade Falls,

360
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:24,100
she got to worrying
you might do something stupid.

361
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:26,100
I don't know how
she got that idea.

362
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:31,633
You know,

363
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,367
you can stay mad at me,

364
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,100
but we're kinda bonded,
aren't we?

365
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,647
What are you talking about?

366
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,133
Well, you just saved my life.

367
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:44,100
That's kind of a bonding thing,
don't you think?

368
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,734
Jack.

369
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:54,467
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm truly grateful.

371
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:58,900
I don't know what I
would have done without you.

372
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,133
I'll give you five days.

373
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,934
That is it.

374
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:06,567
You will?

375
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,976
I'll take you
where you need to go,

376
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,233
you'll snap your photos,

377
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,800
you'll head back to Chicago
and never come back again.

378
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:14,200
Ah! What a charming proposal.

379
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh, and one more thing?

380
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:19,567
Gear.

381
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,867
You can't get where you wanna go
without these.

382
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:25,533
And this.

383
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:26,900
Are we expecting rain?

384
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:28,800
- Just trust me.
- Okay, is this where I go

385
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,000
from being a city girl
to a mountain girl?

386
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,700
Something like that.

387
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:37,100
There you go.

388
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,567
Here you go.

389
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,166
Changing room. That way.

390
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:23,667
Kos, looks like
I'm your best customer.

391
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,567
Today, you are my only customer.

392
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,000
Hate to ask, but when...

393
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:33,934
Tomorrow morning, 6 a.m.,
Sage's office.

394
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:36,700
I'll be there, all geared up.

395
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,000
Great.

396
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,834
- Hello!
- Hey!

397
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,233
So I heard you had
quite the adventure.

398
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:48,900
If you hadn't sent Jack,

399
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,533
I can't even think about it,
so... thank you.

400
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:52,876
You really need
to be careful out there.

401
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,967
Things do happen.

402
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,233
Yeah, and after all that,

403
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:56,734
he still agreed to be my guide.

404
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:58,967
Well, you'll be in good hands.

405
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,443
- Hello, by the way.
- Good morning.

406
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,367
You've met my grandfather, Kosimay.

407
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,000
It's nice to see you again.

408
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,100
Sometimes, Jack asks Kos
for advice.

409
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,967
He knows Yosemite
better than anyone.

410
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,734
I was born here.

411
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,700
My family goes way back.

412
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:14,133
- Four thousand years.
- Oh! Is that all?

413
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:15,266
Give or take.

414
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,533
We're part of the Miwok tribe.

415
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,467
- Good morning!
- Morning!

416
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,943
- Hey, Sage, how are you?
- Doing well.

417
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,242
- Nice to see you, Jack.
- Yeah, you too.

418
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:23,667
Well, if you guys need any help
with your planning,

419
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,142
just let me know,
I'll be over there.

420
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,033
Awesome.

421
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,300
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Sage.

422
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:29,000
And thank you for stopping by.

423
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:30,233
He knows every trail.

424
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:31,900
- Don't you?
- Most.

425
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:33,934
Here you go.

426
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,166
I wanna make things official.

427
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,667
Five days.

428
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,667
Looks good to me.

429
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,934
Let's get started.

430
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:41,033
Here's a list of the places
I wanna visit.

431
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,667
The closer I can get,
the better.

432
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,166
Yosemite Falls, El Capitan,
Cathedral Rocks...

433
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
No problem.

434
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:48,633
Yeah, I think we can knock

435
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,276
the first three or four
of these off today.

436
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,166
Really?

437
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,567
That's the good news.

438
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,667
Tenaya Creek,
very hard to predict.

439
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:59,633
See, right here, easy access,

440
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,233
but shadows, clouds, mists,
who knows?

441
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:05,800
Well, we can at least try, right?

442
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:07,900
- What do you think?
- Maybe,

443
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,133
depending on the weather.

444
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,700
I have this idea.

445
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,800
I wanna get a photo
of Half Dome,

446
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:16,367
one that no one
has ever taken before.

447
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,300
That's only the most
photographed mountain

448
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:19,767
in the world.

449
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,166
- Even Jack managed a shot.
- Oh.

450
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,734
Half Dome at dawn.

451
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:27,367
Getting close to Half Dome
can be real hard.

452
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,300
But there's a great view
from Mirror Lake.

453
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,066
That's a great idea, Kos.

454
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,033
You need his blessing
and his wisdom.

455
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,900
- Hm.
- Thank you.

456
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:39,133
All right, let's get going.

457
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,100
Did you remember your rain gear?

458
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,367
You know it.

459
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,300
Wow.

460
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:09,133
Yosemite Falls.

461
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:10,667
What a shot.

462
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:16,100
I'll use my 4x5 camera for this.

463
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,533
It's a wide-angle lens.

464
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,600
Great for landscapes.

465
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:26,967
This is the shutter control.

466
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
See the bellows?

467
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:30,934
I love this camera.

468
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,333
Now.

469
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,266
Viewfinder...

470
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,200
Okay, now focus...

471
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,166
This is incredible.

472
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,300
There it is.

473
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,367
Wow.

474
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,533
The quintessential
Yosemite photo.

475
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:56,166
It's almost too easy.

476
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,633
Get your rain gear on,
we'll get a little closer.

477
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:06,433
I've never seen
anything like it.

478
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,133
All those boulders?

479
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,300
It's called talus.

480
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:11,333
It's been here since
the last ice age.

481
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:12,967
They're huge!

482
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,166
You can't see from here,

483
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,810
but there are two more
waterfalls up above.

484
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:17,667
The falls are terraced?

485
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,533
Yeah.

486
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,066
The noise is overpowering.

487
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,967
The fountain of life.

488
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,500
Magical.

489
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:27,100
Huh!

490
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:44,200
Hey! None of me.

491
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,367
Please?

492
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,633
Nope.

493
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,233
Look, this book isn't just about
nice scenery.

494
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:52,433
It's about people like you
trying to conserve it.

495
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:55,000
Later, okay?

496
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,066
Come on, one shot.

497
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,066
I hate posed photos.

498
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,467
So don't pose.

499
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,300
Just jump up there
and look like a guy.

500
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,266
Perfect!

501
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,500
You handle those cameras
pretty well.

502
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:33,533
Tools of the trade.

503
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,066
So what are you?

504
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,233
A journalist or a photographer?

505
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,066
I went online.

506
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,567
Oh, you did?

507
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,767
My first love was painting.

508
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,300
That's why I went to art school,

509
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,367
but then I realized
that you can't make a living

510
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,734
as a fine artist.

511
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,066
Yeah, not easy.

512
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,643
Yeah, so I took some
photography classes

513
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,166
and I realized
I have an eye for it.

514
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,300
I'm sort of a tech geek.

515
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:59,066
So no training?

516
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,867
Well, I was in journalism
before I went to art school.

517
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,467
So lemme get this straight.

518
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,500
Your goal is to find
Yosemite's famous locations

519
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:10,066
and take artsy photos.

520
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,300
I am an artist.

521
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:15,834
My goal is to find new ways
to capture interesting images.

522
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:18,166
Hm. Well, I'm a scientist.

523
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,600
Wait.

524
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,700
I thought you were a musician,
you know,

525
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,734
conducting the orchestra?

526
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,667
Okay, you got me.

527
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,500
Music is my passion,
especially classical.

528
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:31,343
Don't get me wrong,
I love your art and all,

529
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:34,200
but your photos just don't tell
the whole story.

530
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,567
What do you mean?

531
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,233
I mean, Yosemite's ecology
is changing.

532
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,166
There are conservation issues,
environmental concerns.

533
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,400
Well, I was focused on the art.

534
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,533
Gotcha.

535
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:49,734
I saw your article
about water conservation.

536
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,734
I Googled you too.

537
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:55,467
- Huh.
- And I also saw

538
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,166
that you wrote a book
called Conserving the West.

539
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,300
What's that about?

540
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,800
Sustainability.

541
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:03,700
Of the park?

542
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:04,934
Of the West.

543
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:09,500
Its water, its land,
including Yosemite.

544
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,767
Huh. That's interesting.

545
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,767
The science, you know, conservation.

546
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,533
It's about testing
and measuring, you know?

547
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,300
Data analysis.

548
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:21,567
Your art, your photos
are beautiful,

549
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,867
but science reveals
what's inside the photo.

550
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,266
Okay, well,
this might surprise you,

551
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,767
but I'm intrigued by all that.

552
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,300
Do you ever collaborate,
you know, with other writers?

553
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,233
Not big on collaboration.

554
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:37,834
Oh, all good.
I don't need your help.

555
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:39,643
Look, I can get you
to the famous locations,

556
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,433
then you're on your own.

557
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,300
Great. Just how I like it.

558
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:46,033
So are there any places that
show conservation at work?

559
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:48,800
Oh, so now you want my help?

560
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:51,734
Well, only because
you're Mr. Conservation.

561
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,533
Hey.

562
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:55,907
I can show you what's happening,

563
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,834
just no collaboration.

564
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,266
I wouldn't think of it!

565
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,934
- Good.
- Mm!

566
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,300
Look at those spires.

567
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,834
It looks like they're
reaching for the heavens.

568
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,867
Cathedral spires.

569
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,800
When John Muir arrived here
in the 1860s

570
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:21,300
and saw this valley,

571
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:23,266
it was a full-on
religious experience.

572
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,800
Feel like I'm having one
right now.

573
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:26,533
"The range of light."

574
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,200
That's what he called
the Sierras.

575
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,600
I mean, being here was like
being in a cathedral.

576
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,300
Every read any John Muir?

577
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:36,266
I started reading
My First Summer in the Sierras

578
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,934
on the plane.

579
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,500
I love his writing.

580
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:40,700
He was a scientist,

581
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,467
but he connected man's soul
to nature.

582
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,667
It's where he found God.

583
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
Huh.

584
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,567
"The grand show is eternal."

585
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,066
That's how he described Yosemite.

586
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:53,743
When I was driving
through the tunnel

587
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,266
into the valley,

588
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,633
it was sort of like
a religious experience.

589
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,467
That's a gift.

590
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,367
Like the Garden of Eden.

591
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,620
And our job is to protect it.

592
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,834
And my job is to capture it.

593
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,633
Nice!

594
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,133
Come on.

595
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:19,700
There's a great spot for
an artsy photo of El Capitan.

596
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,233
Hey!

597
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:30,834
Wait up, roadrunner!

598
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,934
We got a schedule to keep.

599
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:34,066
Hi.

600
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,700
Merced River's at its best
this time of year.

601
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:39,867
How's the fishing?

602
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,033
I wouldn't know.

603
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:43,266
Someone's phone
scared them all away.

604
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,533
Oh, yeah. Uh, okay.

605
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:53,133
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

606
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,767
El Capitan.

607
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:58,867
How's that?

608
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,200
Right in your own back yard.

609
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:04,266
Do you ever take it for granted?

610
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,100
I take it all for granite.

611
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,533
Really?

612
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:13,567
Sorry, bad pun, okay?

613
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,734
Look, I get to see new things
every day.

614
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:19,600
Weather patterns,
changing of the seasons.

615
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:21,094
- I get it.
- But there's a harmony

616
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,767
to this place,
how it all blends.

617
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,700
It's almost mystical.

618
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:28,033
The sheer cliff is stunning.

619
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,533
El Cap.

620
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,827
It's like a massive anchor
holding everything in place.

621
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,734
And people climb the face?

622
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:34,867
Every day.

623
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,000
When I drove by yesterday,

624
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:40,767
there must have been
50 photographers

625
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,867
in the Meadow taking photos.

626
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,467
Yup. All trying to be
Ansel Adams,

627
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,633
none of 'em coming even close.

628
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,467
That's exactly how I feel.

629
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,900
El Capitan above the Meadow.

630
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,734
Art?

631
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,000
Art.

632
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,033
Hey, look.

633
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,800
About halfway up.

634
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:10,266
Oh, I see them!

635
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,133
How do they do that?

636
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:17,100
Lotta chalk and strong forearms.

637
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:18,533
They look like toy figures

638
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,100
against a fake backdrop.

639
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,967
They're very real.

640
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,700
Over 30 people have been killed
trying to summit El Capitan.

641
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:27,767
Wow.

642
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,400
Sage said you're a climber.

643
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,100
I was.

644
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,233
Have you ever scaled El Capitan?

645
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:40,734
Several times.

646
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,734
Insane.

647
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:45,166
Yeah, it's not for everyone.

648
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:47,934
Hey.

649
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:50,146
Do you think I could go
to the basecamp or something?

650
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,834
I would love to take some photos
of the climbers.

651
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:58,700
Yeah. I'll take you to Camp 4
where they all hang out.

652
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:01,266
It's a good bit
of social history as well.

653
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,834
- Let's do it.
- All right.

654
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,900
So cool.

655
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,600
You know, in climbing circles,

656
00:36:15,734 --> 00:36:17,934
Camp 4 is Mecca.

657
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:19,867
It started after World War II.

658
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,800
Some burnt-out soldiers
moved here.

659
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:23,300
Some became climbers,

660
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,333
others were just hanging out.

661
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:27,200
What did the park rangers think?

662
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,166
Well, there was tension
for years.

663
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,567
The rangers tried to evict 'em

664
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,633
but the Gis just wouldn't leave.

665
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:34,900
What happened?

666
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:37,667
Well, one year,
the river flooded,

667
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,133
washed away a lot
of the staff cottages,

668
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:43,333
so the park services built
a dormitory over here.

669
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,767
Suddenly, the park rangers had
a strong presence in Camp 4.

670
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,100
And the climbers?

671
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:49,967
Today, it's first come,
first served

672
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,333
for a seven-day permit.

673
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:00,066
Howdy.

674
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,200
- How's it going?
- Good.

675
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,667
How's the climbing today?

676
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,233
- Splitter.
- Right on.

677
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:06,233
Either one of you guys
summit El Cap?

678
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:07,400
I did last summer.

679
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:08,967
Yeah, me too.

680
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,300
She went the nose route.

681
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,667
In the rain.

682
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,834
Any ascent of El Cap is major.

683
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:15,233
Totally.

684
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,767
Uh, I'm doing
a photo book on Yosemite

685
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,042
and I'm wondering
if I could grab

686
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:20,333
a few shots of you two?

687
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,633
- Sure.
- Sure.

688
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:22,767
Awesome.

689
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,033
Hey, where you from?

690
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,066
- Chicago.
- Me too!

691
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,133
- No kidding.
- Clark Street.

692
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:30,000
Lincoln Park.

693
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,133
What's your name?

694
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,400
Uh, Zoe Best.

695
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:33,767
Ah! I have your book.

696
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,000
Super good.

697
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:36,233
You should put us in.

698
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,934

Absolutely!

721
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:41,900
You know, I love
that kind of serendipity.

722
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,934
Let me ask you,
'cause you're a climber.

723
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:45,066
Why do they do it?

724
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,500
It's just so insane.

725
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:50,500
Well, there's free climbing
with ropes and harnesses.

726
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:52,166
That's what I used to do.

727
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
It's fun.

728
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
And dangerous.

729
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,333
Not if you're cautious
and prepared.

730
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,400
And some climbers don't use
ropes or anything?

731
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:02,166
That's free soloing.

732
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,500
I did a little bit of that.

733
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,266
Never again.

734
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,467
Wow.

735
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,520
El Capitan is one
of the most difficult

736
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:11,967
rock climbs in the world,

737
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,233
but that's what draws people.

738
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:16,200
I guess it's all about
the challenge.

739
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:19,800
As for me, I like to keep
my feet on the ground.

740
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:21,100
Well, come on.

741
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,142
I'll get you to a mountaintop,
no climbing needed.

742
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,967
Oh, sounds like
my kind of mountain.

743
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:46,300
That's Half Dome
in the distance.

744
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,400
I've run out of superlatives.

745
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:52,133
Hey, check it out.

746
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:56,533
Aww.

747
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:08,200
Aww, I love this photo!

748
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,133
Sometimes,
Mother Nature shows off.

749
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:21,200
She's putting on quite the show.

750
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:23,333
You know,

751
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:25,433
it's hard not to appreciate
the park founders.

752
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:28,233
I mean, their entire goal
was to preserve and conserve.

753
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,100
I want my photos
to tell that story.

754
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:35,467
Oh. So they're not just
art for art's sake.

755
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,433
Places like Yosemite,
where nature is protected...

756
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:44,100
it is a great model
for sustainability.

757
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:50,266
Landscapes are for observation
and conservation.

758
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,266
Not just beauty,
but what's inside the photo.

759
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:56,133
Art and science.

760
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:58,934
If we're good to the land,

761
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:01,233
then the land will be
good to us.

762
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:07,567
Oh. I almost forgot.

763
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,100
Sage invited us over for dinner.

764
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:12,600
Well, more you than me, but...

765
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:14,433
I figure I'll tag along.

766
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,734
A home-cooked meal sounds great.

767
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,400
We're here!

768
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:27,700
Come on in!

769
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,433
Nice to see you again.

770
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:33,867
Nice to see you!

771
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,367
I'm so glad
you guys could make it.

772
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,767
Thanks for having us.

773
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,266
This place looks great.

774
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,633
Staff housing.

775
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:42,200
You know, those WPA guys really
knew how to build a cabin.

776
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,900
I love the Craftsman look.

777
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:45,467
Come on, make yourselves
at home.

778
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Uh, Jack, there's wine
on the table for y'all.

779
00:41:47,734 --> 00:41:49,333
Awesome. Thanks.

780
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:52,767
Um, so, how was your day?

781
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,400
Now I know how Alice felt

782
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:56,633
when she arrived in Wonderland.

783
00:41:58,367 --> 00:41:59,367
Look at that!

784
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:01,467
"Moon and Half Dome."

785
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,967
You know, I've taken
some spectacular shots,

786
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,400
but none of them are this good.

787
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,567
Ansel Adams was
something special.

788
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,640
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

789
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:13,967
So, any highlights
from your day?

790
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,700
The whole day was a highlight!

791
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,967
But I loved getting close
to El Capitan.

792
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,400
- And Cathedral Rocks.
- Mm, where we met John Muir.

793
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:24,600
Jack's muse.

794
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:26,600
We all follow in his footsteps.

795
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:29,567
You know, back in the day,

796
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,400
developers had turned Yosemite
into a tourist trap.

797
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:34,800
- Really?
- Yeah, it's true.

798
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:38,433
So John Muir knew he had
to do something about it,

799
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:41,500
so when Teddy Roosevelt
visited in 1903,

800
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:44,667
he took him camping
down in Mariposa Grove.

801
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,567
That photo's incredible.

802
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,433
That camping trip
led to the preservation

803
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,767
of Yosemite Valley.

804
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,266
It's true.

805
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
No John Muir,

806
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,834
no Yosemite National Park.

807
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,767
Here's to John Muir.

808
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,066
And to those who were here
before him.

809
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,100
- Aho.
- Aho.

810
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:12,900
I see that you've added
to your library.

811
00:43:13,934 --> 00:43:15,667
Zoe's Best of the Midwest.

812
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Yeah, I picked it up
at the Ansel Adams Gallery.

813
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:20,500
I didn't know that.

814
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:21,767
Thanks, Sage.

815
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,066
I understand why
you're like focusing

816
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,900
on Yosemite's landscapes,

817
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:29,000
but most of the photos
in your book are of people.

818
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:30,600
I want to get beauty shots,

819
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:33,300
but I also like human stories.

820
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:36,700
Like, today we ran into climbers
at El Capitan.

821
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:39,533
I had to restrain her from
getting into a harness herself.

822
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,066
The climbers had great stories.

823
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,000
Maybe your book
can also tell our story.

824
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,300
Absolutely.

825
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:49,333
It's part of history, right?

826
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:51,600
I like your Alice in Wonderland analogy.

827
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:54,367
You know the line
"curiouser and curiouser"?

828
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,066
When you dig below
the surface here,

829
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,500
it can get a little complicated.

830
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:00,800
Like?

831
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:04,100
White people tend to think
they discovered Yosemite.

832
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:06,400
It was never undiscovered.

833
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:08,700
My great-grandfather
was born here,

834
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:11,500
and his father was born here
as well.

835
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:15,767
The Ahwahnechee
were here all along.

836
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,633
Ahwahnechee?

837
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,834
The original people
of Yosemite Valley.

838
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:21,600
Part of the Miwok tribe.

839
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:23,734
There were hundreds of them
living here, right?

840
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:26,533
Their cedar huts were scattered
throughout the valley.

841
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,100
One family here,
another family there.

842
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,834
Plenty of fish and deer
for food.

843
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:34,100
It was a good place.

844
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:36,667
Then the miners arrived
during the Gold Rush,

845
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,967
thought they'd discovered paradise.

846
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,600
That's when trouble began.

847
00:44:41,734 --> 00:44:46,133
There were a lot of tragedies,
and not just a culture clash.

848
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,000
As I understand it, there was
a bounty on our people.

849
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:53,867
A vigilante group
called the Mariposa Brigade

850
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,400
led sort of an invasion
of Yosemite.

851
00:44:56,533 --> 00:44:59,900
Many were killed
or forced onto reservations.

852
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,266
That's so sad.

853
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,133
America's past is not perfect.

854
00:45:06,266 --> 00:45:11,000
It's complicated,
and there is a lot of pain,

855
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:13,433
but it's all a part
of its story.

856
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:16,967
Do any Indigenous people
still live in the park?

857
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,700
The last were gone by the 1960s.

858
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:25,600
But their spirit is still here.

859
00:45:26,967 --> 00:45:28,734
They'll never leave.

860
00:45:30,266 --> 00:45:33,533
I want to take photos of some
of the historical places.

861
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,000
There's plenty in the park.

862
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,166
Tenaya Lake and Creek.

863
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,867
The Ahwahnee Hotel
and even Half Dome.

864
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,033
And as they say, a picture's
worth a thousand words,

865
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,967
if it's the right picture.

866
00:45:55,033 --> 00:45:57,500
- Harris.
- I'm looking for John Muir.

867
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:58,500
Is he around?

868
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:01,133
- He's everywhere.
- Good, good.

869
00:46:01,266 --> 00:46:04,200
- He's the man, you know.
- So I hear.

870
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:05,767
You need to dig
into his writing.

871
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,233
I'm on it.

872
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:10,600
I'm also digging into
the Native American past.

873
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,967
It's tragic but it's important.

874
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,834
I agree.

875
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:16,200
So it's going well?

876
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,934
This place is spectacular.

877
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:22,500
I mean, you should see
El Capitan.

878
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:23,700
Send some photos.

879
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:27,166
We ran into some climbers
scaling the wall.

880
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,900
It's intense.

881
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:31,133
- Did you find a guide?
- I did!

882
00:46:31,266 --> 00:46:32,834
Yeah, he's an interesting guy.

883
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:34,233
Former rock climber.

884
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:35,500
I think you'd like him.

885
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:39,734
- He was even quoting John Muir.
- Hm, sounds perfect.

886
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:41,767
Yeah, he also did some writing.

887
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,600
Wrote a book called
Conserving the West.

888
00:46:44,734 --> 00:46:47,867
- Hm, I've heard of it.
- And we're just getting started.

889
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,834
I can't wait to see
where it leads.

890
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:51,867
Don't forget your deadline.

891
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,033
Right.

892
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,767
Right, right.

893
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,600
I'm on it.

894
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm just imagining 200 years ago

895
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:12,166
when the Ahwahnechee people
lived here.

896
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,967
They just picked
such a beautiful place.

897
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,367
So peaceful.

898
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:20,734
Yeah, it's like Sage said.

899
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:22,767
History can be painful,

900
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:24,934
but the more we know
about our past

901
00:47:25,066 --> 00:47:26,800
the stronger our future can be.

902
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:28,042
- How's this?
- Yeah, that's great.

903
00:47:28,066 --> 00:47:29,700
- Great.
- Perfect.

904
00:47:30,734 --> 00:47:33,867
I went to the gallery today.

905
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,333
A present.

906
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:41,934
Conserving the West
by Jack Hawkins.

907
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:44,066
Thank you.

908
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,233
You're welcome.

909
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:51,066
There's a whole section
on water conservation.

910
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,700
Our most important resource.

911
00:47:56,867 --> 00:47:58,266
Look.

912
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,367
I know I said
I don't need your help,

913
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,900
but I was wrong.

914
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:06,734
You know more about Yosemite
than I ever will.

915
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:09,033
How 'bout you help
co-write the book with me?

916
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:14,100
Like I said, I'm not big
on collaboration.

917
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:15,100
I know.

918
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:16,266
But...

919
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,233
If I were to get involved,

920
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:22,200
I write as a scientist
and you write as a journalist.

921
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,367
And you're good, too.

922
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,767
Thanks.

923
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,433
But I don't think our styles
would mesh.

924
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:33,133
How about you write sections
under your name

925
00:48:33,266 --> 00:48:35,133
and I write sections
under my name?

926
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:38,600
I might go deeper than you want.

927
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:39,734
I'll take my chances.

928
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:42,867
This might work out.

929
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,867
You can highlight conservation

930
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,367
and help me find photos
to go with your points.

931
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:52,767
Maybe.

932
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,367
I do have one ground rule though.

933
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,900
Here we go.

934
00:48:58,033 --> 00:48:59,200
I'm in charge.

935
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:02,233
You do what I say when I say it.

936
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,200
You're the book boss,
I'm the trail boss.

937
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:06,133
Even-steven!

938
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:07,533
Okay, Zoe Best.

939
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,867
You got yourself a partner.

940
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,100
Yes!

941
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,867
Woo!

942
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:36,767
That shot is incredible.

943
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:39,800
Do you see that rainbow?

944
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,333
We do what we can.

945
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:53,433
Jack.

946
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:55,407
I think this is the best photo
I've ever taken.

947
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Really?

948
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,200
It's pure magic.

949
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,166
Ah.

950
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,133
Is this your
art-at-a-new-level shot

951
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:08,266
for the cover?

952
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:11,100
Maybe.

953
00:50:11,233 --> 00:50:14,300
Well, I'm glad for you, seriously.

954
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:17,233
I've always wanted to know
what's at the end of a rainbow.

955
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,467
Me too.

956
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Woo!

957
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,967
Careful.

958
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:34,934
Woo!

959
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,166
Whoa!

960
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:39,033
Careful, Zoe.

961
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,166
- Oh.
- You all right?

962
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,467
- Yeah, sorry.
- It's all right.

963
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,280
Let's just take a break
for a minute, yeah?

964
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,533
- Okay.
- Yeah.

965
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:54,300
Everybody should have
a guide like you.

966
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:56,600
You've been awesome.

967
00:50:57,633 --> 00:51:00,934
Well, I bet you say that
to all the boys.

968
00:51:01,066 --> 00:51:04,066
I do, but this time
I actually mean it.

969
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,280
Well, I don't love guiding,

970
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,400
but sometimes it works out.

971
00:51:07,533 --> 00:51:09,233
Thanks to your friend Sage.

972
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:10,567
I'm glad she connected us.

973
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,376
Yeah, you weren't so happy
on that first day.

974
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,133
You were such a grouch.

975
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:15,546
Yeah, you were invading
my space.

976
00:51:15,633 --> 00:51:16,867
I needed a little help.

977
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,009
Yeah, you were pretty lost.

978
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,333
I was lost.

979
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:21,467
I was hoping that you would
just turn back around

980
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,133
and head back to Chicago.

981
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:25,533
And now?

982
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:28,100
And now...

983
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:33,500
I'm seeing the park
through your eyes, as art.

984
00:51:34,934 --> 00:51:35,934
And I love it.

985
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:43,000
Sage says that you are
a confirmed bachelor

986
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,000
who lives alone in the woods.

987
00:51:47,233 --> 00:51:48,467
I'm happy.

988
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,040
Okay, so I'm just gonna
ask you this.

989
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:53,600
Between us and the mountains...

990
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,600
Does it ever get lonely living
there alone all year round?

991
00:52:01,734 --> 00:52:03,433
No.

992
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:04,967
No, I mean...

993
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,100
It just seems like...

994
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,567
There's plenty going on
even in the winter.

995
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:13,266
But no love life up here?

996
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,376
If you're trying to make me
a profile in your book,

997
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,509
let's just stop right there.

998
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,433
I agreed to write about
Yosemite, not about me.

999
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:22,700
No, it's just inquiring minds
want to know.

1000
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,900
Have you ever been in love?

1001
00:52:26,033 --> 00:52:27,100
Are you always this nosey?

1002
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:28,300
I'm a journalist.

1003
00:52:30,633 --> 00:52:31,500
No.

1004
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:33,500
You're kidding.

1005
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:35,367
You asked, I answered.

1006
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,367
And the reason is...

1007
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,500
I don't need a reason.

1008
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:44,066
So you like living alone?

1009
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,367
- How 'bout you?
- Me?

1010
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
Yeah.

1011
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:53,367
Well, if I'm gonna be honest...
my work is my love.

1012
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,934
Okay, well...

1013
00:52:58,066 --> 00:53:01,967
There was Harley, a sculptor
I met in art school.

1014
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,700
But that didn't work out.

1015
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:05,266
And then there was Billy.

1016
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,776
Well, actually,
there were two Billys,

1017
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,600
but I didn't really love them.

1018
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:11,266
Look, I guess
I'm just old school.

1019
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,066
I have a different view
of what love actually is.

1020
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,000
You know how I'm about nature
and weather patterns

1021
00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:20,767
and what each day brings
to Yosemite?

1022
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,800
I do now.

1023
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,066
Well, for me
it's all about the land

1024
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,900
and the details within it.

1025
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:29,633
And if I ever do fall in love,

1026
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:31,600
it'll be because
of the little things.

1027
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,600
Do her eyes sparkle
when she laughs,

1028
00:53:34,734 --> 00:53:38,333
and does her smile
touch my soul?

1029
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:41,633
What sounds does she make
when she's sleeping?

1030
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:43,967
And how does she react
to a sunrise

1031
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,567
over a mountain ridge,
or when the Alpine glow

1032
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,967
washes over the face
of Half Dome?

1033
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,033
What brings her joy, you know,

1034
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:53,967
and how does she accept sadness?

1035
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,934
And what does she see
that I don't see?

1036
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,676
When I wake up next to her
in the morning,

1037
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,500
am I excited to share
a new day with her?

1038
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:05,633
And is there this unspoken look
between us that says,

1039
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:08,033
"Yes, the world
is a better place

1040
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,133
because we're in it together."

1041
00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:14,467
It'll be like that, you know.

1042
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,667
The details.

1043
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:20,053
I guess you never
really thought of it.

1044
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,400
Look.

1045
00:54:25,633 --> 00:54:26,734
The Alpine glow.

1046
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:30,266
It's beautiful.

1047
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:33,834
Exactly perfect.

1048
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,500
Look.

1049
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:39,993
I have an idea
if you're up for it.

1050
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:42,367
Try me.

1051
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,633
There's this great little
country dive bar

1052
00:54:44,767 --> 00:54:46,700
not too far from here.

1053
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:49,200
Food's pretty good
and there's live music tonight.

1054
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,500
I'm in.

1055
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,400
So, are you getting
what you need?

1056
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:16,467
I have a ton of beauty shots
and a lot of stories, but...

1057
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,700
I still need that one photo
that takes it to another level.

1058
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,066
Hmm.

1059
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,240
We're still on art patrol.

1060
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:25,500
Something like that.

1061
00:55:26,633 --> 00:55:27,734
Mm.

1062
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,500
You sure were right
about the food.

1063
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:31,166
I'm glad you like it.

1064
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:34,734
This place is amazing.

1065
00:55:34,867 --> 00:55:37,600
What, no country bars
in Chicago?

1066
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,100
Not like this.

1067
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:42,400
Grab your partners, ladies.

1068
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:43,533

his winters alone?

Yeah.

1081
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,233
For that guy.

1082

Hm.

1084
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,533
For a Chicago girl
who doesn't get out much?

1085
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,500
Yeah, for that girl.

The rainbow photo is incredible.

1096
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:25,500
Thanks.

1097
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:26,700
I love that one too.

1098
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:28,800
Zoe, this book's
gonna be spectacular.

1099
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:30,834
I'm excited.

1100
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:32,467
Have you found
the structure yet?

1101
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,467
I mean, the shots look great,
but where's the book heading?

1102
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,700
I'm not sure.

1103
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:40,266
I'm adding a conservation angle
with Jack

1104
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,700
and I'm building
an emotional arc

1105
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,367
about the people I've met.

1106
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,367
- I still need that one photo.
- To show off the park.

1107
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,867
To show that I'm an artist,
not just another photographer.

1108
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,300
What about the park
and what it means?

1109
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:57,734
Don't worry,
it's all about the park.

1110
00:57:57,867 --> 00:58:01,000
I just want an image that soars.

1111
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,734
Sounds good.

1112
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:05,300
How's Jack working out?

1113
00:58:05,433 --> 00:58:07,266
Better than
I could have imagined.

1114
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,734
He just have all this insight
about the land.

1115
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:15,567
In fact, I have asked him
to co-write the book with me.

1116
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,834
- Really?
- Yeah.

1117
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:18,734
I think he's perfect.

1118
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:20,567
Keep those photos comin'.

1119
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,700
I will.

1120
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:22,734
Bye.

1121
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:26,667
Yes.

1122
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:28,967
Back when I was rock climbing,

1123
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,467
I used to come down here
to swim,

1124
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,667
just to cool off.

1125
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,567
Have you always lived up here
near the park?

1126
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,934
I've been coming up here
since I was a kid.

1127
00:58:37,066 --> 00:58:40,400
My father taught biology
at Cal State Sacramento.

1128
00:58:40,533 --> 00:58:42,867
We spent our summers here
camping and hiking.

1129
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,834
I caught the climbing bug.

1130
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:46,567
Your parents let you?

1131
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,734
Not at first.

1132
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:49,467
I majored in Natural Science
at Berkeley,

1133
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,920
but my father always complained
I was majoring in climbing.

1134
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:53,900
Sounds like you were.

1135
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:56,767
Well, I climbed my way
through graduate school.

1136
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,934
That's when I became interested
in conservation.

1137
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:01,800
And started writing about it.

1138
00:59:01,934 --> 00:59:03,433
Writing was like climbing.

1139
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:05,367
Put one step in front of another

1140
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,533
and then another,

1141
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:09,100
and pretty soon I had
a best-selling book.

1142
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:12,767
That's how you got
your mountain cabin.

1143
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,633
Somethin' like that.

1144
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:15,876
Let's talk about you, though,

1145
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,333
and what you're missing,
that photo.

1146
00:59:19,734 --> 00:59:22,533
What about that shot
of the rainbow at the falls?

1147
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:24,233
I love it, but...

1148
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:26,633
Mm, doesn't define you
as an artist.

1149
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,433
I need a photo of Half Dome,

1150
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:31,000
one that no one
has ever gotten before.

1151
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:33,667
I am really stuck on this one.

1152
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,500
What if we backpack
towards Half Dome?

1153
00:59:36,533 --> 00:59:37,400
Let's do it.

1154
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:38,400
All right.

1155
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,667
Let's check in with Kos.

1156
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,767
We need some gear
and he may have an idea or two.

1157
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,100
- Okay.
- All right.

1158
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,567
I saw this photo of Half Dome
in your book.

1159
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,967
It's a beauty.

1160
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,467
I got lucky one day.

1161
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,600
It's nice but there's a million
just like it.

1162
00:59:59,734 --> 01:00:01,567
I think it's a masterpiece.

1163
01:00:02,934 --> 01:00:05,767
Think of all the times
you've seen Half Dome.

1164
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,967
Do you ever see anything new?

1165
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,900
I always look for the face.

1166
01:00:10,967 --> 01:00:11,967
The face?

1167
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,500
A legend has been passed down

1168
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:15,100
about a woman named Tis-sa-ack

1169
01:00:15,233 --> 01:00:16,734
who quarreled with her husband.

1170
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:18,100
She was very upset,

1171
01:00:18,233 --> 01:00:22,767
so she ran off to the east
and formed a huge mountain.

1172
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,467
But her tears of guilt
forever stained her face.

1173
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,760
You see what happens if you...

1174
01:00:28,867 --> 01:00:30,367
Don't go there, Jack.

1175
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,934
I'm just saying.

1176
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:35,033
Later, her name got changed
to Half Dome.

1177
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:36,734
And from a certain angle,

1178
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:40,667
you can see her face
and the tear stains.

1179
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,133
But getting that photo,
well, I don't know.

1180
01:00:45,533 --> 01:00:47,066
That's it.

1181
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,934
That's the photo I need to get
of her face.

1182
01:00:51,066 --> 01:00:54,367
The problem is,
Half Dome faces west.

1183
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,940
Most photos are taken
from the south,

1184
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:57,033
from the John Muir Trail,

1185
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,333
- right?
- That's right.

1186
01:00:58,467 --> 01:01:00,700
That's where Jack took
his photo.

1187
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:03,667
From Nevada Falls.

1188
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,000
Long ago, my grandfather
helped John Muir

1189
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:08,834
create a different trail
all the way to Half Dome.

1190
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:10,633
- From the west?
- Right.

1191
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,400
But that trail was closed.

1192
01:01:13,533 --> 01:01:16,066
Yeah, the Park Service
closed that trail

1193
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,600
several years ago
because of a big accident.

1194
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,667
So, that's it, there's no way
for me to take the photo

1195
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,367
- of her face from the west?
- Not safely.

1196
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:30,867
What's that saying,
"the better part of valor"?

1197
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,133
So, I guess that's that.

1198
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:34,467
'Fraid so.

1199
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,400
The idea hit me
early this morning.

1200
01:01:47,533 --> 01:01:48,943
He called and said
the look on your face

1201
01:01:48,967 --> 01:01:50,600
yesterday hurt his heart.

1202
01:01:51,633 --> 01:01:52,734
Kos.

1203
01:01:54,867 --> 01:01:56,700
Thanks.

1204
01:01:56,834 --> 01:01:58,600
So what's the idea?

1205
01:01:58,734 --> 01:02:02,133
When I was a boy,
my grandfather took me camping

1206
01:02:02,266 --> 01:02:03,934
way up Tenaya Creek.

1207
01:02:04,066 --> 01:02:07,033
That's when he told me
about the old trail.

1208
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:09,567
- The one that's closed?
- Past that one.

1209
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,900
It's a long hike,
but we kept going,

1210
01:02:12,033 --> 01:02:14,033
above the creek,
up a little ridge,

1211
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:15,734
and there it was.

1212
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,066
The face of Half Dome.

1213
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,433
- Close?
- Close enough to see her tears.

1214
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:24,633
How was it?
Was it steep?

1215
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,967
Not too bad.

1216
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,500
Jack, what do you say?

1217
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,700
Can we get a wilderness permit
to camp up there?

1218
01:02:31,834 --> 01:02:33,900
There's campsites
along Tenaya Creek.

1219
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,834
- There you go.
- Awesome.

1220
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:41,567
Thank you so much.

1221
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:43,800
All three of you.

1222
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:47,567
Well, time's a-tickin'.

1223
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,233
Let's pack up and hit the trail.

1224
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,834
- Bye.
- See ya.

1225
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:52,834
Bye.

1226
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:54,166
Be safe.

1227
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,633
Good luck.

1228
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,133
What a great view.

1229
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:02,367
See that canyon over there?

1230
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,000
Uh-huh.

1231
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:06,266
That's Tenaya Creek.

1232
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,800
That's where we're headed.

1233
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:13,600
All right.

1234
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:19,266
Come on, roadrunner,
let's get to it.

1235
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:33,334
This looks like our spot
right here.

1236
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:35,767
Oh.

1237
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,033
Is this where we're camping?

1238
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:38,333
Yes, ma'am.

1239
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:41,100
All right.

1240
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:46,200
How far is the photo ridge
from here,

1241
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:48,033
the one that Kos
was talking about?

1242
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,700
Well, I'm guessing that we take
the trail up as far as we can

1243
01:03:52,834 --> 01:03:55,834
and then, if we're lucky,
we'll find it.

1244
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:58,800
I'm feelin' lucky.

1245
01:03:58,934 --> 01:04:01,133
Come on, let's find a spot
to pitch our tents.

1246
01:04:03,266 --> 01:04:04,266
Okay.

1247
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:17,633
Whatever it is you've made,
it smells delicious.

1248
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:19,667
Pre-cooked chicken alfredo.

1249
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,800
My fave.

1250
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:25,667
The thermos right there
has got some Chardonnay in it.

1251
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,667
Would you care to pour us
a couple of glasses?

1252
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:31,667
What do you think
of our dining room?

1253
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
Perfect.

1254
01:04:37,433 --> 01:04:39,233
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

1255
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,567
And Jack, thanks.

1256
01:04:46,433 --> 01:04:48,867
Mm, not bad.

1257
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,767
Did I mention I was serving?

1258
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,300
You've come
to the right restaurant.

1259
01:04:52,367 --> 01:04:54,066
I heard the chef is amazing.

1260
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:58,000
So, tomorrow morning
we're gonna find

1261
01:04:58,133 --> 01:05:01,400
the face of a young girl
stained with tears,

1262
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:04,300
the Holy Grail of photos.

1263
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:07,033
Do you think Kos will put
my photo in his shop?

1264
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,467
Absolutely.

1265
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:12,133
So, I was thinking,

1266
01:05:12,266 --> 01:05:14,867
my book is gonna tell
the story of Half Dome.

1267
01:05:16,033 --> 01:05:18,767
But I also want to tell
your story.

1268
01:05:19,967 --> 01:05:21,166
No, I don't think so.

1269
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,867
I mean, I can't stop
thinking about you.

1270
01:05:25,033 --> 01:05:26,600
Your story is amazing.

1271
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:28,700
And you've been coming here
as a boy

1272
01:05:28,834 --> 01:05:31,934
and becoming a climber
and a conservationist.

1273
01:05:32,066 --> 01:05:34,400
There's a romance
to who you are.

1274
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:37,066
Well, I have to admit,

1275
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,166
I've been thinkin'
about you too.

1276
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:41,800
- You have?
- Yeah.

1277
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,033
Like what?

1278
01:05:47,133 --> 01:05:49,266
How do you feel
about lemon cookies?

1279
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,166
I thought you'd never ask.

1280
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:01,834
See this band of stars
right here?

1281
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:04,033
- Uh-huh.
- That's the Milky Way.

1282
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:09,367
Oh, and these three stars
in a row right here,

1283
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,934
- you see 'em?
- Yeah.

1284
01:06:11,066 --> 01:06:12,800
That's Orion's belt.

1285
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:15,033
- Is that the Big Dipper?
- Uh-huh.

1286
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:18,567
And that's Cassiopeia
just below it.

1287
01:06:21,433 --> 01:06:23,200
- A shooting star!
- Yeah.

1288
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,867
Jack.

1289
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,333
Huh?

1290
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:31,633
I love this.

1291
01:06:33,934 --> 01:06:35,967
Me too.

1292
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,900
I wish I could preserve
this moment forever.

1293
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,533
So, what's next?

1294
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:49,266
I mean, after the face of tears.

1295
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:52,433
Tomorrow's my last night.

1296
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,133
Back to Chicago.

1297
01:06:57,133 --> 01:06:59,600
I've done so much this week.

1298
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,200
Thanks to you.

1299
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,400
Went by too fast.

1300
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,567
Do you think we'll mesh?

1301
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,200
No.

1302
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:14,033
But complement, yeah.

1303
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:20,633
There is something else.

1304
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:25,333
There is?

1305
01:07:27,967 --> 01:07:29,100
It's just...

1306
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,700
the other night
when we were dancing...

1307
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:36,066
I looked into your eyes
and it was like

1308
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,033
looking into your soul.

1309
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,934
Never had that feeling before.

1310
01:07:42,233 --> 01:07:44,967
Like knowing
if we're together...

1311
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:47,900
the world is a better place?

1312
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,000
Yeah, like that.

1313
01:07:59,266 --> 01:08:00,367
Like that.

1314
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:15,200
We should probably
get some sleep.

1315
01:08:16,233 --> 01:08:17,567
- Big day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1316
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,967
Good idea.

1317
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,300
- Jack.
- I hear 'em.

1318
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:32,967
What should we do?

1319
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,433
- Let 'em howl.
- Jack!

1320
01:08:50,767 --> 01:08:52,166
Scram!

1321
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,500
Get out of here!

1322
01:08:53,633 --> 01:08:54,633
Get, get!

1323
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,133
You know, they live here,
we don't.

1324
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:05,476
Do you think they would hurt us?

1325
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,667
No.

1326
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,800
Just hungry.

1327
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,467
Probably smelled our food.

1328
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,633
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1329
01:09:13,734 --> 01:09:14,800
Back to bed?

1330
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,533
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

1331
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:28,033
- Good.
- It's just coyotes, right?

1332
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:29,967
Right.

1333
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,276
I mean, nothing to worry about.

1334
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,000
Nothing to worry about.

1335
01:09:33,133 --> 01:09:35,266
Okay, good, well,
I'll just, uh...

1336
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,133
snuggle back into my bag.

1337
01:09:38,266 --> 01:09:39,433
- Okay.
- Okay.

1338
01:09:39,567 --> 01:09:41,066
- Jack.
- Yeah?

1339
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:44,333
Are you gonna be okay?

1340
01:09:44,467 --> 01:09:46,367
Yeah, I'll be fine.

1341
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,433
Okay.

1342
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,200
Good.

1343
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,834
- Zoe.
- Yeah?

1344
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,066
Goodnight.

1345
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,266
Goodnight.

1346
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,033
Good morning.

1347
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:29,700
Mornin'.

1348
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:32,166
- How'd you sleep?
- I kept hearing coyotes.

1349
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,333
- I was lights out.
- Hm.

1350
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,333
You made bacon and eggs?

1351
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,233
How are you not married?

1352
01:10:40,367 --> 01:10:42,333
- Grab a seat.
- Thanks.

1353
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,233
Ooh, this muffin looks good.

1354
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,000
If only I could find
some coffee.

1355
01:10:52,133 --> 01:10:54,533
Well, ask and you shall receive.

1356
01:10:55,633 --> 01:10:57,066
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1357
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,300
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1358
01:11:00,834 --> 01:11:02,100
Whew, that's strong.

1359
01:11:02,233 --> 01:11:03,100
Mm.

1360
01:11:03,233 --> 01:11:04,100
Shall we dig in?

1361
01:11:04,233 --> 01:11:05,233
Let's do it.

1362
01:11:13,367 --> 01:11:14,743
We'll grab our stuff
on the way back.

1363
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:16,066
Okay, thanks.

1364
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,200
Yeah.

1365
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:36,166
All of this,
this beautiful canyon.

1366
01:11:37,233 --> 01:11:38,533
It's life-affirming.

1367
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:43,934
You just paraphrased
my favorite John Muir quote.

1368
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,166
Yeah?

1369
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,400
What's his version?

1370
01:11:47,533 --> 01:11:49,600
"Never again will one faint
by the wayside"

1371
01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:52,367
who gains the blessing
of one mountain day.

1372
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,367
Whatever his fate,
long life, short life,

1373
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,667
"stormy or calm,
he is forever rich."

1374
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,600
What a writer.

1375
01:12:02,633 --> 01:12:04,133
I got goosebumps.

1376
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:07,266
John Muir lives.

1377
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,840
I think you're gonna like this.

1378
01:12:36,834 --> 01:12:37,834
Jack!

1379
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:40,600
Wow.

1380
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,600
Worth the walk?

1381
01:12:45,734 --> 01:12:48,100
More like "Full Dome"
than Half Dome.

1382
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:51,166
This is it.

1383
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,300
This is the shot
that you've been waiting for.

1384
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,300
It's so immense.

1385
01:13:13,233 --> 01:13:15,300
One of the largest rocks
in the world.

1386
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:18,700
Look at her face and her tears.

1387
01:13:18,834 --> 01:13:19,834
Yeah.

1388
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,200
What's wrong?

1389
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,200
See how Half Dome bends
outward toward the left

1390
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:38,533
near the tears?

1391
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:40,767
Yeah?

1392
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,834
That's the shot.

1393
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,400
That's it.

1394
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,567
It's perfect.

1395
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,900
Great shot.

1396
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:11,300
Thanks.

1397
01:14:17,467 --> 01:14:19,233
Kos was right.

1398
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:20,767
It was worth the effort.

1399
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,734
It's quite a shot.

1400
01:14:22,867 --> 01:14:25,166
I'm absolutely wiped out.

1401
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,943
You know, if you're not
feeling up to it tonight,

1402
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:29,100
- I totally get it.
- It's our last night!

1403
01:14:29,233 --> 01:14:31,700
- No, I just...
- A hot bath and a quick nap's

1404
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,200
all I need.

1405
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:36,667
I'll see you on the patio
at seven?

1406
01:14:37,934 --> 01:14:39,333
Perfect.

1407
01:14:39,467 --> 01:14:40,633
- Bye.
- See ya.

1408
01:15:07,867 --> 01:15:09,867
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

1409
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,433
You clean up very well.

1410
01:15:18,033 --> 01:15:19,567
This is really nice.

1411
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:25,500
So, before I forget,
what's the deadline?

1412
01:15:25,633 --> 01:15:28,633
Uh... photographs
by the end of the week.

1413
01:15:28,767 --> 01:15:30,333
And the essays?

1414
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:31,900
I hope you're a fast writer.

1415
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,133
Get me some photos,
I'll start hammering.

1416
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:37,900
Okay, I'll send some tonight
and an outline of what I need.

1417
01:15:43,633 --> 01:15:45,667
I really wish
you weren't leaving.

1418
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,300
Yeah.

1419
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:51,533
I feel like we just got started.

1420
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:55,200
You think this will beat
the Chardonnay in a thermos?

1421
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:57,500
Oh, nothing will ever beat that.

1422
01:15:57,633 --> 01:15:59,967
But it will come close.

1423
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,633
To Zoe's Best.

1424
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,000
It's been magical.

1425
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,800
You really nailed that photo
of Yosemite Falls.

1426
01:16:15,834 --> 01:16:17,433
Our first day.

1427
01:16:17,567 --> 01:16:19,000
How's that Half Dome shot?

1428
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:22,000
It's so beautiful.

1429
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,200
Oh, and Harris
loved what you wrote

1430
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,767
for the introduction.

1431
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:31,934
"This valley, caretaken by
our Native brothers and sisters"

1432
01:16:32,066 --> 01:16:33,667
for thousands of years,

1433
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,900
now preserved forever
and for everyone

1434
01:16:37,033 --> 01:16:39,834
"as a magnificent national park."

1435
01:16:39,967 --> 01:16:43,500
And the teaser you wrote
about nature on the move

1436
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:45,633
and El Capitan,
the Pillar of Power,

1437
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,166
I love it.

1438
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,166
Great.

1439
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,800
I mean, this is great.

1440
01:16:49,934 --> 01:16:52,166
So, you like
my first three essays then?

1441
01:16:53,867 --> 01:16:55,767
I loved your intro...

1442
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,300
but your essays...

1443
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,066
there's just so much science.

1444
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,100
It's a coffee table book,
not a text book.

1445
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,000
I'm a scientist.

1446
01:17:08,133 --> 01:17:10,934
I mean, we agreed that I would
write the way that I write.

1447
01:17:11,066 --> 01:17:12,633
I know.

1448
01:17:12,767 --> 01:17:14,166
I kn... I know.

1449
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,166
I'm sorry.

1450
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,166
I can't use your essays.

1451
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,700
They just don't fit.

1452
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,934
I'm really sorry.

1453
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:24,266
No, I mean, I get it.

1454
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,934
You're the book boss, right?

1455
01:17:27,633 --> 01:17:28,700
Look, uh...

1456
01:17:30,633 --> 01:17:32,934
- I'll talk to you later.
- Jack.

1457
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,934
- Jack.
- Hey, Zoe.

1458
01:19:32,967 --> 01:19:34,166
I'm so glad you called.

1459
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:35,834
Yeah, I am sorry,
I've just been...

1460
01:19:35,967 --> 01:19:38,667
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.

1461
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,120
I'm just happy
to hear your voice.

1462
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:42,133
I'm really sorry
that my essays didn't work out,

1463
01:19:42,266 --> 01:19:45,400
but I'm sure you can
finish this on your own.

1464
01:19:45,533 --> 01:19:48,133
Oh, but Jack,
I... I was thinking...

1465
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:49,400
No.

1466
01:19:49,533 --> 01:19:52,000
Zoe, I'm done, uh...

1467
01:19:53,033 --> 01:19:54,333
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

1468
01:19:54,467 --> 01:19:58,266
But, Jack... you did help.

1469
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,266
You're on every page
of this book,

1470
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,633
every photo, and I...

1471
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:03,633
I'm sure it's gonna be great,

1472
01:20:03,767 --> 01:20:05,266
and I've loved spending time
with you,

1473
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,900
but we're in different worlds, Zoe.

1474
01:20:08,033 --> 01:20:10,333
It's time for us to move on.

1475
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,533
Goodbye.

1476
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:14,900
Bye.

1477
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:46,433
I know, Harris,
but I need more time.

1478
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:48,266
I'm glad that you like
the photos,

1479
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,333
but they're not gonna make
any sense without the narrative.

1480
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:53,266
What happened to Jack?

1481
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,567
We had creative differences.

1482
01:20:56,967 --> 01:20:58,300
I see.

1483
01:20:58,433 --> 01:20:59,567
Okay, okay.

1484
01:21:00,667 --> 01:21:03,000
Look, I'm sorry, but...

1485
01:21:03,133 --> 01:21:04,967
I can only give you
two more days.

1486
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,133
That's it.

1487
01:21:06,266 --> 01:21:07,934
I understand.

1488
01:21:08,066 --> 01:21:09,066
Thanks, Harris.

1489
01:21:21,567 --> 01:21:23,400
- Hello.
- Jack.

1490
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,200
Uh, what a surprise.

1491
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:30,567
- Um, come on in.
- Thanks.

1492
01:21:38,066 --> 01:21:39,146
You sounded a little stuck.

1493
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:41,333
And that bear
keeps staring at me.

1494
01:21:41,467 --> 01:21:44,400
Well, I did some rewriting,
simplified some things.

1495
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:47,500
There were sections
of your essays I loved.

1496
01:21:48,533 --> 01:21:49,633
We got work to do.

1497
01:21:51,066 --> 01:21:52,867
Do you have a printer?

1498
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,500
That's it.

1499
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,367
Finished.

1500
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,400
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1501
01:22:13,533 --> 01:22:14,900
You're the one
that made it great.

1502
01:22:15,033 --> 01:22:18,066
Oh, so now you like
armchair adventure books.

1503
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,934
I liked the adventure
of making this one.

1504
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:22,333
To our adventure.

1505
01:22:22,467 --> 01:22:23,867
Zoe's Best of the West.

1506
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,433
Yosemite.

1507
01:22:32,467 --> 01:22:33,467
Well...

1508
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,133
I gotta catch a flight.

1509
01:22:37,433 --> 01:22:38,900
Back to the mountains?

1510
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:41,333
Yeah.

1511
01:22:50,233 --> 01:22:51,433
Who am I kidding? I...

1512
01:22:53,266 --> 01:22:56,400
I came back here
because I'm in love with you.

1513
01:22:57,633 --> 01:22:59,934
I'm in love with you too.

1514
01:23:00,133 --> 01:23:01,409
Whatever happens
for the rest of my life,

1515
01:23:01,433 --> 01:23:02,734
I want it to be with you.

1516
01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:05,367
Me too.

1517
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:08,433
Forever.

1518
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,567
Forever.

1519
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,600
So, your book did well.

1520
01:23:22,734 --> 01:23:24,467
Very.

1521
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,000
What's next?

1522
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:28,066
Have you ever been
to the Grand Canyon?

1523
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,066
Your next book.

1524
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,266
Our next book.

1525
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:34,567
Harris sent me off
with a contract.

1526
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,433
The Grand Canyon.

1527
01:23:37,567 --> 01:23:39,600
And I also have
another question for you.

1528
01:23:40,633 --> 01:23:42,533
As a journalist?

1529
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:45,066
As the woman
who's in love with you.

1530
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,867
Okay.

1531
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,266
Will you marry me?

1532
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:52,400
Are you always this forward?

1533
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:54,533
Only with you.

1534
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:58,600
Yes, I will marry you
in front of these mountains

1535
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:00,433
and Yosemite Falls.

1536
01:24:02,633 --> 01:24:05,433
Do you, Zoe Best,
take Jack Hawkins

1537
01:24:05,567 --> 01:24:08,000
to be your lawful
wedded husband,

1538
01:24:08,133 --> 01:24:11,467
to love, honor, and cherish
from this day forward?

1539
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,500
I do.

1540
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:17,467
And do you, Jack Hawkins,
take Zoe Best

1541
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,100
to be your lawful wedded wife,

1542
01:24:20,233 --> 01:24:23,567
to love, honor, and cherish
from this day forward?

1543
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,000
I do.

1544
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:28,533
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1545
01:24:29,567 --> 01:24:30,647
You may now kiss the bride.
