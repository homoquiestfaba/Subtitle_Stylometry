I hear you been passing
notes to my Cherri in class,

155
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:42,120
and I thought you were
supposed to be so smart.

156

Remember this?

You like that idea, Cherri?

162
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:18,943
- Well, remember what
happened to the last one.

163
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:22,951
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, you
know that was an accident.

164
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:25,916
But don't think about
falling in love with Cherri.

165
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,796
Actually, you know what, I
hope you do fall for her.

I pray you fall in love
with her, know why?

00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:04,910
- And this.
- Oh, ow, oh!

179
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,374
- But most fun.

180
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:09,253
Yeah, I like fun!

181
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:12,926
Would be this.

182
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:14,723
- Ow, ow, oh, oh, the pain,
oh, the pain, the pain, oh, oh!

183
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:20,107
This sure is
fun.

184
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:23,197
- The pain, no, ow, boy,
this is unbearable, ow, ow!

185
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:37,267
- Let that be a lesson to you,
pipsqueak.

186
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:40,022
Fall in love with Cherri
and that could be you.

187
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:42,779
Say, Rod ,
could, could you pop off

188
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,662
my other fingernail?

189
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:56,054
- Cherri, I, I'm just a
new kid in school.

190
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:58,852
I don't, I don't know
any of the rules,

191
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:01,398
so what do you say?

192
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:08,287
Can we just be friends?

193
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:25,237
♪ Ooh ♪

194
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,331
- Okay, okay, I'll be
your servant,

195
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,299
but, but just for a few days,
right?

196
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:37,971
Then we'll forget
this whole mess

197
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,265
ever happened, okay, Cherri?

198
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:42,188
God , I
really hate you.

199
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:46,572
That's Miss
Cherri to you, slave.

200
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,168
- Ow, ow!

201
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:36,087
Eeh!

202
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:05,521
Ah!

203
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:41,093
Attention.

204
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,514
This is your principal speaking.

205
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:45,225
Remember there are still
tickets available for the prom,

206
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:47,730
and for you fellas out
there, my daughter Melody,

207
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,277
still dateless, and the
braces come off

208
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,073
two weeks before the big dance.

209
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,491
Daddy!

210
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,598
Argh!

211
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:23,714
Ah!

212
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:40,538
Ah!

213
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,444
Blergh!

214
00:19:57,782 --> 00:20:00,329
Eh.

215
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:19,993
- Don't panic, if we all
work together,

216
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:22,164
I, I'm sure he'll be fine.

217
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:23,792
Can I get some help please,
guys, huh?

218
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:37,862
Here's the small intestine,
it goes in first.

219
00:20:39,783 --> 00:20:41,787
Okay, large intestine's next.

220
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:44,334
The kidneys, then the bladder,
careful!

221
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:46,629
Get the spleen, next
the lungs and the heart.

222
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,483
Yeah, whoo!

223
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:00,114
All right!
- Awesome, great!

224
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:01,742
- Way to go!
- A hero!

225
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:06,419
- Thank you, class,
thanks to you, Spud, and your wonderful
knowledge of biology

226
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,800
I'm alive.

227
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,930
But that doesn't give you any
right to be rude to Cherri.

228
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:18,569
Attention, attention.

229
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:23,119
Today's lunch will be sloppy
Joes and creamed corn.

230
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:46,416
Ow!

231
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,418
Eeh , hey!

232
00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:51,258
You stabbed me.

233
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:52,595
- Well, you broke my nail.

234
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:54,474
- Why do I even
carry your books?

235
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:55,808
You never read 'em.

236
00:21:55,808 --> 00:22:00,026
- Maybe not, but it makes
me look intelligent. - Let me, um, let me
introduce you

237
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:02,406
to the wonderful world of books.

238
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,868
I shall be your instructor.

239
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:06,246
First, you place it in
the palm of your hand.

240
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:09,086
Then, grasping the
cardboard layer on top,

241
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:11,549
betwixt thumb and index finger,
lift.

242
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:14,597
This action reveals a
series of white pages

243
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:17,185
covered, ooh, with black marks.

244
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:19,815
We call these marks words.

245
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:22,530
And let me
introduce you

246
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,034
to the wonderful world
of servitude.

247
00:22:27,623 --> 00:22:30,294
- You're a very sad person,
Cherri.

248
00:22:30,294 --> 00:22:31,380
I feel sorry for you.

249
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,183
- Oh, yeah, it so happens
I'm a very happy person. - Ha, ha, ha!
- I've got gorgeous nails,

250
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:41,568
perfect hair, and I'm captain
of the cheerleading squad.

251
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:45,492
- And what about Rod?

252
00:22:45,492 --> 00:22:47,328
- Right, and I'm dating
the star quarterback,

253
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:50,835
and I'm not a spaz like you!

254
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:52,506
Hey, don't
worry about me.

255
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,594
I've got my books
and my scooter.

256
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:59,604
- Big deal, I'm gonna be
queen of the prom this year.

I'm 10 times happier than you!

Ha, I, I'm 100

gets you all excited.

00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:00,329
- Oh, gosh, Rod, you scared me.

324
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:02,959
Oh, I was just dreaming
about Darlene.

325
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:05,923
I wanna ask her to the prom!

326
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:11,768
Ha, you'd have better
luck with Mr. Snerz's frog. - She makes my Twinkie tingle,

327
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:14,565
but she always rejects me.

328
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:16,946
I've got just the thing
for you, guaranteed to make

329
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,035
you irresistible.
- Gosh, Rod,

330
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:22,832
you put the stud in student.

331
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:27,007
Gee, I thought that stuff
was just a myth.

332
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:30,556
Careful, Zip, it's
powerful stuff.

333
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:33,687
Just a few drops is
all you need.

334
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:43,832
- Uh, Darlene, can I
talk to you in private?

335
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:49,177
- This better be important.

336
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:50,596
I've gotta get my
thighs loosened up.

337
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:53,852
So did Rod put you up to this?

338
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:57,151
- No, uh, I wanted to, uh--

339
00:28:57,151 --> 00:29:00,365
Uh, do you

340
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,369
find me attractive, you know,
in a romantic kind of way?

341
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:08,340
'Cause I wanted to ask you--

342
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,052
You're
way too weird.

343
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:17,525
- Wait, Darlene, wait!

344
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,904
Ah, I wanted to ask you to the--

345
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:22,618
To the prom!

346
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:24,997
I wouldn't date you

347
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,543
if--

348
00:29:27,378 --> 00:29:30,342
- Well, folks, it's a
wonderful fall afternoon,

349
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:34,267
and it looks like we've
got a full house.

350

It's the game of the year,
our Echo Lake Fighting Cocks

351
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:40,613
versus the hated crosstown
rivals, the Beavers.

352

your quarterback,

this young fella here a
ticket for indecent exposure.

495

we'll be here for real.

498
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:10,912
I mean really love me?

499
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,175

Cherri baby.

Gosh, Rod,
you're so romantic.

502
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:24,356
Rod, let's lay off
the slave kid.

503
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:26,485
Why, you ain't
getting soft on him, are ya?

504
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:28,574
No, I'm
afraid he might get hurt.

505
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:30,619
You know
what he told me?

506
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:32,748
Your hair was ugly.

507
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:34,501
- Ew, well, maybe a
little longer.

508
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:38,176
You know, I heard
that Cheddar has a huge organ.

509
00:40:38,176 --> 00:40:42,058
And there it is.

510
00:40:42,058 --> 00:40:43,937
- Welcome to this sad
occasion as we gather together

511
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:48,196
to bear witness to a
wonderful life.

512
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,368
I'd like to read a sacred text

513
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:52,747
I think is appropriate
for the occasion.

514
00:40:52,747 --> 00:40:55,711
The tawny
youth eagerly placed

515
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:59,092
his dewy thighs around
the quivering member.

516
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:01,765
Wait,
that's not right.

517
00:41:01,765 --> 00:41:03,810
I think now it would be
fitting and proper

518
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,525
to hear remembrances from his
closest friends, Mr. JoJo?

519
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:12,410
- Oh, uh, me, uh, I don't think,

520
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,375
well, uh , he came
into my shop many times,

521
00:41:16,585 --> 00:41:19,968
and he was certainly, uh,
energetic.

522
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:24,811
- And you, Mr. Snerz?

523
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:26,690
- Ah, yes, well, I can't say

524
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,946
he was a great student,
but

525
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:33,035
he was certainly, um, different.

526
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:36,375
- Look at that new kid
pretending
he's Zip's best friend.

527
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,049
And now you,
Miss Darlene.

528
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:42,304
What have you got to say?

529
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:43,639
- You know, I hate to be
a wet blanket,

530
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:47,272
but that guy was just
a creep with a hard-on.

531
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:51,572
A little reverence,
please?

532
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:53,576
I find those remarks
inappropriate.

533
00:41:53,576 --> 00:41:56,290
- You know, honestly, I
never liked the guy either.

534
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,544
He always skipped out
on his check.

535
00:41:58,544 --> 00:42:00,048
- Me, either, he had an
irritating personality,

536
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:03,095
kinda like, you know that sound,

537
00:42:03,095 --> 00:42:06,310
fingernails on a blackboard.

538
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,064
Irritating is right.

539
00:42:08,064 --> 00:42:10,401
He was a terrible mascot, too.

540
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:15,244
♪ Uh la la ah oh uh ♪

541
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:18,835
Spud, I wanna
ask you a personal question.

542
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:23,302
Let's not destroy

543
00:42:23,302 --> 00:42:24,221
the sanctity of the occasion.

544
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:25,724
It's true, I'm
kind of glad he's dead.

545
00:42:25,724 --> 00:42:29,816
He was a real pain in
the keister.

546
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:32,570
I find those
remarks inappropriate.

547
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:46,975
So you
think my hair is ugly, do you?

548
00:42:50,189 --> 00:42:51,442
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

549
00:43:07,724 --> 00:43:09,812
I saw you
flirting with Cherri.

550
00:43:12,484 --> 00:43:17,619
You better watch it,
squirt, I got my eye on you.

551
00:43:24,382 --> 00:43:25,718
- And where are my sprinkles,
pea brain?

552
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:29,142
- Cherri needs more sprinkles.

553
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:39,496
- You know I don't like
brown sprinkles,

554
00:43:39,496 --> 00:43:41,792
you useless flunky.

555
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:48,556
Ew, there's a brown
sprinkle in my hair, ew!

556
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:52,313
You can't sit there,
I'm telling Rod.

557
00:43:54,986 --> 00:43:58,075
- Go ahead, there's no more
he can do to me anyway.

558
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:08,137
- Relax, enjoy it.

559
00:44:08,137 --> 00:44:10,141
- Yow!
- This is for the sprinkle

560
00:44:11,978 --> 00:44:13,439
in my hair, and this is
for saying my hair is ugly.

561
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,330
- And this is for the
midnight chicken ride. - You're breaking my hair!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

562
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,542
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

563
00:44:24,753 --> 00:44:26,506
Oh, God in heaven,

564
00:44:26,506 --> 00:44:27,717
please help me.

565
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,843
- Get off of me, twerp.

566
00:45:09,843 --> 00:45:12,223
How dare you touch me,
you creep!

567
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:15,981
- Hey, I like your
hair like that.

568
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:17,859
- What happened in there,
don't tell Rod.

569
00:45:29,966 --> 00:45:32,680
Hi, Rod,
how's it going?

570
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,394
Hey, Darlene, what's up?

571
00:45:35,394 --> 00:45:37,106
Looks
like a messy job.

572
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:39,986
- Yep.
- Gee,

573
00:45:39,986 --> 00:45:41,156
you're so good with tools.

574
00:45:42,158 --> 00:45:45,122
- Uh-huh.
- Did you ever work

575
00:45:45,122 --> 00:45:46,792
on anyone else's car?
- Nope.

576
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:49,297
Well, let's
say a close friend

577
00:45:49,297 --> 00:45:51,927
had a car that needed a
lot of attention.

578
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:55,810
Like a tuneup?

579
00:45:56,728 --> 00:45:59,108
Or maybe just
tightening a few bolts.

580
00:45:59,108 --> 00:46:03,826
- No, this is the only
baby I touch.

581
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:07,040
What if the other
car were a sexy racer model?

582
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,048
Nope.

583
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:16,893
- Well, what if I told
you someone else

584
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:20,276
was working on your car?

585
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:22,280
- Impossible, no one
touches this baby but Rod.

586
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,953
- I'm afraid right now
someone's working on your baby.

587
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:30,296
What, where?

588
00:46:30,296 --> 00:46:33,218
- Relax, every hear the
words double entendre?

589
00:46:33,218 --> 00:46:37,476
Of course,
it's one of those

590
00:46:37,476 --> 00:46:39,105
fancy French manifolds, right?

591
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:41,526
- Well, Rod, think about it.

592
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:44,407
Maybe one day you'll get tired

593
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:48,415

Right, where's the king,
where's Rod?

626
00:50:15,955 --> 00:50:18,793
Who knows where King Rod is,
anybody?

627
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:21,632
He's at football
practice, Miss Crumbles.

628
00:50:21,632 --> 00:50:23,636
- People, people, please,

629
00:50:23,636 --> 00:50:25,389
we can't have a rehearsal
without the king.

630
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,979
You, young man, we
need a stand-in.

631
00:50:27,979 --> 00:50:30,525
- Me, but I'm just a slave.

632
00:50:30,525 --> 00:50:33,073
I'm not a king.
- Well, you'll have to do.

633
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:35,702
Okay, queen and slave,
or king, up on the stage.

634
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:40,587
Good, good, ladies first,
that's it.

635
00:50:43,969 --> 00:50:47,726
Okay, the king makes an
acceptance speech.

636
00:50:47,726 --> 00:50:51,150
Blah, blah, blah, now bow,

637
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,945
first to the court, then
to the audience.

638
00:50:53,905 --> 00:50:56,326
Then you kiss.

639
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:01,336
- Uh, do we have to?

640
00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:05,302
- Of course, it says it
right here in the program.

641
00:51:05,302 --> 00:51:07,975
King and queen K-I-S-S.

642
00:51:10,981 --> 00:51:15,615
You call that a kiss?

643
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:18,079
The king and queen
represent romance!

644
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,249
You can do better than that.

645
00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:21,752
Come on now, kids.

646
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,175
Let's pretend there's a little
romance between you two,

647
00:51:24,175 --> 00:51:27,305
and kiss, dammit!

confetti for the prom.

650
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:38,244
- But I didn't touch a
thing, Miss Crumbles.

651
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:43,963
- Get away from me, you creep.

652
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:47,345
And don't you ever
touch me again.

653
00:51:47,345 --> 00:51:49,349
- You been changing the
oil in my car, twerp?

654
00:51:49,808 --> 00:51:51,687
You been tightening her bolts?

655
00:51:54,317 --> 00:51:56,363
- What, what bolts?

656
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,618
- I just found out what a
double entendre is, lover boy.

657
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:32,853
- I'll take care of him, Rod.

658
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:34,773
- You're not so tough.

659
00:52:34,773 --> 00:52:36,152
If you were really tough,
instead of your mouth,

660
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,197
you'd stick that toothpick
somewhere else.

661
00:52:44,835 --> 00:52:46,046
- Oh, ah, ow, ouch, Mommy!

662
00:52:46,504 --> 00:52:48,301
- Oof!
- My eye, my eye!

663

Spud, Spud, Spud!

664

What's the answer?

665
00:53:35,437 --> 00:53:36,397
Spud, do you know the answer?

666
00:53:41,741 --> 00:53:46,124
- Study.
- Ah ,

667
00:53:46,124 --> 00:53:47,502
that's correct, mm,
study and observe.

668
00:53:49,213 --> 00:53:53,597

May I ask a question?

670
00:53:56,019 --> 00:53:58,023

Cherri doesn't show up,can I be the prom queen?

some cultures,

686
00:54:52,382 --> 00:54:54,970
instead of proms, they
throw virgins down volcanoes

687
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:58,352
as a sacrifice, but then I guess

your king and queen
and their court.

01:00:04,046 --> 01:00:07,929

01:00:20,537 --> 01:00:23,167
stole my Cherri.

725
01:00:24,628 --> 01:00:26,173

726
01:00:28,845 --> 01:00:32,811

There, there. She'll be back.

This is a very sad moment,
but our prom can survive.

729
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:44,084
The pageant bylaws state
that when a queen

730
01:00:44,084 --> 01:00:46,463
abdicates the throne, the
first princess

731
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,011
becomes the queen,
Queen Darlene!

732
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:56,108
I'm proud to crown King Rod.

733
01:00:56,108 --> 01:01:00,116

without Cherri.

01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:03,331
Please, Rod.

735
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:05,418
- No.
- Please?

736
01:01:05,418 --> 01:01:06,795
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Please, please, please,

737
01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:08,299

- No, no, no, no, no, no,

738
01:01:08,299 --> 01:01:10,511
no, no, no, no.
- Okay, we'll have to

01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:13,017

gentlemen, the royalty of Echo Lake High, King
Rod and Queen Darlene!

- No, it's a big one.

it's snagged.

747
01:01:58,607 --> 01:01:59,693
Get to shore, quick!

748
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:03,701

Ooh, what's all the excitement?

753
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:28,543
- Hey, Sarge, what's going on?

754
01:02:29,961 --> 01:02:31,715
- Well, these boys claim they
found Cherri and Spud, mm.

755
01:02:33,469 --> 01:02:36,934
- That's impossible, I just
got a postcard from Cherri.

756
01:02:36,934 --> 01:02:39,648
They're in Mexico.

757
01:02:39,648 --> 01:02:41,360
- See, boys, here's the proof,
mm.

758
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,199
- Hey, Sarge, want a brewski?

759
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:46,411
- Sorry, boys.
- Wait!

760
01:02:47,413 --> 01:02:49,751
I swear I really saw them.

761
01:02:49,751 --> 01:02:51,547
- Yeah, just come on the boat.

762
01:02:51,547 --> 01:02:53,384
We got beer!

763
01:02:53,384 --> 01:02:55,972
- Can I get some fishing in?

764
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,560
- Sure, they're really
biting today.

765
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,189
Mind if I tag along?

766
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:05,992
- There's the floating
buoy thingie over there.

767
01:03:07,662 --> 01:03:09,207
Slow it down.

768
01:03:11,169 --> 01:03:14,217
- Ow, ow, ow, whoa!

769
01:03:14,217 --> 01:03:15,887
Ow, ow, ow, ow, whoa!

770
01:03:23,944 --> 01:03:28,329
Stop the engine!

771
01:03:28,329 --> 01:03:29,748

772
01:03:29,748 --> 01:03:31,460
I don't understand machines.

773
01:03:33,255 --> 01:03:35,426

Whoa, oh, my God, I don't
believe it!

stand back. I know artificial respiration.

and we've come back to
claim our crowns.

869
01:10:33,135 --> 01:10:36,099
- That can't be Cherri and Spud.

870
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:38,228
They crashed off the road
and drowned in Echo Lake!

871
01:11:01,943 --> 01:11:05,408
- Oh, Rod, what's the matter?

872
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:07,703
Oh, have I lost too much weight?

873
01:11:07,703 --> 01:11:10,251
Oh, please, Rod, look
into my sockets.

874
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:15,219
Tell me you still love me.

875
01:11:21,315 --> 01:11:23,987
Oh!

876
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,880
- You've made me really mad.

877
01:11:49,245 --> 01:11:51,041
The king is
dead, long live the king!

878
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:57,178
- Hmm, I don't see any rules

879
01:11:57,178 --> 01:11:58,890
against the king and
queen being skeletons.

880
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,186
I guess it's okay.

881
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:03,106
A big hand

882
01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:04,233
for King Spud and Queen Cherri.

883
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:11,415
Okay, Echo High, let the
prom continue.

884
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:27,154
♪ When a boy and girl
find their own true love ♪

885
01:12:33,834 --> 01:12:35,879
Oh , it's
such a beautiful story.

886
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:42,018
- Okay, it's a nice story,
but what's the point?

887
01:12:44,188 --> 01:12:48,071
Don't play football in
a chicken suit?

888
01:12:48,071 --> 01:12:49,950
Don't close your dress in
the door of your car, what?

889
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:52,789
- The point, the point?

890
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:55,377
You can't see the point?

891
01:12:55,377 --> 01:12:57,173
Kids these days, sheesh.

892
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:59,511
You see, love, like
life, is a creative act.

893
01:13:00,888 --> 01:13:05,732
Cherri and Spud were
decomposed skeletons,

894
01:13:05,732 --> 01:13:08,696
yet their romance was a
beautiful and powerful thing.

895
01:13:08,696 --> 01:13:13,121
In their short, tragic lives,
they created a masterpiece,

896
01:13:13,413 --> 01:13:17,756
a masterpiece like this.

897
01:13:19,676 --> 01:13:24,060
And this is what your
romance is like.

898
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:31,784
- But that's just a
broken cookie.

899
01:13:31,784 --> 01:13:33,788
That's
our romance?

900
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:37,378
- You must think we're
pretty gullible.

901
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:39,550
Here's to Cherri and Spud
returning as skeletons.

902
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:43,348
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

903
01:14:29,523 --> 01:14:33,741
- Believe me now?

904
01:14:33,741 --> 01:14:35,327
