We both wish it was as big as NASCAR.

116
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,140
I figured the only way we're ever going to get

117
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,420
anywhere is to help each other out any way we can.

and hopefully get sponsored.

00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,520
A motorcycle. You know like for an airplane but

554
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,660
for a motorcycle.

555
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,540
Sean listen man. You gotta realize you're

556
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,280
riding days are over. This is just not sane.

557
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,880
You know you said you'd be there for me.

558
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,050
You can't use that against me man. I am

559
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,960
there for you. Riding again would be a

560
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,760
suicide mission and you know it.

561
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,920
You know I came in here to ask your help to

562
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,060
regain something that was taken away

563
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,220
from me. Not to help kill myself.

564
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,240
Don't blame me if I don't wanna be part of this OK?

565
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,100
I'm going to do this with you or with out you.

566
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,340
Well... I wish you good luck.

567
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:29,860
[Ominous music builds.]

568
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,780
Can you help me with this?

569
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
What is this?

570
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,880
They're blueprints.

571
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,740
What for?

572
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,640
For landing gear. So I can ride again.

573
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,080
What in the hell do you mean so you can ride again?

574
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,460
It's simple. It'll just pivot back-and-forth.

575
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,020
You know they'll hold me up when I stop.

576
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,400
You have got to be kidding.

577
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,720
No. I'm not kidding. I

578
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,460
think I can ride again.

579
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,460
Yeah you think you can ride again.

580
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,280
I thought you were working on the stop drinking plan.

581
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,240
I am. I haven't had a drink since

582
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,400
I came up with this idea.

583
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,620
So that's why you stopped? Has nothing to do with us.

584
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,540
Now that's not true.

585
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,080
If you don't agree

586
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,940
to drop this ridiculous idea right

587
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,120
now... you can kiss my ass goodbye permanently.

588
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,820
You know what riding means to me. Why

589
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,820
are you acting this way?

590
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,980
Because I will not sit around

591
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,060
watch you kill yourself trying to ride a motorcycle.

592
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,440
Kill myself? I'm trying to get a

593
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,790
piece of me back.

594
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,900
It's not like getting a part of you back.

595
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,920
It probably will take more away from you. Can't

596
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,400
you see that?

597
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,320
Lisa, I love you and I'd do anything for you.

598
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,540
But this is for me. I have to do this

599
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,140
Don't bother saying another word.

600
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,000
I'm moving out tomorrow.

601
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:17,140
[Birds chirping.]

602
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,460
Lisa, what are you doing?

603
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,740
What do you think I'm doing?

604
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,000
Do you remember what we were talking about last night?

605
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,900
Yeah, Of course I remember.

606
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,240
You don't need to ask then.

607
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,320
You don't have to do this you know.

608
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,260
I could say the same to you.

609
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,600
Listen, I'm done talking about it.

610
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,860
It infuriates me that you won't respect my wishes.

611
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,160
And quit this idiotic idea.

612
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,520
It's not an idiotic idea. I'm trying to get something

613
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,860
back that was taken away from me.

614
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,980
And as I said before...

615
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,820
I'm done talking about it.

616
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,160
Good bye.

617
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,220
Lisa come on.

618
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:24,000
[Quick tempo hip music plays.]

619
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,900
Yeah...

620
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,860
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

621
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,100
Same thing happened to me.

622
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,560
Oh yeah? How's that?

623
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,840
My girlfriend run off...

624
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,460
From the driveway...

625
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,760
in front of a bunch of people.

626
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,880
Is she coming back?

627
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,480
No.

628
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,120
I'm sorry to hear that.

629
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,060
Well don't be. I'm not.

630
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,400
How long ago did she leave?

631
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,360
Oh... going on 12 years now.

632
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,460
That gives me hope.

633
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,440
Well...

634
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,940
Don't think that uhh... just because my

635
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,240
never came back that's what's going to

636
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,740
happen to you.

637
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,680
Want a beer?

638
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,980
Yeah why not?

639
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,780
Meet me around the side.

640
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,980
Alright.

641
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,020
3 beers?

642
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,860
Uhh... 2 for me.

643
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,020
Drink up.

644
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,560
Thanks man.

645
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,260
You don't mind if I uhh...

646
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,180
ask you about uhh... your problems with that lady.

647
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,260
No. I don't mind.

648
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,080
I came up with an idea

649
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,960
of how I can ride a motorcycle again.

650
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,480
So she ran off and left you in your hour of need.

651
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,840
Yeah, her and everybody else.

652
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,400
I guess I've been sitting around the house a lot.

653
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,540
So they think I'm on some kind of a...

654
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,180
Suicide mission or something.

655
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,760
Everybody thinks the same thing about me.

656
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,520
Oh yeah?

657
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,940
Man I've never seen your garage door open before.

658
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,100
I didn't realize you had so many tools.

659
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,020
Well once upon a time I used to be a serious

660
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,020
mechanic but uhh...

661
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,260
Some where along the line I got sidetracked.

662
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,960
Really? Doing what?

663
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,380
Drinking. Mostly.

664
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,500
Oh.

665
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:46,440
[Distant highway traffic sounds.]

666
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,480
[Knock knock knock...]

667
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,640
Hey.

668
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,180
How ya doing?

669
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,580
Oh pretty good. I came back to show you uhh...

670
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,580
the plan that I have for the... the landing gear I was

671
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,040
telling you about in the garage?

672
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,340
Let's see what you got.

673
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,660
Looks like a...

674
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,340
Somebody ripped it up.

675
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,110
Yeah, my wife tore it up. That's why she

676
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,220
left this morning.

677
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,300
You see they just... raise and lower right there

678
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,700
and it'll hold the bike up when it stops.

679
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,160
It looks uhh...

680
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,120
Looks promising.

681
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,160
Not a bad idea.

682
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,720
I think it'll work.

683
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,760
I don't suppose you'd be willing to help me build it?

684
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,320
I mean you got lots of stuff

685
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,700
in the garage, I'm sure you could build it pretty easily.

686
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,980
Na... na shit.

687
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,660
I don't think so.

688
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,020
I'm not... you know I'm just uhh...

689
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,500
I'm not doing that stuff anymore.

690
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,660
I understand. I didn't mean to like impose or anything...

691
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,900
I just wanted to show it to you.

692
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,940
It's alright.

693
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,140
Good luck with it.

694
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,800
Alright man. Well thanks for the beer.

695
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,200
Sure... sure.

696
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,240
See ya.

697
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,260
Alright.

698

[Sensitive piano music plays.]

699
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,880
Phone rings.

700
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:23,920
Hello?

701
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,720
Hey.

702
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,140
Oh hey.

703
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,600
What are you doing?

704
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,940
Just helping my mom.

705
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,300
I really miss you. I called to

706
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,960
see when you're coming back

707
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,960
Are you willing to drop this whole motorcycle thing?

708
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:36,980
No.

709
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,380
Well, there's your answer.

710
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,900
Why can't you understand what this means to me?

711
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,190
It's like getting a piece of me back that

712
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,620
was taken away.

713
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,920
Don't you see how insane this it?

714
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,340
This stupid idea is something that could take away

715
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,200
all that you have left.

716
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,700
I thought you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me.

717
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,880
I do...

718
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,460
You obviously don't care

719
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,040
about us anymore.

720
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,600
That's not true Leese.

721
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,160
Yes it is Sean. You're too damn

722
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,560
stubborn to see that you are the only

723
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,320
one holding all the cards. All you have

724
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,600
to do is just drop this stupid idea...

725
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,540
And I would come back.

726
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,200
It's not that easy.

727
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,260
[Click... dial tone.]

728
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:22,880
Damn it.

Man... have you been in here all night?

733
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,640
Yeah... check this out.

734
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,120
Just about to bolt it up.

735
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,620

Well I gonna have probably one of those linear

745
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,180
I'll probably get like a solenoid or

746

something to do the shifter.

01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,980
Get out of here. Where is that anyway?

921
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,800
It's in Florida. Wanna go?

922
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,260
Might as well.

923
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,380
Awesome.

924
01:08:50,380 --> 01:09:34,740
[Ominous music plays.]

925
01:09:35,160 --> 01:10:17,700
[Music changes to an upbeat pace.]

926
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:34,860
[Fast hard competitive music plays.]]

927
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,620
[Music fades out and the race announcer talks over the PA system.]

928
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,000
OK welcome to beautiful Daytona Beach Florida.

929
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,380
Really looking forward to the upcoming race.

930
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,860
The racers out on their warm up lap right now.

931
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,380
Several riders very very close in the points battle

932
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,840
The pace car is out pacing

933
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:57,320
this field and catching the last runers as

934
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,270
they head out of the pre grid out onto

935
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:00,860
the racing surface for their siding

936
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,050
lap. Temperatures looking pretty good today...

937
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,780
It's about 90 degrees... pretty humid.

938
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:08,461
But Uhh... the riders all ready to go.

939
01:11:08,461 --> 01:11:10,540
Race ready . Tire pressures are set.

940
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:13,220
The motorcycles are fueled and as I said

941
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,930
they're taking their warm-up laps

942
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:16,760
working their way around making their

943
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,200
grid positions and will be up on the

944
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,320
five-minute board very shortly.

945
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,600
Really looking forward to the race today as these

946
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,320
racers working way around....

947
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,410
I see Dennis Smith working his way up around on the

948
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:28,280
warm-up lap as

949
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,830
well as Tony Silvera. They keep getting

950
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,380
back on maybe the third and fourth row Joe

951
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:35,750
Davidson next to him as well as Larry Cochran.

952
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:38,260
and Ken Waco so they're working the

953
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,340
warm up lap right now. The attention is

954
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,740
building right now we can see them

955
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:43,590
heading out of the pits...

956
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,080
around the track. They're going back and forth

957
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,540
getting the tires warmed up, making sure

958
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:52,050
that the tires are uhh... feeling like they

959
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,960
should and the suspensions are finally

960
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,880
dialed in the way they want. The riders

961
01:11:55,889 --> 01:11:58,580
hearts no doubt beating very heavily as

962
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,780
they head around for this warm-up lap

963
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,480
and are just about ready to take their

964
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,180
grid positions. Of course the warm-up lap

965
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,640
always important to get that engine up

966
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,310
to temperature make certain that the

967
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,520
tires are exactly warmed up because boy

968
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,580
when that green flag drops and these

969
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,360
riders head off into that first turn it

970
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,780
is absolute chaos.

971
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,790
You've got 40 riders going for the same

972
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:20,120
three foot line and it's always very

973
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,640
exciting. They'll be bumping and grinding

974
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:24,630
and all sorts of action. The riders are

975
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,140
heading around right now getting up onto

976
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,040
the grid positions we can see uhh... we can

977
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,220
see the umbrella ladies holding... oh

978
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,860
the beautiful Budweiser umbrella ladies holding

979
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,500
the umbrellas against the Florida Sun

980
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,060
here as the riders are taking their

981
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,070
grid positions. Of course some of the privateer

982
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,220
teams here they they don't have as much

983
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,160
support and those riders qualifying a

984
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,340
little bit slower than some of the

985
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,080
factory rides.

986
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,680
Hey Jason...

987
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,260
No way Sean... did you come to watch me race?

988
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,480
not really

989
01:12:56,780 --> 01:13:02,620
[Track ambience: Bikes screaming by]

990
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,080
What are you off your nut?

991
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,720
No man, I'm serious. I'm calling in that favor you owe me.

992
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,320
Yeah, I haven't forgotten Sean... but really.

993
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,760
Jason, I gotta do this and you're my only way in.

994
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,640
I don't know Shawn.

995
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,560
Don't forget I was there for you.

996
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,480
Yeah, you were.

997
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,140
So you'll do it then?

998
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:26,220
Well, if anything it'll be one hell of a story to tell.

999
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,720
Yeah, it will.

1000
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,920
What do you need me to do?

1001
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:29,840
I need you to qualify, I'll

1002
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,860
take it from there.

1003
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:31,980
Alright.

1004
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:33,760
Starting on

1005
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,640
that third row Orlando Pablo uhh... he's

1006
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,740
doing very well in the points this year.

1007
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,440
He is about a hundred and eleven points into

1008
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,639
the championship by about 40 points

1009
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,829
behind the lead right now. Of course Brice

1010
01:13:44,829 --> 01:13:47,640
Gross, another privateer rider... he

1011
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,520
taking his grid position right now... he's

1012
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:53,820
riding the suzuki GSXR and Brice doing

1013
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,100
very well running the National circuit

1014
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,840
this year. Chuck Raves, of course another

1015
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,530
local rider he traveled over from the

1016
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:04,360
west coast to be here at Daytona today

1017
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,000
and the privateer rider has raced all

1018
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,860
over the world.

1019
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,820
He's got a very good program

1020
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,860
put together for this year on the Yamaha

1021
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:14,340
and we're looking for Chuck to do well today.

1022
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,740
Moving back to that fifth row I show

1023
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,920
Jeremy Toy. Jeremy Toy another club racer

1024
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,170
who is entered the National Rex and a

1025
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:25,360
local rider here at Daytona hoping to do

1026
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,400
well today against these

1027
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,460
nationally-ranked riders. Honda mounted

1028
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:32,040
Danny Farnsworth also with the factory

1029
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,100
ride for the first year on that Honda

1030
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,640
superbike. Honda having a little bit of

1031
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:38,949
problems trying to get some of the

1032
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:40,920
technical stuff sorted out but a

1033
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,500
Farnsworth doing very well finishing I

1034
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,980
believe it was fourth at Road Atlanta and

1035
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:50,260
respectable 3rd. He got the podium at Laguna

1036
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:53,680
Seca. The Honda team again having a

1037
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,360
hard time this year course then again

1038
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,980
we've got Marty Cooksie on the

1039
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,460
Harley-Davidson. Harley-Davidson...

1040
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,160
making some progress this year and

1041
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:05,600
Harley with two podium finishes and of

1042
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,880
course Marty the rider moving over

1043
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,880
from the Kawasaki team on to Honda for

1044
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,560
this season.

1045
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,080
How's it look?

1046
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:23,280
It looks pretty good. Try not to move around

1047
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,600
too much. It's not very steady.

1048
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,800
Alright but stay as long as you can so you can block the view.

1049
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,240
OK.

1050
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,420
Thanks a lot man you know... I couldn't have done it

1051
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:34,180
without you.

1052
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,440
Ahh... don't go getting sappy

1053
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:43,260
on me now... Just buy me a beer and we'll call it even.

1054
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,440
You got it.

1055
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,140
Don't fall off.

1056
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,360
I won't. Thanks.

1057
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,100
We're just a couple minutes away from the green flag start.

1058
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,980
The riders again are getting on their

1059
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,630
grid position. We are upon the 5 minute

1060
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,780
board now. Just about ready to take the

1061
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:03,120
2-minute board and in fact here it comes

1062
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,040
so the teams are now clearing the grid

1063
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,710
as the riders now making those

1064
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,520
last-minute adjustments I see I see

1065
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,360
Brian Long's tuner giving him some

1066
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,700
last-minute advice. Kevin President

1067
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,630
gridded up. He's on that second row but Kevin a

1068
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:22,140
guy to watch out here today. The hearts are

1069
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,610
beating and they're just about ready to

1070
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:26,120
take the green flag. In fact the starter

1071
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,220
now holding the flag. We're up on the

1072
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,840
one minute side board in there they go.

1073
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,100
The green flag drops... forty motorcycles

1074
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,330
ladies and gentlemen heading at the

1075
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,480
fastest raceway on the East coast.

1076
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,220
Daytona Beach Florida.

1077
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:41,780
[High energy music plays.]

1078
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,479
40 motorcycles heading off to that first

1079
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,720
turn. Course these motorcycles accelerating from

1080
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,600
about 0 to 100 in about two seconds...

1081
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,100
40 motorcycles going for that same three

1082
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,320
foot piece of pavement a couple of

1083
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,840
riders bumping as they get through the

1084
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,760
turn but they managed to keep it up and

1085
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,320
everyone's OK. Out to an early lead it

1086
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,960
appears that it's Aaron Lunsford and he is

1087
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,720
rocking off into turn number 2. He's

1088
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,860
staying in front of the pack as the rest

1089
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,090
of the riders managed to get themselves

1090
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,300
sorted up and down that short straight

1091
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,940
away. The riders out of the infield now onto

1092
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,980
the high banking and Boy these riders are pulling

1093
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,940
some very high G's along the high banking

1094
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,699
there as they accelerate down over the

1095
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,070
high banking of this tri oval Daytona Beach

1096
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:24,920
Florida. The riders accelerating up to over

1097
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,420
a hundred and eighty miles an hour

1098
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:28,820
pulling two or three G's. Their

1099
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:30,920
suspension compresses and ladies and

1100
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,320
gentlemen if you've ever been out there

1101
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,760
your helmet starts to press into your

1102
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,620
shoulder blades, your cheeks start to

1103
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:37,940
sag and at a hundred and eighty miles

1104
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:39,920
an hour, it gets very difficult to

1105
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,570
control these motorcycles as they head

1106
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,360
around that high banking. Of course they've

1107
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,200
got to haul down for that chicane on the

1108
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,760
back straightaway and in fact there they

1109
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,680
go. Hauling it down from a hundred and

1110
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,269
eighty miles an hour into the chicane

1111
01:17:50,269 --> 01:17:52,240
and then accelerating back up to speed

1112
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,280
on to the high-banking as they head

1113
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,920
across the start/finish line. Ladies and

1114
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,760
gentlemen there is nothing like racing

1115
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,180
Daytona Beach Florida. On the Yamaha in

1116
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,240
the Lead he's followed by Tom Sara also

1117
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,580
the yamaha mounted rider and running

1118
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,560
in third right now,

1119
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,200
Robbie Ampoliski, whose been

1120
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,020
having a good dice with Tom Sarah. Of course

1121
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,090
the distant fourth and a rather lonely forth

1122
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,020
right now is Jason Rolap whose just been

1123
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,920
riding his own pace as the rest of the

1124
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,600
field about two terms behind that front

1125
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,220
pack. The privateer rider has been just

1126
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:26,260
astounding in this race is right now

1127
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,640
Rolap starting on the 10th grid

1128
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,860
position has already moved his way up to

1129
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,190
fourth which we're accustomed

1130
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:37,700
to seeing Jason Rolap do... the privateteer does very well but I have

1131
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,060
to make note of the fact that his

1132
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,480
riding style is so much different than

1133
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,820
I've been accustomed to seeing. He's riding

1134
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:45,800
like Mike Hailwood. He's barely hanging off

1135
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,200
the bike. The lean angles on this bike

1136
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,640
are tremendous in comparison to the

1137
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,730
hanging off style that Jason Rolap I'm

1138
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:55,440
used to seeing with Jason. I'm just

1139
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,390
pondering, perhaps Jason is injured

1140
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:58,440
somehow or another

1141
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,630
or perhaps is having a difficult time

1142
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:02,840
hanging off the motorcycle.

1143
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:06,540
And the riders have taken uh have taken the white flag

1144
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,370
and are moving across the start/finish

1145
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:10,620
line it is Larry Cochran, Tom Sara and

1146
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,660
Robbie Ampolski and of course Jason

1147
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,380
Rolap running a distant and lonely fourth

1148
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,460
right now. They head off in to that fast

1149
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,960
left-hander turn number one and down

1150
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,340
the short shoot and into turn number 2...

1151
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,400
Oh no... it looks like Robbie Ampolski

1152
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,690
under braking is trying to get

1153
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:26,660
underneath of Tom Sarah and ladies and

1154
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,340
gentlemen he's washed the front end and

1155
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,320
off into the dirt

1156
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,600
Robbie Ampolski is up is and OK but that

1157
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,640
puts Cochran solidly in the lead now as

1158
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,740
Sara had to break really hard to get uhh...

1159
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,840
to steer clear of the Ampolski

1160
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,090
crash and Jason Rolap now finds

1161
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:44,580
himself in 3rd. They're working their way

1162
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,310
through the rest of the infield and out

1163
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:49,620
onto the high banking and again I don't

1164
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,330
know if Tom Sarah has enough steam

1165
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:53,340
to get past Larry Cochran the first

1166
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,610
place rider. Tom Sarah also on the

1167
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:58,340
Yamaha right now, the two of them heading

1168
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,780
around the high banking down the long

1169
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,220
back straightaway through the chicane

1170
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:03,980
for the last time. Rolap as I said whose

1171
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:06,180
been riding as if he was stiff or perhaps

1172
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:09,000
injured in that third place now appears

1173
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,590
to be riding the pace to the checkered

1174
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:13,040
flag. This is the run for the checkers

1175
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:13,760
and in fact

1176
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,640
taking the checkered flag... Larry Cohcrine, Tom

1177
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,630
Sarah and here comes Jason Rolap

1178
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:24,520
rounding out your top third. So the racers

1179
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,000
just about in from their cool off lap.

1180
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:28,640
We're heading down to victory

1181
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,340
circle right now. We're gonna be conducting our

1182
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:33,820
winner's circle interviews and our top

1183
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:35,960
finishers coming in right now. First and

1184
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,540
second place bikes on their cool off lap.

1185
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,150
Waving to the crowd... the third-place

1186
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:44,420
finisher Jason Rolap... high tailing it into

1187
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,780
the pits and now he's heading into

1188
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:51,140
the winner's circle and boy, I'll tell ya, he's cooking into

1189
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:53,540
the winner's circle pretty fast.

1190
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:02,640
Well ladies and gentlemen, there's gotta be

1191
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,820
something seriously wrong here... Jason Rolap

1192
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:07,940
has just fallen over on his motorcycle that

1193
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,560
could have something to do with his

1194
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,400
riding. I suspect we need to get to med

1195
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,400
crew down here as Jason Rolap apparently

1196
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,160
having... is passed out or something but not

1197
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,860
even putting his feet down tipping over on

1198
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:21,440
the bike so a crowd gathering around Jason

1199
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,240
Rolap right now and we'll get some medical

1200
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,460
attention to him right away but he

1201
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,480
doesn't appear to be unconsciousness infact

1202
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,600
he's pulling his helmet off so I would

1203
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,730
have no idea why Jason Rolap would just

1204
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:34,120
come in and fall down.

1205
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,760
Perhaps a cramp or something like that

1206
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,360
but wait a minute here...

1207
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,160
I'm looking over... I'm trying to move through

1208
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,440
the crowd here as a crowd's gathered

1209
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,100
around this young gentleman here that

1210
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,920
while he's wearing Jason Rolap's

1211
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,000
leathers it sure doesn't look like Jason

1212
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,980
Rolap...

1213
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:51,300
It's a familiar face however...

Welcome back to bike week magazine.

1225
01:22:49,349 --> 01:22:51,510
12 years without riding a motorcycle but

1226
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:53,060
still loved it never lost that passion

1227
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:54,340
then what happened?

1228
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,120
Now I'm racing again.

1229
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,740
Moto Liberty stepped forward and gave me

1230
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,300
a 125 ride and I have been racing since

1231
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,480
February. Won my first race and took second

1232
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,440
last weekend so I'm doing pretty good.

1233
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,900
It started with a street bike didn't it?

1234
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:10,340
Yeah, I started on a cbr900rr and I just moved

1235
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:11,420
on from there.

1236
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,600
The motorcycle that

1237
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,620
you are racing... it's a 125 CC and I kid you not...

1238
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,760
The guy is fast. You operation

1239
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,280
entirely with your hands.

1240
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,120
That's true. I

1241
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,860
have a shifter switch on the left grip

1242
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:24,080
that operates an electromagnetic solenoid

1243
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,120
that allows me shift up and down.

1244
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,220
That takes care of that problem. What about

1245
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:29,000
the breaking?

1246
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:29,960
The breaking on the

1247
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,250
street bike or the race bike rather is

1248
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:34,880
basically all in the front. A lot of the guys

1249
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:36,960
rely on just the front brake. Some of

1250
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,190
the guys use the back break but on a

1251
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:40,660
125 it's so light... a lot of guys don't even

1252
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,420
use the breaks at all. They just use... rely on

1253
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,400
the downshifting.

1254
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,580
And while all of this is

1255
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,560
going on the obvious question has to be

1256
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,420
what do you do with your feet?

1257
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,380
The answer to that is Velcro.

1258
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:51,180
I need to get like a...

1259
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,520
sponsorship from Velcro because I buy so much of it I

1260
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,340
got it... I got it on my knees and on my

1261
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,480
foot pegs and on the soles of my boots.

1262
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,220
And that holds everything together. Then

1263
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,940
the large appendage on the tank is?

1264
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,100
It's because I am paralyzed at such a high

1265
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,920
level I don't have my ab muscles.

1266
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,500
So uhh... the pad up here allows me to free

1267
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,720
up my arm so I can ride.

1268
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,140
Oh man... that was fun.

1269
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,100
That was sweet dude. Right at the line.

1270
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,900
At the start they threw the flag before we ...

1271
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,400
You are a brave individual.

1272
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,300
I just do what I love doing Larry.

1273
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,200
And an inspiration I might add.

1274
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,380
I hope so.

1275
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:30,440
Folks, I gotta tell ya. This is no

1276
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,340
joke. It is no nothing other than a guy

1277
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,780
doing what he wants to do what he loves

1278
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:37,180
to do and he does go fast. He won his

1279
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:39,340
first race here a while back, has had

1280
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,080
several runner-up finishes and we want

[Inspirational piano music plays.]

1285
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,120
Why you doing this?

1286
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,420
Don't you hear what I'm saying?

1287
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:58,420
Sorry... sorry cut.

1288
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,980
That's insane. thing you're going to stand

1289
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:03,340
You're insane.

1290
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:05,380
You think I'm just gonna stand here and let you kill my son?

1291
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,120
I don't know what the hell you're going to do.

1292
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,120
You know I almost lost him once

1293
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,400
I'm not gonna lose him again.

1294
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,560
Yeah... well... don't be so sure.

1295
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:25,220
Bring me back some beer.

1296
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,040
Are you done with all this now?

1297
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:34,100
[Phone rings.]

1298
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,220
Cut... Ha ha ha...

1299
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:39,400
Some where along the line I got side tracked.

1300
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,380
Really? Doing what?

1301
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,620
Drinking... mostly.

1302
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,780
I'm gonna go in the house and shoot myself.

1303
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:51,280
Cut.

1304
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,980
Oh yeah? Doing what?

1305
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,500
Drinkin' mostly.

1306
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,620
Yep.

1307
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,900
Watchin' pornos...

1308
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:01,320
Cut.

1309
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,820
It's not like getting a part of you back...

1310
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:06,640
It's probably will take more away from you. Can't

1311
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,500
you see that?

1312
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:13,460
Lisa, I love you and I'd do anything for you...

1313
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,380
but this is for me.

1314
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,800
Ha ha ha ha...

1315
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:18,820
Is it that funny?

1316
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:20,840
Or are you crying?

1317
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,220
I have to do this.

1318
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,020
Why can't you see that?

1319
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,940
Lisa... I love you. I'd do anything for you...

1320
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,100
[Fire alarm beeps. Laughter.]

1321
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:38,860
Fire alarm. Fry's are done.

1322
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:42,920
Ha ha ha ha Let the dog come in. He can come in.

1323
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,960
So Gene's got a dog. Come here.

1324
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:47,940
Hey madman.

1325
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,480
Time out. Hello.

1326
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,820
Hey there Madman. How's the arm?

1327
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,600
Go back to sleep. I'm gonna go out early.

1328
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,200
I'll have Ron pick you up on the way out.

1329
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,940
Alright cut. Excellent.

1330
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:11,060
?????

1331
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:15,140
It hurts.

1332
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,900
Yeah I bet it does.

1333
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,800
They give you anything for the pain?

1334
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,980
Tylenol with codeine. humm...

1335
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,140
Well when you get the Demerol let me know. I'd like to borrow a few.

1336
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,220
Bye.

1337
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:29,260
Cut.

1338
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,820
Oh... the phone rings again.

1339
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:33,260
It rings again but I wanna cut.

1340
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,440
Alright cut. beep beep.

1341
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,520

OK that's good... and....

Action.

1348

01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,640
And watch the phone... and... action.

1350

Yeah.

1354
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,480
What are you thinking about?

1355
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,100
I don't know. Just can't sleep

1356
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,680
Why?

1357
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:30,820

1358
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:35,600

01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:59,740
Well I had to pistol whip some trailer trash

1361
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:05,140
down in Yuka Vally just to get a hold of some of the loco lightning man.
