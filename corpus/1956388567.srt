4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Tell me what happened, David.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,700
In detail.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
These photos don't have
enough detail on 'em?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I wanna hear it from you,
in your words, from the beginning.

8
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,000
I just finished my shift...
at the hospital.

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,000
I was going home.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,000
- Woa!
- David, quit that up.

11
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,170
I am! It's comming with me
and I'm on my way out.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,900
They'll kill you, you know.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,600
Let me exoverrated.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,780
After that, nothing.

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,500
What do you do at the hospital?

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,380
I'm a glorified janitor.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I clean up after sick people.

18
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,200
Do you have any enemies there?

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,300
Spies have enemies, I'm an ordaly.

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
So you have no clue why
anyone wanna do this to you?

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
No.

22
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm nothing here.
Bleding into the walls.

23
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't know why, - whoever
did this to me - picked me.

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,000
But they did.

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,500
What do you remember next?

26
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,100
Waking up.

27
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,100
Hello, David.

28
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,000
You don't know me, but I know you.

29
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,400
I want to play a game.

30
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll give you a demonstration of
what happens if you loose.

31
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,000
The device you are wearing is hooked
into your upper and lower jaws.

32
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,500
When the timer at the back goes off
your mouth will be ripped permanently open.

33
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,500
Think of it like a reverse bear trap.

34
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,200
I'll show you.

35
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,500
There is only one key to open the device.

36
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,800
It is in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

37
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Look around, David.
Know that I'm not lying.

38
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Live or die.

39
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Make...your...choice.

40
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,200
It says here, in the report...

41
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
...that after the timer started,
that's when you saw the body.

42
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,500
Paralysis, he wasn't dead he just couldn't move.

43
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,700
- You cut open someone who was still breathing.
- I know!

44
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,800
What happened after you've found the key?

45
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,200
Congratulation, David.

46
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
You are still alive.

47
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Most people are so ungreatful to be alive.

48
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But not you... not anymore.

49
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you greatful, David?

50
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,600
SAW
