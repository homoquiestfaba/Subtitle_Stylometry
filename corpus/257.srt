1
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,170
Come, come!

2
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:24,771
Please!

3
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,787
Aziz. Aziz.

4
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,031
Aziz, light!

5
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:49,625
Aziz...

6
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:50,793
light.

7
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:52,795
Good.

8
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,698
We start again.

9
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:59,302
"When the three planets
are in eclipse...

10
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,641
the black hole,
like a door, is open.

11
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:03,647
Evil comes...

12
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:06,150
spreading terror and chaos."

13
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,812
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.

14
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:12,892
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I've got your snakes.

15
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,550
I got all the snakes.

16
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,993
When is the snake act
supposed to occur?

17
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,496
If this is the five...

18
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,828
and this is the one...

19
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,334
every 5,000 years.

20
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:33,005
So, I've got some time then.

21
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:43,016
You bring them water.

22
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:46,018
Good boy.
I'll take it to them.

23
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:48,027
Go with God.
Be safe from evil.

24
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,427
You see here these different peoples,
or symbols of people...

25
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:55,694
gathering the four elements
of life...

26
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,703
water, fire, earth, air...

27
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,771
around a fifth one.

28
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,275
A fifth...

29
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:04,404
element.

30
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,610
Forgive me, Lord.

31
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:11,718
They already know
too much.

32
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,521
Father.

33
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:19,154
How are you?

34
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:21,388
- Well. You have some glasses?
- Of course.

35
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:25,398
I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.

36
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,966
It's the greatest find
in history.

37
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:29,466
You must be parched.

38
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,467
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:35,142 --> 00:05:36,973
It's like a battle plan.

40
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:38,735
Here the good.

41
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,144
Here the evil.

42
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:42,574
And here, a weapon...

43
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,809
against evil.

44
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,647
I'm going
to be famous.

45
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:51,750
Then let us toast
to your fame.

46
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:54,256
To fame.

47
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:56,156
Salute.

48
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,932
You can't toast
with water.

49
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:04,333
Billy, in my sack,
the grappa.

50
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,846
This I don't understand.

51
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,509
This could be something...

52
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:21,784
prehistoric.

53
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:23,346
I don't know.

54
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,358
But, wait.

55
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,025
Here.

56
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:37,365
Look, look.

57
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:49,874
They're here.

58
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:57,047
This man...

59
00:06:57,558 --> 00:06:59,651
this perfect being.

60
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,322
I know this is the key.
I know it.

61
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,729
This divine light
they talk about.

62
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,896
What is divine light?

63
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,570
Aziz, light!

64
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,512
Much better.
Thank you.

65
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:37,687
My Lord.

66
00:08:19,974 --> 00:08:23,910
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I've ever seen.

67
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,307
Don't you think?

68
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,144
Are you German?

69
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,314
Lord...

70
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,481
I know he was about
to discover everything.

71
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:39,752
But, no worry.

72
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:41,723
I was there in time.

73
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,223
Priest...

74
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,058
you and those before you...

75
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:48,167
have served us well.

76
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:49,563
But war is coming.

77
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,831
Stones not safe
on Earth anymore.

78
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,683
This...

79
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:13,857
is really amazing.

80
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,060
The fifth element.

81
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,887
Take the stones.

82
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:32,705
My Lord...

83
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:35,173
if you take the weapon,
we'll be defenseless...

84
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:36,604
when evil returns.

85
00:10:36,777 --> 00:10:38,938
In 300 years...

86
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:41,343
when evil returns...

87
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,506
so shall we.

88
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:52,950
Oh, Professor.

89
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:54,616
Professor.

90
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:02,633
Don't move!

91
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:05,872
I have a gun!

92
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,498
Please, understand.
They're our friends.

93
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:10,737
Friends?

94
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:14,474
Father, they've killed the Professor!
They're monsters!

95
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,140
I'll explain everything.

96
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:18,849
- You're with them?
- Look at me.

97
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,250
I am your friend.

98
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,812
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!

99
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,719
Please, put...

100
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,087
the gun down.

101
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,388
Billy, no!

102
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:37,826
Hurry!

103
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:39,233
The wall is closing!

104
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,237
Here is your mission:

105
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:43,569
Pass your knowledge
to the next priest...

106
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:45,305
as it was passed to you.

107
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,244
I will do as
you command, but...

108
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:49,245
hurry, you still
have time.

109
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,179
Time not important.

110
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:52,842
Only life...

111
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,080
important.

112
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,192
I will fulfill
my mission!

113
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:11,861
You can count on me!

114
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,542
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.

115
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:48,831
Anything yet?

116
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,241
- Not even a temperature?
- The analyzers have jammed.

117
00:12:51,412 --> 00:12:53,903
One shows a million degrees,
the others minus 5,000.

118
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,138
Let's see it.

119
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,425
It's taking shape.

120
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,678
Send out a probe.

121
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:37,621
Ladies and gentlemen...

122
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,922
the President of
the Federated Territories.

123
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,425
On air with General Staedert
in 30 seconds.

124
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:55,602
I saved this seat
for you, Father.

125
00:13:57,678 --> 00:13:59,009
President on the line.

126
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:00,441
We're in position.

127
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:03,674
I have to address the Supreme Council.
Just the facts.

128
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:06,319
There are no results from the chemical
and molecular analysis yet.

129
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,218
All the calibers are overshot.

130
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,119
We're initiating
thermonucleatic imaging.

131
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,088
What you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.

132
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,788
All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.

133
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:16,852
Recommendation?

134
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:20,024
My philosophy is
shoot first and ask questions later.

135
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,668
I don't like uninvited guests.

136
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,964
All right, then.

137
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:25,196
Mr. President?

138
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,371
Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.

139
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:33,370
I...

140
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:36,209
have a different theory
to offer you, sir.

141
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,140
You have 20 seconds.

142
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,388
Imagine that this...

143
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,657
thing is not anything
that can be identified...

144
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,060
because it prefers not to be.

145
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,889
Wherever there is life...

146
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,001
it brings death...

147
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:58,062
because it's evil.

148
00:14:58,238 --> 00:14:59,170
Absolute evil.

149
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,897
One more reason
to shoot first.

150
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,736
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

151
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:06,402
Shooting will only
make it stronger.

152
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,916
Probe will obtain objective
in five seconds.

153
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,352
Growth rate is at 27%.

154
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:22,427
Your theory is interesting,
but we don't have time to go into it.

155
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:26,088
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.

156
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,734
You're right.
That's exactly what we'll do.

157
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,930
We'll protect the life of 200 billion
of my fellow citizens.

158
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,700
You may fire when ready.

159
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:37,039
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.

160
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,950
Its structure solidified
on the surface.

161
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:48,781
I think it's anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.

162
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:50,287
The most...

163
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:53,051
terrible intelligence imaginable.

164
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,222
120's loaded.

165
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:00,059
The ship is
in combat formation.

166
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:02,134
Missiles are loaded.

167
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:03,462
- Staedert.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,127
I have a doubt.

169
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:07,235
I don't, Mr. President.

170
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:21,153
What happened?
Can you hear me?

171
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:23,078
What happened?

172
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:25,817
- Did you destroy it?
- I'm about to.

173
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:34,429
The planet has increased
diameter by 200%.

174
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:36,091
It's moving toward the ship.

175
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:43,674
What do we have
that's bigger than 240?

176
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:45,175
Nothing, sir.

177
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:48,107
Staedert, do you hear me?

178
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:49,779
Get out of there.

179
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:53,180
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me?

180
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:56,516
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?

181
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,681
Do you understand?
Listen.

182
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,454
That's an order.

183
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,795
Do you understand me?
Do you hear me?

184
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,959
Get out of there!

185
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,968
Good God!

186
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:34,989
Four a day.

187
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:48,906
I'm tryin'.

188
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:51,576
To quit is my goal.

189
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,607
I'm up.

190
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,746
All right, I'm up.

191
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:04,185
God.

192
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:10,227
Hey, dog brain,
Finger here.

193
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,286
Hi, sweetie.

194
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:12,627
I love you too.

195
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,394
You haven't called me that
since basic training.

196
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:16,529
I was talking
to the cat.

197
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,230
I forgot...

198
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,865
you prefer your cat
to the real thing.

199
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,531
At least the cat
comes back.

200
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:24,870
Still pining
for that two-timing slut?

201
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:26,376
There's millions
out there.

202
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:28,107
I don't want
a million.

203
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,209
I just want one.

204
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,384
The perfect one.

205
00:18:32,552 --> 00:18:34,213
It don't exist, Major.

206
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,219
Yeah, I know.

207
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:38,213
What?

208
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,280
Picture of you.

209
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:40,892
- How do I look?
- Like shit.

210
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:42,494
Must be an old picture.

211
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:45,823
Bring me your hack
for a six-month overhaul.

212
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,294
- Negative.
- A.S.A.P.

213
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:48,623
I don't need one.

214
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:52,898
Who sat next to you for 1,000 missions?
I know how you drive.

215
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:55,735
Finger, I drive
a cab now...

216
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,570
not a space fighter.

217
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:01,475
Tell me. How many points
you got left on your license?

218
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:03,809
Major, how many points?

219
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,417
At least 50.

220
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:08,045
Know what?
You gotta learn to lie better.

221
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:09,452
See you tonight.

222
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,659
Welcome to Paradise.

223
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,525
Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.

224
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:21,590
It's Ruby Rhod,
and I'll tell you live at five...

225
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:24,999
the winner of the super green
Gemini Croquette Contest!

226
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:28,471
The winner will go with me
for two days to Fhloston Paradise.

227
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,271
Tune in to Radio Cosmos.

228
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:33,504
Don't watch all day.
It'll rot your brain.

229
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,011
For a perfect world.

230
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:42,048
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?

231
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:44,613
Long enough.
Give me the cash.

232
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,520
Is that a Z-140?

233
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:47,955
Alleviated titanium.

234
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,527
Neurocharged assault model.

235
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,789
Good thing for me
it's not loaded.

236
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:56,199
It's not loaded?

237
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:57,867
You have to...

238
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:00,965
push that yellow button
to load it.

239
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:06,303
Take your time.

240
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:10,678
Want me to--

241
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:15,386
There you go.

242
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:17,546
Give me the cash!

243
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:25,494
That's a very
dangerous gun.

244
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:28,828
Maybe you better let me
hang on to this one for you.

245
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,771
You don't mind, do you?
You sure?

246
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:35,069
No. Take it.
I don't need it.

247
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,903
That's a nice hat.

248
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:43,447
You like it?

249
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:45,377
God!

250
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,221
Please enter your license.

251
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,420
Yes, just a minute.

252
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,320
Welcome, Mr. Dallas.

253
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:00,794
Good morning.

254
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,400
Sleep well? Me too.

255
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:04,461
I had a horrible nightmare.

256
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:05,660
Propulsion 2-X-4.

257
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,640
You have five points left
on your license.

258
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,304
Yeah, thank you
for reminding me.

259
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,581
Have a nice day.

260
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:20,981
Why not?

261
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,827
You have 48 hours.

262
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:33,989
That's the time it needs to adapt
itself to our living conditions.

263
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,158
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.

264
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,772
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...

265
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,336
but to exterminate life.

266
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,009
All forms of life.

267
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,113
You're telling me
there's nothing that can stop this.

268
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,612
There is only one thing.

269
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:59,188
The Mondoshawan have in their
possession the weapon to defeat evil.

270
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,350
Four elements...

271
00:22:01,928 --> 00:22:03,919
gathered around a fifth...

272
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:06,892
supreme being,
the ultimate warrior...

273
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,898
created to protect life.

274
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,163
Together they produce
"The Light of Creation."

275
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,402
Able to bring life to the farthest
reaches of the universe.

276
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:18,169
But, if...

277
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:20,404
evil stands there...

278
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:23,243
Then what?

279
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,677
Then light turns to dark.

280
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:27,342
Life to death...

281
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:28,747
forever.

282
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:36,028
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests
permission to enter our territory.

283
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:40,931
Give it permission to enter
with our warmest regards.

284
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:42,090
Thank you.

285
00:22:42,435 --> 00:22:44,266
Permission to enter granted.

286
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:02,544
Show time.

287
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:45,663
We are lost.

288
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,663
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.

289
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:55,002
Mr. Zorg's office.

290
00:23:55,175 --> 00:23:56,437
It's Aknot.

291
00:23:56,776 --> 00:24:00,007
I'm so glad
to hear you, Aknot.

292
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,680
The mission is accomplished.

293
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:06,278
You'll have what you asked for
in a few hours.

294
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,111
Good.
I'll meet you at my factory.

295
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:12,789
The attack was by
two unregistered warships.

296
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:15,521
Close all borders and
declare a state of general alert.

297
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:18,630
Try to contact the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.

298
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:22,298
Three hundred years
of waiting for nothing.

299
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:24,526
Go get some rest.

300
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:25,963
No.

301
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,131
The Mondoshawan...

302
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:29,968
I am their contact.

303
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:31,542
They will come for me.

304
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:34,373
This is government business.
I'll keep you informed.

305
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:39,808
The rescue team has reported
from the crash site.

306
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:41,385
Any survivors?

307
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:42,885
Only one.

308
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,649
You call that a survivor?

309
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:49,956
A few cells still alive.
More than I need.

310
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,496
Have you identified it?

311
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,154
The computer went
off the charts.

312
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:56,166
Normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups...

313
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:58,896
which is enough
for any species to perpetuate.

314
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:02,064
This has 200,000 memo groups.

315
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,069
Sounds like
a freak of nature.

316
00:25:08,848 --> 00:25:11,248
Yeah, can't wait
to meet him.

317
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,690
You okay?
Over here.

318
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:23,028
Excuse me.

319
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:30,525
General, I want
to show you something.

320
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,971
This is a normal
human DNA chain.

321
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,201
You, me, anybody, right?

322
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:37,707
Watch this.

323
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:42,043
The compositional elements
of his DNA chain are like ours.

324
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:45,446
There's simply more of them,
with infinite genetic knowledge.

325
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:48,382
Almost like this being
was engineered.

326
00:25:52,392 --> 00:25:53,791
Is there any danger?

327
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,053
We put it through
the cellular hygiene detector.

328
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,223
The cell is,
for lack of a better word...

329
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:00,230
perfect.

330
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,469
Go ahead.

331
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:05,397
Mr. Perfect better be polite.

332
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:07,631
Otherwise, I turn him
into cat food.

333
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,473
Activate it.

334
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,339
Tissue processing.

335
00:26:56,022 --> 00:26:59,116
Ten seconds to
ultraviolet protection.

336
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:06,692
This is the last phase.

337
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:10,996
The cells are bombarded by atoms
which forces the body to react.

338
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:12,636
That means
growing skin.

339
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:14,203
Wonderful.

340
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,876
Reconstruction complete.

341
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:26,810
Remove the shield.

342
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:37,719
I told you.
Perfect.

343
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:47,501
Thermal bandages.

344
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:53,401
I'd...

345
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:56,238
like to take
a few pictures...

346
00:27:57,183 --> 00:27:58,582
for the archives.

347
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:00,743
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

348
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:02,474
Activate the phonic detector.

349
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:17,323
Is that thing solid?

350
00:29:17,497 --> 00:29:18,930
- Unbreakable.
- Good.

351
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:30,598
If you want out...

352
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:34,674
you'll have to develop
those communication skills.

353
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:54,030
General alert.

354
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:22,160
Perfect.

355
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,430
Ladder on 18.

356
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:31,759
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.

357
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,150
This way.

358
00:31:27,593 --> 00:31:29,424
Lady, stay calm.

359
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:31,153
This is the police.

360
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:33,427
There's nowhere
else to go.

361
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,592
Slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.

362
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:39,327
Do you understand?

363
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:44,073
She doesn't.

364
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,629
I think we need
a flying unit.

365
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,030
This is the police.

366
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,471
This is the police.

367
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:18,701
We are processing
your identification.

368
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:21,369
Put your arms up
and follow our instructions.

369
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,721
She has no file.

370
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,326
She dove off.

371
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,741
You just had an accident.

372
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,911
Yes, I know I just had an accident,
you daffy bastard!

373
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:06,687
You have one point left
on your license.

374
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,386
Look out!

375
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:09,758
Left!

376
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:16,367
I can't believe it.
Shit.

377
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,698
Any survivors?

378
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:30,704
Hi.

379
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:35,545
Are you okay?

380
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,314
Boom.

381
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:06,974
Boom. Yeah,
I understand "boom."

382
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,144
Bada boom.

383
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,078
Big.

384
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,724
Big bada boom.

385
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:13,816
Big...

386
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,752
bada big boom.

387
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,259
Big boom.

388
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,829
Yeah, big bada boom.

389
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:20,158
Bada boom.

390
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,767
Big boom.
Big bada boom.

391
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,500
You're lucky you're not dead.

392
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:33,270
This is a police control.

393
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,275
Please keep your hands
on the wheel.

394
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,441
You have an unauthorized passenger
in your vehicle.

395
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,519
We are going
to arrest her.

396
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:43,348
Thank you for cooperating.

397
00:34:43,522 --> 00:34:44,955
Sorry, honey.

398
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,024
Looks like
this is your ride.

399
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,252
Open the door.

400
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,362
Do what they say.

401
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:55,693
Sorry.

402
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:20,484
"Please...

403
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:22,717
help."

404
00:35:22,895 --> 00:35:24,556
I only have one point
left on my license.

405
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,430
I need it to get back to the garage
and get the cab a six-month overhaul.

406
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:29,995
You understand?

407
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:34,237
Can you please
open the passenger door?

408
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:38,335
Please...

409
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:41,745
help.

410
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:44,906
I can't.

411
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,020
I repeat...

412
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,819
open the passenger door.

413
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:55,690
Yeah, yeah, sure.

414
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:57,192
Why not?

415
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,106
Thank you
for your cooperation.

416
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:17,613
Help.

417
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:21,109
Finger's going
to kill me.

418
00:36:29,128 --> 00:36:30,720
Emergency!
Emergency!

419
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,557
One point has
been removed.

420
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:34,798
Yes, I know!

421
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,903
This is so stupid.

422
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,472
Assist in pursuit
of yellow cab.

423
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:47,635
Unit 47,
we're on the way...

424
00:36:47,813 --> 00:36:49,144
after we finish lunch.

425
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,075
Two golden menus.

426
00:36:55,154 --> 00:36:59,818
I'm too old, too tired and too hungry
to go chasing some hot rod.

427
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,252
Thank you so much.

428
00:37:06,832 --> 00:37:09,164
And I'm definitely
too thirsty.

429
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:11,495
Look out!

430
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,265
We got lucky.

431
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,171
If they don't chase you after a mile,
they don't chase you.

432
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:29,718
Maybe two miles.

433
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,079
Hang on.

434
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,122
Look, lady...

435
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:44,964
I only speak English
and bad English!

436
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:48,362
Run an ID.

437
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:55,307
I'm all for conversation, but maybe
you can just shut up for a minute!

438
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,647
He's got a scan blocker.

439
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,548
Means he's a car thief.
Blast him.

440
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:07,587
I don't know
what you did...

441
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:11,328
but they are pissed off!

442
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,419
Hold on!

443
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:31,746
We're safe for a while.

444
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:59,135
You want to play soft?
I'll play soft.

445
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:02,712
You want to play hard?
Let's play hard.

446
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,457
If we get to the fog,
we'll be okay.

447
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:19,621
If we make the fog.

448
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,585
How do they expect us
to find anything in this shit?

449
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:50,151
We're just going to wait here until
things quiet down if you don't mind.

450
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:05,169
Shit.

451
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,851
You okay?

452
00:40:17,856 --> 00:40:19,118
Priest.

453
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,855
You don't need a priest,
just a doctor.

454
00:40:22,194 --> 00:40:25,288
Vito Cornelius.

455
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,453
What?

456
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,460
Priest.

457
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,759
Yes?

458
00:40:33,272 --> 00:40:35,604
I'm looking
for a priest.

459
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:38,504
The weddings are downstairs, my son.
Congratulations.

460
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,838
She's not my bride.
She's my fare.

461
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:44,906
She's looking for
Vito Cornelius.

462
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,975
The phone book
said he lived here.

463
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:50,180
Yes, that's me,
but I don't know who she is.

464
00:40:50,356 --> 00:40:52,950
Nobody does.
No file, no ID, nothing.

465
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,184
She's got a tattoo
on this arm.

466
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:58,023
Tattoo?

467
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:09,363
Fifth...

468
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:11,036
element.

469
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:18,377
Finger's going
to kill me.

470
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,146
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?

471
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,652
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.

472
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:27,222
She just dropped in on me.

473
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:29,827
Started speaking
a bizarre language.

474
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:32,395
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.

475
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,362
It's the ancient language...

476
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:37,596
spoken throughout the universe
before time was time.

477
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:40,502
He's a she.

478
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:42,039
You noticed that.

479
00:41:42,908 --> 00:41:44,239
Yes.

480
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,846
- It's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.

481
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,781
Not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.

482
00:41:53,852 --> 00:41:56,685
But gently,
because this woman is...

483
00:41:56,755 --> 00:41:59,246
mankind's most precious possession.

484
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,052
She is perfect.

485
00:42:05,764 --> 00:42:07,095
Perfect.

486
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:15,437
More dignified.

487
00:42:15,507 --> 00:42:17,168
Hey, lady...

488
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:18,573
wake up.

489
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:31,714
I shouldn't
have done that.

490
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,222
It was wrong
to kiss you.

491
00:42:34,393 --> 00:42:36,054
He said
to wake you gently.

492
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:37,627
You're right.

493
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:43,067
Just thought you might
remember me from the cab.

494
00:42:43,635 --> 00:42:44,795
Remember?

495
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,059
"Bada boom?"

496
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:48,731
"Big bada boom?"

497
00:42:49,141 --> 00:42:51,803
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Look.

498
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:54,468
I drive a cab.
This is me.

499
00:42:54,646 --> 00:42:56,238
Korben Dallas.

500
00:42:57,149 --> 00:42:58,582
Korben.
You understand?

501
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:00,140
Here.

502
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,308
Take it.

503
00:43:02,187 --> 00:43:04,348
You can call me
when you learn English.

504
00:43:07,826 --> 00:43:09,316
Just kidding.

505
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:13,253
What is your name?

506
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,931
You.

507
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:17,658
Korben.

508
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:23,335
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.

509
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:25,432
Good.

510
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:28,439
All that's your name?

511
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:30,337
Do you have...

512
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:33,679
a shorter name?

513
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:37,950
Short.

514
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,353
Korben Dallas.

515
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,792
Leeloo.

516
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:49,126
Leeloo.

517
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:51,635
Korben, Leeloo.

518
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,631
Leeloo, Korben.

519
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,390
You're sure
she's a Supreme Being?

520
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:15,220
Absolutely sure.

521
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:16,827
Old friends.

522
00:44:18,063 --> 00:44:19,325
Yeah, you're right.

523
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:22,327
- Ask her for my gun back.
- What's your name?

524
00:44:22,668 --> 00:44:23,828
Korben Dallas.

525
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,833
Thank you for your help.

526
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:29,838
You've been kind,
but now the girl needs to rest.

527
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:32,038
She's been on
a long trip.

528
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,408
I know.
I was there when she landed.

529
00:44:35,347 --> 00:44:36,905
Wait, wait, Father.

530
00:44:37,182 --> 00:44:40,583
She said something
I didn't understand.

531
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:42,083
What does
"ekto gamat" mean?

532
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:44,578
"Never without my permission."

533
00:44:45,257 --> 00:44:46,747
That's what I thought.

534
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,761
I shouldn't have
kissed her.

535
00:45:02,207 --> 00:45:05,938
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I forgot your food.

536
00:45:07,546 --> 00:45:09,878
How about some
nice Thai food?

537
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:12,039
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

538
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:14,617
Buddy, I'm waiting
all day here.

539
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:16,547
- Finger.
- Where's the cab?

540
00:45:16,722 --> 00:45:18,622
Car's running fine.

541
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,553
Fine. What "fine"?

542
00:45:20,726 --> 00:45:23,559
I know you.
"Fine" ain't in your vocabulary.

543
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:26,027
You can tell your old buddy Finger
what happened.

544
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:27,495
What? You save the planet?

545
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,234
You dinged the fender again.
That's it, right?

546
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:36,074
I was on my way to see you,
and a fare fell in my lap.

547
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:39,404
One of these big fares
you can't resist.

548
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:41,476
How big?

549
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,752
Five-nine...

550
00:45:52,324 --> 00:45:53,586
blue eyes...

551
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:55,750
long legs, great skin.

552
00:45:56,094 --> 00:45:57,823
You know?
Perfect.

553
00:45:58,163 --> 00:45:59,653
I see.

554
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:03,665
And this perfect fare,
she got a name?

555
00:46:06,104 --> 00:46:07,332
Leeloo.

556
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:16,108
What's she doing?

557
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:19,273
Learning our history,
the last 5,000 years that she missed.

558
00:46:19,451 --> 00:46:21,112
She's been asleep
for a while.

559
00:46:33,298 --> 00:46:36,529
I know she's been through a lot,
but we don't have much time.

560
00:46:36,635 --> 00:46:37,795
You're right.

561
00:46:40,305 --> 00:46:41,704
Chicken.

562
00:46:41,873 --> 00:46:43,135
Good.

563
00:46:46,545 --> 00:46:48,035
Chicken.

564
00:46:52,818 --> 00:46:56,151
I'm really sorry
to interrupt you, but...

565
00:46:56,321 --> 00:46:57,720
the case...

566
00:46:58,223 --> 00:46:59,815
with the stones...

567
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,048
where is it?

568
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:05,660
Stolen?

569
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:10,895
Who in God's name
would do such a thing?

570
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:16,899
Excuse me, sir.

571
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:19,136
The council is worried
about the economy heating up.

572
00:47:19,244 --> 00:47:21,906
Is it possible
to fire 500,000?

573
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,517
I thought from a smaller company,
like one of the cab companies.

574
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:28,516
Fire one million.

575
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:30,746
But 500,000--

576
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:36,858
One million.

577
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:38,017
Fine, sir.

578
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,193
Sorry to have
disturbed you.

579
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:53,276
It's for the Supreme...

580
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:56,707
Sorry.

581
00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:01,110
I didn't know your size,
and I found you this makeup box.

582
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:04,044
You just put it like that.

583
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:07,551
Yes, there was
a man with a limp...

584
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:11,387
came here a month ago
asking about the stones.

585
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:13,053
Said he was an art dealer.

586
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:17,796
What was his name?

587
00:48:19,738 --> 00:48:21,467
I'm bad with names.

588
00:48:27,746 --> 00:48:31,238
- They really make her--
- Perfect, I know.

589
00:48:35,487 --> 00:48:37,079
What'd she say?

590
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:41,181
She says she knows
exactly where they are.

591
00:48:44,763 --> 00:48:48,597
My dear Aknot, how about
those two planes you borrowed?

592
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,765
Aknot, is that you?

593
00:48:50,836 --> 00:48:52,599
What an ugly face.

594
00:48:52,771 --> 00:48:54,102
It doesn't suit you.

595
00:48:55,373 --> 00:48:56,431
Take it off.

596
00:48:58,777 --> 00:48:59,937
That's better.

597
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:01,772
Never be ashamed
of who you are.

598
00:49:02,047 --> 00:49:03,412
You're warriors.
Be proud.

599
00:49:04,115 --> 00:49:07,107
So what if the federal government
scattered you to the wind.

600
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:10,377
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

601
00:49:10,555 --> 00:49:13,388
Your time for revenge
is at hand.

602
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:16,051
The ZF-1.

603
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,222
It's light. The handle's adjustable
for easy carrying.

604
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,892
Breaks down into four parts,
undetectable by X-ray. Discreet.

605
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:28,062
A word on fire power:

606
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,801
Titanium recharger, 3,000-round clip,
with bursts of 3 to 300.

607
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:34,810
With the replay button,
a Zorg invention, it's even easier.

608
00:49:35,914 --> 00:49:37,074
One shot...

609
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:40,982
and replay sends every following shot
to the same location.

610
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:51,429
And to finish the job,
all the Zorg oldies but goldies.

611
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:53,152
Rocket launcher.

612
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,425
Arrow launcher...

613
00:49:56,835 --> 00:49:58,496
with exploding
or poisonous heads.

614
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:01,100
Very practical.

615
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,537
Net launcher.

616
00:50:04,009 --> 00:50:05,499
The flamethrower.

617
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:10,970
My favorite.

618
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:13,440
And for the grand finale...

619
00:50:13,618 --> 00:50:16,018
the new Ice Cube System.

620
00:50:24,629 --> 00:50:26,358
Four full crates...

621
00:50:26,531 --> 00:50:28,021
delivered right on time.

622
00:50:29,134 --> 00:50:31,125
And what about you,
dear Aknot?

623
00:50:31,303 --> 00:50:32,861
Did you bring
what I asked?

624
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:35,868
Yes.

625
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:42,873
Magnificent.

626
00:50:47,152 --> 00:50:48,210
This--

627
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:52,153
This case is empty.

628
00:50:53,658 --> 00:50:54,818
Empty?

629
00:50:54,993 --> 00:50:55,891
Empty...

630
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:57,722
the opposite of full.

631
00:50:58,229 --> 00:51:01,221
This case
is supposed to be full!

632
00:51:03,835 --> 00:51:05,393
Anyone care to explain?

633
00:51:07,572 --> 00:51:11,668
The Guardians gave the stones
to someone they could trust.

634
00:51:14,846 --> 00:51:16,905
Who took another route.

635
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:21,183
She's supposed
to contact this person...

636
00:51:21,353 --> 00:51:22,911
in a hotel.

637
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:28,855
And she's looking
for the address.

638
00:51:29,027 --> 00:51:30,085
Easy.

639
00:51:32,097 --> 00:51:33,257
Dot.

640
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,537
It's Planet Fhloston,
in the Angel Constellation.

641
00:51:42,374 --> 00:51:43,705
We're saved.

642
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,035
I'm screwed.

643
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,542
You asked for a case.
We brought one.

644
00:51:47,712 --> 00:51:50,112
A case with four stones
in it!

645
00:51:50,281 --> 00:51:52,545
Not one or two or three,
but four!

646
00:51:52,717 --> 00:51:53,945
Four stones!

647
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,952
But what the hell am I supposed to do
with an empty case?

648
00:51:57,122 --> 00:51:59,283
We are warriors,
not merchants.

649
00:51:59,457 --> 00:52:02,620
But you can still count!
Look at my fingers.

650
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:04,227
Four stones, four crates.

651
00:52:04,396 --> 00:52:07,297
Zero stones, zero crates!

652
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:10,397
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!

653
00:52:12,904 --> 00:52:15,065
We risked our lives.

654
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:19,140
I believe a little compensation
is in order.

655
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:23,411
So you are merchants
after all.

656
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:27,478
Leave him one crate
for the cause.

657
00:52:30,488 --> 00:52:31,819
I don't like warriors.

658
00:52:31,956 --> 00:52:33,287
Narrow-minded,
no subtlety...

659
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:36,657
and they fight
for hopeless causes, honor.

660
00:52:36,728 --> 00:52:39,663
Honor's killed millions of people.
Hasn't saved a single one.

661
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:42,265
I'll tell you what I do like:
a killer.

662
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:45,926
A dyed-in-the-wool killer,
cold-blooded, clean and methodical.

663
00:52:46,104 --> 00:52:48,095
A real killer
picking up the ZF-1...

664
00:52:48,273 --> 00:52:51,765
would've asked about the red button
on the bottom of the gun.

665
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:11,626
Bring me the priest.

666
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:16,690
I got everything we need
to know about Fhloston Paradise...

667
00:53:16,801 --> 00:53:18,325
and a blueprint
of the hotel.

668
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:21,764
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.

669
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,531
It won't be easy.
There's a charity ball tomorrow.

670
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:28,042
Flights are full,
and the hotel will be guarded.

671
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:29,646
There must be a way.

672
00:53:36,154 --> 00:53:37,143
I'll get it.

673
00:53:39,124 --> 00:53:40,113
Weddings?

674
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:43,826
Not really.

675
00:53:43,995 --> 00:53:46,828
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Who?

676
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:48,659
Mr. Zorg.

677
00:53:49,234 --> 00:53:50,223
Jean-Baptiste...

678
00:53:50,668 --> 00:53:51,566
Emmanuel...

679
00:53:51,736 --> 00:53:52,725
Zorg.

680
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:58,571
It's nice to see
you again, Father.

681
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:01,075
I remember you now.

682
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:04,173
The so-called art dealer.

683
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:06,406
I'm glad you got
your memory back.

684
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:08,415
Because you'll need it.

685
00:54:10,522 --> 00:54:12,012
Where are the stones?

686
00:54:12,857 --> 00:54:13,687
I don't know.

687
00:54:13,858 --> 00:54:16,190
If I did, I wouldn't tell
someone like you.

688
00:54:16,594 --> 00:54:17,686
Why?

689
00:54:18,363 --> 00:54:19,762
What's wrong with me?

690
00:54:19,931 --> 00:54:21,592
I try to serve life.

691
00:54:22,934 --> 00:54:24,595
But you only...

692
00:54:24,936 --> 00:54:26,369
want to destroy it.

693
00:54:27,038 --> 00:54:28,699
Father...

694
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,441
you're so wrong.

695
00:54:31,609 --> 00:54:32,769
Let me explain.

696
00:54:37,549 --> 00:54:41,781
Life, which you so nobly serve,
comes from destruction and chaos.

697
00:54:41,953 --> 00:54:43,386
Take this empty glass.

698
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:45,386
Here it is, peaceful...

699
00:54:45,557 --> 00:54:46,455
boring.

700
00:54:46,624 --> 00:54:48,455
But if it is...

701
00:54:49,294 --> 00:54:50,727
destroyed.

702
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,893
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.

703
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:59,798
Notice how each is useful.

704
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,731
What a lovely ballet ensues...

705
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:06,570
so full of form and color.

706
00:55:06,744 --> 00:55:10,145
Now think of all those people
that created them.

707
00:55:11,082 --> 00:55:14,745
Technicians, engineers. People who
can feed their children tonight...

708
00:55:14,919 --> 00:55:18,821
so those children can grow up
and have children...

709
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:20,321
and so on.

710
00:55:20,491 --> 00:55:23,483
Thus adding
to the great chain...

711
00:55:23,995 --> 00:55:25,485
of life.

712
00:55:27,932 --> 00:55:29,695
Water. Fruit.

713
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:33,498
You see, Father,
by creating a little destruction...

714
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:35,838
I'm encouraging life.

715
00:55:36,341 --> 00:55:39,276
In reality,
you and I are in the same business.

716
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:41,167
Cheers.

717
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,522
Where's the robot
to pat you on the back?

718
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:03,293
Or the engineer?

719
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,370
Or their children, maybe?

720
00:56:20,385 --> 00:56:24,481
There, you see how all your
so-called power counts for nothing?

721
00:56:25,156 --> 00:56:28,216
How your entire empire
of destruction comes...

722
00:56:28,393 --> 00:56:29,724
crashing down...

723
00:56:29,894 --> 00:56:32,226
all because of one, little...

724
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,061
cherry.

725
00:56:47,345 --> 00:56:49,006
You saved my life...

726
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,410
and in return,
I'll spare yours...

727
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,175
for now.

728
00:56:53,851 --> 00:56:55,182
You're a monster, Zorg.

729
00:56:57,188 --> 00:56:58,246
I know.

730
00:57:02,593 --> 00:57:05,187
Torture who you have to,
the President, I don't care.

731
00:57:05,263 --> 00:57:07,356
Just bring me the stones.

732
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:09,194
You have one hour.

733
00:57:24,382 --> 00:57:27,442
It's gobbling up
all the satellites in the galaxy.

734
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:30,280
Why is it eating up
all the satellites?

735
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:32,218
We're working on it.

736
00:57:43,968 --> 00:57:48,064
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident
but accept our apologies.

737
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:50,571
And the stones?
Did you find them?

738
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:51,731
They weren't on board.

739
00:57:51,876 --> 00:57:53,070
What?

740
00:57:53,244 --> 00:57:56,077
The Mondoshawan never
fully trusted the human race.

741
00:57:56,247 --> 00:57:58,078
They gave them
to someone they do trust.

742
00:57:58,983 --> 00:58:01,975
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She's a diva.

743
00:58:02,153 --> 00:58:05,486
She's singing at a charity ball
in Fhloston Paradise.

744
00:58:05,656 --> 00:58:07,419
She has the stones.

745
00:58:08,493 --> 00:58:09,926
The Mondoshawans will help.

746
00:58:10,094 --> 00:58:11,755
We must send someone...

747
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:13,260
to get the stones.

748
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:14,489
Excellent.

749
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:19,633
I want this operation to be
as discreet as possible.

750
00:58:20,004 --> 00:58:22,097
No troops.
No big operation.

751
00:58:22,774 --> 00:58:24,833
I want your best man
to go undercover.

752
00:58:25,009 --> 00:58:26,840
I have the perfect one.

753
00:58:30,181 --> 00:58:32,445
You've got a message.

754
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:34,980
Not opening it?
Could be important.

755
00:58:36,421 --> 00:58:38,480
Like the last two
were important.

756
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:42,255
First one was from my wife
telling me she's leaving.

757
00:58:42,593 --> 00:58:46,324
The second was from my lawyer
telling me he was leaving with my wife.

758
00:58:47,098 --> 00:58:48,497
That is bad luck.

759
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:49,826
Grandfather say...

760
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:53,437
"It never rain everyday."
This is good news, guaranteed.

761
00:58:54,605 --> 00:58:55,663
I bet you lunch.

762
00:58:56,841 --> 00:58:58,103
Okay.

763
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:02,339
Come on.

764
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:06,009
"You are fired."

765
00:59:07,452 --> 00:59:09,613
Oh, I'm sorry.

766
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,791
At least I won lunch.

767
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:18,292
Good philosophy.

768
00:59:18,463 --> 00:59:21,193
See good in bad.
I like.

769
00:59:21,399 --> 00:59:23,094
- Hello.
- Korben, sweetheart.

770
00:59:23,634 --> 00:59:25,693
You got broken fingers?
You can't punch my number?

771
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,759
Hi, Mom.

772
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:27,964
Seventeen messages.

773
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:31,575
Don't say your machine is broken again.
They last 1,000 years.

774
00:59:31,676 --> 00:59:33,234
Mr. Kim,
you should go.

775
00:59:33,377 --> 00:59:35,208
This'll take a minute.

776
00:59:35,379 --> 00:59:38,212
You don't feed your cat a croquette,
who you love more than me.

777
00:59:38,382 --> 00:59:40,714
She didn't breast-feed you.
I did.

778
00:59:42,386 --> 00:59:43,876
Good fortune for you.

779
00:59:44,055 --> 00:59:46,990
You don't have a girl.
I'll never be a grandmother.

780
00:59:47,158 --> 00:59:48,819
It bring you good luck!

781
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:59,402
My body's failing.
Take me on this trip.

782
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,901
What are you
talking about?

783
01:00:01,072 --> 01:00:02,835
You want to make me beg?

784
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:05,565
No, all I want
is an explanation.

785
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,803
I just got in.

786
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,845
I just smashed my cab.
I lost my job. I got mugged.

787
01:00:09,914 --> 01:00:11,438
Besides that,
everything's peachy.

788
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:13,247
Thanks for asking.

789
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:16,342
Now settle down
and explain this to me.

790
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:18,580
You don't know
you won a trip...

791
01:00:18,756 --> 01:00:21,748
to Fhloston Paradise for two
for ten days?

792
01:00:21,926 --> 01:00:25,589
I suppose you'll just leave me
on the lunar surface?

793
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:28,591
If I'd won a trip,
I'd know.

794
01:00:28,866 --> 01:00:30,766
I would've been notified.

795
01:00:32,537 --> 01:00:36,268
They've been blaring your name out
on the radio for an hour.

796
01:00:40,778 --> 01:00:41,938
I'll call you back.

797
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,883
General, how nice to see you
in the 5000 block.

798
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:52,279
Nice apartment.

799
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,553
You've settled
into a wonderful life.

800
01:00:54,725 --> 01:00:56,215
Heard you lost your job.

801
01:00:57,562 --> 01:00:59,052
You heard that?

802
01:01:00,298 --> 01:01:02,732
Don't worry.
I'll get another job.

803
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,959
Don't bother.
We have one for you.

804
01:01:05,636 --> 01:01:06,568
"Major Dallas...

805
01:01:06,737 --> 01:01:08,295
you've been selected
for a mission."

806
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:10,567
- What mission?
- To save the world.

807
01:01:11,475 --> 01:01:13,238
"You leave
for Fhloston Paradise.

808
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:17,245
Get four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."

809
01:01:17,582 --> 01:01:18,412
Any questions?

810
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:21,848
Why me? I retired
six months ago. Remember?

811
01:01:21,919 --> 01:01:23,250
Three reasons.

812
01:01:23,654 --> 01:01:24,643
One:

813
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:27,583
As a member
of the Elite Special Forces Unit...

814
01:01:27,758 --> 01:01:30,989
you are an expert in the use of
all necessary weapons and spacecraft.

815
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:34,662
Two: You're the most highly
decorated member of your unit.

816
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:35,829
The third?

817
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,935
Of all the members of your unit,
you're the only one left alive.

818
01:01:40,338 --> 01:01:41,168
Check your messages?

819
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:42,829
I've had enough good news.

820
01:01:43,174 --> 01:01:44,505
Might be important.

821
01:01:47,345 --> 01:01:48,334
You're a winner!

822
01:01:48,512 --> 01:01:51,777
You've won the Gemini Contest
and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.

823
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:56,350
Here are your tickets.

824
01:01:56,787 --> 01:01:58,516
You rigged the contest?

825
01:01:58,956 --> 01:02:00,355
Congratulations.

826
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,689
You couldn't
be more discreet?

827
01:02:04,862 --> 01:02:07,023
Old tricks are the best tricks.

828
01:02:07,198 --> 01:02:09,962
Major Iceborg will
accompany you as your wife.

829
01:02:13,137 --> 01:02:14,297
I am not going.

830
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:16,797
Why not?

831
01:02:27,985 --> 01:02:29,475
Excuse me, General.

832
01:02:31,656 --> 01:02:32,714
Who is it?

833
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:33,879
Who is it?

834
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:37,659
My wife.

835
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:38,852
You remarried?

836
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:41,454
Yes... no. I just met this girl,
but I'm going to marry her.

837
01:02:41,565 --> 01:02:43,499
I love her,
but she hates the military.

838
01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:45,602
She knows the military
ruined my last marriage.

839
01:02:45,736 --> 01:02:46,930
She can't have anything
to do with it.

840
01:02:47,004 --> 01:02:48,494
If she sees you,
she'll kill me.

841
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:50,331
- Major--
- You gotta hide somewhere.

842
01:02:50,508 --> 01:02:51,907
You've gotta help me.

843
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:54,237
We'd love to,
but where can we hide?

844
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,906
We don't
have time for this.

845
01:03:00,084 --> 01:03:01,574
It's just for one minute.

846
01:03:01,786 --> 01:03:03,845
You have no idea
how much you're helping me.

847
01:03:03,888 --> 01:03:06,083
No idea--
You have no idea.

848
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,591
- I'm going to be happily married.
- Major! Major!

849
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,957
- The three of us won't fit.
- Sure you will.

850
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,759
Major!

851
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,497
You're on my foot.

852
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,965
Major! Major!

853
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:27,907
I'm really sorry to resort to this,
Mr. Wallace--

854
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:28,967
Dallas.

855
01:03:29,046 --> 01:03:33,039
We heard about your good luck
and need your tickets for Fhloston.

856
01:03:33,284 --> 01:03:35,115
Is this the way
priests vacation?

857
01:03:35,286 --> 01:03:36,947
We're on a mission.

858
01:03:37,121 --> 01:03:38,383
What kind?

859
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,251
We have to save
the world, my son.

860
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,391
You're gonna
save the world?

861
01:03:45,062 --> 01:03:46,222
Yes!

862
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,893
Down there.
Down there.

863
01:03:59,744 --> 01:04:02,304
This is a police control.

864
01:04:02,646 --> 01:04:05,137
This is not an exercise.

865
01:04:07,518 --> 01:04:09,850
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?

866
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:11,921
Just stay here
for one minute.

867
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:15,081
- This is a police control.
- Don't touch anything.

868
01:04:15,259 --> 01:04:17,819
This is not an exercise.

869
01:04:17,928 --> 01:04:20,556
Can you please spread your legs...

870
01:04:20,631 --> 01:04:23,566
and place your hands
in the yellow circles.

871
01:04:23,634 --> 01:04:26,000
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.

872
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,401
Yeah, but I--

873
01:04:29,173 --> 01:04:31,437
I think this is the door.
No name, no number.

874
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:32,769
Let's see it.

875
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:39,176
Are you classified
as human?

876
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:42,012
Negative.
I am a meat Popsicle.

877
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:45,982
I found him.

878
01:04:46,457 --> 01:04:48,015
Mr. Korben Dallas?

879
01:04:48,859 --> 01:04:52,454
Sir, can you put your hands
in the yellow circles, please?

880
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:57,360
Smoke you!

881
01:04:58,369 --> 01:04:59,961
Wrong answer.

882
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,473
The police control
is now terminated.

883
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:09,869
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

884
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:12,880
We got the guy.
Wasn't easy but we bagged him.

885
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,382
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.

886
01:05:15,886 --> 01:05:18,719
The guy's been arrested
for uranium smuggling.

887
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:23,155
All I have to do now is go
to the airport, take his place...

888
01:05:23,327 --> 01:05:25,818
and I'll be in Fhloston
in four hours.

889
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,562
Don't come back
without the stones.

890
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:47,577
We got Korben Dallas.

891
01:05:47,751 --> 01:05:48,843
Perfect.

892
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:51,078
Akanit, take command.

893
01:05:51,689 --> 01:05:54,180
Go to Fhloston
and get the stones.

894
01:05:54,358 --> 01:05:56,189
If Zorg really wants them...

895
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,521
he'll have to negotiate.

896
01:05:58,696 --> 01:06:01,256
Revenge is at hand.

897
01:06:04,535 --> 01:06:06,867
Oh, I am so sorry.

898
01:06:07,037 --> 01:06:08,937
I forgot
about the autowash.

899
01:06:09,406 --> 01:06:11,374
There's an autowash
in that shower.

900
01:06:17,114 --> 01:06:18,945
I'm so sorry.

901
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:20,439
Autowash.

902
01:06:20,618 --> 01:06:23,451
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.

903
01:06:25,055 --> 01:06:27,615
It's funny.
I've met you twice today.

904
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:30,783
Both times
you've ended up in my arms.

905
01:06:31,395 --> 01:06:33,226
It's my lucky day.

906
01:06:34,465 --> 01:06:37,025
Lucky day.

907
01:06:46,477 --> 01:06:47,910
Did you hear something?

908
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:50,308
Cornelius.

909
01:06:56,487 --> 01:06:57,647
Autowash.

910
01:06:58,923 --> 01:07:01,414
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't need your help.

911
01:07:05,663 --> 01:07:07,927
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.

912
01:07:08,632 --> 01:07:09,963
Autowash.

913
01:07:11,101 --> 01:07:12,932
Coffee's not my specialty.

914
01:07:14,438 --> 01:07:17,430
But you must drink a lot
of coffee being a priest.

915
01:07:23,948 --> 01:07:27,179
I know. I'm not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.

916
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:40,019
I'll take the mission.

917
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,814
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.

918
01:07:58,882 --> 01:08:00,110
Good.

919
01:08:03,487 --> 01:08:05,785
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."

920
01:08:05,856 --> 01:08:07,653
"Korben David Dallas."
Perfect.

921
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,651
I can't be your husband.
I'm too old.

922
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:14,559
Now David is...

923
01:08:15,499 --> 01:08:17,364
in great shape.
he'll protect you.

924
01:08:17,434 --> 01:08:21,666
Now, please, go to the Diva, collect
the stones and meet me at the temple.

925
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,238
Now. Yes.

926
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:25,803
Okay.

927
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:32,841
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry.

928
01:08:36,253 --> 01:08:37,743
The tickets.

929
01:08:38,589 --> 01:08:40,454
- ID, please.
- I'm sorry.

930
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,818
- There.
- In here?

931
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:46,321
Mr. Dallas?

932
01:08:49,099 --> 01:08:50,589
Congratulations on the contest.

933
01:08:51,602 --> 01:08:53,502
Oh, right. Okay.

934
01:08:53,604 --> 01:08:55,299
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?

935
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:56,598
The garbage.

936
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:02,835
Made it!

937
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:05,508
I was afraid
I wouldn't make it...

938
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:08,948
so I sent David
to pick up my boarding pass.

939
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:10,108
Now David must go.

940
01:09:10,287 --> 01:09:12,118
Thank you. Bye.

941
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:15,014
I am Korben Dallas.

942
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,719
Please report infractions
immediately to the spaceport.

943
01:09:18,962 --> 01:09:20,293
And this is?

944
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,629
Leeloo Dallas.
Multi-pass.

945
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:25,627
Multi-pass.

946
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,534
She knows
it's a multi-pass.

947
01:09:27,571 --> 01:09:30,631
My wife.
We're newlyweds. Just met.

948
01:09:30,808 --> 01:09:34,471
Bump into each other, sparks happen--
She knows.

949
01:09:34,645 --> 01:09:36,135
Anyway, we're in love.

950
01:09:36,814 --> 01:09:40,477
I mean, I know
she's made to be strong.

951
01:09:40,651 --> 01:09:43,984
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?

952
01:09:48,459 --> 01:09:50,427
- You want more?
- Yeah.

953
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:54,989
Make that two.

954
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:58,998
- Where's Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.

955
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,400
What!

956
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,163
I didn't know
what to do.

957
01:10:02,506 --> 01:10:04,997
But this is not possible.

958
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,066
This is not possible.

959
01:10:07,177 --> 01:10:08,576
You want some more?

960
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:10,078
This is all my fault.

961
01:10:11,148 --> 01:10:13,582
It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.

962
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:14,740
I know.

963
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,521
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.

964
01:10:18,689 --> 01:10:21,590
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny.

965
01:10:23,694 --> 01:10:25,855
I don't want
to go to Egypt.

966
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,759
Dallas?
Korben Dallas?

967
01:10:34,037 --> 01:10:35,026
That's me.

968
01:10:35,372 --> 01:10:38,205
Just a minute, please.

969
01:10:44,047 --> 01:10:46,208
It will just take
one more minute.

970
01:10:55,225 --> 01:10:57,216
We'll be right back.

971
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,459
Mr. Dallas...

972
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,396
we really need you now.

973
01:11:04,568 --> 01:11:07,731
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live
and needs to interview you.

974
01:11:09,072 --> 01:11:10,130
Multi-pass.

975
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:17,136
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.

976
01:11:18,582 --> 01:11:20,743
Aliens ahead.
Spread out.

977
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:31,988
Backup unit, zone 18.

978
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:47,172
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It's an honor to be on his talk show.

979
01:11:47,878 --> 01:11:49,277
He's so green.

980
01:11:49,546 --> 01:11:50,638
I'm sure you're excited.

981
01:11:50,814 --> 01:11:52,805
I'm on vacation
and don't want to be bothered.

982
01:11:52,883 --> 01:11:54,942
I prefer to remain anonymous.

983
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,285
Korben Dallas!

984
01:12:00,457 --> 01:12:04,689
Here he is! The winner of
the Gemini Croquette Contest.

985
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:08,628
This boy is fuelled like fire,
so start melting, ladies...

986
01:12:08,799 --> 01:12:11,359
'cause he is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!

987
01:12:13,804 --> 01:12:17,296
The right size, the right build,
the right hair, the right on.

988
01:12:17,474 --> 01:12:18,702
Right on.

989
01:12:18,976 --> 01:12:20,967
And he's got
something to say...

990
01:12:21,144 --> 01:12:23,544
to those 50 billion pairs of ears
out there.

991
01:12:24,147 --> 01:12:25,375
Pop it, D-man.

992
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:30,375
Hi.

993
01:12:30,821 --> 01:12:32,812
Unbelievable.

994
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:37,989
Quiver, ladies.
He's going to set the world on fire.

995
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:39,492
Right here
from five to seven.

996
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:43,224
You'll know everything
there is to know about the D-man.

997
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,833
His dreams...

998
01:12:45,002 --> 01:12:46,333
his desires...

999
01:12:46,503 --> 01:12:49,233
his most intimates of intimates.

1000
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:52,239
And from what I'm looking at,
intimate is his middle name.

1001
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:54,240
So tell me, my man...

1002
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:55,844
you nervous in the service?

1003
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:00,341
Not really.

1004
01:13:01,018 --> 01:13:04,681
Freeze those knees 'cause Korben's
in the place and he's on the case.

1005
01:13:04,855 --> 01:13:08,757
Yesterday's frog
will be tomorrow's Prince...

1006
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,190
of Fhloston Paradise!

1007
01:13:11,528 --> 01:13:14,520
The hotel of a thousand and one
follies and lollies.

1008
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:17,189
A magic fountain flowing
with nonstop wine, women and...

1009
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:19,096
hootchie-kootchie-koo...

1010
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:20,859
all night long.

1011
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:24,100
All night long
All night

1012
01:13:30,213 --> 01:13:34,775
Start licking stamps, girls, because
he'll have you writing home to Mama.

1013
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,944
Here from five to seven,
I'll be your voice, your tongue.

1014
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:42,387
On the trail of the sexiest
man of the year: D-man, your man...

1015
01:13:44,861 --> 01:13:45,885
my man.

1016
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:49,890
End of transmission.

1017
01:13:50,067 --> 01:13:51,796
See you tomorrow at five.

1018
01:13:53,103 --> 01:13:54,092
How was it?

1019
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:58,965
It was just absolutely green.

1020
01:14:00,577 --> 01:14:01,566
Green like what?

1021
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,810
Crystal green.

1022
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,973
Any kind of green
you want...

1023
01:14:06,249 --> 01:14:09,047
tree green, emerald,
pond green.

1024
01:14:21,164 --> 01:14:25,032
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!

1025
01:14:25,102 --> 01:14:28,765
No fire! No energy!
I have a show to run here.

1026
01:14:28,805 --> 01:14:30,363
It must pop, pop, pop!

1027
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,930
So tomorrow, from five to seven...

1028
01:14:32,075 --> 01:14:35,374
please act like you have
more than a two-word vocabulary.

1029
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:38,440
It must be green!
Okay? Okay?

1030
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:41,784
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just talk to you?

1031
01:14:42,452 --> 01:14:45,182
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.

1032
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:48,290
Tomorrow, from five to seven,
you'll give yourself a hand.

1033
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:49,690
Green?

1034
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,122
Super green.

1035
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:54,791
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

1036
01:14:54,965 --> 01:14:56,193
That's me.

1037
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,531
I only have one Korben Dallas
on my list, and he's checked in.

1038
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,708
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.

1039
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,639
Sorry, sir.
Boarding is finished.

1040
01:15:11,314 --> 01:15:13,544
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

1041
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,648
I need to talk
to someone!

1042
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,549
I don't believe this!

1043
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,821
This is not an exercise.
This is a police control.

1044
01:15:22,993 --> 01:15:25,154
I'm sorry. I'm calm.

1045
01:15:25,829 --> 01:15:27,490
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.

1046
01:15:28,765 --> 01:15:30,130
To make your flight short...

1047
01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:32,402
flight attendants are switching
on the sleep regulator...

1048
01:15:32,769 --> 01:15:35,533
which will regulate your sleeping
during the flight.

1049
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:41,036
Thank you.

1050
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:45,446
Hi.

1051
01:15:45,615 --> 01:15:48,277
- You speak English.
- Yes. I learn.

1052
01:15:48,385 --> 01:15:49,579
Good.

1053
01:15:50,387 --> 01:15:52,218
We are not on vacation.

1054
01:15:52,389 --> 01:15:55,881
I'm on an important mission.
I work for some important people.

1055
01:15:56,059 --> 01:15:59,051
If I hadn't come to get you,
you'd be in trouble.

1056
01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:00,287
Understand?

1057
01:16:00,464 --> 01:16:01,556
Yes.

1058
01:16:01,731 --> 01:16:03,722
But you, no trouble.

1059
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:06,962
Me, Fifth Element.

1060
01:16:07,737 --> 01:16:09,637
Supreme Being.

1061
01:16:10,474 --> 01:16:12,567
Me protect you.

1062
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:17,068
Sleep.

1063
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:22,084
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Dallas.

1064
01:16:26,323 --> 01:16:28,655
Sleep regulator operative
in zone one.

1065
01:16:28,825 --> 01:16:29,814
Thank you.

1066
01:16:29,993 --> 01:16:31,153
Are you operative?

1067
01:16:31,828 --> 01:16:33,090
Zone two?

1068
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,489
Everything's ready, Captain.

1069
01:16:35,599 --> 01:16:36,588
What?

1070
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:38,825
Assume your
individual position.

1071
01:16:39,002 --> 01:16:40,833
But I want all positions!

1072
01:16:42,172 --> 01:16:43,434
Mr. Rhod--

1073
01:16:45,442 --> 01:16:46,704
Parasites in landing gear.

1074
01:16:46,776 --> 01:16:47,834
Ground, copy?

1075
01:16:48,011 --> 01:16:49,569
Got it.
Front gear.

1076
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:52,444
Hey, man,
give me some heat, man!

1077
01:16:52,616 --> 01:16:56,279
We need some heat here!
Get some heat!

1078
01:16:57,287 --> 01:16:59,619
Some heat over here, man!

1079
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:02,952
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here!

1080
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:19,134
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

1081
01:17:23,146 --> 01:17:25,376
Come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.

1082
01:17:28,652 --> 01:17:29,812
Take that.

1083
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:32,387
Mr. Rhod!

1084
01:17:33,657 --> 01:17:35,318
You can call me Ruby.

1085
01:17:36,893 --> 01:17:38,554
Fueled and ready to go.

1086
01:17:40,664 --> 01:17:42,063
I'll buy you one.

1087
01:17:44,668 --> 01:17:45,999
Taken off already?

1088
01:17:46,803 --> 01:17:48,327
I'm not on the plane.

1089
01:17:48,905 --> 01:17:49,837
What?

1090
01:17:50,006 --> 01:17:51,735
The real Dallas
took my place.

1091
01:17:51,908 --> 01:17:53,341
I don't understand.

1092
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,000
Are you making fun of me?

1093
01:17:55,178 --> 01:17:57,339
No, no, no!
I swear! I swear!

1094
01:17:57,514 --> 01:18:00,574
I never felt this way before
with a human.

1095
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,739
Really?

1096
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,754
I've tried everything.
There's no way to get on the plane.

1097
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:16,923
Ground is clear.

1098
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,692
Ready for liftoff?

1099
01:18:18,868 --> 01:18:20,096
Confirmed.

1100
01:18:25,442 --> 01:18:28,775
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.

1101
01:18:28,945 --> 01:18:30,606
- Power pressure?
- Primed.

1102
01:18:35,218 --> 01:18:36,742
- Protection?
- Confirmed.

1103
01:18:37,454 --> 01:18:38,944
Power increase.

1104
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:40,221
Ten seconds.

1105
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,880
I am...

1106
01:18:42,626 --> 01:18:43,786
a little...

1107
01:18:44,728 --> 01:18:45,888
disappointed.

1108
01:18:46,062 --> 01:18:46,721
5...

1109
01:18:46,896 --> 01:18:49,456
If there is one thing
I do not like...

1110
01:18:49,633 --> 01:18:50,292
3...

1111
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,059
it is to be...

1112
01:18:52,235 --> 01:18:52,894
2...

1113
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:55,059
disappointed.

1114
01:18:55,238 --> 01:18:55,897
1...

1115
01:18:56,072 --> 01:18:58,063
Sorry, it will
never happen again.

1116
01:18:58,475 --> 01:18:59,407
I know.

1117
01:18:59,576 --> 01:19:00,565
Liftoff.

1118
01:19:12,155 --> 01:19:15,147
- Landing gear secure.
- Checklist for light speed.

1119
01:19:41,618 --> 01:19:43,609
We're finally
getting something.

1120
01:19:44,688 --> 01:19:46,121
It's sending
radio wavelengths.

1121
01:19:46,523 --> 01:19:48,013
What does it want
with radio waves?

1122
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,289
Maybe it wants
to make a call.

1123
01:19:54,464 --> 01:19:56,125
Zorg's office.

1124
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,532
I told you I did not
want to be disturbed.

1125
01:19:59,703 --> 01:20:02,797
You don't want to be disturbed
except if it's Mr. Shadow...

1126
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:04,701
and Mr. Shadow's
on the line.

1127
01:20:14,651 --> 01:20:16,642
It's Shadow again.

1128
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:18,543
Zorg here.

1129
01:20:18,722 --> 01:20:21,054
Am I disturbing you?

1130
01:20:21,224 --> 01:20:23,488
No, no, I was just--

1131
01:20:25,829 --> 01:20:27,057
Where are you?

1132
01:20:27,731 --> 01:20:29,995
Not far now.

1133
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:32,559
Good.

1134
01:20:33,236 --> 01:20:34,669
Good, good.

1135
01:20:34,838 --> 01:20:39,275
How are the stones?

1136
01:20:39,342 --> 01:20:42,004
Fine. Fine.
Just fine.

1137
01:20:43,747 --> 01:20:47,183
I'll have the four stones
you asked for any time now...

1138
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:49,079
but it wasn't easy.

1139
01:20:49,252 --> 01:20:51,686
My costs have tripled.

1140
01:20:52,589 --> 01:20:55,683
Money is of no...

1141
01:20:56,426 --> 01:20:58,360
importance.

1142
01:20:59,195 --> 01:21:00,184
I...

1143
01:21:00,497 --> 01:21:01,657
want...

1144
01:21:01,931 --> 01:21:04,923
the stones.

1145
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:06,491
The stones...

1146
01:21:08,204 --> 01:21:09,535
will be here.

1147
01:21:12,442 --> 01:21:14,273
I'll see to it
personally.

1148
01:21:14,444 --> 01:21:17,880
I will be among you...

1149
01:21:18,615 --> 01:21:19,877
soon.

1150
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:23,708
We lost it.

1151
01:21:24,053 --> 01:21:25,452
We lost the signal.

1152
01:21:25,622 --> 01:21:26,611
Damn!

1153
01:21:44,641 --> 01:21:47,804
We've begun our descent
toward Fhloston Paradise.

1154
01:21:47,977 --> 01:21:49,968
The local time
is 3:20 p.m.

1155
01:21:50,146 --> 01:21:53,912
Auto-temperature is currently
85 degrees Fahrenheit.

1156
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:57,985
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and hope to see you again soon.

1157
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,003
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to paradise.

1158
01:22:30,787 --> 01:22:33,449
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

1159
01:23:08,057 --> 01:23:09,991
Parasites in the main ventilation.

1160
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,888
Again?
I'll get it.

1161
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:22,568
Have we arrived yet?

1162
01:23:24,073 --> 01:23:25,506
Oh, good.

1163
01:23:26,009 --> 01:23:29,001
We have twelve swimming pools
and two on the rooftop.

1164
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:32,238
All the restaurants
are between levels two and ten.

1165
01:23:32,415 --> 01:23:36,511
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches,
all accessible until 5 p.m...

1166
01:23:36,686 --> 01:23:38,415
then the airship goes higher...

1167
01:23:38,588 --> 01:23:40,180
to offer you a better view.

1168
01:23:40,423 --> 01:23:41,685
Is the Diva here?

1169
01:23:41,858 --> 01:23:43,018
Not yet.

1170
01:23:43,192 --> 01:23:44,750
Any tickets left
for the opera?

1171
01:23:45,261 --> 01:23:47,695
You have a seat reserved,
front row...

1172
01:23:47,864 --> 01:23:49,923
next to Ruby Rhod!

1173
01:23:50,099 --> 01:23:53,193
He's so talented.
I love him. He's so sexy.

1174
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:56,770
He has your ticket,
and he'll be here in 20 minutes.

1175
01:23:58,274 --> 01:24:00,265
Where can I get
something to wear?

1176
01:24:03,613 --> 01:24:06,514
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.

1177
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:17,723
You miserable bastard,
I never should've pushed you out.

1178
01:24:17,894 --> 01:24:20,795
I was in labor for days,
and this is how you repay me?

1179
01:24:20,964 --> 01:24:22,556
I should've gotten
a robot.

1180
01:24:22,665 --> 01:24:24,326
Come on, Ma.

1181
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:26,794
I should be there, not you.
I need a tan.

1182
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:28,562
I need a cocktail.

1183
01:24:51,194 --> 01:24:52,593
Get the case in.

1184
01:24:56,599 --> 01:24:58,362
Hello, Ms. Diva.
I'm Fog.

1185
01:24:58,534 --> 01:25:01,867
Welcome to the--
I'm security.

1186
01:25:02,405 --> 01:25:03,872
Welcome to the--

1187
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:05,304
Tall.

1188
01:25:23,626 --> 01:25:25,890
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Yeah.

1189
01:25:26,062 --> 01:25:27,962
- What's your name?
- Fog.

1190
01:25:30,233 --> 01:25:33,464
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad
that you are here.

1191
01:25:33,636 --> 01:25:36,628
She'll give you what you've come
to get after the concert.

1192
01:25:36,706 --> 01:25:37,730
Stay here.

1193
01:25:39,976 --> 01:25:44,242
You're listening to Radio Cosmos.
It is 5 p.m.

1194
01:25:45,481 --> 01:25:47,415
Helm to 108.

1195
01:25:48,985 --> 01:25:50,418
Helm 108!

1196
01:25:50,586 --> 01:25:51,746
Helm to 108.

1197
01:25:53,089 --> 01:25:54,420
Time to join Ruby Rhod...

1198
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:58,492
and Korben Dallas,
the lucky winner...

1199
01:25:58,661 --> 01:26:01,095
of the Gemini Croquette contest.

1200
01:26:01,264 --> 01:26:04,427
Coming at you live
from Fhloston...

1201
01:26:04,767 --> 01:26:05,995
Paradise!

1202
01:26:06,169 --> 01:26:11,004
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben
and the manager of this hotel...

1203
01:26:11,174 --> 01:26:14,007
and Miss Gemini Croquette
in person...

1204
01:26:14,177 --> 01:26:16,270
and 8,000 other lucksters here...

1205
01:26:16,446 --> 01:26:21,281
to enjoy the privilege of
the unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!

1206
01:26:24,687 --> 01:26:26,951
Now we enter what must be...

1207
01:26:27,123 --> 01:26:29,785
the most beautiful concert hall
of all the universe!

1208
01:26:29,959 --> 01:26:34,020
A perfect replica
of an old opera house...

1209
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:36,191
but who cares?

1210
01:26:37,033 --> 01:26:39,968
To my right, a row of ministers,
more sinisters than ministers.

1211
01:26:40,136 --> 01:26:43,697
To my left, Baby Ray,
star of stage and screen.

1212
01:26:43,873 --> 01:26:46,637
He's not going to get much
out of this concert. He's stone-deaf!

1213
01:26:47,543 --> 01:26:48,976
To who?

1214
01:26:49,645 --> 01:26:52,978
And here we have Roy Von Baker,
king of laser ball.

1215
01:26:53,149 --> 01:26:56,710
The Emperor of Kodar Japhet
and his lovely daughter.

1216
01:26:56,886 --> 01:27:00,049
"I love to sing,"
she recently confessed to me.

1217
01:27:00,223 --> 01:27:03,556
By the way, I have a recording
of her talented voice.

1218
01:27:05,161 --> 01:27:07,595
I'll play the rest after the concert.
Now it's time...

1219
01:27:08,197 --> 01:27:09,459
for Korben to say
the word of the day.

1220
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:15,001
Tell me, my man, you happy
here in the big world?

1221
01:27:17,006 --> 01:27:18,906
Thrilled.

1222
01:27:19,909 --> 01:27:21,774
And now...

1223
01:27:21,844 --> 01:27:22,833
champagne!

1224
01:27:28,918 --> 01:27:31,250
Commercial!
Commercial!

1225
01:27:31,587 --> 01:27:33,077
Break for 30 seconds.

1226
01:27:49,705 --> 01:27:51,036
Show time.

1227
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:46,982
I have a ship in trouble
requesting permission to dock.

1228
01:29:47,156 --> 01:29:49,989
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.

1229
01:29:50,493 --> 01:29:53,326
- Permission granted for one hour.
- More than I need.

1230
01:30:08,344 --> 01:30:10,505
Champagne for the Diva.

1231
01:30:10,846 --> 01:30:12,336
I'll take it.

1232
01:30:46,549 --> 01:30:48,540
I found it.

1233
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:24,408
Get her!

1234
01:32:58,581 --> 01:33:00,014
It was an ambush.

1235
01:33:03,686 --> 01:33:05,517
If it's war they want...

1236
01:33:05,688 --> 01:33:07,849
it's war they'll get!

1237
01:33:10,926 --> 01:33:12,757
Bravo! Bravo!

1238
01:33:12,862 --> 01:33:15,023
Bravo! Bravo!

1239
01:33:15,197 --> 01:33:16,858
My compliments, little lady.

1240
01:33:16,932 --> 01:33:18,422
Thank you for doing
the dirty work.

1241
01:33:18,501 --> 01:33:21,470
I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

1242
01:33:22,104 --> 01:33:23,366
Hand over the stones.

1243
01:34:03,746 --> 01:34:05,976
Nobody move!
I'm taking over the ship!

1244
01:34:10,553 --> 01:34:11,417
Hands up!

1245
01:35:20,322 --> 01:35:21,880
I know this music.

1246
01:35:24,226 --> 01:35:26,319
Let's change the beat.

1247
01:35:32,901 --> 01:35:34,960
I think we're
being attacked.

1248
01:35:35,137 --> 01:35:36,468
They're everywhere.

1249
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,733
I see one of them.
They're warriors, and they're ugly.

1250
01:35:39,908 --> 01:35:43,173
They got big teeth, and they got
big foreheads, and they stink.

1251
01:35:43,245 --> 01:35:44,234
Mangalores.

1252
01:35:47,149 --> 01:35:49,481
The government
sent me to help you.

1253
01:35:49,652 --> 01:35:51,279
If somebody hears this,
come and get me.

1254
01:35:51,553 --> 01:35:53,817
I'm in the first row.

1255
01:35:55,824 --> 01:35:57,485
You must give her the stones.

1256
01:35:57,593 --> 01:35:58,582
Who?

1257
01:35:58,761 --> 01:36:00,319
The Fifth Element.

1258
01:36:00,663 --> 01:36:04,929
The Supreme Being sent to Earth
to save the universe.

1259
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:06,089
Leeloo?

1260
01:36:08,504 --> 01:36:11,837
But she's more fragile
than she seems.

1261
01:36:12,341 --> 01:36:14,434
She needs your help...

1262
01:36:15,177 --> 01:36:16,439
and your love...

1263
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:18,337
or...

1264
01:36:18,614 --> 01:36:20,844
she will die.

1265
01:36:24,853 --> 01:36:26,115
Stay with me.

1266
01:36:26,288 --> 01:36:27,516
Help!

1267
01:36:34,697 --> 01:36:36,858
If you want
something done...

1268
01:36:37,299 --> 01:36:38,960
do it yourself.

1269
01:36:39,635 --> 01:36:41,694
Come on, honey.
You can't die.

1270
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,031
Wake up!
Where are the stones?

1271
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,530
Where are the stones?

1272
01:36:47,643 --> 01:36:48,871
The stones.

1273
01:37:02,658 --> 01:37:04,489
They're not here.

1274
01:37:05,227 --> 01:37:06,888
The stones,
where are they?

1275
01:37:09,064 --> 01:37:10,554
In me.

1276
01:37:10,899 --> 01:37:11,888
What?

1277
01:37:19,074 --> 01:37:20,405
Oh, my God, Korben.

1278
01:37:20,576 --> 01:37:22,237
Korben, another one coming.

1279
01:37:22,411 --> 01:37:25,107
- I think we should go.
- One minute. One minute.

1280
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:26,169
Hey, you!

1281
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:29,239
I said you.

1282
01:37:29,351 --> 01:37:31,182
- I'm not with him.
- Where's the other?

1283
01:37:34,189 --> 01:37:35,679
I said, "one minute."

1284
01:37:35,858 --> 01:37:37,416
Ruby, hold this gun.

1285
01:37:37,593 --> 01:37:39,083
What do you
want me to do?

1286
01:37:39,194 --> 01:37:40,183
Come on.

1287
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:41,787
Put your hand
on it.

1288
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:44,262
- What do I do?
- If he moves, squeeze the trigger.

1289
01:37:44,933 --> 01:37:46,867
I don't feel right.

1290
01:37:47,035 --> 01:37:50,368
- I don't feel right.
- The stones are "in me."

1291
01:37:59,948 --> 01:38:02,280
I got a headache.
This ain't me.

1292
01:38:20,803 --> 01:38:21,963
Sorry.

1293
01:38:23,305 --> 01:38:24,397
Think he'll be okay?

1294
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:34,414
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.

1295
01:38:36,919 --> 01:38:38,819
Shit. Three coming.

1296
01:38:41,256 --> 01:38:43,816
You guard this
with your life...

1297
01:38:43,992 --> 01:38:45,983
or you'll look like him.
You green?

1298
01:38:46,161 --> 01:38:47,150
Green.

1299
01:38:47,329 --> 01:38:48,591
Super green?

1300
01:38:48,764 --> 01:38:51,164
Is that your idea
of a discreet operation?

1301
01:38:51,333 --> 01:38:55,167
Don't worry. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.

1302
01:39:22,464 --> 01:39:24,022
Move! Move!

1303
01:39:25,133 --> 01:39:27,260
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1304
01:39:27,369 --> 01:39:28,461
Ladies and gentlemen...

1305
01:39:28,537 --> 01:39:30,129
this is amazing.

1306
01:39:32,207 --> 01:39:33,799
Let me do it.

1307
01:39:41,049 --> 01:39:42,141
Oh, my God.

1308
01:39:42,317 --> 01:39:44,342
Korben Dallas, my man,
is in trouble.

1309
01:39:51,226 --> 01:39:52,215
The gun!

1310
01:39:54,062 --> 01:39:55,996
Give me the gun.

1311
01:39:56,164 --> 01:39:57,324
I'm going to go...

1312
01:39:57,499 --> 01:40:01,731
and try to see if I can see
something a little closer.

1313
01:40:18,353 --> 01:40:20,082
Yes, the gun. Yeah.

1314
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:30,387
Thanks, Ray.

1315
01:40:31,366 --> 01:40:35,029
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed!

1316
01:40:35,203 --> 01:40:36,192
Get up!

1317
01:40:36,371 --> 01:40:38,771
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!

1318
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:40,272
I'm not armed.

1319
01:40:43,946 --> 01:40:44,935
Oh, my God.

1320
01:40:45,113 --> 01:40:46,740
I'm on vacation.

1321
01:40:47,082 --> 01:40:49,209
Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation.

1322
01:40:49,284 --> 01:40:50,376
I won a...

1323
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,280
contest.

1324
01:40:53,455 --> 01:40:55,446
Gemini Croquette's to...

1325
01:40:55,624 --> 01:40:57,057
Fhloston Paradise.

1326
01:40:59,261 --> 01:41:00,250
Down.

1327
01:41:02,731 --> 01:41:03,959
Wait a minute.

1328
01:41:04,066 --> 01:41:05,363
Get down!

1329
01:41:06,969 --> 01:41:08,596
He's trying
to say something.

1330
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:09,602
Down!

1331
01:41:24,086 --> 01:41:25,314
Sorry, my man.

1332
01:41:34,863 --> 01:41:35,989
Where are you?

1333
01:41:37,332 --> 01:41:39,664
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1334
01:41:40,168 --> 01:41:42,329
They're coming.
They're coming.

1335
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:47,433
Don't move.

1336
01:41:58,620 --> 01:41:59,780
What you doing?

1337
01:41:59,955 --> 01:42:01,513
Count to ten.

1338
01:42:09,865 --> 01:42:12,299
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!

1339
01:42:12,534 --> 01:42:14,798
3! 4! 5!

1340
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:16,028
6...

1341
01:42:16,204 --> 01:42:17,193
7, 8...

1342
01:42:18,306 --> 01:42:19,705
9...

1343
01:42:43,899 --> 01:42:45,161
10.

1344
01:42:51,173 --> 01:42:52,572
I am...

1345
01:42:52,741 --> 01:42:55,073
very disappointed.

1346
01:42:55,677 --> 01:42:57,907
Korben, what are you
looking for?

1347
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,240
Control room.

1348
01:43:01,016 --> 01:43:02,745
- This is it.
- I'll be here.

1349
01:43:02,818 --> 01:43:04,217
Let's go.

1350
01:43:07,756 --> 01:43:09,246
Quiet! Quiet!

1351
01:43:10,759 --> 01:43:12,090
You in charge?

1352
01:43:13,261 --> 01:43:14,751
How many
are out there?

1353
01:43:15,864 --> 01:43:17,525
- I don't know.
- Let's count.

1354
01:43:21,036 --> 01:43:23,095
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.

1355
01:43:29,544 --> 01:43:31,535
Four on the right.
Two on the left.

1356
01:43:32,814 --> 01:43:35,578
Find the leader.
They won't fight without the leader.

1357
01:43:36,118 --> 01:43:38,552
One more shot and we start
killing hostages.

1358
01:43:39,621 --> 01:43:40,781
That's the leader.

1359
01:43:40,956 --> 01:43:42,787
Send someone to negotiate.

1360
01:43:44,893 --> 01:43:47,293
I've never negotiated.

1361
01:43:47,562 --> 01:43:49,462
You mind if I try?

1362
01:43:51,566 --> 01:43:54,057
We're sending
somebody to negotiate.

1363
01:44:02,978 --> 01:44:05,071
Anybody else
want to negotiate?

1364
01:44:05,247 --> 01:44:07,909
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?

1365
01:44:08,416 --> 01:44:09,747
I wonder.

1366
01:44:14,289 --> 01:44:15,620
Where's Ruby?

1367
01:44:16,591 --> 01:44:18,081
I thought he was dead.

1368
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:19,249
Master!

1369
01:44:19,928 --> 01:44:22,488
It was nothing, really.
Just a helping hand.

1370
01:44:23,098 --> 01:44:25,498
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod...

1371
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:27,100
still alive.

1372
01:44:27,836 --> 01:44:29,167
What's wrong with you?

1373
01:44:29,237 --> 01:44:30,499
It hurt!

1374
01:44:36,444 --> 01:44:40,278
I realize that you must be
pretty mad at me...

1375
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:42,848
but I'm fighting
for a noble cause.

1376
01:44:43,018 --> 01:44:45,851
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.

1377
01:44:46,454 --> 01:44:48,354
Right now,
I'm trying to save Leeloo.

1378
01:44:48,523 --> 01:44:49,615
Leeloo's in trouble?

1379
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:51,850
When is Leeloo
not in trouble?

1380
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:53,850
- Where's that?
- The Diva's suite.

1381
01:44:59,367 --> 01:45:00,356
Hang on.

1382
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:04,997
Here, come on.

1383
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,031
How do you get yourself
into these positions?

1384
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:09,472
Come on.

1385
01:45:12,714 --> 01:45:15,706
I'm here. It's all right.
Everything's okay now.

1386
01:45:16,151 --> 01:45:17,209
Listen.

1387
01:45:19,821 --> 01:45:22,813
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?

1388
01:45:25,493 --> 01:45:29,395
My man, my man, what's this thing
with all these numbers?

1389
01:45:39,407 --> 01:45:41,068
If it was a bomb...

1390
01:45:41,243 --> 01:45:45,509
the alarms would go off because
all these hotels have bomb detectors.

1391
01:45:47,415 --> 01:45:50,179
This is a type "A" alert.

1392
01:45:50,752 --> 01:45:53,346
For security reasons,
the hotel must be evacuated.

1393
01:45:54,589 --> 01:45:56,250
Proceed calmly
to the lifeboats...

1394
01:45:56,424 --> 01:45:57,914
Stay calm!

1395
01:45:57,993 --> 01:45:59,585
...located in the main hallways.

1396
01:45:59,694 --> 01:46:00,922
Stay calm!

1397
01:46:06,601 --> 01:46:09,263
You know how to stop this,
right?

1398
01:46:14,943 --> 01:46:18,276
Two minutes
to complete evacuation.

1399
01:46:20,282 --> 01:46:21,271
Get back!

1400
01:46:21,449 --> 01:46:23,110
Evacuation!
Evacuation!

1401
01:46:23,285 --> 01:46:26,618
Sorry, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.

1402
01:46:31,559 --> 01:46:32,719
I know.

1403
01:46:47,709 --> 01:46:49,142
I don't want to die.

1404
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:50,472
Please, my son.

1405
01:46:51,112 --> 01:46:52,443
Get in.

1406
01:46:57,285 --> 01:47:00,015
One minute to total evacuation.

1407
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:05,782
This one.

1408
01:47:09,197 --> 01:47:11,028
45 seconds.

1409
01:47:14,302 --> 01:47:15,860
Get her strapped in.

1410
01:47:21,476 --> 01:47:23,637
You know how to fly this?

1411
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:25,040
Like driving a cab.

1412
01:47:29,718 --> 01:47:31,652
How will we
get out the door?

1413
01:47:45,166 --> 01:47:46,997
15 seconds.

1414
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:52,900
10...

1415
01:47:53,074 --> 01:47:54,564
9, 8...

1416
01:47:55,744 --> 01:47:56,904
7...

1417
01:47:57,245 --> 01:47:58,678
6...

1418
01:47:58,847 --> 01:47:59,905
5.

1419
01:48:16,698 --> 01:48:18,598
For the honor.

1420
01:48:24,606 --> 01:48:25,595
Hold on.

1421
01:48:47,962 --> 01:48:49,224
Like driving a cab.

1422
01:48:51,232 --> 01:48:53,894
It is now 7 p.m.,
time for the news.

1423
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:55,969
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.

1424
01:48:56,404 --> 01:48:58,065
End of transmission.

1425
01:48:58,973 --> 01:49:00,964
That's the best show
I ever did.

1426
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:06,642
Major Dallas has
the five elements on board...

1427
01:49:06,815 --> 01:49:09,579
and the priest is guiding them
to the temple.

1428
01:49:14,155 --> 01:49:15,486
We're saved.

1429
01:49:31,673 --> 01:49:34,335
The Diva said
I should take care of you.

1430
01:49:35,443 --> 01:49:38,003
Humans act so strange.

1431
01:49:38,179 --> 01:49:39,339
What do you mean?

1432
01:49:41,015 --> 01:49:43,108
Everything you created...

1433
01:49:43,184 --> 01:49:44,879
is used to destroy.

1434
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:48,612
We call it human nature.

1435
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:50,781
You learn that
on your screen?

1436
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,792
I'm not finished yet.
I'm up to "V."

1437
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:55,960
"V" is good.

1438
01:49:56,364 --> 01:49:58,298
Some good words in "V."

1439
01:49:58,366 --> 01:49:59,697
Like what?

1440
01:50:02,036 --> 01:50:03,367
"Valiant."

1441
01:50:03,872 --> 01:50:05,203
"Vulnerable."

1442
01:50:07,642 --> 01:50:09,303
"Very beautiful."

1443
01:50:21,055 --> 01:50:23,546
Oh, of course, Munro!

1444
01:50:24,893 --> 01:50:25,985
Mr. President?

1445
01:50:26,227 --> 01:50:27,387
Now what?

1446
01:50:30,732 --> 01:50:32,165
We have a problem.

1447
01:50:37,672 --> 01:50:39,003
It's advancing?

1448
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:42,735
It's not only advancing,
it's moving at incredible speed.

1449
01:50:47,248 --> 01:50:50,581
And do you have any idea
where it's heading?

1450
01:50:57,425 --> 01:51:00,360
Korben, there's
a general on the phone.

1451
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:02,754
I'll give you
the President.

1452
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:06,933
Major Dallas, I first
would like to salute a warrior.

1453
01:51:07,368 --> 01:51:09,529
You're a shining example
of this army.

1454
01:51:09,704 --> 01:51:11,467
In the name
of the Federation--

1455
01:51:11,539 --> 01:51:13,598
Any idea when you'll
get to the point?

1456
01:51:17,278 --> 01:51:20,770
A ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
heading straight for earth...

1457
01:51:20,949 --> 01:51:24,282
and we have no idea how to stop it.
That's the problem.

1458
01:51:27,622 --> 01:51:29,112
How much time do we have?

1459
01:51:30,124 --> 01:51:33,616
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.

1460
01:51:34,729 --> 01:51:36,720
I'll call you back
in two hours.

1461
01:51:36,898 --> 01:51:38,058
Hello?

1462
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:51,438
They just landed
in the desert.

1463
01:52:53,741 --> 01:52:55,402
Good job, David.

1464
01:52:57,078 --> 01:52:59,308
- Put her in the center.
- Where? Here?

1465
01:53:07,055 --> 01:53:08,886
You got it figured out, Father?

1466
01:53:08,956 --> 01:53:11,584
This one should be fire.

1467
01:53:11,826 --> 01:53:13,987
- You know how this works?
- Theoretically.

1468
01:53:14,162 --> 01:53:17,325
The four stones
should go around.

1469
01:53:17,432 --> 01:53:19,593
The Fifth Element should be
in the middle...

1470
01:53:19,667 --> 01:53:22,500
and then the weapon
against evil should work.

1471
01:53:23,171 --> 01:53:25,264
You've never seen this work?

1472
01:53:25,506 --> 01:53:26,495
Give me that.

1473
01:53:26,674 --> 01:53:30,110
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.

1474
01:53:38,453 --> 01:53:39,613
That's it.
That's it.

1475
01:53:39,854 --> 01:53:41,219
Match up the symbols.
Go! Go!

1476
01:53:42,857 --> 01:53:43,949
Wind.

1477
01:53:45,793 --> 01:53:47,852
My man, what you doing?

1478
01:53:47,929 --> 01:53:49,954
- What?
- What you doing?

1479
01:53:51,132 --> 01:53:52,963
Trying to keep you
in the D.J. business.

1480
01:53:56,704 --> 01:53:57,693
Fire.

1481
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:00,306
Done.

1482
01:54:00,475 --> 01:54:01,533
What happens?

1483
01:54:01,709 --> 01:54:04,303
So, now,
we have to open them.

1484
01:54:05,413 --> 01:54:07,404
And you know how to do that.
Right?

1485
01:54:07,482 --> 01:54:08,813
Theoretically...

1486
01:54:10,551 --> 01:54:11,643
No.

1487
01:54:16,491 --> 01:54:18,152
Leeloo, honey, wake up.

1488
01:54:18,326 --> 01:54:19,554
You have to help us.

1489
01:54:20,328 --> 01:54:22,228
How do you open the stones?

1490
01:54:23,498 --> 01:54:25,398
Wind blows.

1491
01:54:26,901 --> 01:54:28,493
Fire burns.

1492
01:54:28,669 --> 01:54:32,002
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?

1493
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:33,568
Rain...

1494
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:38,410
falls.

1495
01:54:44,952 --> 01:54:46,283
What does it mean?

1496
01:54:48,089 --> 01:54:49,420
I think that--

1497
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:50,750
Maybe it's a charade.

1498
01:54:51,025 --> 01:54:52,424
A game or something.

1499
01:54:52,827 --> 01:54:55,352
If we don't get these stones open
in five minutes, we're dead.

1500
01:54:55,396 --> 01:54:57,091
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.

1501
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:11,041
Too late.

1502
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,441
We've lost contact with them.

1503
01:55:14,615 --> 01:55:15,946
Three minutes.

1504
01:55:17,452 --> 01:55:18,783
I think mine is broken.

1505
01:55:18,853 --> 01:55:20,445
Why I gotta get
the broke one?

1506
01:55:28,963 --> 01:55:30,624
We're never gonna make it.

1507
01:55:36,804 --> 01:55:38,135
It moved.

1508
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:41,798
- Show me what you did.
- Nothing.

1509
01:55:41,976 --> 01:55:43,466
Shut up, shut up!

1510
01:55:43,644 --> 01:55:46,670
Show me what you did,
step-by-step.

1511
01:55:46,747 --> 01:55:49,079
- I was standing here.
- Quickly.

1512
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:53,484
I put my hands on the top
like this, and I said...

1513
01:55:54,422 --> 01:55:55,912
"We're not going to make it."

1514
01:55:57,992 --> 01:55:59,254
And that's it?

1515
01:56:08,002 --> 01:56:09,333
Korben, my man.

1516
01:56:10,004 --> 01:56:10,993
Wind.

1517
01:56:11,939 --> 01:56:14,169
She said, "Wind blows."

1518
01:56:22,116 --> 01:56:23,606
Everyone take a stone.

1519
01:56:23,951 --> 01:56:26,852
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for Earth. Go!

1520
01:56:29,290 --> 01:56:30,450
Earth.

1521
01:56:30,691 --> 01:56:32,181
Open the other one.

1522
01:56:48,042 --> 01:56:50,476
Korben, my man,
I have no fire.

1523
01:56:50,645 --> 01:56:52,806
I have no matches.
Do you have any?

1524
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:55,380
I stopped smoking.
Father, you smoke?

1525
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:58,212
Got some matches?
We need some fire.

1526
01:57:00,154 --> 01:57:01,212
We're going to die.

1527
01:57:08,496 --> 01:57:09,895
Don't breathe.

1528
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:30,239
Fire.

1529
01:57:31,018 --> 01:57:32,076
One minute.

1530
01:57:32,153 --> 01:57:33,848
Let's go, Leeloo.

1531
01:57:33,921 --> 01:57:37,015
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.

1532
01:57:37,758 --> 01:57:39,248
Protect life...

1533
01:57:40,528 --> 01:57:41,756
until death.

1534
01:57:41,929 --> 01:57:43,089
Listen to me!

1535
01:57:43,264 --> 01:57:44,754
Listen to me.

1536
01:57:44,932 --> 01:57:47,594
Listen,
I know you're very tired.

1537
01:57:47,768 --> 01:57:51,499
I'll take you on vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.

1538
01:57:51,772 --> 01:57:53,364
But if you don't
do something right now...

1539
01:57:53,541 --> 01:57:55,099
we'll all die.

1540
01:57:55,276 --> 01:57:58,939
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?

1541
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,942
It'll enter the atmosphere
in 40 seconds.

1542
01:58:03,384 --> 01:58:04,942
You're right.
You're right.

1543
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:07,280
There are some things...

1544
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:09,787
very nice things worth saving;
beautiful things.

1545
01:58:10,224 --> 01:58:12,055
Beautiful things.

1546
01:58:13,127 --> 01:58:14,617
Like love?

1547
01:58:14,729 --> 01:58:16,822
Yes, love.
That's good. That's good.

1548
01:58:16,864 --> 01:58:19,298
That's a good example.
Love is worth saving.

1549
01:58:20,234 --> 01:58:21,997
I don't know love.

1550
01:58:24,071 --> 01:58:25,333
I don't know love.

1551
01:58:25,506 --> 01:58:27,838
I was built to protect,
not love.

1552
01:58:28,075 --> 01:58:30,839
So there's no use for me
other than this.

1553
01:58:31,012 --> 01:58:33,003
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

1554
01:58:34,148 --> 01:58:35,342
I need you.

1555
01:58:35,516 --> 01:58:37,177
I need you,
very much.

1556
01:58:38,919 --> 01:58:40,079
Why?

1557
01:58:42,023 --> 01:58:43,354
Because...

1558
01:58:43,691 --> 01:58:45,090
because...

1559
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:48,021
Tell her, Korben.

1560
01:58:49,864 --> 01:58:51,354
Tell me.

1561
01:58:51,532 --> 01:58:52,521
Please.

1562
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:54,591
Why you need me?

1563
01:58:55,102 --> 01:58:56,535
Because...

1564
01:58:56,871 --> 01:58:58,202
Tell me.

1565
01:59:00,341 --> 01:59:01,808
- Tell me.
- Because I--

1566
01:59:02,043 --> 01:59:03,533
Because I love you.

1567
01:59:04,779 --> 01:59:06,110
I love you.

1568
01:59:09,984 --> 01:59:10,973
10...

1569
01:59:11,052 --> 01:59:12,041
9...

1570
01:59:12,219 --> 01:59:13,208
8...

1571
01:59:13,287 --> 01:59:14,276
7...

1572
01:59:14,655 --> 01:59:16,054
6, 5...

1573
01:59:16,490 --> 01:59:18,219
4, 3...

1574
01:59:18,626 --> 01:59:19,615
2...

1575
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:20,949
1.

1576
01:59:58,999 --> 02:00:03,163
Scanner imaging has confirmed
the dark planet dead.

1577
02:00:03,838 --> 02:00:06,602
The planet seems to have stopped
at 62 miles from impact.

1578
02:00:19,453 --> 02:00:21,683
What's wrong?
What you screaming for?

1579
02:00:21,856 --> 02:00:24,347
Every five minutes
it's a bomb or something.

1580
02:00:24,525 --> 02:00:25,856
I'm leaving.

1581
02:00:40,441 --> 02:00:41,772
Mr. President.

1582
02:00:41,842 --> 02:00:44,606
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh
who runs the center.

1583
02:00:44,779 --> 02:00:46,610
It's an honor, Mr. President.

1584
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:48,477
Where are my two heroes?

1585
02:00:48,549 --> 02:00:52,383
They were so tired from their ordeal,
we put them in the reactor.

1586
02:00:52,553 --> 02:00:54,453
I have 19 meetings after this.

1587
02:00:54,622 --> 02:00:57,056
Let me see
if they're revived.

1588
02:00:57,224 --> 02:00:58,282
Thank you.

1589
02:00:58,559 --> 02:01:00,891
We go live in one minute.

1590
02:01:08,969 --> 02:01:10,061
They're...

1591
02:01:11,739 --> 02:01:12,967
not ready.

1592
02:01:13,974 --> 02:01:15,066
They need...

1593
02:01:15,242 --> 02:01:16,470
five more minutes.

1594
02:01:16,644 --> 02:01:17,975
You have 20 seconds.

1595
02:01:18,145 --> 02:01:20,306
No, ma'am, I tried.
No, ma'am.

1596
02:01:20,481 --> 02:01:21,470
Who's that?

1597
02:01:21,649 --> 02:01:23,310
Some woman.
Claims to be Korben's mother.

1598
02:01:23,484 --> 02:01:24,644
Give it here.

1599
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:28,482
Mrs. Dallas,
this is the President.

1600
02:01:28,656 --> 02:01:30,487
On behalf
of the Federation--

1601
02:01:30,658 --> 02:01:32,489
That doesn't
even sound like him.

1602
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:35,094
The President's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.

1603
02:01:35,129 --> 02:01:36,790
If you don't want to talk
to your mother...

1604
02:01:36,864 --> 02:01:38,456
just avoid me as usual.

1605
02:01:38,532 --> 02:01:42,263
I'll throw myself in traffic.
I'll Saran Wrap myself to the bed.
