I need to finish packing and stuff, so...

349
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:22,340
Well, you need to sign this.

350
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:25,010
Yeah, we're actually the two last
people in the building, I guess, so...

351
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:26,777
Should I be worried?

352
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:29,779
Why?

353
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,817
No reason.

354
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,852
- [clears throat]
- Okay.

355
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,454
Mission accomplished, cowboy.

356
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:41,855
Hm? Oh.

357
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:43,690
- Right, the, uh...
- All of it.

358
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,358
- The cowboy hat, right.
- Yeah.

359
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,593
Uh, I'm actually
on the way to my cabin.

360
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,829
Uh, it's, like,
in the woods.

361
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:52,564
We have dirt bikes and horses and
a bunch of cool stuff like that.

362
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:53,999
Oh, you have horses?

363
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:56,366
Yeah. Yeah, two of them.

364
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,769
I've never been
horseback riding.

365
00:19:58,802 --> 00:20:01,571
What?
Come on, never?

366
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,040
No, never.

367
00:20:03,073 --> 00:20:04,941
Well, I mean...

368
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:08,910
I don't know if you'd...
you'd want to, but I...

369
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:11,846
I could, uh...
I could take you?

370
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,581
Mayb... cool.

371
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,348
- Sure. Yeah, maybe. Maybe.
- Maybe. Um..

372
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,817
Yeah, here's this.
I have to finish...

373
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,352
- I need to finish packing, so...
- [clears throat] Right.

374
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,286
I'm just gonna go back
and do it.

375
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,622
Uh, Erin, actually, I have
to make sure you leave safely

376
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,289
before I can go.

377
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:27,925
Okay, um...

378
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,028
I just... I'm sure you have
something better to do

379
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,663
than just sit here
and wait for me.

380
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,333
No. I don't.

381
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:42,670
Okay, well, um...

382
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:45,305
maybe could you help me pack?

383
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:50,343
[clears throat]
Yeah.

384
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:53,312
Sure. Yeah. Let's do it.

385
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:54,813
- Great.
- Yee-haw.

386
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:56,648
[chuckles]
Giddyup, partner.

387
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,604
Nice getup.

388
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:28,873
Janitorial technician.

389
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:32,442
Make sure our asset's
on her way out.

390
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:33,544
Yes, sir.

391
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,760
[guard]
Campus is closed.

392
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,628
I'm here to pick up my son.

393
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:58,097
- Where?
- MacArthur Hall.

394
00:21:58,131 --> 00:22:01,566
Hm. Why don't you call your son,
have him meet you over there?

395
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,534
Um...

396
00:22:03,568 --> 00:22:05,602
- My phone is...
- Ah.

397
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:07,939
Eh, I'll tell you what,
make it quick, will you?

398
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:09,773
Yes, sir.

399
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:11,473
And you and your son, you have
a merry Christmas, sir.

400
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,076
You do the same.

401
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:22,783
One coming your way.

402
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,852
Is he a problem?

403
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:29,522
Nah, he's just here to pick up
his son. Should be quick.

404
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:31,857
Okay, everyone stay loose
till this guy's gone.

405
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,628
You were aware this dorm
has a perfectly good elevator?

406
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:39,529
I don't do elevators.

407
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:41,098
Childhood trauma?

408
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:42,933
Claustrophobic.

409
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:45,101
Oh, so repressed memory, then.

410
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:48,403
[scoffs] What are you,
a psych major?

411
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:51,106
No. Theater.

412
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,446
- You got it?
- Yeah.

413
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,748
We have the asset.

414
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,717
Wow. Nice car.

415
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,852
- Secret Service.
- Okay, okay. Pretty cool.

416
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:11,855
Here, let me get that for you.

417
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:13,957
I got this.

418
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:15,658
Here you go, sir.

419
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:20,629
[clears throat]

420
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:22,563
- Sorry.
- [chuckles]

421
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:26,467
Um, well, thanks for
everything, and merry Christmas.

422
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,036
- Yeah. Yeah, merry Christmas...
- [Vic] Shawny!

423
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:30,803
- [Shawn] Hey!
- How you doing, bud?

424
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:34,908
Um, you should call me.

425
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:37,808
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I will.

426
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:40,946
- [Vic] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
- How you been?

427
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:44,949
What's up? [grunts] [laughs]
Hey, you're good.

428
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:47,750
You know, I'll take a few hours
late over not at all any day.

429
00:23:47,783 --> 00:23:49,485
Hmm. That hurt.

430
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:50,619
Sorry.

431
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,455
Is that your girl?

432
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,857
Uh, no, it's Erin Walton.

433
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,226
Walton.

434
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:00,094
Yeah, Justice Walton's
daughter?

435
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:02,495
Like Supreme Court
Justice Walton?

436
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,231
Yeah, Dad.

437
00:24:04,264 --> 00:24:06,232
[Erin] Where's Steve?

438
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:07,866
- Sick.
- Oh.

439
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:12,103
Shit. Hold on.
I'll be right back.

440
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:15,072
- Hey, where you going?
- I'll be right back!

441
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,974
- Wait, where you going?
- Oh, I-I forgot my laptop.

442
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:20,009
The new guy's an ass, so...
I'll be quick, I promise.

443
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,743
All right.

444
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:25,180
Okay, so what's up?

445
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,950
I, uh, I promised Charlie that
I'd make sure everyone was out,

446
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:29,482
so I gotta... I gotta stay.

447
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:32,719
Okay.

448
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:54,904
The asset is on the move.
Heading to her room.

449
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,181
Ready to do some ridin'?

450
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:11,583
Uh, it's a little chilly,
nah?

451
00:25:11,616 --> 00:25:13,551
Fishing'll be good.

452
00:25:13,584 --> 00:25:14,852
Eh.

453
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:17,955
Well, I know you want to shoot.

454
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:19,823
- You love to shoot.
- I mean, I would, I just...

455
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:22,524
got tryouts for the play
in a couple weeks, so...

456
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,062
gotta start going over
the lines, get the part.

457
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:29,831
What's the play?

458
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:31,166
<i>Lost in Yonkers.</i>

459
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,599
Ah, yeah, right, that's...

460
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,836
It's Neil Simon.

461
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,572
Neil Simon, uh,
is the guy who...

462
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,074
Write. Writes.
[chuckles]

463
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,910
How's your bike holding up?

464
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,277
Oh, good. Yeah, she's good.

465
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,079
Needs a carb tune-up,
but, uh...

466
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,148
Oh! Thanks for reminding me.
Gotta cover her up.

467
00:25:56,818 --> 00:25:59,322
So you're sure you're still
all in on this theater thing.

468
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:02,257
[chuckles]
Uh, yeah, Dad.

469
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,692
If you'd actually been around
last couple years,

470
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:06,160
you'd know I was good at it.

471
00:26:08,162 --> 00:26:10,196
I don't get to decide
when I come and go, Shawn.

472
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,730
That's part of the deal.

473
00:26:11,764 --> 00:26:13,900
Yeah, Dad.
I know the deal.

474
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:15,901
Don't get to choose.
Don't need it.

475
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,037
All right? I'm fine.
Seriously.

476
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:21,805
[sighs]

477
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:49,161
Your friend say
her driver's new?

478
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:52,064
[grunts]
Yeah. So?

479
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:55,665
Who's left inside?

480
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,902
It's just the two of us.
We're the last ones in.

481
00:26:59,069 --> 00:27:01,037
Here. Take the keys,
get in the Jeep,

482
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:03,038
lock the doors,
and do not move.

483
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:05,606
Is something wrong?

484
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,943
I don't know. Just chill.
I'll be right back.

485
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:14,181
Chill.
"Just chill." Chill.

486
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:16,249
Who taught him that word?

487
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:23,620
Papa Bear's headed inside.
Keep your eyes on him.

488
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:30,360
[phone ringing]

489
00:27:33,062 --> 00:27:35,865
Yo, Charlie.
What up?

490
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:37,165
[chuckles]

491
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,799
Yeah, I told you.

492
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,368
Can't just come on that strong.

493
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:42,903
Gotta let her cool off
a little bit. [chuckles]

494
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:49,641
[knock at door]

495
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:50,876
God, you scared me.

496
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:55,013
Sorry. Did you say
your driver was new?

497
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:56,981
Yeah. Why?

498
00:27:58,382 --> 00:28:00,716
Maybe we should call your dad
and make sure.

499
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:02,785
Got your phone?

500
00:28:02,818 --> 00:28:04,221
Yeah.

501
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:12,127
[sighs] Shawn said you're
a Green Beret? Delta Force?

502
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,129
Yeah, I am.
Make the call.

503
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,432
- [sighs]
- [ringing]

504
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:20,366
- [Walton] <i>Hello?</i>
- Daddy?

505
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,070
Erin. I thought you'd be here
by now. Where are you?

506
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,104
[Erin] <i>Well,
I had a lot to pack.</i>

507
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,039
She's called her father.

508
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,207
[Driver, over headset]
<i>Kill the call now.</i>

509
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,942
[Walton] <i>We have dinner
reservations at 9:00.</i>

510
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,444
<i>When will you be home?</i>

511
00:28:33,477 --> 00:28:35,711
Before then, I guess.

512
00:28:35,744 --> 00:28:38,148
Hey. Can you ask
about the driver?

513
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:44,051
Sure. Um, Dad, uh,
did you send a new driver?

514
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:46,154
[Walton] <i>A new what?</i>

515
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:47,754
Driver.

516
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:48,855
<i>No.</i>

517
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:50,756
[dial tone]

518
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:52,125
[sighs] The call dropped.

519
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,960
I know. I know.
That whole class was B.S.

520
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:56,462
[dial tone]

521
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:59,663

00:39:23,357 --> 00:39:24,659
and some don't.

702
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:28,328
And what is it
they have to do?

703
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:33,699
They have to hurt a child.

704
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:43,908
I have your daughter, Ken.

705
00:39:43,941 --> 00:39:45,408
I have Erin.

706
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:48,779
If you don't do
what I tell you to do...

707
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:53,248
something terrible
will happen to her,

708
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:55,449
and it will be your fault.

709
00:40:01,722 --> 00:40:03,489
It's your shot.

710
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,225
Go, go, go.

711
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:08,393
Get down, get down.

712
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,296
All right. I've got
to find a landline.

713
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,297
There's people I can call
in a situation like this.

714
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,933
There's a payphone
in the gym.

715
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:17,968
You sure? I've never seen
a payphone in there before.

716
00:40:18,002 --> 00:40:20,402
Yes! Freshman year,
we had a petition to get...

717
00:40:20,436 --> 00:40:22,671
Guys, guys!
That's where I'm headed.

718
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:24,006
Give me your cell phones.

719
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,674
- Why?
- 'Cause they're tracking them.

720
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:29,342
How do you know?

721
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:30,577
Sorry.

722
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:35,481
- All right...
- Dad!

723
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:36,850
- We're going with you.
- No, no.

724
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:38,018
These people
are highly trained.

725
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,384
Yeah, well, so am I.

726
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:40,986
Well, then take this.

727
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,420
Here.

728
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:44,756
You guys stay out of sight,

729
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:47,758
listen for sound,
but do not engage.

730
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,893
They need Erin alive, but you and
I, they'll shoot on sight.

731
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:52,029
- Okay, we won't go anywhere.
- Yeah, we'll stay hidden.

732
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:53,495
- Okay.
- Dad.

733
00:40:53,528 --> 00:40:55,263
You're gonna need this.

734
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,265
It's a payphone.

735
00:40:58,299 --> 00:40:59,835
Yeah.

736
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:02,469
Here. I'll be
back for mine.

737
00:41:07,907 --> 00:41:09,709

they're on the elevator

739
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:16,380

[sharp groan]

745
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,541
Smarter than you.

746
00:41:54,377 --> 00:41:56,780
Let's take a ride.

747
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:04,451
On your knees!

748
00:42:04,484 --> 00:42:05,686
[pained grunt]

749
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:13,492
Put the cuffs on,
put your hands over your head.

750
00:42:13,526 --> 00:42:15,493
Now!

751
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:26,335

752
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,105
Paula,
how we lookin' up top?

753
00:42:28,138 --> 00:42:30,505
Dead still, baby.

754
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:32,809
They're zipped up tight.

755
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:38,411
<i>Babcock,
what's your 20?</i>

756
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:39,814
I'm playing hide-and-seek.

<i>He's seen action

00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:19,946
<i>Bosnia, Somalia, Kosovo.</i>

769
00:43:19,979 --> 00:43:22,047
If there was a major conflict
in the last 15 years,

770
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,748
this guy was there.

771
00:43:23,782 --> 00:43:26,583
<i>He's the current
Delta One team leader.</i>

hesitate to kill you.</i>

774
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:34,423
Did you know all that?

775
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,525
Nope.

776
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:43,097
[Russian accent]
I don't care who you are.

777
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:46,700
You're dead.

They seem really

00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:06,849
Yeah.

781
00:44:06,883 --> 00:44:08,084
Yeah, they should be.

782
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:18,058
Oh, my gosh. Shawn,
you're bleeding a lot.

783
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:20,660
- It's not that bad.
- No, no, we need to get this wrapped up.

- I-I'll be okay.
- No, it's bad.

We'll wrap you up.

Hey, this is Vic.

[pained sigh]
But... go ahead.

811
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:36,533
We used to go
to the cabin all the time.

812
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:38,268
You know, it was
kind of like our thing.

813

Mixed martial arts,
hand-to-hand,

That's cool.

817
00:46:50,212 --> 00:46:51,913
And I really loved it, too.

818
00:46:51,947 --> 00:46:54,615
Not what we were doing,
just...

819
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:56,650
just that we did it together.

820
00:46:56,684 --> 00:47:00,120
So, uh, are your parents
together, then,

821
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:02,988
or... where's your mom at?

00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,064
Some asshole from Iraq...

825
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,669
he wanted revenge
for something my dad did.

826
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:21,903
And, um...

827
00:47:25,006 --> 00:47:26,874
they found our house.

828
00:47:27,941 --> 00:47:29,743
But I was at school.

829
00:47:29,777 --> 00:47:31,177
And, um...

830
00:47:34,614 --> 00:47:36,681
...he killed her.

831
00:47:40,718 --> 00:47:41,919

833
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,790
So, my dad

834
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,992
stopped coming home so much,

835
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:54,196
and, uh, I started to live with
a lot of military families.

836
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:56,998
And then I went to college.

837
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,935
We haven't spent much
time together since she...

838
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:08,340
Shawn, I'm so sorry.

839
00:48:09,307 --> 00:48:10,708

For what?

843
00:48:21,751 --> 00:48:23,852
You waited for me.

If you come out now,

850
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,357
we will let your friends go.

851
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:16,360
Keep resisting...

852
00:49:17,695 --> 00:49:20,231
and we will
have to kill them.

853
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:24,901

00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:15,040
you don't interfere...

866

00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,355
Let's go, come on.

883
00:51:20,992 --> 00:51:23,461
They'll declare my judgment was under
duress, and they'll toss it out,

884
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:25,429
doing you a damn bit of good.

885
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:30,100
My daughter didn't have a choice
when that monster shot her.

886
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:33,202
But you have a choice
tonight, Ken.

887
00:51:33,236 --> 00:51:35,270
I just hope you make
the right one.

888
00:51:37,072 --> 00:51:40,541
You deviate from my
instructions just once,

889
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:42,109
and Erin dies.

890
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:43,344
You got it?

891
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:47,080
Don't fuck with me, Ken.

892
00:51:47,113 --> 00:51:49,414
I didn't get to be
Director of the CIA

893
00:51:49,448 --> 00:51:52,784
without making sacrifices.

894
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,186
Even men like you
can disappear.

895
00:51:58,122 --> 00:52:00,824
This'll be our
dirty little secret.

896
00:52:07,463 --> 00:52:09,197
[Erin]
There, there, there, there.

897
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,866
[Shawn]
Shit. Damn it! Come on!

898
00:52:11,899 --> 00:52:13,934
It's open!
Go in! Go, Erin!

- Shawn?
- Yeah.

903
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,818
I'm really scared.

904
00:52:41,156 --> 00:52:43,357

916
00:53:34,198 --> 00:53:36,199
[Paula]

That's bullshit, okay?
She's lying.

922
00:53:53,548 --> 00:53:55,514
Okay, she has to be lying.

923
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:56,583
Mnh-mnh.

924
00:53:59,217 --> 00:54:01,886
Krieg, confirm he's dead.

925
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,388

I can't let them hurt you.

We're gonna get
out of here, okay?

929
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:12,295
I promise you.

930
00:54:12,328 --> 00:54:14,930
No, that's not a promise
that you can make.

931
00:54:16,164 --> 00:54:18,065
I'm so sorry.

932
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:19,967
Okay, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

933
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,369
I'm sorry, just stay here.

934
00:54:21,402 --> 00:54:23,303
Just stay here
until we're gone, okay?

you want, right?

Come and get me!

I'm giving myself up!

947

Hey, pretty young thing.

Hey.

949
00:55:34,226 --> 00:55:36,327
We need you alive...

950
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:39,431

in one piece!

fucked with us!

954

Hey! Step away.

Kid, you better
use that thing

956
00:55:52,508 --> 00:55:54,676
before I get up
and kick your ass.

957
00:55:57,077 --> 00:55:58,279
You guys okay?

958
00:55:58,312 --> 00:56:00,113

We heard you were dead!

962
00:56:03,683 --> 00:56:06,185
No, they just
gave me a workout.

963
00:56:06,218 --> 00:56:07,986
All right.
Let's get out of here.

- Neal?
- Erin?

969

Where have you been?
We're under attack.

970
00:56:23,164 --> 00:56:24,999
Under attack?
What are you...? Bullshit!

971
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:26,434
Did you not hear
the gunfire?

972
00:56:26,468 --> 00:56:28,235
What gunfire, where?
What do you mean?

973
00:56:28,268 --> 00:56:30,037
- Snipers on the roof...
- You could have died!

Guys, focus!

975
00:56:31,438 --> 00:56:33,139
- You, what...
- Neal.

976
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:35,542
Neal, is there a way
out of here, a hidden exit?

977
00:56:35,576 --> 00:56:38,343
Yeah, there's a, uh,
an old service tunnel

978
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:40,613
between here
and the main building.

979
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,179
- How do we get there?
- Actually, it's, uh...

980
00:56:42,213 --> 00:56:44,048
there's an old elevator
right, right this way.

981
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:45,282
All right, let's go.

982
00:56:45,316 --> 00:56:47,183
Come on.
Right through here.

983
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,303
Come on, go, go,

Goddamn it, Shawn,
I told you to go!

No man left behind, right?

1000
00:58:13,753 --> 00:58:16,054

You said payment
upon delivery.

1011

So I'll take my cash
and I'll leave.

1012
00:59:10,898 --> 00:59:14,702
You know, three people
can keep a secret...

Aaah!

01:19:46,476 --> 01:19:49,345
[both grunting]

1241
01:19:49,378 --> 01:19:50,479
Unhh!

1242
01:19:53,448 --> 01:19:55,216
Aaaah!

1243
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,284
Ahhhh! Aah!

1244
01:19:57,318 --> 01:19:59,787
- [crackling]
- [alarm blaring]

1245
01:20:06,726 --> 01:20:08,560
Aaaah!

1246
01:20:12,263 --> 01:20:15,098
[stammers] I gotta...
I gotta go help my dad.

1247
01:20:26,173 --> 01:20:27,875
That's far enough, Judge.

1248
01:20:32,613 --> 01:20:34,648
Let it go, Phillips.
It's over.

1249
01:20:34,681 --> 01:20:37,683
You're not the one
calling the shots here.

1250
01:20:39,285 --> 01:20:41,386
[Vic]
Director Phillips!

1251
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:44,322
You have three seconds
to put the gun down.

1252
01:20:44,356 --> 01:20:46,256
What's your play?

1253
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:49,393
Huh? You gonna execute
the Director of the CIA

1254
01:20:49,426 --> 01:20:52,362
of the United States of America?
[chuckles]

1255
01:20:52,395 --> 01:20:54,464
Yes.

1256
01:20:54,497 --> 01:20:56,598
Two...

1257
01:20:56,632 --> 01:20:57,733
one.

1258
01:21:01,369 --> 01:21:03,871
You think this ends here?

1259
01:21:05,839 --> 01:21:08,775
I'm just the tip of the spear.

1260
01:21:08,808 --> 01:21:11,477
[laughing]

1261
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:22,686
[Erin sighs]

1262
01:21:29,224 --> 01:21:31,426
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Me too.

1263
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:32,927
Ow! My arm!

1264
01:21:56,413 --> 01:21:57,746
[door closes]

1265
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,816
[Phillips]
Genevieve?

1266
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:03,851
Are you here?

1267
01:22:21,799 --> 01:22:23,367
[ice cubes clatter]

1268
01:22:45,951 --> 01:22:48,287
You survived.

1269
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,254
That's good.

1270
01:22:54,058 --> 01:22:56,693
Drink?

1271
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:59,862
History won't be
kind to you, Mike.

1272
01:23:00,996 --> 01:23:04,332
And that's... unfortunate.

1273
01:23:05,734 --> 01:23:07,669
Our benefactor is worried

1274
01:23:07,702 --> 01:23:10,604
that Walton will talk?

1275
01:23:10,637 --> 01:23:14,307
Because I can assure you,
he won't.

1276
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:17,543
And he won't change
his judgement, either.

1277
01:23:19,444 --> 01:23:22,247
He knows I'm watching.

1278
01:23:23,814 --> 01:23:26,350
And he's afraid.

1279
01:23:29,986 --> 01:23:32,589
All of this will be...

1280
01:23:32,622 --> 01:23:34,490
our secret.

1281
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:38,459
Mike....

1282
01:23:38,493 --> 01:23:41,362
three people
can keep a secret...

1283
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:43,864

[monitor beeping]

1287
01:24:30,734 --> 01:24:33,069
Hey. [groans]

1288
01:24:33,103 --> 01:24:34,738
What time is it?

1289
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:37,940
Past six.

1290
01:24:37,973 --> 01:24:40,508
What's up?
Are you okay?

1291
01:24:45,112 --> 01:24:47,915
Did I ever tell you
how I got this watch?

1292
01:24:49,616 --> 01:24:51,417
I always figured you just

1293
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:53,553
took it off some dead
terrorist or something.

1294
01:24:53,586 --> 01:24:54,686
[chuckles]

1295
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,388
[laughs softly]

1296
01:24:56,421 --> 01:24:58,657
I-I'm just kidding.
How'd you get it?

1297
01:25:00,858 --> 01:25:03,861
President Clinton
awarded my entire unit

1298
01:25:03,894 --> 01:25:06,796
the Medal of Honor in '97.

1299
01:25:07,997 --> 01:25:10,966
- What?
- Yep.

1300
01:25:10,999 --> 01:25:12,601
Holy shit.

1301
01:25:12,634 --> 01:25:14,669
You got the Medal of Honor?

1302
01:25:14,702 --> 01:25:17,371
How did I not know
about this?

1303
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:19,105
It's classified.

1304
01:25:22,143 --> 01:25:24,810
So the president
goes down the line,

1305
01:25:24,844 --> 01:25:27,112
by the time he gets to me,

1306
01:25:27,147 --> 01:25:29,480
they're a medal short.

1307
01:25:29,514 --> 01:25:31,716
But the president,
without missing a beat,

1308
01:25:31,749 --> 01:25:34,084
he takes off his Rolex...

1309
01:25:34,117 --> 01:25:36,653
this Rolex...

1310
01:25:36,687 --> 01:25:38,821
and he hands it to me.

1311
01:25:38,855 --> 01:25:43,024
He says, "I can't have a man
showin' up for the Medal of Honor

1312
01:25:43,058 --> 01:25:45,861
"and leavin' my office
empty-handed.

1313
01:25:45,894 --> 01:25:48,129
"I want you to wear this watch

1314
01:25:48,163 --> 01:25:50,564
and remember
the lives you saved."

1315
01:25:56,603 --> 01:25:59,471
Son...
once you take a life,

1316
01:25:59,504 --> 01:26:02,640
you never sleep
quite the same way again.

1317
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:07,644
You're not really
the same guy anymore.

1318
01:26:12,047 --> 01:26:15,151
So I'm gonna tell you
what President Clinton told me.

1319
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:21,488
When you wear this,

1320
01:26:21,521 --> 01:26:24,892
I want you to think
about the lives you saved...

1321
01:26:24,925 --> 01:26:26,959
not the ones you took.

1322
01:26:31,463 --> 01:26:33,064
[sighs]

1323
01:26:33,098 --> 01:26:36,700
All that time you were gone...

1324
01:26:36,734 --> 01:26:39,036
[sighs]

1325
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,704
I want you to know there
wasn't a day that went by

1326
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,640
where I wasn't proud
to be your son.

1327
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:48,043
[sniffles]

1328
01:26:48,076 --> 01:26:50,145
I always meant
to tell you that.

1329
01:26:53,047 --> 01:26:55,116
I'm proud of you, too.

1330
01:26:56,549 --> 01:26:58,185
- Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

1331
01:27:01,553 --> 01:27:04,088
All right, that's enough
of the mushy stuff.

1332
01:27:04,123 --> 01:27:05,890
[laughs]

1333
01:27:05,924 --> 01:27:07,492
Who wants a drink?

1334
01:27:07,525 --> 01:27:09,493
Um, I think so.

1335
01:27:09,526 --> 01:27:10,827
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1336
01:27:10,861 --> 01:27:12,562
I'm gonna leave
you two kids alone.

1337
01:27:12,596 --> 01:27:14,497
[Erin, Shawn laugh]

1338
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:16,065
Hi. So...
Oh, uh, Dad.

1339
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:17,800
Yeah?

1340
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,534
Merry Christmas.

1341
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:24,972
Thanks, son.

1342
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:26,974
Merry Christmas,
young lady.

1343
01:27:27,007 --> 01:27:28,641
Merry Christmas.

1344
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:31,678
Who's the lucky guy?

1345
01:27:31,711 --> 01:27:34,579
Stop! I see the meds
are kickin' in.

1346
01:27:34,613 --> 01:27:37,782
- Oh, my goodness, it's a twist-off.
- I know, what can I say?

1347
01:27:42,187 --> 01:27:44,688
Mr. Vic Davis.

1348
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:51,827
You ready to pay your dues?

1349
01:27:53,162 --> 01:27:56,231
