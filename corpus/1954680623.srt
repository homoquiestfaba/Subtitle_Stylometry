WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,789
WHEN YOU'RE A PRO,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,521
               ONE-TWO. ONE-TWO.

00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,686
         DOC AIN'T HERE
         NO MORE, MAN.

00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,621
 WHERE IS HE?

15
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,456
              DIED ABOUT
              THREE MONTHS AGO.

OH, MAN. I DIDN'T KNOW.

18
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,399
I WAS INSIDE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

19
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,869
       WELL, I'M RUNNING
       THE PLACE NOW.

20
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,471
       THAT'S HOW IT IS.

21
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,307
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIM?

22
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,410
       CANCER. LOOK, MAN.

23
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,479
        ALL THE STUFF
        THAT WENT DOWN WITH YOU,

24
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,781
     AND YOU JUST GETTING OUT
     OF PRISON, I CAN'T HAVE YOU

25
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,017
           UP IN HERE, MAN.

MAN, I REALLY NEED THIS.
IT'S ALL I'VE GOT.

29
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,661
               YOU LOOK PAST
               YOUR PRIME AGE.

30
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,267
MY MAN, ALL I WANT
TO DO IS TRAIN.

31
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,371
YEAH. IF DOC WAS HERE,
HE'D LET ME TRAIN.

32
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,307
                 DOC AIN'T HERE.

33
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,543
       NO.

34
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,345
NO, HE SURE ISN'T.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

40
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,886
               IT'S GOOD
               TO SEE YOU, TOO.

41
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,489
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING FOR YOU HERE.

42
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,461
         I NEED A PLACE TO STAY.

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,571
I CAN'T DO IT, VIAN.

45
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,408
   I JUST CAN'T.

46
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,144
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED, I'M SORRY.

47
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,880
               IT'S JUST
               FOR A FEW WEEKS.

48
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,782
                I WON'T BE LONG.

49
00:06:56,784 --> 00:07:00,419
 THEY LEFT THE HOUSE
 TO ME, YOU KNOW.

50
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,554
     IT'S IN MY NAME.

51
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,493
<i> HI!</i>

00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,811
HE'S JUST COMING BY
TO SAY HI.

57
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,113
           OKAY.

58
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,994
           MOM, I THINK
           HE WANTED TO COME IN.

59
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,898
DON'T YOU HAVE
SOME HOMEWORK

60
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,834
THAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING?

61
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,936
               I ALREADY DID IT.

             GOOD MEATBALL.

68
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,821
YOU CAN STAY HERE
FOR TWO WEEKS.

69
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,523
IF YOU DRINK,
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

70
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,294
           I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK
           FOR 12 YEARS.

71
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,197

00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,230
   OH, THANKS.

00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,301
          SO, I'VE GOT SOME WORK
          TO CATCH UP ON...

79
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,102

00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,904

             HI, JIMMY.

83
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,709
I LOOKED YOU UP
ON THE INTERNET.

84
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,611

               YUP.

87
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,852
ARE YOU STILL GOING TO FIGHT,
NOW THAT YOU'RE OUT OF PRISON?

88
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,121
             I DON'T KNOW.

89
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,790
I THINK YOU'D DO
REALLY GOOD, UNCLE VI.

90
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,859
            THANKS, JIMMY.

91
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,862
I'M GONNA GO BACK

92
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,764
YOU LIKE TO READ?

00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,200
          YEAH. YEAH, SOMETIMES.

94
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,168
OKAY. GOOD NIGHT.

95
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,870
             YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.

96
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:49,047
    HOW MANY PUSH-UPS
    IS THAT?

97
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,248
             A LOT.

98
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,117
    WELL, HOW MANY
    IS THAT?

99
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,985
             300.

100
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,121
    IS IT TRUE WHAT
    MY DAD SAID ABOUT YOU?

101
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,225
         WHAT DID HE SAY?

102
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,227
   THAT YOU WERE A PIMP
   AND A PUSHER.

103
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,333
         I DID SELL DRUGS ONCE,

104
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,435
            BUT I WAS NEVER
            A PIMP.

105
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:14,806
       IS IT TRUE THAT
       YOU KILLED A MAN?

106
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,307
                    YEAH.

107
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,177
         WHAT HAPPENED?

108
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,379
               I DON'T WANT
               TO TALK ABOUT IT.

109
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,065
                    <i> HEY.</i>

110

          <i> ABOUT WORK.</i>

113
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:48,707
OKAY. UH, HAVE YOU
BEEN TO PRISON?

114
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,975
                    YEAH.

00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,448
WE CAN'T HIRE EX-CONS.
IT'S, UH--

118
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,083
                     SURE.

119
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,718
IT'S AN INSURANCE
ISSUE.

120
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,119
                 YEAH, I KNOW.

00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,387
   I'M REALLY--
                         NO.

122
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,988
OKAY. UH, I'M SORRY.

123
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,047
HEY. DON'T STOP RUNNING.

124
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,749
YOU WANT TO KICK?

125
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,785
JUST TRUST THE BALL
WILL BE THERE.

126
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,955
   BUT I HAVE TO STOP
   BEFORE I CATCH IT.

127
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:39,858
JUST KEEP RUNNING.
WHEN YOU TURN RIGHT,

128
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,761
TRUST THAT THE BALL WILL
BE THERE IN THE POCKET.

129
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,465
WHAT? WANT ME
TO CATCH IT FOR YOU?

130
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,067
                   SHUT UP.

131
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,535
                 HIKE IT AGAIN.

132
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,840
AND YOU SHOULD GO LEFT.

133
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,509
LOOK, JUST KEEP RUNNING, HUH?

134
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:00,011
KEEP RUNNING. OKAY, HIKE.

135
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,450

               TO THROW FOR YOU?

136
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,986
    VERY FUNNY.
    GIVE ME THE BALL.

137
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,522
    GIMME. AND... HIKE!

138
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,557
                      TOUCHDOWN!

139
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,259
         AH! HEY!

140
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,560
                     GOOD CATCH!

141
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,195
THAT WAS A GREAT CATCH!

142
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,799
      OKAY.

143
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,935
      AND...

144
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,237
<i> OH!</i>

145
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,073
             WHAT'S WRONG?

146
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,242
HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH MONEY, THAT'S ALL.

147
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,112
IT'S HARD...
BEING A SINGLE MOM.

148
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,949
                HEY, SORRY.

149
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,520
   IT'S OKAY.

150
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:47,058
 I KNOW THAT GOD
 WILL PROVIDE.

151
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,061
             YEAH, AND I'M GONNA
             WIN THE LOTTERY.

152
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,297
 YOU'RE PITIFUL.

153
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,532
  YOU KNOW THAT?

00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,832
NAH, I DON'T NEED
ANYBODY RIGHT NOW.

             THAT'S A HELL
             OF A REFERENCE,

   ANYTHING.

00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,367
                I'M ROLAND.

321
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,669
      I'M VIAN.

322
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,604
        THAT'S A DIFFERENT NAME.

323
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,106
 IT'S A FAMILY NAME.

324
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,642
           YEAH. WELL,
           I RUN THIS PLACE.

325
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,811
      I DO EVERYTHING. HAD A KID
      QUIT THIS MORNING.

326
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,846
            HE WAS DOING
            TOO MUCH SPEED.

327
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,848
           YOU DON'T DO A LOT
           OF DRUGS, DO YOU?

328
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,084
      NO, NO.

329
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,785
              THAT'S GOOD.

330
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,987
           I'VE GOT A FEELING
           ABOUT YOU, YOU KNOW?

331
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,090
         MY INSTINCTS NEVER LIE.

332
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,592
      IF I GIVE YOU A JOB,
      YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING.

333
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,594
      YOU KNOW, YOU'D HAVE TO
      WAIT TABLES, WASH DISHES--

334
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,030
NO, I'LL SWEEP THE FLOORS,
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

335
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,632
    I DON'T MIND.

336
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,936
         OKAY. IT'S MINIMUM WAGE
         PLUS TIPS.

337
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:53,738
    THAT'S OKAY.

338
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,407
   ALL RIGHT. CAN YOU BE HERE
   TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:00 AM?

339
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,708
SURE.

340
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,477
           ALL RIGHT, MAN.
           LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT.

341
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,945
      THANKS A LOT.
               ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

342
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,556
          SO, IT'S GOOD THAT YOU
          GOT A JOB, HUH, VI?

343
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,960
  YEAH. THANKS.

344
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,098
YOU THINK I COULD BORROW
THE CAR TOMORROW NIGHT?

345
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,902
         UH, WHAT FOR?
         WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO?

346
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,572
   I GOT A DATE.

347
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,776
          YOU CAN'T USE THE CAR.

348
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,780
WELL, IT WILL ONLY BE
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

349
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,548
           OKAY, JIMMY, CAN YOU
           GO TO YOUR ROOM,

350
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,150
          SO I CAN TALK
          TO YOUR UNCLE, PLEASE?

351
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:40,918
BUT I CAN JUST
STAY HERE AND LISTEN.

352
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,020
               GO TO YOUR ROOM.
               THANK YOU.

353
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,861
     I'M FEEDING YOU AND
     GIVING YOU A PLACE TO LIVE.

354
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,631
    I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH, VIAN.

355
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,733
     SURE. UH--

356
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,168
  BUT IT'S JUST
  A COUPLE OF HOURS.

357
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,769
                I JUST SAID NO.
                HOW MANY TIMES

358
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,504
            DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?

359
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,540
         OKAY!

360
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,742
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

361
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,977
      WELL, OBVIOUSLY IT IS.
      OTHERWISE, YOU WOULDN'T BE

362
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,780
         ASKING ME OVER AND OVER
         AND OVER AGAIN.

363
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,450
      I MEAN, I DEPEND ON
      THAT CAR, VIAN, ALL RIGHT?

364
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,585
        I'M ABOUT A MONTH BEHIND
        ON MOST OF MY BILLS.

365
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:17,755
         DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
         WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR ME
         TO GET THROUGH THE DAY?

366
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,089
     I KINDA DO.

367
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,492
                    GOOD.

368
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,793
                       GREAT!

369
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,175
                      HI.

370
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,578
I BROUGHT YOU A PICTURE
OF GRANDPA SHERMAN.

371
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,581
THIS WAS TAKEN BY THE LAKE
THAT HE USED TO TAKE ME TO.

372
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,852
          HUH. YEAH, HE USED TO
          TAKE ME THERE, TOO.

373
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:52,523
WHY DO YOU THINK GOD
HAD GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
DIE IN A CAR CRASH?

374
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,625
          WHO TOLD YOU
          THAT GOD HAD THEM DIE?

375
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:57,661
MOM. SHE SAID THAT GOD
WILL NEVER TAKE ANYONE,

376
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,997
UNLESS IT WAS THEIR TIME.

377
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,198
                      YEAH.

378
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,937
        GOOD MORNING, BEAUTIFUL.

379
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,539
HELLO, WILLIAM.

380
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,274

381
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,276
 THANK YOU FOR
 THE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS,

382
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,512
 BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP
 COMING BY LIKE THIS.

383
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,514
            OH, COME ON.
            DON'T YOU LIKE 'EM?

384
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,282
YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE ON.

385
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,885
     HOW COULD I MOVE ON
     WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME?

386
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:23,020
WILLIAM, WE BROKE UP
THREE MONTHS AGO.

387
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,588
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
DOING THIS.

388
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,789
            COULD I HAVE A KISS?

389
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,191
    NO!

390
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,260
           SUDDENLY YOU'RE
           TOO GOOD TO KISS ME?

391
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:31,929
       LET ME GUESS.
       YOU'RE ALREADY HOOKING UP
       WITH SOME NEW GUY, HUH?

392
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,564
I'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK.

393
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,699
       COME ON. YOU CAN TELL ME.

394
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,168
    YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

395
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,571
           I COULD GIVE YOU
           A GOOD LIFE, SWEETIE.

396
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,139
GOOD-BYE, WILLIAM.

397
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,915
     AND THAT'S THE FLOUR. NOW,
     DON'T GET COCKY ABOUT THIS.

398
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,850
       ALWAYS MEASURE THE WATER.

399
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,184
    UH-HUH.

400
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,886
           THIS TAP WATER IS
           OUR SECRET INGREDIENT

401
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,221
            TO OUR GREAT-TASTING
            CRUST.

402
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,689
      WOW.

403
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,558
             SOME PEOPLE SAY
             IT'S THE OLD PIPES.

404
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,192
        MIGHT BE THE POWER PLANT
        DOWN THE ROAD,

405
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,029
       I DON'T KNOW. POUR IT IN.
       POUR IT IN THERE.

406
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:07,264
         ABSOLUTELY. FIRST TIME.

407
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,770
        THERE YOU GO! ALL RIGHT!

408
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,239
     AH. DID YOU REALLY DO
     A LOT OF COOKING IN PRISON?

409
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,808
         WHAT, NO? WHAT, YEAH,
         I WAS ONE OF THREE GUYS

410
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,111
             AROUND THE KITCHEN.
             YEAH.

411
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,616
  NOW, WHEN YOU WAIT
  ON CUSTOMERS,

412
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:28,285
YOU ALWAYS GOTTA TRY
TO HAVE A GOOD ATTITUDE.

413
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,688
I COULD DO EVERY JOB
HERE, OBVIOUSLY.

414
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,790
THE BEST WAY FOR YOU
TO LEARN REAL FAST

415
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,993
IS TO SHADOW ME, OBSERVE ME,
WATCH ME, OKAY?

416
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,728
                       SURE.

417
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,098
              LIKE, THERE'S ONLY
              US HERE.

418
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,702
HUH?

419
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,337
DON'T FOOL WITH ME, MAN.

420
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:49,073
                       I'M NOT!

421
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,341
ALL RIGHT, IT'S COOL.
IT'S COOL.

422
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:52,343
IT'S JUST A LOT OF GUYS
COME IN HERE,

423
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,078
AND THEY DON'T TAKE
THE JOB SERIOUSLY.

424
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,279
                       SURE.

425
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,780
BUT I KNOW YOU WILL.

426
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,315
              YEAH. HEY, LISTEN.

427
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:01,118
           IS THERE ANY WAY
           I CAN GET AN ADVANCE?

428
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,153
 YOU'VE GOT TO
 BE SHITTING ME, MAN.

429
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,956
           WELL, I'M LIVING
           WITH MY SISTER, AND--

430
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,659
         I'D ASK HER, BUT IT'S
         A LITTLE TENSE, AND I--

431
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,694
  YOU MET A GIRL.

432
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:11,996
                       YEAH!

433
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,330
         YEAH. HOW DID YOU KNOW?

434
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,165
DON'T FOOL WITH THE FOOLER!

435
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,669
I'M A PUSSY GANGSTER
FROM WAY BACK, MAN. COME ON.

436
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:22,139
ALL RIGHT. ONE TIME.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN ADVANCE.

437
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,974
PLEASE DON'T ASK AGAIN.
OKAY?

438
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,143

         YOU CAN'T PICK
         HER UP ON THE BUS.

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,122
       YOU'VE BEEN LOCKED UP
       FOR A LONG TIME.

487
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:21,492
YOU'RE SOMETHING
                ELSE, JIMMY.

488
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:24,094
         CAN YOU TEACH ME
         HOW TO FIGHT?

489
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,096
                        NO.

490
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,375
              <i> THERE'S THIS, UM,</i>
              <i> GREAT PLACE</i>

00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,881
        AND IT'S SO NICE OUT.

494
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:47,050
YEAH? UH, YOU DON'T
WANT TO DRIVE?

495
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,353
        NO. IT'S JUST RIGHT

00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,272
<i> OH, THAT'S GOOD. </i>

501
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:09,840
      NO.

502
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,241
        I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE

503
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,844
         YOU LIVE WITH YOUR
         SISTER AND YOUR NEPHEW.

504
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,445
YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

505
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,080
             SO, WHAT DO YOU DO?

00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,317
   I'M A CHEF.

508
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,189
YEAH. IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THAT?

509
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,424
           NO. NO, I THINK
           IT'S GREAT. I JUST--

510
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,560
       I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT
       YOU WERE IN CONSTRUCTION.

511
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:33,163
  MM. NOW YOU KNOW.

512
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,032
          YOU MUST MAKE
          GOOD MONEY DOING THAT.

513
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:36,900
      OH, YEAH.

514
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:39,603
            SO, WHAT SCHOOL
            DID YOU GO TO?

515
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:45,309
OH, HERE AND THERE.
YOU KNOW? LOCAL.

516
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,311
           IN CULINARY SCHOOL?

517
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:48,512
     WHAT?

518
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,515
               CULINARY SCHOOL.
               CHEF SCHOOL.

519
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:55,118
OH, YEAH, SURE.
SORRY. I, I THOUGHT

520
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,054
YOU SAID SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

521
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:58,889
WHAT ABOUT YOU,
WHAT, WHAT DO YOU DO?

522
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:02,159
     ME? I AM A MORTGAGE BROKER.

523
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,427
        OH.

524
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:06,063
              YEAH. I KIND OF
              FELL INTO IT

525
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,898
              AND WAS REALLY
              GOOD AT IT.

526
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,399
       THEN THE COMPANY I WORKED
       FOR WENT BANKRUPT,

527
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,002
            SO I WAS DEVASTATED.

528
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:14,538
           UM, I DIDN'T THINK
           IT WOULD BE SOMETHING

529
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,107
         I LOVED DOING, BUT WHEN
         THE COMPANY WENT UNDER

530
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,976
             I ENDED UP GETTING
             A BETTER JOB OFFER.

531
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,544
             SO, IT ALL
             KIND OF WORKED OUT.

532
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,313
    YEAH.

533
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,982
        DID THEY MAKE A MISTAKE?

534
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:28,518
UH, NO, NO.
UH, NO, IT'S GOOD.

535
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,468
              WELL, THANK YOU
              FOR DINNER.

536
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,372
SURE. YOU'RE WELCOME.

537
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:50,941
              YOU HAVE TO COOK
              FOR ME ONE DAY.

538
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,142
YEAH.

539
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:55,112
               THAT WAS A REALLY
               GOOD PLACE.

540
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,681
IT WAS, YEAH.

541
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,449
I HAD A REALLY
GOOD TIME.

542
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,651
               YEAH. ME, TOO.

543
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,023
   THANK YOU.

544
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:08,025
                  SURE.

545
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,639
YOU ARE DANGEROUS.

546
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,612
            I COULD COME IN
            FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

547
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,448
ON THE FIRST DATE!

548
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,684
WELL, WHAT KIND OF WOMAN
DO YOU THINK I AM?

549
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:36,320
         ANYWHERE WHERE
         WE COULD WATCH SOME TV.

550
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,188
   I'VE HEARD
   THAT ONE BEFORE.

551
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,424
           YEAH? WELL, WE'LL
           LISTEN TO SOME MUSIC.

552
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,492
WELL, I'VE HEARD
THAT ONE, TOO.

553
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:45,062
                 COME ON.

554
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:46,430
           I WON'T TRY ANYTHING.

555
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:48,498
    THAT'S A LIE.

556
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,967
               HALF A LIE.

557
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,468
A LIE'S A LIE.

558
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,705
NO, I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY.

559
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,576
THERE IS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.

560
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,980
              IS THAT GOOD?

561
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,682
        YEAH.

562
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,689
GOOD NIGHT, VIAN.

00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,377
       HEY. YOU MAKE THIS PIZZA?

567
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,678
     HUH? YEAH.

568
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,547
          IT'S NOT COOKED.

569
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,550
             WE WANT ANOTHER ONE
             THAT HAS HAM AND
             PINEAPPLE ON IT.

571
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,187

COOKED ALL THE WAY.

572
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,524
       SO WHAT? IT'S NOT COOKED.

573
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,759
   I CAN'T DO IT.

574
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,461
        YOU JUST WORK HERE.

575
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,730
        THE HELL DIFFERENCE
        DOES IT MAKE TO YOU?

576
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,332
  IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

577
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,472
         NOW YOU KNOCKED IT
         ON THE GROUND.

578
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,807
         WHAT'S THE MATTER
         WITH YOU?

579
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,608
           HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,078
      CHUM BOY YOU GOT
      UNDERCOOKED OUR PIZZA.

581
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,279
            IS THAT TRUE?

582
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:44,681
  NO.
         WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

583
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,584
    IT FELL.

584
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,586
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

585
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,421
           WE WANT A NEW ONE

586
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,457
           WITH HAM AND
           PINEAPPLE ON IT.

587
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,627
                 OKAY. I'LL MAKE
                 ANOTHER ONE.

588
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:58,862
               SEE THAT, DOG?

589
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:00,864
                THE CUSTOMER'S
                ALWAYS RIGHT.

590
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,875
                HEY, HOW'D IT GO
                LAST NIGHT?

591
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:14,845
  OH, IT WAS
  REALLY GOOD.

592
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:17,114
                  HUH. GET SOME?

593
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,616
  NO. IT WAS
  A FIRST DATE.

594
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,419
           YEAH. I'LL NEVER BE
           ABLE TO KEEP A WOMAN.

595
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,321
           I'M SERIOUS. AT FIRST
           IT'S ALWAYS GREAT,

596
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:26,256
            BUT THEN THEY ALWAYS
            END UP DUMPING ME.

597
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,125
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
DUMP THEM FIRST?

598
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,593
              I TRIED, BUT
              THEY CAN SENSE IT,

599
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,261
           AND THEN THEY GET ME.

600
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,864
                      HEY! HI!

601
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:35,265
                    HEY.

602
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,367
     WHAT'S GOING ON?

603
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,602
    MM.

604
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,370
            UM, IT'S A LOT WORSE
            THAN I THOUGHT.

605
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,771
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

606
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,507
              YEAH. IT'S OKAY.
              I DIDN'T COME

607
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,275
              TO BUM YOU OUT
              ABOUT MY DAD.

608
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:48,411
NO, I'M GLAD YOU CAME.
OH, THAT'S VIAN.

609
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,514
VIAN, UH,
THIS IS CHERRY.

610
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:51,715
                   HEY.

611
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,383
               HI.

612
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,318
HER DAD IS REALLY SICK.

613
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,621
                YEAH? SORRY.

614
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,257
YEAH. HEY, YOU WANNA STAY
AND HAVE SOME LUNCH?

615
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,492
             UH, NO. I WAS JUST
             DRIVING BY.

616
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,927
              GOTTA GO SELL
              MY JEWELRY.

617
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,595
 WHY?

618
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,297
          I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE,
          YOU KNOW.

619
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,166
THERE'S GOT TO BE
ANOTHER WAY.

620
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,735
            I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
            AROUND LATELY.

621
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,904
           IS THERE A NEW GIRL
           OR SOMETHING, OR...

622
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:16,806
NO, NO. WELL,
I'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT,

623
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,809
TRAINING HIM, BUT NO
OTHER GIRLS, YOU KNOW?

624
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,445
         SO, YOU THINK WE CAN
         HANG OUT OR SOMETHING?

625
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:25,215
YEAH. I'D LOVE
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

626
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,217
IT WOULD BE GREAT.
OH, DON'T CRY.

627
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,785
OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

628
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:31,354
          NO, IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW
          MY DAD'S SICK,

629
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,191
             AND I DON'T HAVE
             MONEY, SO...

630
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,792
OH... YOU KNOW WHAT?

631
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,460
YOU KNOW...

632
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,362
 YOU KNOW, I COULD...

633
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,598
I COULD GIVE YOU...

634
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,833
     600?

635
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,902
             YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T
             HAVE TO DO THAT.

636
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,604
I KNOW. I WANT TO.

637
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:50,240
I, I--
IT'S AN HONOR.

638
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,508
              ARE YOU SURE?

639
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,909
I'M 100% SURE.

640
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,678
                  OKAY.

641
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,314
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TONIGHT?

642
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,282
               I DON'T KNOW.

643
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,684
LET'S GET TOGETHER.

644
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,485
              OH. YOU AND ME?

645
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,954
YES. 9:00.
                   OKAY.

646
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:06,356
9:00, CASEY'S, OKAY?
ME AND YOU.

647
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,557
                   OKAY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

648
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,359
           THANKS. OKAY, THANKS.

649
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:10,560
BYE NOW!

650
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,295
                  BYE.

651
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,965
       DON'T SAY A WORD!
       DON'T SAY A WORD.

652
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:17,467
   I WASN'T GOING TO.

653
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,904
       YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
       WE HAVE SOMETHING.

654
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,306
       WE'VE GOT SOMETHING
       GOING ON HERE, MAN.

655
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,510
        <i> THIS PLACE IS</i>
        <i> PRETTY COOL, HUH?</i>

656
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:28,912
 SURE.

657
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,847
         I'M GETTING THE CLUB
         SODA. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

658
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,250
        YES. CLUB SODA
        IS GOOD.

659
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,352
                TWO CLUB SODAS,
                JIMBO.

660
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,424
  ALL THOSE SCHOOLKIDS,
  YOU JUST--

661
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,460
   YOU JUST LET THEM
   ACT LIKE THAT?

662
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:45,328
          THE AFTER-SCHOOL CROWD

663
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,530
              IS A BIG PART
              OF OUR BUSINESS.

664
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,366
   WHAT, THEY DO THAT
   ALL THE TIME?

665
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:50,934
          NO, IT'S JUST
          A HAZING THING THEY DO

666
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,770
             TO NEW EMPLOYEES.

667
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,472
    WHAT'S HAZING?

668
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:57,407
        WELL, THEY GIVE YOU SHIT
        FOR A LITTLE BIT

669
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,376
         AND THEN THEY BACK OFF.

670
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,912
THAT KID IS OUT OF LINE.

671
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,415
          HIS FATHER IS THE D.A.

672
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,850
         SO?

673
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,419
             SO, YOU WANT TO GO
             BACK TO PRISON?

674
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,890
      AH. I SEE HOW IT IS.

675
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:16,326
    YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE
    IN A BAND.

676
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:19,796
YEAH? WHAT KIND
OF BAND?

677
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,898
    ROCK 'N ROLL, OBVIOUSLY.

678
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,970
       YEAH. YEAH,
       THAT WAS MY DREAM.

679
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,738
        NEVER THOUGHT I'D
        WIND UP MAKING PIZZAS.

680
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,341
   WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BAND?

681
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,510
         WELL, TURNS OUT
         I'M A LITTLE TONE DEAF,

682
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,712
       BUT WE STILL GOT A LOT
       OF AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES,

683
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:38,415
       WHICH I SCREWED UP 'CAUSE
       I WAS DRUNK ALL THE TIME.

684
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,383
          I REMEMBER ONCE WE HAD
          THIS SHOW IN TIJUANA,

685
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,886
         AND A LOT OF BIG PEOPLE
         CAME TO SEE US.

686
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:45,555
      I'M OUT IN THE PARKING LOT
      TAKING A LEAK, AND A COP--

687
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,624
          AND HE'S, LIKE,
          "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

688
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,326
         I'M LIKE,
         "I'M MAKING A COCKTAIL.

689
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,361
          YOU WANT ONE, SUCKER?"

690
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:53,596
          SO, THE GOOD COP BEATS
          THE CRAP OUT OF ME,

691
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,999
          TAKES ME TO JAIL. SO,
          I DO KNOW A LITTLE BIT

692
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,468
         ABOUT LIFE BEHIND BARS.

693
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,637
           SIX HOURS. BUT IT WAS
           A MEXICAN JAIL,

694
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,539
       SO THAT'S LIKE DOG YEARS.

695
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,840
      WOW.

696
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,375
              ALL RIGHT.
              YOU WANT TO BREAK?

697
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:06,876
  NO, YOU GO AHEAD.

698
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:07,911
                           COOL.

699
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,949
HEY, IT'S ME AGAIN.

700
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,785
 SHE STILL DOESN'T
 PICK IT UP.

701
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,721
            HAS SHE EVER
            STOOD YOU UP BEFORE?

702
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:19,489
       YES.

703
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,391
         WELL, SHE'S A STRIPPER.

704
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,093
             WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

705
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:25,628
  I KNOW, BUT...

706
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,732
YEAH, I WANT TO
BELIEVE IT BECAUSE...

707
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:33,403
              YOU REALLY THINK
              HER DADDY'S SICK?

708
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,071
   PROBABLY NOT.

709
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,609
THERE'S ANOTHER TIME
I FELL FOR HER BULLSHIT.

710
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:43,413
YOU KNOW, I...
I HAVE TO LET HER GO.

711
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,014
I KEEP THINKING IF I DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

712
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:46,883
 THEN SHE'S GOING
 TO CHANGE.

713
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,552
              A LEOPARD NEVER
              CHANGES ITS SPOTS.

714
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,823
           I GOTTA CATCH MY BUS.

715
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,558
I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE.

716
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,560
               SURE. LET'S GO.

717
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,575
  UH, HEY, WE ALREADY
  ATE DINNER, SO--

718
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,877
                 <i> HEY, I'M OKAY.</i>

719
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,983
    OH, THIS IS ROLAND.
    I WORK FOR HIM.

720
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:22,585
HEY. UH, BETHLEY.

721
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,988
             BETHLEY. WELL,
             THAT'S A COOL NAME.

722
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,092
THANKS FOR GIVING
MY BROTHER A JOB.

723
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,560

00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,623
           TO GET SOME SERVICE
           AROUND HERE?

866
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,292
DON'T TALK
LIKE THAT IN HERE.

867
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,594
             SORRY, NEW GUY.
             SHALL I HAVE A WORD
             WITH MY FATHER

868
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:28,264
          AND GET THE DEPARTMENT
          OF HEALTH DOWN HERE
          FOR A LITTLE VISIT?

869
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:31,434
   HEY, LET'S
   TRY THIS AGAIN.

870
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:33,569
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
THIS AFTERNOON, HUH?

871
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:37,406
        UM, TWO CHICKEN PARM
        SANDWICHES.

872
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:40,142
RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A SEAT?

873
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,345
   I'LL BRING IT
   RIGHT OVER.

874
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,557
                THAT WAS GOOD.

875
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,225
   OH, YEAH. YEAH.

876
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,437
      HEY, LITTLE JIMMY.

877
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:10,673
               GOT ANY NEW BOOKS
               FOR US?

878
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,441
      LEAVE ME ALONE, LEE.

879
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,643
            OH, THAT'S ON WAY
            TO TALK TO A FRIEND.

880
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,612
            I NEED TO BORROW
            SOME MONEY.

881
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,249
              DO YOU HEAR
              WHAT I SAY, BITCH?

882
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,685
    I CAN'T HELP YOU.

883
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,453
         LET'S TAKE A LOOK
         AT THE LITTLE BACKPACK,

884
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,489
                SHOULD WE?

885
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,493
OW!

886
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,332
         WHAT ARE YOU
         LOOKING AT?

887
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:38,634
         I'LL KICK
         YOUR ASS, TOO!

888
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,328
THAT IS SO COOL.

889
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,764
           UH-HUH. YEAH,
           THAT WOULD BE NICE.

890
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:11,500
           JUST HAVE SOME DINNER
           AND JUST HANG OUT.

891
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,202
YEAH. MAKES ME FEEL
REAL GOOD

892
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,637
THAT YOUR SISTER
INVITED ME, YOU KNOW?

893
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:16,739
                      YEAH.

894
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,808
HEY, I WONDER
IF I COULD BRING CHERRY.

895
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,411
              YOU'RE NOT STILL
              SEEING HER.

896
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:26,182
NO, BUT THIS MIGHT BE
A WAY FOR US TO GET BACK
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

897
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,852
               IS THIS A JOKE?

898
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,790
I KNOW.
I'M VERY LONELY.

899
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:36,792
                       WELL...

900
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,694
HEY...
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK

901
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:41,197
ABOUT BECOMING BUSINESS
PARTNERS WITH ME?

902
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,431
               WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

903
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,266
WELL, THE OLD GUY
THAT OWNS THIS PLACE,

904
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,368
HE LOVES ME, BUT HE'S
GOING TO BE SELLING SOON.

905
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,304
HE SAID IF I CAME UP
WITH 30 GRAND

906
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:50,239
FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT,
HE WILL CARRY THE NOTE.

907
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:52,541
I'VE ALREADY SAVED 15 GRAND,
SO ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO

908
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,844
IS COME UP WITH 15 GRAND,
WE'RE BUSINESS PARTNERS.

909
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:57,546
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

910
00:51:57,548 --> 00:52:00,382
          HEY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE
          A CAR. WHERE THE FREAK

911
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:02,284
              AM I GOING TO GET
              15 LARGE, HUH?

912
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,153
I DON'T KNOW...
                       JEEZ.

913
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:06,155
FAMILY OR FRIENDS?
I DON'T KNOW.

914
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,523
                        YEAH.

915
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:09,225
THE PROBLEM IS,
WHOEVER BUYS THIS PLACE

916
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:10,759
IS PROBABLY
GOING TO FIRE US.

917
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,161
                       YEAH?

918
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:13,596
 YEAH.

919
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:16,565
         SHOOT. MAYBE I SHOULD
         GO AND STICK UP A BANK.

920
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,534
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
I WOULD'VE DONE

921
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,703
 BACK IN THE DAY.

922
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:22,304
                     NO KIDDING.

923
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,241
YEAH. I GOT PRETTY BADASS
BEFORE I QUIT DRINKING.

924
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:26,609
                        WOW.

925
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:29,411
YEAH, IT'S CRAZY.
LITTLE METHAMPHETAMINE.

926
00:52:29,413 --> 00:52:33,816
YEAH. MY SISTER WAS A DEALER,
SO I GOT IT FOR FREE.

927
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:39,522
HEY! YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS
OPEN FOR BUSINESS?

928
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,926
                YEAH. WHAT
                WOULD YOU LIKE?

929
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:47,163
I'D LIKE A LARGE
WITH EXTRA PEPPERONI

930
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:49,632
AND EXTRA CHEESE.

931
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:52,334
                   SURE.

932
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,937
               THAT'S 16.67.

933
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:56,539
 ALL RIGHT.

934
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,749
I FORGOT MY WALLET.
CAN I GET YOU TOMORROW?

935
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,652
    COME ON, LEE.

936
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:11,754
    YOU KNOW WE DON'T
    DO THAT FOR ANYBODY.

937
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:14,757
           OH, NO. I, I'LL
           TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT.

938
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:16,859
  BUT IF HE STIFFS US--

939
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,195
                 HE'S NOT GOING
                 TO STIFF US.

940
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:20,462
        OKAY.

941
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,898
  THANK YOU.

942
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,967
           SURE. YOU'RE WELCOME.

943
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,470
                     YES!

944
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:30,506
<i> WHAT ABOUT ME?</i>
<i> CAN I PLAY?</i>

945
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:32,675
            ALL RIGHT. UH, OKAY.
            YOU'RE THE FIRST.

946
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,276
              YOU'RE THE SECOND.

947
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:35,511
    YOU'RE GONNA
    GET ME IN TROUBLE.

948
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:37,546
MOM, CAN I HAVE
SOME MORE CAKE?

949
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,382
       OH, HONEY, NO, NO, NO.
       SUGAR'S GOING TO KEEP YOU
       UP ALL NIGHT.

950
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,784
     BETHLEY, THANK YOU
     SO MUCH FOR DINNER.

951
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:43,619
  I CAN'T EVEN TOUCH DESSERT.

952
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:45,387
               I KNOW. I HAVEN'T
               BEEN INVITED

953
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,323
         TO A HOME-COOKED DINNER
         IN A LONG TIME.

954
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:49,792
     NO? THEN YOU'RE GONNA
     JUST HAVE TO COME OVER

955
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:51,860
MORE OFTEN FOR DINNER, ROLAND.

956
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,017
       HEY, YOU MIND IF
       I CHANGE THE MUSIC?

957
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:17,753
                 SURE, GO AHEAD.

958
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,835
                   ALL RIGHT.

959
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,577
OH, YOUR SISTER'S GREAT!

960
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,046
                    YEAH.

961
00:55:17,048 --> 00:55:18,714
    HOW LONG HAVE YOU
    LIVED WITH HER?

962
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:20,849
                OH, NOT LONG.

963
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,485
           I LIVE IN THE GARAGE.

964
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,487
    OH, YOU CONVERTED
    THE GARAGE?

965
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,723
                HUH. SORT OF.

966
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:30,659
                 COME ON,
                 I'LL SHOW YOU.

967
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,068
               WOW!

968
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:42,438
<i> YEAH. TAKE A SEAT.</i>

969
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,441
        YOU, UH, YOU'RE
        QUITE THE DANCER.

970
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:48,377
             AH, YEAH. I USED TO
             DANCE A LOT.

971
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:51,080
              NOT SO MUCH
              ANYMORE, YOU KNOW.

972
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:53,015
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO GET GOING.

973
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,483
                     WHAT?

974
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:56,418
               WELL, THE PARTY'S
               JUST STARTED.

975
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,520
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I'VE GOT TO GET UP EARLY.

976
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,589
            IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

977
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:02,691
I HAVE A CARDIO CLASS
AT 8:00 A.M.

978
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,959
                 WELL, SKIP IT.

979
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,729
                 SKIP IT ONCE.
                 YOU'LL BE FINE.

980
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:08,697
I WISH I COULD.

981
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,500
BUT WE'LL TALK
TOMORROW, YEAH?

982
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:12,701
                     SURE.

983
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:13,902
     ALL RIGHT.

984
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,104
                   OKAY.

985
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,505
     GOOD NIGHT.

986
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:18,474
                 UH, GOOD NIGHT.

987
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,563
                   GOOD MORNING.

988
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,565
MORNING, JIMMY.

989
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,567
                ME AND MOM ARE
                GOING TO CHURCH.

990
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,636
                DO YOU WANT
                TO COME WITH US?

991
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:50,038
AIN'T NOTHING FOR ME
THERE.

992
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,874
             IF MOM WILL LET ME,

993
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:54,476
              WILL YOU TAKE ME
              TO THE LAKE LATER?

994
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:56,478
 SURE, I WILL.

995
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,064
HOW'S THE LAKE?

996
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:18,600
IS IT STILL THE SAME?

997
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,669
             YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

998
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,840
GRANDPA SHERM USED TO
TAKE ME HERE ALL THE TIME.

999
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,875
HE SAID IT WAS MAGIC.

1000
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:32,481
HE PUT SOMETHING SPECIAL
UNDER THE ROCK HERE.

1001
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,555
               IT SURE IS GOOD
               TO HAVE A FRIEND.

1002
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:41,690
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY FRIENDS AT SCHOOL?

1003
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:45,060
         NO. I DON'T HAVE THAT
         MANY FRIENDS AT SCHOOL.

1004
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,763
             THAT'S WHY I'M SO
             GLAD YOU SHOWED UP.

1005
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:50,799
         IT SURE IS GOOD TO HAVE
         A FRIEND IN LIFE.

1006
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:54,136
  YEAH. I'M GLAD
  WE'RE FRIENDS.

1007
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,104
              DID YOU EVER THINK
              THERE'S SOMETHING

1008
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:58,474
           BIGGER THAN
           THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD?

1009
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:02,578
      I DON'T KNOW.
      LIKE THE UNIVERSE?

1010
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,713
               LIKE, IT'S SO BIG
               AND AMAZING,

1011
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:06,682
          BUT NO ONE CAN SEE IT,

1012
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:08,750
            AND JUST EVERYWHERE.

1013
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,754
COME ON.

1014
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:14,890
                  GO FOR A PASS.

1015
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,595
   HOW DID YOU
   FIND THIS OUT?

1016
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:22,564
                I HAVE PEOPLE.

1017
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:24,766
  HE WAS IN PRISON?

1018
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:26,635
                 KILLED A GUY.

1019
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,072
        WHAT?

1020
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:32,641
           SECOND-DEGREE MURDER.

1021
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:36,812
       BEAT A GUY TO DEATH.
       SPENT 12 YEARS IN PRISON.

1022
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,916
                JUST LOOKING OUT
                FOR YOU, JO.

1023
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:48,657
               THIS IS AN EX-CON
               MURDERER.

1024
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:50,259
              HE SHOULD AT LEAST
              HAVE THE DECENCY

1025
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:52,127
          TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

1026
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,935
 I WANT YOU TO GO.

1027
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,973
             YOU DON'T WANT
             TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

1028
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,610
     JUST GO.

1029
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,615
                  BABY, LISTEN--

1030
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:16,585
DON'T TOUCH ME. JUST GO.

1031
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:31,099
           HEY, I THINK I'VE GOT
           SOME BAD NEWS.

1032
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,335
             WHAT?

1033
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:35,103
       I THINK THE OLD MAN FOUND
       A BUYER FOR THIS PLACE.

1034
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,738
  <i> YEAH?</i>

1035
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,708
         YEAH. WERE YOU ABLE TO
         COME UP WITH ANY MONEY?

1036
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,210
HEY, I TOLD YOU, I DON'T
HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY.

1037
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:44,212
               WELL, HE'S
               GOING TO SELL IT.

1038
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:46,848
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

1039
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,850
                MAYBE GET A JOB
                AT ONE OF THOSE

1040
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:51,086
                FAST FOOD PLACES
                OUT BY THE MALL.

1041
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,221
YOU THINK THEY'LL HIRE ME?

1042
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,791
                  PROBABLY.

1043
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:58,193
            HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL
            WITH YOUR SISTER?

1044
00:59:58,195 --> 01:00:00,796
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1045
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:02,764
              I MEAN, SHE SEEMS
              REALLY COOL.

1046
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,234
HEY, YOU KEEP AWAY
FROM HER.

1047
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,138
WHAT THE F IS SO FUNNY?

1048
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,641
             I ASSUME
             WE'RE ADULTS HERE.

1049
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,145
SHE'S NOT FOR YOU.

1050
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:19,314
            A LITTLE JUDGMENTAL,
            COMING FROM YOU.

1051
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:21,650
HEY, YOU GO OUT
WITH BIMBO STRIPPERS.

1052
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,719
SHE'S A GOOD WOMAN,
OKAY?

1053
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,854
SHE HAS A SON.

1054
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:28,223
HER HUSBAND RAN OFF
WITH SOME SKANKPOT.

1055
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:31,026
WON'T EVEN PAY CHILD SUPPORT.

1056
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:33,629
               AND YOU PUT ME
               IN THAT CATEGORY?

1057
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:35,831
  NO.

1058
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,000
       WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK
       ABOUT THIS ANYMORE, OKAY?

1059
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:40,268
         I ONLY BROUGHT IT UP
         OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOU.

1060
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,270
GOOD. SO NOW YOU KNOW.

1061
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:43,672
                    <i> YEAH, I DO.</i>

1062
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,007
KEEP THE F AWAY FROM HER.

1063
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:46,408
             OR WHAT, YOU'RE
             GONNA KICK MY ASS?

1064
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,343
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

1065
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:50,846
         IS THAT A THREAT, VIAN?
         ARE YOU THREATENING ME
         RIGHT NOW?

1066
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:52,347
BACK OFF, ROLAND.

1067
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:55,417
          YOU KNOW WHAT?
          MAYBE I MISJUDGED YOU.

1068
01:00:55,419 --> 01:00:57,185
   MAYBE WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER.

1069
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,987
   YEAH? WHAT?

1070
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,023
YOU'RE GONNA FIRE ME?

1071
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:03,158
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO OFF
WITH MY SISTER?

1072
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,427
         YOU USED TO BE THE BOSS
         IN PRISON, I'M SURE,

1073
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:07,763
         BUT YOU'RE NOT
         THE FREAKING BOSS HERE!

1074
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:09,064
                    I AM!

1075
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:11,066
HEY, FORGET YOU, ROLAND.

1076
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:12,901
I DON'T NEED THIS SHAM.

1077
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:15,203
           THAT'S GOOD,
           BECAUSE YOU'RE FIRED!

1078
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:17,172
YEAH? SCREW YOU!

1079
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,373
                SCREW YOU!

1080
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,841
     SCREW YOU!

1081
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,951
YEAH, I'M JUST
DOWN THE STREET.

1082
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,155
    YEAH.

1083
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:35,257
I COULD COME OVER
AND SAY HI.

1084
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:40,262
YEAH? THAT'S COOL.

1085
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,099
SURE. I'LL BE THERE
IN TEN MINUTES.

1086
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:46,101
 YEAH. BYE.

1087
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,972
               <i> WHAT'S GOING ON?</i>

1088
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:53,709
NOTHING. I'M JUST
GETTING READY FOR WORK.

1089
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,479
                WHAT'S WRONG?

1090
01:01:57,481 --> 01:02:01,216
I, UM... I DON'T THINK
THIS IS WORKING.

1091
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,454
              WE JUST STARTED
              SEEING EACH OTHER.

1092
01:02:05,456 --> 01:02:06,888
   IT'S NOT YOU.

1093
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,390
              <i> WHAT IS IT, THEN?</i>

1094
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:10,425
 I JUST CAN'T
 DO THIS ANYMORE.

1095
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:13,261
I'M MESSED UP, AND
I SHOULDN'T BE SEEING
ANYONE RIGHT NOW.

1096
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,331
              BUT WHAT DID I DO?

1097
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,166
NOTHING. NOTHING.
I'M JUST...

1098
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:20,001
 I'M IN A BAD PLACE,

1099
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:21,937
AND I NEVER SHOULD'VE
GONE OUT WITH YOU

1100
01:02:21,939 --> 01:02:24,106
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

1101
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:27,876
              THERE'S SOMETHING
              GOING ON,

1102
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,978
          AND YOU DON'T WANT
          TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

1103
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,948
         SO, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

1104
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,023
                CAN I HELP YOU?

1105
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:45,460
           YEAH.

1106
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:47,963
               WHAT DO YOU NEED?

1107
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:49,798
           I, UH...

1108
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,904
        AH, NOTHING.

1109
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:03,445
               YOU'RE AN ABACUS?

1110
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:07,349
     I DO! I HAVE A STONE
     IN THE NECK. OH, MY GOSH.

1111
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,418
                   <i> HEY, VI.</i>
                           <i> HEY!</i>

1112
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,953
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1113
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,422
         HAVING A CUP OF COFFEE.

1114
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:15,824
   GET OUT OF HERE.

1115
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:17,125
                    NO, COME ON.

1116
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,060
         YOU KNOW WHAT?
         I TRIED TO TALK TO YOU,

1117
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:20,295
            BE STRAIGHT ABOUT
            LIKING YOUR SISTER--

1118
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,897
GET THE HELL OUT OF HER!

1119
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:24,833
                <i> HEY! HEY! VIAN,</i>
                <i> THAT'S ENOUGH.</i>

1120
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:26,835
          WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

1121
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:28,804
                  MAYBE YOU NEED
                  TO GO, OKAY?

1122
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,372
            YOU GET OUT OF HERE,
            ALL RIGHT?

1123
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:33,141
   THIS IS MY HOUSE, OKAY?
   YOU DON'T EVEN PAY RENT HERE.

1124
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,477
                YEAH, ALL RIGHT?
                YOU DON'T KNOW
                WHAT IT'S LIKE.

1125
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,245
           YOU DON'T KNOW
           WHAT MY LIFE IS LIKE,

1126
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:39,047
         WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,
         WHAT IT'S LIKE

1127
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:41,149
            TO RAISE A KID ON
            MY OWN WITH NO HELP!

1128
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,551
    SHUT UP.

1129
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:45,187
         WHERE WERE YOU, HUH?
         SO YOU DON'T GET TO SAY

1130
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:47,889
         ANYTHING ABOUT HOW I DO
         THINGS. DO YOU GET IT?

1131
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:51,159
             YOU LOST THAT RIGHT
             A LONG TIME AGO!

1132
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:57,132
                YEAH! OH, YEAH,
                THAT'S GREAT.

1133
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:59,134
                JUST LEAVE!

1134
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:01,069
     DON'T EVEN DEAL WITH IT
     'CAUSE IT'S WORKED OUT

1135
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:03,104
     SO WELL FOR YOU
     YOUR WHOLE LIFE!

1136
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,580
         UNCLE VI, I BROUGHT YOU
         A CUP OF COFFEE.

1137
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,317
        HEY, JIMMY.

1138
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:19,354
        THANKS.

1139
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,460
     MM. IT'S NOT BAD.
     DID YOU MAKE IT?

1140
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:26,895
                   YEAH.

1141
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:29,865
            YOU EVER READ
            THE BOOK I GAVE YOU?

1142
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,867
ABOUT THE OLD MAN?

1143
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,568
              YEAH, "THE OLD MAN
              AND THE SEA."

1144
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:37,339
  NO, I HAVEN'T
  STARTED IT YET.

1145
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:40,008
         I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT,
         ESPECIALLY THE END.

1146
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:43,478
    YEAH.

1147
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:51,286
                 WHAT'S WRONG?

1148
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:53,221
    OH, I JUST WANT
    TO BE SOMEONE,

1149
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,290
    MAKE SOMETHING
    OF MY LIFE.

1150
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:01,062
 THOUGHT I COULD BE
 A FIGHTER, BUT,

1151
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,565
I DON'T KNOW. JUST...

1152
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:07,535
IT PRETTY MUCH SEEMS
I'VE AMOUNTED TO NOTHING.

1153
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:10,138
   JUST SOME...

1154
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,141
  BROKEN DOWN GUY
  LIVING IN A GARAGE.

1155
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:17,045
     BUT UNCLE VI, YOU'RE
     THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD.

1156
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:19,614
 YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
 JUST A KID.

1157
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:21,650
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW?

1158
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,261
        HEY, GO GET US
        A TABLE, WOULD YA?

1159
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,139
               WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1160
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,608
           I WANT A LARGE
           EXTRA CHEESE

1161
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,543
           WITH SAUSAGE
           AND MUSHROOM.

1162
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:53,081
        HEY, WHERE'S VIAN?

1163
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,050
                 HE DOESN'T WORK
                 HERE ANYMORE.

1164
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:56,418
              WHY?

1165
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,320
                    HE MOVED ON.

1166
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:00,088
   HE'S THE BEST GUY
   YOU EVER HAD!

1167
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,023
        WELL, HE DOESN'T WORK
        HERE ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

1168
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:03,258
                       SIT DOWN.

1169
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,560
           WHAT, UH-- WHAT
           DO THE TESTS SAY?

1170
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:41,629
THERE'S SLIGHT
HEMORRHAGING
ON THE BRAIN.

1171
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:43,064
                 OH, NO.

1172
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:46,001
THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL
IN BRAIN TRAUMA.

1173
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:49,004
           UM, WHEN WILL HE
           COME OUT OF THE COMA?

1174
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:52,374
WELL, THAT I CAN'T
TELL YOU EXACTLY.

1175
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:55,343
              DAYS? ARE WE
              TALKING WEEKS?

1176
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,212
ONLY TIME CAN TELL.

1177
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:59,147
               OUR FATHER
               WHO ART IN HEAVEN

1178
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:01,149
           HALLOWED BE THY NAME.

1179
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:02,751
            THY KINGDOM COME,
            THY WILL BE DONE

1180
01:07:02,753 --> 01:07:04,753
  ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.

1181
01:07:04,755 --> 01:07:06,755
      GIVE US THIS DAY...

1182
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:35,250
                  OH, JIMMY.

1183
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:41,756
               JIMMY, I LOVE YOU
               SO MUCH.

1184
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,631
          WHAT TIME IS IT?

1185
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:51,800
                   I DON'T KNOW.

1186
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,103
                <i> SOMETIME</i>
                <i> IN THE MORNING.</i>

1187
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:57,806
  OH. I'VE GOT TO CALL WORK
  AND TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED.

1188
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,778
         I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1189
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,081
                         SURE.

1190
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,308
THIS IS A HOSPITAL?

1191
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,243
                  HEY, JIMMY.

1192
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,281
I WAS DREAMING AND
IN THE SPECIAL PLACE.

1193
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,750
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.

1194
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:45,153
THE LAKE...
AND THE ROCK!

1195
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:47,355
THE ROCK IS RIGHT THERE
FOR YOU AND MY MOM!

1196
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:49,491
                     SURE.

1197
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:54,496
I SURE COULD GO
FOR SOMETHING TO EAT.

1198
01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:56,331
DO YOU WANT TO EAT
WITH ME?

1199
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,666
                   SURE.

1200
01:08:58,668 --> 01:09:01,236
              ANYTHING YOU WANT.

1201
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:03,571
 PEOPLE CAN BE
 SO SILLY,

1202
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,340
 ALL TRAPPED UP
 IN THEIR MINDS,

1203
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:07,509
AND FISHES JUST KEEP
SWIMMING, AND GRASSHOPPERS

1204
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,878
ARE TALKING NICE,
VERY NICE.

1205
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,679
HEY!

1206
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,682
SWEETHEART!

1207
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:17,652
       I KEPT TRYING TO TELL YOU
       I WAS OKAY, MOM.

1208
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,488
    YOU DID. YES, YOU DID.

1209
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,724
      BUT I HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.

1210
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:25,560
     YES! OF COURSE,

1211
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:27,795
  I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME.
  BABY, I LOVE YOU.

1212
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,664
  I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1213
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,633
           I LOVE YOU, TOO, MOM.

1214
01:09:31,635 --> 01:09:33,401
            LOVE IS REALLY GOOD.

1215
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:36,304
        OH...

1216
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:38,606
     BABY? JIMMY?

1217
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,743
JIMMY? NO, NO, NO, NO.

1218
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:43,511
JIMMY? JIMMY, COME BACK.
COME ON, HONEY.

1219
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,247
COME ON, SWEETHEART.
COME BACK. VIAN--

1220
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:47,782
               GO GET SOMEBODY.
               GET THE DOCTOR.

1221
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:49,784
               WE NEED A DOCTOR,
               PLEASE!

1222
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:52,854
HEY. COME ON, BABY.
COME ON.

1223
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,223
COME ON, SWEETHEART,
WAKE BACK UP.

1224
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:57,525
                    I, I DON'T
                    UNDERSTAND.

1225
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:01,529
      A SURGE. IT'S NOT
      COMMON, BUT IT DOES HAPPEN
      WITH PEOPLE IN A COMA.

1226
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,331
     A SUDDEN SURGE OF ENERGY,

1227
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:05,300
         A BRIEF MOMENT
         OF CONSCIOUSNESS,

1228
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:07,802
    AND THEN THEY LAPSE BACK
    INTO THEIR COMA STATE.

1229
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:10,238
             BUT WHY, AND WHY
             FOR JUST A MINUTE--

1230
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,374
IT'S NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD.

1231
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,443
                 IT DOESN'T MAKE
                 ANY SENSE.

1232
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,222
                   YOU OKAY?

1233
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,892
              NO.

1234
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:33,661
         I'M NOT OKAY.

1235
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:47,709
I'M GONNA GO INSIDE AND...

1236
01:10:47,711 --> 01:10:51,546
   TAKE A SHOWER
   AND THEN GO BACK.

1237
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,250
               I'LL GO WITH YOU.

1238
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,351
      DEAR GOD,
      I WANT TO SAY A PRAYER

1239
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:35,556
    THAT YOU WATCH OVER JIMMY

1240
01:11:35,558 --> 01:11:38,593
    AND THE REST OF MY FAMILY.

1241
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:45,867
  I KNOW THAT, WHATEVER HAPPENS,
  IT'S YOUR WILL,

1242
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:48,803
     AND I HAVE TO TRUST THAT.

1243
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:55,343
  AND ALTHOUGH I FEEL ALONE,
  I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THERE, GOD.

1244
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:59,347
            I DON'T...

1245
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,387
     I JUST DON'T KNOW
     IF I'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

1246
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:15,697
       I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.
       I DON'T KNOW HOW.

1247
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,129
                  HELLO?

1248
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,066
                   YES.

1249
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,449
                  YEAH.

1250
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:22,864
               VIAN? VIAN!

1251
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,977
HE'S GONE!

1252
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,150
               HE'S GONE.

1253
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,867
                  AH.

1254
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,181
        OH, MAN. THAT'S GOOD.

1255
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:42,870
                    HI!

1256
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,939
SIS!

1257
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:49,043
                    OOH.

1258
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:54,081
WE HAD A DEAL YOU COULD
STAY HERE IF YOU DIDN'T DRINK.

1259
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:00,621
                THAT'S OKAY.

1260
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:02,857
  YOU NEED TO GO, VIAN.

1261
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:04,825
            WHERE AM I GONNA GO?

1262
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:06,761
HUH?

1263
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:09,230
   I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.

1264
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:12,567
           IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

1265
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:14,602
        IT'S NO BIG DEAL AT ALL.

1266
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:16,270
                   COME ON.

1267
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:18,272
DON'T. DON'T COME NEAR ME!

1268
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:21,075
                WHY ARE YOU
                SO UPTIGHT? HEY!

1269
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:31,852

              MY SISTER, HUH?

1270
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:37,024
            AH, WHERE AM I GONNA
            GO, HUH?

1271
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,363
         I GOTTA FIND SOMETHING.

1272
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,318
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO DRINK?

1273
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,655
      I HAVE SOMEONE COMING OVER
      IN A FEW MINUTES.

1274
01:17:07,657 --> 01:17:10,391
 YOU HAVE A NEW GUY
 ALREADY? WOW.

1275
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,830
THAT DIDN'T TAKE
BUT A HOT SECOND

1276
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:18,633
FOR SOME OTHER SUCKER
TO START GIVING YOU
THE HARD ONE.

1277
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:20,234
               YOU KNOW WHAT?
               YOU'RE DRUNK,

1278
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:22,203
             AND I THINK
             YOU SHOULD GET OUT.

1279
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:25,039
I NEED A PLACE TO STAY
FOR THE NIGHT.

1280
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,074
  CAN I STAY HERE
  FOR THE NIGHT?

1281
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:28,843
                       NO.

1282
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:30,244
   OH, COME ON.

1283
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:32,647
               DO YOU HAVE
               ANY SELF-RESPECT?

1284
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:35,016
HEY, WHA-- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T NEED YOU.

1285
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:37,718
 I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT.

1286
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,187
YOU KNOW, I'D COME
OVER HERE THINKING

1287
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:44,792
MAYBE, MAYBE WE HAD
SOMETHING GOING.

1288
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:47,128
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE DON'T.

1289
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:49,030
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
GOING, DO WE?

1290
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:51,298
                 NO, WE DON'T.

1291
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:56,437
I DON'T NEED YOU.

1292
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:58,205
IF YOU WANTED
TO BE BACK WITH ME,

1293
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:00,441
 I WOULDN'T EVEN WANT
 TO BE WITH YOU.

1294
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:03,377
YOU, YOU JERK MY CHAIN

1295
01:18:03,379 --> 01:18:06,080
AND ACT LIKE
YOU'RE INTO ME.

1296
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:08,049
  WHAT A JOKE.

1297
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,054
YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO DRINK?

1298
01:18:13,056 --> 01:18:15,222
                 NO. GET OUT.

1299
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:19,060
 DON'T YOU CALL ME.

1300
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,264
YOU DON'T CALL ME NO MORE.

1301
01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:25,032
I'M DONE WITH YOU.

1302
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:04,271
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE CLOSING AT 10:00,
SO START WRAPPING IT UP!

1303
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:10,144
  WHAT THE HELL?

1304
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,447
 WHAT THE FREAK
 YOU'RE DOING, VI?

1305
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,385
LEAVE ME ALONE.

1306
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:20,054
         LEAVE YOU ALONE?
YES.

1307
01:19:20,056 --> 01:19:22,056
         ARE YOU STUPID
         OR SOMETHING?

1308
01:19:22,058 --> 01:19:23,958
       I TOLD YOU NOT
       TO FREAKING COME HERE,

1309
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,493
          NOW GET YOUR STUFF
          AND GET OUT!

1310
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:29,029
            SCREW YOU.

1311
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:31,265
HEY, MAN! WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

1312
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:38,305
               GET OFF OF ME!

1313
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:41,142
                 <i> YEAH, HIT HIM!</i>

1314
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:42,977
                 <i> HIT HIM AGAIN!</i>

1315
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:50,317
          ALL RIGHT. THAT'S
          ENOUGH, THAT'S ENOUGH.

1316
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:52,353
               COME ON! COME ON!

1317
01:19:52,355 --> 01:19:54,789
      DON'T BRING YOUR FOOT
      BACK IN HERE!

1318
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,292
          SCREW HIM, MAN!

1319
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:07,501
   DID YOU SPEAK TO THE COPS?

1320
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:09,236
                  <i> CHARGING YOU</i>
                  <i> WITH FELONY</i>

1321
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:11,138
          <i> AND ASSAULT</i>
          <i> WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.</i>

1322
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,943
             YEAH.

1323
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:18,546
    GUESS I'LL BE GOING AWAY
    FOR A LONG WHILE.

1324
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,349
   THAT'S OKAY.

1325
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,318
 YOU GUYS CAN LEAVE.

1326
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,555
   JIMMY'S FUNERAL
   IS TODAY.

1327
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,494
    I WISH I COULD MAKE IT.

1328
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:37,331
YEAH, I KNOW YOU'LL
BE THERE IN SPIRIT.

1329
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:40,835
         HEY, VIAN. YOU KNOW
         THOSE MEETINGS I GO TO?

1330
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,036
   YEAH?

1331
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:43,337
         WELL, I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

1332
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,172
               I'VE BEEN SOBER
               18 YEARS, AND--

1333
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,908
 STUFF YOUR MEETINGS
 UP YOUR FRICKING ASS.

1334
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:52,146
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO SEE MY SISTER!

1335
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,222
      LET'S GO.

1336
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,482
              HEY, UNCLE VI.

1337
01:22:01,484 --> 01:22:02,983
      JIMMY?

1338
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:05,920
               IT'S OKAY.

1339
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,223
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 IS THIS A DREAM?

1340
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:11,258
           I CAME TO TELL YOU
           THAT'S IT'S ALL OKAY,

1341
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,060
             AND EVERYTHING
             IS PERFECT.

1342
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,168
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALIVE.

1343
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:22,536
                 I'M RIGHT HERE.

1344
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:24,405
                I TALKED TO YOUR
                MOM AND DAD.

1345
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:26,173
                THEY SAY
                THEY LOVE YOU.

1346
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:28,509
              GRANDPA SHERM,
              HE SAYS HE'S SORRY

1347
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:30,978
               THAT HE BEAT YOU.

1348
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,647
YEAH? WELL,
IF HE'S SO SORRY,

1349
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:36,417
HOW COME
HE NEVER TOLD ME?

1350
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:38,953
            HE DID. HE WROTE YOU
            IN PRISON,

1351
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:40,554
                WHEN YOU WERE
                TOO MAD AT HIM,

1352
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:42,289
                THAT YOU DIDN'T
                OPEN HIS LETTER.

1353
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,958
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

1354
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,492
                   I KNOW.

1355
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:49,596
I'M SORRY FOR
WHAT I SAID ABOUT YOU,

1356
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:52,166
ABOUT YOU
JUST BEING A KID.

1357
01:22:52,168 --> 01:22:55,302
             IT'S OKAY.
             I KNOW YOU LOVE ME.

1358
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:59,139
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1359
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:01,675
              I HAD A FEW THINGS
              TO TELL YOU.

1360
01:23:01,677 --> 01:23:04,578
   MAN...

1361
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:09,149
  I'M SO HAPPY
  TO SEE YOU...

1362
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:13,120
EVEN IF THIS IS SOME
KINDA WEIRD DREAM.

1363
01:23:13,122 --> 01:23:15,723
            MY MOM, SHE NEEDS
            YOUR LOVE RIGHT NOW.

1364
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:19,426
I'M GOING BACK TO PRISON.
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

1365
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:21,228
        JUST TRUST THAT YOU CAN.

1366
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:22,763
TRUST THAT I CAN DO WHAT?

1367
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:25,399
               THAT YOU CAN DO
               ANYTHING.

1368
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:28,235
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, JIMMY?

1369
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:30,104
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1370
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:32,206
               JUST TRUST THAT
               IT WILL BE THERE.

1371
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:35,209
TRUST WHAT WILL BE WHERE?

1372
01:23:35,211 --> 01:23:37,611
   I'LL SEE YOU LATER, UNCLE VI.

1373
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,375
         YOU HAVE BEEN
         RELEASED.

1374
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,643
                      BY WHO?

1375
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:11,545
       I DON'T KNOW.
       THE WATCH COMMANDER

1376
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,080
       WANTED ME
       TO RELEASE YOU.

1377
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,521
                WHAT'S GOING ON?
                WHO GOT ME OUT?

1378
01:24:20,523 --> 01:24:22,456
      LEE. REMEMBER
      THE LITTLE PUNK

1379
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:24,224
    THAT USED TO GIVE YOU
    A HARD TIME?

1380
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,326
    HE CAME IN FOR A PIZZA
    AND ASKED ABOUT YOU.

1381
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:27,728
       I TOLD HIM
       WHAT HAPPENED.

1382
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,663
  HE SEEMED UPSET, SAID
  HE WAS GOING TO TALK

1383
01:24:29,665 --> 01:24:31,331
     TO HIS OLD MAN,
     THE D.A.

1384
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:33,100
     HE GOT YOU OUT.

1385
01:24:33,102 --> 01:24:34,768
 ALL RIGHT? LET'S GO!

1386
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,170
                    YEAH.

1387
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:37,504
I'LL BE OUT IN THE CAR.

1388
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:39,606
                    OKAY.

1389
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,197
                   HI THERE.

1390
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,239
               I'M TRULY SORRY.

1391
01:25:12,241 --> 01:25:13,874
               I'M SORRY
               FOR EVERYTHING.

1392
01:25:13,876 --> 01:25:15,876
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING.

1393
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,783
               I HAD NO RIGHT...

1394
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:26,220
          TO TELL YOU TO STOP
          GOING OUT WITH ROLAND.

1395
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:30,157
    YEAH.

1396
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:35,329
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T.

1397
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:41,668
  SO, UM...

1398
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:45,639
WHAT, WHAT'S, UH...

1399
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:47,641
 WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

1400
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,578
          I'M GOING TO GO TO
          THE MEETINGS WITH HIM.

1401
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:54,181
 THAT'S GOOD.

1402
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:56,350
               YEAH.

1403
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:05,659
YOU KNOW, I'M GIVING HIM
ANOTHER CHANCE.

1404
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:08,195
        I CAN LEAVE IF YOU WANT.

1405
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:10,697
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, GONNA LIVE IN--

1406
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:11,899
           I'LL STAY WITH--

1407
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:13,333
  IN A SHELTER?

1408
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:14,835
            OH, I'LL STAY
            WITH ROLAND.

1409
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:18,539
          I CAN STAY WITH HIM.

1410
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:21,508
HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM.

1411
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:25,712
            THAT'S GREAT.

1412
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:27,714
     YEAH.

1413
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:31,318
           DID YOU SAY YES?

1414
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,187
YEAH, I DIDN'T HAVE
AN ANSWER.

1415
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:36,657
IT'S SO SOON, YOU KNOW,
AND THIS WAS BEFORE--

1416
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:38,192
     JIMMY.

1417
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:39,793
          WELL, HE'LL BE LUCKY
          TO HAVE YOU.

1418
01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:42,930
OKAY, WHAT'S WITH YOU?

1419
01:26:42,932 --> 01:26:46,867
 WHY THE SUDDEN
 CHANGE OF HEART?

1420
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:51,572
           IF I TOLD YOU, YOU
           WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

1421
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,582
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

1422
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:05,452
                DO WHAT?

1423
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:06,853
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN LIVE--

1424
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:09,590
I DON'T KNOW, VI.
IT JUST...

1425
01:27:09,592 --> 01:27:11,592
YOU KNOW, JUST...

1426
01:27:11,594 --> 01:27:13,827
 IT JUST KILLS ME,
 YOU KNOW?

1427
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:15,762
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO. I DON'T KNOW

1428
01:27:15,764 --> 01:27:18,332
HOW TO KEEP GOING,
YOU KNOW?

1429
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,269
LIKE ROLAND,
HE DRIVES YOU OUT,

1430
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:23,804
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

1431
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:26,807
I CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN.

1432
01:27:26,809 --> 01:27:30,244
FEELS LIKE MY SKIN IS BEING
RIPPED OFF MY BODY.

1433
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:32,312
            HEY, COME HERE.

1434
01:27:32,314 --> 01:27:33,847
             I LOVE YOU,

1435
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:36,483
            AND I WILL DO
            ANYTHING FOR YOU.

1436
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:41,989
     THANK YOU.

1437
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,471
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU,

1438
01:27:57,473 --> 01:27:59,339
BUT I KNOW IT'S GOOD.

1439
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:06,913
THAT MAY BE THE ONLY LIGHT
I HAVE RIGHT NOW.

1440
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,763
                  THE ROCK.

1441
01:28:22,765 --> 01:28:25,465
HE PUT SOMETHING SPECIAL
UNDER THE ROCK HERE.

1442
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:29,903
          WHAT'S UNDER THE ROCK?

1443
01:28:29,905 --> 01:28:32,406
THE ROCK, IT'S RIGHT THERE
FOR YOU AND MY MOM.

1444
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,957
                THIS IS BULL!

1445
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:58,098
              ONE MORE TRY.

1446
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:33,367
                 WOW.

1447
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:50,384
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
TAKE THE MONEY?

1448
01:29:50,386 --> 01:29:52,853
               NO, I DON'T WANT
               YOUR BLOOD MONEY.

1449
01:29:52,855 --> 01:29:55,622
   JIMMY LEFT IT
   FOR YOU!

1450
01:29:55,624 --> 01:29:59,025
             VIAN, TELL ME WHERE
             YOU GOT THE MONEY.

1451
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:02,429
  I TOLD YOU.
  JIMMY CAME TO ME,

1452
01:30:02,431 --> 01:30:05,065
  LIKE, IN A DREAM
  BUT MORE REAL.

1453
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:08,635
 HE SAID OUR FATHER,
 SHERM,

1454
01:30:08,637 --> 01:30:10,904
SHERM LEFT IT FOR HIM.

1455
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,939
YOU KNOW DAD,
HE NEVER TRUSTED BANKS.

1456
01:30:12,941 --> 01:30:15,142
             I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
             GOING ON WITH YOU,

1457
01:30:15,144 --> 01:30:16,910
             BUT I DON'T WANT
             YOUR MONEY.

1458
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:19,579
IT'S OUR MONEY.
IT WAS JIMMY'S MONEY,

1459
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:21,715
AND JIMMY LEFT IT FOR US.

1460
01:30:21,717 --> 01:30:23,150
               I DON'T BELIEVE
               THAT STORY,

1461
01:30:23,152 --> 01:30:25,152
               AND YOU SHOULD BE
               DISGUSTED

1462
01:30:25,154 --> 01:30:28,121
           THAT YOU MADE THAT UP
           ABOUT JIMMY.

1463
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:30,657
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE.

1464
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:32,592
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
TAKE THE MONEY?

1465
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:34,027
               NO, I WON'T,
               AND I DON'T WANT

1466
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:35,429
               TO TALK ABOUT IT
               ANYMORE.

1467
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:49,810
                SO, WHAT'S
                SO IMPORTANT,

1468
01:30:49,812 --> 01:30:51,711
            YOU COULDN'T TELL ME
            OVER THE PHONE?

1469
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:56,016
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR COMING OVER HERE DRUNK.

1470
01:30:56,018 --> 01:30:59,186
IT WAS DISRESPECTFUL,
AND I'M SORRY.

1471
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:03,557
                   GREAT.

1472
01:31:03,559 --> 01:31:06,059
                 IS THAT IT?

1473
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:08,228
     YEAH.

1474
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,464
  I MEAN...

1475
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:13,934
I REALLY LIKE YOU,
AND...

1476
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:17,604
I JUST WANTED TO
TELL YOU THIS IN PERSON.

1477
01:31:17,606 --> 01:31:19,706
              I REALLY LIKE YOU,
              TOO, VIAN.

1478
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,745
         I JUST DON'T THINK
         WE SHOULD DATE ANYMORE.

1479
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:29,015
               I THINK WE'RE
               REALLY DIFFERENT,

1480
01:31:29,017 --> 01:31:31,985
              AND I DON'T SEE
              HOW IT WOULD WORK.

1481
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:39,125
       OH.

1482
01:31:39,127 --> 01:31:41,928
      OKAY.

1483
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:46,099
WELL, THANKS FOR
SEEING ME IN PERSON.
