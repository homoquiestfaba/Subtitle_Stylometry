1
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,005
On your feet!

2
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,319
An American, Colonel.

3
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,655
He was at the gate, impersonating an officer.

4
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,329
You were alone?

5
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,792
Spy, you were alone?

6
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,460
I like to be alone.

7
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,547
What did you come here for?

8
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,800
You got a lot of nice stuff.

9
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,302
Other people's stuff.

10
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,055
"To the victor belongs the spoils."

11
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,516
"To the victor"?

12
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,019
Berlin's in rubble.

13
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,770
The Führer's in hiding.

14
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,732
You lost.

15
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,070
Take him upstairs.

16
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,572
What? What?

17
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,698
Hey!

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,866
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

19
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,409
A moment. Please!

20
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,703
Stop! I must speak to the commander.

21
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,830
Colonel. I found it!

22
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,292
Do as he says. Open it.

23
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,673
Doctor.

24
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,725
The Lance of Longinus.

25
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,562
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

26
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,689
The Holy Lance.

27
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,077
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

28
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,119
Colonel, we need to talk.

29
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,538
No time, Doctor.

30
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,081
The train to Berlin is waiting.

31
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,416
Search the woods!

32
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,543
Take the dogs.

33
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,003
Do you think that spy was alone?

34
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,130
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

35
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,173
On the double!

36
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,618
Looks like they're leaving without you guys.

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,038
Tell us your story, or die.

38
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,665
Story.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,835
Okay, okay.

40
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:30,961
Well...

41
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,422
it all started...

42
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:38,093
once upon a time,
when this village...

43
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:42,764
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together...

44
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,185
and follow this sweaty little pied piper
named Adolf...

45
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,331
No.

46
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,078
This man was with the American.

47
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,914
This is the American's bag.

48
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,750
What have I done?

49
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,715
Bring him to my carriage.

50
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,350
Careful. This is the Führer's special relic!

51
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,215
Stay seated.

52
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,425
So...

53
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,180
you are a birdwatcher?

54
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,810
Yes. Because of the bombing,

55
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,688
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

56
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,361
We caught your accomplice.

57
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,030
The American.

58
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,638
Oh, my!

59
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,124
Get off of me!

60
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,030
There's one reason you're still alive,
birdwatcher.

61
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,201
Who sent you?

62
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,577
What was your mission?

63
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,788
Please, Colonel, no. I beg you.

64
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,207
My name is Basil Shaw.

65
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,168
I'm a professor at Oxford.

66
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,962
An archeologist.

67
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,595
There you are.

68
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,810
There is a problem.

69
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,104
I must speak to the Colonel.

70
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,356
It's urgent.

71
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,694
I have a daughter. I beg you.

72
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,072
I guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr. Shaw.

73
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,328
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

74
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:05,022
We were told that the Lance of Longinus
could be found at the fortress.

75
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:06,857
We were looking for it.

76
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,901
Why?

77
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,445
Because of its power?

78
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,282
It has no power.

79
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,537
My friend and I were trying to save history.

80
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,666
I must speak with the Colonel.

81
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,002
It's about the Lance.

82
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,133
I only had a moment to look at it.

83
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,052
Of course, my training is in physics,

84
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,513
For God's sake, spit it out!

85
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,349
The Lance...

86
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,728
It's a fake.

87
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,188
It's a fake.

88
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:29,690
A fake?

89
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,485
The blade is an alloy.

90
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,070
Fifty years old,

91
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,364
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

92
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,490
We're dead.

93
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,620
Twelfth century. Thirteenth century.

94
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,956
Ramesses II.

95
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,084
None of this stuff is fake.

96
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,422
I gotta stop this train.

97
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,174
There is another relic on this train.

98
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,676
One with real power.

99
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,344
What are you talking about?

100
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,306
The Antikythera.

101
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:03,724
The Antikythera?!

102
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,893
Enough about that old dial!

103
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,312
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

104
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,105
and his mind!

105
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,650
Let me explain.

106
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,155
The Antikythera's power is not supernatural.

107
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,407
It is mathematics.

108
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,619
Whoever harnesses it...

109
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,289
will not be King...

110
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:28,999
nor Emperor...

111
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,585
or Führer.

112
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,924
He will be God.

113
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,944
Too many Nazis.

114
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,367
And how do you propose we tell him this?

115
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:04,868
My Führer,

116
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,454
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

117
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,956
But here is...

118
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,126
half of something you've never heard of.

119
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,587
Tell me,

120
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,548
have you ever MET HITLER?!!

121
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,218
A saboteur aboard.

122
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,719
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

123
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,345
That way!

124
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,267
What are you doing here?!

125
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,400
What the hell?

126
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,320
Indy?

127
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,321
Baz?

128
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:23,572
You're alive!

129
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,365
So far.

130
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,452
I thought I told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

131
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:32,664
What sort of a man hides in a hedge
while his friend is facing death?

132
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,556
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

133
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,768
I was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

134
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,853
Did you at least find the Lance?

135
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,147
-"At least"?
-Well, have you got it?

136
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,524
It's a fake.

137
00:14:58,649 --> 00:14:59,525
What?

138
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,527
A reproduction.

139
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,030
Who are you?

140
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,536
Indy?

141
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,879
The Antikythera.

142
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,757
Archimedes' Dial.

143
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,301
Bring it.

144
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,153
Hurry up, Baz.

145
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,491
Give me that.

146
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,742
Come on.

147
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,925
Get up, Baz.

148
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,385
Follow me.

149
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,345
Towards the gun?

150
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,763
Away from the Nazis!

151
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,141
Those are Nazis!

152
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,685
Get down! Down! Down!

153
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,152
This way. Come on!

154
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,654
I can't do that!

155
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,739
You wanna stop for a little lie-down?

156
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,911
They have the Antikythera!

157
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,413
Easy.

158
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,279
Tunnel!

159
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,624
Got you! No!

160
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,291
Indy!

161
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,550
Get the gun!

162
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,102
Shoot him!

163
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,106
Not me!

164
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,275
Sorry.

165
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,630
To the victor go the spoils.

166
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,329
Drop the gun.

167
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,584
Give me the Antikythera.

168
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,054
Indy!

169
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:32,816
Hey!

170
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,238
-Here!
-They can't hear you, Baz.

171
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,157
We gotta jump!

172
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,742
What about my dicky knee?

173
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:49,666
Baz!

174
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,585
Baz!

175
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,463
Baz!

176
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,508
-Indy!
-Baz!

177
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,223
Go! Move! Move it!

178
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,894
Bit rum to go home empty-handed
after all that.

179
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,729
"Empty-handed"?

180
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,189
Not exactly.

181
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,109
Archimedes' Dial.

182
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,319
Well, half of it.

183
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,696
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

184
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,681
Larry! Turn it down!

185
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:29,975
Turn it down!

186
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,977
Hey, Larry!

187
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:47,743
Larry!

188
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,078
Larry!

189
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:51,872
-Hi, Mr. Jones.
-Where's Larry?

190
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:53,916
Who is this guy?

191
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,167
It's the old guy next door.

192
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,002
Larry, it's 8:00 in the morning.

193
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,546
-"It's 8:00 in the morning."
-We talked about this, Larry.

194
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:00,631
Yeah, but that was...

195
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,258
-a workday, Mr. Jones.
-This is a workday too, Larry!

196
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,844
Turn on the news.

197
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,304
It's moon day, Mr. Jones.

198
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:09,723
Moon day?

199
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:03,944
Thanks.

200
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,293
All you really need to remember...

201
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:23,046
is that Assyrian ceramics of this period
are characterized...

202
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:27,176
by this complex blue-line pattern.

203
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:28,343
Okay?

204
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:32,848
I assigned pages 131 through 171...

205
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,641
in Winford for today.

206
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,310
Anybody do the reading?

207
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,646
Anyone?

208
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,443
Gosh, this is on the test.

209
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,861
Okay.

210
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,072
Guess I'll spoon-feed it to you.

211
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,494
In 213 BC...

212
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,705
Roman forces led by Marcellus...

213
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,708
laid siege to the city of Syracuse.

214
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,543
"Syracuse."

215
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,631
Not the Syracuse in New York, Tonya.

216
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,341
The one in Sicily.

217
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,511
Amongst the defenders of the city...

218
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,805
was its most famous resident, who was...

219
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,684
Come on, guys. This is on the final.

220
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:20,020
Archimedes.

221
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,939
Archimedes.

222
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,398
Archimedes, who was a...

223
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:24,691
A mathematician.

224
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,026
A mathematician.

225
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,779
But more than that, an inventor...

226
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:31,448
a brilliant engineer...

227
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:35,994
who conceived of a way to harness the energy
of the Mediterranean sun...

228
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,872
on concave mirrors and focus it...

229
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,667
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

230
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,295
Who devised giant iron claws...

231
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,090
that could snatch hostiles from the sea.

232
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:53,512
But how do we know it really happened?

233
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,684
What physical, irrefutable
archeological evidence...

234
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:02,145
-is there of these inventions?
-The Antikythera.

235
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,732
-The Antikythera.
-For starters.

236
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,901
They're here! They're downtown!

237
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,196
The astronauts.

238
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,657
Giant parade this morning will be seen...

239
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:16,952
by about two and a half million people
lining the sidewalks...

240
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:21,415
He's coming. He's come. See?

241
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh, here he comes.

242
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,002
Hide the cake.

243
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,797
-Surprise.
-Surprise!

244
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,094
For over a decade now...

245
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:38,724
our colleague Dr. Jones has been
a loyal servant of Hunter.

246
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:41,727
A token of our gratitude.

247
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,027
Wow.

248
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,283
Thanks for putting up with me.

249
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:11,548
Here.

250
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:23,310
Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,
and Buzz Aldrin...

251
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,437
will not be able to avoid the spotlight.

252
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:29,316
At 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
a grateful nation will pay homage...

253
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:32,110
with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago...

254
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,820
climaxed by a dinner in Los Angeles...

255
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:35,239
What would the ancients say?

256
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:37,533
Neil, Buzz, and Mike...

257
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,410
If they knew we walked on the moon?

258
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,162
Speaking as an ancient...

259
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,831
going to the moon is like going to Reno.

260
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,291
Middle of nowhere...

261
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,961
and no blackjack.

262
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,547
You don't recognize me, do you?

263
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,968
Whatever I did, I apologize.

264
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:57,970
It's Helena.

265
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:00,597
Helena Shaw.

266
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,642
Wombat?

267
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,435
Wow, I haven't heard that in a while.

268
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,729
-You got tall.
-I did.

269
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,231
It's fair to say.

270
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,401
I'm celebrating.

271
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,696
-I'm retiring.
-Oh.

272
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,698
Wow.
Well, in that case, what are we drinking?

273
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,913
Room service for Mr. Schmidt.

274
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:38,385
Put that away.

275
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,387
I was asking how you broke your ankle.

276
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,139
None of your business.

277
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:43,223
Are you Mr. Schmidt?

278
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,475
"Doctor" Schmidt. He's in there.

279
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,437
And he don't eat anything on wheels,
so put it on a table.

280
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,190
When I was a little boy...

281
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,900
I always imagined...

282
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,737
that one day man would walk on the moon.

283
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,363
And by golly...

284
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,705
Quite a celebration out there.

285
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,627
The man you're servin'...

286
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,087
he's the one who put those astronauts
on the moon.

287
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,297
Built the rockets they rode in.

288
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,008
Congratulations.

289
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:19,259
Where are you from?

290
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:21,178
The Bronx, sir.

291
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,305
No, no. I mean originally, your people.

292
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,389
Do you know?

293
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,729
I was born by Yankee Stadium, sir.

294
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,192
And you fought for your country?

295
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:37,569
320th Battalion.

296
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,113
Set up balloons to stop the planes
bombing Normandy.

297
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,412
And are you enjoying your victory?

298
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:56,380
Will there be anything else?

299
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,092
You didn't win the war.

300
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,928
Hitler lost it.

301
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,351
Yeah.

302
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:13,355
My field agent, she found Shaw.

303
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,482
Yeah, I'm comin'.

304
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:16,650
Let's go, Hauke.

305
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,321
Where are we here?

306
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,324
Oxford. In the garden.

307
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,452
He was an original.

308
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:31,290
I just graduated.

309
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:32,416
In Archeology.

310
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,502
Archeology. Wow.

311
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,296
Apple didn't fall far.

312
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:40,174
Well, now I'm researching a doctorate.

313
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:42,384
What's your subject?

314
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,179
The Archimedes Dial.

315
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,264
The Antikythera.

316
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,518
What do you know about that?

317
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,395
Well, for starters...

318
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,982
in 1902, Greek sponge divers found
a wrecked Roman warship...

319
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:58,442
huge, off the coast of Greece.

320
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,819
Below deck, sealed in wax...

321
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,487
was a clock-like mechanism...

322
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:05,490
finely tooled, purpose unknown.

323
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:09,620
Nothing approximating its complexity appears
in the world for 1,000 years.

324
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,873
-You've done your homework.
-Well, not me.

325
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:16,084
Dad. He had all these journals,
reams of notes about it.

326
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,086
He was obsessed till the end.

327
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,926
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

328
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:28,472
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

329
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:32,476
Well, that was a long time ago.

330
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:34,061
And it was only half the Dial.

331
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:35,729
-Archimedes...
-Archimedes broke the Dial in two...

332
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:36,855
-...disassembled it.
-...and then hid...

333
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,066
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

334
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,484
I know. Look.

335
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,445
You don't remember the last time I saw you,
do you?

336
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,198
Remember what?

337
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,282
These are the Alps.

338
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,327
Yeah, I see.

339
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,371
And this is the route that your train took...

340
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:54,498
-from the Nazi stronghold in '44.
-Right.

341
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,458
It went through this mountain pass...

342
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,085
and then here.

343
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,504
-Here, it's the only river on the route.
-Right.

344
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:01,713
Under a bridge.

345
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,257
It's down there. It's got to be.

346
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,843
-And nobody knows except us.
-"Us"?

347
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,636
Well, I mean, you.

348
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:09,346
And me. So, yeah.

349
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:11,348
-Us.
-Us.

350
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,852
And what were you thinking exactly?

351
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:17,437
Well, that maybe...

352
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,732
we could go there.

353
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:21,942
And?

354
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,277
And find it.

355
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,779
And I'd become...

356
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:28,574
famous.

357
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,033
Oh, well, not famous.

358
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,034
Renowned. Feted.

359
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,412
A feted archeologist.

360
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,330
And you, a final triumph!

361
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,415
Indiana Jones!

362
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,584
Out with a bang! Back in the saddle!

363
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,130
I'm not selling this, am I?

364
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:46,758
Wombat...

365
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,762
why are you chasing the thing...

366
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:54,600
that drove your father crazy?

367
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:01,982
Wouldn't you?

368
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,168
I got it.

369
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,294
Parade's comin' soon.

370
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:24,338
So, what we got?

371
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,467
She's in there, third floor, with an old guy.

372
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:29,718
Who is he, a Russian?

373
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:31,803
No, a professor. Dr. Henry Jones.

374
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:33,889
Klaber!

375
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,558
Klaber, get back here! You're not an agent!

376
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,935
Goddammit!
Go.

377
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:40,729
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

378
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,668
This way.

379
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:41,874
Basil became obsessed by this German theory.

380
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,751
Conjecture, really.

381
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,673
Archimedes had figured out...

382
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:52,009
that the movements of the moon and planets...

383
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:54,094
weren't perfect.

384
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,890
There were irregularities in their rotations.

385
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,351
He thought these irregularities might...

386
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:04,897
explain fluctuations in temperature, tides.

387
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:08,358
Storms, even.

388
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,613
So, he set about building a device
to predict them.

389
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:18,202
But then, he stumbled upon a method
to predict even larger...

390
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:19,912
disturbances.

391
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,248
Larger disturbances?

392
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:26,084
Your father thought this thing could...

393
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:29,046
predict fissures in time.

394
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:47,606
Hauke, if you don't...

395
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,068
Found 'em.

396
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:00,661
Hello.

397
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,039
Are you looking for...

398
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,457
Dr. Jones?

399
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,337
Excuse me, can I help you?

400
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:11,839
No, thank you.

401
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,757
Just a routine investigation, ma'am.

402
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,302
Are you the police?

403
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:18,762
It'll just be a few moments.

404
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,764
-Professor Plimpton.
-Ma'am.

405
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,099
-Professor Plimpton!
-Ma'am!

406
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:27,521
Drop your weapon.

407
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:28,814
What the hell are you doin'?

408
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,192
What the doctor tells me, Miss Mason.

409
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:33,277
Mandy?

410
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,075
Yeah, no witnesses.

411
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:46,540
Jesus. What the hell?

412
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,127
Your father wrote so many letters
about the Dial, I stopped reading 'em.

413
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:55,924
You really don't remember the last time
I was at your house?

414
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,845
I took that from him then.

415
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,140
I thought he'd stopped thinking about it.

416
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:07,186
But your father was convinced this thing
was real and dangerous.

417
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,354
Do not shoot.

418
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,150
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

419
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:14,484
the Grafikos...

420
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,778
The tablet containing directions
to the rest of the Dial.

421
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,030
And if they found the Grafikos...

422
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:19,823
they might acquire the other half
of the Dial...

423
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:20,824
and put the two together.

424
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:23,702
I knew you wouldn't destroy it.

425
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,124
How did you know he asked me to destroy it?

426
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:30,459
What?

427
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:32,002
You do remember that night.

428
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,173
-I was 12 years old, Indy.
-You knew we didn't drop it in a river.

429
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,091
Baz didn't tell you that.

430
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,260
-See, listen. I didn't...
-No, he never lied.

431
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:43,138
-No. You...
-What was all that crap about the map?

432
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,431
No, you've had too many whiskeys.

433
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:46,141
What are you doing, Wombat?

434
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,559
Stay where you are.

435
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:49,895
Don't move.

436
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,105
-Who are these people?
-We need to get out of here.

437
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:53,106
Are they with you?

438
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:54,441
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

439
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:56,777
Miss Shaw, stop!

440
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:00,948
Helena!

441
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:07,204
Stop!

442
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:10,207
Sorry.

443
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:11,208
Helena!

444
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,210
Dr. Jones. It's over.

445
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:14,670
Who are you people?

446
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:15,921
What do you want?

447
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:18,757
Stop!

448
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:21,718
Helena Shaw!

449
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,136
She's on the roof. Find another way up.

450
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:24,137
Dr. Jones!

451
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,348
Dr. Jones, we're not gonna hurt you.

452
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,377
-Move. We gotta follow 'em.
-Go. Hurry up.

453
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:23,822
Fan out!

454
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,338
-Let's go. Move, move, move! Pack it up!
-Come on. Get everything.

455
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:40,631
Found her!

456
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:11,370
-Operator.
-I need the police.

457
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,872
Hunter College. People are dead.

458
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,040
-Please...
-Hang up, fella.

459
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:21,922
Stand up.

460
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:28,470
Okay, okay.

461
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:54,413
She's gone. You blew it...

462
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:55,831
you trigger-happy cracker.

463
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:58,458
-She had it in her hand.
-We got the professor.

464
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,172
Here's the file on Jones.

465
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,256
Yes.

466
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:23,650
Who are you?

467
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,194
That's my question.

468
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,206
You're CIA.

469
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:39,124
Oh, not me, man.

470
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,251
I don't take government jobs.

471
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,252
Okay.

472
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,964
How are you acquainted with Miss Shaw?

473
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,633
She's my goddaughter.

474
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:49,968
I haven't seen her in 18 years.

475
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:52,262
Why did you meet with her today?
To give her the Dial?

476
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:56,141
Lady, it's an ancient hunk of gears.

477
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:58,101
Half a hunk.

478
00:41:58,227 --> 00:41:59,978
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

479
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:02,731
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

480
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,149
Where do you think you're going?

481
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:05,692
I got a parade going on.

482
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,319
And a demonstration coming down here.

483
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:08,529
Hey! Hey, hey!

484
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,239
-Hey...
-Shut up.

485
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,824
I can't go this way. Gotta go back.

486
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,540
Hell no! What is wrong with you, man?

487
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,333
Damn it!
Let's go on foot.

488
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,334
You heard her.

489
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,295
What the hell were you thinking?

490
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,755
-Walk! Come on.
-What is your problem?

491
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:28,423
-You don't look when you're backin' up?
-Take care of that guy.

492
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:29,383
Who's gonna pay for that?

493
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:30,717
Easy, fella. Easy.

494
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:31,635
Keep movin'.

495
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:33,512
Can't you see my cab? It's yellow.

496
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,722
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man. I don't...

497
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:40,519
Peace now! Peace now!

498
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,815
Stop the war! Stop the fighting!

499
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:46,733
-Where are we going, Mason?
-This way.

500
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,320
-Hell no, we won't go.
-Shut up.

501
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:51,947
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no!

502
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,825
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no, we won't go!

503
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:55,868
We won't go!

504
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,412
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no, we won't go!

505
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:00,414
-Hell no...
-Shut up!

506
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:01,582
Hell yeah!

507
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:12,593
Hell no...

508
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:24,396
Hey!

509
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:27,274
Officer! Help me!

510
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:29,568
Officer, there was a shooting...

511
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:31,570
-All right, all right.
-...this morning at Hunter.

512
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:33,447
People are dead. God damn it.

513
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:37,034
-Some rogue maniacs broke in and...
-Sir, you need to calm it down.

514
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:38,327
Please listen to me.

515
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:40,621
There was a shooting this morning, and the...

516
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:44,249
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

517
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:48,462
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

518
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,017
-Watch out!
-What's he doin'?

519
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:23,914
You did it!

520
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,234
Move, out the way!

521
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:01,243
Watch out!

522
00:45:03,537 --> 00:45:04,705
Move! Quickly!

523
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:20,387
Move! Move!

524
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,316
Go, go, go!

525
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:55,631
Come on. That's ridiculous. It's a horse.

526
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:56,632
Come on!

527
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,011
-Hey, mister.
-Move! Out of the way!

528
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:02,179
Hold my horse.

529
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:03,388
Move! Move!

530
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:06,350
Transfer is available
for IND Queens Boulevard.

531
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:18,779
Next stop, 59th, Lexington Avenue.

532
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:21,949
Subway is faster.

533
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:27,246
People tend to romanticize science,
when it is, in fact, quite cold.

534
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:28,956
So, what's next, Dr. Schmidt?

535
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:30,999
Mars?

536
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,377
No, we've conquered space.

537
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:36,880
I'm moving to the next frontier.

538
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:40,759
What's beyond space?

539
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:47,391
You might wanna get that suit pressed,
Dr. Schmidt.

540
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:49,601
We leave for the airport in an hour.

541
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,144
He's gonna meet the President.

542
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,729
If the President objects to a few creases...

543
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,232
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

544
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:58,068
-Can I use that?
-No.

545
00:46:58,443 --> 00:46:59,278
Yes.

546
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:01,780
Baxter.

547
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:06,910
It's for you, Doctor.

548
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,708
I may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

549
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,169
I'm expecting a delivery shortly.

550
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,256
Speak.

551
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,841
Your goons made a mess.

552
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:22,259
Did they?

553
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:24,761
Miss Shaw met with a professor. Jones.

554
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,222
She acquired the device from him.

555
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:29,183
Then we lost her.

556
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:32,519
Dr. Jones got away as well.

557
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:34,104
Is that so?

558
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:35,606
Most unfortunate.

559
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:37,524
I gotta clean things up here, Doctor.

560
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:40,027
And as a representative
of the United States government...

561
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:41,862
I urge you to cooperate.

562
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,280
Get on that plane to Los Angeles...

563
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:45,449
and get your medal from the President.

564
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,832
Hello?

565
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,793
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

566
00:47:58,212 --> 00:47:59,129
To Morocco.

567
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:00,464
Yes, sir.

568
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:04,551
The university murders took place
at the height of the parade.

569
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,222
Police are searching for retired professor
Dr. Henry Jones.

570
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:11,391
A colleague told ABC
that Jones recently lost his son...

571
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,519
and was in the middle of a divorce.

572
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:18,899
This guy, he looks like you.

573
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:22,277
Nah. No.

574
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,239
It is you.

575
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:26,240
No, no, no. Hey.

576
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:27,908
-Go home, pal. You're drunk.
-This is the guy!

577
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,368
-Hey!
-It's the killer!

578
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,455
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

579
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,082
Bridge traffic.

580
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:48,095
Boy, am I glad to see you, Sallah.

581
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:50,931
I wish I could say the same, old friend.

582
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,186
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

583
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:02,276
Your goddaughter, Helena...

584
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:05,070
was arrested in Tangier last year...

585
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:07,948
for auctioning contraband.

586
00:49:10,492 --> 00:49:11,410
There's more.

587
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:15,998
She was bailed out by Aziz Rahim.

588
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:19,543
Aziz Rahim is the son of Big Rahim...

589
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,504
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

590
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:27,676
Big Rahim owns the Hotel Atlantique...

591
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:30,512
in Tangier, and this week...

592
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:34,766
the hotel is hosting its annual auction...

593
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:36,810
of stolen antiquities.

594
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:40,480
All the big players are already there.

595
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:42,441
Alia, Jabari.

596
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:46,737
This is the great man who brought our family
to America during the war.

597
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:49,364
Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?

598
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,825
1956.

599
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:53,702
Very impressive, Jabari.

600
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,330
My grandchildren watch too much TV...

601
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:58,957
but they know their history.

602
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:03,295
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

603
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:06,340
I need a ride to the airport, Sallah.

604
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:09,927
If you run, the police will assume
that you're guilty.

605
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:13,931
Without Helena or the Dial,
I'm gonna get framed for murder.

606
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:16,725
Have you thought about calling Marion?

607
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:19,186
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

608
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,946
Welcome to New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport.

609
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,074
The upper level is for Pan American Airlines
passenger drop off only.

610
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:34,076
I took something else from your apartment.

611
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:35,452
It was under the bed.

612
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:41,667
Thanks, Sallah.

613
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:45,754
I also brought my passport.

614
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:48,966
I could help you.

615
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:50,050
In Tangier?

616
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:51,885
Wherever chance takes us.

617
00:50:52,803 --> 00:50:53,887
Indy, I...

618
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,265
I miss the desert.

619
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:58,183
I miss the sea.

620
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:01,478
And I miss waking up every morning...

621
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:04,731
wondering what wonderful adventure
the new day will bring to us.

622
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:07,734
This is not an adventure, Sallah.

623
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:11,780
Those days have come and gone.

624
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:12,948
Perhaps.

625
00:51:13,156 --> 00:51:14,533
Perhaps not.

626
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:21,582
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

627
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:34,011
Champagne?

628
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:36,555
We've got four more hours to Tangier.

629
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:45,689
Your scotch, sir.

630
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:47,357
Thanks.

631
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:55,657
Basil. Come on, Baz!

632
00:51:55,741 --> 00:51:57,576
-Open the door!
-No!

633
00:51:57,743 --> 00:51:59,203
-Stay out, Indy!
-Open the door.

634
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,291
The Germans were right, Indy.

635
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,752
-What?
-It's too big. It's too much.

636
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:07,753
Hey, Ba...
Hey, hey!

637
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,713
-Hey, Baz! Give me...
-No.

638
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,965
-What are you doing?
-You've listened to nothing that I said.

639
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:13,884
I don't understand it, Baz!

640
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:16,261
Well, I was trying to explain it
to you downstairs.

641
00:52:16,428 --> 00:52:18,680
-You've just ignored everything.
-You're terrifying your daughter.

642
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:22,893
Indy, Archimedes...

643
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,312
discovered a temporal meteorology.

644
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:28,106
Archimedes was a mathematician, Baz...

645
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:29,525
not a magician.

646
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:32,152
He could predict fissures in time.

647
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,862
Fissures in time?

648
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,324
-Baz, you can't prove that!
-Well, not yet.

649
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:39,368
Proving it is what makes it science!

650
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:55,801
Oh, Baz.

651
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:59,054
I never should've given you the thing.

652
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,306
It belongs in a museum.

653
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:03,851
Give it to me. Please.

654
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:08,814
If I give you this...

655
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:11,567
it must be destroyed.

656
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:13,902
I will.

657
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,115
I'll destroy it, Baz.

658
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:21,660
Promise.

659
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,334
I'm sorry about this.

660
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:30,669
It's all my fault.

661
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:34,256
-Are you gonna be here?
-Yes, sir.

662
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:36,550
Okay. I've gotta catch an airplane.

663
00:53:36,717 --> 00:53:39,511
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

664
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:40,971
Some things should stay buried.

665
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:41,889
I know, Baz.

666
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:43,849
-It's vital that you destroy it.
-I will, Baz.

667
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:45,392
-Do you understand?
-I'll destroy it.

668
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,310
-Say you will, Indy.
-Yes.

669
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:47,477
I will... Yes.

670
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,229
You promised me. Remember that.

671
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:50,397
I will... I promise.

672
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:51,440
There's a reason...

673
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:54,193
a reason that Archimedes broke it in two.

674
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,028
I know, Baz.

675
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:57,070
Indy.

676
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:00,449
Thanks, Wombat.

677
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:02,576
He's gonna be all right in a few days.

678
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,038
I'll call you as soon as I land.

679
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:12,377
Ladies and gentlemen...

680
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:15,005
we are 20 minutes from landing in Tangier.

681
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:50,123
-Stop drinking!
-What are you doing?

682
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,917
No more champagne! How many more...

683
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:52,960
I'm staying.

684
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:54,628
Go home. Go home!

685
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:13,647
Miss Shaw, she's here.

686
00:55:17,943 --> 00:55:18,777
Forged in bronze.

687
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,153
Nearly complete.

688
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,989
It is an astrological clock.

689
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,825
Dating third century BC...

690
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:28,871
and built by Archimedes himself.

691
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,332
All right, let's start at 20,000.

692
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:33,625
20,000, thank you very much.

693
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,043
30. 30.

694
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:36,128
Gauges green...

695
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:37,921
power full...

696
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,382
and when I reach 85, I rotate.

697
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:41,925
What next?

698
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:44,094
-Louis, help him! He's so cute.
-Pull back on the yoke.

699
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:46,513
-I did, man. I'm airborne.
-Yeah, he's airborne.

700
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:47,931
-Can I have a sip?
-Do I pick up the flaps?

701
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:50,058
Don't touch the flaps under 400 feet.

702
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,935
Decrease your pitch to get to 120.

703
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,061
All right.

704
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,900
-Private auction, old timer.
-I've gotta get in there.

705
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:00,611
No password, no entry.
I don't make the rules.

706
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:05,115
-And what is the current bid?
-The bid is 50,000.

707
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:06,617
Then I bid 55.

708
00:56:07,576 --> 00:56:08,535
-Who'll give me 60?
-60.

709
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:10,162
60. 65?

710
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:11,538
-65. 70?
-75.

711
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:12,998
-75. 80?
-80.

712
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:14,750
-85.
-How about 90?

713
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:22,633
This auction is private.

714
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:24,009
This auction's over.

715
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:25,761
Au contraire, it's hardly begun.

716
00:56:25,886 --> 00:56:27,262
-100.
-100,000.

717
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,014
I like the hat, by the way.

718
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:30,390
Makes you look at least two years younger.

719
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:31,725
Thanks.

720
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:33,393
-110, bravo.
-I told you that this auction is over.

721
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:34,937
Excuse me, who is this man?

722
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,396
-I'm her godfather.
-He's mildly related.

723
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:38,524
And she's up past her bedtime.

724
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,942
-Come on, Wombat.
-I wouldn't do that.

725
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,568
You want to explain it to the cops
at the bar?

726
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:43,070
The ones I paid off?

727
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:45,197
You're out of your depth, Jonesy.

728
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:46,698
-"Jonesy"?
-He thinks I'm a criminal.

729
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:48,659
He's the one wanted for murder.

730
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:50,827
Nice big picture in the New York Herald. 130?

731
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:52,663
I didn't kill anyone.

732
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:54,623
-No entry, it's a private auction.
-And you know it, Helena.

733
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:58,669
But whoever did was looking for this.

734
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:01,171
What you've got here is Pandora's Box.

735
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:03,632
No, actually.

736
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:06,009
It's my box.

737
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:09,596
You.

738
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:12,432
Have we met?

739
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:13,642
No.

740
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,102
My memory is a little fuzzy...

741
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,020
but your face rings a bell.

742
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:18,730
Are you still a Nazi?

743
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:24,987
You're confused. My name is Schmidt.

744
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:27,698
Professor Schmidt of Alabama University.

745
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:30,325
Professor Schmidt.

746
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:31,743
How nice to meet you in person.

747
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:34,496
-150.
-After our conversation, Miss Shaw...

748
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:36,665
I thought we'd come to an agreement
about the Dial.

749
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,001
Funny. The last time I saw the other guy
who looks like you...

750
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:40,919
he was also after this.

751
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:43,088
Your numbers were light, Professor Schmidt.

752
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:44,339
But good news is, you're here now.

753
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:47,050
-The bid is 160.
-You don't seem to understand, Miss Shaw.

754
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:48,385
This relic is my property.

755
00:57:48,594 --> 00:57:50,137
It's not yours. You stole it.

756
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:51,054
Then you stole it.

757
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,764
And then I stole it.
It's called capitalism.

758
00:57:52,973 --> 00:57:53,807
The bid is 160.

759
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:54,850
-160.
-170?

760
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:56,018
You should've stayed in New York.

761
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:58,020
-170?
-You should've stayed out of Poland.

762
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:00,022
170. Anyone? Anyone?

763
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:01,481
Going, going...

764
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:02,858
Gone!

765
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:04,484
Stay away!

766
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:07,196
Get the Dial.

767
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:12,951
Stay away!

768
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:23,170
Oh, hello, Claude.

769
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:24,671
You should not have come back, Helena.

770
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:35,098
Get back.

771
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:46,777
Teddy!

772
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:02,251
Rahim says you stay.

773
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:15,097
Thank you.

774
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,611
See you in the past, Dr. Jones.

775
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,413
Move! Get out of the way!

776
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:57,723
It's my cab!

777
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,438
Tell them to back off.

778
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:05,981
I just told them to shoot you.

779
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:09,234
All right, guys.

780
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:12,070
Put the guns down.

781
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:13,363
Put 'em down.

782
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,325
All right.

783
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:19,369
That's better.

784
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:24,833
Oh, dear.

785
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:36,053
Rahim.

786
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:38,555
You're in pajamas.

787
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,849
I was sleeping, Helena.

788
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:42,226
Peacefully.

789
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:44,978
Then my father woke me.

790
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:47,689
He told me you'd returned to our hotel.

791
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,485
Then he handed me this scimitar...

792
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:54,488
and told me to come home with your head.

793
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:57,616
Does it have to be that bit?

794
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:08,210
I thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

795
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:09,419
Rahim...

796
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:11,797
I had an item to sell.

797
01:01:11,964 --> 01:01:13,841
Excuse me. The item she's talking about...

798
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:15,634
-actually belongs to me.
-No. You do not need to...

799
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:16,885
-And some very bad people...
-...intrude in this conversation.

800
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:19,179
-...worse people, have run off with it.
-You do not need to get involved...

801
01:01:19,346 --> 01:01:20,264
-with my business.
-Is this your new man?

802
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:21,723
-No. No, no.
-It's complicated.

803
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:25,018
What exactly do you owe this guy?

804
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,229
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

805
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:29,106
I presume you sold the ring.

806
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:30,524
It didn't go for as much
as I thought it would.

807
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:32,109
I'll do it!

808
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:33,318
What are you... Hey!

809
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:41,076
You just got me killed!

810
01:01:41,285 --> 01:01:43,829
Well, I'm not the one that's engaged
to a mobster!

811
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:46,957
I don't need morality lessons
from an aging grave robber!

812
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:48,292
I'm not a grave robber.

813
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,752
Your father and I
did important work together.

814
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:55,340
Don't tell me all your escapades were noble,
selfless quests.

815
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:56,383
You did it for the buzz!

816
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:00,220
Oh, good work, Teddy!

817
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:03,390
-Move over, kid.
-Hey!

818
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:15,986
-Helena!
-Back up! Back up!

819
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:34,546
Not this way!

820
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:36,006
You don't know where you're going, Indy!

821
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:38,050
-Listen to him. He knows this town!
-I know Tangier!

822
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:43,514
There he is!

823
01:02:48,644 --> 01:02:50,771
Faster. Go faster!

824
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:52,940
Ten minutes to the airport, boss.

825
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,611
I'm not sure Professor Schmidt
is an actual professor, by the way.

826
01:02:57,778 --> 01:02:58,904
-He's a Nazi!
-Turn left!

827
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,614
Turn left! Turn left!

828
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:01,865
-Oh, no!
-No!

829
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:18,507
Helena! Don't do this!

830
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:28,058
-Hey, this way!
-That way!

831
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:29,810
No!

832
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:32,437
Helena!

833
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:35,440
No!

834
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,743
What the hell?

835
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,585
Helena!

836
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:57,421
Hey!

837
01:03:57,546 --> 01:03:58,463
Hey!

838
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:00,090
What the hell?

839
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:04,428
Come on!

840
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:10,017
Come on. Come on!

841
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:46,512
You think he'd be proud of this?

842
01:04:46,637 --> 01:04:47,554
Who?

843
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:50,224
Your father!

844
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,310
His only daughter selling her soul
for bail money!

845
01:04:53,477 --> 01:04:54,770
Sounds quite cool when you put it like that.

846
01:04:54,937 --> 01:04:56,605
And it's not all bail money.

847
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,066
-Some of it's gambling debt and some...
-Thank you, Teddy.

848
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,901
Helena!
No!

849
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:02,110
Helena!

850
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,697
How did you end up like this?

851
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:07,199
Well, you mean resourceful?

852
01:05:07,366 --> 01:05:09,660
Daring? Beautiful? Self-sufficient?

853
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:35,853
Hold on!

854
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:40,566
Go this way!

855
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:50,951
There he is.

856
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:06,008
-Stop! Stop!
-Hey! Hey!

857
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:19,938
On the left!

858
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:22,065
Take the wheel, Teddy!

859
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:25,360
What are you doing?

860
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:27,029
Getting what's mine.

861
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:28,947
Helena!

862
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:34,745
Damn it! You crazy?

863
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:39,291
Hey! Helena!

864
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:44,880
-Take the gun!
-Miss Shaw.

865
01:06:46,298 --> 01:06:47,966
Let go, Miss Shaw!

866
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:11,698
Let go.

867
01:07:11,907 --> 01:07:14,326
Come on! Give me the Dial!

868
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:17,079
Helena!

869
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:19,873
Damn.

870
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:28,799
-Turn back! They went that way!
-He's gone!

871
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:30,801
-Move over!
-Hey!

872
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:37,307
I didn't come here to rescue you
from your fiancé!

873
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:38,308
Rescue me?

874
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,023
I just want the Dial back.

875
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:06,003
Put your hands above your head.

876
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:08,714
Not the smoothest break-up I ever had.

877
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:11,049
-If your father was still alive...
-Well, he's not, Indy.

878
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,718
Hey, something's wrong with the engine.

879
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:14,845
If only there'd been someone there for me,
some father figure...

880
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,848
someone specifically anointed for the job.

881
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:20,267
-You have no idea about the kind...
-Don't beat yourself up about it.

882
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:22,519
I mean, what even is a godfather?

883
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,564
Anyway, family never was your strong suit.

884
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:28,567
-What is the time, by the way?
-It's...

885
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:29,735
Hey, no fair.

886
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:31,445
Give me that back.

887
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,738
That was my father's watch!

888
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:36,158
Give it back to him.

889
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:42,039
You're gonna have to leave town with me.

890
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:43,790
Rahim will be looking for you too.

891
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:45,083
They'll go to Tangier airport first...

892
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:47,461
so we'll need to catch a train
and get a plane from Casablanca.

893
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:50,547
What was that?

894
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:56,637
Damn.

895
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:00,098
Yeah.

896
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:01,141
I know, sir.

897
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:04,478
Yes...

898
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:06,813
Copy.

899
01:09:11,902 --> 01:09:13,028
They pulled the plug.

900
01:09:13,278 --> 01:09:14,655
You got them scared.

901
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,698
-Because they don't understand.
-No.

902
01:09:16,823 --> 01:09:19,326
Because your associates killed
three American civilians...

903
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:21,703
and blew up a nationally televised parade.

904
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:24,790
Because you stood up
the President of the United States...

905
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:26,124
ran to Morocco...

906
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,752
and created an incident
that required military extraction!

907
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:32,589
Then take me to DC,
and I will explain it all.

908
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:34,049
They want you to vanish.

909
01:09:34,174 --> 01:09:36,343
We have half the Dial now.

910
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,845
They were just trying to keep you happy...

911
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:40,514
letting you chase that thing.

912
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:41,849
They never cared about it.

913
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:44,601
They will, Miss Mason,
when they understand what it can do.

914
01:09:44,768 --> 01:09:45,853
You put them on the moon.

915
01:09:46,603 --> 01:09:47,813
They got what they wanted.

916
01:09:49,106 --> 01:09:51,024
All right, buckle up. We're landing in Spain.

917
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:53,735
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

918
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:55,320
I'm not going back to Alabama!

919
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:57,781
All we need is a vessel to take us
to the Mediterranean.

920
01:09:58,407 --> 01:09:59,825
The Grafikos will take us to the other...

921
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,994
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

922
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,203
Let go of me, Schmidt.

923
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:04,997
I'm asking you personally.

924
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:07,374
You're a piece of work, Doc.

925
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:09,835
Hey!

926
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:39,448
Schmidt...

927
01:10:40,324 --> 01:10:41,909
My name is Voller.

928
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:46,079
Jürgen Voller.

929
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,178
That's a Sea Stallion.

930
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:02,763
American helicopter.

931
01:11:03,764 --> 01:11:05,516
Did you know the Wright Brothers?

932
01:11:05,891 --> 01:11:07,434
-What?
-The Wright Brothers.

933
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:08,685
Orville and Wilbur.

934
01:11:08,852 --> 01:11:11,063
They invented the airplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

935
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:12,814
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

936
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,317
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

937
01:11:15,526 --> 01:11:18,070
And the Wright Brothers were born
during the Civil War.

938
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:20,364
Oh, I thought maybe you went to school
with them.

939
01:11:21,782 --> 01:11:24,243
Oh, come on, Indy. That was funny.

940
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:25,244
"Funny"?

941
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:30,040
I'm stuck in Tangier with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

942
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:31,458
I'm wanted for murder.

943
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:33,585
Nazis have half of Archimedes' Dial...

944
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:35,087
and your father's notebooks.

945
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:37,506
I have a copy.

946
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:39,800
Dad's notebooks. I made a copy.

947
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:40,843
Where?

948
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,846
You memorized five notebooks?

949
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:45,222
Seven. And of course not.

950
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:46,974
Half of them were as dull as ditchwater.

951
01:11:47,891 --> 01:11:50,310
Just the really important bits.

952
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:52,145
Like what?

953
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:53,814
The location of the Grafikos.

954
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:55,691
Nobody knows where the Grafikos is.

955
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:57,109
-Dad did.
-No, he didn't.

956
01:11:57,276 --> 01:11:58,527
-Yes, he did.
-No, he didn't.

957
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:00,237
-Yes, he did.
-What's a Grafikos?

958
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:01,780
It's directions to the rest of the Dial.

959
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:03,490
Ask her if she knows what language it's in.

960
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:05,492
It isn't in a language. It's in a code.

961
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:06,910
What code?

962
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:08,495
Archimedes used two codes.

963
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:10,205
Linear B and Polybius Square.

964
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:13,750
So, even if you find the Grafikos,
without me, you can't read it.

965
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:15,586
Please.

966
01:12:15,711 --> 01:12:17,588
Dad taught me Polybius when I was nine.

967
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,256
Used to leave little notes around the house.

968
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:20,340
"Tidy your room."

969
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:21,884
"Stay away from my brandy."

970
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,011
What if it's Linear B?

971
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:26,305
50 quid it's Polybius.

972
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:28,515
Give me that.

973
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:29,600
Hey.

974
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,226
That won't work.

975
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,645
Moroccan chewing gum's made from the sap
of the Manilkara.

976
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:35,105
Heat resistant.

977
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,816
Try and start it.

978
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:43,906
-Start it.
-I am.

979
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:47,618
Huh? Huh?

980
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:49,912
-Huh?
-It won't hold.

981
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:51,997
It'll get us to the train station.

982
01:12:52,122 --> 01:12:53,248
"Us"?

983
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:54,625
-You goin' home?
-No.

984
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:56,585
I'm going to Casablanca.

985
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,545
Then I'm gonna hop a plane to the Aegean.

986
01:12:58,712 --> 01:12:59,588
Just like you.

987
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:01,590
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

988
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:04,801
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

989
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,012
Archimedes was surrounded by Romans.

990
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:08,972
Where else would it be?

991
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:10,098
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

992
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:11,391
And you don't have coordinates.

993
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:13,101
And you don't have a boat.

994
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:18,440
I've got an old friend in Greece.

995
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:20,067
An expert diver.

996
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:22,069
With a big, beautiful boat...

997
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,238
that'll get us there before they will.

998
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,157
You need me...

999
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:28,575
and you know it.

1000
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:19,877
Renny!

1001
01:14:21,962 --> 01:14:22,880
Indy?

1002
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:24,923
Indy!

1003
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:32,264
So, that's the expert diver?

1004
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:34,683
Spain's greatest frogman.

1005
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:38,478
Hey!

1006
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:42,065
So, Spain's greatest frogman has a shit boat
and only one good frog leg?

1007
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:43,317
Stop it.

1008
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:48,447
You got a different boat.

1009
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:49,406
Stop it.

1010
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:04,922
We're going here.

1011
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:09,009
Where they found the first part
of the Antikythera.

1012
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:10,886
But...

1013
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:13,764
we're going deeper.

1014
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:19,061
Dad tracked down the old sponge diver
who found the Dial.

1015
01:15:19,186 --> 01:15:20,312
He told him...

1016
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,440
that the wrecked Roman ship broke up
under the sea...

1017
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:24,775
70 feet below.

1018
01:15:24,983 --> 01:15:27,903
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

1019
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:30,239
That's where they found it.

1020
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:34,910
But he said that most of the ship
had broken off...

1021
01:15:35,077 --> 01:15:36,870
and sunk to the ocean floor.

1022
01:15:37,829 --> 01:15:39,331
Too deep for sponge divers.

1023
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:43,210
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship...

1024
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:46,839
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

1025
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:53,887
They weren't taking half a Dial
for a joyride.

1026
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,268
They had the Grafikos...

1027
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,314
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

1028
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:09,236
Your dad was a genius.

1029
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:10,863
Yeah.

1030
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:13,323
He was.

1031
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:34,261
Seven of spades.

1032
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:38,599
How do you do that?

1033
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:39,850
Wow.

1034
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:41,518
Do it again.

1035
01:16:45,522 --> 01:16:47,399
Pick a card, Dr. Jones.

1036
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:56,074
Seven of spades!

1037
01:16:58,202 --> 01:16:59,244
She's magic.

1038
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:00,495
Trick deck.

1039
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:01,622
No.

1040
01:17:02,873 --> 01:17:04,291
I force the card.

1041
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,751
I offer the mark...

1042
01:17:05,918 --> 01:17:07,127
you...

1043
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:08,253
the feeling of a choice...

1044
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,631
but ultimately,
I make you pick the card I want.

1045
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:13,926
"The mark."

1046
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:18,931
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

1047
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:20,891
I have to check the lines.

1048
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:27,981
Good night.

1049
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:34,238
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

1050
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:36,907
Dates?

1051
01:17:37,074 --> 01:17:38,325
What dates?

1052
01:17:39,243 --> 01:17:40,244
These dates.

1053
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:46,416
Written over and over again in this letter.

1054
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:49,670
August 20th, 1969.

1055
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,421
That's three days from now.

1056
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:53,841
And the same date in 1939.

1057
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,426
Two weeks before Hitler invades Poland.

1058
01:17:58,887 --> 01:17:59,847
Wait.

1059
01:18:00,639 --> 01:18:02,975
Now you believe the Dial has magical powers?

1060
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:06,270
I don't believe in magic, Wombat.

1061
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:10,524
But a few times in my life, I've seen things.

1062
01:18:13,652 --> 01:18:15,404
Things I can't explain.

1063
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,199
And I've come to believe it's not so much...

1064
01:18:19,324 --> 01:18:21,451
what you believe.

1065
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:23,871
It's how hard you believe it.

1066
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:28,292
I've seen things too, Indy.

1067
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,837
The only thing worth believing in, ever...

1068
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:33,589
is cash.

1069
01:18:35,966 --> 01:18:37,050
Right.

1070
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:43,932
What if you could go back in time?

1071
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,352
What would you do?

1072
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:50,105
Witness the Trojan War?

1073
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:52,733
Check in on Cleopatra?

1074
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,447
I'd stop my son from enlisting.

1075
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:03,368
Did he sign up to please you?

1076
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,622
No, he signed up to piss me off.

1077
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:12,544
How would you have stopped him?

1078
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:18,550
I'd tell him he was gonna die.

1079
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:27,434
I'd tell him that his mother would...

1080
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:31,939
find no end to her grief.

1081
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:35,526
And that his father would be...

1082
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:40,280
helpless to console her.

1083
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:46,119
And that the loss would put an end
to their marriage.

1084
01:20:00,092 --> 01:20:01,343
You're still wearing the ring.

1085
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,659
Promising.

1086
01:20:34,126 --> 01:20:35,502
More promising.

1087
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:42,426
Hello.

1088
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:46,597
Get your gear on. They're waiting.

1089
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:52,102
Hey.

1090
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:54,354
Come here.

1091
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:56,607
Okay.

1092
01:20:56,773 --> 01:20:57,566
I'm gonna show you something.

1093
01:20:57,733 --> 01:20:59,651
Gosh, this looks important.

1094
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:03,739
Around the rope...

1095
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:06,158
Now, we are going deep.

1096
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:09,161
Descend fast,
and breathe through these hoses.

1097
01:21:09,328 --> 01:21:10,162
Okay?

1098
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:12,164
Stay separate.

1099
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:14,291
No crisscross. All right?

1100
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:15,584
We cannot stay long.

1101
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:19,087
I have a method
that usually prevents the bends.

1102
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:21,131
-Usually?
-Yeah.

1103
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:22,466
I call it "the bounce."

1104
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:23,675
You know, fast down...

1105
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:25,761
three minutes on the bottom, and then up.

1106
01:21:25,928 --> 01:21:27,012
Three minutes!

1107
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:29,014
No one more second.

1108
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:30,474
Three minutes.

1109
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:31,850
Yeah, that's right.

1110
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,852
-Where is my lighter?
-I don't know, capitán.

1111
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:36,063
We have to go.

1112
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:39,816
Quick question.

1113
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,401
What's that?

1114
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:42,819
-They're sharks?
-No.

1115
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:45,364
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

1116
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:47,366
Eels?

1117
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:48,742
Anguilas.

1118
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:49,826
Most are small.

1119
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:51,537
Sometimes they are big. Two meters.

1120
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:53,747
But if you see them, stay still.

1121
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:57,209
They bite you, they lock the jaw. Yeah.

1122
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:58,710
They look like snakes.

1123
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:00,546
No, they don't.

1124
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:02,714
Private Brandy reporting for duty.

1125
01:22:03,382 --> 01:22:04,216
You're not coming, Teddy?

1126
01:22:04,925 --> 01:22:06,093
I can't swim.

1127
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,427
Lucky him.

1128
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:08,846
Everyone can swim.

1129
01:22:10,722 --> 01:22:12,683
Reach and pull. Reach and pull.

1130
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:16,979
All right. You stay here with Hector
and watch our lines.

1131
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:22,067
It is time, camarada.

1132
01:24:10,509 --> 01:24:11,385
Two minutes?

1133
01:25:42,809 --> 01:25:43,727
I got it.

1134
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:25,519
Hey.

1135
01:26:57,634 --> 01:26:58,468
Hurry up!

1136
01:27:13,567 --> 01:27:15,068
Helena!

1137
01:27:23,952 --> 01:27:24,870
Come on.

1138
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:26,580
That's it. That's it. That's it.

1139
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:28,624
That's it.

1140
01:27:51,772 --> 01:27:52,981
Who are these people?

1141
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:56,235
Nazis.

1142
01:27:56,443 --> 01:27:58,904
First, you return my Dial, Dr. Jones...

1143
01:27:59,071 --> 01:28:02,199
and now, you bring me the Grafikos.

1144
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:05,285
I'm very happy you're not wasting
in retirement.

1145
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:07,996
I should have retired you
when I had the chance.

1146
01:28:08,205 --> 01:28:09,331
Where are your sponsors?

1147
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,041
I'm on my own now.

1148
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:12,918
Things move forward, Dr. Jones.

1149
01:28:13,085 --> 01:28:13,961
And sometimes...

1150
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:17,714
they go backward.

1151
01:28:20,926 --> 01:28:23,178
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

1152
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:51,623
What language is that?

1153
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:53,375
It's not a language.

1154
01:28:54,626 --> 01:28:55,711
It's a code.

1155
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:57,588
Polybius.

1156
01:28:58,380 --> 01:28:59,715
You owe me 50 quid.

1157
01:29:01,967 --> 01:29:03,844
Not familiar with Polybius cipher?

1158
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:04,928
No.

1159
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:07,097
But it appears you are.

1160
01:29:11,518 --> 01:29:12,477
Read it, please.

1161
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:21,862
No.

1162
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:28,660
Indy...

1163
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:41,006
Feeling helpful now?

1164
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:45,260
I am.

1165
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:49,723
I know this stuff backwards.

1166
01:29:49,848 --> 01:29:50,766
No!

1167
01:29:52,643 --> 01:29:53,560
Sorry, Indy.

1168
01:29:53,977 --> 01:29:55,270
I don't do noble death.

1169
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:57,064
Just...

1170
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:58,649
cold, hard maths.

1171
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:01,026
I crack the code,
help you find the other half.

1172
01:30:02,402 --> 01:30:04,112
One hundred grand. Cash.

1173
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:05,239
Helena...

1174
01:30:05,906 --> 01:30:06,865
Take it or leave it.

1175
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:09,451
You have a deal.

1176
01:30:23,048 --> 01:30:24,800
He'll never pay you.

1177
01:30:26,301 --> 01:30:29,179
I think you will find this is worth
more than your asking price.

1178
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,148
-Teddy.
-Helena...

1179
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:41,567
don't do this.

1180
01:30:46,989 --> 01:30:48,323
Let's see what we've got here.

1181
01:30:50,534 --> 01:30:51,952
"My Makhana..."

1182
01:30:52,578 --> 01:30:53,412
that's "machine"...

1183
01:30:54,663 --> 01:30:58,208
"lies with me, in the city I left.

1184
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:00,752
"Where wolves teach men to walk.

1185
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:05,048
"Under one of nine, I lie."

1186
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:09,636
Only one thing lies anywhere forever.

1187
01:31:09,803 --> 01:31:12,431
The dead. So, if the Dial lies with him,
then...

1188
01:31:14,308 --> 01:31:15,893
then this is directions to his tomb.

1189
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:17,686
The Tomb of Archimedes?

1190
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:20,898
Undiscovered for two millennia.

1191
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:26,069
"The city I left."

1192
01:31:26,737 --> 01:31:30,115
Archimedes lived two places his entire life,
so he only left one.

1193
01:31:31,033 --> 01:31:33,076
Anyone? At the back?

1194
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:35,412
Come on, Indy. Everyone knows this.

1195
01:31:35,621 --> 01:31:36,413
Even this clown.

1196
01:31:36,622 --> 01:31:37,998
Alexandria.

1197
01:31:38,123 --> 01:31:39,166
Full marks.

1198
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,586
Now, "wolf" in Greek is "lycos."

1199
01:31:42,753 --> 01:31:45,005
Root of the word "lycaeum" or "school."

1200
01:31:45,172 --> 01:31:47,799
And the Doric for "walking" is...

1201
01:31:49,176 --> 01:31:50,052
"peripatio."

1202
01:31:51,345 --> 01:31:54,097
Which also happens to be the word for...

1203
01:31:59,311 --> 01:32:01,271
I thought you were a bright spark.

1204
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:07,069
"Peripatio" means "walking"...

1205
01:32:07,194 --> 01:32:09,613
but it also means "counting."

1206
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,908
So, "Where wolves teach men to walk"...

1207
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,953
-could be...
-The School of Mathematics.

1208
01:32:17,246 --> 01:32:18,914
Is correct.

1209
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:20,582
Now, the next bit is easy.

1210
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:23,418
"Beneath one of nine"?

1211
01:32:24,628 --> 01:32:26,004
There are nine Muses.

1212
01:32:26,171 --> 01:32:27,256
The Museon.

1213
01:32:27,381 --> 01:32:29,925
The Greek word
for the Great Library of Alexandria.

1214
01:32:30,092 --> 01:32:33,846
Which, as we all know, has nine statues
supporting its roof.

1215
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:34,930
May I?

1216
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:37,015
Thank you.

1217
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:41,186
The nine Muses, in reverse order...

1218
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:44,147
are Calliope...

1219
01:32:45,107 --> 01:32:45,983
Urania...

1220
01:32:47,484 --> 01:32:48,527
Polymnia...

1221
01:32:49,486 --> 01:32:51,113
-Erato...
-Polymnia.

1222
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,657
...and Meli whasisname...

1223
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:55,075
that other one...

1224
01:32:55,909 --> 01:32:56,785
Thalia...

1225
01:32:57,536 --> 01:32:58,745
Euteroe...

1226
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:00,998
but the first is...

1227
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:02,249
Clio.

1228
01:33:04,084 --> 01:33:05,210
The Muse of history and time.

1229
01:33:05,419 --> 01:33:06,628
That Archimedes...

1230
01:33:06,837 --> 01:33:07,963
-what a clever bugger.
-The entrance...

1231
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:10,215
to the tomb
is by the School of Mathematics...

1232
01:33:10,382 --> 01:33:12,134
under a statue of Clio...

1233
01:33:12,259 --> 01:33:15,095
in the ruins
of the Great Library of Alexandria.

1234
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,471
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

1235
01:33:18,098 --> 01:33:18,932
Teddy!

1236
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:30,402
The Grafikos, get it!

1237
01:33:58,055 --> 01:34:00,807
I have said it before,
and I will say it again!

1238
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:03,519
When you're in a tight spot, dynamite.

1239
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,897
My friend was just murdered.

1240
01:34:12,361 --> 01:34:13,362
Sorry.

1241
01:34:13,529 --> 01:34:15,280
You told them everything.

1242
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:18,075
Word for word.

1243
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:20,619
But Archimedes didn't make it that easy.

1244
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:23,288
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

1245
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:33,382
Go!

1246
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:37,845
So, what do you see?

1247
01:34:38,512 --> 01:34:40,305
Polybius square.

1248
01:34:40,848 --> 01:34:41,974
Made of?

1249
01:34:44,518 --> 01:34:45,727
Wax and wood.

1250
01:34:47,312 --> 01:34:48,605
Anything else?

1251
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:53,110
It's heavy.

1252
01:34:56,154 --> 01:34:57,281
Too heavy.

1253
01:34:59,366 --> 01:35:00,492
Give me that.

1254
01:35:40,657 --> 01:35:42,367
This is solid gold?

1255
01:35:42,534 --> 01:35:43,744
Ancient gold.

1256
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:46,330
From the Nile.

1257
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:48,957
Hold it, Teddy.

1258
01:36:00,427 --> 01:36:01,512
Sell this thing...

1259
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,347
and we are out of the hole and then some.

1260
01:36:03,514 --> 01:36:04,431
I have just the customer.

1261
01:36:04,598 --> 01:36:07,601
-Cranky, old Duchess in Gibraltar...
-This is going in a museum.

1262
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:12,272
Take the wheel, Teddy.

1263
01:36:19,112 --> 01:36:20,113
What does it say?

1264
01:36:22,241 --> 01:36:25,118
"Search where Dionysius...

1265
01:36:25,953 --> 01:36:28,622
"hears each whisper...

1266
01:36:29,456 --> 01:36:31,500
"like a hurricane."

1267
01:36:34,419 --> 01:36:35,754
The Ear.

1268
01:36:36,505 --> 01:36:38,340
The cave of Dionysius.

1269
01:36:39,216 --> 01:36:40,175
Where is that?

1270
01:36:41,593 --> 01:36:42,636
In Sicily.

1271
01:36:44,137 --> 01:36:46,223
-How much fuel have we got?
-It's full.

1272
01:36:55,274 --> 01:36:56,275
They're heading west.

1273
01:36:57,568 --> 01:36:58,485
Not east.

1274
01:37:27,556 --> 01:37:28,473
I want the papaya.

1275
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:29,683
How much is it?

1276
01:37:33,145 --> 01:37:34,021
Take this.

1277
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:39,067
Look at that kid with the straw hat.

1278
01:37:40,235 --> 01:37:41,153
This way.

1279
01:37:44,323 --> 01:37:45,199
Hey.

1280
01:37:46,742 --> 01:37:48,035
What do you think?

1281
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:56,335
What are we doing?

1282
01:37:57,878 --> 01:37:59,588
Waiting for closing time at the caves.

1283
01:37:59,755 --> 01:38:01,256
It's crawling with tourists.

1284
01:38:01,423 --> 01:38:03,842
Okay, so he's, like, running the show now?

1285
01:38:05,219 --> 01:38:06,595
He's not running the show, Teddy.

1286
01:38:08,055 --> 01:38:11,183
I just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

1287
01:38:11,683 --> 01:38:12,851
We are.

1288
01:38:16,438 --> 01:38:17,314
Most assuredly.

1289
01:38:17,481 --> 01:38:20,275
You know he's never gonna let us sell
any of that stuff.

1290
01:38:21,735 --> 01:38:23,445
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

1291
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:25,572
Helena, get over here! Give me a hand!

1292
01:38:31,495 --> 01:38:32,579
You splurged.

1293
01:38:33,956 --> 01:38:34,915
Here's your backpack.

1294
01:38:35,123 --> 01:38:36,083
Where's the kid?

1295
01:38:50,055 --> 01:38:51,098
Hey, watch it!

1296
01:38:51,723 --> 01:38:52,975
What's wrong with you?

1297
01:39:21,503 --> 01:39:22,629
Hello.

1298
01:39:24,298 --> 01:39:25,132
Hey.

1299
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:29,136
Let me go!

1300
01:39:30,429 --> 01:39:31,471
Let me go!

1301
01:39:39,229 --> 01:39:41,440
Get off me! Let me go!

1302
01:39:45,152 --> 01:39:45,986
Hey, hey, hey!

1303
01:39:57,164 --> 01:39:58,290
Helena!

1304
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:01,084
They've got Teddy.

1305
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:04,755
They took him up the hill somewhere.

1306
01:40:24,858 --> 01:40:25,901
What are they gonna do to him?

1307
01:40:26,109 --> 01:40:28,779
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

1308
01:40:30,155 --> 01:40:31,657
They're not gonna hurt him.

1309
01:40:31,782 --> 01:40:32,950
They're gonna use him...

1310
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:35,953
to get the other half of the Dial.

1311
01:40:36,161 --> 01:40:37,496
We gotta get there first.

1312
01:40:50,259 --> 01:40:54,304
Colonizing queens built many cities
in Sicily.

1313
01:40:54,471 --> 01:40:55,973
-The temple...
-Let's go.

1314
01:40:56,682 --> 01:40:59,226
...is the oldest of the Greek temples.

1315
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:01,645
The cave's over there.

1316
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:13,782
Could we go a little faster, please?

1317
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,459
The Ear of Dionysius.

1318
01:41:32,217 --> 01:41:33,093
Wow.

1319
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:50,903
"Search where Dionysius hears each whisper
like a hurricane."

1320
01:41:52,112 --> 01:41:53,113
That's some echo.

1321
01:41:54,823 --> 01:41:57,492
Keep making noise till we find out
where it's loudest.

1322
01:42:14,885 --> 01:42:15,719
Stop.

1323
01:42:23,685 --> 01:42:24,770
This is it.

1324
01:42:29,775 --> 01:42:30,776
Greek pediment.

1325
01:42:31,902 --> 01:42:32,903
An entrance.

1326
01:42:34,321 --> 01:42:35,322
Used to be.

1327
01:42:38,617 --> 01:42:39,618
A crescent.

1328
01:42:42,496 --> 01:42:43,580
Just like on the Grafikos.

1329
01:42:51,129 --> 01:42:52,965
I think there's an opening up there.

1330
01:42:59,805 --> 01:43:00,639
You okay up there?

1331
01:43:01,807 --> 01:43:02,641
Yes.

1332
01:43:05,477 --> 01:43:06,520
You're not moving.

1333
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:10,232
I'm thinking.

1334
01:43:13,151 --> 01:43:14,027
About?

1335
01:43:15,195 --> 01:43:18,115
About what the hell I'm doing up here,
40 feet in the air...

1336
01:43:18,532 --> 01:43:20,033
with crap shoulders...

1337
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,035
crumbling vertebrae...

1338
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,746
a plate in one leg, screws in the other.

1339
01:43:24,872 --> 01:43:26,123
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1340
01:43:26,748 --> 01:43:27,875
No, you don't get it.

1341
01:43:28,709 --> 01:43:29,877
You're half my age.

1342
01:43:30,919 --> 01:43:33,630
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

1343
01:43:33,797 --> 01:43:35,007
No. Fair enough.

1344
01:43:35,841 --> 01:43:37,676
Or been tortured with voodoo.

1345
01:43:38,969 --> 01:43:41,805
And I'm just guessing, but I don't think
you've been shot nine times...

1346
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:44,391
including once by your father.

1347
01:43:46,101 --> 01:43:47,477
Dad shot you?

1348
01:43:48,187 --> 01:43:49,354
Don't talk to me.

1349
01:43:49,521 --> 01:43:50,689
Just go ahead. I'll follow you.

1350
01:43:59,489 --> 01:44:00,365
No, no, no.

1351
01:44:00,532 --> 01:44:01,992
We are close. We are close.

1352
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:03,160
Look around you.

1353
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:04,870
-We are close.
-The Cave of Dionysius.

1354
01:44:04,995 --> 01:44:05,871
No, no, no.

1355
01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:07,915
The cave is closed for renovation.

1356
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,959
Let me ask again.

1357
01:44:11,126 --> 01:44:13,045
Where is the Cave of Dionysius?

1358
01:44:32,731 --> 01:44:34,900
What's the matter? You worried about the kid?

1359
01:44:36,151 --> 01:44:37,861
Are you sure they won't hurt him?

1360
01:44:37,986 --> 01:44:39,196
He'll be fine.

1361
01:44:39,363 --> 01:44:40,405
He's smart.

1362
01:44:42,282 --> 01:44:43,659
Where'd you find him?

1363
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:49,998
He tried to steal my purse outside a casino
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

1364
01:44:50,165 --> 01:44:52,000
I hit him repeatedly with my car door...

1365
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:54,753
but he didn't let go and neither did I.

1366
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,421
So, been together ever since.

1367
01:44:57,589 --> 01:44:59,508
Thought you were all about the money.

1368
01:45:00,676 --> 01:45:01,635
I am.

1369
01:45:04,721 --> 01:45:08,767
Nobody memorizes every page
of their dead father's notebooks...

1370
01:45:08,892 --> 01:45:09,977
for the money.

1371
01:45:16,692 --> 01:45:17,693
Herr Voller!

1372
01:45:28,287 --> 01:45:29,663
They went that way.

1373
01:45:39,965 --> 01:45:41,008
Why?

1374
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:46,847
Come on, come on.

1375
01:45:49,558 --> 01:45:50,475
Let's go.

1376
01:45:55,314 --> 01:45:56,231
Oh, my...

1377
01:45:59,234 --> 01:46:00,736
Oh, my God!

1378
01:46:01,612 --> 01:46:02,905
Oh, my God!

1379
01:46:03,071 --> 01:46:04,531
-Oh, God!
-No, no.

1380
01:46:05,407 --> 01:46:06,825
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1381
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:12,331
Are they off me?

1382
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:13,332
-Get 'em off!
-No, no.

1383
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:14,750
-Get 'em off!
-Wait.

1384
01:46:27,763 --> 01:46:28,764
What is that?

1385
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:32,893
Methane.

1386
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:35,604
Don't breathe.

1387
01:46:35,771 --> 01:46:36,772
Don't breathe?

1388
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,860
We've gotta get outta here.

1389
01:46:50,744 --> 01:46:51,703
Athena.

1390
01:46:53,413 --> 01:46:54,748
Goddess of war.

1391
01:46:57,626 --> 01:46:58,836
And reason.

1392
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:04,424
"Under the moon...

1393
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:08,762
"life lies at her feet."

1394
01:47:16,562 --> 01:47:17,855
Water displacement.

1395
01:47:18,689 --> 01:47:19,982
Get in the pool!

1396
01:47:20,107 --> 01:47:22,109
Why? Help me open the door.

1397
01:47:22,276 --> 01:47:24,027
Well, they didn't get out the doors!

1398
01:47:24,111 --> 01:47:25,070
Get in the pool!

1399
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:27,990
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

1400
01:47:28,115 --> 01:47:29,241
Help me.

1401
01:47:31,994 --> 01:47:34,037
Archimedes was fascinated...

1402
01:47:35,497 --> 01:47:37,457
by water displacement!

1403
01:48:18,665 --> 01:48:19,875
Hey! Get back here!

1404
01:48:20,042 --> 01:48:20,792
Klaber!

1405
01:48:34,973 --> 01:48:36,099
You don't need to do that.

1406
01:49:02,292 --> 01:49:03,126
Hey!

1407
01:49:04,336 --> 01:49:05,170
Give me that!

1408
01:49:07,172 --> 01:49:08,048
No!

1409
01:49:15,430 --> 01:49:16,723
Leave them.

1410
01:49:17,432 --> 01:49:19,059
I said leave them.

1411
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,043
Reach and pull.

1412
01:49:45,169 --> 01:49:46,837
Reach and pull.

1413
01:49:46,962 --> 01:49:49,131
Reach and pull.

1414
01:50:17,534 --> 01:50:19,161
Archimedes' tomb.

1415
01:50:48,106 --> 01:50:49,358
Grab that corner.

1416
01:51:35,654 --> 01:51:36,572
Indy.

1417
01:51:39,032 --> 01:51:40,367
This frieze...

1418
01:51:43,036 --> 01:51:44,329
It's a phoenix.

1419
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:45,455
A common icon.

1420
01:51:45,622 --> 01:51:47,207
No. Look, it isn't.

1421
01:51:48,834 --> 01:51:50,502
This phoenix has propellers.

1422
01:51:59,344 --> 01:52:00,888
What's this doing here?

1423
01:52:09,646 --> 01:52:12,649
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years...

1424
01:52:13,317 --> 01:52:14,776
much less watches.

1425
01:52:17,321 --> 01:52:18,488
Archimedes used it.

1426
01:52:22,117 --> 01:52:23,410
Dad was right.

1427
01:52:24,244 --> 01:52:25,078
It works.

1428
01:52:25,245 --> 01:52:26,830
Of course it works, Miss Shaw.

1429
01:52:29,541 --> 01:52:30,751
Mathematics works.

1430
01:52:31,919 --> 01:52:34,922
As it conquered space, it will conquer time.

1431
01:52:42,804 --> 01:52:44,723
You've already lost your son, Dr. Jones.

1432
01:52:44,932 --> 01:52:45,807
Your wife is gone.

1433
01:52:46,016 --> 01:52:47,935
Do you really want to lose your godchild?

1434
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:52,105
For what?

1435
01:52:52,481 --> 01:52:54,608
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

1436
01:53:06,161 --> 01:53:07,037
Thank you.

1437
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:47,077
History's greatest moment.

1438
01:53:54,168 --> 01:53:55,419
Its end.

1439
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:04,178
Throw me the gun!

1440
01:54:14,521 --> 01:54:15,772
Get him outta here.

1441
01:54:15,939 --> 01:54:16,773
Teddy.

1442
01:54:17,816 --> 01:54:18,984
Teddy! Teddy!

1443
01:54:19,109 --> 01:54:20,194
Come on! Go!

1444
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:21,236
This way. Come on.

1445
01:54:25,324 --> 01:54:26,200
Go!

1446
01:54:30,579 --> 01:54:31,496
Indy!

1447
01:54:33,498 --> 01:54:34,625
Go!

1448
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:36,043
Go!

1449
01:54:36,251 --> 01:54:37,336
Stop!

1450
01:54:40,672 --> 01:54:42,090
Now what?

1451
01:54:43,717 --> 01:54:44,718
Bring him.

1452
01:54:52,768 --> 01:54:53,769
Helena, come on!

1453
01:54:54,019 --> 01:54:55,354
-Teddy, we can't just leave him.
-We're not!

1454
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:56,647
Follow me!

1455
01:54:58,649 --> 01:54:59,650
Come on!

1456
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:04,446
Come on.

1457
01:55:18,794 --> 01:55:20,754
Teddy. Come on. We've got a car.

1458
01:55:25,717 --> 01:55:26,677
Crap.

1459
01:55:32,891 --> 01:55:33,934
Stay there.

1460
01:55:52,828 --> 01:55:53,829
Hop on.

1461
01:55:57,457 --> 01:56:00,377
The first hemisphere sets the destination.

1462
01:56:01,879 --> 01:56:05,465
The second calculates the location
of the fissure...

1463
01:56:06,675 --> 01:56:08,552
in Alexandrine coordinates.

1464
01:56:09,178 --> 01:56:11,972
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude...

1465
01:56:13,056 --> 01:56:14,892
and transmit waypoints to the pilots.

1466
01:56:27,112 --> 01:56:28,572
Shortcut.

1467
01:56:32,826 --> 01:56:37,289
-You got coordinates for 37.07.
-So, who is it?

1468
01:56:37,956 --> 01:56:39,291
Churchill?

1469
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:41,627
Ike?

1470
01:56:43,921 --> 01:56:46,423
Who are you gonna kill to win the war?

1471
01:56:47,257 --> 01:56:50,177
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes...

1472
01:56:50,302 --> 01:56:52,221
we shall fly into the eye of this storm...

1473
01:56:52,971 --> 01:56:55,265
and cross into Sicilian airspace...

1474
01:56:55,432 --> 01:56:58,852
on August 20th, 1939.

1475
01:56:59,603 --> 01:57:03,190
We will head north over friendly skies
with enough fuel to reach Munich.

1476
01:57:04,525 --> 01:57:06,109
My quarry will be waiting for me...

1477
01:57:06,276 --> 01:57:09,112
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz...

1478
01:57:09,530 --> 01:57:11,698
for an update on his V-1 rocket.

1479
01:57:18,664 --> 01:57:22,626
What kind of Nazi kills the Führer?

1480
01:57:24,336 --> 01:57:26,922
The kind that believes in victory, Dr. Jones.

1481
01:57:32,219 --> 01:57:36,056
Hitler lit a fire that could have burned
1,000 years.

1482
01:57:36,223 --> 01:57:37,724
I saw every mistake.

1483
01:57:38,517 --> 01:57:39,810
Every blunder.

1484
01:57:39,977 --> 01:57:41,645
And I will correct them all.

1485
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:44,439
History is a long list of losses, Dr. Jones.

1486
01:57:45,482 --> 01:57:46,692
It's just a question of whose.

1487
01:57:59,413 --> 01:58:00,414
Stop!

1488
01:59:13,612 --> 01:59:14,404
Teddy.

1489
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,241
You think you can fly one of those?

1490
01:59:19,409 --> 01:59:20,285
A Nord?

1491
01:59:22,996 --> 01:59:23,914
Sure.

1492
01:59:24,706 --> 01:59:25,791
It's not a ringing response.

1493
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:27,668
Well, I haven't flown a Nord.

1494
01:59:27,751 --> 01:59:29,378
You've never flown any plane.

1495
01:59:31,171 --> 01:59:32,381
I'll get it started.

1496
01:59:32,548 --> 01:59:33,799
No, Teddy.

1497
01:59:35,092 --> 01:59:35,968
Crap.

1498
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:04,913
Fasten your seat belt, Dr. Jones.

1499
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:06,415
There might be some turbulence.

1500
02:00:07,374 --> 02:00:09,793
You're German, Voller.

1501
02:00:10,002 --> 02:00:12,004
Don't try and be funny.

1502
02:00:35,444 --> 02:00:37,237
Come on, big talker.

1503
02:00:52,169 --> 02:00:53,045
Okay.

1504
02:01:09,853 --> 02:01:11,522
Okay. Okay.

1505
02:01:11,688 --> 02:01:14,149
Gauges green. Power full.

1506
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:17,361
And when I reach 85, I rotate.

1507
02:01:55,065 --> 02:01:56,567
Okay, wings down.

1508
02:01:58,652 --> 02:02:00,654
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

1509
02:02:01,029 --> 02:02:01,989
Rotate.

1510
02:03:09,932 --> 02:03:11,225
Time to destination?

1511
02:03:12,518 --> 02:03:13,977
60 seconds.

1512
02:03:19,316 --> 02:03:20,859
Continental drift.

1513
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:25,405
Continental drift!

1514
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:29,785
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

1515
02:03:30,619 --> 02:03:31,870
He couldn't have!

1516
02:03:32,871 --> 02:03:34,790
It hadn't been observed yet.

1517
02:03:35,832 --> 02:03:37,626
You're off target.

1518
02:03:38,001 --> 02:03:39,962
Your coordinates are based on markers...

1519
02:03:40,712 --> 02:03:43,924
that have been moving for 2000 years!

1520
02:03:44,049 --> 02:03:47,427
You could be off by 10 degrees, by...

1521
02:04:02,442 --> 02:04:04,027
30 seconds.

1522
02:04:05,237 --> 02:04:06,071
Herr Voller...

1523
02:04:06,238 --> 02:04:09,032
Your calculations are wrong!

1524
02:04:09,575 --> 02:04:10,784
-Herr Voller...
-Will you shut up?

1525
02:04:11,368 --> 02:04:12,369
I'm thinking!

1526
02:04:15,372 --> 02:04:16,290
20 seconds.

1527
02:04:19,042 --> 02:04:20,169
Hold the flight path!

1528
02:04:22,129 --> 02:04:23,463
15 seconds.

1529
02:04:27,009 --> 02:04:28,427
I don't know where we're going, Jürgen.

1530
02:04:28,677 --> 02:04:29,428
10 seconds.

1531
02:04:30,345 --> 02:04:31,096
9!

1532
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:32,681
-But it sure as hell...
-8!

1533
02:04:33,223 --> 02:04:34,766
-7!
-...ain't 1939!

1534
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:35,601
6!

1535
02:04:35,684 --> 02:04:36,977
Turn around!

1536
02:04:37,644 --> 02:04:38,478
Abort!

1537
02:04:39,062 --> 02:04:39,813
Turn around!

1538
02:04:40,731 --> 02:04:41,481
ABORT!!!

1539
02:04:41,857 --> 02:04:43,817
We're being pulled in!

1540
02:04:53,869 --> 02:04:55,120
What are you doing?!

1541
02:04:55,329 --> 02:04:56,163
This is my plane!

1542
02:04:56,496 --> 02:04:57,915
You're flying my plane!

1543
02:05:22,731 --> 02:05:23,899
We're going to DIE!!!

1544
02:05:25,192 --> 02:05:26,944
We need to pull up!

1545
02:05:48,799 --> 02:05:49,967
Restart engines!

1546
02:06:18,579 --> 02:06:19,705
That's Sicily.

1547
02:06:19,872 --> 02:06:21,123
1939.

1548
02:06:22,833 --> 02:06:24,251
I did it.

1549
02:06:24,418 --> 02:06:25,919
I did it, Dr. Jones!

1550
02:06:26,086 --> 02:06:27,838
Setting coordinates for Munich.

1551
02:06:34,803 --> 02:06:36,847
Yesterday belongs to us, Dr. Jones.

1552
02:07:01,705 --> 02:07:03,916
Those are Roman triremes.

1553
02:07:32,152 --> 02:07:33,320
Keep it in the air!

1554
02:07:53,465 --> 02:07:54,216
Master...

1555
02:07:54,424 --> 02:07:56,844
The Romans are getting closer.

1556
02:07:58,595 --> 02:07:59,471
They have dragons!

1557
02:08:04,184 --> 02:08:05,561
Amazing.

1558
02:08:15,070 --> 02:08:16,029
Open the door!

1559
02:08:20,951 --> 02:08:21,952
What are you doing?

1560
02:08:22,911 --> 02:08:24,621
What are you doing, you idiots?

1561
02:08:24,788 --> 02:08:26,582
They think we're a monster!

1562
02:08:33,046 --> 02:08:34,506
You have to turn around.

1563
02:08:34,715 --> 02:08:36,592
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

1564
02:08:37,759 --> 02:08:39,136
214 BC.

1565
02:08:39,261 --> 02:08:40,429
You got the wrong war.

1566
02:08:44,266 --> 02:08:45,017
Master...

1567
02:08:48,478 --> 02:08:49,688
Don't ride out there, Master!

1568
02:08:50,355 --> 02:08:51,523
The dragons!!

1569
02:09:01,783 --> 02:09:05,329
We must take down their dragons!

1570
02:09:12,461 --> 02:09:13,337
Boss!

1571
02:09:13,462 --> 02:09:14,338
Change course!

1572
02:09:14,546 --> 02:09:15,923
The portal closes in minutes!

1573
02:09:16,381 --> 02:09:17,257
I have to go back!

1574
02:09:17,716 --> 02:09:18,884
I can't be here!

1575
02:09:19,051 --> 02:09:20,135
I CAN'T STAY HERE!!

1576
02:09:20,302 --> 02:09:21,762
The plane won't make it!!

1577
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:52,417
Get out of the way!

1578
02:09:58,757 --> 02:10:00,926
How do you like that, you savages?

1579
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:06,723
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

1580
02:10:16,775 --> 02:10:18,861
What are you doing here?

1581
02:10:19,069 --> 02:10:20,529
Rescuing you!

1582
02:10:32,124 --> 02:10:33,000
Get him off!

1583
02:10:34,376 --> 02:10:35,419
Indy!

1584
02:10:41,133 --> 02:10:42,301
Parachute!

1585
02:10:45,137 --> 02:10:46,305
I got a parachute!

1586
02:10:47,723 --> 02:10:48,557
Hang on!

1587
02:10:52,436 --> 02:10:53,312
Let go!

1588
02:10:55,606 --> 02:10:57,024
Give me the parachute!

1589
02:11:03,113 --> 02:11:05,240
Grab it. Hang on!

1590
02:11:07,618 --> 02:11:08,452
Indy!

1591
02:11:35,812 --> 02:11:37,356
We're losing altitude!

1592
02:11:38,565 --> 02:11:39,525
We're going down!

1593
02:11:41,443 --> 02:11:42,986
I've lost control!

1594
02:12:01,255 --> 02:12:03,632
Hey, those are my friends.

1595
02:12:03,799 --> 02:12:05,843
Those are my friends. We need to help them!

1596
02:12:07,052 --> 02:12:08,637
Those are my friends!

1597
02:13:10,532 --> 02:13:11,867
Eureka.

1598
02:13:29,134 --> 02:13:29,968
He's trying to land.

1599
02:13:30,177 --> 02:13:32,179
Come on, Indy. Help me.

1600
02:13:32,888 --> 02:13:34,932
Get up. Yeah.

1601
02:13:35,140 --> 02:13:37,434
We need to get you out of here. Okay.

1602
02:13:39,353 --> 02:13:40,604
Help me. Sit up, okay?

1603
02:13:41,522 --> 02:13:42,689
Sit up. You need to help me.

1604
02:13:42,856 --> 02:13:44,775
I know it hurts, but we gotta get you back.

1605
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:47,653
This is incredible, Wombat.

1606
02:13:48,195 --> 02:13:50,155
Incredible.

1607
02:13:51,698 --> 02:13:53,408
Yeah, it very well is.

1608
02:13:53,575 --> 02:13:55,202
But we have to get you out of here.

1609
02:13:57,287 --> 02:13:58,413
My God.

1610
02:14:00,082 --> 02:14:01,917
We're witnessing history.

1611
02:14:09,007 --> 02:14:10,843
Reverse these numbers.

1612
02:14:10,968 --> 02:14:12,052
They'll get you home.

1613
02:14:13,929 --> 02:14:14,763
What?

1614
02:14:17,683 --> 02:14:18,892
I'm going to stay.

1615
02:14:19,643 --> 02:14:21,645
No. You're not serious.

1616
02:14:24,481 --> 02:14:25,524
Wow, you are serious.

1617
02:14:29,611 --> 02:14:31,363
Indy, you've been shot.

1618
02:14:31,530 --> 02:14:32,364
You're bleeding.

1619
02:14:32,698 --> 02:14:34,324
You can't stay here.

1620
02:14:34,491 --> 02:14:35,367
Yes, I can.

1621
02:14:35,951 --> 02:14:36,910
But for what?

1622
02:14:37,077 --> 02:14:40,706
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

1623
02:14:41,707 --> 02:14:43,834
I've imagined this, Wombat.

1624
02:14:44,918 --> 02:14:46,712
Studied it.

1625
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:48,964
-All my life.
-Yeah.

1626
02:14:49,131 --> 02:14:52,259
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

1627
02:14:52,426 --> 02:14:53,260
And die.

1628
02:14:53,927 --> 02:14:55,637
Please, get up.

1629
02:14:57,389 --> 02:14:58,557
Helena!

1630
02:14:59,016 --> 02:14:59,850
I did it!

1631
02:14:59,975 --> 02:15:02,352
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

1632
02:15:02,561 --> 02:15:04,021
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go. Get up.

1633
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:05,731
-I need to get you into that plane, okay?
-No.

1634
02:15:05,856 --> 02:15:06,773
-We need to.
-No.

1635
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:08,567
Get up. You can... We can!

1636
02:15:21,747 --> 02:15:22,497
Master!

1637
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:27,002
We have to leave, Master.

1638
02:15:28,712 --> 02:15:29,713
It's him.

1639
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:40,682
He's asking how far we've come.

1640
02:15:44,061 --> 02:15:46,813
Two thousand years.

1641
02:15:47,523 --> 02:15:48,690
We've come...

1642
02:15:49,233 --> 02:15:52,236
two thousand years.

1643
02:15:54,613 --> 02:15:57,741
But we didn't expect to meet...

1644
02:15:58,242 --> 02:16:00,744
the great...

1645
02:16:01,328 --> 02:16:03,372
Archimedes.

1646
02:16:08,961 --> 02:16:09,878
You...

1647
02:16:11,088 --> 02:16:12,506
were always...

1648
02:16:13,090 --> 02:16:14,424
going to...

1649
02:16:14,925 --> 02:16:16,593
meet me.

1650
02:16:17,302 --> 02:16:19,096
That dial is a forced deck.

1651
02:16:19,263 --> 02:16:20,722
It doesn't take us anywhere but here.

1652
02:16:20,848 --> 02:16:22,140
He built it to get help.

1653
02:16:22,307 --> 02:16:24,852
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy...

1654
02:16:25,018 --> 02:16:25,936
so I think we've helped enough.

1655
02:16:26,144 --> 02:16:27,771
Apologies, Archimedes.

1656
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:29,356
I'm a fan...

1657
02:16:29,565 --> 02:16:31,608
but we need to leave. He's hurt.

1658
02:16:31,733 --> 02:16:32,651
Helena...

1659
02:16:32,776 --> 02:16:33,777
He can't keep that, by the way.

1660
02:16:33,944 --> 02:16:34,820
He needs to build his own one.

1661
02:16:34,987 --> 02:16:36,780
Helena, we need to go!

1662
02:16:37,155 --> 02:16:39,324
Indy, the window is closing!

1663
02:16:39,533 --> 02:16:40,659
We cannot get stuck here!

1664
02:16:42,077 --> 02:16:42,828
I want...

1665
02:16:42,953 --> 02:16:44,037
to stay...

1666
02:16:44,413 --> 02:16:46,164
with you.

1667
02:16:46,331 --> 02:16:48,292
No, no, no! Do not say yes!

1668
02:16:48,876 --> 02:16:51,128
You are a brilliant man...

1669
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:53,422
a wise man...

1670
02:16:53,881 --> 02:16:55,257
a genius...

1671
02:16:55,465 --> 02:16:56,258
Helena...

1672
02:16:56,466 --> 02:16:58,760
a hero to your people.

1673
02:16:59,511 --> 02:17:02,973
But he can't help you.

1674
02:17:04,057 --> 02:17:05,851
This is your time.

1675
02:17:05,976 --> 02:17:06,727
This is your time.

1676
02:17:06,852 --> 02:17:08,854
He must be in his own time -

1677
02:17:08,979 --> 02:17:10,063
He needs to be in his.

1678
02:17:10,189 --> 02:17:11,190
His work is not done.

1679
02:17:11,565 --> 02:17:12,524
He needs to go home.

1680
02:17:12,691 --> 02:17:14,276
There is medicine at home.

1681
02:17:14,443 --> 02:17:16,236
He cannot die here. He can't.

1682
02:17:17,863 --> 02:17:20,741
Helena, get on the plane.

1683
02:17:23,368 --> 02:17:24,453
I'll be all right.

1684
02:17:26,205 --> 02:17:27,664
No, you won't.

1685
02:17:30,584 --> 02:17:32,252
I need to do this.

1686
02:17:33,545 --> 02:17:34,379
Me too.

1687
02:18:29,017 --> 02:18:29,893
Good morning.

1688
02:18:34,773 --> 02:18:36,108
How's the shoulder?

1689
02:18:38,819 --> 02:18:41,280
Better than my jaw.

1690
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:45,951
Right.

1691
02:18:47,953 --> 02:18:49,454
You should've let me stay.

1692
02:18:50,289 --> 02:18:51,540
I couldn't do that.

1693
02:19:00,591 --> 02:19:01,508
Why not?

1694
02:19:03,468 --> 02:19:05,929
Well, for starters, you'd have changed
the course of history.

1695
02:19:10,267 --> 02:19:12,102
That's supposed to be a bad thing?

1696
02:19:16,231 --> 02:19:18,025
You're meant to be here, Indy.

1697
02:19:21,904 --> 02:19:22,738
Here.

1698
02:19:27,951 --> 02:19:29,036
For who?

1699
02:19:56,355 --> 02:19:58,023
Marion.

1700
02:19:59,191 --> 02:20:00,234
Hey.

1701
02:20:19,670 --> 02:20:20,587
Teddy.

1702
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:23,090
Marion.

1703
02:20:25,968 --> 02:20:26,927
What are you doing?

1704
02:20:28,387 --> 02:20:29,596
Putting groceries away.

1705
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:34,601
There wasn't a scrap of food in this place.

1706
02:20:35,561 --> 02:20:37,563
No. Really.

1707
02:20:42,276 --> 02:20:44,570
Someone told me you were back.

1708
02:20:52,035 --> 02:20:53,620
Are you back, Indy?

1709
02:20:55,247 --> 02:20:56,999
It was explosives...

1710
02:20:57,124 --> 02:20:59,251
and Indy was running,
Marion was running...

1711
02:20:59,418 --> 02:21:02,045
and suddenly the plane exploded.

1712
02:21:05,841 --> 02:21:07,885
Indy, you're up and about.

1713
02:21:09,052 --> 02:21:10,387
Yes, I am.

1714
02:21:11,763 --> 02:21:12,556
Yes.

1715
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:15,225
Why don't we go and get some ice cream, kids?

1716
02:21:15,350 --> 02:21:16,643
But Marion just bought some.

1717
02:21:16,852 --> 02:21:17,936
Oh, I know a better place.

1718
02:21:18,103 --> 02:21:20,272
You can never have too much ice cream,
can you?

1719
02:21:24,151 --> 02:21:24,985
See you later.

1720
02:21:28,155 --> 02:21:31,491
A British tar is a soaring soul

1721
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:34,453
As free as a mountain bird

1722
02:21:34,703 --> 02:21:36,455
His energetic fist

1723
02:21:36,705 --> 02:21:39,124
Should be ready to resist...

1724
02:21:41,001 --> 02:21:42,252
That looks bad.

1725
02:21:43,754 --> 02:21:45,047
Does it hurt?

1726
02:21:47,549 --> 02:21:49,009
Everything hurts.

1727
02:21:51,887 --> 02:21:53,514
I know how that feels.

1728
02:21:59,645 --> 02:22:02,231
Well, where doesn't it hurt?

1729
02:22:10,405 --> 02:22:11,240
Here.

1730
02:22:12,616 --> 02:22:13,867
It doesn't hurt here.

1731
02:22:22,125 --> 02:22:23,710
And here.

1732
02:22:47,234 --> 02:22:49,695
Jabari, Alia, slow down!

1733
02:22:49,862 --> 02:22:51,989
Helena! Hurry up!

1734
02:22:52,155 --> 02:22:54,825
I scream, you scream...

1735
02:22:54,992 --> 02:22:56,702
Everybody, slow down.

1736
02:22:56,785 --> 02:22:59,246
-I scream, you scream
-I scream, I scream

1737
02:22:59,413 --> 02:23:01,164
We all scream for ice cream!

1738
02:23:01,290 --> 02:23:02,457
Slow down.
