00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,550
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:32,294
(upbeat hip hop music)

3
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:53,704
- Crystal Van Meter, your life represents

4
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:56,954
a juvenile justice system gone so awry.

5
00:00:58,218 --> 00:00:59,846
What a tragedy.

6
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:02,945
Yet to continue allowing
you to traffic in drugs,

7
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:04,865
to rob and beat foolish men

8
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,971
on the pretext of having a good time,

9
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:10,431
that would only serve to
compound that tragedy.

10
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:13,180
Now in view of this eating disorder,

11
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,167
I'm directing the Youth
Authority to place you

12
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:18,405
into a medical facility
where you'll get some help.

13
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:20,698
Then, on your 19th birthday,

14
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:23,102
you'll be turned over to the
Department of Corrections

15
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:24,864
to serve a term of no less

16
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:29,005
than 25 years Frontera
Institute for Women.

17
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,398
(gavel bangs)

18
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:33,135
- What kind of bullshit?

19
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,133
Well, this ain't over, not by a long shot.

20
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:36,857
We gonna reverse this bitch.

21
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:38,012
Then I'm gonna get you off, baby.

22
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:38,845
My word is bomb.

23
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:39,683
Be strong.

24
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:43,016
(upbeat mariachi music)

25
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:54,659
- [Crystal] Don't push me, fucker!

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,983
- You just get sentenced?

27
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:24,973
She's got a sentence, I can tell.

28
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:27,294
What you got?

29
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:31,337
- I really don't wanna talk, all right?

30
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:32,837
- I just got life.

31
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:35,468
- All right.

32
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:38,051
Gotta something to smile about.

33
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,409
- Crystal, says here you're bulimic.

34
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:53,442
When'd you eat last?

35
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:57,848
Well, we don't tolerate
eating disorders here, miss.

36
00:02:57,848 --> 00:02:59,794
You're gonna have some supper.

37
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:03,264
And someone's gonna sit down,
make sure you eat every bite.

38
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:04,097
Let's go.

39
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:29,078
(heaving)

40
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,205
- Hey, did you really
get fed through a tube?

41
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,660
- [Crystal] I really don't wanna talk now.

42
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:19,625
- Want me to eat your pussy?

43
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,084
- No.

44
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,084
Go to sleep.

45
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:25,379
- My name's Cyclona.

46
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,745
- Go to sleep, Cyclona.

47
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:28,578
- Hey.

48
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,391
- [Crystal] What?

49
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,748
- What's your name?

50
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,500
- My real name's Crystal.

51
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,600
Most people call me White Girl.

52
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,267
- I like Crystal, but
White Girl's more you.

53
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:45,374
(moans)

54
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:47,116
I love you.

55
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:48,381
I love you.

56
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,971
I love you, Sporty Spice.

57
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:52,191
(moaning)

58
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:53,944
I love you, Sporty Spice.

59
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:55,487
Oh yeah.

60
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:56,460
- Look, if you don't cut that out,

61
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,210
I'm gonna bust your goddamn head!

62
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,006
(Cyclona speaking in foreign language)

63
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:07,456
Aw, man.

64
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:13,626
(Cyclona speaking in foreign language)

65
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,186
(Cyclona chuckling)

66
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:20,540
- Shh.
- Hey.

67
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,958
Hey you.

68
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,283
Wanna tell me how you get life?

69
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,882
- Yeah, but if you laugh,

70
00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:27,658
you're gonna have a real bad night.

71
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:31,408
(ethereal synthesizer music)

72
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:36,280
- It's not the sorta
thing a person laughs at.

73
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,308
- I got up this morning,
right, and I heard this voice.

74
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:44,767
And so I'm looking to see
where it's coming from.

75
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,920
It told me so much shit.

76
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,274
(chuckling)

77
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,239
- So who'd you kill?

78
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,739
- I'm not telling.

79
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,043
- Oh, man.

80
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,488
25 years of this.

81
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:00,478
- [Cyclona] Hey White Girl.

82
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:02,811
- Huh?
- You want a back rub?

83
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:08,416
(Cyclona whimpering)

84
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,570
- [Guard] What's her story?

85
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,321
- You're asking me, goddammit?

86
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:14,241
- I had my period, okay?

87
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:16,351
So don't have a fucking cow!

88
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:19,351
(upbeat rock music)

89
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,763
(chuckling)

90
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:57,677
- Crystal.

91
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,886
Just in time for lunch.

92
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:01,469
You know the drill.

93
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,320
- What the hell is it?

94
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,144
- It's turkey, Blanca.

95
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:12,977
Now eat.

96
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:15,979
You too, Mousy, come on.

97
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,618
Stop playing with your food.

98
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:22,118
I want those plates clean when I get back.

99
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:54,789
(loud heaving)

100
00:08:59,081 --> 00:08:59,977
- You keep on with that shit

101
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:02,810
and you're just gonna end up dead.

102
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,060
What, you think they're gonna let you off

103
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,966
for humanitarian reasons?

104
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,619
- [White Girl] They ain't letting me out.

105
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,271
I know that.

106
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:14,967
- So, who do you do it for?

107
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:18,583
- I'd tell you, but then
I'd have to kill you.

108
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,333
- Y'all barfed again?

109
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,050
You know, maybe you won't
have to barf so much

110
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,113
if you got yourself a little--

111
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:29,119
(toilet flushes)

112
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,952
- Yeah, mine's as big as a bucket.

113
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:35,602
- It's too bad we're stuck in this place.

114
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:38,371
I know this woman who'd
straighten your shit out so fast.

115
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,371
- Like I need my shit straightened out.

116
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,332
- She's this nun named Sister Gomez.

117
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,743
You oughta go to chapel
with me next weekend.

118
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:47,980
We could pray for her
to intercede for you.

119
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,784
- You want me to pray to Sister Gomez?

120
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:52,857
- Sister Gomez's goodness could reach you

121
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,305
even to this place.

122
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:58,170
- You girls have all been
warned about purging.

123
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,748
It's clear you didn't take
the warning seriously.

124
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:03,749
Now you're gonna see
worst there is indeed.

125
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:06,849
(upbeat rock music)

126
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:07,769
- [White Girl] What is it?

127
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,001
- Oh, a little Prolixin,
a little cortisone.

128
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:13,032
It's gonna suppress your gag reflex.

129
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:14,754
Pretty creative, don't you think?

130
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:17,686
- So we can't make ourselves throw up.

131
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:19,625
- You're aren't gonna feel
very good tonight, Crystal,

132
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,507
none of you girls are.

133
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:23,007
If this is what it takes,

134
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:25,303
guess it's what we're gonna have to do.

135
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:27,584
(hawks loudly)

136
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:28,417
Charming.

137
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:30,309
Come on.

138
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:31,892
You need some rest.

139
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,001
- Hey White Girl.

140
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:53,063
Hey White Girl, you awake?

141
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:56,966
- You know, Cyclona, (chuckles)
if this is a booty call,

142
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:58,163
you're wasting your time.

143
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:59,861
- This ain't no booty call.

144
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:01,757
- I gotta get some sleep.

145
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:03,180
Why don't you get the fuck outta here.

146
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,701
Go play with yourself or something.

147
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:10,110
- You'll be going to
state prison soon, huh?

148
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,358
- [White Girl] Yeah, so what?

149
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,809
- So you're gonna be all
old when you get out, huh?

150
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:18,321
- You'll be in a fucking coffin, so there.

151
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:21,568
- Frontera's maximum security, okay?

152
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:24,945
Once we get to Frontera,
that's it, man, we're fucked.

153
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,201
Check it out, the clinic
is over by this fence.

154
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:28,450
I got some shit buried there

155
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,851
that we could use to get through it.

156
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,193
- Even if we got through the fence,

157
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,110
we'd still need a place to go afterward.

158
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,943
- I know this place.

159
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,600
It's so fucking rad.

160
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,604
(chuckles)

161
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:37,845
- I don't know.

162
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:40,905
I'm awful fucking recognizable these days.

163
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:42,871
- What, 'cause you've been on TV?

164
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:46,042
I've been on America's
Most Wanted three times.

165
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,369
The place I'm talking
about, that don't mean shit.

166
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:49,680
Fuck.

167
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,430
Think about it, okay?

168
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:04,159
- Take some orange juice, Crystal.

169
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:06,938
Eat your breakfast burrito.

170
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:09,050
- I hate those fucking things.

171
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,217
- Eat your breakfast burrito, Crystal.

172
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,145
Won't do you any good to look at it.

173
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:21,145
(suspenseful synthesizer music)

174
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:28,800
I need some assistance here!

175
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,633
- Come on, Crystal,

176
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,314
you're just making it harder on yourself.

177
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:32,320
- Sit down, Crystal!

178
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,487
Eat your food!

179
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:36,172
You want it through a tube again?!

180
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,029
It's your choice!
(loud splashing)

181
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:38,932
(screams)

182
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:41,606
- Now take her down, White Girl!

183
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:42,689
Go, girl, go!

184
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,069
(laughing)

185
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:46,393
- Get her outta here!

186
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:49,388
(loud thud)
(groans)

187
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:50,515
- [Cyclona] Get off me!

188
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:51,427
Get off me!

189
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:54,585
(girls cheering)
Get off me!

190
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:55,418
Fucking let me go!

191
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:57,781
- Everyone down to number seven!

192
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,531
I can't believe this!

193
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:04,612
One month in isolation, Crystal!

194
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:05,618
And another charge!

195
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,729
I hope it's worth it.

196
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:09,029
- Yeah, it was, fucking vomit head!

197
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,076
(loud thud)

198
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:13,326
(upbeat hip hop music)

199
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:15,350
Fuck you!

200
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,849
(moaning)

201
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:42,513
(loud clacks)

202
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:45,763
- Ready to be a good girl now, Crystal?

203
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:54,081
(upbeat rock music)

204
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:06,224
- Yo, yo, man, I heard
she got caught molesting

205
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,339
that fucked up girl in the wheelchair.

206
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,945
And all they managed to
do is go to those stupid

207
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:11,960
sexaholics classes they got on Wednesdays.

208
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,907
- [Blonde Woman] You mean
that bitch who got her

209
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:14,099
spine shot up by the cops?

210
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:16,810
- No, that spazzy cholo
with the coppertone hair

211
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,808
and that brain disease,

212
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:19,227
so she can't talk or move or nothing,

213
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:20,912
but she thinks just fine.

214
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:22,532
- That bitch is a total perv.

215
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:24,225
She better keep her ass away from me.

216
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:25,559
- You know, I don't get why

217
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,161
that coppertone bitch is even here.

218
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,402
I mean, she can't talk,
she can't move, nothing.

219
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,906
And what are they even
fucking with us for?

220
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:32,921
I mean, we're all going to the pen

221
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,411
for the rest of our lives anyway.

222
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:36,217
- It's all a bunch of fucking perverts.

223
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:38,030
Why else do you think someone
would work in a prison?

224
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,931
- You know that's true.
- This prison isn't that bad.

225
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:43,812
- Oh!
- Yeah!

226
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:47,979
(heaving)
(chattering)

227
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:52,483
- Keep going.
- Oh yeah, oh yeah!

228
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:53,316
- You go, girl.

229
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:55,483
Get on with your bad self.

230
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:58,964
- Yeah, oh yeah!

231
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,378
- Come on, get it out.
(heaving)

232
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,625
- [Crystal] Give me that fucking bucket.

233
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,232
- Come on.
(coughing)

234
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:05,198
- Bring her out!

235
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:06,877
- [Crystal] Hurry up, I'm
getting an urge to purge.

236
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,073
- Keep going, girl!
- Oh!

237
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,871
(heaving)

238
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:13,621
(women cheering)

239
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:32,156
(whimpering)

240
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,116
- I gotta get outta here, White Girl.

241
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:37,639
I can't take it no more.

242
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,807
- Cyclona, you're here for murder.

243
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,427
- It was a mistake, okay?!

244
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,053
Fuck!

245
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:46,016
If I don't get outta here,
I'm gonna kill myself.

246
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:47,937
- Will you give them that satisfaction?

247
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:49,965
- Hey, I'm only 19, okay?

248
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,109
If I kill myself,

249
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:53,043
those fuckers will lose
their jobs so fast,

250
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:54,160
they won't know what hit them.

251
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,012
- Oh, you think they'd cry over you?

252
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:56,845
- Fuck!

253
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,359
- What about this hideout
you've been talking about?

254
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,671
- It's in Baja.

255
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:02,853
- Mexico?

256
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:03,691
That's just great.

257
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:05,931
- Hey, we make it to
Mexico, we're home free.

258
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,602
- What, you know people who'd help us?

259
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:10,043
- Yeah, that nun I told you about,

260
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:11,535
Sister Gomez.
- She's a nun.

261
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:12,368
Fuckin' A.

262
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:13,924
She's not gonna help us.

263
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:15,038
- Yeah, she will!

264
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:17,228
Do you know what she used to
call me when I was little?

265
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:18,496
Her little movie star.

266
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:21,124
- Yeah, and now you're an
all grownup convicted killer.

267
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:23,292
You think she's just gonna
greet you with open arms?

268
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:26,408
- Sister Gomez's arms are always open,

269
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:29,075
and there's room for both of us.

270
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:35,183
- They can't keep me in this shithole,

271
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:37,983
sticking me with their needles,

272
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:40,400
running tubes down my throat.

273
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,390
Problem is,

274
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,400
you don't always have a
real good grip on reality,

275
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,394
and for this to work, everything
you say has gotta be real.

276
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:49,703
- Hey, I can be straight.

277
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:52,515
I mean, all I gotta do
is take my Stelazine

278
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,304
and my Thorazine and my Haldol--

279
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,561
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you
gotta take that shit everyday.

280
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,501
Otherwise, you can forget
about even riding with me.

281
00:16:58,501 --> 00:16:59,757
- Yeah, but my mouth gets all dry

282
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:01,396
and I can't turn my neck and--
- Do you know what you are?

283
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,951
Just way too outta control.

284
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:04,129
- Hey, I gotta whole bunch.

285
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,002
I was saving them to kill myself.

286
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:06,835
(clattering)

287
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:08,587
- [Nurse] Hey, you know you're
not supposed to be here!

288
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:12,055
(phone ringing)

289
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:13,074
- Crystal?

290
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:13,907
How you doing, baby?

291
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,115
You felling all right, pumpkin?

292
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:15,948
- What are you crazy?

293
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:17,438
I'm totally fucked here.

294
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:20,041
- I went before the State
Board of Appeals yesterday,

295
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,787
and Judge Calton's had some concerns

296
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,811
of a very technical nature,
made me feel quite optimistic.

297
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:25,992
You know what me and you are gonna do?

298
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:27,804
If everything starts going our way,

299
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:29,107
we gonna do some ecstasy,

300
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:31,718
then I'm gonna freak your ass hard.

301
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,911
You down for that, baby?

302
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:34,214
- Hey, that's great, Mr. Butz,

303
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:36,484
but I can't get by on just wishes.

304
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:38,434
You get what I'm telling you?

305
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:39,292
- Wait, what's up, Crystal?

306
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,453
What you trying to say?

307
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,637
- Look, I gotta go now.

308
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:44,769
You have a real nice day now, Mr. Butz.

309
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:47,225
- Wait, wait, Crystal!

310
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:48,058
Damn!

311
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,855
(upbeat hip hop music)

312
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,799
(grunting)

313
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:29,501
- Let me at that fucking thing!

314
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:31,751
(grunting)

315
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:44,154
(loud rip)
(groans)

316
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:44,987
Ah, fuck!

317
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:57,001
- Take a seat, Junior,
before everything gets cold.

318
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,034
- Oh, I can't, Grandma.

319
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,257
I got a date with Patty tonight.

320
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:02,200
- Not in my car, you don't, Mr. DUI.

321
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,515
- And not looking like that, I hope.

322
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:06,548
- Ah, don't worry.

323
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:08,560
She likes the Dodge anyway.

324
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,399
Besides, I think I'm gonna have

325
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,066
the fuel line fixed before dark.

326
00:19:13,134 --> 00:19:15,228
- [White Girl] This fucking
thing gonna kill me?

327
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:16,951
- I don't know, but it sure is gonna sting

328
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:19,951
'cause of all the bug shit and piss.

329
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:22,709
(White Girl groans)

330
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:26,434
Hey, now I can tell everyone
I got to see your ass.

331
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:29,876
It's a nice tight, little ass too.

332
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,835
Maybe I oughta suck out the
poison like they do on TV.

333
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:34,585
- Yeah, you just try.

334
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,760
Well, if this thing gets much worse,

335
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,882
you might have to go it alone.

336
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:40,715
- Yeah?

337
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:42,133
What would you do?

338
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,960
- I don't know.

339
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,818
Kill myself, probably.

340
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:46,963
- I can do that.

341
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:47,796
- Do what?

342
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:49,574
- Kill you.

343
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:54,237
- Got any friends we could call?

344
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:56,575
- Whole world hates my guts.

345
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:57,408
- Oh.

346
00:19:58,511 --> 00:19:59,411
What about family?

347
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:01,480
My family's all in jail.

348
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,770
- My family's all dead.

349
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,265
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Cyclona.

350
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:07,491
- Why don't you wait here,

351
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:11,158
and I'll come back as
soon as I can work it.

352
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,848
- [Radio Host] White people unite.

353
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,376
The traders, resplincers,
and the New World Order

354
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:19,991
threw us into dissent in the behest of--

355
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:21,264
(loud thuds)
(groans)

356
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:25,093
The satanic Jews to
destroy the white race.

357
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,621
- [Man] I see here that you and Vanessa

358
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:28,985
were arrested together twice.

359
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,622
- We needed money, thought
it'd be all grownup

360
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:33,543
turning tricks on Warren Avenue.

361
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:36,809
Was only gonna jack them off is all.

362
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:37,850
- [Man] Did you ever see Vanessa--

363
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,414
(ominous synthesizer music)

364
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:41,972
- Don't move, don't you
fucking move, puto cracker.

365
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:45,139
I swear I'll drink your fucking blood.

366
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,191
Are we alone?

367
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:50,548
Don't lie to me, grandpa!

368
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,381
- My wife is upstairs.

369
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,993
- Get up slow, real slow.

370
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:01,535
- The hell, Cyclona?

371
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:02,673
I've been freezing out here.

372
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:03,506
- [Cyclona] I'm here, aren't I?

373
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:04,339
Check it out!

374
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,013
- [White Girl] This will work.

375
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:07,666
- That house has got
everything, White Girl.

376
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,973
Come on, I wanna show you so bad.

377
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:10,429
- What about a gun, did you find a gun?

378
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,763
- No, but there's chicken,
and all this doctor shit,

379
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:13,892
and there's probably something there

380
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:15,499
for that thing on your leg.

381
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:17,267
And there's this old-fashioned vibrator,

382
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,767
the kind you plug in the wall.

383
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:24,364
- Oh, man.

384
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:38,344
Where you think they
went, leaving this TV on?

385
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:40,602
- Who gives a shit, as
long as they ain't here.

386
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:42,403
- Just don't want the
three fucking bears blow in

387
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:46,570
while I'm going through
all their shit, all right?

388
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,945
You check upstairs already?

389
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:51,006
- Of course I did, I
mean, what do you think,

390
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:52,589
I'm stupid or what?

391
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:57,868
- Hey, this shit's for infected cows.

392
00:21:57,868 --> 00:22:01,176
- You want me to shoot you up?

393
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:02,858
Just pull them panties down for Cyclona

394
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:05,080
and I'll stick you real good.

395
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,628
- Would you stop hitting
on me all the time?

396
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:08,550
No, I'm serious.

397
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,383
Every chance you get,

398
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:11,570
you starting with all
that fucking dyke shit.

399
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,032
"You want me to eat you out?"

400
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,618
"You want a fucking back rub?"

401
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:16,099
"Oh, you got such a nice ass."

402
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:19,160
"You look just like Sporty
Spice when you bend over."

403
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,253
Swear to fucking God, you're
worse than a goddamn--

404
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:22,716
- I said I was sorry, okay?

405
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,249
Why you wanna make me feel like a dog?

406
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:26,192
- [White Girl] Shoot myself up just fine.

407
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:27,366
- I like shooting up girls.

408
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:28,699
It makes me hot.

409
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,511
- Fucking big ass cow needle.

410
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:36,218
It's gonna be a moment to remember.

411
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:37,051
Ow!

412
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:38,405
Shit.

413
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:39,745
Ow!

414
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:41,318
- Man, oh, man.

415
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,985
These people really like to eat.

416
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:49,186
I am stuffed like a
motherfucking pig, White Girl,

417
00:22:49,186 --> 00:22:50,948
I swear to God.

418
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:53,781
- You know, we've only just begun.

419
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,617
- Yeah, well, you go, girl.

420
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:58,961
You just do your thing, okay?

421
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,248
I'm gonna go upstairs, take a shower,

422
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,748
give myself a little makeover.

423
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,213
Anyone comes, you know
what to do, don't you?

424
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:10,046
Hey!

425
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:11,801
You do know what you do, don't you?

426
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:13,947
- I know what to do better than you do.

427
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:17,407
- [Cyclona] Just wanted to be sure.

428
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:19,552
- Now why don't you go upstairs
and talk to your bunkies

429
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,615
or whatever it is you do, all right?

430
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:23,529
I don't want to fucking
see your face right now.

431
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:24,362
- Fine.

Hey Cyclona!

459
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:19,648
Where's my little spick?

460
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:21,371
Cyclona?

(buzzing)
(breathing loudly)

462
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,194
What you doing here, Cyclona?

(ominous synthesizer music)

464
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,077
- Why are you so far away?

465
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:47,459
I cannot see you all the way over there.

466
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:50,015
- Could've tied them up, Cyclona.

467
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,334
Holy shit, we could've put them

468
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:52,864
in the basement or something.

469
00:25:52,864 --> 00:25:55,197
- He tried to rape me, okay?

470
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:01,585
You don't know nothing!

471
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:02,418
(screams)
- What's up with you fucking

472
00:26:02,418 --> 00:26:04,216
yourself with a goddamn vibrator?

473
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:05,546
Answer me, goddammit!

474
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:06,574
- Don't be hitting me!

475
00:26:06,574 --> 00:26:08,991
You're not my fucking mother!

476
00:26:17,152 --> 00:26:19,419
- [White Girl] Okay, listen,
you and me are splitting up.

477
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:21,754
- Wait, you're leaving me?

478
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:22,587
No.

479
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:24,272
- Just shut the fuck up and listen, okay?

480
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:26,059
I'm talking to you like an adult.

481
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:30,520
Only thing I want is to find
some place quiet and blend in.

482
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,327
All you wanna do is raise hell.

483
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:33,494
- Look, I know you're all smart

484
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:35,512
'cause you always have
your shit altogether,

485
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,950
but I can't do that, okay?

486
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,143
I know it, but I'm willing to learn.

487
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:43,667
- Cyclona, you just killed
two senior citizens.

488
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,411
Where's your fucking heart?

489
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:49,583
(loud slap)
Where's your fucking brain?

490
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,806
You stopped taking your
medicine, haven't you?

491
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:54,605
- Yeah, 'cause it makes
me feel totally fucked!

492
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,153
Look, I'm so sorry that I'm not all

493
00:26:56,153 --> 00:26:58,145
super happy and together like you,

494
00:26:58,145 --> 00:27:00,657
you fucking barbie ass punk!
- Yeah, maybe you're too much

495
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:01,714
of a bitch to try.

496
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:02,651
- Yeah, maybe you don't got

497
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:04,787
fucking voices chasing you around,

498
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:07,902
telling you shit, like,
"You're just a dirty slut!"

499
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:11,886
And how you got cancer in
your heart and in your bones!

500
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:15,197
It feels really okay to be all alone!

501
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:17,830
I'm gonna blow it, and
they're gonna catch me

502
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,082
and put me in one of their cages forever.

503
00:27:20,082 --> 00:27:22,903
- You're a goddamn serial killer.

504
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:24,257
- I don't need to be getting called

505
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:26,056
names right now, White Girl.

506
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:27,605
Right now, I'm really shaky.

507
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,634
- You belong in a fucking cage.

508
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:32,564
- Look, please, I won't do it again!

509
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:34,380
I promise I won't!

510
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,597
- To even think about you
and me being together,

511
00:27:36,597 --> 00:27:39,310
you'd have to do what I
say and when I say it.

512
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,847
- Don't be running no power trip stuff

513
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:41,680
here right now, okay?
- Oh, you think

514
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,781
it's about power?!

515
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:45,141
This is about you being
too fucking outta control!

516
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:46,696
We go around killing people,

517
00:27:46,696 --> 00:27:47,634
they're just gonna pile up

518
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,939
that many more cops until they catch us.

519
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:50,966
- Okay.

520
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,387
You know what, okay, fine.

521
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:53,531
You're the boss, okay?

522
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:54,660
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

523
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,090
- Yeah?

524
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,423
Then take your medicine now.

525
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,060
Open your mouth, goddammit.

526
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,379
- What for?

527
00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:05,629
- So I can see!

528
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:08,099
Yeah.

529
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:09,728
Swallow those motherfucking pills

530
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:12,819
before I kill you, goddammit.

531
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:14,610
(whimpers)

532
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,118
Okay, now listen to me!

533
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:20,025
What you did in here has
got nothing to do with me!

534
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:23,306
We get pinched, you got a
moral duty to let them know

535
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:26,386
you was working strictly
solo, you understand?

536
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:29,871
I will fucking kill you
if you betray me on this!

537
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:31,358
- Yeah.

538
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:33,108
We ain't get pinched.

539
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,287
- Wanna leave here now or what?

540
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:38,572
- What, and go out there
and freeze to death?

541
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:40,993
- What, you wanna do more sex
shit with them dead people?

542
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:43,386
- No, I wanna clean up, okay?

543
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:46,286
Why don't you just go downstairs
and, like, rest your leg

544
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:48,251
'cause it's probably the
last chance you'll get.

545
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:51,251
And I'll just come down later, okay?

546
00:28:59,073 --> 00:28:59,999
- [Man] That'll be all for now.

547
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:00,832
Thank you.

548
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:12,174
- [News Anchor] We interrupt
this program to bring you

549
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:16,273
the latest news on the prison
breakout, live on the scene.

550
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:17,960
- Despite their age and their appearance,

551
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,130
I'd have to say these girls are

552
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,769
about as dangerous a pair of customers

553
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:23,146
this agency's ever had to contend with.

554
00:29:23,146 --> 00:29:26,419
The Garcia girl's a
deviant, sexual psychopath.

555
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:29,718
She killed and dismembered
her entire family.

556
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:31,188
- [Reporter] What about
the Van Meter girl?

557
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:34,124
A lot of people think the system
gave her a pretty raw deal.

558
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:35,649
- Excuse me?

559
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,060
She burglarized her entire neighborhood.

560
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,626
She's a car thief, a drug dealer,

561
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:44,379
an armed robber that specializes
in posing as a prostitute.

562
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:46,414
This is not some angel
we're talking about.

563
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:47,598
This is a criminal.

564
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:49,994
This is a dangerous felon.

565
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:50,894
- Hey Cyclona,

566
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:52,219
are you coming down?!
- Do you think

567
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:54,760
an arrest is imminent?

568
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,783
- We've got two possible outcomes,

569
00:29:56,783 --> 00:30:01,689
either we find them and we
arrest them, or we kill them.

570
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:05,252
- Better hope you don't find me, Mr. Cop.

571
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:06,269
- [News Anchor] We will
keep you up to date

572
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:07,685
as this story unfolds.

573
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:10,435
And now, back to tonight's movie.

574
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:13,019
(loud clunk)
- Rise and shine,

575
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,695
you dirty slut.

576
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:17,778
So, what do you think of my new look?

577
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:20,762
- Think you look like a big dyke.

578
00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:22,528
- They're looking for
two girls, White Girl.

579
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:25,168
Now anyone asks, you can tell
them I'm your little brother.

580
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:26,298
- If I tell them anything,

581
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:28,164
you're just gonna kill them anyway.

582
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:30,534
- I'm not doing that
shit no more, remember?

583
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:31,404
How's your leg?

584
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:32,434
- Better.

585
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:33,807
Man, that stuff worked good.

586
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:35,877
- It's 'cause I prayed for you.

587
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,137
I found some clothes outside.

588
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:38,182
I think you should wear the scarf.

589
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:40,178
It'll make you look more girly.

590
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:42,340
- What do you care if I look all girly?

591
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,507
- The more you look like a girl,
the more I feel like a boy.

592
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:49,005
What's for breakfast?

593
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:50,658
- [White Girl] I ate everything.

594
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:52,199
- [Cyclona] Damn, girl.

595
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:55,949
- Well, we better fire
this place up and get.

596
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:00,252
- I'm glad we're gonna
be together, White Girl.

597
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:02,933
(flames roaring)

598
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:04,375
- [White Girl] Hey,
what's that you got there?

599
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,436
- Some shit we might need later.

600
00:31:06,436 --> 00:31:08,629
I can't believe they had no guns in there.

601
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:09,830
Every white person in the world

602
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,077
has a bunch of guns, you know?

603
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:13,994
- Ah, fuck.

604
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:20,030
(loud crash)

605
00:31:23,746 --> 00:31:27,079
Give me the keys and shut up, all right?

606
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:41,374
Man, what was he doing under
this fucking thing, anyway?

607
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:43,104
I mean, is this car even gonna work?

608
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,554
- Fixing the fuel line.

609
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:46,162
It's okay, I took care of it.

610
00:31:46,162 --> 00:31:46,995
Jerk.

611
00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:50,266
Had it held together
with a piece of string.

612
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,859
- He was fixing his fuel line?

613
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:53,623
- Look, that's before we talked, okay?

614
00:31:53,623 --> 00:31:57,898
I said I wasn't gonna
do that shit anymore.

615
00:31:57,898 --> 00:31:59,394
- Ah.
(loud cracking)

616
00:31:59,394 --> 00:32:00,227
God.

617
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:01,793
- [Cyclona] I think you broke his legs.

618
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:06,122
- Ah, I'm so fucking mad at
you, goddamn cholo bitch.

619
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:08,205
Stupid, sick ass asshole.

620
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:22,801
(sighs)

621
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:25,712
- Can I talk now?

622
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:26,664
- No.

623
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:28,081
- You wanna beer?

624
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:32,610
You think they're gonna be able to tie us

625
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,312
into those people back there?

626
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:37,312
- Oh, you're worried about that now?

627
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:46,084
- Tell me, how does a
girl get into barfing?

628
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:50,251
- Look, it's just one subject
I'm just not into, okay?

629
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:53,695
What do you wanna get into
all that shit for, huh?

630
00:32:53,695 --> 00:32:55,053
What, you wanna be entertained?

631
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:56,768
You wanna laugh at what a
sick fucking bitch I am?

632
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,008
- No.

633
00:32:58,008 --> 00:32:59,669
Just so stupid sometimes, I swear.

634
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:00,966
- What do you wanna know for?

635
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:02,633
- 'Cause I love you.

636
00:33:03,896 --> 00:33:05,255
Can I not love you?

637
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,798
- Look, Cyclona, if I
knew white girls barfed,

638
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:09,548
I'd be a millionaire.

639
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:15,326
- So did you do it when you were little?

640
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:19,658
- Remember this one time, my
mama was doing county time.

641
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:22,721
Damn, she used to love her crank.

642
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:25,554
I's how come she named me Crystal.

643
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:29,767
Anyhow, I was staying
with this foster family.

644
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:33,017
(upbeat hip hop music)

645
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:04,666
That first time, I didn't
throw up or nothing.

646
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,955
Back then, that would've seem so crazy.

647
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:09,214
(car honks)
- Shit, White Girl, shit!

648
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:13,863
(tires screeching)
(laughing)

649
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:18,672
(car honks)
(laughing)

650
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:20,641
(cars honking)
- Yeah!

651
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,891
Shit!
- Oh shit.

652
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:27,249
Freak.
- Got it, got it.

653
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:30,087
- I don't know, White Girl,

654
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:31,296
barfing is just about the worst thing

655
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,103
I could ever think of doing.

656
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:37,092
Whenever I throw up, just before,

657
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:39,122
I always get the same image in mind,

658
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:42,466
right before I'm about to heave.

659
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:44,549
Makes me think of the
first time I blew my dad.

660
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,933
(upbeat mariachi music)

661
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:49,016
(heaves)

662
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:52,454
- Doing your dad definitely qualifies

663
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,545
as some memorable shit.

664
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:56,155
I know, I've been there.

665
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:57,897
- Before I threw up,
I remember there being

666
00:34:57,897 --> 00:35:02,491
these really bright lights
and they hurt my eyes so bad.

667
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:05,561
And I never told nobody this, I swear,

668
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,534
but there was a flying saucer

669
00:35:07,534 --> 00:35:09,953
and beings from another
world there and everything.

670
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:13,305
- You're telling me aliens
flew all the way down to Earth

671
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:15,027
just to watch you blow your dad?

672
00:35:15,027 --> 00:35:16,579
- I'm telling you, I
think that they were doing

673
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:19,173
medical experiments on me or something.

674
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:22,120
I remember getting stuck
with all these needles,

675
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,724
and feeling like I was on dope and shit.

676
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:27,554
And all these probes were
going in and out of my body.

677
00:35:27,554 --> 00:35:29,784
- I'm not gonna say what
all those probes sound like.

678
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:31,637
- And then Sister Gomez was there,

679
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:36,047
making them lights and
monster people go away,

680
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:38,047
making me feel all safe.

681
00:35:39,858 --> 00:35:41,002
- [White Girl] That's
what you brought along?

682
00:35:41,002 --> 00:35:42,421
Spray paint?

683
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:43,991
- After the number you did in the kitchen,

684
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:45,747
this is all that was left.

685
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:47,827
Lucky we got this.

686
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:50,327
(can hissing)

687
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,117
(inhales)

688
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:06,320
(tires screech)

689
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:11,742
- Oh shit.

690
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:14,278
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
- Fuck!

691
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:15,111
- Shit!
- Think they saw us.

692
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:17,295
Lie down.
- Better fucking hope not!

693
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:18,807
Don't even fucking look at them, Cyclona.

694
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:22,140
Don't even look at their ugly pig faces.

695
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:24,449
- If I had a big fucking gun,

696
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:27,647
I'd blow off his big, fat pig fucking--

697
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:28,557
- Yeah, but you fucking don't,

698
00:36:28,557 --> 00:36:32,047
so just keep your mouth
shut and act normal.

699
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:36,214
- I'm gonna piss in my
pants if they don't go away.

700
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,246
- Oh fuck, man.

701
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:46,871
Crack me another one of
those beers, all right?

702
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,441
Fuck.

703
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:51,382
Oh, what the fuck's matter with you?

704
00:36:51,382 --> 00:36:54,013
- I pissed in my pants, okay?

705
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:55,713
(whimpers)

706
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,401
- Cyclona, it's okay.

707
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:58,872
- It's fucked up.

708
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:01,036
Now, I'm gonna smell like pee.

709
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:03,009
You're not gonna tell nobody, are you?

710
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:05,009
- I'd never tell anyone.

711
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:10,056
Look, Cyclona, we're playing
for high stakes here.

712
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:12,625
Sometimes when people
play for high stakes,

713
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,433
they piss their pants.

714
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:17,620
- I know, but it's still embarrassing.

715
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,537
- Man, look, come here.

716
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,683
Come on now.

717
00:37:23,683 --> 00:37:24,516
Get in the car.

718
00:37:24,516 --> 00:37:26,450
We've better get, all right?

719
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,867
- [Cyclona] Okay.

720
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:39,940
- [White Girl] Hey, you know
we were on TV last night.

721
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,023
- Was it bad?

722
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:43,778
- It wasn't very nice.

723
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:46,706
How come you never mentioned
before that those people

724
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:50,430
you killed just happened
to be your family?

725
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,528
- 'Cause I like being popular.

726
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:56,028
I was so little the first
time my dad got to me

727
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:58,611
that I can't even have no kids.

728
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:01,624
I'm supposed to act normal.

729
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:03,424
This one time in Nogales,

730
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:06,452
I had to go to the hospital and
get my guts all stitched up.

731
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:08,286
- You used to live in Mexico?

732
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,349
- Yeah, but I ain't exactly no Mexican.

733
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:11,385
- Spick.

734
00:38:11,385 --> 00:38:12,830
- Hey, I'm an Apache, okay?

735
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,832
- Wah, wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah, spick!

736
00:38:14,832 --> 00:38:15,665
(chuckles)

737
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:17,572
- Everyone thinks we're all lazy and shit.

738
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:18,425
(laughs)

739
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:22,223
And then when I turned 13, my
dad brought us up permanent.

740
00:38:22,223 --> 00:38:23,527
Worst thing ever happened to me.

741
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,086
- What, moving to the US?

742
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:26,581
- 'Cause we had to leave our church,

743
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:27,731
and I didn't have Sister Gomez

744
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:31,448
standing between me and my dad no more.

745
00:38:31,448 --> 00:38:33,028
(can hissing)

746
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:35,533
(inhales)

747
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,967
- So you think your dad's
why you're all into women?

748
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:38,800
- No way.

749
00:38:39,672 --> 00:38:41,983
I was born to eat chocha.

750
00:38:41,983 --> 00:38:43,990
- You're drooling.

751
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,626
I think if I were to have my face all up

752
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:50,187
in some woman's box,
I'd probably barf in it.

753
00:38:50,187 --> 00:38:51,627
- Don't talk anymore, White Girl.

754
00:38:51,627 --> 00:38:52,652
I'm huffing.

755
00:38:52,652 --> 00:38:55,328
Besides, you'd probably barf in anything.

756
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:57,495
(inhales)

757
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:07,909
(inhales)

758
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,738
(tires screeching)

759
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:13,819
Shit, White Girl!

760
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:15,819
Holy shit, we're flying!

761
00:39:17,844 --> 00:39:19,269
- Fuck!

762
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,102
Woo!

763
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:22,906
- [Cyclona] We're flying!

764
00:39:22,906 --> 00:39:25,156
(laughing)

765
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,616
Wait, I think we're outta beer.

766
00:39:32,616 --> 00:39:34,699
(laughs)

767
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:40,334
- Ah shit!

768
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,183
Ow!

769
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:45,296
Where are you?

770
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:47,193
(laughing)

771
00:39:47,193 --> 00:39:48,026
Come on!

772
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:52,508
Ah!

773
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:54,529
Ah, no more.

774
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:57,564
This ain't hallow.

775
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:58,762
(mumbling)

776
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:01,239
(laughing)

777
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,822
Wait, I have paint.

778
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:06,501
(mumbles)

779
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:08,785
(mumbles)

780
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:11,279
Well, we've got two options.

781
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:14,640
We go up the hill, down the hill.

782
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,676
Down the hill!

783
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:17,926
(laughing)

784
00:40:20,811 --> 00:40:22,718
- [Cyclona] White Girl, you being boss?

785
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:25,377
- Yeah, fuck it, I'll be a boss, bitch!

786
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:26,451
I'm the boss, bitch!

787
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:28,558
- Hey, wait, wait, I got
another can of paint!

788
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:29,912
- Ow!

789
00:40:29,912 --> 00:40:32,581
Yo, there's a can of paint in my pussy!

790
00:40:32,581 --> 00:40:33,414
Bitch.

791
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:36,646
- Yeah, that's it.

792
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:38,299
Girl, I like to keep you out the joint,

793
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:40,468
but you gotta keep your mouth shut.

794
00:40:40,468 --> 00:40:41,673
- I know--
- Can't you see that you're

795
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,575
your own worst enemy?

796
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,395
- I know I fucked up, Mr. Butz.

797
00:40:45,395 --> 00:40:46,804
- [Mr. Butz] Oof!

798
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:47,956
- Jeremy Butz?

799
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:48,896
- Yeah, what's up?

800
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,420
- My name's Crefilo.

801
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,304
This is my partner, Detective Dollar.

802
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:53,184
- Yeah, I recognize you.

803
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,834
You're Crystal's
arresting officers, right?

804
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,711
- You wanna cut that out?

805
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:57,845
This is a courthouse.

806
00:40:57,845 --> 00:40:59,650
- Ease up, baby.

807
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,483
(sighs)

808
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:01,691
What can I do for you?

809
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:04,652
- Are you aware that Crystal
busted outta jail yesterday?

810
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:06,043
- Well, nobody contacted me.

811
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:07,096
- You haven't spoken to her?

812
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:10,037
- I did have a conversation
by phone with her

813
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:12,394
yesterday morning to explain the appeal.

814
00:41:12,394 --> 00:41:14,873
- Look, neither of us
has ever been comfortable

815
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,129
with the sentence that Crystal got.

816
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:17,475
- Well, I wish you'd have brought that up

817
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,938
during the sentencing phase.

818
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:21,030
- She slashed one of our
people with a broken bottle.

819
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,459
Do you know what the
department would've done to us

820
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:23,815
if we'd come up publicly for her?

821
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,984
- She stole a bag of crank from her mama,

822
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,940
tried to cash it in, and
y'all gave her 25 years?

823
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,970
What the fuck kinda country
are we living up in here?!

824
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,476
- Hey, just spare us the outrage.

825
00:41:32,476 --> 00:41:35,999
- Fucking right wing piece of pig shit!

826
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,756
This bitch is choking me.
- Let him go.

827
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:38,589
Give it up.

828
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:39,479
Come on, here we go.
- She's choking me.

829
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:40,928
Bitch is choking me.

830
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:41,899
(gurgling)

831
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,036
- Come on.

832
00:41:43,036 --> 00:41:44,133
- Let that bitch go!

833
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,537
This nigga's about to break you off

834
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,644
a piece of some whoop ass!

835
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:49,040
Oh, you didn't know I was a
black belt in dim mak, did you?

836
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,218
Come on, get you some!

837
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:51,397
- Let it go.

838
00:41:51,397 --> 00:41:52,439
You wait over there, okay?

839
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,782
- You know, y'all really
got to do something about

840
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:55,858
your psychological testing, man, goddamn.

841
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:57,251
- Your client's traveling
with a little friend

842
00:41:57,251 --> 00:42:00,279
she met in lockup named Angela Garcia.

843
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:02,043
Ever hear of her?

844
00:42:02,043 --> 00:42:04,216
- You're talking about that
serial killer from Apple Valley?

845
00:42:04,216 --> 00:42:05,438
- Garcia bitch has murdered everyone

846
00:42:05,438 --> 00:42:06,735
who's ever been close to her.

847
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:11,436
Family, social worker,
shot them all in the face.

848
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:14,901
She kills again, your
client's going down with her,

849
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:16,401
no doubt about it.

850
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:21,497
- [Cyclona] We're out, totally out.

851
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,049
- Good 'cause I think I nearly killed

852
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:27,319
half of my brain cells with
huffing all of that shit.

853
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:28,995
- [Cyclona] I'm getting cold.

854
00:42:28,995 --> 00:42:30,009
Aren't you getting cold?

855
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:34,176
- Yeah, so let's get away
from this fucking water.

856
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:39,166
(train horn wailing)

857
00:42:41,078 --> 00:42:42,745
Yo, man, it's close!

858
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:52,367
Come on, let's go for it.

859
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:56,534
(bell tolling)
(train horn wailing)

860
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:01,074
(train rumbling)

861
00:43:23,082 --> 00:43:24,676
- [Cyclona] You okay?

862
00:43:24,676 --> 00:43:26,192
- Just thinking how
stupid we're gonna look

863
00:43:26,192 --> 00:43:30,254
when we get strapped down
for our lethal injections.

864
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:32,458
- Compared to what the
state's got planned for us,

865
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:34,625
that hot shot be kindness.

866
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,627
- When the state owns your ass,

867
00:43:38,627 --> 00:43:40,923
you gotta dance till
the state's please you.

868
00:43:40,923 --> 00:43:41,834
(chuckles)

869
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:43,417
Gotta light her up.

870
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:51,082
(laughs)

871
00:43:52,616 --> 00:43:53,593
Woo!

872
00:43:53,593 --> 00:43:54,827
Woo.

873
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:57,160
Well, hello there, children.

874
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:00,463
My name is Larry.

875
00:44:00,463 --> 00:44:02,998
- That's Hansel and I'm Gretel, okay?

876
00:44:02,998 --> 00:44:05,993
- Well, ain't that fucking cute?

877
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:09,826
Looks like I got me some
traveling companions!

878
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:12,882
(barks)

879
00:44:12,882 --> 00:44:14,964
(laughs)

880
00:44:14,964 --> 00:44:17,455
Do you have any money?

881
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:19,825
- What do you wanna know
if we got any money for?

882
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:22,011
- Just so happens that I have something

883
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:23,953
in my little bag of tricks here

884
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,407
that might appeal to
the lady of the house,

885
00:44:26,407 --> 00:44:30,477
some genuine rock,
cocaine from California.

886
00:44:30,477 --> 00:44:32,767
- We don't need your shit, mister.

887
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:36,934
- Just trying to be friendly
and see what I can get.

888
00:44:38,094 --> 00:44:41,677
But in the end, I'm
gonna take what I need.

889
00:44:42,705 --> 00:44:45,419
- You mean you're gonna
take what you want?

890
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:47,974
- You are a smart girl.

891
00:44:47,974 --> 00:44:49,914
Ain't she smart?

892
00:44:49,914 --> 00:44:51,909
You got a smart mouth too, don't you?!

893
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:54,083
Got a little smart mouth!

894
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:56,649
Why don't we get your
spick brother over here,

895
00:44:56,649 --> 00:44:59,192
pull down them little smarty pants,

896
00:44:59,192 --> 00:45:02,783
you can get down on them
wobbly wet knees of yours.

897
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,033
Yeah, suck my big fucking--

898
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:06,992
(loud thud)

899
00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:08,522
(groans)

900
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:10,430
(loud thuds)

901
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,597
(groaning)
(loud thuds)

902
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:36,520
- Goddamn!

903
00:45:37,897 --> 00:45:40,147
(laughing)

904
00:45:44,252 --> 00:45:47,524
- Oh, man, let's go
through his fucking shit!

905
00:45:47,524 --> 00:45:50,524
(mellow rock music)

906
00:45:56,983 --> 00:45:58,510
Finally!

907
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,301
Man, it's a good fucking
thing he went for his pecker

908
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,918
instead of these two things.

909
00:46:02,918 --> 00:46:07,085
- Yeah, it's good thing
he's so fucking stupid, man!

910
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:18,734
- Oh yes.

911
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,637
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, indeed.

912
00:46:20,637 --> 00:46:23,671
I believe we have some crack cocaine.

913
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:25,595
He was one fun guy, huh?

914
00:46:25,595 --> 00:46:27,012
- Yeah, real fun.

915
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:35,602
- Watch out, I think he shit himself.

916
00:46:46,254 --> 00:46:49,175
- I have never been able
to take that guy on my own.

917
00:46:49,175 --> 00:46:51,803
And if I had had another
man touching me again,

918
00:46:51,803 --> 00:46:55,968
I don't think I would've
been able to stand it.

919
00:46:55,968 --> 00:46:59,551
I'm never gonna forget
you fighting for me.

920
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:04,976
The other person's ever fought
for me was Sister Gomez.

921
00:47:13,545 --> 00:47:15,174
(sighs)

922
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:17,376
You sleep good, nina.

923
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,399
Your angel Cyclona's
watching over you tonight.

924
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:21,977
(bell tolling)

925
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:24,644
(train hissing)

926
00:47:31,399 --> 00:47:35,399
(suspenseful synthesizer music)

927
00:47:42,553 --> 00:47:44,970
(loud clank)

928
00:47:55,588 --> 00:47:57,488
- Thought I lost you.

929
00:47:57,488 --> 00:47:58,738
- Check it out.

930
00:48:05,155 --> 00:48:06,113
- That's soup.

931
00:48:06,113 --> 00:48:07,030
- Right on.

932
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:10,844
I got some smokes, some change.

933
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:25,633
- So who'd you kill this time?

934
00:48:25,633 --> 00:48:29,082
- Some kind of nightwatchman or something.

935
00:48:29,082 --> 00:48:30,832
He was gonna rape me.

936
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,707
Wanna eat now?

937
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:40,592
(ethereal synthesizer music)

938
00:49:02,993 --> 00:49:04,243
I'm so thirsty!

939
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:09,637
It feels like somebody took a
big, greasy shit in my mouth!

940
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,464
- Real nice, Cyclona.

941
00:49:13,338 --> 00:49:15,671
Here, have some more whisky.

942
00:49:18,606 --> 00:49:22,356
- I'm really starting
to hate this stuff now.

943
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:42,069
- Gonna die if this train don't stop soon.

944
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:43,297
- Oh shit.

945
00:49:43,297 --> 00:49:46,217
Oh Lord, please, please
protect us from all the wicked

946
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,366
and miserable people
lurking in the shadows,

947
00:49:48,366 --> 00:49:50,408
seeking to harm me and
my bunkie, White Girl.

948
00:49:50,408 --> 00:49:52,913
Oh holy Christian
protector, Saint Barbara,

949
00:49:52,913 --> 00:49:55,233
do not permit any
interruption on our journey.

950
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:57,990
And please intercede on our
behalf against the police

951
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,996
with their guns and their helicopters,

952
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:00,964
and their wicked thoughts

953
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,135
and their motherfucking evil intentions.

954
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,325
And protect us from all harm.

955
00:50:05,325 --> 00:50:06,388
Amen.

956
00:50:06,388 --> 00:50:10,555
(ethereal synthesizer and drum music)

957
00:50:29,731 --> 00:50:32,314
(bell tolling)

958
00:50:37,598 --> 00:50:39,040
- [White Girl] All right, let's do it.

959
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,418
What?

960
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:41,566
- I'm not going out there!

961
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:43,679
- Ah shit, what is your problem?

962
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,887
- Sister Gomez came to see me last night.

963
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,868
- Look, would you just
get off the goddamn train?

964
00:50:47,868 --> 00:50:49,375
- She told me how this train's taking us

965
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:50,597
to a place of safety.

966
00:50:50,597 --> 00:50:52,309
And how if we get off, we're
gonna be totally fucked

967
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:53,654
and our souls are gonna belong to Satan.

968
00:50:53,654 --> 00:50:55,176
- This train's been rolling for days.

969
00:50:55,176 --> 00:50:57,154
I mean, they gotta stop to crew changes

970
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,912
or change the fucking gas,
whatever the fuck it is they do!

971
00:50:59,912 --> 00:51:02,613
- Yeah, but what if we
can't find our way back?!

972
00:51:02,613 --> 00:51:06,067
- Cyclona, don't worry about it, okay?

973
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:07,150
I got a plan.

974
00:51:15,095 --> 00:51:16,447
- You know, these rocks are worthy money.

975
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:18,839
I mean, you could've
sold them to some kids.

976
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:20,556
- Yeah, but we need a stash of crack

977
00:51:20,556 --> 00:51:23,747
like we need a case of the shits.

978
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,119
Besides, I like robbing tricks.

979
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,245
It's easier.

980
00:51:28,245 --> 00:51:31,186
A lot more satisfying too.

981
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:34,269
- Hey White Girl, I found some water!

982
00:51:41,103 --> 00:51:42,646
Why is it all fishy?

983
00:51:42,646 --> 00:51:44,479
Tastes like motor oil.

984
00:51:45,377 --> 00:51:47,386
- 'Cause it's bad.

985
00:51:47,386 --> 00:51:48,219
Blech!

986
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:50,591
Wash it down with some of that.

987
00:51:50,591 --> 00:51:53,258
Maybe it'll help kill the germs.

988
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:57,018
- Can we go back now, please?

989
00:51:57,018 --> 00:52:00,190
We're gonna get all sick
from this bad dog water.

990
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,036
- [White Girl] Come on.

991
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:05,203
(upbeat guitar and harmonica music)

992
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:19,745
- [Cyclona] All the rocks are gone.

993
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:21,198
What do you think
could've happened to them?

994
00:52:21,198 --> 00:52:22,729
- [White Girl] Just calm down, okay?

995
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:23,782
- Well, where are they?

996
00:52:23,782 --> 00:52:24,914
- How about they're around the corner

997
00:52:24,914 --> 00:52:26,445
and not be a butt, Cyclona?

998
00:52:26,445 --> 00:52:27,770
- We're totally fucked.

999
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,661
We're totally fucked.

1000
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:29,494
We're doomed.

1001
00:52:29,494 --> 00:52:30,494
- Holy shit.

1002
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:34,766
Just shut your mouth already, okay?!

1003
00:52:34,766 --> 00:52:35,698
God!

1004
00:52:35,698 --> 00:52:38,072
If you can keep from
being completely crazy,

1005
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,180
then I promise you everything

1006
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,034
will be okay, all right?!
- I got the mark of the beast

1007
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:43,582
and now they're gonna put me
in one of their cages for sure!

1008
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:44,826
- [White Girl] Come look at me.

1009
00:52:44,826 --> 00:52:45,935
Stop running around!

1010
00:52:45,935 --> 00:52:47,265
- I can't, I got the walkies.

1011
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:49,462
I got the walkies and I just can't stop!

1012
00:52:49,462 --> 00:52:51,319
- [White Girl] Look,
you've lots of time, okay?!

1013
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:53,737
- If I get pinched, you
gotta kill me first, okay?

1014
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:54,718
You can't let them get to me!

1015
00:52:54,718 --> 00:52:57,061
- I won't let them get you, okay?

1016
00:52:57,061 --> 00:52:59,186
- Swear to me that you'll
kill me first, okay?

1017
00:52:59,186 --> 00:53:01,103
Otherwise, you can just go fuck yourself!

1018
00:53:01,103 --> 00:53:03,170
- Look, I swear!

1019
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,253
I'll kill you, I promise.

1020
00:53:07,222 --> 00:53:09,033
Let's get the fuck outta here!

1021
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:12,700
(ominous synthesizer music)

1022
00:53:15,749 --> 00:53:17,437
- It's the border patrol!

1023
00:53:17,437 --> 00:53:19,377
That must be Mexico down there!

1024
00:53:19,377 --> 00:53:22,130
I told you that train was
taking us some place special.

1025
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,630
(siren wails)

1026
00:53:27,419 --> 00:53:28,916
- Hey officer, what's up?

1027
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,503
- The hell you girls doing out here?

1028
00:53:30,503 --> 00:53:31,336
(gun clicks)
- Don't move!

1029
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:32,682
Don't you fucking move!

1030
00:53:32,682 --> 00:53:33,772
- Take it easy.

1031
00:53:33,772 --> 00:53:35,425
- Get their guns.

1032
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:38,051
Yo, put your hands behind your head now!

1033
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:40,724
You wanna get shot, goddammit?

1034
00:53:40,724 --> 00:53:42,572
- Let me have your backup!

1035
00:53:42,572 --> 00:53:44,086
- I don't have a--
- All you puto crackers

1036
00:53:44,086 --> 00:53:45,694
all have backups, I've seen it on TV!

1037
00:53:45,694 --> 00:53:46,534
Now let me have it!
- Listen, I don't

1038
00:53:46,534 --> 00:53:47,367
have a backup.

1039
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:50,517
I don't--
(gun firing)

1040
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:51,350
- No!

1041
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:55,683
- You're such a pussy, White Girl.

1042
00:53:55,683 --> 00:53:56,975
See, he could've raped us with that--

1043
00:53:56,975 --> 00:53:59,298
- See, I'm gonna kill you for that!

1044
00:53:59,298 --> 00:54:01,904
(loud thuds)
Get on up, you psycho bitch!

1045
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:03,832
Get on up so I can fucking kill you!

1046
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:08,501
(screaming)
Get on up, you fucking psycho!

1047
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:12,001
(police radio chattering)

1048
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:22,234
(ominous synthesizer music)

1049
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:23,480
You see that?

1050
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,547
- [Cyclona] If we stay here,
our lives are over, White Girl.

1051
00:54:26,547 --> 00:54:28,427
We gotta go to Mexico right now.

1052
00:54:28,427 --> 00:54:30,344
Are you ready for that?

1053
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:33,647
- Yeah.

1054
00:54:34,594 --> 00:54:35,973
Let's do it.

1055
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:38,723
(sirens wailing)

1056
00:54:46,749 --> 00:54:47,863
Come on!

1057
00:54:47,863 --> 00:54:50,113
Come on, give me your hand.

1058
00:54:55,277 --> 00:54:57,242
- Oh, we're here!

1059
00:54:57,242 --> 00:54:59,357
Oh, we're actually here!

1060
00:54:59,357 --> 00:55:00,905
- Man, what do you think, the
law ain't gonna be after us

1061
00:55:00,905 --> 00:55:03,004
just 'cause we're in Mexico?!

1062
00:55:03,004 --> 00:55:06,171
- [Cyclona] Trust me, it
ain't gonna be like up north!

1063
00:55:06,171 --> 00:55:07,004
- Come on.

1064
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,187
- God.

1065
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:14,687
Really beat the shit outta me, White Girl.

1066
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:17,209
My face still hurts.

1067
00:55:18,547 --> 00:55:20,506
- Couldn't do worse.

1068
00:55:20,506 --> 00:55:23,235
What were you thinking
going off like that?

1069
00:55:23,235 --> 00:55:24,850
- I wasn't thinking.

1070
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:25,933
I was coming.

1071
00:55:29,355 --> 00:55:31,394
I must've got off five or six times.

1072
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:32,227
- Ah God.

1073
00:55:33,186 --> 00:55:34,019
Ah Jesus.

1074
00:55:35,345 --> 00:55:37,067
- I'm a big pervert, huh?

1075
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,529
- I really don't wanna hear it, okay?

1076
00:55:39,529 --> 00:55:42,534
- Made my chocha so wet,
even through the Stelazine.

1077
00:55:42,534 --> 00:55:43,946
And let me tell you, it's hard getting wet

1078
00:55:43,946 --> 00:55:46,231
behind that Stelazine shit.

1079
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:47,648
- Better shut up.

1080
00:55:48,951 --> 00:55:49,933
- Why am I like that?

1081
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:52,074
- 'Cause you're a piece of shit.

1082
00:55:52,074 --> 00:55:53,074
Now shut up.

1083
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,689
How much money you get
off of them old people?

1084
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,136
- Who me?

1085
00:56:00,136 --> 00:56:02,728
- How much, goddammit?

1086
00:56:02,728 --> 00:56:03,811
- $400 maybe.

1087
00:56:05,374 --> 00:56:07,586
- When were you planning on telling me?

1088
00:56:07,586 --> 00:56:09,144
- I don't know, I woulda though.

1089
00:56:09,144 --> 00:56:10,311
- Yeah, right.

1090
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:14,875
How well you know this shithole, Cyclona?

1091
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:17,125
- Hey, I know Tijuana like I know myself.

1092
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,611
And it ain't a shithole!

1093
00:56:18,611 --> 00:56:20,694
Shouldn't be so negative.

1094
00:56:28,443 --> 00:56:30,871

This is your country now, White Girl.

1108
00:57:19,724 --> 00:57:21,092
You gotta look at her.

1109
00:57:21,092 --> 00:57:22,920
You gotta look at her, you gotta love her.

1110
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,488
Now, come on, let's get something to eat.

1111
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:27,378
And no barfing 'cause you
don't need to do that no more.

1112

Tijuana tomorrow, White Girl.

1115
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:38,856
We'll buy some new clothes.

1116
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:40,459
We'll get our hair done.

1117
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:43,498
We'll have a really nice lunch.

1118
00:57:43,498 --> 00:57:44,581
Check it out.

1119
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,709
Gonna go for it?

1120
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:54,837
- Well, I figured I'd do
the usual number on them.

1121
00:57:54,837 --> 00:57:55,887
- Oh, come on.

1122
00:57:55,887 --> 00:57:57,387

- Yeah, feels good.

1135
00:58:49,352 --> 00:58:50,750
- What are you thinking about?

1136
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:54,417
- I haven't been fucked
in nearly two years.

1137
00:58:56,427 --> 00:58:59,240
- Maybe you'll like the guys in Mexico.

1138
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,107
I mean, they got nice manners.

1139
00:59:02,107 --> 00:59:04,127
I guess they're kinda cute.

1140
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:05,750
- Nah, it won't work.

1141
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,667
I only date black guys.

1142
00:59:10,315 --> 00:59:12,739
- How come you only date black guys?

1143
00:59:12,739 --> 00:59:14,572
- Both hate white men.

escaped from custody

01:05:02,404 --> 01:05:03,987
I can't believe it!

1240
01:05:07,043 --> 01:05:09,210
(tapping)

1241
01:05:10,993 --> 01:05:11,928
(grunts)

1242
01:05:11,928 --> 01:05:13,260
We're looking for Sister Gomez.

1243
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,338
(growling)

1244
01:05:15,338 --> 01:05:16,790
(loud thud)
Don't fuck with me

1245
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:19,367
or I'll kick your monkey
ass all over the street!

1246
01:05:19,367 --> 01:05:20,200
(loud whack)
Now where is she?

1247
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,204
- Sister Gomez deliver message tonight!

1248
01:05:24,204 --> 01:05:25,619
You come later!

1249
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:26,452
Later!
(loud thud)

1250
01:05:26,452 --> 01:05:27,285
(groans)

1251
01:05:27,285 --> 01:05:28,954
(speaks in foreign language)

1252
01:05:28,954 --> 01:05:30,243
(grunts)
(groans)

1253
01:05:30,243 --> 01:05:31,076
(loud thud)

1254
01:05:31,076 --> 01:05:32,003
(groans)

1255
01:05:32,003 --> 01:05:34,708
- Look around, is sleepy.

1256
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,411
(speaking in foreign language)

1257
01:05:36,411 --> 01:05:37,411
Go to sleep.

1258
01:05:45,898 --> 01:05:47,815
Go to bed, little mice.

1259
01:05:49,189 --> 01:05:51,835
- Oh my God, Sister Gomez.

1260
01:05:51,835 --> 01:05:52,668
It's me.

1261
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:55,341
Angela Garcia.

1262
01:05:55,341 --> 01:05:56,872
Don't you remember me?

1263
01:05:56,872 --> 01:05:57,705
- Is you?

1264
01:06:00,142 --> 01:06:01,948
My little movie star.

1265
01:06:01,948 --> 01:06:03,615
Where have you been?

1266
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,570
- She used to call me
her little movie star

1267
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,070
when I was little.

1268
01:06:10,963 --> 01:06:15,130
- Hi, my name is Crystal,
mostly called White Girl.

1269
01:06:17,044 --> 01:06:18,560
- Check it out.

1270
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,717
She's looking into your soul.

1271
01:06:21,717 --> 01:06:26,017
- You have a demon inside
you, little gringa.

1272
01:06:26,017 --> 01:06:28,767
And your demon is a hungry demon,

1273
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:34,167
which is never ever satisfied.

1274
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:39,215
- Told you she'd take care of your shit.

1275
01:06:39,215 --> 01:06:41,882
- And your demon is angry demon,

1276
01:06:43,518 --> 01:06:47,685
which is thirsty for the
blood of the human being.

1277
01:06:49,084 --> 01:06:50,129
- Can you help me?

1278
01:06:50,129 --> 01:06:51,683
Can you intercede with Saint Jude

1279
01:06:51,683 --> 01:06:53,502
and make my life bearable again?

1280
01:06:53,502 --> 01:06:55,684
- Oh, si, si, si,

1281
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:59,101
but first, you no bring something for me?

1282
01:07:01,835 --> 01:07:05,629
- This is all we've got right
now, but we can get more.

1283
01:07:05,629 --> 01:07:07,962
I beseech you, Sister Gomez.

1284
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:10,386
We need a place of sanctuary

1285
01:07:10,386 --> 01:07:13,903
where we'll be safe from the police.

1286
01:07:13,903 --> 01:07:16,153
- You run from the policia?

1287
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:21,274
You have done many, many
bad things, my child,

1288
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:23,996
but I saw your demon.

1289
01:07:25,081 --> 01:07:26,824
- When can you start?

1290
01:07:26,824 --> 01:07:29,907
- Your demon must be kept in bondage,

1291
01:07:30,841 --> 01:07:33,174
and you will suffer greatly,

1292
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:36,574
but when we finish,

1293
01:07:36,574 --> 01:07:40,741
your demon will go back to his
true home, in the darkness.

1294
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:45,514
- What about my bunkie, White Girl?

1295
01:07:45,514 --> 01:07:48,987
- Your little gringa's
friend is a hungry demon.

1296
01:07:48,987 --> 01:07:49,987
Must be fed.

1297
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:53,425
Mucho, mucho, mucho.

1298
01:07:53,425 --> 01:07:55,956
And when it is satisfied
and off his guard,

1299
01:07:55,956 --> 01:07:58,816
we can send it into the darkness too.

1300
01:07:58,816 --> 01:08:00,442
- I don't know, Sister.

1301
01:08:00,442 --> 01:08:02,660
Her demon can eat so much.

1302
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,654
You gotta see it to believe it.

1303
01:08:04,654 --> 01:08:06,644
- Trust Sister Gomez.

1304
01:08:06,644 --> 01:08:08,311
She know what to do.

1305
01:08:09,707 --> 01:08:11,525
- The little mice come to me

1306
01:08:11,525 --> 01:08:14,873
with the hunger in their tummies.

1307
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:17,956
I feed them with many cakes and pies.

1308
01:08:19,616 --> 01:08:21,949
I know I ask nothing for me.

1309
01:08:23,084 --> 01:08:27,361
To keep their tummies
full cost mucho dinero.

1310
01:08:27,361 --> 01:08:29,515
- We can make so much money.

1311
01:08:29,515 --> 01:08:30,786
- Not you.

1312
01:08:30,786 --> 01:08:34,213
You must stay within these walls

1313
01:08:34,213 --> 01:08:38,296
once sexo season begins,
my pretty, pretty bunny.

1314
01:08:42,155 --> 01:08:44,768
- White Girl could get you the money.

1315
01:08:44,768 --> 01:08:47,004
You could do that, couldn't you?

1316
01:08:47,004 --> 01:08:47,837
- I guess.

1317
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:51,170
(upbeat mariachi music)

1318
01:09:01,783 --> 01:09:05,616
(singing in foreign language)

1319
01:09:11,544 --> 01:09:12,377
(speaking in foreign language)

1320
01:09:12,377 --> 01:09:16,829
- Oh, hey, Mr. Mexican, wanna
get some frenching going?

1321
01:09:16,829 --> 01:09:19,730
- Gringa, (speaking in foreign language).

1322
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:21,096
- Si, Americano.

1323
01:09:21,096 --> 01:09:22,717
Muy bueno.

1324
01:09:22,717 --> 01:09:25,151
(speaking in foreign language)

1325
01:09:25,151 --> 01:09:27,762
- Oh yeah, blonde pussy,

1326
01:09:27,762 --> 01:09:30,550
all soft and wet and yummy.

1327
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:32,473
Taste just like candy.

1328
01:09:32,473 --> 01:09:36,884
Oh, and I need something
to put inside it so bad!

1329
01:09:36,884 --> 01:09:39,410
(speaking in foreign language)

1330
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:40,931
Dick sucked?

1331
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:42,512
- Si, dick suck.

1332
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,954
- Dick sucked.

1333
01:09:43,954 --> 01:09:45,349
- Dick suck.

1334
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:47,105
- Oh, si, si!
(speaking in foreign language)

1335
01:09:47,105 --> 01:09:49,066
I'll light your motherfucking nose up!

1336
01:09:49,066 --> 01:09:50,066
Come on now.

1337
01:09:58,112 --> 01:10:00,845
(loud whacks)

1338
01:10:00,845 --> 01:10:03,840
(loud whack)

1339
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,007
(loud whack)
(loud thud)

1340
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,647
(loud thuds)
(groaning)

1341
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:34,402
- So, how's a little gal from up north

1342
01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:37,152
end up turning tricks in Tijuana?

1343
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:42,502
- Well, just 'cause I like
sucking strange dick so much.

1344
01:10:44,803 --> 01:10:45,899
- [Man] Boy, you're just a little--

1345
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:47,133
(gun fires)
Aren't ya?

1346
01:10:47,133 --> 01:10:48,061
- [White Girl] Mm-hm!

1347
01:10:48,061 --> 01:10:50,308
(gun fires)

1348
01:10:50,308 --> 01:10:53,505
Okay, now let me see your wiener!

1349
01:10:53,505 --> 01:10:55,174
(loud whack)

1350
01:10:55,174 --> 01:10:56,036
(loud thud)

1351
01:10:56,036 --> 01:10:58,119
(groans)

1352
01:11:13,212 --> 01:11:15,462
(knocking)

1353
01:11:22,523 --> 01:11:27,160
- Oh, you are very good at
the making of the money, no?

1354
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,754
- Huh, yeah, had a lot of practice.

1355
01:11:29,754 --> 01:11:32,650
- How much you keep for yourself?

1356
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:34,294
- [White Girl] About $300.

1357
01:11:34,294 --> 01:11:36,782
- You think it's right
you keep this money?

1358
01:11:36,782 --> 01:11:39,949
(gentle guitar music)

1359
01:11:43,862 --> 01:11:48,183
- I'll bust you open like
a goddamn watermelon.

1360
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:51,442
- Come, sit down, little gringa.

1361
01:11:51,442 --> 01:11:52,436
It's time now.

1362
01:11:52,436 --> 01:11:56,388
(speaks in foreign language)

1363
01:11:56,388 --> 01:11:59,951
This is for you and your hungry demon.

1364
01:11:59,951 --> 01:12:01,258
- Where's Cyclona?

1365
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:02,646
- You just think about

1366
01:12:02,646 --> 01:12:04,836
the wonderful (speaks
in foreign language).

1367
01:12:04,836 --> 01:12:06,586
Sweet, creamy butter,

1368
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,720
fresh milk from a jet black goat,

1369
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,161
the finest pork,

1370
01:12:14,136 --> 01:12:16,803
the rarest red and green chilis,

1371
01:12:17,768 --> 01:12:19,435
and my special flan.

1372
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:28,173
Shows from (speaks in foreign language).

1373
01:12:28,173 --> 01:12:29,814
In ingles.

1374
01:12:29,814 --> 01:12:31,064
- Thanks a lot.

1375
01:13:10,424 --> 01:13:12,228
- [News Anchor] Authorities
now believe the two escapees

1376
01:13:12,228 --> 01:13:13,873
from the California Youth Authority,

1377
01:13:13,873 --> 01:13:16,057
Angela Garcia and Crystal Van Meter,

1378
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:17,451
are responsible for the shooting deaths

1379
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:21,404
of those two INS agents
outside of San Diego yesterday.

1380
01:13:21,404 --> 01:13:22,985
- [Mr. Butz] I have no doubt

1381
01:13:22,985 --> 01:13:25,283
that my client will be exonerated,

1382
01:13:25,283 --> 01:13:28,559
that she was last week
by the Court of Appeals.

1383
01:13:28,559 --> 01:13:30,935
- [Reporter] Have you heard
from Crystal since her escape?

1384
01:13:30,935 --> 01:13:31,768
- [Mr. Butz] No, I have not.

1385
01:13:31,768 --> 01:13:32,601
- [Reporter] In the hope your client

1386
01:13:32,601 --> 01:13:33,800
is watching this program,

1387
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,115
is there anything you'd
like to say to her?

1388
01:13:36,115 --> 01:13:39,690
- Crystal, baby, sister
came through for us, girl.

1389
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,525
(chuckles)

1390
01:13:40,525 --> 01:13:41,827
Come on home now!

1391
01:13:41,827 --> 01:13:44,491
It's time to stop
running, turn yourself in!

1392
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:46,664
Don't do this to yourself, baby.

1393
01:13:46,664 --> 01:13:48,523
Let's let the healing begin, okay?

1394
01:13:48,523 --> 01:13:49,520
Anymore questions?

1395
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,225
All right, get the camera
outta my face, man.

1396
01:13:51,225 --> 01:13:52,941
- No--
(TV clicks)

1397
01:13:52,941 --> 01:13:56,827
- You enjoy my sweet pork, little gringa?

1398
01:13:56,827 --> 01:13:58,346
- Right now, I wanna see Cyclona,

1399
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:00,533
so let's cut the bullshit, okay?

1400
01:14:00,533 --> 01:14:03,773
- She struggling to save her soul.

1401
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,278
You no see her now.

1402
01:14:05,278 --> 01:14:07,576
- Shit.
- I clean up here.

1403
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:09,530
We have big day tomorrow.

1404
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:10,901
- What's up for tomorrow?

1405
01:14:10,901 --> 01:14:15,830
- You must continue to feed,
but you must no throw up.

1406
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:18,498
- You want me to eat like this everyday?

1407
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:21,169
- Then the demon will be careless

1408
01:14:21,169 --> 01:14:24,832
and stick his head out from your tummy.

1409
01:14:24,832 --> 01:14:28,793
And we can pull on his head
till he's out of your stomach.

1410
01:14:28,793 --> 01:14:31,060
- How much weight are
we talking about here?

1411
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,805
- Many kilos.

1412
01:14:32,805 --> 01:14:35,888
But many senors like the heavy woman,

1413
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,147
so choose to be prostitute.

1414
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:41,580
Come, little gringa.

1415
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,169
You must go on the scale.

1416
01:14:43,169 --> 01:14:45,169
(burps)

1417
01:14:46,187 --> 01:14:47,974
(groans)

1418
01:14:47,974 --> 01:14:49,974
(burps)

1419
01:14:52,183 --> 01:14:54,183
(burps)

1420
01:14:56,987 --> 01:14:58,676
Come, hungry one.

1421
01:14:58,676 --> 01:15:00,380
(burps)

1422
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,579
- You know, back in jail,

1423
01:15:01,579 --> 01:15:05,203
I got kinda allergic to having
people tell me what to eat

1424
01:15:05,203 --> 01:15:07,749
and weigh me out like some kind an animal.

1425
01:15:07,749 --> 01:15:11,916
- [Sister Gomez] You know what
may help, little hungry one?

1426
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,983
- I don't wanna be bulimic no more.

1427
01:15:17,983 --> 01:15:21,733
(ethereal synthesizer music)

1428
01:15:25,182 --> 01:15:27,170
I just wanna be pretty.

1429
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:28,003
- Oh.

1430
01:15:29,397 --> 01:15:31,536
(speaks in foreign language)

1431
01:15:31,536 --> 01:15:32,869
Go on the scale.

1432
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,993
Good.

1433
01:15:41,138 --> 01:15:42,011
Flacco?

1434
01:15:42,011 --> 01:15:43,555
- [Flacco] Si.

1435
01:15:43,555 --> 01:15:45,991
- Flacco will take you to your room.

1436
01:15:45,991 --> 01:15:48,974
He will give you some water and vinegar,

1437
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:51,895
and you can clean your
little white chocha.

1438
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:53,938
(Flacco speaks in foreign language)

1439
01:15:53,938 --> 01:15:56,380
- Hey, I didn't fuck
nobody out there, okay?

1440
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:00,130
(speaks in foreign language)

1441
01:16:01,885 --> 01:16:03,635
I didn't fuck nobody!

1442
01:16:06,519 --> 01:16:07,352
Hey!
(lock clicks)

1443
01:16:07,352 --> 01:16:09,019
Hey, what the hell?!

1444
01:16:14,121 --> 01:16:16,121
(gasps)

1445
01:16:19,518 --> 01:16:21,685
(gurgles)

1446
01:16:29,624 --> 01:16:31,791
(heaving)

1447
01:16:45,323 --> 01:16:48,091
- The gringo was seen
last night at La Adelitas.

1448
01:16:48,091 --> 01:16:51,176
Many men reported being
robbed by a young Americana,

1449
01:16:51,176 --> 01:16:54,878
promising a night of very, very good sex.

1450
01:16:54,878 --> 01:16:57,869
- We'd like to be part
of your investigation.

1451
01:16:57,869 --> 01:16:59,627
- We'll show you how we treat

1452
01:16:59,627 --> 01:17:01,309
the criminals here in Mexico, huh?

1453
01:17:01,309 --> 01:17:02,142
- Wait, hold up.

1454
01:17:02,142 --> 01:17:03,333
What, you just gonna shoot them?

1455
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:04,819
- Do you want no shoot?

1456
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:06,917
- No, we don't wanna shoot.

1457
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:07,944
- I'm carrying a weapon.

1458
01:17:07,944 --> 01:17:08,777
You got a problem with that?

1459
01:17:08,777 --> 01:17:09,652
- Si.

1460
01:17:09,652 --> 01:17:11,652
It's passable, you know?

1461
01:17:12,746 --> 01:17:13,579
No problem.

1462
01:17:13,579 --> 01:17:15,829
(chuckles)

1463
01:17:25,622 --> 01:17:28,872
(Sister Gomez humming)

1464
01:17:30,118 --> 01:17:32,380
- [White Girl] Why'd you
lock me up last night?

1465
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:36,547
- [Sister Gomez] It is muy
necessary to contain your demon.

1466
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:42,585
- Look, lady, I wanna see
Cyclona, and I wanna see her now.

1467
01:17:42,585 --> 01:17:46,031
- Tonight, you can bring more
(speaks in foreign language),

1468
01:17:46,031 --> 01:17:49,942
then I make you my delicious tamales.

1469
01:17:49,942 --> 01:17:53,079
They are the finest in all of Baha.

1470
01:17:53,079 --> 01:17:55,990
- Why can't you talk
straight for just one second?

1471
01:17:55,990 --> 01:18:00,299
- Why you care so much for my baby Angela?

1472
01:18:00,299 --> 01:18:03,506
There's nothing you can do for her.

1473
01:18:03,506 --> 01:18:05,756
Why you not just walk away?

1474
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:08,115
- Mm.

1475
01:18:11,003 --> 01:18:14,253
'Cause I feel like I owe her something.

1476
01:18:15,178 --> 01:18:17,216
(clapping)

1477
01:18:17,216 --> 01:18:19,281
- Gracias, gracias, (speaks
in foreign language).

1478
01:18:19,281 --> 01:18:20,900
Gracias.

1479
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:24,067
We are Mexicanos, beloved of the Gods.

1480
01:18:26,111 --> 01:18:30,278
We have the second sight, which
no other people possesses.

1481
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,797
We see backwards and forward in the time.

1482
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,020
And we know in the most natural properties

1483
01:18:42,255 --> 01:18:44,672
that everything is connected,

1484
01:18:47,685 --> 01:18:49,685
our future and our past.

1485
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:53,292
(clapping)

1486
01:18:56,283 --> 01:18:57,873
- How you like my country, senor?

1487
01:18:57,873 --> 01:19:00,290
- There sure a lot of whores.

1488
01:19:01,841 --> 01:19:02,894
There she is.

1489
01:19:02,894 --> 01:19:03,727
- [Crefilo] Let's do it.

1490
01:19:03,727 --> 01:19:07,217
- No, no, we wait, senor,
because there's two criminals.

1491
01:19:07,217 --> 01:19:10,473
We watch, we follow,
then we catch them both.

1492
01:19:10,473 --> 01:19:12,199
- Here she comes.

1493
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:13,151
- [Officer] Now she rob him.

1494
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,856
- That has not been established as fact.

1495
01:19:15,856 --> 01:19:17,023
- Yeah, right.

1496
01:19:18,688 --> 01:19:20,521
- It's true, we watch.

1497
01:19:25,968 --> 01:19:26,801
- Oh.

1498
01:19:26,801 --> 01:19:27,831
Gracias.

1499
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:28,896
Adios.

1500
01:19:28,896 --> 01:19:29,740
Gracias.

1501
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,880
Muy mucho, mucho gracias, senor.

1502
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,047
Mucho gracias.

1503
01:19:44,885 --> 01:19:47,135
(knocking)

1504
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,964
(speaking in foreign language)

1505
01:19:54,964 --> 01:19:55,797
(door clacks)

1506
01:19:55,797 --> 01:19:57,211
- (speaks in foreign language), senor.

1507
01:19:57,211 --> 01:20:00,287
First, we go for the backup, okay?

1508
01:20:00,287 --> 01:20:02,967
(speaking in foreign language)

1509
01:20:02,967 --> 01:20:04,967
(sighs)

1510
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,468
- You bring something for me?

1511
01:20:09,622 --> 01:20:10,455
Oh.

1512
01:20:11,964 --> 01:20:14,222
(sighs)

1513
01:20:14,222 --> 01:20:16,222
(sighs)

1514
01:20:17,262 --> 01:20:18,095
Money?

1515
01:20:21,603 --> 01:20:24,853
- [White Girl] Where'd all the kids go?

1516
01:20:26,114 --> 01:20:27,947
- No more little mice.

1517
01:20:49,768 --> 01:20:51,768
(gasps)

1518
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:03,535
(ominous synthesizer music)

1519
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:05,952
(whimpering)

1520
01:21:37,134 --> 01:21:41,538
(speaking in foreign language)

1521
01:21:41,538 --> 01:21:43,581
(yelling in foreign language)

1522
01:21:43,581 --> 01:21:47,748
- Go!
(yelling in foreign language)

1523
01:21:50,932 --> 01:21:52,282
(yelling in foreign language)

1524
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:56,365
Go!
(yelling in foreign language)

1525
01:22:14,047 --> 01:22:17,964
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1526
01:22:24,075 --> 01:22:24,908
Oh shit.

1527
01:22:33,453 --> 01:22:34,526
Just hold on.

1528
01:22:34,526 --> 01:22:35,920
White Girl. It's me.
(whimpering)

1529
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,061
It's me, White Girl, Cyclona.

1530
01:22:38,061 --> 01:22:38,894
Calm down.

1531
01:22:39,786 --> 01:22:40,619
Calm down.

1532
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,173
Okay, it's okay.

1533
01:22:52,655 --> 01:22:53,580
Shh.

1534
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,922
Shh.

1535
01:22:54,922 --> 01:22:56,145
Shh.
(whimpering)

1536
01:22:56,145 --> 01:22:57,103
Come here.

1537
01:22:57,103 --> 01:22:57,936
Come on.

1538
01:22:58,796 --> 01:22:59,629
It's okay.

1539
01:22:59,629 --> 01:23:01,710
(whimpering)

1540
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,712
- She's a cannibal, White Girl.

1541
01:23:04,712 --> 01:23:06,931
She killed these two
kids right in front of me

1542
01:23:06,931 --> 01:23:08,469
and she was gonna feed them to you.

1543
01:23:08,469 --> 01:23:12,479
She was gonna make tamales
(speaking in foreign language).

1544
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:13,529
(groans)

1545
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:15,274
She was gonna try and make you fat,

1546
01:23:15,274 --> 01:23:17,085
and when you couldn't get fat no more,

1547
01:23:17,085 --> 01:23:20,455
she was gonna make you
into gordita tamales.

1548
01:23:20,455 --> 01:23:21,549
(whimpers)

1549
01:23:21,549 --> 01:23:23,836
She beat the fuck outta me with this whip

1550
01:23:23,836 --> 01:23:26,868
and she made me watch all these videos

1551
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:30,674
of all these guys molesting
me when I was little.

1552
01:23:30,674 --> 01:23:33,219
- That's why she always called
you her little movie star.

1553
01:23:33,219 --> 01:23:34,738
That's what you were!

1554
01:23:34,738 --> 01:23:37,576
And all those lights and shit
you're always talking about,

1555
01:23:37,576 --> 01:23:39,956
what do you think all this shit is?!

1556
01:23:39,956 --> 01:23:44,123
That flying saucer and all
those fucking aliens, fuck, man!

1557
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:47,988
Damn, this is where it all started!

1558
01:23:47,988 --> 01:23:50,211
This is where she worked
you so you'd get fucked

1559
01:23:50,211 --> 01:23:53,295
by a bunch of suck ass grownups.

1560
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:57,462
She was making videos and
selling them to perverts.

1561
01:23:59,554 --> 01:24:03,721
You and me are gonna go
upstairs and kill everybody.

1562
01:24:04,974 --> 01:24:06,557
You ready for that?

1563
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:08,489
- I can't.

1564
01:24:08,489 --> 01:24:09,902
I'm scared of her.

1565
01:24:09,902 --> 01:24:12,069
- Don't be scared no more.

1566
01:24:20,016 --> 01:24:22,488
(gun fires)

1567
01:24:22,488 --> 01:24:24,821
(shrieking)

1568
01:24:31,951 --> 01:24:34,701
Come on, get the fuck outta here.

1569
01:24:38,383 --> 01:24:42,439
(speaking in foreign language)

1570
01:24:42,439 --> 01:24:44,606
(panting)

1571
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:49,858
(dog growls)

1572
01:24:53,024 --> 01:24:55,441
(chattering)

1573
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:00,776
(guns click)

1574
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:06,158
(speaking in foreign language)

1575
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:09,216
You people lived way too long.

1576
01:25:09,216 --> 01:25:11,799
- I have lived 1,000 centuries,

1577
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:16,235
and I will live 1,000 more.

1578
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:20,885
You think you are a killer?

1579
01:25:20,885 --> 01:25:23,718
- Bitch, I am a minister of death.

1580
01:25:24,798 --> 01:25:27,957
(upbeat mariachi music)

1581
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:30,457
(guns firing)

1582
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:40,468
(laughing)

1583
01:25:47,751 --> 01:25:49,354
- [Cyclona] Watch out, White Girl!

1584
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:50,485
(gun fires)
(groans)

1585
01:25:50,485 --> 01:25:52,735
(laughing)

1586
01:25:54,601 --> 01:25:57,351
(sirens wailing)

1587
01:26:04,991 --> 01:26:08,181
(loud whack)

1588
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:10,361
- There's your Sister Gomez!

1589
01:26:10,361 --> 01:26:13,404
Fucking a pecker, goddammit!

1590
01:26:13,404 --> 01:26:15,190
She's a man!

1591
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:16,190
She's a man!

1592
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:19,485
- I trusted you so much!

1593
01:26:19,485 --> 01:26:21,056
- My little movie star.

1594
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:22,880

Help me drag this bitch, Cyclona.

(grunts)

1600
01:26:48,568 --> 01:26:51,763
Why'd you kill all them kids, huh?!

1601

Why'd you kill all them kids?!

1602
01:26:54,098 --> 01:26:56,177
Why'd you kill all them kids?!

1603
01:26:56,177 --> 01:27:00,344
- They're muy necessary
for the sexo and the blood.

1604
01:27:01,997 --> 01:27:04,493
- You piece of shit!

1605
01:27:04,493 --> 01:27:07,250
I'm gonna ruin you for
what you did, you hear?!

1606
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,833
I'm gonna ruin you!

She's a cannibal, right?

1609
01:27:17,475 --> 01:27:19,672
- She chopped up them
kids right in front of me

1610
01:27:19,672 --> 01:27:21,645
so she could make them into tamales!

1611

- My baby Angela, you'll
do this thing to me?

1618
01:27:44,104 --> 01:27:47,998
My father, Jupiter, will send many armies

1619
01:27:47,998 --> 01:27:50,913
to put you to your death!

- What a trip, huh?

1625
01:28:22,205 --> 01:28:23,117
- [White Girl] At least now you know

1626
01:28:23,117 --> 01:28:25,200
how you got so fucked up.

1627
01:28:29,207 --> 01:28:30,707
- It was her, huh?

1628
01:28:32,147 --> 01:28:33,473
- She played her part.

1629
01:28:33,473 --> 01:28:36,390
Your fucked up family did the rest.

1630
01:28:40,792 --> 01:28:44,292
It was right to kill your family, Cyclona.

1631
01:28:45,995 --> 01:28:48,828
- Nobody ever told me that before.

1632
01:28:49,684 --> 01:28:53,314
- Once you started, you couldn't stop.

1633
01:28:53,314 --> 01:28:55,374
It's not your fault.

1634
01:28:55,374 --> 01:28:57,448
It's natural what you did.

1635
01:28:57,448 --> 01:28:59,857
I would've done the same.

1639
01:29:04,128 --> 01:29:05,733
What do the pigs want?

1640
01:29:05,733 --> 01:29:08,987
- What do you think they want?

1641
01:29:08,987 --> 01:29:11,387
- Remember what you promised me?

1642
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:13,033
Remember you promised me
that you weren't gonna

1643
01:29:13,033 --> 01:29:15,108
let them put me in one
of their little cages?

- [Officer] Come out with
your hands over your head now!

1645
01:29:18,684 --> 01:29:20,500
- Maybe we can shoot our way out.

1646
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,750
- I don't give a fuck no more, Crystal.

1647
01:29:26,481 --> 01:29:28,682
I'm ready for my new life.

1648
01:29:28,682 --> 01:29:32,384
Maybe in Nueva, La Soloca this time!

Don't worry about it, Crystal.

In my new life, I have wings!

1652
01:30:13,449 --> 01:30:14,749
And claws!

Tell them to put their guns down now.

- You don't escape from here, gringita.

1669

- I know that.

1670
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:58,953
I just wanna talk about a deal.

1671
01:31:58,953 --> 01:32:03,255
You motherfuckers know
how to deal, don't you?

- Many bodies in (speaks

1675

Sister Gomez, she was a man
who was eating human beings.

1676
01:32:36,314 --> 01:32:38,292
She committed suicide in the oven.

1677
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:39,902
- What about the Garcia girl?

1678
01:32:39,902 --> 01:32:42,190
- Shot to death with a
(speaks in foreign language).

1679

But before she die, she make
a declaration of murders,

very innocent, you know?

Hero for a time.

01:32:54,807 --> 01:32:56,573
- You aren't gonna hold her?

1684
01:32:56,573 --> 01:32:57,856

1685
01:32:57,856 --> 01:33:01,985
after promising a night
of very, very good sex,

1686
01:33:01,985 --> 01:33:04,075
you know, they got familias.

1687

They no testify, so there's
no reason to keep her.

I'm okay, how are you?

Hey Detective Dollar.

Hey Detective Crefilo.

How you all doing?

You thirsty?

1696
01:33:20,796 --> 01:33:22,360
You hungry?

1697
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,527
You want something to eat?
