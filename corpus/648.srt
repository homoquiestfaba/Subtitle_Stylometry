1
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,510
Top that off for you, honey?

2
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,352
There you go.

3
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,038
What's in the case?

4
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,037
I'm sorry?

5
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,430
You're always lugging that case
around. I'm curious, what do you sell?

6
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,112
I'm in restaurant supplies.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

7
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,236
You must travel a lot, huh?

8
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,910
Whole country or just hereabouts?

9
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,432
- I don't mean to be rude, but...
- How's your wife feel about it?

10
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,913
- What?
- She must get lonely...

11
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,354
...you gone all the time.

12
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,875
- Look, I...
- Do you get lonely?

13
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,759
You miss fucking her, Harold?

14
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,037
Look, I don't know who you are,
but you can't just sit down...

15
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,277
Did it myself.

16
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,749
Kind of a hobby.

17
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,672
Take a look at these pictures...

18
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,149
...and you tell me if you see
anything you want.

19
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,079
I've got lots more.

20
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,951
Would you like to see them?

21
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,479
Tell me, the jokes about the salesman
and the farmer's daughter, they true?

22
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,071
Here. This one's my favourite!

23
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,510
Really says it all.

24
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,432
Wouldn't you agree?

25
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,233
You are sick.

26
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,949
It's a matter of opinion.

27
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,317
There's a rest stop next off-ramp.
Pull into it.

28
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,593
- I have money, it's not a lot...
- Nobody wants your money.

29
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,159
Just pull in.

30
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,753
Why?

31
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,956
Because I wouldn't wanna do this
at 70 miles an hour.

32
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,390
Could be dangerous.

33
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,919
Agent Mackelway.

34
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,039
Welcome to Albuquerque.

35
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,908
Rick Charleton.

36
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,035
Miss Payton's
the nice girl at the front desk.

37
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,794
She puts together a package
for all the new agents.

38
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,837
Everything you need to know
about the area...

39
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,877
...help with finding apartments
and such.

40
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,349
- This one's yours.
- Okay.

41
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,750
- Gonna get it all set up for you.
- All right.

42
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,271
Not that different from Dallas, is it?

43
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,032
No, sir.

44
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,111
If you need anything, just yell.

45
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,952
Thanks.

46
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,676
I'm Tom, guys.

47
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,274
- Nice to meet you, Tom. Don here.
- Hello.

48
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,715
- I'm Bill.
- Hey, Bill. Tom.

49
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,030
Tom, do you like Frito pies?

50
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,275
I don't know, Bill.
I don't know what they are.

51
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,039
Welcome to the minors.

52
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,511
Here, let me do that.

53
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,874
- Thank you.
- Sure.

54
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,397
- Don't know how to make coffee.
- That's okay. It takes some experience.

55
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,716
Isn't there a Starbucks around here?

56
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,158
- That's a joke, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's a joke.

57
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,550
So you're Mackelway?

58
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,352
Yeah, Agent Mackelway.

59
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,438
Katie Payton.

60
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,391
A fax is coming in for you.
It's the room next door.

61
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,155
- Really? Fax for me?
- Yeah.

62
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,274
Okay. Thank you.

63
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,670
- No problem. Nice meeting you.
- Yep.

64
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,714
Mackelway...

65
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,232
...you gonna stand around all day,
or you wanna do something?

66
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,396
No, sir.

67
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,793
Afternoon, Rick.

68
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,830
Looks like a robbery-homicide.

69
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,798
- Body is back over there.
- You run the plates?

70
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,478
Fellow's name is Harold Speck,
travelling salesman from T or C.

71
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,474
T or C?

72
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,233
Truth or Consequences.

73
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,951
It's a town, slick.

74
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,508
I'll write that down.

75
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,348
Hey!

76
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,278
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What's it look like, bud?

77
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,436
You ever heard of
evidentiary procedure?

78
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,469
Icarus case number 690.

79
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,995
Physicians in charge,
Dr. Galin J. Peterson...

80
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,991
...and Dr. Ferdinand Kovoskis.

81
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,991
Theta-wave entrainment
for RV subject O'Ryan...

82
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,038
...to be used with GPS
for target management.

83
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,792
Session to commence in...

84
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,030
...five, four...

85
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,589
...three, two...

86
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,591
...one.

87
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,589
Target number, write it now.

88
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,193
Focus.

89
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,194
Stay objective.

90
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,712
Smells like clove.

91
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,709
Okay.

92
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,560
Describe. Describe it.

93
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,195
Short, one word.

94
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,154
One word.

95
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,631
Draw the environment.

96
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,276
One target at a time.

97
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,315
One target at a time.

98
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,872
Draw the environment.

99
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,917
Draw the environment now.

100
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,754
Sir.

101
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,956
Sort of a stickler for procedure.

102
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,999
I imagine you would be.

103
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,038
Christ.

104
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,958
See it.

105
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,517
See it, draw it now.

106
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,272
Draw it now.

107
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,192
Draw it now.

108
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,995
Shoes are on the wrong feet.

109
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,309
All American Diner,
Gallup, New Mexico.

110
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,677
- Passed that on the way here.
- He had breakfast there this morning.

111
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,073
Startling off the bottom of the inning,
Barry Matthews.

112
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,872
Got on base with a line-drive
single his last at bat.

113
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,271
And he takes the first pitch
high and inside for ball one.

114
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,318
Looked like Leonard was trying
to get the breaking pitch inside...

115
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,233
...but it just didn’t have
any break on it that time.

116
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,435
Agent Mackelway,
we're over here.

117
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,315
I was gonna introduce you two, but I
understand that won't be necessary.

118
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,869
Seems your former office
decided we needed help...

119
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,996
...so they sent us Agent Kulok.

120
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,829
- Hey, Tom.
- Hi, Fran.

121
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,355
I guess we're gonna skip
the tearful reunion.

122
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,397
Have a seat, Tom.

123
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,468
How are things in Dallas?

124
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,791
Wouldn't really know.
I've been chained to a desk.

125
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,269
Okay, what do we know?

126
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,479
Picked up a footprint in the back seat.
A size and a half bigger than Speck's.

127
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,834
Okay.

128
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,232
Wounds on Speck's throat indicate
he was strangled from behind.

129
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,994
I think our guy was waiting
for him in the back seat...

130
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,913
...sprung this on him
once the car was moving.

131
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,196
Lab picked up talcum traces
along the edges...

132
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,148
...consistent with powdered gloves.
So he gets this dropped in his lap...

133
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,073
...it spooks him,
car ends up in the ravine.

134
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,440
That car was pushed
to the state line.

135
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,989
The depth of the tire tracks...

136
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,874
...footprints near the embankment.

137
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,429
That car wasn't going
more than 3 miles an hour...

138
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,393
...and it stopped literally
on the state line.

139
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,634
Guy must have used GPS.

140
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,075
Why would he push it
to the state line?

141
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,119
Same reason he did everything else,
to get the FBI's undivided attention.

142
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,317
There's an association here.

143
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,719
You have a circle...

144
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,712
...and a lidless eye that's always open.

145
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,154
Seeing.

146
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,919
Seeing.

147
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,116
Or making sure that we're seeing.

148
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,113
It's just a feeling.

149
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,719
He was a normal guy.
You know, kind of quiet.

150
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,271
He liked to read fishing magazines,
and he wasn't much of a tipper.

151
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,795
- Is that a lousy thing to say?
- No, it's fine.

152
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,877
Could you tell us
about the other man?

153
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,951
Like I said,
I never really saw him.

154
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,315
Harold came up complaining
about the guy...

155
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,789
...but by the time I turned
around, he was gone.

156
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,279
- Can you desc...?
- Desc-

157
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,396
- Can you describe him, ma'am?
- Oh, sure.

158
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,790
You could tell he wasn't
from around here.

159
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,916
Did you see what he was driving?

160
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,957
You know, now that you mention it...

161
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,795
...there's a Torino out in the parking
lot with a real crappy paint job.

162
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,916
It's been here since last night.

163
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,949
We need a protocol
for interviewing witnesses.

164
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,314
Fine. I'll handle it.

165
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,789
Always in control.
Tell you something, Tom...

166
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,269
...I want my life back,
so I want this over quick.

167
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,714
So, what happened?

168
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,228
Your ring.

169
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,519
It didn't work out...

170
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,988
...just like us.

171
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,068
So why are you here?

172
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,992
You vacationing in Albuquerque?

173
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,470
Oh, Tom, you sure haven't changed
in six whole months.

174
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,959
Keys are in the car.

175
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,316
I don't need a babysitter...

176
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,438
...so let's do it right this time.

177
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,398
Then don't make things so
unnecessarily complicated again.

178
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,551
- Trunk's ajar.
- You listening to me?

179
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,349
You think I wanna be down here?
I'm not interested in hanging out...

180
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,228
...and I'm not your babysitter.
I'm your partner.

181
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,714
I didn't put you here, remember.

182
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,192
And I'm not going through
this again with you.

183
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,588
Holy shit.

184
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,392
A circle with a slash.

185
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,512
- Dispatch.
- I need help down here.

186
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,274
- What's your 20?
- The All American Diner in Gallup.

187
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,759
Hey, Tom, got an iD on our body.

188
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,911
Barney Fulcher, age 50...

189
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,436
...sixth-grade teacher from Colorado.
These plates aren't gonna help.

190
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,070
Forget them. This guy started
in Oklahoma, left these for us.

191
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,399
Mrs. Speck...

192
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,473
...I just heard.

193
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,914
I'm so sorry.

194
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,275
I didn't know him well, but I think
Harold was a more complex person...

195
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,919
...than people realize.

196
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,197
He was, wasn't he?

197
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,828
I'm really sorry
for your loss, ma'am.

198
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,594
Thank you. Thank you so much.

199
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,471
So it wasn't Fulcher's car?

200
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,870
Car was registered to
a Daniel Dyson...

201
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,554
...runs a halfway house
In Oklahoma City.

202
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,438
Dyson?

203
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,319
Daniel Dyson?

204
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,634
Hello?

205
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,831
Fucking freak!

206
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,353
What a fucking freak.

207
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,558
Can I help you?

208
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,788
Why didn't you report it as stolen?

209
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,235
The truth is, I always hated that car.

210
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,115
Nobody but Benjamin
could ever make it run right.

211
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,236
Is that his name, Benjamin?

212
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,198
It's hard to say.
That's what he liked to be called.

213
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,271
This bad wiring.

214
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,515
I think we've got an
obsessive-compulsive here.

215
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,355
I'll call Grieves. Get him to work up
a list of behaviourists for us to talk to.

216
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,714
Give me that.

217
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,714
Excuse me.

218
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,632
These came from Benjamin?

219
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,677
He used to spend hours down here.

220
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,512
It was like... Like his office.

221
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,388
What are these?

222
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,791
With those numbers and pictures,
he said he could find anybody.

223
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,393
Benjamin O'Ryan?

224
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,269
Special Agent Benjamin O'Ryan, FBI.

225
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,638
It was his fantasy.

226
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,552
Oh, fuck.

227
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,752
Agent Mackelway, what the fuck
were you thinking?

228
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,800
He's got nine murders in his pocket,
and he's gonna walk.

229
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,199
Hey, Starkey.

230
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,952
What made you think you could
cross the border into Mexico...

231
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,190
...without an extradition order?

232
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,828
I knew he was gonna
disappear into Mexico.

233
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,228
You knew?

234
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,119
Agent Mackelway, you have shamed
and vilified this bureau...

235
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,599
...with your methods.

236
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,149
I have no choice but to recommend
you be suspended...

237
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,799
...for a period of six months...

238
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,838
...during which you'll undergo
a psychological evaluation.

239
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,390
Let the record show that the case
against Agent Fran Kulok is pending.

240
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,596
Turn it off!

241
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,599
I guess you guys are never
unaccounted for, huh?

242
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,631
This guy really likes you.

243
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,036
This is O'Ryan's room.

244
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,432
Tom.

245
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,194
You got it?

246
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,637
Yeah, I got it.

247
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,795
It's Agent Kulok. Can you run this
number and iD the subscriber for me?

248
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,157
- You're breaking up, Fran.
- Hold on. Let me get outside, hold on.

249
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,228
Thank you.

250
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,469
Ever see a 50-foot shark?

251
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,474
I'm sorry?

252
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,398
A 50-foot shark. You ever see one?

253
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,992
No.

254
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,555
Doesn't mean there aren't any.

255
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,396
Excuse me, sir,
did you know him?

256
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,109
The guy with the Torino, O'Ryan,
the guy who lived upstairs?

257
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,237
Why? Is he dead?

258
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,031
- I don't know.
- You said "did."

259
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,471
- Is he dead?
- Oh, no. I'm sorry. I misspoke.

260
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,833
You ever seen this before?

261
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,231
It's a circle with a slash
through it.

262
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,911
It's not a circle.

263
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,279
It's a zero.

264
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,960
It's a zero.
And how do you know that?

265
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,113
Did he tell you that?

266
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,799
Why are you whistling?

267
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,192
What does that mean?

268
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,713
Have you seen this, sir?

269
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,472
Circle with a slash through it.

270
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,791
Have you seen that?
A circle with a slash through it?

271
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,951
Circle with a slash through it.
Take a look.

272
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,315
Have you seen a circle
with a slash through it?

273
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,596
Benjamin O'Ryan? Sir?

274
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,638
A circle with a slash through it?

275
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,916
Benjamin O'Ryan.
He was here seven years.

276
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,069
- Tom?
- What?

277
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,119
We got a trace. Faxes and Things,
Sleeper, Missouri. Come on.

278
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,274
Come on.

279
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,836
I'll have a 7 &7 please.

280
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,070
Got some iD?

281
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,435
It's in the car. No one's asked me
for it for a couple of years now.

282
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,352
Nothing personal, honey.

283
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,792
Excuse me...

284
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,110
...you forgot this.
- Oh, I don't have...

285
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,153
Kiss it!

286
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,354
Hey.

287
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,750
Hey, hey!

288
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,117
Fuck you.

289
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,197
You fuck.

290
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,350
Hi.

291
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,392
Turn around.

292
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,512
Turn around!

293
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,473
- Ma'am?
- FBI.

294
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,114
Excuse me.

295
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,672
Do your parents know?

296
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,034
Tom.

297
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,228
You got an iD?

298
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,435
- What?
- Raymond Starkey.

299
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,439
- Starkey did this?
- Tom, Starkey's the guy on the ground.

300
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,916
You son of a bitch...

301
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,438
...why are you baiting me?

302
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,149
You want me
to see what you see.

303
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,676
You want me to see.

304
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,391
I'm trying to see it.

305
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,516
I'm trying to see it.

306
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,078
- He opens up an old wound.
- Yeah.

307
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,110
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

308
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,479
Maybe he's got something
against law enforcement...

309
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,868
...like the Zodiac.

310
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,670
"You're welcome, Tom.
You're welcome, Tom."

311
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,434
Not FBI. Tom. He's baiting me.
He wants me.

312
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,319
Why? What does he want?

313
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,708
Okay.

314
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,589
Tom, I want you to take me
through this.

315
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,273
Explain this to me.

316
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,629
Okay. See if this makes sense
to you, okay?

317
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,670
Each of the 45 abduction dates
on these faxes correspond...

318
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,479
...to one of the GPS coordinates
on O'Ryan's map.

319
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,952
- What about the two bodies we iD'd?
- Okay. Well, let's find the faxes.

320
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,034
Here we go.

321
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,674
Male victim.
Last seen, Trenton, New Jersey.

322
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,592
Okay. Found in Dyersville, Iowa.

323
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,797
Okay. Female.
Last seen, Dayton, Ohio.

324
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,439
Found in Brownsville, Texas.

325
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,079
So we have two bodies...

326
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,716
...that were found 1000 miles
from where they were last seen.

327
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,108
What's this?

328
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,999
- That's Tucumcari, New Mexico.
- Why blue?

329
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,948
That's the only city where the date on
the fax and the map didn't correspond.

330
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,912
Date of disappearance: Christmas.

331
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,356
On O'Ryan's map, 8-27.

332
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,352
The only thing we know is there
never was a Benjamin O'Ryan, FBI.

333
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,237
He would have made
a hell of an agent.

334
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,676
Autopsy reports just arrived
for both the new positive iDs.

335
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,475
- Bruises?
- No, they're burn marks.

336
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,108
We've got them here too
on our female from Dayton.

337
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,511
And these marks relate to the marks
found on Fulcher and Speck how?

338
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,877
They don't. There were no burn marks
on Speck, Fulcher or Starkey.

339
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,600
And we have no slash-circles
here on these bodies.

340
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,958
Right.

341
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,597
My office, as soon as someone
finds something useful.

342
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,234
No luck on
the behavioural specialists.

343
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,392
I do have a couple other leads
that I'm following up on.

344
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,597
- I'm hopeful they're gonna pan out.
- Great, thank you.

345
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,599
A professor of criminal biology,
Professor Daitz, just called.

346
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,109
He says he's got time
for you on Saturday.

347
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,839
Thank you, Katie.

348
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,392
I was operating under the assumption
that O'Ryan was somebody's fantasy.

349
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,233
Oh, no, he's real.
He was a student of mine.

350
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,756
That fax you sent me,
this circle with the slash through it?

351
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,871
That's his construct, his theory.

352
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,038
He called it "Suspect Zero."

353
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,679
Suspect Zero?

354
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,993
He posited a theory
that a serial killer...

355
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,391
...could cross the entire country
without ever getting caught.

356
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,039
What makes a killer catchable?

357
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,792
Patterns, repetition of behaviour.

358
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,791
He imagined someone
with no patterns...

359
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,110
...no telltale fetishes, no rituals...

360
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,795
...just a random killing machine
that never leaves a clue.

361
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,111
But a serial killer by definition
is condemned to repetition.

362
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,396
I mean, isn't that
what he's all about?

363
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,959
Well, he is until he isn't.

364
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,670
And this Suspect Zero, is that
something that you believe in, doctor?

365
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,717
It's something O'Ryan believed in.

366
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,077
He swore guys like that existed,
only we couldn't see them...

367
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,755
...because they didn't obey
the usual laws, like cancer doesn't...

368
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,593
...or the HIV virus that
tricks your immune system...

369
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,398
...into thinking it isn't there.

370
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,115
So you're saying a guy
like that could exist?

371
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,316
Do you know the definition
of a black hole?

372
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,159
Not precisely, no.

373
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,029
It's a celestial body
with a gravitational force so strong...

374
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,509
...that nothing escapes it.
Not even light.

375
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,638
Well, then how do you find
something you can't see?

376
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,792
Well, it was there and we found it.

377
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,117
Why do you think O'Ryan is convinced
a person like that is around?

378
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,953
In this time and place.
What about a split personality?

379
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,429
Could you have a stone-cold
killer on one hand...

380
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,070
...and a thoughtful man
with a conscience on the other?

381
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,037
I mean, could O'Ryan...

382
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,509
...possibly be this Suspect Zero?

383
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,319
Yeah.

384
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,516
It's a viable theory.

385
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,798
I mean, the point is, I don't think you're
gonna know until you find O'Ryan.

386
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,349
Point is, I don't think you're
gonna know until you find O'Ryan.

387
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,593
Just a random killing machine
that never leaves a clue.

388
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,795
Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.

389
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,956
Sing it, Lord.

390
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,633
Everybody inside.
On the double, let's go.

391
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,995
Come on. Keep moving.
Storm's coming.

392
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,754
Get inside!

393
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,354
Come on in, right now! Girls!

394
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,228
Come in, now. It's starting to rain,
and I don't want you out there alone.

395
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,352
Turn around!

396
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,672
- Fran.
- Hi.

397
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,912
- Fran, I need some help.
- You're so wet. Are you okay?

398
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,355
Yeah, Fran, I need
somebody to talk to.

399
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,308
It's driving me crazy.

400
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,913
Listen to me.

401
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,508
There's Speck, a small-town
New Mexico travelling salesman.

402
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,353
Fulcher, a schoolteacher
from Boulder and then Starkey.

403
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,752
I got a lock on him. It's just there's
something missing, and I can't...

404
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,592
It's okay.

405
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,912
Why don't you come in.

406
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,559
No, come out. Get dressed.

407
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,951
We're right on the edge
of this thing, come on.

408
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,634
Come here. Come here.

409
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,268
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

410
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,836
You gotta keep calm, okay?

411
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,554
Fran...

412
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,914
I've been having these dreams.

413
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,190
I've been seeing things again...

414
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,636
...and I don't know what they mean.

415
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,954
Come inside, Tom. Come in.

416
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,998
No, I can't.

417
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,195
I almost have it, Fran.

418
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,396
I'm worried about you.

419
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,110
I love you, Fran.

420
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,876
I love you.

421
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,829
Mrs. Speck, did your husband
keep any chemicals?

422
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,116
Did he have any unusual hobbies?
Did he...?

423
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,679
Was he an avid photographer?

424
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,400
- Did he have an interest in sewing?
- No, why?

425
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,229
I'm taking your time. I'm sorry
to ask you these questions.

426
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,399
I'm sorry I don't have more time, Agent
Mackelway, but it's my PTA day.

427
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,118
I'm sorry. I should have called.

428
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,955
I wish I could've helped you.

429
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,474
I'm FBI.

430
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,992
Yeah, I'll bet.

431
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,998
What the hell is that?

432
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,791
We managed to identify the remains
of 10 of the 21 victims found...

433
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,837
...In the attic of Harold A. Speck...

434
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,753
...the travelling salesman
from Truth or Consequences.

435
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,958
They were mostly teenagers.
More than half were runaways.

436
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,190
The revelation that Speck
was a serial killer...

437
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,112
...led us to examine
Barney Fulcher...

438
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,875
...the victim that Agent Kulok and I
found at the All American Diner.

439
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,039
After an extensive search of his home,
we found the remains of nine people...

440
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,078
...mostly boys between
the ages of 9 and 14.

441
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,280
The last victim, Raymond Starkey...

442
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,712
...who vanished after his acquittal
six months ago, we all know about.

443
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,117
For some reason, this man is
Identifying and targeting serial killers.

444
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,748
Not necessarily. We got two
other bodies from Santa Fe...

445
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,717
...so killers aren't his only victims.

446
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,678
We don't know those bodies
had anything to do with O'Ryan.

447
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,798
Stick to what we know.
He's a transient with mental illness.

448
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,590
He also happens to think
he's a former agent of this bureau.

449
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,474
I want this man apprehended now.

450
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,596
Swung on and missed. Strike two.

451
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,192
Here's the wind-up.
Swung on and missed. Strike three.

452
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,873
Even though he hit over .300
his previous three seasons...

453
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,157
...It wasn't until last year that
he made the all-star team.

454
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,949
Sergeant, copy that.
Possible stolen vehicle.

455
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,717
We are checking NCIC
for warrants.

456
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,228
Good afternoon.

457
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,872
Afternoon, officer.

458
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,197
See your driver's license, sir?

459
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,588
Of course.

460
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,959
Is there a problem?

461
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,879
- Can I see your registration, please?
- Sure.

462
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,950
You mind stepping out
of the car, please?

463
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,752
I'm carrying something that could
be construed as a weapon.

464
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,232
I'd like to hand it over so you won't
think I'm trying to conceal anything.

465
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,914
What kind of weapon, sir?

466
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,555
A hunting knife,
right here on my hip.

467
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,310
On my way to the woods.
My gear's in the trunk.

468
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,995
Would you like me to hand it to you?
I don't know what the procedure is.

469
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,709
Take the weapon off your hip, place it
on the ground, kick it towards me.

470
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,193
Happy to.

471
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,829
What exactly were you
planning on hunting?

472
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,991
A 50-foot shark.

473
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,917
- I used to be in law enforcement too.
- Is that right?

474
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,310
FBI. Of course, that was
some years ago now.

475
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,950
Psy ops, strictly classified.

476
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,079
Are you on any type of medication,
or have you been drinking today?

477
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,193
- Sir?
- I'm sorry.

478
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,352
I just found myself wondering
what was inside that truck.

479
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,476
Sir, I'm gonna ask you to hand me
the keys to your vehicle, please.

480
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,748
- Fran?
- Yeah?

481
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,956
O'Ryan was here.
Damn it, O'Ryan was here.

482
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,592
He left that in my jacket.

483
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,637
Don't do this again, Tom. Don't.

484
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,360
Tom, don't do this.

485
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,551
You're gonna help me.

486
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,271
You're gonna help me turn it off.
Nobody told me how to turn it off.

487
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,318
- And you're gonna help me turn it off.
- You're here.

488
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,799
Help me turn it off.

489
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,350
Icarus began as a means
of gathering military intelligence.

490
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:05,191
But its applications in the world of law
enforcement are proving promising.

491
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:09,876
The reason you men are sitting here is
because you've all fit into the profile...

492
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,190
...that best suits a remote viewer.

493
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,511
You've been selected
and evaluated...

494
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:18,468
...based on recurrent symptoms
of elevated dream activity...

495
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,234
...migraine headaches, tinnitus...

496
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,391
...and your psy test results.

497
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,788
Target reference number.

498
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,678
One- seven...

499
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,559
...four-six. Go.

500
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,958
Don't close your eyes.

501
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,553
Don't think.

502
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,994
Focus on the target.

503
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,038
Everyone is gonna wind up
with severe psychological trauma.

504
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,794
You're high
or genius-level intelligence...

505
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,157
...unmarried, with no record
of long or serious relationships.

506
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,117
- The fear.
- And you're all obsessive...

507
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,629
...In nature.
- Describe the person.

508
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,758
Don't stop the pen from moving.

509
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,117
This girl’s afraid.
She's afraid.

510
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,750
Afraid. You're becoming emotionally
entrained with the victim.

511
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,148
Collection process.

512
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,635
It is not meant to be an experience.

513
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,234
You're gonna help me.

514
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,231
You're gonna help me turn it off.

515
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,710
Nobody's told us
how to turn it off...

516
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,189
...and you're gonna help me
turn it off.

517
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,757
Help me turn it off.

518
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,193
You're gonna help me.

519
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,793
You're gonna help me.

520
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,279
Turn it off.

521
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,716
Icarus began as a means of
gathering military intelligence...

522
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,474
...but its applications
In the world of law enforcement...

523
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,189
...are proving promising
In several different areas.

524
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,716
These are areas which you
will be involved in your studies...

525
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,714
...and, as you've been advised, they're
classified top-secret and confidential.

526
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,633
FBI profile 6765031.

527
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,837
Icarus case number 754.

528
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,355
Physicians in charge,
Dr. Galin J. Peterson...

529
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,636
...and Dr. Ferdinand Kovoskis.

530
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,553
Audio enhancer
for remote viewer O'Ryan.

531
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,836
Session to commence in...

532
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,150
...five, four...

533
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,515
...three, two...

534
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,874
...one.

535
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,708
Focus.

536
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,078
Target number, write it now.

537
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,191
Focus.

538
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,270
One target at a time.

539
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,311
Stay objective.

540
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,668
Do not identify with the victim.

541
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,275
Do not identify with the victim.

542
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,797
Charlie?

543
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,512
Charlie?

544
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,799
Charlie!

545
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,552
Charlie?!

546
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,114
Charlie!

547
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,350
Charlie!!

548
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,112
Charlie?!

549
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,838
Charlie?!

550
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,911
Charlie!!

551
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,399
Charlie!!

552
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,273
Here they are, Mackelway.

553
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,554
Look.

554
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,274
Look.

555
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,232
No, I won't tell! No, please!

556
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,831
Shut it off for me!

557
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,595
You got one of those pins in Deming?
O'Ryan was spotted there yesterday.

558
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,672
He took a squad car and a sidearm
off a highway patrolman.

559
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,959
About an hour later a 5-year-old boy
was abducted a mile up the interstate.

560
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,556
We also found the bodies of two
females in a Dumpster off the highway.

561
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,073
Your boy's been busy.

562
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,755
We're establishing a perimeter
around the city.

563
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,228
Was the patrolman hurt?

564
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,231
- What's the difference?
- He wasn't, was he?

565
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,312
He was fine. The girls in
the Dumpster had fatal injuries.

566
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,629
O'Ryan's not the guy.

567
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,394
He's chasing the guy
or that patrolman would be dead.

568
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,516
Can I ship this guy back to Dallas?

569
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,592
O'Ryan was FBI, you ever
heard of a project called Icarus?

570
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,034
- No.
- Have you?

571
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,316
It's agents trained
to see distant locations...

572
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,869
...using only the mind.
They call it remote viewing.

573
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,871
Bureau stole it from the Army.

574
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,429
They use it to track down
serial killers.

575
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,752
What? You don't believe me?
It's bullshit? It's voodoo?

576
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,672
It worked.
They made a science of it.

577
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,752
That's how he drew this.
He'd never been in this house...

578
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,229
...he just saw what was there.
The bureau taught him...

579
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,516
...and he's using it to track
Suspect Zero.

580
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,989
You know what?
I'm extremely tired of that term.

581
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,720
Profile the guy.
He's straight out of Quantico.

582
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,472
He's working like we would.

583
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,756
He's not kidnapping,
he's chasing the guy...

584
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,229
...that's doing the kidnapping.
Look at the map.

585
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,754
Okay.

586
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,555
What you're telling me is all these
abductions are the work of one guy.

587
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,438
Yes.

588
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,830
Mac, do you realize
how insane that is?

589
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,192
Fran, please help me.
He's not listening to me.

590
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,309
Tom, I'm not sure that you're seeing
things very clearly right now.

591
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,548
Tom...

592
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,959
...let's just try something
that actually makes sense.

593
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,316
This guy sends in these faxes.

594
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,675
He picks off three scumbags. Why?

595
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,912
So that we'll think what you're
thinking, that we got a friend.

596
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,914
Somebody who's willing to take out
the trash for us, and it's horseshit.

597
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,274
What if it isn't?

598
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,876
What if there is a Suspect Zero, and
O'Ryan's the one guy who's got a shot?

599
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,510
For fuck's sake, Mackelway. When did
you start buying into this guy?

600
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,471
Well, he's smarter than we are.

601
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,637
Speak for yourself.

602
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,190
I'm going to Deming.
You can take the rest of the day off.

603
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,270
I'll be damned.

604
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,354
- Kulok here.
- Hey.

605
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,398
- Where are you?
- I'm headed towards Tucumcari.

606
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,310
Listen, those marks on the bodies,
could they be freezer burns?

607
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,549
Let me get into this.

608
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,269
Yeah.

609
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,353
There's crystallization because
the blood never clotted. Freezer burn.

610
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,796
He keeps the bodies in a freezer
and buries them 1000 miles apart?

611
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,239
- Hey, Tom, what's going on?
- I got a possible suspect.

612
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,989
That kid's been a brat all morning.
I turned around...

613
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,316
See what you caused?

614
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,188
Are you afraid?

615
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,950
It'd be custom here at this point
to start praying. I see a lot of that.

616
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,350
Haven't heard too many
answers though.

617
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,359
You're alone.

618
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,076
Come on. Are you afraid?

619
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,435
- Where's the boy?
- My, my!

620
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,591
Must be extremely satisfying to hear
yourself say something so heroic.

621
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,273
I'm almost envious.

622
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,795
The boy's in pieces
under the bed.

623
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,959
Now are you afraid?

624
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,918
I know what you're thinking, "Pain
is coming. Will I take it like a man."

625
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,991
Let me put you at ease, you won't.

626
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,232
None of them do. Men, women,
children, they all weep, they all beg.

627
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,834
They pass out, piss themselves,
attempt negotiations.

628
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,958
You wouldn't believe how many men
I've seen where you are.

629
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,839
Grown men with wives
and children at home...

630
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,471
...offering sexual gratification for a
five-minute reprieve. It's pathetic.

631
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,079
Are you afraid?

632
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:03,632
When they realize there's nothing left
to negotiate, and they're helpless...

633
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,917
Well, the look in their eyes,
the level of surrender...

634
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,071
...it's almost pornographic.

635
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,312
I put that mirror here because
I didn't want you to miss it.

636
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,198
Are you afraid?

637
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,752
- Look in the mirror.
- Are you afraid?

638
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,672
- Look in the mirror.
- Are you afraid?

639
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,114
Look in the mirror, O'Ryan.

640
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,590
- Hey, you, fucking Mackelway.
- Look at yourself, look in the mirror.

641
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,557
- Are you afraid, Mackelway?
- Look at yourself.

642
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,312
- Are you afraid?!
- No, I'm not afraid.

643
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,869
Open your eyes!
Open your eyes, goddamn it...

644
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,350
...or I'll cut the fucking lids off!
- Then cut the fucking lids off!

645
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,509
The initiation used to be more civil.

646
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:48,958
I'm sorry about that.
You're part of it now.

647
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,669
There were five of us, you know.
The most skilled...

648
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,877
...technical remote viewers
on Project Icarus.

649
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,798
You come in in the morning, have a
cup of coffee, talk about the Yankees.

650
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,951
You go to your room
with your pen...

651
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,714
...and your pad of paper,
always alone.

652
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,519
You try and lock in,
you crank out an ideogram.

653
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,157
Son of Sam,
John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy.

654
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,393
He might be driving his car,
having a beer, brushing his teeth...

655
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,316
...cutting someone's eyes out.

656
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,796
If you did it right,
you got it all.

657
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,629
The way it sounded,
the way it smelled.

658
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,191
Those people were looking right
up at you, begging you for mercy.

659
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,594
It was like being God.

660
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,548
But, of course, you're not God.
Can't do a thing for them.

661
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,433
They wired us into this current,
the five of us...

662
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,949
...darkness, the pit itself.

663
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:56,318
We were plugged right into it,
and no one taught us how to turn it off.

664
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,918
We saw things men shouldn't see.

665
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,548
Agony...

666
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,519
...torture...

667
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,832
...evil.

668
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,228
It never shut off.

669
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,918
I checked once
with all the guys that'd...

670
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,833
...been on the project when it
was just used for intel.

671
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,075
You know, finding gun-runners
and drug lords, Soviet missile sites...

672
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,038
...even the iran hostages.

673
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,318
Anyway, I checked with them,
and they're all okay.

674
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,788
But the five of us...

675
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,871
...plugged into the brains and
nervous systems of human beings...

676
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,519
...that's when we lost it.

677
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,838
We're all either dead
or institutionalised.

678
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,997
After a while, those conversations
about the Yankees became impossible.

679
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,108
O'Ryan.

680
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,193
Those faxes...

681
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,634
...the missings...

682
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,632
...how many of them are his?

683
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,593
All of them.

684
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,751
You were the missing piece, Mac.

685
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,152
Now everything is in place.

686
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,075
All you have to do is finish it.

687
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,114
This is Mackelway.

688
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:00,274
I'm travelling north, approaching
l-54 at Tucumcari, request backup.

689
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:04,115
I'm pursuing a possible suspect
in a refrigerated truck.

690
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,199
Brake!

691
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,273
Hey, Tom!

692
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,069
- Tom!
- Get the trailer open!

693
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,912
There's a kid in the trailer.

694
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,559
Hey, buddy.

695
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,148
You okay?

696
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,628
I got you, okay?

697
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,028
Okay, come here.

698
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,354
I got you.

699
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,556
- Get an ambulance.
- Yes, ma'am.

700
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,997
I knew I was right about you.

701
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,669
No. No, that wasn't me.

702
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,108
Of course it was you.

703
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,635
Wasn't me. Wasn't the wind.

704
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,233
You beat him to death.

705
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,073
Now all you have to do
is finish it. Finish it!

706
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,796
Understand, none of this
was arbitrary.

707
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,554
We were chosen, you and I.
It's not a bad start, Mac.

708
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,154
You made the world a little safer.
We made justice.

709
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,992
- This wasn't justice.
- Yes, it was!

710
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,354
And so is this.

711
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,392
I'm not going to kill you, O'Ryan.

712
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,598
You already have.
I've seen it a thousand times.

713
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,955
- No, you saw wrong.
- That's impossible!

714
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,917
I saw us here. I saw all of it!

715
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,435
Me baiting you, testing you!
Look at him!

716
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,870
You've arrived!
You're cursed, like me...

717
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,270
...only you keep running from it!

718
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,431
You hear things, you see things...

719
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,115
...that's why you can't sleep.
Why your head always aches.

720
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,759
Get up.

721
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,994
Get up.

722
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,036
There is no Zero.

723
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,513
You're confused, old man.
Can't you see that?

724
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,910
You think we did something
mythical here today?

725
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:56,277
You think we put an end to evil?
We killed a deviant, that's all.

726
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,476
There are thousands
of them out there.

727
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,551
O'Ryan, you're a guy with a skill.

728
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,234
You're not God.
You can't see everything.

729
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,550
You don't decide what's justice.

730
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,154
Freeze!

731
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,631
Please, Mac.

732
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,597
I can't sleep anymore.

733
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,512
I keep seeing all those faces.

734
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,710
The ones I couldn't save.

735
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,791
All those missings.

736
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,113
You know, they never blink.

737
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,315
They're all in here.

738
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,149
I want you to shut it off for me.

739
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,673
Please, Mac, I'm so tired.

740
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,116
I just want you to shut it off for me.
Shut it off for me.

741
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,752
I can't.

742
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,078
I'm not you.

743
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,114
Yet.

744
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,951
So tired.

745
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,357
So tired.

746
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,039
Thank you.

747
