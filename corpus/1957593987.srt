1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:04,418
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:16,734
(rhythmic rock music)
(dog pants and whines)

3
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:58,251
(distant dogs bark)

4
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:21,273
(mysterious instrumental music)

5
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,595
(dogs barking)

6
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:47,516
(cat yowling)

7
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,664
(explosive bang)

8
00:01:56,666 --> 00:02:00,833
(gasps)
(car alarm blaring)

9
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:23,010
(otherworldly warbling)

10
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:32,753
(gasps)

11
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:47,236
(heavy metal rock music)

12
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:53,803
(bike tires squeaking)

13
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,169
(glass crunches)

14
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,799
- Hey there, Stenson.

15
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,550
Tryin' to wake up the entire neighborhood?

16
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:09,575
- Hey, Mr. Jonas.

17
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:10,839
How's everything with
the Neighborhood Watch?

18
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,731
- Oh, let me tell you, it's
been a heck of a night.

19
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,523
That freak lightening storm we had

20
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:18,213
has every dog in the neighborhood spooked.

21
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,646
I spent half the night
poking around back yards

22
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:24,626
to make sure that's all
they were barking at.

23
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,378
Go ahead, try it now.

24
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,368
- Alright, cool, thanks.

25
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:33,501
You know, maybe those dogs
have a reason to be freaked.

26
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,979
Whatever it was shattered our streetlight.

27
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,864
- Don't believe everything
you read, Billy.

28
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,099
It was a lightning storm, nothing more.

29
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,548
- Well, they're sending in the SETIs.

30
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,623
Know who they are?

31
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,469
They research extraterrestrial life.

32
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,093
They don't look into lightning strikes.

33
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:47,243
- Yeah, I've heard of 'em.

34
00:03:47,244 --> 00:03:51,449
Just another waste of
the taxpayers' money.

35
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:52,285
Keep it.

36
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:54,958
- I can't take this.

37
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,883
- I have a whole drawer full of them.

38
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:59,575
Use it on an extraterrestrial,

39
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:02,199
if they hold you up on
your way to Mrs. Gibson's.

40
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,908
Can't keep her waiting, you know.

41
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:06,620
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

42
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,621
(upbeat rock music)

43
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:45,734
- You are late again, young Mr. Stenson.

44
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:47,119
- Sorry, Mrs. Gibson.

45
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,379
- [Gibson] You ought to be.

46
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:51,286
I see no reason why my paper
shouldn't be on my porch

47
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:53,283
by the time I get up in the morning.

48
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,774
- I'll try harder, really, I will.

49
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:58,305
- Why a old kid like you
delivering papers, anyway?

50
00:04:58,306 --> 00:05:00,305
Shouldn't you be out driving too fast

51
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:02,568
and getting into trouble with the cops?

52
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,994
- Well, I'm savin' up for a
car so I can, Mrs. Gibson.

53
00:05:04,996 --> 00:05:06,523
It's extra money and
they can't find anyone

54
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:07,763
to take the route.

55
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:09,856
And you ask me that every
time I come by, remember?

56
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:12,913
- (scoffs) Of course I
remember, smart aleck.

57
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:15,998
Maybe I just don't like your bicycle.

58
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:20,628
(upbeat rock music)

59
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:03,963
(suspenseful music)

60
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,936
(guitar chords)

61
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,459
(ominous tones)

62
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,108
- Yeah.

63
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:40,568
- I'm telling you, it wasn't
there yesterday morning.

64
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,864
Not even tire tracks,
no footprints, nothing.

65
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,323
Just sitting there in
the middle of the block,

66
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:47,521
with this weird gargoyle
or something like that.

67
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:49,363
- Gargoyle? That's cool.

68
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:51,035
- Except, there were no windows, man.

69
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,353
No doors, either.

70
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:53,811
It's like one of those spaceships you see

71
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:54,891
on the midnight movie.

72
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:57,899
No propulsion system goes
around without making a sound

73
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,318
and just hums before landing.

74
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,553
I mean, how else could
it have gotten there,

75
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,353
without making a trace?

76
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:07,521
- You think you saw a UFO.

77
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:23,661
- Is he for real?

78
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:25,535
- He's always making stuff like that up.

79
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:26,893
You should see his room,

80
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:28,878
it's full of monsters and creepy stuff.

81
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,373
I don't know why my parents
let him keep it all.

82
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:34,206
Hey.

83
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,111
- What's funny?

84
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:41,499
- Katie's little brother saw a UFO.

85
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:42,943
- Wait.

86
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:44,528
- Haha, very funny.

87
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:48,664
(laughing)

88
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,493
- Alright, what do we do?

89
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:53,889
- You have access to the
school's video camera, right?

90
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,169
- Yeah, but if I get caught
taking any of that stuff

91
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:57,821
off the school property--
- Come on.

92
00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:59,789
I mean, how cool would
it be if we actually

93
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,399
got this on videotape before
the SETI team arrives?

94
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:04,520
- Yeah, how cool would
it be if I got kicked out

95
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,798
of every public school in the US?

96
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:09,126
- Kevin, you're always
telling me how you wanna be a

97
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:10,866
camera man, right?

98
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:14,278
I mean, think about it, think
about the attention we'd get.

99
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,033
Kevin, follow your dreams.

100
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:18,260
Pulitzer-prize winning cameraman.

101
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:20,844
Boy hero who showed this world,

102
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,318
that we are not alone.

103
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,068
Who knows, maybe you'll even
get to meet the president.

104
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,754
- Well a Pulitzer would
be cool to help my career.

105
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:31,590
- Sweet.

106
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,044
- Oh no, UFPs, look at them all!

107
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:44,266
- Yeah, unidentified flying potatoes.

108
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,518
(laughing)

109
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:52,728
- I love these things.

110
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,346
I don't know why Mom
won't buy them for us.

111
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:56,386
- Maybe 'cause she knows
that eating too many of these

112
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:58,774
will turn you into a techno
geek like our buddy Kev here.

113
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:00,586
- Leave him alone.

114
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:02,354
- What's the matter, Stenson?

115
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:05,615
Afraid pencil-butt here will go hungry?

116
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:07,944
- Yeah, like maybe there won't
be enough of him to dissect

117
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,924
when he's abducted by the UFO?

118
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,254
- Are you kidding?

119
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:14,143
With that sack he carries,
that spaceship wouldn't be able

120
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:16,964
to lift off with him on
board, they'll be stuck here.

121
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:20,130
- You're stuck looking
like your ugly face.

122
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,663
- Hey, hey, guys.

123
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:24,130
He didn't say anything, did you, Bill?

124
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:27,003
- No, I didn't say anything.

125
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:27,838
Important.

126
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:32,961
(bell rings)

127
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:45,291
- By 1848, the California
Gold Rush was in full swing.

128
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:48,233
The town of Knollwood prospered

129
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,901
as entire families settled here.

130
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:54,424
The trouble was, the surrounding hills

131
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,260
didn't yield any gold.

132
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:01,896
Prospectors started leaving town.

133
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:04,704
In order to keep food on their tables,

134
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:07,216
those who stayed formed a coalition.

135
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:10,301
Together, they began mining for coal,

136
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:12,934
and Knollwood Mining Company

137
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:17,104
became one of America's first
employee-owned companies.

138
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:20,886
All that changed when one of the miners

139
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,138
discovered a large diamond.

140
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:27,994
Is there a problem here, Kevin?

141
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:29,323
- No, sir.

142
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:30,158
I was...

143
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:35,543
- [Teacher] Talking in
the middle of my lesson.

144
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:38,834
- Actually, he was just saying that,

145
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:43,806
something that size couldn't
possibly be a diamond.

146
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:45,504
- And you agree with him?

147
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:46,338
- Come on, sir.

148
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,371
I don't think my mom would
wear that thing on her finger.

149
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:50,206
- I see.

150
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:54,570
Maybe she'd rather wear this instead,

151
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,988
dubbed the Light of the Moon.

152
00:10:58,403 --> 00:11:02,921
It is the largest diamond
in recorded history.

153
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:06,020
The population soared as people came here

154
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:08,903
looking to strike it rich.

155
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:12,878
Months passed without
anything but coal being found.

156
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,046
Miners dug further and further
through unstable ground,

157
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:21,560
and in the frenzy, catastrophe struck.

158
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:27,281
12 miners became trapped
in one of the shafts.

159
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,603
Local legend has it,

160
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,771
the mine is still haunted,

161
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:34,761
with those 12 dead men.

162
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:40,369
- Good one, Mr. D.

163
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:42,540
Spooked me right up there.

164
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:46,969
- What ever happened to the diamond?

165
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:48,439
- Good question.

166
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,508
No one really knows.

167
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,010
It was being transported
by steam locomotive

168
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,838
to a museum in New York.

169
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,688
It left the night of the mine disaster.

170
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:01,130
Three days later, a message came in.

171
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:03,978
It never made it through
the Cascade Mountain pass.

172
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:05,313
Simply vanished.

173
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,668
Into the moonlit night.

174
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:09,929
(bell rings)

175
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:12,788
Papers are due on Wednesday, no excuses!

176
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:14,371
- [Boy] Yeah, okay.

177
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:36,638
- What's with them?

178
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,738
- [Bill] Oh, that's the Andersons.

179
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:40,234
They're not too big on kids much.

180
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:41,858
- This place is weird, man.

181
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,119
Every house looks exactly the same.

182
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:46,954
And what's with these little kids?

183
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,268
- Kevin's not here, Mrs. Anderson.

184
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,708
Kevin's gone away.
- Stop it!

185
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:53,543
- Redrum!

186
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,809
- You know I hate that, man.

187
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:59,288
- Hey, there's the Danvers'
place, he's pretty cool.

188
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,275
Except for the lawn ornaments.

189
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:04,446
- He only moved here a few years ago.

190
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:07,194
He used to be a professional
soccer player for Romania.

191
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,646
- Romania, cool, that's
where Dracula comes from.

192
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:11,896
How come he doesn't have an accent?

193
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:13,694
I want to you give you
a B but it's not good,

194
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:15,625
I give you a C.

195
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:16,459
No?

196
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,763
- Wait a minute, you
haven't heard about this?

197
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:21,811
- About what?

198
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:24,119
- Well, 20 years ago he
was flying to America

199
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,389
for some World Cup demonstration thing,

200
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:30,644
when his plane crashed into
the side of Mount Miguel.

201
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:33,044
Danvers was the only survivor.

202
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,073
Ever since then he never
went back to Romania.

203
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,496
Whoa!

204
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:38,884
Is that it?

205
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:39,719
Oh, man.

206
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:44,706
You were right, man, this thing is trippy.

207
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,625
Trippiness!

208
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:52,673
(suspenseful music)

209
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:08,666
- What are you boys doing here?

210
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:09,844
(Kevin yelps)

211
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:12,774
You boys don't belong in here.

212
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:15,383
This is a private property.

213
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:18,343
- Um--
- You are trespassing.

214
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:20,133
- We were just, uh--

215
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:21,901
- I don't want to see you back here

216
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,679
unless you are delivering papers.

217
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:28,663
And you'd better be on time when you do.

218
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:29,748
- Yes, ma'am.

219
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,581
(suspenseful music)

220
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:45,831
Hey, dad, did you read the paper today?

221
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,049
- [Dad] Let me guess, the
article that mentioned

222
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:49,971
the strange lights in the sky, right?

223
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,023
- Yeah.

224
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,873
Do you think the SETI
team will find anything?

225
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:55,261
- [Dad] Those guys setting
up the old observatory?

226
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:56,913
What do you think they're gonna find?

227
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:58,778
- Come on, like a UFO.

228
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,249
- There are a millions explanations

229
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:01,959
for what could cause those lights.

230
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:05,028
A low-flying plane, I don't know.

231
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,788
- So, has rocket-boy here been telling you

232
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:09,310
about the UFO he saw this morning?

233
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,459
- The one you saw?

234
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:13,378
Oh, Bill, you can't make
up stories like that.

235
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,409
Not at your age.

236
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:17,109
- I'm not making it up, why
else would the government

237
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:19,458
send in a team of SETI specialists?

238
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,758
- You're never gonna fit in at school

239
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,659
if you don't stop acting
so weird, paperboy.

240
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:26,068
- I don't wanna fit in with
your stupid friends anyway.

241
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,901
- Bill, that's enough.

242
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,318
- I'm sorry.

243
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,979
Bride of Frankenstein.

244
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,528
- Billy.

245
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,296
- She's got these friends who
are made up like they're in

246
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:37,758
a monster movie and they have
these pet gorillas who keep

247
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,268
picking on me and Kev.

248
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,378
- You ask for it, dweeb.

249
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:44,724
- Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot about
the part where I asked Andy

250
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:47,598
and Randy to please throw mashed
potatoes at me and I also--

251
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,679
- Billy, that's enough.

252
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,051
Eat.

253
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:51,969
And, Katie.

254
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:57,228
You don't help by calling
your brother a dweeb.

255
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,711
(upbeat rock music)

256
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:36,681
(moody music)

257
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:29,798
(tapping)
(beeping)

258
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:38,628
- You know those games
will rot your brains.

259
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,296
What's left of them.

260
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:44,219
Wait here, I'll be back.

261
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:04,926
(ominous tones)

262
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:08,011
(high-pitched whine)

263
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:15,028
(eerie atmospheric music)

264
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:29,744
It is always dark in
the space between stars.

265
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,086
And now that darkness comes to Knollwood.

266
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:39,828
(door hisses and rumbles)

267
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:18,721
- [Man] Easy.

268
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:22,801
Come on, all right.

269
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:27,414
- Be careful, guys, this is the system.

270
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,249
- [Man] Oh, good save.

271
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:36,024
- $50,000 worth of satellite up-link

272
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:38,883
and I bust it before we get it set-up.

273
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:40,546
- Let's just get this stuff inside.

274
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:42,499
I want it up and operational by sunset.

275
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:45,585
- Ah, There's no way.
- Sure there is.

276
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:52,409
(thuds)

277
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,333
Okay.

278
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:57,501
Not a problem.

279
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:05,146
(eerie atmospheric music)

280
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:13,816
(explosion blasts)
(alarm wails)

281
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:21,381
(alarm wails)
(dogs bark)

282
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,479
(Bill screams)

283
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,439
(glass shatters)

284
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:58,109
- [Man] GPS hyperlink
extensions are online.

285
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:02,630
Washington's authorized the
use of all four transponders.

286
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:04,709
- Perfect timing, we
should be able to link up

287
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:07,928
to the CompSite satellite
in about, about two minutes.

288
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,518
- Oh, great.

289
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,341
We only missed sunset by about nine hours.

290
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:14,423
Can we go back to the motel now?

291
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:17,211
- Nope, I wanna run a geo
thermal scan of the town first.

292
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:20,153
Establish a normal reading so
we have our records booked.

293
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,846
- Oh, feels good.

294
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:23,786
- You gonna finish that?

295
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:24,958
- No, here.

296
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:29,126
I prefer not to eat my dinner
at six in the morning anyhow.

297
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:33,630
- Yes.
(beeping)

298
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:38,285
That should be the power
transformer on Eterna Road.

299
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:42,056
And that's the incinerator, here we go.

300
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:44,256
This one, this one's reading harder blows

301
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:48,278
and it's coming from an unpopulated area.

302
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,585
- Whatever it is, it's not
bothering those train tracks.

303
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:53,844
- The engine tower's
about a mile away from it.

304
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,140
It was the announced development cycle.

305
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:58,179
- Well, it's too late
to get any sleep now.

306
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:00,160
What do you say we go check it out?

307
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:01,398
- [Man] Good idea.

308
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:04,468
- The heat sensors and video
gear are still in the van.

309
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:05,728
- You want to go now?

310
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:07,310
- Have to, if we wait
'til the sun's fully up,

311
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:10,145
the sensors won't be as effective.

312
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:14,310
- Guys, anyway I can renegotiate my part

313
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:16,580
so I'm getting paid by the hour?

314
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:17,673
Guys?

315
00:22:17,674 --> 00:22:20,674
(upbeat rock music)

316
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:44,233
(eerie atmospheric music)

317
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,575
(siren wails)

318
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:06,871
(high-pitched tone)

319
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:09,789
(electricity zaps)

320
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,280
- You all right, kid?

321
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:29,280
- [Long-Haired Man] Where did
that green light come from?

322
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:30,956
- [Bill] It came from there.

323
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,874
All I did was touch it.

324
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:38,164
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
you're that team from SETI.

325
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,471
- Oh yeah, yeah, Mike, Paula and Hank.

326
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:42,731
- Hi, I'm Bill Stenson.

327
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,753
- You from around here?

328
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:47,131
- Uh, I live in Knollwood Estates.

329
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,883
It's like three blocks from here.

330
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:54,303
But this thing, whatever
you wanna call it,

331
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:56,011
is not from around here.

332
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:57,583
It's only been here a couple of days.

333
00:23:57,585 --> 00:24:01,334
I noticed it the morning
after I saw the UFO.

334
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:04,049
- You saw a UFO?

335
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:04,884
- Yeah.

336
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:08,280
- Alright, Mike, get the
C1 case from the van.

337
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,080
I wanna do an elemental scan.

338
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,591
Paula, you take Bill back to the van.

339
00:24:12,593 --> 00:24:16,759
I wanna see if we can get
this thing to discharge again.

340
00:24:36,214 --> 00:24:37,381
- That's cool.

341
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:41,580
So do these guys know what they're doing?

342
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:44,620
- They might not look
like, but yeah, they do.

343
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:47,281
They are two of the best,
that's why they were sent.

344
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:49,371
And your town is a hot spot right now,

345
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:51,573
and they want to find out what's up.

346
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:52,933
- So what's your job?

347
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:53,913
- My job?

348
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,023
Public relations.

349
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:57,521
You can't imagine what the people think

350
00:24:57,523 --> 00:25:00,303
when they see us roll
into town. (chuckles)

351
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:04,413
It's a little weird
sometimes, but it's fun.

352
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:06,343
Ah, the other thing I do is keep them

353
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:08,161
from getting into trouble.

354
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:10,121
(torch hisses)

355
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:13,093
Like right now, for
example, you stay here.

356
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,094
(suspenseful music)

357
00:25:20,016 --> 00:25:22,024
Did you find anything or are
you just about to destroy

358
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:24,934
someone's personal property to
make my life more difficult?

359
00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:27,088
- No, this metal isn't like
anything I've seen before.

360
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:28,184
I mean, there are traces of Mercury,

361
00:25:28,186 --> 00:25:30,168
but it's definitely not one
of the periodic elements.

362
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:31,994
- Yeah, we wanna see that
it has the same flashpoint

363
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:34,504
as any of the lampton series.

364
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:37,459
- Like the kid said, this
ain't from around here.

365
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:40,774
- Wait a minute, you mean you
don't know what the thing is

366
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:44,768
made of, so you are going
to light it on fire to see?

367
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:45,600
- Yeah.

368
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:48,334
- What if it's made of,
uh, silver dynamite?

369
00:25:48,336 --> 00:25:51,168
You could set fire to
North America doing that.

370
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:52,436
- Uh-uh!

371
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:53,356
- Yeah.

372
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:54,275
- Heads up!

373
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:59,754
(electricity zaps)

374
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,486
- Oh, yeah!

375
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,368
- Did you ever see anything
on Earth do that before?

376
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:09,595
- Man!

377
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:11,356
Mike, get the camera from the van.

378
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:13,858
We've got to get this on tape!

379
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:17,888
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

380
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:20,728
Listen, listen, kid, thanks
so much for your help, but uh,

381
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:22,768
we're dealing with a potentially
dangerous situation here.

382
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:25,344
I think it would be best
if you left right now.

383
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:26,764
- No, I found it.

384
00:26:27,848 --> 00:26:30,068
- Okay, (chuckles) fair enough.

385
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,354
Listen, if you leave now,

386
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:34,456
come by the old observatory after school,

387
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:36,558
I'll personally show you
around the base of operations.

388
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,786
Let you in on our findings.

389
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:39,386
I'll even make you an honorary
member of the SETI team.

390
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:40,764
What do you say?

391
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,478
- Okay, if I can bring
my friend Kevin along.

392
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,311
- Deal!

393
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,884
Oh, Bill, not a word of this to anyone.

394
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:50,324
- No.

395
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:51,244
Bye.
- Yeah.

396
00:27:03,575 --> 00:27:05,658
(laughs)

397
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:15,061
(suspenseful music)

398
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:17,729
(Gibson growls)

399
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,526
(chuckles)

400
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:30,316
Uh, Houston, we have a problem.

401
00:27:30,318 --> 00:27:33,354
This thing isn't touching the ground.

402
00:27:33,356 --> 00:27:35,916
(laughs)

403
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:37,751
Tell Mike to hurry up!

404
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:55,006
- [Raspy Voice] I've come
too far to be stopped now.

405
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,536
You told me everything was in order.

406
00:27:58,538 --> 00:27:59,704
- Don't worry.

407
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:06,494
I'll take care of this
little problem myself.

408
00:28:06,496 --> 00:28:07,329
- Guys!

409
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:13,389
Guys?

410
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,916
Major scientific discovery
here, needs a little attention.

411
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:18,751
Hello!

412
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:24,821
Uh, come on, guys, this is not funny.

413
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:35,979
Hey, guys?

414
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:42,784
- He said he'd make me an
honorary member of the SETI team.

415
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:43,904
- Oh, wicked.

416
00:28:43,906 --> 00:28:46,804
And then he's gonna
show us all their stuff?

417
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:48,515
- Dude, I was in the van.

418
00:28:48,516 --> 00:28:50,334
You should see the equipment they have.

419
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:53,724
Heat sensors, geothermal
up-links, GPS equipment.

420
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:55,555
I can't wait to see what they
have in the old observatory.

421
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:58,444
- So I should bring my camera, right?

422
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,164
- The mutants.

423
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,364
- Hey look, everyone,

424
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,854
it's the little green
men from outer space.

425
00:29:03,856 --> 00:29:04,864
- He's not that little.

426
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:06,305
- Yeah, but he sure is pretty green.

427
00:29:06,306 --> 00:29:07,364
You okay, Kev?

428
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:08,454
- Leave him alone.

429
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,454
- Shut up, dude, he wasn't talking to you.

430
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:13,894
- Yeah, Katie, your
brother sure is clumsy.

431
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:17,084
- Alright, that's enough, alright?

432
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:18,305
You've made your point.

433
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:20,854
The smaller they are, they
farther they fly, now lay off.

434
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:22,141
- [Andy] You're next, man.

435
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:22,976
- Andy.

436
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:24,788
Randy.

437
00:29:27,754 --> 00:29:30,254
You two know better than that.

438
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:43,793
- You okay, man?

439
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,919
(suspenseful music)

440
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:21,474
(computer bleeps)

441
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:41,298
(phone bleeps)

442
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,198
- Yeah, hi, get me the sheriff's office.

443
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:47,199
(gasps)

444
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,068
Let me guess, you're the sheriff?

445
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,901
- No.

446
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:56,238
(Hank groans)

447
00:30:57,808 --> 00:30:59,391
Neighborhood Watch.

448
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:04,233
(snarls)

449
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:06,214
- [Bill] Hey, we're here.

450
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:07,704
- Bring me to your leader.

451
00:31:07,706 --> 00:31:09,206
- [Jonas] Stenson.

452
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:13,936
- Mr. Jonas.

453
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,024
Did we come at a bad time?

454
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:19,184
- No, no, of course not.

455
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:23,713
I just dropped by to welcome
Hank here to Knollwood,

456
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:27,083
on behalf of the Neighborhood Watch group.

457
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:30,803
- Well, we came for the tour,
but we could come back later.

458
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:32,243
- Yeah, we could come back if you would--

459
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:34,328
- No, no, perfect timing.

460
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,483
- Well then, I best be going.

461
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:42,184
I wouldn't wanna spoil your little tour.

462
00:31:42,186 --> 00:31:46,919
Besides, Mrs. Gibson asked
me to stop by her house.

463
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,923
Seems there have been some trespassers

464
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:51,008
over in her neighborhood.

465
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:55,625
I'll catch you later, Hank.

466
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:58,643
I know the other members of the
Neighborhood Watch group are

467
00:31:58,644 --> 00:32:00,155
dying to meet you.

468
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:02,874
Perhaps we'll all stop by.

469
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:03,709
Later.

470
00:32:11,114 --> 00:32:12,615
- Whoa, weird guy!

471
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:26,563
(machine whines)

472
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:27,981
- Did you guys...

473
00:32:29,484 --> 00:32:30,923
Never mind, never mind.

474
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:32,533
Look, on second thought,

475
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:35,194
maybe best if you came
back some other time.

476
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:36,856
- Where are Mike and Paula?

477
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:39,075
(Hank chuckles)

478
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:40,736
- I wish I knew.

479
00:32:40,738 --> 00:32:42,108
- What do you mean?

480
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:44,914
- They're gone, vanished.

481
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,404
This is all I found.

482
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:48,944
- Found where?

483
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:53,155
- This morning, after you
left they both disappeared.

484
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:55,305
- These are the old mine shafts.

485
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,489
- Mine shafts?
- Yeah.

486
00:32:57,491 --> 00:33:00,249
- Hey, there must be some
underneath that silver thing.

487
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,049
Maybe they found a down shaft.

488
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:04,509
- Mine shafts, that would
explain the geothermal

489
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:06,523
readings I'm getting from the equipments.

490
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:07,979
- Hey, well we could help you find them.

491
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:10,483
- Oh no, not me, those
mines have been condemned

492
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:13,099
for over 100 years, they're dangerous.

493
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:15,020
Not to mention haunted.

494
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:18,363
Well, they are.

495
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:21,243
- No.

496
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:22,580
Nope, nope.

497
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:24,929
I'll go check with the sheriff,
I'm sure he can help me get

498
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:26,969
some men together and
help me search the area.

499
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,804
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

500
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:41,324
- Is it okay if I catch a ride

501
00:33:41,326 --> 00:33:43,244
to tomorrow's game with Vanessa's mom?

502
00:33:43,246 --> 00:33:45,734
- Katie, I thought we
were all going together.

503
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:46,904
- I know, it's just Vanessa's mom's

504
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:48,814
got this amazing convertible.

505
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:50,066
- Sounds okay to me.

506
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:52,306
Just be sure and look
for us up in the stands.

507
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:54,674
- Bill, honey, you hardy
touched your dinner.

508
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:56,914
(doorbell rings)

509
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:57,826
- Dad, can you get that?

510
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:00,535
It's Jesse, we're going to
a little pre-game party.

511
00:34:00,536 --> 00:34:03,764
- If it's Jesse, why don't you get it?

512
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:07,434
- Dad, I can't let him
see me in these rags.

513
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,478
- [Dad] Hi there, Jesse, come on in.

514
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,311
- Thanks.

515
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:17,998
- [Mom] Jesse, can I get you anything?

516
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,499
- Oh, no thanks, Mrs. Stenson.

517
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:22,713
Hey, Bill.

518
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,188
- Hey.

519
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,048
- [Dad] You guys, you know each other?

520
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:28,489
- [Jesse] Oh, sure.

521
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:31,438
- So, are you all ready for the big game?

522
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:33,503
- I hope so.
- Oh, don't be nervous.

523
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,424
You are going to do great.

524
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:37,224
- Well, Huntsville's got
a great team this year,

525
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:38,535
so it's gonna be tough game.

526
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,625
- Between you and those
twins you have on your line,

527
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:43,316
your team's been unstoppable.
(Mom laughs)

528
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:45,094
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

529
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:47,473
- [Katie] Don't wait up for me.

530
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,024
- Hey.

531
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:50,565
- Very funny.

532
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:54,383
- Remember, 12:30 on the dot, no later.

533
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,094
- Sure thing, Mrs. Stenson.

534
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,596
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

535
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:06,856
(suspenseful music)

536
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,349
- Katie just left, you've got dish duty.

537
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:11,183
- Oh what, she left?

538
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:12,681
I gotta tell her
something before she went.

539
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:16,040
- Leave her be, she's
fine, she's with Jesse.

540
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,979
- Yeah, she's fine,
nothing to worry about.

541
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:21,229
Unless of course the
Neighborhood Watch happens by,

542
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:23,065
and starts a fighting.

543
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:26,361
(sighs)

544
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:32,598
(leaves crunch)
(suspenseful music)

545
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,811
(Kevin shouts)

546
00:35:57,226 --> 00:35:58,643
Back in a second.

547
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:14,509
(Kevin shouts)

548
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:18,096
- Didn't mean to scare ya, Bill.

549
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:20,145
- I wasn't scared.
- Sure you weren't.

550
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:21,118
- What are you doing out here?

551
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,746
The eclipse isn't until tomorrow.

552
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,866
- Ah, see, this is even better.

553
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:27,176
See, I overheard Chloe and Vanessa talking

554
00:36:27,178 --> 00:36:30,364
in the nurse's office today
because after Mr. Daniels' class

555
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:34,186
I was all vomiting and just
sick and spitting up my--

556
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:35,616
- Kev.

557
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:36,451
Kev, Kev.

558
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:40,838
- Oh yeah, I know where the soccer team

559
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:43,178
is having that pre-game party tonight.

560
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:47,096
And all the cheerleaders
are going to be there.

561
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,218
- Yeah and my sister,
she just left, so what?

562
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:55,886
- Well, they're having
it on Tombstone Hill.

563
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:00,169
- By the old mine shaft.
- Yeah.

564
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:01,899
- I've gotta make sure they
won't be in those mine shafts.

565
00:37:01,901 --> 00:37:04,560
- Whoa, wait a minute, I just
wanted to spy on their party,

566
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:06,040
not break it up.

567
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,488
- Kevin, you saw how spooked
Hank was, there is something

568
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:12,610
weird going on in this
town, we both know it.

569
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:15,361
- Wait, whoa, what are you doing?

570
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,686
- There's something else you should know.

571
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:23,854
What do you know about vampires, Kevin?

572
00:37:23,856 --> 00:37:26,300
- [Kevin] Vampires, I saw
this movie with this guy,

573
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:29,358
this vampire chews off her face.

574
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,748
(wolf howls)

575
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,128
- It's true.

576
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,218
Every night, the ghosts
of the 12 dead miners,

577
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:41,386
roam around the dark shafts
looking for a way out.

578
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,329
But, a night like this is different.

579
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,556
The light of the full
moon draws the miners

580
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,508
all the way out of the shafts.

581
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:54,674
(Randy shouts and laughs)

582
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:57,525
- Gotcha! (laughs)
- You guys are such jerks.

583
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,075
- You are good.
- No, you're good.

584
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,914
- Together we're better!
- Together we're better!

585
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,749
(cheer and laugh)

586
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:09,193
- Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood
Wolves, Knollwood Wolves!

587
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:13,254
Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood
Wolves, Knollwood Wolves!

588
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:14,256
- What's up?

589
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:16,924
- Whatever you do, just,

590
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:19,306
promise me you won't start
acting like those two.

591
00:38:19,308 --> 00:38:21,014
- Who, Andy and Randy?

592
00:38:21,016 --> 00:38:22,506
Not a chance.

593
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,155
- What's gotten into them?

594
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:25,933
- They've always been obnoxious.

595
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:28,155
- You don't see a difference?

596
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:29,489
They've changed.

597
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:33,035
- Knollwood!

598
00:38:33,036 --> 00:38:34,679
Knollwood!

599
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:38,958
- I don't know how to
describe it, it's like...

600
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:41,054
It's like when you look in their eyes,

601
00:38:41,056 --> 00:38:43,556
they're not even real anymore.

602
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,158
- They're just excited
about the game, you know?

603
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,086
Let them have their fun, they're harmless.

604
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:52,626
- Knollwood Wolves!

605
00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:54,014
- Katie?

606
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:55,683
Are you ready to go?

607
00:38:57,799 --> 00:38:58,994
- Where are you going?

608
00:38:58,996 --> 00:39:00,648
- Vanessa's technically grounded.

609
00:39:00,649 --> 00:39:02,484
She's supposed to be at my
house studying, I told her

610
00:39:02,486 --> 00:39:04,635
I'd walk her home so her
parents don't go basaltic.

611
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,994
- Well, I'll take you home.

612
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,734
- No, you stay here and have fun.

613
00:39:09,736 --> 00:39:11,486
Talk to you tomorrow.

614
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,224
- Well, this isn't gonna be
much fun without you here, so,

615
00:39:18,226 --> 00:39:19,794
why don't you let me take you home?

616
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:21,214
- Okay.
- Alright.

617
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,326
(Andy and Randy howl)

618
00:39:30,978 --> 00:39:32,606
- [Kevin] Oh, there they are.

619
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,906
Hey, they're burnin' somethin'
in the fire over there.

620
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:37,241
- Do you see Katie?
- Uh, no.

621
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:43,338
Hey, that thing in the fire
looks like a body, man.

622
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,506
- I wanna see.

623
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:51,265
- Alright, one, two, three.

624
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:59,761
- Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood
Wolves, Knollwood Wolves!

625
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,814
Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood Wolves!

626
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,931
- That's not a body.

627
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:08,283
It's a dummy, man,
Huntsville Goldworst uniform.

628
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:10,843
- Well, what do you want from me?

629
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:15,843
It's dark out, it looks like
a body and it's on fire.

630
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:17,173
Where are you going?

631
00:40:17,174 --> 00:40:19,424
- I gotta make sure no one
goes in or out of those mines.

632
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:21,123
- Well, I'm not going.

633
00:40:21,124 --> 00:40:24,104
Especially since you told me about the...

634
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:27,603
- Kevin, Katie is supposed
to be out here somewhere.

635
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,188
- Well yeah, but...

636
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:36,994
Well fine, I'll stay here.

637
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:40,723
(suspenseful music)

638
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:41,558
Bill?

639
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:45,148
Bill?

640
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:49,476
Billy?

641
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:43,094
- This is crazy.

642
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:47,904
Kevin?

643
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:56,008
- Hey, hey, I can't see anything.

644
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,843
- Hank?

645
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:00,608
- What are you guys doing here?

646
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,436
- Uh, there's a party over the hill.

647
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:05,136
We wanna go make sure no
one goes near the mine.

648
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:06,721
- You should leave.

649
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,048
- [Bill] Where's the rest of your team?

650
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:10,708
- [Hank] Still lookin' for 'em.

651
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:12,728
- What about the sheriff?

652
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:15,408
- I can't find him, let
alone Paula and Mike.

653
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,636
- Well, did you check the station?

654
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:20,248
- Yeah, it's the first place I checked.

655
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,576
There's no one there, in fact,

656
00:42:21,578 --> 00:42:23,315
this whole place is like a ghost town.

657
00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:24,508
- What do you mean?

658
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:26,928
- It's like everybody
closed up shop and left.

659
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:30,256
- Well, where do you think they went?

660
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:31,438
- To the safety of their homes,

661
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:34,016
which is where you two
should be right now.

662
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,856
- Yeah, yeah, Bill, we gotta go.

663
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:38,108
- Yeah, listen to your
buddy, I feel like things

664
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:42,109
are gonna get a whole lot
worse before daybreak.

665
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:52,408
- Uh well, it's been fun, but I gotta run.

666
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:54,823
Come on, are you coming with me?

667
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:57,028
- Come on, we can't leave now.

668
00:42:57,029 --> 00:42:58,358
- Uh, sure we can.

669
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:00,359
Come on, Bill, let's go.

670
00:43:01,689 --> 00:43:03,056
- No, I'm gonna stay.

671
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:06,716
- Suit yourself, I'm gonna
go back into town and uh,

672
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:07,808
grab some help, alright?

673
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:10,408
I'll be back with some firepower.

674
00:43:10,409 --> 00:43:11,243
- Thanks.

675
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,580
(eerie music)

676
00:43:57,651 --> 00:43:59,320
You're going the wrong way.

677
00:43:59,321 --> 00:44:04,018
- Look, kid, I told you
to go home, now beat it.

678
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,738
- You see this sign?

679
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:09,468
- Yeah, what's it mean, pirates are here?

680
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:11,219
- Maybe danger, Hank.

681
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:14,668
This tunnel leads to
the one that collapsed

682
00:44:14,669 --> 00:44:16,078
and killed those miners.

683
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,818
- Yeah well, the readings
I'm getting indicate

684
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:21,078
some kind of movement down here.

685
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,089
- I really think you're
going the wrong way.

686
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:28,596
You see, this one, the one with the wood,

687
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:30,181
that's a lot safer.

688
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:34,155
- Alright.

689
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,386
How did you get to be such
an expert on this place?

690
00:45:01,388 --> 00:45:03,248
- I did a project on the Knollwood Mines.

691
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:05,666
(clattering)

692
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:18,473
You know they say this place is haunted.

693
00:45:18,474 --> 00:45:20,953
- Haunted miners I could deal with.

694
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:23,253
I just hope we don't run
into any more crossing guards

695
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,086
with bad dental plans.

696
00:45:36,994 --> 00:45:39,244
There's a light down there.

697
00:45:53,796 --> 00:45:57,546
- [Denvers] Everyone is
gathered, it is time.

698
00:46:01,856 --> 00:46:03,024
- Mr. Denvers?

699
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:10,568
That was my history teacher,
what is he doing with that--

700
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,901
- Extraterrestrial that used to be Mike.

701
00:46:15,749 --> 00:46:18,600
- [Bill] This stuff doesn't
happen for real, does it?

702
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:20,851
- [Hank] Don't ask me, kid.

703
00:46:35,214 --> 00:46:39,169
- Man, (pants) somebody's
gone to a lot of trouble

704
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,630
to make this mine home.

705
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:45,799
- Master Vlathos traveled
great distances to find this.

706
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:49,701
At the time he arrived,

707
00:46:49,703 --> 00:46:53,561
it had already been found by a mortal man.

708
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:55,729
The humans did not realize

709
00:46:58,384 --> 00:47:02,551
the awesome power they had
unearthed, but Vlathos knew.

710
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:05,901
He snatched it away from them.

711
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,374
I give you...

712
00:47:11,151 --> 00:47:12,984
The Light of the Moon!

713
00:47:14,224 --> 00:47:17,641
(aliens growl and snarl)

714
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:22,541
This is no ordinary gemstone.

715
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:25,449
There are only two others like
it on this earth which come

716
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:28,784
close to its power and beauty, but this,

717
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:33,939
this one forms the centerpiece
of the Trinity of Darkness.

718
00:47:35,513 --> 00:47:39,010
When the Trinity comes together,

719
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:41,844
the light of the Sun and the Moon,

720
00:47:42,919 --> 00:47:45,419
will forever leave this world.

721
00:47:48,979 --> 00:47:53,828
And this Earth will be plunged
forever into eternal darkness

722
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,080
then, children,

723
00:47:56,899 --> 00:47:58,481
my master, Vlathos,

724
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:03,270
will call his people from the stars,

725
00:48:03,271 --> 00:48:08,040
and Knollwood will serve as
their first feeding ground

726
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:11,708
and you will live forever
as their servants.

727
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:15,911
(Vlathos snarls)

728
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:20,756
(aliens snarl and growl)

729
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,946
(Vlathos snarls)

730
00:48:39,278 --> 00:48:42,013
(gems chime)

731
00:48:42,014 --> 00:48:45,431
(aliens snarl and growl)

732
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:59,731
- I have been waiting for centuries

733
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:01,899
for this moment to arrive.

734
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:08,471
In a few hours, the
Sun shall rise and fall

735
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:12,056
on the town of Knollwood
for the last time.

736
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:17,590
Tomorrow at this hour, the
Moon will walk the sky,

737
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:22,021
and when it crawls with the Sun,

738
00:49:22,023 --> 00:49:23,856
blackness shall reign.

739
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:29,525
And the minions of the
Moon will rule the Earth!

740
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,620
(roars)

741
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,290
(whooshes)

742
00:49:50,116 --> 00:49:54,285
- Oh man, the Sun and Moon
did something to that diamond?

743
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,166
That's bad, right?

744
00:49:57,168 --> 00:49:58,286
- That's bad.

745
00:49:58,288 --> 00:49:59,658
It's very bad.

746
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:02,458
It's very, very, very, very bad.

747
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:04,376
- So what do we do now?

748
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:08,738
- We can't leave here
without bringing the stone.

749
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,646
Take it to a phone, call
somebody with some experience

750
00:50:11,648 --> 00:50:14,315
in dealing with stuff like this.

751
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:23,491
What?

752
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,948
You're gonna get yourself killed.

753
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:29,199
(whispers)

754
00:50:33,138 --> 00:50:34,516
What can we do to stop them?

755
00:50:34,518 --> 00:50:36,518
We're two guys, come on.

756
00:50:39,438 --> 00:50:43,408
- I don't see my sister
up there, or Paula.

757
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:46,226
But those people, those
creatures look pretty much

758
00:50:46,228 --> 00:50:48,436
like the people from my paper route.

759
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:51,005
That means Vlathos has a new
diamond not too far from home.

760
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:51,924
- Let's go.

761
00:50:57,156 --> 00:51:01,324
(wolf howls)
(eerie atmospheric music)

762
00:51:04,426 --> 00:51:08,593
(Andy snarls)
(girl screams)

763
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:20,633
- [TV Reporter] Communication
lines are sketchy,

764
00:51:20,635 --> 00:51:22,553
in and out of Knollwood.

765
00:51:22,555 --> 00:51:25,473
Channel 8's reporter on the
scene has been out of contact

766
00:51:25,474 --> 00:51:28,073
with us for the last two hours.

767
00:51:28,075 --> 00:51:30,971
We have unconfirmed reports
of more strange lights

768
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:33,371
and even the Moon itself--
- Oh, hi, Billy.

769
00:51:33,373 --> 00:51:34,851
- Goodnight, Mom.

770
00:51:34,853 --> 00:51:36,531
- Goodnight, honey.

771
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:38,411
- [TV Reporter] Yes, it looks
like a good night to stay

772
00:51:38,413 --> 00:51:42,580
inside and just watch our
midnight late-night horror flick.

773
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:47,731
(dark piano music)

774
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,816
(knocks)

775
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:23,916
(door creaks)

776
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:37,969
(wolf howls)

777
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:45,116
(moody rock music)

778
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:17,520
- [Hank] You showed up.

779
00:53:17,521 --> 00:53:19,521
- What choice do I have?

780
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:22,296
Did you try her cellphone again?

781
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:23,246
- Nothing.

782
00:53:23,248 --> 00:53:25,688
Long-distance phone lines
are down, I even went back

783
00:53:25,689 --> 00:53:27,898
to the sheriff's office
and tried the radio.

784
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:30,448
Vlathos has generated some
kind of interference field

785
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:31,718
over the whole town.

786
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:34,026
I tried driving out, but
there was sheriff's car with

787
00:53:34,028 --> 00:53:37,111
Mr. Jonas deputy blocking the bridge.

788
00:53:38,571 --> 00:53:40,809
- So what are we doing in a library?

789
00:53:40,811 --> 00:53:44,278
Shouldn't we be out trying
something like, I don't know,

790
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,565
sharpening stakes or hanging
garlic from the street lights?

791
00:53:47,566 --> 00:53:49,749
- 'Cause I am not gonna go up
and stick a garden stake into

792
00:53:49,751 --> 00:53:53,918
that bad boy unless I know
he's not gonna stake me back.

793
00:53:54,971 --> 00:53:57,558
I'm a scientist, Bill, I don't
commit to a line of action

794
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,898
unless I have empirical evidence.

795
00:54:00,899 --> 00:54:03,429
- And you joined SETI
because their filing cabinets

796
00:54:03,431 --> 00:54:05,515
are filled with evidence?

797
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:11,658
- My father picked this
up in Roswell, New Mexico.

798
00:54:14,191 --> 00:54:15,789
- Roswell?

799
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:19,958
The Roswell, the UFO Area 51,
men in black, that Roswell?

800
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:22,270
- He picked it up at the crash site.

801
00:54:22,271 --> 00:54:23,679
He was there that night.

802
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:25,764
Part of the cleanup crew.

803
00:54:26,961 --> 00:54:28,618
He spent the rest of his
life trying to tell anyone

804
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,953
who'd listen what he'd seen.

805
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,818
I was one of the ones who listened.

806
00:54:36,621 --> 00:54:38,204
Empirical evidence.

807
00:54:47,683 --> 00:54:50,849
(otherworldly chimes)

808
00:54:58,424 --> 00:54:59,580
- Ready to go, coach.

809
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:01,260
Team's suited up and ready to go.

810
00:55:01,261 --> 00:55:03,281
- Any sign of Andy or Randy?

811
00:55:03,283 --> 00:55:04,749
- Not yet.

812
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:07,530
What'll we do if they don't show?

813
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:12,071
- Well, I'll just have to
alter my game-plan, then.

814
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:14,323
I wanna show you something.

815
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,911
- The Sun.
- What?

816
00:55:18,913 --> 00:55:22,189
- The Sun, sunlight, each one
of these agrees on one thing.

817
00:55:22,191 --> 00:55:23,441
Check this out.

818
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:27,209
If a vampire is exposed
to sunlight, it will burn,

819
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:29,699
and if enough of him is
burnt, it will kill him.

820
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,161
And you don't even have
to get close to this guy,

821
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:33,169
we'll just phase him with sunlight.

822
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:35,201
- What about his little undead army?

823
00:55:35,203 --> 00:55:39,511
- Okay, they're not
immortal until the head guy,

824
00:55:39,513 --> 00:55:41,711
Dracula, Vlathos, says they are.

825
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,671
They can walk around in
the sun all they want.

826
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,591
That's why they're useful to him.

827
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,630
But they'd die like everyone else.

828
00:55:47,631 --> 00:55:49,290
We'll just drop a big rock on 'em,

829
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,659
or hit them with a cave pin, anything.

830
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:54,244
- Bill, they're your neighbors.

831
00:55:56,261 --> 00:56:00,610
- Hank, anyone trying to bite
me and turn me into some kind

832
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:05,241
of space vampire is officially
no longer my teacher,

833
00:56:05,243 --> 00:56:07,826
my neighbor, or my best friend.

834
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:11,020
Anyway, they should turn back to normal,

835
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:14,111
if we take out the head vampire.

836
00:56:14,113 --> 00:56:14,946
In theory.

837
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:17,260
- In theory?

838
00:56:17,261 --> 00:56:18,094
- Yep.

839
00:56:19,061 --> 00:56:20,290
(Hank sighs)

840
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:22,671
- Man, I need more coffee.

841
00:56:22,673 --> 00:56:24,173
I need a computer.

842
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:28,719
(spectators cheer)

843
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:31,779
- [Announcer] Let's warmly
welcome our visiting team,

844
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:33,949
the Huntsville Goldbagger.

845
00:56:35,313 --> 00:56:38,146
(spectators jeer)

846
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:43,249
And now, making their way onto the pitch,

847
00:56:43,251 --> 00:56:46,251
our home team, the Knollwood Wolves!

848
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:51,140
(spectators cheer and applaud)

849
00:56:55,756 --> 00:56:58,339
(machine hums)

850
00:57:09,756 --> 00:57:12,339
- That is one sick lookin' Sun.

851
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:18,098
- Nothing.

852
00:57:19,585 --> 00:57:20,819
Alright.

853
00:57:20,821 --> 00:57:21,654
Okay.

854
00:57:23,684 --> 00:57:26,773
Vlathos said, "when
the Moon walks the sky,

855
00:57:26,774 --> 00:57:28,593
"and crawls with the Sun,"
he was talking about--

856
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:30,384
- The lunar eclipse, it's tonight.

857
00:57:30,386 --> 00:57:33,633
- Yeah, now a total lunar
eclipse occurs when the Sun,

858
00:57:33,635 --> 00:57:36,163
Earth and Moon are in a straight line,

859
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,734
and the shadow of the
Earth falls on the Moon.

860
00:57:38,736 --> 00:57:41,633
Now when this happens, there's
a distant gravitational line

861
00:57:41,635 --> 00:57:44,513
from the Sun to the Moon that
passes through the Earth.

862
00:57:44,515 --> 00:57:48,515
This lineup does wonky
things with tides, but...

863
00:57:50,856 --> 00:57:53,533
It also creates power point,
a mini gravitational well

864
00:57:53,535 --> 00:57:55,363
on the Moon's side of the Earth.

865
00:57:55,364 --> 00:57:57,343
- So, why Knollwood?

866
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:58,761
- It's the nexus.

867
00:58:01,254 --> 00:58:04,443
- So we're in direct line
between the Sun and the Moon.

868
00:58:04,444 --> 00:58:06,383
That's why Vlathos is here now.

869
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:07,491
(Hank sighs)

870
00:58:07,493 --> 00:58:11,858
- And you thought he was
here for the soccer finals.

871
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:13,418
- White and red, red and white.

872
00:58:13,419 --> 00:58:16,128
Red and white are here to fight.

873
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,618
Watch your back 'cause
Knollwood Wolves will attack.

874
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,938
All you people over here we
need to hear you loud and clear.

875
00:58:21,939 --> 00:58:23,598
Stomp your feet, clap your hands.

876
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,734
Make some noise in the stands,
cheer our boys to victory.

877
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,305
- Excuse me now.

878
00:58:28,306 --> 00:58:29,140
Thank you.

879
00:58:31,606 --> 00:58:35,016
- There's hardly anybody here.
- I know.

880
00:58:35,018 --> 00:58:36,828
- We need to hear you loud and clear.

881
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:38,828
Stomp your feet, clap your hands.

882
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:40,661
- Hi, Kev.
- Hi, Kevin.

883
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,020
- Is Bill with you?

884
00:58:45,116 --> 00:58:47,866
- No, (mumbles).

885
00:58:52,756 --> 00:58:54,354
- [Cheerleaders] Stomp your
feet and clap your hands.

886
00:58:54,356 --> 00:58:58,044
Make some noise in the stands,
cheer our boys to victory.

887
00:58:58,046 --> 00:59:00,545
Red and white, red and
white are here to fight.

888
00:59:00,546 --> 00:59:02,164
High school players, watch your back.

889
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:03,884
Knollwood Wolves will attack.

890
00:59:03,886 --> 00:59:07,315
All you people over here we
need to hear you loud and clear.

891
00:59:07,316 --> 00:59:08,994
Stomp your feet, clap your hands.

892
00:59:08,996 --> 00:59:10,256
Make some noise in the stands.

893
00:59:10,258 --> 00:59:12,176
- Are they ready, coach?

894
00:59:12,178 --> 00:59:16,344
- I've found them, they
should be here any minute.

895
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,916
(audience cheers and applauds)

896
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:33,035
You boys had better be ready to play.

897
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:35,504
- Rip roaring and ready, coach.

898
00:59:35,506 --> 00:59:38,864
- We've been practicing.
- Yeah, all night practicing.

899
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:43,035
- Go get changed and cleaned
up, you've got two minutes.

900
01:00:01,186 --> 01:00:04,186
(suspenseful music)

901
01:00:28,005 --> 01:00:31,068
(phone bleeps)

902
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:31,901
- Okay.

903
01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:36,461
Come on, internet, don't fail me now.

904
01:00:38,155 --> 01:00:39,053
(computer bleeps)

905
01:00:39,054 --> 01:00:42,721
(machine zaps and crackles)

906
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:52,364
Hm.

907
01:00:53,479 --> 01:00:56,028
I guess Danvers and his
alien buddy or his vampires,

908
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:59,249
they've obviously shut
down the access to the net.

909
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:00,969
(Bill sighs)

910
01:01:00,971 --> 01:01:03,998
- Actually, my server sometimes does that

911
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,249
if I key in a bad password.

912
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,378
Hey, check this out.

913
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:13,379
The first recorded lunar
eclipse was in June 1849.

914
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:16,398
That's the same night that the
mine collapsed, and it's also

915
01:01:16,399 --> 01:01:19,848
the night that the Light of
the Moon diamond disappeared.

916
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:24,016
- Then there's another one in
1869, 1889, 1939, 1959, 1979.

917
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:28,438
- Every 20 years.

918
01:01:28,439 --> 01:01:30,749
And something weird and
unexplained happens every time.

919
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,809
People disappear, lights in the sky.

920
01:01:33,811 --> 01:01:35,811
- Even in a plane crash.

921
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:42,744
- Danvers.

922
01:01:44,611 --> 01:01:47,169
- This is a very special game,

923
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:50,270
and this is a very special day.

924
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:54,478
I want you guys to play
like there's no tomorrow.

925
01:01:54,479 --> 01:01:55,518
- [Players] Yeah!

926
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,689
- [Danvers] Let's make Huntsville
pay for all those years

927
01:01:57,691 --> 01:02:00,478
they won and we lost.
- Yeah!

928
01:02:00,479 --> 01:02:03,729
- Let's show them why
Knollwood rules the day!

929
01:02:03,731 --> 01:02:04,849
- [Players] Yeah!

930
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:09,018
Knollwood, Knollwood,
Knollwood, Knollwood, Knollwood!

931
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:18,171
(suspenseful music)

932
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,528
(whistle blows)

933
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,798
- [Man] Hey, let's go!

934
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:31,966
(lively music)
(players shout)

935
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:36,174
- Come on!

936
01:02:42,036 --> 01:02:46,555
(spectators cheer and applaud)

937
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:48,973
(Mom laughs)

938
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,641
(otherworldly tones)

939
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,679
- Wow, there's light, but no heat.

940
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:28,758
- Hey, hey!

941
01:03:28,759 --> 01:03:29,918
Don't touch that.

942
01:03:29,919 --> 01:03:31,849
That shaft is pure sunlight.

943
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,588
The Trinity wants the Sun's
light, not its energy, but

944
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:36,728
if nothing else, that'll give
you the world's fastest tan.

945
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:37,996
- Cool.

946
01:03:37,998 --> 01:03:40,664
(Hank chuckles)

947
01:03:44,349 --> 01:03:46,849
(moody music)

948
01:03:59,186 --> 01:04:01,936
(machine bleeps)

949
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:15,891
Ready?

950
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:29,914
(aliens snore and snarl)

951
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:49,244
- They say the darkest spot
is just beneath the candle.

952
01:04:49,246 --> 01:04:50,769
- A spot that is gonna make it difficult

953
01:04:50,771 --> 01:04:52,889
to get that diamond.

954
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:56,548
Best friends don't make
the best welcome mat.

955
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:58,298
- I already sense that.

956
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,809
You wanna wait till their
alarm goes off or...

957
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:02,209
- I got the trigger.

958
01:05:02,211 --> 01:05:04,461
- And I lost the coin toss.

959
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:29,565
Wish me luck.

960
01:05:45,689 --> 01:05:46,523
- Hank!

961
01:05:53,828 --> 01:05:55,278
I'm so happy it's you.

962
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,998
- Paula, what happened?
- I don't know.

963
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,578
I blacked out at the van and when came out

964
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,849
I was surrounded by this.

965
01:06:00,851 --> 01:06:02,729
I am ever glad to see you.

966
01:06:02,731 --> 01:06:04,678
- Mike's one of them now.
- I know, I know.

967
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:07,530
We have to get out of here.

968
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,678
- No, Paula.
- Why not?

969
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:10,888
- There's something we have to do.

970
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:12,038
- What do you wanna do?

971
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,714
- [Hank] Listen, I want
you to just stay here.

972
01:06:14,716 --> 01:06:15,883
- Hank.
- Holy!

973
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:22,296
(Paula snarls)

974
01:06:22,298 --> 01:06:23,968
(spectators shout and cheer)

975
01:06:23,969 --> 01:06:25,498
(whistle blows)

976
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:28,023
(spectators cheer and applaud)

977
01:06:28,024 --> 01:06:30,183
- Knollwood Wolves on the attack.

978
01:06:30,184 --> 01:06:32,803
Come so brave on their back.

979
01:06:32,804 --> 01:06:33,636
Go Jesse!

980
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:35,369
Woo!

981
01:06:41,846 --> 01:06:45,096
(Randy and Andy snarl)

982
01:06:51,486 --> 01:06:52,714
(whistle blows)

983
01:06:52,716 --> 01:06:54,244
- Way to go, boys!

984
01:06:54,246 --> 01:06:55,266
Good work!

985
01:06:55,268 --> 01:06:57,214
(spectators cheer)

986
01:06:57,216 --> 01:06:59,635
That's it, Jesse, keep it up!

987
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:07,254
(otherworldly chimes)

988
01:07:20,018 --> 01:07:24,929
(suspenseful music)
(aliens snarl and yawn)

989
01:07:24,931 --> 01:07:28,756
(lively music)
(spectators cheer)

990
01:07:28,758 --> 01:07:31,431
(whistle blows)

991
01:07:31,433 --> 01:07:34,290
Take five, boys, we've
got this one in the bag!

992
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:37,374
(cheerleaders cheer)

993
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:39,739
- Hey, you!

994
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:42,625
You're all sweaty.

995
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:45,829
- Katie, I've got something to tell you.

996
01:07:45,831 --> 01:07:46,664
Come here.

997
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:50,189
It's about Andy and Randy.

998
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,044
- They're on fire today, aren't they?

999
01:07:52,046 --> 01:07:53,981
Maybe you were right,
maybe it is just the game

1000
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,909
that makes them act a little weird.

1001
01:07:55,911 --> 01:07:58,211
- [Jesse] Actually, it's a
little bit more than that.

1002
01:07:58,213 --> 01:08:01,101
(Katie screams)

1003
01:08:01,103 --> 01:08:03,769
(whistle blows)

1004
01:08:06,603 --> 01:08:09,186
(Paula snarls)

1005
01:08:20,441 --> 01:08:22,941
(Bill chokes)

1006
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,551
- Welcome to the dark, bug.

1007
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:31,779
- Try somethin'.

1008
01:08:31,781 --> 01:08:34,531
(Vlathos grunts)

1009
01:08:35,989 --> 01:08:37,468
- Swiss.

1010
01:08:37,469 --> 01:08:38,386
Good steel.

1011
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,308
(laughs)

1012
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:43,130
For carving apples.

1013
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:45,464
Not exactly a killing blade.

1014
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,446
- Oh, my glasses!

1015
01:09:00,499 --> 01:09:02,583
(groans)

1016
01:09:07,261 --> 01:09:08,580
Paula!

1017
01:09:08,581 --> 01:09:09,414
That hurt!

1018
01:09:11,861 --> 01:09:14,444
(aliens snarl)

1019
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:17,749
This is not funny.

1020
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,766
Take off, we'll lose the
dentures and let's go home, huh?

1021
01:09:23,861 --> 01:09:25,694
- Join us, little man.

1022
01:09:27,861 --> 01:09:32,029
We need as much young blood
as we can get in our army.

1023
01:09:33,509 --> 01:09:37,676
Soon your little town will
forever say goodbye to the Sun,

1024
01:09:38,669 --> 01:09:40,359
and the Moon.

1025
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:44,528
And remember, in the
darkness, there is no choice.

1026
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:50,070
Join us now, or you will
become a midnight snack

1027
01:09:51,161 --> 01:09:52,328
for my people.

1028
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,769
- Hank!

1029
01:10:00,771 --> 01:10:04,615
My neighbors are getting a
little out of control here.

1030
01:10:04,616 --> 01:10:06,476
- The snake pit.

1031
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:07,728
Go on, get off!

1032
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,329
I'm serious, back!

1033
01:10:12,799 --> 01:10:15,929
(aliens groan)

1034
01:10:15,931 --> 01:10:19,848
(spectators cheer and applaud)

1035
01:10:26,254 --> 01:10:27,914
- Cheer our boys to victory.

1036
01:10:27,916 --> 01:10:29,673
Huntsville players turn and flee.

1037
01:10:29,674 --> 01:10:31,404
There's only one thing left to say.

1038
01:10:31,406 --> 01:10:33,906
Knollwood Wolves rule the day.

1039
01:10:42,384 --> 01:10:44,135
- Almost there, boys.

1040
01:10:45,773 --> 01:10:46,856
Almost there.

1041
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:55,759
- Hey! (grunts)

1042
01:10:58,853 --> 01:11:01,103
- I am tired of you, human.

1043
01:11:03,483 --> 01:11:05,703
- I think this is yours!

1044
01:11:05,704 --> 01:11:08,536
(Vlathos screams)

1045
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,168
(Vlathos screams)

1046
01:11:17,169 --> 01:11:19,919
- Don't foul him, don't foul him!

1047
01:11:21,141 --> 01:11:21,988
- Coach?

1048
01:11:21,989 --> 01:11:25,229
- Coach, are you okay?
- Are you okay?

1049
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:29,399
(otherworldly chimes)
(Vlathos screams)

1050
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:32,593
- No!

1051
01:11:40,946 --> 01:11:43,613
(whistle blows)

1052
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,234
- Oh my god.

1053
01:11:54,236 --> 01:11:56,903
(whistle blows)

1054
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:06,989
- What?

1055
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:08,590
- What is that?

1056
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:11,099
(Kevin snarls)

1057
01:12:11,101 --> 01:12:12,601
- Sit down, Kevin.

1058
01:12:17,184 --> 01:12:18,434
- Take me home.

1059
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:20,466
It's awful.

1060
01:12:21,641 --> 01:12:25,809
(chimes)
(Vlathos screams)

1061
01:12:27,316 --> 01:12:28,234
- Get them!

1062
01:12:29,618 --> 01:12:30,451
Get them!

1063
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:34,428
(screams)

1064
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:38,979
- Jesse.

1065
01:12:40,968 --> 01:12:41,968
Andy, Randy.

1066
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,091
To me.

1067
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:56,846
Let's bring the girl, her
brother's giving us trouble.

1068
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:02,989
- What's the little dweeb done this time?

1069
01:13:02,991 --> 01:13:05,324
(all snarl)

1070
01:13:10,054 --> 01:13:10,888
- Now!

1071
01:13:11,806 --> 01:13:14,556
(machine bleeps)

1072
01:13:27,094 --> 01:13:29,844
(Vlathos groans)

1073
01:13:50,324 --> 01:13:52,449
- It's only sunlight.

1074
01:13:52,451 --> 01:13:54,973
- Kinda like the way it
brightens up the place, you know?

1075
01:13:54,974 --> 01:13:58,984
- You can stand there and
mock with immunity, humans,

1076
01:13:58,986 --> 01:14:02,653
for less than five
minutes, but you can see,

1077
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:05,984
the Trinity of the Darkness,

1078
01:14:05,986 --> 01:14:08,933
it still drinks the light of your Sun.

1079
01:14:08,934 --> 01:14:12,351
In 212 seconds, this light will be spent.

1080
01:14:14,453 --> 01:14:16,953
The Sun will set on the world,

1081
01:14:18,014 --> 01:14:20,265
for a final time, and then,

1082
01:14:21,234 --> 01:14:25,401
we'll see where this taunting
of your master gets you.

1083
01:14:26,535 --> 01:14:28,693
- But your power won't be
complete until the total lunar

1084
01:14:28,694 --> 01:14:30,585
eclipse lines up with
the Sun and the Moon.

1085
01:14:30,586 --> 01:14:32,483
(Vlathos laughs)

1086
01:14:32,484 --> 01:14:36,651
- I am amazed by how dense
this human race truly is.

1087
01:14:37,894 --> 01:14:40,644
And you, a fledgling space cadet.

1088
01:14:42,674 --> 01:14:46,841
When the Sun sets, the
security vents dies with it.

1089
01:14:48,733 --> 01:14:50,083
(laughs)

1090
01:14:50,084 --> 01:14:51,203
- What happens to the Light of the Moon

1091
01:14:51,204 --> 01:14:53,504
once it's sucked in all the light?

1092
01:14:53,506 --> 01:14:55,211
Who will handle it for you?

1093
01:14:55,213 --> 01:14:56,593
It can't be one of these losers.

1094
01:14:56,595 --> 01:14:58,676
- That's where I come in.

1095
01:15:01,315 --> 01:15:02,451
- Katie!

1096
01:15:02,453 --> 01:15:06,929
- As you can see, Bill, I am
unaffected by the Sun's light.

1097
01:15:06,931 --> 01:15:11,053
Therefor I will be the bearer
of the Light of the Moon,

1098
01:15:11,054 --> 01:15:14,804
and I will sit at Master
Vlathos' right hand,

1099
01:15:16,018 --> 01:15:18,541
ruling the armies of the night.

1100
01:15:18,543 --> 01:15:20,793
(chuckles)

1101
01:15:22,783 --> 01:15:25,366
I would reserve a special place

1102
01:15:26,903 --> 01:15:29,736
for you and my young friend there.

1103
01:15:31,414 --> 01:15:32,914
But unfortunately,

1104
01:15:33,844 --> 01:15:38,011
you both would last only a
very short time in the dark.

1105
01:15:39,404 --> 01:15:42,130
- You know, I hate the dark.

1106
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:44,073
You can't see anything and
you're always out buying

1107
01:15:44,075 --> 01:15:47,575
flashlight batteries, it is such a hassle.

1108
01:15:50,575 --> 01:15:53,341
- But if you had one of these,
you wouldn't have to worry

1109
01:15:53,343 --> 01:15:57,509
about paying an electric bill
for the next 2,000 years!

1110
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:08,106
- The Sun has set, the
diamond is unstable,

1111
01:16:09,203 --> 01:16:12,000
until the eclipse is completed.

1112
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:13,669
Have a care with it.

1113
01:16:17,084 --> 01:16:17,916
- Bill?

1114
01:16:19,153 --> 01:16:23,320
You hold the light of the Sun
and the Moon in your hands.

1115
01:16:26,176 --> 01:16:30,344
It's a volatile and dangerous
thing for everyone here.

1116
01:16:32,804 --> 01:16:35,305
Including you and your sister.

1117
01:16:37,075 --> 01:16:39,658
(aliens snarl)

1118
01:16:40,936 --> 01:16:43,693
Katie, make your brother behave.

1119
01:16:43,694 --> 01:16:44,526
- Billy.

1120
01:16:45,683 --> 01:16:48,911
You've always wanted something
like this to be true.

1121
01:16:48,913 --> 01:16:50,153
- Forget it, Katie.

1122
01:16:50,155 --> 01:16:53,173
When was the last time I did
anything you asked me to do?

1123
01:16:53,174 --> 01:16:54,583
This is the only way.

1124
01:16:54,585 --> 01:16:55,823
- Child!

1125
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:58,014
Give me the diamond now!

1126
01:16:58,016 --> 01:17:01,436
And I will spare you and your kin.

1127
01:17:01,438 --> 01:17:03,104
- I tell you what, you take these two,

1128
01:17:03,106 --> 01:17:05,005
and we keep that one and
we'll call it square, huh?

1129
01:17:05,006 --> 01:17:06,408
(Vlathos screams)

1130
01:17:06,409 --> 01:17:08,241
- Give me the diamond!

1131
01:17:10,769 --> 01:17:11,601
- Okay!

1132
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:19,161
(Vlathos screams)

1133
01:17:20,626 --> 01:17:22,374
- [Vlathos] My people!

1134
01:17:22,376 --> 01:17:24,545
(screams)

1135
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:40,193
(people talking over each other)

1136
01:17:42,336 --> 01:17:46,086
(peaceful atmospheric music)

1137
01:18:25,884 --> 01:18:30,051
(group cheer)
(upbeat music)

1138
01:18:45,816 --> 01:18:47,476
- Hey, thanks for being such a loser,

1139
01:18:47,478 --> 01:18:49,944
and not listening to
your sister back there.

1140
01:18:49,946 --> 01:18:52,333
- I promise I never will.

1141
01:18:52,334 --> 01:18:53,166
- Katie!

1142
01:18:56,368 --> 01:18:57,201
- Momma.

1143
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:06,799
- Oh, man.

1144
01:19:06,801 --> 01:19:08,553
I missed all the good stuff.

1145
01:19:08,555 --> 01:19:12,721
All I did all day was watch
some stupid soccer game.

1146
01:19:17,651 --> 01:19:18,484
Weird guy.

1147
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:20,719
- So how did we do?

1148
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:22,583
- Well, we lost, by default,

1149
01:19:22,585 --> 01:19:26,751
because Jesse here bit the ref. (chuckles)

1150
01:19:28,585 --> 01:19:30,423
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

1151
01:19:30,424 --> 01:19:32,011
- You didn't miss everything.

1152
01:19:32,013 --> 01:19:35,479
If Vlathos is dead, his
spaceship is still here.

1153
01:19:35,481 --> 01:19:36,814
- No way!
- Yeah.

1154
01:19:38,113 --> 01:19:38,946
- Well...

1155
01:19:42,571 --> 01:19:43,904
Hello, Pulitzer.

1156
01:20:11,686 --> 01:20:14,686
(suspenseful tones)

1157
01:20:22,769 --> 01:20:26,186
(moody electronic music)
