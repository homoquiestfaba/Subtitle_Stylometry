1
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,925
What the hell, Nick?

2
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,791
There he is on the sidewalk.

3
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,694
No, he's not. He's in the trunk.

4
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,301
No, on the sidewalk.

5
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,729
I'm sure this time.

6
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,968
Thank you.

7
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:08,205
Well, well. Country Mouse and
City Mouse make good.

8
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,609
Why, I'm impressed.

9
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,011
I'm so glad.

10
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,483
There's a fine line
between luck and skill.

11
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,247
In fact, there's no line at all.

12
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,051
Boss wants to see you.

13
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,350
So.

14
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,890
How did you find
the son of a bitch?

15
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,550
Grace of God. Nick spotted him.

16
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,220
- Alone?
- No bags, no protection.

17
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,299
- Spend any time with him?
- No.

18
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,202
Good. Well, we'll just
let him sweat it out.

19
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,433
We should do him somewhere else.

20
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,135
- Why?
- Duncan.

21
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,481
- Claire?
- What does he do for us anyway?

22
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,448
You just don't trust him
because he doesn't carry.

23
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,646
What happened to, "Do it
yourself and it gets done right"?

24
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,888
The business has changed, you know?

25
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,561
Duncan saves us taxes.
Keeps us clean.

26
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,789
He's introduced us
to a world of money.

27
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,490
A lot that matters if people
walk away with it.

28
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,303
It's not about money.

29
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,665
It's about perception of strength.

30
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,079
Claire, did you think of that
all by yourself?

31
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,504
The bagman was your responsibility.

32
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,776
The loss of that money is your fault.
You're fucking useless.

33
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,079
Now that we've thanked
our foot soldier...

34
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,951
...for the invaluable work contributed
today, please dismiss yourself.

35
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,387
Fuck you.

36
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,018
The Boss and I have some important
financial matters to discuss.

37
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:09,598
Numbers? You know,
things you wouldn't understand.

38
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:16,037
Hey! Hey, friends, friends, come on.
We'll get it out of Koo.

39
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,168
Don't shush me.

40
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,084
Fuller.

41
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,521
We tossed Koo's house.
Wife's gone. I checked the airlines.

42
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,789
Simms, check her credit. Boulez,
get on everyone who moves paper.

43
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,933
Let them deny things
and then drop that we've got Koo.

44
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,160
We're gonna break him.
If they know anything, they'll spill.

45
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,202
When's The Boss
gonna squeeze Koo?

46
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,135
When he's ready.

47
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,403
- All right, boys. I'm in.
- Fresh blood.

48
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,309
I could use a challenge.

49
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,707
Take any more money from
this boy, hey...

50
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,477
...l'm gonna own him outright.

51
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,082
- What you looking at?
- What the fuck?

52
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,056
Stupid little girl's gonna get
your balls in a vice.

53
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,596
The mass of men lead
lives of quiet desperation.

54
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,998
Thoreau?

55
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:57,166
- Amazing.
- I'm surprised you talk to me.

56
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,369
The Boss doesn't see in me
the threat he sees in others.

57
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,446
Why? You don't like girls?

58
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,887
My medications have taken their toll.

59
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,120
If I could do whatever I wanted...

60
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,524
...I wouldn't sit around here
playing poker all day.

61
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,431
They're just tools for The Boss.

62
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,127
They have no idea how
badly they're being used.

63
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,497
Everyone is a tool for someone.

64
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,735
The thing to consider is what
exactly one should be used for.

65
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,747
It's convenient Claire brought
the bagman without the bag.

66
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:49,361
No, Claire's solid. I trust her.
This is the only life she knows.

67
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,357
- That's obvious enough.
- Don't piss her off. It's not smart.

68
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,765
All right, look. Until we
get a handle on this problem...

69
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,997
...l'm thinking we should shift
some of our capital abroad.

70
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,401
Will it cost us?

71
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,437
We'll be in profit in 30 days,
trust me.

72
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,946
- I trust results.
- Precisely.

73
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,914
Do it.

74
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,715
Wait! There ain't two
of these in a deck of cards!

75
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,587
- Fucking piece of shit!
- You been robbing me all night.

76
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,786
What the fuck is going on?

77
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,489
Somebody was cheating, Boss.

78
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,727
Of course somebody was cheating.
You're a bunch of fucking criminals!

79
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,428
That is precisely
why this always happens!

80
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,098
If I see money on that table again,
I'll have Nick shoot you all.

81
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,904
Kitty, stay away from the boys.

82
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,598
That's it, forget it.

83
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,341
It's nice to see you, Kitty.

84
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:20,883
We haven't spoken for a while.
How was your day?

85
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,156
"It was fine, Duncan.

86
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,196
I mean, it was just like yesterday
and the day before that.

87
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,064
So slowly I work up
the courage to run away.

88
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,328
But I never get quite enough courage
to run really far away.

89
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,536
And then someone is sent
and I'm brought back...

90
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,403
...and I'm noticed by The Boss.

91
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,943
But it's only to punish me
for running away.

92
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,377
Because how does that reflect on him?

93
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,008
And then I'm back to sitting
in my niche, you know.

94
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,018
Bettering myself with books
that no one I know...

95
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,213
...can possibly appreciate.

96
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,326
I find myself hating them...

97
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,460
...more...

98
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,259
...and more...

99
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,963
...until I think...

100
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:13,833
...well, maybe it's time
to run away again."

101
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:21,076
Well, that sounds
like a bad day, Kitty.

102
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,605
- Pair of kings.
- Aces and eights.

103
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,880
- Two pair.
- Three nines.

104
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,981
Pair a threes.

105
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,185
Fuck!

106
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,339
Oh, fuck.

107
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,292
Now this is gambling.

108
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,066
Hey!

109
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,797
Hey!

110
00:12:55,508 --> 00:13:00,207
- My dad in?
- Yeah. He's in.

111
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,945
Hey, guys. Hey, check this out.

112
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:11,522
Look what I got.
It's a Glock 19, polymer frame, man...

113
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,715
...chamber for
9 millimeter parabellums.

114
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:18,091
Holds a 15 round magazine,
tritium night sights, silencer.

115
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,158
This thing's so light, man.
Feel how light that is.

116
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:28,864
- Yeah, kid, it's just great, kid.
- Don't call me a kid, all right?

117
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,668
Do they make them for men?

118
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,435
Who said that?

119
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,488
Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck!

120
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:17,053
Kitty, get upstairs and wait for me.

121
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,492
Bagman time!

122
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,134
Do you have anything
you'd like to share with us?

123
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,140
You fucked up big time.

124
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,811
Now, the good Dr. Wexler says
that you made your pickup...

125
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,791
...and then somehow you got lost
between there and here.

126
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:01,223
Now, I want the money and I want
whoever put you up to it.

127
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,273
I don't think you fully appreciate
your position.

128
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,007
If you did, you would
be spilling your guts...

129
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,242
...and praying
that I kill you quick...

130
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,512
...before I crush your balls
like grapes.

131
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,782
Oh, God. Please don't.
It wasn't supposed to go this way!

132
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,758
You're wrong, Koo. I think
it was supposed to go this way.

133
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,024
Somebody sent you out in public
knowing you'd get picked up.

134
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,329
You've been set up.
Now, I know you're scared...

135
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,669
...but listen carefully.
Your situation has changed.

136
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,801
You've been sold down the river.

137
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,680
Now, you have to think.

138
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,316
You are gonna be tortured
more heinously...

139
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:56,818
...than you can conceive of
by the man behind this desk.

140
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,589
There's only one way to avoid that.

141
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,819
There's only one way out.

142
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,326
What are you gonna do?

143
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,476
I had him! You did that on purpose.

144
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,140
What the hell was that?
You stupid sons of bitches!

145
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:29,048
I should fuck you all!
How did this happen?

146
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,382
- He's dead.
- Of course he is.

147
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,424
- Who didn't fucking search him?
- He was fucking clean!

148
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,460
- Obviously fucking not.
- Well, who was near the fuck?

149
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,726
I want you to find that money.
Duncan, whatever it takes!

150
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:47,463
You, you, get the fuck out of here.
Stupid sons of bitches!

151
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,205
He did not have that gun on him
when we brought him in.

152
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,213
What about Duncan?

153
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,745
- Duncan wasn't near him.
- Who was?

154
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,786
Jimmy.

155
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:17,297
- So, what are we gonna do now?
- Simms, cool it.

156
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,866
Give up the money
so the pressure's off.

157
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,442
When he relaxes
we'll get a better opportunity.

158
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,279
- What about Kitty?
- I didn't give her the gun.

159
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,287
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

160
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,053
Shit.

161
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,229
No one's ever smelled opportunity
on The Boss before.

162
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,198
You've been here...?

163
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,140
Twelve years.

164
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,110
It's a big world.
You should see more of it.

165
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,776
I can't just leave.
Everybody is vulnerable occasionally.

166
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,255
You don't cut out on friends.
It's more than just work.

167
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,089
Everything I have is
because of The Boss.

168
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,289
And if it wasn't for him,
you'd be what?

169
00:18:54,633 --> 00:19:00,731
- A Kitty? Married, dead, happy?
- I don't see you leaving.

170
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,397
Well, you've ruined me.

171
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,408
So...

172
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,882
Have you been back to the hospital?

173
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,653
Nope.

174
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,560
How long?

175
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,562
Not long.

176
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,434
You guys seen Kitty?

177
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,989
Shit!

178
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,127
<i>Koo moved the money.</i>

179
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,970
The money isn't the biggest
problem right now.

180
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,142
Kitty ran away.

181
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,274
Jesus Christ,
Duncan, she's gonna talk.

182
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,549
He'll probably send lves after her.

183
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,209
The new guy always gets
the shit end of the stick.

184
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,753
Get with him in case he finds her.

185
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:29,826
Start looking for her now.
Make it an overdose.

186
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:36,759
It's not my fault if you didn't think
to use the same hole twice!

187
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,437
Shit!

188
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,269
You know, when I was young,
I had this boss, Lazarre.

189
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,604
He used to talk a lot about
getting taken out.

190
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,576
And he always used to say,
"You gotta see it coming.

191
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,444
You gotta look for it where
you think it ain't.

192
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,109
You gotta look hard.
You gotta be fast...

193
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,552
...because even seeing it coming,
don't mean you can stop it."

194
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,658
So you killed him?

195
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,524
Damn right.

196
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,005
Know anything about last night?

197
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,476
I love you, Dad.

198
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,574
Well, I love you too, Jimmy.

199
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:32,519
- Did you do it? Did you?
- No, I...

200
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,452
Well, that's good. That's good, Jimmy.

201
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:44,833
Go pour yourself a shot of bourbon.
You took that one like a man.

202
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,246
Good morning, Claire.

203
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,651
How are things in the light of day?

204
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,347
- Okay so far.
- I like that.

205
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,658
You wanna watch this one
of mine, Jimmy.

206
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,421
You're gonna have to know
everything she knows...

207
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,063
...when you run things here.

208
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,526
Came with me all the way,
never fucks up.

209
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,798
Almost.

210
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,436
Kitty ran away last night.
I want you to go get her.

211
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,872
You kidding?

212
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:39,681
If it's about the gun, say so,
but don't hand me newbie work.

213
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:55,470
- Pussy patrol.
- Finally, a little respect.

214
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,837
Claire, take Jimmy with you.

215
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,980
It's only 22 ounces.
This thing's so damn light.

216
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:17,591
- What do you know?
- Hey, come on, give me that back.

217
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,924
Come on, give me that back
or I'm telling my dad. I'm serious.

218
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,100
Look, I'm warning you.
I'm serious, all right?

219
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,603
- In that case.
- Yeah, thought so.

220
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,870
Where we going, anyway?
We're supposed to look for Kitty.

221
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:37,674
Could you shut your yap, junior?
Perhaps you'll learn something.

222
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:44,156
I know you. You're nobody watching
this program alone late at night.

223
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:50,152
I know you. You're nobody watching
this program alone late at night.

224
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,388
So when I say, "What are you
waiting for?" you identify.

225
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,796
You say, "What am I waiting for?
I could take that step today."

226
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:02,099
So you shell out $39.95
for my book...

227
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:07,473
...you read it and you feel inspired,
really changed.

228
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,872
But then nothing happens.

229
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,575
For the first time,
you see what you have to do...

230
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,779
...and yet you lack the will
to do it...

231
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:23,019
...because you haven't changed.
Why?

232
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,163
Because you don't want to.

233
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,925
You'd rather just sit back on
the couch, have another light beer...

234
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,568
...and catch up on some
of those <i>Happy Days</i> reruns.

235
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,865
That's it, isn't it?
Now, as you know...

236
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,704
...other programs have as many
as seven or even 12 steps.

237
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:46,010
But with mine, you can change
your life in just one step.

238
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:50,518
Won't you take that step?
Call the number on your screen.

239
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:55,126
Do it now.
God bless you, and good night.

240
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:08,171
- You are so inspirational, doctor.
- It was just like on the TV.

241
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,832
Mr. And Mrs. Presser, take Sharon
and wait for me over in the garden.

242
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,671
- Yes, sir.
- I have a question.

243
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,075
Earl, go work on your step.

244
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,752
Ms. Kelsky, it's been too long.

245
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,287
And I believe Mr. Roth and I
have never had the pleasure.

246
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,518
So nice of you to drop by. I hope
Mr. Lawrence took good care of you.

247
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,289
And if it isn't young James.
I'm Dr. Wexler.

248
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,957
- Your father and I are good friends.
- They're business associates.

249
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,100
So, James, what did you think
of the show?

250
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,399
- I really liked it.
- I knew you would.

251
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,701
How are you getting along
with your father?

252
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,003
Peas in a pod, thanks for asking.

253
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,876
Sometimes he makes me mad.

254
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,881
If you're interested in taking
that step, you should...

255
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,609
He's not.

256
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,789
- Thank you.
- Cute.

257
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,264
Please.

258
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,048
How are you feeling
these days, Mr. Roth?

259
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,549
What exactly are you
a doctor of, Mr. Wexler?

260
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,483
Let's talk about money.

261
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:36,491
So much sent in, so much cash.
Also untraceable with a little ingenuity.

262
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,686
I did not mean in general.

263
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:42,230
You must be referring to your people
running all over town...

264
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,924
...looking for poor Mr. Koo.

265
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:48,198
With all that concern I can only
assume he suffered some misfortune?

266
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,565
- Yes, but whose?
- Koo was a small man.

267
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,177
He had not yet taken the step.

268
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:58,009
There are a great many Koos
in the world. What happened to this one?

269
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,509
Nick shot him.

270
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,688
Thank you, James.

271
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,985
It's refreshing to hear
a straight answer now and then.

272
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,489
So the money I
placed in Mr. Koo's trust...

273
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,226
...remains at large
in the hard cruel world...

274
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,530
...and you wish me
to reunite it with you...

275
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,832
...its devoted friends.

276
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,606
- Interesting.
- No one ever saw you give it to him.

277
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,210
Koo never said
you gave him the money.

278
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,747
And now he never will.

279
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,485
Your boss and I have been
conducting business...

280
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,349
...in a mutually satisfactory manner
for three years.

281
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:42,019
That's plenty of time to get used
to the idea of more.

282
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,497
Twenty percent looks small next
to 100 percent.

283
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,095
I bet you like the look
of this whole setup.

284
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,501
Relax, Mr. Lawrence.
Ms. Kelsky here is just worried...

285
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,802
...that someone of means was pulling
her bagman's strings.

286
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,208
We should be flattered that she thinks
of me in this manner.

287
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,215
Personally, I find it impressive
how apt she is in her work.

288
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,513
She should do well in the world
without even reading my book.

289
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,287
Focus, doc.

290
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,858
Your estimate of my position
is savvy...

291
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,260
...but there is no way I could just
step in and run your organization.

292
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:25,733
Why should I?
I do very well laundering the cash.

293
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,866
I'm sure.

294
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,109
Claire, should you ever find
your situation changing...

295
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,311
...I only hope you'll think of me.

296
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:48,715
"James." I like the sound of that.
That guy's cool.

297
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,088
- When are we gonna get this girl?
- What?

298
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,161
My dad sent Duncan for the money,
us to get the girl.

299
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,529
Your dad sent you to learn something.

300
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,167
I'll tell him you shoved
the gun in the doctor's face.

301
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,467
- This is where I get off.
- No way, Nick.

302
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,133
I'm sure the boy will be
fine with one less instructor.

303
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,610
I'm gonna finish tracking down
the money.

304
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,442
Fuck. Fuck!

305
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:38,699
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Koo, my name is Nicholas Roth.

306
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,108
I work with Joseph
at Dunster, Rhodes and Collier.

307
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,975
If it's not an imposition,
I'd like to speak with you for a moment.

308
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,320
May I?

309
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:02,723
Good Lord, look what
they've done to your home.

310
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,132
Mrs. Koo, I am so sorry.

311
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,933
- Did you just get back?
- Yes. Do you know where Joseph is?

312
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,407
No, I do not. No, not specifically.

313
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,207
But he asked me to look in on you
to make sure everything was all right.

314
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:21,375
- He's very worried about you.
- When did you speak with him?

315
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,215
Could I get a glass of water from you?

316
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,916
I have some medication I must be taking.

317
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,186
- Of course.
- Thank you very much.

318
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:36,959
Mrs. Koo, I'm glad to meet you in person.
Joseph spoke of you so often.

319
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,263
Were you visiting your sister
this weekend?

320
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,565
Joseph didn't want me near family.

321
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,198
He didn't even want to know where I was.

322
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,410
Is he all right?

323
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,250
He's fine.

324
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,322
He's just in a little bit of trouble.

325
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,454
He said everything would be
all right when I got back.

326
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:07,587
He said we'd go to Aruba, then...

327
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,625
Mrs. Koo, Mrs. Koo.

328
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:16,240
Look, I want to be able
to help him more...

329
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,103
...but the only way I can do that...

330
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:24,408
...is for you to give me what he entrusted
you with before he had to go away.

331
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,845
He asked me to ask for it.

332
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,477
He didn't tell me someone would come.

333
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,152
Well...

334
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,852
...not everything went as planned.

335
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,332
Thank you.

336
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,198
Will Joseph be all right?

337
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,002
I will take care of everything.

338
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,746
Here's some money
to help you restore your home.

339
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,213
You'll want it nice for Joseph, right?

340
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,342
Okay.

341
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,709
- Why is she so scared?
- Get her shit together.

342
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,504
Kitty!

343
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,011
It's time to go.

344
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,974
No! No, just leave me, please!

345
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,381
- Leave me here!
- Shit.

346
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,081
No! Claire, no,
please just leave me here!

347
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,625
Leave me here!
Just leave me here to die, please!

348
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,959
Claire, leave me, please!
Claire, please, just leave me.

349
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,533
Claire! Please, get away
from me! Get away!

350
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,261
Hey!

351
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,909
Next time, cut the other way,
along the vein.

352
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:18,659
Jimmy, I need you to get me
some supplies from the pharmacy.

353
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,459
No.

354
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,121
What?

355
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,397
I don't do errands. You do them.

356
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,535
Fine.

357
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,069
You watch her.

358
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,380
Hey, Kitty.

359
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:51,259
Hey, Kitty! You there, huh?

360
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,421
Hi, Kitty.

361
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:44,612
Oh, my God. I'm fucked.

362
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,512
I'm fucked.

363
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,516
I'm fucked!

364
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,382
Oh, my God!

365
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,385
I'm fucked!

366
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:58,257
Stupid bitch! You stupid, fucking bitch!

367
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,464
Okay, here you go.

368
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,562
You were gonna do it a second ago.

369
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,829
- <i>It's Nicholas.</i>
- Jimmy's dead.

370
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,070
- Kitty shot him.
- <i>Jesus.</i>

371
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,475
- I was gonna shoot her, but...
- Claire, listen to me. Listen.

372
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,242
<i>You have to be careful.</i>
<i>You've got to look out for yourself.</i>

373
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,112
I know.

374
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,881
But The Boss and I have a lot of years
together. We'll work this out.

375
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,684
<i>That's not enough, Claire.</i>
<i>His son is dead.</i>

376
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,158
No one is that good a friend.
No one.

377
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,196
You do not go in there
without me, okay?

378
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,028
<i>It'll be okay. I just need</i>
<i>to see him face to face.</i>

379
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,069
Let me get the money.
It'll make a difference if we have it.

380
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,075
Look, I'll clean things up here
and call you in a while, okay?

381
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,836
- Call me before you go.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

382
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,611
My God.

383
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,879
Are you gonna kill me now?

384
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,419
Later.

385
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,190
Where are we going?

386
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,395
Claire, where are we going?

387
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,237
I'm not going back with you, Claire.

388
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,772
- Claire, please, don't take me back there.
- Come on.

389
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,467
I'm not gonna go!
You can't make me go!

390
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:57,341
Claire, I'm not gonna go!
I'm not going!

391
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,915
You can't make me go, Claire.

392
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,609
I'm not gonna go!
You can't make me go!

393
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,813
No, no, no, no, no!

394
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,166
Don't kill me, please! She's crazy!

395
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:20,737
This lady's nuts!
Somebody help me! Help!

396
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,635
- Please, hold still.
- Stop it, you're hurting me.

397
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,107
- It's gonna hurt a little.
- I think you should pump her stomach.

398
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,678
Don't pump my stomach.
I didn't take anything.

399
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,714
- I think she'll be okay.
- I said pump her stomach.

400
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,613
- No.
- You got it, Claire.

401
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,447
No, no, no.

402
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:38,646
Stop it, no!

403
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,925
What salon do you go to?

404
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,521
Full service salon, where do you go?

405
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,934
- Get me Greta.
- Do you have an appointment?

406
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,769
Don't even think about it.

407
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,407
Kitty, darling, what happened?

408
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,951
Where did your beauty go? My God.
We must make this better.

409
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,883
Stephanie, I want white wine,
massage, steam. Be quick.

410
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,818
Send someone for clothes...

411
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,083
...and don't leave her alone.
You see to it.

412
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,920
Naturally. We will work magic.

413
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,892
Madam, if I may suggest,
perhaps you would care...

414
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,055
...for some of our services
while you wait.

415
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:26,294
- Believe me, I could suggest several...
- Get the hell away from me.

416
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,944
I'm gonna get her cleaned up here...

417
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,572
<i>... and I'll call you in a little while, okay?</i>

418
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,124
100.

419
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,564
200.

420
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,597
300.

421
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,283
Get me Duncan.

422
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,582
Duncan, it's Nicholas.

423
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,057
No, no. Things are fine.

424
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,322
I'm just sitting here
counting all this money.

425
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:05,265
You know how I feel about details.
And guess who has Kitty?

426
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,540
I know The Boss will be so relieved
to know that everything is fine.

427
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,199
He was awfully upset
about that fiasco yesterday...

428
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,403
...and I know you did everything
you could to make us look bad.

429
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,413
I just wanted to tell you
that it's a great day to be me...

430
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,949
...mostly because I'm not you.

431
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,156
What's wrong?

432
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:31,420
Nick says he has the money. Yeah,
Claire has Kitty.

433
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,460
He was calling to gloat.

434
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,859
- Does he know?
- No.

435
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,195
It's just like that son of a bitch
to play around like this.

436
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,769
I just wish he'd hurry up and die.

437
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,671
We're safe, though. We are.

438
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,208
If he knew, he would've said something.
He has no reason not to.

439
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,608
Unless he likes watching you sweat.

440
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,714
We're fine. Okay?

441
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,217
Duncan...

442
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,884
...inside.

443
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,412
My...

444
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,765
My son's dead.

445
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:49,766
Oh, God.

446
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,702
Kitty killed my boy.

447
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,969
Why are you so mean to me?

448
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,369
You're joking, right?

449
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,670
No, no. I'd really like to know.

450
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,312
You know what happens
if The Boss gets killed?

451
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,848
Everything's falling apart
and I gotta be here.

452
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,782
- I didn't ask...
- I had to tell him his son was dead!

453
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:40,082
You killed him on my watch!

454
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:50,560
I'm just asking you, please,
please don't take me back.

455
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,031
I'm gonna do my job.

456
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,262
You got yourself into this situation.

457
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,897
What do you know about my situation?
You have no idea.

458
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,408
You're right. I don't.

459
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,740
I'd never be a whore.

460
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,608
If you were unhappy,
you would have left by now.

461
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,149
I leave there all the time.

462
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,549
Yeah, I mean, "leave" leave.

463
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,451
Not check into some hotel
and order nose service.

464
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,421
It's the principle.

465
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,584
You're a coward.

466
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,992
What about you? Why do you stay?

467
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,532
You make it sound like
I might not want to.

468
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,926
Nick's gonna die, isn't he?

469
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,266
You think you're free, but you're not.

470
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,037
You're a valet.

471
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:39,114
"Claire, get Koo.
Claire, why don't you go pick up Kitty."

472
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:43,310
I could be a bag of goddamn laundry
and you wouldn't know the difference.

473
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,853
At least they don't own my soul.

474
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,618
- We all chose to be where we are.
- I didn't.

475
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,028
I was traded in a drug debt
when I was 15.

476
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:56,291
Bad childhood! I don't give a fuck!

477
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:02,635
When I go back to The Boss,
it's gonna be to save my ass, not yours.

478
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,798
He's always been fair. We're friends.

479
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:10,807
I will not lie to him and I will not
welch on my responsibilities.

480
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,517
It's Claire. Give me The Boss.

481
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,186
He's not up for calls now.
What can I do?

482
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,955
You can scurry over and ask him
if he wants me to bring Kitty in.

483
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,065
I don't think Kitty should be
near the house.

484
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,292
Did I ask you what you thought?

485
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:32,730
Why am I talking to you?

486
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,497
Because you screwed up
so badly that his son is dead.

487
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,005
Fuck you!
I only talk to The Boss.

488
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,232
No.

489
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,871
Who was that?

490
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,483
Yeah, we're still in it.

491
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,449
Why would Kitty kill your son?

492
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,385
Why hasn't the money shown up?

493
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,333
You're getting at Claire.

494
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:07,936
Nick killed Koo.

495
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:12,940
He did it when you
were pressuring Koo to name names.

496
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,570
Just one bullet proves
their loyalty to you...

497
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,040
...and wipes out the trail to the money.

498
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,520
They were the ones
who found him on the street.

499
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,938
They were the ones who were supposed
to search him on the way in...

500
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,034
...and Nick, he couldn't
have been more ready.

501
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,437
Nick's fast.

502
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,742
We couldn't find the money
because it wasn't there to be found.

503
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:57,510
Now she's taken Jimmy out of the picture
and she's using Kitty to get to you.

504
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,322
Unless, of course, you turned Koo.

505
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,259
Much more likely.

506
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,872
You got it wrong.

507
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,669
Maybe.

508
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:29,476
I had a little talk with Mrs. Koo.
Nick has the money.

509
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,814
He called in yet?

510
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,932
640,500.

511
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,666
640,600.

512
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:55,073
640,700.

513
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:18,363
- Claire.
- <i>It's me.</i>

514
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,568
We've been together a long time, Claire.

515
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,037
Time matters.

516
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,174
Do you think you owe me?

517
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,006
I owe you everything.

518
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,778
What about the future, Claire?

519
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,387
What do you want?

520
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,656
I want things not to change.

521
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:46,195
I want nothing.

522
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,060
You want nothing?

523
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,896
You're too good to me.

524
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,064
I don't understand.

525
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:03,071
I want you to come in.
We'll figure out this thing together.

526
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,846
You want me to bring Kitty?

527
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,247
<i>No, leave her, leave her.</i>

528
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,013
<i>We'll just sit down, you and me.</i>

529
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,755
It's gonna be okay?

530
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,993
Yeah, yeah, sure. It'll be fine.

531
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,394
I get to stay here?

532
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,933
Yep.

533
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,803
What makes you think
I'm not just gonna run away?

534
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:49,785
<i>Now Nick is holed up somewhere.</i>

535
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,056
Probably one of those hotels of his.
I need you to go kill him.

536
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,962
Just us?

537
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,661
You don't have to bring him in.
You don't have to make it pretty.

538
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:03,465
You don't have to like it. All right?
Just do it.

539
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,674
- What are you gonna be doing?
- I have to wait for Claire.

540
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,135
Now get the job done. Get the money.

541
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,470
Nick's got the money?

542
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,974
You, don't grow a brain.
Okay?

543
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,314
Just go together. Do not split up.
Do not wait to talk to him.

544
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:22,117
Find him. Shoot him.
Stash the money. Okay?

545
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,764
Don't move a muscle. You know
how I am when I'm nervous.

546
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,415
Have some goddamn respect
until things are decided.

547
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,654
I don't understand.

548
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,798
Really?

549
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,709
Did you really think that I'd believe
that Kitty killed Jimmy?

550
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:20,144
I don't know what Duncan's been
telling you, but you got it all wrong.

551
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:26,022
It's me. Claire.

552
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,022
Duncan must have given Koo the...

553
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,103
Feed the tree.

554
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:19,403
- What you doing? Digging a hole?
- Yeah, kid, we're digging a hole.

555
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,868
You gonna plant something?

556
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,572
Yeah. That's just it, kid,
we're gonna plant something.

557
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,775
- Can I help?
- Sure, kid.

558
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:31,682
No, better not. She likes digging.

559
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:36,121
- Okay. Bye.
- All right. See you.

560
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,871
Well, Claire. It was fun.

561
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,873
- But I'm not gonna miss you.
- Likewise.

562
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,375
Don't move.

563
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,647
Turn around.

564
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:59,535
1,224,400.

565
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,256
<i>Did we get him?</i>

566
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,692
<i>I don't know.</i>

567
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,732
Damn!

568
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:39,541
1,224,500.

569
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:44,381
1,224,600.

570
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,721
1,224,700.

571
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,108
1,224,000...

572
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:19,952
Shit.

573
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:29,829
<i>Benny.</i>

574
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,663
It's Nicholas. Is there anything
I should know about?

575
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,135
<i>The Boss wants you to come in.</i>

576
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,867
Would you like to speak with Boulez
and Simms? They're right here.

577
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,110
- <i>Sure.</i>
- I'm sorry.

578
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,771
They've just become unavailable.

579
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,590
- Hi.
- Hi.

580
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,164
Where are the two men?

581
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,030
I killed them.
Wanna help me bury them?

582
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,933
Okay.

583
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,449
Rest easy, little man.

584
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:04,918
Peaceful.

585
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:10,799
You can, you know, because
those bastards are gonna die.

586
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:16,170
And when they do,
I know you're gonna be there.

587
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,215
Time to go to work.

588
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:02,514
- Jesus, Nick, you look awful.
- Let me have a glass of water, Mike.

589
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:06,847
Jesus, Nicholas, water?

590
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:10,488
Do you need me to take you
to the hospital there?

591
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,161
Jesus, Nick, that must be five grand.

592
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,528
Nobody pours them like you do, Mike.

593
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,969
Jesus, Nick. Trouble.

594
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:30,071
- Thanks, Mike.
- Sure, Nick.

595
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,125
Sucker.

596
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,607
Very cute.

597
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,219
Grand-fucking-Central.

598
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,663
Yeah, Stykes. Can I get The Boss?

599
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,245
All right. Well, tell him I called
from Claire's.

600
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:19,540
Yeah, Kitty's here. She's dead.

601
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:24,185
Yeah, nothing else going on, though.
Look, I'm gonna call it a day.

602
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,784
Never can tell how
a day's gonna go, huh?

603
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,991
You could just go. You could leave
now and I wouldn't tell anybody.

604
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,903
- I promise.
- Just go?

605
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:54,510
I could never stand you. Never.

606
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:58,017
Sitting in that room every day,
looking at you.

607
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,552
Please.

608
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:03,214
Now it's please? Please what?

609
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,627
Please? You gonna please me?

610
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,533
Shit!

611
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:17,002
I got such a big itch to do something
to you right now.

612
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,065
That's how dumb guys get killed...

613
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:25,346
...with their pants down around their
ankles. Not me, baby.

614
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,881
You're looking at a smart guy.

615
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,087
Jesus!

616
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,566
- Claire here?
- She went to go see The Boss.

617
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,102
Damn.

618
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,714
Nick?

619
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,586
Nick. Nick.

620
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,415
Nick.

621
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,058
Hey.

622
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,140
You okay?

623
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:17,358
Once, when I was little,
I had a goldfish that died.

624
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,622
Was it called Nicholas?

625
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,029
No, Goldie.

626
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,466
Amazing.

627
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:38,139
When you traveled,
what was your favorite place?

628
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:40,482
Thailand.

629
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,592
However, I always have been
very partial to Montana.

630
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,628
I love the red ones.

631
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,501
There's nothing quite like
the red ones.

632
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,139
What's wrong with you, Nick?

633
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:16,014
I am tormented by my many sins.

634
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:22,549
Cancer.

635
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:43,612
<i>So when I say, "What are you</i>
<i>waiting for?" you identify.</i>

636
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,770
<i>You say, "What am I waiting for?"</i>

637
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:09,765
Claire.

638
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,100
I'm looking at your grave.

639
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,104
Yeah, well, I'm looking at your mess.

640
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,213
I told you not to go in there without me.

641
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,372
<i>Duncan confused him,</i>
<i>it's not his fault.</i>

642
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:21,948
No, it is his fault.

643
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:26,919
It doesn't matter. Wexler's involved.
I can still turn things around.

644
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,149
No, Claire. You've got
to look out for yourself.

645
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,760
I am looking out for myself.

646
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,600
Nick, you all right?

647
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,464
I am not well, Claire.

648
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,001
I want you to rest. I mean it.

649
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:53,404
- What are you going to do?
- <i>Visit Wexler.</i>

650
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:58,118
Okay. Claire, there's some things
I have to do.

651
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,051
- <i>But I'll be there if you need me.</i>
- I know.

652
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,666
He never cleans up after himself.

653
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,442
You got kind of dirty.

654
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,392
I'm surprised you're still here.

655
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,822
So how did it go with The Boss?

656
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,102
Claire, he's not gonna fit.

657
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:56,106
Oh, God. You're not...?
Oh, God.

658
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:18,591
I need an immediate pickup.

659
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,893
- It's freezing.
- I don't need you around anymore...

660
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:23,732
...so why don't you just take off?

661
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,773
What was all that crap
about taking me back?

662
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:30,109
I got bigger problems
than lugging you around.

663
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:33,271
Look, Claire, I really think
we should stick together.

664
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:37,545
We're in the same boat. We're in
trouble with The Boss. We could hide...

665
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,689
...get a room at the Royal,
order room service. It'd be fun.

666
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:44,587
- I know people there.
- Yeah, they'd never look there.

667
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,763
I don't have any place to go.

668
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:11,118
Kitty can wait here.

669
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,526
- Stay awake. We're not safe.
- No problem.

670
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,234
Claire.

671
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:33,840
I knew you'd come.

672
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:37,540
You and I have a rare
business opportunity.

673
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:42,381
- Benny's with me.
- Jesus.

674
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:56,423
- Who else?
- Well, Duncan, of course.

675
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:03,172
It's ironic that your boss and I made
the same mistake trusting Duncan.

676
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:06,035
It's clear that you would
have been the better choice.

677
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:09,267
There's a lesson in it.
I figured you would never sell out.

678
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:13,711
I had no choice but Duncan. But
your boss had you and Duncan...

679
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:16,909
...and he chose poorly,
betraying years of trust.

680
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:22,153
- Everyone makes mistakes.
- True, but consider the present.

681
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:26,658
He wants to kill you.
I want to be your friend.

682
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:31,266
To control the organization, we need
somebody who knows the connections.

683
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:36,261
If it were me, we'd have to kill you,
Nick and whoever was left.

684
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:41,273
If it were you, we could start pulling
things back together right now.

685
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,114
What about the money?

686
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:51,582
Taking the money was merely a means
to get to The Boss. It's nothing. Keep it.

687
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,651
You stay out of my way. You let me
run my own show, we got a deal.

688
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,751
You and Mr. Lawrence
can work out the hit.

689
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,192
No.

690
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:07,397
- I make the hit.
- We'll see, won't we?

691
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,038
What'll you have, hon?

692
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,544
Ice cream.

693
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:28,487
Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry,
praline, mint chip, chocolate chip...

694
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:32,058
...Swiss orange chip, peanut butter,
boysenberry, fudge brownie...

695
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,855
...and a whole mess of sherbets.

696
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,493
We'll have...

697
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,571
...vanilla.

698
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:53,146
- Anything else?
- Fresh apple pie.

699
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,751
- We're out.
- Do you bake?

700
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,687
I have been at work for 10 hours.

701
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,989
Then I would like to pay you...

702
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,589
...$ 1000 per hour...

703
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:12,527
...to bake me a fresh apple pie.

704
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,862
I don't know if my pie is that good.

705
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:21,602
- Where you from?
- Potato Creek, Indiana.

706
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,907
I trust you.

707
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:34,152
My wife and I came all the way
from Texas to meet Dr. Wexler.

708
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:38,020
- Have you taken The Step yet?
- No.

709
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:42,823
You should all be excited to meet
our new guests, Claire and Kitty.

710
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:46,495
Claire is coming to work for me.
Aren't you, Claire?

711
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:51,231
And I can't help but feel Kitty
has a future with me as well.

712
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,007
Claire is about to take The Step.

713
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:59,371
- That is wonderful. Congratulations.
- Time to go, folks.

714
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:02,711
The doctor needs some time
with our guests.

715
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,316
- Come on, Henry.
- Good night.

716
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,750
Have a wonderful evening, everybody.
Earl?

717
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,591
Earl, would you like to join
our guests for dinner?

718
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,558
Claire.

719
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:19,092
- What do you think of our guests?
- Thrill a minute.

720
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:22,362
Earl, what do you think
of our friend Claire?

721
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:29,635
- I would give anything to be you.
- You are the sunshine on my flower.

722
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:34,772
It is so nice to see someone
who knows what they want.

723
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:39,449
Do you ever worry about things,
Earl?

724
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:41,253
Yeah, sometimes.

725
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:45,621
I do too. I worry about Claire.

726
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:50,527
I worry that I won't be able
to rely on her.

727
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,201
I worry that she's trying
to play me for a sucker.

728
01:12:56,071 --> 01:13:02,476
And I want it to be absolutely clear
to her what the stakes are.

729
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,633
Good pick, Benny.

730
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,512
Nothing, dear.

731
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,351
I want for nothing.

732
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:10,339
- <i>Paul.</i>
- Claire. Give me The Boss.

733
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,445
<i>He's not available, Claire.</i>

734
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:18,143
Paul, it's important. Please?

735
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,118
<i>We're gonna find you, Claire.</i>

736
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:23,756
Damn it.

737
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:29,487
- I can't believe you.
- What?

738
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,065
I can't believe you're so alone.

739
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:39,839
They had you digging your own grave
and now you're begging to go back?

740
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:42,738
- It was Duncan and Wexler.
- You're pathetic.

741
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,141
You're a stupid whore.
You don't know shit.

742
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,746
I may have been a whore, but you're
the one crawling back to get fucked.

743
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,316
Shut up!

744
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,716
I gave Koo the gun.

745
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,758
What?

746
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:00,952
It was easy. Nobody ever
pays any attention to me.

747
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:02,756
Jesus.

748
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,395
- Why?
- I knew I had to get out of there.

749
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:13,567
I didn't know what else to do.
I know what I'm gonna do now, though.

750
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,642
Is that right?

751
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:19,670
You were right when you said
that I have to "leave" leave.

752
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:24,046
So I'm gonna go someplace
really far away. Montana, maybe.

753
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:25,652
Montana?

754
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:29,151
You could come with.

755
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:32,654
No, I can't.

756
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,860
I wish Nick were here.

757
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,361
What are you gonna do?

758
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:49,140
Wexler could turn us in to The Boss
and still look loyal.

759
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:52,712
I can't touch him
until I straighten things out.

760
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:36,989
Claire, I feel
we're not communicating.

761
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:41,423
I can't make a move against
The Boss until I contact Nick.

762
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:44,625
If he opposes us,
we could be in trouble.

763
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:50,363
I'm giving you protection, Claire.
I don't see you giving me anything.

764
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,200
We have an agreement.

765
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,809
Nick wouldn't cross you.

766
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:58,845
Besides, he won't be around
much longer.

767
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:06,513
I will take Kitty
as the price of continued protection.

768
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:11,216
You may contact Nick,
and perhaps we can still proceed.

769
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:13,650
Kitty?

770
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:18,659
Claire, certainly you don't
owe her to The Boss.

771
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:31,070
No. Kitty's not on the table.

772
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:34,941
So far you haven't put much
of anything on the table.

773
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:38,245
I suggest you reconsider
your bargaining position here.

774
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,084
I'll do that.

775
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,587
We're leaving.

776
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:49,858
Move it.

777
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,492
That's gotta hurt.

778
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,298
Better her than me.

779
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:08,539
Relax, beautiful.
You get the good part of the deal.

780
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,617
You get to stay with Dr. Wexler.

781
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:15,455
- No, no, no.
- Stop crying.

782
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:22,286
Go away. Please, just go away!
Somebody help!

783
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:25,262
Help! Please, help!

784
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:33,932
Oh, God. Jesus.

785
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,012
- Claire.
- <i>Claire?</i>

786
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:50,056
Nick. Nick, you okay?

787
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:55,386
<i>I've been testing the waters</i>
<i>of my soul.</i>

788
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,225
Are you okay?

789
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,300
- <i>We've got to meet.</i>
- Nick?

790
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:08,239
- <i>I'm at the Hotel Belle Age.</i>
- Okay, I'm there.

791
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,711
- <i>Could you refill my prescription?</i>
- Sure.

792
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,983
- Nick?
- Yeah.

793
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,488
Thanks for killing those two.

794
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,929
- What?
- Nothing.

795
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:45,108
After we see Nick, I'm gonna leave.

796
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:48,214
You should too.

797
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,294
Come.

798
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:49,638
You look like hell, Nick.

799
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,903
I could say the same about you.

800
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,492
What happened to your leg?

801
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,098
I shot myself.

802
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:21,805
What's gonna happen to you
when I'm gone?

803
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:25,541
I don't know.

804
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,648
I'm gonna go get a soda.

805
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,640
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

806
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:38,252
It's okay. It's okay.

807
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:41,383
It's okay.

808
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:46,061
- Help, please! Somebody help me!
- Shut up! You're going to The Boss!

809
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:48,256
- Help, please! Somebody help me!
- Shut up! You're going to The Boss!

810
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,721
Be very quiet.

811
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:48,382
You're gonna die, you son of a bitch!

812
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:56,185
Ouch! Goddamn it, Nick.
Son of a fucking bitch.

813
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,759
Oh, Nick. Nick, what do you...?

814
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:22,000
Where are you...?
Where are you hurt?

815
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:24,842
- Hey, Claire.
- Yeah?

816
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:32,846
- You didn't shoot yourself again, did you?
- No. Jesus, no.

817
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,353
It's okay.

818
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:40,257
It was perfect.

819
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:55,206
- This is for you.
- No!

820
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,310
- Take it.
- No.

821
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:59,173
It's okay.

822
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,946
Look at me.

823
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:06,752
Now you can go.

824
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:09,913
- No. I'm with you.
- No.

825
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:14,323
- Not anymore.
- No.

826
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:16,395
It's time.

827
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:29,668
You're going to do something different.
You can make it whatever you want.

828
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,812
So make it good.

829
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:38,752
So don't be afraid.

830
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,820
You'll be fine.

831
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:50,931
Tell me you love me.

832
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,727
I love you.

833
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:55,994
I love you too.

834
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:00,469
Now go.

835
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:26,833
<i>I love bananas</i>

836
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:34,306
<i>Because they have no bones</i>

837
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:39,241
<i>I hate peaches</i>

838
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:42,850
<i>Because they...</i>

839
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:44,780
<i>... have no...</i>

840
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:18,379
- Wait! No! No!
- Where's my money?

841
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:30,089
I gave Koo the gun.

842
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:35,561
Claire didn't kill Jimmy. I did.

843
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:39,730
I took his own gun, I put it under his
chin and I blew his pathetic head off.

844
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:41,704
Oh, God.

845
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:44,140
You cunt!

846
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:04,592
It's hard to see clearly when everything
you know is filtered through others.

847
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:09,863
Your instincts, the things you know
are true, they get twisted.

848
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:11,527
Damn you.

849
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,879
You could have trusted your instincts.

850
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:22,815
What are you gonna do, Claire?

851
