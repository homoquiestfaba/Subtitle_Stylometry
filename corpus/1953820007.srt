1
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:13,052
I know what you are thinking.

2
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,019
This looks bad.

3
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,005
but I assure you,

4
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:19,065
I have everything under control.

5
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,078
Okay, maybe not.

6
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:24,074
Ugh, such a dirty shoe.

7
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:26,049
First things first.

8
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:28,015
I am not your average teenager.

9
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:30,035
I never get to grow up with a family with bikes and candy.

10
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:33,011
My family was an international network of killers.

11
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:35,007
I bike with a Falcon Recon 23X,

12
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:37,042
and the closest thing I ever got to candy was...

13
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:38,051
Well, I did get a lolipop once...

14
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,023
But that is not the point!

15
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:43,015
as long as remember, I've been trained to become an A.S.S.,

16
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:45,010
an Agent of Secret Stuff.

17
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,044
For 17 years I've been trained along side with one of the coolest, boldest, most heartless killer of all the A.S.S.es,

18
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:51,052
Tracy.

19
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:53,050
- It's a man's name...!

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,019
3 months ago, on the final day of my training,

21
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:57,084
Tracy brought me in front of a panel,

22
00:00:57,084 --> 00:00:59,034
the highest ranked A.S.S.es.

23
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:02,034
I am talking top quality A.S.S.

24
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:08,010
- Aiden, for the past 17 years you have been like a son to me.

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,027
We've been on missions around the world,

26
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:17,081
prevented various global disasters and saved countless lives.

27
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:22,026
And now, it is time to become an official Agent of Secret Stuff.

28
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:29,003
But, before I give you your Honorary Operative License Entitlement,

29
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,074
your H.O.L.E.,

30
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:36,096
you have one more assignment you must complete.

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:41,006
- But... Sir! With all due respect, I devoted my life to training.

32
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:43,023
- You will follow orders!

33
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:47,012
- But... But why! I already did all the hard stuff.

34
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:50,013
- We are A.S.S.es!

35
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:53,048
We do not complain when things get too hard.

36
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:57,021
We push on through, and we take it.

37
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,048
- But you said...

38
00:01:58,048 --> 00:02:00,046
- Enough!

39
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:05,002
Please, tell Aiden his assignment.

40
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:13,007
- Aiden, we need you for a special assignment that only you can execute!

41
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:19,014
The Society Involving Not-so-good Stuff, a.k.a. the S.I.N.S.,

42
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:23,034
they have been our mortal enemies for decades.

43
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:27,099
And now, they have found a new target,

44
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:32,057
Taylor Rentrol, a high school senior.

45
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:36,006
We need an agent on the inside.

46
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:40,077
We believe that the S.I.N.S. have already infiltrated the school with assassins of their own!

47
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:48,039
Your mission is to pose as a high school student and protect Taylor from impending threats!

48
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,082
- But... why are they after Taylor?

49
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:53,096
- That will be revealed in a later time,

50
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:56,063
in like, 30 minutes?

51
00:02:56,063 --> 00:03:00,021
We have already made preparations for your enrollment,

52
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:04,029
a spot has been made available in all of Taylor's classes.

53
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:07,062
She must not know that she is in danger!

54
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,079
This is a new world for you!

55
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:17,029
High school students are the most dangerous and misunderstood citizens that you will ever come across!

56
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:21,058
You must operate cautiously.

57
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:25,011
- I will not fail.

58
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:27,010
- Cool, peace out.

59
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:29,063
- Oh yea, come here.

60
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:34,018
Guys, I need your attention just for one second.

61
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:35,099
Hey!

62
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,042
Shut up. We have a new student.

63
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:43,067
His name is um... Jose McDonald.

64
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:46,026
Yea, obviously.

65
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,092
Why don't you say Hi, Jose.

66
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:51,059
Right on man, you're gonna fit in perfectly.

67
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:54,040
Why don't you take a seat in front of Bieber there.

68
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,057
You guys open your book to Chapter 14.

69
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:21,024
- Hey, I'm Taylor, Can I help you with something?

70
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:27,014
- Hola, I'm "Joezy".

71
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:29,045
- Isn't it pronounced as "Jose"?

72
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:31,031
- Is that what you want it to be?

73
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:33,034
So it's gonna be like our code word for "danger"?

74
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,080
- What are you talking about?...

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,029
- You know, I'll be "Jose", you'll be "Jose-B".

76
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,093
- Are you okay?

77
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:41,074
- Taylor, zip it up and shut your face hole.

78
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:44,069
These kids are trying to learn.

79
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,012
- Thanks a lot.

80
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,075
- You're welcome.

81
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,008
- Hey Taylor, can I borrow your pencil sharpener?

82
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:58,091
- Yea sure, Melvin.

83
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:04,043
Suspect will acquire a pencil sharpening tool to convert the writer's thing into a weapon

84
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:07,026
by inserting the yellow thing into the green thing, the dull thing will turn into a sharp thing.

85
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:10,042
He will then proceed to jump behind his target while she is pre-occupied,

86
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:14,036
and apply a fatal impend weapon into her jugular artery!

87
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:17,055
- There you go.

88
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:19,055
- Give the sharpener back.

89
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:21,038
- What's your problem?

90
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,072
- What do you take me for, a fresh--man?

91
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:25,085
Give the sharpener back.

92
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:28,018
- Jose, what are you doing?

93
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:30,072
- Fine, Jeez.

94
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,045
- What was that all about Jose?

95
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:40,013
- Don't worry, I got you. "Jose-B".

96
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,073
- Alright, class, that's it.

97
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:04,065
Remember, Chapter 15! Read it... or not, it's your future.

98
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:08,023
Oh by the way, pop quiz next week! You guys know the drill.

99
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:13,028
Oh, Taylor, I'll need to speak with you after class, if you have a moment.

100
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,076
Good work today, guys. I was kidding.

101
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,080
Remember these days, kids. You will miss them.

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,082
See you tomorrow!

103
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:27,051
Hey, Taylor, I want to talk to you about the... the homecoming dance.

104
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:30,076
I know it is kinda a thing that you are planning with the student council.

105
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:34,065
But we do have a lot of volunteering that is coming up, you know,

106
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,024
make sure you still have time to do that.

107
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:37,095
- No, definitely, it should be fine.

108
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:39,073
We are almost done planning.

109
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:44,017
- Okay alright, I trust you. You're not like the other bastards in this class.

110
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:45,036
You're the good one.

111
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,090
- Thanks, I appreciate it. Is that it?

112
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,028
- Alright I'll see you later.           - Bye.

113
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:59,065
- Don't you ever do that again.

114
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:01,053
- Excuse me?

115
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,034
- I said, don't you ever do that again.

116
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:05,043
Keeping Taylor in the room alone is not safe.

117
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:08,026
- Oh yea, I forgot, you are right.

118
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:12,067
I didn't know what I was thinking otherwise I'll... Who the hell are you?

119
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,016
- Well, I am the new kid remember?

120
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,064
You just introduced me.

121
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:18,064
- Get the hell out of my class!

122
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:21,043
- I am glad that we had this talk.

123
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,077
- Hey there, son.

124
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:42,018
I am glad that I found you.

125
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,099
I hope you are enjoying your first day of school so far.

126
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,039
I just wanted to give you your new locker assignment.

127
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,048
Actually, you are quite lucky, a new one just opened up the other day.

128
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:02,058
- Oh, hey!

129
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:05,047
Wow, your locker is next to mine.

130
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:07,036
I wonder where Billy went.

131
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:10,069
- Yea, strange huh, Ha ha ha ha...

132
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,056
- Well if we gonna see each other this much,

133
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,077
why don't we just start over.

134
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:20,087
Hi, Jose, I'm Taylor, nice to meet you.

135
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:24,087
- Nice to meet you too.

136
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,004
- It's called a handshake, Jose.

137
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:30,080
You're so silly, it's like you've never made a friend before.

138
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,006
- "You will follow orders!" - "Ahhh..."

139
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,010
- Hey Taylor!

140
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,034
- Oh hey, what's up, how are you?

141
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,081
- I'm good. Did you finish that paper in English?

142
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:42,014
- No, not yet, it is due soon? In two days...

143
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:49,033
Suspect from across the hall is examining the target, his eyes indicate he is aiming for the most exposed and vital area, her chest.

144
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:57,051
Only 3 steps away from pumping her with barrages of bullet punches straight to her rib cages that will no doubt stop her heart forever for life!

145
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:01,052
- What are you looking at?!

146
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:02,053
- Bye Jose!

147
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,041
- Bye!

148
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,099
- I said, what were you looking at?

149
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:12,021
- Chill out, Man, I'm just checking out Taylor's rack, she is looking especially hot today.

150
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,022
- Her rack?

151
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:16,014
- Yea, man, her knockers.

152
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,087
- So you were trying to knock her!

153
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:20,028
- No, man, I am talking about her boobs!

154
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,023
- You know, these things?

155
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:26,089
- Oh, okay then, as long as you were not looking at that rib cage.

156
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:31,021
You stay the hell away from that rib cage!

157
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:37,022
- Bryson! New guy!

158
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:39,003
- I'm gonna destroy you!

159
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:43,074
Your face is gonna be so ugly when I am done with your face, cause... it's kinda handsome right now.

160
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:49,002
Ah.....!

161
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:52,090
- I wasn't ready! I want a rematch!

162
00:09:56,046 --> 00:10:00,084
Target is greatly outnumbered by opposition, each of them possesses some sort of netted-stick weapon.

163
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:05,089
Surrounded and unaware, she is vulnerable to attacks from all directions!

164
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:27,007
- Jose? Where did you come from?

165
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:28,088
- You almost took a shuttle cock to the face.

166
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:30,023
- But how did you...?

167
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:32,088
- What are you doing, come on, let me go!

168
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:36,025
How did I even get here, let me go! Come on!

169
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:39,061
- How did you do that?

170
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,096
- He's like... incredibly fast and strong.

171
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:49,030
- He's like a mystical creature that is fast and strong.

172
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:54,082
- I know right, he's like a... a unicorn!

173
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:59,008
- But a human... a "humicorn".

174
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:02,074
- Stop it guys, he's just different.

175
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:04,053
- He's a freak.

176
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:08,080
- I don't know, I think he is kinda cute the way he takes everything so seriously.

177
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,065
- It's kinda creepy... don't you think?

178
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:16,034
- He's harmless, he's like a little puppy that just wants all your attention.

179
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:20,061
- A "humicruppy"!

180
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:24,006
- You girls are ridiculous. Let's go.

181
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:26,097
- I think Taylor has a crush.

182
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:51,064
"High school students are the most dangerous and misunderstood citizens that you will ever come across!"

183
00:11:58,023 --> 00:12:00,076
- What happened?

184
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:03,032
- Slippery floors...

185
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,014
- What?

186
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:09,005
- Probably didn't see the "Piso Mojado" sign...

187
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:10,042
- What?

188
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,083
- Yea, let's just...

189
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,009
- But what about my...

190
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:22,002
- Uhh... yea, so I hope you have a good first day at school.

191
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:25,085
- You're still alive, so it's a great day.

192
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:29,021
- Okay, I'll see you later.

193
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:33,039
Oh, are you coming this way too?

194
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:50,089
- Hey, so I was talking to Mr. Anderson about the event coming right after homecoming.

195
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:55,017
I am gonna need a lot of help planing that event. I don't know how...

196
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,076
- No...!

197
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,047
- Ah..! Oh my god!

198
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:01,006
Get out of my room!

199
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,081
- Don't throw things...  No!

200
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,035
- Get away from me! Ah...!

201
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:06,069
- Alright, I am not gonna hurt you.

202
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:09,053
You just need to... just calm down, Okay?

203
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:12,031
- Okay...

204
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:15,030
- Are you trying to get yourself killed?

205
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,077
Did you know what you just almost did but didn't do because I didn't let you do what you wanted to do?

206
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:19,055
- Yes?

207
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:21,028
- No! You don't!

208
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:23,006
Do you know what this is?

209
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:27,013
This is Little Miss Double Rainbow Girly Cookies and you almost eat them all the way.

210
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:31,054
You don't even know who has handled this or who could have poisoned this.

211
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:32,060
- What?

212
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,091
- Look, I've been trying to stay undercover but you are making this too damn difficult.

213
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:38,095
First, first you handed over a pencil sharpener to someone with a pencil.

214
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:40,053
Do you wanna get stab in the neck?

215
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,091
And then, you almost took a shuttle cock to your face. Do you know how much that hurts?

216
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:49,009
Have you ever have a shuttle cock to your face before? No, you haven't. It hurts, I know.

217
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:55,090
Now you are eating cookies, you're eating cookies! Do you wanna get poisoned?...And fat?

218
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,039
Your carelessness is driving me insane!

219
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,021
- I am driving you insane?

220
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:07,075
My friends are right.. you are a freak...

221
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:10,084
I know exactly what you are...

222
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:16,002
- Oh you do, alright then say it, say it out loud.

223
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:18,031
- Unicorn...

224
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:23,050
- What? Unicorns don't even exist, in North America, probably.

225
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,010
- Then who... What are you?

226
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:33,006
- Alright look, I am gonna be completely honest with you.

227
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,098
I'm really not Mexican. My name is not Jose, it's Aiden.

228
00:14:36,098 --> 00:14:38,091
And I'm an A.S.S.

229
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:40,023
- Yea, you are.

230
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:44,004
- No, you don't understand. Look, I am in the final stages of becoming an Agent of Secret Stuff.

231
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:46,079
And my last mission was to come here and protect you.

232
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,000
- Protect me? From who?

233
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,009
- The S.I.N.S.!

234
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:53,062
- Is this all just to get me to go to church?

235
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:55,070
- Oh my god... You're stupid.

236
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,030
Alright, okay, here, here is the whole story.

237
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:06,084
Back in WWII, a group of fleeing Nazi special agents formed a society of assassins to secretly revenge the Axis of power. This group is called the Society Involving No-so-good Stuff.

238
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:15,035
One of the assassins only known as X when he could no longer support such a war in the world... fled the S.I.N.S. and started his own group of killers to battle all the S.I.N.S. plans.

239
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:20,009
They were known as the Agent of Secret Stuff. That's me.

240
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:22,060
The battle between A.S.S. and S.I.N.S. still continues today,

241
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,089
and you are the S.I.N.S.'s latest target, to which I am assigned to prevent you from being killed.

242
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:29,059
- But why me?

243
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:32,067
- I have no idea why, but I never question my orders.

244
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:36,095
"But why? I already did all the hard stuff."

245
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:39,052
- Wow...

246
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:44,097
You are seriously out of your mind. Can you leave?

247
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:46,046
- But Taylor, you are in danger.

248
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,055
- Stop! No I am not!

249
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:52,074
I am a normal girl that goes to a normal high school and nothing is going to happen.

250
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:55,076
The more you say that, the more it freaks me out, so please just stay out of my life!

251
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:56,063
- But I am trying to..

252
00:15:56,063 --> 00:16:00,021
- No! just leave! Please just go!

253
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:12,089
- I'm sorry, I never meant to upset you. I don't know what it is like to be a normal kid.

254
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:20,084
Ever since I was young, I was taught to never trust people, and to kill them instead.

255
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:23,032
- That's really sad.

256
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:29,035
- I've already failed my mission anyways... So, I'll stay out of your life.

257
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:38,082
- Wait, Aiden. I am sorry.

258
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:44,058
I know you meant well, but there is really no reason to be worried for me.

259
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:54,070
Look, I think you are a cool guy and I'd rather just learn to have fun and instead of being scared of secret agents and stuff.

260
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,077
Do you trust me?

261
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,072
- No, didn't you hear everything I just said?

262
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:07,003
- You know what, never mind, just come with me.

263
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:16,061
- Did you hear, Scott asked me to the dance?

264
00:19:16,061 --> 00:19:18,069
- Oh my god! That's so cute!

265
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:23,003
I feel like I've been waiting for this dance forever!

266
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:28,021
- Okay so DJ's set, the photographer's set, good job on the ticket sales, girls, I think we are ready for tonight!

267
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:29,075
- But there is one thing that isn't set.

268
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:31,017
- What, what did I miss?!

269
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:33,044
- A date!

270
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:34,019
- Guys...

271
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,062
- Maybe Aiden can help you out with that...

272
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:45,058
- So... um... that dance sounds pretty interesting.

273
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,019
- Yea, it's been a lot of work to plan.

274
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,027
- You don't have anyone to go with?

275
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:56,086
- No, not yet, I guess I've just been too busy.

276
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:59,086
- Right, I see.

277
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:03,049
Okay... Bye!

278
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:05,086
- Hi Taylor!

279
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:08,049
- Oh, Hey Melvin!

280
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:13,091
- Well, the dance is tonight. God, you know the dance is tonight,

281
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:16,016
You're planning it...

282
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:21,076
Anyways, I just want to ask you, you would go to the dance with me?

283
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:26,035
- Oh that is so sweet! But I don't know if I can because I have to...

284
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:30,016
- But you don't even have a date yet!

285
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:31,077
- Yea, but I am planning it...

286
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:35,047
Stop it... Stop it!

287
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:36,048
What are you doing?

288
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:39,056
- He was gonna attack you! with this!

289
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:40,047
- Are you crazy, this a flower!

290
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:42,098
- I swear there was a blade, right here!

291
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:47,024
- Have you not taught you anything? You still don't trust me!

292
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:52,070
You know, I thought you changed.

293
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,057
But you are still in your stupid crazy world.

294
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:56,062
Now you are just hurting innocent people.

295
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:57,055
- But I swear...

296
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:03,015
- No just stop it... Just stay away... Just leave me alone.

297
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:09,029
I tried, Aiden. I really did.

298
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:15,067
You know what Melvin, I will go to the dance with you.

299
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:23,092
Great...going Aiden.

300
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:27,036
Maybe Taylor was right, I don't belong here.

301
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,064
This whole mission is just stupid.

302
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:35,062
This is what it takes to get my A.S.S.H.O.L.E.? Maybe I don't even want it!

303
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,071
Taylor!

304
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:21,085
He is escaping to secret warehouse. Turn left.

305
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:34,030
Melvin getting away, hurry the hell up, dude.

306
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:39,016
- Where are they?

307
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:41,036
- What?

308
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:43,066
- Tell me where the training wheels are!

309
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:47,088
- What are you talking about, man, I go to high school, I don't use training wheels.

310
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:20,067
- Aiden!

311
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,014
- What...

312
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:23,033
- It's too late Aiden!

313
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:25,030
- No...!

314
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,026
- No, it's not!

315
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:29,049
- Oh, okay.

316
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,082
- But it's a trap.

317
00:23:30,082 --> 00:23:32,050
- No...!

318
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,028
- No it's not, don't listen to her.

319
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:36,020
- Oh, okay.

320
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,061
- No listen to me, it's a trap. Right there!

321
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:41,098
- A trap?

322
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:52,003
- I destroyed your trap, Melvin, it's over!

323
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:58,010
- Oh is it? I beg to differ. If anything, it's the exact opposite of over...

324
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,090
It's "under"...

325
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:05,085
Anyway, see we've already won.

326
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:09,068
Now that we have Taylor, we S.I.N.S. have everything to overthrow you,

327
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:10,095
stinky A.S.S.es.

328
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:13,054
- Wait... Taylor... Wait, what?

329
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:16,049
- You don't know about her?

330
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:19,066
- Well... I know some things...

331
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:25,030
I know that she can only read from left to right, that she's really good at hitting shuttle cocks with a netted-stick,

332
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:36,088
that she's really smart, funny and cute, that she's my best friend, my only friend.

333
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:39,005
- Aw... Aden...

334
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:45,013
- Aw... Aden... I mean... But I was thinking along the line of... She's the future of all the A.S.S.es.

335
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:46,025
-  She is?

336
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,012
- I am?

337
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:49,068
- Jeez, don't they teach anything over there?

338
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:50,089
You are one dumb ass!

339
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:54,006
- Nobody calls me dumb!

340
00:24:58,058 --> 00:25:00,048
- Aiden.. No!

341
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:02,016
- Mouse trap...

342
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,055
Good night, Aiden.

343
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:33,024
That's cute, Taylor.

344
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:38,092
Real cute. Now get back in your...

345
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:41,024
Fix your chair, and get back in it!

346
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,046
- How could you do this Melvin. We've been friends for years!

347
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:48,001
- Every year I've been trying to kill you.

348
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:52,018
- Because of people like you that Aiden can't live a normal life.

349
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:54,055
You made me miss my own homecoming dance.

350
00:26:54,055 --> 00:27:01,052
- Ha, don't you mean home-no-one's-coming dance?

351
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,098
1-0 Melvin!

352
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:10,034
Anyways, me and the kids have been talking about how your little dance and how we are not gonna go cause we are pretty sure that  it's gonna suck!

353
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:25,043
- What the hell, Taylor.

354
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,093
- I thought you wanna dance, Melvin.

355
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:54,008
- Aiden, are you okay?

356
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:56,075
- No! It hurts real bad.

357
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:59,015
- Thanks for coming after me.

358
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:01,042
- Can I tell you something?

359
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:03,088
- What?

360
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:07,061
- I told you so. - Shut up.

361
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,081
- Ruining the moment!

362
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:11,086
- Death chop!

363
00:28:15,081 --> 00:28:18,070
- Tracy? What are you doing here?

364
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,034
- I was informed you were in danger.

365
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:22,089
- By who?

366
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,041
- By me.

367
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,098
- Who are you?

368
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:27,002
- I am your...

369
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:28,076
- My father?

370
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:33,026
- What? No... How is that even possible, I am like the same age as you, that's disgusting.

371
00:28:33,026 --> 00:28:36,016
I am your step-step-brother-in-law.

372
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:40,020
You know what, don't worry about it. Your dad was really promiscuous, forget it, long story.

373
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,013
- He's been watching over you, Aiden. We all have.

374
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:50,069
- Then you know that I failed. Taylor was in great danger and I couldn't even protect her.

375
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:54,003
- On the contrary, you have succeeded.

376
00:28:54,003 --> 00:29:01,027
Not only have you discovered the S.I.N.S. agent within the high school but you have brought out Taylor's full potential,

377
00:29:01,027 --> 00:29:03,064
enriching what she's destined to become.

378
00:29:03,064 --> 00:29:07,012
- I did? Okay, cool.

379
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:10,027
- Me? what does that mean?

380
00:29:11,012 --> 00:29:13,006
- Taylor...

381
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:15,052
- Where are all these people coming from?

382
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:19,022
- Have you ever wondered why your parents are black?

383
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:20,046
- I was adopted...

384
00:29:20,046 --> 00:29:22,049
- And why you speak 10 languages?

385
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:24,054
- "Je ne sais pas?"

386
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:29,095
- Straight A student and very good at first person shooters.

387
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:35,057
And now you have defeated a S.I.N.S. agent with no training ever!

388
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:37,096
- Because I'm...awesome?

389
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:42,003
- Well, I could have done that too... If I wanted...

390
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:45,093
- It is in your blood, Taylor...

391
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:49,065
to be an amazing A.S.S.!

392
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:56,080
You are the daughter of Agent X, the founder of all the A.S.S.es.

393
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,005
Taylor, you are my daughter.

394
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:04,037
- But you are so old...

395
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:08,096
- But your mama was so young...

396
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:11,058
- Aiden, I am...

397
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:12,073
- My father?

398
00:30:12,073 --> 00:30:16,055
- No.. no, Aiden, no one here is your freaking father!

399
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:19,058
I mean he abandoned you at birth.

400
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:22,005
He is not coming back.

401
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:29,023
- Aiden, I am very proud to present you with the H.O.L.E.

402
00:30:29,023 --> 00:30:33,001
You are now an official Agent of Secret Stuff.

403
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:34,013
My A.S.S.H.O.L.E.

404
00:30:34,013 --> 00:30:37,012
- Congratulations, kid.

405
00:30:37,012 --> 00:30:38,094
- So now what.

406
00:30:38,094 --> 00:30:43,065
- And now... you are part of our world.

407
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:51,049
The S.I.N.S. will be following you and Aiden more intensely than ever before...

408
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:01,014
- The dance is ending right now!

409
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:05,029
- Oh yea, speaking of the dance, I was wondering if I can

410
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,039
- Aiden you wanna come to the homecoming dance with me?

411
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,002
- Yea sure, I got nothing better to do...

412
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:11,076
- Let's go.

413
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:28,025
No...

414
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:31,098
We're too late... we missed it.

415
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:46,042
- Sorry we missed your dance.

416
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:49,040
Being a secret agent is really hard.

417
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,056
- It's okay, it's not your fault.

418
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:05,075
Will you move to the musical notes with me?

419
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,048
- So Aiden, you have all the gagdets.

420
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:32,066
You can fight, you are brave, you are smart, and now you have your H.O.L.E

421
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:37,047
But you know you still have one thing missing if you want to be a secret agent.

422
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:41,065
- Wait, what? That's impossible, what could I be missing?

423
00:32:41,065 --> 00:32:48,034
- Well, everyone knows the real secret agent always gets the girl in the end.

424
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:54,093
- I've honestly never heard that before. That sounds ridiculous.

425
00:32:55,027 --> 00:33:02,089
But.. um... Maybe... maybe you can help me with that.

426
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:05,090
- Bush!

427
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,088
- Somebody's there.

428
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:08,034
- I'll go left. - I'll go right.

429
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:09,035
- Ready? One, two...

430
00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:12,030
- Wait! There's one more thing...
