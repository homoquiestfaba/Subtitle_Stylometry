1
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:13,113
Josh, can you please just, um,

2
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,516
- look at the storyboard here?
- Uh-huh.

3
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:16,416
Me and my storyboard artists

4
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:19,486
worked on these panels
for, uh, about six years here.

5
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,255
I don't want to
toot my own horn,

6
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,691
but, uh, there's been
a lot of anticipation

7
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,894
from the whole team
about this project,

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,394
so I just, uh...

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,130
I'm very excited to get started.

10
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,566
Okay.

11
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,367
What's that?

12
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:35,269
No, I think it's--

13
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,436
You're perfect
right there.

14
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,978
-I'm Izzy.
-And my name is Diana.

15
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,780
And we're making a movie.

16
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:47,582
And it's called <i>The Seed.</i>

17
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,552
<i>The Seed</i> is an intimate
neo-noir

18
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,454
reflecting on both the overt
and subvert oppression of women.

19
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,592
Is there another way
to say neo-noir?

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,627
No?

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,096
I just--
as a-- as a, you know...

22
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,499
It's like a neo-noir.

23
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,267
Not everyone knows
what neo-noir is.

24
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,836
Well, like,
then we don't need their money.

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,270
Okay.

26
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,205
It's about the things
that limit us.

27
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,144
The possibilities in the future
through plant life.

28
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,515
<i>The Seed</i> is a film about the...

29
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,789
Uh, apocalyptic? Fuck.

30
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:32,961
This gorgeous woman sitting
next to me, Diana Irvine,

31
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,127
is our lead actress.

32
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,832
I-- I actually do think

33
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:39,199
it's important
to show vulnerability, Izzy,

34
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,935
I think it's important to--

35
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,103
when you're asking for money
to, like, endear yourself.

36
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,639
It's okay, just be human.

37
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,408
Our fundraising goal
is 600 tho--

38
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:03,057
That's always the thing
on crowdfunding stuff.

39
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,358
It's like, "Okay, why this--"

40
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,094
you know, "Why this project?"

41
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,929
Like, what about it
is so special?

42
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,632
Like, why our film, you know?

43
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:11,833
Yeah.

44
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,569
Are you gonna donate?

45
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,273
Yeah. Deep need. Yes.

46
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,977
And you feel it.

47
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,080
Oh, Iz. Oh, Iz.

48
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:32,987
Oh, no, you're actually upset?

49
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,089
Oh, I thought
you were acting for a second.

50
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,456
I was like, "That's good."

51
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:39,393
Our fundraising goal
is $600,000.

52
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:40,561
Any amount helps.

53
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,269
Howdy.

54
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,743
We're making a movie! Yeah!

55
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,781
-Hey!
-Hey, Iz. Hey.

56
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,449
- Road trip. So fun.
- Hey, Josh.

57
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,118
- What's with the camera?
- Hey.

58
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,720
My brother's gonna do
behind the scenes stuff for us.

59
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:06,854
It's gonna be great
for marketing.

60
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,288
Okay.

61
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,223
So he's gonna
follow us in his car?

62
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,727
No, he's gonna, um...

63
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:14,829
he's coming with us

64
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,564
'cause you got
a big old car here.

65
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:19,266
I didn't know that
so I just gotta, um--

66
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,235
He's got these,
um, camera cases too,

67
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,172
so just, uh...

68
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,673
Uh-huh.

69
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:27,374
You still live
with your parents?

70
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:29,711
Yeah.

71
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:31,813
-Yeah.
-Dude.

72
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,549
You said you were gonna look
into the COVID protocols?

73
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,283
Yeah,
so that binder back there,

74
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,285
that's the whole--
that's all of it.

75
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,088
Oh, I thought
these were your lines.

76
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,856
No, no,
so that's the protocols

77
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,892
for the state and the city,
um, that we're gonna be in.

78
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,994
And then also
just my suggestions

79
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:48,663
for basic protocol on set.

80
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,364
This whole-- this whole--
this whole thing is--

81
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,134
- Mm-hmm?
- Did you read the whole thing?

82
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,235
- I compiled it.
- You wrote it?

83
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,904
Well, I compiled it.

84
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,306
But I think
we're fine in the car.

85
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,641
I think I'm gonna take mine off

86
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,176
because it's just,
like, you know.

87
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,178
It's just too much in the car.

88
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,947
It is a long drive, I guess.

89
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,282
It's three days.
It's three days, Diana,

90
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,818
I mean, come on.

91
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,720
- I'll skim it.
- No, don't skim it.

92
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,421
I mean, you know, you got
plenty of time to read it.

93
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,023
You can actually read it,
but we're okay

94
00:04:16,157 --> 00:04:17,792
because we're-- you know,
we're effectively--

95
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,060
a-- a family.

96
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:20,895
There's also a section in there

97
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,630
about intimacy
and physical intimacy.

98
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:26,299
No touching, no hugging,
definitely no kissing.

99
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,368
We can't have any, like,
on set romances

100
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:30,004
or any like, hooking up
or anything like that.

101
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:31,404
You hear that Josh?

102
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,107
No hooking up.

103
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:36,577
- I think that's a good rule.
- Okay.

104
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,278
I think
that's an important rule.

105
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,747
I think well done
for making that rule.

106
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,682
Uh, I think, yeah,
obviously no hooking up.

107
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:44,519
I mean, that's the best way

108
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,453
to get sick
for lots of different reasons.

109
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,089
Right, Diana?

110
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:49,657
You know some-- you know
a couple things about that.

111
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,760
- Don't put that in.
- What? Izzy.

112
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,731
How much longer?

113
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,066
Today? Like, six hours.

114
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,268
Thanks for driving.

115
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,708
Thanks so much for asking me.

116
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:10,044
I think it's really important
that I, in fact--

117
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,913
yeah, I think this is--
this is why you're here to--

118
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:15,516
so that I can share
all of my, you know, thoughts.

119
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,285
Making this film...

120
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,657
you know, it's just...

121
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,026
I've always dreamt
of making a film.

122
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,928
Have you directed
a film before?

123
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:31,364
I have observed from afar

124
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,302
many, uh,
very powerful directors

125
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,703
and from that,

126
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:38,438
I have gleaned
excellent techniques

127
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:40,107
and I will bring that
to this production

128
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,843
and I'm very excited about it.

129
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,986
Okay, not all--

130
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,321
You can stop now.

131
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,256
Oh, I am starving.

132
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,625
-This looks so good. Great.
-Yeah.

133
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:01,863
Did you just-- did you just
use the public bathroom?

134
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,565
Number two, so...

135
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,067
I...

136
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:08,803
I washed
my hands already, Diana.

137
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,505
Yeah, no, just,
you know, for safety.

138
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:17,444
Yeah, but the episode
should be airing soon.

139
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,412
I hope that,
you know, when I see Matt,

140
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,448
he'll tell me
if it was good or not

141
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,184
because I haven't
heard anything.

142
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,886
Did they like your
suggestions about the character?

143
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,621
Yeah, the director was,
like, all for it.

144
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,222
At first, a little resistant,

145
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:30,091
but then was just really
into me taking ownership.

146
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,458
And the wig
that you brought,

147
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,660
did they end up using that?

148
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,328
No, no, they didn't.

149
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,097
When that comes out
and then when this comes out.

150
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,699
- Yeah.
- Together it's gonna be so good.

151
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,334
I really want my reps also

152
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,069
to just, like,
see me in a new light

153
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:43,537
and I think that-

154
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,007
They didn't drop you?
I thought they dropped you?

155
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:49,844
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

156
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,679
They just said
that we should, you know,

157
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,915
have a talk when I get back.

158
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:56,684
- To part ways?
- Um, no, no, no, no, no.

159
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,052
I mean that's, you know,

160
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,187
I mean,
I might decide that I want that.

161
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,589
- But I think they just---
- Right.

162
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:02,690
They just want to touch base.

163
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,292
Got it, got it.

164
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,927
You know, they-- I need
to tell them where I'm at

165
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,561
and they need to know
how I feel.

166
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:09,096
Yeah, totally.

167
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,798
There's gonna be
an enormous amount of momentum

168
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:12,266
for you after this, I think.

169
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,834
Yeah, yeah. Oh, I can't wait.

170
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,636
- I need that.
- Yeah.

171
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,372
- I need that momentum.
- Yeah.

172
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,007
- See the sign.
- Yeah.

173
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:21,609
Really, just a sign
that it's gonna keep going.

174
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,077
Yeah.

175
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,414
Um, so you were supposed
to have gotten off

176
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,416
about eight miles ago.

177
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,984
Exit 75.

178
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,219
And let me try to find
the name of the road.

179
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:33,854
It's called "Exit 75."

180
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,990
I just feel like we're going
in circles a little bit.

181
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,659
Well, we'll go
in a circle for this...

182
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,161
- Okay.
- ...but we're not--

183
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,430
we're going in a pretty
straight line otherwise.

184
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,268
Josh, thank God
that you are here.

185
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,903
This is absolutely terrifying.

186
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,439
-Oh, shit!
-What? What?

187
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,941
I forgot to bring my toothpaste.

188
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,142
I'll just...

189
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,078
I'll just use some water.

190
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,180
Dude,
you can use my toothpaste.

191
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,615
- Really?
- Yeah, it's okay.

192
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,617
It wasn't
in the protocols though.

193
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,019
It's okay.

194
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:18,966
Did you brush your teeth yet?

195
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:23,237
You have to brush
your teeth tonight, Josh.

196
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,343
He has this thing
about brushing his teeth.

197
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,212
- It's gross.
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,180
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-What?

199
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,349
Ew, I don't know,
there's something on the floor,

200
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:37,084
there's something there.

201
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:38,452
Gotta wipe it.

202
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,720
Do you have
any more of those wipes?

203
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,122
- It's like tar.
- Tar?

204
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,957
Did you tell her
that we're here?

205
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,458
- Did, like--
- No, I texted her.

206
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,060
Okay.

207
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,595
She didn't text me back.
I think she does.

208
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:48,763
She didn't text you back?

209
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,297
Well, like, I don't--

210
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,699
Does she know
we're coming today?

211
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,401
Oh, my God,
this is so beautiful.

212
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,769
Oh, my God.

213
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,404
Oh, my God,
it's beautiful.

214
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,005
Do you think
we can eat that corn

215
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,175
or is it like, uh--
like, uh, ornamental corn?

216
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,010
- Wait, what is that?
- What?

217
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:04,645
Oh, my God.

218
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,180
Oh, my God,
that is beautiful.

219
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,949
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow. Wow.

220
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,851
Di, there's a tree,
what the fuck?

221
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,253
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus.

222
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,788
- Hi, Izzy.
- Hi!

223
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,524
- How you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

224
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,258
What a beautiful farm you have.

225
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,527
This work for you?

226
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,127
Yeah, I think it'll work.

227
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:21,796
Diana was telling me
how incredible you looked

228
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,264
on the horse
when you were driving in.

229
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,199
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

230
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:28,135
Well, I used to ride
so I just-- I miss it, you know?

231
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,771
-You used to ride?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,306
-What kind of riding?
-What did you do?

233
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,577
Um, like, a mix
of little-- a little English

234
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,315
and, um, uh,
the-- the-- the-- you know.

235
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,317
Yeah, cool.

236
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:44,652
-That's awesome.
-Yeah.

237
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,288
-There is a guy here.
-Yeah?

238
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,756
He's been looking for you.

239
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,024
-Wait, does he have a poof?
-He does.

240
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,725
He keeps asking about the WiFi.

241
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,627
Dude, you gotta wear
your mask.

242
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,262
I'm six feet, bro!

243
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:56,864
Oh, there he is. Hi, Matt!

244
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,232
-Hi.
-What's up?

245
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,834
He's my producer.

246
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,069
- He's amazing. Um...
- Okay.

247
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:03,637
- He grows on you.
- All good.

248
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,272
- I'll let you settle in.
- Amazing.

249
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:06,907
Well, yeah, you guys
should definitely hang out.

250
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,843
-I think you'll really--
-Yeah.

251
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,278
We will.
It'll-- we'll-- I'll see ya.

252
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,613
Why did you just say that?

253
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,781
It's so awkward, Izzy.

254
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,249
I want you to be friends.

255
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,650
Yeah, but, like...

256
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,525
<i>The Seed</i>
is set in a barn,

257
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,959
which is why
we're in Kentucky here.

258
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,729
I really wanted
to combine rural America

259
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:30,631
with a sort of dystopian view,

260
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,367
sort of superimpose that
on-- on it.

261
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:36,370
Luckily, I have family friends
who own a barn here in Kentucky.

262
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,240
This image here, I think
really encapsulates the film,

263
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,276
you know, somewhat surrealist,
somewhat noir.

264
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,711
We had to, um...

265
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,581
scale back a little bit

266
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:50,151
on, um-- on these ideas just,
uh, for budgetary concerns,

267
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:53,287
so disregard
all of the, um, protective gear,

268
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,991
but, um, that was
the original intent.

269
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,493
I love this, Josh.

270
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,362
Little movement.

271
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,864
Most of my character work
starts with-- with costume

272
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:07,502
and-- and within the costuming,
starts with the feet.

273
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:10,804
My feet touch the earth.
It's how I stay grounded.

274
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,340
So I need to look down
and go, "That's Delta."

275
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,077
You know, from here up,
I'm Diana

276
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,380
and from here down, Delta.

277
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:21,715
So it's a--
it's a big part of my process.

278
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:22,917
Acting.

279
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,119
Are shoes as important to you?

280
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,820
Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,390
- I think it's important...
- Okay.

282
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:30,891
...for a character...

283
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:32,927
to get into character.

284
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,295
To get in some shoes.

285
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,964
- It's a-- wardrobe.
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:40,434
Are those good pants
for horseback riding?

287
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,170
-Are there horses in this?
-No.

288
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,773
If you put a horse in this,
I can ride it.

289
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,475
I just didn't do
the world-building for that,

290
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,512
um, when I did my research.

291
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:53,414
Um, I didn't think about horses.

292
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,250
Okay, that's fine.

293
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,085
But we could ask Izzy.

294
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:01,255
I-- um, I can-- I can prep that,
I can prep that.

295
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,726
Then I am gonna...

296
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:07,629
put my pants on.

297
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,063
Great!

298
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:13,000
- So...
- So...

299
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,237
Gotta take these pants off
to get these pants on.

300
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,072
Yeah,
totally, absolutely.

301
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,774
Uh, I'm gonna go talk to Izzy
about the horses.

302
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,476
- Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.

303
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:23,678
Well, it's a survival film.

304
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,779
So, um, if there-- if it--

305
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,248
if we're still in that range,
then we're good.

306
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,551
Okay.
Yeah, for sure. Okay, bye.

307
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:31,485
Um, well, I...

308
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,855
I-- I think
everything has gluten in it, Di.

309
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,392
-Okay, that's-- that's fine.
-I'm so sorry.

310
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:40,894
No, no, no, no worries.
I just-- I just won't to eat.

311
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,930
- Okay, so--
- Hey!

312
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,865
-Oh, Geoff, hi.
-Hey, I made it.

313
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:48,135
You made it?
You're-- Geoff, you're late.

314
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,604
Yeah, I had to take care
of something.

315
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:51,105
What's with all these cameras?

316
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,840
- Matt, this is Jeff.
- Hey, 'sup, man?

317
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,309
This is our DP,
Alec has won a lot of awards.

318
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,444
We're super lucky to have him
and let me introduce you

319
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,380
to our co-- your co-stars,

320
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,982
um, Diana and, um, Devon,
this is Geoff.

321
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,518
-Hey, ladies.
-Hey.

322
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:04,719
Ma'am.

323
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,554
While I have you all here,

324
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:08,723
I've just got some, uh, forms
for you to sign.

325
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,157
- Here you go.
- Safety first.

326
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,059
- Safety first.
- At all times.

327
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,295
Just some
standard contracts, you know,

328
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:16,363
release forms, yadda, yadda,
yadda, boring, boring, boring.

329
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:19,066
Yeah, you can just sign
at the bottom.

330
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,503
That's right, you can skip
three through, uh, seven.

331
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,170
It's just right there.

332
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,572
This is just to release
production from responsibility

333
00:13:24,706 --> 00:13:26,006
if something goes down...

334
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:27,908
which of course it won't

335
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,076
'cause we've got Izzy in charge.

336
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,745
Am I right? Sound good?

337
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,880
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

338
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,416
Try to distract them
when they're looking at it.

339
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,318
If they read the whole thing,
they might have more questions.

340
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:39,219
- Oh, what kind of questions?
- Here we go.

341
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,487
Why does it say

342
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:42,856
that "the production
is not responsible

343
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,993
if any of us
catches any kind of--"

344
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,961
If you get sick,

345
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,430
we can't actually tell
where it came from, right?

346
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:51,031
So you don't know
that it came from here.

347
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,701
You know what I mean? We can't--

348
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,569
I don't know, I mean,
like, if all of us got sick,

349
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,036
I think it'd be pretty obvious.

350
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,539
- Hey-- hey, Matt?
- Yes, ma'am.

351
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,507
I'm just wondering why that part

352
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:01,543
is handwritten on the back?

353
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:03,712
Sure, that was,
uh, that's-- that's--

354
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,613
that's a little touch from me.

355
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,515
Bottom line is
if you don't fill out

356
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,883
these forms tonight,
we can't film tomorrow.

357
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,186
So just sign at the bottom.

358
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,921
- Hey, guys?
- Thank you, brother.

359
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:17,324
Who, um, wants some wine?

360
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,893
No, no,
we're working tomorrow, so.

361
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,529
Oh, yeah, totally.

362
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:23,063
- Um, I'll have some.
- Okay, cool.

363
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,965
I got it,
the initials work.

364
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,534
Bless you.

365
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:28,001
Just sign at the bottom

366
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,371
and, uh-- and, uh,
I'll date it for you

367
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:31,606
if you want me to.

368
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,073
Yep, thank you, brother.

369
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,711
Um, are we doing
the read through

370
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,546
tonight or tomorrow morning?

371
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,247
Oh,
we actually have enough time

372
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,249
for either a read through
or load in,

373
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,051
so a real Sophie's choice.

374
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,621
You didn't schedule time
for a load in, what the--

375
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:48,155
I can squeeze one in,

376
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,657
but then we've got
to pull up the call time

377
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,091
by two and a half hours.

378
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,026
- Matt, she'd have to do the--
- No she doesn't.

379
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,629
All right, y'all,
so what we're gonna do

380
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,664
is we're gonna pull
the call time up tomorrow

381
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,666
by about two and a half hours
to make room for the load in.

382
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,033
That's about 4:30 a.m.,

383
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,569
not too bad, not too bad at all.

384
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:02,771
That's fine,
I've done that before.

385
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,271
Easy pe--

386
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,006
Oh, and hey,
not gonna print new call sheets.

387
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,609
Why waste paper, yeah?
So just do the math.

388
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:10,043
Subtract about 150 minutes
from whatever it is now

389
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,445
and that's your call time, 4:30.

390
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,180
Gotta save those trees.
Right, Diana?

391
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,682
I was actually wondering, Matt,

392
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:17,284
um, how the episode
is coming together,

393
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,052
how the edit is,
and when is it gonna--

394
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,221
The episode. Our episode.

395
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,857
-Yeah, I'm dying to know.
-Oh, my gosh.

396
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,258
Also, it was so fun
working with you

397
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,693
and I'm glad
we get to do it again.

398
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:27,094
Oh, me too.

399
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,563
I'm really glad
we get to do it again

400
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:30,565
because that episode
has changed a lot.

401
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,433
Okay, cool.
I'm excited to see it.

402
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,268
I'll mark my calendar.
When is it coming out?

403
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,103
It's coming out next month

404
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,205
and it's not gonna look
anything like you remember.

405
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,608
Primarily from
your character's perspective.

406
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,911
Cool, can I still get
the footage for my reel?

407
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,978
You can't get
the footage anymore,

408
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,247
contractually and legally,
because, uh...

409
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,651
You know what?
Take a deep breath in.

410
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,985
Exhale.

411
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,454
One more time. Deep breath in.

412
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,155
You're not in it anymore.
We re-casted.

413
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,591
Exhale.

414
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,928
Let that part out
of your system.

415
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,797
-Matt, sorry.
-We had to recast the part.

416
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,899
You did everything right.

417
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:07,635
We were just looking at it
and thought maybe somebody else.

418
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:09,871
- Wait, sorry, I'm-- I'm lost--
- Don't be sorry.

419
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,371
No, no, Di. Don't be sorry.

420
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:13,106
Because now
we've got <i>The Seed, </i> huh?

421
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,576
Let's leave the past
in the past.

422
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:15,710
It's not even smart
to talk about it.

423
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,311
You recast me?

424
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,213
We did recast you,
but that was then, this is now,

425
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,516
and now you're first
on the call sheet, babe.

426
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,685
And I think this is redemption.
Hold that thought.

427
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:24,985
Hey, Geoff. Geoff, Geoff, Geoff.

428
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:28,188
It's actually- whoa,
we've gotta distribute these.

429
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,424
Protocol, you know what I mean?
Want some wine?

430
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:31,992
- Yeah, I do.
- Got it.

431
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,194
I would actually
love some wine, too.

432
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,362
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

433
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,731
- Sure.
- Thanks.

434
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,298
Are you okay? Are you okay?

435
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:39,934
- Oh, I'm so good.
- All right.

436
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,401
I just-- I just changed my mind.

437
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,470
Really happy to be here.
Thank you so much.

438
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:45,439
And hey, I hate
that we had to do it like this,

439
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:46,941
but I know you can handle it.

440
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,543
-You know what?
-Yeah?

441
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,512
We'll just-- you'll get me
on the next one, right?

442
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,179
I will get you on that--
you know, I got you on this one.

443
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,014
-How about that?
-Can I get some more wine?

444
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,718
Or actually something stronger.
Do we have any--

445
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:58,586
Is that normal for, like--

446
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,522
to do, like, the whole roll
and get cut?

447
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:04,491
Um, it does happen
to some people.

448
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:06,493
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

449
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:08,930
And you know-- you know people
make-- make-- make choices,

450
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,465
I mean, editing-- a movie
is made three times, right?

451
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,701
When it's-- when it's written,
when it's shot,

452
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:16,671
and when it's edited,
so, um, there's a lot of...

453
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,207
there's a lot of changes
that happened.

454
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,609
I'm just gonna-- um,
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.

455
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:22,944
- And then I'll be back.
- Okay.

456
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,746
Can you not? Just don't--

457
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,648
- What is happening?
- Just don't talk to her, okay?

458
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:30,150
She's-- it's-- it's-- it's
just happened a lot, okay?

459
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,252
So please just
don't say anything.

460
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:36,056
Are these guys gonna be filming
the whole time?

461
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:39,794
Um...

462
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:41,930
yeah.

463
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,297
Izzy, this is so weird.

464
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,832
I'm gonna need you

465
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:46,601
to blur my face out
of all of this stuff.

466
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,201
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- Sorry.

467
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:49,938
Yeah, I'm gonna see
how Diana is.

468
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,338
Okay.

469
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,342
Is this your first movie, too?

470
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,377
Yeah.

471
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,446
-Yeah.
-Cool.

472
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,415
Yep.

473
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,818
It's gonna be great.

474
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,253
It's gonna be great.

475
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,590
- Good night.
- Night.

476
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:11,091
Hey, Josh.

477
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:13,027
Do you know where I'm staying?

478
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,629
Uh...

479
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,509
<i>Good morning.</i>

480
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,246
<i>Guess what day it is today?</i>

481
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,851
<i>It's the first day of my movie!</i>

482
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,452
<i>And I'm just, um...</i>

483
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:45,927
<i>I'm just really happy.</i>

484
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,427
<i>I'm really happy.</i>

485
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:51,599
<i>I have been on sets</i>
<i>for ten years...</i>

486
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,768
<i>as the assistant</i>
<i>to somebody else</i>

487
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:56,871
<i>and guess-- guess what?</i>

488
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,472
<i>Not anymore!</i>

489
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:01,576
<i>This time, it's my set...</i>

490
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:05,813
<i>and I'm not an assistant.</i>

491
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:08,650
<i>It's so good.</i>

492
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,485
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

493
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,625
<i>If I can do it, so can you.</i>

494
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,360
<i>Keep going.</i>

495
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,787
-Oh, hey, Geoff.
-Hey, morning.

496
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,722
-Hi.
-Yeah.

497
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,594
Hey, um, is my boom guy
here yet?

498
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:56,631
Oh, yeah, buddy, we cut him.

499
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,800
You-- you what?

500
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:00,968
We cut him.

501
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,379
Motherf--

502
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,848
Dude.

503
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,650
What's your job?

504
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,384
Don't you have some,
like, acting exercises to do?

505
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,721
- No.
- That's really too bad.

506
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,455
How high's that go up?

507
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:24,125
Hey, um,
have a sound pack for you.

508
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,761
So are you comfortable
with this?

509
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,030
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Down here.

510
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:30,598
Okay.

511
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,332
Hey, Diana.

512
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:33,901
-You look bad.
-Okay.

513
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:36,504
Hey, Matt, sorry,
do you have an Ibuprofen?

514
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,438
Nah, Ibuprofen? No.

515
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,109
Wait, you're not sick, are you?

516
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,544
-No, no, I just have a headache.
-Okay, are you sure?

517
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:45,713
Because we're all getting tested
again tomorrow.

518
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:48,850
-Yeah, I promise I'm fine.
-Okay.

519
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,352
Um, Josh, do you-- no.

520
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:55,523
Did you drink too much?

521
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,193
Nice costume, man.

522
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:00,995
It's just
my regular clothes, man.

523
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:07,168
Hey, Izzy,
why does this guy have a beeper?

524
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:11,672
Um, I don't know, he's just,
like, a nostalgic kind of guy.

525
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:14,709
Hey, Izzy, how do you
and Geoff know each other?

526
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,880
Uh, just--

527
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,882
uh, I don't know,
like, out and about.

528
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:25,052
- Ew.
- Out and about.

529
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,487
Rehearsal, everybody!

530
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,190
Okay, so tell me
about your limp.

531
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,092
You push your hip forward
and then you roll with it.

532
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:32,193
Okay, two more times.

533
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,928
Delta Ray.

534
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,803
It's empty.

535
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:00,320
You don't know
what's in that.

536
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,257
I do now.

537
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:06,727
High levels of nitrogen,
little phosphorus.

538
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:12,867
Potassium carbonate.

539
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,670
Someone tried
to burn something here.

540
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:18,806
Maybe a body.

541
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:26,346
Okay, sorry.

542
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,516
I'm so sorry, guys.
I'm so sorry. Um...

543
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:29,984
Okay, while we're holding,

544
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:31,853
are we gonna be going in
any tighter or?

545
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,855
Because I'm saving
a lot for the--

546
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:36,489
Yeah, no, we'll go tighter.
Just-- just-- just a moment.

547
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:38,960
We'll-- We'll-- Diana. We'll...

548
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:40,360
Go check it out.

549
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,229
Yeah, I'll definitely go
check it out.

550
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,697
Okay.

551
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:45,967
Like, now.

552
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,568
Oh, like, right now, right now.
Got it.

553
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:52,139
- Hi!
- Hey, can I help you?

554
00:22:52,273 --> 00:22:54,008
- Hey.
- Can I help you?

555
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,442
- Yeah.
- Okay.

556
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:57,778
-I'm here for a set visit.
-Oh, okay.

557
00:22:57,912 --> 00:22:59,680
Uh, normally when you come
to see somebody on set,

558
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:01,414
you're coming
to watch them film,

559
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,951
so you wouldn't drive up
slamming on your horn.

560
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:06,654
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That's exactly what I did.

561
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,155
That's exactly what you did.

562
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:11,325
-Matt, this is Felipe.
-Uh, Felipe? Felipe.

563
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,727
- Felipe!
- Hi.

564
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,394
-Hey.
-I'm so sorry.

565
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:15,428
- All right.
- It's okay.

566
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:17,497
Oh, my God.

567
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:20,500
Hi, Felipe. You're here!

568
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:23,004
-You're doing it.
-I'm doing it.

569
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:24,639
Um, how are you?

570
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:26,406
- How was the drive?
- It was wonderful.

571
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,110
I saw a bird that I think
was pretty much the same bird

572
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,511
just followed me half the ride.

573
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:31,946
I met a girl in Wichita.

574
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,649
-Wichi-- Wichi-- Wichita.
-Wichita.

575
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:36,617
Her name was Chastity

576
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:39,020
and, uh, I spent the night
just, like, holding her

577
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:40,121
while she cried

578
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,322
and it was transcendent.

579
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:45,026
So you with the, um, stranger
on the way--

580
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:46,227
With Chastity.

581
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:49,964
Wow, okay,
so, um, just by the way,

582
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,967
so we can't hook up
with anybody here.

583
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,636
Diana's--
It's Diana's rules, so.

584
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,706
Just for s-- you know, safety.

585
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:00,841
-Okay.
-Oh, hi, guys.

586
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:03,511
This is Felipe.
He's our financier.

587
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:05,012
He's, you know,
big man on campus.

588
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:06,580
He's the reason
that we're all here.

589
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:07,848
So, I think, like,
let's give him

590
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:10,351
a really big round of applause.

591
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:13,486
- Yay, Felipe!
- Stop!

592
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:15,289
- So fun.
- Stop it.

593
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,457
Stop it, you guys.

594
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:20,628
Stop, stop.

595
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,730
All right,
should we keep going?

596
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,566
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, come on guys.

597
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,970
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Come on. Geoff.

598
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,604
- We'll talk.
- Great.

599
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,039
Let's make a movie!

600
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:33,574
Hi!

601
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,109
Thanks for so much,
like, for all of this.

602
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,511
Oh, my God, it's my pleasure.
I'm so excited.

603
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,548
Everyone--

604
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,482
Actually, can I get a headset?

605
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:44,352
-Oh, Stefan.
-Oh, yeah, sure.

606
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,920
Can we get a headset for Felipe?

607
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:47,688
No? No more headsets?

608
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:50,490
-Um...
-Um...

609
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:52,560
Yeah, that's fine.

610
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:54,562
Oh, my God. Thank you.

611
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,330
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay. That's really sweet.

612
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,232
That's, like, amazing 'cause
you already know the script.

613
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,167
Okay. And action.

614
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,471
What y'all doing on my land?

615
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:05,573
Actually, just so I'm not,
like, get in the way again,

616
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:07,375
can I sit?

617
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,477
'Cause I've been driving and
my legs are, like, killing me.

618
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,079
I just don't want
to complain again about it--

619
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:13,547
You want to sit
because you've been driving?

620
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:14,949
Yeah, that's fine.

621
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:16,450
I'm so sorry,
of course, take a seat.

622
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:18,319
Thank you so much. Thank you.

623
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:20,821
- Um, yeah, no problem.
- That's better.

624
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,057
Why does it just keep...

625
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:30,531
- Hey.
- Hey.

626
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:32,767
You're on my target.

627
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:36,604
Um-- oh! Oh, oh, wow.

628
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:38,305
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

629
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:39,707
Wow. This is...

630
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,309
that's cool.

631
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:45,646
-You wanna try?
-No, no, no.

632
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,081
Why not?

633
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:48,949
Come on.

634
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:51,218
-Left forearm.
-Okay.

635
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:52,653
Yep.

636
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,288
-Grab it right below my hand.
-Okay.

637
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,090
Nope. Below. Yeah. Nice.

638
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,359
- Okay. Two fingers.
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:25:58,492 --> 00:25:59,994
Just gonna pull it
right back onto the string.

640
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:01,829
-Into here. Okay.
-Yep, that's nice.

641
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,597
-Okay, you can go.
-Oh, my gosh.

642
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:05,032
I want you
to square your hips up.

643
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,301
-Okay.
-Okay. This arm straight out.

644
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:08,469
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

645
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:10,271
Now pull this one back.

646
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,873
You're gonna anchor your thumb
to the corner of your mouth.

647
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,342
-Yeah? When you're ready.
-Mm-hmm.

648
00:26:15,476 --> 00:26:17,678
-Okay. Yep.
-Okay.

649
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:19,346
Gotta keep it square.

650
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,881
-Okay.
-Yep. Good.

651
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,917
Nice. Yep. Straight.

652
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,952
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
It's really scary.

653
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,720
-It's okay.
-I'm so sorry.

654
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:29,558
-No, you're doing well.
-Okay, I just feel--

655
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,093
Good. That's good. You got it.

656
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:34,563
-I'm just nervous.
-Don't be.

657
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:35,996
Okay.

658
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,667
There you go. Yep. Way back.

659
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,136
-Arms straight. Eyes forward.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

660
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,338
Slightly down. Good.

661
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:46,640
When you're ready.
Keep your eyes forward.

662
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:49,143
-Yes. Sorry.
-Just release the two fingers.

663
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,749
-Wow!
-That was actually really good.

664
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,751
I've never done that before!

665
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,588
Well, you did a really good job.

666
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,122
-Thank you.
-You're so welcome.

667
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:02,890
-Wanna do it again?
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

668
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,526
-No?
-No. You take that.

669
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:06,427
-Okay.
-But I'm really grateful.

670
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:07,895
You're so welcome.

671
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:10,664
And now it's a new--
new skill of mine.

672
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,503
As a thespian I can tell people

673
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:16,103
I've-- I've done it
before at least.

674
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:17,771
Cool, well,
I'll leave you to it.

675
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:20,341
I don't wanna--
I don't wanna im-- impede.

676
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,843
- All right.
- I'll see you.

677
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:28,315
Ooh, I need to make sure
you understand your job.

678
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:30,317
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, so what happens?

679
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:34,321
Before 11, girls get in free,
dude, you can't charge them.

680
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:36,857
Chicks in free, dicks pay.
Yeah, chicks free, dicks--

681
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,392
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you get it.
Make it a rhyme.

682
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:41,228
Okay, it's not a club.
No, it's a lounge.

683
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:42,429
That's right.

684
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:44,599
Dude, I'm on a movie set, bro.

685
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:51,972
Put Mom on the phone.
Put Mom on the phone, dude.

686

694
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:25,172
Dinner's good?

695
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,074
Yeah, no,
we should-- we should--

696
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,842
Yeah, it's really yummy.
Who made it?

697
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:31,946
- I think it's really yummy.
- Yeah, it's delicious.

698
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,048
Soul food, that's that supper.

699
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:35,950
-I'm just gonna go eat outside.
-No, Di, Di, Di.

700
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,686
We're a pod,
so we're actually all safe.

701
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:39,621
- Yeah, we're a pod.
- This is good. We're safe.

702
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:42,723
Out of all the pods I'm in,
I trust this pod the most.

703
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:44,325
Are you-- are you
in more than one pod?

704
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,726
- What does that mean?
- Yeah.

705
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,494
Well, it's like a pod of pods.

706
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:49,163
I don't think that's-- I don't
think that's how it works.

707
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:50,632
That's not
how it works at all.

708
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:54,501
-CDC.
-Okay. Okay, sure. You're right.

709
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:55,670
I think it's okay, Di.

710
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:57,071
It's-- we just, like,

711
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:58,872
cleaned-washed
our hands and stuff.

712
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:02,544
Do you want me
to get you some more food?

713
00:29:02,677 --> 00:29:04,345
-No, no, I got plenty.
-Okay.

714
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:06,780
So I've been meaning to ask you,
is this your first feature?

715
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,250
I did
a TV movie last-- last spring,

716
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:12,086
but this is the first time
I'm a lead,

717
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:14,088
- so...
- Amazing.

718
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:16,558
This is my first time, so,
I mean, give me some pointers.

719
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:18,959
Yeah, 'cause you've done
a lot of theater and stuff?

720
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:21,862
I mean,
it's not really theater per se.

721
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:24,498
-It's more like dinner theater.
-Um, hey, guys.

722
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:29,303
Um, in the, uh, spirit
of community and sharing,

723
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,707
we're actually
all gonna, um, share

724
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,376
the cost of food for production.

725
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,378
- Is that a joke?
- Yeah.

726
00:29:37,512 --> 00:29:39,013
I mean, I thought Felipe was
bankrolling this whole thing.

727
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:40,848
I'm getting a phone call.

728
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,950
<i>Bonjour. Oui.</i>

729
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,386
- Uh...
- Okay, listen.

730
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,354
Honestly, we have
a tight budget, all right?

731
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:49,724
- So, uh--
- What budget?

732
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,459
-You're not paying us.
-Yeah, they are.

733
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:54,995
They're paying you?

734
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,232
-What?
-Oh, great. Okay.

735
00:29:58,365 --> 00:29:59,567
I see that
we've reached a consensus.

736
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:01,268
Beautiful.

737
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:04,972
Um, so production will be
covering the cost of food

738
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,941
and thank you so much
for all speaking your truth.

739
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:10,811
It's very helpful
for me, so great.

740
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,346
When she says from now on,

741
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,181
does that mean
we have to pay for this one?

742
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:15,883
'Cause it's tasted way better
when it was free.

743
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:17,686
How are we actually
going to cover that?

744
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,086
Um...

745
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:24,491
Felipe, you know, has donated
so much already, so, uh...

746
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:32,333
Uh, well, you know,
um, my unemployment check

747
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:35,603
I think will clear
at the end of this week

748
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:37,505
and then I can
probably cover half of it

749
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:40,908
and then you could maybe cover
the other half maybe?

750
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:42,910
I, uh...

751
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:48,482
Oh, um, okay, no, that's okay.

752
00:30:48,616 --> 00:30:50,084
No, it's my project

753
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:53,087
and I will shoulder,
um, the costs.

754
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,589
You sure?
'Cause I don't wanna be a dick.

755
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:57,891
Yeah, no, it's my choice
and it's my voice.

756
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,393
I love that rhyme.

757
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:01,629
Josh,
you're filming this too?

758
00:31:01,763 --> 00:31:03,263
Unpaid work.

759
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,769
Grab a chicken wing.
Grab a chicken wing.

760
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:10,371
Yeah, there's more
that's here for you guys.

761
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:12,607
Hi. Hello. Yes, yes.

762
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:16,745
Um, my name is Is-- Isabel,
Isabel Shill,

763
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,012
S-H-I-L-L.

764
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:20,381
Yes, that's right.

765
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,317
Hi, Candace.
Yes, so nice to-- uh, hello.

766
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,421
I was wondering, um,
uh, if there's any way for me

767
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:30,558
to increase my credit card limit
on my Visa?

768
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:34,995
Um, uh, it's already-- okay.

769
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:38,666
No. Okay. Um, that's fine.

770
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,768
That's fine.

771
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,268
How about...

772
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,437
um...

773
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:45,673
how about on my dad's card?

774
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:47,241
What the fuck?

775
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,013
Okay. Focus, focus.

776
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:56,150
Okay. Focus.

777
00:31:56,718 --> 00:31:58,787
Big Geoff to Little Geoff,
real talk right here.

778
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,021
That picket fence. The family.

779
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,591
That ship sailed.
We didn't make it.

780
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:04,925
Uh-huh.

781
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,327
It doesn't have to be
like before.

782
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:13,601
Right, yeah. You're an actor.

783
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,436
You got this.

784
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,673
It's like that thing Jack says.

785
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,843
Lie to yourself first,
double down,

786
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:23,578
the world falls into place.

787
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:29,517
Don't screw this up.

788
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:40,260
Good morning, camera.

789
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,229
- Good morning, Geoff.
- Oh, hey.

790
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:43,665
- Did you sleep okay?
- No.

791
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:45,466
Do you want me
to move that?

792
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,901
No.

793
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:48,435
That's
a safety hazard, Alec.

794
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:51,038
- Geoff.
- Geoff, please.

795
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:54,609
What are you doing, man?

796
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:56,644
- Morning!
- Hi, Diana!

797
00:32:56,778 --> 00:32:58,813
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, good morning.

798
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,549
Izzy, can you
clear frame please?

799
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:05,887
Did you-- did you
just touch my prop?

800
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,155
What? No, no.

801
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:10,157
I would never.

802
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,827
Uh, yeah, sure. Whatever.

803
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:15,563
I-- okay,

804
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:17,932
guys, guys,
I think the communication

805
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:19,667
is breaking down
a little bit here.

806
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:21,803
-Please don't touch the camera.
-Just checking the frame.

807
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:23,705
Geoff, get-- Jesus!

808
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:27,307
- Josh... Six feet!
- Okay, dude!

809
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:29,511
Sorry, Jesus. Stop.

810
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:31,546
Like a fucking zoo.

811
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,282
-Geoff, get away from me.
-When do we rehearse?

812
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:36,784
Hey, Geoff, clear frame.

813
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:38,786
This is all frame. Thank you.

814
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,124
Are you kidding me?
Get out of my space.

815
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:47,461
The genetics are malleable.

816
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,701
Jesus.

817
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:08,248
You know,
she's-- she's asexual, you know?

818
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:11,351
Ugh, what?

819
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:15,255
Seriously?

820
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:19,293
- I'm not.
- Huh?

821
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:26,199
Josh!

822
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,235
- Get outta here.
- Why?

823
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:30,270
- That's weird. Stop.
- You're weird.

824
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:43,083
- Can I help you?
- Y-- yes.

825
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,068
Hi. Yes.

826
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,771
I would like to report
a work violation in Kentucky.

827
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,541
Not LA. No.

828
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:08,543
I've brought it up several times

829
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:09,911
and production doesn't seem
interested

830
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:10,945
in following the regulations

831
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,446
that, as far as I know,

832
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,648
state and local governments
have issued.

833
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:14,716
No, I have a list.

834
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,483
What? Oh, sorry, what?

835
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:18,820
My membership number?

836
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:22,624
Um, uh, I thought I could make
an anonymous complaint?

837
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:25,225
That's what it said
on the website at least.

838
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:28,495
Right. Right, I--

839
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,198
There aren't any
SAG performers on this shoot.

840
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:35,103
Well, that was
such a funny joke.

841
00:35:35,235 --> 00:35:36,203
No, it's not.

842
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:38,906
I am not in SAG

843
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,274
but I am SAG eligible.

844
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:44,512
Yeah. Oh. Sure.

845
00:35:45,113 --> 00:35:46,179
I-- mm-hmm.

846
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:48,148
Well-- well-- well, thank you.

847
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:51,886
Thank you for all
that you do for--

848
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,320
Hello?

849
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,891
Um, I'm just...

850
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,031
Hello?

851
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:18,579
Morning.

852
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:26,888
So, here, um, I'm really,
really excited about this.

853
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:28,455
This is the miracle plant here.

854
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:29,957
It came to me in a dream

855
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:32,727
and it has the ability
to inseminate women.

856
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,962
Um, and that is
how it saves the world.

857
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:39,067
Yeah, it kind of kept appearing
in my unconscious mind,

858
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,836
um, over and over
and over again.

859
00:36:44,172 --> 00:36:46,107
Hey, now. I was just looking.

860
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,842
Looked like you were touching.

861
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:50,545
- Is this it?
- Maybe.

862
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:55,215
-How do I know it's even real?
-That's none of your business.

863
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,317
If this is gonna
save our species,

864
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:59,386
I think it falls
under the purview

865
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,189
of something I'd like to know.

866
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,458
This is it.

867
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:07,528
- How's it work?
- Don't.

868
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:09,630
It's genetics are malleable.

869
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:11,532
What does that mean?

870
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,901
It's double helix
adapts to different species.

871
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:16,804
Um, this is a moment
of discovery for Russ,

872
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:18,773
you know,
as well as the audience.

873
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:20,608
- Yeah.
- And I just want to make sure

874
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:23,243
that we're all clear
on the scientific language.

875
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:24,779
The thing
that's amazing about it

876
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:27,014
is that it's actually
all really possible.

877
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:28,415
- It is?
- Yeah.

878
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:30,852
In theory. Uh, let's shoot.

879
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:32,352
Oh, okay, um, it's-- no.

880
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:33,955
It's not possible,
just so you know.

881
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,388
It's not a thing.

882
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:36,858
I made
some breakthroughs with plants,

883
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:38,960
cross pollinations that,
in other circumstances,

884
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:40,194
would never hybridize.

885
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:41,662
Then with rats.

886
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:43,296
I had some success
with the jellyfish.

887
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,699
I was on the verge of seeing

888
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,366
if it could fertilize
a human egg.

889
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,969
That's when the ash came.

890
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:51,572
-The ash.
-The ash.

891
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,009
But we've been on the run
for about a week now.

892
00:37:55,143 --> 00:37:57,612
It needs some consistent
photosynthetic opportunity

893
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:58,980
in order
to maintain the stability

894
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:00,248
of its genetic structure.

895
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,448
Yeah, sure.

896
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:05,086
Male sperm
would no longer be necessary.

897
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,721
It's fine with me.

898
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:11,424
But how would you even go about
fertilizing a human egg then?

899
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:15,897
Experiments are ongoing.

900
00:38:16,264 --> 00:38:18,132
- Diana.
- Oh, hey.

901
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:20,001
- Hi.
- Hey.

902
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:22,469
- How are you doing?
- Good, good.

903
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,572
- I'm just working.
- Cool.

904
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:28,242
I just have my script analysis
happening right now.

905
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,744
What I'm doing
right now, actually,

906
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:32,947
is I am working
on my animal exercises.

907
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,050
Delta Ray is a scientist,
she's very smart.

908
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:38,519
She is-- she is grounded

909
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:40,387
and-- um, and wise

910
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:43,157
and so for her,
I've chosen a salamander.

911
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:44,725
You know, really what that means

912
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:47,295
is that I observe salamanders
in the wild

913
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:48,863
or watch YouTube videos

914
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:51,132
and I just sort of
go deep on their behavior.

915
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:53,500
- Yeah.
- Neat.

916
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,571
And, you know,
the person who really--

917
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:58,039
really taught me this,

918
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:01,509
um, is my acting teacher,
Rudolph Eichner.

919
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:03,144
He teaches the Eichner technique

920
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:06,948
and I've been studying with Rudy
for about ten years now,

921
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:09,083
so, um, you know,

922
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:10,918
if it wasn't for him, I...

923
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:13,754
I wouldn't be in this place.

924
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:16,324
Geoff, for example,
Geoff is a badger, you know?

925
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:18,226
He's got that energy to him.

926
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:21,128
Because of Rudy,
I can identify quickly,

927
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:22,663
um, what people's animals are.

928
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:24,332
He-- he's not cheap,

929
00:39:24,464 --> 00:39:26,300
but-- uh,
but he is worth every penny

930
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,468
and, you know,
if I have to skimp,

931
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:30,738
um, and pay,
like, cheaper rent--

932
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:33,574
I-- I've moved,
I have moved before

933
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:36,777
because all I wanna do
is-- is afford that class.

934
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:38,546
If you bring people
into the class,

935
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,147
you get a discount.

936
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:42,583
So-- um, so I have
a lot of friends in that class.

937
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,685
Yeah.

938
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:46,988
Anyways, I-- I think
I should get back to studying

939
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:51,726
because we have an early call
and I am behind.

940
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:55,529
Terrible.

941
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:02,837
-Hey.
-Hello.

942
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,072
So word on the street
is you were the voice

943
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:07,742
of in
<i>the Explorer.</i>

944
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,711
-That's the word on the street?
-Oh, no, sorry.

945
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:12,813
-Uh, Izzy told me.
-Izzy told you that?

946
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:14,715
Sorry, sorry,
should she not have?

947
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,052
No, I'm just kidding.
Yeah, that was totally me.

948
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:19,754
Uh, I-- I was.

949
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:21,622
Cool. That's amazing.

950
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:23,157
I've been trying to get
into voice over

951
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,292
if you have any tips.

952
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:26,093
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

953
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,495
There's, like, one golden rule.

954
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:30,831
-One.
-There's one rule. Okay?

955
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:32,900
And it's that the microphone

956
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:35,136
can hear
your facial expressions.

957
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:37,238
Say this line with a frown.

958
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:38,739
-Okay?
-Okay.

959
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:41,309
Um, uh,
"This food is unacceptable."

960
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,977
This food is unacceptable.

961
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,979
Okay, now say it
with, like, a big smile.

962
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,316
This food is unacceptable.

963
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:51,319
Big frown. Bigger. Bigger.
Frown with your cheeks.

964
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,054
Frown with your cheeks more.

965
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:56,924
And now say,
"This food looks terrible."

966
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,327
This food looks terrible.

967
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,696
And now, like, a big smile
and feel the difference.

968
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,197
Feel the difference.

969
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:05,099
Smile with your ears,
like-- like, all--

970
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:07,601
like, lift it all up,
lift it all up,

971
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:10,104
and then say,
"This food is terrible."

972
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,672
This food is terrible.

973
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:12,907
Do you feel the difference?

974
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,442
- Oh, my God.
- Right?

975
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:15,810
It's, like, opposite.

976
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:16,877
'Cause you're changing
your tool.

977
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:17,878
Oh, yeah.

978
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:19,981
First the ash, now acid rain.

979
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:21,782
We're done for.

980
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:25,619
- You're not leaving, are you?
- Diana?

981
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:28,456
-Sorry. Diana.
-Yeah?

982
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,725
I--

983
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,861
You know, Diana, okay, babe,

984
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:35,930
I need you to--
have you ever heard the phrase

985
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:37,732
-"Use your diaphragm"?
-Yes.

986
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:40,067
Okay, I need you to, like,
take your diaphragm,

987
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:41,902
wring it out,
and when you say your lines,

988
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:44,038
like, squeeze
the tension back in,

989
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,107
and say the lines
through your nose

990
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,510
as opposed to just like,
keeping them in your mouth.

991
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:51,112
-Okay, Okay.
-Okay?

992
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:52,980
- It feels trapped.
- It feels trapped.

993
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:54,715
-Let it-- let it out.
-Okay.

994
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:56,017
- You know?
- Okay. Thank you.

995
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,451
-Yes. Yes.
-Okay, cool, cool.

996
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:59,553
Is that-- is that okay, Izzy?

997
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:03,290
I-- I think that maybe,

998
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:05,960
um, that we should do that

999
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:08,729
-at the end of the take.
-Good, yeah.

1000
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:10,398
Me giving notes and stuff?

1001
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:15,069
Yeah, I think it would be good
if we did that at-- at the end.

1002
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:17,071
- Yeah.
- We're rolling right now.

1003
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:19,106
Yeah, yeah, that's a good--
that's a good point.

1004
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,474
That's a good point,
that's smart.

1005
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:21,942
Maybe you could come and...

1006
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:23,544
- Moment.
- ...sit down again.

1007
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:25,012
Yeah, yeah.

1008
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:26,447
Do you have any notes for me?

1009
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,948
Oh, no, no, no.

1010
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:30,284
Devon, you're, like,
you blow everyone away.

1011
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:32,286
You're the best actor here.
All good.

1012
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,188
Okay, all right, cool.

1013
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:35,956
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1014
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:37,892
Awesome, awesome, so...

1015
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:42,063
I just, um--

1016
00:42:42,596 --> 00:42:43,864
What's going on?

1017
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:50,071
- Yeah, hmm.
- I think that maybe, um--

1018
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:51,872
I think that maybe,
we should go again.

1019
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:54,442
We're going again.
Is anybody listening to me?

1020
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:55,544
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

1021
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:57,144
And action!

1022
00:42:57,278 --> 00:43:00,981
Hot nurse. Hot nurse.

1023
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,616
So, that means quiet, everybody.

1024
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:05,352
<i>It's not easy being the leader.</i>

1025
00:43:05,486 --> 00:43:06,821
<i>I think I could have maybe</i>

1026
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:08,055
<i>done a little bit</i>
<i>of a better job</i>

1027
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,924
<i>communicating with my team.</i>

1028
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:13,360
<i>I need to rally,</i>
<i>and get people back on board.</i>

1029
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:14,762
<i>I'm gonna pull it together.</i>

1030
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:16,297
<i>Everything is great.</i>

1031
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,865
<i>People are feeling</i>
<i>so good on set,</i>

1032
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:19,600
<i>really believing</i>
<i>in the material.</i>

1033
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:20,935
<i>I'm not worried.</i>

1034
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:22,803
<i>I'm not worried at all.</i>

1035
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:18,259
Hey, Iz?

1036
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:19,960
Yeah?

1037
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:21,896
In my pants?

1038
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:24,331
I don't understand why I would.

1039
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, it's about
the genetic structure

1040
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:27,968
- of the leaves.
- No, I get it.

1041
00:44:28,102 --> 00:44:29,604
- You know, it's like--
- Can you just-- can you--

1042
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,641
But did you put this one
in your pants already?

1043
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,113
Um...

1044
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:43,317
how-- how much
do you want me to enjoy this?

1045
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,621
Um, well, um...

1046
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:48,956
I think it's--
I think it's an erotic scene.

1047
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:50,191
-You know?
-Sure.

1048
00:44:53,662 --> 00:44:55,162
-I don't...
-Right.

1049
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:56,964
- ...do this, and so I--
- Right, right, okay, so--

1050
00:44:57,498 --> 00:45:00,267
Like, I just need
a little bit of direction here.

1051
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:02,403
-Breathing is always good.
-Like, teeth...

1052
00:45:03,037 --> 00:45:04,171
-bared?
-Mmm.

1053
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,006
-Teeth is never...
-I don't know, I just sometime--

1054
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,542
-...really that great.
-Okay.

1055
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:09,176
-No teeth.
-Um, maybe, like...

1056
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,145
-play, like, cup on that area.
-Okay, yeah, yeah.

1057
00:45:17,418 --> 00:45:19,853
Devon, you feeling good?

1058
00:45:20,454 --> 00:45:23,558
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, from the top.

1059
00:45:23,692 --> 00:45:25,259
So that's
your first mark.

1060
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,728
Okay.

1061
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:30,898
Did you get all this stuff?

1062
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:32,266
Did you see
the smiley face cake?

1063
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,068
Oh, it's fantastic,
and by the way,

1064
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:37,438
thank you so much
for supporting this project.

1065
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:41,242
It's a really exciting film
to be a part of.

1066
00:45:42,776 --> 00:45:43,811
Oh, no.

1067
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:45,412
All right, sweet or savory?

1068
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:46,780
Bagel?

1069
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,784
-Hey, your tummy talking to you?
-I'm good, man.

1070
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,219
You should try one of these,

1071
00:45:52,353 --> 00:45:53,754
try one of these,
try one of these.

1072
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:56,056
If you want more,
I'll have more.

1073
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,559
I'll have more of this.

1074
00:45:58,292 --> 00:46:01,395
I'm not trying to be dense,
but I'm-- I'm totally confused.

1075
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:04,298
- So this plant makes babies?
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1076
00:46:04,733 --> 00:46:06,233
It allows people to make babies.

1077
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:09,036
Okay, but so when
it makes babies, are they, like,

1078
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:10,437
cute, soft babies

1079
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:11,772
or do they have,
like, hard bark skin?

1080
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:13,173
I didn't prep that, Devon.

1081
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:15,610
You guys, I'm pretty sure

1082
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:17,945
Izzy googled all of this.

1083
00:46:18,078 --> 00:46:19,581
Because I was thinking
we could just, you know,

1084
00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:21,015
change our lines ourselves

1085
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:22,916
into something
that maybe made sense.

1086
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,519
It's all gibberish anyway.

1087
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:29,823
<i>It's come to my attention...</i>

1088
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:33,561
<i>that people in this cast,</i>

1089
00:46:33,695 --> 00:46:36,096
<i>um, want to change their lines.</i>

1090
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,499
<i>They want to rewrite the script.</i>

1091
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,234
<i>They want to go back,</i>
<i>and change things</i>

1092
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:42,236
<i>even though</i>
<i>we're already behind,</i>

1093
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:45,607
<i>because I'm not a machine,</i>
<i>and I can't come up with ideas,</i>

1094
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,041
<i>like, constantly.</i>

1095
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:48,510
<i>If they didn't like it</i>

1096
00:46:48,643 --> 00:46:49,943
<i>then they</i>
<i>shouldn't have signed on</i>

1097
00:46:50,077 --> 00:46:51,445
<i>is how I feel, but maybe...</i>

1098
00:46:58,185 --> 00:47:01,255
<i>maybe I'm not built...</i>

1099
00:47:02,691 --> 00:47:03,957
<i>for this.</i>

1100
00:47:51,806 --> 00:47:54,843
So Geoff, when you put
your hands like this,

1101
00:47:54,975 --> 00:47:56,611
it blocks the shot.

1102
00:47:57,411 --> 00:47:59,179
Okay, so what-- what--
what would Russ do

1103
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:00,515
with his hands in the scene?

1104
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:01,882
Put them in your pockets.

1105
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:03,283
-Okay, I'll try that.
-Okay.

1106
00:48:03,651 --> 00:48:05,252
It's, like,
not usually this bad.

1107
00:48:05,386 --> 00:48:07,287
-Um, so--
-Hmm, it's a lot of takes.

1108
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:09,289
So let's just go again,
and action!

1109
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:22,302
Geoff, it took me eight years
to write this,

1110
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:25,105
and I would have specifically
written "gun..."

1111
00:48:25,673 --> 00:48:27,474
- if a gun was supposed--
- I just thought maybe,

1112
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:28,877
like, if there's

1113
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,477
-like, marauders and--
-Please, let's--

1114
00:48:30,612 --> 00:48:35,015
let's start again.

1115
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:37,184
- <i>Sabroso.</i>
- Oh, it's <i>"sabroso."</i>

1116
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:38,853
- <i>Sabroso.</i>
<i>- Sabroso,</i>

1117
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:40,320
-it's not what I said?
<i>-Sabroso.</i>

1118
00:48:40,454 --> 00:48:42,122
- <i>Sabroso.</i>
<i>- Sabroso.</i>

1119
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:43,924
- Listen to him. Yes.
- Like I said.

1120
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:45,058
Not like you said it.

1121
00:48:47,762 --> 00:48:49,798
- Okay, sorry.
<i>- Sabroso.</i>

1122
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,666
<i>Sabroso.</i>

1123
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,269
<i>- Sabroso, sabroso, sabr--</i>
- Like that.

1124
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:57,304
-Do it more like that.
-It's okay, you got it.

1125
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:58,773
No, it's okay.

1126
00:48:58,907 --> 00:49:00,274
Why is he giving my actor notes?

1127
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:02,109
-I have no idea.
-Why is he giving my actor--

1128
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:03,611
-I'll talk to him.
-I thought you talked to him.

1129
00:49:03,745 --> 00:49:05,513
I talked to him already.
I'll talk to him again.

1130
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:07,481
I thought he retained it.
I thought he retained it.

1131
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:09,216
I thought-- I didn't know.
I told him not to and he did.

1132
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,984
-Why aren't you doing your job?
-I'm so sorry.

1133
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,620
-I'm trying to do my job, but--
-I just think that I need--

1134
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:15,757
No, Iz, Iz, I'm sorry.
Izzy, I'm sorry.

1135
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,391
I think that I need...

1136
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:19,661
-10 minutes.
-No, no, Izzy,

1137
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:21,061
we don't have 10.

1138
00:49:21,195 --> 00:49:22,597
We're already
a whole day behind.

1139
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,101
Are you-- did you get--

1140
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:29,604
-Just--
-Izzy.

1141
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:38,979
This is really hard.

1142
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,453
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what I'm doing.

1143
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:48,121
Is this stupid?

1144
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:52,894
Where's Izzy?

1145
00:49:53,026 --> 00:49:54,261
Uh, she's taking--
taking a fi-- taking a break.

1146
00:49:54,394 --> 00:49:55,697
She's just looking at--

1147
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:57,498
she's looking at something else,

1148
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:58,499
-checking out something out.
-Must be nice.

1149
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:02,369
Why are they so bad?

1150
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:10,578
Why are you still filming me?

1151
00:50:10,712 --> 00:50:12,814
- You told me to!
- Stop it!

1152
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:14,214
Okay.

1153
00:50:14,983 --> 00:50:16,250
Jeez.

1154
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:05,533
You're not leaving, are you?

1155
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:07,501
No, okay.

1156
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:09,604
You're not leaving, are you?

1157
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:14,207
You're not leaving, are you?

1158
00:51:22,717 --> 00:51:25,887
Hey.
How'd you find me here?

1159
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:29,456
-Beeper.
-Oh, yeah, right.

1160
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:33,928
You gotta move
more product, Geoff.

1161
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:38,533
Listen, I have been
talking it up to everybody

1162
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:39,968
-in this cast and crew...
-Uh-huh.

1163
00:51:40,602 --> 00:51:42,135
...but nobody's biting, Jack.

1164
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:44,338
Don't call me by my name.
What did I say?

1165
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:46,473
- Trevor.
- Trevor.

1166
00:51:47,075 --> 00:51:48,776
- Trevor.
- Show me.

1167
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,177
Ah...

1168
00:51:51,045 --> 00:51:52,547
-You see--
-Open it.

1169
00:51:53,313 --> 00:51:54,582
I'll do better.

1170
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,250
Oh, my God.

1171
00:51:57,384 --> 00:51:59,186
We were counting on you.

1172
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:02,289
We let you into the family.

1173
00:52:02,422 --> 00:52:04,959
We're committed to you.
If you are not committed to us,

1174
00:52:05,093 --> 00:52:06,995
maybe we need to recali...

1175
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:09,162
-No. No.
-...btate.

1176
00:52:11,532 --> 00:52:13,534
They're fucking filming?

1177
00:52:13,968 --> 00:52:15,335
- Yeah, it's a movie.
- Oh, my God!

1178
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:16,804
It's a movie set.

1179
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:18,573
Fucking kill you.

1180
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:22,944
- Ow! Ow!
- Oh, are you scared?

1181
00:52:23,077 --> 00:52:24,779
I'm scared of your failure.

1182
00:52:24,912 --> 00:52:26,514
I just need
to pull this new guy in,

1183
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:28,116
just a little bit,
this guy Felipe?

1184
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,517
You saw him,
long hair, kinda cute.

1185
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:31,085
I haven't pulled
the trigger yet, but--

1186
00:52:31,218 --> 00:52:32,587
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Stand still.

1187
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,187
- No, no.
- God, you're hard to hit.

1188
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:35,288
I think
I can sell them on...

1189
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:36,490
...four...

1190
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:38,092
...twelve units.

1191
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:39,493
I think I can sell them
on 12 units

1192
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:41,194
probably by the end of--

1193
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:43,131
By the end of the--
by the end of the week.

1194
00:52:43,564 --> 00:52:45,733
Um, you know what we say.

1195
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:47,602
Supplements make--

1196
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:50,270
- Better actors.
- Better Believe.

1197
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:51,939
Oh, I do.

1198
00:52:52,073 --> 00:52:54,207
I know you do.
You need to sell product.

1199
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:55,576
-Okay.
-Okay?

1200
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,778
- I'm on it.
- All right then.

1201
00:52:58,012 --> 00:52:59,279
Better Believe.

1202
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:03,851
- Good job.
- Thanks.

1203
00:53:09,057 --> 00:53:10,357
Better believe.

1204
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:18,492
<i>This is, um...</i>

1205
00:54:21,062 --> 00:54:25,365
<i>This is really hard,</i>
<i>and I think that...</i>

1206
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,972
<i>I just need somebody to, like...</i>

1207
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,609
<i>touch me?</i>

1208
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:45,787
<i>That's it.</i>

1209
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:01,636
Hey, Devon?

1210
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:04,972
Do you-- do you get itchy?

1211
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:08,976
- What?
- Well, you know,

1212
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,678
like, my bug bites
are really itchy,

1213
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:13,981
but I know
that, like, asexuals experience,

1214
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:16,349
like, sensation differently.

1215
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:19,020
So I was curious if, like, um...

1216
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,056
like, you're affected
by, like, bugs?

1217
00:55:25,126 --> 00:55:26,393
Um...

1218
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:33,868
Stefan, your room
is way better than mine.

1219
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:45,613
Do you taste
the hints of pineapple?

1220
00:55:45,746 --> 00:55:47,081
Not over these nuts.

1221
00:55:55,156 --> 00:55:56,891
How long is this gonna take?
This is ridiculous.

1222
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:06,234
Where are you?

1223
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,003
Fuck's sake.

1224
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:20,348
Izzy-- hey, what do you think
about Izzy?

1225
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,850
Well...

1226
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:25,119
she's got that attitude.

1227
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:31,092
-Yeah, she's tall.
-Yeah.

1228
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:34,295
I didn't think
she would be that tall.

1229
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:36,429
I didn't think
she'd run that fast.

1230
00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:39,767
In a good way.

1231
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:41,102
You know what I'm saying?

1232
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:42,803
Yeah.

1233
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:44,071
And those bangs?

1234
00:56:45,206 --> 00:56:46,908
-Those bangs?
-Mm-hmm.

1235
00:56:55,783 --> 00:56:57,018
What would he be--

1236
00:56:57,151 --> 00:57:00,187
and what
would he be fertilizing exactly?

1237
00:57:00,321 --> 00:57:02,356
The double helix breaks down

1238
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:05,192
exactly three minutes
after it's been plucked anyways.

1239
00:57:05,326 --> 00:57:08,362
Double helix breaks down
exactly three minutes

1240
00:57:08,495 --> 00:57:10,998
after it's been plucked anyways.

1241
00:57:11,132 --> 00:57:14,835
Well, yes, well,
the genetics are malleable.

1242
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:18,539
And what would he be
fertilizing exactly?

1243
00:57:18,673 --> 00:57:20,207
Oh, Jesus, there--

1244
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,744
Broom.

1245
00:57:24,979 --> 00:57:27,715
If I was a broom,
where would I be?

1246
00:57:30,384 --> 00:57:32,520
I bet Devon has a broom,
I just--

1247
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:35,556
- Oh, my-- oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1248
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,658
Uh, Josh!

1249
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:40,294
Uh, oh, my God, um, sorry.

1250
00:57:40,428 --> 00:57:41,529
- Sorry.
- Gross!

1251
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:42,495
- Get out!
- Okay.

1252
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:03,718
Oh, yeah.

1253
00:58:16,464 --> 00:58:17,832
Hey, pop it open for me?

1254
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:22,870
What happened? What happened?

1255
00:58:24,372 --> 00:58:25,673
You should see the other guy.

1256
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:28,209
Why, what happened
to the other guy?

1257
00:58:28,642 --> 00:58:30,011
Oh.

1258
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:31,846
- Morning, Felipe.
- Good morning.

1259
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:34,248
- Oh, my God, fun straws.
- Thank you.

1260
00:58:34,382 --> 00:58:35,983
-What do you have here?
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1261
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:37,351
-Good morning.
-Hey, everyone in there?

1262
00:58:37,485 --> 00:58:39,086
Uh, yeah, everyone except Diana.

1263
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:41,822
Diana's late?

1264
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:43,557
Yeah, by like,
five or ten minutes.

1265
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:45,926
No.

1266
00:58:47,495 --> 00:58:48,763
Something's off.

1267
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:53,034
Diana!

1268
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:58,105
- Diana!
- Diana!

1269
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,206
Diana!

1270
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,175
Diana!

1271
00:59:01,742 --> 00:59:03,411
Diana!

1272
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:05,079
- Diana!
- Diana!

1273
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:07,481
- Diana!
- Diana!

1274
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:09,116
- Diana!
- Diana!

1275
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,520
- Okay, there she is.
- Diana-- oh, my God!

1276
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:12,920
- She's there.
- There she is.

1277
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:14,523
- Diana!
- Diana!

1278
00:59:14,655 --> 00:59:16,223
She's fine.
Okay, so we found her.

1279
00:59:16,357 --> 00:59:18,125
- Izzy! Come on.
- Diana!

1280
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:20,561
- Izzy!
- Diana.

1281
00:59:20,694 --> 00:59:22,496
- There you are.
- Let's go, Diana,

1282
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:23,898
let's go!

1283
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:25,933
Hi! Hi!

1284
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:27,568
Welcome back.
Welcome home, let's go!

1285
00:59:27,701 --> 00:59:29,336
There you are, hi.

1286
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:31,272
- I'm fine.
- Diana.

1287
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:32,807
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- She's not dead.

1288
00:59:33,174 --> 00:59:35,576
- Shocking.
- Why? What's wrong?

1289
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,812
- Listen, I just--
- Um, you had

1290
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:39,346
- something to say, right?
- I just wanted to--

1291
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,881
It didn't really mean anything.

1292
00:59:41,015 --> 00:59:42,683
That's not what you-- okay.

1293
00:59:42,817 --> 00:59:44,185
You can go to work now.

1294
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:46,887
What I did wasn't
the right thing to do.

1295
00:59:47,488 --> 00:59:50,658
And I want-- you know, you--
I won't do it again.

1296
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:53,360
I won't, but I just, um--

1297
00:59:54,028 --> 00:59:56,197
do you still
want to be in the movie?

1298
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:58,533
Yeah, Izzy, I'm in the movie.

1299
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:00,434
I signed a contract.

1300
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:02,803
When I commit to something,
I commit,

1301
01:00:02,937 --> 01:00:05,673
and I don't break
my promises, so...

1302
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:07,374
don't worry about me.

1303
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:20,654
I just wanted
to make a good movie.

1304
01:00:20,788 --> 01:00:22,723
It's been a really long time

1305
01:00:22,857 --> 01:00:24,358
since I've been with anybody.

1306
01:00:24,492 --> 01:00:26,727
I'm an idiot, and I'm sorry.

1307
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:28,563
I'm sorry, okay?

1308
01:00:28,696 --> 01:00:29,930
I just want to apologize

1309
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:31,533
to everybody
involved in this shoot.

1310
01:00:31,665 --> 01:00:33,067
I crossed a line

1311
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,503
that was very clearly
drawn in the sand by me,

1312
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:38,038
and, um,
the-- the local government.

1313
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:41,108
This whole project
is to build community

1314
01:00:41,242 --> 01:00:42,943
for the greater good,
for the herd--

1315
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:44,445
- We get it.
- As a unit--

1316
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,147
-Yes, okay, great.
-Yeah.

1317
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,315
My behavior was just to--
was totally unacceptable.

1318
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:49,917
To rectify that,

1319
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,886
this morning, I went
to get a test at 6:00 a.m.

1320
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:53,787
I will have the results

1321
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:55,557
in the next couple of days,

1322
01:00:55,689 --> 01:00:58,560
and if I have your consent,
it would be my honor to continue

1323
01:00:58,692 --> 01:00:59,927
to tell this story

1324
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,328
- with you all.
- Love that.

1325
01:01:01,462 --> 01:01:03,230
Tell the story.
Everybody cool? Yeah?

1326
01:01:03,364 --> 01:01:04,599
Okay, Matt, I just don't want
to rush anybody, okay?

1327
01:01:04,732 --> 01:01:06,167
So let's all just take a moment.

1328
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:14,675
Yeah, um, it's--
it's cool with me.

1329
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:16,744
Oh, yeah, shocker.

1330
01:01:17,646 --> 01:01:20,649
Okay, we're all gonna die
one way or another, so...

1331
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:22,449
Speak for yourself, Dev.

1332
01:01:23,117 --> 01:01:24,952
What
does that even mean?

1333
01:01:25,085 --> 01:01:26,420
Great, so it sounds
like we're all agreed, right?

1334
01:01:26,555 --> 01:01:28,923
-Let's go.
-Um, uh, Di,

1335
01:01:29,056 --> 01:01:31,192
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I didn't-- I didn't hear you.

1336
01:01:31,593 --> 01:01:32,661
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1337
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:34,929
I'm-- it's fine. Whatever.

1338
01:01:35,062 --> 01:01:36,363
Whatever,
I'll take it. Cool!

1339
01:01:36,497 --> 01:01:37,932
Let's get the shot!

1340
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:41,068
- No, no.
- Great.

1341
01:01:41,202 --> 01:01:42,369
-Thank you everybody.
-Damnit, Matt,

1342
01:01:42,503 --> 01:01:44,004
for the millionth time

1343
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:46,473
I can't shoot if I don't know
what I'm shooting!

1344
01:01:47,174 --> 01:01:48,742
You got these in here, right?

1345
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:50,612
We'll--
we'll figure it out, Alec,

1346
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:52,046
don't worry.

1347
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,248
You're doing great.

1348
01:01:54,982 --> 01:01:56,283
Oh, thanks.

1349
01:01:57,751 --> 01:01:59,019
Oh, that's--

1350
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:01,455
that's really nice.

1351
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,658
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I--

1352
01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:06,160
Maybe not touch me here.
Thank you.

1353
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:08,128
We'll just-- we'll do that--
we'll do that later...

1354
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:09,897
-Yeah, uh--
-...um...

1355
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:12,266
...potentially. Okay.

1356
01:02:14,168 --> 01:02:15,236
Okay.

1357
01:02:16,503 --> 01:02:17,672
Okay.

1358
01:02:17,805 --> 01:02:19,807
Okay. Yeah.

1359
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:21,543
Yes.

1360
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:25,279
Yes. Yes. Do this.

1361
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:33,688
I think this helps?

1362
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:35,222
Yeah,
it really opens you up,

1363
01:02:35,356 --> 01:02:36,390
- just a little more forward.
- Okay.

1364
01:02:36,524 --> 01:02:37,925
Oh.

1365
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:39,661
Geoff,
how did you and Izzy meet?

1366
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:41,795
At a gas station
and, uh, she was having

1367
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:45,634
some trouble pumping her gas,
so I helped her

1368
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:46,834
pump it.

1369
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:48,068
-Yo, Matt.
-Yeah, man?

1370
01:02:48,637 --> 01:02:51,205
Apparently Izzy's been
helping Geoff pump his gas.

1371
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:53,240
- Out and about.
- Yeah.

1372
01:02:53,374 --> 01:02:56,477
-Iz, I'm ready.
-Everybody on your marks please.

1373
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:58,879
Thank you.

1374
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:00,914
-That actually does help.
-Anytime.

1375
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:02,283
Are we ready?

1376
01:03:02,883 --> 01:03:04,285
Yeah, yeah, ev--

1377
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:07,388
Guys-- guys,
on your first marks.

1378
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:14,261
I wouldn't make
heads or tails of it anyway.

1379
01:03:15,563 --> 01:03:16,997
I guess that's true.

1380
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:20,568
But it tells a bad story, huh?

1381
01:03:21,603 --> 01:03:22,870
How could you tell?

1382
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:27,709
I just know things, sometimes.

1383
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:30,244
I wish I could say the same.

1384
01:03:30,612 --> 01:03:32,246
But you're the smartest woman--

1385
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:37,519
smartest person we got.

1386
01:03:39,688 --> 01:03:41,121
I'm scared.

1387
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:43,090
About what?

1388
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,858
Our species.

1389
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,896
No, something more.

1390
01:03:49,664 --> 01:03:50,931
What?

1391
01:03:52,399 --> 01:03:53,467
You tell me.

1392
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:56,738
I really need this to work...

1393
01:03:57,471 --> 01:03:59,273
but experiments
don't always pan out,

1394
01:03:59,406 --> 01:04:01,108
but I need this to succeed.

1395
01:04:01,241 --> 01:04:03,043
We need you to succeed.

1396
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:04,878
It's a lot of pressure.

1397
01:04:10,084 --> 01:04:11,385
Do you want to hug?

1398
01:04:12,587 --> 01:04:13,854
A hug?

1399
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:17,157
It's sure been a while.

1400
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,327
Yeah.

1401
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:22,597
Let's try.

1402
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:33,608
What is happening?

1403
01:04:35,976 --> 01:04:37,244
Um,

1404
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:39,313
uh, yeah, let's cut.

1405
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:41,048
- Okay, I think what I--
- I'm so sorry, Diana.

1406
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:43,016
That's okay.
Just-- can you just step back?

1407
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,418
Are you okay? Is your--

1408
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:46,053
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.
- Okay.

1409
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:47,589
What I would love
for you to do is,

1410
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:50,090
um, you know,
it's, like, human and intimate.

1411
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:51,492
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

1412
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:54,294
-Right?
-Yeah, yeah.

1413
01:04:54,428 --> 01:04:55,295
I mean...

1414
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:58,833
it-- the script says
"Spread your wings like a bird."

1415
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,968
Arms like a bird's wing.

1416
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:03,070
Um, that was poetic.

1417
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:04,706
We're hugging,
though you don't need to squat.

1418
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:06,140
-You can just stand up.
-But she's shorter than me.

1419
01:05:06,273 --> 01:05:07,876
So we're hugging like a normal--

1420
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:09,744
normal-- normal people.

1421
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:12,045
Embrace her like somebody
that you love, yeah?

1422
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:13,447
Wait, now, I already love her?

1423
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:14,783
Just hug her

1424
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:17,151
like we just did, normally.

1425
01:05:17,852 --> 01:05:20,421
I mean, I respect the script,
but I'll try.

1426
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:23,257
And action!

1427
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:29,564
-I'm sorry.
-Cut!

1428
01:05:29,697 --> 01:05:31,331
I can't take this.
I can't, honestly.

1429
01:05:31,465 --> 01:05:33,635
Can I-- can I-- can I try
something please?

1430
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:34,903
-Please.
-Yeah?

1431
01:05:35,035 --> 01:05:36,370
Um, Geoff.

1432
01:05:37,204 --> 01:05:40,441
So good, I'm gonna have you...

1433
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:42,309
take a big step to the left.

1434
01:05:42,443 --> 01:05:44,178
Two more steps. Keep going.

1435
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:46,346
Just keep-- keep going until--

1436
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,715
There's a light
over here.

1437
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,082
Okay. Amazing.

1438
01:05:49,216 --> 01:05:52,720
Um, Diana,
just go with me, okay?

1439
01:05:53,655 --> 01:05:55,155
One more step over here.

1440
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,724
- Won't just be the shot?
- I think it's okay.

1441
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:59,092
-I think-- I think--
-I think it looks great.

1442
01:05:59,226 --> 01:06:00,695
- Yeah?
- You sure, Izzy?

1443
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:02,162
I think it's really good.
I think we should shoot.

1444
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,264
- Okay.
- And action!

1445
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:06,734
Stefan, clear the shot.

1446
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,375
What are the numbers
telling you?

1447
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:18,245
It's not good.

1448
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:25,185
-Was it me?
-No, no.

1449
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:27,555
Pruning it
actually encourages growth.

1450
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:31,291
You know, I thought
you were angry with me.

1451
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:33,628
I was.

1452
01:06:40,969 --> 01:06:42,236
Do you forgive me?

1453
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,377
Uh, um...

1454
01:06:51,513 --> 01:06:53,146
I, uh...

1455
01:06:54,983 --> 01:06:58,285
oh. Ah, uh...

1456
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:01,154
this isn't in the script, is it?

1457
01:07:01,288 --> 01:07:02,557
Just go with it?

1458
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,125
Uh, yeah,
I think give it a shot.

1459
01:07:06,961 --> 01:07:09,564
Okay, um...

1460
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,107
Are you scared?

1461
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:23,343
A little.

1462
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:54,976
Um,

1463
01:07:55,108 --> 01:07:58,813
and cut!

1464
01:08:06,988 --> 01:08:10,558
Okay. And cut.

1465
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:19,132
Di, how did you feel about that?

1466
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:22,235
Yeah, I-- I think the work was--

1467
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:23,938
was good in that one.

1468
01:08:24,072 --> 01:08:26,040
Okay, great, um, Devon?

1469
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:27,474
Yeah.

1470
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:29,711
That was fine.

1471
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:31,211
Am I-- am I not
in this scene anymore?

1472
01:08:31,345 --> 01:08:32,981
I just really don't want,

1473
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:36,551
uh, the point of the film
to be about female sexuality.

1474
01:08:36,684 --> 01:08:39,020
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
I think it works.

1475
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:40,788
It's just, like, the climactic
moment of the movie.

1476
01:08:40,922 --> 01:08:44,592
Yeah, and that felt
pretty climactic to me.

1477
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:48,096
-Yeah...
-I mean...

1478
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:51,599
Aren't you--
I mean, aren't-- aren't you...

1479
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:54,769
- What?
- You know, an asexual?

1480
01:08:54,902 --> 01:08:56,269
Oh, Jesus.

1481
01:08:57,371 --> 01:08:58,640
It's called acting.

1482
01:08:59,172 --> 01:09:00,240
Right, yeah.

1483
01:09:10,051 --> 01:09:11,753
Okay, I was gonna
practice a little bit more,

1484
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:13,755
but okay,
I guess we can do it now.

1485
01:09:13,888 --> 01:09:15,188
I need a second, okay?

1486
01:09:18,126 --> 01:09:19,694
Okay, I'm ready.

1487
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:21,996
This was a really
beautiful experience.

1488
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,831
I'm so grateful
for the community

1489
01:09:23,965 --> 01:09:26,299
that we built in this film.

1490
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:30,038
Everybody came together
in unison,

1491
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,572
and together,

1492
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:34,876
we told a really beautiful story

1493
01:09:35,009 --> 01:09:36,309
about the world,

1494
01:09:36,443 --> 01:09:39,346
and I think
that, uh, we succeeded.

1495
01:09:39,714 --> 01:09:43,651
And gratitude
is really the main--

1496
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:46,120
Oh, shooting was fantastic.

1497
01:09:46,253 --> 01:09:47,789
I mean, specifically for me.

1498
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:49,891
I think it's because,
thematically, this film hits

1499
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:51,726
on so many things
that are really important to me,

1500
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:54,662
like, in particular,
plant-based healing.

1501
01:09:54,796 --> 01:09:56,898
- You really ought to try one.
- What's in it?

1502
01:09:57,031 --> 01:09:58,599
Look,

1503
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:00,367
just take one first,
'cause I want to see

1504
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,836
how it makes you feel.

1505
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:03,971
Felipe just had one.
He's doing great.

1506
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:05,840
Oh, baby. Hold me.

1507
01:10:06,339 --> 01:10:07,608
Hold me with your branches.

1508
01:10:07,742 --> 01:10:09,811
Photosynthesize me,
make me green.

1509
01:10:09,944 --> 01:10:12,814
Give me your sap.
Give me your sap.

1510
01:10:14,281 --> 01:10:15,550
No, I'm good.

1511
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,417
Your loss, man.

1512
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:22,289
Did-- didn't you
just take one of those?

1513
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:23,958
Did I?

1514
01:10:24,357 --> 01:10:25,827
- Yes.
- Shit.

1515
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:30,297
So the film, um,

1516
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,799
do you think
it's going anywhere?

1517
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:34,602
Do you think
Izzy has a future with it or...

1518
01:10:34,736 --> 01:10:38,773
Whoa, the-- the future.
What is your future?

1519
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:40,440
What is my future?

1520
01:10:41,075 --> 01:10:43,778
We don't know
the nature of things.

1521
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:44,979
We just know that...

1522
01:10:46,013 --> 01:10:47,380
she has a thing.

1523
01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:48,783
You know, it's--
it's not everybody's thing,

1524
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,017
but it's her thing,

1525
01:10:50,151 --> 01:10:53,286
and she's good at that thing.

1526
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,924
And so, I think she will be
known for that,

1527
01:10:57,058 --> 01:10:59,493
and, uh, that's...

1528
01:11:01,863 --> 01:11:03,631
You're gonna edit this, right?

1529
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,268
When do you think
that thing's gonna burn out?

1530
01:11:10,505 --> 01:11:11,773
The sun?

1531
01:11:12,305 --> 01:11:14,675
I think we've got some time.

1532
01:11:16,978 --> 01:11:18,278
Cool.

1533
01:11:19,647 --> 01:11:21,983
Hey, so are you happy
with the footage?

1534
01:11:22,116 --> 01:11:24,619
Yeah? Am I happy?

1535
01:11:25,653 --> 01:11:27,755
That's an excellent question.

1536
01:11:28,156 --> 01:11:29,624
Is anybody happy?

1537
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:32,425
Hey, Devon, are you happy?

1538
01:11:33,561 --> 01:11:35,096
What?

1539
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:36,864
Well, just get that thing
out of my face, okay?

1540
01:11:36,998 --> 01:11:39,133
All right,
I'll-- I'll try you later.

1541
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:41,068
Yeah, uh, Izzy's
a fucking genius,

1542
01:11:41,202 --> 01:11:42,469
uh, her ideas are killer,

1543
01:11:42,603 --> 01:11:43,971
and working with her
has been dope.

1544
01:11:44,105 --> 01:11:45,173
Is that what you need?

1545
01:11:45,606 --> 01:11:47,575
You didn't--
you didn't sign the waiver.

1546
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:49,544
Hey, Devon,

1547
01:11:49,677 --> 01:11:52,445
can-- uh, can I
interview you next, actually?

1548
01:11:54,682 --> 01:11:56,117
If you can find me.

1549
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,519
- So cool.
- So cool.

1550
01:11:58,653 --> 01:12:00,221
- Who does that?
- I don't know.

1551
01:12:00,353 --> 01:12:01,989
Um...

1552
01:12:02,757 --> 01:12:06,393
- oh, I-- I--
- Go ahead.

1553
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:09,730
You know, I found
parts of myself I didn't--

1554
01:12:09,864 --> 01:12:12,365
I knew were there,
but I didn't--

1555
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:15,335
I didn't really--
I didn't really know

1556
01:12:15,468 --> 01:12:17,805
like that, you know?

1557
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:21,042
So-- sorry, I'm just--

1558
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:23,476
- Okay, so we're-- I'm done?
- We're good. We got it.

1559
01:12:23,611 --> 01:12:24,846
Okay, cool, I'm just gonna--

1560
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:26,379
I gotta go, um--

1561
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:28,448
I gotta-- I lost my cell phone,

1562
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:30,618
so I'm just gonna--
I'm gonna go find it,

1563
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:32,452
and, uh, I'll see you later.

1564
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:34,021
- All right. Cool.
- Thanks so much.

1565
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:35,323
Great-- great

1566
01:12:35,455 --> 01:12:36,591
-working with you, Di.
-Yeah.

1567
01:12:36,724 --> 01:12:37,959
- Cool.
- Yeah.

1568
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:39,426
God,
where is my cell phone?

1569
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,797
It's-- I don't see it. So weird.

1570
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:50,104
Good, I--

1571
01:12:51,138 --> 01:12:54,108
I'm-- I'm really scared
she's not gonna come.

1572
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:55,442
No, it's okay.

1573
01:12:55,576 --> 01:12:56,577
Does the back of my head
look okay?

1574
01:12:56,711 --> 01:12:57,678
I really like this shirt.

1575
01:12:57,812 --> 01:12:59,647
It looks good, right?

1576
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:02,350
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

1577
01:13:03,084 --> 01:13:05,519
Are you okay?

1578
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:11,491
Okay. I can do this.

1579
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:13,127
We can do this.

1580
01:13:13,828 --> 01:13:14,896
Josh.

1581
01:13:15,428 --> 01:13:16,463
You're gonna
be there with me, right?

1582
01:13:25,273 --> 01:13:26,473
You can be proud of yourself.

1583
01:13:26,607 --> 01:13:28,709
Okay, okay, okay.

1584
01:13:28,843 --> 01:13:30,544
<i>All right, all right, all right,</i>
<i>we at the movies, y'all.</i>

1585
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:32,713
<i>Who's all in--</i>
<i>Okay, first place.</i>

1586
01:13:32,847 --> 01:13:34,715
<i>What's up, daddy?</i>
<i>Hey, good to see.</i>

1587
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:36,416
<i>We're at the movies, y'all,</i>
<i>this is the premiere.</i>

1588
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:38,085
<i>Premiere night,</i>

1589
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:39,987

1590
01:13:40,121 --> 01:13:41,689
<i>Let's get in the chat.</i>
<i>Let's get in the chat.</i>

1591
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:43,190
Who's all in the chat?
Come on, pour in.

1592
01:13:43,324 --> 01:13:44,992
Who's on the chat?
Oh, it's Devon, y'all!

1593
01:13:45,126 --> 01:13:46,827
Everybody drop some love
for Devon in the comments.

1594
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:48,262
Some hearts. Devon, what's up?

1595
01:13:48,396 --> 01:13:49,764
Let's say hi to everybody.

1596
01:13:49,897 --> 01:13:51,431
<i>Matt, there's, like,</i>
<i>two people here.</i>

1597
01:13:51,565 --> 01:13:52,600
Oh, my God,
there are people here.

1598
01:13:52,733 --> 01:13:54,201
Hi, hi, hi!

1599
01:13:54,335 --> 01:13:56,003
- Oh, God. Hi, hi.
- That's the director

1600
01:13:56,137 --> 01:13:57,405
Hey, y'all this is
the director, Izzy, right here.

1601
01:13:57,538 --> 01:13:58,606
-Hi!
-Izzy, we're live.

1602
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:00,007
-My hair.
-Yeah.

1603
01:14:00,141 --> 01:14:01,108
-We're live?
-We're live right now.

1604
01:14:01,242 --> 01:14:02,777
Oh, my God.

1605
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,245
Yeah, you're getting
everybody, right? Okay, good.

1606
01:14:04,378 --> 01:14:05,379
- Hi, Devon.
- Hey.

1607
01:14:05,513 --> 01:14:06,547
-Hi.
-How are you?

1608
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:07,882
It's so good to see you. Hi.

1609
01:14:08,015 --> 01:14:09,216
Hi.

1610
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:10,751
You came all the way out here.

1611
01:14:10,885 --> 01:14:12,920
-Thank you.
-Well, you bought me a flight.

1612
01:14:13,888 --> 01:14:16,023
-Hi.
-Hey, did you get my text?

1613
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:17,425
Which one?
Listen, I don't--

1614
01:14:17,558 --> 01:14:18,659
-Sorry--
-Good to see you.

1615
01:14:18,793 --> 01:14:20,661
-Sorry. Oh, my-- hi!
-Hi.

1616
01:14:20,795 --> 01:14:22,730
Geoff, are you--
are you okay?

1617
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:23,898
I'm just kicking the vitamins.

1618
01:14:24,031 --> 01:14:26,200
I'm fine, thanks to Felipe.

1619
01:14:26,334 --> 01:14:27,802
-Oh.
-Yeah, yeah.

1620
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:29,804
I bought his supply
and we're weaning him off.

1621
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:31,539
<i>Hey, real quick, do you always</i>
<i>dress like a cowboy?</i>

1622
01:14:31,672 --> 01:14:33,174
<i>Baby, say hi.</i>
<i>Say hi to the world.</i>

1623
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:33,774
<i>-Hey, hey. I'm Geoff.</i>
<i>-I know who you--</i>

1624
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:36,077
Hey, Alec.

1625
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,878
- Hi!
- Hi.

1626
01:14:38,646 --> 01:14:40,648
Oh, my God, Diana.

1627
01:14:41,248 --> 01:14:42,950
-Hi. Hi.
-Hey, everyone.

1628
01:14:43,084 --> 01:14:45,319
- Hi. So good to see you.
- Hi.

1629
01:14:45,453 --> 01:14:46,420
-Hi.
-What's up?

1630
01:14:46,554 --> 01:14:47,722
Um...

1631
01:14:48,055 --> 01:14:49,790
I'm so excited
everyone's here.

1632
01:14:49,924 --> 01:14:52,660
I'm so happy you're--
I'm-- I'm so happy you're here.

1633
01:14:52,793 --> 01:14:54,261
Totally. Congratulations.

1634
01:14:54,395 --> 01:14:56,230
Thank you, I-- I didn't know
you were gonna come.

1635
01:14:56,364 --> 01:14:57,765
Yeah, of course.

1636
01:14:57,898 --> 01:15:00,768
- Hey, Devon, how's it going?
- Hey.

1637
01:15:00,901 --> 01:15:02,403
-Good. How are you?
-I'm so happy to see you.

1638
01:15:02,536 --> 01:15:04,605
I didn't-- I didn't know
that you were gonna come in.

1639
01:15:04,739 --> 01:15:06,107
-Where are you, uh--
-I'm just gonna give

1640
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,508
a little speech, guys.

1641
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:09,510
Nothing crazy,
I just wanted to say

1642
01:15:09,643 --> 01:15:13,814
that, um, I'm so happy
that you're here.

1643
01:15:13,948 --> 01:15:16,484
It's wonderful to see
all of your beautiful faces.

1644
01:15:16,617 --> 01:15:19,186
We did
really strong work together

1645
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,721
that I'm very proud of,

1646
01:15:20,855 --> 01:15:23,958
and I just really wanted
you all to know that.

1647
01:15:24,091 --> 01:15:25,426
I'll stop talking.

1648
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:26,927
Um, but yay!

1649
01:15:27,061 --> 01:15:28,496
Good speech, Izzy!

1650
01:15:28,629 --> 01:15:29,864
Good speech.

1651
01:15:29,997 --> 01:15:32,133
-That was great.
-Thanks.

1652
01:15:32,266 --> 01:15:35,603
-You smell really good.
-Oh, thanks.

1653
01:15:35,736 --> 01:15:37,538
It's kind of,
like, off the 101

1654
01:15:37,671 --> 01:15:39,340
-on, uh--
-That's really close--

1655
01:15:39,473 --> 01:15:40,574
The movie's starting now.

1656
01:16:17,311 --> 01:16:18,579
What did you do with it?

1657
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,019
I continued the experiment.

1658
01:16:30,925 --> 01:16:32,159
Are you scared?

1659
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:33,961
A little.

1660
01:17:47,602 --> 01:17:49,236
Hey, congrats, Iz.

1661
01:17:50,738 --> 01:17:52,706
Oh, thanks.

1662
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,442
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you worked hard.

1663
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:58,078
Um...

1664
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:03,817
do you wanna go get a drink?

1665
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:07,087
Yeah.

1666
01:18:07,454 --> 01:18:08,722
Like, now?

1667
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,758
Yeah.

1668
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:12,993
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1669
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:16,297
Okay, uh, just follow me.

1670
01:18:17,331 --> 01:18:18,399
Okay.

1671
01:19:39,313 --> 01:19:41,315
And-- and sort of, like,
why are, you know-- why--

1672
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:43,150
The mound
is where you came from,

1673
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:44,785
-you were both there together.
-That's my line,

1674
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:46,487
-that my line.
-She's part of the AX,

1675
01:19:46,621 --> 01:19:47,888
which used to be ANTIFA.

1676
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:50,424
-Also my line.
-She comes to save you,

1677
01:19:50,558 --> 01:19:52,059
-because you live on the mound--
-No, I got--

1678
01:19:52,192 --> 01:19:54,395
That's where you had your lab,

1679
01:19:54,529 --> 01:19:57,298
but that-- there was
an apocalypse,

1680
01:19:57,431 --> 01:19:59,133
-a second apocalypse.
-Yeah.

1681
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:01,636
It's fictional, guys.
It's science fiction.

1682
01:21:01,995 --> 01:21:03,531
This party sucks.
See y'all later.

1683
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:05,299
Bye, Matt.

1684
01:21:05,734 --> 01:21:07,468
Why did you stop me?
He can talk to Izzy for us.

1685
01:21:07,602 --> 01:21:11,905
Absolutely not.
He is a dumb, dumb person.

1686
01:21:18,345 --> 01:21:19,947
I actually loved that,
I didn't wanna--

1687
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,115
I wasn't gonna break that.

1688
01:21:21,248 --> 01:21:23,283
He is a dumb, dumb person.

1689
01:21:26,286 --> 01:21:28,455
It's not funny. It's not funny.

1690
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:31,291
He's a dumb, dumb person.

1691
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:35,462
She can't do it.

1692
01:22:32,352 --> 01:22:33,621
There she goes.

1693
01:22:33,755 --> 01:22:35,523
Izzy.
Wait, where did Izzy go?

1694
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:37,090
Is she crying?
I think she's crying.

1695
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:38,760
Oh, God.

1696
01:22:38,893 --> 01:22:40,394
- Like, I could--
- Did somebody call me?

1697
01:22:40,528 --> 01:22:41,930
I think we need
Geoff's voice.

1698
01:22:42,062 --> 01:22:44,131
No, hang on.
I'm just trying to--

1699
01:22:44,264 --> 01:22:45,667
I'm confused,
is somebody calling me

1700
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,468
- or were you acting?
- I was acting.

1701
01:22:47,602 --> 01:22:48,803
-No, she was acting.
-I thought it was serious.
