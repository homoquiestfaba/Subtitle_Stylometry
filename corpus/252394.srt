1
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,993
Junior, this is kind of a sentimental moment.

2
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,913
Cold River is where l was born and raised.

3
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,275
Everyone l know is here.

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,670
Got fond memories of this place.

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,229
Fond memories? What are you talking about?

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,710
Everybody hated you. Your father, your wife,

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,348
those horrible neighbours...

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,231
You're right. Let's blow this joint!

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,434
Yah! Whoo-ha!

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,712
When the pressure's on and you're all alone

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,358
Take a little ride into the danger zone

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,393
When the moon is high
And the skies are clear

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,032
Just show me a sign and we'll be outta here

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,954
Take me up on a wing and a prayer...

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,673
Look.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,753
lf you need a friend, you know...
l'll be there

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,269
Hound dogs howlin' all through the night

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,994
Eight miles high and l'm doin' all right

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,673
Better move over
'Cause you're goin' too slow

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,153
l feel the need for freedom
Now it's time to go

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,357
lt's a fine line between pleasure and pain

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,956
Let your conscience be your guide
Till we meet again

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,755
Your time has come
You can stand or you can run

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,072
But don't keep it all inside

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,197
'Cause you gotta understand
That there ain't no second chance

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,032
No one gets outta here alive
Only the strong survive...

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,549
[horns blare]

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,071
[Dad] We're finally here.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,073
Take me up on a wing and a prayer

30
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,678
lf you need someone, you know...
l'll be there

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,038
Your time has come
You can stand or you can run

32
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,193
But don't keep it all inside

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,831
'Cause you gotta understand
That there ain't no second chance

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,028
No one gets outta here alive
Only the strong survive...

35
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,555
[Junior still laughing]

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,036
Only the strong survive...

37
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,760
- ls it the one with the yellow roof?
- No.

38
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,433
- ls it the one with the purple flowers?
- No.

39
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,194
The one with the ''Sold'' sign in the yard?

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,952
Bingo!

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,793
Only the strong survive

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,595
Dad, come on. Let's go. Quick!

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,269
Oh, my God!

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,159
- Look at that hunk.
- Hubba hubba.

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,391
And the realtor says he's single.

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,471
Single?!

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,631
- What do you think, Junior?
- Great.

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,155
Come on! Quick, Dad!

49
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,199
Whoa! Totally awesome!

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,079
- Radical!
- You like it?

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,312
Wow! lt's fantastic!

52
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,789
Wait till you see your bedroom.

53
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,919
Yee-ha!

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,356
- Home, sweet home!
- Yeah, that's right!

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,192
This place is gigantic.

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,874
You could play football in here.

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,474
- Hit me, l'm open.
- Here's the bomb. OK...

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,598
[Junior] So here we are, starting our new life.

59
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,228
lt's nice having a guy who loves me.

60
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,234
Usually, people take one look
and run screaming for the hills.

61
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,520
You know, l think me and Dad
are gonna do all right together.

62
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,353
Should l spike you?
No, it's illegal to spike kids.

63
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,511
Come here, buddy.
lt's just you and me, Junior.

64
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,715
[doorbell]

65
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,871
Hang on a second.
Somebody's at the door.

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,673
Hi, l wanted to welcome you
to our little neighbourhood

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,831
so l baked you a...

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,594
..cherry pie.

69
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,594
That's so sweet. Look, Junior.
She baked us a cherry pie.

70
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,035
How thoughtful.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,754
All right! First and ten!

72
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,431
Junior! What are you doing?

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,558
l want you to apologise to this kind lady.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,351
Oh! You're even better-looking up close.

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,679
Excuse me.

76
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,713
What?!

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,874
- Dad, what about football?
- Thank you.

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,555
We can play later. Don't you want
to meet these wonderful ladies?

79
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,917
Out of the way, girls!
Oh, thank God! Another man!

80
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,311
Another Joe l can talk to.

81
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,357
l'm going crazy living here.

82
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,593
You know, Mortville.
The divorcee capital of the world.

83
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,470
Anyway, we're having a barbecue. So l
thought l'd be neighbourly and invite you over.

84
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,791
l'm Aron Burger, l live next door.

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,714
My name is Ben Healy
and this is my son, Junior.

86
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,075
Funny-looking kid.
Anyway, we'll take this with us.

87
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,391
Well, neighbour,
what do you think of my cooker?

88
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,632
- Very...large.
- You bet.

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,395
Cost me a whole month's paycheck,
but it's worth it.

90
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,871
You're not impressed.
l guess your wife does the cooking.

91
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,190
No, l'm...not married, actually.

92
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,157
We...broke up.

93
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,437
And you got the kid? Bad deal!

94
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,716
Did you get screwed!

95
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,440
This neighbourhood has a move-in fee.

96
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,398
You have to give each of us ten dollars.

97
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,838
20 bucks?! l'm not giving you diddly-squat.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,719
Pay us or leave!

99
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,637
And with a 50-1 chick to stud ratio
in this town, you gotta get started.

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,031
Dad, can we go?
These people are real dicks.

101
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,909
Well, excuse me, Your Highness.

102
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,959
l didn't realise that simple little me
and my simple little family

103
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,396
weren't good enough
for your high and mighty tastes.

104
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,997
- [music intro: Bad to the Bone]
- Hey, l should go and slip on my silk tuxedo

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,109
and then we can trot out
the champagne and the escargots.

106
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,670
Junior. Try to be polite. We're his guests.

107
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,193
OK, Dad.

108
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,636
- l'm sorry about that.
- lt's all right.

109
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,519
We've taken a long trip
and he's just a little tired.

110
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,717
My girls are the same way. Brats.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,991
Healy, go make yourself useful.

112
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,674
Get some more barbecue sauce
from the little woman.

113
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,673
Barbecue sauce. Sure thing, neighbour.

114
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,436
Here's to the start of a beautiful meal.

115
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,758
Damn.

116
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,111
This one's not getting away.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,513
Gotcha!

118
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,629
[Aron screaming]

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,673
- My first day of school.
- l'm so proud of you.

120
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,796
You're such a good girl.

121
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,110
Junior, get out of this car.
You are going to school!

122
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,316
No way! l'd rather eat a turd.

123
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,079
Junior,

124
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,028
third grade is the foundation
of a great education.

125
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,078
lf you don't go, you'll only hurt yourself.

126
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,515
l'll take a couple others down with me.

127
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,238
Junior,

128
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,915
l am your father and you'll do as l say!

129
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,877
Now, come on.

130
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,837
Now look what you've done.

131
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,678
Get over here.

132
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,435
Take this. Goodbye and good luck.

133
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,112
lt's his first day, he's a little nervous.

134
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,279
lt's him.

135
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,670
Yes, changing careers
was the smartest thing l ever did.

136
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,150
Yes, oh, yeah!
Because l love being the principal.

137
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,118
Because l hate children. l hate them.

138
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,635
Being a principal's great,
'cause l hate children.

139
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,791
l bark, they do what l say.

140
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,554
Anything. Crawl around
on all fours. They do that.

141
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,349
Would you mind jumping out of the window?
OK, sure.

142
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,317
- Out they go. Anything.
- [buzzer]

143
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,790
Principal Peabody,
there's a new student to see you.

144
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,349
l'll have to call you back.

145
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,718
l have to deal with
one of the little weenies right now.

146
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,030
OK, call you back.

147
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,476
Send the little sweetheart in.

148
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,550
[bloodcurdling scream]

149
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,517
Hey, pea-brain. What are you doing here?

150
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,955
What am l doing here?
What are you doing here?

151
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,510
l belong here. You belong in Cold River.

152
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,353
This is Mortville. What are you doing here?

153
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,354
You're not here. That's it.
That's the only answer. You're not here.

154
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,593
You're not here. l'm imagining you.
You're a figment of my imagination.

155
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,231
lf l was a figment of your imagination,
could l do this?

156
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,073
- [breaks wind]
- Oh!

157
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,479
Did something crawl in here and die?!

158
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,438
You disgusting kid!

159
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,717
You disgusting, flatulating kid!

160
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,112
Whoa! l just had a new paint job, too.
This is horrible.

161
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,396
- What grade are you in?
- Third.

162
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,279
Third. That means you're here
for another four years.

163
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,513
This is a mistake. This is a big mistake,
'cause you are a genius.

164
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,796
You are so intelligent.

165
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,793
Anyone who can break wind like that
has to have a mind.

166
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,599
So l'm gonna pass you on to the sixth grade.

167
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,433
ln one year,
you're gonna be in another school.

168
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,798
My dad says third grade
is the foundation of my education.

169
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,714
Your dad says that. Your dad is a moron!

170
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,279
He's a moron!

171
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,273
Know what a moron is?
That's what your dad is.

172
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,638
Anyway, you don't belong here.
You belong in the sixth grade.

173
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,314
That's where you are,
because you're a genius, kid.

174
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,118
A genius.

175
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,233
Sixth grade? l Wowl

176
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,756
l should fart in more people's offices.

177
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,553
[door opens]

178
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,593
[giggling]

179
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,828
Oh, no, not another one. How many kids
are they gonna make me teach?

180
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,238
Get in there and find a seat. Hustle, small fry.

181
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,109
l'm not gonna have you
hold up my class all year. Move it.

182
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,396
Let's start with a nice easy review

183
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,314
to see how much you under-achievers
remember from last year.

184
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,277
Polly, what's 1 7 times 8?

185
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,908
- 1 36.
- Good.

186
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,197
Richard, what's 7 2 divided by negative 9?

187
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,237
- Negative 8, sir.
- Fine.

188
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,958
Murph.

189
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,349
Murph. What's three plus two?

190
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,119
Four.

191
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,395
You've been in the sixth grade
since l started here.

192
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,438
l really want to get you out this year.

193
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,388
Please work with me. What's three plus two?

194
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,959
Nine?

195
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,396
This is gonna be a long year.

196
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,312
Five, all right? The answer's five.

197
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,833
You!

198
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,439
- What are you saying?
- l said five.

199
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,116
l'm glad somebody's paying attention.
Polly, pass out the workbooks.

200
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,990
l'm gonna rummage in the storage closet,
see if l can find something for Murph.

201
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,838
Who let the baby into the sixth grade?

202
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,839
What's in your bag?

203
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,838
- Your diapers?
- No, my lunch, pin-head.

204
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,839
Little kid doesn't know who he's talking to.

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,831
l'm senior student in this school.

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,878
No shit, you've been here since 1 970.

207
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,190
Oh, you're gonna hurt!

208
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,830
This is your last day of school. Ever.

209
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,311
[screaming]

210
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,151
[stifled cries]

211
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,711
Maybe Dad's right. Maybe Mortville
is gonna be a great place to live.

212
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,559
Good morning, Miss Dumore.

213
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,234
They missed a payment?
Toss 'em in the street.

214
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,358
But, ma'am, that's a nursing home.
They're invalids.

215
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,556
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.

216
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,280
Are we all set for that charity ball?

217
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,230
Your tickets are confirmed, but Sergio
says he needs money for a new tux.

218
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,118
More money?

219
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,352
l gave him two grand yesterday.

220
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,670
These damned gigolos.

221
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,434
Every man in Mortville
wants to bleed me dry.

222
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,718
Why can't l just find a good, decent man?

223
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,192
One with integrity, one with compassion,
one with...

224
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,432
Oh, my God! Who's that beefcake?

225
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,034
l'm Ben Healy, we spoke on the phone.

226
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,112
l don't know. l suppose
he's a customer at the bank.

227
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,350
Out of my way, fat boy.

228
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,640
That's why l wanna start my own business.
l wanna create something out of nothing.

229
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,109
l don't just wanna take. l wanna give.

230
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,078
l wanna put something
back into the community.

231
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,917
He's incredible. And he's just my type.

232
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,311
Smith, l want you to find out
everything about this guy.

233
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,916
Because l think l've found myself
hubby number seven!

234
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,319
[giggling] Hi.

235
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,196
[school bell]

236
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,390
- Hey, Junior!
- Hey, Dad!

237
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,233
So, tell me, how was your first day at school?

238
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,834
Pretty good, they skipped me three grades.

239
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,278
They skipped you?
That's fantastic! l can't believe it!

240
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,749
l told you you'd hit if off here.

241
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,151
So, tell me. Did you make any new friends?

242
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,632
Well, how would you define
the word ''friend''?

243
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,272
- Aah!
- Uh!

244
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,431
Ow.

245
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,559
Who are you?

246
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,759
l'm Annie Young. l'm the nurse
here at Mortville Elementary.

247
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,831
The children are very lucky.

248
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,677
- l'm sorry. Let me...
- lt's OK.

249
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,910
Oh, God. Excuse me. Here, l'll get...

250
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,073
lf you two are done fooling around,
maybe we can go home?

251
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,878
Yeah...

252
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,875
Give me a few minutes, Junior.
l think the swelling's coming back.

253
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,996
l'll put a warm compress on that.

254
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,230
You're such a good little soldier.

255
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,516
''Give me a few minutes, Junior.''
''Give me a few minutes, Junior.''

256
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,399
l've been here for an hour!

257
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,994
Who does that nurse think she is?

258
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,998
- [music intro: Bad to the Bone]
- Mm...

259
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,515
l wouldn't do that if l were you.

260
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,830
Oh, it's you. Buzz off.

261
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,231
l wouldn't do that if l were you.

262
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,670
lf l were you, l wouldn't do a lot of things.
Like go out in public.

263
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,071
Next time, you'll listen to me.

264
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,949
Oh, my God, he's an Adonis!

265
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,951
Look at these stats!

266
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,792
Six feet tall.

267
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,190
1 85 pounds.

268
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,319
ln-seam, 35 inches.
Sweet Jesus, take me home!

269
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,433
What's this thing?

270
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,113
His son.

271
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,710
''Boy and convicted killer go on joyride''?

272
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,070
''Little league team hospitalised''?

273
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,109
''Union Carbide plant explodes''?

274
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,712
This kid's a nightmare.

275
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,235
Do you want to forget the whole thing?

276
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,231
Smith...

277
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,950
When someone has a bum leg,

278
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,475
you don't shoot the patient.

279
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,200
You just cut off the leg.

280
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,793
That's why you want a franchise. Big Ben is
the fastest-growing sports equipment empire.

281
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,871
Hey, it's Big Ben.

282
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,917
Pick up that phone and call now.

283
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,356
For just $399,
you can get one of my starter kits.

284
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,911
Then you'll be on your way to having it all,
just like me, Big Ben Healy.

285
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,196
What's this?

286
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,598
Look at this. What sort of idiot
would send Grandpa money?

287
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,671
That's my namel

288
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,798
- The old man's finally lost his mind.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,159
- Come downstairs. l got a surprise for you.
- All right! A surprise?

290
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,958
- Where is it?
- Down the steps.

291
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,714
Now, where is that surprise?

292
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,996
- Surprise!
- Hi, Junior!

293
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,233
l'm Rhoda, your babysitter.
We're gonna be good friends.

294
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,039
Dad, let's slow this down a minute.

295
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,316
Now, what is going on here?

296
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,756
This is Rhoda, your babysitter.
You're gonna be good friends.

297
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,117
Yeah, l heard that part. But why?

298
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,157
Yoo-hoo!

299
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,231
Because l'm going out on a date.

300
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,991
Hi, Ben. l'm all ready.

301
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,755
Great. Junior, you remember
Debbie Claukinski?

302
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,595
How can l forget? Her pie gave us the runs.

303
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,873
That's not true.
He's thinking about someone else's pie.

304
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,158
Anyway, we don't want to be late.
l got reservations at the Saint Pierre Club.

305
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,235
Oh, l'm so excited! My ex-husband
never took me to fancy places.

306
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,155
Not that l'm a gal who rattles on about her
last marriage. That guy is insanely jealous.

307
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,709
Dad, stay here and have fun with me.

308
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,871
Junior, you're gonna have fun with Rhoda.

309
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,909
l'm sure you can think of a lot of fun games
to play with her, OK? l'll talk to you later.

310
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,031
Welcome to the wonderful world of pigs.

311
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,272
Dirty, hungry and always horny,

312
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,796
they're Mother Nature's
clowns of the farm world.

313
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,350
Watching these charming critters
roll in the mud,

314
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,638
it's hard to believe they have an intelligence
as high as some humans.

315
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,791
But it's true.

316
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,633
Goodnight, Dad.

317
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,360
Hey, brat. Put that back. l'm watching.

318
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,870
This babysitter sucks.

319
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,873
l gotta get Dad back on track here.

320
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,828
l wonder whatever happened
to Mr Claukinski?

321
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,471
[phone]

322
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,199
Hello?

323
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,751
[Junior] Are you the guy that was married
to Debbie Claukinski?

324
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,388
Yeah, but then she left me.

325
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,151
She took my house, my money and my pride.

326
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,999
Well, l thought you'd like to know
that she found herself a new guy

327
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,393
and they're out at the Saint Pierre Club,
having fun at your expense.

328
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,879
Who is this?

329
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,873
Just call me a friend.

330
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,552
[piano: upbeat rhythm]

331
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,352
Ben, this evening is perfect.

332
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,433
l know why the Mortville Gazette gave
this restaurant three and a half forks.

333
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,636
- Excuse me, we have a dress code.
- Let me in, you fool.

334
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,756
To us.

335
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,592
Tonight.

336
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,830
Ah-ha!

337
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,117
Debbie, you tramp! What are you doing here?

338
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,840
l'm a free woman. l can do what l want.

339
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,558
l show you.

340
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,949
Debbie, you leave with me.
Come, we take the bus home.

341
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,759
Like hell l will. l'm on a date.

Oh, my kidney!

You bully!

- Gee, baby, you work fast.
- l got Russian hands and Roman fingers.

Here it is, darlin'!

- This ain't no motel.
- Mind your own beeswax, twerp. Go watch TV.

Yeah.

359
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,155
So much for my first date.

l didn't think people could do that.

Can't we at least attempt to fit in?

Why are you getting angry at me?
l didn't do it, l watched it.

Yes, and so did the entire neighbourhood.

There's two more outside.

Don't scare him, for God's sakes.
He's only trying to be friendly.

What is going on here?

391
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,996
You never take vacations, and if you did
you wouldn't spend them with me.

392
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,878
Little Ben.

393
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,918
Little Ben, you're my only son.

Why don't you mind your own business?
Nobody asked you.

399
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,598
Wait, you can't be broke, we saw you on TV.

400
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,275
That was a big rip-off.
There were no franchises.

401
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,795
Hell, l only sold one starter kit.

Come on, Little Ben.
Do your old man a favour.

404
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,592
All those years l spent
putting a roof over your head.

405
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,469
l even bribed that dean
to keep you in college, remember?

406
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,871
You know something? You owe me.

407
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,750
This room is a little small.

408
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,674
Well, it's all we've got.
You can sleep in one of the bunk-beds.

409
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,273
Or you can leave.

Some educators
underestimate the value of civics,

00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,556
there's nothing more important
than pride in your city.

This is Highway 39.

And this is Mortville's very own Love Rock.

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,875
When the Dumore family settled this region,
they stole it from the lndians.

The lndians claim the rock has magic powers.

423
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,753
What kind of magic?

424
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,956
l don't know. Love magic, l guess.

Yes, you may, but hurry back.

and l was trying to save the school.

Your son saved the school. He put out a fire.

Did anyone ask him how it started? Because...

so he's probably a little insecure.

There you go, friends.

480
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,235
You only filled it halfway.

481
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,913
l tried my best.

482
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,868
That's not good enough.
For that, you don't get your free glass.

483
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,270
That's OK by me.

Dolly, Madison, how about
a glass of lemonade, huh?

488
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,829
Certainly. That'll be two dollars.

489
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,470
Two dollars?
For a glass of lemonade? For me?

Dad, what do you want for dinner?

495
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,871
- Macaroni and cheese or fish sticks?
- l'd love to have the fish sticks.

496
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,271
- But l got other plans.
- But l was making us dinner.

497
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,638
l can see that, but l'm going out
with Emily from down the street.

498
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,472
Am l gonna get another babysitter?

499
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,589
No, don't be silly. No more babysitters for you.
We got something better, Grandpa.

500
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,193
Stick him, stick him.

501
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,874
They don't make fighters like they used to.

502
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,349
No more. Nobody's hungry any more.

503
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,556
See?

504
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,234
Dad, don't go out on another date.
You already had one.

505
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,393
lt didn't work out. How can l find us
a new mom if l don't keep looking?

506
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,792
We don't need a new mom. Things were great
when it was just you and me.

507
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,474
l mean, we already got stuck with him.

508
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,713
Junior, l am going out on a date tonight, OK?

509
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,395
l'm gonna get cleaned up.
Let me know if you hear the doorbell.

510
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,028
Don't worry. You'll hear it.

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,678
You're all right

513
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,918
Whenever l'm asked
Who makes my dreams real

514
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,117
l say that you do
You're outta sight

515
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,268
So, fee-fi-fo-fum

516
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,194
Look out, baby, 'cause here l come

517
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,353
And l'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready

518
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,351
So get ready

519
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,230
l'm gonna try and make you love me too
So get ready

520
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,198
So get ready
'Cause here l come

521
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,396
Get ready
'Cause here l come

522
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,949
l'm on my way

523
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,835
OK, girls.

524
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,876
We've got work to do.

525
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,870
[bell rings, alarm blares]

526
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,270
- Argh!
- Ben.

527
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,309
l'm sorry, l'm suddenly not feeling very well.

528
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,113
l think l just caught that flu
that's been going around.

529
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,872
OK?

530
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,836
So the little monster
screwed you over again, huh?

531
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,036
Maybe l was too strong with him.

532
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,397
Ever since l started dating these women,
he's become so insecure.

533
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,996
lnsecure?
Little Ben, he's paranoid, he's jealous.

534
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,991
And he is dangerous.

535
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,957
What are you saying?

536
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,237
l'm saying leave him
by the side of the road and run.

537
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,392
That's a cop-out.
The boy wants to know he's loved.

538
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,473
l'm sure if l devote more time to him,
he'll be better.

539
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,111
Finally, Dad gets the point. Goodbye, ladiesl

540
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,716
Hey, dog-face.

541
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,235
l knew you'd look!

542
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,436
[teacher] No running in the hall!

543
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,319
Oh, darn!

544
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,118
[girl] Na-na-na-na-na.

545
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,748
You can't come in here!

546
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,957
The bitch must diel

547
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,077
Oh, shoot. She tricked me again.

548
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,710
l wish l had half the brains she does.

549
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,917
Well, there's always tomorrow.

550
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,039
[door opens and closes]

551
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,509
That guy's pathetic.

552
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,713
You're gonna wish you'd never been born.

553
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,590
Ooh, l'm really scared! l'm being
threatened by the Ty-D-Bowl Girl.

554
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,672
Now, why have you been bugging me?

555
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,469
l'll bug whoever l want. This is my school.

556
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,598
- Says who?
- Me and my M-80.

557
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,438
You're insane.

558
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,231
Let's get out of here!

559
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,311
[both screaming]

560
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,393
Just outta school
Like l'm real real cool

561
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,597
Gotta dance like a fool
Got the message that l gotta be

562
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,829
A wild one...

563
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,515
Out of my way!
l can't hold this one until recess.

564
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,030
This is gonna feel so good.

565
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,311
[contented sigh]

566
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,876
Clearance sale! Big clearance sale!

567
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,713
Well, well, well, what have we got here?

568
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,997
You girls selling your daddy's old clothes?

569
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,718
Look at this!

570
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,474
A silk shirt for a dime.

571
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,870
And a suit for a quarter?

572
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,793
l had one like this. l paid two grand for it.

573
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,875
Wait a minute. Wait a...

574
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,519
Nippy.

575
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,274
What the hell are you doing here?

576
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,271
They're selling you for a nickel?

577
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,589
You little crooks. Where'd you get this stuff?

578
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,876
We have wholesalers.

579
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,600
The hell you do. This is all mine.

580
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,833
No, it's not. Junior sold us
the whole package for ten dollars.

581
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,798
He did, did he? Well, we'll see about that.

582
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,880
Finally l get some room in here.

583
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,555
You little psycho.
This time you've gone too far.

584
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,996
- Shut your trap!
- You're an evil boy.

585
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,196
You've gotta learn to respect your elders.

586
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,989
lf your old man won't teach you
some manners, by God, l will.

587
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,312
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

588
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,869
My ass!

589
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,636
Hey, buddy, you ready to go?

590
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,279
Sure, but where?

591
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,238
lt's a surprise. l got a fun day planned.

592
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,913
All right, let's go!

593
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,188
Junior, have you seen your grandfather lately?

594
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,113
Last time l saw him, he was going out.

595
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,239
Ben!

596
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,118
Little Ben!

597
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,670
Help, Little Ben! Help me!

598
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,637
Whoa...

599
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,672
Benjamin Healy.

600
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,796
Time to meet your future.

601
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,839
Help me!

602
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,560
- Help me!
- What is that man doing?

603
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,632
l'm Big Ben Healy. l live here.

604
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,758
You live in that tree?

605
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,117
- Maybe he's Ben Healy's father.
- Shut up. l knew that.

606
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,670
Now move it. Get him down from there.

607
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,072
- [ping]
- Hooray!

608
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,638
- All right!
- Hey, Junior, this is for you.

609
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,518
- Thanks, Dad!
- You're welcome.

610
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,800
This is great. First it's a water park,
then a ball game, and now it's a carnival.

611
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,350
l just realised you and l haven't been
spending enough time together.

612
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,398
Dad, l'm glad it's just you and me.

613
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,552
Wow! Look at that cool ride!

614
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,472
- Can l go on it?
- Sure, that's why we're here.

615
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,909
[operator] This ride is overl

616
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,991
Whoa, slow down, dude.
You can't go on this ride.

617
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,277
- Why not?
- You gotta be as tall as the tentacle.

618
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,951
But it's only a millimetre.

619
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,873
Get outta here, you're holding up my line.

620
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,233
Thanks a lot.

621
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,516
l'm sorry, Junior. Maybe next year.
Look. You wanna go on the Munchkin Ride?

622
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,954
No Munchkin Ride. OK.

623
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,873
A candy apple?
Would you like a candy apple?

624
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,871
l'll be right back.

625
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,676
The little baby couldn't get on the ride?

626
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:07,358
What's the matter? They afraid
you'd go pee-pee in your diapers?

627
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,153
[carnival man] Hey, you little creep!

628
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,191
Hey, shrimp.

629
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,909
lt must be tough being a little shrimpo.

630
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,513
Ticket.

631
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,279
So, are you ready for fun?

632
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,431
Yeah!

633
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,311
You better hang on tight,

634
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,793
because you're about to experience
the Crazy Dancel

635
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,472
This is pansy speed!

636
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,518
Come on, pump it up, pump it up!

637
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,675
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah... Yeah!

638
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,271
l'm gonna puke!

639
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,035
l'm gonna barf!

640
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,313
Please, no.

641
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,990
Why do you do these things to me?

642
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,199
l thought we moved here to start over.
People told me you were a problem child.

643
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,115
l said they were wrong, l said
you just needed a chance to succeed.

644
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,874
We don't have a normal life, especially me.

645
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,077
l can't go out on a date
without something terrible happening.

646
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,753
Maybe you shouldn't go out.

647
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,038
Junior, just because l interact
with another human being

648
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,555
doesn't mean that l love you any less.

649
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,472
Can't you see that?

650
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,235
- Well, l suppose.
- All right, that's a start.

651
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,992
We can build on that.

652
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,878
l'll make you a deal.

653
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,759
l promise you that
l'll always be there for you.

654
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,878
But you've gotta promise
to be good from now on.

655
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,635
- OK, l promise.
- That's a little too fast. Think about it.

656
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,237
lt's not just an empty promise.
This is a pact between you and me

657
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,836
to regain some of the trust
we used to have, OK?

658
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,594
So what do you say? Are you gonna improve

659
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,797
so l can be right when l brag to my friends

660
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,157
and tell them l got
the greatest kid that ever was?

661
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,633
Sure.

662
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,916
l'll be better.

663
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,799
Thataboy.

664
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,350
What happened to our house?

665
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,073
Surprise!

666
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,231
- Dad, what have you done?
- Nothing.

667
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,109
The credit for this miracle
goes to one special lady.

668
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,037
Ta-raa...

669
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,589
- l don't understand.
- ls she a maid?

670
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,558
Yeah, made to order.

671
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,518
Benjamin, it's such a pleasure
to have new blood moving into our town.

672
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,194
On behalf of everyone at Dumore Bank,

673
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,238
Dumore Pharmaceuticals
and Dumore Strip Mining,

674
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,029
l just want to extend to you
this little ol' welcome.

675
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,270
l'm LaWanda Dumore.

676
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,591
You did all this because
l opened up a checking account?

677
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,479
You're a very special customer.

678
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,074
- [crash!]
- Oops!

679
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,914
- Oh, Junior... !
- That's all right, it's only dirt.

680
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,116
l'll have that up in a jiffy.

681
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,078
l'm sorry. Junior can be a little clumsy at times.

682
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,071
That's all right.

683
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,519
Without compassion and understanding,
what kind of world would we be living in?

684
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,193
Right, sweetie?

685
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,396
Just try to pull one stunt

686
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,599
and l'll cut you off at the knees
and bury you alive.

687
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,188
- She's an incredible woman.
- You haven't heard the best part.

688
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,715
She's worth $50 million.

689
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,756
l am so sorry,
l just completely lost track of the time.

690
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,478
l gotta run.

691
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,519
l got a meeting with some cockamamie
shareholder grievance committee.

692
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,558
But we should get together
for dinner real soon.

693
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,109
l could cook us up something special.

694
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,350
Well, sure. That would be nice, Miss Dumore.

695
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,637
Oh, no. LaWanda.

696
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,233
LaWanda.

697
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,079
Bye-bye!

698
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,396
Five oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh!

699
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,833
50 million!

700
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,595
LaWanda, it smells great in there.
Sure you don't need any help?

701
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,273
No, Benjamin.

702
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,752
You just stay down here and relax.
l'm taking care of everything.

703
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,239
OK.

704
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,796
l know l promised Dad
l wouldn't hurt LaWanda,

705
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,713
but l never said the dog couldn't.

706
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,755
You're falling into a trance.

707
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,198
Your eyes are getting heavy.
You can't move a muscle.

708
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,239
When you wake up,
you'll be thinking of one thing.

709
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,630
Destroy LaWanda.

710
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,552
She is your enemy.

711
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,598
She is like a cat, but uglier.

712
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,115
You want to bite her butt off

713
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,352
and scare her away,
so she'll never come back.

714
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,317
When l clap my hands,

715
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,632
you'll come out of the trance
and do whatever l say.

716
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,038
One,

717
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,315
two,

718
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,913
three.

719
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,629
One, two,

720
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,313
three.

721
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,473
Nippy?

722
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,596
Nippy? Hey, Nip, come on.

723
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,834
- Uh-oh! Nippy.
- [Big Ben] Nippy!

724
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,318
Nippy, where are you?

725
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,034
- What have you been up to?
- None of your business.

726
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,113
- You're not my mother.
- You are a mean little boy.

727
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,308
Go up to your room and change your clothes.
l will not have an unkempt boy at my table.

728
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,993
Your table?

729
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,193
Get!

730
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,676
Clowns!

731
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,308
l hate clowns!

732
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,837
This woman is bustin' my balls!

733
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,353
[guitar riff: Bad to the Bone]

734
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,273
Hey, guys,
what are you doing for dinner tonight?

735
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,989
l would like to make a toast to a terrific lady

736
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,118
who has made us feel so welcome
in our new town,

737
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,398
who's fixed up our house,
and cooked us this incredible feast.

738
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,152
- Hear, hear.
- To LaWanda.

739
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,197
- To LaWanda.
- To LaWanda.

740
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,031
That is so sweet.

741
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,430
l hope y'all enjoy this.

742
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,433
l had my staff compile their favourite recipes.

743
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,990
Well, l for one am famished, so let's eat.

744
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,998
What in the hell is in this salad?

745
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,116
lt's blue cheese.

746
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,878
Oh, my God.

747
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,110
All right, come on! Get LaWanda!

748
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,395
[she shrieks]

749
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,313
This salad is infested!

750
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,792
Get it! Get it!

751
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,917
This is a plague!

752
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,469
[Little Ben] LaWanda, l'm coming.

753
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,639
Junior, you failed me.

754
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,473
But, Dad, l swear, she hates me.

755
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,952
- We had a deal and you let me down.
- She's different from all the others.

756
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,031
LaWanda is bad.

757
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,876
Junior, you think all women are bad.
That woman has nothing but good intentions.

758
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,112
She made us dinner
and this is how you pay her back?

759
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,350
l am really disappointed in you.

760
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,229
l don't think l'll ever be able to trust you again.

761
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,599
Benjamin, l hope
you weren't too harsh on him.

762
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,878
- l think l've failed as a father.
- Oh, no, not at all.

763
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,713
There's only so much you can handle.

764
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,908
A father's good for some things, but you need
a mother for emotional guidance.

765
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,629
Values... Morality?

766
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,792
Perhaps l should talk to the boy?

767
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,111
- Well, yeah. That might be...
- Good.

768
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,397
Listen here, you little monster.

769
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,391
l am mightier than you are.

770
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,155
And l always get what l want, so back off.

771
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:44,110
Because whether you like it or not,
l am gonna marry your daddy.

772
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,909
And when l do, you'll be
on the first plane to boarding school,

773
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,911
in Baghdad.

774
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,480
Dad, you gotta believe me.
She said Baghdad.

775
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,518
Forget it, you have no credibility any more.

776
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,070
Let's see if we can get through
this evening like a normal family,

777
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,470
without anything bizarre happening. OK?

778
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,959
Come on.

779
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,796
Come here, look at the chart.
l got 1 5 gold stars this semester.

780
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,953
- Do you have anything nice to show me?
- Sure, just the usual stuff.

781
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,633
There's my desk.

782
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,115
Here's my science project.

783
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,032
l'm innocentl l'm innocentl

784
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,676
There's my teacher, Mr Thorn.

785
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,478
Mom, this is Mr Thorn.

786
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,835
She's doing very well. Awfully good.

787
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,710
Attention, parents. Please take your seats
for tonight's special programme,

788
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,279
Salute to Democracy.

789
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,716
Because you know it's, like,
democracy and we're saluting it.

790
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,551
[applause]

791
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,309
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Baldy.

792
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,278
Sure is great to see
all those parents out there tonight.

793
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,000
- lt sure is.
- [woman in audience] lt's so sweet!

794
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,037
You can't do that to me!

795
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,633
What are you...?

796
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,949
Sorry about the delay, folks.
We're experiencing technical difficulties.

797
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,829
Yeah, l had to scratch my balls.

798
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,117
- Hey, l didn't know eagles had balls.
- Yeah, l'm a bald eagle.

799
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,317
Did you know l could fart
The Star-Spangled Banne?

800
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,711
- Really? OK...
- Junior, no!

801
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,638
- Who are you?
- Who the hell are you?

802
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,034
Trixie!

803
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,715
l can't leave you alone for 1 0 minutes.
Why did you do this?

804
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,836
But, Mom...

805
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,959
Those kids wouldn't let me
be part of the puppet show.

806
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,671
That's no excuse for...
Come on, we are going right now!

807
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,515
Great show, huh, Dad?
l was saving you a seat.

808
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,198
Annie...

809
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,759
Annie!

810
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,558
Nurse!

811
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,877
Hang on! Wait!

812
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,156
Look, Annie, will you wait?!

813
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,030
- l understand what you're going through.
- You couldn't possibly.

814
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,636
- l do, believe me. We could help each other.
- Just forget it.

815
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,473
Trixie consumes my entire life.

816
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,074
l don't have room for anything else.

817
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,119
[Junior] Boy, that girl sure showed them.

818
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,912
Who would have thought that sweet nurse
would have such a crazy daughter?

819
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,152
[Little Ben]
What a mess. l have to get Junior a mother.

820
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,233
Annie would be perfect, she's smart
and sweet and pretty and loving.

821
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,313
lt would be great to have
a nurse on call 24 hours a day.

822
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,430
On the other hand,
LaWanda will go out with me.

823
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,158
[Big Ben]
Oh, God, please let him marry that rich broad.

824
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,278
'Cause l really need the money.

825
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,196
l gotta get out of this house.

826
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,069
My son's a loser, my dog has vanished.

827
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,835
And that punk Junior's the devil come to life.

828
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,752
Nippy! You've come back!

829
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,595
And l thought you abandoned me.

830
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,990
l should have known better.

831
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,549
You'll always stand by my side, won't you?

832
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,589
You're my one true friend.

833
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,759
Nippy...?

834
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,671
Nippy, what the hell happened to you?

835
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,269
l'm losing my mind.

836
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,831
Junior's getting worse. We can't even
figure out what he did to that dog.

837
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,833
Benjamin, l'm gonna be blunt.

838
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,436
- Your child is in a state of emergency.
- l'm doing my best.

839
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,319
Benjamin, it is not your fault.

840
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,914
You're a fine man.

841
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:41,154
But one lone individual just cannot do this job.

842
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,359
Your child needs two parental figures.

843
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,596
- LaWanda...
- Yes?

844
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,750
l'd like to ask you a question.

845
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,988
- Junior...
- Hey, Dad, what's up?

846
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,037
l've got some family news for you.

847
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,794
- ls Big Ben moving out?
- No, l'm not talking...

848
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,633
Listen to me, this is important. l...

849
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,595
l've made a decision.
l'm going to marry LaWanda.

850
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,072
- But, Dad, she hates me!
- She doesn't hate... That's ridiculous.

851
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:23,028
She wants what's best for you.
She wants to make us a home.

852
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,714
But she's gonna destroy everything.

853
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,919
Three men living together in a house
is a mess. lt's unnatural.

854
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,152
Plus, l feel she's a woman
of strong moral fibre.

855
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,834
She'll be a good influence over us,
especially you.

856
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,797
You're making a big mistake.

857
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,872
l am a grown-up
and l will do anything l wanna do.

858
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,237
And on Saturday
l'm going to marry LaWanda.

859
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,671
Benjamin, we got a jillion things to do.

860
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,470
Caterers, invitations and a one o'clock
appointment for a blood test.

861
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,959
l'll be right there.

862
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,671
Tell your grandpa l'll be back
in a couple of hours and then we'll talk.

863
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,638
We're from the animal control unit.
There's a local rabies scare.

864
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:29,396
- We're looking for any strange animals.
- Nippy's been acting a little funny lately.

865
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,757
- You better let us see him.
- OK.

866
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,309
- Not now.
- Come on.

867
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,870
- Here you go.
- What the hell happened here?

868
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,598
lt sure ain't rabies.

869
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,991
Nippy's lost his spunk.
Can you do anything for him?

870
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,718
Maybe.

871
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:59,113
- What kind of diet's he been on?
- We just feed him table scraps.

872
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,390
Think we've found the problem.
Why don't you come with us?

873
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,996
A time like this,
there's only one thing you can count on.

874
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,797
- Chow Down.
- Chow Down?

875
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,632
That's right, sonny. Chow Down.

876
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,951
Now in three delicious flavours.
Beef, chicken and horse.

877
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,516
Rich, meaty flavour,

878
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,674
all simmered in a delicious home-style gravy.
Mmm...

879
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,479
What dog could resist?

880
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,517
Come and get it!

881
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,273
Wow! Look at him chow down.

882
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,318
You bet, and wait till you see
how shiny his coat gets.

883
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,948
[Nippy defecating]

884
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,192
Glad we could be of assistance.

885
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,999
Come on, pal. Let's get back to work.

886
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,436
What's in that little black box?

887
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,477
You don't wanna mess with that.

888
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,234
That's blood tests from a rabid dog.

889
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,388
Blood tests, huh?

890
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,876
Healy, Benjamin.

891
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,793
Looks fine to me.

892
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,555
And who's next? Dumore, LaWanda.

893
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,551
Again.

894
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,551
OK...

895
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,753
Wow!

896
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,957
Operator, give me the County Health
Department. This is an emergency.

897
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,997
- lt's darling, LaWanda!
- My goodness!

898
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,596
Y'all are the best friends
a girl could ever have.

899
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,435
LaWanda, you're always
the most beautiful bride.

900
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,158
[knocking]

901
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,994
Excuse me, ma'am. ls Ms Dumore here?

902
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,153
Oh, my Lord! Somebody hired strippers.

903
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,311
You want me?

904
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,393
- Come and get me.
- She's already foaming at the mouth.

905
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,869
Better move fast.

906
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,316
- Here we go.
- You brutes are playing rough!

907
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,199
- What are you doing?
- We're from the County Board of Health.

908
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,510
- You have rabies.
- What?!

909
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,638
You cannot do this to me!

910
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,917
l am rich. l am powerful.

911
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,913
l do not have rabies!

912
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,709
LaWanda, how are you feeling?

913
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,438
How am l feeling?

914
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,955
How am l feeling? l'm tied to a bed!

915
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,918
Maybe this picture will cheer you up.

916
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:44,750
Maybe this is a little too much excitement
for LaWanda. Why don't we clear the room...

917
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,195
OK. Bye, LaWanda. Come on, Dad. Let's go.

918
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,796
No, sonny. Your dad means we should go.

919
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,279
All of us.

920
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,276
Give the lovebirds a chance to be alone.

921
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,998
This might cheer you up.

922
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,276
l'll put this over here.

923
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,479
l talked to Father Flanagan, and he said
there's no need to rush into these things.

924
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,949
We can push back the ceremony.

925
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:12,318
Benjamin, l do not like being patronised.

926
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,393
l don't care if we have to
roll this gurney down the aisle.

927
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,552
Tomorrow, we are getting married.

928
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,913
Big Ben's Sporting Goods
is embarking on a major expansion.

929
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,789
We're about to come into
a huge cash infusion.

930
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,830
[woman] l swear, you're important to me.

931
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,391
[man] l've made my decision. When l die,
l want people to remember me.

932
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,553
And after tonight's plastic surgery,
l'm gonna be someone,

933
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,395
because l'm gonna have
the biggest nose in the world.

934
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,996
[guitar riff: Bad to the Bone]

935
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,152
[muzak and chattering]

936
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,718
This place is awfully loud.
You sure you wanna eat here?

937
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,916
Of course. Pizza's my favourite food.

938
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,594
lt is? Oh. Fine.

939
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:28,036
Hello. We'd like a table for...

940
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,115
- Annie?
- Ben?

941
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,032
Maybe l'm gettin' soft,
but l just had the craziest idea.

942
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,191
[toy train whistles]

943
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,358
So then Dad dropped his pants on live TV
and he lost the election.

944
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,590
Here's a campaign picture.

945
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:54,038
What are you jerks doing here?
l was supposed to have dinner with my mom.

946
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,839
Quit yapping and let 'em have a good time.

947
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,230
Everybody smile
for your complimentary photograph.

948
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,960
Say ''Pizzarrific!''

949
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,828
Smile for your complimentary photograph.

950
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,918
Oh, boy, baby! When you're with me,
it's first class all the way.

951
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,039
We went to the restaurant,
they let us in, we didn't have to wait.

952
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,510
lt's not like the restaurants
where you talk into the clown face.

953
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:27,550
lt's not like that at all. Later on,
we'll go home and l'll put on the Zorro outfit.

954
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,077
Well, here's to an evening we'll never forget.

955
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,399
- lt's them!
- Who?

956
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,790
lt's him and it's her and they're together.

957
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,430
He has this flatulence problem
and he's eating a pizza, and it's her...

958
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,238
Hey, it's Peabody.

959
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,870
l hate that guy. He's got such a grating voice.

960
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,350
Yeah. l'll shut him up.

961
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,235
Here, let me. Terrible kids, just terrible.

962
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,113
That's pretty good. Let me try.

963
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,833
You rotten kids,
you should be locked in cages!

964
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,711
You can't talk to them like that.

965
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,472
Screw you, pal!

966
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,110
l can talk about anybody however l want.

967
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,839
Yeah!

968
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,954
Two can play at this game!

969
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,713
- Let's get 'em!
- All right!

970
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,792
- Keep it moving, come on.
- Quit pushing, it wasn't our fault.

971
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,748
- l got hit on the head with an egg.
- You can never come back again.

972
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,229
- That's a big loss.
- Yeah, we said no olives.

973
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,039
Did everybody get enough to eat?

974
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,079
Annie, you look like you could
use some dessert. Right around here.

975
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,157
- Your dad's pretty funny.
- He takes after me.

976
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,517
Junior, l'm sorry l hit you with the fire hose.

977
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,150
That's OK. l'm sorry l made you barf
on the Crazy Dance.

978
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,319
[Little Ben] l couldn't believe it...

979
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,550
..right in your face!

980
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,280
You know, l think your dad likes my mom.

981
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,558
Normally when a guy does that,
l run him over or knock him downstairs.

982
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,517
l gotta look out for her.

983
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,070
But your dad, he doesn't bug me that much.

984
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,038
You know, your mom
doesn't bother me that much either.

985
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,719
Pals?

986
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,393
Pals.

987
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,871
[siren]

988
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,352
My arms.

989
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,237
My arms are free!

990
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,959
Oh, my Lord.

991
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,871
What's wrong with my face?

992
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,112
What is this?

993
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:48,072
Oh... Oh!

994
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,074
[LaWanda] l'm Pinocchio!

995
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,950
Good, you made it.

996
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,680
Why did you want me to come over so late?

997
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,752
- You know how you said you liked my dad?
- Yeah.

998
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,469
l have the weirdest idea.
l think our parents should get married.

999
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,589
What are you talking about?
Your dad's already taken.

1000
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,594
Well, he might be having
a slight change of plans.

1001
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,752
[snoring and growling]

1002
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,634
Oh, great. Big Ben's up.

1003
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,150
Who are you? And you should be in bed,

1004
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,992
resting up for tomorrow's wedding.

1005
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,752
There ain't gonna be no wedding.

1006
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,799
l made LaWanda so ugly,
no one's gonna wanna marry her.

1007
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,428
LaWanda Dumore's the key
to my financial comeback.

1008
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,513
And nobody, nobody,
is gonna stand in my way.

1009
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,876
- Nippy, where'd you go?
- This guy's gonna be a problem.

1010
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,952
No, he's not. Let's get him!

1011
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,269
Yeah!

1012
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,956
l'm really tired.

1013
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:24,192
Come on, don't wuss out. This is
the only way to get our parents together.

1014
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,157
Now come on!

1015
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:40,472
Whoa! lt's so much bigger
than it looked on Mr Thorn's slide.

1016
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,675
So, how do you start this thing?

1017
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,957
l don't know. Guess you just make a wish.

1018
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:54,033
Mighty Love Rock,
we come to you today to ask a big favour.

1019
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:58,193
We got two parents and we want them
to fall in love and get married

1020
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,635
so l don't get stuck with that bitch LaWanda.

1021
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,917
l hope this isn't asking too much,

1022
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:08,119
but you're a magic rock
so you're probably used to these things.

1023
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,589
Please help us.

1024
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,553
Bye, Annie.

1025
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,990
All right, Junior. Get up.

1026
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,914
lt's a big day. Today you get yourself a mom.

1027
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,071
[phone]

1028
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,954
Has Junior ever run away before?

1029
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,636
No, it's this wedding thing. lt's got him upset.
l'm sorry he dragged Trixie into this.

1030
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,316
Don't let Trixie off the hook. She's usually
responsible for her share of the action.

1031
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,278
Junior can be
the biggest menace who ever lived.

1032
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:12,877
Well, maybe he was a nuisance
in that little town you're from.

1033
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,793
You're in Mortville
and around here Trixie runs the show.

1034
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:20,511
She's an amateur. Nobody has caused
the amount of destruction Junior has.

1035
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,158
l guess it's a stupid thing to argue about.

1036
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,392
There they are.

1037
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,194
Will you look at that?

1038
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,828
Hey, guys. Good morning.

1039
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,235
Hey, the Love Rock worked!

1040
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,517
Up and at 'em, Junior, let's go. Attaboy.

1041
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,957
So, do you need a ride home?

1042
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:12,352
No, l think we're gonna take a little walk
and have a little talk.

1043
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,637
Besides, you've probably
got millions of things to do today.

1044
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,792
Yeah, l guess l do have plans.

1045
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,758
So, see ya.

1046
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,232
Typical, Little Ben.
You always wait till the last damn minute.

1047
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,073
Dad, don't you wanna go see LaWanda?

1048
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,755
There's a tradition. The groom
can't see the bride before the ceremony.

1049
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,514
- But...but...
- But...but, my ass.

1050
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,910
Beat it, we're busy.

1051
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,789
Oh, nol lf Dad doesn't see
LaWanda's big schnozz,

1052
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,791
l'm screwed.

[music: wedding march]

1054
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,313
Miss Dumore!

1055
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,992
- Are you all right?
- Dad, look at her face.

1056
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,716
Hey, what happened?

1057
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,996
Thought you had me licked, huh?

1058
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,879
lt's amazing what $382,000 worth

1059
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,476
of last-minute double overtime
plastic surgery can do.

1060
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,636
Benjamin, what's the hold-up?

1061
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,239
Fine.

1062
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,918
Come on, sit down, kid.

1063
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,593
Hit it, padre.

1064
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,749
Dearly beloved, we are gathered today,
on this day of joy,

1065
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,070
to unite these two wonderful people.

1066
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,595
No! Dad, don't do it!

1067
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,320
Go for it, Little Ben. Make me proud!

1068
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,278
We are gathered together
on this day of joy,

Who the hell is that?

1071
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,516
That's my pal Trixie.

1072

[horn]

1073
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,116
l hate children!

1074
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,510
They ruin everything!

1075
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,515
lf l had enough power,
l'd wipe them off the face of the earth.

1076
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,589
[screaming]

1077
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,349
Junior!

1078
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,438
Nippy! No!

1079
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,877
No, Miss Dumore! No!

1080
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,632
l command you to stop.

1081
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,194
Trixie! You come down here
right this minute!

1082
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,749
How many times have l told you
not to operate heavy machinery?

1083
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,718
- Annie!
- Ben, l am so sorry.

1084
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,633
l couldn't stop her.
We've ruined your whole wedding.

1085
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,713
This wedding was meant to be ruined.
Annie, you're the one l want.

1086
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,239
What?

1087
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,475
- Yeah!
- We did it!

1088
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,790
What the hell are you doing? You gotta
scrape your lovely bride off the ground.

1089
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:27,509
Dad, l don't want to marry LaWanda.
l've found someone else.

1090
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,958
Who cares? LaWanda Dumore
is a gold-mine. She's worth millions.

1091
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,588
Dad, if you like her so much, you marry her.

1092
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,193
[ching of cash register]

1093
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,669
Yeah. Why not?

1094
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,839
Thanks, buddy.

1095
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,072
Dad, l wouldn't have done it for anyone else.

1096
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:55,919
Let me help you.

1097
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,833
One...two...three...

01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,638
Let me help you.

1099
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,791
Not you, dummy.

1100
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,358
Come on, there we go.

01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,511
Get your mitts off me.

Honey, come here. l'm not like them.

1104
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,278
l'm different. l love you.

1105
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,228
You said you love me?
