1
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,372
- Hello?

2
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,578
Hello?

3
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:10,536
Fuck!

4
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:11,606
Jesus Christ!

5
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,417
- What is that sound?

6
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,418
- I-
- Is that me?

7
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,787
- That's your phone.

8
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,320
- Where's my phone?

9
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,591
Did I, oh, okay.

10
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,560
- Shit.

11
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:15,928
It's my phone.

12
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,328
Shit.

13
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,331
It's my mom.

14
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,568
Hey, mom.

15
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,905
- Where are you?

16
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,337
- In the bathroom.

17
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,338
- You are so full of shit.

18
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,741
Shut up.

19
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:29,474
I need you to get
your grandfather now.

20
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,609
- Why?

21
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,610
- Because I fucking said so!

22
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,945
- Dad can't get him?

23
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,380
- If I wanted dickless
to go get him,

24
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,582
I would've called him!

25
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:37,449
Off your ass and
pick him up now.

26
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,519
- Fuck man.

27
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,588
She's always ruining
my high, man.

28
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:51,797
We gotta go.

29
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,666
I'm in a hurry.

30
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,300
I, I can't have her bitching
at me anymore than she is, man.

31
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,702
- But, you know
what, where is my,

32
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,904
I do have something
else down here.

33
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,740
I got a little
nuggy or something.

34
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:04,242
Gotta hit like a Dewey
decimal system for my weed.

35
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,678
One of those little-

36
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,679
- I, I can't pick
him up straight, man.

37
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:07,546
- Hey, come here.

38
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:07,682
I got something.

39
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,825
I swear, man, I
have here some good.

40
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:21,326
Pack of chit, Brussels sprouts.

41
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,661
- Brussels sprouts?

42
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,597
- Not just any
Brussels sprouts, man.

43
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,533
I get these from my guy who
experiments on all my shit.

44
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,034
- Oh.
- Yeah, dude.

45
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,636
- Have you tried it yet?

46
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:31,771
- No, but it's a
beautiful Saturday.

47
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:32,905
We gotta pick up your grandpa.

48
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:33,639
First time for anything, right?

49
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,507
- Yes.

50
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,674
- Let's do it.

51
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,377
These get you so high though.

52
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,713
You feel like you're
gonna die, man.

53
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:42,480
- Uh, die?

54
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,382
- Mm-hm.

55
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,851
Not really, but it gets you
high really, really fast,

56
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:49,322
and it amplifies your
hunger by like 10,000.

57
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,390
- Nothing wrong with that, man.

58
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,391
- I know, right?

59
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,527
- I love my Taco Bell.

60
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,530
- Get some more, man, all right.

61
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:59,430
- What's with the
keys and balloon, man?

62
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,699
- Don't worry about the balloon.

63
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,302
It's for my sister's birthday.

64
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,436
My keys in there,
haven't lost them once.

65
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,008
All right?
- All right, let's go.

66
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,642
Let's go pick him up.

67
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,679
- All right, let's do this.

68
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,521
- Hurry up, man.

69
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,891
- Hang on, I'm locking
the door, okay?

70
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,660
Gotta get the sweet spot.

71
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:28,661
- We gotta go, man.

72
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:29,795
My mom's gonna kill me.

73
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,496
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

74
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,499
- All right.

75
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,734
Hurry up.

76
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:36,735
- Chill, bro.

77
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,105
We're here at the car.

78
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,675
We're good.

79
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,617
- It's in there, man.

80
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,586
- Never got anything
in here, man.

81
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:55,388
- Why don't you
look under the raccoon?

82
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:01,492
- What's this?
- Told you, man.

83
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,493
That's good shit.

84
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,698
- Yeah, man, yeah!

85
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,101
Right on.

86
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,135
- Light it up.
- Yeah, man.

87
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,371
- And Mr. Raccoon's gonna be
on this trip to help us out.

88
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,807
Isn't that right, Mr. Raccoon?

89
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:15,975
- You wanna hit
this Mr. Raccoon?

90
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,009
- "Hell yeah, motherfucker!"

91
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:17,877
"Give me that shit."

92
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,746
- Here you go.

93
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:23,849
- "That is balls right there!"

94
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,651
You sit there, Mr. Raccoon.

95
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,385
You're our navigator.

96
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,754
All right, baby,
that is almost out.

97
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,390
Pass that shit before.

98
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:34,392
- I feel much better, man.

99
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,527
- Good, man.

100
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,528
We got this, we got this.

101
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,529
We'll get it back.

102
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,664
- Let's get grandpa.

103
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,397
- We're gonna get grandpa!

104
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,766
- Ha ha!

105
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:41,836
- We gonna get gramps!

106
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,672
Oh my goodness, it is not, it
is not gonna take its time.

107
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:47,606
I think it's gonna hit now, man.

108
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,608
- Yeah, man.

109
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,609
- Yeah, you know.

110
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,746
- Oh, that hit the spot.

111
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:00,686
- Okay.

112
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:01,553
You're gonna drive?

113
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,688
- Yeah, man.

114
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,822
- You're gonna drive, all right.

115
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,791
You drive.

116
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,032
Am I just really high

117
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,635
or do I live in front
of a fucking cemetery?

118
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,541
♪ We're taking you prisoner ♪

119
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,210
- All right, man.

120
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,613
Let's go get grandpa.

121
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,014
- Is this the fuckin' place?

122
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,749
- Yeah, this
is the place, man.

123
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:31,617
- This really it?

124
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,085
Okay.

125
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,186
- Don't you see the old
geezers walking around?

126
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,754
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

127
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:36,090
Let's go get him.
- Let's go take a look.

128
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,062
- This is it.

129
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,530
I'm sure of it, man.

130
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm telling you.

131
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,706
Hey mom.

132
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,976
- Where the fuck are you?

133
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,210
- I'm here.

134
00:07:58,212 --> 00:07:59,780
I'm right outside, calm down.

135
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:02,482
- Show me.

136
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,857
He's not fucking
there anymore, okay?

137
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:12,860
He's at 7th and Jet.

138
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,195
- Shit.

139
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:18,030
- Yeah, I told him that
you're headed there now, okay?

140
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,865
I'll send you the
God damn address.

141
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:23,237
Can you stop fucking smoking
for one God damn day?

142
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,272
Cock sucker.

143
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,889
- Think there's any
GILF's in here, man?

144
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:44,757
- What, man?

145
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,891
- GILF's, man.

146
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,559
Find an old lady with some cash.

147
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,694
Fuck the shit out of her
and you're fucking set.

148
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:49,563
- Hello?

149
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,064
- I'm right here, you idiot.

150
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,732
- Damn, man.

151
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,733
Well, I, I'm here to
pick up my grandpa.

152
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,942
- All right, man.

153
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,079
Well, can you just go
get 'em from me then, or?

154
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,214
- I'm on my lunch break.

155
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,217
- What room number is in, man?

156
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:11,984
- Fuck, man.

157
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:12,853
22.

158
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:14,922
Uh, you gotta sign in.

159
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,164
- You gonna watch
do it, man, or?

160
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,734
- You even know
what you're doing?

161
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,008
Uh, you forgot the time.

162
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,077
- Damn, man.

163
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,645
Fuck, man, this guy.

164
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:40,881
They better pick
it up for me, man.

165
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,790
Signed in, man.

166
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:52,858
- Have a good day.

167
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,726
- Fuck you.

168
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,061
- Oh, by the way, he's
having one of those days,

169
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:56,997
so enjoy your time.

170
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,132
- Great.

171
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,934
- Hey, no smoking
in here, you guys.

172
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,602
- What was that?

173
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,838
- You heard
me, fucking assholes.

174
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,209
- Uh, it's his.
- Thanks.

175
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,076
- Fucking mall cop, man.

176
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,026
- I still
don't understand

177
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,129
why you go to
these places alone.

178
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,899
- You always get like this.

179
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,635
- What?

180
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:37,236
- Every time I'm getting
ready to leave for a shoot,

181
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:38,772
you always say this.

182
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,177
- Newsflash, you don't get
paid enough for what you do.

183
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,213
- And if I didn't do this,
I'd end up living in my car,

184
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,284
which at this point, I'm
not that far away from.

185
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,219
- So first, you wanted
to be a carpenter,

186
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,688
and that lasted about what?

187
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,126
A month, and you turned your
living room into a tool shed.

188
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,101
- I can't hear you!

189
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,735
- "I can't hear you."

190
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,170
Come on, girl.

191
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:13,172
Now you wanna be an
aspiring photographer?

192
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,109
Jesus, just pick something.

193
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:19,246
Why don't you just live with me?

194
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:22,917
- No thank you.

195
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,859
- Hey, did you hear what I said?

196
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,092
- What?

197
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:34,828
- Move in with me.

198
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,229
- We tried that once.

199
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,166
- Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

200
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,701
- Right.

201
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,939
- Okay, then why don't you
just move in with your brother?

202
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,472
- Fred?

203
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,110
Hell no, he's a freaking
slob in a major pothead.

204
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,745
- What, what are you,
what are you doing?

205
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,047
It's 10.

206
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,281
- And?

207
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,818
- In the morning.

208
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,087
- Eh.

209
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,392
Ah, speak of the devil.

210
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,926
- What?

211
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,863
- It's Fred, idiot
boyfriend, Mike.

212
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,466
- Guy's such
a fucking loser.

213
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:21,942
- And done.

214
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,949
Listen, I'm gonna be okay.

215
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:34,953
- Are you five now?

216
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:35,823
- Promise.

217
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:45,232
You know, for someone who
cares about me so much,

218
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:47,401
why don't you just come with me?

219
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,769
- Okay, and see a bunch
of 90 pound bitches

220
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,838
pretend to be supermodels?

221
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,074
No thanks.

222
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,842
- You sure?

223
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,245
- Positive.

224
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,515
- Okay, I'll see you later.

225
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,992
Heads up, Fred and Mike
might stop by later, so.

226
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,129
Good luck with that.

227
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,934
Also, don't make a mess.

228
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,070
Love you.

229
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:29,109
- I don't think I can do
much more damage in here.

230
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,277
- Hello?

231
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,244
- Hey.

232
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,846
I missed you.

233
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,549
- What is going on with you?

234
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:12,284
This isn't the first time I've
left for a shoot by myself.

235
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:15,253
- I know, that's why this
time you're taking this.

236
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,254
- What the hell, man?

237
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,122
I'm not taking that.

238
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,524
- Yes you are.

239
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,259
And if you don't,
I'll stab you myself.

240
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,235
- What has gotten into you?

241
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,604
- Ah, don't worry about it.

242
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:33,138
I'm just gonna
leave it right here.

243
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,307
You won't even remember
that it's there

244
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,276
'cause of how busy you'll be.

245
00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:59,131
- Are you crazy?

246
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,200
- Drive safe.

247
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,205
- What the hell, man?

248
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,375
- Oh.

249
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,460
- God damn it.

250
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,720
- Okay, I forgot my phone.

251
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:03,656
Gwen?

252
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,098
Gwen?

253
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:21,306
If you're trying to scare
me, it's not gonna work.

254
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:36,522
What the fuck?!

255
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,247
Fucking duct tape!

256
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,427
God damn it!

257
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:18,231
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

258
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:54,669
Fucking gross.

259
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:17,659
- They need some elevator
music in here, man.

260
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,862
Whoa, what are you doing?

261
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:25,232
- This is what I'm doing, pal,

262
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,199
and you're gonna join me.

263
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:28,870
We'll be quick.

264
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:37,475
Bet we're the first people to
do this shit in the elevator.

265
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,813
- It's legal now.

266
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,282
- No, I am not.

267
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,678
- That guy was a
fucking turd, man.

268
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:12,914
- What an asshole he was.

269
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:14,749
"Sign here, man."

270
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:19,350
"Oh, and then you gotta put
the time too," you know, like.

271
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,588
- He didn't say bless
you when I sneezed.

272
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:22,922
- Did you sneeze?
- Yes.

273
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:23,923
- I didn't say bless you.

274
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,791
- Okay, I'm sorry.

275
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:26,659
I just had to deal with these
two fucking idiots earlier

276
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:26,794
that came in.

277
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,795
Yeah.

278
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:32,667
No, just degenerative
pothead fucking idiots.

279
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:37,368
- You're okay.

280
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,604
I forgive you for that.
- I do usually.

281
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:39,972
- Yes.
- Every sneeze, too.

282
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:41,540
- Yes, yes, you give me weed.

283
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,775
- If you sneeze
three times in a row,

284
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:44,375
I say it every time.

285
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,778
- The day that
guy gives me weed,

286
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,812
then he can skip
out on bless you's.

287
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:47,682
- Okay.

288
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:58,826
- Hello?

289
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:02,864
- What about Rambo, you know?

290
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:04,932
Like he's,

291
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:09,402
he's always been in
the jungle, every life.

292
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:14,575
- Fuck, man.

293
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,675
- I'm like Rambo.

294
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:17,676
- You're right.

295
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:18,544
- Oh, man.

296
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:25,887
- Rambo, man.
- Yeah, man.

297
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:31,692
Wait, who's Ram, is
that Schwarzenegger?

298
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:35,630
- Sly.

299
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,432
The Italian stallion.
- What?

300
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,435
Dig wat man.
- Okay I don't.

301
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:44,904
- What?

302
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,005
It's right, right?

303
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:47,006
- I think.

304
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:47,809
I, I'm not, I'm not hip.

305
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,615
- Hello?

306
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,730
- Hey, take that.

307
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:12,567
We need to get my grandpa now.

308
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:16,936
Come on, man.

309
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:18,005
Let's get up.

310
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,341
What the fuck are
we doling, man?

311
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:25,878
- The longer you keep knocking,

312
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,882
the longer you're gonna
have to wait, Sarah.

313
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,950
- Ha ha, I'm not Sarah, grandpa.

314
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:31,819
I'm Mike.

315
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:37,058
- No, you're the load that
should been swallowed.

316
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:34,115
- I think something's
going on down there.

317
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:38,617
- Come on, grandpa.

318
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:39,618
We gotta get outta here.

319
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,087
- Dropped my bag.

320
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:42,554
- Come on, bro.

321
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:44,089
Let's get outta you.

322
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,593
- I'm not a fucking dog, okay?

323
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,730
- Something
terrible's happening.

324
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,165
- Julie Webb.

325
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,569
I'm trying to pick up
my grandma, Ruby Hayes.

326
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:59,707
Yeah, I, I tried the front
door, but it was locked.

327
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:05,846
Yeah, I tried knocking, but
no one came to the door.

328
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:10,818
Okay, I'll go back to the front.

329
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:12,720
Thanks.

330
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:16,454
- Sarah, I'm not a
fucking mail built!

331
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,489
I knew this was gonna happen!

332
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,094
- All right, grandpa.

333
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,731
- He's really rude.

334
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,677
- Yeah, this is Frank speaking.

335
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:39,513
Who?

336
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:42,748
No, I'm on my lunch break.

337
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,085
I can help her when
I get back inside.

338
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:54,693
I said I am eating
right now, George.

339
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,597
I'll help her when
I get back inside.

340
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:02,136
Look-

341
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:05,940
Fucking prick.

342
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:46,578
- Help me, bro!

343
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,980
- Oh, this is bad.

344
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:55,154
- I knew this was gonna happen.

345
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:56,624
- Go get it, ah!

346
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:05,631
What the fuck is,
what is going on?

347
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:06,267
Oh, bro!

348
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:12,004
Oh man.

349
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:13,739
- They're real, old boy.

350
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,841
- That was, that was not real.

351
00:26:15,843 --> 00:26:17,276
- As real as you and me.

352
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:18,944
Real as the weed I'm
smoking right now.

353
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:21,015
- That was real, that was real.

354
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,616
Grandpa, you okay?

355
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:26,320
- Hell is a factor

356
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:30,057
and the walls are coming
down in front of our faces!

357
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:33,992
- No grandpa, no!

358
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,894
No, we can't go out there!

359
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:37,362
You saw them!

360
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:38,797
- Let me go stare,
you fucking bitch

361
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,033
I'm ready to fight these cunts.

362
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:42,036
- Oh, grandpa!

363
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:45,838
No, no, no, no, no, no!

364
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,917
- Are you there?

365
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,754
- If you guys don't leave,
I'm calling the cops.

366
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:03,755
- Hey!

367
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:04,658
Come on, man.

368
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:08,295
- I don't hear anything.

369
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:13,932
- Are you there?

370
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:17,204
- Hello?

371
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:29,917
- What's going on
out there, man?

372
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:34,319
- I don't know.

373
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,954
Ask him nicely.

374
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:37,224
Maybe you're being
too aggressive.

375
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:40,694
- Hello?

376
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,365
Hey, call the fucking cops, man.

377
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,148
Okay.

378
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,951
What's, what's up, brother?

379
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,087
You okay, man?

380
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:20,201
Hey, hey, you okay, buddy?

381
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:28,974
- That, that doesn't
sound good at all.

382
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:39,353
Fuck!

383
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:42,087
The fuck.

384
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:49,094
- Fuck!

385
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:50,229
- Who is it?

386
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:52,264
- Who do you think it is?

387
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:53,799
- Where the fuck are you?

388
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:54,935
- Listen, mom,

389
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,803
mom, listen to me.

390
00:28:57,805 --> 00:28:58,772
Something happened.

391
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,774
Something fucked up
is going on here, mom.

392
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:04,876
- You're fucking
smoking that shit

393
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:07,314
and it's turning your God
damn brain into jello.

394
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:10,851
- I'm not high, mom,
I swear to Christ.

395
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:14,321
The old people,
they're, they're sick.

396
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,291
They're, I don't know.

397
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:21,793
I don't know what's happening.

398
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:24,062
- You know, I asked you
to do one fucking thing

399
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:25,099
and you couldn't
even handle that.

400
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:29,034
- Something,
something's fucked up.

401
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:29,901
The old people, they're-

402
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:30,969
- You know what?

403
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:32,838
I'm driving there now.

404
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,439
- No, no, no, no, no.

405
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,874
You don't, don't
come down here, mom!

406
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,444
- You're a fucking idiot!

407
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:44,116
- Wow, wow.

408
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,353
Roads are blocked off
all throughout the coast.

409
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,187
The president just said

410
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:51,091
we are not allowed outside
in the streets at all

411
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:53,425
until further notice.

412
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:55,095
What the hell is going on?

413
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,872
- 911,
what is your emergency?

414
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:08,042
- My name is Madison Walker.

415
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:14,315
I just killed a zombie
with a chainsaw.

416
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:18,452
- Ma'am, this
line is for emergencies only.

417
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:21,554
- This is a fucking emergency.

418
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:22,524
My best friend is dead.

419
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,593
- You killed your friend, ma'am?

420
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:28,128
- I didn't say that.

421
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:31,298
A zombie killed my best friend.

422
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,366
- Ma'am,
I am going to hang up.

423
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:35,603
- Are you fucking serious?

424
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:38,236
I need your help.

425
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:40,839
I've just killed something.

426
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,508
- Ma'am, if
you remain on this line,

427
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,845
we will be sending an
officer to your location.

428
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,049
- 3127 Cedar Drive, you
stupid fucking cunt.

429
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,919
- We just
logged your number

430
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,387
and we have your address

431
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:57,956
and we're sending that
to an officer nearby.

432
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,525
- Fuck you.

433
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,370
Leave a fucking message.

434
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,505
- Fred, something
terrible is happening.

435
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:14,141
I need you to call me back, now.

436
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,072
- Oh, for sake, Gwen.

437
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,435
Get some.

438
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:20,407
Right.

439
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:20,131
- Good morning, Harmburg County.

440
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,501
I'm Rebecca Carpenter,

441
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:22,635
and here's the latest
on the situation

442
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:24,469
devastating our community.

443
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:26,004
According to reports,

444
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:28,106
people have been
attacked by individuals

445
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:31,777
infected with some form of
rash and skin discoloration

446
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:33,679
on their faces and bodies.

447
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:36,049
Those infected appear to be
attacking anyone within sight.

448
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:38,651
Police Chief Sarah Booth

449
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:40,452
urges citizens to comply
with his stay-at-home order.

450
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:43,221
Until further notice,
streets are to remain closed.

451
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:45,457
Anyone found outside
of their homes

452
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,459
during this mandatory
stay-at-home order

453
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:49,361
will be subject to arrest.

454
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,429
This has been signed into
effect by Mayor Robert Miles

455
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:53,601
and will be in effect
until further notice.

456
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:57,503
More than 50 people are
confirmed dead this morning

457
00:33:57,505 --> 00:34:00,673
following an outbreak at a
senior assisted living facility.

458
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:02,575
The virus swept quickly
through the facility

459
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:04,577
infecting seniors who have
been reacting violently.

460
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:07,613
Multiple staff members
are among the dead.

461
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,549
We still do not know an origin,

462
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:11,349
nor do we know why this virus

463
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:13,186
appears to be
attacking the elderly.

464
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,622
We'll be back in the second
we receive more information

465
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:17,792
on this tragedy
sweeping the nation.

466
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,087
- They're scared.

467
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,842
- I
really need to tell Fred

468
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,813
that I fucked his sister, man.

469
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:17,215
- Your weed makes
us the new gods

470
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:18,553
of the post-apocalyptic world

471
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:22,255
because of our
enlightened heads.

472
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:25,693
- I
really need to piss, man.

473
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,465
- What we have to do
as enlightened beings

474
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,300
is figure out how
to stop these things

475
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,536
and being the special
features fanatic that I am,

476
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,872
I know the number one
way to stop these things

477
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:42,644
is just shoot 'em in the
head or stab 'em in the head.

478
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:45,546
- How
come I can't talk loud?

479
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:02,429
- Hello?

480
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:05,867
I'm here to pick up my grandma.

481
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,876
- Fuck yeah, man.

482
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:18,211
Let's do this.

483
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,246
- Ah, help me!

484
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:39,459
- Anyway, um, let me know what
time I should come tonight.

485
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:43,363
I've been trying to get hold
of you and Chad the whole day.

486
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:46,464
None of you pick up the phone,

487
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:49,570
so just let me know what
time I should come, okay?

488
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:23,303
Hey, girl.

489
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:30,545
No, I, I just called Fred
and left him a message.

490
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:37,985
I, I can't hear you.

491
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:42,322
I'll call you back
when I get home, okay?

492
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:56,068
What the fuck is that?

493
00:38:57,972 --> 00:38:59,638
Nice makeup, bro.

494
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,507
Didn't know it was
Halloween in July.

495
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:06,514
Oh, you fuckin'!

496
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,683
- This
is truly devastating

497
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:12,352
how we're being lied to
again and not told the truth.

498
00:39:14,055 --> 00:39:17,058
People don't just randomly
attack one another

499
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,859
for no apparent reason.

500
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:21,062
There's something
else happening here.

501
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,700
If you have any information at
all, please call information.

502
00:39:27,535 --> 00:39:29,136
I will be here all day and
all night with you guys.

503
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:33,007
Anyone who's out there
listening, I'm here with you.

504
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,166
- I have a sword.

505
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:42,267
Ooh.

506
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:50,011
Call mom's cell phone.

507
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:58,150
- We're sorry,

508
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,752
you have reached a number
that has been disconnected

509
00:41:59,754 --> 00:42:01,922
or is no longer in service.
- Fuck!

510
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:04,725
Locate dip shit's cell phone.

511
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:07,895
- Locating
dip shit's cell phone.

512
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:13,000
Location detected at
7th Avenue and J Street.

513
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:16,969
Please be advised,

514
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:18,737
some streets may be blocked off

515
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,574
due to an emergency
virus outbreak.

516
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:23,944
Use caution when
proceeding to destination.

517
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,952
- You have an
incoming call from Julie.

518
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,654
- What, Julie?

519
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:37,056
- Someone ate Rick!

520
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:39,324
- I don't have time
for this, Julie.

521
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,026
Nobody liked Rick anyways.

522
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:43,295
- Are you fucking kidding me?

523
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:44,165
Help me!

524
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,299
- I have bigger fish to fry.

525
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:48,567
I have to go save Fred's ass.

526
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:49,768
Do you mind?

527
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,638
- What?

528
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:54,006
- Gotta
go, Julie, bye.

529
00:42:54,008 --> 00:42:55,941
- Fucking cunt!

530
00:42:55,943 --> 00:42:56,811
Okay.

531
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:09,922
Think, think, think.

532
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:10,791
Uh, okay.

533
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:13,725
I'm gonna call the cops.

534
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:15,661
I'm gonna call the fucking cops.

535
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:18,197
- We're sorry-
- What?

536
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:20,099
- You have reached a number

537
00:43:20,101 --> 00:43:21,667
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

538
00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:23,135
- Okay.

539
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:24,203
No, we're gonna call
them back, fuckers.

540
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:27,239
- We're sorry.
- Fuck!

541
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:28,109
Okay.

542
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:30,678
Okay.

543
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:33,614
Okay, God, go!

544
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,619
- Thanks
for calling Joe's Big Tow.

545
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:40,621
- I need help, please!

546
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,190
- Do
you need a tow, ma'am?

547
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,961
- No, there's someone
outside eating my boyfriend.

548
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:49,394
- Excuse me?

549
00:43:49,396 --> 00:43:51,230
- I need help, please!

550
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:54,199
- You
need to call 911, ma'am.

551
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:56,303
- No, I, all the
lines are blocked.

552
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:58,405
This is the only call
that went through.

553
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,074
- If your car
ain't broken down, ma'am,

554
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:04,176
then we can't go out
there and get ya.

555
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:05,377
That's our policy.

556
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:06,278
- Yes.

557
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,279
Okay, fine.

558
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:08,215
My car is broken down.

559
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:10,916
- Your
car is broken down now?

560
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:12,284
- Yes!

561
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:14,186
Will you send somebody?

562
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:16,223
- Well, hot
feathers on a duck's, ma'am.

563
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,258
Yeah, we got Hank.

564
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,995
He just got out
from lunch right-

565
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:23,864
- Hello?

566
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:25,733
Motherfucker!

567
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:45,951
Hey, hey, hi.

568
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:46,818
Uh, sir.

569
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,320
Sir, sir.

570
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:49,388
No.

571
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,389
Sir, no, no.

572
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:51,757
What are you doing?!

573
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:52,324
No, stop it.

574
00:44:52,326 --> 00:44:53,892
Stop it.

575
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:54,893
Fuck.

576
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:56,061
Okay, this is bad.

577
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:57,129
Stop, nope, stop.

578
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:13,380
Hey, hey, sir.

579
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:15,347
Stop it.

580
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:18,150
Stop!

581
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:19,887
Ah, why are you, ah!

582
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:23,724
No, I, uh.

583
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:27,125
No, no, no, no, no!

584
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:30,898
Sir, no, no, no, no.

585
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:38,270
Stop unlocking the fucking
door, you little cocksucker!

586
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,909
Okay, calm down.

587
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,077
Everybody calm down.

588
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,485
Fuck you, Maddie!

589
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:10,335
- The president has announced
a nationwide lockdown.

590
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:12,037
Anyone found outside
of their homes

591
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:14,507
will face arrest and jail time.

592
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:17,476
The National Guard has
been deployed to the border

593
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:19,378
to prevent any entry
into the country,

594
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,848
hoping to protect anyone who
could potentially be infected

595
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,283
by this deadly enemy.

596
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:25,917
We'll be back with
more information

597
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:28,088
as this story develops,
here, live on GR News.

598
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:46,574
- It's a fortress, man.

599
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,811
- I don't see any zombies.

600
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,084
- It's our kingdom.

601
00:46:58,252 --> 00:46:59,552
- Whoa.

602
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:02,156
Man, there's a door here, man.

603
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:08,093
But it doesn't take you to,
doesn't take you to anything.

604
00:47:15,202 --> 00:47:16,070
- Um.

605
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,040
Yeah.

606
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,009
Seen it all.

607
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:30,148
Yeah, they can't
even see us in here.

608
00:47:36,524 --> 00:47:38,058
- Whoa, man.

609
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,426
This is a trip.

610
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:44,162
It's like this door
goes somewhere,

611
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:45,099
but it doesn't go anywhere.

612
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:05,317
It's like we're in a
different dimension, man.

613
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,555
It's like that one
space movie, man.

614
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:19,032
- Mike, Mike!
- Message.

615
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:20,968
- Mike!

616
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,169
- This warning

617
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:25,605
is for the following area.

618
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:27,072
states located on
the West Coast-

619
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:28,073
- Oh man.
- Of the United States

620
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:28,643
and surrounding areas.

621
00:48:30,678 --> 00:48:32,177
A viral outbreak has occurred.

622
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,579
It is highly
contagious and lethal.

623
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:36,047
Please stay in your
homes and do not panic.

624
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:39,418
If you come into contact
with a sick individual,

625
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,453
please call the Centers for
Disease Control immediately

626
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:43,221
and quarantine.

627
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:44,690
Individuals who
present symptoms.

628
00:48:44,692 --> 00:48:48,594
Symptoms include but are
not limited to seizures,

629
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:52,698
convulsing, cold
skin, sweating, anger,

630
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,402
violent outbursts,
extreme hunger,

631
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:58,671
and bleeding from the
eyes, nose, mouth and ears.

632
00:48:58,673 --> 00:49:00,340
This is not a test.

633
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:04,604
- This network is a joke.

634
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:06,608
Yeah, they pay the
bills, but they suck.

635
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:11,779
I'm outside right now and
I don't see jack shit.

636
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,046
I'm telling you right now, Todd,

637
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:16,749
if you can't find
me a new network,

638
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:19,386
I'm walking from them and
I'm finding a new agent.

639
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:22,757
That's what you get paid for.

640
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:28,630
I want to be in the mix.

641
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:33,365
The open was last month.

642
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,435
I should have been there.

643
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:42,810
Exactly.

644
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:51,283
I just want to be on
the better network.

645
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:52,152
I deserve it.

646
00:50:58,425 --> 00:50:59,293
Thanks.

647
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:02,294
I'll call you back.

648
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:33,358
Fuck you!

649
00:52:13,768 --> 00:52:15,703
Could you have someone
come help me jump my car?

650
00:52:16,704 --> 00:52:17,903
It's dead.

651
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:28,181
Thanks.

652
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:40,893
Hey, I'm still at the office.

653
00:52:40,895 --> 00:52:42,528
I'm having car trouble.

654
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,397
I'll call you back later.

655
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:49,367
I don't have time
for this, Eric.

656
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:50,571
I'll call you back later.

657
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:00,213
Fucking pussy.

658
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:06,812
- We need weapons, man.

659
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:10,985
Oh, fuck.

660
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:16,023
First blood, motherfucker!

661
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:21,359
- Are there arrows in there?

662
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:22,795
- Nope.

663
00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:24,262
Who the fuck has a
bow without arrows?

664
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:25,465
God, fucking dick heads!

665
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:32,039
- These, man.

666
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:35,708
- You're not gonna
cut their hair, man.

667
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,577
Look around!

668
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:40,548
- Saw, man.

669
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:43,381
- You're, no, you're not Xena.

670
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:44,049
Come on, dude.

671
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:44,917
No, put it away.

672
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:45,885
What about that?

673
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:46,886
- Fuck.

674
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:48,821
Yeah, this, man.

675
00:54:48,823 --> 00:54:49,690
- Yes.

676
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:51,657
Yeah!

677
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:53,726
Yeah, yeah, yeah
- Yeah!

678
00:54:53,728 --> 00:54:54,862
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

679
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:57,064
- Yeah!

680
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:02,770
- They don't want any more, man.

681
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:04,639
- Fuck Rambo.

682
00:55:05,573 --> 00:55:07,506
Sober motherfucker.

683
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:15,581
- Yo, what the
fuck is that, man?

684
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:23,057
I can't do this, man.

685
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:29,829
- Hey, uh, skin dick.

686
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:31,764
Get over here.

687
00:55:34,836 --> 00:55:37,036
God, this was not
such a good fucking-

688
00:55:37,038 --> 00:55:38,403
- Fuck is that?

689
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:39,073
Oh my...

690
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:50,852
Oh, shit, oh!

691
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:07,768
- Guess who's an alcoholic.
- Fuck!

692
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:10,903
- A little help here!

693
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:12,638
Little help here!

694
00:56:19,814 --> 00:56:21,614
- Oh shit.

695
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,123
He's still alive, man.

696
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,925
I've never killed
anybody before, man.

697
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:33,926
I can't do it.

698
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:36,461
- Don't worry about it.

699
00:56:36,463 --> 00:56:38,396
I learned this from
Edward Norton, mother!

700
00:56:40,668 --> 00:56:44,169
That's what you
get for pushing me!

701
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,403
- Oh fuck.

702
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:50,609
- You gotta be heartless, man.

703
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:53,712
You gotta be heartless
to do the right thing.

704
00:56:53,714 --> 00:56:54,715
- Fuck, man.

705
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,187
- Oh.

706
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,791
- Oh shit, they're
closing in on us, man.

707
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:17,736
They're everywhere, man!

708
00:57:17,738 --> 00:57:18,938
Oh fuck!

709
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,840
We gotta get the
outta here, man.

710
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:21,876
We can't fight them all.

711
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:24,877
Oh, we gotta go!

712
00:57:24,879 --> 00:57:26,477
Let's go!

713
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:42,797
Dang it!

714
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:51,072
Fred?

715
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:03,816
- We're sorry-

716
00:58:03,818 --> 00:58:05,684
- Fucking kidding me?

717
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:06,685
That has been disconnected

718
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:07,588
or is no longer in-

719
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:12,992
- Oh, Fred.

720
00:58:12,994 --> 00:58:13,861
911.

721
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,104
Pick up, Fred.

722
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:33,078
Pick up, Fred.

723
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,513
This is Fred.

724
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:35,649
Leave a fucking message.

725
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,158
- Oh!

726
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,109
- I smell your flesh.

727
00:59:04,111 --> 00:59:05,644
- What the fuck?

728
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:07,148
How can you talk, man?

729
00:59:08,749 --> 00:59:10,918
- Of course I can,
you fucking idiot.

730
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,288
- How's that even
impossible, man?

731
00:59:17,925 --> 00:59:18,793
- It's in the script.

732
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,193
- Oh, right.

733
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:22,063
Oh!

734
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,165
Just let me go, please.

735
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:26,932
I'll give you all,
all of my Dogecoin.

736
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:28,235
- You fucking idiot!

737
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:32,237
- Oh shit!

738
00:59:49,156 --> 00:59:50,157
- You fucking prick!

739
00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:52,758
You kicked me?

740
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,060
Why would you kick me?

741
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:56,628
I'm a woman.

742
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:57,298
The fuck?

743
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:01,166
Hanging out.

744
01:00:01,168 --> 01:00:03,235
Does this look
fucking normal to you?

745
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:05,304
- Fred, stupid cock sucker!

746
01:00:05,306 --> 01:00:07,039
Where the fuck are you, man?

747
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:07,908
Oh shit!

748
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,680
- How am I supposed to eat now?

749
01:00:22,823 --> 01:00:24,323
- What the fuck is that, man?

750
01:01:27,821 --> 01:01:29,688
- Where's the fucking elevator?

751
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,123
- Why you asking me, man?

752
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:32,124
I don't know where
the elevator is.

753
01:01:32,126 --> 01:01:33,725
- You literally said,

754
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:35,127
I'm totally gonna
remember where this is

755
01:01:35,129 --> 01:01:36,261
in case we have to come
back to this later.

756
01:01:36,263 --> 01:01:37,396
- Ah, it's on the way out!

757
01:01:37,398 --> 01:01:37,898
We can find the elevator, man.

758
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,832
- Why didn't you
split that last joint?

759
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,134
- I don't know, it
helps me think, man.

760
01:01:42,136 --> 01:01:43,168
- Supposed to go
to the head one.

761
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,803
- No, I didn't, man.

762
01:01:44,805 --> 01:01:46,238
- I have ruined my
brain with that,

763
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,873
especially when
I'm fucking high.

764
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:48,874
You said you were
gonna remember!

765
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:49,875
- All right, man.

766
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:51,743
- I distinctly forgot it

767
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:53,345
because you said you were
going to remember it.

768
01:01:53,347 --> 01:01:54,913
- I'm thinking, I'm
thinking, I'm thinking, man.

769
01:01:54,915 --> 01:01:56,315
All right, so we
went down the hallway

770
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:58,250
and the zombie chasing
me down that way.

771
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:00,118
Or we went down the hallway to
the left and we made a right.

772
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,119
When I came back out,
that zombie was chasing me

773
01:02:01,121 --> 01:02:01,255
so it is right...

774
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:03,956
- We made a left, so this
time we go right, right?

775
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,157
Left or right?

776
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:06,227
Make the decision.

777
01:02:07,928 --> 01:02:08,796
- Got it, man.

778
01:02:12,066 --> 01:02:13,298
I got it, man.

779
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,900
I know where it is.

780
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:15,767
I know where to go.

781
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:16,437
Follow me.

782
01:02:17,972 --> 01:02:19,373
- No other option,
so I guess I have to.

783
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:25,079
This feels right.
- I found it, man.

784
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:32,820
- This is not the elevator.

785
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:36,021
- What, man?

786
01:02:36,023 --> 01:02:36,888
- This is an ice cooler from
a fucking convenience store.

787
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,157
How did this even get in here?

788
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:39,393
Sure, make some more noise.

789
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:43,262
Make some more noise
so they can find us.

790
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:44,863
Zombie, over here!

791
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:46,298
By the icebox!
- All right, man,

792
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,933
you made your point.

793
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:48,469
You're being loud enough.
- Fuck.

794
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,937
You really have a
drug problem, man.

795
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:53,372
- Man, you're right.

796
01:02:53,374 --> 01:02:55,107
- This could cost
us our lives, okay?

797
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:57,411
- I need an intervention,
I think, man.

798
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:00,912
- Jesus fucking Christ.

799
01:03:17,931 --> 01:03:19,164
- Mike, Mike!

800
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:20,165
What are you doing?

801
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:22,200
Don't just stand there!

802
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:27,306
Take your time, man!

803
01:03:27,308 --> 01:03:30,044
- I can't move.

804
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:47,893
- Come on, man, this way.

805
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,406
- Oh fuck!

806
01:04:00,474 --> 01:04:02,843
What the fuck is that, man?

807
01:04:06,213 --> 01:04:07,547
- Fucking hell.

808
01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:08,415
- What the fuck is going on?

809
01:04:10,484 --> 01:04:12,184
They're zombies, man.
- Fucking zombies.

810
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:14,920
- We're never getting
outta here, man.

811
01:04:14,922 --> 01:04:16,054
- We're fucked, dude.

812
01:04:16,056 --> 01:04:17,356
It's inevitable.

813
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:23,028
- What the fuck is that, man?

814
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:27,167
You okay, grandpa?

815
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:31,472
- There's only one
thing left to do.

816
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:34,408
- He's not moving, man.

817
01:04:35,943 --> 01:04:37,878
He's just like, he's
a statue zombie.

818
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:40,278
- We haven't much time.

819
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,549
- Maybe he wants to
smoke some of that, man?

820
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,118
You want some with his, grandpa?

821
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:46,554
Grandpa, there you go.

822
01:04:51,626 --> 01:04:53,427
- Trippy, man.

823
01:04:54,962 --> 01:04:55,663
- Smoking
with grandpa zombie.

824
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:01,935
He likes it, man.

825
01:05:04,138 --> 01:05:06,608
I think we found the cure, man.

826
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:11,111
Grandpa.

827
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:16,915
It's our first session
together, grandpa,

828
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:18,485
- A little mind
opening can convert anybody.

829
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:21,455
He's done.

830
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:25,190
- Oh, he finished
the whole thing, man.

831
01:05:25,192 --> 01:05:26,193
- He's done.

832
01:05:27,595 --> 01:05:29,127
- Trippy.
- No more.

833
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:30,563
There's no more weed.

834
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:31,697
Okay, well, that's
the last of it.

835
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:33,465
- That's, that's the last of it?

836
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:35,200
We don't have any more, man.

837
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:36,368
He looks like he
wants more, man.

838
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,170
What are we gonna do?

839
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:39,304
- No, man.

840
01:05:39,306 --> 01:05:40,372
- Come on, we gotta get outta.

841
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:41,375
Wait, wait, I think,

842
01:05:42,443 --> 01:05:44,042
I think I got some sprout.

843
01:05:44,044 --> 01:05:45,343
Brussels sprouts, man.
- Brussels sprout.

844
01:05:45,345 --> 01:05:47,078
- We got some more weed, man.

845
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,315
It's just in
Brussels sprout form.

846
01:05:50,317 --> 01:05:51,185
- Good stuff.

847
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:01,259
- Oh fuck, man.

848
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:03,028
- That's right, it
amplifies your hunger.

849
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,966
It also amplifies your
hunger by like 10,000.

850
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:38,356
