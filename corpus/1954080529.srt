1
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,536
Damn it Mary!

2
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,395
Jim, you need
to call the plumber.

3
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:46,761
I can fix it!

4
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:49,438
Just because you have me
in a monkey suit all day

5
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,884
doesn't mean that I don't
know how to use my hands.

6
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:55,983
They are getting worse.

7
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:57,345
It will get better.

8
00:00:57,346 --> 00:01:00,141
Suzy Jacobs
parents fought a lot.

9
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:01,847
Then her dad left.

10
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:05,020
Danny,
mom and dad will make up.

11
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:05,996
They always do.

12
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:08,573
And, besides if they don't

13
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:11,702
we move to Canada.
- Canada?

14
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:13,757
What would we do
in Canada?

15
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:16,091
What everybody
does in Canada.

16
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:17,729
Go to Niagara Falls
every day and

17
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,608
eat gravy
with our French fries.

18
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:22,014
Gravy? Canadian's eat gravy

19
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:23,866
with their French fries?

20
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:25,262
Why?

21
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:27,447
Because they're part French,

22
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:29,203
makes them a little weird.

23
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:39,970
Suspense
and suspicion have been

24
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:42,427
developing throughout
Florida this week.

25
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:44,200
MacDill Air Force Base
in Tampa and

26
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,882
Patrick Air Force Base
in Cape Canaveral

27
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:47,443
have been put
on alert.

28
00:01:47,663 --> 00:01:49,596
Yesterday the Jacksonville
Naval station

29
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:51,612
began staging
readiness drills.

30
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,296
Many suspect that these
new developments

31
00:01:53,297 --> 00:01:55,183
may have something
to do with Cuba.

32
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:57,761
Washington still has
denied this claim.

33
00:01:57,762 --> 00:01:59,763
However, many believe
new hope will be

34
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:02,195
the topic of tonight's
Presidential address.

35
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:03,611
We bring you
to the White House

36
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:06,602
for a special message
from President Kennedy.

37
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:13,407
Good evening my fellow citizens.

38
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,828
This Government
as promised

39
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:19,535
has maintained
the closest surveillance

40
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,086
of the Soviet Military build up

41
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,870
on the island of Cuba.

42
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,884
Within the past week,

43
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:29,664
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact

44
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:32,777
that a series of offensive
missile sites

45
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:34,954
is now in preparation

46
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,325
on that imprisoned island.

47
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,589
The purpose of these bases

48
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:41,162
can be none other

49
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:44,161
than to provide
a nuclear strike capability.

50
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:53,807
You wanna let him finish?

51
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:55,491
I think that is enough,

52
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:56,392
for tonight.

53
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,672
We'll read it
in the paper tomorrow.

54
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:14,877
The Commies
have missiles pointed at us?

55
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:18,505
Yes.
- But, where are they?

56
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:19,977
They're in Cuba.

57
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:22,118
That's right next
to our house.

58
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,880
It's next to Florida.

59
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:25,311
Our house is in Davie.

60
00:03:25,803 --> 00:03:27,880
Are they mushroom missiles?

61
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,333
Mushroom missiles?

62
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,467
You know,

63
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:32,418
the kind
we dropped on Japan.

64
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:35,139
They look like
a big mushroom.

65
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:39,342
I don't think
they make those anymore.

66
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:41,488
Are these missiles new?

67
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:43,667
Are they better?

68
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,135
I don't want them
to hit us.

69
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:48,004
They're not going to hit us.

70
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:49,806
They won't?

71
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,380
No.

72
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:58,133
Because we're going
to stop them.

73
00:03:58,423 --> 00:03:59,913
Don't worry about
how yet,

74
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:00,814
I got a plan.

75
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,038
Just get some sleep,

76
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,247
we got a lot of work
to do tomorrow.

77
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:34,576
As you can see

78
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,800
we're here and
the missiles are there.

79
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:39,336
What we need to do
is go from point A,

80
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,798
to point B.
- But,

81
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,211
how?

82
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,569
We'll build our own rockets,

83
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,694
and we'll fly them over
to Cuba.

84
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:52,007
Our rockets
will hit their missiles

85
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,633
causing them
to blow up.

86
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:55,021
But,

87
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:57,297
if the missiles
blow up

88
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,054
wouldn't that hurt
the people in Cuba?

89
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,326
No,

90
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,743
because these will only
make a blast big enough

91
00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:07,243
to make the Cuban missiles
stop working.

92
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:28,314
Hello?

93
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:31,865
Oh,
hi mom.

94
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:36,077
I think mom is scared

95
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:39,658
good thing we've sorted out
this missiles business.

96
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,716
No, they're great.

97
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,161
They don't even
seem scared.

98
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,059
No, it's Jim.
I'm worried.

99
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:51,765
I know.

100
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:53,988
I know.

101
00:05:57,511 --> 00:06:00,176
Boys, would you like
to talk to grandma?

102
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:04,669
Hi grandma!

103
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,650
Do you think these will
really make it over to Cuba?

104
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,501
I,

105
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,944
yeah,
of course.

106
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:26,758
I mean,

107
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,910
if we add side fins any smaller
it probably wouldn't.

108
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,730
But, I added an extra inch
to each side so

109
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:35,091
we should be fine.

110
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:37,721
And,
if that fails,

111
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:47,565
then,
we have this.

112
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,470
I special ordered it
from NASA.

113
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:54,526
It super propels the rocket
no matter where you want it to go.

114
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:13,585
I found a way
to solve this missile situation.

115
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:15,991
We're going to build
a bomb shelter.

116
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:19,100
A bomb shelter?
- Yeah.

117
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:21,752
How are we going
to put up a bomb shelter?

118
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:23,814
I had Larry
draw up the plans.

119
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:24,715
Marian.

120
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:31,885
We are going to put up
a concrete home

121
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,706
right out
in the back yard.

122
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,180
I've got
more bread in the oven.

123
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,440
Okay, that's it boys.

124
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:55,284
14 feet. Now pull the string tight.
Push it in right there.

125
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,296
Let me figure out the
hypotenuse

126
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:58,727
see if this squares up

127
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:03,093
Are we really
going to live here?

128
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,055
Well if anything hits us
this will be our new home.

129
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:16,375
Should we tell him
about our plan?

130
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,596
No,

131
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:19,743
he's preoccupied.

132
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:25,371
I just think
we should wait

133
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,483
and see
what Kennedy does

134
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:28,866
before we start
carving up the back yard.

135
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,272
Kenned...
Kennedy is a moron.

136
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:34,750
It's not like he can just
make the missiles go away.

137
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,890
Alright, alright, alright
fine.

138
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,163
We'll wait
a couple of days

139
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,493
but if he doesn't manage
something soon

140
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:43,249
I'm going to start digging.

141
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:45,827
Thanks, Jim.

142
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,276
We'll leave
right after the lunch.

143
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:16,903
It's okay.
Sometimes that happens.

144
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:18,866
That's why
we got two.

145
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,174
This is
really going to work.

146
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:23,079
Mom, dad,

147
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,875
can we turn on
the news?

148
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:31,417
Go ahead.

150
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:45,696
A final chapter
in the Cuban crisis

151
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:47,127
is brought
to a close

152
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:49,847
as President Kennedy
holds a news conference

153
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:52,416
to announce that Soviet
bombers on Cuban soil

154
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:54,367
would be withdrawn
by Russia.

155
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,479
This are the plans
that Castro claimed

156
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,105
he would not
relinquish.

157
00:11:58,155 --> 00:12:00,704
But Mr. Kennedy says
that he has a pledge

158
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,265
right from
the Kremlin.

159
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:04,062
I have today been

160
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,343
informed
by Chairman Khrushchev

161
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,719
that all of the IL-28 bombers
now in Cuba

162
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:12,119
will be withdrawn
in 30 days.

163
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:14,528
He also agreed
that these planes

164
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,559
can be observed and
counted as they leave.

165
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,630
Say it.

166
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,399
Say it, Mary. Say whatever
it is you want to say.

167
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,155
Jim, please listen.

168
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:34,338
I'm taking the boys
to my parents next week.

169
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,079
For how long?

170
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:38,393
I don't know.

171
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,829
Trust!

172
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:42,988
It's true, please.

173
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:05,339
Miles,

174
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:07,234
we really did it.

175
00:13:11,363 --> 00:13:12,598
Is everything okay?

176
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:18,357
Yeah, everything is fine.

178
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:22,430
Can we go to the beach
again tomorrow?

179
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,728
The beach?

180
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,522
We don't have any more
rockets to launch.

181
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:30,491
I know.

182
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:32,708
We did it!

183
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,015
But I had fun.

184
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:40,646
We don't have to save America
every day to go to the beach.

185
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:47,399
Okay,

186
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:49,746
