1
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:05,965
- Ooh!
- Oh!

2
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:14,519
All right, this is a stick up.

3
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,588
Stick 'em up!

4
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:16,956
Hands up, hands up.

5
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:19,848
Everyone, everyone, all of you.

6
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,202
Now...

7
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:23,332
Where's the stash?

8
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,333
Uh...

9
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,239
Gooey Chewies.

10
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,570
The Gooey Chewy bars!

11
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,750
Thanks.

12
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,863
How do you do?

13
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,431
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

14
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:45,754
Oh, shh, shh, shh. It's gonna be okay.

15
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:48,558
It's gonna be okay.

16
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:55,832
Don't make me use this.

17
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,149
Don't make me laugh.

18
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,977
Funny you should mention that.

19
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,517
Feelin' lucky?

20
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:03,518
Punk!

21
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:16,216
Huh?

22
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:19,857
Ah!

23
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:31,116
Who's next?

24
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,619
Wherever evil lurks,
wherever it may hide,

25
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,101
it is time to unmask it and
reveal truth to the world.

26
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:17,799
It is time to right the world's wrongs

27
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,398
and fight injustice wherever it may lie.

28
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,233
To help the...

29
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:23,067
Cut!

30
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:23,900
Cut.

31
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,549
Adding Super Leaf to the shot.

32
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,100
Gotta get the leaf in the shot.

33
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,939
Sweet.

34
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,639
- IQ.
- This is not a film

35
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,199
on the supernatural properties of a leaf.

36
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,149
It has no business
being in my masterpiece.

37
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,019
Hang in there, captain!

38
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,189
Super leaf comes in for the rescue.

39
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,758
Now evil will rule the world.

40
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,411
Hey!

41
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:08,411
Hey!

42
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,900
Ah, he took your candy bar.

43
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,258
Cool.

44
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,592
Woo hoo hoo hoo.

45
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,468
Oh, watch the road, will ya?

46
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:36,467
Watch the road, right.

47
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,219
Hey losers.

48
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,269
Here we go again.

49
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,189
What are you scrubs up to no?

50
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,486
We're making a cool movie

51
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,749
and Bernie plays as Gonzo superhero-

52
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,299
- Stop talking, what are you-
- Who's gonna save the world

53
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,869
as we know it, and the
bad guys, the bad guys...

54
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,114
Hey, you want to be the bad guys?

55
00:05:55,115 --> 00:05:56,379
- Do I wanna-
- Anyway, these bad guys,

56
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,213
they try to destroy everything-

57
00:05:57,214 --> 00:05:59,469
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

58
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,099
Shut your trap.

59
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,546
- Shutting trap now.
- Okay.

60
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:05,547
Thank you.

61
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,549
Oh hey, a movie with a girl director.

62
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,914
What is this thing?
Russell.

63
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:13,579
A viewfinder.

64
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,709
- Wow.
- That's enough.

65
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,543
Yeah?

66
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,140
What are you going to
do about it, Super uh...

67
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,580
Wimp.

68
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,019
Yeah.

69
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,949
Super Wimp.

70
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,783
Check it out, man.

71
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:28,439
I'm Steven spell, um, no it's stall...

72
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,300
Stool.

73
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,712
Spatula.

74
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:32,129
Gah!

75
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,615
Who am I?

76
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:35,583
Hang on.

77
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,999
Give it back to her.

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,258
And what are you going to do if I don't?

79
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:46,781
Sick him, Splat! Get him boy!

80
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,019
And cut.

81
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,082
Now that is what I call entertainment.

82
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:55,982
Oh.

83
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,387
My viewfinder.

84
00:06:57,388 --> 00:07:00,100
Aww, now look what you made me do.

85
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:01,409
Aww.

86
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,763
Oh, well. That's showbiz.

87
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,405
Oh! Hey, hey, hey!

88
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:09,238
Little mutt!

89
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:11,500
You're all lame-os.

90
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,359
Stay away.

91
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
We're out of here.

92
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,980
So...

93
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,460
Spielberg.

94
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,033
It's Steven Spielberg.

95
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,658
I should have stopped him.

96
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:34,893
It's not your fault.

97
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:37,411
Your eye. What happened to your eye?

98
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,430
Some super hero.

99
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,560
Can't even protect my friends.

100
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:59,490
Hey, mister! You dropped your...

101
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,491
Mister!

102
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:03,095
Splat, no.

103
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:05,399
Splat, no boy.

104
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,089
You know how gassy you get.

105
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,969
Ooh, Gooey Chewy bars.

106
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,270
There's only three left.

107
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,089
Cheers.

108
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,120
To the lame-os.

109
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,350
Yeah.

110
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,410
Lame-os.

111
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:27,414
- Oh!
- Ah!

112
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,873
How many of
those did you eat? Geez.

113
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,390
Let me get this straight.

114
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:46,499
You let the factory ship my special batch

115
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,409
of Gooey Chewies to the wrong addresses?

116
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,763
We got 'em back, sir.

117
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,859
About one box.

118
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,693
One box?

119
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:58,429
One bar will make a person
immune to my laughter generator.

120
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,923
Who's responsible?

121
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Well?

122
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,481
Well, who was driving?

123
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:18,279
For whom doth the bell toll?

124
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,399
Yell-oh?

125
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,830
It's tolls for thee.

126
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,766
Oh?

127
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,689
He died doing what he loved.

128
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,189
- Wing Nut.
- Sir?

129
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,589
We had trackers on each
of these boxes, did we not?

130
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,809
Yes we did, sir.

131
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,223
Then find it.

132
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,769
What if someone's already eaten one?

133
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,109
Then find him and bring him here.

134
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,609
- Okay.
- But do it quietly,

135
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,959
so we don't attract the attention

136
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,563
of The World Intelligence Team.

137
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,069
- Right.
- Oh, and Wing Nut?

138
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,000
Hm?

139
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,649
Do it now!

140
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,619
On my way.

141
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,659
Excitement continues to rise.

142
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,279
Every country around the
world will be watching

143
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,529
in eager expectation regarding

144
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,269
this unprecedented event where
the queen and the president

145
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,379
and other top world leaders
will soon be in Paris,

146
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,609
signing a treaty to once and
for all usher in world peace.

147
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,299
The United Kingdom looks upon

148
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,329
this auspicious event with
the greatest anticipation.

149
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,909
Nowhere in the history of mankind

150
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,399
has such a possibility...

151
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,907
Presented itself and it is in both honor

152
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:52,085
and humility that I shall...

153
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,739
So, um, how do you like the meatloaf?

154
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Meatloaf...

155
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,013
I was wondering.

156
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,040
It's not as good as what mom made.

157
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:13,261
You still miss her?

158
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:15,094
Yeah, me too.

159
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,929
Hey, I heard a good joke at work today.

160
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,559
What did the sea monsters eat for lunch?

161
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,999
Not tonight, dad.

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,089
Come on, you like my jokes.

163
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,186
I mean they're a little corny, but-

164
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,187
- Yeah.

165
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,850
All right. What's up kiddo?

166
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:42,953
Don't you ever, you know,
get tired of being a nobody?

167
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,340
Um...

168
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:47,063
No, no, I don't mean you.

169
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,099
Look, I know we need the extra money

170
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,489
and I get that schools
need custodial engineers.

171
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,490
You mean janitors.

172
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,329
It's okay, we all have value.

173
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,909
Yeah, right.

174
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,710
Like being some jerk's punching bag.

175
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,323
Okay. So that's what
this is all about, right?

176
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,623
I tried helping someone and messed up.

177
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,383
Just like always.

178
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,230
Talk about a loser.

179
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:20,649
Hey, you're not a loser for messing up.

180
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,039
You have one of the biggest
hearts of anyone I've ever met.

181
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,000
Right.

182
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,629
You do.

183
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,630
And you...

184
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,020
You got that from your mother.

185
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,819
Come on, I see how you
look out for your friends.

186
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,853
The lame-os.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,449
Yeah. I'm real good at that.

188
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,349
Lens Cap and IQ, they're
not lame-os, they're...

189
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,949
Okay, they're little
weird, but they have value.

190
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,950
We all do.

191
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:53,249
I know what'll cheer you up.

192
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,443
I have a surprise.

193
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I want you to close your
eyes and don't peek.

194
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,593
All right?

195
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,680
And...

196
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Voila.

197
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,259
What is this?

198
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,079
It's your dessert.
That is angel food cake.

199
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,243
Bam.

200
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,192
Okay, it's a little, it's
a little over cooked.

201
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,873
Okay. You know what?

202
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,308
You made your point.

203
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,219
Why don't you go upstairs,
start your homework

204
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,003
and I'll, uh, and I'll
bring some ice cream.

205
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,869
Eh, you know, I think I'm good.

206
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,651
I can't burn the ice cream.

207
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:41,735
Hmm.

208
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:42,660
Hmm.

209
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Go.

210
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,163
Fish and ships.

211
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:53,737
What?

212
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:57,410
What the sea monsters
ate, fish and ships.

213
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:58,461
You know...

214
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,130
Bern?

215
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,003
Everyone has value, son.

216
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,603
God, he doesn't make junk.

217
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:38,729
Give it back to her.

218
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,943
Give it back to her.
Am I speaking clearly?

219
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,369
You talkin' to me?

220
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,376
Boom.

221
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:46,939
Want another kick? Boom.

222
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,669
You talkin' to me?

223
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,279
There is no one behind me,
so you're talking to me

224
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,753
and that is a bad idea.

225
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,059
You go, leave.

226
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,019
You go, leave. I don't wanna
see you around her anymore.

227
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,209
Pick up the viewfinder or
else this will happen again.

228
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,479
Boom. But a thousand times.

229
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,629
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom.

230
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,289
Thunder.

231
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,290
Lightening.

232
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,629
Bern, you all right?

233
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,630
Uh...

234
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,519
Yeah. I...

235
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,979
Yeah, I'm fine.

236
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,480
Hey, wrap things
up, sport. Time for bed.

237
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,930
Yeah.

238
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,699
You're grounded.
You are grounded, mister.

239
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,349
And for a very long time.

240
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,300
Paul.

241
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:52,849
He left the gate open
and we could have lost Splat.

242
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,807
Sometimes I wonder if he
even has a brain in that-

243
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:57,276
- Paul David Dingledorf.

244
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:59,729
God does not make junk.

245
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,781
I, I never said that.

246
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:04,256
You didn't have
to. That's what he thinks.

247
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:05,959
- I-
- Talk to him, Paul.

248
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,839
Tell him.
But I didn't mean

249
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,635
I know, just do it.

250
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Bernie?

251
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Bernie, son?

252
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:21,773
Can I come in?

253
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,515
Bernie?

254
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,839
And so what am I supposed to do?

255
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,763
Just let him have his way?

256
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,207
I mean a guy's gotta stand
up for his rights, you know?

257
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,219
So I'm just gonna continue

258
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,533
to be a wimpy looser and that's it?

259
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,483
I miss you, mom.

260
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,127
Really bad.

261
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,729
Are you sure this place is okay?

262
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,541
This place being all secret and all?

263
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:28,677
Ooh!

264
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:29,969
Goodness.

265
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,970
Here you go.

266
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,669
Only the select are given access

267
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,529
to such classified locations.

268
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,720
Rest assured men of great
power such as myself...

269
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,593
Can always make exceptions.
Oh, oh.

270
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,250
Hello?

271
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,889
Madam Secretary.

272
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,269
Where is everyone?

273
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,879
Um, well, I'm only one
at this station, ma'am.

274
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,599
We are in the middle of nowhere.

275
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,929
Which explains why we've traced

276
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,899
the secret warehouse
and weapons headquarters

277
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,169
of the notorious. Dr.
Chuckles to your district.

278
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,299
Who would expect world
peace to be destroyed

279
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,823
from such a no nothing location?

280
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,939
Is someone with you?

281
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,599
Someone with, someone with me?

282
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,859
No, no.

283
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,089
No unauthorized personnel here, ma'am.

284
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,950
I'm all alone.

285
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,889
Agent 001/2 at your
service, Madam Secretary.

286
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,839
You were mentioning Dr.
Chuckles and world peace.

287
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,279
High level security indicates

288
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,449
that he plans to destroy the
upcoming World Peace Conference

289
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,119
tomorrow in Paris.

290
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,199
Well uh, how's that, Madam Secretary?

291
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,029
He has developed a giant laugh generator

292
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,539
that will send the world,
starting from top leaders

293
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,069
and working its way
down to the common man,

294
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,409
into uncontrollable fits of laughter.

295
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,439
He plans to reduce conference into nothing

296
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,893
but laughing mayhem.

297
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:53,809
Oh, that's terrible.

298
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,810
And you.

299
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,519
You must shut that
machine down at all costs.

300
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,209
I'll get right on it, Madam Secretary.

301
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,719
There is one thing
you should know first.

302
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,709
His agents have stolen something
called Gooey Chewy bars

303
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,719
from all across your town.

304
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,819
Uh, Gooey Chewy bars.

305
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,819
Why is that important, Madam Secretary?

306
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,969
Our best guess is that he has created

307
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,229
a special batch of bars
with a unique ingredient

308
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,109
protecting Chuckles and his workers

309
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,809
from the effects of the laugh generator.

310
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,789
These bars could give you and our agents

311
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,859
protection against that laugh generator,

312
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,809
but Chuckles has retrieved
all of the boxes but one,

313
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,400
which our satellites reveal

314
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,079
was thrown into this garbage
can by this individual,

315
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,239
one Bernard Dingledorf.

316
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,100
He looks dangerous.

317
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:41,749
You must bring him in
and find out what he knows,

318
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,659
but quietly to not attract Dr. Chuckles.

319
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,199
Now we've sent agents to assist,
but time is of the essence.

320
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,719
I will personally attend to
it myself, Madam Secretary.

321
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,641
There's no one there to help you?

322
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:58,617
Agent-

323
00:19:58,618 --> 00:19:59,618
Thank you.

324
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,259
Agent 001/2 at your
service, Madam Secretary.

325
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,839
Lord, help us all.

326
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,483
Thank you, ma'am.

327
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,170
Thank you very much.

328
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:16,059
Bernie, let's go. Time for school.

329
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,429
Hey. Seven o'clock kiddo, rise and shine.

330
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,969
Let's go.

331
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,169
Come on. 20 minutes.

332
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,040
Cereal's on the table. See you at school.

333
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:15,574
Hm?

334
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,558
Oh.

335
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,210
Oh!

336
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:44,012
Hm.

337
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:57,818
Ah!

338
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:11,506
Oh!

339
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,131
Dad?

340
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,455
Splat? Wake up, boy.

341
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:54,038
I'm
sorry. Will you repeat that?

342
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:54,982
Shh.

343
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,969
Shh is not on your playlist.

344
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,254
Did you mean Strauss?

345
00:23:58,255 --> 00:23:59,488
Shh.

346
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:00,894
Playing Strauss now.

347
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:05,099
Mm.

348
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,099
Shh, shh, shh.

349
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,221
Splat.

350
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,970
Hm.

351
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,162
Hm.

352
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:09,680
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-

353
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,874
Thank you.

354
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,020
Oh, sure.

355
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:13,021
- Ah!
- Ah!

356
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
Ooh.

357
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:43,282
Yes!

358
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:47,198
Eh?

359
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:08,207
Ah!

360
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:27,923
You're gonna need those.

361
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:30,172
Who are you?

362
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:31,172
What's going on?

363
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,359
Don't make me use this.

364
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
A TV remote?

365
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,170
I don't think some
stupid TV remote's gonna-

366
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,479
A motion freezer?

367
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,159
Oh, it does much more
than that, my little friend.

368
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,899
We have many other even
cooler items packaged in here.

369
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,159
Who are you?

370
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,993
Why am I here?

371
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:03,453
Your government needs you.

372
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,979
Manly Man Hair Restorers?

373
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,757
Sorry. That was for a friend.

374
00:28:15,137 --> 00:28:16,720
You're a T.W.I.T?

375
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,209
Never heard of it.
And you never will.

376
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,293
We're so secret, we don't even exist.

377
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,159
- But you're here.
- Where?

378
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,409
- Here.
- There's no here here.

379
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,239
- You're not here?
- Where?

380
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,769
You're not here, I'm not here,

381
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,029
so you've kidnapped me and taken me

382
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,003
to some place that's not here.

383
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
Very good.

384
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,086
Do you have a Gooey Chewy bar?

385
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:40,509
And now he's hungry.

386
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,929
You picked up a Gooey Chewy
bar off the street last night.

387
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,212
Yeah. It fell off the back
of a truck and I ate it.

388
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,339
You ate it?

389
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,419
In its entirety?

390
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,820
Oh, this is not good.
Actually, it was great.

391
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,110
What's going on?

392
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,634
Meet Dr. Chuckles.

393
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:00,468
A clown?

394
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:02,079
Yes, a clown.

395
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,219
A clown who plans to destroy the upcoming

396
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,649
World Peace Conference using

397
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,113
this dastardly war machine here.

398
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,749
Nope, not it. Sorry.

399
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,019
Here.

400
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,369
Nope.

401
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,619
Not it. Here.

402
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,359
No, I thought I shaved that. Ew.

403
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,666
Here.

404
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,859
Ah. The Laugh Generator.

405
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,389
He's going to broadcast
its special frequency

406
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,739
to every cell phone in the world

407
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,509
causing each and every citizen to break

408
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,360
into uncontrollable fits of laughter.

409
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,089
What's wrong with laughter?

410
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,599
Depends on the type.

411
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,009
There's laughter that's
innocent fun.

412
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,273
Or laughter that's mean and insulting.

413
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:44,226
Hm.

414
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,379
And he's chosen the mean laughter?

415
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,649
Yes.

416
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,800
And he's found a place
to unleash its power

417
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,403
in his diabolical plan
to destroy world peace.

418
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,850
Sorry.

419
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,119
Excitement continues to build

420
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,009
as national leaders from around the globe

421
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,529
head for Paris and the
World Peace Conference,

422
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,449
where they plan to sign a special treaty

423
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,869
to finally end all wars

424
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,429
and initiate lasting worldwide peace.

425
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,919
All eyes around the world...

426
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,753
But if everybody's laughing

427
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:20,979
by playing mean jokes on each other...

428
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,400
Welcome to World War III.

429
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,197
And anticipation upon
this momentous occasion.

430
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:27,219
Ah, mm, thank you.

431
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,899
We join the President now as he prepares

432
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,099
to depart from his pre-meeting in Germany.

433
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,509
In preparation for this meeting,

434
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,709
the German chancellor
and I have just completed

435
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,495
a long and fruitful discussion.

436
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,990
Where is Wing Nut?

437
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,733
Spit it out.

438
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,793
Cat got your tongue?

439
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,100
Oh, ah!

440
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:07,279
- Speak man!
- He's out searching

441
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,714
for the boy.

442
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:11,872
He's out searching for the boy.

443
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,600
Sorry, sir.

444
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,289
We can wait no longer.

445
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,149
Our destiny awaits.

446
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:23,150
Stand by for world domination.

447
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:29,830
Never in human history has
such a grand opportunity...

448
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,129
It's possible the bar
you ate came from a batch

449
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,599
especially created to protect Dr. Chuckles

450
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,239
and his goons from the frequency.

451
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,240
To proceed with utmost
sobriety, and I dare say...

452
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,029
If that's correct,
you may be the only one

453
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,569
in the entire planet who can stop him.

454
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,570
Yeah, right.

455
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,369
Well, I mean even if it's
true, how could I stop him?

456
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,699
By infiltrating his headquarters

457
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,813
and destroying the generator.

458
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:58,939
What's that?

459
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,889
Sensors indicate Dr.
Chuckles is preparing

460
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,339
to fire the generator.

461
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,478
As I prepare to leave for
this monumentous meeting...

462
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,729
Three, two...

463
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:14,588
One.

464
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:25,684
I just wanna say...

465
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,223
What is that?

466
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,730
Tuck in, tuck in.

467
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:46,384
Tuck in.

468
00:32:59,495 --> 00:33:01,524
- That's terrible.
- Mm-hm.

469
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:16,926
It's um, it's beginning to
affect me, too.

470
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380
But...

471
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:22,022
How are you going to stop
him? What are you going to do?

472
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:26,981
I mean, you're the only one
who can stop the generator.

473
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:28,079
But I'm just a kid. I can't-

474
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,940
- Hurry.

475
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,757
Save our world.

476
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:33,890
You've got the wrong guy.

477
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,275
Dad.

478
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:38,749
I gotta find my dad.

479
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,583
He'll know what to do.

480
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,504
I gotta go to the school
and I gotta find my dad.

481
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,933
Agent Dingledorf.

482
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:50,901
You're our only hope!

483
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:58,729
Dingledorf.

484
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:07,648
Come on, come on.

485
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:08,869
No, no, just kidding.

486
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,870
Okay, okay.

487
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:11,699
Oh, stop!

488
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,390
No, you, you come over.

489
00:34:13,391 --> 00:34:14,377
Come on, come on, come on.

490
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:16,281
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

491
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:17,630
Whoa!

492
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:21,062
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

493
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:22,063
Whoa!

494
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:24,927
Come on, what is this?

495
00:34:24,928 --> 00:34:26,149
Is this a car? Get out of here.

496
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,689
So this is happening all over the world?

497
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,948
People are playing mean
jokes on each other?

498
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,150
And breaking into
uncontrollable laughter.

499
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,081
And you're the only one who can stop it?

500
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:43,726
Yes. That is so awesome.

501
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,684
You wrecked my car.

502
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,329
You were, and I was like no, no, no.

503
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:57,089
I mean, that's what the guy
said, but how can I buy it?

504
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,883
I mean the whole place,
it doesn't even exist.

505
00:35:02,524 --> 00:35:03,357
Uh oh.

506
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,450
All because he ate one of
those stupid Gooey Chewy bars.

507
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,438
Wait. We ate them, too.

508
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:17,360
That's right.

509
00:35:19,886 --> 00:35:20,886
Ugh.

510
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:25,538
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

511
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,443
Cool. So we can all save the world.

512
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:32,603
Why am I not encouraged?

513
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:34,353
No, it'll be great.

514
00:35:36,943 --> 00:35:39,104
I'll have to get my own light saber.

515
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:41,837
- IQ...
- Wear my Tarantula Man PJs.

516
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:42,986
IQ, I don't think...

517
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:47,620
And I'll need, uh, my
Captain Universe shield.

518
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:49,235
- IQ.
- Then I'll thrust

519
00:35:49,236 --> 00:35:51,479
and aerial and jibber jab!

520
00:35:54,038 --> 00:35:55,359
- IQ.
- What?

521
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,130
I'll get better with practice.

522
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,833
Nice kitty.

523
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:03,707
Oh, oh?

524
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,250
You don't think we can do it?

525
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,837
Save the world?

526
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:16,650
An uncontrollable laughter

527
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:18,833
seems to be sweeping the world.

528
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,499
Laughter that is not just for fun,

529
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,450
but that appears to be just plain mean.

530
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,089
Reports indicate that it is...

531
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,090
Hey.

532
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:30,666
I like what you've done to the place.

533
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:33,249
And filters its way down.

534
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,196
That said, in the strange...

535
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,393
Save the world?

536
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,840
We can't even make a movie.

537
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:43,084
What's this?

538
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:43,920
- Well hello there.
- Me?

539
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:45,839
And welcome to secret agent

540
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,389
backpack orientation 2.4.

541
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,359
Among the various items
you'll learn to use

542
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,657
are our slow-mo explosive device.

543
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:57,089
What?

544
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,299
No way.

545
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,123
Our banana peel launcher.

546
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,839
I love bananas.

547
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,743
Our compulsory dancing disco ball.

548
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,959
Nice.

549
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Yeah.

550
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,283
Our latest and
greatest gizmo, the Invisobeam.

551
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:17,882
Invisobeam?

552
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:19,099
But I still see him.

553
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:21,631
Uh, still in development.

554
00:37:21,632 --> 00:37:23,090
Ah, gotcha.

555
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:23,924
Hm.

556
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,819
And of course our standard issue

557
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,776
video cell phones socks.

558
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:28,869
Cell phone socks?

559
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,729
This video will self-destruct

560
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,730
in five, four, three, two, one.

561
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,980
Uh one.

562
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,119
Bernard Dingledorf.

563
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,879
This is no movie.

564
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,257
It's the real thing and
we could see real heroes!

565
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,259
World leaders continue playing

566
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,499
their mean-spirited prank as they prepare

567
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,260
for the peace conference
in Paris.

568
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:20,329
Oh, oh, oh.

569
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,624
Oh.

570
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,217
Oh.

571
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,989
No one is sure where to
turn let alone seek help.

572
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,803
Somewhere out there, there has to be...

573
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,473
Hello?

574
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:42,646
Agent Dinkledorf.

575
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:44,653
Hey Bernie! It's for you.

576
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,478
Hello?

577
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,599
Oh. Hello?

578
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,739
Help us, Agent Dinkledorf.

579
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,519
The conference begins in 90 minutes.

580
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,436
I'm not an agent. I'm
just, I'm just a kid.

581
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:08,119
89 minutes!

582
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,987
It's all up to you.

583
00:39:14,662 --> 00:39:17,189
The world as we know it is over.

584
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,499
Unless we really could stop him.

585
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,896
Stop him?

586
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:22,730
Right.

587
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,730
Stop him.

588
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,982
We just need to have a plan.

589
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:27,893
Great.

590
00:39:27,894 --> 00:39:31,759
A plan.

591
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,740
Do we have a plan?

592
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,740
Maybe.

593
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,193
Rule number one, know your enemy.

594
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,930
Leonard Sebastian Horkelsnorken.

595
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,119
Dr. Chuckles?

596
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Child prodigy.

597
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,363
Check this out.

598
00:39:47,364 --> 00:39:49,169
At age eight, he invented
the big screen TV.

599
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,132
In middle school, the first cell phone.

600
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,209
That was him? I thought it was-

601
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,060
- That's what they want you to think.

602
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:58,703
The kids always made fun,
calling him geek-o-matic.

603
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,399
Voted most likely
to wear braces until age 73.

604
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,510
Later he earned 11 degrees at...

605
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,113
I can't tell, is that
MIT, Harvard or Yale?

606
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,070
Yes.

607
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,779
18 months later he presented
his greatest invention

608
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,809
to the National Academy of Sciences.

609
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,539
Solar power nose picker.

610
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,719
Unfortunately it had a little design flaw.

611
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,739
It slipped into reverse and became-

612
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,773
- A solar powered snot flicker.

613
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,233
Gross.

614
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:36,719
Yeah.

615
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,320
Making him the laughing
stock of the entire world.

616
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:48,489
So with everyone laughing,

617
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,899
he changed careers to become a clown.

618
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,312
If you can't beat 'em, you join 'em.

619
00:40:52,313 --> 00:40:53,146
At first he was the hit at

620
00:40:53,147 --> 00:40:54,710
the children's birthday parties.

621
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,683
It looks just like Fluffy.

622
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:06,660
After she got ran over.

623
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,553
I love you, Dr. Chuckles.

624
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:12,815
Aww.

625
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:15,893
Oh, oh, oh?

626
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:18,856
But then when he tried to
move up to the big league,

627
00:41:18,857 --> 00:41:22,026
to the circus, no one would take him.

628
00:41:27,657 --> 00:41:28,824
Oh, come on.

629
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,169
Nice kitty.

630
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,962
Nice kitty.

631
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:35,509
He just wasn't funny enough.

632
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,269
And that's when he finally cracked.

633
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,069
Went insane and vowed revenge,

634
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,619
determined to humiliate the world.

635
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,209
With mean humor.

636
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,429
So how's this all help us?

637
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,889
Maybe if you tried to reason with him.

638
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,879
Remind him what his good
type of humor could do.

639
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,555
Got to find him first.

640
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,969
Congratulations.

641
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,519
You've just won a year's supply

642
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,799
of lactose-free, sugar-free,

643
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,355
not to mention taste free...

644
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,509
Ice cream bars.

645
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,909
Are you okay?

646
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,853
No offense, but you look terrible.

647
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,030
Allergies.

648
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,534
May I come in?

649
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:35,535
Hm.

650
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,470
Mm.
Mmmm.

651
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,549
Do you have a cat?

652
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,619
Yeah, what's wrong?

653
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,489
A cat allergy.

654
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,243
I always break out in a
real bad case of claw marks.

655
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,400
But maybe you could come
outside, to my truck.

656
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,283
Make your selection there.

657
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,700
Okay.

658
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,083
Uh, Bernie?

659
00:43:06,943 --> 00:43:08,389
I'll be right back.

660
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,390
Right this way.

661
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,830
He looks a little pale.

662
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,259
Can't believe that worked.

663
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,379
- Wait, what?
- Hm?

664
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,943
Nothing.
Needs more sun.

665
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,433
Bernie!

666
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:24,433
Away we go!

667
00:43:27,823 --> 00:43:29,246
Come on, come on!

668
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:33,871
Oh, look.

669
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:35,153
Look at the children.

670
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,551
Would you like some ice cream?

671
00:43:36,552 --> 00:43:37,552
No!

672
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,805
I need to borrow this.

673
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:43,228
That's mine! Hey!

674
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:44,430
- I gotta take this.
- Hey.

675
00:43:44,431 --> 00:43:45,264
So sorry.

676
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:47,803
Our parents are gonna be mad!

677
00:43:47,804 --> 00:43:49,102
Come on, IQ!

678
00:43:49,103 --> 00:43:51,411
We have to catch up!

679
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:52,412
Bernie!

680
00:43:54,012 --> 00:43:55,403
Get your ice cream.

681
00:43:56,491 --> 00:43:57,764
Ugh.

682
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,025
Knock yourself out.

683
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:00,482
Bernie!

684
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:07,039
Bernie!

685
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,290
Hey, trouble over here.

686
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,962
Our city's finest.

687
00:44:12,963 --> 00:44:14,295
Help! Help me!

688
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:16,312
Please, please!
He's fine.

689
00:44:17,145 --> 00:44:18,145
Wait up!

690
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:24,793
We gotta go faster!

691
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:26,280
Come on, slowpokes.

692
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:27,226
Get back here!

693
00:44:27,227 --> 00:44:29,143
Where are you taking me?

694
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:31,197
We're gaining on him!

695
00:44:31,198 --> 00:44:34,076
You go left, I'll close in on the right.

696
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:35,353
Right!

697
00:44:35,354 --> 00:44:36,726
No, left!

698
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:37,687
What?

699
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:38,687
Go left!

700
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:41,412
Mine or yours?

701
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:42,898
It's the same thing!

702
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:44,256
Same thing?

703
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:47,465
Right here.

704
00:44:47,466 --> 00:44:48,749
Lens Cap!

705
00:44:49,594 --> 00:44:50,594
IQ!

706
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:52,762
Brace yourselves.

707
00:44:52,763 --> 00:44:54,044
You sure this is gonna work?

708
00:44:54,045 --> 00:44:55,316
Of course not.

709
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,662
Great.

710
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,888
Please don't, please don't.

711
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:00,498
Ready?

712
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:02,950
Steady.

713
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,305
If we die, you'll live to regret this!

714
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:09,813
What?

715
00:45:09,814 --> 00:45:10,647
What?

716
00:45:10,647 --> 00:45:11,552
What?

717
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:12,552
Oh.

718
00:45:39,996 --> 00:45:42,198
I think, I think...

719
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:43,546
I think I'll just...

720
00:45:43,547 --> 00:45:45,547
I'm just gonna sit down.

721
00:45:46,888 --> 00:45:48,555
Untie me.

722
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:52,681
Are you okay?

723
00:45:52,682 --> 00:45:53,515
Yeah.

724
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:55,175
Yeah, I'm good.

725
00:45:55,176 --> 00:45:56,709
IQ, what are you doing?

726
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,363
It was under the seat.

727
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,900
Come on.

728
00:46:02,737 --> 00:46:03,946
Come on. Go, go, go.

729
00:46:03,947 --> 00:46:05,480
I'm driving. Move over.

730
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,668
You guys, come on.

731
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,494
Nice and easy.

732
00:46:23,428 --> 00:46:25,139
- Where are we going?
- GPS.

733
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,649
I know what we are,
but where are we going?

734
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,109
GPS.

735
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,479
He was our only clue.

736
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,480
GPS.

737
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:32,183
- Great.
- GPS!

738
00:46:32,184 --> 00:46:33,419
Home. GPS.

739
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,077
I know where home is, I just...

740
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:38,899
Oh.

741
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,933
His home.
Mmhm.

742
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,980
IQ, you're a genius.

743
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:47,440
All right.

744
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:48,441
Here we go.

745
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,319
Now what?

746
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,433
Maybe they got
a key hidden somewhere?

747
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:57,638
Or we could try calling a locksmith.

748
00:47:00,076 --> 00:47:01,429
Or that.

749
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,419
Good afternoon, jokesters.

750
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,459
Today's security question is

751
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,919
what's the last thing to go through

752
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,693
a grasshopper's mind when
he hits the windshield?

753
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,909
You have 60 seconds.

754
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,229
Um, uh...

755
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,546
The last thing to go
through a grasshopper's mind-

756
00:47:15,547 --> 00:47:16,579
- Right, right.

757
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,560
Um.

758
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:18,769
I know, I know.

759
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,859
I bet this is going to leave a mark?

760
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,860
Really?

761
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,309
Your answer is incorrect.

762
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,117
You now have 41 seconds.

763
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:30,132
- Uh, uh-
- Think of something!

764
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:32,459
Well, I don't know, I
should've bought life insurance?

765
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,208
Oh, that's a lot better.

766
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,040
Incorrect. You have 32 seconds.

767
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:37,874
Uh...

768
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:39,441
So you wanna play chicken do you?

769
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:40,275
Clear the runway,

770
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:41,581
I'm coming in hot?

771
00:47:41,582 --> 00:47:42,859
Call the society for Prevention

772
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,138
of Cruelty to Insects?

773
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:46,360
Guys!

774
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:47,784
You have 12 seconds.

775
00:47:47,785 --> 00:47:49,384
I know, I know, I know!

776
00:47:49,385 --> 00:47:50,218
Butt!

777
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:51,051
Nine seconds.

778
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:52,009
- Can't you be any funnier?
- Can't you?

779
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:52,842
Butt.

780
00:47:52,843 --> 00:47:54,079
- But what?
- But what?

781
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,412
The last thing that goes through

782
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:57,319
a grasshopper's mind after hitting

783
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,699
the windshield is his butt.

784
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,969
Like your tushy.

785
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,619
That's correct.

786
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,090
What a crack up.

787
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,956
Please, enter.

788
00:48:08,957 --> 00:48:10,707
And don't forget to wipe your feet.

789
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,353
I said don't forget

790
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:16,970
to wipe your feet.
Oh!

791
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:19,903
Thank you.

792
00:48:19,904 --> 00:48:23,278
Okay?

793
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:25,601
I need to find that generator.

794
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:32,511
Which door?

795
00:48:33,352 --> 00:48:37,148
Not that one.

796
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:45,750
What'd you find, boy?

797
00:48:58,187 --> 00:48:59,924
Honestly, that is so fake-

798
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:03,081
Sorry!

799
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:12,741
Guys, I found something.

800
00:49:13,613 --> 00:49:14,446
Whoa.

801
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:16,823
Welcome to
the coaster experience.

802
00:49:16,824 --> 00:49:18,936
What did you do?

803
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:19,770
Cool!

804
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:21,399
Please
keep your hands and arms

805
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,009
inside the vehicle at all times.

806
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,010
A roller coaster.

807
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,116
IQ, don't.

808
00:49:27,117 --> 00:49:28,345
Come on!

809
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,426
Come on, Splat, let's go.

810
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:37,124
This'll be awesome.

811
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:40,171
Coaster departing in five,

812
00:49:40,172 --> 00:49:41,585
four,

813
00:49:41,586 --> 00:49:42,836
three,

814
00:49:42,837 --> 00:49:44,147
two,

815
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,148
one.

816
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:58,929
What the?

817
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:02,416
I told you,
keep your hands and arms

818
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,647
inside the vehicle at all times.

819
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:05,720
Splat, you okay, buddy?

820
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,576
Come on, Splat.

821
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:23,931
Warning, warning, warning.

822
00:50:23,932 --> 00:50:25,718
There are numerous humans.

823
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:27,886
There are numerous humans.

824
00:50:29,772 --> 00:50:31,271
Hello?

825
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:32,272
Hello?

826
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,220
Hello?

827
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,480
Anyone there?

828
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,313
Look out!

829
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:46,279
Road hog!

830
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,500
Bernie?

831
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:48,676
Use your signal!

832
00:50:53,641 --> 00:50:54,772
What are you doing?

833
00:50:54,773 --> 00:50:55,773
Checking.

834
00:50:57,364 --> 00:50:58,364
Hurry.

835
00:51:00,383 --> 00:51:02,550
Let's get 'em!

836
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:04,584
Cool!

837
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:05,964
Guys, we gotta go, we gotta go!

838
00:51:05,965 --> 00:51:07,013
Come on!

839
00:51:07,014 --> 00:51:08,913
Wrong way to Dr. Chuckles.

840
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:10,247
Why would I lie?

841
00:51:12,254 --> 00:51:14,276
Aw, nice kitty kitty ki-

842
00:51:14,277 --> 00:51:15,797
- Come on!

843
00:51:23,403 --> 00:51:25,419
What is this place?

844
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,829
Well, hi there.

845
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,579
Dr. Chuckles.

846
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,709
Present.

847
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,191
Where are you?

848
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:33,190
Where are we?

849
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:36,509
In a very special room.

850
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,219
You'll find out soon enough.

851
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,019
I must say I was very impressed with you

852
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,809
getting through my living
defenses and finding me.

853
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:44,872
Thanks. It wasn't that big of a-

854
00:51:44,873 --> 00:51:47,329
- I could really use you on my team.

855
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,369
- Team?
- You know, to help

856
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:53,370
with the little details, like,
you know, ruling the world.

857
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,399
We would never work for you.

858
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,403
Is there any pay?

859
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,889
There's nothing wrong with laughter.

860
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,790
Not if you're laughing with someone.

861
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:06,279
But if you're laughing at
them, that's just plain-

862
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,309
- Mean?

863
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:08,310
Right.

864
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,197
And my dad said that we should
honor and respect people-

865
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,031
- Blah blah blah blah.

866
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:15,629
Yes, your poor father, oh, oh.

867
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,543
Speaking of which, let's
check in on him, shall we?

868
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,639
And by the way your entire
school is under my powers.

869
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,409
The teachers have all gone crazy.

870
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,811
You free my dad, you jerk!

871
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,427
Excellent.

872
00:52:35,428 --> 00:52:36,569
What was that?

873
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,329
You tell me.

874
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,426
I'm not sure what
makes you such a creep,

875
00:52:41,427 --> 00:52:43,630
but it really seems to be working.

876
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:45,943
What's going on?

877
00:52:45,944 --> 00:52:47,469
Now who's being mean?

878
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:51,219
Your meanness is creating
your own special prison.

879
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,053
What?

880
00:52:52,054 --> 00:52:55,649
Your rudeness is no different
from my own comic genius.

881
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,849
You're not a comic genius.

882
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,799
You're a comic goofus.

883
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
Um guys...

884
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,759
If laughter was the best medicine,

885
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,478
your face would cure the world.

886
00:53:07,423 --> 00:53:09,756
Welcome to my insult room.

887
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:12,659
You can cry all you want.

888
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,164
There's no escaping...

889
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:18,493
Until, of course, you choose to join me.

890
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,853
Look at me, Doc.

891
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:30,030
Beat up, depressed, under
appreciated by Chuckles.

892
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:34,253
I just feel like my life
isn't going anywhere.

893
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:36,870
What should I do?

894
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:39,182
Oh.

895
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,182
What's bothering me?

896
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,863
It's the boss.

897
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,983
Oh sure. He, he acts
bad, but on the inside?

898
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,143
I worry he's too good to be bad.

899
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,079
What do you think?

900
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,699
Do you really think he's evil enough

901
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,043
to take over the whole world?

902
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:06,403
Exactly.

903
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,573
Do you know he once tried
to use his humor for good?

904
00:54:12,313 --> 00:54:13,646
Mm-hm.

905
00:54:13,647 --> 00:54:15,713
And that cat he's always doting on?

906
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:20,793
Anyone who loves animals can't be all bad.

907
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,530
Perhaps...

908
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,623
We need a new leader.

909
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,883
Someone more focused on being bad.

910
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,893
Someone intelligent.

911
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,660
Good-looking.

912
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:42,543
A real clown among clowns.

913
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,523
Now, who might that be?

914
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,581
Who could that be?

915
00:54:55,582 --> 00:54:57,099
Me!

916
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,533
It's me, you clown!

917
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:02,569
Yes.

918
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:08,649
Oh, I'm so glad you agree.

919
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,009
Well I really feel a lot better, Doc.

920
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,010
Thank you so much.

921
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:18,361
Oh.

922
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,973
Excuse me.

923
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,419
Wing Nut?

924
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,406
Get back and guard the insult room.

925
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:41,713
Now!

926
00:55:46,045 --> 00:55:48,519
Keep an eye on them.

927
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,520
Yes, sir.

928
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:56,519
What have we done?

929
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,429
We're no better than he is.

930
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,911
Just not as ugly.

931
00:56:01,031 --> 00:56:02,101
- IQ!
- IQ!

932
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,900
Guess we won't
be needing this anymore.

933
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,720
Your feet are ringing.

934
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:20,315
Hello?

935
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,389
It's for you.

936
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,223
Let me put it on sneaker phone.

937
00:56:29,025 --> 00:56:31,495
Secret Agent Dingledorf.

938
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:32,985
I told you, I'm not a...

939
00:56:32,986 --> 00:56:37,406
The leaders have
arrived in Paris.

940
00:56:44,823 --> 00:56:47,577
Woo-woo.

941
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:57,472
The conference begins within the hour.

942
00:56:59,862 --> 00:57:02,326
I told you from the start,
you've got the wrong person.

943
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,825
Oh, and your dad called.

944
00:57:04,826 --> 00:57:06,479
He wanted me to give you a message.

945
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,759
Something about...

946
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,787
Junk.

947
00:57:15,054 --> 00:57:18,395
Like we're ever gonna break out of here.

948
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:21,821
And what are you gonna do...

949
00:57:23,478 --> 00:57:24,478
If I don't?

950
00:57:26,174 --> 00:57:28,999
Don't you ever
get tired of being a nobody?

951
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,939
Everyone has value, son.

952
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,240
God, he doesn't make junk.

953
00:57:35,996 --> 00:57:36,996
Dad.

954
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,513
Junk.

955
00:57:38,514 --> 00:57:39,799
Junk.

956
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,053
God doesn't make junk.

957
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,668
You're getting pretty
good with all that stuff.

958
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,149
Did you see that?

959
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,150
Yeah.

960
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,159
Hey, IQ.

961
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,133
You know, you're one smart guy.

962
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:56,955
And you're a great judge of character.

963
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,559
Hey Lens Cap, did I ever tell you

964
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,759
what a great filmmaker you are?

965
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,447
Stop that.

966
00:58:03,448 --> 00:58:05,899
No, but I trust your opinion of me

967
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,909
since you're so smart and highly informed.

968
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,429
Highly informed?

969
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:11,354
I know what you're doing.

970
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:12,240
Sure.

971
00:58:12,241 --> 00:58:13,840
He's intelligent...

972
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:16,980
And a great friend.

973
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:19,599
Stop that!

974
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,859
Thanks.

975
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,469
You're a good friend, too.

976
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,468
We're all good friends.

977
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:26,105
And we're smart, too.

978
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:30,672
Come on, let's go.

979
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,065
Clown code red.

980
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:33,241
Clown code red.

981
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:34,701
Hurry, they're gaining.

982
00:58:34,702 --> 00:58:35,580
I'm trying!

983
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:37,826
The backpack,
anything else you got in there?

984
00:58:37,827 --> 00:58:41,859
Uh, laser nail Clippers,
rocket powered shoe laces.

985
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,532
Ooh, x-ray glasses.

986
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,180
Come on, any time.

987
00:58:50,956 --> 00:58:52,056
I love bananas.

988
00:58:52,971 --> 00:58:54,554
Come on.

989
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:57,421
You guys, come on.
Come on!

990
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:01,204
I thought it'd be a little more roomy.

991
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,473
Breath mints?

992
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,410
Anyone?

993
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,410
No thanks.

994
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:07,877
What?

995
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,560
Guys, ideas?

996
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,749
Anyone?

997
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,779
You said I was a great filmmaker.

998
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,613
Right?

999
00:59:15,613 --> 00:59:16,613
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1000
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,400
Play along with me here.

1001
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:23,357
Cut!

1002
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:24,358
Cut!

1003
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:25,359
Cut!

1004
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,461
Congratulations. You've
all passed the audition.

1005
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:30,420
What?

1006
00:59:30,421 --> 00:59:31,619
For the new reality show.

1007
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,670
They didn't tell you?

1008
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:34,534
Ugh.

1009
00:59:34,534 --> 00:59:35,510
Figures.

1010
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:38,328
Clowns Gone Wild on Nerdflix this fall.

1011
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:40,182
You're all gonna be stars.

1012
00:59:40,183 --> 00:59:41,749
Love that look, sweetheart.

1013
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,175
Don't change a thing.

1014
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:45,449
Okay everybody, gather
in for a group photo.

1015
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,498
Come on, let's go.

1016
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:49,138
The camera loves you, kid. Uh-huh.

1017
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:50,249
Yeah, keep it goin'.

1018
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,843
Yep, come on, there we go.

1019
00:59:51,844 --> 00:59:53,849
Nice and close. Okay.

1020
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:55,037
All set?

1021
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:56,038
And action.

1022
00:59:59,182 --> 01:00:00,182
Come on!

1023
01:00:02,727 --> 01:00:04,092
Aww.

1024
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:07,832
- Go, go, go.
- IQ!

1025
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,352
The backpack.

1026
01:00:09,353 --> 01:00:10,234
Make it melt!

1027
01:00:10,234 --> 01:00:11,234
Right.

1028
01:00:12,263 --> 01:00:13,263
Hurry.

1029
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,063
That'll work.

1030
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,980
Come on!

1031
01:00:32,268 --> 01:00:33,268
Whoa.

1032
01:00:42,884 --> 01:00:44,039
How do we shut it down?

1033
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,569
It's a bunch
of those giggle guns

1034
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:46,470
wired and parallel.

1035
01:00:46,471 --> 01:00:48,667
Making one giant super charged one.

1036
01:00:49,736 --> 01:00:51,992
If we can disconnect enough of them,

1037
01:00:51,993 --> 01:00:55,011
I bet we can disable it and...

1038
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:56,679
Chuckles.

1039
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,390
IQ!
I'm on it.

1040
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:03,903
Hurry!

1041
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:18,482
IQ, come on.
He's trying to get ahead.

1042
01:01:18,483 --> 01:01:20,529
Coming through!

1043
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:22,775
Bernie, go!

1044
01:01:25,591 --> 01:01:27,150
Where'd they go?

1045
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:28,930
IQ.

1046
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,193
Can they see me?

1047
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:33,193
Eh?

1048
01:01:50,372 --> 01:01:52,288
IQ, come on, I'm ahead of ya.

1049
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:54,023
He's right behind you! Look out!

1050
01:01:54,024 --> 01:01:57,829
IQ!

1051
01:01:59,543 --> 01:02:01,126
A little help here.

1052
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:05,809
Nice job, IQ.

1053
01:02:22,763 --> 01:02:25,458
Hey! Get down from there.

1054
01:02:25,459 --> 01:02:26,734
IQ!

1055
01:02:26,735 --> 01:02:27,735
Help!

1056
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:35,254
Bernie, catch!

1057
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:50,403
You're too late, Dingledork.

1058
01:03:08,186 --> 01:03:09,019
No.

1059
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,793
They'll never sign the treaty now

1060
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,303
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1061
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,370
Really?

1062
01:03:18,371 --> 01:03:20,999
Wait. What are you doing?

1063
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,600
You don't know what that can do.

1064
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:23,989
I have a pretty good idea.

1065
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,823
No, wait.

1066
01:03:24,823 --> 01:03:25,823
Listen, let's...

1067
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,361
Let's talk.

1068
01:03:28,362 --> 01:03:29,629
I think a good laugh
would be better, don't you?

1069
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,610
Wait, wait, please.

1070
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:31,610
No, no, listen.

1071
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,963
I hate laughter.

1072
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:41,789
I even tried to be funny
once, at the circus.

1073
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,013
We saw the pictures.

1074
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,660
People made fun of me,

1075
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,973
told me I was worthless.

1076
01:03:52,218 --> 01:03:53,699
No.

1077
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,973
Nobody's worthless.

1078
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,179
It was terrible.

1079
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:02,493
It was humiliating.

1080
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:06,014
I was good for nothing.

1081
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:06,848
No.

1082
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:08,183
God doesn't make junk.

1083
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:11,586
Maybe you were just
trying at the wrong place.

1084
01:04:11,587 --> 01:04:12,587
Hm.

1085
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,559
Yeah, dingleberry.

1086
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,579
Well I'm in the right place now.

1087
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,189
No, please, please.

1088
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:19,503
The world needs your ge-

1089
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,989
Is this how you want the
world to remember you?

1090
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:31,018
They must suffer they
way they made me suffer.

1091
01:04:34,927 --> 01:04:36,530
What are you doing?

1092
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:37,969
What is that?

1093
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:39,089
What are you doing?

1094
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,239
Hey.

1095
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,587
Let's see if we can make a big one.

1096
01:04:43,624 --> 01:04:45,956
Whoa!

1097
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:48,734
Look what you could do.

1098
01:04:48,735 --> 01:04:50,652
Look what you could do.

1099
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,929
No, they're just kids.

1100
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,113
Look at their joy.

1101
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,730
Look at the happiness you brought.

1102
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,413
This is who you are.

1103
01:05:07,689 --> 01:05:09,852
I love you, Dr. Chuckles.

1104
01:05:09,853 --> 01:05:11,953
I love you too, Princess.

1105
01:05:28,857 --> 01:05:29,857
Uh oh.

1106
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:35,438
This thing...

1107
01:05:48,307 --> 01:05:49,992
That makes it look like so

1108
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:53,619
and make it look just like this right here

1109
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,842
and all of a sudden then we have

1110
01:05:55,843 --> 01:05:58,218
a Dr. Chuckles clown pizza.

1111
01:05:58,219 --> 01:05:59,679
Yeah.
Don't listen to him, boss.

1112
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,985
It's a trick.

1113
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,709
It's a trick.

1114
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,053
He will humiliate you like all the others.

1115
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:11,021
You've got a gift.

1116
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,923
- I was a loser.
- Look.

1117
01:06:18,649 --> 01:06:19,940
Boss.

1118
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:20,941
Go.

1119
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:23,039
Now!

1120
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:37,849
Maybe it's the batteries.

1121
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:40,723
Uh oh.

1122
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,566
Everyone laughed at me.

1123
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:45,180
No.

1124
01:06:45,181 --> 01:06:46,981
The children were laughing with you.

1125
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:53,219
You should make a
generator that does that.

1126
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,069
People laughing with each other

1127
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:57,759
instead of at each other.

1128
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,023
You could save the world.

1129
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:11,389
That little brat.

1130
01:07:15,959 --> 01:07:18,646
Is he under there?
I don't see him.

1131
01:08:02,668 --> 01:08:04,369
Yes, yes, yes.

1132
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:05,413
Yes.

1133
01:08:07,446 --> 01:08:10,316
Warning, maximum
laughter overdrive engaged.

1134
01:08:10,317 --> 01:08:11,518
Oh?

1135
01:08:18,101 --> 01:08:20,598
Oh! That thing's gonna blow!

1136
01:08:20,599 --> 01:08:21,599
Go!

1137
01:08:25,294 --> 01:08:27,627
Clownin' around!

1138
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,040
Oh no!

1139
01:08:32,184 --> 01:08:36,298
We've got to get out of here!

1140
01:08:37,693 --> 01:08:38,693
No!

1141
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:50,862
- Wait.
- Huh?

1142
01:08:51,922 --> 01:08:53,060
I thought it was done.

1143
01:09:04,022 --> 01:09:06,030
Shut it down.

1144
01:09:06,031 --> 01:09:07,698
I can't, I can't..

1145
01:09:09,309 --> 01:09:11,232
Shut it down.

1146
01:09:18,169 --> 01:09:19,031
I can't stop.
I can't.

1147
01:09:19,032 --> 01:09:21,121
Shut it down!

1148
01:09:21,122 --> 01:09:25,207
I can't!

1149
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:28,622
Give it to me!

1150
01:09:42,453 --> 01:09:43,871
Huh?

1151
01:09:51,795 --> 01:09:54,030
I had
sense of humor for a moment.

1152
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:12,327
Huh?

1153
01:10:31,153 --> 01:10:32,059
You did it, boy.

1154
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,672
Good boy, good boy, you did it.

1155
01:10:33,673 --> 01:10:35,259
Good boy, you saved us all.

1156
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,260
Good boy.

1157
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:42,416
Nice to meet you.

1158
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:44,477
Thank you.

1159
01:10:47,385 --> 01:10:50,385
Other side, here.

1160
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,900
Wow.

1161
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,593
I had no idea.

1162
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,413
Imagine what could happen
if you used it for good.

1163
01:11:05,799 --> 01:11:06,639
No.

1164
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:07,473
But-

1165
01:11:07,474 --> 01:11:10,979
- Juggleheads, take away these children

1166
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,079
and let's begin our repairs.

1167
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,379
It's never too late to end
human civilization as we know it

1168
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,855
and to begin domin-

1169
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:19,388
- How does a farmer count cows?

1170
01:11:19,389 --> 01:11:20,309
Wait, what?

1171
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,023
How does a farmer count cows?

1172
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,798
With a cow-culator.

1173
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:31,433
Or uh, how about this one,

1174
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:33,874
what do ghosts have for dessert?

1175
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,882
I-scream!

1176
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:43,276
And...

1177
01:11:43,277 --> 01:11:44,819
Oh, this is a great one.

1178
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,459
What do you sea monsters have for lunch?

1179
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,509
I don't know, Bernie.
What do sea monsters eat?

1180
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,483
Fish and ships.

1181
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,849
I-scream, I get it now.

1182
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,009
See?

1183
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,860
See how good people feel with
the right type of laughter?

1184
01:12:02,755 --> 01:12:06,489
With your genius and the right
kind of humor, you could...

1185
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:07,840
I could change the world.

1186
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:10,430
For the good.

1187
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:17,526
- What?
- I ain't got one.

1188
01:12:17,527 --> 01:12:21,349
No, I got no phone.

1189
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:22,350
Hello?

1190
01:12:23,925 --> 01:12:25,205
They've got the pace surrounded.

1191
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,460
They want you to give yourself up.

1192
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:37,513
It could be a new
beginning for all of us.

1193
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,609
Don't listen to him.

1194
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,599
He's been tricked.

1195
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,341
Follow me.

1196
01:12:44,342 --> 01:12:47,821
I will be your new leader.

1197
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,154
I will...

1198
01:12:49,155 --> 01:12:50,040
Together, we will finish the revolution.

1199
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:55,040
Together, we will-

1200
01:12:55,973 --> 01:12:58,709
Ah, ah, get him off!

1201
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,879
My fellow jokesters,

1202
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,649
a new day is dawning, a
day where we no longer

1203
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:08,459
need to hide our true identity,

1204
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,789
a day where we can make
the world a better place

1205
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:14,143
by being who we were created to be.

1206
01:13:26,093 --> 01:13:29,093
Oh, god, that's my nose.

1207
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:34,603
All right,
come on, keep goin'.

1208
01:13:37,003 --> 01:13:39,680
Move it. Move it along.

1209
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:42,209
See you later, Bernie.

1210
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,308
Be sure to write.

1211
01:13:45,309 --> 01:13:47,417
Well done, Agent Dingledorf.

1212
01:13:47,418 --> 01:13:48,499
I told you I'm not an agent.

1213
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,808
Exactly, which is why
you're such a great secret.

1214
01:13:51,809 --> 01:13:52,983
You and your team.

1215
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,109
Team?

1216
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:57,110
For you.

1217
01:13:58,889 --> 01:14:02,949
And for you, Lens Cap.
Pretending to be an artist.

1218
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:04,531
Pretending?

1219
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:08,718
And you, Splat, are disguised as

1220
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,919
the poster dog for Overeater's Anonymous.

1221
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,129
Who's a good agent?

1222
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:16,739
And last but not least, for you, IQ,

1223
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,643
the brains behind the whole operation.

1224
01:14:19,965 --> 01:14:20,989
Cool clouds.

1225
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:24,369
All of you pretending to
be boring, everyday people.

1226
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,649
Which we are.

1227
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:26,650
Exactly.

1228
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,452
The victim has multiple
hats stretches to the face.

1229
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,800
Yes, the clown.

1230
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:36,909
Seriously, the clown.

1231
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,415
Allergies.

1232
01:14:45,244 --> 01:14:46,244
Hordikins!

1233
01:14:48,103 --> 01:14:50,023
My hero.
My muffin.

1234
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,649
I wanted to let you know
that one of those nice men

1235
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:57,603
in those nice suits asked
me to give you this.

1236
01:15:06,571 --> 01:15:07,967
Oh.

1237
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,696
The president wants to give me a medal.

1238
01:15:11,697 --> 01:15:12,697
A medal?

1239
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,269
For?

1240
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:17,593
For planning this
whole operation, silly.

1241
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:22,343
He's just the smartest
secret agent now, isn't he?

1242
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,607
Well, duty calls.

1243
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:29,779
Yep.
Um, we're

1244
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,749
- Nope.
- I, uh...

1245
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:32,750
Yeah.

1246
01:15:34,118 --> 01:15:35,285
Bern.

1247
01:15:36,389 --> 01:15:37,389
Dad!

1248
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:46,819
Hey, are you all right?
Is everything okay?

1249
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,362
Yeah. Yeah, you?

1250
01:15:49,313 --> 01:15:50,803
I couldn't be better.

1251
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,419
So guess what?

1252
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:01,920
The Secretary liked your idea.

1253
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:03,610
Idea?

1254
01:16:03,611 --> 01:16:05,039
Yeah, about Chuckles using his gift

1255
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,629
to make the world a better place.

1256
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,952
And if he does so, he
might only get probation.

1257
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:12,389
Boom.

1258
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:13,499
Let's go see the kids.

1259
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,563
Hey, come on, Splat.

1260
01:16:14,564 --> 01:16:15,397
Let's go.

1261
01:16:15,398 --> 01:16:17,718
The world can rest assured
that I have saved the day

1262
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:21,160
and as usual the agency that I work for

1263
01:16:22,374 --> 01:16:25,915
does not respect my abilities
and I should be promoted

1264
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:29,499
but they won't do it
because of politics...

1265
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:42,764
Come on.

1266
01:16:46,121 --> 01:16:47,371
Stupid English.

1267
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:55,463
Pick it up.

1268
01:16:55,464 --> 01:16:57,127
I'll break you.

1269
01:16:57,128 --> 01:16:58,213
Boom, boom, boom.

1270
01:16:58,214 --> 01:16:59,050
You talkin' to me?

1271
01:16:59,051 --> 01:17:00,100
See these right here?

1272
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,240
You talkin' to me?

1273
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,279
What are you doing here?

1274
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,293
Uh, I uh, I always take the shortcut.

1275
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,509
What are you doing?

1276
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:25,823
Working on a stupid
paper for stupid English.

1277
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,019
Doesn't sound so bad.

1278
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,419
Well not for you.

1279
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,420
You're smart.

1280
01:17:45,809 --> 01:17:48,893
I get another F, my dad's gonna kill me.

1281
01:17:50,616 --> 01:17:51,623
I'm such a loser.

1282
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:58,844
Well, maybe I could,
you know, help you out.

1283
01:18:01,864 --> 01:18:03,220
What?

1284
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:06,243
Well like you said, this
stuff comes easy for me.

1285
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,160
What's it on?

1286
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:10,782
Um, heroes.

1287
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:13,569
- Heroes?
- Yeah.

1288
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,263
Like those guys that saved the
World Peace Conference thing.

1289
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:22,980
Uh, yeah. I could
give you some pointers.

1290
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:30,058
You know, it doesn't
have to be hot shots.

1291
01:18:30,059 --> 01:18:34,043
It can be a normal, everyday people, too.

1292
01:18:35,139 --> 01:18:36,449
Right.

1293
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:37,769
Yeah.

1294
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:40,579
Even um, know-nothing twerps that help

1295
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,943
other guys out with schoolwork and stuff.

1296
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:46,910
Thanks.

1297
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,669
But never mention it.

1298
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:51,133
- Right.
- To no one.

1299
01:18:51,134 --> 01:18:52,134
Okay.

1300
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:54,933
Ever.

1301
01:18:54,934 --> 01:18:55,934
Got it.

1302
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:18,250
No.

1303
01:19:18,251 --> 01:19:20,673
Nope. I'm not doing it anymore.

1304
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,737
I'm done.

1305
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,020
Hello?

1306
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:41,499
Oh.

1307
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,333
Hello?

1308
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:44,319
Agent Dingledorf, hurry.

1309
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,320
Get in the car.

1310
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,267
What car? I don't see a car.

1311
01:19:48,268 --> 01:19:49,941
Oh.

1312
01:19:49,942 --> 01:19:50,942
Sorry.

1313
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,246
Hang on, hang on.

1314
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:55,210
Whoa.

1315
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,410
Get back, back, back, back, back, back.

1316
01:19:58,411 --> 01:19:59,295
Get back.

1317
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:01,191
And forward.

1318
01:20:01,192 --> 01:20:02,499
Okay, here we go.

1319
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,500
And, nope.

1320
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,819
There we go.

1321
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:08,760
No.

1322
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:10,134
Yeah. There we go.

1323
01:20:10,135 --> 01:20:11,943
Hold on, hold on.

1324
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:13,921
Just, and...

1325
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,713
Okay, stand still.

1326
01:20:15,714 --> 01:20:18,419
No, no me. You stand...

1327
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,992
Okay.

1328
01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:22,889
There we go.

1329
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,278
Hurry Agent Dingledorf.

1330
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:28,002
- Shh!
- Oh, sorry.

1331
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:29,003
Hurry.

1332
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,829
Who's driving?

1333
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:39,888
Not me.

1334
01:20:39,889 --> 01:20:41,649
Agent 001/2, is that you?

1335
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:43,929
Yes, it isn't me.

1336
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:45,909
You mean no it isn't you?

1337
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:49,339
I mean, yes, it's no that it's not yes.

1338
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,549
Who am I talking to?

1339
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:51,410
Nobody.

1340
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:54,549
So I'm talking to
nobody who isn't driving?

1341
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,839
You're getting very good

1342
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,718
at this secret agent thing.

1343
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:58,666
Says who?

1344
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:00,509
Not me.

1345
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:03,782
Agent Dingledorf, your
country desperately needs you.

1346
01:21:05,571 --> 01:21:08,209
I have school, a spelling test.

1347
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:09,043
If we don't hurry,

1348
01:21:09,044 --> 01:21:10,993
there'll be no words left to spell.

1349
01:21:13,008 --> 01:21:14,332
Well?

1350
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:15,968
All right.

1351
01:21:15,969 --> 01:21:17,850
But seriously, this has
to be the very last-

1352
01:21:17,851 --> 01:21:21,190
Time!

1353
01:21:21,191 --> 01:21:24,244
Wherever evil lurks, wherever it may hide,

1354
01:21:24,245 --> 01:21:28,558
it is time to unmask it and
reveal truth to the world.

1355
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:31,179
It's time to right the world's wrongs

1356
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,819
and fight injustice wherever it may lie.

1357
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,229
To help the downtrodden and depressed,

1358
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,619
using all our abilities to
make the world a better place.

1359
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,631
Of honor and respect for all.

1360
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:43,975
Cut, cut!

1361
01:21:43,976 --> 01:21:45,393
Cut!

1362
01:21:56,132 --> 01:21:58,088
Let's dance.

1363
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:02,371
Come on, everybody. Let's celebrate.

1364
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,180
Nice. Let's do it.

1365
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:15,105
♪ My milkshake boys are
coming to the yard ♪

1366
01:22:21,809 --> 01:22:23,610
Stop being funny, this is serious.

1367
01:22:24,462 --> 01:22:25,462
Ah!

1368
01:22:26,832 --> 01:22:27,832
Ah!

1369
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:29,820
My hiccups are gone.

1370
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:33,103
Brace for it.

1371
01:22:36,412 --> 01:22:37,801
That was the thing.

1372
01:22:37,802 --> 01:22:38,802
Didn't work.

1373
01:22:39,672 --> 01:22:40,505
Cut.

1374
01:22:40,506 --> 01:22:41,773
Lead camera only, marker.

1375
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:47,679
I feel accomplished.

1376
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,419
All right, let's try and get this perfect.

1377
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,046
We're making this super cool movie

1378
01:22:51,047 --> 01:22:53,990
and Bernie plays a Bonzo
superhero and we're...

1379
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:56,865
Sorry, can I go from the top.

1380
01:22:56,866 --> 01:22:57,853
I don't know what I did there.

1381
01:22:57,854 --> 01:22:59,334
Adam, if you
could just do the shot.

1382
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:01,590
Hurry!

1383
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:14,899
It's possible the bar you ate

1384
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:18,563
was especially crafted to
get the dialogue wrong.

1385
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,493
It's a bunch of those Google guns.

1386
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:24,530
Sorry.

1387
01:23:26,157 --> 01:23:27,739
Did I say Google guns?

1388
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:30,213
Just remember I'm the
actor and you follow me.

1389
01:23:31,525 --> 01:23:33,529
- I follow no one.
- You follow no one.

1390
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,080
Actually, that's a good answer.

1391
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:39,218
It's bunch of those Google
guns wired and parallel.

1392
01:23:39,219 --> 01:23:41,189
Making one super...

1393
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:43,539
Making one giant, supercharged one.

1394
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,973
Yeah.

1395
01:23:44,974 --> 01:23:46,521
You said Google gun again.

1396
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,129
I did?

1397
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,799
Sensors are indicating that Dr. Chuckles

1398
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,829
is preparing to destroy the gener-

1399
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,223
Not destroy it, to fire it.

1400
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,709
I feel like we've done
this dialogue before.

1401
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:57,621
Yeah. Deja vu.

1402
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,370
It's a bunch of those Goog-

1403
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,123
Now I think about it.

1404
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,468
A clown who plans to destroy

1405
01:24:08,469 --> 01:24:10,729
the World Peace Conference using this

1406
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:15,589
diabolical military
dialogue written for me

1407
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,138
which I don't remember!

1408
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:19,044
Hey, mister.

1409
01:24:19,045 --> 01:24:22,145
Mister.

1410
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,214
Cut.

1411
01:24:27,215 --> 01:24:28,911
- Yeah, you're-
- Oh.

1412
01:24:28,912 --> 01:24:29,918
Hey mister!

1413
01:24:29,919 --> 01:24:32,626
Mister! You dropped your...

1414
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,888
To reach every cell phone in the world

1415
01:24:36,889 --> 01:24:39,103
so each and every citizen-

1416
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:40,960
Farts!

1417
01:24:42,707 --> 01:24:43,540
You wanna go back a little bit?

1418
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,540
Yeah, that was good.

1419
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,665
Let's go back to the, uh, top.

1420
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:53,379
The secret warehouse
and weapons headquarters

1421
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,213
of the notorious-

1422
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:55,399
Sorry. One more time.

1423
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,360
The secret warehouse and weapons...

1424
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,602
Headquarters.

1425
01:24:59,603 --> 01:25:00,436
I don't know why I can't remember that.

1426
01:25:00,436 --> 01:25:01,269
Okay.

1427
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:03,111
Sorry, can I start over again?

1428
01:25:03,112 --> 01:25:04,479
Ah, sorry.

1429
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,109
Yeah, sorry about that.

1430
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:08,218
Sebastian Horkelsnorken.

1431
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:09,170
Can we go again?

1432
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:11,109
Hey, is your nose okay?
You like punched it.

1433
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:11,950
I'm sorry.

1434
01:25:11,951 --> 01:25:13,300
I'll grab it from the side.

1435
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:21,013
I slipped.

1436
01:25:21,014 --> 01:25:22,367
Are you okay?

1437
01:25:28,744 --> 01:25:31,497
Oh gosh.

1438
01:25:31,498 --> 01:25:32,331
Sorry.

1439
01:25:32,332 --> 01:25:33,880
I accidentally, I tapped him...

1440
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,354
Z marker.

1441
01:25:38,355 --> 01:25:42,349
Um, I think it's his uh,
initials, so it's weird.

1442
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:43,599
Wait, what?

1443
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,460
See?

1444
01:25:44,461 --> 01:25:46,009
- Ber-
- I'm dumb.

1445
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,446
- Nie.
- Yeah.

1446
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:55,949
This is the best your
career will ever be

1447
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,297
right here in this moment.

1448
01:25:57,298 --> 01:25:58,699
Look at me.

1449
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,143
You're probably gonna be the
biggest star in the world

1450
01:26:00,144 --> 01:26:01,619
and you're gonna remind me I said that.

1451
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,736
- Yeah, I will.
- Oh, I already hate you.

1452
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:04,859
I'm gonna go back, I'm
gonna find your address

1453
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,356
and I'm gonna say remember
when you said this?

1454
01:26:07,357 --> 01:26:08,190
Remember when-

1455
01:26:08,191 --> 01:26:09,599
Find my address?

1456
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,137
That's already the creepiest
thing you've said today.

1457
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:16,140
A solar powered snot flicker.

1458
01:26:16,141 --> 01:26:17,492
That's funny.

1459
01:26:17,493 --> 01:26:19,910
A solar powered snot flicker.

1460
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,652
That's weird.

1461
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:25,370
Ooh.

1462
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:26,903
X-ray glasses.

1463
01:26:29,397 --> 01:26:30,250
Can we do it again?

1464
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:32,029
Rocket powered shoe laces.

1465
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:32,889
Ooh.

1466
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:34,093
X-ray glasses.

1467
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:41,879
Why are they, like, so weird?

1468
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,697
They're, oh, I felt the wrong one.

1469
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,379
Really? Another mission?

1470
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,887
Cool.

1471
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:02,671
Yeah, dingleberry, I'm in the right...

1472
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,923
Sorry about that.

1473
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:11,260
We're rolling. Still rolling.

1474
01:27:11,261 --> 01:27:12,735
Still rolling!

1475
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:28,790
You okay?

1476
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:31,339
Got something in your eye?
Nope.

1477
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:32,340
Just bad acting.

1478
01:27:44,019 --> 01:27:45,979
- Muffin.
- My hero.

1479
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:48,019
- I stepped on your line.
- Yeah.

1480
01:27:54,356 --> 01:27:55,356
Oh.

1481
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,707
My hero, rolling.

1482
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:01,233
I was just, I was ripping.

1483
01:28:10,343 --> 01:28:14,503
He's just the smartest
secret agent now, isn't he?

1484
01:28:18,062 --> 01:28:19,062
Oh.

1485
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,260
Where are we going from?

1486
01:28:29,261 --> 01:28:30,484
Are we good to keep going?

1487
01:28:30,485 --> 01:28:31,318
Cut!

1488
01:28:31,318 --> 01:28:32,151
Cut!

1489
01:28:32,151 --> 01:28:32,984
Cut!

1490
01:28:32,985 --> 01:28:36,087
Cut, cut, cut!

1491
01:28:36,088 --> 01:28:38,479
It's a wrap!

1492
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,699
They'll be showing this movie

1493
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,153
in film schools, you know that, right?
