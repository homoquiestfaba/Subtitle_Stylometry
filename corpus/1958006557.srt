1
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,480
No, Dad, no.

2
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,615
Hey!

3
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,583
-You killed Mom!
-It wasn't my fault!

4
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:57,417
-You killed Mom!
-You know what?

5
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,515
Ami?

6
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,766
<i>♪ Just have to let go ♪</i>

7
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,434
Okay.

8
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,905
Jason Voorhees,
Freddy Krueger, and Chucky.

9
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,239
Oh, come on.

10
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,710
Okay, marry Freddy,

11
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:32,479
kill Jason,
and that leaves fuck Chucky?

12
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,015
Yeah, fuck Chucky.

13
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:37,417
Well, you go then.

14
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,722
Marry Jason,
kill Jason, fuck Jason.

15
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:41,989
In that order.

16
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:44,391
Both of y'all
are dead to me.

17
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:53,467
Bert, I swear, dude,
if you spill again,

18
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,770
I'm coming back there and
I'm gonna strangle you myself.

19
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,448
Don't tickle me!

20
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,318
Oh, God.

21
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,587
My lady.

22
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,522
Aw, you're so sweet.

23
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,289
That's me.

24
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,498
Uh.

25
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,968
So, where should we go first?

26
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,537
Oh, I wonder if that one
burger place is open.

27
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,606
-Uh, what's it called?
-Henry's.

28
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,406
Dude, that place had
the best shakes.

29
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,509
Good one.

30
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,943
That sounds like a plan,

31
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:37,845
but I think first we should
grab a few things

32
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,412
before heading out
to the cabin.

33
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,782
Yeah, that's smart.

34
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:41,916
Meet back here in 30 minutes?

35
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,718
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

36
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,686
Let's go, boy.

37
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,089
Uh, sure, let's go.

38
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,724
So what?

39
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,324
You just want us wait here?

40
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,694
Come on, Leyla,
let's go look around

41
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,428
and see what's still here
after all these years.

42
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,032
Well, I don't know
about you ladies,

43
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,901
but I have to change my shirt

44
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:01,969
because certain somebodies
can't keep it in their pants.

45
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,704
Okay, Bert.

46
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,405
Yeah, just come find us
when you're done, okay?

47
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,675
Hey, Leyla,
this taco's for you.

48
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,777
Oh, fuck you, Bert.

49
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,546
Bert!
All right, you know what?

50
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,413
- Why don't you stay by the car?
- Oh, yeah.

51
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,383
Yeah, it's good to be back.

52
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,786
Fuck, man.
Why did you drag me into this?

53
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,087
I don't wanna go
shopping with you.

54
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,455
Cory, I know
you hate shopping, bro.

55
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,694
Look, we've grown close
over the years as brothers.

56
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:29,530
You look at me as, like,
your blood brother, right?

57
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,732
After what we've been through?

58
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:32,834
Like, yeah, you're more
than a step brother.

59
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,535
Why are you being weird?

60
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,139
Oh, fuck.
Is that what I think it is?

61
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,439
Sure is, bro.

62
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,342
-It's long overdue.
-Yeah, you think?

63
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,613
And I need
my best man to help me.

64
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,050
All right, is this
going to be all for you today?

65
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,651
- That's it.
- All right, just $5.

66
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,490
All right.
Y'all have a great day.

67
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,826
Enjoy that.

68
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,994
- Tell everyone I said hi.
- Will do.

69
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,738
Well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

70
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,074
Oh, my God.
Is that you, Annie?

71
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,943
You still fucking work here.

72
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:18,746
Hey, watch your mouth.
My daughter's right here.

73
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,715
Okay.

74
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,415
Oh, my God.

75
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,719
How are you two?
I haven't seen y'all--

76
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:27,788
what, since
high school graduation?

77
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,557
How have you been, Annie?

78
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,158
Um, I'm okay.

79
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,994
Mommy, who are they?

80
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:34,829
Don't point, baby.
It's not polite.

81
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,764
Do you remember all those
pictures I showed you of me

82
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,599
in my high school uniform?

83
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:41,602
Well, these two... ladies,
were on the same team as me.

84
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:44,437
-This is Jennifer and Leyla.
-Hi.

85
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,073
Leyla was the one
I told you about.

86
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,175
Who stole
my high school boyfriend

87
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,710
and my homecoming queen title.

88
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,779
Oh, my God.

89
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,480
Still haven't let
that one go, hey?

90
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,049
Oh, come off it, Leyla.

91
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,551
You got everything
so easy in high school.

92
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,754
You got off scot-free
with everything.

93
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,055
You know
you stole Cory from me.

94
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,890
The two of you were pure evil.

95
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,959
And you,
you just let it happen.

96
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:07,194
Annie, come on.
That was forever ago.

97
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,763
We were just kids.

98
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,164
Look, Leyla's
a different person now.

99
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,833
She's grown up. So have I.

100
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,870
I work as a social worker with
addicts at an Austin hospital

101
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,605
and Leyla's
a registered nurse there.

102
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:18,806
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

103
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,174
I help people now, Annie.

104
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,109
That's more than
you can say for yourself.

105
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:24,211
Yeah, super mature, Leyla.

106
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,813
So what?

107
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,582
You two are big city girl,
career girls now?

108
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,584
Is that what's going on?
You forgot where you came from?

109
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:34,221
Beats sitting around
the same dusty old shop

110
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,490
15 years later with no future.

111
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:40,661
You will probably die
at that counter one day.

112
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:42,663
-Leyla.
-No, it's okay, Jen.

113
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,464
Let's let the has-been talk.

114
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,767
Same old story.
She peaked in high school.

115
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,468
We know she's never gonna
amount to anything.

116
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,739
- I've amounted plenty.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:55,142
You know what?
You break it, you buy it.

118
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,811
- Hey.
- You got it?

119
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,279
Is that little Annie Eastman?

120
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,880
Oh, dude!

121
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,782
Oh, shit.

122
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,284
Oh, for fuck's sake.

123
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,485
Bert, you clumsy oaf.

124
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:07,588
You will have to buy it,

125
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,156
since you probably broke it.

126
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,725
Isn't that right, Annie?

127
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,829
$1,000? For this?

128
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,564
You've got to be joking.

129
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,632
It's never been opened.
You clearly damaged it.

130
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,135
It's just a little scratch.
Maybe I could un-scratch it.

131
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,303
No!

132
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,604
No.

133
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,574
Pay up first.

134
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,310
I'm sorry.
I only have $200.

135
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,878
I don't have 1,000.

136
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,980
For God's sake, Bert.

137
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,949
Don't apologize to her.

138
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,951
That's probably
how she makes all her money

139
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,286
out of this dustbin.

140
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,890
Scams putting unsuspecting
travelers out of their money.

141
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:46,560
No one would actually buy
anything from this dump.

142
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,262
What?

143
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,764
You know what, Bert?

144
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,866
$200 actually
sounds pretty good.

145
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,769
I'm serious. $200.

146
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,137
You can take
the damn thing with you.

147
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:58,339
It gives me the creeps anyway.

148
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,641
But you said
it's one of a kind,

149
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,044
and I wouldn't even know
what to do with it.

150
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:04,645
Well, you know,
it's fine, it's just--

151
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,813
Annie, be smart, girl.

152
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,283
It's okay, Papa.
I got this.

153
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,785
I got this, it's fine.

154
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:14,688
Seriously, Bert, $200 is fine.
We'll be right as rain.

155
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:18,159
Again, I'm really sorry.

156
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:21,228
Thanks for letting me off
for only 200.

157
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:24,799
So, uh, Annie, you have
any newcomers around here?

158
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,068
Or is it just as quiet
as when we were kids?

159
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:30,571
Not too long ago, a family
bought the old Cutter farm.

160
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:32,973
But they didn't last very long.

161
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,809
They left pretty quickly
after they realized

162
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,177
the land wasn't worth anything

163
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,611
and they couldn't grow
anything on it.

164
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,346
That creepy piece of land?

165
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,248
Isn't it haunted by some curse?

166
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,918
It was tainted by
a bunch of Satan worshipers.

167
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,953
People still see
the carvings in the trees.

168
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,823
No, the Cutters
were a bunch of idiots

169
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,758
who couldn't take care
of their land.

170
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,093
Now look at it.

171
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,661
Cows can't even graze on it.

172
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,665
Well, if that's everything,

173
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,700
now feel free to get
the fuck out of my shop.

174
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:04,071
Nothing would make me happier.

175
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,639
-Oh, I'm sure, honey.
-What?

176
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,175
Are you going
to the reunion, Annie?

177
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,777
That's why we're all back.

178
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,011
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

179
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:12,980
Okay.

180
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,260
Well, what's in it?

181
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,394
-I don't know.
-Open it up!

182
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:28,863
It's never been opened before.

183
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,030
Well, then fuckin'
open it, bud.

184
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,165
Open up.

185
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,802
Come on, big money.

186
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,773
Oh, this is rubbish!

187
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,010
200 bucks for a fucking bear?

188
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,179
Way to go.
What a waste of money.

189
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,814
I'll tell you
what a waste of money is,

190
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,716
that new wave medicine
that nobody wants.

191
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,418
Fuck you, inbreed.

192
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,221
Cory, hey, rude.
Apologize to Bert right now.

193
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,856
No, it's okay, Jen.

194
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,424
That's the best
that Cory can come up with

195
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,994
since he's basically
special needs anyway.

196
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,362
Isn't that right, Gory Cory?

197
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,097
I told you
not to fucking call me that.

198
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,365
-Hey, enough. Enough.
-Hey, hey.

199
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,966
-Come on, guys.
-Stop. Enough.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,968
Come on. Calm down.

201
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,303
We came here
to have a good time,

202
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,905
and that's what
we're going to do.

203
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,141
This is too much drama for me.

204
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,910
That's calling
the kettle black, Leyla.

205
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:19,914
Sure, Aaron.
I'll chill.

206
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,482
Let's go.

207
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,184
But you better watch
those comments of yours, Cory.

208
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,353
Come on, bro.
All right?

209
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,225
Hey, you're going too fast.

210
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,794
Hey, backseat driver, zip it.

211
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,063
Oh, fuck.

212
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,464
Way to fucking go, bro.

213
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,774
Hey, Gibson.
Go around the back.

214
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:47,875
10-4.

215
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,849
I got this, guys.

216
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,222
Yes, Officer?

217
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,991
Uh, I'm not an officer.
I'm a sheriff.

218
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,760
-Oh, my bad.
-There's a big difference.

219
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:11,065
Anyway, you have any idea
how fast you were going?

220
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,833
Uh, no, sir.

221
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,270
-Was I speeding?
-Oh, yeah.

222
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:20,941
We're 25 'round here,
we clocked you at about 53.

223
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,112
Yeah, you were going
kind of fast there, pal.

224
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:28,048
Uh, you might hit somebody,
hurt somebody.

225
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,854
Gimme your driver's license
and registration.

226
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,258
And IDs from everybody
in this car.

227
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,959
We didn't do anything wrong.

228
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:40,528
Why have you stopped us?

229
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:42,162
I didn't ask you anything
so you shouldn't talk to me.

230
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,331
Okay.

231
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,270
-There you go, Sheriff.
-All right.

232
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:51,905
I got it.

233
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,909
Fucking prick.

234
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,878
Hey, long time no see, Leyla.

235
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,313
Hi, Danny. How are you?

236
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,814
- I'm doing good.
- Long time, man.

237
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,349
Yeah, how y'all doing?

238
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,251
Y'all in town
for the reunion, I assume?

239
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,090
Okay, listen, I'll let you go

240
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,392
with a warning
this time, all right?

241
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,493
- Okay.
- Thank you, Sheriff.

242
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,028
Sure, sure, sure.

243
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:14,995
Just slow down
next time, would you?

244
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,598
Yes, sir. My bad.

245
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:18,165
You guys have
a good afternoon, all right?

246
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,333
All right, you too, Sheriff.

247
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,502
Thank you, Your Honor.

248
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,247
- Here we go.
- Okay, let's see.

249
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,382
Welcome to my humble house!

250
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,519
- God.
- Go, Bert.

251
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:40,988
I'm carrying a lot of shit,
guys, come on.

252
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,126
Unbelievable.

253
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,195
Those motherfuckers
were supposed to remodel

254
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,497
this entire house
before we got here.

255
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,200
- Leyla.
- What?

256
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,369
-It's fine.
-You're kidding me, right?

257
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,338
It's-- it's got some--

258
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:58,606
it's got some character.

259
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,207
Yeah, Leyla.

260
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,010
It's a-- it's a really
manly man's place.

261
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,479
Real butch. Hoorah.

262
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,014
Fuck off, okay?

263
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,985
So that means it's time to go
back to Austin, right, guys?

264
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,521
You're not helping. Okay?

265
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:15,923
I'm kidding, Leyla.
It's fine!

266
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,425
- It's a mess.
- The place is fine.

267
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,394
It's only for a couple of days.

268
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,962
Sure.

269
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,134
-Leyla.
-What?

270
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,470
It's a nice place.

271
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:31,939
Come on, sweetheart.

272
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,073
Yeah, just-- just go ahead.

273
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,174
Let's go find our room.

274
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,143
Just go ahead.

275
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,514
So, uh...

276
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:42,082
where's our room?

277
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,183
Back off, Cory.

278
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,952
Back off, okay?

279
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,286
It's ladies only.

280
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,190
Well, hey, Bert,
you're invited, then.

281
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:53,994
Hey, uh, Leyla.

282
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,963
Where do you want your shit?

283
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,064
Just leave it there, okay?

284
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:58,932
I'm not in the mood right now.

285
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,033
Thank you.

286
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,102
You're welcome, your Majesty.

287
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:03,971
Oh, hey.

288
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,141
Fuck you.

289
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:10,070
Come on.

290
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,239
Any luck, Bert?

291
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,743
Not much today, but I'm--
I'm still hopeful.

292
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,111
Damn.

293
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,714
So, Aaron,
it's been a while, man.

294
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,348
When are you gonna
finally propose?

295
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,351
It's all in the timing, my guy.

296
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:28,255
Besides,
I'm not gonna drop any hints

297
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,225
with the biggest gossip
since high school around.

298
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,427
Do you really think
I don't have the self-control

299
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,362
- to hide it from Jennifer?
- No.

300
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,632
Well, you did tell us
about Cory's penis.

301
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,366
- What?
- What'd you say?

302
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,704
I did not!
Tell him you're lying.

303
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:44,506
She said it was cute.

304
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:47,107
Similar to how a sorority girl
reacts to a Chihuahua.

305
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,711
Fucking end you, bud.

306
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,212
Oh, good one, Gory Cory.

307
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,348
Hey, come on, guys.

308
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,085
Damn, can't y'all get along
just for one weekend?

309
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,788
And after that, you don't have
to see each other ever again.

310
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,591
Just calm down.

311
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:05,292
Okay, boys.

312
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:09,697
Let Aaron have his practice
kissing the bride.

313
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:12,366
- Leyla.
- What?

314
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,467
I'm not proposing.

315
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,436
Not yet, Johnson.

316
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,373
And you, sir, messed up my tan.

317
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,108
Let's go.

318
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:24,344
Give them space.

319
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,413
It's still funny.

320
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,346
Oh, Jesus.

321
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,837
You all right?

322
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,773
Are you gonna help a lady up?

323
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:29,744
Certainly.

324
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,112
Come here.

325
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:35,750
There you go.

326
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,318
Well, thank you.

327
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,825
What are you doing honking at
somebody jogging down the road?

328
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,461
Well, I'm sorry,
'cause, uh...

329
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,631
I wasn't trying to scare you.

330
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,199
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

331
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,534
I just--
I recognized you.

332
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:55,335
I haven't seen you
in a while.

333
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,604
Yeah, it's been a minute.

334
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:58,405
It's been a very long minute.

335
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:01,643
So what do you want?

336
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:05,479
-I wanna make sure you're okay.
-I'm fine.

337
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:07,749
I'm running between
two fields in the daylight.

338
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,149
Yeah, well...

339
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,285
crazy things can happen
in the daylight.

340
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:13,755
That's true.

341
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:18,893
Um, listen,
you know, if you're...

342
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,596
I could turn them lights on...

343
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:25,900
and give you a mobile escort,
wherever you're going.

344
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,735
I'm pretty sure
I know the way home.

345
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,369
Yeah, I guess you do.

346
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,741
If you're hurt
when you fell down,

347
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,375
I'll put you in
and give you a ride.

348
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,712
Well, luckily for me,
I'm perfectly good.

349
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,581
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:41,816
Yeah, I can see that.

351
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:45,653
Well, you know what?
You know where I'm at.

352
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,522
-Yeah, I do.
-Sheriff.

353
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,757
I see that.

354
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,528
Maybe one day
you'll stop by and...

355
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,631
chase each other
around the room again.

356
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:05,338
Not tonight.

357
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:17,652
I guess that means maybe
tomorrow is a possibility?

358
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,292
See you later, honey.

359
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,842
So, how do you feel
about being back home?

360
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:42,910
It's fine, I guess.

361
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,646
I don't know, Aaron.

362
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,748
I just--

363
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,584
coming back to Junction
brings back good memories,

364
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,485
but I never liked it here.

365
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,588
I just feel like
I shouldn't be here.

366
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:56,624
Babe, that's normal.

367
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,694
I mean, I feel weird
about this place, too.

368
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:02,797
It's strange, after all these
years, it's still the same.

369
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,500
I was always anxious
in Junction.

370
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,636
My anxiety came back
as soon as we got here.

371
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:13,040
Come on, babe.
Let's go enjoy the sunshine.

372
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:14,374
Uh, no.

373
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,444
I'd burn so fast,
I'd look like Freddy Krueger.

374
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,546
And?

375
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,447
I like me some Freddy Krueger.

376
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:22,583
I'd still love you.

377
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,320
In fact,
I still remember that one year

378
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,389
where you had
that godawful acne.

379
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:32,760
Wow.

380
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:35,563
You know, you always say
the sweetest things to me.

381
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:37,364
Gross.

382
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:57,885
Babe, I have
a question to ask you.

383
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,724
I've been thinking
a lot about us lately.

384
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:05,860
How time is fleeting...

385
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,530
and spending time
with the people you love

386
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:10,731
is what life is all about.

387
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,368
I know we've had
our shares of ups and downs.

388
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:19,006
But we've always managed to
continue to love each other...

389
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,474
be there for each other.

390
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:26,914
When I look into
those beautiful green eyes...

391
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:29,016
and that smile of yours...

392
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:31,886
I just think...

393
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:36,489
You're the most beautiful,
amazing woman I've ever seen.

394
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,426
And how I'm the luckiest man
in the world.

395
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,897
You're my best friend.
I love you.

396
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:45,498
You'll always be
my best friend.

397
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:54,642
Jennifer Anne Corolla.

398
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,477
Will you marry me?

399
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:05,720
Yes.
Oh, my God, Aaron, yes.

400
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:32,847
A deer and, like,
a rabbit once--

401
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,582
What are you talking about?

402
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:35,883
And even the math
teacher back in high school.

403
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:37,551
Rubbish! Rubbish!

404
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:39,720
Hey, hey, there she is!
It's Aaron Johnson.

405
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,488
-What's your name?
-Shut up.

406
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:43,557
My new sister-in-law!

407
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,927
- Show me the ring.
- Yeah.

408
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,730
-Look at that thing!
-That's beautiful.

409
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:51,498
Hey, I want a picture,
I want a picture.

410
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:52,800
-Picture.
-Oh, wait. Um...

411
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:53,968
I'm just gonna go
freshen up really quick.

412
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,603
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

413
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,705
-All right. Cheers.
-Why does she hate me?

414
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:33,207
Mrs. Jennifer Johnson.

415
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:37,678
Mrs. Jennifer Corolla-Johnson.

416
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:45,019
What the fuck?

417
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:49,623
Hey, babe, you okay in there?

418
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:51,726
Oh, yeah-- yeah, baby.

419
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,595
I, uh, knocked
a shampoo bottle off the shelf.

420
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,263
Okay.

421
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:59,633
Gotta make sure
my fiancée is okay.

422
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:01,869
I'm going back to the party.

423
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,671
I'll be right out, baby.

424
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:42,076
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

425
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:44,011
<i>You need a tan?</i>

426
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:46,680
<i>All right.</i>

427
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:48,983

429
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,219
Morning.

430
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:53,788
<i>Come on down to Dan the Tan,</i>

431
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:55,056

<i>the competition.</i>

432
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:58,726
<i>You peak in high school?</i>
<i>I sure didn't.</i>

433
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,127
<i>Come on down to Dan the Tan,</i>

434
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:01,929
<i>I'll give you</i>
<i>a little glow up.</i>

435
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,798

436

439
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:11,205
Bert, look out!

440
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:15,276
- Holy shit.
- What the hell?

441
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:16,877
-Fuck.
-Holy shit.

442
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:19,080
Thanks, Jen.

443
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:21,348
- Aw, bud, it missed you.
- Oh, stop it.

444
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:23,884
Too early for it, Cory.
Muzzle it.

445
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:25,953
Why do all these weird things
keep happening?

446
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:27,354
The cabin is out to get us.

447
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:29,723
I wouldn't
worry about it, babe.

448
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:31,125
Just have some
cold pizza with me.

449
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,327
We got a long day anyways.

450
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:36,030
Hey, so, ladies,
Aaron and I are going to go

451
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:37,932
on a hike up
to Mile's old house.

452
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:39,033
You want to join?

453
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,902
- Bert, you're welcome, too.
- Pass.

454
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:43,370
I'm meeting John
over at Isaac's

455
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:44,772
for lunch this afternoon.

456
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,007
We have a lot of
catching up to do.

457
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,409
Oh, that's good.

458
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,010
Is that tanning salon
we passed in town?

459
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:55,416
Will you come
with me later, Jennifer?

460
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,784
Please.

461
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,652
Of course, it'll be fun.

462
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,357
All right, so, it looks like
we meet back here at 5:00

463
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,359
and get ready for the reunion.

464
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:07,962
You know, I can't wait to see

465
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:10,397
the look on those
sad Junction girls faces

466
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:12,133
when we stroll into the party.

467
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,735
We will knock them dead.

468
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,871
This will be
a night to remember.

469
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:18,305
Oh, yes!

470
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:22,676
-For some of us.
-I need more pizza.

471
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:28,916
I don't know
why you won't let me

472
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:30,317
just go over there and knock
his fucking lights out.

473
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:32,953
Because A,
I can take care of myself.

474
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:35,122
B, I don't want you go to jail,

475
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:37,791
and C, you're not
my boyfriend anymore.

476
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:41,195
Fuck, why do you have to be
so fucking stubborn?

477
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:42,830
Get used to it!

478
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,932
Do you hear Cory
yelling at Leyla like that?

479
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,267
- Fuck!
- Damn.

480
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:49,370
Yeah. I think he's just
concerned, that's all.

481
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:52,273
He still cares about her.

482
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:53,774
Well, they'd still be together

483
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,309
if he wasn't
such a dick all the time.

484
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,178
He's getting better.

485
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,681
-What the hell?
-What the fuck?

486
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,955
Oh, God.

487
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:09,423
What a mess.

488
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:11,792
Look at all that broken glass.

489
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:12,927
Who broke that?

490
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:15,162
Wait, nobody was even in here.

491
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,997
Nobody but the...

492
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:19,800
Fucking A, Bert.

493
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,402
I swear to God, dude,

494
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:23,304
if this is another one
of your stupid pranks--

495
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:25,005
It wasn't me, all right?

496
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,440
It wasn't me
the last time either.

497
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,275
I was in the bathroom
getting ready.

498
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:30,344
Cory must have left the bottle
on the edge of the table.

499
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,146
-It just finally slipped.
-No, fuck you.

500
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:33,781
I put it in the center
of the table,

501
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:35,082
and the bear
wasn't fucking there.

502
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,451
Stop arguing about this.

503
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:39,486
It's just some freak accident.

504
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:42,323
Okay. No harm, no foul.

505
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:44,158
Whatever happened, happened.

506
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,961
Everybody just get back
to doing what you were doing.

507
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,999
Oh, yeah, just mosey on
back to your room.

508
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:53,535
Never mind
that my fucking expensive vodka

509
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:54,835
is all over the floor.

510
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,073
You clean it up, Cory.
You have time.

511
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,376
No matter how much time
you spend primping,

512
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,478
it doesn't change
this ugly face.

513
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:07,014
Oh, that's a good one.
That's a good one.

514
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:08,182
Just...

515
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,518
You fucking do it.

516
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,297
Yeah.

517
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:47,254
Hey, Annie.

518
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:49,156
Oh, God.
I can't get rid of you guys.

519
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:52,092
That's a nice sparkly dress
you're wearing.

520
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:53,193
Hey, girl.

521
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,095
I'm sorry, I mean, Annie.

522
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:56,864
Old habits.

523
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:58,299
Oh, I can see the douche canoe
has arrived as well.

524
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,568
What do you want?

525
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:02,236
Look, I don't want to keep you.

526
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:03,571
We're all going
to the same party in a few.

527
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:05,239
I just need
to ask you a question.

528
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,375
So ask.
I don't have all night.

529
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:10,377
I gotta go meet with my girls.

530
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:12,112
Is the cheerleading
squad still here?

531
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:15,182
Annie, that box
that you sold us?

532
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:17,151
There was-- there was
a teddy bear inside of it

533
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:19,420
and I was just wondering
if you knew where it came from.

534
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:21,488
Why? What does it matter?

535
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:23,324
Look, I don't give two shits
about the damn thing.

536
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:24,892
You guys own it.

537
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:26,460
Why are you asking
about the damn bear?

538
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,162
We've been having some
very strange things happen,

539
00:30:28,195 --> 00:30:30,331
and I think it's connected
to the box somehow.

540
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:33,601
Where did it come from?
Do you know where you got it?

541
00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:36,170
Fine, I'll tell you
who sold it to my granddad.

542
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:38,939
For a price.

543
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:40,974
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

544
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,443
Gosh, you're
a real piece of work.

545
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:44,211
You know, I'm so glad
we never stayed together.

546
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:46,146
Oh, God, that makes
two of us there, Gory Cory.

547
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,615
Matter of fact,
you and that bitch Leyla

548
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,283
deserve one another.

549
00:30:49,316 --> 00:30:51,151
- Or deserved one another.
- How much?

550
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:52,554
How much do you want?

551
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:55,022
Well, if it's
that important to you

552
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,624
and you're cutting
into the one night

553
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,425
that I actually have
a babysitter...

554
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,327
...it's 100 bucks.

555
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:02,963
What?
I don't have any cash on me.

556
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:04,566
-I can't help you.
-I can go ask Leyla--

557
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,301
No, don't do that. I got it.

558
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:08,503
Thank you.

559
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:10,904
You are most accommodating.

560
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:12,607
Here's your damn money.

561
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,274
Sweet.

562
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:20,280
Here, the guy's name
is Jim Ravenfeather.

563
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:22,216
He lives on
the other side of town.

564
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:23,685
He was the original owner.

565
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:25,219
You're welcome to go bug him
about the bear.

566
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:26,654
Doubt he'll be
much help, though.

567
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:28,623
-Thanks, Annie. Appreciate it.
-Of course.

568
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:30,023
See you at the reunion.

569
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:30,991
- Yeah.
- You know what?

570
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,228
Don't even bother
talking to me at the school.

571
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:35,963
Know what?
Get the fuck out of here.

572
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:37,464
And don't worry, I won't.

573
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:41,935
God damn it.

574
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:46,574
God damn door.

575
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:49,243
I can't believe those guys.

576
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:51,245
Fucking assholes just think

577
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:52,647
they're so much better
than everybody else

578
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,348
just because
they moved to the big city,

579
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:55,583
moved away from here.

580
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:58,218
What am I here for?

581
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,421
My phone. Yes.

582
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:05,693
Okay, it's all right.

583
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,595
It's all right.

584
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:09,664
It's okay. Just breathe.

585
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,468
We still got it, girl.

586
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:23,277
Hello?

587
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:27,247
Is someone there?

588
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:33,220
Hello?

589
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:35,989
Is there anybody there?

590
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:39,661
Dad?

591
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:45,299
Someone there?

592
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:51,739
Daddy?

593
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:54,642
Hello?

594
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,047
Who's there?

595
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:05,052
Hello?

596
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,196
About to go Jamie Lee Curtis
on this motherfucker.

597
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:18,165
Hello?

598
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:22,302
Is there anyone down here?

599
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,276
Hello?

600
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:37,017
Hello?

601
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:41,823
Who are you?

602
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:53,801
Oh, shit.

603
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:57,070
Oh, God.

604
00:33:57,104 --> 00:33:59,273
Oh. All right. We're good.

605
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:00,474
Get it together, Annie.

606
00:34:07,782 --> 00:34:10,384
Ah!

607
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:46,320
Damn it.
Fuck Jamie Lee Curtis.

608
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:56,731
Well, you bet.

609
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:58,800
Well, at least one of us
is having a good time.

610
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:02,670
Yeah, it does not surprise me

611
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:04,204
that the inbreed
and the toffee kid

612
00:35:04,237 --> 00:35:05,573
are the only ones
enjoying themselves.

613
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,207
-Oh, come on, Cory.
-Yeah.

614
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,475
Just be happy for 'em.

615
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:12,379
Hey, sourpusses.
Why the long faces?

616
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:13,815
It wasn't that bad,
right, John?

617
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:15,482
Speak for yourself, Bert.

618
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:17,384
God,
this town fucking sucks.

619
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:21,421
-I'm never coming back here.
-Oh, I remember you.

620
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,558
You were such a douche
in the school.

621
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,493
That's why no one ever
wanted to party with you.

622
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:29,329
Hey, John?
Fuck off, okay?

623
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,198
At least I made it out
of this shit hole town.

624
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:32,499
I made a name for myself

625
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,869
outside of Junction,
fuckin' Texas.

626
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:36,771
I'm in
a sports medicine company,

627
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:39,641
and I was on <i>Forbes'</i>
Top 100 startup companies.

628
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:41,375
Right, so that's
what's making you better

629
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:42,644
than all of us, right, Cory?

630
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,411
So why don't you tell us all

631
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:47,180
how much money this Top 100
startup company made?

632
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:49,584
Well, it's a startup company,
so the money comes--

633
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:51,919
Exactly. $0.

634
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:53,921
That's why Leyla
had to fund this whole trip.

635
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:58,392
Because you are
dead B-R-O-K-E, broke.

636
00:35:58,425 --> 00:35:59,594
Right, Gory Cory?

637
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:02,462
I told you not to fucking
call me that, okay?

638
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:04,331
- Hey, stop it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

639
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:05,700
Hey, hey, hey.

640
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,200
Bert, you okay?

641
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:08,670
What's your fucking
problem, Cory?

642
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:10,337
Motherfucker had
it coming, okay?

643
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,572
- Just go.
- Get in the car now!

644
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,876
-Let me see, let me see.
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

645
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,244
He packs a punch, though.
Ow...

646
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,212
Do you want to go
and see a doctor or something?

647
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:21,281
-It might be broken.
-No, no, it's fine, it's fine.

648
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:22,950
Nothing a nice,
cold beer couldn't fix.

649
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:25,385
Here comes
your shitty sense of humor.

650
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:26,788
Come on,
let me buy you some beer.

651
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:29,389
I told you not to come--

652
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:30,792
All right, you're right.

653
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:34,829
Fuck it.
Hey, wait. I'm coming, too.

654
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:38,298
I don't want to see that
sorry motherfucker right now.

655
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,234
All right,
everyone, show's over.

656
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,603
Go back to your lame ass party.

657
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:43,871
Oh, my God. We're leaving.

658
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,272
Fuck's going on, Aaron?

659
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:46,774
Causing problems again?

660
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:50,645
Oh, well,
late to the fun, Danny.

661
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:53,447
Oh, I'm sorry, Deputy Gibson.

662
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,482
Don't mind us.
We're leaving.

663
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:00,287
Bunch of losers.

664
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:05,392
Yes, ma'am.

665
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,967
Okay, I'm on my way.

666
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,636
Hey, look, sorry.
Hot night with the Gibster?

667
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,572
Gonna have to put that on hold.

668
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:19,507
Duty calls. Ciao.

669
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:22,442
You fucking prick.

670
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:26,279
Okay, guys, you go ahead.

671
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,548
See, I'm drunk.

672
00:37:27,582 --> 00:37:29,416
Go ahead
and park the car over there.

673
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:32,285
I'm gonna go inside and shower.

674
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,690
- That's my girl.
- Enjoy.

675
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:37,290
You want us to come or no?

676
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:39,560
No.

677
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:40,661
See you in a bit.

678
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:43,765
- She's a hoot.
- Yeah, she is.

679
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:45,499
So amazing.

680
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,835
Oh, man.

681
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,436
Just careful-- It's like--

682
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,038
I know,
this garage is like-

683
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:55,009
All right, a little more?

684
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:57,645
That's good enough.

685
00:37:57,678 --> 00:37:58,980
Man.

686
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:00,848
So that's what
these cars are like, huh?

687
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:02,550
I've always wanted
to drive one of these.

688
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,420
Well, I was buzzed, so.
Thank you so much.

689
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:08,556
No problem.

690
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,894
What the hell
she meant by that?

691
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:15,395
-What? Leyla?
-Mm-hmm.

692
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:17,765
Who knows.
That girl's as ditzy as a bat.

693
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,834
Well...

694
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:23,604
it was great
catching up with you.

695
00:38:23,638 --> 00:38:25,540
You too, John.

696
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:31,444
To be honest, I was surprised
to see you with...

697
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,016
Aaron and Cory earlier today.

698
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:38,085
I never figured
you'd be part of their posse.

699
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:39,887
I mean...

700
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,724
they used to bully you
back in the days.

701
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:46,594
And Cory still does.

702
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,630
Yeah. Look...

703
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:51,065
Cory's a big-time asshole.

704
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,101
But Aaron and Jennifer
are my real friends.

705
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,436
Even Leyla, in a weird way.

706
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,806
And yeah,
the boys used to bully me

707
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,708
a bit back in high school,

708
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:03,443
but college really gave us
a chance to bond and reconnect.

709
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:05,880
And some of us
outgrew the pettiness.

710
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:09,050
Notice I said some of us.

711
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:12,720
Well, you know
how to make people laugh.

712
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:15,857
I always liked that
about you, Bert.

713
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:34,508
We had so much fun together.
I mean, you and me.

714
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:37,078
I really missed you.

715
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:39,647
And I haven't seen you
in a long, long time.

716
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,016
I know, John. It sucks, man.

717
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:44,752
I'm busy on the road
so much with my comedy act.

718
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,688
And you, Mr. Big Shot
real estate agent

719
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:50,858
- in all of Kimble County.
- Thank you.

720
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:52,660
Look, I promise, you know,

721
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:54,595
I'm gonna do my best
to make it back here more

722
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:55,963
now that you and I
have connected again.

723
00:39:56,664 --> 00:39:57,732
Hey, Bert.

724
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,167
I want to tell you something.

725
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,738
I think
you already know, but...

726
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:07,742
I just want to tell you,
otherwise...

727
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:09,610
I'm going to regret
for the rest of my life.

728
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:10,978
John, it's okay,
you don't have to--

729
00:40:11,012 --> 00:40:12,780
Just let me say it, okay?

730
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:17,184
I just-- Otherwise
I'm gonna lose my nerve.

731
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:18,519
Okay.

732
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,121
Here goes nothing.

733
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:23,456
Bert Galindo...

734
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,128
I think--

735
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,133
John!

736
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:37,939
No, John!

737
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,077
What the fuck is going on?

738
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:23,551
Bloody hell.

739
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,086
They're taking their time.

740
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:37,131
Long day, long shower.

741
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,066
Lovely.

742
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,868
Let's see what's going on.

743
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:46,107
There is...

744
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:48,943
They will like it.

745
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,149
Hey, guys,
I don't mean to interrupt

746
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,184
whatever you are doing,

747
00:41:57,218 --> 00:42:00,221
but I've got two cold ones.

748
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:02,556
Can you hear me?

749
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:05,559
Hello?

750
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:08,929
Hello?

751
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:55,209
All right.

752
00:42:56,944 --> 00:42:58,012
Okay.

753
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:11,959
Damn.

754
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:15,629
Oh, that's a damn shame.
God damn it!

755
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:18,299
Oh, God.

756
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:21,202
Hey, Sheriff-- Holy shit.

757
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:23,204
Is that Annie Eastman?

758
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:27,007
Yeah, it is, Gibson.

759
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:29,343
That's a shitty-ass way to go.

760
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,148
Yeah, that's too bad.

761
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,218
She was very nice to me
and my girls.

762
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,786
All the time.

763
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,287
What the hell happened?
Was she murdered?

764
00:43:40,321 --> 00:43:43,824
Yeah. Stabbed, pretty certain.
Look at that.

765
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,061
Yep.

766
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:49,864
What do you think you make
something like that with?

767
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:54,135
Well, something precise,
something long.

768
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:58,072
You know, it almost seems like
a-- like a-- like a glove

769
00:43:58,105 --> 00:44:01,375
with little knives at the end,
you know, like Freddy Krueger.

770
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:05,079
Just a joke.

771
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:06,680
Yeah, I know.

772
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:13,087
But, honestly, what do you
think could do that?

773
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:17,691
-It looks like a pitchfork.
-Yeah.

774
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:21,962
You guys can go.

775
00:44:23,164 --> 00:44:25,132
Yeah, yeah, a pitchfork, yeah.

776
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,068
That might be it,
Gibson, that's pretty smart.

777
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:30,371
Listen, why don't you go...

778
00:44:31,506 --> 00:44:33,174
check the perimeter,

779
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,909
make sure there's nothing
we missed or something?

780
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:36,110
Yeah.

781
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:38,112
I got to go check
on Dan the Tan

782
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:41,448
'cause I guess he won't be open
for business tomorrow, will he?

783
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:43,317
- Dan, too?
- Yeah.

784
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,451
Shit.

785
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:47,755
You know, he and I used
to go fishing all the time.

786
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:49,123
-Did you really?
-Yeah.

787
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:52,693
What'd you guys catch?

788
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:56,096
You know, the usual.
Trout. Whatever's in the river.

789
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,299
-Bluegill?
-One or two, maybe.

790
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:00,067
- Perch?
- Yeah.

791
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,036
You know something?
I don't give a shit.

792
00:45:03,003 --> 00:45:04,772
Right.

793
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:06,440
Why don't you just go
take a look like I told you to

794
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:07,741
and just follow an order?

795
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:08,842
Yes, sir.

796
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:18,786
Holy fuck.

797
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:20,054
Damn, how did this happen?

798
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:21,722
Okay, guys.

799
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:23,991
Time to go now.

800
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:26,427
Get out of here.
It's a crime scene

801
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,762
and you both shouldn't be here,
and you know that, so get out.

802
00:45:28,796 --> 00:45:30,864
Look, we know that's Annie.
We went to school with her.

803
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:32,800
-What the fuck happened?
-Yeah.

804
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,201
Okay.

805
00:45:34,235 --> 00:45:37,438
It's a homicide investigation,
all right?

806
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:39,073
That's all I'm gonna say.

807
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:40,474
The both of you,
get out of here.

808
00:45:40,508 --> 00:45:42,309
You don't,
I'll get Deputy Gibson

809
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:44,278
to come over
and escort you out.

810
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:46,247
Maybe I'll just arrest
the both of yous.

811
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,215
Okay? It's up to you.

812
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,317
Let's go, bro.

813
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:52,419
Sheriff's being a fucking dick.

814
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:55,256
And Jennifer's
in the car waiting.

815
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:56,924
It's time to get going.

816
00:45:58,158 --> 00:45:59,460
Let's get the hell out of here.

817
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:00,794
There's nothing
we could do anyway.

818
00:46:00,828 --> 00:46:02,463
No, you're right
about that, son.

819
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,570
- Danny.
- Shit!

820
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:10,104
Jesus Christ.

821
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:13,508
By the way, it's Deputy,
remember? Lawman.

822
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:16,110
Yeah, well, I kicked your ass
plenty of times in high school.

823
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:17,811
- We got a question.
- What?

824
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,147
Do y'all know who killed Annie?

825
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:23,317
No. I do not know
who killed Annie.

826
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,452
The only thing I know
is whoever's doing it

827
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:27,921
is very creative
and a sick motherfucker.

828
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:30,525
We just saw her
before the reunion.

829
00:46:30,558 --> 00:46:32,293
-Yeah, yeah.
-Wait.

830
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:35,396
You saw her earlier?

831
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,298
Like, you were
the last ones to see her alive?

832
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,467
I don't know.

833
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:42,136
What were y'all doing?

834
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,339
She was closing up shop,
and Jen wanted to talk about...

835
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:47,841
a teddy bear.

836
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,410
Okay, look,
I don't have time for this.

837
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:51,312
I gotta get back to my boss.

838
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:53,380
Y'all just be careful and get
the hell out of here, okay?

839
00:46:53,414 --> 00:46:55,517
All right. Thanks, Danny.

840
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,520
It's Deputy.

841
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:04,858
Robert, you need
to clean this shit up pronto.

842
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:07,361
Listen, Mayor,
how was I supposed to know

843
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:10,164
there was gonna be
two homicides in this town?

844
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:12,099
The worst thing
that ever happened around here

845
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:14,501
was kids popping wheelies
up at the dunes

846
00:47:14,536 --> 00:47:16,437
or shooting drugs somewhere.

847
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,105
What the hell
was I supposed to know

848
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:19,574
this kind of thing
would happen around here?

849
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:21,576
Honestly?

850
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:24,211
Listen, this town
is on its last leg

851
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:26,146
thanks to the development
of Kerrville.

852
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,083
We need
all the tourism we can get.

853
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:31,218
People need to spend
money in Junction.

854
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:34,388
If they don't spend money,
we don't get funds.

855
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:35,657
You don't get funds!

856
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,926
And I can't keep tapping
the city coffer.

857
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:42,429
<i>-Comprende?</i>
-Oh, I <i>comprende.</i>

858
00:47:42,463 --> 00:47:45,032
Little bit more than you might
remember, I <i>comprende.</i>

859
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,102
I know all about
your embezzling

860
00:47:48,135 --> 00:47:51,205
and so do you, by the way,
before you jump ship on me.

861
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:52,507
Best jump of my life.

862
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,976
Apparently. Good for you.

863
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:58,011
Listen, how would you like it

864
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:59,980
if I let that
white trash reporter

865
00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:02,015
know all about your little late
night gambling problems, huh?

866
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,884
-You wouldn't dare.
-Wanna bet?

867
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,653
You try me, bub.

868
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:07,454
You fucking prick.

869
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:10,090
You keep putting
that goddamn thing in my face

870
00:48:10,124 --> 00:48:11,225
and we'll see who crosses who.

871
00:48:11,693 --> 00:48:13,494
- Listen, Robert.
- Yeah?

872
00:48:13,528 --> 00:48:16,531
You need to do your job
or I'm going to fire your ass.

873
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:18,165
Go ahead and do that,
you bald-headed prick.

874
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,435
Let's go, Julie.

875
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:23,937
Yeah.

876
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,312
What the hell do you want?

877
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:34,181
What the hell was that about?

878
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:38,485
It's about the mayor
being a bald-headed prick.

879
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,287
Same goddamn thing.

880
00:48:40,988 --> 00:48:42,289
Did you find out anything else?

881
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:44,057
Actually, yeah.

882
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,493
Remember that group
that we pulled over yesterday?

883
00:48:46,528 --> 00:48:47,695
Yeah.

884
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:49,163
Well, Aaron Johnson
and his friends...

885
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:50,665
Yeah.

886
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:53,167
...saw both victims
before they were murdered.

887
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:54,935
No kidding?

888
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,505
Wow. Well, that's interesting.

889
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:22,262
Leyley?

890
00:49:22,797 --> 00:49:24,566
-Bert?
-Bert?

891
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,133
Where are they?

892
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:27,635
There's no car outside.

893
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:29,203
That's-- that's weird.

894
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:30,337
Leyla?

895
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:35,309
Hey Ley, you here?

896
00:49:39,747 --> 00:49:41,081
Maybe they're out
in the garage.

897
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:43,083
- I should go check.
- No, I'll-- I'll go.

898
00:49:43,116 --> 00:49:45,753
I should probably
patch things up with Bert.

899
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:48,155
Oh, that's real mature of you.

900
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:12,547
Uh...

901
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:15,717
Hey, guys, uh,

902
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,619
I don't mean to interrupt
or anything, but...

903
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:20,622
I know you're probably
still pissed at me,

904
00:50:20,655 --> 00:50:23,490
but I was thinking,
what if you, uh...

905
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,360
What if I let you hit me
as hard as you can?

906
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,362
Just to even things out?

907
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:31,733
What do you say?

908
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:36,604
Hey.

909
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:39,206
I'm-- I'm trying
to apologize here.

910
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:44,546
Hey, guys, what the--

911
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:51,451
What the fuck?

912
00:50:54,187 --> 00:50:55,289
What the--

913
00:50:57,725 --> 00:50:59,359
Who the fuck are you?

914
00:51:06,634 --> 00:51:08,335
Hey!

915
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,546
We need to get out of here now.
Like, right fucking now, okay?

916
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,847
What the fuck's
gotten into you?

917
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:21,348
Bert and John
are dead in the car.

918
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:23,183
What?
Is this a sick fucking joke?

919
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:24,586
I'm not fucking joking, okay?

920
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:26,186
They're in the fucking car,
dead.

921
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:27,755
And we need to get
out of here right now.

922
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:29,557
- What is going on? Cory!
- There was this

923
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:31,358
this little girl or something.

924
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:33,293
She was, like,
sick or rabid, and she threw--

925
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:34,862
she tried to kill me
with a pitchfork,

926
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:36,531
and I think
she killed Bert and John.

927
00:51:36,564 --> 00:51:38,298
What? Hold on.
You saw someone out there?

928
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:40,702
What?

929
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:45,607
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

930
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,710
Who the fuck--
who the fuck was that?

931
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:50,511
We need to leave.

932
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:51,813
Call the police.
We gotta get out of here.

933
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:52,880
Wait, wait, wait.
Where's Leyla?

934
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:54,181
Shit, Leyla.

935
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:55,650
Leyla!

936
00:51:57,819 --> 00:51:58,886
Leyla?

937
00:52:03,558 --> 00:52:05,258
-What?
-What the fuck, man?

938
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:08,563
Oh, my God. Okay.
Cory, come on. Come on, bro.

939
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:10,765
She's-- she's gone, man.
She's gone, Cory.

940
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:12,299
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

941
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:14,167
-Cory, she's gone, dude!
-Show yourself!

942
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:15,703
-Cory, get in the car.
-I'll fucking kill you!

943
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:17,672
She's-- she's gone,
man, she's gone.

944
00:52:17,705 --> 00:52:19,641
Get in the car.
Get in the car, Cory.

945
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:22,209
Okay, I'll call the police.
Shit. No signal, fuck!

946
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:24,512
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Fuck.

947
00:52:48,268 --> 00:52:50,470
Hey, buddy. Hey, hey, hey.

948
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:00,748
Oh, shit.

949
00:53:00,782 --> 00:53:02,684
Guys, we gotta get
the fuck out of here.

950
00:53:02,717 --> 00:53:03,885
- What's going on?
- She killed the deputy.

951
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:05,620
-So what do we do?
-Please, please...

952
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:07,287
Fuck.

953
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:09,590
Fuck. Shit.

954
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:11,324
We got-- we gotta
make a run for it.

955
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,994
- Fuck.
- Yeah, we gotta.

956
00:53:13,027 --> 00:53:14,294
We gotta go.

957
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:16,396
Fucking bear.

958
00:53:21,936 --> 00:53:23,538
Yeah. Who is it?

959
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,540
Sorry.

960
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:26,641
My friends and I,

961
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:29,577
we're looking
for a Jim Ravenfeather.

962
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:31,879
We were told
this is the right address.

963
00:53:33,014 --> 00:53:35,348
Maybe it is. What's it to you?

964
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,285
We voted for that other guy,
if that's why you're here.

965
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:41,789
No, no, um, we were told
Mr. Ravenfeather could help us.

966
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:44,357
-Does he live here?
-Sure he lives here, gorgeous.

967
00:53:44,726 --> 00:53:46,226
Jim Ravenfeather's
my grandfather.

968
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:47,895
Why do you need to see him?

969
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,832
And exactly
who are you, gorgeous?

970
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:52,967
-Leave her alone.
-Whoa, chill.

971
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,334
I meant nothing by it.

972
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,236
But like I said...

973
00:53:57,638 --> 00:53:59,040
Who are you?

974
00:53:59,073 --> 00:54:01,609
I'm Jennifer.
This is Aaron. That's Cory.

975
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:05,646
We were told
Mr. Ravenfeather could help us.

976
00:54:06,013 --> 00:54:07,481
Can we see him?

977
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:08,649
He never leaves
the house anymore.

978
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,317
Not since...

979
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:13,286
For a while.

980
00:54:14,722 --> 00:54:15,790
You can come in, I guess.

981
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:17,792
But he may not be up
for visitors.

982
00:54:17,825 --> 00:54:19,392
And if he isn't,

983
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:20,728
then you got
to get the fuck out of here.

984
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:21,829
Understand?

985
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,565
Ye-- yes.

986
00:54:26,768 --> 00:54:27,869
Thank you.

987
00:54:51,092 --> 00:54:51,959
Who are these people?

988
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,929
Grandfather,
I let these white folks in.

989
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:56,664
They need your help, they said.

990
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:58,733
This here's Jennifer and, uh,

991
00:54:58,766 --> 00:55:00,568
I forgot
your other two's names.

992
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:02,670
Sir, my name's Aaron Johnson.

993
00:55:02,703 --> 00:55:05,506
This is my fiancée,
Jennifer Corolla,

994
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,008
and that's my brother, Cory.

995
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:09,342
Corolla?

996
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:12,547
As in Franky Corolla?

997
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,382
That old son of a bitch
that used to own

998
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:16,617
the pizza parlor in town?

999
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:18,653
Yeah, that's my dad.

1000
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:20,487
Did you know him?

1001
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:22,657
It's a little town,
little lady.

1002
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,358
I know a lot about this town.

1003
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:28,629
I know a lot about your family.

1004
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:31,999
Guys, we don't
have time for this,

1005
00:55:32,033 --> 00:55:33,634
that pitchfork girl
killed our friends,

1006
00:55:33,668 --> 00:55:35,402
and she's still
fucking looking for us.

1007
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:36,971
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1008
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,775
Man, I knew you white people
were fucking crazy.

1009
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:42,076
What'd you call me?

1010
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:43,578
Get the fuck
out of our goddamn house.

1011
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:45,345
Benji.

1012
00:55:47,548 --> 00:55:48,616
Please continue.

1013
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:51,484
Several people
have been murdered.

1014
00:55:52,753 --> 00:55:55,056
It all started when we got this
old box from Annie Eastman.

1015
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:57,024
She said you sold it to her?

1016
00:55:57,058 --> 00:55:58,926
Is the box still sealed?

1017
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:02,462
Tell me
you did not open the box.

1018
00:56:02,495 --> 00:56:03,965
Yes, we opened the fucking box,

1019
00:56:03,998 --> 00:56:05,633
there was a fucking teddy bear.

1020
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:08,536
What the fuck, Grandpa?

1021
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:10,738
Is that what we felt
the other night?

1022
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:13,040
Son of a bitch.

1023
00:56:14,175 --> 00:56:17,645
After all these decades,
she's come back.

1024
00:56:18,746 --> 00:56:19,981
You said she...

1025
00:56:20,781 --> 00:56:22,449
she was killing townspeople?

1026
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:23,818
She slaughtered our friends.

1027
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:25,686
She's still looking for us.

1028
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,787
Please.

1029
00:56:26,821 --> 00:56:27,955
Do you know how to stop her?

1030
00:56:31,893 --> 00:56:33,094
There's nothing I can do.

1031
00:56:33,794 --> 00:56:34,929
I'm sorry.

1032
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:37,198
You came
all this way for nothing.

1033
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:39,767
Please, Mr. Ravenfeather,
I'm begging you.

1034
00:56:40,868 --> 00:56:42,469
We don't know how to stop her.

1035
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:46,140
She killed our friends,
people in the town,

1036
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:47,675
she's gonna kill us, too.

1037
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,044
Do you want that
on your conscience?

1038
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:52,046
There's nothing I can do.

1039
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:55,683
Fuck, we're wasting our time
with this dumbass Indian.

1040
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:57,417
- Hey, watch it, motherfucker.
- Please.

1041
00:56:57,952 --> 00:57:00,888
Excuse my brother.
He's an idiot.

1042
00:57:01,689 --> 00:57:04,825
But, sir, our friends are dead.

1043
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:06,861
Please, help us.

1044
00:57:07,762 --> 00:57:09,630
We have no other options.

1045
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:11,699
You're our last hope.

1046
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:14,869
You have to know something.

1047
00:57:16,137 --> 00:57:18,606
For the love of God, for your
town, for the people in it...

1048
00:57:19,507 --> 00:57:20,574
tell us what you know.

1049
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:22,109
Please.

1050
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:28,582
I was the witness...

1051
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:31,152
the only witness...

1052
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:34,121
of the birth of pure evil.

1053
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:37,425
Of a powerful vengeance.

1054
00:57:38,859 --> 00:57:39,927
Of a wraith...

1055
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:44,832
named Ami Cutter.

1056
00:57:46,634 --> 00:57:47,969
Ami and I were friends.

1057
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:50,638
I first met Ami...

1058
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:55,710
after my father
lost our family home.

1059
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:58,713
And her father, her...

1060
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:01,515
stepfather...

1061
00:58:04,018 --> 00:58:06,020
purchased it at auction.

1062
00:58:07,188 --> 00:58:10,191
I used to go every Sunday
down to their farm...

1063
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,728
for high tea...

1064
00:58:14,895 --> 00:58:15,963
with her...

1065
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:18,498
and her stuffed bear.

1066
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:21,669
It was one of those Sundays...

1067
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:24,672
that's when I...

1068
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:29,076
I saw her murdered...

1069
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:32,279
at the hands...

1070
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:35,016
of her stepfather.

1071
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:40,054
He picked up a pitchfork...

1072
00:58:42,757 --> 00:58:44,025
and ran her through.

1073
00:58:45,226 --> 00:58:47,928
It wasn't until the next night

1074
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:50,998
that I summoned up
the courage...

1075
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:55,970
to go back to the farm to see

1076
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:57,838
what had happened
to her father.

1077
00:58:58,372 --> 00:59:00,341
You know what?

1078
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:03,811
<i>After seeing him</i>
<i>talking to himself,</i>

1079
00:59:03,844 --> 00:59:07,114
<i>drinking,</i>
<i>laughing, and crying...</i>

1080
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:11,652
I swore I could hear a voice.

1081
00:59:12,953 --> 00:59:14,755
It caught the attention
of her father.

1082
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:20,094
He started
to yell out her name.

1083
00:59:24,899 --> 00:59:26,634
And that's when
I heard her laughter.

1084
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:30,704
Then she appeared...

1085
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:33,841
like a mist.

1086
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,843
She took the pitchfork...

1087
00:59:40,181 --> 00:59:42,183
and ran her father through.

1088
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:45,286
Then the strangest
thing happened.

1089
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:49,190
She reached down...

1090
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:54,261
and picked up the teddy bear.

1091
00:59:57,131 --> 00:59:58,365
She hugged it...

1092
01:00:03,404 --> 01:00:04,939
and she looked up at me...

1093
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,377
but she was looking
right through me.

1094
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,785
And then she disappeared.

1095
01:00:22,323 --> 01:00:23,390
I ran over.

1096
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:29,964
I picked up the bear.

1097
01:00:33,901 --> 01:00:35,870
The only thing
I had left of my friend.

1098
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,011
I ran home
with the bear and I put it...

1099
01:00:45,713 --> 01:00:46,780
in a suitcase.

1100
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:49,917
I kept it safe for 30 years.

1101
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:55,723
Until I...

1102
01:00:58,025 --> 01:00:59,393
sold it to the Eastmans.

1103
01:01:04,231 --> 01:01:05,933
I think they knew
what was in it.

1104
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:08,235
Wait, who was Ami's
real father?

1105
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:09,937
Ami's real father...

1106
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:14,341
was a man that Ami's mother
was having an affair with.

1107
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:17,878
He was sheriff at the time.

1108
01:01:17,912 --> 01:01:19,346
Well, why is she killing us?

1109
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,881
Why is she chasing us?

1110
01:01:20,915 --> 01:01:22,316
We didn't do anything wrong.

1111
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:23,884
You haven't done
anything wrong.

1112
01:01:26,187 --> 01:01:29,957
I should have gotten rid
of the bear properly.

1113
01:01:32,493 --> 01:01:33,861
It's the bear.

1114
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:41,235
It's the connection between her
and the world of the living.

1115
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:43,137
She must have a human host.

1116
01:01:46,173 --> 01:01:48,742
She must have her blood...

1117
01:01:49,544 --> 01:01:51,779
the blood of her relations.

1118
01:01:51,812 --> 01:01:53,314
She'll eventually fade away,

1119
01:01:53,347 --> 01:01:56,016
unless she possesses
a relative of hers?

1120
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:00,888
Yes, she must have
that human host

1121
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:02,323
and she's growing weak.

1122
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:06,760
The more she kills,
the stronger she gets.

1123
01:02:06,794 --> 01:02:08,028
Mr. Ravenfeather...

1124
01:02:09,797 --> 01:02:11,165
who is Ami's blood?

1125
01:02:12,366 --> 01:02:13,934
Don't ask questions...

1126
01:02:15,302 --> 01:02:16,770
that you know the answer to.

1127
01:02:18,305 --> 01:02:21,809
Wait, so are you saying
Jennifer is Ami's blood?

1128
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:24,211
Ami's real father
was Sheriff Corolla.

1129
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:28,249
Jennifer's grandfather.

1130
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:29,917
Well, how do we kill
this bitch?

1131
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:32,419
You cannot kill it.
It is energy.

1132
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,525
And energy, you can only hope
to transform it or contain it.

1133
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:40,494
Well, can we just put
the bear back in the box?

1134
01:02:40,528 --> 01:02:42,096
Can we do the box thing again?

1135
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:43,831
We cannot.

1136
01:02:43,864 --> 01:02:45,132
The seal has been broken,

1137
01:02:45,165 --> 01:02:46,834
and it would take
too long to recreate it.

1138
01:02:47,468 --> 01:02:49,169
The only hope is to bury it...

1139
01:02:50,337 --> 01:02:51,438
in consecrated ground.

1140
01:02:52,072 --> 01:02:54,074
Unless anyone
who looks at it...

1141
01:02:55,209 --> 01:02:56,310
or touches it...

1142
01:02:57,177 --> 01:02:59,213
will feel the wraith within.

1143
01:02:59,581 --> 01:03:00,848
Like a cemetery?

1144
01:03:01,148 --> 01:03:02,816
Is there one close by?

1145
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:05,352
Yes, if you cut through
the old rodeo ground,

1146
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:08,055
you'll end up
at Red Rock Cemetery.

1147
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:09,490
We just have
to fucking bury this?

1148
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:18,999
Peckerwood, I know
you're not that stupid.

1149
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:21,536
Do you realize
what you've just done?

1150
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,172
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

1151
01:03:25,205 --> 01:03:26,307
I'm sorry.

1152
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,942
Exit our home.

1153
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:33,314
Damn you all.

1154
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:35,517
Get them the fuck out.

1155
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:38,952
So over this
<i>Evil Dead</i> shit...

1156
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:56,036
Grandad?

1157
01:04:21,962 --> 01:04:26,033
So, Bert and Leyla,
whoever else the fuck is dead

1158
01:04:26,066 --> 01:04:27,602
because it's Jennifer's fault.

1159
01:04:27,635 --> 01:04:29,203
-Cory, back off, it's not--
-Don't fucking hit me!

1160
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:30,437
- Cory, back off.
- I'll kick your ass.

1161
01:04:32,373 --> 01:04:33,474
I don't want to fight you.

1162
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:36,043
I just want to get rid
of this damn curse

1163
01:04:36,076 --> 01:04:37,344
and make it out of here alive.

1164
01:04:37,378 --> 01:04:38,946
I'm sure Bert would like
to get out alive.

1165
01:04:38,979 --> 01:04:40,414
-Or John, or Leyla.
-Cory--

1166
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,049
I'm sure she'd like
to not be fucking dead.

1167
01:04:42,082 --> 01:04:43,150
Okay, enough.

1168
01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:44,918
Stop it.

1169
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:47,121
This isn't helping.

1170
01:04:48,122 --> 01:04:50,090
Okay, we have to figure out
how to end this

1171
01:04:50,124 --> 01:04:51,959
so that nobody else dies.

1172
01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:54,061
I don't fucking care
who else dies, she's dead.

1173
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:56,598
Leyla?

1174
01:04:58,332 --> 01:05:00,167
You never knew how much
she meant to me, did you?

1175
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:04,071
-Cory, I'm--
-Forget it.

1176
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:10,612
I gotta fucking finish this
for Bert and Leyla.

1177
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:14,348
Come on, let's go.

1178
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:54,988
Babe. Babe.

1179
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,957
Oh, my God, are you okay?

1180
01:05:58,325 --> 01:05:59,393
What happened to your arm?

1181
01:06:00,528 --> 01:06:01,663
How long has it been like that?

1182
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:02,730
What the fuck?

1183
01:06:02,764 --> 01:06:04,298
Oh, my God. Cory!

1184
01:06:04,331 --> 01:06:05,700
- Cory.
- Cory!

1185
01:06:05,733 --> 01:06:07,434
What y'all doing here?

1186
01:06:07,468 --> 01:06:09,203
This is private property,
you can't be here.

1187
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:10,672
He scared
the shit out of me, okay?

1188
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:12,339
Put the pitchfork away.

1189
01:06:12,372 --> 01:06:15,677
Please, sir, we just need
to find the main road.

1190
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,211
We got lost.

1191
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:18,546
Just lead us
in the right direction.

1192
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:22,517
Um, okay.

1193
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,185
It's over this way.

1194
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:26,721
Follow me.

1195
01:06:27,822 --> 01:06:29,691
I don't know how you got here
this time of night.

1196
01:06:34,394 --> 01:06:38,031
Oh, shit. Shit.

1197
01:06:41,736 --> 01:06:44,338
-Aaron, run!
-Cory, no!

1198
01:06:47,709 --> 01:06:49,109
Hey!

1199
01:06:49,677 --> 01:06:51,478
Not so tough
without your toy, huh?

1200
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,587
Cory!

1201
01:07:22,744 --> 01:07:24,478
This way.

1202
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,321
Trust me.

1203
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:45,065
Jen. Jen.

1204
01:08:18,498 --> 01:08:22,670
Oh, shit. Cutter.
Jen!

1205
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:37,819
Jennifer?

1206
01:08:39,252 --> 01:08:40,320
Babe!

1207
01:08:41,355 --> 01:08:42,557
Where are you?

1208
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,592
Trust me.

1209
01:08:47,695 --> 01:08:49,664
Jen! Get away from her!

1210
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,733
Jennifer.

1211
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:00,207
Jen.

1212
01:09:09,483 --> 01:09:12,386
Jen. Jen.
You gotta fight her, Jen.

1213
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:14,922
Please. Fight her.
This isn't you.

1214
01:09:15,523 --> 01:09:16,624
This is not you.

1215
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,596
J-- Jen,
you don't have to do this.

1216
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:25,298
Jen. Please.

1217
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:27,902
Please.
Please, Jen, fight her.

1218
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,202
Please.

1219
01:09:30,571 --> 01:09:33,206
Please, Jen,
I love you, please.

1220
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:45,586
Are you okay?

1221
01:09:50,323 --> 01:09:52,727
Aaron. I can't.

1222
01:09:55,328 --> 01:09:56,396
Jen.

1223
01:09:56,898 --> 01:09:59,266
Aaron, I can't,
I can't hold on.

1224
01:10:00,635 --> 01:10:03,538
Jen, you have to fight her.

1225
01:10:03,971 --> 01:10:06,306
Please, she's too strong.

1226
01:10:07,575 --> 01:10:08,810
It's too late for me.

1227
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:11,679
There's only one way
to end this.

1228
01:10:12,613 --> 01:10:15,482
-I'm not doing it, Jen.
-If you don't, she'll kill you.

1229
01:10:16,684 --> 01:10:18,553
I couldn't live
without you, either.

1230
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:20,454
Please.

1231
01:10:21,055 --> 01:10:22,322
Jen.

1232
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:25,760
- I can't.
- Aaron.

1233
01:10:25,793 --> 01:10:26,861
Shh.

1234
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:28,930
I love you.

1235
01:10:30,497 --> 01:10:31,833
We have to keep going.

1236
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:42,844
I'm sorry, baby.

1237
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,555
I'm sorry, baby.

1238
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:20,648
He's not having a great day.

1239
01:11:24,752 --> 01:11:26,521
Oh, look who's here.

1240
01:11:26,554 --> 01:11:27,789
What's the story, Sheriff?

1241
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:30,558
I don't know. You tell me.

1242
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:33,027
I-- I don't understand
any of this shit.

1243
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,831
This is all I know
is he come in here,

1244
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:40,935
talking about ghosts
and, uh, voodoo magic

1245
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:44,005
and, uh, the whole town
is cursed and, uh...

1246
01:11:45,405 --> 01:11:47,008
everyone's getting
stabbed and...

1247
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:52,079
...his fiancée's
dead, and no motive.

1248
01:11:52,113 --> 01:11:53,815
And it all ends up
in the Cutter Farm

1249
01:11:53,848 --> 01:11:55,382
or Cutter Ranch and...

1250
01:11:56,651 --> 01:11:58,820
everybody stabbed to death,
all his friends.

1251
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:02,590
It's all from, uh, Ami Cutter.

1252
01:12:02,623 --> 01:12:03,691
All right?

1253
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:07,394
And, uh, wha--
what'd you say she was?

1254
01:12:07,427 --> 01:12:08,629
Some kind of wraith.

1255
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,430
A wraith.

1256
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,734
Whatever that is.

1257
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:15,703
Christ. Curse?

1258
01:12:15,736 --> 01:12:17,972
We don't need the town
talking about curses.

1259
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:21,876
We need a concrete explanation,
for the good of this town,

1260
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:24,477
and my tourist money.

1261
01:12:24,512 --> 01:12:26,346
I think we need
the truth, mayor.

1262
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:29,416
Truth? We can make the truth
anything we want.

1263
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:32,419
This is the age
of misinformation.

1264
01:12:32,452 --> 01:12:34,454
Let's use it to our advantage.

1265
01:12:34,487 --> 01:12:36,456
Whatever you say.
I'm on your payroll.

1266
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:37,625
And here's the story.

1267
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:40,161
Aaron Johnson came back to town

1268
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:43,798
enacting his sick,
violent fantasies.

1269
01:12:43,831 --> 01:12:45,099
But our beloved sheriff...

1270
01:12:47,467 --> 01:12:49,670
saved the day
by getting a confession

1271
01:12:49,704 --> 01:12:50,972
and can put him away for good.

1272
01:12:53,107 --> 01:12:54,575
End of story.

1273
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:57,511
We cleansed the town
of any curse.

1274
01:12:58,679 --> 01:12:59,780
Use that.

1275
01:13:07,755 --> 01:13:09,090
Love to watch her leave.

1276
01:13:13,561 --> 01:13:14,695
So, what do we do now,
sheriff?

1277
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:30,044
I'm gonna tell the truth...
just like the mayor asked.

1278
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,788
Whatever in the hell
that's gonna be.

1279
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,159
Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor.

1280
01:13:45,793 --> 01:13:47,128
Marlene Rogers, KFOT.

1281
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:48,829
We know who the fuck you are.

1282
01:13:48,863 --> 01:13:50,231
You do this all the time.

1283
01:13:50,264 --> 01:13:52,066
Was the killer caught tonight?

1284
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:54,467
The mayor's not making any
comments right now, Marlene.

1285
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:55,670
-So back off.
-Whoa, whoa, Josie.

1286
01:13:55,703 --> 01:13:56,804
-I do have a comment.
-Come on!

1287
01:13:56,837 --> 01:13:58,072
I do have a comment.

1288
01:13:58,105 --> 01:14:00,241
Tonight,
our local law enforcement

1289
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:04,045
apprehended native
Aaron Johnson for murder.

1290
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:08,015
He's been accused of murdering
the local town folk, friends,

1291
01:14:08,049 --> 01:14:10,952
and suspected of murdering
his fiancée, Jennifer Corolla.

1292
01:14:10,985 --> 01:14:12,586
- Does this have anything to--
- No more comments.

1293
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,955
No more comments, Marlene.

1294
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:15,122
The ghost girl
that's been roaming this area--

1295
01:14:15,156 --> 01:14:16,624
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor,

1296
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:18,092
eyewitnesses
have been seeing this.

1297
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,827
Mr. Mayor!

1298
01:14:54,628 --> 01:14:58,799
