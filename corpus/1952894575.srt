1
00:00:02,434 --> 00:00:04,231
Man: Scotland
didn't invent football,

2
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:06,065
but we'll take
a back seat to no one

3
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:07,729
in our passion
for the game.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,207
With 40 professional teams
in a country of five million,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,642
football is as much a part
of the national fabric

6
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:15,907
as single malt
and bad weather.

7
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:17,504
Some say it's a religion.

8
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:20,744
If so, there are two denominations
in this church--

9
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:22,753
Celtic and Rangers.

10
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:25,085
One Catholic,
one Protestant--

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,748
us and them.

12
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:28,918
The forces of evil
and darkness

13
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:31,587
known collectively
as ''The Old Firm.''

14
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,255
There maybe no rivalry

15
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:35,265
in all of football
to match theirs,

16
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,699
maybe not in all
of sports.

17
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:40,738
For over a century, the players
have bashed heads on the field,

18
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,534
their supporters off it.

19
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:44,370
Together,
they've dominated the game

20
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:46,103
and won
the Scottish Cup more

21
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:48,771
than all the other teams
put together.

22
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:51,577
But this is not a story
about Celtic and Rangers.

23
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:54,447
There's not enough lager
in all the pubs in Glasgow

24
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:56,817
to do it justice
in a single sitting.

25
00:00:56,922 --> 00:01:00,016
Besides, only a fool
would try to get it right.

26
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,389
But any story about football
in this land

27
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,223
is colored by their rivalry.

28
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,729
Whatever your team,
big or small,

29
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:09,699
football in Scotland isn't
a matter of life or death--

30
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,736
it's more important.

31
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:19,210
( bagpipe music plays )

32
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:46,766
Minister: Dear Lord,
our Father and our Savior...

33
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:50,672
please welcome one of our own
to Your flock.

34
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:55,476
Alex Wilson
loved Kilnockie football

35
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:58,846
almost as much as he loved
his wife, Annie,

36
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,385
and his three sons.

37
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:05,719
For 47 years, he never missed
a home match.

38
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:08,850
So it is fitting
that we send him off today

39
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:12,055
in the place he liked
to call home.

40
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:16,194
A family man,
and a football man,

41
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:18,599
Alex Wilson
played the game of life

42
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:20,899
with loyalty
to those he loved,

43
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:24,032
with kindness to all he met.

44
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:27,407
He was a generous man
who never stopped trying

45
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:30,744
to help others--
right up to the final whistle.

46
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:37,578
May you rest in peace,
Alexander Wilson,

47
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,590
and may you always run
with the lads.

48
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,795
He's a fucking headcase,
Peter, a waster, eh?

49
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:47,161
What are you trying
to build,

50
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,598
a football team
or a distillery?

51
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:52,602
- He scores goals.
- Oh, aye, he could.

52
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:55,264
Couldn't score
in a brothel now.

53
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,535
Why do you think
he was available?

54
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:02,578
You know, Gordon,
I know this is a family affair.

55
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,548
I respect that.
It's none of my business, by the way,

56
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,551
but I want to make sure

57
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:09,553
you don't put
your personal feelings ahead

58
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,282
of whatever's good
for the team.

59
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,291
Buying a team is different
than running a team.

60
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,156
How do you think the lads
are gonna feel

61
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:17,922
bringing in a player
who makes more

62
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,055
- than all of them combined?
- You know what?

63
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,725
If they really wanna win,
it's not an issue.

64
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,859
- Oh.
- He puts fans in the stands.

65
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,562
You know why?
Simple.

66
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:28,196
He's really good.

67
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:30,036
He can score,
he plays defense,

68
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:31,609
he anticipates,
he can see the field.

69
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,972
He's won two Golden Boots.

70
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:35,410
This guy's gonna give us
the punch we need, Gordon,

71
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:38,415
to make a run at the Cup.
Don't you wanna win a Cup?

72
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:40,644
We've won the first
three matches without him.

73
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:43,380
I know, but now
the big boys are here.

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,012
Teams win the Cup, Peter,

75
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:48,115
not prima donnas reminiscing
over their past glories.

76
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,458
I used to have hair...

77
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:53,258
once upon a time.

78
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,423
Eh?

79
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,824
( screeching )

80
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,890
Bloody menace !

81
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,560
Where the hell
do you think you are?

82
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:34,832
Fucking nutter.

83
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,070
Peter: There's never
a League Champion year.

84
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:41,702
Not even a semifinal
appearance in a Cup.

85
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:44,748
Nothing.
1899 to 1999, nothing.

86
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:48,550
- The wilderness years.
- Gordon: Yeah.

87
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:51,452
Peter, is the meeting over?

88
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:01,189
No.

89
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:07,032
Gordon, I'm thinking about
moving this team to Dublin.

90
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,108
A Scottish football team
in Ireland?

91
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,836
Next you'll be wanting us
to play Gaelic football

92
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,377
and use our fucking hands.

93
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,970
You should be locked up.
You're kidding.

94
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:19,880
They're so hungry
for professional football.

95
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:20,917
Really hungry.

96
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,509
And they've got
a brand new stadium.

97
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,145
Don't you want more
than this?

98
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,382
I do.

99
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,684
After a hundred years,

100
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:30,023
you want to move
the Kilnockie team to Ireland?

101
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,289
You're talking about
the heartbeat of this town.

102
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,924
10 decades of tradition.

103
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:39,503
I mean, you're talking about--

104
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:41,663
you're talking about my job.

105
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:43,900
You're not going anywhere.

106
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,068
I'll tell you another thing,

107
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,409
Jackie McQuillan's
gonna make a difference too.

108
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:58,355
I want to be there
when you tell 'em

109
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:00,357
you're moving the team
to Ireland.

110
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,188
Minister:
Earth to earth,

111
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:04,455
ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,

112
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,997
in the sure
and certain hope

113
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,329
of resurrection
to eternal life,

114
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:12,426
through our Lord
Jesus Christ

115
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:14,095
Amen.

116
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:16,907
Boylie.

117
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:19,499
Come on, son, pass back!

118
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:21,272
Go on, Boylie, bury it.

119
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,210
Well done.
Good save, Brian.

120
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:25,647
Go on, Kirky.

121
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:28,481
Yes, good save.

122
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,715
Get in there, Silky.

123
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,656
Come on, Silky.

124
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:42,462
Jesus Andy, you can't score
if the ball's not in the net.

125
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,762
Look, lads,
it's where you put it,

126
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,531
not where you point it
that counts.

127
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:49,607
Aye, goes for your women
as well, right?

128
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,074
Okay, Romeo,
you show 'em how it's done.

129
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,274
( speaking foreign language )

130
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,443
There's three points
in American football, cap.

131
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,646
Okay, smart-mouth,
let's see how well you do.

132
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:06,383
- Let's put the Yank in the net.
- Give 'em hell, Kelsey.

133
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,189
Well done, Kelsey.

134
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,358
Not bad for a pizza boy
from the States.

135
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,702
Well done, Kelsey.

136
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:22,205
Go on, go on.

137
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:23,365
Where, where's he going?

138
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:25,443
Hey!
Where's he going?

139
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:27,034
Hey, Diego! Hey!

140
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:29,238
- Where's he going?
- Home?

141
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:31,042
I don't think he likes
the weather.

142
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:32,616
Hey, come here.

143
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,447
Diego, come here.

144
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,386
Come back here !

145
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,219
Hey!

146
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:47,456
Training begins at 10:00 sharp.

147
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,124
You better
tell the sheeps, Gordon.

148
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:52,465
They seem to like the roads better
than they like the fields.

149
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,163
I didn't want this.

150
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:55,739
Nor did I.

151
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,207
But I'm here to play football.

152
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,471
You were always a fuck-up,
McQuillan.

153
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,604
Always will be.

154
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,509
Nice to see you too,
Gordon.

155
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:07,846
Aye.

156
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,533
Fucking hell.

157
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:25,464
Alan Barnes, Jackie.

158
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,868
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How are you doing, Alan?

159
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:30,771
We're probably happier to have you
than you are to be here,

160
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:32,844
but you know, just--

161
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:34,878
just think of it as Parkhead.

162
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,448
A wee bit different.
What do you think?

163
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,876
- Okay then.
- I'll show you the guys.

164
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,154
Woman:
I wonder how it went today--

165
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:51,991
Jackie and Dad together again.

166
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:54,122
If Jackie showed up.

167
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,690
Yeah, well, he told me
he was going to.

168
00:08:57,802 --> 00:09:00,635
He told you a lot of things
he was going to do.

169
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,106
We've started
seeing each other again.

170
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:08,344
Landing in the Second Division
hit him hard, Mom.

171
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:12,378
- Let alone here.
- He's lucky to be here.

172
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:15,920
He's brought enough pain
to your life, Kate.

173
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,148
He's little Jackie's father.

174
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:21,020
You can't undo
what's been done.

175
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,521
Loving them is never
the problem, is it, Mom?

176
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,360
It's everything else,

177
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,866
when you share your husband
with this game.

178
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:33,460
Your father and I have been
married for 40 years.

179
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:35,539
It's not the amount
of time, Mom.

180
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,632
When you marry a football man,
you become a football wife.

181
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:41,041
Talent, temperament--

182
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:42,545
the church they believe in.

183
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:44,842
Inside, I swear to God,

184
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,545
they are all driven,
stubborn, selfish,

185
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,220
and as competitive as a pack
of street dogs.

186
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:55,384
And those are probably just
the best traits.

187
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,290
The truth is that...

188
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:01,263
Jackie and Dad are actually more
alike than they are different.

189
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:02,424
( door opens )

190
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:07,600
Hi, Dad.

191
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:05,219
Hi, I'm Andy Gray.
Welcome to ''Sky Sports,''

192
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,025
here to talk about
the headline

193
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:09,566
that's dominated
Scottish football.

194
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,567
It is, of course,
the recent signing

195
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,398
by Kilnockie
of Jackie McQuillan,

196
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:15,405
twice a Golden Boot winner.

197
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,737
No doubt the supporters
will be looking forward

198
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:19,901
to some great
goal scoring magic.

199
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,911
So, let's take a look back
at the career

200
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,844
of this legendary
Celtic striker.

201
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:52,266
Jackie !

202
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,732
Gray:
The question now is...

203
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:19,736
he may be down,
but is he out?

204
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:21,237
Will the gamble pay off

205
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,239
for Kilnockie's
American owner,

206
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:26,572
Peter Cameron,
and manager, Gordon McCleod?

207
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,751
All of Scotland
will be watching.

208
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,539
Hey, Jackie.

209
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,370
How are you doing?

210
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,410
I just wanted to say
what an honor it was

211
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:03,072
to be playing on
the same field with you today.

212
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:05,547
When I was in college
I used to watch

213
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,550
the satellite feed
of your matches.

214
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,279
And I remember the time

215
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:12,550
where you beat
three Rangers defenders,

216
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:14,386
and dinked the ball

217
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,722
over the keeper's head
to get the winner--

218
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,386
in injury time.

219
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,561
Man, that was--

220
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,066
that was some goal.

221
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,299
I'm sorry,
I forgot your name.

222
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,408
Kelsey.

223
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:35,906
Kelsey, let me give you
a piece of advice.

224
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:39,582
You don't live
in the past, son.

225
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,247
- Announcer: St. Mirren...
- Man: Shh.

226
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:47,586
Announcer:
...will play Kilmarnock.

227
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:56,358
Dundee will play

228
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,196
Queen of the South.

229
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,565
Kilnockie...

230
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:08,073
will play Dumbarton.

231
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:09,703
( cheering )

232
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,556
( phone rings )

233
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:26,220
- Hello?
- Hello, Irene.

234
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:28,231
- Is Gordon there?
- Uh-huh, Ian, he is.

235
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,060
- Great news.
- He's just coming.

236
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:36,905
- Ian.
- Hey, gaffer.

237
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,737
- Aye.
- Have you heard the draw?

238
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:40,003
Dumbarton, at home.

239
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:42,136
Gives us a right chance
to get through, eh?

240
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,078
Only if we score
more goals than they do.

241
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:47,083
- Oh, I'm sure we will.
- Aye, it's great.

242
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,653
- Okay then, bye.
- Talk to you later.

243
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,700
Dumbarton, eh?

244
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:08,704
Maybe we'll go one more.

245
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:10,364
Oh, aye, maybe.

246
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:18,548
Was Jackie
at training today?

247
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,117
Jackie?

248
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:23,048
Late.

249
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:28,382
Sheep on the road.

250
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:33,054
If it's not one thing
it's another.

251
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:34,722
Mmm.

252
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:43,232
I thought he was out
of my life forever.

253
00:15:57,955 --> 00:16:01,686
Are we planning on having
another child, Gordon?

254
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,693
Eh?

255
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:07,524
( scoffs )

256
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:13,699
Then you might try saying hello
to the one you do have.

257
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,697
The only one.

258
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,390
Right here.

259
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:42,723
Hey, hold.

260
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,002
- Cheers.
- Hi.

261
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:50,836
Hello.
Hey, hi, son.

262
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,933
- What's your name?
- Martin Christie, sir.

263
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,944
- What position you play?
- Sweeper, sir.

264
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:57,879
Sweeper. Too bad.
You'll go against Jackie McQuillan.

265
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:00,678
If he gets half a step on you,
the ball's in the net.

266
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,917
Hello, gaffer.

267
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:05,852
Go shit a brick
somewhere, eh?

268
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,187
Good to see you.
Cheers.

269
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,192
Hello, Rob MacLean
and Andy Gray here

270
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:12,125
on the Cup trail
at Kilnockie

271
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,198
against Dumbarton.

272
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:16,027
It's the fourth round
of the Cup,

273
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,533
we're down to the last 16

274
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,865
and little Kilnockie hopes
the road to glory

275
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:21,871
starts here for them
against Dumbarton.

276
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,941
And, Andy, Jackie's back.

277
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,374
No doubt about that.
That's who we're all here to see.

278
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:30,072
He may have been in London
with Arsenal for two years,

279
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:32,809
but the fans certainly
haven't forgotten the boy.

280
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:35,147
Hey, hey, Colin. Colin !

281
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:38,711
Tell your wife I'll be around
Tuesday morning as usual.

282
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,222
Some girl that, Colin, eh?

283
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:42,554
You big fucking Nancy boy!

284
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,391
I hear your wife's a bit
of a goalkeeper, too, eh?

285
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:48,556
She lets everything in
but the balls !

286
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:52,500
# When I'm calling you #

287
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:54,662
# We've all shagged her too. #

288
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:57,434
On the bench is the Kilnockie
manager, Gordon McCleod.

289
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,976
There must be mixed feelings
for him at the moment

290
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:01,977
as his long-removed son-in-law

291
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,512
returns to Scottish football.

292
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,172
And, Andy,
I wonder what sort

293
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,615
of physical shape
Jackie's in.

294
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,549
Physically he looks
a little heavy,

295
00:18:09,654 --> 00:18:12,680
but he'll lose those pounds
in the next month or so.

296
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,690
It's mentally
where I've got a worry.

297
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,521
This is a young lad
who's played

298
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,185
at the top level all
of his life.

299
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,196
He's won the Golden Boot
twice as well.

300
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,459
He doesn't know
what life's like at this level.

301
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,195
Here he is today playing for
a Second Division and the Cup,

302
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:28,704
and not only that,
playing for his father-in-law.

303
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,603
Come on !

304
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,199
The first real attack
on goal.

305
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:35,871
And the first real test
of Brian Burns

306
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,040
in the Kilnockie goal
but the shot flies wide.

307
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,981
Get it out.

308
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:42,746
We're on the attack.

309
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,891
That's Peter Cameron,

310
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,792
the American owner
of Kilnockie,

311
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,262
looking on nervously.

312
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,326
First 40 minutes
of this match or so,

313
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:00,495
I'm looking
at Jackie's performance.

314
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:02,505
he looks a little
heavy legged to me.

315
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:05,337
He looks a little off the pace,
but his touch is good.

316
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:08,742
But if you give this guy
half a chance, he'll take it.

317
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:12,145
So Kilnockie continuing
to press forward,

318
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,343
but still no break through.

319
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,985
Corner kick.

320
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:20,524
And Owen Coyle
will take this one.

321
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:30,664
Left footed, curling it in.

322
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,531
He's aimed it
towards McQuillan.

323
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:34,195
Up goes Jackie McQuillan !

324
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,933
His header--
And the opening goal !

325
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,872
Kilnockie are ahead !

326
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,074
Daddy scored !
Yeah !

327
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,377
You talk about fitness,
you don't need it.

328
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,884
He needs half a yard.

329
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:50,749
We said the boy was
a finisher.

330
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,846
He's just shown the whole
of Kilnockie

331
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:54,720
he hasn't lost the magic art.

332
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,884
A minute before half time.

333
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:59,929
What a great boost that is
for Kilnockie.

334
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,623
What happened?
What happened?!

335
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,893
Well what the fuck
do you think happened?!

336
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:06,060
Yes ! Yes !

337
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,468
Yes !

338
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:09,904
That was pure instinct.

339
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:12,407
The timing of the run.
And it's one-nil.

340
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:17,913
( chattering )

341
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:32,320
Malkie.

342
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,728
Fucking Malkie.

343
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:38,268
The most recognizable striker
in all of Scotland,

344
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:40,599
and not one
of you fuckwits mark him.

345
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:42,263
Is he talking about you?

346
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,136
I don't think it's you,
that's for sure.

347
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,801
Malcolm, you're hanging around
like a fart in a trance.

348
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:48,640
Can you not see McQuillan?

349
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:52,045
Well, if he's not Casper
the fucking ghost, mark him !

350
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,049
'Cause if you don't,
you'll be beside me

351
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,210
on the bench for the rest
of the fucking season

352
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,515
getting skelfs in your arse !
Fucking do it!

353
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,284
Do it!

354
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:03,554
Just because you don't like
my biscuits,

355
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,822
doesn't mean you can break
my crockery!

356
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,262
Not in this place you don't.

357
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,697
( whistle sounds )

358
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,563
Announcer:
Well, it's been all Dumbarton

359
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,502
for the last 20 minutes,
but I do feel that Kilnockie

360
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,073
have defended comfortably.
No real dramas.

361
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:19,404
I just think that
they're gonna see it through.

362
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,239
I think they're in
the next round.

363
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:26,082
And there goes
the final whistle.

364
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:29,584
Mike McCurry, the referee,
brings the match to an end.

365
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:33,589
And the celebrations are
with the Kilnockie supporters.

366
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:37,593
They are through to the last
eight of the Cup.

367
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,596
And the match winner
is Jackie McQuillan.

368
00:21:40,698 --> 00:21:42,188
The only goal of the game.

369
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,597
The header
from Owen Coyle's corner.

370
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:47,227
Kilnockie march on.

371
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:50,000
Well, the chairman'll be
a pretty pleased man

372
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:51,870
because he said that
Jackie McQuillan

373
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:54,376
would put bumps on seats,
would score goals,

374
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:57,208
and he's done both
of those today.

375
00:21:57,314 --> 00:21:58,645
This'll be interesting.

376
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:01,047
The manager hugging
every player as they come off.

377
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:03,882
What about the son-in-law?
What about the goal scorer?

378
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,388
What does he get?
A good firm hand shake.

379
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:48,892
I thought you might like
some tea, boss.

380
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:06,312
I won't be late,
I'm having dinner with your dad.

381
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,214
Why can't I come?

382
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:10,048
Well, because then Maggie

383
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:12,088
would have no one
to keep her company.

384
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:13,816
I'm not that much fun.

385
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,222
Oh yes, you are.

386
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:22,559
( moaning )

387
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,226
Yes !
Oh, Jackie !

388
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:27,896
Oh, Jackie !

389
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:31,406
( phone ringing )

390
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:44,086
( ringing continues )

391
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,850
Oh, shit.

392
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:56,193
Katie, what was
I supposed to do?

393
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,598
It was the first match.
It was our first win.

394
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:00,693
How could I not go out
with them?

395
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,500
And you couldn't
have called?

396
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:05,040
Couldn't have torn yourself
away from the lads,

397
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,939
for what, 30 seconds?

398
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:10,445
- I should've.
- I thought you'd stopped drinking.

399
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:13,813
Drinking-drinking, I have.

400
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:15,818
I haven't touched
the hard stuff.

401
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,785
But I just figured,
after the match

402
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:19,719
a couple of beers
with the boys--

403
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:22,019
Jackie,
what will you ever do

404
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,026
the day you run out
of excuses?

405
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:26,528
'Cause God knows, Jackie,
it is a thick book.

406
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,791
But somehow,
I just--

407
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,799
I keep thinking

408
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:34,359
you must be near the end.
You must be.

409
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:36,371
So are you,
Jackie?

410
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:41,537
'Cause, my book of patience
is just almost as thick.

411
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:44,409
But I know
I'm at the end.

412
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,343
Katie.

413
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:52,354
Great goal,
Jackie.

414
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,752
Yeah, I want 50 quid
on Hearts.

415
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:00,626
I want 50 quid
on Trap Five.

416
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:03,461
Yeah, and give me
200 quid on the Rangers.

417
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,626
Okay?

418
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,940
You should try this new
invention, Gordon.

419
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:15,511
Called a car.

420
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,309
I prefer this thing
they call exercise.

421
00:25:18,415 --> 00:25:20,280
It's a little
old-fashioned, Jackie,

422
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,249
but you might want
to try it.

423
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:24,253
It doesn't
run out of gas--

424
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,118
at the end
of the game.

425
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:58,483
Okay...

426
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:01,057
after the draw,
we'll know who's up next.

427
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:04,423
But it won't matter if we play
like we played on Saturday.

428
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:06,553
That'll be out last
go in the Cup,

429
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:09,258
and our last chance
to make up any ground.

430
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:13,803
'Cause we're not the most
talented team in Scotland.

431
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,304
So we'll go only as far--

432
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:18,500
as our hearts

433
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:20,907
and our lungs
will carry us.

434
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:23,070
Now, the heart is
up to you.

435
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,512
The lungs I can help you with
and will.

436
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:27,413
That's my job.

437
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:29,816
And maybe get
using this.

438
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,888
Or some wee part of it.

439
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:34,753
You give me the heart,
I'll give you the lungs.

440
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:39,654
And together we'll
work on the head.

441
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:41,822
Eh, go on,
Jackie.

442
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:43,900
One more time.
Eh, one more time, eh.

443
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:46,936
That's good.
Go on, Andy.

444
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:49,597
Good.
Oh, brilliant.

445
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:51,436
Well done.

446
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,373
Perfect, perfect.

447
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:55,274
- Brilliant, brilliant.
- Hey, hey, hey.

448
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,711
Kelsey, Kelsey,
more rhythm.

449
00:26:57,815 --> 00:27:00,682
Bop-bop-bop-bop.

450
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:03,685
Bop-bop-bop-bop.

451
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:05,755
Bop-bop-bop-bop.

452
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:41,023
( whistles )

453
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,027
Great training, lads.
That's great.

454
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:54,661
If the other team looks like this
at the end of the match,

455
00:27:54,772 --> 00:27:57,741
- hey, we've got a chance.
- ( cell phone rings )

456
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,834
( cell phone rings )

457
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:03,879
Oh.

458
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:07,075
Am I interrupting
somebody's wee plans here?

459
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:08,947
( cell phone ringing )

460
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:25,163
Ian,

461
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:28,170
drive Jackie's car back
to the grounds.

462
00:28:29,273 --> 00:28:31,673
Lads, have a run home,

463
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:33,675
compliments
of Mr. McQuillan.

464
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:36,541
- ( angry chatter )
- Hey, just fucking shut it.

465
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:39,844
Listen to the gaffer
and get on with it. Move it.

466
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,214
( whistles )

467
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,616
Go. Out of here.

468
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,416
Out. Go.

469
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:48,684
Fucking tosser.

470
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,489
Tell Ronaldo our offer
is final.

471
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:22,024
And get me Zidane.

472
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,323
See ya.

473
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:28,796
One fucking dent and you'll need
an ice-pack for your bollocks !

474
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:42,541
( whistles )

475
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:44,546
( laughs )

476
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:49,117
It's a good thing,
this invention, eh?

477
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:51,551
You know, once I get
the lungs in shape

478
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:53,885
we can move onto
the head.

479
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:55,720
And work on
that together, eh, boss?

480
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:58,056
You know,
I've been thinking,

481
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:59,789
when it comes to Katie,

482
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:02,365
we're exactly where we were,
aren't we?

483
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:05,060
Celtic, Ranger--

484
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:08,366
the forces of darkness
and evil, eh, gaffer?

485
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:54,875
Give me some, Brenda.

486
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:57,215
I'm fucking starving.

487
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:59,221
You've got fuck all,
big man.

488
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:03,549
Martin Smith,
the devil himself.

489
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,060
Don't let the boss see you
reading about him.

490
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:09,223
- How come?
- Because you're in Scotland.

491
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,891
There's two camps
in Scotland.

492
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:13,196
There's the Smith camp
and the McCleod camp.

493
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:15,396
And seeing as you're playing
for the McCleods,

494
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:17,905
I suggest keeping your ass
in this one, you know?

495
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:19,908
- Yeah, thanks, Al.
- Hey, man, no problem.

496
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,409
Anytime.

497
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:22,910
Anytime.

498
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:27,249
And so that's when
the boss ended up in Dundee.

499
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:29,080
- Smith was the manager,
- Right.

500
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:31,086
Gordon was his assistant.

501
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:32,917
Along comes a new chairman.

502
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,082
Not unlike, you know,
you-know-who.

503
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:37,251
Thinks he can run
the team better than the guys

504
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:38,988
actually running
the fucking team.

505
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:41,257
So Gordon and Smithy,
they agreed to quit.

506
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:43,595
Two friends, one plan.
It's done.

507
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,258
It's done and concrete.

508
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:47,997
The boss goes in first,
hands his resignation.

509
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:50,300
Smithy goes in last.

510
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:52,102
The rest is history.

511
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:53,540
Man:
Shhh, hey, hey.

512
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:55,077
Announcer:
Hibernian...

513
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:58,875
will play
Dunfermline Athletic.

514
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:03,415
Kilnockie...

515
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,921
will play
Queen of the South.

516
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:09,549
Hey, that could
have been worse, lads.

517
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,890
That could've been
a lot fucking worse.

518
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:13,895
- Rangers...
- Shhh.

519
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:16,727
will play Celtic.

520
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,460
( crowd cheers )

521
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:20,468
Kelsey!

522
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,038
I'm joined now by former Ranger,
Andy Gray.

523
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,631
Celtic and Rangers going
head-to-head in the quarter-finals.

524
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:27,505
Unless you're a Celtic
or a Rangers fan,

525
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:29,704
you've got to be happy about
your team's chances

526
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:32,407
- of getting into the next round.
- The truth is, Rob,

527
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:34,575
if you're gonna win the Cup,
you'll have to beat

528
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,243
one of these teams
along the way.

529
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:38,913
But beating one of them is a lot
easier than beating both.

530
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:41,582
Now, you've seen your share
of Cup competition,

531
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:43,421
besides a favorable draw,

532
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:45,927
what else has to happen
for a lower division team

533
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:47,758
to have a shot at glory?

534
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:50,355
Well, scoring more goals
than your opponents helps.

535
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,867
I think big decisions have
to go your way.

536
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:54,869
You do need to get lucky.

537
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:57,371
Of course, if your name's
on the Cup, that helps.

538
00:33:01,978 --> 00:33:03,536
Thank you, sir.

539
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:26,996
Peter:
Hey, Gordon.

540
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:29,334
I'll be right down.

541
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:31,339
- How are you doing?
- Good.

542
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:33,409
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

543
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,909
Good.

544
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:41,408
You want a Coke or something?
Or a juice?

545
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:43,076
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Tea?

546
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:44,744
Okay.
Okay.

547
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:47,585
I'm sorry I was late,
I was out working in the yard.

548
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,522
Come here,
I wanna show you something.

549
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:51,526
You wanna see something cool?

550
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:53,528
Check this out, man.

551
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,191
- Oh.
- Yeah.

552
00:33:58,301 --> 00:33:59,859
- Brilliant.
- Yeah.

553
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,870
You see?
You can check our scores.

554
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:04,532
- Uh-huh, I see.
- Look at that. See?

555
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,041
Man U .
They lost.

556
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:08,873
Queen of the South.

557
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:12,008
Heard they played
like shite.

558
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:14,379
Good enough to win.

559
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:16,213
Yeah, I guess so.

560
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:18,549
You're sure you don't want
a tea or something?

561
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:20,885
- No, no, I'm fine, fine.
- You want a grape?

562
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:24,551
Let me ask you something.

563
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:28,859
What's your opinion on
where we play these guys?

564
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:31,729
Well, we drew them at home
with hometown fans.

565
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,735
Scottish fans.

566
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:36,567
- It's what you fight for.
- Yeah, I know.

567
00:34:36,673 --> 00:34:38,903
It's kinda what
I'm afraid of, you know?

568
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:41,910
They brought, like,
8,000 maniac fans

569
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:44,071
a couple of years ago
to the Coke Cup.

570
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:46,672
You know, in our stadium,
I'm not sure,

571
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:48,978
that'd be so safe.
Could get crazy.

572
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:52,486
They can buy their tickets
like everyone else.

573
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:55,752
How important do you think
home field advantage is?

574
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,349
( laughs )

575
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,691
I mean, let me ask you,

576
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:04,198
you think we can beat
a First Division team?

577
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:06,531
At my age, you take
any chance you get.

578
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:08,866
If you're lucky enough
to even get one,

579
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:11,440
you sure don't piss away
the one edge you have.

580
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,702
- Correct?
- Yeah.

581
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:17,871
You know,
I'm gonna tell you something.

582
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:20,882
If we had a bigger stadium,

583
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:24,044
we'd make a whole lot
more money on one match

584
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:28,557
than we make in any four,
all year.

585
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:32,253
Do you want to make more money
or do you want us to do better?

586
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:33,852
I wanna do both.

587
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:36,524
You've already talked
to the constable, haven't you?

588
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:39,067
Yeah.
And he agrees with me.

589
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:41,296
There's no way he can guarantee
our safety.

590
00:35:41,404 --> 00:35:43,395
That's a lot of crap
and you know it.

591
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:47,575
The safety of your wallet's
more like it. Right?

592
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:49,508
You know...

593
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,672
you know, I'm going
to tell you something.

594
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:58,015
I really respect you
and I know we both love soccer.

595
00:35:58,121 --> 00:36:01,522
And I know those guys
would lay down their lives for you.

596
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:05,527
And I know something else,
you and me we're like twins.

597
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:08,029
Thing is, Gordon,
I'm asking you to work with me.

598
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:11,032
'Cause if our name's
on the Cup,

599
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:13,102
it doesn't matter
where we play.

600
00:36:13,203 --> 00:36:15,501
- You know what I mean?
- Cheers.

601
00:36:22,812 --> 00:36:24,370
Whew. Boy.

602
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:38,217
Announcer:
It was the name of Kilnockie

603
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:40,922
which came out of the hat first,
but it's turned into

604
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:42,999
a home game
for Queen of the South.

605
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,795
They've given away
home advantage, have Kilnockie.

606
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:47,563
Will the gamble pay off?

607
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:49,832
Well, the next 90 minutes
will tell us that,

608
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,703
but I know Gordon McCleod
was furious

609
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:54,572
and didn't agree
with his chairman, Peter Cameron.

610
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:56,509
It's a fantastic atmosphere.

611
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:59,844
Queen of the South going into
this one, obviously, as the favorites.

612
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,181
They're in the First Division,
Kilnockie from the Second.

613
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:05,948
But with Jackie McQuillan
up front, anything's possible.

614
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,861
Gordon:
How you doing? See you.

615
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:13,691
Go easy on the lads today.

616
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:15,526
Not used to playing
you big boys.

617
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:17,691
Graham, what are you looking
so serious for?

618
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:19,666
It's only us.
He-man, eh?

619
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,737
All right?

620
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,600
Announcer:
There's not much doubt

621
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,471
about the match
in the quarter-finals.

622
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:29,545
It's the meeting
of The Old Firm at Ibrox.

623
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:32,547
But try telling that
to the people packed inside

624
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:34,549
Palmerston for this one.

625
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:35,948
And, of course, Andy,

626
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:38,020
one of The Old Firms today
will perish.

627
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:39,816
Hey, deefie !
Hey, deefie !

628
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:43,154
Is that your wife cleaning
the bogs up behind the terraces?

629
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,318
'Cause there's a big queue
of guys up there

630
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:47,896
and they're all smiling
like fucking Coco the Clown !

631
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:49,465
( sings circus melody )

632
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:56,003
- Hello.
- Hi.

633
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:58,006
I though you had
too much class work.

634
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:01,134
Always, but a girl's got
to have some fun.

635
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:03,041
Announcer:
It's a ridiculous decision

636
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:06,479
for the chairman to force
this team to go away from home

637
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:09,051
and give up home advantage,
especially when the team

638
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,779
you're playing
is a division above.

639
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:13,412
He's only chasing the fast buck.
That's wrong.

640
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:18,151
We've had a good run
in the Cup, lads,

641
00:38:18,261 --> 00:38:20,661
and I'm proud of you.
I'm proud.

642
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:23,699
But now we're in against
the bigger teams.

643
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,859
Now, you know,
what they're thinking about

644
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,869
right now in there, eh?

645
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:30,863
Their next match.

646
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:33,374
They've already beaten you.
I've seen their eyes.

647
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:36,707
You're nothing but a 90-minute
pass to the semi-finals.

648
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:39,543
So, let them play
their next match up here,

649
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:43,381
we'll play this one out there.

650
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:44,919
Get the result

651
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:47,922
and tell them they missed
a hell of a game, okay?

652
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:49,924
Everybody up and let's go.

653
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:51,891
- ( cheering )
- Let's go.

654
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:02,230
Announcer: A chance
to make progress to the semi-finals

655
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:04,670
as this match gets under way.

656
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:07,341
( whistle )

657
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:15,846
Looking early on at McQuillan,

658
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:17,852
I think he might
find himself very,

659
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:20,855
very tightly marked
this afternoon.

660
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:23,687
That little burst of pace
wasn't there a month ago.

661
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:25,226
It's there now.

662
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:27,762
And he sparks
the first attack on Coyle

663
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:30,492
at the back post
and Andy Smith'seffort

664
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,364
spins up into the arms
of the goalkeeper.

665
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:36,871
They're under pressure here

666
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:39,533
as an attack is sparked

667
00:39:39,642 --> 00:39:40,870
by Queen of the South.

668
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:42,706
And that's a good solid save.

669
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:44,609
Well behind it was Brian Burns.

670
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,306
They've given away
home advantage,

671
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,441
they don't wanna give away
the first goal.

672
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:50,143
That's a very important save.

673
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:56,289
Coylie, Coylie !

674
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:01,261
- For fuck's sake !
- And that's a heavy tackle.

675
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,729
That's a bad tackle.

676
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:04,459
You won't get
a fucking sniff today.

677
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,159
You're fucking mine
all fucking day.

678
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,829
Announcer: We wondered
who would be the man marker,

679
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:11,566
- and it's Derek McCall.
- ( crowd chants ''Off! '' )

680
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:14,472
That's a cynical,
crude tackle from behind.

681
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:16,408
A little message from McCall--

682
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:18,572
'' Hey, McQuillan,
there's more to come.''

683
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:21,582
A minute to go
in the first half.

684
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,818
It's Queens on the attack.

685
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:27,856
It's Angus Doyle
with the shot.

686
00:40:27,957 --> 00:40:29,925
And he scores !

687
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:32,256
Through the legs of Burns.

688
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:35,160
A blunder by the keeper.

689
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:37,756
That won't endear him
to the manager.

690
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:39,698
And Queens have the lead.

691
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,498
What a blow for Kilnockie.

692
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:45,267
44 minutes of great defending
spoiled by one mistake.

693
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:50,878
You mentioned the manager.
He won't be happy.

694
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,777
He's an ex-goalkeeper.

695
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:56,808
Fucking !

696
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:07,752
- Boss...
- Hey!

697
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:11,527
I'm sorry. I should have shut
my fucking legs.

698
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:14,262
No, son, no. Your mother
should have shut hers.

699
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,410
Okay.

700
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:28,408
They're marking close, lads.

701
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:31,248
You've got to move without the ball
to lose your marker.

702
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:33,254
Try and work off your man.

703
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:35,756
Stretch them a bit
at the back, okay?

704
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,920
And make 'em work.
Alan, your first touch

705
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:43,260
is taking it farther than
I could kick it. Relax on the ball.

706
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:45,766
Son, their striker
always fakes to one side

707
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:48,337
and pushes it onto
his right foot every time.

708
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:52,204
- Right, okay, yeah.
- Jim, keep going, wee man.

709
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:54,868
Superb.
Aye, aye.

710
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:58,539
Brian, you've got 45 minutes
to make amends.

711
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:01,940
Get yourself an early touch,

712
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:04,713
and command the area, right?

713
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:06,880
Okay, boss.

714
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,220
( stuttering )
Is there anything else?

715
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:11,691
Don't give away
any more

716
00:42:11,794 --> 00:42:13,352
f-f-fucking goals.

717
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:15,363
( laughter )

718
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,733
How will Kilnockie respond
in the second half?

719
00:42:19,836 --> 00:42:23,465
What a psychological blow
it was to concede that goal

720
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:25,700
in the final minute
of the first half.

721
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:28,106
And they need to give
themselves some belief--

722
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:30,736
And it's McQuillan.
Oh, unbelievable !

723
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,077
What a start
to the second half!

724
00:42:33,182 --> 00:42:34,877
The question is answered.

725
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:37,009
- It's one-one.
- Oh, what a response.

726
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,747
You know,
people often ask me

727
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:40,413
when managers earn
their money.

728
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:42,047
Half time it's one
of those times.

729
00:42:42,158 --> 00:42:43,921
And the manager's earned
his dough there.

730
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:46,359
He sent his team out
absolutely flying.

731
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:49,187
We talked about man marking.

732
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:51,699
You can get as tight
as you like against this boy.

733
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:54,861
McCall was, but McQuillan's
ability was too good.

734
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:56,871
What a finish from the kid.

735
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:01,642
Here come Kilnockie again.
And Owen Coyle.

736
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:05,073
He's aimed it toward
McQuillan.

737
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:07,877
Onto his right foot,
the shot and the goal !

738
00:43:07,984 --> 00:43:10,384
It's another one
for Kilnockie.

739
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:14,047
On me, lads.
Someone up there loves us today.

740
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:17,054
There's time
to lose it yet.

741
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:25,594
Queen of the South
now trying to battle

742
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,863
their way back
into the Cup tie.

743
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:31,805
And that's a bad foul by
McQuillan this time on McCall.

744
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:35,000
He's hitting back after
a fair bit of provocation

745
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:37,409
- and that's not clever.
- It's not the way you do it.

746
00:43:37,513 --> 00:43:39,572
Scoring goals is the way
you do it for him.

747
00:43:39,682 --> 00:43:41,582
But that's just a little bit
of revenge.

748
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:43,743
He has been kicked
from pillar to post, though,

749
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:45,718
for most of this game
by McCall,

750
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:47,756
so I suppose
we could see it coming.

751
00:43:55,465 --> 00:44:00,027
That deflected shot
was well held by Brian Burns.

752
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:02,036
Kilnockie have defended well.

753
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:05,505
That was a good confident,
solid stop

754
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:07,542
and that gives confidence
to his defense.

755
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:12,713
And Jimmy Boyle flights it
across towards McQuillan.

756
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:16,911
His overhead kick!
Oh, that's brilliant!

757
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,453
( crowd cheers )

758
00:44:18,554 --> 00:44:20,249
And that is surely the goal

759
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:22,654
which takes Kilnockie through
to the semis.

760
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:24,784
It's also the goal
of the competition.

761
00:44:24,894 --> 00:44:26,953
If he was Brazilian,
we would be talking about

762
00:44:27,063 --> 00:44:28,894
this goal for the rest
of the season.

763
00:44:28,998 --> 00:44:31,523
There's talkers
and there's fucking doers.

764
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:33,602
Just like I'm doing
your fucking missus.

765
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:35,898
- You shouldn't let her go.
- What did you say?

766
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:38,030
That's a sweet fucking shag,
your wife Jackie.

767
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:39,904
But wait a minute,
what's happening here?

768
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:42,239
He's lost the plot!

769
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:45,246
He's lashed out,
it's McQuillan at McCall.

770
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:47,441
- Words were said.
- See you later, asshole.

771
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,543
McQuillan lashed out
and there's only one outcome.

772
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,849
Referee Willie Young
holds up the red card.

773
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:56,186
McQuillan off.
Kilnockie down to 10 men.

774
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:58,192
- I give up.
- What is he doing?

775
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:01,695
He's absolutely mad.

776
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:05,529
In those 15 seconds,
we've just seen a cameo of this man.

777
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:07,535
From the sheer brilliance
of a hat trick,

778
00:45:07,637 --> 00:45:09,696
to the sheer stupidity
of his actions.

779
00:45:09,806 --> 00:45:12,400
- Unbelievable.
- Fuck's sake !

780
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:14,499
Get your fucking sellin' out
on the road.

781
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,874
What are you fucking
on about?!

782
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:19,038
He might need that
medical bag if the manager,

783
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:20,877
Gordon McCleod, gets to him.

784
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:27,148
Reporter:
What prompted the fight, Gordon?

785
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:30,714
You know Jackie, he could start
a fight in an empty house.

786
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,385
What did you tell him?

787
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:35,396
I told him you cannot score
from the stands.

788
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:38,399
A wee bit of the old Jackie
out there today, aye, Gordon?

789
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:39,627
Aye, aye.

790
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:42,727
But old or new, eh,
old or new,

791
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,399
it's the team that win
or loses.

792
00:45:45,508 --> 00:45:47,567
I like the way
my lads hung on at the end.

793
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:50,510
There have been some rumors
about your team going to Dublin.

794
00:45:50,613 --> 00:45:52,843
Can you comment on that?

795
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:54,849
I think the Irish
have enough troubles

796
00:45:54,951 --> 00:45:57,647
without sending them
this team.

797
00:45:57,753 --> 00:46:00,347
- Thanks, Jackie.
- No problem.

798
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:08,692
Maybe someday my own kid
will get to see me play, eh?

799
00:46:08,798 --> 00:46:10,197
Oh, play.

800
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:12,824
Is that what you call
your performance today?

801
00:46:12,935 --> 00:46:14,960
Why do you think
I stopped bringing him?

802
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:17,539
- That guy was a wanker.
- And you had absolutely

803
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,632
no trouble sinking
to his level, did you?

804
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:22,540
Dad's dream is winning
that Cup.

805
00:46:22,645 --> 00:46:24,203
Now you're defending him.

806
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:26,838
It'd be a bad living defending
the likes of you two.

807
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:29,543
I'm driving.

808
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:33,213
How come everybody's driving
my fucking car but me?

809
00:46:58,781 --> 00:47:00,908
Drinking beer out
of a whiskey bottle?

810
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:07,847
What are we doing here?

811
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:09,982
How can you know
where you're going, Jackie,

812
00:47:10,092 --> 00:47:12,060
if you can't remember
where you're from?

813
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,719
The Gorbals.

814
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:16,525
The birthplace of the great
Jackie McQuillan.

815
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:20,597
You say you want
to get back together.

816
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:22,694
You can't even pull
yourself together.

817
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:24,568
You're sill drinking.

818
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:27,370
Still getting tossed out
of games.

819
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:29,205
So what's changed, huh?

820
00:47:29,312 --> 00:47:31,212
What is different
since I left?

821
00:47:31,314 --> 00:47:33,373
What's in it for me
and little Jackie,

822
00:47:33,482 --> 00:47:35,507
except more of the same?

823
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:41,282
Katie, where are you going?

824
00:47:42,658 --> 00:47:44,125
Home.

825
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:46,718
At least I know where it is.

826
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:57,004
There's no danger
of her being here, eh?

827
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:59,506
Honest to God, Gordon,

828
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:02,169
you'd think it was a virus
you were discussing

829
00:48:02,278 --> 00:48:04,337
and not your own flesh
and blood.

830
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:08,949
( bell rings )

831
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:16,023
Granny!
Grandpa !

832
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,355
Oh, my wee man,
how are you doing?

833
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:20,952
Maggie?
Maggie, it's us.

834
00:49:58,994 --> 00:50:00,894
Striker, eh?

835
00:50:14,343 --> 00:50:16,402
Rangers' quarter-final
victory today

836
00:50:16,512 --> 00:50:19,208
was overshadowed
by violence which broke out

837
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:22,341
inside Ibrox with little more
than a minute to play

838
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:24,749
and spilled
onto the streets.

839
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:26,583
Police were able
to restore order,

840
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:28,350
but not before
three supporters

841
00:50:28,457 --> 00:50:30,152
were taken
to the hospital.

842
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:31,590
Another dozen were arrested

843
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:34,128
- and flare-ups were reported...
- Hurry up, Campbell.

844
00:50:35,698 --> 00:50:39,031
Rangers go through with
a four-two victory at home.

845
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:42,730
But the score is still being settled
in some parts of Glasgow.

846
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:44,931
In other Cup
quarter-final action,

847
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,667
Dunfermline
were victors today

848
00:50:46,776 --> 00:50:48,937
along with Kilmarnock
and little Kilnockie.

849
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:54,208
Come on !

850
00:50:56,585 --> 00:50:58,314
Quick, get in the car!

851
00:50:58,421 --> 00:50:59,581
Move quick.

852
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:01,315
I'm Jackie McQuillan.
Now move.

853
00:51:01,424 --> 00:51:03,392
Quick.

854
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:05,892
What are you doing?
Are you stupid?

855
00:51:05,995 --> 00:51:07,895
You should know better
than that.

856
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:13,728
You're lucky I was the one
that picked you up.

857
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:16,066
- Make sure he gets home, boss.
- No problem.

858
00:51:16,172 --> 00:51:18,231
Cheers.

859
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,241
By the way, if I had a real top,
I'd give you one.

860
00:51:22,678 --> 00:51:24,407
Okay?

861
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:31,752
Vendor: Evening Times !

862
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:34,414
Times !

863
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:36,582
Evening Times !

864
00:51:41,197 --> 00:51:43,757
Gordon: The problem is,
people don't change.

865
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:45,993
No, not in the basic way.

866
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:48,092
No matter what happens,

867
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:50,695
what they go through,
what they stand to lose.

868
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:53,874
You are what you are.

869
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:56,877
Aye.

870
00:52:00,983 --> 00:52:05,215
Just be as hard on yourself
as you are on others.

871
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:09,018
You too, eh?

872
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:12,059
- ( laughs )
- Gordon.

873
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:17,723
That's fine, Irene.

874
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,391
No, no, that's fine.

875
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:27,237
I'm not saying there haven't
been disappointments.

876
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:29,072
Disappointments?

877
00:52:29,178 --> 00:52:31,009
What are you talking about?

878
00:52:31,113 --> 00:52:33,877
Jackie getting red-carded
isn't a disappointment,

879
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:35,746
just an accident waiting
to happen.

880
00:52:35,851 --> 00:52:38,251
I'm surprised it took so long.

881
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:40,914
What I don't need is you
or anyone else telling me

882
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:43,583
how I'm supposed to feel
when people knife me

883
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:45,922
in the back or take something
precious from me.

884
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,431
I just think it's time
you let something precious

885
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:52,364
back into your life.

886
00:52:52,468 --> 00:52:55,835
It'll be time
when it's time, okay?

887
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:04,374
But seeing
those pictures today...

888
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,038
of wee Jackie,

889
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:13,546
it was like viewing something
beautiful while walking on glass.

890
00:53:13,656 --> 00:53:16,386
'Cause here
there was only joy.

891
00:53:16,492 --> 00:53:19,723
But in my guts,
deep down,

892
00:53:19,828 --> 00:53:21,728
it's a terrible gnawing.

893
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:25,896
'Cause, Irene,
there's not a day that passes

894
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:30,332
( sobbing )

895
00:53:33,842 --> 00:53:37,243
I don't think about Katie.
My sweet, sweet Katie.

896
00:53:41,016 --> 00:53:42,745
Not a minute I don't hurt.

897
00:53:53,128 --> 00:53:56,859
But it wasn't me who married outside
the church she was brought up in,

898
00:53:56,966 --> 00:54:00,527
just like it wasn't me who hung
his best friend out to dry.

899
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:02,695
Nor is it me who pissed
away more talent

900
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:05,535
than God gave any other
10 players put together.

901
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:09,338
But it was me...

902
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:12,243
who had his daughter stolen
from him.

903
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:15,044
- Jackie never stole Kate--
- She was engaged to be married

904
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,710
to another man when Jackie McQuillan
stepped into her life.

905
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,584
- What do you call that?
- They fell in love, Gordon.

906
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:22,714
You can't change some things.

907
00:54:22,825 --> 00:54:24,554
You just said it.

908
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:28,729
But you can change the way
you look at things

909
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:31,299
and think about them.

910
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,891
So tell me,
just how are you looking

911
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:36,062
at the prospect
of me looking for a job

912
00:54:36,171 --> 00:54:40,073
when the team moves
to Dublin?

913
00:55:09,805 --> 00:55:11,864
You only betray yourself,
Gordon,

914
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:13,874
if you can't let go

915
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:15,876
of the things
that cause you pain.

916
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:20,877
I don't care if you ever talk
to Martin Smith again.

917
00:55:22,484 --> 00:55:24,714
But it's not the same
with Kate.

918
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:29,890
She loves you
with all her heart.

919
00:55:32,327 --> 00:55:33,658
And you know why?

920
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:38,899
Because some things
never change.

921
00:56:17,806 --> 00:56:19,535
( crowd cheering )

922
00:57:19,234 --> 00:57:21,134
( yelling )

923
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:30,811
Yes !

924
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:32,813
Promoted
to the First Division, man.

925
00:57:34,149 --> 00:57:35,707
Congratulations.

926
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:38,877
Listen to these guys.

927
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:41,046
Is that good enough
to keep us here?

928
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:45,752
You're the talk of all Scotland.
Everybody's digging you.

929
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:47,886
Let's just keep everybody talking
till you and me

930
00:57:47,996 --> 00:57:49,930
are drinking
from the Cup, huh?

931
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:54,497
- Towels, boys.
- ( yelling )

932
00:57:58,941 --> 00:58:00,841
( laughs )

933
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,169
That's outrageous, eh?

934
00:58:05,447 --> 00:58:07,540
Right. Okay.

935
00:58:07,649 --> 00:58:10,982
Let's see if you can beat
your old man with a spot kick.

936
00:58:11,086 --> 00:58:13,520
Don't fancy.
Give it your best.

937
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:15,180
Come on.

938
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:18,320
Yeah !

939
00:58:18,427 --> 00:58:20,190
Yeah !

940
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:26,366
You know your trouble?

941
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:28,527
You've been watching too much
Italian football.

942
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:31,538
- I haven't.
- You have. Now come here.

943
00:58:32,975 --> 00:58:35,944
The whole object
is to be cool.

944
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:37,875
Scoring a goal should be
as natural

945
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,210
as having your breakfast.

946
00:58:40,315 --> 00:58:43,807
Usually one fist gets
the job done.

947
00:58:43,919 --> 00:58:46,547
The attitude should be

948
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,714
plenty more
where that came from.

949
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:52,688
Now, let's talk about
the goal.

950
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:54,989
The spectacular goal.

951
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:56,826
The goal that wins
the Cup Final.

952
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:00,761
What you've got to do is freeze
and capture the moment.

953
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:04,600
Both hands in the air,
fists raised.

954
00:59:04,706 --> 00:59:07,300
You don't move,
and you remember...

955
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:11,846
all these people in the stadium
are here because of you.

956
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:15,416
How's this?

957
00:59:15,517 --> 00:59:17,485
Perfect.

958
00:59:17,586 --> 00:59:20,020
Now, here's the set-up.

959
00:59:22,124 --> 00:59:24,024
Cup Final.

960
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:25,684
Hampden Park.

961
00:59:25,794 --> 00:59:28,092
50,000 fans.

962
00:59:28,196 --> 00:59:30,528
It's a penalty shoot out.

963
00:59:30,632 --> 00:59:33,362
Everybody's scored.

964
00:59:33,468 --> 00:59:36,028
And you have got
the last kick.

965
00:59:36,138 --> 00:59:37,696
You know something?

966
00:59:40,142 --> 00:59:41,803
You're shitting your pants.

967
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,605
You've got to beat me.

968
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:46,644
Right, come on.

969
00:59:46,748 --> 00:59:48,340
Oh ! Now remember...

970
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:52,216
50,000 fans.

971
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:55,520
Can you hear them?

972
00:59:55,624 --> 00:59:57,717
Give me your best.
Come on then, give us it.

973
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:04,325
Yeah !

974
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:12,572
Are you all right?

975
01:00:12,674 --> 01:00:14,539
I just keep thinking
about that boy.

976
01:00:16,345 --> 01:00:18,870
It could just as easily
have been wee Jackie, you know?

977
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:21,074
Wearing his Celtic top

978
01:00:21,183 --> 01:00:22,878
in the wrong part of town.

979
01:00:22,985 --> 01:00:25,977
About to get hurt because
of that.

980
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:29,051
Yeah, well,
you saved him, babe.

981
01:00:29,157 --> 01:00:31,489
You should be
happy about that.

982
01:00:31,593 --> 01:00:34,426
You know the press, they blew
everything out of proportion.

983
01:00:35,697 --> 01:00:37,562
Those kids never even
saw him.

984
01:00:41,703 --> 01:00:44,228
It's still us versus them.

985
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:46,330
I mean, look at your father.

986
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:50,207
He hasn't been to church
in 40 years.

987
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:52,212
40 years.

988
01:00:52,314 --> 01:00:54,043
And he won't talk
to his daughter

989
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:55,548
because she married someone

990
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,379
who hadn't been
to his church in 20.

991
01:00:58,653 --> 01:01:00,712
How do we undo that?

992
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:05,289
What about us?

993
01:01:05,394 --> 01:01:07,055
Start over.

994
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:11,989
Remember what it was that got you
started in the first place?

995
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,069
Build on that.

996
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,070
- Redis cover where--
- Sshhh.

997
01:01:40,529 --> 01:01:43,430
Announcer: It's semi-final time.
Kilnockie nearly promoted

998
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:45,261
but still in
the Second Division

999
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:48,097
against Kilmarnock
from the Premier League.

1000
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:51,468
And no chance of Kilnockie
relinquishing home advantage,

1001
01:01:51,573 --> 01:01:54,201
because we're on neutral ground
at Premier Park,

1002
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:56,869
where not only are they facing
a Premiership side, Rob,

1003
01:01:56,978 --> 01:01:59,378
they've got to beat them
without Jackie McQuillan.

1004
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:02,279
After his recent sending off
against Queen of the South,

1005
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:03,612
he's sitting in the stands.

1006
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:04,878
- Hey, man.
- Hi, chairman.

1007
01:02:04,986 --> 01:02:07,546
Jackie, Mr. O'Shea
and Mr. Clancy.

1008
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:10,819
Jackie McQuillan.
Great player this guy.

1009
01:02:10,926 --> 01:02:13,486
Could get used to this gaffer.
Let's make it a habit.

1010
01:02:13,595 --> 01:02:15,222
Aye, aye.

1011
01:02:17,332 --> 01:02:20,062
And that's the experienced
Hugh Dallas as the referee.

1012
01:02:20,168 --> 01:02:21,897
Watch this.
Here we go.

1013
01:02:22,003 --> 01:02:24,403
- Oh, right.
- ( whistle sounds )

1014
01:02:26,508 --> 01:02:28,533
And the semi-final
gets under way.

1015
01:02:28,643 --> 01:02:31,305
The striking on us
for Kilnockie falls

1016
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:34,712
on Andy Smith
and Owen Coyle.

1017
01:02:34,816 --> 01:02:36,784
The side, of course,
minus McQuillan.

1018
01:02:36,885 --> 01:02:39,911
The supply, it's hoped,
will come from Alan Lawrence.

1019
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:42,080
And immediately
it's Lawrence in possession.

1020
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:45,023
A curling cross into the area
but too close to the keeper

1021
01:02:45,127 --> 01:02:46,924
and plucked out of the air
by Meldrum.

1022
01:02:47,028 --> 01:02:49,394
Well, I've been very impressed
with this start, Rob.

1023
01:02:49,498 --> 01:02:52,228
I thought they might defend
in the early stages of this game,

1024
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:55,497
but they've actually looked to try
to score an early goal, Kilnockie.

1025
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:57,003
Very ambitious.

1026
01:02:57,105 --> 01:03:00,199
There'll be pressure from Kilmarnock,
of course, the favorites.

1027
01:03:00,308 --> 01:03:02,037
And it's them on the attack

1028
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:04,874
with that shot directly
at Brian Burns.

1029
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,710
A comfortable save but that
will give him some confidence.

1030
01:03:07,816 --> 01:03:09,215
He's certainly a key man.

1031
01:03:09,317 --> 01:03:11,342
Well, if you don't have
your top goal scorer,

1032
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:13,216
and you don't have
your best player,

1033
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:15,721
you might have to rely
on your goalkeeper today.

1034
01:03:15,824 --> 01:03:17,451
That's a confidence
boosting save.

1035
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:20,392
Here come Kilnockie again.
Again it's Lawrence.

1036
01:03:20,495 --> 01:03:22,395
He's made a good start.
He cuts in.

1037
01:03:22,497 --> 01:03:24,624
This is a real chance
for Kilnockie.

1038
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:28,558
A brave save by Meldrum
at his feet.

1039
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:30,570
But he overran it, surely.

1040
01:03:30,672 --> 01:03:33,004
Yes, he definitely did.
It was a brave save.

1041
01:03:33,108 --> 01:03:34,735
But he's a postman,
young Lawrence,

1042
01:03:34,843 --> 01:03:37,403
and he should have delivered
a better finish than he did.

1043
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:39,912
That was an absolutely
glorious opportunity.

1044
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:45,084
Here comes
another opportunity.

1045
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:46,916
It's Owen Coyle.

1046
01:03:47,022 --> 01:03:48,751
Cuts in from
the right hand side

1047
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:50,381
onto his favorite
left peg.

1048
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,790
The cross aimed
at Andy Smith.

1049
01:03:52,894 --> 01:03:54,691
Smith's header...
and it's a goal !

1050
01:03:54,796 --> 01:03:57,356
A crushing header
from Smith.

1051
01:03:57,465 --> 01:04:00,525
And Kilnockie leads Kilmarnock
by a goal to nil.

1052
01:04:00,635 --> 01:04:03,536
Well, it can't get much better
than this for this side.

1053
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:05,367
Second Division
against Premier.

1054
01:04:05,473 --> 01:04:08,374
They've really held their own
in the opening half hour.

1055
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:10,034
And what a sucker punch.

1056
01:04:10,145 --> 01:04:11,703
Beautifully flighted ball,

1057
01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:14,873
and I have to say
a towering, accurate,

1058
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:18,384
almost unstoppable header
from big Andy Smith.

1059
01:04:19,654 --> 01:04:22,714
We got the goal we weren't sure
we could get, lads, hey?

1060
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:24,724
Now we have
to make it stand up.

1061
01:04:24,826 --> 01:04:27,386
Don't get caught
ball watching.

1062
01:04:27,495 --> 01:04:29,053
See the ball through
your man.

1063
01:04:29,164 --> 01:04:30,722
That's the way
you shut them down.

1064
01:04:30,832 --> 01:04:32,231
You cut off their movement.

1065
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:35,565
And remember, you only get
one chance at a Premier team.

1066
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,138
This is our shot at glory,
lads, all right?

1067
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,401
All right,
go and give it to them !

1068
01:04:40,508 --> 01:04:42,032
( together )
Come on, let's go!

1069
01:04:46,181 --> 01:04:49,173
Announcer: Kilmarnock giving it
everything in this second half

1070
01:04:49,284 --> 01:04:52,344
as they try to battle
their way back into the Cup tie.

1071
01:04:52,454 --> 01:04:54,319
They badly want to be
in the final.

1072
01:04:54,422 --> 01:04:55,787
But they are one down, Andy.

1073
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,222
Yes, but they've been camped
in Kilnockie's half

1074
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,521
for the opening half hour
of this second half.

1075
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:02,426
And their goalkeeper,
Brian Burns,

1076
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:05,021
has been absolutely
sensational.

1077
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:07,124
They're looking
a little tired as we get

1078
01:05:07,235 --> 01:05:08,793
to the last quarter
of an hour.

1079
01:05:08,903 --> 01:05:10,598
I am a touch concerned
for them.

1080
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,340
Burns has been a hero so far.

1081
01:05:17,445 --> 01:05:20,437
- Who's got 11 ?
- He's been brave and decisive

1082
01:05:20,548 --> 01:05:23,278
- and he has to continue to be so.
- Who's got 11 ?

1083
01:05:23,385 --> 01:05:25,910
- 11 !
- Curled in toward the near post.

1084
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:28,922
- 11 !
- Burns has to come for it,

1085
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:31,720
and he makes a good solid
confident punch.

1086
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:33,885
Oh, but he's fallen
awkwardly.

1087
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:38,394
And he's not getting up.
Burns is in trouble.

1088
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,900
This could be
a bad injury blow.

1089
01:05:41,002 --> 01:05:44,733
Almost symbolically, the rain's
come down on Premier Park.

1090
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:48,400
Black clouds overhead
for the Kilnockie supporters.

1091
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,501
Kelsey, get warmed up.
Come on, quickly.

1092
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:52,671
Hurry up.
Hey, Kelsey, get warmed up!

1093
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,681
Come on, get warmed up.
Hurry up.

1094
01:05:57,786 --> 01:06:00,346
Announcer: He landed
really awkwardly, Rob.

1095
01:06:00,455 --> 01:06:03,515
As he got into the net,
I think his arm tangled there.

1096
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:06,685
It went underneath him.
All his weight landed on his shoulder.

1097
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:08,786
I think he's got
serious problems.

1098
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:10,922
I think we're about to see
a substitution made.

1099
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:20,871
Come on, Kelsey,
pay attention.

1100
01:06:20,975 --> 01:06:22,875
- Get your mind on it.
- Kelsey O'Brian

1101
01:06:22,977 --> 01:06:25,878
is the reserve keeper
on the bench. He's 23.

1102
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:28,710
And he's played soccer
at Dartmouth College

1103
01:06:28,817 --> 01:06:33,049
in the U .S., but he's never
experienced anything like this.

1104
01:06:33,154 --> 01:06:35,213
Well, what a test
for the young man.

1105
01:06:35,323 --> 01:06:37,052
Goodness knows
how he's feeling.

1106
01:06:37,158 --> 01:06:38,785
He knows he's coming on.

1107
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:40,622
God, what nerves.

1108
01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:42,287
What nerves he must have.

1109
01:06:42,397 --> 01:06:45,389
Here's your chance, son.

1110
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,400
No more small print.

1111
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:50,596
Just big fucking headlines
up for grabs.

1112
01:06:56,444 --> 01:06:58,844
So, go and grab 'em.

1113
01:07:00,949 --> 01:07:02,678
I was just thinking, Rob,

1114
01:07:02,784 --> 01:07:06,015
we're about to witness probably
the biggest 10 minutes

1115
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:08,487
in the history
of Kilnockie Football Club.

1116
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,182
And what do they have to do?

1117
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,260
Put a rookie American
with no experience

1118
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:15,261
and no one's ever heard of,
into the goal.

1119
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:17,524
The crowd knows he's American.
Listen to them.

1120
01:07:17,632 --> 01:07:19,031
Is that,
''Yank, Yank, Yank,''

1121
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:22,103
or is it something even
more offensive, I wonder?

1122
01:07:22,203 --> 01:07:23,500
( crowd chanting ''Yank'' )

1123
01:07:26,808 --> 01:07:28,366
But he's got lucky,
I tell ya,

1124
01:07:28,476 --> 01:07:29,807
I thought
that was a corner.

1125
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:31,742
I thought Burns punched it
straight out.

1126
01:07:31,846 --> 01:07:34,713
The referee has given a goal kick
in all the confusion.

1127
01:07:34,816 --> 01:07:36,716
Gives the goalkeeper
a chance to settle.

1128
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:38,911
Good clearance up field.
Get settled.

1129
01:07:44,859 --> 01:07:47,726
Dear, oh dear.
Well, that's ominous.

1130
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:50,992
His first touch of the ball,
a real sclaff.

1131
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:53,329
He took a chunk of turf.

1132
01:07:53,435 --> 01:07:55,494
And let's hope
his shot stopping

1133
01:07:55,603 --> 01:07:57,332
is better than
his goal kicking.

1134
01:07:58,773 --> 01:08:00,604
Here comes
the Kilmarnock pressure.

1135
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:07,847
Dealt with quite
comfortably there.

1136
01:08:07,949 --> 01:08:10,850
- Hetherston thumped it clear.
- Fuck, four minutes.

1137
01:08:10,952 --> 01:08:13,512
- Where's he get that from?
- The signal from the touch-line

1138
01:08:13,621 --> 01:08:15,179
is that four minutes
will be added.

1139
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,850
Oh, Christ.
How much time?

1140
01:08:17,959 --> 01:08:19,688
I don't know.
I can't look.

1141
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:21,853
Agony written
all over the faces

1142
01:08:21,963 --> 01:08:24,693
of the Kilnockie supporters.
Can they hold on?

1143
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,562
How much time
are you giving them?

1144
01:08:26,668 --> 01:08:28,533
Why don't you stick on
a green jersey

1145
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:31,196
- and make it legal, eh?!
- Calm down, okay?

1146
01:08:31,306 --> 01:08:32,705
You either behave
yourself...

1147
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:35,207
Who said there's no pressure
in this game?

1148
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:38,541
Hugh Dallas telling him
in no uncertain terms,

1149
01:08:38,646 --> 01:08:40,273
''Sit down, son.''

1150
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:42,349
You can blow the whistle
any old time,

1151
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:44,384
says Gordon McCleod.

1152
01:08:44,486 --> 01:08:47,546
That one last chance possibly

1153
01:08:47,655 --> 01:08:49,282
for Kilmarnock.

1154
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:51,483
Kilmarnock pressing.
That's a good effort.

1155
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:54,323
And touched over the top
by Kelsey O'Brian.

1156
01:08:54,429 --> 01:08:56,158
That's a corner kick.

1157
01:08:57,432 --> 01:09:00,162
They're almost there, Rob.
10 seconds to go.

1158
01:09:01,436 --> 01:09:05,372
This could be the last chance
for Kilmarnock.

1159
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:10,177
And that's a good punch
by O'Brian.

1160
01:09:10,278 --> 01:09:12,007
It's out
of the danger area.

1161
01:09:12,113 --> 01:09:14,445
As the full time
whistle goes.

1162
01:09:14,549 --> 01:09:16,244
It's unbelievable !

1163
01:09:16,351 --> 01:09:19,445
Kilnockie are through
to the final

1164
01:09:19,554 --> 01:09:22,079
of the Scottish Cup
and they'll play,

1165
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:24,351
believe it or not,
Rangers.

1166
01:09:24,459 --> 01:09:27,189
Well, I can't believe
what I've witnessed this afternoon.

1167
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:29,160
A Second Division side

1168
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:32,563
arrived here against
a Premier League side.

1169
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:35,192
They arrive here
without the top man.

1170
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:37,203
Without their main striker.

1171
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:40,706
Their goalkeeper gets carried
off 10 minutes from the end.

1172
01:09:40,808 --> 01:09:42,867
They stick in
a rookie American

1173
01:09:42,977 --> 01:09:45,070
no-one's ever hear of.
Hold out.

1174
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:47,079
It's unbelievable.

1175
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:50,384
And victorious scenes
there'll be

1176
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:52,544
in Kilnockie tonight

1177
01:09:52,654 --> 01:09:55,555
as the reality
of what they've achieved today

1178
01:09:55,657 --> 01:09:57,887
begins to sink in.

1179
01:09:57,992 --> 01:10:00,222
And it will take some
sinking in

1180
01:10:00,328 --> 01:10:02,558
for Kelsey O'Brian.

1181
01:10:02,664 --> 01:10:05,098
He's joined the little team
with the big heart

1182
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,099
and he's come up
with the goods.

1183
01:10:12,807 --> 01:10:14,900
Kelsey.
Here's to your future.

1184
01:10:15,009 --> 01:10:16,738
Well done.

1185
01:10:16,844 --> 01:10:18,402
Well done.

1186
01:10:41,869 --> 01:10:44,269
Gordon: So, Kelsey,
you feeling all right?

1187
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:47,000
Kelsey: I feel a bit,
you know, sick.

1188
01:10:47,108 --> 01:10:49,599
You know...

1189
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:51,201
before the semi-final,

1190
01:10:51,312 --> 01:10:54,372
the most people I ever played
in front of was maybe 2,200.

1191
01:10:54,482 --> 01:10:56,712
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

1192
01:11:00,321 --> 01:11:04,155
- You ever fish?
- Yeah, with my grandpa as a kid.

1193
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:09,561
Well, when you're standing
in that river, son,

1194
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:12,224
there's only one thing
you're concentrating on.

1195
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:15,894
That wee fly floating
with the current 30, 40 feet away.

1196
01:11:16,004 --> 01:11:18,234
So you mend your line
once or twice,

1197
01:11:18,339 --> 01:11:21,274
but you never take your eye
off the wee fly.

1198
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:23,708
It's the same thing
with goalkeeping.

1199
01:11:23,811 --> 01:11:25,574
You get the angle you want,

1200
01:11:26,848 --> 01:11:30,113
make sure of your footing,
keep your line,

1201
01:11:30,218 --> 01:11:32,243
then you concentrate
on nothing

1202
01:11:32,353 --> 01:11:34,446
but that wee bouncing ball
out there.

1203
01:11:34,555 --> 01:11:36,250
Everything else goes.

1204
01:11:36,357 --> 01:11:38,086
The fans, the noise,
the colors,

1205
01:11:38,192 --> 01:11:40,092
all the jumping around.

1206
01:11:40,194 --> 01:11:43,254
Now, that's what I want you
to do against the Rangers, eh?

1207
01:11:44,532 --> 01:11:46,124
Go fishing.

1208
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:29,775
( singing Scottish music )

1209
01:12:49,363 --> 01:12:51,331
( applauding )

1210
01:12:57,438 --> 01:13:01,704
# Oh, the summertime
has come #

1211
01:13:01,809 --> 01:13:06,542
# And the trees
are sweetly blooming #

1212
01:13:06,647 --> 01:13:11,107
# And the wild
mountain thyme #

1213
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:15,713
# Grows around
the purple heather #

1214
01:13:15,823 --> 01:13:17,723
# Will you go, lassie, go?

1215
01:13:17,825 --> 01:13:20,225
- Are you dancing?
- Are you asking?

1216
01:13:20,328 --> 01:13:21,556
Aye.

1217
01:13:21,662 --> 01:13:26,122
# And we'll all go together #

1218
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:30,898
# To pull wild mountain thyme #

1219
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:34,202
# All around
the blooming heather #

1220
01:13:34,308 --> 01:13:37,300
# Will you go, #

1221
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:40,346
# Lassie, go? #

1222
01:13:45,186 --> 01:13:47,916
- ( music ends )
- Well played, lads.

1223
01:13:57,431 --> 01:13:59,365
Ladies and gentlemen,

1224
01:13:59,467 --> 01:14:01,492
Gordon McCleod.

1225
01:14:01,602 --> 01:14:03,934
( applause )

1226
01:14:24,492 --> 01:14:26,517
It's a great night--

1227
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:28,527
for this team
and this town.

1228
01:14:30,765 --> 01:14:33,461
But I cannot help wondering
where home is

1229
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:35,468
if we win the Cup.

1230
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:39,371
Maybe the owner of the team
could clear this up for us tonight.

1231
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:43,869
Four months ago you told me
we had to do better.

1232
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:47,514
We're a First Division
team now.

1233
01:14:47,615 --> 01:14:49,344
Is that good enough?

1234
01:14:50,685 --> 01:14:53,313
Good enough to call
Kilnockie home?

1235
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:56,546
Well, I'll tell you what,
Gordon,

1236
01:14:56,657 --> 01:14:58,648
I'll make you
the same promise

1237
01:14:58,759 --> 01:15:00,727
I made you
four months ago.

1238
01:15:01,963 --> 01:15:03,931
I promise you the team
stays here...

1239
01:15:04,031 --> 01:15:07,296
( applause )

1240
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:12,630
if, and this is
what I told him,

1241
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:16,736
you beat Rangers.

1242
01:15:16,844 --> 01:15:18,573
Oh.

1243
01:15:21,749 --> 01:15:25,048
Eh, now we know
what we're playing for.

1244
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:33,023
Many of you also know

1245
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:35,459
that home means
a lot to me.

1246
01:15:36,631 --> 01:15:39,293
I was born in a wee mining town
southwest of Glasgow.

1247
01:15:41,168 --> 01:15:43,500
And miners never forget
where they're from.

1248
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:45,401
And fishermen remember,
too,

1249
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:48,771
which is why I've always felt
at home in this town,

1250
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:51,276
amongst all of you.

1251
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,406
When it's life and death,
you learn quickly who you can trust,

1252
01:15:55,516 --> 01:15:58,314
be it in a mineshaft
or on a fishing boat.

1253
01:15:59,754 --> 01:16:01,654
I approach football
the same way.

1254
01:16:01,756 --> 01:16:04,725
I don't care if you're a good
player or a bad player.

1255
01:16:07,228 --> 01:16:09,890
If you're a good person
I'll work with you.

1256
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:14,499
But I'd prefer you were a good player
as well as a good person.

1257
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:17,036
( laughter )

1258
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:19,936
Now...

1259
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:23,442
there's a lot of good people
on this team

1260
01:16:23,544 --> 01:16:27,173
and a lot of good people who've been
rooting for them for a lot of years.

1261
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:30,375
None of our success
could've happened

1262
01:16:30,484 --> 01:16:33,180
without your support.

1263
01:16:33,287 --> 01:16:36,688
Just like none of my success
would have been possible

1264
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,884
without the support of my wife,
Irene.

1265
01:16:38,993 --> 01:16:41,325
- Aye.
- Aye, good on ya.

1266
01:16:41,429 --> 01:16:43,556
( applause )

1267
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,599
There's a lot
of young players

1268
01:16:52,707 --> 01:16:55,733
who think they can be involved
in semis and finals every year.

1269
01:16:57,511 --> 01:16:59,604
But I never played
in a Cup Final

1270
01:16:59,714 --> 01:17:03,115
and I know a lot
of very good players who didn't.

1271
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:07,482
So cherish this opportunity.

1272
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:11,290
Now I won't make
any daft promises,

1273
01:17:11,392 --> 01:17:13,485
but we'll go and give
our all on Saturday

1274
01:17:13,594 --> 01:17:15,824
and we'll enjoy it.

1275
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:17,955
But remember...

1276
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,269
enjoyment to me
is winning.

1277
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:24,395
All right?
All right?

1278
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:26,405
Eh? Eh?

1279
01:17:38,686 --> 01:17:40,415
There's one last
official duty

1280
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,512
to perform tonight.

1281
01:17:42,623 --> 01:17:45,990
Not five hours after
our Kilmarnock win

1282
01:17:46,093 --> 01:17:48,926
two of this team's
greatest supporters

1283
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:51,658
rolled up their sleeves
and went to work.

1284
01:17:51,766 --> 01:17:53,461
( applause )

1285
01:17:53,567 --> 01:17:55,398
The result of their efforts

1286
01:17:55,503 --> 01:17:57,368
should make us all
feel proud.

1287
01:17:58,406 --> 01:18:00,636
( whistles )

1288
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,244
If the coaches and the team

1289
01:18:05,346 --> 01:18:07,473
would please make their way up
to the stage.

1290
01:18:14,221 --> 01:18:16,746
- Go on. Jackie, go on.
- No way.

1291
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:19,655
There is no way I am putting
one of those jackets on.

1292
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:51,018
Hi, Jackie, glad to see
you could join us today.

1293
01:18:52,326 --> 01:18:54,419
So this is how
you boys travel?

1294
01:18:54,528 --> 01:18:56,325
( chatter )

1295
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:58,955
You run out of gas, eh?

1296
01:18:59,066 --> 01:19:01,227
Aye, in a manner of speaking,
gaffer, aye.

1297
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:03,235
Andy, you made
the squad, son.

1298
01:19:03,337 --> 01:19:05,828
- That's a boost to Rangers.
- As long as we're all here,

1299
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,238
I wanna tell you to keep
your underpants on tonight.

1300
01:19:08,342 --> 01:19:10,207
No sex before the match.

1301
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:12,677
I don't want you excited

1302
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:15,647
except on the pitch tomorrow.

1303
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:22,254
( horns honking )

1304
01:19:26,794 --> 01:19:29,786
David versus Goliath only
scratches the sur--

1305
01:19:29,897 --> 01:19:31,524
Shut up.

1306
01:19:31,632 --> 01:19:33,759
We're joined now,
in the Rangers trophy room,

1307
01:19:33,868 --> 01:19:35,563
by Rangers manager,
Martin Smith.

1308
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:38,263
Martin, here you are again
in a familiar position--

1309
01:19:38,372 --> 01:19:40,863
the night before another Cup Final
involving the Rangers.

1310
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:43,808
If you beat Kilnockie tomorrow,
you'll make it a clean sweep.

1311
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:46,004
The Treble.
No one's done it in 30 years.

1312
01:19:46,113 --> 01:19:49,378
It'd be a lot better if we could keep
Jackie McQuillan out.

1313
01:19:49,483 --> 01:19:51,781
- You bastard.
- Is there anything you'd like to say

1314
01:19:51,886 --> 01:19:53,877
to Gordon tonight?
We did invite him on

1315
01:19:53,988 --> 01:19:56,388
- but he declined.
- Well, you know...

1316
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:59,891
Gordon's awfully shy.
Hides his light under a bushel.

1317
01:19:59,994 --> 01:20:02,428
Come on back, Gordon.
All is forgiven.

1318
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:13,265
This is nothing to do
between me and Gordon

1319
01:20:13,374 --> 01:20:17,208
or Jackie and the Rangers.
It's between the two teams.

1320
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:19,176
Jackie's certainly been
a Rangers killer.

1321
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,043
Have you any plan for him?
( knocking )

1322
01:20:21,148 --> 01:20:23,116
Well, I understand some
of the supporters

1323
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:25,117
are gonna go over
to his hotel tonight.

1324
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:27,187
If we can't keep him awake,
we'll have--

1325
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:29,984
- Gaffer, hey.
- Hey.

1326
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:31,955
- You doing all right?
- Aye, good. You?

1327
01:20:32,059 --> 01:20:35,256
- Yeah, okay.
- Good.

1328
01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:36,989
Er...

1329
01:20:38,098 --> 01:20:41,397
I-- I don't wanna lose this game
before it starts.

1330
01:20:41,502 --> 01:20:43,299
Stay in your room.
Don't go out.

1331
01:20:43,404 --> 01:20:45,304
Don't drink.

1332
01:20:45,406 --> 01:20:47,306
Don't do what you did
on too many nights.

1333
01:20:47,408 --> 01:20:48,966
- All right?
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

1334
01:20:49,076 --> 01:20:50,600
Yup.

1335
01:20:52,546 --> 01:20:54,844
That must give you
the boke, that.

1336
01:20:54,949 --> 01:20:57,679
Seeing that prick sitting there
like that.

1337
01:20:57,785 --> 01:21:00,583
It's water under the bridge.

1338
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:02,588
Aye, but it could have
been you, gaffer.

1339
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:05,158
If that bastard had left
his resignation

1340
01:21:05,259 --> 01:21:06,590
in that room in Dundee

1341
01:21:06,694 --> 01:21:08,992
instead of leaving with a raise.

1342
01:21:09,096 --> 01:21:11,462
Aye, that gave me the boke.

1343
01:21:11,565 --> 01:21:13,965
- So he'll be a marked man?
- Closely marked man.

1344
01:21:14,068 --> 01:21:16,400
But it's not just him.

1345
01:21:16,503 --> 01:21:18,300
It's not even
keeping the team in Kilnockie,

1346
01:21:18,405 --> 01:21:20,999
though I want it
with all my heart.

1347
01:21:21,108 --> 01:21:23,235
( laughs )
Come here.

1348
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:30,976
I was a run-of-the-mill
squad player

1349
01:21:31,085 --> 01:21:33,815
wherever I played.

1350
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:37,357
Even the Teddy Bears weren't
any good when I made it to Ibrox.

1351
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,392
So I never won anything,

1352
01:21:39,493 --> 01:21:41,358
let alone a championship.

1353
01:21:41,462 --> 01:21:44,056
So tomorrow,
for once in my life,

1354
01:21:44,164 --> 01:21:46,155
I want to win something.
( laughs )

1355
01:21:48,902 --> 01:21:50,631
I want to win the Cup.

1356
01:21:50,738 --> 01:21:52,330
Okay?

1357
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:55,169
Stay here.

1358
01:21:55,276 --> 01:21:57,176
Stay here, eh?

1359
01:21:57,278 --> 01:21:59,303
- Cheers.
- Okay.

1360
01:22:03,117 --> 01:22:06,280
Oh, what you did
for that Protestant boy

1361
01:22:06,387 --> 01:22:09,254
- was a good thing.
- Protestant boy?

1362
01:22:09,356 --> 01:22:11,916
It had nothing to do
with any church for me, gaffer.

1363
01:22:12,026 --> 01:22:14,551
You know, maybe someday
you'll understand.

1364
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:17,222
And think the same way
about Kate.

1365
01:22:18,699 --> 01:22:21,327
Hasn't been about that
for a long time.

1366
01:22:22,836 --> 01:22:25,202
Maybe it never was.

1367
01:22:25,306 --> 01:22:26,534
Maybe.

1368
01:22:28,175 --> 01:22:30,040
Eh?

1369
01:22:31,145 --> 01:22:32,737
( screaming )

1370
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:34,905
It's a nice crowd
you've got here.

1371
01:22:38,218 --> 01:22:40,118
Hi there.
Um, can you give me

1372
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,155
- Jackie McQuillan's room number?
- I'm sorry, ma'am,

1373
01:22:43,257 --> 01:22:46,090
- but I don't know who you--
- I'm Mrs. McQuillan.

1374
01:22:47,194 --> 01:22:50,061
Oh. Of course.

1375
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:54,561
We're just trying to protect
our players' privacy--

1376
01:22:54,668 --> 01:22:56,693
I can see you're doing
a really nice job

1377
01:22:56,804 --> 01:22:58,704
with the traffic control.

1378
01:22:58,806 --> 01:23:00,706
( knocking )

1379
01:23:06,013 --> 01:23:09,779
Hiya, Jackie.
Remember me?

1380
01:23:09,883 --> 01:23:12,317
- Annie.
- Annie.

1381
01:23:12,419 --> 01:23:14,353
Who could forget?

1382
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:17,048
Just like old times, eh?

1383
01:23:17,157 --> 01:23:19,921
Being in the Cup Final.

1384
01:23:20,027 --> 01:23:23,224
- Scoring.
- Look, I mean, I'm suppos--

1385
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:26,493
- I can't go out, you know.
- Who said anything about going out?

1386
01:23:30,471 --> 01:23:32,701
Aren't you wearing
the wrong colors, darling?

1387
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:35,832
Yeah, well, I never really
thought blue

1388
01:23:35,943 --> 01:23:38,104
was ever a match
for my personality.

1389
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:40,772
That's her.
I'm telling ya, that's her.

1390
01:23:40,881 --> 01:23:42,781
That's McQuillan's wife.

1391
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:02,832
( knocking )

1392
01:24:02,936 --> 01:24:05,166
( water running )

1393
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,740
The nutters are on the loose.

1394
01:24:08,842 --> 01:24:10,742
And that's just my team-mates.

1395
01:24:12,146 --> 01:24:14,637
Mum told me that...

1396
01:24:14,748 --> 01:24:16,773
somebody took
the team bus today.

1397
01:24:16,884 --> 01:24:19,614
Well, I'm proud of you.

1398
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,621
So, how do you feel?

1399
01:24:22,723 --> 01:24:25,089
Like I might never
feel this way again.

1400
01:24:27,361 --> 01:24:30,819
I don't know what the hell
I'm gonna do when it's all over.

1401
01:24:37,604 --> 01:24:39,799
I am gonna take care of you

1402
01:24:39,907 --> 01:24:41,636
for the rest of your life.

1403
01:24:41,742 --> 01:24:44,336
You just worry about tomorrow.

1404
01:24:44,445 --> 01:24:47,312
Flooding the bathroom however,

1405
01:24:47,414 --> 01:24:49,541
is not really the best way
to start.

1406
01:24:53,554 --> 01:24:56,182
( draining )

1407
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:58,349
I should have known.

1408
01:24:58,459 --> 01:25:01,292
You're never gonna get any peace
with this racket going on.

1409
01:25:01,395 --> 01:25:04,489
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

1410
01:25:04,598 --> 01:25:06,566
Just go out.

1411
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:08,532
I promised Gordon
I'd stay in.

1412
01:25:08,635 --> 01:25:11,001
I'm just talking about a drive
or a cup of coffee.

1413
01:25:11,104 --> 01:25:13,004
Could be the only peace
you'll get.

1414
01:25:13,106 --> 01:25:16,075
I promise I will have you back
before curfew.

1415
01:25:20,781 --> 01:25:23,614
- Ah, there you are.
- Hey! Come on, Jackie.

1416
01:25:25,352 --> 01:25:28,617
- Where are you going?
- Whoa ! Come here !

1417
01:25:28,722 --> 01:25:31,850
Hey!
Hey, Jackie

1418
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:34,257
have a drink on me.

1419
01:25:34,361 --> 01:25:36,261
- ( glass shatters )
- ( laughing )

1420
01:25:36,363 --> 01:25:40,026
- Are you fucking mental?
- As mental as a Celtic like you !

1421
01:25:40,133 --> 01:25:42,897
People get killed
because of assholes like you !

1422
01:25:43,003 --> 01:25:45,130
- It's a game !
- Jackie, just leave it.

1423
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:47,173
It's just a fucking game !

1424
01:25:47,274 --> 01:25:50,038
( screaming )

1425
01:25:56,316 --> 01:25:58,284
McQuillan at the gate.

1426
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:09,688
( siren blares )

1427
01:26:20,107 --> 01:26:22,268
( crowd screams,
bagpipes play )

1428
01:26:26,713 --> 01:26:29,614
Rob: Glasgow woke up this morning
to find Kilnockie striker,

1429
01:26:29,716 --> 01:26:32,082
Jackie McQuillan,
had been released from jail

1430
01:26:32,185 --> 01:26:35,120
following a brawl with Rangers
supporters at a Glasgow hotel.

1431
01:26:35,222 --> 01:26:38,419
Two men were taken
to hospital for treatment.

1432
01:26:38,525 --> 01:26:41,050
Jackie McQuillan was
apparently unhurt.

1433
01:26:45,299 --> 01:26:47,665
Police don't expect
to make a full report

1434
01:26:47,768 --> 01:26:50,703
until sometime
later today or tomorrow

1435
01:26:50,804 --> 01:26:54,205
when it's decided what,
if any charges, will be filed.

1436
01:26:54,308 --> 01:26:56,333
Rob's with me now.
Rob, what's the latest?

1437
01:26:56,443 --> 01:26:58,968
Rob: Andy, I spoke to Nockie
assistant coach, Ian Mc Veigh,

1438
01:26:59,079 --> 01:27:01,479
a few minutes ago.
Jackie is fit to play.

1439
01:27:01,582 --> 01:27:03,880
Whether he does or not
will depend on his manager

1440
01:27:03,984 --> 01:27:05,849
and his father-in-law,
Gordon McCleod.

1441
01:27:05,953 --> 01:27:08,387
And we know all about their
rocky relationship.

1442
01:27:08,488 --> 01:27:11,048
Dad.

1443
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:13,058
Dad.

1444
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,470
Dad !

1445
01:27:32,913 --> 01:27:35,006
Rob: Realistically,
what are their chances?

1446
01:27:35,115 --> 01:27:37,743
A Second Division team
taking on The Old Firm,

1447
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,012
a team that's never been
to a final

1448
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,714
against a team
that's been 35 times

1449
01:27:42,823 --> 01:27:44,723
and won 27.

1450
01:27:44,825 --> 01:27:48,454
A team with a total payroll
of some quarter of a million pounds

1451
01:27:48,562 --> 01:27:51,087
going up against a team
with seven players alone

1452
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:53,166
who make more than that.

1453
01:27:53,266 --> 01:27:55,928
A team of Scots
with a rookie American in goal

1454
01:27:56,036 --> 01:27:59,870
taking on a club with players
from nine different countries.

1455
01:27:59,973 --> 01:28:03,340
On paper Kilnockie
haven't a chance.

1456
01:28:05,612 --> 01:28:08,513
I've been reading a lot of
David and Goliath stories

1457
01:28:08,615 --> 01:28:10,640
in the papers this week.

1458
01:28:10,751 --> 01:28:13,219
If I was a reporter,
it'd be my angle too.

1459
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:16,289
It has a nice ring about it,
except the ring of truth.

1460
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:18,915
In that match up,
one side had a sword,

1461
01:28:19,026 --> 01:28:21,187
the other a stone.

1462
01:28:21,294 --> 01:28:23,353
In this version,

1463
01:28:23,463 --> 01:28:26,523
we both use
the same weapon.

1464
01:28:26,633 --> 01:28:30,433
This is what we play with,
lads.

1465
01:28:30,537 --> 01:28:33,028
And whoever wants it the more...

1466
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,903
will win.

1467
01:28:35,142 --> 01:28:37,906
We can beat this team.

1468
01:28:38,011 --> 01:28:40,309
I want you to be
street fighters.

1469
01:28:40,414 --> 01:28:42,507
Fight for every loose ball,

1470
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:44,550
every header.

1471
01:28:44,651 --> 01:28:46,710
When they've got the ball,
be where they are.

1472
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,050
And when we've got it

1473
01:28:49,156 --> 01:28:51,021
I want you to be
where they aren't.

1474
01:28:51,124 --> 01:28:53,024
Personal performance

1475
01:28:53,126 --> 01:28:55,253
and high individual standards
count here.

1476
01:28:56,363 --> 01:28:59,093
So, with that in mind...

1477
01:29:01,435 --> 01:29:04,131
everybody up.
I want a wee fucking bounce here.

1478
01:29:04,237 --> 01:29:05,932
Let's go on the spot.

1479
01:29:06,039 --> 01:29:08,200
Make sure we keep
with the ball early.

1480
01:29:08,308 --> 01:29:10,173
Jump early.
Make them tight.

1481
01:29:10,277 --> 01:29:12,108
And we're in.
And we're out.

1482
01:29:12,212 --> 01:29:14,510
Boylie, Lumber,
keep your eye on the ball.

1483
01:29:14,614 --> 01:29:16,172
Make sure we're setting up
tackles.

1484
01:29:16,283 --> 01:29:18,342
And we're in.
And we're out.

1485
01:29:18,452 --> 01:29:20,352
Don't let them play.
They get the ball,

1486
01:29:20,454 --> 01:29:22,581
we get them tackled.
Don't fucking allow them

1487
01:29:22,689 --> 01:29:25,157
to dictate the game.
You get in there and seize it.

1488
01:29:25,258 --> 01:29:27,089
And we're in.
And we're out.

1489
01:29:27,194 --> 01:29:29,685
Whoa, whoa,
whatever you do,

1490
01:29:29,796 --> 01:29:32,356
don't score early
and piss 'em off.

1491
01:29:32,466 --> 01:29:34,661
Out come the teams,

1492
01:29:34,768 --> 01:29:37,134
and what does it feel like
for these players?

1493
01:29:37,237 --> 01:29:39,501
Andy Gray can certainly
answer that question.

1494
01:29:39,606 --> 01:29:41,506
Andy, you've played
in seven.

1495
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:43,508
Andy: It's a brilliant time.
Between now

1496
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:45,703
and the end,
they're not gonna enjoy it.

1497
01:29:45,812 --> 01:29:47,712
None of those players.

1498
01:29:47,814 --> 01:29:50,476
But you get the chance.
You come out, stand and line up.

1499
01:29:50,584 --> 01:29:53,144
It gives you a chance to look
for your family and friends,

1500
01:29:53,253 --> 01:29:55,813
give 'em a little wave.
It's the only time you get

1501
01:29:55,922 --> 01:29:57,787
to relax before
this match starts.

1502
01:30:00,227 --> 01:30:03,025
Rob: And it's a huge day
for the man in the cloth cap.

1503
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:06,031
Gordon McCleod up against
Martin Smith,

1504
01:30:06,133 --> 01:30:07,896
the opposition manager.

1505
01:30:08,001 --> 01:30:10,026
They haven't spoken
for more than 20 years.

1506
01:30:10,137 --> 01:30:11,968
This is a real grudge match.

1507
01:30:12,072 --> 01:30:14,472
And Kilnockie playing
for their future in Scotland.

1508
01:30:14,574 --> 01:30:16,508
Rob: Playing for their very
future

1509
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:18,840
without their top striker.

1510
01:30:18,945 --> 01:30:20,845
Rob:
Gordon McCleod felt

1511
01:30:20,947 --> 01:30:22,812
it was a decision
that had to be taken.

1512
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:25,384
It was a matter of discipline.

1513
01:30:25,485 --> 01:30:28,420
A gamble that will pay off
or a gamble that won't.

1514
01:30:30,423 --> 01:30:32,482
McQuillan on the bench

1515
01:30:32,592 --> 01:30:34,560
as Kilnockie kick-off

1516
01:30:34,661 --> 01:30:36,652
in the Scottish Cup Final.

1517
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:41,059
And the challenge doesn't come

1518
01:30:41,168 --> 01:30:43,659
much bigger
than tackling Rangers.

1519
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:45,670
And immediately...

1520
01:30:45,772 --> 01:30:48,036
it's the big favorites
on the attack.

1521
01:30:48,141 --> 01:30:50,666
How come Dad's not playing?

1522
01:30:50,777 --> 01:30:52,938
I don't know, honey.

1523
01:30:53,046 --> 01:30:55,606
And there'll be a lot of defending
to do for Kilnockie.

1524
01:30:55,715 --> 01:30:58,275
Andy: Well, if I was Martin Smith
I'd be saying,

1525
01:30:58,385 --> 01:31:01,479
''Get shots on goal
as early and as many as you can.

1526
01:31:01,588 --> 01:31:03,317
Test this American goalkeeper.

1527
01:31:03,423 --> 01:31:05,323
See what he's really like.''

1528
01:31:05,425 --> 01:31:07,950
For Kilnockie it'll be:
defend as well as you can;

1529
01:31:08,061 --> 01:31:10,529
hopefully get a little
breakaway and a little luck.

1530
01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:13,861
Rob:
What an emotional day this is.

1531
01:31:13,967 --> 01:31:16,936
Kilnockie,
a big-hearted team,

1532
01:31:17,037 --> 01:31:18,937
there's not much doubt
about that,

1533
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:21,371
but they'll need more
than just big hearts today.

1534
01:31:21,474 --> 01:31:23,066
- Owen, go on.
- They'll need

1535
01:31:23,176 --> 01:31:25,906
to show the sort of ability
they've shown to get here

1536
01:31:26,012 --> 01:31:29,379
if they're going to take this
one step further.

1537
01:31:29,482 --> 01:31:31,677
And it's almost unbelievable.

1538
01:31:43,196 --> 01:31:45,096
Here come Rangers.

1539
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:48,258
Derek Ferguson is pulling
the strings in the midfield.

1540
01:31:48,368 --> 01:31:50,393
Robertson has the chance.

1541
01:31:50,503 --> 01:31:52,494
It's touched back,
and it's Ferguson's shot.

1542
01:31:52,606 --> 01:31:55,166
And it's fumbled
by Kelsey O'Brian.

1543
01:31:55,275 --> 01:31:57,436
He gathers it
at the second attempt.

1544
01:31:57,544 --> 01:32:00,411
That's the first real
threat to Kilnockie.

1545
01:32:00,513 --> 01:32:02,913
Rob: He did well in the end
but he got lucky.

1546
01:32:03,016 --> 01:32:05,314
- He's bound to be nervous.
- Andy: 25 minutes in.

1547
01:32:05,418 --> 01:32:07,409
He's not had a lot of the ball,
the goalkeeper,

1548
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,647
and I still think
he'll be a touch nervy.

1549
01:32:11,157 --> 01:32:14,058
Rob: That scoreboard
make sencouraging viewing

1550
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,924
for Gordon McCleod
and the Kilnockie supporters.

1551
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:20,193
Here's yet more pressure

1552
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:22,200
from Rangers.

1553
01:32:22,302 --> 01:32:23,997
In comes the cross...

1554
01:32:24,104 --> 01:32:26,368
out comes Kelsey O'Brian,
that's a poor punch.

1555
01:32:26,473 --> 01:32:29,101
And it's Ferguson !

1556
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:31,109
And that's one-nil.

1557
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:33,042
- Rangers have the lead...
- Jesus !

1558
01:32:33,146 --> 01:32:35,546
- Ah, fuck it!
- after O'Brian's mistake.

1559
01:32:35,649 --> 01:32:38,209
And this time he's
punished by Ferguson.

1560
01:32:38,318 --> 01:32:41,810
- One-nil.
- Andy: He'd done well up till then.

1561
01:32:41,922 --> 01:32:45,153
But you always wondered, could he
keep it going for 90 minutes?

1562
01:32:45,258 --> 01:32:48,489
The answer was,
unfortunately for Kilnockie, no.

1563
01:32:48,595 --> 01:32:50,790
A really poor punch
from the American.

1564
01:32:50,897 --> 01:32:54,458
Ferguson pounces.
It was a mountain to climb.

1565
01:32:54,567 --> 01:32:56,762
It's even bigger than that
now for Kilnockie.

1566
01:33:03,777 --> 01:33:05,938
One-fucking-nothing,
you think that's funny?

1567
01:33:06,046 --> 01:33:08,480
One-nothing against
a bunch of rubbish,

1568
01:33:08,581 --> 01:33:10,481
you're all smiles?

1569
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:13,017
Marking, horrible.
Finishing, deplorable.

1570
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:16,020
A bunch of fucking
potato-pickers

1571
01:33:16,122 --> 01:33:18,989
is holding the mighty
Glasgow Rangers to one goal

1572
01:33:19,092 --> 01:33:20,992
and you're happy?!

1573
01:33:21,094 --> 01:33:23,858
Your daughter's wanting to see you.
She's in the boardroom.

1574
01:33:23,964 --> 01:33:26,057
You better go.
She's in the boardroom.

1575
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:28,066
Okay, lads, settle down.

1576
01:33:28,168 --> 01:33:31,194
One mistake
can make it difficult.

1577
01:33:32,505 --> 01:33:34,405
You don't have
to make it difficult!

1578
01:33:44,284 --> 01:33:46,377
Shut the door, Dad.

1579
01:33:46,486 --> 01:33:48,386
You're good at that.

1580
01:33:55,228 --> 01:33:57,423
Jackie didn't get into a fight
last night

1581
01:33:57,530 --> 01:34:00,431
because he was drunk

1582
01:34:00,533 --> 01:34:02,091
or arrogant

1583
01:34:02,202 --> 01:34:03,794
or just being Jackie.

1584
01:34:03,903 --> 01:34:07,168
He got into a fight
because he was defending me

1585
01:34:07,273 --> 01:34:09,241
and you

1586
01:34:09,342 --> 01:34:11,207
and anyone else
who loves this game

1587
01:34:11,311 --> 01:34:15,077
and believes that it should
heal rifts not cement them.

1588
01:34:15,181 --> 01:34:17,513
Oh no,
you're gonna hear me.

1589
01:34:17,617 --> 01:34:20,586
See, I know that you love
to brood on your betrayals.

1590
01:34:20,687 --> 01:34:22,552
You tie them all up

1591
01:34:22,655 --> 01:34:24,520
into little bundles,
like...

1592
01:34:24,624 --> 01:34:26,057
firewood,

1593
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,753
and then warm
your Gaelic blood

1594
01:34:28,862 --> 01:34:31,660
when you think about them.

1595
01:34:31,765 --> 01:34:33,665
It's not Jackie's fault

1596
01:34:33,767 --> 01:34:36,600
that he was born with talent.

1597
01:34:38,505 --> 01:34:41,406
So stop blaming him
for your own failings.

1598
01:34:41,508 --> 01:34:45,137
It's you
and your jealousy

1599
01:34:45,245 --> 01:34:47,736
and your anger

1600
01:34:47,847 --> 01:34:50,680
that God had the nerve
to give someone else

1601
01:34:50,784 --> 01:34:53,480
so much more
than he gave you.

1602
01:34:54,654 --> 01:34:57,418
I don't suppose there's much
you can do about being stubborn.

1603
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,721
And there's definitely nothing
even you can do

1604
01:35:02,829 --> 01:35:05,593
about getting old.

1605
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:08,166
But for God's sake,
Dad,

1606
01:35:08,268 --> 01:35:10,793
you don't
have to be stupid.

1607
01:35:17,577 --> 01:35:19,772
I want this game, boys.

1608
01:35:19,879 --> 01:35:22,871
I want the Treble.

1609
01:35:25,885 --> 01:35:27,409
Do you hear me?

1610
01:35:28,788 --> 01:35:32,690
Right?!
Fucking do it!

1611
01:35:32,792 --> 01:35:34,885
Rob: We've just
been asking the question

1612
01:35:34,994 --> 01:35:36,621
during the half time interval

1613
01:35:36,729 --> 01:35:39,129
and it's answered
at the start of the second half.

1614
01:35:39,232 --> 01:35:41,359
McQuillan's on
for the second half.

1615
01:35:41,468 --> 01:35:43,561
- Yes !
- Jackie McQuillan is on.

1616
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:46,503
He's scored nine goals
in seven Cup Finals, Andy.

1617
01:35:46,606 --> 01:35:48,506
Rob: And four of them
against Rangers.

1618
01:35:48,608 --> 01:35:51,475
He had to come on, it's as
simple as that, Rob.

1619
01:35:51,578 --> 01:35:54,240
One down against
the team chasing Treble.

1620
01:35:54,347 --> 01:35:57,077
McQuillan on the bench?
Not for long.

1621
01:35:57,183 --> 01:35:59,879
He had to come on.

1622
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:04,012
And I have to say,
what a start he's made

1623
01:36:04,124 --> 01:36:06,058
to the second half.
He looks fit.

1624
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:07,888
He looks fresh.

1625
01:36:07,994 --> 01:36:10,588
Rob: I think he sent on an angry
young man, Gordon McCleod.

1626
01:36:10,697 --> 01:36:13,495
He's gonna prove to one or two
people that he isn't finished.

1627
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,501
I know he's playing. I can see
he's playing. I've got eyes.

1628
01:36:16,603 --> 01:36:19,834
He's the only player they've got.
I'm coming down.

1629
01:36:19,939 --> 01:36:24,342
The personal feud between McQuillan
and McCleod is no secret.

1630
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:27,709
But could this be
a managerial masterstroke?

1631
01:36:27,814 --> 01:36:31,215
Andy: He's flying.

1632
01:36:34,787 --> 01:36:37,381
Rob: Rangers in control
and dominating the game.

1633
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:40,118
Second half.
It's been all Kilnockie.

1634
01:36:40,226 --> 01:36:42,592
Rob: So much so,
at times you'd think

1635
01:36:42,695 --> 01:36:45,391
they're the Premiere side.
It's been an immense performance.

1636
01:36:48,067 --> 01:36:51,161
If it isn't St. Martin come down
to mingle with the less fortunate.

1637
01:36:51,271 --> 01:36:53,296
You've been missing
a good game.

1638
01:36:53,406 --> 01:36:55,670
The little guys are down.
But they're about to rise up

1639
01:36:55,775 --> 01:36:57,367
and bite the big boys
in the ass.

1640
01:36:57,477 --> 01:37:00,139
Gazzer,
pick up McQuillan.

1641
01:37:00,246 --> 01:37:02,214
I don't wanna see his name,
understand?

1642
01:37:02,315 --> 01:37:04,112
Put him in your pocket.

1643
01:37:04,217 --> 01:37:06,208
He's down on the touchline,
is Martin Smith.

1644
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:08,947
He could stay up in the
director's box no longer.

1645
01:37:10,023 --> 01:37:13,049
Gazzer, wake up!
It's no big secret he's in the game.

1646
01:37:13,159 --> 01:37:15,650
What a good save that was
from Ally Maxwell.

1647
01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:27,606
- ( grunts )
- That's a bad tackle on McQuillan.

1648
01:37:27,707 --> 01:37:29,902
They see him as the big threat

1649
01:37:30,009 --> 01:37:31,772
to their Cup Final chances.

1650
01:37:31,878 --> 01:37:33,937
Crowd:
Off, off, off!

1651
01:37:34,047 --> 01:37:36,311
( screaming )

1652
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:38,145
A yellow card.

1653
01:37:38,251 --> 01:37:40,014
That's bullshit.

1654
01:37:40,119 --> 01:37:41,882
He should have been booted !

1655
01:37:45,558 --> 01:37:47,458
Performance artist.

1656
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:49,585
Still taking the low road,
eh, Martin?

1657
01:37:49,696 --> 01:37:52,358
It's a goddamn mugging
and you know it.

1658
01:37:52,465 --> 01:37:54,763
Turning your back again.
You're good at that, eh?

1659
01:37:54,867 --> 01:37:56,596
Always was your best side.

1660
01:37:56,703 --> 01:37:58,796
That's enough. Sit down.
Down. Okay?

1661
01:37:58,905 --> 01:38:01,396
Andy: The message came on
from the touchline,

1662
01:38:01,507 --> 01:38:04,305
''Sort out McQuillan.''
There's absolutely no doubt.

1663
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:07,004
- And sort them out they have.
- ( whistle )

1664
01:38:07,113 --> 01:38:09,104
Andy: I know I might be
upsetting a few people,

1665
01:38:09,215 --> 01:38:11,206
but I'd love to see them get
an equalizer.

1666
01:38:11,317 --> 01:38:13,251
They're running out of time...

1667
01:38:13,353 --> 01:38:16,516
,

1668
01:38:16,623 --> 01:38:18,113
you're backing Kilnockie?
Never.

1669
01:38:21,894 --> 01:38:23,657
( cheering )

1670
01:38:23,763 --> 01:38:26,129
Hey, Kelsey!

1671
01:38:26,232 --> 01:38:28,166
Supporter: What?
Did they score? What?

1672
01:38:28,268 --> 01:38:30,463
Fucking what?
Tell me.

1673
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:32,094
Gonna shut up?

1674
01:38:35,375 --> 01:38:38,276
Rob: The agitation is
on the Rangers bench.

1675
01:38:38,378 --> 01:38:40,812
How much time
are we playing here?

1676
01:38:40,913 --> 01:38:42,881
John Rowbotham's had
a look at his watch.

1677
01:38:42,982 --> 01:38:44,882
And it's almost all over.

1678
01:38:44,984 --> 01:38:46,884
Rangers within seconds,

1679
01:38:46,986 --> 01:38:49,750
surely, of holding aloft
the Scottish Cup.

1680
01:38:51,958 --> 01:38:53,858
Jimmy Boyle might have
other ideas.

1681
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:56,793
His cross !
Up goes McQuillan !

1682
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:00,195
What a header!
And what a goal !

1683
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:04,259
- Oh, yes !
- Andy: I don't believe that.

1684
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:06,998
- Oh my God.
- Rob: That is incredible.

1685
01:39:07,106 --> 01:39:09,574
How do you script things
like this?

1686
01:39:09,676 --> 01:39:11,303
It would have to be him.

1687
01:39:11,411 --> 01:39:13,743
It would have to be
the last minute.

1688
01:39:19,319 --> 01:39:22,550
The color has drained
from the face of Martin Smith.

1689
01:39:22,655 --> 01:39:25,453
Jackie McQuillan
has come back

1690
01:39:25,558 --> 01:39:28,789
to Scottish football
to haunt him.

1691
01:39:28,895 --> 01:39:30,692
Kelsey O'Brian has run

1692
01:39:30,797 --> 01:39:33,425
the full length of the field
to join in the celebrations,

1693
01:39:33,533 --> 01:39:36,229
which will be echoing
around the northeast coastline,

1694
01:39:36,336 --> 01:39:38,600
no doubt about that.

1695
01:39:38,705 --> 01:39:41,037
All those who couldn't travel
to Hampden today...

1696
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:43,472
will be enjoying this moment.

1697
01:39:44,577 --> 01:39:47,307
- Oh, no.
- No.

1698
01:39:52,885 --> 01:39:54,819
Five million fucking quid

1699
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:57,014
for a blind man
with two left fucking feet

1700
01:39:57,123 --> 01:39:59,216
who doesn't
even speak English.

1701
01:40:06,933 --> 01:40:09,925
I wanna go first.
I wanna go first.

1702
01:40:10,036 --> 01:40:13,494
- Jackie, the nail in the coffin.
- Aye, gov.

1703
01:40:13,606 --> 01:40:16,404
- Alan, you start us off.
- Done.

1704
01:40:16,509 --> 01:40:18,409
Blackie,
I want you in on this.

1705
01:40:18,511 --> 01:40:19,944
No problem.

1706
01:40:20,046 --> 01:40:21,741
Silky, you go third.

1707
01:40:21,848 --> 01:40:24,078
Any other Bravehearts?

1708
01:40:25,051 --> 01:40:28,418
Rob: This is a cruel way
to settle a football match,

1709
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:30,386
especially a Cup Final.

1710
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:32,458
It's all about
winners and losers,

1711
01:40:32,558 --> 01:40:35,789
the joy,
the heartbreak.

1712
01:40:35,895 --> 01:40:39,092
And it's Eddie May
up first for Rangers, Andy.

1713
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,227
Andy: What a day it's been,
Rob.

1714
01:40:43,336 --> 01:40:45,133
One-one after 90 minutes.

1715
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:47,468
Extra time couldn't
give us a winner,

1716
01:40:47,573 --> 01:40:49,302
so now we're
down to penalties.

1717
01:40:49,409 --> 01:40:51,843
The one thing I'll tell you,
in the next few minutes,

1718
01:40:51,944 --> 01:40:54,572
we'll have a hero
and a villain.

1719
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:57,706
It's May versus O'Brian.

1720
01:41:00,486 --> 01:41:02,545
And Eddie May scores.

1721
01:41:02,655 --> 01:41:04,452
Strike one to Rangers.

1722
01:41:04,557 --> 01:41:06,855
That gets them off
to the best possible start.

1723
01:41:06,959 --> 01:41:09,120
Andy: Yeah, they obviously
won the toss, Rob,

1724
01:41:09,228 --> 01:41:11,287
because they went in first.
That's important.

1725
01:41:11,397 --> 01:41:13,797
Now Kilnockie are
playing catch-up.

1726
01:41:19,205 --> 01:41:22,663
Rob: Next up is Captain Courageous
for Kilnockie--

1727
01:41:22,775 --> 01:41:24,640
Alan Barnes, the skipper.

1728
01:41:24,744 --> 01:41:26,336
He wanted to take
the first one.

1729
01:41:26,446 --> 01:41:28,846
He wanted to take
the responsibility.

1730
01:41:28,948 --> 01:41:31,007
Barnes versus Maxwell.

1731
01:41:32,919 --> 01:41:36,411
And he sends him
the wrong way.

1732
01:41:36,522 --> 01:41:39,923
Kilnockie are one-one
in the penalty shoot out.

1733
01:41:44,464 --> 01:41:46,022
They'll feel
a bit better now,

1734
01:41:46,132 --> 01:41:47,997
with that one going in.

1735
01:41:49,302 --> 01:41:52,294
The pressure unloaded
for Barnes.

1736
01:41:52,405 --> 01:41:53,770
And the pressure now on,

1737
01:41:53,873 --> 01:41:55,738
for young Robertson.

1738
01:41:59,645 --> 01:42:01,670
He blasted it,
Robertson.

1739
01:42:01,781 --> 01:42:04,841
And scored.
Two-one in the shoot out.

1740
01:42:04,951 --> 01:42:06,782
That's your type
of penalty, isn't it?

1741
01:42:06,886 --> 01:42:09,081
Low on finesse,
high on velocity.

1742
01:42:09,188 --> 01:42:11,179
Andy: My type of penalty
finds the net.

1743
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:12,188
( laughs )

1744
01:42:14,994 --> 01:42:17,724
This man knows
all about penalties--

1745
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:19,229
Kenny Black.

1746
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:23,568
You don't get much better
than that.

1747
01:42:23,669 --> 01:42:26,638
Left foot ferocious.
Top corner.

1748
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:28,604
Andy: A little bit
of emotion as well.

1749
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:30,608
( laughing )
But all wrapped up.

1750
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:32,735
A little apology.

1751
01:42:37,917 --> 01:42:39,316
Now it's--

1752
01:42:39,418 --> 01:42:41,249
John Stone !

1753
01:42:41,354 --> 01:42:43,379
And that's three-two
to Rangers.

1754
01:42:43,489 --> 01:42:45,719
O'Brian went left,
the ball went the other way.

1755
01:42:45,825 --> 01:42:49,317
And Rangers again
have the edge.

1756
01:42:49,428 --> 01:42:52,022
Andy: Five pretty good penalties
I have to say.

1757
01:42:53,132 --> 01:42:56,568
That's cool.
A little wink to Ally Maxwell.

1758
01:42:56,669 --> 01:42:59,001
- He fancies this, doesn't he?
- They call him Silky.

1759
01:43:01,941 --> 01:43:04,205
He just passed
that into the net,

1760
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:05,709
picked his spot.

1761
01:43:05,811 --> 01:43:08,006
Again,
Maxwell chose wrong.

1762
01:43:08,114 --> 01:43:10,139
And it's three each.

1763
01:43:10,249 --> 01:43:12,649
Andy: At the moment neither
goalkeeper's getting

1764
01:43:12,752 --> 01:43:14,652
anywhere near a penalty.

1765
01:43:14,754 --> 01:43:17,154
Now Harris for Rangers.

1766
01:43:17,256 --> 01:43:19,747
It's gone through.

1767
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:22,453
O'Brian gave it his best shot
but he couldn't keep it out.

1768
01:43:24,363 --> 01:43:26,092
Rangers piling on
the pressure.

1769
01:43:27,967 --> 01:43:30,128
Sandy Stewart.

1770
01:43:32,471 --> 01:43:35,463
- ( grunts )
- A save by Maxwell !

1771
01:43:35,575 --> 01:43:37,770
The first save
of the shoot out

1772
01:43:37,877 --> 01:43:41,506
denies the former
Airdrie player.

1773
01:43:41,614 --> 01:43:43,309
He can't believe it.

1774
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:46,317
What's going on?
Is it bad?

1775
01:43:46,419 --> 01:43:49,877
We're dead,
unless Kelsey makes this save.

1776
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,858
Gordon: When you're standing
in that river, son,

1777
01:43:56,963 --> 01:43:59,397
there's only one thing
you're concentrating on,

1778
01:43:59,498 --> 01:44:02,467
the wee fly floating
with the current.

1779
01:44:02,568 --> 01:44:05,469
It's the same thing
between the sticks, Kelsey.

1780
01:44:05,571 --> 01:44:07,562
You get the angle you want,

1781
01:44:07,673 --> 01:44:10,164
you concentrate on nothing
but that wee ball out there.

1782
01:44:10,276 --> 01:44:12,039
Everything else goes,

1783
01:44:12,144 --> 01:44:15,443
the fans, the noise,
the colors.

1784
01:44:15,548 --> 01:44:18,108
That's what
I want you to do.

1785
01:44:18,217 --> 01:44:19,809
Go fishing.

1786
01:44:25,091 --> 01:44:27,457
- ( groans )
- What a fine save !

1787
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,528
The fairy tale continues !

1788
01:44:30,696 --> 01:44:32,391
Yes ! Yes !

1789
01:44:32,498 --> 01:44:34,261
Yes !

1790
01:44:34,367 --> 01:44:37,097
Yeah !

1791
01:44:38,204 --> 01:44:41,537
The emotional roller-coaster
rolls on.

1792
01:44:41,641 --> 01:44:44,769
And cometh the hour.
Cometh the man.

1793
01:44:44,877 --> 01:44:47,004
Who would Kilnockie want
at this stage...

1794
01:44:47,113 --> 01:44:49,513
to step up,
to strike the penalty

1795
01:44:49,615 --> 01:44:51,879
which can keep them
in the Cup Final?

1796
01:44:51,984 --> 01:44:54,009
You would have to answer it
with two words:

1797
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:56,054
Jackie McQuillan.

1798
01:44:56,155 --> 01:44:58,419
Andy: In normal circumstances, Rob,
I would agree,

1799
01:44:58,524 --> 01:45:00,924
but let me
tell you something,

1800
01:45:01,027 --> 01:45:03,086
these are not
normal circumstances.

1801
01:45:03,195 --> 01:45:07,461
This is pressure
the likes of even Jackie McQuillan

1802
01:45:07,566 --> 01:45:09,033
- hasn't faced before.
- ( crowd taunting )

1803
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:14,371
McQuillan, you fucking drunk,
you couldn't kick your own ass !

1804
01:45:14,473 --> 01:45:18,409
Can he keep Kilnockie
in the match?

1805
01:45:45,037 --> 01:45:48,871
Rob: Oh, what a save
by Ally Maxwell !

1806
01:45:48,974 --> 01:45:51,169
Rangers have won the Cup!

1807
01:45:51,277 --> 01:45:54,110
It's heartbreak for McQuillan.

1808
01:45:54,213 --> 01:45:56,238
It's heartbreak for Kilnockie.

1809
01:45:56,348 --> 01:45:59,875
The fairy tale is over.

1810
01:47:21,267 --> 01:47:24,100
If you're gonna be a McCleod,
son,

1811
01:47:24,203 --> 01:47:26,694
you're gonna have to learn
to stand on your own two feet.

1812
01:47:26,806 --> 01:47:28,501
Sorry, gaffer.

1813
01:47:28,607 --> 01:47:31,303
That's football, son.

1814
01:47:37,683 --> 01:47:41,744
McCleod and McQuillan walk off
side-by-side...

1815
01:47:41,854 --> 01:47:43,981
leaving the Hampden stage.

1816
01:47:44,089 --> 01:47:47,024
And could this be
the curtain-call for Kilnockie?

1817
01:47:47,126 --> 01:47:49,924
The road to glory
has ended here.

1818
01:47:50,029 --> 01:47:51,894
And if they move to Ireland,

1819
01:47:51,997 --> 01:47:55,023
they've left their supporters
with a performance to remember.

1820
01:47:55,134 --> 01:47:57,568
Kilnockie may have
lost today,

1821
01:47:57,670 --> 01:47:59,570
but they did not fail.

1822
01:48:04,677 --> 01:48:06,577
How does it feel to have
come so close?

1823
01:48:06,679 --> 01:48:09,113
What can I say, lads?
What can I say?

1824
01:48:09,215 --> 01:48:11,547
Just, you know--

1825
01:48:11,650 --> 01:48:13,880
cheers.
Cheers, all right?

1826
01:48:13,986 --> 01:48:16,181
Better luck in Dublin.

1827
01:48:19,692 --> 01:48:21,956
I don't think so,
fellas.

1828
01:48:22,061 --> 01:48:24,222
Look at these people.

1829
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:26,230
You can't buy
this kind of loyalty.

1830
01:48:26,332 --> 01:48:28,562
I think we're gonna stay
right here.

1831
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:30,692
Next year we're gonna
win this thing.

1832
01:48:43,382 --> 01:48:46,283
I can't do anything
about getting old...

1833
01:48:48,454 --> 01:48:50,649
my-- my wee lamb.

1834
01:48:54,193 --> 01:48:56,889
- It's all right.
- I missed you.

1835
01:48:56,996 --> 01:48:58,896
It's a good feeling.

1836
01:48:58,998 --> 01:49:01,796
A good feeling.
A feeling of relief.

1837
01:49:01,901 --> 01:49:04,768
Brian, hold this.

1838
01:49:04,870 --> 01:49:05,996
Gordon.

1839
01:49:08,474 --> 01:49:10,999
Winning by penalty kicks
isn't winning.

1840
01:49:11,110 --> 01:49:13,408
Maybe not...

1841
01:49:13,512 --> 01:49:17,812
but, I'd rather see my name
on the Cup than yours.

1842
01:49:20,619 --> 01:49:22,587
Cheers.

1843
01:49:26,558 --> 01:49:29,391
Here.
You hold it, yeah?

1844
01:49:29,495 --> 01:49:31,554
Left hand.

1845
01:49:31,664 --> 01:49:34,132
Pound says wee Jackie
gets the first fish.

1846
01:49:34,233 --> 01:49:37,725
If he catches one before me,
he's walking home.

1847
01:49:42,274 --> 01:49:44,003
( reel spinning )

1848
01:49:44,109 --> 01:49:46,134
Kate:
Fish in !

1849
01:49:47,246 --> 01:49:50,306
- Eh?
- Fish in !

1850
01:49:50,416 --> 01:49:52,145
Go on, Katie !

1851
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:00,058
Whew!

1852
01:50:03,929 --> 01:50:06,295
At least we're not
walking home, eh?
