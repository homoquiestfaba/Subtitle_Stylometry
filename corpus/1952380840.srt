1
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:19,280
CYCLONE

2
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:45,530
- There.
- What happened?

3
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:48,300
I made him take his foot bed.

4
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:52,137
- You're terrible. 
- Is his problem.

5
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:55,439
Anyway, he should tell his wife.

6
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,174
It is incredible.

7
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:59,877
Broad shoulders, shelves ...
A cannon.

8
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:02,413
- You'll recall?
- No.

9
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:04,215
He is married.

10
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:06,517
No, I do not want him to ideas.

11
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:09,453
- I do not believe it.
- You do not kill, Des.

12
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,057
We rowed for a date, and you,
you throw like handkerchiefs.

13
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:15,392
It is true that it is not bad.

14
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:18,028
I did not need to know.

15
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:22,031
Mick, I have told you a thousand
times, but it tastes.

16
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:23,132
Seriously.

17
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,034
How quickly you become leader?

18
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,805
- A few years. Why?
- I should try.

19
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:31,607
I thought you liked your job.

20
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:35,912
Yeah, but this is what
I want to do.

21
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,313
I've heard that.

22
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:42,785
I should do something more
exciting or creative.

23
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:46,189
For your last job you wanted
more stability.

24
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:47,522
Maybe.

25
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:51,827
Before resigning, Sean and
I would like you help us.

26
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:57,933
We'll buy a flat.

27
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:01,537
Well, when did you decide that?

28
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:02,871
A few days ago.

29
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:06,174
The contract ends in a month,
I think it's time.

30
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:08,210
That's cool.

31
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:11,113
- All-You must be crazy.
- Yeah.

32
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:16,451
Yeah, I just fear not being
able to afford it.

33
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:17,952
This will be achieved.

34
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:19,286
I know.

35
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,357
- Provided that it is not tiny.
- So, JD?

36
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,693
I take care of rentals,
not sales.

37
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,796
- But I will find out.
- As long as it is economic.

38
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:32,233
Or barter.
I am willing to prostitute
myself to your cause.

39
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,637
Fun, but a flat barter
for genital warts?

40
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,708
I see.

41
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:43,511
Mick, just for that, I will
not do the dishes.

42
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,646
You can cook yourself next time.

43
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,987
More minute.

44
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:56,157
I'm in no hurry.

45
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,226
You're past the dry cleaners?

46
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:02,629
I'd do it tomorrow.

47
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:07,734
What?

48
00:04:09,636 --> 00:04:13,473
You realize that it's
been three years?

49
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:16,475
Not bad, eh?

50
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:24,516
- Do you believe ...
- What?

51
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:30,222
What you could you hurry?
I brush my teeth.

52
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:35,194
So that's it?
It takes time to perfect.

53
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:52,944
- I know what are your favorite.
- You're awesome.

54
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,882
Remind me never to get you out.

55
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:59,684
Excellent.

56
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:03,921
- No kids in fine restaurants?
- You do nothing else.

57
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,424
And then? There were?

58
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:09,193
Your mother.
Where is the cellophane?

59
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:11,461
You do not think it's time?

60
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:15,165
I think he would have liked
it happens to you.

61
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,970
This is not so simple.

62
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:26,643
- I have errands to run. At all.
- Wait.

63
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,124
- Hey, Desmond, right?
- Yes.

64
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,560
It was seen in Panache
a month ago.

65
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,330
- Ah, yes.
- You never recalled.

66
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,400
Sorry ...

67
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:54,037
I was overloaded. You know that.

68
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:57,439
Yeah. It was hot that night.

69
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,209
It's true.

70
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:04,980
- We should do it again.
- You read my thoughts.

71
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:11,819
- Here's my number, again.
- I would use it.

72
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:15,356
Good.
You can choose the restaurant.

73
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:21,430
- For dinner.
- Sure. Obviously.

74
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:26,200
- See you then.
- Sure.

75
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:50,357
- Look at that.
- Hi.

76
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:52,526
You're too cute.

77
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:56,063
I love these toasts.

78
00:06:56,797 --> 00:07:00,400
- You thought it was for you?
- It would be better.

79
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:05,439
Listen, I know you've always
wanted to go to Aruba

80
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:08,140
and yesterday I found
a cheap flight.

81
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:09,442
Should be set aside.

82
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:14,580
It looks cool, but should rather
save for the apartment.

83
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:19,685
But we can continue
to have fun, right?

84
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:22,955
We'll have to tighten
their belts a bit.

85
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:25,458
Okay.

86
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:29,629
I make an appointment
for a few visits.

87
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:32,164
- Ever?
- Just to see.

88
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:34,165
It would not hurt.

89
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,701
Tomorrow after work,
for example?

90
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:40,005
I thought we could see a show.

91
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:43,476
I am anxious to do it. Not you?

92
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:47,146
- Yeah.
- Super.

93
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:57,922
Why is the sexiest
who pays for sex?

94
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:01,359
Not listen? He said ...

95
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:03,160
In short, continues to smoke.

96
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:07,564
About, rotate, selfish.

97
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:10,869
- I get you something?
- Him.

98
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,404
After me.

99
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,040
- JD was first.
- You bring me a beer?

100
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:20,110
- I heard you.
- This is the beginning
of the end for you.

101
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:22,146
What does it mean?

102
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:26,216
You buy an apartment,
then you take a dog,

103
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:29,920
then you adopt a kid so cute
in a poor country ...

104
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:34,023
You ought to make T-shirts
awarded for your holiday.

105
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:37,960
Buy an apartment, it
just buy a flat.

106
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:39,396
Our apartment.

107
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:42,466
Sure.
It will make you the
best parties.

108
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:44,901
- In your dreams.
- Shut up, you hear nothing.

109
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:46,302
Thank you.

110
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:49,072
You have brought the
drugs work, Des?

111
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:51,340
I'm not as anti-allergy tablets.

112
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,710
I want some too.

113
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:55,745
- What is love you?
- Something nice.

114
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,747
A movie is fun.

115
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:00,816
You know really fun, you.

116
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:05,253
Sister.
No, I watch a movie
with the guys.

117
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,325
Saturday night?

118
00:09:10,193 --> 00:09:12,729
- In fact ...
- Fiona is me.

119
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:17,466
- Nothing, relaxed with these hopeless.
- The what?

120
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:18,900
These rabbit and Mick.

121
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:21,903
What's New?

122
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,706
You play?

123
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,741
Of course, here we go!

124
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:29,376
Yes, all of us.

125
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:34,548
I speak for them, they are drunk.
I am the designated organizer.

126
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,552
We'll be there.

127
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:39,321
Ok, we remember later.

128
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,156
Cretin.

129
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,759
Why you said nothing
of the show?

130
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:48,796
- It has been very bad.
- Putting it mildly.

131
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:52,399
Let's go. It might be okay.

132
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,036
- Ok it was not terrible.
- You owe me a.

133
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:59,372
I thought my head would explode.

134
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:01,976
- It was bad.
- At least we have a party.

135
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,612
You look like little old.

136
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:06,280
Hello.

137
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,682
- And this show?
- Fun for coming.

138
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:11,918
- I had something to do.
- Someone to make you.

139
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:17,257
Thank you very much for coming!

140
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:20,093
- Mom Congratulations.
- That's nice.

141
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:22,162
- You have been fantastic.
- Yes.

142
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:25,898
- Des, what do you prefer?
- All his interventions.

143
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:28,867
Stop, it was shabby,
and you know it.

144
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:31,171
But we are offered one evening.

145
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:35,108
- Ladies.
- Hi.

146
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:40,112
Was horribly invalid, but
you were beautiful.

147
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:41,580
Thank you.

148
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:46,251
- It bathes, Renee?
- Not in alcohol.
Where is the bar?

149
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:57,028
Is the star.

150
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:03,569
- And my favorite nephew?
- I'm fine. And you?

151
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:06,338
We discover new ailments
every day.

152
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:06,571
- Getting old is no picnic.
- Owen, okay.

153
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,877
- Then, more than a month?
- What is it?

154
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:16,113
- No, nothing.
- What a liar!

155
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,749
Next month, my uncle and
his lovely boyfriend

156
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:21,518
will celebrate their 25th anniversary
of living together.

157
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:23,954
- No kidding!
- Fantastic!

158
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:25,823
What will you do?

159
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,427
- Not much.
- What? Why not?

160
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:31,863
It does not really where
throwing a party.

161
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,465
It's small home. We dine out.

162
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:37,868
- You must have a party.
- It would be nice, Robert.

163
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,469
Come with me.

164
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,471
- Really?
- Sure.

165
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:43,573
I give him a hand.

166
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:44,975
Do not worry about it.

167
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,943
- You deserve it.
- I'll cook.

168
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,612
I assist you.

169
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:51,580
It's so nice that I do
not know what to say.

170
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,619
Thank you.
It goes straight to the heart.

171
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:58,855
We will use a glass.

172
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,327
It will be like them one day?

173
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:08,130
No. We do casera that much.

174
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:12,334
- Pardon?
- You're so gullible ...

175
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:19,941
Fiona, I'm sorry I
cut your reply.

176
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:23,245
Do not worry. Nobody noticed.

177
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,147
I know, but I apologize.

178
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,416
Let me introduce my friends.
Here is Lauren.

179
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:31,987
- Good job, congratulations.
- Not really, but thank you.

180
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:33,288
Your dress was beautiful.

181
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:36,724
- Yes, I always wanted to fly.
- Like him.

182
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,633
- Who is it?
- My friend, Drake.

183
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,236
- I should show it to you.
- Totally agreed.

184
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:54,208
And before me, I see the
biggest cock in my life.

185
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:56,444
Imagine a net full
of oranges ...

186
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:58,046
- Damn ...
- What did you do?

187
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:02,317
I wish I could say I met the challenge,
but I preferred to leave.

188
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:06,586
Thank you, Lauren, to take me to the
public in the middle of this story.

189
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,990
Okay, they have e
perienced similar.

190
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,793
Below Drake, Adam and Wayne.

191
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,762
And you will have to make,
I do not know your names.

192
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,300
I hope you got at least
some gossip about them.

193
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,203
Do not worry, there
are plenty here.

194
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,108
Incidentally, the guy with the huge dick ...
You have his number?

195
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,644
Deadly.

196
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,595
- Are you coming?
- I'm coming.

197
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,387
You're still in ponytails?

198
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,090
They said they would
be back soon.

199
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:21,693
- Damage.
- But we should reconsider.

200
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,830
- With pleasure.
- Pass Sunday, dinner at home.

201
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,498
I'd love to.

202
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:29,633
It will be nice.

203
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:51,588
A question you always
eat so well?

204
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:53,657
- When Mick kitchen.
- I sit.

205
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:55,525
- Me too.
- Good.

206
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:57,860
The vacuum cleaner for you,
and you, the windows.

207
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,630
I tasted lots of heads,
but that's something.

208
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:02,665
You have tasted a lot of heads?

209
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,769
I had my hand, yes.

210
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:09,605
I meetings as an
event organizer.

211
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:12,542
It looks great.
I probably should ...

212
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,710
When did you start?

213
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,946
After college, back
in New England.

214
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:20,983
And then I changed.
But it's a boring story.

215
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,784
How did you hear about us?

216
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,486
In sex clubs and
private parties.

217
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:30,659
In fact, our uncle and his
buddy ran a restaurant,

218
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:33,462
and they have presented.

219
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:35,664
I know that idiot
from high school.

220
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:39,201
Idiot? Listen to me.

221
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:42,737
Once Desmond was invited to
a reception at his teacher,

222
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:45,740
and she was caught sucking
her husband.

223
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:52,746
- You do not do that ...
- What has happened?

224
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:55,816
He has never returned
to the course.

225
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,419
Because I was a gentleman.

226
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:02,523
In addition, it is not me who was
nicknamed by alcohol abuse.

227
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,695
One night, he whistled two bottles
of Jack Daniels himself.

228
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:12,299
You had to be easy prey,
that evening.

229
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:16,270
Wrong.
JD comes from "Just Delicious".

230
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,206
Love you much.

231
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:21,641
Before I forget, Drake,

232
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:24,010
you would know a florist cheap?

233
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:26,179
We organized a party
for my uncle.

234
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:30,283
I could not tell you how
pleased they are.

235
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,186
Fun.
Since when are they together?

236
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:36,923
- They are celebrating their 25 years together.
- 25!

237
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,159
- It's great.
- Yeah.

238
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:42,896
It's been years of infidelity.

239
00:16:43,196 --> 00:16:46,399
- What?
- The gays are wrong,
it is known.

240
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,772
Okay, just kidding.

241
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:09,254
- What gym you frequent?
- Midtown.

242
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:11,256
We could train together?

243
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:13,825
Sure.

244
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:15,928
You never go in a box?

245
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:20,131
- No.
- Sure, sometimes.

246
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,201
Good. It would make one.

247
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,104
- Drake.
- Oh, I'm listening.

248
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:31,008
Really, I adore you,
but you're spoiled.

249
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:34,946
How many times I asked
you to find me a guy?

250
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:37,248
- Too many times.
- And where is he?

251
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:40,318
- We need the right kind.
- No.

252
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:44,555
We must find a guy and
bring him right here.

253
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:51,394
- I call on the army.
- Thank you. A man organized!

254
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:59,569
Mick, you've hardly said anything.
Who is the lucky guy
in your life?

255
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:02,973
I do not go with anyone.

256
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:05,275
Why not?

257
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:07,811
So! Who wants a drink?

258
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,779
- Yes.
- Me too.

259
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:14,317
- We turn back one.
- Totally agree.

260
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:19,555
- It kills his mother.
- Yeah. I'm torn.

261
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:22,358
Try not to enjoy it.

262
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,760
You have the desire to make.

263
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:27,330
Who wants to go out?

264
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,568
I think I'll stay.

265
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,771
I could go out.

266
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:43,911
I want to know everything.

267
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:49,017
- Bad.
- In detail, or it will hurt.

268
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:51,152
It works.

269
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,158
It was so nice.

270
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:34,661
It was good, yes.

271
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:37,998
These are too funny!
I have not stopped laughing.

272
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:40,566
Are you sure it was not
the firecracker?

273
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,837
No. But this is not serious.

274
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:48,808
Drake wants to train with me.

275
00:19:51,411 --> 00:19:55,115
Really? And it tells you?

276
00:19:57,316 --> 00:20:00,986
If it's serious, why not.

277
00:20:02,922 --> 00:20:04,390
We'll see.

278
00:20:06,658 --> 00:20:08,493
Not so fast.

279
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:11,796
I am always ready first.

280
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,799
You have nothing else to do.

281
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:17,503
What?

282
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:27,479
I guess it can wait.

283
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:47,165
Want some?

284
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:56,640
- What is happening with Mick?
- Do not worry.

285
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,009
He is ...

286
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:00,978
Forget it.

287
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:04,415
As if I had insulted his mother.
It is because of me?

288
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,983
Not Forget ....

289
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:12,088
I felt bad.

290
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:18,562
Her man has been dead two years ago,
and he does is not delivered.

291
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,563
He died of what?

292
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:22,932
In a car accident.

293
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,802
Do not take it for you.

294
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:31,274
Since when they come together,
Sean and Bobby?

295
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:32,675
Two years.

296
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,076
They are monogamous?

297
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:39,214
Very.

298
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:44,086
- Why? They interest you?
- No, I was wondering.

299
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:46,689
You know how it goes.

300
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,762
Well, the next.

301
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,634
Hello.

302
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:22,089
JD.

303
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:26,660
Yes, on the table.

304
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:54,487
You've exhausted.
It was beastly.

305
00:22:54,654 --> 00:22:57,290
- In one week, same time?
- Yes.

306
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:02,895
- It's what happens with Sean?
- Okay.

307
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:04,796
We'll buy a flat.

308
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:07,600
I heard that. It's crazy.

309
00:23:08,368 --> 00:23:10,103
Crazy?

310
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,707
Yes.
I do not know anyone who would
be willing to take that risk.

311
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,478
Why?

312
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:24,049
You know, we argue, is
broken, it's normal.

313
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,486
No, we're ready.

314
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:31,689
Cool.

315
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:38,664
- You're fun, and you From?
- Yep, it was nice.

316
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,600
- You revisit?
- No.

317
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:46,203
- It looked like ...
- It's not serious.

318
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:50,508
You have forgotten how are the
guys after all this time.

319
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:54,478
You've never been in
a relationship?

320
00:23:57,113 --> 00:23:59,249
Once.

321
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:02,453
It did not work.

322
00:24:06,324 --> 00:24:08,726
So you're not interested Des.

323
00:24:08,892 --> 00:24:12,295
As I said, it is not serious.

324
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:17,334
"Not serious"?

325
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:21,838
You're lucky, it is too good.

326
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:25,275
We should know, he
has a big dick?

327
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:29,111
- Fairly large.
- For you?
This must be a monster.

328
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,247
Shut up, you're jealous.

329
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:35,185
- I tell Mick.
- It will tell you
that is stupid.

330
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:38,622
I hope he will recover
a little out.

331
00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:41,390
We must do something.

332
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,859
When we talk,

333
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,363
You should really think
about it life.

334
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:53,002
I'm soon to go then back
on the evening.

335
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,869
When decorating you thought?

336
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:58,940
Owen loves flowers.
We could put rows of lilies.

337
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:02,478
It's a birthday, not a marriage.

338
00:25:02,645 --> 00:25:05,514
- Or a funeral.
- Find something else.

339
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,983
- And the drinks?
- A cascade of strong alcohol.

340
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:24,064
- A coffee to go?
- Yes.

341
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,206
Thank you.

342
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:34,876
It's good to see you.

343
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:46,319
And that one? "F2 in the west."

344
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:49,890
- That's a lot of money.
- We find nothing underneath.

345
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:52,358
Enough to buy three
homes elsewhere.

346
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:53,994
You really want to live
anywhere else?

347
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:56,997
You really want to eat hamburgers
throughout your life?

348
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:57,964
Hello.

349
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:01,068
- You okay?
- We make the advertisements.

350
00:26:01,234 --> 00:26:03,203
That sounds exciting.

351
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,905
Yeah.

352
00:26:06,372 --> 00:26:09,208
Come tonight, he is
a party in a box.

353
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:11,444
I would love,

354
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:16,048
but we must do the housework
and complete records.

355
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:18,284
I'll forget that you said that.

356
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:23,488
- I'll see what I can do.
- Cool. See you later.

357
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:30,029
- Look ...
- It was Drake.

358
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:31,997
He invites us to
a party tonight.

359
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:36,434
- It was ...
- I know, but it looks great.

360
00:26:36,868 --> 00:26:40,405
- We must take care of the paperwork.
- It can wait.

361
00:26:40,572 --> 00:26:42,407
I really want.

362
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:48,646
- Well, but we will advance tomorrow.
- Well, sir.

363
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,682
I call the guys.

364
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:22,179
Here we go.

365
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:24,815
- Let's dance.
- No.

366
00:27:24,982 --> 00:27:27,518
- Go.
- No, but c'mon, you.

367
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,262
- There is a lot of guys here, huh?
- But I do not see a single man.

368
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:43,766
- You want another?
- Thank you.

369
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,405
- Hi. Want to dance?
- No, thank you.

370
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:24,739
Sorry.

371
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,073
Are you sure?

372
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,677
Perfectly.

373
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,853
It's hot. For me?

374
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:42,021
- For Mick, but I do not see him.
- In this case ...

375
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:50,164
- Sean seems to have some fun.
- It's true.

376
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:54,535
That you are missing
out on celibacy?

377
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,971
Not really. Why?

378
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:02,275
You would have much success.
They'll ogle all.

379
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,144
I'm happy with what I have.

380
00:29:05,378 --> 00:29:08,381
You're lucky.
Thanks for the drink.

381
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:16,055
- Hi. This is for you.
- Thank you.

382
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,794
You often come here?

383
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:25,030
Not bad.
Especially for the room.

384
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,665
Most of these guys are stupid.

385
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,001
I had not noticed.

386
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,705
Desmond told me that
your man had died.

387
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,744
- Really?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

388
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,751
He said it's been a long time.
You do not see anyone?

389
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,619
I do not talk.

390
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,689
Okay. Sorry.

391
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:57,862
But it's been a while, right?
You end up relying.

392
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,100
Have you ever lost
someone you loved?

393
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:08,873
Yes.

394
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,377
Then you should know we do
not say these things.

395
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:23,787
- Are you ready to dance now?
- No.

396
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,356
- A pipe, then?
- Fuck you!

397
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:29,092
Your buddies said you
wanted to share.

398
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:32,195
- Who told you that?
- The guys on the track.

399
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:42,505
- I go, I have a headache.
- Well, I'll tell the guys.

400
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,488
Shall we?

401
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:04,126
Already? It is too early.
Come, have fun.

402
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:11,533
- I'm tired. Shall we?
- A little later, okay?

403
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,851
Yes. It's crazy here.

404
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:33,788
I'm going to the toilet.
I come back.

405
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:35,256
At all.

406
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:43,131
- I saw you talking to this guy.
- Yeah.

407
00:31:44,197 --> 00:31:47,834
- You'll go with him?
- Maybe.

408
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:51,805
- Would you rather go with me?
- Maybe.

409
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:08,889
What a bastard!

410
00:32:10,123 --> 00:32:13,126
- Is everything okay?
- It was fine.

411
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:17,029
- Pardon?
- No, it has nothing
to do with you.

412
00:32:17,797 --> 00:32:19,098
Want to dance?

413
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:24,170
You know what? Get out of here?

414
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:29,109
- You're fast.
- You have the rhythm?

415
00:33:00,972 --> 00:33:03,174
Go, do not be like that.

416
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:05,009
I wanted to go for an hour.

417
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:09,214
- You made faces, admit it.
- It is not that.

418
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,050
We can not always do
the same thing.

419
00:33:13,183 --> 00:33:15,018
We're going to bed?

420
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:18,322
- I want to listen to music.
- It is late.

421
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:22,059
And this! You want some?

422
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:23,728
Have fun.

423
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,963
Not funny.

424
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:37,141
- You have terrible hands.
- It's what I said.

425
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:40,042
Then I cash.

426
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,713
- I have a little business on the 13th.
- Sympa.

427
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,784
- My sister is a physiotherapist.
- I do not remember
your sister ...

428
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:52,623
No. You've got one bigger.

429
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:54,824
Emerges immediately.

430
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,528
- Not until you have not finished.
- And if I finish it?

431
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:01,931
Get ready for retaliation.

432
00:34:06,868 --> 00:34:11,306
It looks nice. Like what?

433
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:25,187
There holds up my spine.

434
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:30,625
- Why this one?
- Owen loves it.

435
00:34:31,593 --> 00:34:34,029
And this one, Sean?

436
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:36,163
Yeah.

437
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,600
- You still have the hangover?
- Maybe.

438
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:41,101
Yes.

439
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:45,372
- It is no longer drinking?
- It is returned late yesterday.

440
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,610
It was great, we danced
for hours.

441
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:50,178
Yeah, it was deadly.

442
00:34:50,945 --> 00:34:52,646
"Fatal", eh?

443
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:54,848
- You have busted?
- Some yes.

444
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:56,984
- Of course.
- And Drake.

445
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:59,286
He headed the guy Desmond?

446
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:03,591
It did not bother Des.
He went with someone else.

447
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,726
- I saw you with a guy.
- It was nothing.

448
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:11,998
- He was interested.
- You bet. This club is a mess.

449
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:13,600
It looks terrible.

450
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:18,205
Tons of guns trying to kiss.
How horrible!

451
00:35:19,472 --> 00:35:21,140
You were lucky, JD?

452
00:35:21,307 --> 00:35:26,279
I talked with some guys.
I would not be fit yesterday.

453
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,216
I should cut my hair?
They were all short.

454
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:33,086
Do not do it for them,
you do not want.

455
00:35:33,552 --> 00:35:35,120
You, maybe.

456
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:36,688
And this one?

457
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:39,224
- No.
- My God, my head!

458
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:40,892
You know what you need?

459
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:49,735
I adore you.

460
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:54,740
Sorry I'm late. ... I missed

461
00:35:55,274 --> 00:35:57,042
Hello!

462
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:01,613
Fortunately, I hurried back.

463
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:14,926
You do not come here
for our coffee.

464
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:18,663
Especially since he is
facing this franchise.

465
00:36:20,498 --> 00:36:24,135
But you come every day.
I wonder why.

466
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:28,239
The coffee is good.

467
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:33,176
You're cute when you lie.

468
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:40,518
Hold. It is for me.

469
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:47,457
Thank you.

470
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:01,503
My ears were whistling
for two days.

471
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,573
- It was the big party.
- And there was the choice.

472
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,443
True enough.

473
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,079
It does not bother
thee, is it not?

474
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:10,980
I can not complain.

475
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:12,515
There is peace?

476
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:14,983
Absolutely.

477
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,620
- What was that Mick?
- An evening at the restaurant.

478
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:21,457
- And Bobby?
- It has customers
tomorrow morning.

479
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:25,060
- It's not an excuse.
- He works hard.
He goes to bed early.

480
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:29,064
- What do you want?
- I do not know, I go with you.

481
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:30,331
A scotch.

482
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:39,274
- Not bad.
- That's my style.

483
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,810
Mine too.

484
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:50,084
- Why not?
- It just seems that ...

485
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,654
you're looking for
guys who want ...

486
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:57,492
The huts are looking huts.
Simple as that.

487
00:37:57,657 --> 00:37:58,725
Thank you.

488
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:00,794
I can not get a hit?

489
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,765
- It's not that ...
- You might just as well.

490
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:06,834
You see? Thanks.

491
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:08,136
Not enough.

492
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:14,274
With other clothes and some weight
training, you will be mortal.

493
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:20,180
I see.

494
00:38:24,183 --> 00:38:26,018
I'll put music.

495
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:27,853
JD ...

496
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,493
- Was really necessary?
- Was a suggestion.

497
00:38:37,763 --> 00:38:42,201
JD lack a bit of confidence sometimes.
You should soften
your suggestions.

498
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:43,502
Okay.

499
00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:45,371
How goes the search
for apartment?

500
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:48,240
It makes me tired a bit.

501
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:50,476
I can be frank with you?

502
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,880
- Go ahead.
- You're not the kind
you put them.

503
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:56,614
I know that loves you partying.

504
00:38:58,184 --> 00:38:59,718
Are you sure you're ready?

505
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:03,956
Without wishing to interfere ...

506
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:05,858
No, that's good.

507
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:10,728
I'm not 100% sure.
Everything is going very fast.

508
00:39:11,029 --> 00:39:15,300
- Bobby look convinced.
- He only talks about it.

509
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:25,609
Looks like he does what he wants without
thinking too much about you.

510
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:29,781
No, that's not it.
I want this room too, but ...

511
00:39:29,948 --> 00:39:32,250
Is cumbersome, of course.

512
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,056
Do nothing that you're not sure.

513
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:42,960
You'll end up knowing.

514
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:49,900
You must have better things to
do than listen to me complain.

515
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:52,168
I'll see if JD is fine.

516
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:06,048
- What are you doing?
- What?

517
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,351
What are you doing?

518
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:12,922
I discuss it all.
There is no worries.

519
00:40:13,856 --> 00:40:16,893
- Because you say that ...
- No worries.

520
00:40:31,773 --> 00:40:34,576
The film we wanted to see
released this week.

521
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,611
Prices have increased.

522
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,117
This is perhaps not
the right time.

523
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,452
The market is favorable.

524
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:48,456
- We have no better ...
- I do not mean the market

525
00:40:48,923 --> 00:40:50,257
but us.

526
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:54,529
What do you mean?

527
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:57,766
For work, our lives ...
I do not know.

528
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:01,636
You were quite hence before.

529
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,005
- You have told me.
- I know.

530
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:06,674
So what?

531
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,446
I do not know. Nothing.

532
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,685
I think that is what
we should do.

533
00:41:21,322 --> 00:41:25,626
- But if you ...
- I must be tired.

534
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:27,628
Never mind.

535
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:35,335
You have three new messages.

536
00:41:35,501 --> 00:41:38,204
- First message
- Louis.

537
00:41:41,174 --> 00:41:43,710
Your messages have been deleted.

538
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:47,880
- Yes?
- It's JD.

539
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,217
I need advice on wine that
will be on the menu.

540
00:41:56,155 --> 00:41:57,156
Not bad, eh?

541
00:41:58,056 --> 00:41:59,725
It does not?

542
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:03,362
It's a bit too much for you.

543
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:07,265
What?
No, Drake is the kind of
stuff all the time.

544
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:11,637
It does not suit me?

545
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:14,071
No, it's not like you.

546
00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:18,076
This is Desmond, not to
Drake that you please.

547
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:22,481
Yes, but it will not affect my
opinion on your dress sense.

548
00:42:22,648 --> 00:42:24,316
Of course it does.

549
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:28,152
At the slightest change
you make fun of me.

550
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,255
- It's not that, but ...
- Keep it for yourself.

551
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:34,191
You plunge.
We'll talk about wine.

552
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:45,168
It was great.
In fact, I can not wait
to get to Wednesday.

553
00:42:45,336 --> 00:42:48,406
Yes.
It's nice to train with someone.

554
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:50,107
Clearly.

555
00:42:55,445 --> 00:42:57,947
- Sorry.
- I do not ...

556
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:05,221
It's my fault, I had
the wrong idea.

557
00:43:05,655 --> 00:43:10,393
- It's okay.
- Okay. You gonna say what?

558
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,998
You and Sean ...

559
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:19,035
You do not seem to be on
the same wavelength.

560
00:43:19,202 --> 00:43:21,037
You do not want the same thing.

561
00:43:22,638 --> 00:43:26,642
I thought we had connected.
I hope you'll soon forget it.

562
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:28,510
It's good.

563
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:32,047
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, everything is fine.

564
00:43:34,249 --> 00:43:36,151
- Sorry.
- Quiet.

565
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,286
See you later.

566
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:49,465
Who will come in the family?

567
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,366
Hold.

568
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:58,039
- And those who have not responded?
- Here.

569
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:01,409
The last one said yes, actually.

570
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,411
Mick, you pass me the dumplings?

571
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:11,385
What's wrong?

572
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:15,723
Guys, we finish it?

573
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,659
- There are more important things.
- As your clothes?

574
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:22,597
- You do not like what I wear?
- It's not serious.

575
00:44:25,565 --> 00:44:27,801
Mick and the menu?

576
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:43,383
It made me look good.

577
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:47,687
- We could change things?
- What?

578
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,458
Instead of asparagus, you could make your pumpkin?
It's delicious.

579
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:55,728
The dishes and accompaniments
are complementary.

580
00:44:55,895 --> 00:44:59,365
The fish is too risky.
People do not like too much.

581
00:44:59,632 --> 00:45:00,599
Yeah.

582
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:03,804
You know what, forget it.

583
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:07,072
You can fend for themselves.

584
00:45:07,606 --> 00:45:10,142
- Cook yourself.
- You do not mean ...

585
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:12,311
And you can shut up about me.

586
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:15,848
It is so serious you have
talked to John Drake?

587
00:45:15,948 --> 00:45:17,483
It does not concern him.

588
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:21,753
Sorry, but this is not the biggest
secret in the world.

589
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,489
It is time to move on, admit it.

590
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,126
Not bad, from Mr. Blow-a-night.

591
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:30,962
- Guys ...
- No! Enough!

592
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,565
We all know.

593
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:44,042
I do not speak of your
business to others.

594
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,879
And I am not come to lynch
me by my friends.

595
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:50,781
You never loved anyone
more than one night,

596
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:54,985
and it is you who will tell me
it is time to turn the page?

597
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:58,555
I will turn the page
when I have decided.

598
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,203
I order pizza for the evening?

599
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:16,873
It was super nice.

600
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:21,344
I do not know what
happens to them.

601
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,513
- And you?
- Me?

602
00:46:25,481 --> 00:46:27,016
You were very remote.

603
00:46:27,683 --> 00:46:31,320
I was busy.
There was not much time.

604
00:46:31,487 --> 00:46:33,422
I know.

605
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:38,895
But I feel it is time we ...

606
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:43,899
I think we should leave.

607
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:47,669
Well, I talk to guys.
To dance? Drink?

608
00:46:47,836 --> 00:46:49,004
Just you and myself.

609
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:52,774
Oh, okay.

610
00:46:53,308 --> 00:46:54,776
They say on Friday?

611
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:57,113
We will discover a new
box with Drake.

612
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,681
- You can do it again.
- But we expected ...

613
00:46:59,848 --> 00:47:01,883
You have planned ...

614
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:04,119
Should we spend time together.

615
00:47:04,286 --> 00:47:07,656
- I understand, but I say ...
- Wait.

616
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,058
Exits.

617
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:13,427
Okay.

618
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,508
It's good to get out a bit.
Guys are so uptight ...

619
00:47:26,674 --> 00:47:30,878
- Why?
- This must be the anniversary.

620
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:33,514
They poked fun at
my new clothes.

621
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:34,682
Your clothes?

622
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:37,017
What do you say?

623
00:47:41,154 --> 00:47:42,855
I think you hit.

624
00:47:43,957 --> 00:47:45,625
Really?

625
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:47,961
Thank you.

626
00:47:51,398 --> 00:47:54,435
- They put you down too.
- No, you think?

627
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,538
Like the other night when you
spoke of your kind of guys.

628
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:02,241
Anything.
You can be whoever you want.

629
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:05,378
- That's what I think.
- Life is too short.

630
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:08,081
You gotta do what you want.

631
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,050
I've thought a lot.
... My work so bored

632
00:48:12,284 --> 00:48:14,853
- Loose it.
- Yeah.

633
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:20,192
How long it will take you to do
what you've always dreamed of?

634
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,296
Ten years? If you're lucky.

635
00:48:25,063 --> 00:48:29,801
You choose wrong, you crazy your life
away, and he left to do is nothing.

636
00:48:30,902 --> 00:48:32,270
No one.

637
00:48:35,407 --> 00:48:38,310
We need you to do. Now.

638
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:41,979
The others I never
speak like that.

639
00:48:42,346 --> 00:48:45,983
- I control everything, and my life ...
- That's it! It's you.

640
00:48:47,953 --> 00:48:52,024
All-control "is what
you are now.

641
00:48:52,189 --> 00:48:55,893
- We should call you "TC."
- Very funny.

642
00:48:58,696 --> 00:49:02,233
- So?
- Seriously?

643
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:06,903
Yeah. Yeah!

644
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:10,173
Yeah, I feel good.

645
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:13,076
- TC.
- Yeah, TC.

646
00:49:22,218 --> 00:49:24,587
It feels good to be with you.

647
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:28,224
It's true. I'm glad we came out.

648
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:30,427
So do I.

649
00:49:35,297 --> 00:49:39,068
You always have such strange
ideas about the apartment?

650
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:43,305
Odd? I think it's pretty normal.

651
00:49:43,907 --> 00:49:45,708
You did not have them before.

652
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,111
That does not mean
they are weird.

653
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,379
I chose my words poorly.

654
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:52,948
Sorry.

655
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:56,618
I do not want to make a decision,
if it is not safe.

656
00:49:57,152 --> 00:49:58,787
If you are not sure.

657
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,458
- Where is the difference?
- There is a big difference.

658
00:50:02,957 --> 00:50:05,159
If you're not on the
same wavelength ...

659
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,727
Okay, homos?

660
00:50:07,695 --> 00:50:11,599
Desmond is outside, on the
phone with a victory.

661
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,901
What are you doing here?

662
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,938
I told him to go after dinner.

663
00:50:16,104 --> 00:50:17,438
Pardon?

664
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:22,110
It does not matter, after, right?
You can go find that box.

665
00:50:22,276 --> 00:50:24,412
It was supposed to be
an intimate evening.

666
00:50:27,181 --> 00:50:29,650
- I can go.
- You're already there.

667
00:50:29,783 --> 00:50:33,587
- There was no plan, no?
- It has none.

668
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:38,091
Why not enjoy and have fun?

669
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:43,131
Sorry, it's my fault.
I'll do it.

670
00:50:45,532 --> 00:50:48,768
- Where is Mick?
- Angry with Desmond, I guess.

671
00:50:48,935 --> 00:50:51,071
- They have not discussed?
- I guess not.

672
00:50:51,238 --> 00:50:52,706
Bobby, you come in box?

673
00:50:52,939 --> 00:50:55,509
- I do not think so.
- Need we're celebrating it.

674
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:57,611
I dropped my job today.

675
00:50:58,043 --> 00:50:59,411
What? Why?

676
00:51:00,212 --> 00:51:02,815
My new self is preparing
for a new life.

677
00:51:04,683 --> 00:51:07,786
You always say that I'm making
decisions, then that's it.

678
00:51:07,954 --> 00:51:11,424
- You found something?
- No, but it will come.

679
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:14,394
Something much better real estate agent.
It must.

680
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:17,029
It is a bad idea, JD.

681
00:51:17,496 --> 00:51:19,665
Call me TC.

682
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:21,333
Pardon?

683
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:25,171
All-control "is me.

684
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:29,073
You're not serious.

685
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:34,779
My new me wants to go dancing.
Come, Bobby.

686
00:51:36,115 --> 00:51:37,449
Good.

687
00:51:37,983 --> 00:51:40,085
We Gon.

688
00:51:50,461 --> 00:51:53,631
You have come, great.
Where is Mick?

689
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:57,235
He is angry because you
spoke to her ex.

690
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:01,705
You do not say it was taboo.
He has to relax.

691
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,375
It is a difficult step to cross.

692
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:07,779
- I'm going to shoot me a drink.
- I'll follow you.

693
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:13,650
- Look who that is.
- Hi.

694
00:52:13,784 --> 00:52:16,253
I feel I see you again.

695
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:19,656
- Cool.
- You have given more news.

696
00:52:19,823 --> 00:52:22,693
I know. I was very busy.

697
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:26,330
Fortunately, I'm not vindictive.
I offer you a drink?

698
00:52:26,996 --> 00:52:28,364
Okay.

699
00:53:30,392 --> 00:53:32,761
- Have you seen Bobby?
- I think he's gone.

700
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:35,664
Shit. When?

701
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,700
- I'm going.
- No, finish your drink.

702
00:53:39,867 --> 00:53:41,268
Ira.

703
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:45,439
If he just let go as we ...

704
00:53:45,606 --> 00:53:46,840
As before.

705
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:48,375
Things change.

706
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:52,146
But you can not control it,
he does what he wants.

707
00:53:54,848 --> 00:53:58,485
Think there are a bunch of guys
who would go out with you.

708
00:53:59,687 --> 00:54:02,256
You have the choice, that's all.

709
00:54:04,957 --> 00:54:07,627
- Okay.
- Good luck.

710
00:54:17,669 --> 00:54:21,206
You have a plan for tonight?

711
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,311
Well, I think it is
there, my plan.

712
00:54:27,513 --> 00:54:32,051
- Your friend has a problem?
- No, it is just too
much sometimes.

713
00:54:33,251 --> 00:54:34,853
He forces too.

714
00:54:35,187 --> 00:54:39,758
I help you?
It's so nice to bring
someone intoxicated.

715
00:54:39,925 --> 00:54:40,926
I see.

716
00:54:41,593 --> 00:54:44,129
- What are you doing?
- It is time, let's go.

717
00:54:44,296 --> 00:54:46,064
Let me go, okay!

718
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:50,534
- Here we go.
- Go.

719
00:54:55,006 --> 00:54:57,609
- The handsome, Des met!
- That's me.

720
00:54:57,743 --> 00:55:00,479
He's cute ...
You should go out with him.

721
00:55:00,644 --> 00:55:02,980
- He has good taste.
- Really?

722
00:55:03,147 --> 00:55:04,448
Advance.

723
00:55:05,883 --> 00:55:08,919
It's nice to lending
me your DVDs.

724
00:55:09,086 --> 00:55:10,788
We need to talk.

725
00:55:11,188 --> 00:55:13,958
- Why do you play with them?
- With whom?

726
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,626
You know who I mean.

727
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:17,360
I try to be nice.

728
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:19,362
We really need to back
through here?

729
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,266
How do you annoy people to
take revenge on Kyle?

730
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:26,103
I told you never talk to me.

731
00:55:27,138 --> 00:55:29,640
I know it has been hard.

732
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:33,042
He left with your best
friend is rotten.

733
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:36,613
But it will destroy you if
you do not turn your page.

734
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:57,333
- Attention, JD.
- Sit down.

735
00:55:59,268 --> 00:56:01,937
- My God ...
- I have done my good
deed for the day.

736
00:56:02,104 --> 00:56:06,141
- It should not come here.
- It does not matter. Okay?

737
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:08,977
I hope he has a great hangover.

738
00:56:10,546 --> 00:56:13,415
There are few people who would
have helped me like that.

739
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:16,184
I know how to compensate.

740
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:20,255
Listen, I want to be clear.

741
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,292
I ...

742
00:56:27,695 --> 00:56:30,131
Thank you for the massage
the other night.

743
00:56:31,032 --> 00:56:34,168
Okay.'s When you want.

744
00:56:44,378 --> 00:56:45,880
Come.

745
00:57:19,846 --> 00:57:21,448
Confused by what?

746
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:24,451
It was a little freaked
out, but that's all.

747
00:57:24,617 --> 00:57:27,419
If it does not prepare
dinner, we must know.

748
00:57:27,586 --> 00:57:31,090
- There is only one week.
- Yes, but he did not call back.

749
00:57:31,257 --> 00:57:32,892
He wants to worry perhaps.

750
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:37,096
It's okay, I'll deal.

751
00:57:37,428 --> 00:57:39,030
Good. where are the calls?

752
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:40,332
Invitations.

753
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,636
The list of Desmond.
They will not come for most.

754
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,539
For the most?

755
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:50,075
It's a bit confusing.

756
00:57:50,976 --> 00:57:53,412
You probably should stop
out and get loaded.

757
00:57:53,578 --> 00:57:56,281
- It is you who is gone.
- You have not noticed.

758
00:57:57,081 --> 00:57:59,417
Mom and Dad argue.

759
00:58:02,787 --> 00:58:05,890
- If you need help ...
- No, that's fine.

760
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:09,961
- Bobby, Uncle Robert will be ...
- ira.

761
00:58:10,128 --> 00:58:12,497
Yes, everything is going
very well happen.

762
00:58:18,102 --> 00:58:21,439
- It was really necessary?
- JD and Des And ask to dinner?

763
00:58:21,605 --> 00:58:24,875
I have already said they
had no plans, so ...

764
00:58:25,108 --> 00:58:26,977
I need to call Mick.

765
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:36,653
- Hi.
- God thank you, you're there.

766
00:58:36,887 --> 00:58:39,856
Please, tell me you always
come to the party.

767
00:58:40,724 --> 00:58:41,959
I do not know.

768
00:58:42,859 --> 00:58:45,662
Desmond was wrong to
speak at Drake.

769
00:58:46,196 --> 00:58:48,365
He has done much the last con.

770
00:58:48,531 --> 00:58:52,401
But it needs you.
You're the best chef
in the world.

771
00:58:54,136 --> 00:58:55,371
I think about it.

772
00:58:55,905 --> 00:58:58,341
It will suck up all for today.

773
00:58:58,507 --> 00:59:01,110
See you at home tomorrow.
Will you come?

774
00:59:01,978 --> 00:59:04,246
Okay. I'll call you later.

775
00:59:09,785 --> 00:59:10,886
TC.

776
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,455
How are you?

777
00:59:12,622 --> 00:59:14,790
I can not complain. What's New?

778
00:59:14,957 --> 00:59:16,859
You want to go out tonight?

779
00:59:17,258 --> 00:59:19,160
No. I have a thing to be done.

780
00:59:20,328 --> 00:59:24,432
Good. I was hoping we could ...

781
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:27,235
I gotta go. We remember.

782
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,112
- Yes?
- You do not look cheerful.

783
00:59:37,846 --> 00:59:40,715
Hello. Sorry.

784
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:44,085
I have tired of the organization
of the dinner,

785
00:59:44,252 --> 00:59:46,521
and Bobby did not let
go of the day.

786
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:49,890
You need to decompress.
Come on, we'll have a drink.

787
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:54,695
I'd love to, but I really
have finished it.

788
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:57,765
It will eventually happen.
I invite you to the first glass.

789
00:59:59,533 --> 01:00:01,535
And shit. Where?

790
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:12,212
- Where you going?
- I digress slightly.

791
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:16,016
Are you kidding?
You bump tomorrow, and you've
got to do the dishes.

792
01:00:16,182 --> 01:00:18,017
Later, okay?

793
01:00:18,184 --> 01:00:20,653
What happens?

794
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,124
Just because we grow old
we must play the old.

795
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:27,894
What does it mean?

796
01:00:28,261 --> 01:00:31,431
It is not Robert and Owen.
I need to get out.

797
01:00:31,597 --> 01:00:33,733
Sean? Wait.

798
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:43,975
Hullo?

799
01:00:44,342 --> 01:00:47,312
You hate to remind people, eh?

800
01:00:48,447 --> 01:00:51,817
- Hi, Louis.
- I thought of you.

801
01:00:53,118 --> 01:00:56,555
That's cool. Thank you.

802
01:00:57,622 --> 01:00:59,324
Above all, cover your joy.

803
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:04,963
- Sorry, is that I work.
- I make you walk.

804
01:01:05,497 --> 01:01:07,265
But it's true, I thought of you.

805
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,169
I wondered if you wanted
it is found.

806
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,907
We could have fun while
sitting for work.

807
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:19,877
- What time do you get?
- I was thinking out.

808
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:25,049
I'll take dinner, and we
learn about each other.

809
01:01:27,485 --> 01:01:29,787
I'm busy this week.

810
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:32,089
So, this weekend?

811
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:35,326
I'll have to check.

812
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,096
You do not want to
know me, right?

813
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:43,032
- No, that's not it.
- So what?

814
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,302
Because ...

815
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,172
What you thought when
you slept together?

816
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:53,476
I thought I was interested,
we started something.

817
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,945
It was just sex, Louis.

818
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,015
I see.

819
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:03,720
I guess I've misjudged.
Sorry to make you
waste your time.

820
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,388
Louis ...

821
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:18,333
Then it got completely crushed
before Fiona and Renee.

822
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:22,272
It is supposed to help
me, do me a hard time.

823
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,808
Hold.

824
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:27,442
Thank you.

825
01:02:27,609 --> 01:02:31,113
- I thought we came out.
- One more, and here we go.

826
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:33,682
I'm getting drunk.

827
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:37,352
It should not do that
to you before others.

828
01:02:37,518 --> 01:02:38,653
This is what I say!

829
01:02:39,587 --> 01:02:42,223
He knows I'm overwhelmed
right now.

830
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,759
Looks like he is selfish.

831
01:02:45,526 --> 01:02:46,828
Yeah ...

832
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:51,200
No. Finally, who knows?

833
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:53,501
I'm tired of his headaches.

834
01:02:55,736 --> 01:02:58,840
My God, I can not
stop complaining.

835
01:02:59,273 --> 01:03:00,441
Sorry.

836
01:03:00,575 --> 01:03:02,610
It happens to you with
your friends?

837
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:06,781
When they start to annoy
me, I get rid of.

838
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:10,851
- No more?
- Course.

839
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:14,487
I can not let someone
run my life.

840
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:18,159
This happens to me ...
I am going.

841
01:03:19,092 --> 01:03:22,596
You said it.
That is all that awaits me.

842
01:03:22,996 --> 01:03:25,565
No way. You're young.

843
01:03:25,966 --> 01:03:30,370
Not really.
I can not ever again.

844
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:34,107
I do not want to end up
like these frustrated

845
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,809
who can not maintain
their relationship.

846
01:03:36,976 --> 01:03:41,280
But get me ...
a whole new world.

847
01:03:41,714 --> 01:03:43,716
It depends on what you want.

848
01:03:46,553 --> 01:03:48,588
I feel stupid.

849
01:03:49,455 --> 01:03:51,957
I do not know why he wants
to stay with me.

850
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:53,425
You're talking nonsense.

851
01:03:54,727 --> 01:03:58,397
You are intelligent,
funny, beautiful.

852
01:03:58,564 --> 01:04:00,366
Everybody knows.

853
01:04:01,033 --> 01:04:03,702
You just enjoy life.

854
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:05,403
Enjoy it thoroughly.

855
01:04:06,004 --> 01:04:08,106
Enjoy it thoroughly.

856
01:04:09,274 --> 01:04:10,541
If only ...

857
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:19,150
It's good.

858
01:04:20,985 --> 01:04:22,086
Bobby ...

859
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:40,471
Enjoy thoroughly.

860
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,885
Stand up, you'll be
late for work.

861
01:06:39,085 --> 01:06:40,987
I'm not going.

862
01:06:42,989 --> 01:06:44,657
The hangover?

863
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:47,226
Fantastic.

864
01:06:57,436 --> 01:07:00,305
- You do not look well.
- Yeah.

865
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:02,075
Thank you for coming.

866
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:06,546
I do it for Robert and Owen.
You okay?

867
01:07:11,917 --> 01:07:12,851
Hello.

868
01:07:16,321 --> 01:07:18,490
- Hi.
- Hi.

869
01:07:20,158 --> 01:07:21,626
Forget fast.

870
01:07:26,864 --> 01:07:31,335
At 20:30, they will all be there.
At 21:30, Fiona will
deliver his speech.

871
01:07:31,503 --> 01:07:32,871
When do we put the music?

872
01:07:33,138 --> 01:07:35,073
When people begin to arrive.

873
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,543
And for dancing, after
the speech, no?

874
01:07:40,244 --> 01:07:42,012
It is in a meeting, or what?

875
01:07:44,515 --> 01:07:47,351
Yes, sorry. You were saying?

876
01:07:47,685 --> 01:07:50,955
- Music.
- Yes, anyone.

877
01:07:51,621 --> 01:07:53,223
What's the matter?

878
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:56,593
You can advise me?

879
01:07:56,961 --> 01:07:58,896
- Sure.
- What is it?

880
01:07:59,463 --> 01:08:00,865
Do not hate me.

881
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:06,036
- I slept with Drake yesterday.
- What?

882
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:08,104
Goddamn!

883
01:08:08,404 --> 01:08:09,372
I know.

884
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:12,142
Bobby is what you better.

885
01:08:12,308 --> 01:08:13,743
You want to fuck everything up?

886
01:08:13,977 --> 01:08:16,045
- He knows
- No.

887
01:08:16,446 --> 01:08:18,014
What you gonna do?

888
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:20,149
I do not know.

889
01:08:20,682 --> 01:08:22,217
You have to fix it.

890
01:08:22,518 --> 01:08:24,219
How did it happen?

891
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:26,990
Bobby and me, we recently
had a fight ...

892
01:08:27,123 --> 01:08:29,159
I left a few drinks.

893
01:08:29,392 --> 01:08:31,594
They discussed, Drake and me ...

894
01:08:33,028 --> 01:08:34,196
I drank too much,

895
01:08:35,597 --> 01:08:37,399
and from there ...

896
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,236
I let him.

897
01:08:43,539 --> 01:08:45,674
I can not believe it.

898
01:08:46,308 --> 01:08:48,710
What a bastard.

899
01:08:53,916 --> 01:08:54,716
Bobby ...

900
01:08:58,687 --> 01:09:01,490
- I do not want that to happen.
- Sure.

901
01:09:01,789 --> 01:09:04,692
- Sorry that you have learned like this.
- I had to learn how?

902
01:09:04,959 --> 01:09:06,160
I drank ...

903
01:09:06,661 --> 01:09:09,797
- The oldest excuse in the world.
- It was stupid ...

904
01:09:09,964 --> 01:09:11,132
I want to believe!

905
01:09:16,503 --> 01:09:19,439
- I know I have done wrong, but ...
- But what?

906
01:09:19,974 --> 01:09:22,176
You've put the pressure
with the flat ...

907
01:09:22,343 --> 01:09:24,212
Do not put it on my back! "

908
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:26,314
- No, but ...
- Shut up!

909
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:30,051
- I did not ...
- You're weak.

910
01:09:30,183 --> 01:09:32,619
He also threw on me

911
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,555
but I did not flinch.

912
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,559
Where are you going?

913
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:49,201
And to think I wanted to create
a home with you ...

914
01:10:38,216 --> 01:10:39,884
You spy on me or what?

915
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:42,754
What happened yesterday
with Sean?

916
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:45,689
- It came out together.
- Bobby left.

917
01:10:46,124 --> 01:10:46,891
It con.

918
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:51,663
- You should not have done that.
- Sean would not have said.

919
01:10:52,196 --> 01:10:54,332
Why? You could be anyone.

920
01:10:54,632 --> 01:10:56,567
Have you forgotten
our conversation.

921
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,769
You gotta do what you
want, take control.

922
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:02,472
- Even at the expense of others?
- It's not my problem.

923
01:11:02,773 --> 01:11:05,976
You're asked if Sean and Bobby
had to be together?

924
01:11:07,477 --> 01:11:08,345
I have a meeting.

925
01:11:08,578 --> 01:11:12,349
Incidentally, I thought you
were busy last night.

926
01:11:13,183 --> 01:11:14,618
Things change.

927
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:33,703
- Hello?
- Sean, Robert.

928
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:35,671
Hello.

929
01:11:36,072 --> 01:11:39,775
We are aware of what happened.
You okay?

930
01:11:40,343 --> 01:11:44,547
- Not really.
- You know it's 
omplicated, so ...

931
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:47,249
Owen and I cancel the evening.

932
01:11:48,384 --> 01:11:51,554
What? No, Robert ...

933
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,589
We thought and we prefer

934
01:11:54,889 --> 01:11:57,425
something intimate between us.

935
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,228
Do not do it because of me.

936
01:12:00,328 --> 01:12:02,497
No, it's better.

937
01:12:02,831 --> 01:12:07,001
But we wanted to thank
you, you and the boys.

938
01:12:07,736 --> 01:12:09,337
You are all wonderful.

939
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:12,907
Warn others, please. And Sean,

940
01:12:13,074 --> 01:12:14,976
take care of you.

941
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:16,711
Okay.

942
01:12:16,911 --> 01:12:18,913
- Hi.
- Hi.

943
01:12:25,152 --> 01:12:26,387
Shit.

944
01:12:31,091 --> 01:12:33,327
He looked so cool ...

945
01:12:34,094 --> 01:12:36,764
Nice career, fun, sexy ...

946
01:12:37,898 --> 01:12:41,135
Why are all those bastards?

947
01:12:41,435 --> 01:12:42,736
I do not know.

948
01:12:42,936 --> 01:12:46,340
Why I have listened?
These clothes are stupid.

949
01:12:46,607 --> 01:12:49,309
Forget it. Drake is a bastard.

950
01:12:49,409 --> 01:12:53,012
Why I do not trust
my fashion sense?

951
01:12:53,446 --> 01:12:55,982
A goal in my life, shit!

952
01:12:56,649 --> 01:13:00,486
I really think I have a problem.

953
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,688
You do not want to
stop a second?

954
01:13:03,054 --> 01:13:06,858
These things do happen.
In addition, he has
kissed a guy cased.

955
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:08,227
He played badly.

956
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:11,964
This is not what you did
with this guy married?

957
01:13:12,231 --> 01:13:14,100
We must get him out
of the closet.

958
01:13:14,434 --> 01:13:15,902
But he was stuffed, right?

959
01:13:16,736 --> 01:13:19,205
You're exaggerating,
it's not so bad.

960
01:13:19,438 --> 01:13:20,439
No?

961
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,441
You know you're a big con.

962
01:13:22,674 --> 01:13:25,944
I look angry?
But it was I who slept with him.

963
01:13:26,077 --> 01:13:28,814
- You do not get nervous for nothing.
- Exactly.

964
01:13:30,148 --> 01:13:32,050
We must go forward.

965
01:13:32,918 --> 01:13:34,920
I'll leave for you to conclude.

966
01:13:35,086 --> 01:13:36,521
As you wish.

967
01:13:37,255 --> 01:13:40,826
Even if you're just playing, I
imagined that it was a phase,

968
01:13:40,992 --> 01:13:43,762
in the background, you would
like something else.

969
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:48,133
What do I know?
"I am the jester Drake.

970
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:56,774
Yes?

971
01:13:57,174 --> 01:14:00,678
Fiona is Sean. Bobby is there?

972
01:14:01,445 --> 01:14:04,081
Hello. One minute.

973
01:14:10,454 --> 01:14:13,891
I'm sorry, Sean.
He does not see you.

974
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:15,892
Please.

975
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:18,862
Sorry. I'll call you later.

976
01:14:25,668 --> 01:14:29,973
I can not reapply for my job.
I was stupid to leave.

977
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:33,243
Anyway, it did not
please me more.

978
01:14:33,543 --> 01:14:36,212
- What do you want to do
- I do not know.

979
01:14:36,846 --> 01:14:37,881
You think?

980
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:42,519
You have always asked this
question to everyone.

981
01:14:43,085 --> 01:14:45,454
I know you've struggled
after college,

982
01:14:45,654 --> 01:14:48,957
but you have to think about
what you want to do.

983
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:50,325
Try.

984
01:14:50,859 --> 01:14:53,662
When I change something,
it falls into the water.

985
01:14:53,962 --> 01:14:56,765
I am not bogged in
a job I dislike.

986
01:14:57,065 --> 01:14:58,734
I do not know what to say.

987
01:14:59,735 --> 01:15:02,804
And nobody wants me. Damn!

988
01:15:04,273 --> 01:15:05,607
You might be right.

989
01:15:06,842 --> 01:15:07,876
How?

990
01:15:08,176 --> 01:15:12,548
Do not make an effort,
flush, it's easier.

991
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:17,485
- You make me really swollen.
- What?

992
01:15:17,752 --> 01:15:20,521
You are wasting all because
you do not think.

993
01:15:20,988 --> 01:15:24,158
When things do not work,
you just cry,

994
01:15:24,593 --> 01:15:27,129
and you want us to bring
you all the answers.

995
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:29,664
Life is not so hard as that.

996
01:15:30,665 --> 01:15:32,366
You're a big boy.

997
01:15:32,733 --> 01:15:34,535
Behave yourself as an adult.

998
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:36,571
I have an answer for you.

999
01:15:36,938 --> 01:15:38,039
You will not go anywhere

1000
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:42,743
because you spend your life playing
the loser and do anything.

1001
01:15:47,013 --> 01:15:51,251
And loose the nickname
"TC" is stupid.

1002
01:15:54,054 --> 01:15:55,355
Sorry.

1003
01:16:06,533 --> 01:16:08,735
The guys coming tonight?

1004
01:16:09,468 --> 01:16:12,104
No, I do not think they deserve.

1005
01:16:12,338 --> 01:16:14,039
What happened?

1006
01:16:14,373 --> 01:16:17,576
Sean and Bobby broke apparently.

1007
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:20,512
Sean has deceived imagine.

1008
01:16:20,947 --> 01:16:22,916
- With whom?
- No idea.

1009
01:16:25,217 --> 01:16:28,520
And the others were shouted at.
Too bad.

1010
01:16:28,821 --> 01:16:30,756
What did you do?

1011
01:16:31,123 --> 01:16:33,058
Me? Nothing.

1012
01:16:34,293 --> 01:16:36,662
Relationships do not last.

1013
01:16:41,532 --> 01:16:42,800
You see this guy?

1014
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:47,972
I'm going to do at home.

1015
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,375
At all.

1016
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:53,978
Is ...

1017
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:38,779
I will forget that you've
been very stupid lately.

1018
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:40,748
Nice to see you, too.

1019
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:44,486
I need your help.
This is important.

1020
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:45,754
What it is?

1021
01:18:46,053 --> 01:18:48,255
We have to do this evening.

1022
01:18:48,889 --> 01:18:50,390
Us.

1023
01:18:52,092 --> 01:18:53,093
Good.

1024
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:56,029
What can I do?

1025
01:19:03,336 --> 01:19:06,606
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for calling.

1026
01:19:10,778 --> 01:19:12,412
I would not have told you that.

1027
01:19:12,646 --> 01:19:15,215
You have said many true things.

1028
01:19:15,715 --> 01:19:18,851
I need to center myself.
And I will.

1029
01:19:20,286 --> 01:19:23,122
You could take more than
gloves, but ...

1030
01:19:25,224 --> 01:19:26,959
You're not a loser.

1031
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,496
You're one of my best friends.

1032
01:19:38,738 --> 01:19:40,306
- Listen ...
- Wait.

1033
01:19:42,874 --> 01:19:46,178
I did not talk like that.

1034
01:19:46,812 --> 01:19:50,882
And I never take lightly
what happened to you.

1035
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:52,918
ever.

1036
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,855
I know.

1037
01:20:03,294 --> 01:20:05,830
Well, we had to cut out.

1038
01:20:07,966 --> 01:20:11,436
I do not know, I'm not ready.

1039
01:20:12,536 --> 01:20:15,506
It is fair to remind the guests

1040
01:20:16,006 --> 01:20:17,775
and a time to come.

1041
01:20:18,075 --> 01:20:20,044
We take care of everything else.

1042
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:22,213
It was Robert and Owen.

1043
01:20:22,713 --> 01:20:25,649
Thanks to them we
became friends.

1044
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:30,720
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you.

1045
01:20:37,161 --> 01:20:38,529
And another thing ...

1046
01:20:40,296 --> 01:20:42,131
You could talk to Sean.

1047
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:46,135
- He who sent you?
- You know me better than that.

1048
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,570
That comes from us.

1049
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:55,011
You have every right to be angry
but at least listen to it.

1050
01:20:55,777 --> 01:20:57,012
The ...

1051
01:20:58,247 --> 01:21:02,351
It was you who said he should
be given a second chance?

1052
01:21:02,852 --> 01:21:04,454
"You take it and throw"?

1053
01:21:06,122 --> 01:21:08,524
I appreciate you both very much,

1054
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:13,295
and I do not see you make
stupid mistakes.

1055
01:21:14,429 --> 01:21:17,199
- No matter who started it.
- We do not forgive everything.

1056
01:21:17,432 --> 01:21:21,503
Bobby, I know Sean has long been

1057
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:24,772
and he is happy with you.

1058
01:21:25,539 --> 01:21:27,875
He loves you, really.

1059
01:21:29,645 --> 01:21:32,614
You can not imagine
how painful it is.

1060
01:21:33,081 --> 01:21:36,585
If you can not forgive,
it's your choice.

1061
01:21:37,418 --> 01:21:40,254
But it is better that
thou mayest be sure,

1062
01:21:41,555 --> 01:21:44,926
because when it's over,
it's really over.

1063
01:22:00,508 --> 01:22:03,477
I thought about what you said.

1064
01:22:07,414 --> 01:22:08,848
You're right.

1065
01:22:10,917 --> 01:22:13,720
I am unable to move forward.

1066
01:22:17,691 --> 01:22:19,492
I do not know why.

1067
01:22:23,395 --> 01:22:25,531
I felt safer that way.

1068
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:28,368
I know what you mean.

1069
01:22:29,836 --> 01:22:33,006
It may be time to move.

1070
01:22:33,772 --> 01:22:35,307
So, here we go.

1071
01:22:37,843 --> 01:22:41,447
He does not want to see
me, talk to me ...

1072
01:22:43,449 --> 01:22:45,451
I think it's really over.

1073
01:22:45,684 --> 01:22:50,823
- Why did you do that?
- This is the problem.
I do not know.

1074
01:22:54,126 --> 01:22:56,929
I asked myself a thousand
questions ...

1075
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:00,666
Now it has no meaning.

1076
01:23:04,669 --> 01:23:07,338
Bobby wanted the best
for us both.

1077
01:23:09,307 --> 01:23:11,509
I can not lose.

1078
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,779
So do not lose it.

1079
01:23:23,354 --> 01:23:24,222
Bobby.

1080
01:23:25,523 --> 01:23:27,592
Please do not leave.

1081
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:29,360
I'm sorry.

1082
01:23:30,394 --> 01:23:33,897
I know I ruined everything,
I'm an idiot finished

1083
01:23:34,398 --> 01:23:36,833
and I know that I
deserve nothing,

1084
01:23:37,534 --> 01:23:39,870
but let me explain.

1085
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:43,673
I'd do anything for it to break.

1086
01:23:44,073 --> 01:23:45,541
I love you so much ...

1087
01:23:47,309 --> 01:23:49,345
Bobby, please.

1088
01:23:52,482 --> 01:23:53,450
Please.

1089
01:25:26,772 --> 01:25:29,275
He is meeting. Can I leave ...

1090
01:25:29,408 --> 01:25:30,343
What a surprise!

1091
01:25:34,113 --> 01:25:35,281
How are you?

1092
01:25:39,684 --> 01:25:42,420
- I was miserable.
- I know.

1093
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:44,390
I'm sorry.

1094
01:25:46,292 --> 01:25:46,959
And then?

1095
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:54,033
If you're not too upset, you could do
what you were talking about dinner.

1096
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:59,104
Well, Des, the thing is that ...

1097
01:26:02,941 --> 01:26:05,477
you'll have to pay
for this dinner.

1098
01:26:06,844 --> 01:26:07,878
Okay.

1099
01:26:08,713 --> 01:26:10,515
And it'll cost you.

1100
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,084
Sure.

1101
01:26:17,556 --> 01:26:20,192
My God, Bobby ...

1102
01:26:27,031 --> 01:26:30,201
I really thought about
what happened.

1103
01:26:30,701 --> 01:26:34,705
You'd find it hard to see clearly,
and I've put the pressure.

1104
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,441
I could not help myself.

1105
01:26:39,543 --> 01:26:43,414
I so want to be moved together.

1106
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:48,018
I know. It scared me.

1107
01:26:48,352 --> 01:26:50,054
I should have seen.

1108
01:26:51,354 --> 01:26:52,956
But I want to do.

1109
01:26:54,424 --> 01:26:57,093
Having the apartment
and everything.

1110
01:27:00,129 --> 01:27:04,267
But above all, I want
you, forever.

1111
01:27:15,278 --> 01:27:17,981
You'd better not forget it.

1112
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:24,653
Otherwise

1113
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:30,792
it's me who remember
the kicking ass.

1114
01:27:31,326 --> 01:27:34,029
Really? Forget what?

1115
01:27:49,844 --> 01:27:51,379
What you need to pick?

1116
01:27:51,712 --> 01:27:55,116
I forgot my jacket the other night.
I recovered and went outside.

1117
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:57,418
It's nice to bring us dinner.

1118
01:27:57,585 --> 01:28:00,621
It had to do something.
You could not stay
alone tonight.

1119
01:28:01,222 --> 01:28:03,658
Go. He left the door open.

1120
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:10,197
Happy Birthday!

1121
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:14,902
I hope it did not spoil
your evening.

1122
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:18,905
Sorry for this story.

1123
01:28:19,205 --> 01:28:21,308
Forget. Bobby and you ...

1124
01:28:25,912 --> 01:28:27,814
I'm happy for you.

1125
01:28:28,381 --> 01:28:31,451
And here Louis. My boyfriend.

1126
01:28:31,785 --> 01:28:34,788
- Nice.
- Nice.

1127
01:28:35,221 --> 01:28:38,358
- It is adorable.
- And it's fun to read.

1128
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:40,994
- I hear you.
- I know.

1129
01:28:41,294 --> 01:28:43,463
Good job.

1130
01:28:43,796 --> 01:28:45,597
You've done quickly.

1131
01:28:45,764 --> 01:28:48,300
- We broke the back.
- We ran everywhere.

1132
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,036
They are so happy.
Thanks for everything, guys.

1133
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:55,941
- It's when you want.
- Or not. It was no picnic.

1134
01:28:58,110 --> 01:28:59,712
Welcome to real life.

1135
01:29:20,932 --> 01:29:23,334
- They are cute, no?
- Yes.

1136
01:29:23,735 --> 01:29:26,437
- I hunger.
- Me too, let's go.

1137
01:29:27,305 --> 01:29:28,373
I'm coming.

1138
01:29:31,509 --> 01:29:32,210
Hullo?

1139
01:29:32,643 --> 01:29:35,847
- What's new?
- Hi, Drake.

1140
01:29:37,281 --> 01:29:38,950
You're at a party?

1141
01:29:39,617 --> 01:29:41,552
Yes, in Desmond.

1142
01:29:42,519 --> 01:29:44,454
And we do not invite me!

1143
01:29:44,788 --> 01:29:47,023
No problem, we have a
better plan tonight.

1144
01:29:48,024 --> 01:29:48,825
Impossible.

1145
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:51,628
I misheard.

1146
01:29:52,396 --> 01:29:55,098
- I came to this party.
- Well, be off.

1147
01:29:55,465 --> 01:29:57,067
I do not think so.

1148
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:00,537
- Adam is there too?
- Yes, but ...

1149
01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:01,805
I'm coming.

1150
01:30:03,173 --> 01:30:04,474
No, Drake ...

1151
01:30:43,378 --> 01:30:45,547
Okay. I'll get him out of here.

1152
01:30:46,581 --> 01:30:47,849
Are you crazy?

1153
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:51,486
- I just get my mates.
- I will tell them
that you're down.

1154
01:30:51,953 --> 01:30:54,022
- I'll do it myself.
- Go away.

1155
01:30:54,355 --> 01:30:55,290
Now.

1156
01:30:57,358 --> 01:31:01,830
Adam Wayne, here we go.
We have a better evening ahead.

1157
01:31:03,131 --> 01:31:03,898
Let's go.

1158
01:31:04,332 --> 01:31:05,266
Go, you.

1159
01:31:09,369 --> 01:31:10,671
We need to talk.

1160
01:31:10,938 --> 01:31:12,372
No, Drake.

1161
01:31:14,508 --> 01:31:15,242
That's it.

1162
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,514
Fuck you!

1163
01:31:21,148 --> 01:31:22,282
You're no better than Kyle.

1164
01:31:25,385 --> 01:31:27,588
You're a bunch of morons.

1165
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:33,327
You suppliiez to me we have fun.

1166
01:31:33,694 --> 01:31:35,362
Things change.

1167
01:32:12,697 --> 01:32:14,599
- Everything all right?
- Now, yes.

1168
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:17,603
Renee, I introduce
you to someone.

1169
01:32:17,903 --> 01:32:21,306
A new gay dude!
Where you go, this one?

1170
01:32:21,773 --> 01:32:25,010
My friend hetero, Jeremy.
He just moved to town.

1171
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:27,145
It seeks someone to
show him around.

1172
01:32:29,114 --> 01:32:31,283
Thank you not to Thee away.

1173
01:32:31,715 --> 01:32:33,250
I was not far.

1174
01:32:34,251 --> 01:32:35,653
What nerve!

1175
01:32:38,756 --> 01:32:41,859
You think you will like Robert
Owen and one day?

1176
01:32:42,327 --> 01:32:45,330
No, we do casera that much.

1177
01:32:47,331 --> 01:32:48,566
You never know.

1178
01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:00,844
And Renee and Jeremy?

1179
01:33:01,044 --> 01:33:04,147
- It is too much.
- It had to attach it to bed.

1180
01:33:04,347 --> 01:33:06,349
I hope she feeds at least.

1181
01:33:06,849 --> 01:33:09,385
You've seen the eyes
of Robert and Owen?

1182
01:33:09,787 --> 01:33:11,522
They were amazed.

1183
01:33:12,189 --> 01:33:14,625
I want to be like them one day.

1184
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:16,025
Yeah.

1185
01:33:18,995 --> 01:33:20,964
What was really cool ...

1186
01:33:21,431 --> 01:33:23,933
Your decision to
do this evening.

1187
01:33:24,567 --> 01:33:28,037
You've handled everything.
You've impressed.

1188
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:32,407
Yes.
Well done JD ... I mean, TC.

1189
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:35,644
In this connection,

1190
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:39,449
I would like you to
call me by my name.

1191
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:41,884
Thank you God!
JD is much better.

1192
01:33:42,285 --> 01:33:44,454
No, I mean my real name.

1193
01:33:46,088 --> 01:33:50,125
It will sound terrible,
but what's your name?

1194
01:33:52,527 --> 01:33:53,695
Henry.

1195
01:33:55,063 --> 01:33:56,098
Henry.

1196
01:33:57,231 --> 01:34:00,368
I will time to get used
to, but agree.

1197
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:01,802
Why?

1198
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:06,207
I must think what is
important to me

1199
01:34:06,742 --> 01:34:08,677
what is true in my life.

1200
01:34:09,111 --> 01:34:11,480
And I always come back to you.

1201
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:16,283
You are my family.

1202
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:20,454
I do not want to see anything
wrong between us.

1203
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:26,093
I love you a lot, really.

1204
01:34:28,862 --> 01:34:29,796
We.

1205
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:33,768
Absolutely.

1206
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:40,007
Health.

1207
01:34:50,183 --> 01:34:51,818
- And a good appetite.
- Well said.

1208
01:34:52,018 --> 01:34:53,086
I slab.

1209
01:34:53,852 --> 01:34:56,955
I must tell you what made
Louis the other day.

1210
01:34:58,424 --> 01:35:01,093
It was with me, and like much,

1211
01:35:01,861 --> 01:35:03,363
he pulled out a camcorder.

1212
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:07,567
He looked at me and said: "You
want to make a movie?"

1213
01:35:07,801 --> 01:35:10,737
- That's it.
- I was so surprised

1214
01:35:11,103 --> 01:35:12,805
he is so cute ...

1215
01:35:14,973 --> 01:35:18,010
I looked and I told him:
"Come on, do it."
