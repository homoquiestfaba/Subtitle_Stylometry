1
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,434
<i>Well, when you take a look
at the number of boys</i>

2
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,059
<i>who were hospitalized every year</i>

3
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,167
<i>because they deliberately
harmed themselves,</i>

4
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,143
<i>you'll notice that the numbers
stay relatively the same</i>

5
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:16,684
<i>until the last decade or so</i>

6
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,768
<i>when there was a sudden,
sharp increase.</i>

7
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:20,332
<i>And it's getting even worse.</i>

8
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,934
<i>So, what's causing this?</i>

9
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,143
<i>There's no way of knowing for sure,</i>

10
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:48,434
<i>but it happens to coincide
with the rise of social media</i>

11
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,476
<i>and an increase in screen time
among young people.</i>

12
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,875
<i>So, technology will certainly be...</i>

13
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,351
<i>Out of your child's bedroom</i>

14
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,518
<i>for at least an hour
before their bedtime.</i>

15
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:30,476
<i>There's no reason a child should have
a tablet or a laptop,</i>

16
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,226
<i>or any other thing
for that matter,</i>

17
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,332
<i>in their bedroom
after a certain time.</i>

18
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,792
Baby, put the knife down.

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,583
Put the knife down, Brandon.

20
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,184
You don't wanna do this, baby.

21
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,408
You don't, you don't wanna
hurt yourself again. Come on.

22
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,708
Just put the knife down.

23
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,002
<i>Sometimes it doesn't seem fair.</i>

24
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:15,458
<i>The world is such a beautiful place.</i>

25
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,917
<i>But we're so filled with stress
and anxiety most of the time,</i>

26
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,458
<i>we don't even get to enjoy it.</i>

27
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,601
<i>But I figured out a way</i>

28
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,184
<i>to take the things
that give you stress</i>

29
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,167
<i>and turn them
into something beautiful.</i>

30
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,583
<i>That's what I wanted
to show you guys.</i>

31
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:42,351
<i>First, make a list
of all the things</i>

32
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,625
<i>that give you stress,</i>

33
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,667
<i>and then for each item,</i>

34
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,958
<i>find an object
that represents that,</i>

35
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,250
<i>something you don't need anymore.</i>

36
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,458
<i>If you're feeling pressure,</i>

37
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,750
<i>like,</i>

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,542
maybe you're feeling pressure
to succeed or whatever,

39
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,018
you can find something
that represents that.

40
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,583
Maybe you feel like
no one listens to you.

41
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,851
For that, I've just got
these old headphones

42
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,167
that don't work anymore.

43
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,417
One you have all your items,

44
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,208
we can take them,

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,684
and use them to create relaxing sounds

46
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,417
and images, like so.

47
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,750
Asha, we're leaving in five!

48
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:07,393
Okay, one more, but no faces.

49
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:08,809
Alright. Okay.

50
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,518
Alright, one, two, three.

51
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,750
Aww, that's so sweet.

52
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,667
Hey, I'm proud of you, kiddo.

53
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,351
Ah-ha! There she is.

54
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,958
Alright,

55
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,851
phones on the table, everyone.

56
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:24,893
Let's go.

57
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,434
Wait, we're seriously
still doing this?

58
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,976
Well, we have one
phone-free outing per week.

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,309
We haven't had one
this week, so...

60
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,684
dad, I swear we're
the only family that does this.

61
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,851
- Oh, really?
- You know who else does it?

62
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,268
The people that invented
the technology and the apps

63
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,667
that we're all so addicted to.

64
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,393
But I'm not addicted.

65
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,337
Well, then this shouldn't be
a problem for you.

66
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:46,351
Let's just... honey, let's just
get it over with, okay?

67
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,018
Come on, let's go, out the door.

68
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,643
Let's go.
Thank you very much.

69
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,907
Your phones will be here
waiting for you when you return.

70
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,417
- He's really good.
- I know.

71
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,787
Other guys look like they're
in high school, though.

72
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:18,976
- They are. Yeah, yeah.
- Whoa.

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,400
They wanted to play with him
after he won that competition.

74
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,976
I mean, kamran might
as well be in high school.

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,476
His scores are high enough.

76
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,477
He's a great kid.

77
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:27,781
- Good for him.
- Mm-hm.

78
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:43,292
Oh.

79
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,375
There they go.

80
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,125
Don't stress about it, Leah.

81
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,792
Our daughters'
attention spans are shot.

82
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,083
We just have to accept that.

83
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,726
- Are you mad at me?
- What?

84
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,893
No, why would I be mad?

85
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,957
I sent you, like, five texts
and didn't hear back.

86
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,059
Sorry, I'm on
a "phone-free outing."

87
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,018
God, not again.

88
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:10,922
Well, whatever.
At least I've got mine. Come on.

89
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:12,976
Ever since I quit,

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,893
they've been doubling down
on the anti-phone thing.

91
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,768
It's, like, all I did was
quit the track team,

92
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,184
but the way they're reacting,

93
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,726
it's like I, I shaved my head
and joined a cult or something.

94
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,667
Well, at least then you'd be doing
an extracurricular activity.

95
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,518
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- It's fine.

96
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,208
I'm addicted to this
local news app thing.

97
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,476
There's something going around, man.

98
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,184
These two kids in town
cut themselves apparently

99
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,958
because of some Internet challenge.

100
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,810
Cut themselves?

101
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:51,309
Yeah, it's like this, um,
scary character that pops up

102
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,726
and tells you to do stuff
like cut yourself,

103
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,792
kill yourself,
or hurt other people.

104
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:02,143
It even made this kid
stab his own mother.

105
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,499
- What?
- Yeah.

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,976
Why would they just do
whatever the thing tells them to?

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,125
I don't know, I mean,

108
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:18,018
if it's trendy, Amir,
kids will do just about anything.

109
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,500
- Boys!
- Sorry.

110
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,125
Sorry.

111
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,000
Thirteen views.

112
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,851
I'm up one view, but that's still
10 down from my last video.

113
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:33,958
Let me see.

114
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't know,

115
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,542
maybe I'm just not
influencer material.

116
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,958
Don't give up.

117
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,268
First of all, you need
a way better thumbnail.

118
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,625
This one does not make me
wanna click on it at all.

119
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,625
Oh, hey, you got a comment.

120
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,917
"Wow." who's Cassidy johns ton?

121
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,643
Oh no, this is not good.

122
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,059
Wait, d-do you know her?

123
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,542
I know that she's, like, evil.

124
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,101
What do you mean "evil"?

125
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,268
You know, creepy.

126
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:04,012
Like, you don't want
to get on her bad side.

127
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,476
But she liked it. She said, "wow."

128
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,809
Asha, nobody says "wow"
in a good way anymore.

129
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,750
People only say "wow" if it's like,

130
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,684
"wow, really?"

131
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,684
There must've been something
in the video that offended her.

132
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,108
- What? No!
- I don't even know her.

133
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,458
What? I don't even know her!

134
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,268
- Hey, Mr. Chaudhry.
- Hi, em.

135
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,542
Uh, we were just headed back inside.

136
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,375
See you in there.

137
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,601
It's another phone-free outing
down the drain, I guess.

138
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,333
We were just looking
at my video.

139
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,417
She's helping me get
more traffic to my channel.

140
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,833
Is that all it was?

141
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,375
Yeah.

142
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,684
Look, asha, I, um, I know, okay?

143
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,476
I know this all seems really silly,

144
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,625
all the phone-free outings,
whatever, it's just,

145
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,768
these are supposed to be some
of the best years of your life, okay?

146
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:14,583
And I... just don't wanna
see you waste it is all.

147
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,417
I don't feel like I'm wasting it.

148
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:22,059
Running in circles for hours
every day after class

149
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,226
until I'm too exhausted
to do anything else,

150
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,250
that's wasting it.

151
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Okay. I mean, like,

152
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,512
I feel like there's
a whole world out there.

153
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,625
I know, and that's...

154
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,601
I mean, that is what I've been
trying to get you to see.

155
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,625
I...

156
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,101
Okay.

157
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,875
Look, we should, um, we should
get back inside, come on.

158
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,101
<i>I'm at 30 health right now,</i>

159
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,525
<i>getting full shield would be ideal.</i>

160
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:54,667
Contact northwest.

161
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,000
Uh, popping minis.

162
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,125
Uh, yeah.

163
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:07,833
I'd like that a lot.

164
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,542
I see his teammate.

165
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,750
Engaging.

166
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,208
Finish. Alright.

167
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:15,875
Hello?

168
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,643
Asha?

169
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,059
Could you come upstairs for a second?

170
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,803
We need to talk to you guys
about something.

171
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,875
He looks like this.

172
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,976
Wait, what is it called again?

173
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,559
Grimcutty. You sure
you haven't seen it before?

174
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,435
What is it?

175
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:51,601
It's, um, some kind
of sick online challenge

176
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,333
that tells you to do stuff like,

177
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,542
I don't know, cut yourself,
choke yourself,

178
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,809
even kill yourself.

179
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,559
Tells us to do stuff how?

180
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,519
We're not sure exactly.

181
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:02,559
You know, it could pop up
in the middle of a video,

182
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,434
or be a link that you click on,
or even personal messages.

183
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,833
The point is
is that it's working, okay?

184
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,101
Couple of local kids already
cut themselves because of it.

185
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,875
It even made one kid stab his mom.

186
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,643
Maybe it's like subliminal messages
that flash so fast

187
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,893
you don't even know you saw 'em,
like mk ultra!

188
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,143
Kamran, we're being serious
right now, honey.

189
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,019
- Yeah.
- I don't get it.

190
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,559
Why would anyone do that, though?

191
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,351
- On a dare, maybe.
- You know, or to get attention.

192
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,476
You think we're gonna
cut ourselves for attention?

193
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,976
Well, you wouldn't think
that somebody would lick

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,101
an armrest on an airplane

195
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,476
or climb a tower of milk crates
to get attention,

196
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,310
but they did that.

197
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,434
Okay, well, we didn't.

198
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,268
- We know that.
- Yeah.

199
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,792
I'm... look, all we're saying is that

200
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,643
we just want you guys
to be aware of it, okay?

201
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:45,184
We know that you like
to look at stuff online.

202
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,833
We're gonna respect your privacy.

203
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,417
Just... please don't do
anything stupid, okay?

204
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,601
Dad, I think you can relax.

205
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,208
We're not gonna stab you.

206
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,601
<i>If someone has a link
to the grimcutty challenge</i>

207
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,309
<i>will you please post it?</i>

208
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,207
<i>I will pay money.</i>

209
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,518
We're just overreacting, right, honey?

210
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:50,059
I mean, she's...
Asha's into weird stuff,

211
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,917
but she's not crazy enough
to do something like that, right?

212
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,875
Sure.

213
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,625
What the fuck?

214
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,875
What is it?

215
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:06,287
Linda said Karen and Phil just caught
Madison in the hallway cutting herself.

216
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:07,792
Because of grimcutty?

217
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,625
Didn't say.

218
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,268
- Okay, I don't... I mean, this just...
- It can't, it can't be, uh...

219
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,292
This just...

220
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,351
You know,
we should do more research.

221
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,333
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's...

222
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,083
Just, uh...

223
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,957
<i>But they're very, very soft.</i>

224
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,917
- Jesus.
- Dad!

225
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,082
- What?
- Dad!

226
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,351
There's, there's someone in the house!
There's someone in the house!

227
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,976
We... are you alright?

228
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,042
It was right there.

229
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,417
He was tall.

230
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,333
Like, really, really tall.
And, um,

231
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:29,458
he was wearing black, like,
I, I wanna say leather.

232
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:35,101
But, um... his hands were, like, huge.

233
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:39,559
And... his face,
he had, like, big red eyes.

234
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,750
Kinda like this?

235
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,893
Yeah. Like, like that.

236
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,309
Thought so.

237
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,053
We've been getting calls
about it all night.

238
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,434
Okay, then somebody
dressed up as grimcutty

239
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,667
is playing a prank on me.

240
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:53,518
Is that possible?

241
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,143
If that's the case,
it'd have to be a group of people.

242
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,351
One guy couldn't move around that fast.

243
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,893
What did I see, then?

244
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,101
I mean, you're the cop.

245
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,125
Asha.

246
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,500
You remember what you were
doing right before you saw it?

247
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:07,917
I was making toast

248
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,083
and watching a video on my phone.

249
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,247
Do you mind if I talk
to your parents for a minute?

250
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,434
I'm having a really hard time buying

251
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,851
that there's some person out there

252
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,601
making these kids...

253
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,226
- but why?
- Why, why would they lie?

254
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,768
Why would they make this up?

255
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,726
Maybe it's telling them to lie.

256
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,500
Like, as part of the challenge.

257
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,351
There's still a lot
we don't know about it.

258
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,500
Well, thank you.

259
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:42,684
Okay, I'll show you out.

260
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,188
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

261
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:55,958
What?

262
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,178
You better let me
hold on to that for now.

263
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,809
- What for?
- Dad, what are you doing?

264
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,268
Just a precaution until we figure out
what the heck is going on.

265
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,476
Dad, stop it!

266
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,226
You don't seriously think
I'm making this up

267
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,434
because of some online challenge?

268
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,708
- Asha, let go.
- Dad, that's...

269
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,083
You're gonna get it back tomorrow.

270
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:19,875
We just need to sleep.

271
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,875
Okay? You should try
to get some sleep, too.

272
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,559
11, 12. I was...

273
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,625
Everything last night was just

274
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
a lot.

275
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,208
- Here she is.
- Why don't you come join us?

276
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,458
- You wanna start?
- Uh, uh, yes, sure.

277
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:21,476
Um, so, we've been doing these
phone-free outings for a while now, okay,

278
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,809
and you guys have been great.

279
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,309
But we just thought that, you know,
with everything that's been happening,

280
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,268
now might be a really great time

281
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:30,059
for us to up our game a little bit, okay?

282
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,958
So, we've got this new detox box...

283
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,184
I'm s... the what?

284
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,167
So, we take all of our devices,

285
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,851
we put 'em in there, we lock it up.

286
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,434
And then, in a week,
we see how we're feeling,

287
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,375
and we decide if we even
wanna keep going.

288
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,726
- I have so many questions.
- That's what we're here for.

289
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,602
Shoot uh huh.

290
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:52,250
Okay, how 'bout why?

291
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,083
Well, because, um,

292
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,684
clearly, these devices
are affecting you guys

293
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,768
in ways that we don't
entirely understand yet,

294
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:02,393
so really, we're just...

295
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,394
it's an experiment.

296
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:04,934
- Exactly.
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

297
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,518
I mean, it may not
make a difference at all,

298
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,667
but we won't know unless we try.

299
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,643
Can I go first, dad?

300
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,250
Yes, of course.

301
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,434
- Great job.
- Thanks, dad. Thanks, mom.

302
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,458
Alright, thank you.

303
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,167
Okay.

304
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,625
Please tell me this isn't
because of grimcutty.

305
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,434
Do you even know what
the grimcutty challenge is?

306
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,351
Or did you just see that photo
and hear a bunch of rumors about it?

307
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,226
'Cause, you know,
I'd really like to know.

308
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,184
Sweetie, all we know is that
ever since you quit track,

309
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,393
you have become more
and more withdrawn, okay?

310
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:49,184
And it's common
for depressed people to have...

311
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,559
but, but I'm not depressed!

312
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,893
Look, we have no idea
how these devices are affecting you,

313
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:54,143
but that is the whole point of this.

314
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:57,018
So, that you can reclaim your focus game.

315
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,101
And cut your screen time
in the meantime.

316
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,125
Yeah.

317
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,851
Okay, what did you guys smoke
while I was asleep?

318
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,643
- Look, we're all doing this, okay?
- Put your phone in the box.

319
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,667
No!

320
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,184
I'm not letting you guys blame this
on phones or anxiety or whatever.

321
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,601
I know what I saw.

322
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,809
It wasn't a hallucination.
It wasn't some guy in a costume.

323
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,768
It was a real thing.
It was huge and terrifying.

324
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,559
I need you guys to help me
figure out what it was!

325
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,601
- Enough, asha!
- Put your phone in the box!

326
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,708
Now!

327
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:29,601
- Asha, hey! Let go, asha.
- I just wanna call Emily.

328
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,143
- Asha, let go.
- Let go, asha.

329
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,333
- No, I'll give it back after, I promise!
- I just...

330
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,792
Shh.

331
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,333
I wanna use the laptop.

332
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,458
What laptop?

333
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,958
"Can I go first, dad?"

334
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,143
The golden boy act
doesn't work on me.

335
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:13,393
I know you have a backup.

336
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,500
Now give it to me.
Unless you want me to tell dad.

337
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,708
What are you gonna do with it?

338
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:28,583
I already spent hours looking.
You're not gonna find it.

339
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,809
- Like, what about message boards?
- Nobody posted a link to it?

340
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,268
No, there's a lot of people
freaking out about it,

341
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,250
but nobody knows
what it actually is.

342
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,250
What are you doing?

343
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,958
Where is everybody?

344
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,875
I already tried to Skype Zach.

345
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,375
They probably got
their stuff taken away, too.

346
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:56,250
Wait, what the hell?

347
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,851
Did you change the WiFi password?

348
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,375
I disconnected it.

349
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,060
- Do you think they know we're...
- Shh!

350
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,417
What are you gonna do?

351
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,625
<i>Ashmsauce229.</i>

352
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,417
- Hi.
<i>- Saw your message.</i>

353
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,309
<i>I was worried I was the only one left
that still had a phone.</i>

354
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,851
- No, I just, I just got mine back.
- How do you still have yours?

355
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,059
<i>My parents aren't on
the grimcutty freakout train yet.</i>

356
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,726
<i>But I'm not gonna give up my phone.</i>

357
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,917
<i>They can't just take our phones away.
That's fascist.</i>

358
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,684
<i>We'll go to the police if we have to.</i>

359
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,893
No, um, I don't think that's gonna work.

360
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:20,018
They didn't believe me
any more than my parents did.

361
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,375
<i>Wh-what do you mean?</i>

362
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,667
<i>You saw the grimcutty?</i>

363
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,809
I think so.

364
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,976
<i>- Well, what is it?
- Wait, can you send me the link?</i>

365
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,768
<i>You're the first person I've found
that's actually seen it.</i>

366
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:32,934
No, I mean, like, I saw it,
or something like it,

367
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:35,333
like, in, in real life, in my house.

368
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,416
<i>Okay, that's new.</i>

369
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,417
What?

370
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:00,667
I thought I heard something.

371
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,583
<i>What are you doing?</i>

372
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,726
I can't really talk right now.

373
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,351
<i>Well, whatever. Just stay on the line.</i>

374
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,000
<i>I think I might've found someone else.</i>

375
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,393
<i>Gonna try to add them.</i>

376
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,417
<i>Hold on.</i>

377
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,684
<i>Did you guys hear about Nathan?</i>

378
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,893
<i>Who?</i>

379
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,750
<i>Nathan childers cut himself,
apparently 'cause of grimcutty.</i>

380
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:56,809
<i>And Hannah's little brother
cut himself, too.</i>

381
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:00,143
<i>It's no joke.
It's really making people do stuff.</i>

382
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,875
<i>Well, asha here has seen it.</i>

383
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:04,518
<i>You did? Can you send me the link?</i>

384
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,792
<i>No, she saw, like, a ghost or something.</i>

385
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,268
I don't know what I saw, okay?

386
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,976
The point is it's not online.

387
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,684
My parents keep saying
some online challenge,

388
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,417
but all I've seen is that stupid picture.

389
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,167
<i>Well, the hysteria about it
sure spread fast.</i>

390
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,374
<i>Heard some parents are even
pulling their kids out of school.</i>

391
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,667
Hold on a second, you guys.

392
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:32,417
Sorry, didn't mean
to interrupt your reading.

393
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,917
Oh, it's okay. What's up?

394
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,500
We wanna talk to you
about something.

395
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,726
Can you come downstairs
for a minute?

396
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,750
I'll be right down.

397
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:51,143
I gotta go. I think I'm about
to get the grimcutty talk.

398
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,601
<i>I have to go, too.</i>

399
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,625
<i>Alright.</i>

400
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,601
<i>Listen, no matter what,</i>

401
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:59,268
<i>don't let your parents keep you home
from school tomorrow.</i>

402
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,809
<i>Tell them that you have a test.</i>

403
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:04,667
<i>Tell them that you love
learning, whatever. Just...</i>

404
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,417
<i>We'll meet up there.</i>

405
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:07,833
<i>Okay.</i>

406
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,059
Hey, did you find her?

407
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,583
- No, did you?
- No.

408
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:15,332
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Asha, asha, asha!

409
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:20,625
It's okay.

410
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,333
Is she gonna need stitches?

411
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,458
I don't think so.

412
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,583
I didn't do this to myself.

413
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,434
We should probably
get it looked at, though.

414
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,833
I can bring her in the morning.

415
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,250
Eh, what about school?

416
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:50,958
Don't worry about it.

417
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:53,458
But I, I wanna go.

418
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:56,684
I have a test.

419
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,308
No, not until we get this figured out.

420
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,125
D-Do you even care
about my side of the story?

421
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:06,708
This was an accident.

422
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,059
I used the knife to pry open
the box to get my phone,

423
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:18,601
and then, I got really spooked
when I heard you guys coming

424
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:19,809
because of what happened last night.

425
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,851
And so, I ran downstairs,
and then I slammed the door

426
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,417
and then I accidentally cut myself.

427
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:27,542
That's it.

428
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,934
That's all. I didn't,
I didn't do it on purpose.

429
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:32,208
I didn't do it
'cause grimcutty told me to.

430
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:38,875
Okay, look, I don't, I don't know
what I saw last night.

431
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,333
But I just really want things
to go back to normal.

432
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,542
And I feel like going back to school
would really make me feel normal.

433
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,625
Please, I just...
I feel like school's the right...

434
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:54,708
Is the right place for me.

435
00:32:58,792 --> 00:32:59,727
Maybe she should go.

436
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:00,809
No, it's out of the question.

437
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:04,059
Okay, well, then do you wanna stay home
from work and watch her all day?

438
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:04,894
I can't...

439
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:06,601
She wants to go to school,
let her go to school.

440
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,851
She has supervision there.

441
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,875
Okay, well, then this is on you, alright?

442
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:13,583
- Can I talk to you upstairs for just...
- Why?

443
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,417
What did I do this time?

444
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,513
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

445
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,583
<i>As you can see,</i>

446
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:39,309
<i>some of you have chosen
to stay home today</i>

447
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,875
<i>given what's been happening.</i>

448
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:45,083
<i>Some of you have already talked
to your parents about it,</i>

449
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,333
<i>the rest of you probably will later.</i>

450
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:51,726
<i>But since we're here,
we want you to know</i>

451
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,059
<i>that this is a place where
you can be completely open</i>

452
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,458
<i>about... social media,</i>

453
00:33:58,292 --> 00:33:59,333
<i>bullying,</i>

454
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:00,833
<i>fomo,</i>

455
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:05,309
<i>these online challenges that are becoming
more and more dangerous...</i>

456
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,851
this is bullshit!

457
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:09,893
It's just a scary picture!
That's all that it is! It's just hype!

458
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:12,101
It's all bs!
We're not in any danger!

459
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,643
Oh my...

460
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:18,518
<i>okay, um, obviously
some intense emotions.</i>

461
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:22,917
<i>Which is why we're here,
to get everything out into the open.</i>

462
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,018
<i>Now, we are gonna take questions later,
but before we get into that,</i>

463
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:30,809
<i>uh, we have managed to get
a very special guest,</i>

464
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,809
<i>who I think can shed some light,
and some humor,</i>

465
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,434
<i>on this situation,</i>

466
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:38,542
<i>which I think we could all use.</i>

467
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,851
<i>He travels across the country
talking to teens</i>

468
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:45,393
<i>about the ups and downs of social media.</i>

469
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,476
<i>Please give a hand
for Dave bagliardi!</i>

470
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,125
<i>Woo! Alright, how we all
doin' this morning?!</i>

471
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,809
<i>Okay, okay. I get it. I get it.</i>

472
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,518
<i>It's early. I know how it is.</i>

473
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:59,518
<i>You haven't had your Starbucks yet.
I feel you. Boy, do I feel you.</i>

474
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:02,893
<i>But I think we can do
a little bit better than that.</i>

475
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:05,666
<i>So, how y'all doin' this morning?</i>

476
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,101
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

477
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,500
<i>Not bad, not bad.
I can work with that.</i>

478
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,018
<i>Good morning, everyone.
It's good to see you.</i>

479
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,559
<i>As your lovely principal mentioned,</i>

480
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,184
<i>my name is Dave bagliardi.</i>

481
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,351
<i>And before we get started here today,</i>

482
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,934
<i>I wanna tell you all a little story.</i>

483
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:23,101
<i>Wayyy back when
when I was in high school,</i>

484
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,393
<i>things were a lot different.</i>

485
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,684
<i>And I know you're
probably asking yourself,</i>

486
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,268
<i>"what does this old geezer know</i>

487
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:31,833
<i>about anything that is
going on with me, right?"</i>

488
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,226
Hey, is your friend coming?

489
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,726
Kay didn't make it.

490
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,143
None of my friends did.

491
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,101
- Do you still have your phone?
- No.

492
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,934
My parents got to me
after you hung up.

493
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,434
They made me put it
in a "detox box."

494
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,226
My parents said the same thing.

495
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,184
- They used that exact term?
- Yeah.

496
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,601
They said it was
to "reclaim my focus game

497
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,785
- and cut my screen time in the meantime."
- "Your screen time in the meantime."

498
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,351
Where are they getting this?

499
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,643
It's like they're reading
from the same script.

500
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,667
I don't know. It's weird.

501
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,167
Do I even wanna know?

502
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,583
Unless you've seen it,
I doubt you'll believe me.

503
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:14,375
Well, I haven't, but

504
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:17,667
I just wanna know what's
brainwashing my parents.

505
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,018
And I want my phone back.

506
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:21,583
I can't fall asleep without Bob Ross.

507
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:23,917
Me neither.

508
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:31,083
Alright then, as hm sauce.

509
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
What do we do first?

510
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,309
If I could just use the Internet
for, like, five seconds.

511
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,476
What about the computers
in the library?

512
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,042
Disconnected. I already checked.

513
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,333
Um.

514
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,917
Alright.

515
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,875
I know someone who will
definitely let us use their computer.

516
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,375
Come on.

517
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,583
I'll drive.

518
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,768
- Whose house is this again?
- This rich kid, Oliver.

519
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,292
Heard he was having a ditch party.

520
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,309
Looks like I was right.

521
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:04,583
Won't his parents be home?

522
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:07,976
Fuck no. They work in, like,
international shipping or something,

523
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,393
and they're hardly ever home.

524
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:10,917
Practically lives by himself.

525
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,000
Were you even invited?

526
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,375
We're girls. I don't think
he'll care how we got here.

527
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,726
Besides, he's a really big fan
of your channel.

528
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,352
What?!

529
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:24,792
Yeah, he's the one who told me about it.

530
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,708
I'm kidding!

531
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,351
You know, for someone
who makes asmr videos,

532
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,458
you're a little tense.

533
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,518
Hey, Oliver.

534
00:37:55,542 --> 00:38:00,143
- Hey, Cassidy! Hey... you guys.
- Come in. Come in. Come in.

535
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:02,101
Help yourself to whatever.

536
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:05,643
Actually, do you have a laptop
that we could use?

537
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:08,393
Uh, the WiFi password is
on the wall in there.

538
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:10,417
We...

539
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,958
We don't have phones.

540
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,958
Oh shit! 'Cause of grimcutty?

541
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:26,792
Wow, that is... fascist.
Uh... yeah, sure.

542
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,292
Come on, you can use mine.

543
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,309
So, your parents got
the grimcutty hysteria, huh?

544
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,434
I feel for you, man,
but we don't care about that here.

545
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:39,184
I don't suppose you know
what the grimcutty actually is?

546
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,393
What do you mean?

547
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:43,268
I mean what it is that's
making people cut themselves.

548
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:46,226
Is it just some asshole sending people
messages on whatsapp?

549
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,351
Look all I know is it's the reason

550
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,143
we don't have to go to school
if we don't want to,

551
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,851
so that is what we're celebrating.

552
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,708
Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea.

553
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,417
Everyone,

554
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,250
take out your knives!

555
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:58,769
When I hit record,

556
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:00,976
I want everyone
to start, uh, pretending

557
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,720
like they're brainwashed
by grimcutty, okay?

558
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:06,059
Three, two, one.

559
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:09,934
- Gah!
- Grimcutty. Grimcutty.

560
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:13,749
Grimcutty!

561
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:20,684
Aren't your parents gonna see that?

562
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,374
- My parents? No.
- They're in Morocco or something.

563
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Just boot it up
for you real quick.

564
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:34,851
There you go.

565
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,500
Oh! Um...

566
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:41,042
That wasn't... that's... school, um...

567
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There you go.

568
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:50,309
Do I even wanna touch this keyboard?

569
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:53,059
Just... do a search for "detox box,"

570
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,083
see what comes up.

571
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:03,082
Fran, I ordered a breathing treatment
for the guy that's in room two.

572
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:06,083
Let go of me, man! Get off me!

573
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,435
This is bullshit!

574
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:10,643
Another one of those kids
who played that cutting game.

575
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:13,083
You know, on the Internet
with that scary guy?

576
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,542
Your kids aren't into
that kind of stuff, are they?

577
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,208
Uh, no. Thank god.

578
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,582
All I can say is,
thank god I don't have kids.

579
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:28,143
- Hey.
- Hey, I just got to the school.

580
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,351
She's not here.

581
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,059
<i>We should never have
let her leave the house.</i>

582
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,309
- Okay, calm down, calm down.
- D... are you sure she didn't go home?

583
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:36,166
- Well, I'm headed home now.
- Get there when you can.

584
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,083
Oh god.

585
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:41,792
Wait, click on that.

586
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,708
Looks like a mommy blogger.

587
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,333
"Hi, I'm Melinda.

588
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,958
"Years ago, I began a journey
that would change my life forever.

589
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,875
A journey called motherhood."

590
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,625
Wait, go back to the post.

591
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:11,393
"Is your child's smart phone
making them grow horns?"

592
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:15,184
"Is your 5g network to blame?"

593
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:19,417
- "My son is never bored.
- Here's why that's a problem."

594
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:24,542
Oh my god, no way.

595
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,042
That bitch!

596
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
"Cut your screen time in the meantime."

597
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,625
Anything about grimcutty?

598
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,625
Does it say what it is?

599
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,250
- Oh.
- She took it down.

600
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,031
But whatever. I think it's obvious
she's hiding something.

601
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,976
Hey, did you hear about that kid in town

602
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,333
- that stabbed his mom?
- Mm-hm.

603
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,792
Well, how much you wanna bet that's her?

604
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:02,875
How do you know?

605
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:05,583
- Well, look at the posts.
- I would stab her.

606
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,667
This has to all be connected somehow.

607
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,750
Maybe.

608
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,500
Let me see if I can find her address.

609
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:22,875
Well, let's just regroup tomorrow
and do it. I gotta get home.

610
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,602
Get home?

611
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,833
Yeah, I just don't wanna freak out
my parents even more.

612
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,518
I spent years training them
to stop worrying about me,

613
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,476
I don't wanna screw it all up now.

614
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Why do they worry about you?

615
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,893
I don't know, they just do.

616
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:41,917
And I hate it.

617
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,667
Wa... hey, hey, hey, Cassidy?

618
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,792
Are we cool?

619
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,684
Yeah, why wouldn't we be cool?

620
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:54,917
I couldn't tell from your comment
if you were, like, pissed off, or...

621
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,559
my comment on your video?

622
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,643
I thought I just put "wow."

623
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:04,667
Well, yeah, but I... I couldn't tell
if you meant like "wow."

624
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:10,309
You know, in real life,
you are way different

625
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,542
than you are in your channel.

626
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,208
Thought you'd be way more, like, chill.

627
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:16,292
I am chill.

628
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:18,792
- Hm.
- I am.

629
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:24,059
Look, okay, I just hadn't had
any time alone to relax

630
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,226
and process all of this.

631
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,375
That's something I need.

632
00:43:27,292 --> 00:43:28,917
I'm actually a really zen-like person.

633
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:30,708
Really?

634
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,125
You don't strike me as zen-like at all.

635
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,893
Why not?

636
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:38,726
Dude, because... a zen-like person
doesn't have to hide in their room

637
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,708
and meditate every time
something goes wrong.

638
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:44,601
A zen-like person could be
in the middle of the most fucked up,

639
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,833
insane situation ever
and still find inner peace.

640
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,917
It's what zen is.

641
00:43:57,542 --> 00:43:59,792
- That was Sarah.
- They still haven't heard from her.

642
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,393
Well, I think it's time
to call the police.

643
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:02,833
Yeah.

644
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,434
Kamran, please just
go back downstairs, alright?

645
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,667
Everything's gonna be fine.

646
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,208
Amir?

647
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:20,958
What?

648
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:25,833
Oh my god.

649
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:33,042
- Where is this?
- Oh my god.

650
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:54,750
Ughhh!

651
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,542
Please be online.
Please be online.

652
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:16,893
<i>Boy, are you in trouble.</i>

653
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:19,893
<i>Mom and dad just peeled out
of the driveway at full blast.</i>

654
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,237
What?! Do they know where I am?

655
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,625
<i>Sure seemed like it.</i>

656
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:24,226
<i>Where are you anyway?</i>

657
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,101
- Never mind.
- Um... is the WiFi back on?

658
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:28,708
I need your help finding somebody.

659
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:31,851
<i>Yeah, but dad installed some
kind of monitoring software.</i>

660
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,351
<i>Anything I do could set it off.</i>

661
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,559
Wait, they just left
you there by yourself?

662
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:36,976
<i>Yeah, so?</i>

663
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,333
<i>I haven't seen the grimcutty.
They don't worry about me.</i>

664
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:44,667
Yeah, they don't worry about you.

665
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:46,541
<i>Find who?</i>

666
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,220
I need to find out
where this woman lives.

667
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,083
Can you do it?

668
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:55,917
<i>There are ways, but...</i>

669
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:57,976
what?

670
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,434
<i>This might set off dad's thing.</i>

671
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,874
<i>I don't wanna get in trouble.</i>

672
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:23,559
<i>What the frick is wrong with you?</i>

673
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:26,309
Kamran, I don't know exactly
what's going on with me,

674
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,542
but I can really use someone
to believe me right now.

675
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:32,250
Please... I need your help.

676
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:38,708
<i>Fine, I'll work on it.</i>

677
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:41,144
Thanks, stupid.

678
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:42,457
You're welcome, jerk.

679
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,542
- Oh my god.
- What?

680
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,934
She's posting about grimcutty now.

681
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:14,958
What?!

682
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,791
She's posting about grimcutty, hurry!

683
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,226
Oh, hey, hey, look at that!

684
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,875
- Huh?
- Look at that!

685
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,393
- Look at what?
- That!

686
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:43,042
How can you not see that?!

687
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:47,750
Goddamn it.

688
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:43,726
Help! Help!

689
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,518
Please somebody help me!

690
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:46,601
Help!

691
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,666
Somebody! Anybody!

692
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:51,417
Help me!

693
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:53,393
Help! Anybody!

694
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:54,768
Asha!

695
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:57,059
Somebody help me!

696
00:48:57,083 --> 00:49:00,083
Asha!

697
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:04,667
Asha! Asha!

698
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:08,042
Drop the knife, asha! Drop it, drop it!

699
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:13,875
Let me see.

700
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,333
God damn.

701
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:28,792
Did you see it?

702
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:35,708
It was right there.
How did you not see it?

703
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,184
We're gonna get you the help
that you need, sweetheart, okay?

704
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:43,208
I promise.

705
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,059
The hell?

706
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,917
Someone's using the WiFi in our house.

707
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:50,042
Did you leave your laptop out?

708
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:52,059
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

709
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:55,309
Uh, no. It's in the detox box
with everything else.

710
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,693
Well, then who the hell is this?

711
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,542
What did you do?

712
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,083
What did you do?

713
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:09,458
Asha, tell us the truth,
what did you do?

714
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:14,476
It's not his fault.

715
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,310
Come on.

716
00:50:15,334 --> 00:50:16,625
I told him to do it.

717
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,726
Mom, dad, just calm down!

718
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,167
Seatbelt! Now!

719
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:39,375
Gotcha.

720
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:14,917
Kamran!

721
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,875
Oh my god, kamran.

722
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:26,917
- He's breathing.
- Oh god.

723
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:30,833
Hey! Get back!

724
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,727
Can you hear me, baby?

725
00:51:34,751 --> 00:51:35,792
I'm gonna call 911.

726
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,559
Uh, hi. Um, yeah, uh, my son,

727
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:44,792
we just found him on the floor,
he-he's unconscious.

728
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:04,667
That's it, careful, careful.

729
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:07,518
You have to go slow
because the pain meds

730
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,958
knocked you out pretty good.

731
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,708
The doctors are hopeful.

732
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,934
They're outside right now
talking to your dad.

733
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:24,792
They, they say he could
wake up any minute.

734
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,184
- Oh my god, I'm bleeding again.
- There's blood.

735
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:31,688
- No, no, no, it's fine.
- Let me see.

736
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:33,333
Stay put.

737
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:38,226
You know what, I have to get somebody
to come change your bandages.

738
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,643
And I'm actually gonna get you
some clean sheets

739
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,309
and some blue pads
while I'm at it.

740
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:42,542
You just stay put, okay?

741
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,625
We made an appointment for you
for later this afternoon.

742
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:49,917
With a psychiatrist.

743
00:52:52,292 --> 00:52:53,292
It's not my fault.

744
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,934
'Course it's not your fault.

745
00:52:56,958 --> 00:52:58,375
It's what dad thinks.

746
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:03,601
- You know, he's, uh, he's...
- Your dad's scared.

747
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:07,458
So, he... he overreacted, that's all.

748
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:10,792
I'll be right back.

749
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:13,958
Mom?

750
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:18,417
You've known me my whole life.

751
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:22,476
I've never hurt myself before this.

752
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,018
Just think about it,
it doesn't make any sense.

753
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:26,893
- We saw you cutting yourself!
- You were cutting yourself, asha.

754
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:29,125
What am I supposed to do with that?
You tell me.

755
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,434
Let's let the psych handle it.

756
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,434
I think that he's gonna help you
make sense of this, okay?

757
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:36,458
I'll be right back.

758
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:09,417
I'm sorry, kamran.

759
00:54:56,333 --> 00:55:01,167
<i>Sasha beady, 4152. Sasha beady, 4152.</i>

760
00:55:02,292 --> 00:55:03,500
Mr. and Mrs. Johnston?

761
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:07,625
Come with me, please.

762
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,434
<i>New, disturbing reports
of teens gathering together</i>

763
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:23,083
<i>to try the grimcutty challenge,</i>

764
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,934
<i>watch each other cut themselves,</i>

765
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:28,643
<i>and even engage in bizarre

766
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,226
<i>For more on this developing story,</i>

767
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,875
<i>we wanna go now
to news channel 8...</i>

768
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,875
okay, I believe you now.

769
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:41,667
Where did it get you?

770
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:43,434
I was trying to crawl under the bed,

771
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:46,042
and... it got me in the legs.

772
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:47,667
Can't even walk.

773
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:49,893
You know, when I asked you about the cuts,

774
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:52,059
you could've just said
that grimcutty's this

775
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,750
real life huge fucking creature,
and it's gonna cut you.

776
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:57,167
- When'd you see it?
- Last night.

777
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:01,268
After my parents saw that video,
they, like, freaked out

778
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:02,542
and sent me to my room.

779
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,875
They were convinced I was suicidal.

780
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:09,208
What happened to you?

781
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,025
Wait, what are you even doing here?

782
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:13,292
I got the address.

783
00:56:13,792 --> 00:56:14,976
Of the mommy blogger?

784
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,393
- I was just on my way there.
- I stole my mom's keys.

785
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,143
What, so you're just
gonna knock on her door

786
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,934
and be like, "oh, hi.
I'm a huge fan of your blog.

787
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:25,250
Just happened to be in the neighborhood.
And by the way, are you totally insane?"

788
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,042
I have a theory.

789
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,000
Tell me.

790
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:35,268
You just said when your parents saw
the video and freaked out,

791
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,542
that's when it attacked you.

792
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,559
And it di... it didn't attack my brother
until my parents found out

793
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:42,434
he was using a computer
and freaked out, too.

794
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:45,476
It's, like, whenever their hysteria
about grimcutty boils over,

795
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,625
that's when it attacks.

796
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:51,792
- So... what?
- Our parents are controlling it?

797
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,417
Not on purpose.

798
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,680
It's like they don't
know they're doing it.

799
00:56:57,875 --> 00:57:01,643
And they can't see it,
so when I try to tell them what I saw,

800
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:04,667
it just makes them think I'm more crazy
and just makes them more hysterical.

801
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,750
It's like a vicious cycle.

802
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:10,208
Okay, so how do we break the cycle?

803
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:13,458
I don't know.

804
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:16,351
Well, you need to figure it out soon.

805
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:19,458
'Cause this psychiatrist
that I met with earlier,

806
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,958
my parents are meeting
with them right now.

807
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:27,768
So... if our parents freaking out
makes it stronger,

808
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:30,958
then... I'm dead.

809
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,458
Oh shit.

810
00:58:06,542 --> 00:58:07,750
Shit.

811
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:21,625
- Find anything on there?
- No.

812
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,167
- Where's asha?
- Um,

813
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,333
The psych's office had an opening,

814
00:58:30,042 --> 00:58:32,143
so they were able
to take her in earlier.

815
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:34,000
And she was feeling better, so.

816
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:38,518
I was actually...
I was just waiting for you.

817
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:39,625
What did the doctor say?

818
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:41,208
More of the same.

819
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:44,708
He might wake up today. Might not.

820
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:48,250
They've had a lot
of grimcutty-related cases, so.

821
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,083
You know, this could all just be
some kind of cyber-attack.

822
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:57,000
I mean, they've tried it before.

823
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:59,625
Use our networks to incite violence.

824
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:02,167
I mean, anybody could
do it from anywhere.

825
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:06,708
You know, aim it against a particular
community if you wanted, like ours.

826
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,059
Okay, I am, I'm gonna head back down.

827
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:14,708
I'll, I'll let you know how, how,
how it goes after her appointment.

828
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:26,875
Damn it, asha.

829
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:29,042
The hell are you into now?

830
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:03,917
Hi, can I help you?

831
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:05,935
Hi.

832
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:07,059
Sorry to just show up like this,

833
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:09,393
but I read your blog
and I was wondering

834
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:11,625
if I could ask you
some questions about it.

835
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:16,434
It's, it's for a class, and I didn't know
how else to contact you, so...

836
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:17,684
you could've just emailed me,

837
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:19,708
but, uh, sure, what, what, what
do you wanna know?

838
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:24,976
Uh, well, I saw your
post about grimcutty,

839
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,750
- and I was wondering...
- Sorry, I don't know what that is.

840
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:32,000
Uh, grimcutty. The online challenge
thing you posted about.

841
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,083
I don't remember anything like that.

842
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:38,333
Oh, it's, uh, it's, like, a, um,
a challenge thing

843
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:42,833
that's mak... well, supposedly,
making kids cut themselves.

844
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:47,583
And there... there was, like,
a rumor or something

845
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:51,875
that, like, it made some kid,
like, stab his mom.

846
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:01,698
I'm sorry, what, what did you say
your name was, honey?

847
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:02,810
Asha.

848
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:05,354
Asha, if I had a nickel for every time
I get asked about this.

849
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:11,708
Look, the bottom line is that my family
had an accident a while ago

850
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:14,393
and needless to say,
it's been blown way out of proportion,

851
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:15,060
but it's fine.

852
01:01:15,084 --> 01:01:17,042
We're fine. Everything is fine. Really.

853
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:19,656
Okay. Well, are you sure
you haven't heard of grimcutty?

854
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:21,851
Do your parents know that you're here?

855
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,143
Do you really not know
what's going on?

856
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:24,167
What do you mean?

857
01:01:24,417 --> 01:01:27,101
Everyone in town is reading your blog
and following what it says.

858
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,125
Like, religiously.

859
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:33,750
Huh.

860
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,226
Well, I haven't, uh,
updated it in a while,

861
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,250
but I... I'm very glad to hear
that people are connecting with it.

862
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:43,309
Maybe you should go home.

863
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,144
- But you should email me...
- But...

864
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:46,601
and if I think of anything,
I will let you know, okay?

865
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:47,625
Drive safe.

866
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:55,434
I know, it's for your own good, baby.

867
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:56,667
No. Drink all of it.

868
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:16,833
Hello?

869
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:08,125
Oh my god.

870
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:09,708
Oh my god.

871
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,167
Hey. What happened to you?

872
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:14,333
Put me back.

873
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,851
What?

874
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:18,476
Lock me back in. She'll see you.

875
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,684
But I have to get you out of here.

876
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:22,957
No. I can't make mom
worry about me.

877
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,000
Stay calm, asha.

878
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,458
Just relax.

879
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:31,917
Reach back with one hand,
grab your phone, and toss it to me.

880
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,042
I don't have a phone.

881
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:38,000
A girl your age leaving
your home without a phone?

882
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,275
Think you better tell me the truth.

883
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:43,042
Detox box, bitch!

884
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,792
Out into the hallway then.

885
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,000
Now!

886
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:52,042
Come on... oh.

887
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:55,833
Are you sure you don't have a phone?

888
01:06:56,792 --> 01:06:58,500
- What did you do to him?
- Me?

889
01:06:59,292 --> 01:07:01,749
He did that to himself.
I'm just trying to protect him.

890
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,351
Um, oh, hi.

891
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,601
Are you looking
for your daughter by chance?

892
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:30,518
- Yes, is sh...
- Mom! Mom! I'm back here!

893
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:31,726
Just come, come in.

894
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,727
- Please, come in.
- I'm sorry.

895
01:07:32,751 --> 01:07:34,934
She broke in, and I found her
in one of the back rooms

896
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:36,518
and I had to lock her in real quick.

897
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:38,601
I'm, I'm really sorry,
I just... I didn't know what to do.

898
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:39,809
I was about to call the police.

899
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:42,393
- Oh gosh. Please, no need.
- I-i-I'll take it from here.

900
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:43,518
- I am so sorry about this.
- No worries.

901
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:44,768
I'm just gonna unlock her real fast.

902
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:46,893
- I'm, I'm Melinda, by the way.
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

903
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:49,397
- I know. I read your blog.
- Mom, look out, she's got a gun!

904
01:07:49,917 --> 01:07:52,934
Gosh, she just, she really
hasn't been herself lately,

905
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:54,851
and I was worried she would
do something like this.

906
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:56,226
I'm... again, I'm really, really sorry...

907
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,434
as long as you're sure that
you can handle her, I won't ask.

908
01:07:58,458 --> 01:07:59,394
Thank you so much.

909
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:00,976
Mom, don't listen to her,
she just pointed a gun at me!

910
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,143
Take it easy.

911
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:04,851
I'm serious! She's got her son
locked up in a closet upstairs!

912
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,559
Okay, calm down. We're gonna
talk about it in the car, okay?

913
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,101
No, wait, wait! We can't just
leave him here with her.

914
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,559
- She might kill him!
- Just calm down.

915
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:11,059
I'm not gonna let her
do that to him, okay?

916
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:12,309
We have to get him out of here!

917
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:13,684
She might kill him!
We have to save him!

918
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:15,125
Asha, stop it!

919
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:28,667
I am so sorry about this.

920
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:31,958
Already forgotten.

921
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:34,934
We're gonna talk about it
when we get back to the hospital.

922
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:36,809
Mom, the same thing
that was happening to me,

923
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:39,059
same thing's happening to him, only worse.

924
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:40,708
What's happening to you, asha?

925
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:42,542
The grimcutty.

926
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:44,750
- No. No. No.
- The, the hysteria's feeding it!

927
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,393
No, no, think about it!

928
01:08:46,417 --> 01:08:48,934
It didn't start attacking me
until you and dad saw that photo!

929
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:49,958
Ugh!

930
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,792
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom,
chill for a second.

931
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:04,065
Hey, will you please just calm down?

932
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:06,000
Calm down?

933
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:08,893
After everything
that you have put us through,

934
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:10,809
you want me to calm down?

935
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,893
I didn't mean to put
you through anything.

936
01:09:12,917 --> 01:09:14,268
Of course, you didn't!

937
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:18,250
Because that would require you
to think for one second

938
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:21,143
how your behavior affects us!

939
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:22,144
But you don't care!

940
01:09:22,168 --> 01:09:25,643
As long as we pay your phone bill,
as long as we cook your food,

941
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:27,809
and buy you the latest
versions of everything,

942
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,457
you could give a flying fuck!

943
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:50,167
Oh my god.

944
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:56,458
Oh god.

945
01:09:58,542 --> 01:09:59,958
What the hell am I doing?

946
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,542
Alright, just, um,

947
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,500
take that in case anything happens,

948
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,292
stay in the car,

949
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:17,144
and I'll be right back.

950
01:10:17,168 --> 01:10:18,351
Wait,

951
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,184
mom, mom, what are you gonna do?

952
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,292
Stay in the car, asha.

953
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,625
Okay.

954
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,309
Car trouble?

955
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:31,726
No, you know, I just had one more thing,
if you don't mind.

956
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,768
Sure.

957
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:35,851
See, my daughter, she just said
something kind of crazy.

958
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:38,393
She said something about
your son being starved

959
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:40,125
and, and locked in a closet.

960
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:42,976
So, I'm just trying to figure out
why she, why she would say that.

961
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,958
Your daughter's quite a character.

962
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:49,125
- She is, I know, believe me I do know.
- She's quite a character.

963
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,125
Never known her to be a liar, though.

964
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:58,417
Well, I don't mean to presume,

965
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:01,309
but sometimes people
with mental illness

966
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:03,213
believe things to be true
even when they're not.

967
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:07,351
I also think I left my keys inside.

968
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:09,125
No. Excuse me, excuse me!

969
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:12,750
This is ridiculous.
You need to leave right now.

970
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:15,083
You know, she said another thing, too.

971
01:11:15,542 --> 01:11:17,768
She said that this whole
grimcutty thing started with you.

972
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:18,809
Is that true?

973
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:20,768
You need to leave my house right now,
or I'm gonna call the police.

974
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:22,625
Go ahead, call them please, I'll wait.

975
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,203
Maybe they can check on your son,
make sure he's okay.

976
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:29,018
This big collective freakout
about grimcutty

977
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:30,518
has put my family through hell,

978
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:33,018
so I would like to know
where it came from.

979
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:36,125
- Did you make it up? Just tell me and I will leave.
- My god.

980
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:41,809
I didn't make it up,
I don't know who made it.

981
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:45,226
I caught my son looking at it online,

982
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:47,542
and the next thing I know,
he's cutting himself.

983
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:49,208
And ever since then,

984
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,833
I've been trying to keep
it out of my house

985
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,934
and away from my child,
so I'd very much appreciate it

986
01:11:54,958 --> 01:11:57,226
if you would just stop talking about it.

987
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,309
Where did he find it?

988
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,518
And what was he doing
when he found it? Do you know?

989
01:12:00,542 --> 01:12:02,018
I, I told you that I don't
wanna talk about it.

990
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:03,851
- Did he cut himself?
- Stop it!

991
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:05,726
Stop it! I've cured him from that.

992
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,893
There's nothing wrong with him now!

993
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,157
There's nothing wrong with him!

994
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:11,268
Oh god, there's nothing wrong with him.

995
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:12,532
There's nothing wrong with him.

996
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:23,059
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

997
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:24,624
There's nothing wrong with him.

998
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:43,083
You bitch!

999
01:12:43,417 --> 01:12:45,518
I had it all under control!

1000
01:12:45,542 --> 01:12:47,957
But you just couldn't shut up about it!

1001
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:50,583
- Stop!
- No!

1002
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:57,625
- Oh god.
- Mom!

1003
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,059
- Go!
- Mom!

1004
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,083
Go!

1005
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,167
Stop! Stop!

1006
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,125
I know what's right for him!

1007
01:13:04,792 --> 01:13:07,833
There's castle law in this state,
and I'm legally allowed to defend myself!

1008
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:10,643
I am the one who spread that photo around,

1009
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:12,768
and now I am the one
who has to contain it!

1010
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:14,167
Aah!

1011
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:22,417
Aah!

1012
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:39,417
Asha!

1013
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:41,917
Get the car quick.

1014
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,500
Laura!

1015
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,830
- This is the kid?
- Over here. Yes, yes, please.

1016
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,934
Just be careful,
I could've sworn for a second

1017
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,318
he almost stopped breathing, so...

1018
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:54,226
We're gonna need intubation supplies

1019
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,893
and rt in room two, stat!

1020
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:58,601
- And I'll be right behind you.
- And page the trauma team!

1021
01:14:58,625 --> 01:14:59,602
I'm gonna go with them.

1022
01:14:59,626 --> 01:15:01,393
I need you to stay right here.
Don't move, okay?

1023
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:02,457
Okay. Wh-what about dad?

1024
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:04,042
I'm gonna handle it.

1025
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:09,958
You did great.

1026
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:50,458
Dad?

1027
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,375
I've been going over
some of your recent activity.

1028
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:00,875
There's a lot of interesting stuff.

1029
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:07,309
Did you really give
your phone number

1030
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:10,542
to someone on the darknet market?

1031
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:12,917
You know how dangerous that is?

1032
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:14,583
I...

1033
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,750
you could've put
this whole family at risk.

1034
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,028
How long have you had this thing?

1035
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,667
Oh, and your search history:

1036
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:29,542
Grimcutty, like, 50 times,

1037
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:32,875
tennis ball bombs, um,

1038
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:34,934
bat sex,

1039
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:37,583
the church of Satan, necrophilia,

1040
01:16:41,542 --> 01:16:43,792
Dylan klebold and Eric Harris.

1041
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,125
I didn't know what those things were.

1042
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,893
My friends were talking about it,
and I didn't know.

1043
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:51,499
I-I was just curious.

1044
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,833
Get up. Get dressed.

1045
01:17:27,417 --> 01:17:28,417
Kay?

1046
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:30,559
Oh, hey.

1047
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:32,958
- What are you doing here?
- Have you heard from Cassidy?

1048
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:35,042
You don't know.

1049
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:37,542
What?

1050
01:17:40,042 --> 01:17:41,583
She tried to kill herself.

1051
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,208
Stabbed herself in the neck.

1052
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:47,875
She's not supposed to make it.

1053
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:13,458
- Come on.
- Put your shoes on. Let's go.

1054
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:17,059
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

1055
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,083
Hurry up.

1056
01:18:21,917 --> 01:18:24,542
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god.

1057
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,333
There's something wrong with dad.

1058
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:28,792
I know.

1059
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,768
Leah, Leah, where's asha?

1060
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:32,809
She's downstairs and she's fine.

1061
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,101
You left her alone?

1062
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:35,226
That's what I wanted to tell you,

1063
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,309
there's nothing wrong
with either of our kids.

1064
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:39,351
- We got this wrong.
- Hey, what the hell is this, huh?

1065
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:40,375
Come on, what is this?

1066
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:43,726
- It's just a...
- It's a little something to help you relax.

1067
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,643
What are you doing?

1068
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:47,934
- You need to relax.
- You need to get some sleep.

1069
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:49,601
Uh-uh. Hey, Leah, let me have it.

1070
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:50,768
Just let me give it to you.

1071
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,685
Let me have it.

1072
01:18:51,709 --> 01:18:53,833
You're gonna feel so much
better afterwards, please.

1073
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:57,309
I understand that you're just trying
to do what's best for the kids.

1074
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,333
I know you are.

1075
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:01,101
But I need you to trust me,
just this one time.

1076
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:02,434
- You don't understand...
- Please trust me.

1077
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:03,269
Leah...

1078
01:19:03,293 --> 01:19:05,292
ma'am, are you the one
that brought the boy in?

1079
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:08,518
Yes, I can explain.

1080
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:10,434
- You can't just run off like that.
- Okay.

1081
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:11,435
You gotta answer some questions.

1082
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:13,101
Hey, what the hell is going on?

1083
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:15,351
Our kids are not crazy,
we are doing this to them.

1084
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:17,125
I need you to take the shot.

1085
01:19:25,542 --> 01:19:26,958
Kamran!

1086
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,542
Kamran!

1087
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,292
Whoa, whoa! Slow down, kid.

1088
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,167
Do your parents know where you are?

1089
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:51,750
Kamran!

1090
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:43,397
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, it's me.

1091
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:47,393
I just saw the grimcutty again.

1092
01:20:47,417 --> 01:20:48,559
Dad's going ape shit.

1093
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,684
- I know.
- The grimcutty's feeding off him.

1094
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:52,268
It attacks whenever mom and dad freak out.

1095
01:20:52,292 --> 01:20:54,167
What? How do you know that?

1096
01:20:55,792 --> 01:20:57,809
I found that kid who stabbed his mom.

1097
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,726
He was trying to kill her,
so it would stop attacking him.

1098
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,268
It worked. I saw it.

1099
01:21:01,292 --> 01:21:02,583
So, what do we do?

1100
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:12,684
What are you gonna do with those?

1101
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:13,809
I hurt it once before.

1102
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:15,601
If I can hurt it, maybe I can kill it.

1103
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,125
What if you can't?

1104
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,601
You're gonna stab dad?

1105
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:25,833
No! I don't know.

1106
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:28,559
It's really killing people now.

1107
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,059
If dad's really freaking out,
it could kill us.

1108
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:31,309
What about mom?

1109
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:33,059
Don't worry about mom, she's cool.

1110
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:34,684
What? How did that happen?

1111
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:37,000
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.

1112
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:39,750
Asha,

1113
01:21:40,917 --> 01:21:43,917
you can't... kill dad.

1114
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,700
Just stay here for a minute.

1115
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,434
I'll try to get dad's attention.

1116
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:51,518
And if he's focused on me,
it'll only attack me.

1117
01:21:51,542 --> 01:21:52,542
You'll be safe.

1118
01:21:55,708 --> 01:21:56,708
Good luck, stupid.

1119
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:58,542
Thanks, jerk.

1120
01:22:09,083 --> 01:22:10,083
Kamran?!

1121
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,417
Hey, buddy, it's dad!

1122
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:16,625
Look, I'm sorry I overreacted, okay?

1123
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,708
Everything's gonna be fine!

1124
01:22:20,417 --> 01:22:21,625
Everything's...

1125
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:24,167
Everything's gonna be fine.

1126
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:28,125
Kamran?!

1127
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:31,417
Kamran?!

1128
01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:43,167
Asha.

1129
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:46,083
Hey, dad!

1130
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:49,601
- What are you doing here?
- Where's your brother?

1131
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:52,351
- He's, he's fine.
- Well, I'm, I'm fine, too. We're both fine.

1132
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:54,059
Everyth... ev-everything's fine.

1133
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:55,375
Okay, that's good, good.

1134
01:22:57,708 --> 01:23:00,333
Hey, dad, can we start over?

1135
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:03,434
You know... take a breath, relax,

1136
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:06,750
just have a, a calm, rational discussion
about everything that's been happening?

1137
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,726
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
- I'm all about that, honey.

1138
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,934
You know, why don't you
help me find your brother,

1139
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:16,166
and then we can just sit down
and all talk it out together.

1140
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:21,083
Dad, I know that a lot of the things

1141
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:24,643
I'm into might not make
a lot of sense to you.

1142
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:25,726
No.

1143
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:28,018
That can be scary for you, I'm sure.

1144
01:23:28,042 --> 01:23:29,833
Um, and I...

1145
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:32,518
Well, I-I-I never try
to explain it to you

1146
01:23:32,542 --> 01:23:33,851
because I don't think you'll get it.

1147
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,309
But I realize now, you can get it.

1148
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:36,976
If we can just have
an honest conversation about it...

1149
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,792
whoa, whoa, asha, uh, um,

1150
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:41,750
honey, what is, what is
that in, in your, in your hand?

1151
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:43,374
What is that, asha?
Let me see.

1152
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:47,667
Actually, I took mom's phone,

1153
01:23:49,042 --> 01:23:51,226
and I've been watching
grimcutty videos all day long

1154
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,833
and I'm afraid of what I might do!

1155
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:01,335
- Can you just give me the scissors?
- Please, honey, give me the scissors.

1156
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,518
Give me the scissors, asha!

1157
01:24:03,542 --> 01:24:05,624
Asha! Asha!

1158
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,708
Alright, you bastard.

1159
01:24:18,542 --> 01:24:19,667
Come get some.

1160
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Asha.

1161
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,000
Asha, honey.

1162
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:37,958
Dad, please stop.

1163
01:25:38,417 --> 01:25:41,434
I need you to put
those scissors down, okay?

1164
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:42,792
I don't wanna have to hurt you.

1165
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:46,041
Asha, please.

1166
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,208
No, no, no!

1167
01:28:14,083 --> 01:28:16,583
Oh no, dad?

1168
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,292
Dad?

1169
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:24,976
Asha... I am so sorry.

1170
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,393
What? No, I'm sorry.

1171
01:28:27,417 --> 01:28:30,167
No, no, you have nothing
to be sorry for.

1172
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,768
I stabbed you.

1173
01:28:32,792 --> 01:28:34,083
I know, it's okay.

1174
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:36,309
I deserve it.

1175
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:39,542
No, you don't. You don't deserve it.

1176
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:41,792
It's okay.

1177
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:45,792
Honey, don't cry, it's okay.

1178
01:28:47,042 --> 01:28:49,375
Dad, dad, I love you. I love you.

1179
01:29:04,833 --> 01:29:06,042
<i>Hey, everyone.</i>

1180
01:29:07,917 --> 01:29:10,250
Gonna do something
a little bit different today.

1181
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:13,875
A lot of people have been
asking me about grimcutty,

1182
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:17,875
I guess because of what happened
to me and my parents.

1183
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:22,375
So, I'm gonna try to answer
a few of those questions now.

1184
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:24,417
First question:

1185
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,417
Did you kill your dad?

1186
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:32,083
<i>No, I didn't kill my dad.</i>

1187
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,625
<i>He's not dead. He's fine.</i>

1188
01:29:37,708 --> 01:29:38,708
<i>We're all fine.</i>

1189
01:29:42,542 --> 01:29:44,268
<i>I mean, yeah,
it's pretty messed up</i>

1190
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:45,875
<i>what we went through as a family.</i>

1191
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:49,833
Hey.

1192
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:55,417
<i>But for everyone out there
who had to deal with grimcutty,</i>

1193
01:29:56,417 --> 01:29:57,750
<i>I think you get it.</i>

1194
01:30:00,542 --> 01:30:01,542
<i>Which is most of you.</i>

1195
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:05,708
Next question:

1196
01:30:06,792 --> 01:30:08,917
What if the grimcutty comes back?

1197
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:12,708
<i>Well, it could happen, I guess.</i>

1198
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,917
<i>We still don't know where it came from,</i>

1199
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:20,018
<i>but if some crazy, controlling parent</i>

1200
01:30:20,042 --> 01:30:22,708
<i>like Melinda jaynes got wind
of it for the first time,</i>

1201
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:26,957
<i>yeah, it could flare up
all over again.</i>

1202
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:30,851
<i>But we'll be better prepared
to deal with it</i>

1203
01:30:30,875 --> 01:30:32,167
<i>the next time around.</i>

1204
01:30:32,792 --> 01:30:34,417
It's okay to talk to me.

1205
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:38,333
Last question:

1206
01:30:39,042 --> 01:30:40,875
My parents still worry
about grimcutty.

1207
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,750
Do you have any advice?

1208
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:47,333
<i>I would say</i>

1209
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:50,583
<i>if you want your parents to listen,</i>

1210
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:52,917
<i>you're gonna have to listen, too.</i>

1211
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:01,375
<i>And you have to be honest.</i>

1212
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:10,291
<i>Otherwise, how are they gonna know?</i>

1213
01:31:19,292 --> 01:31:21,000
<i>And if you're a parent,</i>

1214
01:31:22,292 --> 01:31:25,726
<i>I would say, it's okay
to not understand</i>

1215
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:27,708
<i>everything that's going on with us.</i>

1216
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:32,708
<i>It doesn't mean
you screwed up somewhere.</i>

1217
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,167
<i>It just means you're human.</i>

1218
01:31:41,792 --> 01:31:44,208
<i>And being human
is scary sometimes.</i>

1219
01:31:49,125 --> 01:31:51,583
You might be afraid
of what's gonna happen next.

1220
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:53,958
That's okay.

1221
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:56,875
You're doing really well.

1222
01:31:57,333 --> 01:31:59,542
Just give some
of my techniques a try.

1223
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:04,208
And most importantly,
don't forget to breathe.
