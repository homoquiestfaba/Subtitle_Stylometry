<i>Don't worry, we'll get you out.</i>

178
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,750
The computer…

179
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:02,000
The computer has to know.
MILO, location of the unit.

- [man] <i>We're trying to zero in.</i>

184
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,000
Maybe I'm buried, underground.

185
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,291
- [man] <i>Try to stay calm.</i>
- Maybe I've been buried alive.

186

- Stop telling me to calm down!

[man] <i>Listen, tell me everything
you can about the pod.</i>

I'm underground, right?

196
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,416
If I'm underground, you'll never find me.

197

MILO, can you do
a DNA search for Omicron 267?

MILO, search for Dr. Elizabeth Hansen
at the Science and Technology Awards.

508
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,333
No.

509
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,750
No…

510
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,333
- [Moreau] <i>Elizabeth.</i>
- No.

511
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,625
That's impossible.
We were both in the photo.

512
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,125
We were together. He was there.

513
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:20,250
I called him. Someone answered.

514
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,291
A woman. She knew him.

515
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23,958

- A woman...

516
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,416
[Moreau] <i>What did you say to her?</i>

517
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,708
Nothing. She hung up.

518
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:27,958
She knew him.

519
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,250
She knew him. She knew Léo.

520
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,708
[Moreau] <i>No, she wasn't real.</i>

What's going on?

523
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:38,833
[Moreau] <i>Liz, listen to me.
Léo isn't real either.</i>

524
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,583
- He was real.
- [Moreau] <i>Yes, I know.</i>

525
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:44,416

You have to trust me, I'll get you out.</i>

You're lying to me.

[Moreau] <i>You played basketball.</i>

530
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500
What?

531
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,333
[Moreau] <i>At college. You were gifted.</i>

532
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,083
<i>I thought you'd like
to hear something about yourself</i>

533
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,375
<i>and during my search, that struck me.</i>

[faint chatter in background]

535
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,708

[Moreau] <i>Yes.</i>

537
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,958

<i>Does it ring a bell?</i>

541
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,500
No.

[Moreau] <i>You were born in Stockholm.</i>

543
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,541
<i>Your mother was single
and raised you alone.</i>

Alice. Her name's Alice.

Oxford. Oxford.

553
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,791
I remember Oxford. That's where I met Léo.

554
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,666
That's where I met him.
He's real, I know he is.

555

[Moreau] <i>Elizabeth?</i>

556

<i>Everything said after that
was only what they wanted you to hear.</i>

730
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,083
But why?

731
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,958
If I was a key part of the project,
why not just tell me the truth?

732

They couldn't take that risk.</i>

737

I thought he was doing this to me,
that he was holding me.

738
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,708
He didn't tell me Léo was dead,
he said he wasn't real.

<i>Liz, everything, I mean everything,
everything was done</i>

<i>from the moment they realized
you'd regained consciousness</i>

741

<i>to prevent you
from recovering your memory.</i>

742
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,250
So he was playing for time.

743
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,500
He was waiting…

744
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,458
He was waiting
for me to run out of oxygen.

[inhaling deeply]

746
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,875
Léo was real…

747
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,291

What happened to him?

00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,208
[woman] <i>He was sick.</i>

754
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:29,750

<i>Liz?</i>

756
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:46,333
No, no, no. That doesn't add up.
They said I went missing three days ago.

757
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:50,041
<i>You've been in hypersleep
much longer than that.</i>

758

Where do we begin?

770
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:31,666
[woman] <i>Okay, first we need
to figure out what woke you up.</i>

771

[MILO] <i>Processor 3-54 overheating

[MILO] <i>Processor 3-54 monitors and

00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,833
Brain atrophy. You hear that?
I could do without that, personally.

777
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,208
[woman]<i> I agree.</i>

778
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:55,708
<i>We must divert
the cerebral activity monitor</i>

<i>to another processor
assigned to non-essential functions.</i>

780

[MILO] <i>All functions assigned

783
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,500
Is there any danger to the bioform

00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:12,041
if all functions of processor 694

[MILO] <i>Zero danger for the bioform.</i>
