When you're a parent,

00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,448
before I became a parent,

5
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:13,310
I used to worry
about over population

6
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:16,344
and the environment and war.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,551

When they're little,

you try to stay one step

in the road ahead.

you're good at it.

You think
you're doing it right.

Then something happens.

15
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:49,793
 The world out there 
is very, very scary.

 It just is.

 and I always have,

19
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,068
 it's hard to ever have 
a day off from it, you know.

 Hey, what's up is 
I'm looking at these forms

42

 for the Lopez insurance claims 
and there are no signatures.

Right, well,
I'll get the signatures
first thing on Monday.

 No, wrong. 
You will not get the signatures 
first thing on Monday.

45
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:01,862
 What you'll do is you'll 
get them right now.

 Get in your car

hurt, are you hurt?

No, Mom.

I spilled some boiling
water on me, it's fine.

to your hand?

He spilled
boiling water on it.

I was making spaghetti
for my study group,

but it's fine,
it's all right.

99
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,862
Well, at least
you have insurance.

100
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:21,310
Yeah. Heh. So, how is
the insurance game?

101
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,482
He wishes he was still
grading history exams.

102
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:24,689
At times, yeah.

103
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,172
So, how is the school game?

104
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:31,068
School game is, uh, well,

105
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,034
for the time being
anyway, it's over.

106
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:39,241
Dad, I can't draw.

107
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,586
What about
your other classes?

108
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,172
Chemistry is the only
other one I had besides art

109
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,517
and that's just not
worth staying for.

110
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:46,068
But the one time
you finally get on track.

111
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:48,172

can we do this later, please?

112

-Yeah, yeah.

113
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:05,103
I don't mean okay
like Mom means it.

114
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,620
I mean
like really okay.

115
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:10,655
Well, you know
what they say,

116
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:13,137
one day at a time. Hmm?

117
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:16,862
So, does this mean that
you're going to stay home?

118
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:20,137
The semester's
already half over.

119
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:22,689
It's okay, honey,
you stay home.

120
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:24,827
You can go back next semester.

121
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,413
Maybe. I don't know.

122
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:27,724
I thought you liked it there.

123
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:30,241
The art department's
really lousy.

124
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,000
What's this art department
stuff all of a sudden?

125
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:33,448
I thought you wanted
to be an architect.

126
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:34,758
I mean, we are shelling out

127
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:35,965
a heck of
a lot of money here.

128
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,655
Ed, it's
not just about money.

129
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:40,344
No, well, I'm-- No, I'm trying
to understand, that's all.

130
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,965
I just felt
limited there, you know.

131
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:46,310
They didn't
get me there.

132
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,172
What does that mean,
they didn't get you?

133
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:52,310
I get you, buddy.

134
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:53,965

I'm just trying
to understand, I'm concerned.

00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,758
I'm sorry
I disappointed you.

I always seem
to do that, don't I?

142

You aren't
disappointing anybody.

143
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,137
It's just, school...

144
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:22,137
You know, you guys always
assume that it's me,

145
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:24,103
that it's my fault.

146
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:26,482
I just-- I had
a really rough time

147
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:27,931

you guys.

Go on.

00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:50,793
Okay.

Are you still working
at the lumber yard there?

Yep. I'm saving
to go to Europa.

Really?
Maybe I'll come.

just along for the ride

175
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,620
What kind of trouble
are you into these days?

he could handle.

unusually upset

he's what you'd call, a...

Sheila: When she was
in the "Nutcracker,"

361
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:41,379
the write-up
in "The Examiner" said...

362
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,655
..."next ingénue".

363
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:49,586
You saw her.

364
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:51,896
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:54,448
I'm so sorry.

You think nothing like this
will ever happen.

367
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:07,931
It's not supposed
to happen to you.

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,068
I know.

369
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,586
I know.

370
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,517
The cops talk to you yet?

371
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:20,724
Nothing official, no.

372
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,793
They will.

373
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:23,896
They will.

[lawnmower whirring]

375
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:27,310
When they do,
you gotta help me.

376
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,344
You gotta help me.

377
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:31,137
You gotta tell them
that I left the bar

378
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:32,448
before she did.

379
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:34,482
Oh. Look, Jeb--

00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:37,586
-Teddy-- Teddy, you got--
-You know, this--
It's serious this time.

381
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:38,931
-This is a big deal.
-Teddy, you gotta.

382
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,379
Teddy, you gotta.

383
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, you know,
they just think you're

384
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:47,931
in the parking lot waiting
for her, something, you know,

385
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,275
-that you gave her a ride.
-No, no, no, no, no.

386
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:51,965
No, not if you--
Not if you tell them

387
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,965
you saw me drive off
on my own.

388
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:59,827
Come on, please, Teddy.

00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:02,586
Please.

390
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,379
All right.

391
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:13,000
Fine,
I'll tell them that.

392
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:15,620

 At this point, police say...

410
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,517
Hey, Teddy.
I think we've heard enough.

411
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,448
Why did you tape this?

412
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,517
I grew up,
we all grew up with Katie

413
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:10,172
and now she's dead.

414
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:13,103
She's gone.
Can you get that, Dad?

415
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,103
There's no need to speak
to your father that way.

416
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:17,724
Don't tell me
that I don't get it.

417
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:20,034
Sheila lost a child.

418
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:22,137
You have no right
to tell me that I don't get it

419
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:24,000
because
we've also lost a child.

420
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,896
Oh, God.
This could have been Jana.

421

-Oh, thanks.
-Jana--

00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:32,586
-I'm sorry.
-You didn't have to say that.

Well...
I've got my meeting.

00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:36,862
It's my first
anniversary.

425
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,310
Be back later.

Want me to put
a fresh bandage on that hand?

-It's healed.

Hmm.

[car departs]

434
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:08,137
Listen, the phone bill came.

435
00:22:08,206 --> 00:22:09,482
There are all these calls
to a 900 number.

436
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:10,689
Are they yours?

437
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:12,965
Why would you think
they were mine?

438
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,310
'Cause they were made
the last time you were home.

Well, that doesn't mean

440
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:19,931
they were mine.

441
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:25,620
Teddy:
Okay, I'll pay for 'em.

442
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:29,000
What are they, some kind

443
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:31,793
of technical support line
or something?

444
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:33,241
You think
these computer companies

445
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,000
would have 800 numbers.

446
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,517
It's not
computer companies, Mom.

447
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,068
Well, then, what is it?

448
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,620
Look, Mom, I said
I'll pay you for 'em, okay?

449
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:58,103
I hate when
you hide things from me.

450
00:22:58,172 --> 00:23:01,344
-What? What am I hiding?
-I don't know.

451
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,172
It's just
the way you're acting.

452
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:07,896
All right, Mom,
it was phone sex.

453
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,517
You know, I'm not
a pervert or anything.

454
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:14,965
I was just curious.

455
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:18,827
And now
I'm totally embarrassed.

456
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:23,379
I'll give you the money.

457
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:25,000
Forget it.

Teddy:
You don't...

459
00:23:26,793 --> 00:23:29,586
You don't think I have
some sort of problem, do you?

460
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:33,724
No, I don't.

461
00:23:35,827 --> 00:23:37,896
You don't have
any kind of problem.

462
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:42,862
I just don't like
secrets, deception.

463
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:45,241
You know that.

and I'm an alcoholic.

465
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:55,310
Um, a year ago last night,

466
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,275
I had my last drink.

467

[attendees applauding lightly]

468
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:02,517
We all know there are things
in every family's past

469
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:06,482
that make drinking seem
like a pretty easy way out

470
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:09,379
and it was that way
with me for a while.

471
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,620
Uh, but we know that
the problems don't go away.

472
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:15,413
Only I did
and I wasn't there

473
00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:19,448
for my wife and my kids.

474
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:22,931
But, with your support,

475
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
you know, I've got
a second chance.

476
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:30,689
Heh. And I'd like
to thank my sponsor Mike

477
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:32,655
for being there for me

478
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:35,103
and to all of you
for being there for me

479
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:36,310
and for your support,

480
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:38,724
and here's
to another sober 24 hours.

Mike: I'm sorry
I was late, but this case.

482
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:46,344
Ed: Hmm.

but this, this...

485
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:52,068
Usually,
it's prostitutes

or transients
these sickos go for,

487
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:55,482
not such
an innocent young girl.

488
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:57,448
I can't believe
it's happening in Bridgeport.

489
00:24:57,517 --> 00:25:01,310
Mmm. Well, the behavioral
science guys at the FBI say

490
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:04,448
it has all the characteristics
of a ritual killing.

491
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:06,482
This guy has
a very specific MO

on the way
that he kills.

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,620
-Sex?
-No, no, no, it's not sex.

494
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:12,827
There's no sign
of rape.

495
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:15,551
No, it's more about power
and control.

Exerting power
and degrading her.

497
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,034
I can't bear
to think of her,

last moments.

499
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:23,965

right into the heart.

And afterwards,
he, uh...

00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:33,000
He cut Xs
on both her eyes.

-[Ed exclaims]
-Yeah...

504
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,551
Then he chopped off
her hair.

this boyfriend of hers long?

-Jeb?-Yeah.

507
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:45,172

Yeah, I know him.

508
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,862
I've known him
since he was a kid.

509
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:48,793
I coached him
in Little League.
You don't...

510
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:50,206
I mean, you don't think
that he...?

511
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:53,620
Oh, I don't know what
to think, Ed, I don't know.

I've been sober
for eight years,

a drink, I know that.

if I can hide this

You and I keep
going over and over.

What am I supposed to do?

520
00:26:17,413 --> 00:26:18,827
Teddy?

521
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:21,448
Are you on the phone?

522
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:24,344
Teddy:
Yeah.

523
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:26,275
Do you need to use it?

524
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:28,068
No, it can wait.

Teddy, I need you
to talk to me.

I need you to tell me
what you saw.

529

Just, what
I already told you.

00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:04,827
Come on, Teddy.

531
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:07,000
-Look, can't this wait?
-No.

532
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:08,586
If you have something
to tell me,

533
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:09,965
then no, it can't.

534
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,000
Tell me about Jeb.

535
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:16,413
Well, this is
destroying him,

536
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:19,172
this, people thinking
he did it.

537
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,034
Did he tell you that?

538
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:25,551
It's okay, son.

539
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,000
Look, you've known me
for a long time now.

540
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:29,310
You know I wouldn't
be asking this

541
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,689
if it wasn't important.

542
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:33,000
Now, talk to me,
tell me about Jeb.

543
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:38,620
He asked me
to lie for him.

544
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:43,517
He asked me to tell you

545
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:46,068
that he left
before Katie did.

546
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,034
And I can't do that.

547
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:56,275
I just can't do that.

548
00:27:57,586 --> 00:28:01,310
So, they left together,

549
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,448
that was the last time
I saw them

550
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:03,758
and that's it.

551
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:07,413
All right,
Teddy, thanks.

552
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:09,827
I sure appreciate that.

00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:39,241
Oh, Mom.

556
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:41,724
I know.

557
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:46,551
I wanna go to her house.

558
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:49,862
To Grandma's?

559
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:52,551
To the cottage,
just the two of us, okay?

560
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,310
Oh, honey, I have
to talk to your father.

561
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:57,655
No, just the two of us.

562
00:28:57,724 --> 00:29:00,827
I need it to be
just the two of us, okay?

563
00:29:02,689 --> 00:29:04,000
We can leave tonight.

564
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:05,620
We'll come back tomorrow.

565
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,137
Please, Mom.

566
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,448
Ed:
We should all go.

567
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:24,379
He wants it
just him and me.

568
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:26,655
Come on, Ed, don't give me
a hard time with this.

569
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,620
I just think
it's not necessarily

570
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:31,103
the healthiest--
Don't you see what I mean?

571
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:32,517
He's very fragile
right now.

572
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:33,724
Katie's death
has really hit him.

573
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:35,310
Well, it's hit
all of us hard.

574
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:38,241
-Rini, he's almost 20
and he can't be--
-Ed, he and I talk.

575
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,862
We can talk.

576
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:43,310
We always have been able to,
about things.

577
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:46,068
God, he and I have been
through so much together.

578
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:47,655
Ed:
I know you have.

579
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:49,931
Teddy:
Come on, Mom, let's go.

580
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,724
All of it, really.

581
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:53,689
He was my support.

582
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:56,517
Ed:
I guess I'm jealous.

583
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,448
I wish he and I had
that kind of relationship.

584
00:29:58,517 --> 00:30:01,137
-How could you?
-I know.

585
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:03,172
I'd be up in our room
with the door closed,
feeling like--

586
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:05,379
-The room was spinning.
-But not so drunk I didn't know

587
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:07,172
my family was downstairs
living a life without me

588
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,758
and a lot of the times
he had to...

589
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:10,551
pull my weight around here.

590
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:17,896
God, Rini, you know,
when I started drinking,

591
00:30:17,965 --> 00:30:19,931
you know what it did
to me when Joey died.

592
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,551
-I was there.
-[slams drawer closed]

593

And you handled it
in your own way.

594
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:29,965
At least I slept at home
in my own bed every night

595
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:31,172
and not in someone else's.

I'm not doing it.

600
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:38,241
You can't.

601
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,275
We'll be back
tomorrow, late.

602
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,620
Ed: Are you gonna tell him
about the cottage?

603
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:52,413
I suppose I'll have to.

604
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,551
Drive safe.

Grandma used to read
to us in this chair.

Oh, sweetie,

I think
she was ready to go.

Yeah, well,
I wasn't ready.

She was the only one
who really saw me, you know.

I don't know,
she just, she knew me.

617
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:32,068
She knew
how I felt inside.

Sometimes it was like
she knew my thoughts.

Irene: Yes, well,
she was one of a kind.

620

Yeah, she was.

621
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:47,000
She really was.

622
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:54,310
I feel so alone now
without her.

623
00:32:56,517 --> 00:33:00,068
I don't know if I'll ever
have that again with anyone.

624
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,896
Don't you miss her?

625
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:06,896
Of course I do,
she was my mother.

626
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:09,310
What a question.

Maybe I'll stay here
for a while.

ever use the place.

I don't know.

What?

a job around here.

-[Teddy chuckles]
-Why don't you let me cut it?

709
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,724
Because I don't really
know you that well.

710
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:18,965
I bet you're good, though.

711
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:20,551
I don't have
an artistic bone

712
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,482
in my body, but yeah,
it's my art, they say.

713
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:27,413
I do wanna open
my own shop one day.

714
00:38:28,758 --> 00:38:30,206
I hope you do.

715
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:36,862
See, I think there's
an artistic soul in everyone.

716
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:39,103
It's just waiting
to come out.

717
00:38:39,172 --> 00:38:42,344
Well, if that's the case,
then mine is buried pretty deep.

718
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:46,413
Right. It just gets
all squelched in you.

719
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:48,379
Maybe you had a teacher

720
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:51,275
or your parents
got you all inhibited,

721
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:53,172
and told you you
weren't good enough.

722
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:55,724
Maybe you had
a brother or sister

723
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,793
that was better
at it than you were

724
00:38:57,862 --> 00:39:01,931
and nobody ever noticed
what you could do.

725
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:18,344
Irene:
Teddy.

726
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:19,896
I worked at that
store for 10 years.

727
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:21,965
How can I show
my face in there again?

728
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,000
Don't. I'm not gonna.

729
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:26,931
Come on, Mom,
you can find a place

730
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,551
better than
that for your talents.

731
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,931
It's not your place to decide
where your mother works.

732
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,517
What you did
was inexcusable.

733
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,896
Oh, you are blowing this
way out of proportion.

734
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:35,344
Ed: I'm not blowing anything
out of proportion,

735
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:36,896
including the fact that
you left your computer on

736
00:39:36,965 --> 00:39:38,517
for some disgusting
internet slut

737
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:40,655
to send you pornography.

738
00:39:40,724 --> 00:39:42,482
You went in my room?

739
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:44,241
Never mind that.

740
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,068
No, I don't go
through your damn room!

741
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:47,413
Well, it was
your little brother

742
00:39:47,482 --> 00:39:49,793
who was in there
reading that crap.

743
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:51,586
A lot has changed
in the last year, son.

744
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,413
I am sober and we are trying
to rebuild this family.

745
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:57,206
Right, without me.

746
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:01,034
-Don't say that.
-Oh, I can see.

747
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:03,172
You've always wished
I would have been
the one who died.

748
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:05,655
I wish I was the one who died!
Teddy, how can you even--

749
00:40:05,724 --> 00:40:07,551
-If Joey hadn't started that
fire, he would still be here...
-Ed: Stop it!

750
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,448
...and he would still
be your favorite!

751
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,413
Stop it.
I said stop it.

752
00:40:11,482 --> 00:40:13,862
I know how much
he meant to you.

753
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:15,620
No, no, this is not about him.
This is about you.

754
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:16,655
This is about
you taking responsibility

755
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:18,103
for your own actions.

756
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:20,379
Now, listen to me.

757
00:40:20,448 --> 00:40:22,172
Now, either you get on track

758
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:23,655
and you get a job

759
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:25,413
and you keep a job or--

760
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:26,655
Or what?

761
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:30,379
Or what, Dad,
what are you gonna throw me out?

762
00:40:30,448 --> 00:40:31,965
Yes.

763
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:34,103
No, no one is
throwing anybody out.

764
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:35,724
It doesn't have
to come to that.

765
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:36,965
That's right,
Mother.

766
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,655
We wouldn't want
to give anyone

767
00:40:38,724 --> 00:40:40,206

would we?

-Ed: Teddy, enough.

everything?

You know,
he burned his hand.

796
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,689
It wasn't his fault
he couldn't do the work.

797
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:02,241
Well, that
really had nothing to do

798
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,241
with Dean Richards' decision.

799
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,862
Teddy, you know, he was
in here a number of times,

800
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:08,275
and I tried
to make him understand

801
00:42:08,344 --> 00:42:09,724
just how concerned we were.

802
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,482
Mr. Atkins,
if you're thinking

803
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:13,655
of expelling Teddy
from here,

804
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:15,827
I would think the least
Dean Richards could do

805
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:17,068
is see me himself.

806
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:19,344
Well, as I mentioned,
Dean Richards is unavailable

807
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,655
at the moment and
as Associate Dean of Students,

808
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:23,758
this type of matter
is more my department.

809
00:42:23,827 --> 00:42:26,517
What type of matter?

810
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:30,137
Mrs. McNair, we already
have dismissed Teddy.

00:42:30,206 --> 00:42:31,896
[dramatic theme playing]

812
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:35,655
A mid-term project
he turned in

813
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,862
for advertising art design.

814
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:42,103
The instructor tried
to give him some input on it,

815
00:42:42,172 --> 00:42:43,965
and when she did, well,

816
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:46,241
he became explosive.

817
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,965
What does that mean,
explosive?

818
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:49,068
You mean he didn't agree?

819
00:42:49,137 --> 00:42:50,172
Well, actually, I mean,

820
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:51,620
he became rather abusive.

821
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:54,827
Teddy?
What was her criticism?

822
00:42:54,896 --> 00:42:56,034
Well, that's
not really the point.

823
00:42:56,103 --> 00:42:59,137
He became very abusive--
verbally and threatening.

824
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:00,586
Please!

825
00:43:02,448 --> 00:43:04,586
He said that
she didn't get him,

826
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:07,137
she couldn't see his vision.

827
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:08,724
In fact,
he kept saying that,

828
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:10,724
that she just didn't get him.

829
00:43:10,793 --> 00:43:12,344
And then he hurled
a chair at the wall.

830
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:18,655
You know,
if there were problems here,

831
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:19,965
if Teddy
was having problems here,

832
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:21,310
why was
I not informed?

833
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:23,137
I believe you were informed.

834
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:25,000
We were not informed.

835
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:26,793
Maybe he doesn't belong here.

836
00:43:26,862 --> 00:43:29,241
I'm really very sorry,
but I do have to go.

for a long time.

to watch these together.

Heh. Look at you.

847
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:00,793
You could never relax.

848
00:46:00,862 --> 00:46:03,793
Look, you can see it
in your face, right there.

849
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:07,241

we were gonna fall off.

I could catch you.

I could understand.

00:46:14,758 --> 00:46:16,482
Something I could control.

853
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:24,931
On the news, there was
a seven-year-old girl

854
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,379
who had a pillow case
in her room filled

855

with weapons so she could
kill her baby brother.

Dean Richards called.

860
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,620
I drove there today.

861
00:46:46,689 --> 00:46:48,482
I met with Dean Atkins.

862
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:55,896
I saw that disgusting
picture you made.

863
00:46:57,827 --> 00:46:59,034

I saw what it was.

866
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:10,758
It was project.

867
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:14,241
And it was incredible.

868
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,068
It was incredible, but no one
else bothered to see that.

869
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:19,965
He told me you were
flunking all your courses
and they expelled you.

to know what's going on

and from time to time,

1055
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:46,896
well, there's not one of us
who hasn't at some time

1056
00:58:46,965 --> 00:58:50,827
done something
or had a thought

1057
00:58:50,896 --> 00:58:54,827
or just done something

1058
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:57,344
that might be kind
of embarrassing or shameful

1059

ever to discover it.

This is not anything.

1061
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:04,137
This is not a lecture
or anything.

1062
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:06,620
We're just talking
about this out in the open.

1063
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:11,137
A truth game.

1064
00:59:11,206 --> 00:59:13,000
Yes, a truth game, yes.

1065
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:17,068
All right.

1066
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:20,793
I was wrong to go
in there like I did,

1067
00:59:20,862 --> 00:59:24,000
and I'm sorry
for that, but I did.

1068
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,517
And now we have
to talk about it.

1069
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:31,379
Fine, I'll talk about it.

1070
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:33,068
I'll talk about
anything you want.

1071
00:59:37,758 --> 00:59:39,448
What happened
at school, Teddy?

1072
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:41,896
Teddy:
What happened?

1073
00:59:43,586 --> 00:59:46,103
I don't feel like I know

1074
00:59:46,172 --> 00:59:47,655
and I think we need to.

1075
00:59:49,137 --> 00:59:52,413
Were you lonely,
depressed?

1076
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:55,482
No, Mom, I was
the most popular guy on campus.

1077
00:59:58,206 --> 01:00:00,482
I'll tell you what happened.

1078
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:03,896
That bitch of an art teacher,

1079
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:05,413
who didn't know...

1080
01:00:07,413 --> 01:00:08,965
Art, to this woman,

1081
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:11,482
was a frilly greeting card

1082
01:00:11,551 --> 01:00:13,793
and that's just not art.

1083
01:00:17,137 --> 01:00:18,379
She made fun of me.

1084
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:21,758
She said I had no talent.

1085
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,862
You know that's not true.

1086
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:26,068
Oh, how would you know?

1087
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:29,896
Well, she was wrong.

1088
01:00:29,965 --> 01:00:31,586
She should never
have said that.

1089
01:00:31,655 --> 01:00:34,655
But at least
she said something.

1090
01:00:34,724 --> 01:00:37,310
I mean, this was
my chance, you know.

1091
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:39,931
This was my chance

1092
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,965
to really, finally
make someone notice me,

1093
01:00:44,034 --> 01:00:47,103
to make someone see
that I'm worth something.

1094
01:00:47,172 --> 01:00:50,482
I think we should find someone,
someone professional

1095
01:00:50,551 --> 01:00:53,758
to help us, the three
of us together, hmm?

1096

1101
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:09,793
to have that little fling?

1102
01:01:09,862 --> 01:01:11,068
That is none of your concern.

1103
01:01:11,137 --> 01:01:12,758
Oh, well, if we're
all in this together,

1104
01:01:12,827 --> 01:01:15,551
then it damn well
is my concern, isn't it?

How come, all of a sudden,

recently consumed alcohol,

that age of the victims

and the lack
of a struggle

that the subject
is young.

some behavior from them

and when they turned sexual,
he became enraged,

because this is someone
looking for attention, not sex.

at a woman close to him.

the subject is so young,

still lives at home.

01:08:16,827 --> 01:08:19,827
The victims
all have Xs

1227
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:22,275
cut into their eyelids,

1228
01:08:22,344 --> 01:08:24,793
and he took earrings
from each one of them

1229
01:08:24,862 --> 01:08:26,655
as a souvenir.

1230
01:08:26,724 --> 01:08:29,758
He obsessed
about these victims

1231
01:08:29,827 --> 01:08:32,689
and he wanted to have a way
to hold onto them.

1232
01:08:34,275 --> 01:08:37,000
Why? Why the...?

1233
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:40,965
He feels
that women don't see him.

1234
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,758
His rage is against women
like his mother

1235
01:08:43,827 --> 01:08:46,000
who don't see him
for what he is.

1236
01:08:48,034 --> 01:08:50,310
What he is
is a very sick individual.

1237
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:51,862
Well...

1238
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:01,586
Valerie was in today.

1239
01:09:01,655 --> 01:09:04,000
She said she'll be ready
at eight so you better
just drop me off.

1240
01:09:04,068 --> 01:09:05,379
All right.

1241
01:09:16,344 --> 01:09:18,689
She said the earring
I found wasn't hers.

1242
01:09:21,551 --> 01:09:23,896
I guess it belongs
to one of Jana's friends then.

1243
01:09:30,103 --> 01:09:31,344
Sorry I'm late.

1244
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:33,068
Ed?

1245
01:09:33,137 --> 01:09:34,551
Where are the kids?

1246
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,793
Doing homework.

1247
01:09:35,862 --> 01:09:38,103
Uh, did they eat?

1248
01:09:38,172 --> 01:09:40,034
Well, where's Leonard,
did he call?

1249
01:09:40,103 --> 01:09:41,931
Ed: Rini, would you stand still
for one moment?

1250
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,517
-Leonard canceled.
-What is it, Ed?

1251
01:09:44,586 --> 01:09:46,793
The Hausers, the people who put
the bid in on the cottage,

1252
01:09:46,862 --> 01:09:49,275
their daughter
was murdered this afternoon.

1253
01:09:49,344 --> 01:09:51,517
They think
it was the same killer
who murdered Katie.

1254
01:09:53,206 --> 01:09:55,241
Why do they think that?

1255
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:57,344
It was the same.

1256
01:10:01,206 --> 01:10:02,965
They found her
in the same position.

[sighs]

1258
01:10:10,448 --> 01:10:12,689
Obviously,
it wasn't Jeb,

1259
01:10:12,758 --> 01:10:14,344
so they let Jeb go.

1260
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,000

Hi, sweetie.

1264
01:10:48,862 --> 01:10:50,172
What are you working on?

1265
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:52,034
A book report.
What's up?

1266
01:10:53,655 --> 01:10:56,241
I was just wondering, uh,
could one of your friends

1267
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:59,344
have lost an earring
in my car, maybe Madeline?

1268
01:10:59,413 --> 01:11:00,724
-Pierced?
-Yeah.

1269
01:11:00,793 --> 01:11:03,310
Madeline doesn't
have pierced ears.

1270
01:11:03,379 --> 01:11:04,758
Oh.

1271
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,000
You didn't borrow
an earring from anybody?

1272
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:08,551
Because I found
an earring in my car

1273
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,758
and I just thought--

1274
01:11:09,827 --> 01:11:11,620
No. Maybe Teddy
had a date.

What is it?

I'm right here.

I...

1284
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:39,310
I had a bad dream that you
and Daddy sent me away.

Oh, honey, we would
never do that. We love you.

But what if
I was really bad?

1287

You're not bad.
You're a good boy.

1288

I know, but I could
grow up to be bad

No, you haven't.

to blame for this.

as all the stars in the sky."

01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:20,241
I spent my whole life trying
to be noticed by you.

1402
01:21:21,482 --> 01:21:23,310
What are you doing, Teddy?

1403
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:24,655
We both died in that fire.

1404
01:21:24,724 --> 01:21:25,862
Joey was the lucky one!

1408
01:21:42,724 --> 01:21:44,931
You don't even know me!

1409
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Valerie:
I won't say anything!

Valerie!

1422
01:23:01,896 --> 01:23:03,137
Honey-- Honey--

1423
01:23:04,344 --> 01:23:05,758
Ed.

1424
01:23:05,827 --> 01:23:06,896
Ed: Valerie!

1425

-Irene: Teddy!
-Ed: Valerie!

1426
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:10,206
Please, honey,
come with us.

1427
01:23:11,517 --> 01:23:12,793
It's gonna be okay.

1428
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:14,137
You always say that.

1429
01:23:14,206 --> 01:23:18,551
And it will be.
Sweetheart? Teddy?

1430
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:19,793
Teddy, there are ways.

1431
01:23:24,275 --> 01:23:25,620
We love you.

1432
01:23:25,689 --> 01:23:27,689
Your father and I
love you.

1433
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,103
Please.

1434
01:23:31,551 --> 01:23:33,275
[sobbing]
Give me another chance.

1435
01:23:35,862 --> 01:23:37,931
Let me try to be
a better mother to you.

1436
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,034
I want to try.

1437
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:43,482
Teddy.

1438
01:23:47,965 --> 01:23:49,000
Mom.

1439
01:23:49,068 --> 01:23:50,172
Uh-huh?

1440
01:23:51,517 --> 01:23:53,793
Joey didn't start the fire.

1441
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:57,000
I did, and then I ran.

1442
01:23:58,586 --> 01:24:01,068
It wasn't your fault, Mom.

1443
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:02,655
Nothing was your fault.

1444
01:24:07,137 --> 01:24:08,551
Teddy, no!

1445
01:24:09,862 --> 01:24:11,517
Teddy, no, no, no!

1446
01:24:16,275 --> 01:24:19,517
No!

1447
01:24:26,137 --> 01:24:28,000
Teddy!

1451
01:25:18,448 --> 01:25:20,896
No!

1452
01:25:42,724 --> 01:25:45,827
Irene:
This is a scary world

1453
01:25:45,896 --> 01:25:47,689
and I worry
about my children.

1454
01:25:49,206 --> 01:25:50,862
I always have.

1455
01:25:56,482 --> 01:25:58,724
It's about my life.

1456
01:25:58,793 --> 01:26:00,413
Trying to control,

1457
01:26:00,482 --> 01:26:01,931
trying to...

1458
01:26:05,344 --> 01:26:07,931
Sometimes,

1459
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
the oddest times,

1460
01:26:11,068 --> 01:26:13,137
I'll think I see him,
like in a crowd,

1461
01:26:13,206 --> 01:26:16,965
and this awful, awful dread
fills my throat

1462
01:26:17,034 --> 01:26:18,413
and I feel so guilty.

1463
01:26:19,655 --> 01:26:22,137
But then I think about
how much I loved him.

1464
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:25,724
How much I still love him.

1465
01:26:25,793 --> 01:26:27,758
These things happen.

1466
01:26:27,827 --> 01:26:30,551
We're never gonna really know
why he turned out like that.

1467
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,068
This wasn't you,
this wasn't us.

1468
01:26:32,137 --> 01:26:33,517
I know, I do know.

1469
01:26:33,586 --> 01:26:34,689
Honey, you tried.

1470
01:26:34,758 --> 01:26:37,379
We know how hard
you tried, we all did.

1471
01:26:37,448 --> 01:26:39,275
This is not
what we need anymore.

1472
01:26:40,724 --> 01:26:42,034
Let's get on
with our lives.

1473
01:26:43,275 --> 01:26:45,103
I can't.

1474
01:26:45,172 --> 01:26:47,517
I don't think
I can say goodbye to him.

1475
01:26:47,586 --> 01:26:51,068
We have to, it's time.

1476
01:26:52,758 --> 01:26:54,068
Sweetheart...

1477
01:26:59,068 --> 01:27:00,482
Okay.

1478
01:27:00,551 --> 01:27:03,793
Just give me a minute.

My Teddy bear.

1482
01:27:30,655 --> 01:27:32,413
I tried my best.

1483
01:27:35,206 --> 01:27:36,793
I love you.

1484
01:27:39,862 --> 01:27:43,344
You're always
gonna be with me

1485
01:27:43,413 --> 01:27:45,068
wherever I go.

1486
01:27:48,034 --> 01:27:50,275
Wherever I go.
