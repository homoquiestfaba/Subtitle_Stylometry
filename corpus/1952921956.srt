00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,553
So, yes. 
- Hold on, Clay.

00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,757
And I said to you that my tits 
Could sit? No is no. 

3
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,708
Right, you said no no. 
- But I thought of it. 

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,390
You see it is not. 
Your consent is what opwindt me. 

5
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,475
Here, drink a little. 

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,155
I want you nowhere force, okay? 

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,997
But I go tomorrow studying. 
Maybe I will never see more. 

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,233
And that hurts. 
- We know each other since tonight. 

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,516
Yes, but this is the lot. 

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,073
Men say anything to score. 
- What I feel now is very real. 

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,630
I feel not good. 
- Relax your nou. 

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,233
Do not pressure. 
I am a feminist. 

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,512
Oh, my God. 

14
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,596
Let me help you. 

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,032
Eikel. 

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,471
The rules are: You can not get 
To my belongings, my beer or my weed. 

17
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,919
If you arrive 
Reggaemuziek and you hear ... 

18
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,119
... I am at the poles, 
So then you rot again. 

19
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,748
How is it going? 
- Hi, queer. 

20
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,356
Okay, then. 

21
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,759
That veranda your father took me, 
Twenty years ago. 

22
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,195
What was he still handsome. 

23
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,676
Two years later he was on his proposal, 
In this trap. The impotent dick. 

24
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,957
Mother, like borders. 

25
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,159
Your father disappeared with the diëtiste. 
He pays your graduation not ... 

26
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,348
... Is me ten mille maintenance guilty 
And was as exciting as CNN. 

27
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,988
He is a worthless dick. 

28
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,311
You know, he has never me 
Let klaarkomen. 

29
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,592
Thank goodness you have such verenigingsbeurs. 

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,355
And now you can also still 
Free live. 

31
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,229
I also had a werkstudent can, 
Or work to search. 

32
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,077
Jobs? Please ... 
- Mom, I can do everything. 

33
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,037
Like what? 

34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,308
Lieverd, you are eighteen. 
You were the queen of the schoolbal. 

35
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,870
And then not to study 
And as a waitress? 

36
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,191
That seems a countrylied. 

37
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,237
Mrs. Paul? 

38
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,710

Hi. You are Malcolm Woods, eh?

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,830
So you have the right? 
Good choice.

I am glad that I am here. 
Do what you going to eat? 

45
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,717
Jesus hates me. 

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,998
Getver. 

47
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,072
I already asked me when I bastards 
From school would be. 

48
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,515
And of course, you are the. 

49
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,150
Marjorie, why do you see it as Silly? 
- Because I am now a lesbian, bag. 

50
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,630
So think not that we 
Together again. 

51
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,715
We have twice gone. 
- I do not eat because you groove dumpte me. 

52
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,919
Crticna eat? 
Poesjes-licking. 

53
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,313
Wen only. 

54
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,836
This is nonsense. Just like when you 
Told that you were black. 

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,039
I said that I was adopted. 
- We understand. 

56
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,910
I am Professor Jackson, this is 
Introduction to American civilization. 

57
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,153
Before we begin, 
I want to get to know you a little bit. 

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,710
You there. 
Tell me something about yourself. 

59
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,077
I am Marjorie Simmons 
From Oshkosh, Wisconsin. 

60
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,236
I wish Women's going to do, 
Homosexual with as minor. 

61
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,871
And I say with pride that I 
From the cabinet am vrouwgericht ... 

62
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,998
... And lesbian activist am. 

63
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,594
Do you find that funny, Mr. ... 

64
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,356
Adams. Clay Adams. 
- He thinks that I am not really a lesbian. 

65
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,230
Fascist. 
- And what exactly is a real lesbian? 

66
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,394
A woman who on other women. 

67
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,397
Notice on women, Miss Simmons? 
- I love them. 

68
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,109
That sounds lesbian. 
- That they can not just say so. 

69
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,319
Not if it is not true. 
- And how do you know that? 

70
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,190
Because of our common past. 
- Past? I get the picture. 

71
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,194
So it is his story 
Against that of her. 

72
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,319
Well, you have just the theoretical 
Noted mystery ... 

73
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,917
... Of contemporary society. 
- Have I done? 

74
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,197
The world is a linguistic battlefield. 

75
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,399
Man, woman, 
Gay, straight ... 

76
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,632
... Black, white, 
Penis, vagina. 

77
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,473
We are concerned 
In a symbiotic struggle ... 

78
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,633
... To onuitgewerkte, 
Postmodern definitions. 

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,189
Misunderstand me, Mr. Adams? 

80
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,399
Let me say it: 
Whether you love 'Bush', or not. 

81
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,838
Do you mean the president? 
- That is the problem. 

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,150
You, back. 

83
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,954
I am in the wrong college. 

84
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,073

85
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,715
I have my melkkaart needed. 

86
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,555
Banned, eh?

87
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,478
More or less. 

88
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,592
I am Clay Adams, you overbuur. 
We know each other yet. 

89

Well, you are officially 
My first friend here.

And why do we agree celebrations.

I am not really looking for snollen. 

96
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,911
Oh, so you are still a virgin? 
- Why believe it? 

97
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,959
Every guy who is not on sex ' 
Has not yet done so. 

98
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,510
That is crazy. 
- We go partying. Come on. 

99
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,552
My god, look, girls. 
These are all pictures of 'before'. 

100
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,679
The ugly score you rather?

The ugly think it comes from inside 
Nice, "t takes hours ...

You on their character.

Look Miss Piggy there. 
Watch and learn, buddy.

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,796
Hey. Nice sweater.

105
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,351
Say, what would you like to do now?

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,556
Even good kotsen.

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,958
Yes, well done. 
I saw another two thick girls.

You are so beautiful. Super you my 
Medeaspirant are, in my kamergenote.

110
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,030
What a good thing that you say. Tits? 
- No, those are very natural. 

111
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,351
If I did not like you, 
I would hate you. 

112
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,436
Everything good? 
- Yes, but this is quite overwhelming. 

113
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,433
Yes, the choice is enormous. 
Some guys are good. 

114
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,036
Look Tazwell Thomas there. 
They should be with me.

I am raped 
By the handvaardigheidleraar. 

120
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,990
My grandfather read me poems, 
With me before he went to bed. 

121
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,469
Even something to drink? 

122
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,269
Hey, buddy. Do your best, eh? 

123
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,312
Amanda, you are therefore at Tau's? 
- That's right. 

124
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,790
You seem not so enthusiastic. 
- That I did. 

125
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,157
Four years between urination kots 
Run through. 

126
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,678
So really it's not. You would 't say no, 
But there are best fun lazy. 

127
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,718
And are you one of them? 
- What, I? 

128
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,873
No. But I am rich and white, 
Preses, future lawyer ... 

129
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,032
I am really not cool. 
- I am a stupid blonde. 

130
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,909
Amanda, we are made for each other. 
- Do you? 

131
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,958
Yes, really. 

132
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,360
Two minutes. 
I am so back. 

133
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,431
Day ladies. Serena ... 
Ga-road. 

134
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,233
Can we not make peace? 
- Do you remember the last time? 

135
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,478
I want more freedom. 
- What say you? 

136
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,118
That was the old me. 
I am changed. 

137
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,877
I am more social. Those charges of 
Rape was a good experience. 

138
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,838
And they left the indictment 
Indeed. 

139
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,798
You lult so much out of your neck. 

140
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,159
Look, women damaged, 
To be developed, fanatical virgins ... 

141
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,233
... Flirts, bisexual, politically active 
If everything at once. 

142
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,676
Old-fashioned femininity has disappeared. 
These girls are desperate. 

143
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,796
Say that very much. 

144
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,155
There are 1 0,000 women on campus. 

145
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,632
Where are those types who just 
All night like fuck? 

146
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,189
I am looking for those bad girls. 

147
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,036
Dom, blond, uninhibited, horny. 
Old-fashioned sluts. 

148
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,031
Sletten ... 

149
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,430
Where are those hidden? 

150
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,629
I am a Lion. I give nothing 
Order books, but I was intent pipe. 

151
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,477
When I masturbate, 
I think ondeugend how I am. 

152
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,269
My dispuutsvriendinnen 
Are also real sluts. 

153
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,431
Come on, Clay. 
Pardon me anal. 

154
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,513
Dear heaven. 
Dispuutsmeiden. 

155
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,231
Seriously, Serena. 
I want something serious with a girl. 

156
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,790
Really, as with my aspirante, 
There? 

157
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,599
What, Amanda? 
Yes, that has possibilities. 

158
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,676
So you can deal with a girl 
And her faith remain ... 

159
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,798
... And get to know her 
For your hair fucks? 

160
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,513
Yes. And why do I have to prove that you? 
- I have my sisters. 

161
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,389
Certainly the beautiful blondes, 
As Amanda. 

162
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,551
You look like a lesbian. 

163
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,870
Bitch.

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,510
In my opinion, ie death.

What is so bad? 
- Hello? I am Jewish. 

200
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,873

201
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,075

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,199
Very. 
- About three weeks is a party. 

203
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,990
Bring your boyfriend account 
And let 'm than ruthless. 

204
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,199
Then prove you 
That you are a survivor. 

205
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,275
That you if necessary so disgusting 
And hard can be as a man. 

206
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,193
Rabbi Liebovitz is crazy. 

207
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,679
Here come them. 
- This is crazy. I just feel Ted Bundy. 

208
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,435
Since that girl 't party. 
That is the best. 

209
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,275
Is this not too ambitious? 
- Have you read Darwin? 

210
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,273
Now you know 
Of natural selection in the case. 

211
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,310
If we are like couples, 
We need superior men. 

212
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,838
So we have to sports, or something? 
- No, we must go to an association. 

213
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,278
How can you be mannelijker 
Mannendingen than classical? 

214
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,639
That to me does not. 
- We will make a man of you. 

215
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,952
The celebration is over. Now we 
See if you have enough at home. 

216
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,954
Listen to Mr. Colin, 
Ontgroeningsleider you. 

217
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,272
Welcome to hell. 
Prepare yourself for the first misery. 

218
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,070
Rub on his balls. 

219
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,078
So as men get a band? 

220
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,358
Those two. 

221
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,309
You is not spoon, eh? 

222
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,870
Even five minutes, Mom. 

223
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,838
Damn, you have a ochtenderectie. 

224
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,718
No, hear. 

225
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,913
It is certainly romantic. 

226
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,752
I want death. 

227
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,556
Hey, mietjes. 

228
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,633
Call me you? 

229
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,476
Even for Felicity was' t not so bad. 
- I feel bad. 

230
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,269
Clay, verenigingsgedoe 
Is nothing for me. 

231
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,874
Let us remember that this morning. 

232
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,957
I felt you pile 
Against my thigh, man. 

233
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,353
I want coffee. 

234
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,035
When they hear that I am a Muslim search, 
My parents may no longer be the temple. 

235
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,988
This is wrong. 
I-bale also, but it should. 

236
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,554
Then keep your scholarship, living for free 
And may I talk with you. Everybody wins. 

237
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,111
Anyway, guys do this constantly. 
Think of it as revenge. 

238
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,750
Bedoel you think this makes us stronger, 
As women? 

239
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,196
No idea. I think so. 
What else. 

240
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,992
Well, anyway ... 
Where can I find a gay on me? 

241
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,835
My Dad says that there are gay everywhere. 

242
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,150
Like Mexicans. 

243
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,791
And he there? 
A gay-would use a handkerchief. 

244
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,873
And he then? 
- Let it. 

245
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,792
And that there? 

246
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,997
It has no orientation, I think. 

247
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,232
My God, there. 
Those gay this morning. 

248
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,279
That seems to me not gay. 
- Hoorde music you not? 

249
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,432
Go there. 
Maybe he wants something else. 

250
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,751
It is not so simple. 
- Go. 

251
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,230
And if he is not gay? 
- Then we go to the toneelklas. 

252
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,836
But now Ga. 
- Okay then. Kop closed. 

253
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,677
Hello. I am Amanda. 

254
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,879
Hi, my name is Clay. Pleasant. 
- Similarly. 

255
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,639
Do you love poetry? 

256
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,233
Yes, sure. 

257
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,039
Me too. 
- Nice. 

258
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,398
But I do not know as much as af 
Of gay poetry. 

259
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,917
Gay-poetry? 
- And poetry for lesbians. 

260
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,200
Okay, if that interests you ... 
- Well, not so much interest. 

261
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,232
But I think that homosexuality 
A healthy lifestyle is great. 

262
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,350
And I would like more 
Homosexual friends. 

263
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,351
Exactly, yes. Right. 

264
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,150
Because ... 
- Because homosexuality ... 

265
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,792
... Well? 

266
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,393
Yes, homosexuality can be good. 
I am even more for lesbians. 

267
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,593
But these are all 
Great people. 

268
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,149
So maybe you want to what gay - 
Poetry with me listening, Saturday? 

269
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,356
Very happy. 

270
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,033
Wait. 

271
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,636
Sorry, but this is perhaps 
Coded or something? 

272
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,634
No, the homobijeenkomst, 
Next Saturday. 

273
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,633
You think that I am gay. 
- No. Yes. Wait, I ... 

274
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,358
Are you that? 

275
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,198
Okay, I go back but even ... 
- No, wait. I agree. 

276
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,033
You are a gay? 
- Enormous. 

277
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,589
Great. 
It will be fun, yes. 

278
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,230
Hartstikke beautiful. 
- Saturday, then? 

279
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,035
Come on. It will be fine. 

280
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,596
Okay. 
- Nice. That is, then. 

281
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,272
Girlfriend. 

282
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,628
That is good. 

283
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,709
What was that about? 
- No idea. 

284
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,836
I am just out of the closet. 

285
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,390
I go to to hell. 
- Is he gay? 

286
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,390
Thus gay as it can. 

287
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,189
This can not believe. 
- Girls love gay. 

288
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,194
They are so sensitive. 
Within no time she says: 

289
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,750
"Why are not all men like you? 
Why did you not straight? " 

290
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,550
And then one evening, 
Ladderzat as we are, I say: 

291
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,956
"I said to myself 
I have not held by women. 

292
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,511
But you have changed that. 
Because you become a real man. 

293
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,878
Maybe this life is a lie 
And I am not gay. 

294
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,160
I think I am in love with you. 
Friday with me, please. " 

295
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,792
I must kotsen. 
- Learn dreams of women. 

296
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,236
The gay beft that his best friend. 

297
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,838
You know nothing about gay. 
- There is a praatgroep afternoon. 

298
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,913
That doctrine than I do. 
- Do you have anything other than sex? 

299
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,038
As an excellent book writing, 
Earn one million ... 

300
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,873
... Combat hunger, such things? 
- Exactly. 

301
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,596
I am a scholiertje from Wisconsin. 

302
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,150
My mother drives a bus, 
My Dad works in a supermarket. 

303
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,916
My future will consist of barbecues, 
A not-too-expensive Civic ... 

304
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,833
... And occasionally a pijpbeurt 
From my wife. 

305
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,039
And until I afdaal in that purgatory, 
Is my life ... 

306
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,156
Indeed: as much as possible wippen. 

307
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,915
And do you want to be gay? 
- What therefore, size. 

308
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,550
Go with me, or not? 
- I College. 

309
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,519
You are terribly homophobic. 

310
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,273
I am Sherman Jessup 
And I am President ... 

311
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,468
... From the Lesbian, Gay - 
And Biseksuele Association on campus. 

312
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,156
This meeting is for people 
Who just out of the closet. 

313
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,677
So give us your name 
And your sexual orientation. 

314
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,036
I am Jonas 
And I am homosexual. 

315
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,956
I think. 
- Hello, Jonas. 

316
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,556
Fern. Pot. 
- Hi, Fern. 

317
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,429

And I am homosexual. 
- Hi, Bob. 

321
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,115
You called Clay, worthless bag. 

322
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,591
We still had to be honest? 

323
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,274
Welcome Clay. 

324
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,156
You are not gay, bag. 
What is this? 

325
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,075
Maybe it was our dating. 
That would drop by every guy. 

326
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,593
Fortunately that lasted only two minutes. 
- Come on, I was ladderzat. 

327
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,877
What is this all about? 
- Semiotic warfare. 

328
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,797
Hold on to that nonsense.

329
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,433
Okay then.

Can you find anything?

00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,793
But there is also a kind of guide, 
A handbook for gay? 

335
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,838
Something which is how I 
Should behave and dress? 

336
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,913
We want ourselves can be. 
- That I understood. 

337
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,871
What you need, is gay friends. 
Volume part of our community. 

338
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,077
And then maybe 
A massage from me.

Asa lama cloth, buddy. 

340
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,592
They are not friendly. 

341
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,035
Hey, man of evil. 

342
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,839

343
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,516
Sorry, but who has Saturday 
A date with that gay? 

344
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,309
It is not dating. 
Turn 'm just the hook.

00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,756
Our future depends on. 
- Barrel 't not wrong, but ... 

346
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,071

What I have ever heard. 

347
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,515
I love you, but come on: 

348
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,150
Go out with that gay, see what happens. 
No problem.

Drinking, dancing and the best 
Homosexual men in the city. " 

353
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,634
What's that guidebook? 

354
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,360
If I want to do this, 
The real corpses. 

355
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,353
Come on. 
- And if someone sees us? 

356
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,990
We are not really gay. 
- I am waiting outside. 

357
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,957
What you want. 

358
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,871
I make you relax. 
- Thank you. 

359
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,838
Are you lost, honey? 

360
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,673
Yes. Where is 
The nearest Starbucks? 

361
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,914
Oh, come inside and drink a beer. 
We do not bite. 

362
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,149
It is really easier to hear. 

363
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,514
I wanted formerly 't prefer a mask. 
- Mask, leather pants and tepelklemmen. 

364
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,194
Kop close, trut. 

365
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,433
Let me guess. 
You are just out of the closet, eh? 

366
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,473
Yes, this morning. 

367
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,432
A newcomer. 

368
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,993
I am a gay worthless. 

369
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,594
Why do you say that? 
- Look then. 

370
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,593

I can not dance.

Your language I do not understand. 

372
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,429
Waiting-maid, it's running 
To self-confidence and experience. 

373
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,559
You need 't learn. It is not only ... 
- Sex in your anus. 

374
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,950
Kop closed. 
- Show a little respect. 

375
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,795
I was at Stonewall. 
- I know. Please forgive me. 

376
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,080
The cabinet is a nasty place. 
It is not 'look and know everything. " 

377
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,190
It is a rebirth. You just come out 
Mum's groove, and now you go in the world. 

378
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,155
Rodney? 

379

Would you like me learn? 
- What, honey?

00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,350
You are a little too young for me. 
- Getver, no. 

382
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,235
Give me a metamorphosis.

00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,634
Let's mietje of you. 

384
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,472

00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,439
I can assure you nothing more learning.

00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,312
Great. 

395
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,357
Allemachtig. 
- Hello, Amanda here? 

396
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,832
Who is your friend, Amanda? 
- Serena, this is Clay. 

397
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,995
It is truly an experience. 

398
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,790
Yes, even pleasant. 
Amanda, but we must continue. 

399

... In our own ranks.

410
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,433
I saw this artist in a coffeehouse 
In Oshkosh, Wisconsin ...

00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,309

Sonnetten with its ...

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,268
... How to grow up 
As gay in a small town.

00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,432
He looks like Lance Bass ...

00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,910

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,835
... And is verkeerder than a three - 
Dollar in Rosie O'Donnells bag.

424
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,359
I have not really prepared anything.

Well, this is something 
Which still working.

How should I know? 

428
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,476
That something was not okay. 

429
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,030
Oh, baby, baby. 
I had you do not have to go.

00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,873
And now you are gone.

00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,037
Let me see how you like. 

432
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,149
Tell me, baby. 
Because I must now know. 

433
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,435
Because ... 

434
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,473
My loneliness makes me break. 

435
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,109
Mr. Clay, your action was super. 
- Thank you. 

436
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,592
Thank you, but that big pot was better. 

437
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,435
She was really hot. 
- Definitely. 

438
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,434
Anyway ... 

439
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,998
Do you have a friend? 
-Wie, ik? Nee. 

440
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,196
That is shocking. 

441
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,478
Yes. Well, I try something. 
- What happened? 

442
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,636
He has committed suicide. 

443
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,912
My God. 
- Yes, he was sitting in the very knot. 

444
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,436
I would not talk about. 
And you? Do you have a friend? 

445
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,958
Well, some dispuutsjongen 
Doing his best. He seems very nice. 

446
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,596
Dispuutsjongens ... 
- There are girls like me. 

447
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,830
Girls like you? 

448
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,438
Girls who apparently 'always tap' 
Have on their tits. 

449
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,068
Men are such pigs. 

450
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,428
Oh, well ... 

451
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,309
The worst thing is that I 
Not really resisted. 

452
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,992
Why not? 

453
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,352
Because I am afraid that I 
Am not so special. 

454
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,594
Another queen of the ball with a 
Drunken mother and a versierder as AR. 

455
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,231
And I just go the whole cycle 
In a creative way again. 

456
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,237
You are such a different person 
Than I had expected. 

457
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,315
But that applies to everyone, right? 

458
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,873
Right. 

459
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,594
I can see you, man. 

460
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,599
I wish you a door, then we went 
All night back and forth. 

461
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,552
No, thank you. 
- You are still a virgin, eh? 

462
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,196
State on my forehead or something? 
- Min or more. 

463
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,272
Perhaps, then. 
And what then? 

464
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,273
Maybe sex fascinates me, 
I am a-sexual. 

465
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,476
Maybe you are a gay. 
- Of just sensitive. 

466
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,110
Quietly. 
- Are you not agree ladderzat? 

467
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,193
That is so rough. 
There's a lot more in me than you see. 

468
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,158
I am very intelli coincidence ... 

469
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,112
Is it? 

470
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,037
It's all cut: 
School, relationships, men, women. 

471
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,795
I mean, no one knows exactly 
Who or what he is. 

472
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,236
Let that still grips. 
The here and now is what counts. 

473
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,994
And now I am happy. 

474
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,232
I am healthy, I see there tight, 
I am with you. 

475
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,789
That is good enough for me. 

476
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,713
I talked to my real meaning. 
- Me too. 

477
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,792
Very into my sentence. 
Would you, Bob again? 

478
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,356
It is not strikvraag ... 
- That I know. 

479
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,512
Yes, hear. 
- Really? Do you have a time? 

480
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,752
Okay. Well, sleep tight, then. 

481
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,436
See you later. 

482
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,875
What are you doing now? 

483
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,473
I want you. 

484
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,712
Oh, Matt ... 

485
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,475
What are you doing now? 
- Nothing. 

486
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,472
Man, I am in love. 
- What is it? 

487
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,871
Amanda, she sees me at all. 
I feel it. 

488
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,033
Gay-Clay is cooler than I am. 
He has a lot more guts. 

489
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,271
Will I take a tepelpiercing? 
- You do not see how unfair this is? 

490
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,432
What is happening? 
Do you want it fail? 

491
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:22,118
Do you really that we here in the coming years 
With two sit? 

492
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,917
You are really a zeurnicht. 
Zeuren-Sometimes the only thing you can. 

493
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,790
Mochacinno-break? 

494
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,631
My God. Jessica is a fashion disaster. 

495
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,237
My clothes are also worthless. 
- You need something fucked. 

496
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,755
Like this: Hello. 

497
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,878
Do you love me for a ride? 
- I believe it. 

498
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,951
Pas' m now even. 
- No way. 

499
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,238
Come on, girl. 
Do. For me. 

500
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,871
So, yes. Sun. 
Ready? Watch. 

501
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,675
Looks good. Diagonal stripe. 
Super, this is fun ... 

502
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,273
Just even. 

503
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,514
Beautiful case. 
It looks great. 

504
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,910
What are you doing? 
Is that my dress? 

505
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,312
I hate you. In that dress I 
An ass like a truck. 

506
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,040
You have a beautiful ass. 
- Thank you, Rah. 

507
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,637
Clay, you come to our party? 
- That he finds nothing. 

508
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,394
You know how important it is. 

509
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,594
I am very happy. 
- Saturday. Make sure you are okay? 

510
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,036
A feast so? 

511
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,988

512
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,318
Amanda is gone with her homovriendje. 

513
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,269
What to do with him? 
- Learning how they should pipes. 

514
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,637
Charming as ever. 
- Dwarsgezeten by a rugridder. 

515
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,678
I have everything under control. 

516
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,110
And, what are you doing tonight? 

517
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,796
God, you still want me to bed. 
- Make yourself not wise. 

518
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,553
Why would you do that? 
- Pig. 

519
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,191
Why men hate you so? 
Look like jealous or something. 

520
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,715
You are right. I am jealous. 

521
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,871
Why am I still a common bitch? 

522
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,310
Please forgive me if, Tazwell. 

523
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,793
Serena ... 

524
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,712
Debiel. 

525
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,916
Hey, stranger. 
Want something to eat? 

526
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,116
Day estimates. 

527
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,556
Oh, hello. Let's go. 
- Sorry. I already have plans. 

528
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,395
You must be careful. 
- Thanks, but no. 

529
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,312
Where do we go tonight? 

530
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,995
In a tent where they are not 
Look to my front. 

531
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,555
Such a tent, I do not know. 
- The homobar. 

532
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,158
If you do not prefer to go to the movies? 
- Come, I have never been. 

533
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,879
Beautiful Girls. 
- How are they? Hello, lady. 

534
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,558
This is my BFF: Amanda. 
- Day, baby. Beautiful front. 

535
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,712
Clay, Clay dear ... 
What can I inschenken? 

536
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,555
Tequila, yes? 
Duplicate, please. 

537
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,273
Verdrink that pain but, girl. 

538
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,432
An apple martini. 
- Yes, Madam. 

539
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,956
You know that you schattigste nicht 
On campus? 

540
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,157
Thank you. 
This is Amanda ... 

541
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,353
Want to dance? 
- No, not even. 

542
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,353
Come on ... 
- No. Maybe later. 

543
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,238
Okidoki. 

544
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,552
I see you soon. 

545
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,590
Not your type? 

546
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,752
She is also known as a schijt-souffle. 

547
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,028
What's your type? 

548
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,237
He is not. 

549
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,076
I am you do not stand in the way? 
After all, you may go along with him very much. 

550
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,473
If you want to. 
- Amanda, you are number one tonight. 

551
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,436
Okay, then drink. 

552
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,592
Well, let's dance. Yes? 
- Dance? 

553
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,354
Listen, I have the room. 

554
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,513
I am lying to sleep. 
- Yes, but Amanda and I would like to join. 

555
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,356
You can make a joke. 
- No, this is the night. 

556
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,036
So this is the big moment? 
- I think so. 

557
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,555
What's it like to lie, 
Just a girl fuck? 

558
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,234
It is mental rape. 

559
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,591
That is not it. 
I think its really super. 

560
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,116
Why are you not happy for me? 
- Because I ... 

561
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,194
Nothing. You are a bag. 

562
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,996
Hi. Matt, right? 
- Yes. See you later. 

563
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,720
Bring it inside. 

564
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,754
Shit, I fear me rot. 
- What are you doing here? 

565
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,876
What are you doing here? 

566
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,716
Well, do you want to fuck? 

567
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,633
Well ... 

568
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,550
Do you worry if I even go? 
- Not at all. 

569
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,990
I am Saturday, I think. 
- Is everything okay? 

570
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,714
Damn, I am a nichtenmoeder. 

571
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,391
I am actually off 
Why not all men are like you. 

572
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,837
What am I doing here, Clay? 
- What do you mean? 

573
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,350
I think you really fun. 

574
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,554
I think you also fun. You are 
Geweldigste the person that I know. 

575
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,676
No, you do not understand. 

576
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,274
I find fun. 

577
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,598
I could not. 
This may not. 

578
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,959
Why? Because I am gay? 
- No. Yes. This is true not. 

579
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,635
It is not fair to you. 
And it is unfair. 

580
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,836
Wait. 

581
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,514
I must tell you something. 
- Not. 

582
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,191
I must go. 

583
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,991
Do not pressure. 
That just happens. 

584
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,350
You think that I am a gay am, eh? 

585
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,551
Although it, then that's not a problem. 

586
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,235
Gay is nothing special. 
You stinks even if you poept. 

587
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,959
And we know who you want to fuck. 
- Who then? 

588
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,590
You hold anyone for a ride. 

589
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,675
So really is not. 

590
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,033
You are not so bad when you are sober. 
- Not nadaljuje. 

591
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,358
Later. 

592
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,714
Serena, you have a moment? 

593
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,871
Give us even, Tanya. 

594
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,950
She has magic fingers. 

595
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,995
Sun. What is there, Amanda? 
- Over the freaks Party ... 

596
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,755
My guy is not me. 
- You are in love with 'm. 

597
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,639
No, but it is simply nothing. 

598
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,831
My nicht married a gay. 
She knew nothing of his preference ... 

599
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,197
... Until it was him betrapte 
With his best friend. 

600
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,194
They flipte, ran the streets 
And was hit by a truck. 

601
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,873
Today she is not mentally. 

602
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,591
And thus do you mean ... 
- I mean, word awake. 

603
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,311
Gay's manipulating women. 
- If Clay is not. 

604
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,916
Good. Let's say 
That he is gay-so specify. 

605
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,550
Do you think he can? 
He has snikkel tasted ... 

606
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,918
... And that he would like to again, 
Because gay men are still. 

607
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,312
But why do we use them not yet 
Costs to be offensive. 

608
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:05,476
Listen. It is part of the Tau. 
In fact you are here for free. 

609
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,873
Stop you study and you vergooi 
Your life for a gay? 

610
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,509
You are such a beautiful, sensitive girl. 

611
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,670
You hear here, with your sisters. 

612
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,311
Okay, I have to college. 
- Okay then. Forwards it. 

613
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,470
I see you next week. 

614
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,278
Can I talk about my essay? 

615
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,035
Your vision of Huckleberry Finn 
Left to be desired. 

616
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,715
Huck and Jim as homosexual lovers? 
Please ... 

617
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,599
You wanted something new, 
Something revolutionary? 

618
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,629
You have only the analysis. 
In fact, your essay conventional. 

619
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,314
Revolutionary? I thought not. 

620
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:14,154
Hey, where did you yourself hidden? 
- Somewhere behind the rainbow. 

621
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,269
You can notice that gay, eh? 

622
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:23,474
I just want to ensure 
That nobody right for me. 

623
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:29,078
It might be simpler than that 
Intimate with someone who is right for you. 

624
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,837
And who fits there with me? 
- Someone who is not gay. 

625
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,470
If I do all doubt, 
I go to the roof of our house. 

626
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,189
I look at the stars, 
Listen to the wind ... 

627
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,955
I smoke a cigarette 
And then it all falls however. 

628
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:52,989
Then I just had the time needed 
To the forced expulsion nonsense. 

629
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,556
But then that moment passed. 
- But there will be another. 

630
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,473
You simply 
Appreciate the small learning. 

631
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:07,235
Like what? 
Like ... Staren to a cheeseburger. 

632
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,949
Wetend that nothing is 
Like that first bite. 

633
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,671
Or if you stoned hits and you realize: 
Hey, I was stoned. 

634
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:21,233
Or when a white plastic bag 
See running around in the wind. 

635
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,234
You are really difficult. 
- But I can cry like a girl. 

636
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,635
This is such a moment for me. 

637
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,828
Here are with you, thinking: This is 
Why God has created women. 

638
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,753
That I would prefer not want to be. 

639
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,118
That I would want to do nothing more 
Then you kiss. 

640
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,356
Are you trying to save me, Tazwell? 

641
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,637
Let's eindje. 

642
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,313
Amanda, with Clay ... 

643
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,669
We must talk. 
Call me back? 

644
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,909
Damn ... 
- You look cute. 

645
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,756
I fear destroy me. 
Few gay-here's me. 

646
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,356
Well, I am different. 
- What about a kiss? 

647
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,637
I thought not. 
Plague-nou. You want it. 

648
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,268
God said that you do not really? 

649
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,159
Come on, now. 
- Sherman, I said no. 

650
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,515
I want you. 
- Word I raped? 

651
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,989
That may not, as the other it wants. 

652
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,909
My God, Clay. 
Hey, stop. Come Back. 

653
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,310
Clay, what is there? 

654
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,473
Help. 
Help still, please. 

655
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,916
How often should I 't repeat? 

656
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,356
I saw dispuutsjongens 
With sticks and chains. 

657
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:06,595
They attacked Clay and then fled. 
One called it 'billenmaat'. 

658
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,352
'Billenmaat'? 

659
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,113
Clay, you have to continue. 
- Everything is okay. What is this? 

660
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,511
Mr. O'Brien says that dispuutsjongens 
You attack. 

661
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,275
What? Brennan. . . 
- It was dark and it was fast. 

662
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,273
But I know what I saw. I think. 

663
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,274
But you confuse me. 
Kende-the so-called attackers? 

664
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,558
Why 'supposedly'? 
- Kende them, they wanted to get to know you ... 

665
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,679
So he has provoked this? 
He's the victim, homophobic. 

666
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,638
Cessation. 
What is it? 

667
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,438
This is a nightmare. 

668
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,910
Listen, I fell. 
There was no attack. 

669
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,038
Not doing this is not good. 
- Go home. 

670
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,317
You hear when 't problem 
Or in the solution. 

671
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,950
Wegwezen. Now. 
- Okay then. 

672
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,999
But you hear more from me. 
Definitely. 

673
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,952
What you will. Well, can I go now? 
Case closed? 

674
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,590
You should get out at the sister. 
And do me a lol: 

675
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,228
Run your careful next time? 

676
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,313
Stelletje queers. 

677
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:19,112
We exhibit If These Walls Could Talk II, 
Followed by a discussion. 

678
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,593
Clay Adams came against potenrammers 
And the campuspolitie silent about it. 

679
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,990
Discrimination. 
- Clay? Is everything okay? 

680
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,199
Great, but he should be no indictment. 
He denies' t even. 

681
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,399
How do you know there? 
- I was there. 

682
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,870
Here they are not gone. 
- Quietly, now. 

683
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,316
You argue too quiet. 
- Bessie, now silent. 

684
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,076
I am silent. 
Drieduizend years. 

685
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,437
This is world war three, 
Red alert. 

686
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,151
Let us all minorities calls 
And will demonstrate. 

687
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,629
Who is this: say yes. 

688
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,076
Motion adopted. Gay, 
Call the African American Society. 

689
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,314
Bi's: the Women's Center. 
Transseksuelen: call Halel and El Club. 

690
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,393
Pots, call the Young Communists 
And the Straight Men For Change. 

691
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:15,634
This is not just a gay affair. 
- Let the dragon loose. 

692
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,349
Do not put in a corner. 
- We are fighting back. 

693
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,432
We are fighting back. 

694
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,030
Why you called me back? 

695
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,830
Sorry, I had the pressure. 
I have now hurry, so I can still speak. 

696
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,276
And the party tonight? 

697
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,715
Oh yes, the party ... 

698
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,953
It is not a good idea if you will. 
Because Tazwell also, and ... 

699
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,069
What's going on? 

700
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,359
I can no longer, Clay. 
Please forgive me. 

701
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,871
Your turn. 

702
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,510
Where's Clay? 
- That is over. 

703
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,750
You are klos. 
- And? 

704
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,994
Amanda, where is the boy? 
- Listen Serena, I ... 

705
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:05,199
You know what's so gay. 
They are still working longer than girls. 

706
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,632
Jackpot. 

707
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,718
Well, I hope he comes soon. 

708
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:22,519
I have now gone. 
- Do you really do that? 

709
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,476
And you, then? 

710
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,396
What are you doing here? 
- We should talk, okay? 

711
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,550
Is this a costumed party? 
- You need to go. 

712
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,757
Even it. I must tell you something. 
- Later, okay? 

713
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,956
It can not wait. 

714
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,108
What is happening? 
- Listen ... 

715
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,469
What? What is it then? 

716
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,588
Through you I feel a real man. 

717
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,672
Maybe I am not really gay. 

718
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,354
What are you talking about? 
Come on, what? 

719
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,479
Amanda, I am in love with you. 
- What? 

720
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:18,236
I am in love. 
- No, that's not saying. Stop. 

721
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,514
Well done, Amanda. 

722
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,353
What is here on? 

723
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,994
Rah, come back now. 

724
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,630
Thursday nou. 
- No, I love you. 

725
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,111
This is through card. 

726
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,558
Please forgive me. 

727
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,153
It is hilarious. 

728
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,550
Clay, please ... 

729
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,472
Welcome sister. 

730
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,391
Is everything okay? 

731
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,236
What's wrong? 
- I am in love with you. 

732
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,758
Of course not. 

733
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,155
That was bizarre, man. 

734
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,830
Listen, you are just Saturday. 
Doe equally easy ... 

735
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,679
You know what it's like to share a room 
With a hetero ... 

736
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,719
... That the largest gay on earth? 
That is zaniè. 

737
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,917
It is unfair. 

738
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,556
Why am I so bad? 
- Net you seemed pretty good at it. 

739
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,915
I just wanted ... 
- Come on, Matt. 

740
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,678
Make this is not even stranger. 

741
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,028
You know what? 
Get the klere it. 

742
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,874
Power to the people, man. 

743
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,230
Well done, girl. 

744
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,751
My God. 

745
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,669
Victims of discrimination 

746
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,960
Goh, Clay, eh? 
- I want to do so anxious to call. 

747
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,556
But he wants me, not talk. 
- Remember him now. 

748
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,156
You need to find someone you 
Happy. That you earn. 

749
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:02,075
Someone like Taz. You still 
With him to the inauguratiefeest, eh? 

750
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,755
Let's now that gay loose. 
- Perhaps you are right. 

751
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,639
Rah Have you spoken yet? 
- Yes, dialed. 

752
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,395
He called me a slut Jewish 
And when he hung on. 

753
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,791
Yes, what does it matter. 

754
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,028
I am here, dear. 
I leave you never loose. 

755
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,273
Okay ... 
Do you have a minute? 

756
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,318
Be proud, my gay brother. 

757
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,755
Marjorie? Stop it. 

758
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,912
I tried to reach you. 
Everything good? 

759
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,312
What is all this? 
- You have been attacked, bitch. 

760
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:45,110
No, that was me zaniè-Sherman tricky. 
- O my goddess. 

761
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,748
And I must tell you something. 

762
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,280
I am not really gay. 
- I knew it. 

763
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,557
It was me to a girl. 
- That is bi-zar, Clay. 

764
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,234
It is a long story. 
Can we stop this? 

765
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:03,111
You are a bastard. This demonstration 
Takes place. With or without you. 

766
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,711
Wen only. You are Rosa Parks 
Of the gay movement. 

767
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,317
It does not even somewhere. 
- This is politics. You do not. 

768
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:21,235
I have a song about you. 
Lazer-op. 

769
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,796
Greek inauguratiefeest 
Welcome brothers and sisters 

770
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,390
It seems the schoolbal did. 

771
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,075
Do I have my partner fuck 
On a golf course? 

772
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,878
Today is a gay. 

773
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,554
Tomorrow is the one black. 

774
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,917
Or a Latino. 
Or a jew. 

775
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,117
Or that guy in that wheelchair. 

776
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,912
Think of Clay. 
- Stop the hate, thinking of Clay. 

777
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,675
Stop the hate, thinking of Clay. 

778
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,637
Got it to you in the mood? 

779
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,399
Yes, it's great. 

780
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:47,395
View these fine people there agree. 
It looks beautiful, Amanda. 

781
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,678
Could I borrow him? 
I need help for the party. 

782
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,876
Sure. 
- Super. 

783
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,429
Taz? 
- I would take back. 

784
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,149
Professor Jackson, what are you doing here? 

785
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,118
Do you want a hoisting? 

786
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:09,149
Sorry, Taz. 
My gums do too much. 

787
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,799
Hey, you can not make. 

788
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,790
You are not really gay, eh? 

789
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,391
How do you know that? 

790
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:28,429
I work here for six years. 
I recall nephomo's really there. 

791
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,999
You will find me ridiculous. 

792
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,316
If you are nineteen ... 
Who is it not? 

793
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,278
You all want 
Someone else. 

794
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:44,069
Everything for the inevitable 
To escape justice. 

795
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,671
What is it? 
- That your worst fears come true. 

796
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,195
That you really are but who you are. 

797
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,989
That your own identity 
Overtakes you again. 

798
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:00,790
And before you know it, 
Your life consists of nothing more ... 

799
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,714
... Then unpaid bills, 
Unfilled desires ... 

800
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,350
Children ... you should feed 
And long silences. 

801
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:13,036
This is the worst 
Thing I have ever heard. 

802
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,153
Sorry, I would not be didactic. 

803
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,233
When I graduated, I 
Dancer. And I was good. 

804
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,234
Tapdansen, ballet, jazz ... 
But I stopped it. 

805
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,278
I came with my fat ass 
Not on Broadway. 

806
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:34,150
And here I am now. 
On the floor with you. 

807
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,951
Maybe it will be for me ... 
- What? 

808
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,599
I do not know ... 

809
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,833
Anders. 

810
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,154
You wanted to be a revolution? 
Proof it. Be brave. 

811
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,352
I have to go. 

812
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,393
Yes, hear. 
End of lesson. 

813
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,871
You are cool, Professor Jackson. 
- You too. 

814
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,671
We will see who dispuutslui 
What real power is. 

815
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,355
Bestorm the party. 

816
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,030
Hey, there you are. 
I was looking for you al 

817
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,191
I am an idiot. 

818
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,912
Get the klere. 

819
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:53,510
I did it for you, Amanda. 
You should know what he is a bag. 

820
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,274
You mean so much to me. 

821
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,908
Let those guys oprotten. 
We have no need for them. 

822
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:04,234
You know what? If you want me to bed, 
You should simply ask. 

823
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,870
What do you say? That is disgusting. 
I am not a lesbian. 

824
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,999
How can you say that now? 
I am not a lesbian. 

825
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:16,358
I have to go. 
- I am not. I am not. 

826
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,193
No justice, 
No peace. 

827
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,195
The hours of vengeance has come, 
Bastards. 

828
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:50,714
Hey, stop this. 
What are you doing now? Stop. 

829
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,830
I am Clay Adams. 

830
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,070
This is nonsense. 
There were no potenrammers. 

831
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,994
Sherman Jessup fell to me 
Not when I 'm wanted to play. 

832
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,833
He wanted 't themselves. He flirtte with me. 

833
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,596
If a man or woman 'no' says, 
They mean 'no'. Klootzak. 

834
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,437
Stay of myself. 
Not to my her. 

835
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,990
Listen, I ... 

836
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,714
I am just a sukkel, 
Who did as if he was a gay. 

837
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,359
So that a girl would see me. 

838
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,589
I am in love with her. 

839
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,313
Yes, I love her. 
Because I am not gay. 

840
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:53,508
I have thought about it. 
But it was nothing for me. 

841
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,951
Do not forget it. 
- I love a kamelenboer. 

842
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,398
Okay, let's stop this. 
This is my fault. 

843
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:14,509
Look around you. 
You do not differ so much. 

844
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,592
Do you see who is next to you? 
Give them a knuffel. 

845
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,150
I believe it. 
We turn it into a massive knuffel. 

846
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,673
Forget it. 
Head-close, pot. 

847
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,832
That I thought not. You dirty ... 

848
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,078
Amanda, wait. 
Can I please explain? 

849
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,152
What? That you lied to me you 
Could sew? I get the picture. 

850
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,390
But this Saturday not. 

851
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,279
Or rather ... Yes. 
But when it became more. 

852
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:57,831
And you lied. 
- Okay, we lied both. Can I leave? 

853
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,279
Let me now thuisbrengen. 
- To Pittsburgh? Because there go I go. 

854
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,114
So your flight to your Mommy? 

855
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,599
Well ... 
Zak but in the shit. 

856
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,274
Amanda ... 
- Do not behind me. 

857
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,032
Rotjong. 

858
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,550
I did not know you were here. 

859
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,632
Wait. 

860
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:56,030
Will it ever return to normal between us? 
- No idea. 

861
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,950
I am sorry, man. 

862
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,271
What then? 
That you do not want to suck my dick? 

863
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,995
Yes, that I am sorry. 

864
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,156
I should be glad. 

865
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,993
And if they could, 
, I would go for you. 

866
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:32,072
Because if I would fall on men ... 

867
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,230
... I was the happiest guy 
On earth. 

868
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,710
What are you still a banal male. 

869
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,110
I tried seriously. 

870
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,876
Shall I tell you something? 

871
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,238
You really terribly bad coast. 
- Rot on, man. 

872
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,312
Meen you know? 

873
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,516
Come on now, I was Saturday. 

874
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,757
You had to wait outside. 
- And if someone sees me? 

875
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,876
Wen only. 

876
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,991
Not yet out of the closet ... 
But with a mouth like a vacuum cleaner. 

877
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,515
You deserve it, measure.

878
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,913
Well ... 

879
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,437
Could I even our room? 

880
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,034
What's happened with you? 
It looks like a pot. 

881
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,079
Can I help you? 
- Oops, someone has problems. 

882
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,037
What is there, guy? 

883
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,994
I must tell you something. 
- Well ... 

884
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,799
You are the daughter I never had. 
Toe but. 

885
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,511
I am in love with a girl. 

886
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,672
What do you say? 

887
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,319
I lied to you. 
I am not gay. 

888
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:24,398
Even slowly. Are you straight? 
- I am sorry. 

889
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:30,394
Are you angry now? 
- No, I am not angry. 

890
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:35,156
You do not know what 't for me means 
That a hetero want to be homosexual. 

891
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,995
That is something beautiful. 
Since we already struggling for so long. 

892
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:43,716
I am so happy, I can get janken. 

893
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,473
But why would you 
Want to be a gay? 

894
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:52,156
So that Amanda would fall on me. 
- The nichtenmoeder? Slim, hear. 

895
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,755
Now they hate me. 
- But not when you are gay. 

896
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,879
That does not matter. 
What no-one is gay or straight. 

897
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:07,354
What counts is whether you are violently. 
And very magnificent. 

898
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,238
Think really after. 

899
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:14,551
You know who you are. 
That is so valuable. 

900
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:18,076
I would give my right arm 
To feel that again. 

901
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,356
Because before you know ... 

902
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,514
... Time has gone. 

903
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,636
What should I do? 

904
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,993
Be the guy who you are. 

905
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,717
Intense. 

906
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,548
I thought you had already left. 
- M 'n bus is too late. 

907
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,158
How is it with you? 

908
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,232
The Tau have me my scholarship decreased. 
My mother is evil. 

909
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,279
But my aunt arranged work 
At a cosmetics department, so ... 

910
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,398
I referred: How is it with you? 
- That I know well. 

911
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,757
I am ruined. 

912
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,836
We both. 

913
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:55,791
You think, 
Me that you absolutely do not know. 

914
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,391
But believe me: 
That I could be your friend ... 

915
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,312
... This is the best 
What ever overcome me. 

916
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:11,110
Maybe you think nonsense, 
But I think ... 

917
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,394
... That I am by that gay-stalking 
A decent hetero. 

918
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,320
I miss it really, are you. 

919
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:37,036
I am the same guy. 
- But who is it? 

920
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:45,230
Just a guy. 
Just another crazy guy. 

921
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,796
That top is great. 

922
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:04,430
I have no doubt about the colour. 
- Really? It fits well with your eyes. 

923
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:09,276
The bleed is daring ... 
It is a brave choice. 

924
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,750
I see there are good, eh? 
- Definitely, girl. 

925
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,954
Now everything is different. 

926
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,870
I hope so but. 

927
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,917
The Palestinians must be free. 
- There are children dead. 

928
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,675
That is because the Zionisten. 
- Keep your head and fuck me. 

929
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,311
Thank you very much. 

930
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,756
Day, ladies. 
Go now sit, we do not bite. 

931
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,515
Unless you want to. 
Head-close, trut. 

932
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:33,832
You are quite gay, eh? 
- Absolutely. 

933
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,719
What have you done? 
- Aanranding. 

934
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,189
Yes, I too. 
Leugenachtige babes ... 

935
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,830
Right. He wanted it yourself. 
- What? 

936
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,518
Fern, massaging me. 

937
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,039
Hey, piece. 

938
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,156
You have missed your bus. 

939
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,631
There will still be one.
