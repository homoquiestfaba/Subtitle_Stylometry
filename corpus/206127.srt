00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,678
<i>More than the greatest love the world</i>
- Good morning, Mrs. Levin.

2
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,096
Good morning, Danny.

3
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,472
<i>Has known

4
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,474
- Where have you been?
- I was getting bubble gum.

5
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,351
Okay, good.
Get the bag. Get the bag.

6
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,813
Instead of spending all that money on
space travel, they could just end the war.

7
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,064
Alison, can we talk politics...

8
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,941
...after we pack the car?
- Feel like I'm gonna give birth.

9
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,818
Marty, could you help your mother
with the kitchen things?

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,696
Mom, this is a process,
a scientific process, okay?

11
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,864
I'm gonna start to pack...

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,783
Ma, what is the point of me
having a plan for the backseat...

13
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,411
- Here you go, Daddy.
- Come on. This is serious.

14
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,582
- I need my record player!
- You can live without it for two weeks.

15
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,500
It's bigger
than last year!

16
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,377
- Stop it!
- You stop it!

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,921
- Okay, okay! Knock it off.
- He's pushing me!

18
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,131
Be good to each other.

19
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,383
Alison, move over. Give
your brother some room.

20
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,262
- Why do I always have to move?
- We're too crowded!

21
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,889
That's the beauty of
the whole thing, darling.

22
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,891
Crowded is good.

23
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,059
- Enough already!
- She started it.

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,436
There's nothing
to do up there.

25
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:46,565
Why do we always have to do the
same stupid thing every summer?

26
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,734
- Children, please!
- That's a good question. Pearl.

27
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,403
Why do we do the same
stupid thing every summer?

28
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,280
Because we do.

29
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,742
- Can I have my sandwich now?
- Danny, 1 hour, 11 min. to the Red Apple sign.

30
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,244
- Are you paying attention?
- That's a record, Daddy.

31
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,623
Danny, Danny, bo-banny
Banana, fanna, fo-fanny

32
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,292
Fee, fi, fo-manny
Danny

33
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:10,214
Alison, Alison, bo-balison
Banana, fanna, fo-falison

34
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,049
- Sing! Sing!
- Daddy!

35
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,594
Sing or I'm gonna crash!
If you don't sing, I'm gonna crash!

36
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,096
Keep your eyes
on the road!

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,891
- That's better. - Let's do Chuck.
- No Chuck. We don't do Chuck.

38
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,476
You never let me do Chuck.

39
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,062
When you're married,
you can do Chuck. Right, baby?

40
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:31,818
<i>No one else
could love you more

41
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:36,031
<i>Than the greatest love
the world has known

42
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,824
Ma! Hippies!

43
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,702
<i>This is the love
that I give to you

44
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,539
Some feckuckteh
hairdos they have.

45
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:47,209
- Ow! Get off!
<i>More than the single words</i>

46
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,337
<i>I try to sing

47
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,090
<i>I only live to love you

48
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,926
<i>More each day

49
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,804
<i>More than you'll ever know

50
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,099
<i>My arms got to hold you so

51
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,811
<i>My life will be
in your keeping

52
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,231
<i>Waking, sleeping
Laughing, weeping

53
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,485
<i>Longer than always
is a long, long

54
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,529
<i>Long time

55
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,322
<i>But far beyond forever

56
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,033
<i>Welcome back to
Dr. Fogler's, everyone.

57
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:24,204
<i>The Fourth of July barbecue
will be held by the lake at 6:00.

58
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,457
<i>At 6:00 for the
Fourth of July barbecue.

59
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,752
Let's see how fast you can put the hoop down
and get the pot inside the bungalow, ready?

60
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,338
On your mark, get set, go!
Go. Go, go, go, go, go!

61
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,507
Daddy, tell me how fast
we got here.

62
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,093
3 hours and 42 minutes with a
corned beef on rye at the Red Apple.

63
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,680
2 hours and 23 minutes with
salami and eggs at the Red Apple.

64
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,682
- Bullshit.
- 1 hour and 57 minutes...

65
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,185
with two hot dogs and mustard
and sauerkraut at the Red Apple.

66
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:46,810
Bullshit!

67
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,396
- Stop saying that word, Daddy.
- I'm sorry, Danny.

68
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,399
But Fogler is such a liar.
Come on. An hour and 57 minutes?

69
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,860
Who can do it in an hour
and 57 minutes? Nobody.

70
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,405
Let's go swimming! Let's go
swimming! Let's go swimming!

71
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,241
- Did we forget the onions?
- Look in the A&P bag.

72
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,328
- I am not sharing a room with him.
- You're not wearing that shirt.

73
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,414
- What's wrong with it?
- Just change it before you go out.

74
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:11,001
- These onions are mushy.
- Mother, I have to have privacy.

75
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:15,214
- Where's my wooden bowl?
- I'm not sleeping in the same room with his guns!

76
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,300
Cap guns, Alison.
I think Joan Baez will forgive you.

77
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,052
Enough, enough.
I'll sleep with you in the bedroom.

78
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,721
- Daniel, you sleep in the kitchen.
- No!

79
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,765
Don't give me no.
Not too much salt.

80
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,351
Daniel, let your sister
get changed.

81
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,646
- Get changed. Go ahead.
- Why did I even have to come here?

82
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,858
<i>Attention, everyone.
The ice cream man is on the premises.

83
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,612
<i>The ice cream man
is on the premises.

84
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,450
Can I look like that
when I grow up?

85
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,161
You looked like that,
I wouldn't be your friend.

86
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,040
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Oh, my goodness, why, thank you.

87
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,667
How many calories
in this again?

88
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,628
You're gorgeous, too, Pearl, but
you hide your light under a bushel.

89
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,879
- Alison!
- What?

90
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,423
You asked me to change,
and I changed.

91
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,385
- I see Alison's nipples.
- Shut up!

92
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,971
Just make sure you're back in time
for the barbecue, young lady.

93
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,431
I don't believe in July 4th.
It's patriotic puke.

94
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,393
This is Daddy's last chance to be
with us. He's gonna be working all week.

95
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,938
Well, it's not my fault he's
a slave to the establishment.

96
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,482
Could you just for one afternoon
put aside your beliefs?

97
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,360
It's easy for you to say,
'cause you don't have any!

98
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,240
I can't believe
we have a teenager.

99
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,660
- We're old.
- Not old. She's old.

100
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,330
She's almost the age
I was when I had her.

101
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,504
I just don't want her
to wind up like us.

102
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,099
What's wrong with us?

103
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,810
Marty...

104
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,316
This whole decade's gone by, and the most
important decision I make during any week...

105
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,110
is whether or not to go
to the A&P or Waldbaum's.

106
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,114
That's easy, A&P.
Their Wing Dings are fresher.

107
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,701
I'm serious.

108
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,536
I know.

109
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,374
You're lettin' her
get you crazy, Pearl.

110
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,252
Don't let her
get you crazy.

111
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,047
Yeah.

112
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,517
Yeah.

113
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:36,480
<i>Attention, everyone.
At 2:00 in the casino,

114
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,943
<i>Bernie and Shirley Pike will be
showing slides of Reuben's bar mitzvah.

115
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,654
<i>That's 2:00.</i>
- How does your week look?

116
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,614
Same as always.

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,034
Anything new happening
at the shop?

118
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,829
Nothing new happens
at the shop ever.

119
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,250
I was just asking.

120
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,963
- I wish you could stay longer.
- I know, so do I.

121
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,091
Why won't you
talk with Sid? Just...

122
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,469
Please, don't start
with that now, okay?

123
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,514
Just ask for a few days.

124
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,641
Neil gets a whole week
off in August.

125
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,393
Yeah, well...

126
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,770
Neil doesn't have
a boss like Sid,

127
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,691
and Neil doesn't have
two kids to feed, all right?

128
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,825
You have enough cash?

129
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,910
I'm fine.

130
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:37,457
Your mother's wooden bowl, the scratchy
blue blanket. That's the heavy one.

131
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,044
We need the big thermos.
Not the blue ones.

132
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,212
And Alison wants
her shampoo.

133
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,047
Bye, Neil!

134
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,300
- See ya, sweetie.
- Miss us.

135
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,428
- Bye, Marty.
- I wrote it down.

136
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,390
- Neil, what time you got?
- 7:35.

137
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,351
- Set. Go.
- Bye, Dad.

138
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,021
Bye, sweetie.
Give me a kiss.

139
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,940
- Call me, okay?
- All right.

140
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,235
- Six dot.
- Come on, Pearl. You remember what it was like.

141
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,573
- It was never like that.
- What? You weren't a teenager?

142
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,159
For about two weeks.
East.

143
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,119
It's the marijuana
you have to watch out for.

144
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,288
Sooner or later,
they all smoke marijuana.

145
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,083
You get ants in your pants.
You wanna screw everything in sight.

146
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,172
Oh, that's beautiful.
Green.

147
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:29,510
Is that supposed to comfort me?
<i>The Blouse Man is on the premises.</i>

148
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,137
Here we go.
<i>The Blouse Man is on the premises.</i>

149
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,682
- This make me look too busty?
- There's no such thing as too busty.

150
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,851
Give me a bigger size.

151
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,145
Here's your bigger size.

152
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,814
- Very funny.
- Oh!

153
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,610
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,946
It's just blouses.
Don't worry about it.

155
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,741
- Let me help.
- I got it. Can I help you find something?

156
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,203
- No, thanks.
- Wait, Lillian. That's the one I wanted.

157
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,373
Excuse me.
You got another one of these?

158
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,417
No, ladies.
I'm sorry. I don't.

159
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,838
You gonna hold on to this
the rest of the afternoon?

160
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,593
Ma'am, what's your name?

161
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,804
Selma.

162
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,308
- You want my honest opinion, Selma?
- Yeah.

163
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:22,020
With those sea-green eyes, I think you're
better off with a lighter color anyway.

164
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,024
Excuse me.
Check this out.

165
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,734
See this?

166
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,611
Look. Look at that.

167
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:33,323
With that shade of green,
you're practically sparklin'.

168
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,867
- All right?
- Oh, yeah.

169
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,535
They sparkle, Selma.

170
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:40,163
I tell you what. Since you ladies have
been such good sports about this,

171
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,790
consider these blouses a gift.

172
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,586
Thank you. You're a
very nice young man.

173
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,254
You're welcome.

174
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:51,967
Thank you, but I don't need a gift. However,
this blouse is not worth more than $5.

175
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,760
That's cool.

176
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,930
- You want the hanger?
- Do you need it?

177
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,601
No. You take it.

178
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,853
I hope you like the blouse.

179
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,610
That's a strange way
of doing business.

180
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:14,072
A little promotion.
It'll even out in the end.

181
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:20,245
Excuse me, mister.
You got this in red?

182
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:24,791
Only in a 16. Yellow looks
pretty good to me.

183
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,878
- I'm not really a yellow kind of a girl.
- No?

184
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,214
What kind of girl are ya?

185
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,092
How about that yellow?

186
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,395
What happened
to the old Blouse Man?

187
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,272
Oh, he retired.

188
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,150
I bought his bus
and his route.

189
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,987
He had more variety.

190
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,990
- Did he?
- Carried a little something extra each time.

191
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,952
Jewelry or... sunglasses.

192
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,912
Think so, huh?

193
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,415
Well, all right.
Thanks for the tip.

194
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:07,584
Tadpoles!

195
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,421
Tadpoles over here right now.
Salamanders, stop the noise.

196
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,006
Hurry up.
Go right over here.

197
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,968
Tadpoles, you're behaving
very, very well.

198
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,928
Danny!
Put away the guns!

199
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,930
Jeffrey, would you
take his guns away?

200
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,890
Danny, you're not supposed
to bring guns to camp.

201
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,434
It'll just be
another minute, okay?

202
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,772
- Do orthodox girls have to wear wigs?
- It looks like a wig.

203
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,024
- Hey.
- What's up, Myra?

204
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,068
- This is my friend Carl.
- How ya doin'?

205
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,028
- You a counselor over here?
- Yeah, as always.

206
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,447
- I gotta go. Nice meetin'ya.
- Nice meeting you.

207
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,492
- I gotta go too. I'll see you later.
- All right. I'll see ya.

208
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,911
- Butterflies.
- Okay, butterflies, time to go.

209
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,414
Does anybody know who
that little girl is over there?

210
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,875
Is there anybody's
mother around?

211
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:54,256
What group do you have?
I have the chipmunks.

212
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,218
What's the
lifeguard's name?

213
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,183
Sorry. Just checking
to see if it's a wig.

214
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,101
We didn't mean
anything by it.

215
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:10,063
- You shouldn't make fun of other people.
- I'm sorry.

216
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,149
Right over here!

217
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,067
Okay.

218
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,320
- It's Ross Epstein.
- Skunks.

219
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,155
All right, skunks.
Come on. Let's go. It's us.

220
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,741
Come on. Come on.

221
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,580
<i>It's not a good morning, Colonel.
There's a radio hidden.

222
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:30,292
<i>A radio is against the orders
of the Imperial Nipponese Army.

223
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,883
<i>There is a radio in this hut.

224
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,678
What?

225
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,098
This is so boring.

226
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:48,685
<i>I order those responsible
to hand it over immediately.

227
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,773
<i>Asking you just once more,
where is it hidden?

228
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,984
<i>Where is what hidden, sir?
I know nothing about a wireless.

229
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,528
<i>Then, by God, you should!

230
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,781
<i>I'll have you court-martialed,
and it'll show on your record.

231
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,909
<i>- Ralph, what do you know about this?
- Nothing.

232
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,078
I just feel like we're
always doing the same thing,

233
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,330
and all the girls are doing
something different now.

234
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:13,752
So, I just think
maybe I should frost it.

235
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,340
You ever feel trapped
by your life, Rhoda?

236
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,885
Oh, sure.
I mean, I'm stuck with it.

237
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,012
You know, I wonder how
I would look as a redhead.

238
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,306
Why are you
stuck with it?

239
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,434
What- What should I do, Pearl?
Become an astronaut?

240
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:33,105
You don't have kids, and you
still got a lot of freedom.

241
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,484
Yeah, I'm free to sit around and
watch everybody else with their kids.

242
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,196
You know, I swear, every
single time I go to Poppy's,

243
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:46,243
and I have a pickle while I'm waiting for
my ice cream, Neil asks me if I'm pregnant.

244
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,413
I say to him, "When are you gonna
get it through your thick skull?"

245
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:54,585
"I love pickles. You put a free bowl
in front of me, I eat them."

246
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:01,133
- You gonna try again?
- I don't know.

247
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:06,638
Then Neil and I wouldn't be able to
take our annual trips to the Riviera.

248
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:19,151
Sometimes I try
to picture my life...

249
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,404
if I hadn't had
Alison so young.

250
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,449
Maybe my life wouldn't be
that different. I don't know.

251
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,744
Sometimes I just wish
I was a whole other person.

252
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,621
Yuck.

253
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,123
<i>Attention, campers.

254
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:37,920
<i>Please report to the casino for
a meeting with Dr. Fogler after lunch.

255
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:42,925
<i>All campers are to report
directly to the casino after lunch.

256
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,387
- You ready for lunch, cowboy?
- Yep.

257
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,890
- Where'd you get that?
- What?

258
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,560
- That licorice.
- The Blouse Man.

259
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,562
Honey, what'd I tell you about
taking candy from strangers?

260
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,481
He's not a stranger.
He's the Blouse Man.

261
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,484
- Is he a friend of the family?
- You should have been more specific.

262
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:05,489
- Don't be fresh.
- Is he a friend of the family now?

263
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,450
- Go to your room.
- This is my room.

264
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,495
I asked you to watch out for your brother,
and you just let anyone give him candy?

265
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:14,581
It wasn't anyone.
It was the Blouse Man.

266
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,793
All right, both of you,
just eat your lunch.

267
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,428
You shouldn't be giving
candy to children.

268
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:32,850
Oh, hey.
Which ones are yours?

269
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,560
Just keep your
licorice sticks to yourself.

270
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:38,772
No, I'll try to be
more conscientious.

271
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,525
I didn't mean any harm.
I just, uh...

272
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,987
I quit cigarettes, you know, so I need
something to help me with the craving.

273
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,612
Oh.

274
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:49,908
I took your advice.
The, uh, shades.

275
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,953
Jewelry, all this stuff,
goin' like hotcakes.

276
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,122
I made a killin' today.
You're a smart lady.

277
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,833
Oh, well, I just figured,

278
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,877
you know, women
would buy them, and...

279
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,796
- They did.
- They did. Good.

280
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,800
Hey, thanks. You know, I got the perfect
blouse for you. Wait till you see this.

281
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,343
No, no, I'm not here
to buy a blouse.

282
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:12,723
No, no, no, check this out. A friend
of mine makes them up in Kingston.

283
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,350
It's a new line I'm carrying.

284
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,355
Yeah, it's- it's a tie-dye.
It's not bad.

285
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:24,818
- No one will buy these.
- They will if they see you in one.

286
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:29,448
- Want to try it on? What do you think?
- Maybe the purple one.

287
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,949
- Which one?
- That one.

288
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:35,495
This one? Yeah. It's not
bad either. It's pretty good.

289
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,789
You want to try it?
What have you got to lose?

290
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,791
All right.

291
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,756
Jesus Christ. Here.

292
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,508
Thank you.

293
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:56,350
- Hey, what's your name?
- Pearl.

294
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:01,021
- Want a beer or somethin'?
- A beer? No... no!

295
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,440
How's that fit?

296
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,692
My husband's gonna hate it.

297
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,903
Are you kiddin' me?

298
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:11,448
He's gonna love you in it.
Look how sexy you look.

299
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,744
Check it out.
Back up a little.

300
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,039
See? I mean,
it fits really well.

301
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,668
Keep it a couple of days, you know?
You don't like it, you give it back.

302
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,670
If you do, pay me later.

303
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,298
Or don't. I mean, you're
doing me a favor just wearing it.

304
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,217
All right.

305
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:34,263
Wait a second.
Come here.

306
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,767
You don't want to go
around with that thing.

307
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,274
- Okay?
- Yep. There you go.

308
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,235
- Really looks good. I'm not kidding.
- Thank you.

309
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,871
When do you come
back here anyway?

310
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:03,250
I mean, what's your schedule,
if I wanted to return it?

311
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:08,380
My schedule? I don't have a --
I don't have a schedule.

312
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:13,177
But, uh, I'll tell you what.

313
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,432
I'll give you my number.

314
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,517
I live right in town.

315
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:24,438
And, uh, call me
anytime you want.

316
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,983
Okay.

317
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,282
Pinkies.

318
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,373
It's tie-dyed.

319
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,635
Stop it.

320
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,141
How can you not love it here? Look at
this. An army barracks with lawn furniture.

321
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,601
This is unbelievable.

322
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,604
I was over at Grossingers, as I was in
the lobby there. That's where I'm staying.

323
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:08,232
In the lobby at Grossingers.

324
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,528
They gave me a room. I walked in.
There was no ceiling on the room.

325
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,656
I called down to the clerk. I said,
"There's no ceiling on my room".

326
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,326
He said, "Don't worry. The fellow
upstairs don't walk around much".

327
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:29,336
And now I want to invite you all
up here on the floor to dance,

328
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:32,422
because it's my turn to laugh.

329
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:36,927
For your love

330
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,724
I would do anything

331
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:48,272
I would do anything

332
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,777
For your love

333
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,615
For your kiss

334
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:02,119
Do you think you could stop
looking at her for a minute?

335
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,956
I don't know.

336
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:12,421
- That's my girl.
- I would go anywhere

337
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:16,884
For your kiss

338
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,387
That's it. Get a little cozy,
a little sexy here.

339
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,681
<i>Come on, everybody.

340
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,057
I was thinking,

341
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:28,103
maybe we could do
Chuck a different way.

342
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:33,650
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

343
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,361
I thought maybe
we could, um...

344
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,655
experiment.

345
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,659
Okay.

346
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,453
- We don't have to.
- No, no, it's okay.

347
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:47,497
- No, it's all right.
- We were doing Chuck pretty good the old way.

348
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,917
- We are. We do.
- Yeah?

349
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,920
I just thought
it might be fun.

350
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,964
What did you
have in mind?

351
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,467
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

352
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:02,346
- I'm sorry. I just...
- No. No, no.

353
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,848
That's all right.

354
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,100
Marty...

355
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,606
Okay, pretty lady.

356
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:16,818
There's a posse on my tail,
so I ain't got much time.

357
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,368
- Reach for the sky.
- Shh.

358
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,869
Come here. You're
gonna hurt yourself.

359
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,413
I know. They're loaded.
I'll put them down.

360
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,876
Is that different enough?

361
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,675
- Drive safe.
- I will.

362
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,511
I'll see ya.
Hold this for me.

363
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,513
- See ya, cowboy.
- Bye, Daddy.

364
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,515
- Good-bye.
- Here, darling. Take your jacket.

365
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:51,395
- Thank you.
- Drive safe. Don't speed.

366
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,568
Thanks.

367
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,772
- Hey, hop in. I'll give you a ride.
- What?

368
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,691
Get in, and
I'll give you a ride.

369
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,944
No, thank you. I'm fine.

370
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:44,031
I'm going your way.
Come on!

371
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,452
Well, if you're sure
it's no trouble.

372
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:52,623
It's no trouble. Get out of the rain,
for Christ's sake. Come on.

373
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:57,211
- Here. Here's a towel.
- Thank you.

374
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:00,714
- All right?
- Yeah.

375
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:03,675
Here we go.

376
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,557
Here's another towel.

377
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:20,567
Looks like that's
all she wrote.

378
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,075
Those things
look kind of painful.

379
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,164
Bet it looks good curly.

380
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:37,167
<i>That's the way she
feels about you

381
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:42,089
<i>That's the way she
feels about you

382
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,759
<i>Attention, the knish man
is on the premises.

383
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:49,596
<i>The knish man
is on the premises.

384
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:55,310
So?

385
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:56,645
- No.
- No?

386
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,898
- That's what I pay you for, "no"?
- The cards don't lie.

387
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,818
Maybe they're subject
to interpretation.

388
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:06,196
Selma, does this look like
a vacation card?

389
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,533
You wanna go to Miami?
Go to Miami, but...

390
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:10,325
Bubbie?

391
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,619
Just a minute, sweetheart.
I'm finishing up a reading.

392
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:16,123
- Could you come now?
- All right.

393
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,334
Come back tomorrow. We'll ask
the tea leaves. Don't touch that.

394
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,128
Coming, love.

395
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:24,965
What is it?

396
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,343
What is it, my
shainehkuh, huh?

397
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,012
What is it, darling?

398
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,643
Oh, my God.

399
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,481
Mazel tov.

400
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,318
Why'd you hit me?

401
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,361
It's a tradition.

402
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,822
My mother, your great-grandmother,
Sonia - may she rest in peace -

403
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,658
...she did the same thing to me.
- It's a stupid tradition.

404
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,994
It's the stupidest
goddamn tradition.

405
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,413
It's true. You know what I did?
I slapped her right back.

406
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,042
Bandeet!

407
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,044
- What's going on in here?
- Pearl...

408
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,254
- What?
- I got news.

409
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:07,508
Today Alison
became a woman.

410
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,181
How do you feel?

411
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,185
What kind should I get?

412
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:22,481
- Well, you know, these are pretty good.
- What about tampons?

413
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,816
You've already had a big
enough shock. Just get these.

414
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,694
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.

415
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,279
Hi.

416
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:32,157
- What? What was that?
- Nothing.

417
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,620
How are you?

418
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,372
<i>Attention, everyone.

419
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,291
<i>Will the person who took
Eleanor Gelfand's thongs,

420
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,252
<i>please return them
to the main house?

421
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,629
She's been hiding away
for an hour.

422
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,423
She didn't even
eat any supper.

423
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:51,844
I bet she has cramps.
Poor thing.

424
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:58,892
I have... my first date.

425
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:00,060
What?

426
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:03,105
Ross is taking me to
Fun Fair, the go-carts.

427
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,189
Go-carts?

428
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:07,943
Mother, this is the most exciting night of
my life. You're not gonna ruin it for me.

429
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:12,656
No! Of course not. I was just worried.
Maybe you weren't feeling up to it.

430
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,074
I'm fine.

431
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:17,578
You look so... womanly.

432
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,748
You see, my shainehkuh. You become
a woman, the world looks brighter.

433
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,089
Don't tell Daddy
I got my period.

434
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,723
<i>Long-distance telephone call
for Alison Kantrowitz.

435
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:41,643
<i>It's your father!
You're a woman now, Alison.

436
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:43,061
<i>Mazel tov, darling.

437
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:48,692
<i>And may you be blessed with a happy
marriage and many, many beautiful children.

438
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,805
- Sometime today.
- How long are we gonna wait here?

439
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,057
I'll be right
with you, Bill.

440
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,601
- Oh, Marty.
<i>- The whole weekend's shot.</i>

441
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,645
Everybody and their brother
wants their TV to be working...

442
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,231
...so they can watch the moon landing.
- Sid, I am depending on you.

443
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,774
I have to see the
man on the moon.

444
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,859
Sid's even gonna keep
the shop open on Sunday.

445
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:32,444
There's shmuts
all over the wire!

446
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,279
Honey, we were
counting on you.

447
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:37,115
- I know, sweetie. I'm so sorry. I really am.
- It's Sanka.

448
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,284
I forgot I put it
on top of the set.

449
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:42,704
<i>- I'll be thinking of you while I'm watching.</i>
- I'll be thinking of you too.

450
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:45,958
- I wanna talk to him.
- You explain this to Danny.

451
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,503
- Okay. Hey, cowboy.
<i>- Daddy.</i>

452
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:52,047
Why can't you come?

453
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:56,009
<i>Danny, I gotta work,
okay? I'm sorry.

454
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,345
<i>- You watch your mom for me?
- I wanted you to come.

455
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:01,765
<i>Summertime

456
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,726
<i>Time, time

<i>The living's easy

Four dot.

<i>Fish are</i>
- Big bam.

461
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:21,660
<i>Jumpin' now</i>
- Dot.

462
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,912
<i>Hey, the cotton now

463
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:27,833
<i>Cotton's high

464
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:31,128
<i>Not so high

<i>She's lookin' good now

468
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,104
Hello?

469
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:53,609
Hello. Can I talk with the man
who sells the blouses?

470
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,819
- Who's this?
- Pearl.

471
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,905
Hey! How ya doin',
Pearl?

472
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:01,783
I wasn't sure if you'd
remember who - who I was.

473
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,535
I remember who you are.

474
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,704
Hey, that tie-dye
work out all right?

475
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,499
- He liked it, didn't he?
- Yeah.

476
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:14,213
- What's up?
- I- I was wondering...

477
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:18,050
I wondered if you had plans
for watching the...

478
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,177
the moon walk.

479
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,351
- Fogler, you outdid yourself. Terrific.
- It's a masterpiece.

480
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,148
Hi, hon.

481
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:40,781
Can I go to a concert?

482
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,699
Which ones look
better with this?

483
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,785
- The black ones.
- Yeah?

484
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:48,038
It's near White Lake. All the
counselors are getting tickets.

485
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,874
- Is it cool out?
- Medium.

486
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,292
Here.

487
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,962
It was supposed to be in
Woodstock, and they changed it,

488
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:58,131
and now it's so close by.

489
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:01,426
Nobody ever liked this dress.

490
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,346
- So can I?
- When is it again?

491
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,850
August 15 through 17.
People are gonna camp out.

492
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:08,642
What?

493
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:12,271
- Everyone's gonna be there.
- Alison.

494
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,815
You're 14 years old.
You're not camping out.

495
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,650
Why are you getting
all dressed up...

496
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:19,403
to watch some stupid guys
walk on the moon?

497
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,114
It's not stupid.

498
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,950
- It's important.
- Please, Mom.

499
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,660
I mean, I have to go!

500
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:29,037
Honey, I'm sorry.

501
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,999
You're not old enough.

502
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,084
First, everyone tells me
I'm a woman now.

503
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,420
Then I'm not old enough?

504
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:39,840
I hate you!

505
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,801
<i>Lights on.

506
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:49,391
<i>Down two and a half.</i>
- Give me some.

507
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,519
<i>Forward. Forward.

508
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:55,063
Come on. Give me some.

509
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:59,026
<i>Three feet down, two and a half.
Pickin'up some dust.

510
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,028
<i>Three feet,
two and a half down.

511
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:04,740
<i>Faint shadow.
Four forward.

512
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:07,075
<i>Four forward.
Drifting to the right a little.

513
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,704
<i>Six, down a half.
Thirty seconds forward.

514
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,085
<i>Contact light.

515
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:19,838
<i>Okay, engines stop.

516
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,131
<i>A.P.A. out of descent.

517
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:26,637
<i>Command override off.
Engine arm off.

518
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,599
<i>Houston, uh,
Tranquility Base here.

519
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,643
<i>The Eagle has landed.

520
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,645
Yes!

521
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,688
Unbelievable.

522
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:44,780
<i>It will be several hours before
the astronauts don their space suits...

523
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:47,741
<i>and Neil Armstrong
takes his first step.

524
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,786
Are they walking
on the moon yet?

525
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,622
- Not yet, sweetheart.
- Shh. Sweetheart.

526
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,416
Lillian, I've got
such a headache.

527
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,086
I need to get some air,
or maybe I should lie down.

528
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,255
You're gonna
miss the best part.

529
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,926
I knew this one guy who
worked in Moise's Butcher Shop.

530
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,888
He cut the tip of his
finger off on purpose.

531
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:13,517
I thought I'd get myself
into a car accident.

532
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,396
Just burn your draft card.

533
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:19,648
And go to jail?

534
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,361
Joan Baez's husband
didn't cut off his fingertip.

535
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:48,886
It's a French kiss.
You have to open your mouth.

536
00:32:57,686 --> 00:33:03,025
<i>One of these moments

537
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,196
<i>You're gonna rise

538
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,325
<i>Rise up singin'

539
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:16,830
<i>You're gonna

540
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:21,168
<i>Spread your wings

541
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,128
<i>Child you take

542
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:25,506
<i>Take to the sky

543
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:26,882
Where are we?

544
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:29,760
<i>Lord, the sky

545
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:33,055
Come on in back.
I wanna show you something.

546
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:43,440
<i>Nothin's goin'
to harm me now

547
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:49,279
<i>Na, na-na, na, na-na, na

548
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,371
I never saw one so small.

549
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,206
It's cool, isn't it?

550
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:03,502
My kid brother
picked it up over in Asia.

551
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:06,713
What was he
doing over there?

552
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:10,592
- Killin' people.
- Oh.

553
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:13,095
Is he still over there?

554
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,098
I don't know.

555
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:21,854
Maybe.

556
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:28,026
He's been missing
for four years.

557
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:32,322
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

558
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:43,166
I should tell my husband
about these. He fixes TVs.

559
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:48,589
Usually he's here
on the weekends, but...

560
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:51,675
he had to fix
a lot of sets.

561
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:57,181
No one wanted
to miss the, um...

562
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,434
the, uh...

563
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:03,270
moon landing.

564
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:07,941
I wish they'd step
outside already.

565
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,943
<i>Today

566
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:14,448
Want me to stop, Pearl?
<i>I know what I wanna do</i>

567
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:17,159
<i>But I don't know what for

568
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,828
<i>To be living for you

569
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,873
<i>Is all I

570
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:26,543
<i>Want to do

571
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:30,964
<i>To be loving you

572
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,634
<i>It'll all be there</i>
- Oh, God.

573
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:37,429
<i>When my dreams come true

574
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:41,266
What is your name?

575
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,644
Walker.
<i>Today</i>

576
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:47,439
<i>You'll make me say that I</i>
- Is that your last name?

577
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:51,652
<i>Somehow will change</i>
- My last name is Jerome.

578
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:54,071
<i>Today

579
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:57,699
You're backwards.
<i>You look into my eyes</i>

580
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,702
It seems to me I'm
exactly where I should be.

581
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:03,413
<i>To be any more</i>
- I have to sit down.

582
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:08,961
<i>Than all I am
would be a lie

583
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,882
<i>I'm so full of love

584
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:19,680
<i>I could burst apart
and start to cry

585
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:26,895
<i>Today

586
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:30,566
<i>Everything you want
I swear

587
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:33,861
<i>It all will come true

588
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:37,739
<i>Today

589
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:43,579
<i>I realized how much
I'm in love with you

590
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:46,623
<i>With you standing here

591
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:52,421
<i>I can tell the world
what it means to love

592
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:57,593
<i>To go on from here

593
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,179
<i>I can't use words

594
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:04,391
<i>They don't say enough

595
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,854
<i>Please, please

596
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,522
<i>Listen to me

597
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:16,195
<i>It's taken so long
to come true

598
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:22,409
<i>It's all for you

599
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:26,914
<i>That's one small
step for man,

600
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,584
<i>one giant leap
for mankind.

601
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,358
What are you doing?

602
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:59,863
Are you sure you want...

603
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:32,938
One, two.

604
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,858
Three.

605
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:42,781
Concentrate.

606
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:54,710
- What happened to Pearl last night?
- She had a headache.

607
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:57,671
You got a chair
right next to the house.

608
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,798
What chair?
What house?

609
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:18,483
Are you allowed to kiss guys?

610
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,613
Guys I can kiss.
Bacon is a different story.

611
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:29,036
Did you ever tongue kiss?

612
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,288
That's disgusting.

613
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,040
It wasn't.

614
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,377
You and Ross?

615
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:39,046
Yeah!

616
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,258
Did you do anything else?

617
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,511
Not yet.

618
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:53,268
<i>Attention, ladies.
The Blouse Man is on the premises.

619
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:55,729
<i>The Blouse Man
is on the premises.

620
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:59,900
How are you doing? You want to
try this one? It looked good last week.

621
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:03,111
- I'll try it.
- It'll look good this week too.

622
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:08,450
Take your time.
I'm waiting.

623
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,248
How about you,
Mrs. Kantrowitz?

624
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:16,458
Can I help you
find something?

625
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:19,461
I'm not sure.

626
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,505
That looks nice.

627
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:26,343
- How about this?
- Try this on.

628
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,429
<i>Attention, ladies.

629
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:33,642
<i>Will everyone who signed up for the mah-jongg
tournament please report to the casino now?

630
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:36,562
- Let's go. Let's save a little money.
<i>We begin in Five minutes.</i>

631
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:39,106
<i>That's Five minutes, ladies.

632
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,295
<i>There's a man
who's been out sailin'

633
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:03,964
<i>In a decade full of dreams

634
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,550
<i>And he takes her
to a schooner

635
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,094
<i>And he treats her
like a queen

636
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:12,181
<i>Bearing beads
from California

637
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:16,977
<i>With their amber
stones and green

638
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,062
The count of three.

639
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,649
- No way!
<i>He has called her from the harbor</i>

640
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:26,486
<i>He has kissed her
with his freedom

641
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,407
<i>He has heard her
off to starboard

642
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,829
<i>In the breakin' and the
breathin' of the waterwheel

643
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,332
Come on, Pearl!
Fly! Come on!

644
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:44,171
<i>While she was busy
bein' free

645
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,550
<i>There's a man who's
climbed a mountain

646
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:51,345
<i>And he's callin' out
her name

647
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:56,350
<i>And he hopes her heart can
hear 3,000 miles - he calls again

648
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:59,102
<i>He can think
of her beside him

649
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:03,774
<i>He can miss her
just the same

650
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:09,530
<i>He has missed her
in the forest

651
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:13,617
<i>While he showed her
all the flowers

652
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:19,998
<i>While she was somewhere
bein' free

653
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,762
Pearl?

654
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:37,057
Pearl. Get up.

655
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,852
We're goin'
blueberry pickin'.

656
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:43,021
Come.

657
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,909
Pearl?

658
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:59,621
You believe in fate?

659
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,041
I'm not sure
what that means.

660
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:08,463
It means that there are certain things that no
matter what you do that they're meant to happen.

661
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:11,216
They're in the stars.

662
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,928
They're bashert, destined.

663
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,891
But even if
they're in the stars,

664
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:24,229
a person, a grown-up
responsible person, a mensch,

665
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:26,773
can make a different choice.

666
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:30,110
They can make
the right choice.

667
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:40,037
You're shtupping someone.

668
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,330
What?

669
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:44,541
The Blouse Man.

670
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:46,960
I am not.

671
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:51,381
You're shtupping the goddamn Blouse Man,
Pearl. How could you do such a thing?

672
00:43:57,971 --> 00:43:59,973
Are you gonna tell Marty?

673
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:02,226
So it's true.

674
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:05,687
I'm right.
I'm always right.

675
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:07,814
It's -- It's a curse.

676
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,494
Why, Pearly?

677
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:25,791
Have you forgotten
who you married?

678
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:30,212
When your husband was 12 years old,
you know what he dreamed of being?

679
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:32,089
A scientist.

680
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,216
So he entered
the school science fair...

681
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:37,678
in the hopes of
winning a microscope.

682
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:40,639
Such a doorbell he made, I don't
even want to tell you about it.

683
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:43,642
It not only rang, it lit up.

684
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:46,728
It chopped liver.
It made matzo balls.

685
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,065
First prize.

686
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:53,193
He was so proud, Pearl.

687
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:58,448
And when that son-of-a-bitch
husband of mine ran out on us,

688
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:00,409
you know what my boy did?

689
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:03,036
Came to me with $10.

690
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,372
And he says to me, "Mama,

691
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:08,959
you don't ever have to worry.

692
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:11,920
I will take care of you".

693
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:17,926
Sold the microscope.

694
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:28,562
I never heard that story.

695
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,857
Something else
you didn't know.

696
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,195
The summer that you two met, summer
he was waiting on tables at Kramer's.

697
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:39,990
Kramer knew that Marty and I
didn't have two nickels to rub together,

698
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:44,369
so he offered to pay for
Marty to go to college.

699
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:47,122
But when he got
a girl pregnant...

700
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:50,751
no less a guest
at the hotel...

701
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:53,170
good-for-nothing Kramer...

702
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:56,673
slammed the door
in our face. He --

703
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:59,593
He turned his back
on my boy.

704
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:03,639
What?

705
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:07,976
You think you're the only one
with dreams that didn't come true?

706
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,120
I wondered where you were.

707
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:29,039
I can't do this.

708
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,709
I'm married.

709
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,381
I have children.

710
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:43,303
<i>Across the morning sky

711
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:51,937
<i>All the birds are leaving</i>
- I understand.

712
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:59,319
<i>Ah, how can they know

713
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:02,531
<i>It's time for them

714
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:05,325
<i>To go

715
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:11,373
- Hey, Marty. How ya doin'?
- Hey, Joe!

716
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:14,168
- Daddy!
- Hey, cowboy!

717
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:16,712
<i>We'll still be dreaming

718
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:20,007
- How long did it take you this time?
- 2 hours and 41 minutes,

719
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:23,886
not including the six minutes
it took me to put my shorts on.

720
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,597
Neil said it took him
two, 20.

721
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,057
What'd I tell you about Neil?

722
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,518
- He's a stinkin' liar.
- That's right.

723
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,895
Yuck!

724
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:39,067
<i>You guys, don't use up
all the hot water!

725
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:41,195
Eighteen days in quarantine.

726
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,738
- What?
- The astronauts.

727
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:45,157
God, I hope they
like each other.

728
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,159
Here you go.

729
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:57,544
Ooh. That's strong, Marty.

730
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:05,135
I have waited all week
for this moment.

731
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:17,022
Hey, hey, hey.
Where you goin'?

732
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:18,398
Out!

733
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:22,986
- Where's my kiss?
- I have a date, Daddy.

734
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,947
A date?

735
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:28,492
Ross is taking me to the Pines.
There's a rock band there.

736
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:32,538
- Ro- Who's Ross?
- I'm late!

737
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:37,292
Who's Ross? I miss one week
and already there's a Ross?

738
00:48:37,376 --> 00:48:39,586
He's a nice boy.

739
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:43,966
- How old is he?
- Sixteen, I think.

740
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:46,093
Pearl, oh, God, Pearl!

741
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:50,472
There is no such thing
as a nice 16-year-old boy.

742
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:52,808
You can't keep her locked in
the bungalow all summer long.

743
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:56,687
No, I can't.
That's your job, darling.

744
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:01,775
Besides, it's the
principle of the thing.

745
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:05,863
I mean, if we can't go out on dates,
she shouldn't be able to either.

746
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:11,076
So take me
on a date, Marty.

747
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:17,833
- So who's at the Brickman?
- Hmm, Sandy Solo.

748
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:20,377
Shirley Bassey is
playing at the Concord.

749
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,797
Honey, now see, this is something
I would climb a fence to go see.

750
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:25,716
What?

751
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,718
Listen.

752
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:32,931
- What do you hear?
- Nothing.

753
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:37,769
Exactly.

754
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:44,359
No kids. No Bubbie.

755
00:49:46,195 --> 00:49:49,823
Mmm. Just you
and me, Pearl.

756
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:53,160
Ain't it great?

757
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:09,176
- Ow. Oh, shit. Ow.
- What?

758
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:12,679
- My leg. I gotta --
- I'll get it, honey.

759
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:15,098
Don't -- Yeah.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

760
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,310
I think I'm getting
too old for this. Ooh!

761
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:19,811
- At least it went down.
- Come here.

762
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:22,606
- You all right?
- I'm good. I'm good.

763
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:29,655
All right. It's the
steering wheel.

764
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,782
- You wanna get in the back?
- Yeah.

765
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:00,561
You okay?

766
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:04,106
No.

767
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:11,488
You wanna go home?

768
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,490
No.

769
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,706
Do you want me
to do a John Wayne?

770
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:22,708
Maybe.

771
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,297
- All right.
- We'll miss you, sonny.

772
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,091
- Okay. Bye, sweetheart.
- Drive safe.

773
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:33,844
I will. Tell Neil 7:28.

774
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:39,433
- Bye-bye, love!
- Bye, Daddy! Bye!

775
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:44,271
<i>Attention, everyone.
The ice cream man is on the premises.

776
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:48,692
<i>The ice cream man
is on the premises.

777
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:00,370
Alison.
<i>Well, the First days</i>

778
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,206
<i>Are the hardest days

779
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:05,626
<i>Don't you worry anymore

780
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:09,004
<i>'Cause when life
looks like easy street

781
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,090
<i>There is danger
at your door

782
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:16,553
<i>Think this through with me

783
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:19,973
Alison!
<i>Let me know you're mine</i>

784
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:25,020
How will you know
if your kids are drowning?

785
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:27,523
Great legs, man!

786
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:31,443
What the hell is this? Hey! Hey!
Come on. Get out of the water.

787
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:35,197
Come out of the water.
Come on!

788
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,406
Go away!

789
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,409
There are children here.

790
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:44,748
- Get away!
- Come on. Come on. Come on. Get over here.

791
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:47,793
Get away from this lake!
It's a private lake!

792
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:51,421
This is private property!
Get out!

793

798
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,479
I can't go to Woodstock.

799
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:11,733
- It's on Shabbes.
- We'll leave before Shabbes.

800
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:15,445
- I won't be able to touch money.
- I'll buy things for you.

801
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:18,949
- I can't rip toilet paper.
- I'll rip it for you!

802
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:21,326
That's all I have to do, right?

803
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:25,539
- I thought you weren't allowed to go.
- So?

804
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:28,166
My mother says that
you're corrupting me.

805
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,919
That's what friends are for.

806
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:48,562
"On this hook,
he had a book.

807

- It's for you, Mom.

810
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:02,242
It's like a parking lot. I heard
they're gonna close the thruway.

811
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,536
Are you gonna
try again tomorrow?

812

Don't do it, Pearly.

820
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:20,547
Oy veh.

821
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,218
Hello?

822
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:25,844
We were in Swan
Lake and you said to me --

823
00:56:25,886 --> 00:56:28,472
- Hello, Ma, how are you?
<i>- You said to me, "Ma,</i>

824
00:56:28,514 --> 00:56:29,848
me and Arnie and Stewie...

825
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,809
...we're going swimming".
- Ma, is everything all right?

826
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:35,520
<i>- Suddenly...</i>
- You saw Stewie drowning,

827
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:38,481
so you told us not to go swimming
under any circumstances.

828
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,943
- Right. Did you listen?
<i>- No.</i>

829
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:43,612
- And what happened?
- Stewie was swimming underwater...

830
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:46,573
and he hit his head
on a rock, but I saved him.

831
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:48,951
- And why did you save him?
<i>- Because I was extra careful.</i>

832
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:52,120
- And why were you extra careful?
- Because of your vision.

833
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:53,997
<i>And why is your
cousin Stewie alive today?

834
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:56,583
- Because I saved him.
<i>- No!</i>

835
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:59,044
Because of your vision.

836
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,296
Correct.

837
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,383
All right, Ma,
who's going to drown?

838
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:07,511
You are.

839
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:10,931
I promise I won't
go swimming, okay?

840
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:15,853
Get your tuchis up here, Marty.
I don't care what you got to do.

841
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:19,189
What's goin' on, Ma?

842
00:57:26,238 --> 00:57:29,116
Good morning!

843
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:31,076
<i>What we have in mind...

844

Alison --
Come on, Alison.

885
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:36,553
Alison!

886

- Alison, what's wrong?

887
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,897
<i>Gimme an M! Gimme a U!</i>
- What happened back there?

888
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,191
- We can't have a party now.
- You can't walk all the way to Woodridge.

889
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:51,735
Watch!
<i>Gimme a K!</i>

<i>Attention Irv Gelfand.

01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:03,747
<i>Could you please remember to bring the
pickled herring to the casino tonight?

893
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:12,130
Marty.

894
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:17,219
How did you get up here?

895
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:18,887
Uh...

896
01:01:18,971 --> 01:01:21,515
13 hours and 26 minutes.

897
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:23,976
That was with
the back roads.

898
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,940
Where were you?

899
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:34,528
I thought you
weren't coming.

900
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:48,667
What the hell
is going on, Pearl?

901
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,587
I went to Woodstock.

902
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:56,425
You went to Woodstock?

903
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:06,560
Was it groovy?

904
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:12,024
Was it far-out?
Out-of-sight?

905
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:16,236
Yeah.

906
01:02:33,337 --> 01:02:36,048
Tell me something, Pearl.

907
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:44,181
Are you screwing someone?

908
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:53,482
We'll talk about this
when you're not upset.

909
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:58,570
I'm not that upset yet. If you tell me
you're screwing someone, then I'll be upset.

910
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:04,660
So...

911
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:06,078
are you?

912
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:15,921
Yes.

913
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:22,511
Who is he?

914
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:25,514
You don't know him.

915
01:03:25,556 --> 01:03:27,558
What's his name?

916
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,770
Walker.

917
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:34,356
- What's his first name?
- That is his first name.

918
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:36,525
What's his last name?

919
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:39,403
Jerome.

920
01:03:40,571 --> 01:03:44,241
Walker Jerome.
That's his name?

921
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:47,494
Does he realize
it's backwards?

922
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:59,089
- Where'd you meet him?
- He's a salesman.

923
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:03,218
Truff. This is great.

924
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:07,389
It's like a
Johnny Yune routine.

925
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:09,516
So is he a
traveling salesman?

926
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:15,522
- Sort of.
- What's he sell?

927
01:04:18,192 --> 01:04:19,526
Blouses.

928
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:24,531
Blouses.

929
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:32,289
He's the Blouse Man.

930
01:04:32,372 --> 01:04:34,499
You're screwing
the Blouse Man.

931
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:43,383
Jesus, Pearl,

932
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:44,676
why didn't you screw
the Dress Man?

933
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:47,638
At least that way you get
a whole outfit, you know?

934
01:04:56,813 --> 01:05:00,067
What the fuck were
you thinking, huh?

935
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,319
What are you doing, Pearl?

936
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:06,114
Did you think about this
for even a - a second?

937
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:08,408
Did it ever occur to you
what this might do to us?

938
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:10,744
What this might do to Danny?
What it might do to Alison?

939
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:13,413
I want to know what you
think about that, Pearl.

940
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:15,415
Did it cross your
fuckin' mind?

941
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:19,503
Tell me. I want to know if
you fuckin' thought about it!

942
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:26,635
Tell me, Pearl, I want to know.
I want to know if you thought about it.

943
01:05:26,718 --> 01:05:28,470
Tell me.

944
01:05:29,054 --> 01:05:32,558
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

945
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:38,522
You're sorry?

946
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:43,318
- You're sorry.
- Yeah.

947
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:48,323
What am I supposed
to say to you, Pearl?

948
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:51,743
Am I supposed to say I forgive you?
Is that what you want?

949
01:05:51,827 --> 01:05:53,912
Tell me. I wanna say what
you want me to say right here.

950
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:57,416
'Cause right now I don't
know what the fuck I'm doin'.

951
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:02,171
I don't know.
I don't know what to...

952
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:12,556
Okay.

953
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:22,691
So...

954
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,612
what are your plans?

955
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:28,906
You and the Blouse Man.

956
01:06:35,495 --> 01:06:37,456
I don't know.

957
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:40,667
What the hell is that
supposed to mean, Pearl?

958
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:43,670
It means...

959
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:45,547
I don't know.

960
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:50,260
You don't know?

961
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:57,976
Okay. Okay.

962
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:02,356
Well...

963
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:04,233
I'll tell you what.

964
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:08,946
You take all
the time you need.

965
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:11,323
It doesn't matter.

966
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:16,161
'Cause, to me,

967
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:21,041
you don't exist anymore.

968
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:56,368
Hi.

969
01:07:57,619 --> 01:07:59,997
Hey! Hey! Hey!

970
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:00,664
Hey!

971
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:04,293
Hey, hey, hey.
What is that?

972
01:08:05,502 --> 01:08:08,547
You out of your
fuckin' mind?

973
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:13,760
You all right?
Do you believe that?

974
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:15,596
Calm down. Calm down.

975
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:18,056
What was he thinking?

976
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:24,395
- Marty. You okay?
- Oh, my God.

977
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,356
Marty?

978
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,861
I love you, darling.

979
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:32,779
You went away.

980
01:08:32,863 --> 01:08:36,950
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to worry you.

981
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:38,410
I wasn't worried.

982
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:42,164
- Bubbie let me have Cocoa Puffs for dinner.
- Yeah?

983
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:45,083
I want Cocoa Puffs
for dinner. Mmm.

984
01:09:19,243 --> 01:09:22,246
How come no one's
yelled at me yet?

985
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:25,749
Because I didn't tell
anybody that you went.

986
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,253
That's for you to do.

987
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:35,509
Katzileh...

988
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:37,553
do me a favor.

989
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:41,431
Don't sneak out on your
Bubbie like that again.

990
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:45,435
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

991
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:57,823
Marty, easy!

992
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:01,660
What is it, darling?

993
01:10:01,743 --> 01:10:03,579
Sonny, what is it?

994
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:06,081
Marty!

995
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:08,458
What is it, love?

996
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:10,836
- Marty, don't!
- Come on, Daniel. Let's go. Here we go, kiddo.

997
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:13,130
- Come on. Let's go.
- What are you doing?

998
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:16,508
- Marty. Please, son!
- Marty.

999
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:20,053
Stop, Daddy!
Let go of him!

1000
01:10:20,137 --> 01:10:21,805
- What are you doing?
- It's okay.

1001
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:23,682
Marty, let him go.

1002
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:25,475
- Marty, please, let him go.
- Don't do this.

1003
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:28,061
- Don't do it! Get in the car.
- Stop it!

1004
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,897
- You're coming too.
- Let go of me!

1005
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,024
- Wanna be free, Pearl?
- Let her go!

1006
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:35,194
- Wanna be free? Okay.
- No!

1007
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:36,236
Don't do this, Marty.

1008
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,116
No kids, no husband, no family.
You're free. Go! Be free! Alison...

1009
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:42,701
- Come back here!
- No!

1010
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:43,911
Alison!

1011
01:10:45,162 --> 01:10:46,163
Alison!

1012
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:48,081
Marty, stop it!

1013
01:10:48,165 --> 01:10:50,584
Hold on to me. Hold on.

1014
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:54,922
Okay. All right!

1015
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:57,466
It's okay, Pearl.
You stay --

1016
01:10:57,549 --> 01:10:59,426
You stay and be
a whore. I'll go.

1017
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:01,595
You're not going anywhere.
Give me those keys!

1018
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:04,515
Give me those keys, sonny.
You're not going anywhere...

1019
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:08,018
- Mom, get off the car! Stay out of it!
- It's too dangerous!

1020
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:15,025
Goddamn it,
son. Goddamn it.

1021
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:18,862
Ross?

1022
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:23,408
- Ross...
- I hate Daddy.

1023
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:26,912
He's just upset, honey.
He's mad at Mommy.

1024
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:31,416
He wanted you with him
because he loves you so much.

1025
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,503
Why is he mad at you?

1026
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:38,674
Sometimes grown-ups have
fights just the way kids do.

1027
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:41,009
And sometimes
they have to...

1028
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:44,555
think things over
before they can make up.

1029
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:48,225
Do you understand, huh?

1030
01:11:48,308 --> 01:11:50,102
Good.

1031
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,146
What's a "whore"?

1032
01:11:57,025 --> 01:12:00,237
Everything is fucked up.

1033
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,322
I hate it here.
I hate it.

1034
01:12:03,407 --> 01:12:06,243
- I hate them so much.
- It's okay.

1035
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:09,872
- I just want to be away from them.
- It's okay.

1036
01:12:09,955 --> 01:12:12,583
Make them go away.

1037
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:32,477
- I want to do it.
- What?

1038
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:36,273
- Let's go all the way.
- Alison...

1039
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:40,527
- Don't you want to?
- I don't know.

1040
01:12:41,528 --> 01:12:44,531
- Y-You don't want me.
- No- No, that's not it.

1041
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:47,492
Alison, I mean
it would be great, but --

1042
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:49,494
Alison, please. Please.

1043
01:12:49,536 --> 01:12:51,496
- Forget it.
- Alison, I didn't say that.

1044
01:12:51,538 --> 01:12:53,540
Just forget the
whole thing!

1045
01:12:53,624 --> 01:12:55,125
Alison!

1046
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:57,377
Fuck.

1047
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:29,076
I'm sorry about
what happened with Daddy.

1048
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,078
Forget it.

1049
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:36,542
Where were you?

1050
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:40,921
It's none
of your business.

1051
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:42,798
Alison...

1052
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:45,509
You don't always
tell us where you are.

1053
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:47,469
I'm a grown-up.

1054
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:52,349
Are you?

1055
01:13:54,434 --> 01:13:56,728
What's that
supposed to mean?

1056
01:14:00,023 --> 01:14:03,735
I went all the way
with Ross.

1057
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:17,291
You are to be in this
bungalow by 9:00 p.m.,

1058
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:20,752
every night between
now and Labor Day.

1059
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:24,506
- You hear me?
- Fuck you.

1060
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:27,551
- What?
- Fuck you!

1061
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:41,523
I never have to listen
to you ever again.

1062
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:46,153
I saw you.

1063
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:49,239
I was there.

1064
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:51,617
You should have
seen yourself!

1065
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,536
You looked disgusting!

1066
01:14:56,079 --> 01:15:01,168
I'm the teenager, not you!
You had your chance.

1067
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:05,130
- No. I didn't.
- Well, then why do the rest of us...

1068
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:08,592
have to suffer just because
you fucked up your life?

1069
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:11,887
I did not fuck up
my life, Alison!

1070
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:16,016
Things happen. Things happen
that you don't plan for.

1071
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:19,186
Do you know how old I was when
I got pregnant with you, huh?

1072
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:23,857
I was 17, just 3 years older
than you are right now, honey.

1073
01:15:23,941 --> 01:15:26,944
Do you know how many boyfriends
I had before I met your father?

1074
01:15:27,027 --> 01:15:28,320
None.

1075
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:32,324
Do you know how many times I slept with
your father before I got pregnant with you?

1076
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:36,787
Once. That's
all it takes, Alison.

1077
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:44,545
- I was an accident.
- Oh. Honey.

1078
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:47,256
Don't think that.

1079
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:50,634
Listen to me. That doesn't
mean we don't love you.

1080
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:55,639
We love you so much. We loved you
from the moment we saw you.

1081
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:58,517
Are you and Daddy
going to get a divorce?

1082
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:02,479
I don't know.

1083
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:07,609
You love the Blouse Man
more than all of us?

1084
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:09,903
No!

1085
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:11,488
Sometimes it's easier...

1086
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:15,659
to be different with
a different person.

1087
01:16:15,742 --> 01:16:20,622
Can't you just try and be different
but still stay with us?

1088
01:16:20,706 --> 01:16:22,916
Oh, baby.

1089
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,879
Daddy's just a big square,
you know that.

1090
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:31,550
But, I mean, he's Daddy.
How could you leave him?

1091
01:16:34,178 --> 01:16:36,555
I thought you hated us.

1092
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:42,519
I do. But that doesn't
mean anything.

1093
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:50,694
Alison...

1094
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:57,450
When you went
all the way with Ross,

1095
01:16:57,492 --> 01:17:00,787
did you use
any protection?

1096
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:03,665
We didn't --

1097
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:07,503
We didn't go
all the way.

1098
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,839
We've only gone
to first base.

1099
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:12,549
Ohh.

1100
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:21,767
Save the home run for
somebody really special, okay?

1101
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,356
What's going
to happen?

1102
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:33,570
I don't know.
I don't know.

1103
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:21,118
<i>Johnny's in the basement
mixin' up the medicine

1104
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:23,745

1105

1106

Wants to get it paid off

1107
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:31,962
<i>Look out, kid
It's somethin' you did

1108
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:34,506
<i>God knows when
But you're doin' it again

1109
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:37,551
<i>You better duck down the
alleyway lookin' for a new friend

1110
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:40,053
<i>The man in the coonskin cap

Maggie says that many say

1115
01:18:57,029 --> 01:18:59,781
<i>They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A.

1116
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:02,492
<i>Look out, kid
Don't matter what you did

1117
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:05,411
<i>Walk on your tiptoes
Don't tie no bows

1118
01:19:05,495 --> 01:19:08,373
<i>Better stay away from those

1119
01:19:08,457 --> 01:19:10,834

1121
01:19:19,843 --> 01:19:21,094
Hello.

1122
01:19:21,178 --> 01:19:22,888
Hi.

1123
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:26,016
<i>Did you get home all right?

1124
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:31,230
- Yeah.
- I was worried.

1125
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:36,568
Marty?

1126
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:46,370
We have to talk.

1127
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:52,292
How am I supposed
to talk to you, Pearl?

1128
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:56,880
I thought you were
my family.

1129
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:02,302
I got to go to work.

1130
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:09,393
I'm sorry.

1131

A lot of maps.

1136
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:37,564
Been to all these places?

1137
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:42,569
Not all of them.

1138
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:46,532
Not yet.

1139
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:53,455
You ever been
out West, Pearl?

1140
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:57,000
No.

1141
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:03,757
You want to go with me?

1142
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:14,893
We don't have to wait. We- We-
We can just -- pack up the bus.

1143
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:18,605
Um, we'll just -- We'll just camp out
all the way across the country,

1144
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:22,359
and we'll sleep under
the stars every night.

1145
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:27,447
Come on.

1146
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:31,577
Take your kids?

1147
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:36,498
What do you think?

1148
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:46,466
I think...

1149
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:52,556
I need you
to take me home.

1150
01:23:15,204 --> 01:23:17,623
<i>Attention Pearl Kantrowitz.

1151
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:20,083

<i>Pearl Kantrowitz, please return
to your bungalow immediately!

01:23:28,634 --> 01:23:31,469
Pearl, stop!
Stop the bus!

1154
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:33,471
Hey! Hey!

1155
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:35,265
Stop!

1156
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:39,019
- Pearl. Pearl, it's Daniel.
- He's been stung by wasps.

1157
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:41,563
- What? What?
- He's in the kitchen. Go!

1158
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,107
What happened to him?

1159
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:45,984
No! These hurt!

1160
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:48,904
Tateleh, Grandma has
to pull out the stings.

1161
01:23:48,987 --> 01:23:51,489
There's Mama.
There's your mama.

1162
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:53,659
- Mommy!
- Mommy's here, honey.

1163
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:55,160
You're going to be all right.

1164
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:58,580
Wait, ma'am, don't do that. You don't
want to break off the stingers.

1165
01:23:58,664 --> 01:24:00,040
I need some,
uh, kind of card.

1166
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:01,458
- You got some playing cards?
- Yeah.

1167
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,878
Get that and I need, uh,
meat tenderizer.

1168
01:24:04,962 --> 01:24:06,213
Well, what is he,
a pot roast?

1169
01:24:06,255 --> 01:24:09,550
- You're going to be all right, honey.
- Alison. Help him. Help him!

1170
01:24:09,633 --> 01:24:11,718
Take.

1171
01:24:11,802 --> 01:24:15,097
- Give me some warm water. Put it in a bowl.
- Mommy's here.

1172
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,975
And mix that stuff in there.
Let's see. Got of lot of them.

1173
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:22,395
- Mommy, it hurts!
- I know. You're going to be fine.

1174
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:24,481
- Here.
- Thank you.

1175
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:28,902
- I hate wasps!
- I know, honey.

1176
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:32,114
I know. Look how much
they like you, huh?

1177
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:35,993
- They covered you with kisses.
- Take a deep breath.

1178
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:38,537
Take a deep breath,
all right? Let it out.

1179
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:40,581
He's doing okay.

1180
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:44,042
- Gave you so many kisses.
- You're Daniel, right?

1181
01:24:51,383 --> 01:24:53,218
Here, katzi.

1182
01:24:57,514 --> 01:24:59,433
Daddy!

1183
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:01,727
Hey, cowboy!

1184
01:25:02,186 --> 01:25:04,521
- How's my big boy, huh?
- Got stung by wasps!

1185
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:06,815
I know, your
Bubbie called me.

1186
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:10,235
She told me she couldn't
find your mommy.

1187
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:12,154
Look, I brought
you calamine lotion.

1188
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:15,157
The Blouse Man fixed
me up with Adolf's.

1189
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,534
Adolf s, huh?

1190
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:21,038
You put meat
tenderizer on him?

1191
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:23,916
There's a protein
compound in it, uh...

1192
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:26,585
neutralizes the venom.

1193
01:25:28,086 --> 01:25:30,005
You tweeze out
the stingers?

1194
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:31,965
The Blouse Man said that
would make it worse.

1195
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:34,343
He scraped the stingers out
with Bubbie's cards.

1196
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:37,262
Oh, yeah?
Is that what he said?

1197
01:25:37,346 --> 01:25:40,474
Well, I guess that's
how it is then, huh?

1198
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:44,561
How long did it take you
to get here?

1199
01:25:45,896 --> 01:25:48,607
You're not going
to believe this, Danny.

1200
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,568
One hour
and 38 minutes.

1201
01:25:51,652 --> 01:25:54,780
Wow! That's
the fastest ever!

1202
01:25:54,863 --> 01:25:58,158
You know, my cowboy
was in trouble, so-

1203
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:10,504
Thank you.

1204
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:19,513
Are you still
mad at me, Daddy?

1205
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:34,069
I'm not mad at you, Danny.

1206
01:26:34,152 --> 01:26:36,822
I could never be mad at you.

1207
01:26:36,905 --> 01:26:39,491
You know that, right?

1208
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:43,620

01:27:01,555 --> 01:27:05,475

1216

He's asleep.

1220
01:27:37,508 --> 01:27:39,593
It wasn't you, Marty.

1221
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,513
It was me.

1222
01:27:45,849 --> 01:27:50,395
There were things
I wanted to do with my life. I --

1223
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:53,815
I don't even remember
what some of them were.

1224
01:27:55,651 --> 01:27:58,862
Somewhere
along the line,

1225
01:27:58,946 --> 01:28:01,949
I disappeared.

1226
01:28:02,616 --> 01:28:06,328
I stopped being the person
you fell in love with.

1227
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,830
And I wanted-

1228
01:28:08,914 --> 01:28:13,085
I wanted to be that
way again with you.

1229
01:28:13,377 --> 01:28:15,546
But I couldn't.

1230
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:19,508
I wanted things too, Pearl.

1231
01:28:21,218 --> 01:28:24,137
Think I like fixin' TVs?

1232
01:28:25,097 --> 01:28:28,225
Think I said, "Gee, that's what
I want to be when I grow up"?

1233
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:32,354
I mean,

1234
01:28:32,437 --> 01:28:34,815
who knows what I could've been
if I had a chance to go to college.

1235
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:36,525
But I didn't.

1236
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:39,903
And you know what?

1237
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:44,283
I was okay.

1238
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:48,954
Because I figured no matter
what I screwed up in my life,

1239
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:51,206
no matted what
I felt gypped out of,

1240
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:54,501
I had the most
important thing right.

1241
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:57,838
I had you.

1242
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,554
Now, I don't.

1243
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:16,190
But I still have
one question, Pearl.

1244
01:29:17,983 --> 01:29:20,068
Who stopped you?

1245
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:25,908
Who stopped you
from doing these things?

1246
01:29:25,991 --> 01:29:28,160
Did I stop you?
I mean, did- did-

1247
01:29:28,202 --> 01:29:31,622
Did you ever once come to me and say,
"Marty, I want to make a change in my life"?

1248
01:29:31,663 --> 01:29:34,708
And did I say,
"No, Pearl, you can't"?

1249
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:38,003
Marty,

1250
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:40,547
it's not that simple.

1251
01:29:43,008 --> 01:29:47,596
I tried. I couldn't always find
the right words, you know, but I-

1252
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:51,975
You --
You didn't hear me.

1253
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:54,561
You make jokes.

1254
01:29:58,148 --> 01:30:02,402
It's true.
I'm a bad listener.

1255
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:06,031
Not such a good
talker, either.

1256
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:08,534
And I make jokes.

1257
01:30:13,163 --> 01:30:15,541
But who stopped
you, Pearl?

1258
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:43,569
Hey.

1259
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:49,491
Mommy told me
I was an accident.

1260
01:30:54,246 --> 01:30:58,458
- She told you that?
- She didn't mean to.

1261
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:00,878
It just kind of happened.

1262
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,255
Huh.

1263
01:31:06,258 --> 01:31:10,137
Man. Well...

1264
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,515
that's what I told your Bubbie
when your mommy got pregnant.

1265
01:31:15,851 --> 01:31:17,561
Alison.

1266
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:22,816
When I met your mother
at the Kramer,

1267
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:25,944
she was the most gorgeous
thing I'd ever seen.

1268
01:31:26,028 --> 01:31:28,446
I couldn't believe
she liked me.

1269
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:31,491
She laughed at my jokes.
She laughed in the dining room...

1270
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:35,078
at what a lousy waiter I was,
and I was a lousy waiter.

1271
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:41,877
Anyway, we, uh...

1272
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:44,546
we decided to take a drive.

1273
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:49,051
It was a gorgeous,
clear August night.

1274
01:31:50,135 --> 01:31:52,554
Pearl wanted to go see
this meteor shower.

1275
01:31:54,473 --> 01:31:56,975
Alison, it was incredible.

1276
01:31:58,685 --> 01:32:03,315
It was like fireworks
but no noise.

1277
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:18,038
That was the night
we made you.

1278
01:32:18,956 --> 01:32:22,125
Maybe it was an accident.
I don't know.

1279
01:32:23,252 --> 01:32:26,797
But, to me,
it was and still is...

1280
01:32:26,839 --> 01:32:30,300
the most important
moment in my life.

1281
01:32:30,342 --> 01:32:32,261
Okay?

1282
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:35,597
Okay?

1283
01:32:39,309 --> 01:32:42,771
How could you
just break up then?

1284
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:46,817
If it was so
important to you,

1285
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,903
doesn't that make you
want to stay with her?

1286
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:53,365
Yeah.

1287
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:58,078
You know what?
You know, sweetie?

1288
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:04,251
Sometimes things
happen between people...

1289
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:07,921
that make it impossible
for them to stay together.

1290
01:33:11,842 --> 01:33:15,554
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry about this.

1291
01:33:25,981 --> 01:33:29,818
<i>Across the morning sky

1292
01:33:29,902 --> 01:33:38,243
Hi.
<i>All the birds are leaving</i>

1293
01:33:38,327 --> 01:33:40,537
How's Daniel?

1294
01:33:41,914 --> 01:33:45,792
<i>Oh, how can they know</i>
- He's better. He's okay.

1295
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:54,092
<i>It's time for them to go

1296
01:33:57,804 --> 01:33:59,556
I can't go.

1297
01:34:01,683 --> 01:34:03,435
I saw.

1298
01:34:03,519 --> 01:34:08,273
<i>Before the winter Fire

1299
01:34:08,357 --> 01:34:15,447
<i>We'll still be dreaming

1300
01:34:15,531 --> 01:34:22,496
<i>I do not count the time

1301
01:34:25,374 --> 01:34:31,004
<i>Who knows
where the time goes

1302
01:34:31,088 --> 01:34:36,677
<i>Who knows

<i>We'll still be dreaming

1306
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:12,337
You going to fix it or
you're going to kill it?

1307
01:35:12,421 --> 01:35:13,172
What's that?

1308
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:15,132
How the hell
should I know?

1309
01:35:45,078 --> 01:35:47,080
Come on. Strike him out!

1310
01:35:47,164 --> 01:35:49,541
Haven't seen
him in years.

1311
01:35:51,793 --> 01:35:53,545
I can jump higher.

1312
01:36:06,099 --> 01:36:08,519
Are you
breaking up with me?

1313
01:36:11,188 --> 01:36:13,565
Were we going steady?

1314
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:34,503
- Why are you mad at me?
- I just feel stupid.

1315
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:39,341
The other night
and Woodstock.

1316
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:43,220
I feel like you saw me
dancing without a shirt.

1317
01:36:43,303 --> 01:36:45,556
That wouldn't be
so bad, would it?

1318
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:50,811
Look, I'm not going
to tell anyone anything.

1319
01:36:50,894 --> 01:36:53,480
I know you want me to be
a pacifist, but I told Fogler...

1320
01:36:53,522 --> 01:36:56,859
if he blabbed his big metal mouth
I'd beat the shit out of him.

1321
01:36:59,528 --> 01:37:01,071
Okay?

1322
01:37:03,156 --> 01:37:05,158
Yeah.

1323
01:37:14,918 --> 01:37:18,130
<i>Attention.
The knish man is on the premises.

1324
01:37:18,213 --> 01:37:21,550
<i>The knish man
is on the premises.

1325
01:37:25,929 --> 01:37:28,473
Sonny.

1326
01:37:28,557 --> 01:37:30,434
Marty.

1327
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:37,149
So, Mr. Hershel comes
into the shop and he says,

1328
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:39,443
"I only get good reception
if Mrs. Hershel stands...

1329
01:37:39,484 --> 01:37:42,905
diagonally in front
of the television set".

1330
01:37:42,988 --> 01:37:45,115
The only problem is...

1331
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:48,202
Mrs. Hershel, she doesn't want to stand
diagonally in front of the television set.

1332
01:37:48,243 --> 01:37:51,914
She's- She's got better
things to do with her life.

1333
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:56,877
"Mr. Hershel", I say,

1334
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,839
"you need an antenna
or a marriage counselor"?

1335
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:14,895
Thank you.

1336
01:38:26,615 --> 01:38:30,244
You wanted me to tell you what
was new at the shop, so -

1337
01:38:31,537 --> 01:38:33,288
Thank you.

1338
01:38:42,214 --> 01:38:45,092
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1339
01:38:45,884 --> 01:38:48,428
You didn't deserve
to get hurt.

1340
01:38:53,225 --> 01:38:55,602
Can I ask you
one question?

1341
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:11,493
Did I want a microscope?

1342
01:39:13,245 --> 01:39:15,455
Once.

1343
01:39:32,347 --> 01:39:34,808
<i>The whole world

1344
01:39:34,892 --> 01:39:39,730

1345
01:39:39,813 --> 01:39:41,982
Dance with me.

<i>When you're laughing

1347
01:39:46,403 --> 01:39:51,491

<i>Smiles with you

1357
01:41:10,529 --> 01:41:13,448
I'm not very good at this.

1358
01:41:13,532 --> 01:41:15,576
Me neither.

1359
01:41:20,122 --> 01:41:24,501

<i>'Scuse me
while I kiss the sky

1363
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:43,436
<i>Purple haze
all around

1364
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,566
<i>Don't know if
I'm climbin' up or down

1365
01:42:01,538 --> 01:42:03,456
<i>Let the river

1366
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:08,504
<i>Rock you like a cradle

1367
01:42:08,545 --> 01:42:11,423
<i>Climb to the treetops

1368
01:42:11,507 --> 01:42:14,676
<i>Try it, if you able

1369
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,471
<i>Let your hands

1370
01:42:17,554 --> 01:42:22,809
<i>Tie a knot
across the table

1371
01:42:22,893 --> 01:42:25,437
<i>Come and touch

1372
01:42:25,521 --> 01:42:29,441
<i>The things
you cannot feel

1373
01:42:29,525 --> 01:42:33,445
<i>And close your fingertips

1374
01:42:33,529 --> 01:42:37,533
<i>And fly where I can't hold you

1375
01:42:38,242 --> 01:42:40,452
<i>Let the sun rain fall

1376
01:42:40,536 --> 01:42:45,332
<i>And let the
dewy clouds enfold you

1377
01:42:45,415 --> 01:42:48,460
<i>Then maybe you
can sing to me

1378
01:42:48,544 --> 01:42:52,422
<i>The words I just told you

1379
01:42:52,506 --> 01:42:58,178
<i>If all the things you feel
ain't what they seem

1380
01:42:58,262 --> 01:43:01,849
<i>Then don't mind me

1381
01:43:01,932 --> 01:43:05,477
<i>'Cause I ain't nothin'

1382
01:43:05,561 --> 01:43:08,438
<i>But a dream

1383
01:43:08,522 --> 01:43:12,025
<i>And you can follow

1384
01:43:12,442 --> 01:43:16,196
<i>And you can follow

1385
01:43:16,613 --> 01:43:20,993
<i>Follow

1386
01:43:42,514 --> 01:43:44,808
<i>Helplessly hoping

1387
01:43:44,975 --> 01:43:49,646
<i>Her harlequin
hovers nearby

1388
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:53,025
<i>Awaiting a word

1389
01:43:54,067 --> 01:43:56,195
<i>Gasping at glimpses

1390
01:43:56,278 --> 01:43:59,489
<i>Of gentle true spirit

1391
01:43:59,531 --> 01:44:04,536
<i>He runs
wishing he could fly

1392
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:07,455
<i>Only to trip
at the sound

1393
01:44:07,539 --> 01:44:12,544
<i>Of good-bye

1394
01:44:14,046 --> 01:44:19,426
<i>Wordlessly watching
he waits by the window

1395
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:23,514
<i>And wonders at the
empty place inside

1396
01:44:25,516 --> 01:44:30,478
<i>Heartlessly helping
himself to her bad dreams

1397
01:44:30,562 --> 01:44:35,567
<i>He worries
Did he hear a good-bye

1398
01:44:36,276 --> 01:44:38,987
<i>Or even

1399
01:44:39,530 --> 01:44:41,949
<i>Hello

1400
01:44:42,032 --> 01:44:44,535
<i>They are one person

1401
01:44:44,618 --> 01:44:47,454
<i>They are two alone

1402
01:44:47,538 --> 01:44:50,415
<i>They are three together

1403
01:44:50,499 --> 01:44:53,502
<i>They are for

1404
01:44:53,544 --> 01:44:56,505
<i>Each other

1405
01:45:21,655 --> 01:45:25,950
<i>Look over yonder

1406
01:45:26,034 --> 01:45:30,539
<i>What do you see

1407
01:45:30,581 --> 01:45:35,085
<i>The sun is a-risin'

1408
01:45:35,169 --> 01:45:39,965
<i>Most definitely

1409
01:45:40,382 --> 01:45:44,595
<i>A new day is comin'

1410
01:45:45,137 --> 01:45:48,640
<i>People are changin'

1411
01:45:50,517 --> 01:45:53,562
<i>And beautiful

1412
01:45:54,021 --> 01:45:57,566
<i>Crystal blue persuasion

1413
01:46:04,072 --> 01:46:08,076
<i>Better get ready

1414
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:12,497
<i>Want to see the light

1415
01:46:12,581 --> 01:46:17,211
<i>Love, love
is the answer

1416
01:46:18,045 --> 01:46:21,507
<i>That's all right

1417
01:46:22,549 --> 01:46:27,054
<i>So don't you give up now

1418
01:46:27,137 --> 01:46:32,017
<i>It's so easy to find

1419
01:46:32,059 --> 01:46:36,480
<i>Just look to your soul

1420
01:46:36,563 --> 01:46:41,527
<i>Open your mind

1421
01:46:43,487 --> 01:46:48,242
<i>Crystal blue persuasion

1422
01:46:49,076 --> 01:46:52,788
<i>It's a new libation

1423
01:46:52,871 --> 01:46:57,501
<i>Crystal blue persuasion

1424
01:46:58,669 --> 01:47:02,506
<i>It's a new libation

1425
01:47:07,261 --> 01:47:07,302
THE END
