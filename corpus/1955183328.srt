00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,543
<i>It's just around the corner. </i>

2
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,089
Fellas...

3
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,592
...I wanna play a little game.

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,473
The name of the game is
"See How They Run. "

5
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,687
<i>It's just around the corner. </i>

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,363
Man, you do this shit every time.

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,696
It'll take a minute.
I'll be right there.

8
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,625
I own controlling interest...

9
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:47,206
...of every club in Seven Corners
except for The Kid's.

10
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,498
When I take him over...

11
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,875
...I can bogart the rest of them.

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,342
Listen, I know this is gonna
make you angry...

13
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,219
...but I don't make enough money
working at your joint.

14
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,300
Morris offered me a job
at the Pandemonium.

15
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,222
No way.

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,065
I'm your baby,
and you gotta take care of me.

17
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,440
Kid, listen to me.

18
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:14,562
Man, F this noise.

19
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,792
<i>Seven Corners</i>
<i>Two souls fight</i>

20
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,801
<i>One wants money</i>
<i>One wants light</i>

21
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,674
<i>Without peace</i>
<i>Without love</i>

22
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,097
<i>Nothing's ever gonna turn out right</i>

23
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:45,271
That's the reason why
I wanna play this game...

24
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,898
...to see how they run.

25
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,105
See, we wanna play the same game,
only a little different.

26
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,278
<i>Oh, heaven. </i>

27
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,455
<i>Please tell me why</i>
<i>you've brought me here tonight. </i>

28
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:11,037
<i>I've always done my best</i>

29
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,540
<i>To stay out of the game</i>

30
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,090
<i>Heaven must be near</i>

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,387
<i>Because now I don't feel the same</i>

32
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,345
Man, let's get out of here
before that thing blows!

33
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,807
Guess where you're going.

34
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,985
Nowhere.

35
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,823
Musicians, they're all alike.

36
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,742
You know what your problem is?

37
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,918
You got too many problems,
that's what your problem is.

38
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,249
Just my luck to be stuck with a fool.

39
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,083
Wake up, little baby.

40
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,462
Nothing comes to dreamers but dreams.

41
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,853
<i>With the takeover of The Kid's club,</i>
<i>you're gonna be making more money. </i>

42
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,982
So, fellas, we got to make more money.

43
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,821
That's what time it is.

44
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,082
Jerome.

45
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,516
Damn. Who would do it, man?

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,063
Come on, Terry. You can do it.

47
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,527
Come on, brother,
we're depending on you.

48
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,196
What?

49
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,379
Now what time is it?

50
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,952
You want my ID? Okay.
There. It's all right.

51
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,214
Truth, baby. You fine.

52
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:22,019
I told you to turn this place to ashes.
How come I don't smell no smoke?

53
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,185
We did it.
I don't know what happened.

54
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,641
Like I always say:

55
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:29,071
If you want something done,
hire good people to do it.

56
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:42,035
Ladies and gentlemen,
Morris E. Day, the only.

57
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,750
- Yeah.
- Disgusting.

58
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,973
Come here.
Give me that.

59
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,853
Chill.

60
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,284
Yo, Kid. Chill, man.
Morris is coming.

61
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,545
- What's going on?
- Oh, man.

62
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,793
Nice shoes.

63
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,726
The king has arrived.

64
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,402
People tell me you been making
that spiritual noise again.

65
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,945
You know I can't make no money
that way.

66
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,988
If you ever gave it a chance,
one day you would.

67
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,370
I do believe...

68
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,663
...in Billy's will...

69
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,627
...he left half this club to you...

70
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,747
...and the other half to me.

71
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:14,295
I do believe I have a say
in what music is played here.

72
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:18,637
- No one man will be ruler.
- Kid, your shit ain't hitting no more!

73
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,427
Why don't you just give me the keys.

74
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,766
Grace, you better wake up!

75
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,813
This music will never change anybody!

76
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,312
Are you listening to me?

77
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,546
- Jerking everything in sight!
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

78
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,713
- Are you finished?
- What? I can't hear you.

79
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,967
Release it.

80
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,560
<i>Release it. </i>

81
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,306
Release it.

82
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,060
You got it?

83
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,690
<i>- Release it. </i>
- Got it.

84
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,245
Stella, if you think
I'm afraid of you...

85
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,340
...Grace, if you so much as think
I can't do the do...

86
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,091
...girl, if you dream I came to
jerk around, you better wake up...

87
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,922
...and release it.

88
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:14,356
- This is embarrassing.
- They dogging us out in our own club.

89
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,519
I told you.
You should've let me rap.

90
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,364

Everybody's coming.

Man, you was bad.

95
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,952
You know...

96
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:12,328

Bang.

00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,288
Morris, darling,
would you give me change...

115
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,920
...to replace the cape
you ruined last night?

116
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,801
Jerome, please tell this woman
her account's overdrawn at my bank.

117
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,965
Robin, stop asking for so much money.

118
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,142
"Stop asking for money"?
Boy, I own part of this joint!

119
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:03,261
If it wasn't for my daddy's money,
y'all still be shooting dice at Glam Slam.

120
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,682
- Shit, you got some nerve talking!
- Robin!

See this?

124
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,073
Take a week off and kiss it all.

125
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,151
What's up, man?

126
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,824
Sit down.

127
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,450
- What's up, fellas?
- J.B., Jesse.

128
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,164
Okay, fellas, make a sound.

129
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,837
George is still acting flaky.
The brother's holding out.

130
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,581
- Yeah, we need to bust him.
- What about The Kid?

131
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,674
They're expecting a little crowd tonight.
Won't last. Nobody's drinking.

132
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:39,051
Yeah, I bet he'd be lucky
if he make 1200.

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,235
- Fellas, what's up?
- We been losing bad every night.

136
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,561
We're going to George's
to get a new vibe.

137

I don't know about The Kid.

138

- He don't pay too good.

139
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,612
- It's $5.
- We need new music.

140
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,194

- Can't do nothing for you, man.

What's your story?

147
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,424
It's really quiet tonight.

148

Yeah, but that don't never stop

00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,775
Where you been?
When you gonna call me?

174
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,738
- When you get a life.
- Cold.

175
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:05,041
Yo, Kid. You know good Jill
is working at Morris' now.

176
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,168
Jill.

177
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:11,837
Morris in the mix now?
What kind of noise is that?

178
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,511
Oh, man!

179
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,591
Man!

180
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:31,939
<i>Abandoned on the street</i>
<i>At the tender age of 7</i>

181
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,064
<i>How could I ever learn</i>
<i>The real meaning of heaven?</i>

182
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:39,450
<i>Surely not from a fast-talker</i>
<i>Born to molest a woman's mind</i>

183
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:43,402
<i>Surely not on the dance floor</i>
<i>Of someone else's idea of a good time</i>

184
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:48,582
<i>Fate, the only mother</i>
<i>That I've ever really known</i>

185
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:52,916
<i>Give me the courage</i>
<i>To face the things yet unshown</i>

186
00:27:55,801 --> 00:28:00,130
I've seen her here twice now.
She just sits there and writes.

187
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:03,092
- What do you think?
- She could be a number three.

188
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,888
- You want me to rap?
- Yes.

189
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:09,311
I be over here posing
by the Porsche.

190
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,609
Hello, darling.
You must be waiting on a man.

191
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,788
You're much too pretty to wait here.
What's up with that?

192
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,199
What's up with your buddy
holding his stuff?

193
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,203
Does he have to use the bathroom?

194
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:35,328
No, baby, he's posing by the Porsche.

195
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,583
Cars don't impress me.

196
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,802
That's Morris Day. He'd like to eat...
I mean, meet you.

197
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,430
Oh, yeah?

198
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,674
Punk. Go get him.

199
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:49,687
- Morris, she wants to meet you.
- Oh, Lord.

200
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,817
- Name?
- Aura.

201
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:08,158
Lovely. Where'd you get that ass?

202
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,165
Same place you got your manners.

203
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,123
- Jerome, where'd I get my manners?
- Same place as that ass.

204
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:17,876
- Where was that?
- Mama.

205
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,917
That's right, baby. Your mama.
Now, let's be nice.

206
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,132
It's such a pretty day.

207
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,891
Stop it.

208
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,026
<i>If I can keep him off me long enough... </i>

209
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:43,151
<i>... he might still be saved. </i>

210
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,700
<i>Heaven, do I really</i>
<i>have to go through with this?</i>

211
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,280
Where are we going?

212
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,223
Look. Check this out.

213
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:22,606
- You thinking like me?
- I'm thinking like you.

214
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,817
Well. What have we here?

215
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:29,783
Crowd must be a little light
at y'all's place, huh? Oh, well.

216
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,743
Go get your boss and tell him to come
and see my new bracelet, Aura.

217
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:40,129
I'm sorry, baby.
Force of habit.

218
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,132
I'm sorry.

219
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:51,301
Excuse me, boys.

220
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,644
Let's hit it.

221
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:08,406
- Oh, Morris, can I help you with that?
- No, no.

222
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:11,154
You know what to do.

223
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,662
Jerome, I think I like her.

224
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:41,690
Cue the band up for "Love Machine. "
Jill's singing it tonight.

225
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,853
That ought to shake The Kid up a bit.

226
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:48,656
- Man, you're truly a genius.
- Tell me something I don't already know.

227
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:52,992
- Kid, you need to come with us.
- Where y'all been? Everybody left.

228
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,950
Making the rounds.
Morris got a hot show tonight.

229
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,532
- We should check it out.
- I ain't interested.

230
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,917
When you see what he's got,
you will be.

231
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,875
- Yeah? What?
- Your future wife, that's what.

232
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,751
- She could turn butter into cream.
- Let's go to Morris' and play.

233
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,096
- We can dog the place out.
- Revenge! Yes.

234
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,721
Besides, somebody's gotta tag
that stella.

235
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,143
- Too fine, huh?
- She's three fine.

236
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,726
So...

237
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,523
...what do you write in your book?

238
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,451
- Poems.
- Poems.

239
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,820
About what?

240
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:38,039
You...

241
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,161
...and I.

242
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,744
The sky. Everything.

243
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,642
Next two weeks' advance.
I like your style, honey.

244
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,021
Thank you, Mr. Day.

245
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:06,225
By the way, about my audition,
I worked out something with the band.

246
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:09,819
- I thought I could just show you.
- Yeah. I already told Jerome.

247
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,270
This is your night...

248
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,317
...band's all ready when you are.
- Really? Okay, thank you.

249
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:19,165
You know...

250
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,828
...I'm sorry. Maybe I judged you wrong.

251
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,328
It's just that I knew a man like you once.

252
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:27,664
All he cared about was money
and drawers.

253
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:30,546
Must have been a musician.

254
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,463
You guessed it.

255
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:38,219
You know, every night I would kneel
down to say my prayers...

256
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:41,181
...and he would say,
"You better pray for a strong back...

257
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:43,513
...because I'm knocking it out tonight,
baby. "

258
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,810
Morris, let me out of...

259
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:53,189
Still, forever searching
for the spiritual substitute.

260
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,117
For what?

261
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,699
For sex.

262
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,329
By the way, you have a lovely place.

263
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:06,501
Yes, I have the best music...

264
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,797
...the best dancing girls, and the best
guest any club could have:

265
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,677
<i>It's working. </i>

266
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:17,098
- Me.
<i>- Shit. </i>

267
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:22,596
<i>Come on, Aura. Go for it. </i>

268
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:27,014
Come here.
I'd like to ask you something.

269
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,737
Do you believe in the hereafter?

270
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:35,241
I'd like for you to read
some of my poems.

271
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:39,404
<i>You're mine now. </i>

272
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:46,034
My dear, this afternoon...

273
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,833
...inspiration struck me...

274
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:51,380
...like a thunderbolt.

275
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,709
And I have composed, in your honor...

276
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:58,097
...a masterpiece entitled
"The Love Machine. "

277
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:04,270
Love. There isn't a man alive
who truly understands the word.

278
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,348
I'm a man.

279
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:09,935
I'm definitely alive.

280
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,111
And I'd love to change your mind.

281
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,941
Like Robin... Hey, lady, where you going?

282
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,863
Tell your boy we're through.

283
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:22,318
Hey, girl, calm down.

284
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:25,617
He's trying to put some things together
for the band. Be cool.

285
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:31,379
Baby, dogs travel in packs of seven.
And you better watch out for this one.

286
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:34,750
Excuse me.

287
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:40,401
- Sexiness to the left of you.
- Sexiness to the right.

288
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,441
It's all about the pimp sandwich tonight.

289
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,070
- Two?
- Maybe.

290
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,654
- Two.
- Two.

291
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:53,738
Let's go.

292
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,529
Pull over, boy.

293
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:57,624
Man, look. This fool is following us.
Rat patrol.

294
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,431
What time is it?

295
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:05,685
Jerome.

296
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,353
Throw away my data bank.

297
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,444
- This is a number one.
- What you gonna do, man?

298
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,741
Oh, I'm not gonna take it.

299
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:22,456
I just want her to go to sleep.
And when she wakes up...

300
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:26,543
...she'll fall in love with
the first face she sees.

301
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:30,587
I'll fall in love with
the first face I see.

302
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:38,892
Jerome, fill up this glass.
Our houseguest is thirsty.

303
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,433
The first face she sees.

304
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:49,560
Then again, a little kiss won't hurt
the program.

305
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:59,819
Damn! Jerome, where's the matches?

306
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:05,157
Morris. What you doing, man?
As if I don't know.

307
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:08,244
Shit. It's dark in here.

308
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:12,918
Man, just let me feel her chest one time.
I got to. Come on, man.

309
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,012
Oh, cousin.

310
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,180
You ain't gonna believe this.
She got hair on her chest.

311
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:26,262
A.

312
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,349
B.

313
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:33,424
C.

314
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:37,148
D.

315
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:54,332
No, baby.

316
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:59,128
His.

317
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:10,681
Talk.

318
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:16,396
What's the matter,
ain't got nothing to say?

319
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:56,516
You won't ever lose.

320
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:04,932
You shouldn't get too close to me.

321
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:11,357
I'm not gonna be here very long.

322
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:16,700
I don't care if you are the mayor.
I told you...

323
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:19,791
...I'll give you your money
when I got it to give you.

324
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,294
You just make sure you keep
the police off my block.

325
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:27,794
- How come you dogged me last night?
- We were talking about business things.

326
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:30,126
You were talking about the wild thing.

327
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,584
Grace.

328
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:35,764
George grabbed 19,500 last night,
Morris. We made a killing!

329
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:38,686
Give me a break on that noise.
I know what he made.

330
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:44,145
- Just trying to bring you good news.
- Yeah? I didn't rattle your cage, all right?

331
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,647
- Now, where's Jimmy and Terry?
- They'll be here any minute. Just relax.

332
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:52,820
They're late. Dock them $ 100 each.
And don't tell me to relax, boy!

333
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,824
Y'all think it's easy
running Seven Corners.

334
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:59,080
I got city officials on my ass
day and night.

335
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,787
The fire marshal, the mayor, everybody!

336
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:04,168
You're mad because of last night.

337
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,496
That's what I wanna know.
What happened?

338
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:10,420
It ain't about mad.
It's about discipline.

339
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:12,552
Listen, cash...

340
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:15,053
...my family never had anything.

341
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:18,011
And I intend to keep
what it is I got.

342
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:21,388
- Understand?
- Yeah, well, you better stop cursing me.

343
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:25,513
You bad now, huh?

344
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,849
- Yeah.
- Wanna try me?

345
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:29,861
Come with it.

346
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:35,199
- Let's go, then.
- All right.

347
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:56,260
- It's cool.
- Yeah.

348
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:06,560
Oh, no. That's no fair.
Oh, man.

349
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,894
Now, if you don't mind,
would you go to the bridge...

350
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:15,193
...find my stella
and buy her some clothes?

351
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,775
I want her to look nice tonight.

352
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,031
Damn.

353
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,496
Ever been inside Morris' club?

354
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,752
It's really nice.

355
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:33,374
On the outside, it's very nice.

356
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,382
It's the inside I got a problem with.

357
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,557
Who am I to judge?

358
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:47,355
I still write imaginary letters to my dad.

359
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:52,853
Guess I'd be pretty freaked
if he returned one, huh?

360
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,615
I don't know.

361
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:00,659
Maybe that's what I need.

362
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:03,574
Some kind of sign.

363
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:09,289
Some kind of green light that says,
"It's okay.

364
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:12,289
It's okay to continue.

365
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:15,749
Somebody's up there listening. "

366
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:25,887
It's hard to see green...

367
00:52:29,191 --> 00:52:31,314
...when there's so much blue.

368
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:43,072
Hey. Come here.

369
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:52,829
<i>I'll fall in love with the first face I see. </i>

370
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,881
There's so many things
you don't know about me.

371
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:48,385
Nothing matters anymore.

372
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,062
Kid, listen.

373
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,532
I'm gonna have to leave you soon.

374
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,870
I told you, nothing matters anymore.

375
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:04,963
<i>Nobody likes my music. </i>

376
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:10,346
<i>I told you, don't deal from that place. </i>
<i>Every time you do, you'll lose. </i>

377
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:13,100
<i>But you lose nothing... </i>

378
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:15,353
<i>... from believing. </i>

379
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:21,267
What time is it?

380
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:24,862
I'm sorry we're late, but you won't
guess who's coming to dinner.

381
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,409
What?

382
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:37,994
What is your main problem?

383
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:46,220
I wanna battle tonight.

384
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:50,053
- Boy, don't you know who I am?
- Let me show him, Morris.

385
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,506
- Oh, Christ.
- No, man.

386
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:54,520
- Bring him over here.
- Bring that nigga.

387
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:58,684
You can't battle me, son.

388
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:03,278
- You're still wet behind the ears.
- Wet behind the ears.

389
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,816
- Psych.
- You still got the price tag on you.

390
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:09,451
Don't you who I am?

391
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:11,359
I wrote the book.

392
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:17,700
I cook young brothers like you
and spit out the seeds.

393
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:20,583
- I don't need you.
- Tell him.

394
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:23,507
- I'm the one you need.
- You need.

395
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:26,427
I took you in when you was
down and out.

396
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:27,875
Down and out.

397
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:30,213
I gave you money.

398
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:32,389
Money.

399
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,015
And now you think you got clout?

400
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:38,184
You can't battle me, baby.

401
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:40,399
I'll kick your little ass...

402
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:43,734
...and have you running home to mama
good and plenty fast.

403
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:45,279
Tell him where you live.

404
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:50,400
Oh, and by the way,
when she getting out the nut house?

405
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:52,700
Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

406
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:55,409
You know, I miss them back rubs.

407
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:02,296
Now, get him out of here.

408
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:05,293
Morris.

409
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:09,718
Don't be afraid. Battle me.

410
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,556
You and your crew can whup ours,
you take the club.

411
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:15,184
Lock, keys and all.

412
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:18,229
If not, it's mine.

413
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:21,851
Down?

414
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,563
Down. Now, get out.

415
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:38,244
- Don't worry about it.
- He's talking stupid.

416
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:04,563
You did a wonderful job,
and I was thinking that maybe later...

417
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:08,689
<i>Dear Dad:</i>

418
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:11,355
<i>I've been trying hard to stay</i>
<i>out of trouble... </i>

419
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:14,404
<i>... but Morris is starting it up</i>
<i>with me again. </i>

420
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:17,985
<i>A man can only take so much. </i>

421
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:23,159
<i>Should I fight him? Or should I</i>
<i>take the easy way out like you did?</i>

422
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:28,542
Let's do this, let's do this,
let's do this!

423
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:36,632
Let me see if I can't tune this.

424
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,432
Look out, Monte, here it comes.

425
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:50,529
So much for round one.

426
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:53,367
Let's see how good he plays now,
without no gear.

427
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:01,411
- Let's go, dude.
- Man, ain't playing, my ass!

428
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:40,405
<i>Seven Corners</i>
<i>Two souls fight</i>

429
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:44,834
<i>One wants money</i>
<i>One wants light</i>

430
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:48,287
<i>Child is a spirit neither one can ignore</i>

431
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:51,251
<i>Here to show them heaven's door</i>

432
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:54,922
<i>Whatever you ask of me... </i>

433
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,756
<i>... I will do</i>

434
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:04,854
All right. Let me hip you to
the rules of the battle.

435
01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:08,272
We kick our hardest groove.
They kick theirs.

436
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:12,315
Last battle ended in a draw,
but this time it's for the Glam Slam.

437
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:14,397
We're gonna kill him!

438
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:17,610
Running down deep,
I know there's good in Morris.

439
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:21,738
I can make him stop.

440
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:24,914
Never.

441
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,869
Whatever it takes...

442
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:31,464
...I'll make him stop.

443
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:40,969
It's my time. And I say shake!

444
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:58,238
Whoever battles me,
you better bring an army.

445
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:01,367
Better bring an army,
sure enough.

446
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:10,875
Damn! I told you we should've
played a different song.

447
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:13,338
Kid's gonna lose, man.

448
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:16,668
<i>Heaven, what shall I do now?</i>

449
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:22,635
<i>I'm losing him. </i>

450
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:43,407
Hey, Mom!

451
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:49,579
Kid! Don't, baby! Come back!

452
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:06,933
<i>Whatever you ask of me... </i>

453
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:09,897
<i>... I will do. </i>

454
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:23,988
I want you to have this.

455
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,161
My poems are like my children.

456
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:30,669
One day, this one's gonna
make his mama proud.

457
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:32,836
Aren't you, baby?

458
01:09:33,715 --> 01:09:35,507
Yes, Mommy.

459
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:42,011
Wanna see where I write?

460
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:46,262
Yeah. Sure.

461
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:53,024
This way.

462
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:13,462
Kid, you can't fight fire with fire.

463
01:10:13,714 --> 01:10:17,213
When a man screams,
you must learn to whisper.

464
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:21,715
You're gonna win, Kid.

465
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:24,430
Don't give up.

466
01:10:26,143 --> 01:10:28,301
Don't ever give up.

467
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:45,655
The Time is taking over the Glam Slam!
You better come get your stuff, man!

468
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,921
Come on in, Tevin.
It's getting ready to storm again.

469
01:10:56,089 --> 01:10:57,632
All right, Mom.

470
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:01,713
You love to stay out late at night,
don't you?

471
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:17,390
Damn!

472
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:21,103
I didn't even get a chance to rap.

473
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:34,077
<i>"To whom it may concern. </i>

474
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:37,586
<i>All income derived from</i>
<i>the following accounts:</i>

475
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:42,252
Clinton Club, Melody Cool,
Glam Slam...

476
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:46,211
...will be payable directly to me. "

477
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:55,060
What's up with this half-and-half bitch?
Am I number one or number two?

478
01:11:55,232 --> 01:11:57,901
Tell me now
because I really don't need this shit!

479
01:11:58,068 --> 01:12:00,025
Put some treble on that tone...

480
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:03,778
...or you gonna be pulling some
Stacy Adams out your ass!

481
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:08,491
Now, you know I'm the baddest.

482
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:15,039
Who's built the best?

483
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:19,831
Damn.

484
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:02,913
We'll be right back
after a commercial break.

485
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:10,473
You hit Melody.
The rest of us will bogart George.

486
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:11,921
- Fellas.
- Yeah!

487
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,381
- Let's do it.
- Yo!

488
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:18,646
All we got to do
is have George sign the deed.

489
01:13:18,815 --> 01:13:22,267
- Then we out of here.
- Oh, he'll sign it, one way or another.

490
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:25,602
Listen, let me give you
a piece of good advice!

491
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:27,608
And I do get paid for counseling.

492
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:30,903
Sign the club over, Melody,
or we'll wreck you too.

493
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:35,241
Who are you, walking around
telling everybody what to do?

494
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:38,333
I've been laying low,
respecting Billy's dying wishes.

495
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:40,909
But when you start
bogarting me and George...

496
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:44,291
...you mess with the food on our dishes.
- Ain't that a shame.

497
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,718
All right, Melody's getting ready to rap!

498
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:56,640
I've seen many bridges in my time
and crossed every one of them...

499
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:59,018
...with no trouble at all.

500
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:05,069
I had trials and tribulations,
heartaches and pains.

501
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,606
- Well, that's all right.
- Survived them all, baby.

502
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:11,993
I'm still Melody. And I'm still cool.

503
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:07,680
- Go, get out of here.
- Grab him.

504
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,730
- Get back!
- I'll hold him. I'll hold him. I got him.

505
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:40,968
George! Don't!

506
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:43,508
Don't do it, man.

507
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:50,268
- Hey!
- Get him! He's got the deed, man!

508
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:52,271
Go after him, man!

509
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:57,401
Don't give up.

510
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:03,034
You won't ever lose.

511
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:12,505
<i>Whatever you ask of me, I will do. </i>

512
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:16,838
Man! Oh, shit!

513
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:22,760
No!

514
01:17:35,072 --> 01:17:36,352
Who got hit?

515
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:42,533
- What happened?
- Somebody get an ambulance!

516
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:44,662
It's right down the street.

517
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:49,291
All right. Okay.

518
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:54,335
- I never saw her. Damn.
- I got him. I got him.

519
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:56,958
Robin, go see.

520
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:39,707
I have just one question for you.

521
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:41,839
I'm listening.

522
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:44,382
How do you wanna die?

523
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:50,469
<i>When a man screams,</i>
<i>you must learn to whisper. </i>

524
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:11,409
<i>It's just around the corner. </i>

525
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:22,798
<i>I told you, don't deal from that place. </i>
<i>Every time you do, you'll lose. </i>

526
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:34,139
<i>But you lose nothing... </i>

527
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:36,149
<i>... from believing. </i>

528
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:39,985
<i>You're gonna win, Kid. </i>

529
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:43,107
<i>Don't give up. </i>

530
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:45,277
Don't ever give up.

531
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:52,302
Just let him have the club, Morris.

532
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,123
Go see what's up.

533
01:24:56,889 --> 01:25:00,304
Man, can you believe it?
The Kid won.

534
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:03,844
And with a ballad. Damn!

535
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:24,781
<i>Are there really angels?</i>

536
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,658
<i>Or are they just in our mind?</i>

537
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:30,877
<i>It all comes out in the wash... </i>

538
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:33,297
<i>... in time. </i>

539
01:25:56,448 --> 01:25:59,235
One, two, three!

540
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:08,615
Oh, man, my skillet!

541
01:26:09,545 --> 01:26:12,380
- I'm gonna blast somebody!
- No, you don't.

542
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:15,841
Just let me...

543
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:21,088
Come on, baby. Robin's got something
that'll take your mind off all that.

544
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:24,090
But my skillet!
Somebody painted my skillet!

545
01:26:24,268 --> 01:26:26,556
Come on upstairs.

546
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:51,059
Morris, turn off the light.
