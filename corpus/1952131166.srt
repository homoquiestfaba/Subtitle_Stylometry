1
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:23,192
Danny?

2
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:32,206
<i>Okay, so you've heard of,</i>
<i>Dick Wagner, right?</i>

3
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,279
Yeah, sure.
70's band called Frost.

4
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,746
Yeah, but did you know he was in
a group from Michigan...

5
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,786
- before then called "The Bossmen"?
- Yeah, no, I love them.

6
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:42,784
Sort of pseudo-Beatles?

7
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:46,856
I've got original 45's of "Take a Look"
and "Here's Congratulations".

8
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:48,007
Oh, yeah?
Well...

9
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,824
I'm guessing you don't have the single
that's got "You're the Girl"...

10
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,022
and "Wait and See" on it?

11
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:55,791
Nobody's got that. That's the only Record
I'm missing from my 60's garage bands.

12
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,098
I've got the Plagues...

13
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,164
The Sheffields, The Five Emprees,
The Rationals from Detroit...

14
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,435
You know what? It just so happens
I was in Detroit last week...

15
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:11,415
doing a piece of paper, and who do you
think I bumped into at a record shop?

16
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:15,018
- Who'd you run into, Phil?
- Well, I ran into Pete Woodman...

17
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,952
- the Bossmen's drummer.
- No shit.

18
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:19,650
And he's got extra copies
of all that stuff.

19
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,249
- Danny?
- Can you get me one?

20
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,659
It's past lunch time.
Take your break.

21
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:25,185
Oh, shit!

22
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,430
I was supposed
to meet Denise for lunch.

23
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:31,897
See you later, man.

24
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:33,896
Phil!

25
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,265
I've got to hear
"You're The Girl", okay?

26
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,569
- Get me that record?
- You got it, man.

27
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,857
Hey, Danny.

28
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,915
Hey, Sara.
I'm sorry, I'm kinda in a hurry.

29
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,120
I was just wondering
are you moving?

30
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,592
No, why?

31
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,599
I saw your sofa in the alley
and I thought...

32
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,738
Hi. I'm looking for a patient.
Billy?

33
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,374
William Dornboss?

34
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,275
Drug rehab.

35
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,582
- What are you doing?
- Polishing.

36
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:03,455
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- You know, around the building, mostly.

37
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,764
So what happened, Danny?

38
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,099
So what happened what?

39
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,069
"What happened what?" What happened
with you and Denise, what happened?

40
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,936
Well, who said anything happened?

41
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:18,541
Danny,
it's written all over your face.

42
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,076
I can smell it from over here.
I can taste it...

43
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,714
she dumped you, man.
I've seen that look a thousand times.

44
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,747
Hell, I've seen that look
in the mirror.

45
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,114
Oh, man, fuck it, you know?

46
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,123
She had no taste. She would gather up
her clothes in a rage and throw them on.

47
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,287
She'd look like a Wal-Mart
exploded right near her.

48
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,964
She did you a favor, man.
I don't know why you liked her.

49
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,166
Well, she was pretty...

50
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:44,434
nice.

51
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,571
"Nice." What are you gonna do
with "nice", Danny?

52
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,266
What can you do with "nice"?

53
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,740
And she was pretty, but you know what?
She was too pretty.

54
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:53,744
Pretty things always have a tragic end
one of the laws of nature.

55
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:57,270
It only serves to make them more
beautiful. It would have ended badly.

56
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,781
- Sometimes you scare me.
- The truth is scary.

57
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,225
I gotta go. I gotta...

58
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,787
When are you getting out
of here?

59
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,757
Two days.

60
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,629
Hey, listen, Danny.

61
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,668
Before you go, you should check out
the psycho ward down the hall.

62
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,969
It's very entertaining. They've got
this guy there, he's fucked.

63
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,370
He's got this black hood over his head
and he's all strapped up.

64
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,141
It's very creepy.

65
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,146
- Take care of yourself.
- Enjoy.

66
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,177
You're really not supposed to be
in here.

67
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:10,278
I'm a relative.

68
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,447
She doesn't have any relatives
that's why she's in here.

69
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,881
I'm sorry. I...

70
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,482
I was just curious.
I have a friend here.

71
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:20,181
- What, rehab?
- Yeah.

72
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,951
Yeah, I can guess who.

73
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:26,996
Would you ask Mister Dornboss
to return the knobs...

74
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,765
and the locks to the doors?

75
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,766
It really is something
of a nuisance...

76
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,739
and in some cases hazardous
to the patients.

77
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,572
Now, will you excuse us?

78
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,436
No, I'll leave. I was just...

79
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,140
wondering... I mean she...

80
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,247
she looks healthy.
She doesn't look sick.

81
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:51,514
Well, there's really nothing wrong
with her except she's asleep.

82
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:55,326
She has a condition known as
"Kleine-Levin Syndrome"...

83
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,928
accompanied by cataplexy.

84
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,896
- Are you a medical student?
- No, Art.

85
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,598
Oh, thank God.

86
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,669
Have you ever heard
of narcolepsy?

87
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:08,797
Yeah, that's where
you fall asleep a lot.

88
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:13,777
Yeah, well, in Miss Baxter's case,
she is asleep most of the time.

89
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,715
It's the result
of an automobile accident...

90
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,540
before she was born.

91
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,617
And she doesn't wake up?

92
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,947
Oh, no, she wakes occasionally
for a few minutes...

93
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:26,149
we never really know when
or for how long.

94
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,349
It's an interesting phenomena...

95
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,689
it's rare.

96
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:37,227
She's really only lived
a small portion of her life.

97
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,730
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah.

98
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,830
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

99
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:20,567
And that is, like, '66 or '67, is it?
Oh, my God, that's Alan Price...

100
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,836
that's Alan "House of the
Fucking Rising Sun" Price!

101
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,369
My god, I don't even think
they released this, you know?

102
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,438
I mean, they made this after...
after he left The Animals.

103
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,346
Yeah, I wonder what
that story was?

104
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:36,547
Why leave a hit group, with huge chart
hits right when you're on top?

105
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,183
Well, from what I heard,
he was just afraid to fly, you know?

106
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,353
He was just not gonna get on a plane.
So that... that was it.

107
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:46,397
It's kinda hard to have a music career
if you don't fly, right?

108
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:52,230
Well, that is life, you don't take the
big risks, you don't get the goodies.

109
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,967
I gotta get out of here, but,
I talked to The Bossmen's drummer...

110
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,599
and he's gonna send me
those copies.

111
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,772
And if you don't pull any more
shit on me, you might get one.

112
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,609
- Bye!
- See you.

113
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,810
- Yes?
- Hi. Mrs. Mulliner?

114
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,221
I'm Mrs. Sloan, your
"Molly Kay Cosmetics" representative.

115
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,653
Hi. My name is Danny.
What's yours?

116
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,984
Mom?

117
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,653
Mom?

118
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,622
Mom!

119
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,040
<i>I'll bet you're glad to be</i>
<i>out of there.</i>

120
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,870
I don't know, I was starting to like
that place. It suits me, I think.

121
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,742
- Really?
- The psych' ward was really sweet.

122
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,306
There's a lot of really intense
character studies in there.

123
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:55,645
I'd like to go and paint some
of the really fucked up ones...

124
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,123
you know what I mean? Speaking of which,
did you see their genuine serial killer?

125
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,886
Yeah... the, guy in the,
padded cell?

126
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,485
- Yeah, creepy, huh?
- Yeah.

127
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:09,398
One of the orderlies told me his story.
He was a rare book dealer, a mesmerist.

128
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,868
He was arrested after
he hypnotized his girlfriend...

129
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,633
and ordered her to jump off
the roof of a building.

130
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:19,869
And at trial, he got the prosecutor to
park his car, on the Metro-Rail tracks...

131
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,312
twenty-three people dead,
a hundred and three people injured.

132
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,848
- No, that's not true.
- It's totally true.

133
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:28,451
Don't you remember that train
derailment four years back?

134
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,815
- Yeah.
- The work of Byron Volpe.

135
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,154
Apparently, he's got these crazy eyes
that's why they keep the hood on him.

136
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,623
You know I saw them?

137
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,026
- You saw the crazy eyes?
- Yeah, just a second, but...

138
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,926
you know, if he's so crazy,
how come he's not in prison?

139
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:45,265
Yeah, some kind of conflicting
psych evaluations, legal wranglings.

140
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:47,234
They say he's some kind
of genius.

141
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:49,466
Well, if he's such a genius,
how come he's locked up?

142
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,934
He's too smart.
Stupid people have it made.

143
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,343
- Stupid people?
- Stupid people and ugly people.

144
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:56,345
- Ugly people?
- Yes.

145
00:16:56,414 --> 00:17:00,976
Too smart or too beautiful, you draw too
much attention to yourself. However...

146
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,680
if you're a little thick and your face
looks like it was kissed...

147
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:07,282
by a Mack truck, you can just sit back
and enjoy life going by...

148
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,883
like a tennis match.

149
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:12,428
It's beautiful.

150
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,962
Speaking of which,
did you see "Sleeping Beauty"?

151
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,927
What do you mean?

152
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,539
That hot little "cream puff"
in the room next to "Ted Bundy".

153
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,734
You went in there?

154
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:29,771
Yeah, I went in there and apparently
you did, too. Good looking girl, huh?

155
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,746
Weird about her though,
don't you think?

156
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,111
Being asleep all the time.

157
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,219
Gotta be the perfect girl, though,
don't you think?

158
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,518
I mean, women, they're mostly decorative
anyway and the one's that aren't...

159
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,617
they're too much trouble.

160
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,561
I would like to see what she'd have
to say for herself if she woke her up.

161
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,723
Just stay away from her, okay?

162
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,396
Hey, Danny.

163
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,902
What have you gotten
yourself into?

164
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,397
It's just...

165
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,635
you know, it's nothing.
It's just...

166
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,871
they say you have to be careful
how you talk to her.

167
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,302
Well...

168
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,617
I won't corrupt her. She's all yours.
I like my women a little more lively.

169
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,310
She's all yours
for the next couple days.

170
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,078
What do you mean?

171
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,592
I heard some shrinks talking.
They're gonna move her to some lab...

172
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,686
gonna make some kind of experiment
out of her... like Frankenstein.

173
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,632
A poem by Byron Volpe.

174
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,669
"The wanderer stopped
to turn over a rock.

175
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,438
The rock gave way...

176
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,549
and what was below
ruined his day."

177
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,153
Leave her alone, pussycat.

178
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:19,786
She's mine in time in time,
she's mine.

179
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,485
Tick, tick, tick.

180
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,959
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

181
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,195
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

182
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,696
Hi, Laura. It's Danny,
I've brought something for you.

183
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,910
Classical music is the best,
isn't it?

184
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,286
I wish you would wake up.

185
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,655
There's a lot that
we could talk about.

186
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,593
Life just must seem like a...

187
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:02,460
a big dream to you.

188
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,899
I wonder if you have
re-occurring dreams?

189
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,530
You know, I do.

190
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,873
I dream that I'm...

191
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,441
back at home.

192
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,912
with Mom and Dad...

193
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,119
before Dad died and...

194
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,187
I'm in bed
and everything is...

195
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,019
cool.

196
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,727
And then I wake up...

197
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,360
and I'm here.

198
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,962
Jesus Christ.

199
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:26,108
We can take normalized readings
for later tabulations.

200
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,708
You may only have a few minutes.

201
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,152
The duration of her waking state
can vary from seconds...

202
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:33,349
- to sometimes almost an hour.
- Excuse me, what's going on?

203
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,550
- I thought she has no relatives.
- He's not a relative. He's...

204
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,857
Young man, you have to leave.
I thought we talked about this.

205
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,261
- I was about to tell him.
- You're... you're scaring her.

206
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:43,960
Is there any reason why we can't take
her to the clinic, Thursday morning?

207
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,560
I just want to point out
I want you to be careful with her.

208
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,663
I don't want her wake up
in some strange environment.

209
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,071
She doesn't know
what's going on!

210
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,665
Hey, listen, don't worry,
she's gonna be taken care of.

211
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,576
- Hey, just... just let me talk to her.
- No, wait. You're going to have to leave.

212
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,635
- Get him out of here.
- Yes.

213
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:56,680
We have to get this done.

214
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,409
Now, you're gonna have to leave
or we'll have to call security.

215
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,280
Son, listen.
Come here, listen.

216
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:02,649
Hey, you're gonna have to go now.
She's in good hands.

217
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,245
We're just gonna have to move her
somewhere where she can get some help.

218
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,757
That's a lie. You're just gonna
treat her like some lab rat!

219
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,851
- Nurse...
- Yeah. I'm gonna have to call security.

220
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,486
Okay, okay. I'll go.
Just... just please take care of her.

221
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,452
<i>Dr. Bhyle,</i>
<i>do you have any comments?</i>

222
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,322
<i>I know that you're going to ask me</i>
<i>about the Collier boy.</i>

223
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:44,918
<i>Look, that was just</i>
<i>an unfortunate circumstance.</i>

224
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:49,524
<i>We had no idea that he had a pre-existing</i>
<i>medical condition. It was a sad error.</i>

225
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,592
<i>What about the allegations</i>
<i>of abuse, doctor?</i>

226
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,767
<i>We've always treated our research</i>
<i>subjects with the greatest of care.</i>

227
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:59,159
<i>He's here!</i>

228
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,331
<i>And he's taking her!</i>

229
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,204
Okay...

230
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,703
You are?

231
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,603
I'm...

232
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:54,317
I'm from the Bhyle Center
for Sleep Studies.

233
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,986
I'm transferring this patient...

234
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,486
from room 1169?

235
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,317
And a...

236
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,592
Laura Baxter.

237
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,693
This...
this is room 1169, right?

238
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:11,900
Yeah.

239
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,198
Everything okay?

240
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:17,940
Yeah.

241
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,903
You know, I heard some
commotion down the hall, there.

242
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:26,108
Yeah, our guy in the rubber room
got a little frisky...

243
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,516
thinks someone's stealing
his girlfriend.

244
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:33,054
- You're lucky he didn't get loose.
- Yeah.

245
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,684
- Okay.
- <i>She's mine!</i>

246
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,152
<i>She's mine!</i>

247
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:10,894
What?

248
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:15,230
No!

249
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,432
What?

250
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,365
Fingers, things?

251
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,602
What?

252
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,670
Window?
Things coming at you?

253
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:23,863
The car?

254
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,910
What...

255
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,938
you've never been driving?

256
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:32,082
Out!

257
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,274
- Okay.
- Out!

258
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,023
What are you doing, babe?

259
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:48,092
You wanna get in the car?

260
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:53,729
Hi.

261
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:56,035
You're showing
your underwear, babe.

262
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,407
Oh, you don't know
where that's been.

263
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,308
Honey, don't put that...

264
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,846
She's into nature.
Grew up in New York.

265
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,577
Honey, let's get in the car.

266
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:10,945
Sorry.

267
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,254
Oh, no, don't eat that.

268
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:21,761
She does this a lot.

269
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:25,000
And...

270
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:28,138
Let's go.

271
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,601
Kinda heavy.

272
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,178
It's the medication
she's been on.

273
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,344
She had pneumonia
about a month ago.

274
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,206
No. It's okay.

275
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,651
Nothing's gonna hurt you.

276
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:21,514
It's okay.

277
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:27,257
Nothing's going to hurt you.

278
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:35,495
We are going...

279
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,204
to hospital?

280
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,343
No.

281
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,342
We're going home.

282
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,441
Home... home?

283
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:49,518
Yeah.

284
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,348
We're going to my home...

285
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:52,887
it's where I live.

286
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:57,822
Is... is that okay?

287
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,403
Okay.

288
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:31,753
<i>Tick, tick, tick,</i>
<i>tick, tick.</i>

289
00:30:31,962 --> 00:30:35,227
So, I was hoping you might remember
something more about this guy.

290
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,668
He just seemed like a good kid.

291
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:40,335
I think that's a quote
from Hitler's mom.

292
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,165
Any idea where he lives?

293
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,637
- Did you check with the main desk?
- Yeah, we did that...

294
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,143
but the name and number
were phony, so...

295
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,108
What's up with that guy?

296
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,748
Delusional, psychopathic,
sociopathic.

297
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,215
<i>Tick, tick, tick.</i>

298
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:57,214
The bad guy.

299
00:30:58,255 --> 00:30:59,552
What's he saying?

300
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,118
"Tick...

301
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,785
Tick...

302
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:04,719
tick."

303
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,564
He just says it over and over.

304
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,394
Who does he think he is,
a fucking clock?

305
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,403
Why is he like that?

306
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:19,075
He's convinced that the girl,
Laura Baxter, belongs to him.

307
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,738
He shattered both legs
and broke the nose of an attendants...

308
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:25,111
who was trying to restrain him.
He was trying to get loose.

309
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,113
And then he took
the man's broken nose...

310
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:29,812
and he tried to shove it up
into his brain...

311
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:31,778
almost killed him.

312
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,620
No, that's the best arrangement
for Mister Volpe right now.

313
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:38,192
Volpe?
That's Byron Volpe in there?

314
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:41,357
The most soulless person
I've ever met.

315
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:46,200
I remember this case.
A hypnotist or something.

316
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,463
- Uncanny ability with it.
- Yeah?

317
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:50,863
Hypnosis is bullshit.

318
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,839
Tell that to his wife.

319
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,343
She died trying to get away
from his hold over her.

320
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,478
Who knows how many people
that "scuzball" has killed?

321
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,778
I was on that case.

322
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:05,216
We never found all the bodies,
only the ones he wanted us to find...

323
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,688
- the ones that looked like a suicide.
- Okay.

324
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,319
Thanks, Doctor.

325
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,621
Oh, Detective.
I just remembered something.

326
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,925
The young man who came to visit I think
he might have had a friend in here.

327
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:21,536
It was a court-ordered
drug rehab case.

328
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,599
<i>A speed-freak named Dornboss.</i>

329
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,501
We can check the records.

330
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,344
Yeah. I'd like.

331
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:33,580
Lovely clientele you got here.

332
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,214
It's strawberry.

333
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,293
Cold...

334
00:34:58,495 --> 00:34:59,860
No, it's gonna fall.

335
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:13,533
You're actually supposed
to keep it in the...

336
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,202
cone.

337
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,448
It's so beautiful.

338
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,521
I just got you cleaned up.

339
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,664
Now I'm gonna have to give you
another bath.

340
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,990
I mean, uh...

341
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:43,669
I'm gonna get a napkin.

342
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,338
Laura?

343
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,962
<i>Tick, tick, tick,</i>
<i>tick, tick.</i>

344
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,766
<i>Tick, tick, tick,</i>
<i>tick, tick.</i>

345
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,029
<i>This is not my world...</i>

346
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:53,909
<i>I don't belong here...</i>

347
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,952
Back...

348
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:05,954
Take me back.

349
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:06,852
I wanna go back.

350
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,454
Just take me back.

351
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,792
<i>Laura?</i>

352
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,522
<i>You are my blood.</i>
<i>I am you.</i>

353
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:18,728
<i>You have nothing to fear from me.</i>
<i>It is the "Clouded Man" who stalks you.</i>

354
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:30,009
Okay, Laura, you gotta wake up.

355
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,014
I don't have any feeding tubes.
I've got to feed you, okay? Come on.

356
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:37,378
Okay, good job.
Okay, open your mouth...

357
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,585
there you go.
There you go. There you go.

358
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:44,623
Okay, good job.
Chew.

359
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:48,264
Okay?

360
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:49,397
Shit.

361
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:52,694
I'm just gonna set this here.

362
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,670
If you get hungry you can
just dig on that, okay?

363
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,430
TV.

364
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,169
If you get bored,
you can watch some TV.

365
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,543
<i>A lot of fun this year.</i>
<i>That year, 1995, was sixth ranked...</i>

366
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:06,639
<i>A.U. over fourteenth-ranked</i>
<i>Kansas State.</i>

367
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,378
- <i>The two clubs, well...</i>
- Okay.

368
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,555
Hey.

369
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,989
- Sara.
- Danny. How you doing?

370
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,058
Good.

371
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:19,789
Did I see you come in last night
with a rather good-looking girl?

372
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,096
Uh, yeah.

373
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,789
She's a...
she's a friend from school.

374
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:25,560
She's hot. You wouldn't want
to share, would you?

375
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,670
I could come over, we could party.
You could watch.

376
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:34,509
You know, I'm kinda busy, but...
you got an audition?

377
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:36,277
Oh, this...

378
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:40,543
rock video, high school theme thing,
you know. Tits and ass.

379
00:38:41,418 --> 00:38:44,910
Hey, I gotta get to work but...
good luck with the audition.

380
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:47,215
Yeah. Let me know
if you change your mind.

381
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,242
<i>In other news, the police</i>
<i>are asking for the public's help...</i>

382
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,837
<i>looking for a young woman</i>
<i>named Laura Baxter...</i>

383
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:12,882
<i>who has disappeared</i>
<i>from a local hospital.</i>

384
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,215
<i>Ms. Baxter suffers from a sleep</i>
<i>disorder called "Parasomnia"...</i>

385
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,720
<i>which renders her helpless</i>
<i>most of the time.</i>

386
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:21,015
<i>Authorities are afraid that</i>
<i>she may have been kidnapped.</i>

387
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,057
<i>As you can see</i>
<i>from the security pictures...</i>

388
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:26,061
<i>it's difficult to see</i>
<i>the man's face in the image.</i>

389
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:27,789
<i>They believe the man to be</i>
<i>an art student...</i>

390
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,299
<i>who had come to see Ms. Baxter</i>
<i>on several occasions.</i>

391
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,162
<i>The Public is asked to help</i>

392
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:34,604
<i>Fuck!</i>

393
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,937
<i>Fucking unbelievable.</i>

394
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,102
<i>Sturdy lock on the fucking door.</i>
<i>Damn it!</i>

395
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:43,370
- Sara, what's the matter?
- Somebody broke in.

396
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,540
I think they took a bunch of shit.

397
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:48,013
- Did you call the cops?
- Yeah, immediate.

398
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:52,145
But I'm not gonna wait for them to come.
I'm gonna see exactly what's missing.

399
00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:56,782
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- <i>Fuck sturdy locks on the door. Damn it.</i>

400
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,810
Laura?

401
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:25,412
Laura!

402
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:32,758
Give me an "A"!

403
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,954
Give me a "C"!

404
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,063
Give me a "Z"!

405
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,598
Give me an "R"!

406
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,028
Give me a...

407
00:40:42,104 --> 00:40:43,036
a...

408
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:44,963
a "P"!

409
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,167
What's that spell?

410
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,811
I don't think it spells anything.

411
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,680
Home...

412
00:41:03,193 --> 00:41:04,558
it spells home.

413
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,364
<i>It is there</i>
<i>where your fear dwells.</i>

414
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:51,170
<i>That is the home</i>
<i>of the Clouded Man.</i>

415
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,815
<i>I will love you.</i>

416
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:04,378
<i>I will save you from him.</i>

417
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:20,995
<i>But there are things</i>
<i>you must do for me.</i>

418
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:17,352
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

419
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:19,688
Tick, tick.

420
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:20,886
Laura?

421
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,029
<i>In time, she's mine.</i>
<i>She's mine in time.</i>

422
00:44:29,232 --> 00:44:31,928
<i>In time, she's mine.</i>
<i>She's mine in time.</i>

423
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,029
Hospital?

424
00:46:10,433 --> 00:46:11,400
No...

425
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,126
no hospital.

426
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,173
Home.

427
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:24,704
Did I do wrong?

428
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,643
No, I did.

429
00:46:37,894 --> 00:46:39,418
Please, don't leave me!

430
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,862
<i>Copy that, we're going to the scene.</i>
<i>25.</i>

431
00:47:54,904 --> 00:47:56,030
<i>Attention, cars.</i>

432
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:59,564
<i>A group of boys</i>
<i>is causing distress at the hotel.</i>

433
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:04,577
<i>The receptionist's car was attacked</i>
<i>at the parking lot.</i>

434
00:48:31,941 --> 00:48:32,908
Oh, boy.

435
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,673
<i>It was my plan.</i>

436
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:41,449
Nah.

437
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,414
Anybody touch anything?

438
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,117
No, sir.

439
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:55,555
So what does that mean?

440
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,830
That means
it's gonna be a long day.

441
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:01,396
I swear to God.

442
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,231
Why is it always Monday?

443
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:06,741
Why can't they stretch
this shit out over the week?

444
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,368
'Cause you're supposed to suffer.

445
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,676
'Cause this is purgatory
for a past crime in another life.

446
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:15,716
Hank, what in the hell are you doing
here? You're supposed to be on vacation.

447
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,183
I am on vacation.
I'm having a great time.

448
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,887
So I'm guessing this is not
the work of a boyfriend.

449
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:30,428
No, no, no.

450
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,158
I know what you're thinking.
It can't be him.

451
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:34,335
How do you know?

452
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,463
Because I was at the hospital
doing follow-up...

453
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:39,906
when I got the call to come over here
and I saw him he's locked up tight.

454
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,876
Yeah, being locked up
means nothing to that guy.

455
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:44,743
For all we know, he coulda got
someone else to come do this.

456
00:49:44,747 --> 00:49:46,078
Who Squeaky Fromme?

457
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,344
I'm just saying.

458
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,007
Look, hope that you're right.

459
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,348
This guy only cares about two things
his book store and himself.

460
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:53,646
Three things.

461
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:55,552
- What?
- Three things, the girl.

462
00:49:55,758 --> 00:49:57,157
- Who?
- You know, the girl.

463
00:49:57,926 --> 00:49:59,985
- Oh, the sleeping one, yeah.
- He cares about her.

464
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,496
All right. Three things.

465
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:04,223
- Where's Clark?
- Clark?

466
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,324
Clark!

467
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:06,400
Yes, sir.

468
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,995
- You got that list of tenants for me?
- Yeah.

469
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:11,162
- Thanks, Clark.
- No problem.

470
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:13,840
Which apartments do you want
odd or even?

471
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:16,711
- Odd.
- How'd I know?

472
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:39,767
Just a minute!

473
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:55,908
Yeah.

474
00:50:56,152 --> 00:50:57,244
Daniel Sloan?

475
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,852
Yes.

476
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,219
Detective Conroy.

477
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:04,686
Can I come in? I have a few questions
I want to ask.

478
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:06,989
What about?

479
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:08,796
It'll only take a minute.

480
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:30,880
That's odd...

481
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,929
Tick, tick, tick.

482
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,298
Tick, tick, tick.

483
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:05,181
Danny?

484
00:53:13,122 --> 00:53:14,248
Danny?

485
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,326
Find out who lives here.

486
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,662
Yes, sir.

487
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,100
Danny! What the fuck
are you doing here, man?

488
00:54:37,473 --> 00:54:39,600
Half the fucking planet's
looking for you, man.

489
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,276
The cops were just here.

490
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,308
I told 'em I haven't seen you
since you came to visit me in rehab...

491
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:46,871
but I don't think
they believed me.

492
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:50,013
Jesus, they think you're the next
fuckin' "Zodiac" or something.

493
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,120
Did anyone see you
when you came in here?

494
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,255
Oh, I don't know.

495
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:55,288
Man...

496
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:02,356
all right, well,
why don't you sit down, Danny?

497
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:04,860
You're really fucked.
Just sit down here.

498
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:06,494
I'll get you a beer.

499
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,634
Here, have a cold one.

500
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,733
Yeah, you need to open it, Danny.

501
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,973
You really fucked up, Danny.
You're just really fucked.

502
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:26,387
There was blood everywhere.
She killed them.

503
00:55:26,622 --> 00:55:28,112
Who killed who, Danny?

504
00:55:43,806 --> 00:55:46,900
I tried to wake her up,
but she just won't wake up.

505
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:51,072
You know, we can't have homeless people
lying around here like a flop house.

506
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:54,478
You have to pay more attention
to your department.

507
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:56,979
Hello?

508
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,915
Young lady,
you have to get up.

509
00:56:01,457 --> 00:56:02,947
Maybe she's dead.

510
00:56:03,492 --> 00:56:06,427
She's not dead.
Go get Rudy in sporting goods.

511
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:10,596
That's just about the craziest fucking
story I've ever heard in my life...

512
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:13,533
but there's... a woman involved,
so of course it's true.

513
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:16,299
I mean, no one will ever accuse you of
having a lack of imagination, Danny...

514
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:18,237
certainly not in the women
you choose.

515
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,705
You know, it's funny...

516
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:30,744
as I've been telling you this story
I realized something.

517
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,150
Oh, yeah, what's that?

518
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:36,423
I love her.

519
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:38,859
Great.

520
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:40,086
Of course...
of course you do.

521
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,490
No, no, no.
No, I mean.

522
00:56:41,697 --> 00:56:45,463
I really love her, like I've never loved
anyone else... That's... that's...

523
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:49,365
that's what been wrong with me.
I think I've always loved her, from...

524
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,504
from the first day I saw her.

525
00:56:53,442 --> 00:56:57,469
Danny, she killed two people
that you know about...

526
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,113
and she tried to kill you.

527
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:02,716
No. No, she didn't kill anyone.
Volpe killed those people.

528
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,954
Volpe killed the people.
Right.

529
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:08,555
Well, that's a great story, Danny,
but I don't think you'll have...

530
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,990
- any luck convincing anyone of that.
- No, no. I messed up, I let her down.

531
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,494
I have to help her.
I caused this. This is my fault.

532
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:19,361
Danny, for once in your fucking life,
listen to me, okay?

533
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:23,902
Now, I'm the last person to tell
anyone to go to the police...

534
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,937
but I think you're out of options, man.
You have to go. Danny.

535
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,044
- No.
- Danny, you have to go and tell them...

536
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:32,774
that you did not kill these people, that
it was "Sleeping fucking Beauty", man.

537
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:35,316
No, I can't do that,
I can't betray her. I this is my fault.

538
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,884
Danny, what are we taking
crazy medicine, man?

539
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,581
She'll just fall sleep again.

540
00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:43,318
She's already has a life sentence.
They can't do anything to her.

541
00:57:47,196 --> 00:57:49,096
Then I've got to set her free
from Volpe.

542
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:53,867
Danny?
Danny, what are you gonna do?

543
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,061
Danny, what are you gonna
fuckin' do, man?

544
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:01,275
Billy, if they...
if they catch me.

545
00:58:01,877 --> 00:58:05,904
I was... I was never here.
You were never involved in this, okay?

546
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,477
Go, fine, go.

547
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,417
<i>I've got a 2-15</i>
<i>on that County kidnapping case.</i>

548
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:59,526
<i>They positively I.D.'ed the woman</i>
<i>as kidnap victim Laura Baxter.</i>

549
00:59:59,795 --> 01:00:02,093
<i>She's being returned</i>
<i>to County now.</i>

550
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:03,795
What's my status, over?

551
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:06,157
<i>Give it another hour,</i>
<i>then return.</i>

552
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,724
Hey, buddy. Excuse me.
Visiting hours are...

553
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:09,093
- hey, don't I know you?
- Yeah, my grandmother's here.

554
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:11,461
- Your Grandmother?
- Yeah.

555
01:01:12,034 --> 01:01:13,592
No, not on my floor.

556
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:16,603
Hey, can I see some I. D?

557
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:19,573
Yeah.

558
01:01:26,715 --> 01:01:28,478
You wait right here, okay?
Excuse me.

559
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:31,109
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'm Dr. Egon Bhyle...

560
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,452
and I'm here to pick up a patient
Laura Baxter.

561
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:34,921
Now, if you'll be good enough
to step aside...

562
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,151
Bhyle? Oh, shit!

563
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:51,456
Welcome.

564
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:56,036
I see the clock is running down,
the ticking is about to stop.

565
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:59,299
A willing partner
for our Danse Macabre.

566
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:03,405
The Clouded Man approaches,
with weapon in hand.

567
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:07,981
Which is really much less Shakespearean
and Hugh B. Cave, don't you think?

568
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:11,048
We really must elevate
your reading habits.

569
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:14,314
Have you ever read "Great Expectations"?
A wonderful book.

570
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:18,289
I think you should really should think
of me more like Magwitch...

571
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,486
the old benefactor.

572
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:20,753
Shut up!

573
01:03:21,096 --> 01:03:23,496
You're to save
the Sleeping Beauty.

574
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:26,759
My dear "Pip",
a kiss isn't going to do it.

575
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,969
She's an orphan,
with an orphan's disease.

576
01:03:30,238 --> 01:03:32,229
She's not going to be fixed.

577
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:33,840
I'll help her.

578
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:37,001
She's mine only...

579
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:41,205
and I've have had her many times
in those dark dreams we share.

580
01:03:42,651 --> 01:03:45,017
A bit of advice for the future...

581
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,217
never assume.

582
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:53,627
Shit.

583
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,724
Freeze!

584
01:03:58,934 --> 01:04:00,526
You move again,
you'll be talking to Jesus!

585
01:04:00,602 --> 01:04:02,194
And you, too, motherfucker!
Don't move!

586
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,830
I just wanted to thank you.
He was going to hurt me.

587
01:04:05,974 --> 01:04:08,272
Oh, shit. Hey!

588
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,670
- Shit.
- What is going on?

589
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:13,980
Nothing really.

590
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:29,830
Call "Nine-one-one". Tell 'em
to get their asses here right now!

591
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,366
Tick, tick.

592
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,476
I'll see if our ride
is here yet.

593
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,344
Miranda?

594
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:11,505
What is it?
What happened?

595
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:30,890
Stop!

596
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:56,287
Freeze!
I said don't fuckin' move!

597
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:01,155
Detective Garrett,
Police Department.

598
01:15:01,862 --> 01:15:02,886
Turn around.

599
01:15:03,064 --> 01:15:05,055
I said turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.

600
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:08,267
Come on.

601
01:15:08,336 --> 01:15:09,268
Here.

602
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:10,995
And now...

603
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,309
you and I, we're gonna have
a nice little chat.

604
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,435
Alright, alright. I know what you think,
but I didn't kill anybody.

605
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:18,376
- Where's your I. D?
- It's in my pocket.

606
01:15:18,613 --> 01:15:20,046
Well, it's not there now.

607
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:22,110
- What's your name?
- Danny.

608
01:15:22,984 --> 01:15:24,246
Danny what?

609
01:15:25,086 --> 01:15:26,280
Danny Sloan.

610
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,182
Well, well, well.

611
01:15:28,656 --> 01:15:29,816
How about that?

612
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:31,982
Mister Daniel Sloan.

613
01:15:33,294 --> 01:15:35,194
I've been looking for you, son.

614
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,232
Here.

615
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:45,972
You and I are gonna have
a very meaning full conversation here.

616
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:50,075
- I didn't do anything. I swear.
- That's funny...

617
01:15:50,144 --> 01:15:52,908
'cause there's a dead cop
back in your apartment.

618
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,716
- I didn't kill him.
- Then who did?

619
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:59,948
Well, that's okay, son.
Because you know what?

620
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,689
Because you're gonna tell me...

621
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,125
eventually.

622
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:07,861
Then what are you doing here?

623
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,291
What's Volpe to you?

624
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:12,726
Nothing, I swear.
I came here to...

625
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:14,795
You came here to what?

626
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:17,264
Finish it.

627
01:16:17,705 --> 01:16:20,003
I came here to find Laura.

628
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:23,273
Laura who?

629
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:27,312
Laura Baxter.

630
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:29,106
Wait.

631
01:16:29,984 --> 01:16:31,349
The "sleeping girl"?

632
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:34,747
Oh, I get it.

633
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:40,257
You're the one who kidnapped her.
You were at the hospital tonight.

634
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:41,757
What were you doing there?

635
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,862
Are you in this with Volpe?
You went there to break him out?

636
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:44,864
No!

637
01:16:45,066 --> 01:16:46,556
No. I went there to...

638
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:47,960
To what?

639
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,703
You went there to what?

640
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,830
I went there to kill him.

641
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:54,967
Kill him?

642
01:16:55,543 --> 01:16:56,635
Why?

643
01:16:57,044 --> 01:16:58,511
Because of Laura.

644
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,144
I love her.

645
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:06,075
Son...

646
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:09,522
you're not making a whole lot
of sense right now.

647
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:11,882
We have to help her.

648
01:17:12,326 --> 01:17:13,293
Volpe's got her.

649
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:16,820
I think he's gonna kill her.
I thought he was here, but he's not.

650
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:20,497
Please, we don't have much time!
Please.

651
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:26,336
You expecting a call?

652
01:17:27,675 --> 01:17:29,506
That's all right, I'll get it.

653
01:17:34,214 --> 01:17:36,375
Detective Garrett,
Police Department.

654
01:17:38,252 --> 01:17:40,482
Detective Garrett.
Hello.

655
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:46,089
<i>What a pleasant surprise.</i>
<i>I was expecting someone else.</i>

656
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,923
<i>Someone a bit younger.</i>

657
01:17:48,596 --> 01:17:49,620
Who is this?

658
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:52,633
Volpe?

659
01:17:54,434 --> 01:17:56,265
<i>Please call me Byron.</i>

660
01:17:56,538 --> 01:18:01,635
<i>You don't happen to have a young man</i>
<i>a very love-sick young man with you?</i>

661
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:05,238
<i>I see.</i>

662
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:06,776
<i>May I talk to him?</i>

663
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,244
You can talk to me.

664
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:11,647
<i>Very well.</i>
<i>Then listen to me.</i>

665
01:18:11,786 --> 01:18:15,483
<i>I know who you are.</i>
<i>I know your secrets.</i>

666
01:18:16,424 --> 01:18:18,619
<i>I know the dark places</i>
<i>you hide.</i>

667
01:18:19,929 --> 01:18:22,193
<i>I know what you do</i>
<i>when you are alone.</i>

668
01:18:23,464 --> 01:18:25,056
<i>I know your dreams.</i>

669
01:18:26,066 --> 01:18:27,124
Dreams?

670
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,268
Don't listen to him.

671
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:32,504
<i>It's time to share your dreams.</i>

672
01:18:52,192 --> 01:18:53,124
It's time.

673
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:26,425
Please.

674
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:32,893
Don't open the door, Billy!

675
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:42,974
Billy?

676
01:19:47,381 --> 01:19:48,313
Billy?

677
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,395
It's too bad about Mister Dornboss.

678
01:20:08,936 --> 01:20:10,062
I liked him.

679
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:12,363
We shared a lot of the same views.

680
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,203
I even liked his art.

681
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:17,244
Well, some of it anyway.

682
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:20,914
- Where's Laura?
- Sleeping. She needs her rest.

683
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:24,014
Besides,
the evening may prove stressful.

684
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,044
Detective?

685
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:28,989
I spoke with your mother.

686
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:33,621
My mother?
What did she say?

687
01:20:34,128 --> 01:20:37,586
She told me about the little girl
down the street. What was her name?

688
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:38,891
Corrine.

689
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:41,630
Corrine.

690
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:44,896
Corrine. Corinne's mother knows
what happened.

691
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,904
It was terrible
what you did to her.

692
01:20:48,408 --> 01:20:52,708
- It was an accident. I'm sorry.
- Oh, I know you were just playing.

693
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:56,281
I don't think I'm sorry
is quite good enough, do you?

694
01:20:57,152 --> 01:21:00,349
You need to make amends.
You want to, don't you?

695
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,279
Yes.

696
01:21:11,599 --> 01:21:12,531
Yes.

697
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,565
Where is she?

698
01:21:15,236 --> 01:21:16,760
We have a problem.

699
01:21:17,638 --> 01:21:19,469
We both want the same thing.

700
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:24,237
Why don't you just use
your psychic crap...

701
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:25,973
and kill me
and then she'll be all yours?

702
01:21:26,246 --> 01:21:28,771
But she won't, you see.
She'll think of you...

703
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:32,010
she'll dream of you
like some cheap, Gothic novel.

704
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:34,445
I can't have any martyrs.

705
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:38,249
I need to erase you,
so that no fragments...

706
01:21:38,459 --> 01:21:42,020
no twinges of something lost
remain in her heart.

707
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:46,728
I need to erase you
in this world and in hers.

708
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:48,393
Why? Why Laura?

709
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:53,937
Well, because she is the most perfect,
pure thing that ever walked this planet.

710
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:55,166
And I...

711
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:58,039
I'm the most corrupt.

712
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:00,741
How could it be otherwise?

713
01:22:31,978 --> 01:22:33,377
I'm not afraid of you!

714
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:50,390
You're not Danny.

715
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:00,564
<i>Now I'll show you the truth.</i>

716
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:13,640
Ah, well, if Mister Dornboss
was still with us...

717
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:18,270
I would recommend "The Modern Engineer",
Technical Press 1938.

718
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:21,710
"Issues of Reliability
in Modern Machines."

719
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,841
Sorry about the
conventional restraints.

720
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:27,410
I have to stay focused
and the night's young.

721
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:30,782
Ladies...

722
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:35,257
the piece that you've been
practicing so hard... play it.

723
01:25:55,282 --> 01:25:56,214
Lovely.

724
01:26:04,525 --> 01:26:05,651
Now to business.

725
01:26:06,994 --> 01:26:08,154
Don't do that.

726
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:11,465
I'd hate to have to do something
rather vengeful and overt.

727
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:15,033
You must embrace your fate...
love your life.

728
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:19,639
Brave of you to look me
in the eye.

729
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:21,937
Not many who've done
that have survived.

730
01:26:22,176 --> 01:26:26,636
Gaze into the abyss too enough
and the abyss will gaze into you.

731
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:31,182
Tick, tick, tick...

732
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:33,579
tick, tick.

733
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:34,720
Now...

734
01:26:35,424 --> 01:26:36,789
"Paradise Lost."

735
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:42,621
Our exquisite, lost angel.

736
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:59,871
The only things worthwhile in life
are danger and play.

737
01:27:00,614 --> 01:27:04,243
And what could be more dangerously
playful than a woman?

738
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:12,626
Laura...

739
01:27:14,094 --> 01:27:15,118
it's time to join me.

740
01:27:18,832 --> 01:27:19,821
Stand.

741
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,328
Stand.

742
01:27:23,804 --> 01:27:24,930
<i>Stand.</i>

743
01:27:26,073 --> 01:27:27,335
Stand.

744
01:28:10,484 --> 01:28:11,473
Danny.

745
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,857
It's all right.

746
01:28:22,062 --> 01:28:24,326
You're finally see clearly now.

747
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:28,065
You'll know the truth and
you'll know this dream is not for you.

748
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:30,601
I've always protected you.

749
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:56,925
Laura, open your eyes.

750
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:02,527
This is your "Clouded Man"...
look at him.

751
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:06,570
This is the thing that haunts you,
haunts our world.

752
01:29:06,807 --> 01:29:09,139
Don't you think that you should say
something to her?

753
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:11,337
Tell her what you really think of her.

754
01:29:11,445 --> 01:29:13,003
Tell her what's in your heart.

755
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,576
Share it so we'll all know.

756
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:22,855
You...

757
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,087
you are...

758
01:29:26,428 --> 01:29:28,760
nothing to me.
I...

759
01:29:34,334 --> 01:29:37,428
I took you because you were easy.

760
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:42,642
You were a stupid doll
that I...

761
01:29:43,677 --> 01:29:44,871
could dress up.

762
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,209
How do you think I could...

763
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,381
care for...

764
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:52,819
some...

765
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:56,690
some... somebody...
something like...

766
01:29:57,192 --> 01:29:58,250
you?

767
01:29:58,592 --> 01:30:00,059
I'm done with you.

768
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:03,690
I despise you.

769
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:05,725
The sight of you makes...

770
01:30:05,866 --> 01:30:07,060
me ill.

771
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:16,368
Oh, don't cry.

772
01:30:17,611 --> 01:30:19,374
I'll be here for you always.

773
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,943
"If he loved you with all the depth
of his soul for a thousand year...

774
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:26,984
she couldn't love you as much as
I do for a single day."

775
01:30:28,054 --> 01:30:30,955
Emily Bronte,
"Wuthering Heights".

776
01:30:37,631 --> 01:30:39,258
You will love me.

777
01:30:41,835 --> 01:30:43,029
I will make you.

778
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:48,870
Then you will only...

779
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:51,242
be loving...

780
01:30:51,812 --> 01:30:53,109
yourself!

781
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:26,735
Is that it?

782
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:29,948
I thought you had more
in you than that.

783
01:31:30,684 --> 01:31:32,208
I'll still have her.

784
01:31:32,419 --> 01:31:34,979
They'll patch me up
and lock me away someplace...

785
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:38,389
and I'll make sure "Sleeping Beauty"
is in the next room...

786
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:40,689
just like last time.

787
01:31:57,879 --> 01:31:59,039
No, you won't!

788
01:32:00,914 --> 01:32:02,404
No, you won't!

789
01:32:02,649 --> 01:32:03,707
No, you won't!

790
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:18,095
I'm staying...

791
01:32:18,364 --> 01:32:19,296
right here...

792
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,331
in this dream, forever...

793
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:24,064
and ever...

794
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:25,494
and ever.

795
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:53,358
That was good...

796
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:54,860
that was the one.

797
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:01,801
We're not done here.

798
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:04,167
Tick, tick,
tick, tick.

799
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:07,503
Tick, tick,
tick, tick.

800
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:10,076
No!

801
01:34:29,863 --> 01:34:30,830
No.

802
01:34:37,403 --> 01:34:38,370
No.

803
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:42,108
No.

804
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,068
Please.

805
01:34:45,078 --> 01:34:47,478
I love you.
Please don't leave me.

806
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:57,456
Please.

807
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,065
Come on...

808
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,962
we can dream.

809
01:35:14,576 --> 01:35:16,407
We can stay right here...

810
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:18,406
and let's dream.

811
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:26,786
Please.

812
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:49,741
Danny?

813
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:52,338
Danny?

814
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:55,510
Danny...

815
01:35:57,584 --> 01:35:59,017
the police are here.

816
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,815
We have to go.
Please wake up.

817
01:36:02,088 --> 01:36:05,216
<i>Attention, we're coming in.</i>
<i>You all must surrender.</i>

818
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,267
<i>Understand. Proceed.</i>

819
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,434
- <i>Dispatch calling.</i>
- <i>Proceed.</i>

820
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:29,040
<i>Fires were shot.</i>
<i>Check on the victims on the scene.</i>

821
01:36:36,823 --> 01:36:40,884
<i>Here's clean.</i>
<i>We found the victims, over.</i>

822
01:36:47,834 --> 01:36:49,199
It's a beautiful day.

823
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:11,249
And Volpe.
He's dead, right?

824
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:15,653
Oh, yes. He's quite dead.

825
01:37:16,562 --> 01:37:18,689
And what about the girl,
Laura Baxter?

826
01:37:24,204 --> 01:37:26,832
Maybe it would be easier
if I was to show you.

827
01:37:56,102 --> 01:37:57,262
She's here.

828
01:37:59,639 --> 01:38:00,663
In a morgue?

829
01:38:00,908 --> 01:38:03,502
Oh, she's alive.
We just moved her here...

830
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:07,307
keep her from prying eyes,
sustain her.

831
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:09,672
It's part of a new therapy.

832
01:38:09,916 --> 01:38:12,680
What about Danny Sloan?
Is he alive?

833
01:38:14,955 --> 01:38:16,388
They're both alive.

834
01:38:26,666 --> 01:38:28,896
I thought
I should keep them together.

835
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:30,669
What's with the liquid?

836
01:38:30,937 --> 01:38:33,804
Well, it prevents bed sores,
helps aerates the tissues...

837
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,405
Will they ever wake up?

838
01:38:35,642 --> 01:38:38,076
He's in a coma.
I don't think he can.

839
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:40,801
She hasn't awoken
since that night.

840
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:43,572
Maybe she doesn't want to.

841
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:49,812
Would it be okay
if I just stay here for a minute?

842
01:38:51,358 --> 01:38:52,450
Sure.

843
01:39:04,304 --> 01:39:06,101
I always keep a promise.

844
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:18,511
It's The Bossmen
on Lucky Eleven Records, 1966.

845
01:39:56,322 --> 01:39:57,653
It is a beautiful day.
