1
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,900
- When was the last time you were home?
- Two years, 264 days, and this morning.

2
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,203
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.

3
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,871
Whisper to them
I live only to hold them again.

4
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:21,940
For all else is dust and air. Whisper
to them I live only to hold them again.

5
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,519
For all else is dust and air.

6
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:12,842
Don't die.

7
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:21,056
You'll meet them again.

8
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:24,651
Not yet.

9
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:35,901
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

10
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,302
Don't die.

11
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,677
They'll feed you to the lions.

12
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:17,105
They are worth more than we are.

13
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:29,825
Better now?

14
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,620
Clean. You see?

15
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,453
Proximo.

16
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,528
My old friend.

17
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,755
Every day is a great day
when you are here.

18
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:14,496
Today is your most fortunate day.

19
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:19,771
Those giraffes you sold me.

20
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:21,867
- They won't mate.
- What?

21
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:25,675
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

22
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:29,581
You sold me queer giraffes.

23
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,518
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

24
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:39,855
- I do special price for you.
- On what?

25
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,863
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

26
00:07:58,982 --> 00:08:01,746
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

27
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,445
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

28
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:06,522
You need both, I think.

29
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:08,420
Get up.

30
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,800
- What's your trade?
- I was a hunter.

31
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:23,770
Oh, no. I bought him
from a salt mine in Carthage.

32
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,235
Sit down.

33
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:32,077
Mark of the legion.

34
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:34,775
- Deserter.
- Maybe so. But who cares?

35
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:37,478
- He's a Spaniard.
- I'll take six.

36
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:40,215
- For 1,000.
- 1,000?

37
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,553
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

38
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:45,889
- These slaves are rotten.
- It all adds to the flavor.

39
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:47,963
No. No, no, no.
Wait. Wait.

40
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:50,423
We can negotiate.

41
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:54,960
I'll give you 2,000.
And four for the beasts.

42
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:57,505
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

43
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:18,427
Come on. How long does it take
to get into my own house?

44
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:20,428
I am Proximo.

45
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,363
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

46
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:27,129
which will be last of your miserable
lives, than that bitch of a mother

47
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:29,898
that brought you screaming
into this world.

48
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:33,571
I did not pay good money
for you for your company.

49
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:38,008
I paid it so that I could
profit from your death.

50
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:42,547
And as your mother
was there at your beginning,

51
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:46,544
so I shall be there at your end.

52
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:50,586
And when you die,
and die you shall,

53
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:54,792
your transition shall be
to the sound of...

54
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:03,094
Gladiators, I salute you.

55
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,171
Red.

56
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:14,607
Yellow.

57
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:17,275
Yellow.

58
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,095
Good.

59
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,458
- Red.
- Red.

60
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:37,465
Spaniard.

61
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,031
That's enough for the moment.

62
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:14,700
His time will come.

63
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:19,081
Next.

64
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,457
Spaniard,

65
00:11:35,263 --> 00:11:38,755
why don't you fight?
We all have to fight.

66
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,835
I don't fight.

67
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:44,272
I shouldn't be here.
I'm a scribe, I write down words.

68
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,340
I can speak seven languages.

69
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:50,741
Good. Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

70
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:02,982
Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.

71
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:05,686
Freedom?

72
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:08,688
What do I have to do?

73
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:11,027
You go in the arena and you kill me.

74
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:12,760
And him.

75
00:12:13,468 --> 00:12:16,266
And the Numidian, and the deserter.

76
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,000
And a hundred more.

77
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:23,475
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

78
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,603
I can't do that.

79
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:35,451
But I can.

80
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,663
Is that the sign of your gods?

81
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,347
Will that not anger them?

82
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,537
The gods favor you.

83
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:25,799
Red is the gods' color.

84
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,969
You will need their help today.

85
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:18,083
Still leading with the German?

86
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,160
The crowd love a barbarian.

87
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,228
Besides that, he's making me rich.

88
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,729
Has that Numidian fought before?

89
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,730
No, first time.

90
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:30,269
And that one? Laborer? Soldier?

91
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,773
He's a Spaniard. He might as well be
a eunuch for what he brings to the ring.

92
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:40,236
500 Sesterti the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

93
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:44,078
And 1,000 that the Numidian
makes it through alone.

94
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,721
Are you asking me to bet against
my own man?

95
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:53,850
- It's unethical.
- What if I make it 2,000?

96
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,908
Some of you are thinking
you won't fight.

97
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,405
Some that you can't fight.

98
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,814
They all say that,
until they're out there.

99
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:24,249
- Listen.
- Kill. Kill. Kill.

100
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,264
Thrust this into another man's flesh,

101
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,071
and then they will applaud
and love you for that.

102
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,707
You may begin to love them for that.

103
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,984
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

104
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:02,961
Sadly, we cannot choose how, but
we can decide how we meet that end,

105
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,264
in order that we are remembered

106
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,667
as men.

107
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,935
On the left, draw your shields.

108
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,508
On the right, draw your swords.

109
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,945
Kill, kill, kill...

110
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,547
Pair them up, red with yellow.

111
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,156
Next.

112
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,613
Go away.

113
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,713
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.

114
00:20:56,723 --> 00:21:00,591
- But what has he conquered?
- Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

115
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,026
I think he could do very well.

116
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,063
For Rome or for you?

117
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,938
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

118
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:23,045
- Lucius.
- Mother.

119
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,752
- Hail, Caesar.
- Senators.

120
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,125
Rome greets her new emperor.

121
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,924
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

122
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:41,858
Thank you, Falco.
And for the loyal subjects.

123
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,665
- I trust they weren't too expensive.
- Caesar.

124
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:49,640
- Gracchus.
- Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

125
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,940
There are many matters
that require your attention.

126
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,179
To order. To order.

127
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:03,149
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols

128
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:06,521
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city.

129
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:10,392
Beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek quarter,

130
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:14,392
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

131
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,634
So, if Caesar...

132
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:21,099
Don't you see, Gracchus?

133
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:25,104
That's the very problem, isn't it?

134
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,577
My father spent all his time at study.

135
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:32,642
At books
and learning and philosophy.

136
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,981
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

137
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,155
And all the while,
the people were forgotten.

138
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,321
But the Senate is the people, sire.

139
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:48,026
Chosen from among the people,
to speak for the people.

140
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:51,934
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

141
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:57,373
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.
I think I understand my own people.

142
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:00,776
Then, perhaps Caesar
will be so good as to teach us.

143
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,616
Out of his own extensive experience.

144
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,955
I call it love.

145
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,882
I am their father.
The people are my children.

146
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,587
I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them.

147
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,893
Have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague, sire?

148
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:31,275
No, but if you interrupt me again,
I assure you that you shall.

149
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:33,972
Senator, my brother is very tired.

150
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:36,916
Leave your list with me.

151
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,678
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

152
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:44,655
My lady, as always, your lightest touch
commands obedience.

153
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,291
Who are they to lecture me?

154
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,892
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

155
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,695
What uses? All they do is talk.

156
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:05,577
It should be just you and me,
and Rome.

157
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,579
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

158
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,108
Rome has changed.

159
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:14,243
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

160
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:16,447
Of course, but leave the people their...

161
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,183
Illusions?

162
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,116
Traditions.

163
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:24,529
My father's war
against the barbarians...

164
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:27,559
He said it himself, it achieved nothing.

165
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:31,125
- But the people loved him.
- The people always love victories.

166
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:34,434
Why? They didn't see the battles.

167
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:39,910
- What do they care about Germania?
- They care about the greatness of Rome.

168
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,648
The greatness of Rome.

169
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,485
Well, what is that?

170
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,983
It's an idea. Greatness.

171
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:59,330
- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.

172
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,561
Do you not see, Lucilla?

173
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:08,170
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they'll love me for it.

174
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:13,139
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry, old men.

175
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:28,393
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

176
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,442
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure.

177
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,551
Games.

178
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:37,386
150 days of games.

179
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:40,432
- He's cleverer than I thought.
- Clever.

180
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,963
The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,

181
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,368
if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.

182
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,633
Fear and wonder,
a powerful combination.

183
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:53,805
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

184
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:57,076
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

185
00:26:57,183 --> 00:27:01,051
He'll conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

186
00:27:01,154 --> 00:27:04,954
He'll take away their freedom
and still they'll roar.

187
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:07,117
The beating heart of Rome

188
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,490
is not the marble of the Senate.

189
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:11,723
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

190
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:15,501
He'll bring them death,

191
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,818
and they will love him for it.

192
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:20,333
And they will love him for it.

193
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,667
Spaniard.

194
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,554
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

195
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,359
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

196
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,297
You want them to keep coming back,

197
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:53,201
so don't just hack them to pieces.
Remember, you are an entertainer.

198
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,868
Spaniard.

199
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,085
So entertain.

200
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,849
Are you not entertained?

201
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:16,148
Are you not entertained?

202
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,221
Is this not why you are here?

203
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,022
Spaniard.

204
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,242
What do you want?

205
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,249
Girl?

206
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,688
Boy?

207
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:56,557
- You sent for me?
- Yes, I did.

208
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,855
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

209
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,765
- You could be magnificent.
- I'm required to kill, so I kill.

210
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,962
That is enough.

211
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:08,905
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

212
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:16,347
The young emperor
has arranged a series of spectacles

213
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:20,317
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

214
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,051
I find that amusing,

215
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,350
since it was Marcus Aurelius,

216
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:28,325
the wise, the all-knowing
Marcus Aurelius,

217
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,395
that closed us down.

218
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:36,727
So, finally, after five years
of scratching a living

219
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,669
in flea-infested villages,

220
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:42,400
we're finally going back
to where we belong.

221
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,310
The Colosseum.

222
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,776
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

223
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,246
50,000 Romans

224
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,978
watching every movement of your sword.

225
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,819
Willing you to make that killer blow.

226
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,422
The silence before you strike,

227
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,499
and the noise afterwards,

228
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,036
it rises... rises up like...

229
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:14,535
like a storm.

230
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:17,803
As if you were
the thunder god himself.

231
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,606
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

232
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,411
You won your freedom?

233
00:31:29,522 --> 00:31:31,683
A long time ago, the Emperor...

234
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:38,528
presented me with a rudius.
It's just a wooden sword.

235
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,325
A symbol of your freedom.

236
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:47,466
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

237
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:52,399
- You knew Marcus Aurelius?
- I did not say I knew him.

238
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,241
I said he touched me
on the shoulder once.

239
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,508
You asked me what I want.

240
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,415
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor.

241
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,614
As you did.

242
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,716
Then listen to me.
Learn from me.

243
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,758
I wasn't the best
because I killed quickly.

244
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,590
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

245
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:21,603
Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom.

246
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,512
I will win the crowd.

247
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,878
I will give them something
they have never seen before.

248
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,852
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together

249
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,688
and have bloody adventures.

250
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,920
And the great whore will suckle us
until we are fat and happy

251
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,690
and can suckle no more.
And then,

252
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,923
when enough men have died,

253
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,397
perhaps you will have your freedom.

254
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,137
Here. Use this.

255
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,369
It's somewhere out there.

256
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,940
My country, my home.

257
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,242
My wife is preparing food.

258
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:36,447
My daughters carry water from the river.

259
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,008
Will I ever see them again?

260
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,983
I think no.

261
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,723
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

262
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,553
I think so.

263
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,595
But then, I will die soon.

264
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,626
They will not die for many years.

265
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:59,693
- I'll have to wait.
- But you would wait.

266
00:34:00,306 --> 00:34:02,274
Of course.

267
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:09,708
You see,
my wife and my son,

268
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:12,841
are already waiting for me.

269
00:34:12,952 --> 00:34:15,386
You'll meet them again.

270
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,984
But not yet.

271
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:23,357
Not yet.

272
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,254
- Unless...
- Not yet.

273
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,262
Not yet.

274
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,073
I see him.

275
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,884
- Where?
- There he is.

276
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,930
Out.

277
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:39,194
Move. Out.

278
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,533
Are there any others?

279
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:53,675
Good to see you again, old friend.

280
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,752
Bring me fortune.

281
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,528
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

282
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:12,564
I didn't know men
could build such things.

283
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,144
Win the crowd.

284
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:27,275
Get Inside. Move. Inside.

285
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,536
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

286
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,239
Come, Brother. It's late.

287
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,315
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

288
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,913
That is what Gracchus and his friends
don't understand.

289
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,824
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

290
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,495
Drink this tonic.

291
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:03,114
I think the time is almost right.

292
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:05,809
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate

293
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:08,443
at the celebration to honor our father.

294
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:10,522
You think I should?

295
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:13,248
Are the people ready?

296
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,458
I think you need your rest now.

297
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:27,062
- Will you stay with me?
- Still afraid of the dark, Brother?

298
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,273
Still?

299
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,376
Always.

300
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,488
- Stay with me tonight?
- You know I won't.

301
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,893
Then kiss me.

302
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,428
Sleep, Brother.

303
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:57,118
Having servants who are deaf and mute
at least ensures I live a little longer.

304
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,692
They're arresting scholars now.

305
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,824
Anyone who dares speak out.

306
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:06,165
Even satirists and chroniclers.

307
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,828
And mathematicians.

308
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,634
And all to feed the arena.

309
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,372
The Senate did not approve martial law.

310
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,209
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians'.

311
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,818
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

312
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,945
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

313
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,387
The Senate is full of his spies.

314
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,590
Led by that whoremaster, Falco.

315
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:36,822
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myself with.

316
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,767
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed,

317
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,634
planning the festival
to honor your father.

318
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,732
He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.

319
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,079
So just what is he planning?

320
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,374
And what pays for it?

321
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:55,748
These daily games are costing a fortune,
yet we have no new taxes.

322
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,979
The future.

323
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,147
The future pays for it.

324
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:05,560
He's started selling the grain reserves.

325
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,063
This can't be true.

326
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,497
He is selling Rome's reserves of grain.

327
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,397
The people will be starving
in two years.

328
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,568
I hope they enjoy the games.

329
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,268
Soon enough,
they will be dead because of them.

330
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,710
- Rome must know this.
- And how?

331
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,543
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

332
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,845
And who will tell them
before it's too late?

333
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,647
You, Gracchus?

334
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,623
You, Gaius?

335
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,318
Will you make a speech on the floor
of the Senate denouncing my brother?

336
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,691
And then see your family
in the Colosseum?

337
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,524
Who'd dare?

338
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,239
I have been living in a prison of fear
every day

339
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,642
because my son is heir to the throne.

340
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,687
He must die.
