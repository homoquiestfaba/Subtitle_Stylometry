1
00:02:08,206 --> 00:02:10,706
(low talking)

2
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:05,047
- What's up?

3
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:52,153
- Pull down your pants.

4
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:46,289
- Wait, wait.

5
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,588
(moaning)

6
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:03,845
(car honk)

7
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:04,678
- Oops.

8
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:07,560
- Don't forget your glasses, Sam.

9
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,143
- Oh, I've got 'em.

10
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,043
- Hello, anybody home?

11
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,989
- Can I have some salt?

12
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:33,516
- I'm sorry Dad, do you want it?

13
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:34,709
- Yeah, after you.

14
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,387
- One second.

15
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:37,943
Thank you.

16
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:40,265
- Which of these dressings do I use?

17
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:41,855
- Well I think you have a choice, Mom.

18
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:43,608
- Well this one here's
vinaigrette with olive oil,

19
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:44,665
it's really good.

20
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,871
- I'll put this one on the side.

21
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:48,185
Which one are you having, Sam?

22
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:49,369
- I don't know.

23
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,797
- Well here Sam, have at it.

24
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,341
- Good idea.

25
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,174
- Ken.

26
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:54,007
- Hm?

27
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,985
- Now listen, before you say anything.

28
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:58,007
I know this deal.

29
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,923
There's this corner downtown.

30
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:01,397
One corner there's laundry,

31
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,998
the other corner Stop 'N Go,
both going out of business.

32
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:05,716
Now there's this third place.

33
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:07,098
We could pick it up for a song.

34
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:09,095
- Why would you wanna get
involved in something like that?

35
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:10,232
- Well for the investment, Mom.

36
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:11,463
- So it's on some hands on kind of thing.

37
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:12,438
- No, not for us.

38
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:13,271
- I'm not interested in anything.

39
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:16,606
- No, we go down there.
- Forget it, Gary.

40
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,476
- Well it s an opportunity
is what I'm saying.

41
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:19,309
- [Mom] Forget it.

42
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,976
- [Sam] Give him a break, Susan.

43
00:08:24,594 --> 00:08:25,697
- Well, have you the
heard the latest thing

44
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:27,404
about our esteemed Congressman?

45
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:28,237
- Mom!

46
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,825
- Why should I shush?

47
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:35,728
I can't talk about a black
man because Bernice is here?

48
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:38,259
- [Bernice] Just pretend
that I'm not here.

49
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:41,034
- Really Gary, if anybody's
being a racist, you are.

50
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:43,019
He's suing the airlines because he says

51
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,656
he choked on mashed potatoes

52
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:47,384
on his flight back from
Washington. (laughing)

53
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:50,261
- I thought he was the
kind to fly private.

54
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:52,792
- Says they cut his throat.

55
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,638
the airlines offered him, oh I don't know,

56
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:56,634
free flights for the rest of his life.

57
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,550
But he's holding out for the big bucks.

58
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,479
- Is that a light beer, Ken?

59
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,744
I thought you gave up on that stuff.

60
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:02,753
- No, no, I've lost a few pounds.

61
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:03,586
- [Mom] Lincoln.

62
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,419
- Yes ma'am.

63
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,097
- [Mom] Would you go get
my pills out of my purse?

64
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,362
It's in your father's room.

65
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,150
In the beige Capezio.

66
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,832
- I know which one it is.

67
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:13,306
- May I be excused?

68
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:14,525
- No you need to wait for desert.

69
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,358
- I don't want desert.

70
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:03,586
(heavy breathing)

71
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:34,305
(pop punk music)

72
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:39,670
- Man I can't believe
I'm eating this shit.

73
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,516
You think there's something wrong with me?

74
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,838
- You eat too much.

75
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:47,779
- Fuck it dude, everyone
in my family eats too much.

76
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,126
What can I do about it?

77
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,169
- You could eat less.

78
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:52,353
- Here, you want one?

79
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:53,186
- No.

80
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,019
- Come on, eat it.

81
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:54,852
- Stop!

82
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:55,685
- You want it.

83
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:56,518
- You're gonna make me wreck.

84
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:58,089
- Monica.

85
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,610
- What kind is it?

86
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,110
- Well, chocolate,

87
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,079
jelly and honey-glazed.

88
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,283
- Okay, I want a honey-glazed.

89
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:13,307
Thank you.

90
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:24,847
(car honking)

91
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:25,813
- What are you doing?

92
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:26,916
- I'm honking.

93
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,238
- I'll get out of the car, dickweed.

94
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:33,071
Think my mother raised
criminals or something?

95
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:39,896
- Is everything okay?

96
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:40,729
- Yeah.

97
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,121
- You mad at me?

98
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,621
- No, should I be?

99
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,028
- No, I certainly don't want you to be.

100
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:54,464
- Good.

101
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:04,736
- Hey Danny, can you run us by Taco Bell?

102
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:06,291
We haven't had nothing to eat yet.

103
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,475
- I don't know, what's in it for me?

104
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:08,613
- Bean burrito?

105
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:09,446
- You got a deal.

106
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:13,710
- Who took the money
off the kitchen table?

107
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,543
- I don't know.

108
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:15,881
- Jackie!

109
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:17,808
- I didn't touch your
purse Mom, I promise.

110
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:18,702
- So who did?

111
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:19,724
- I don't know.

112
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,187
- Hey look, you're the one with no job,

113
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:22,092
and you're the one with no money.

114
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:23,927
- I've got money, Tina.

115
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:26,177
- Oh yeah, I'm sure you do!

116
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:30,486
- Just ask me next time, okay?

117
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:31,486
- All right.

118
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:35,177
But you're really pissing me off, Mom.

119
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:36,884
- Nice to see you, Danny!

120
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:38,068
- See you, Mrs. Clifton.

121
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:39,333
- Come see me again some time.

122
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,645
- All right.

123
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:41,478
- Mom!

124
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,593
I wanna talk about this
when I get home, all right?

125
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:45,939
Because I'm not the person
that took the 20 dollars

126
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:46,792
out of your wallet.

127
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:47,625
- Then how'd you know

128
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,171
how much money it was, bitch!
- Fuck you, Tina!

129
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,783
- Come on, let's go, together.

130
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:54,049
- I'm not riding with her.

131
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:54,882
- Can you drive?

132
00:12:54,882 --> 00:12:55,883
- Yes, I can drive.

133
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:56,905
- Yeah, she's a real big girl.

134
00:12:56,905 --> 00:12:58,286
She just got her learner's permits.

135
00:12:58,286 --> 00:12:59,119
- Whatever, Tina.

136
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,121
- What am I supposed to do?

137
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,502
- Just come with me, please.

138
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:03,252
- All right you guys.

139
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:05,380
What's your fucking problem?

140
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,564
- What's your fucking problem?

141
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:07,397
- I don't know, you don't
have to fucking bitch

142
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:08,730
at every person.

143
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,778
Come on, let's just try to have some fun.

144
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:24,373
♫ Slip away, yeah yeah

145
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:29,438
♫ Going too fast around that turn

146
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,923
♫ We'll pull if off baby
and we're gonna burn

147
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:34,651
♫ Oh yeah

148
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,901
♫ Oh yeah

149
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,000
(people talking)

150
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,189
- I need two forms.

151
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:03,362
- I don't have anything else,

152
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:05,033
and this has always been fine before.

153
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,855
- Well I need two valid
Ids, one with a picture.

154
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:09,852
Everybody's gotta have it.

155
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:11,314
- I can't get in.

156
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:12,147
- Why not?

157
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:15,482
- I don't fucking know,
he's just not letting me in.

158
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:16,783
So stupid.

159
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:20,283
- It doesn't matter, don't worry about it.

160
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,670
- Fucking asshole!

161
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,191
- Take the seeds out, Tina.

162
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:44,350
- Man, this stuff will get you so stoned,

163
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,267
I've been stoned all...

164
00:14:58,085 --> 00:15:00,012
- What are y'all doing here?

165
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,532
- What does it look like we're doing?

166
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:04,610
- Can I have some?

167
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,084
- No!

168
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:07,584
- How old are you?

169
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,797
- Get your own, man!

170
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:18,195
- Hey, Tina!

171
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:21,398
Hey!

172
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:22,231
- What?

173
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,763
What?

174
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:27,435
- Hey I don't think this phone is working.

175
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:29,188
- Did you leave the number?

176
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:30,198
- Yeah I left the number.

177
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,754
What if he calls back
and it's not working?

178
00:15:31,754 --> 00:15:33,004
- Use that one!

179
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:34,935
- What other one?

180
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,743
- The other phone, dumbass!

181
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:39,083
The one over on Jefferson.

182
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:39,916
- Here's a quarter.

183
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:40,749
- You think I should?

184
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:43,828
- Yeah, if you wanna go to Ted's house.

185
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:44,661
Hurry up!

186
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:50,307
- Is there a party?

187
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:53,339
- It's what we're trying to find out.

188
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,656
- Can't you fucking pop a
wheelie or something? (laughs)

189
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:57,935
- Is it a rave?

190
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:59,435
- Are you a raver?

191
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,878
What's your name?

192
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:04,711
- Michael.

193
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:06,796
- I'm Lincoln.

194
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:12,125
- Here you go Michael.

195
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:16,369
- Tina, what are you doing?

196
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:17,867
- He asked, okay.
- I don't care,

197
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:18,700
that's fucked up.

198
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,261
- Oh yeah, like you
weren't smoking pot at 12.

199
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,221
- Hey man, let's go.

200
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:24,337
- What'd he say?

201
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:26,113
- Oh man, he said we could
come over and hang out

202
00:16:26,113 --> 00:16:27,461
and see what's going on but he sounds like

203
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:28,823
he's been up for like four days

204
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:30,492
and you know, we should get going now.

205
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,428
- Alright, let's go.

206
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:35,139
- Oh man, that is the worst
pot you've ever made me smoke

207
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:36,722
in my fuckin' life.

208
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:40,786
Hey what are you doing with our car?

209
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:41,734
Give me those keys, man.

210
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,151
Hey give me those keys.

211
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,861
- Leave him alone, Danny.

212
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:47,694
- God.

213
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:55,593
- Hey let's get out of here.

214
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:57,155
Where the fuck is (mumbling)?

215
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:58,072
- Let's go.

216
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:09,036
(low talking)

217
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,851
(upbeat music)

218
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:43,909
- What you want one?

219
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,992
- Yeah, I change my mind.

220
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:51,632
(talking drowned out by music)

221
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,615
- It didn't matter if
they were black or white,

222
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:18,683
if they backed into the car,

223
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:19,516
you see what I'm saying?

224
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,565
Like, it was gonna happen.

225
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:22,341
I mean it is, they did shot (mumbling)

226
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,050
but it'd be different if
they were walking down

227
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,532
the street and they just jumped on him.

228
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:26,387
Do you see what I'm saying?

229
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:28,803
That they're, I don't know, I don't think

230
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:30,766
it's blown that far out of proportion but.

231
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,114
- It's blown out of proportion.

232
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:32,947
- Yeah.

233
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,722
I don't know.

234
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:37,925
- But they've been saying that

235
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,402
a large group of black
people at our school

236
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:40,630
are pissed off.

237
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,541
- There was like, on the
news, did you see the news?

238
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,226
There's like thousands
on them on the campus.

239
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,809
(upbeat music)

240
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:07,127
- That was good.

241
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:11,242
(soul music)

242
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:22,688
(talking drowned out by music)

243
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:46,981
(laughing)

244
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,707
- No, it's obviously only for a playing.

245
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,630
It's all thick or thin,
it's got little fingers

246
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,963
on it and stuff.

247
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,036
And then it's all thin,
like only the very tip

248
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:03,970
of it glows.

249
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,693
- Who would want a fluorescent dildo?

250
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:07,295
(laughing)

251
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,643
We read the directions, followed them,

252
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:09,671
and it didn't glow.

253
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:13,838
- You have a very
illuminating dick. (laughs)

254
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,850
What's that, Mr. Happy?

255
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:20,952
- Watch out.

256
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:24,759
Hi.

257
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,592
- Hey.

258
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:29,478
- I didn't know where you were.

259
00:20:31,328 --> 00:20:32,245
- Bullshit.

260
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:36,855
- I thought you were with Jackie and Tina.

261
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:39,352
- Sometimes you're so full of shit.

262
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:40,185
- I know.

263
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:43,895
- So why do you do it?

264
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:47,356
- I don't know, cause it's fun.

265
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,291
Come on, let's go.

266
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,311
- Hey, hey could please
get your country ass

267
00:20:58,311 --> 00:20:59,728
off of my plants.

268
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:02,610
You gotta watch what you're doing there,

269
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,321
you're crushing them,
you're smashing them.

270
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,403
- You think I'm fat.

271
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:11,582
- Yes man, I think you are a big, fat pig.

272
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:13,665
- Don't get so defensive.

273
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,024
Good night.

274
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,898
Tina?

275
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:20,475
- Don't bring me into this dude.

276
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:21,703
- Adios.

277
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:22,971
- Later, dude.

278
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,039
- Man what do I gotta do?

279
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,188
Where you guys gonna go?

280
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:26,438
- I don't know.

281
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:28,691
- Where you guys going?

282
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:29,620
You don't wanna go out?

283
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,595
- Yeah, I don't.

284
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:32,197
- She want me?

285
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:33,439
- Not like that.

286
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,507
- How do you want me?

287
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,757
- Just come get in the car.

288
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,638
- Are you just gonna leave me here?

289
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:45,455
- You can stay here if
you want to, I don't mind.

290
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:47,872
I got plenty of clean towels.

291
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:57,610
- Don't give me that look.

292
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,319
- I'm not giving you a look.

293
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,081
- Yes you were.

294
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:02,831
- I wasn't trying to.

295
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:07,464
- What are you doing?

296
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,561
- What are you doing?

297
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:24,266
- Tell me you love me.

298
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:25,320
- You're hurting me.

299
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,312
- I'm not hurting you, tell
me you can't live without me.

300
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,898
- No stop it, Lincoln.

301
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:32,427
What's wrong with you?

302
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:34,760
- Sorry, I was just playing.

303
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:39,189
I didn't mean it.

304
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:41,272
- Then what did you mean?

305
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:44,328
- I don't know.

306
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,486
I was just fooling around.

307
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,619
- I want you to go.

308
00:22:56,354 --> 00:22:57,771
- What can I say?

309
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,889
- You can't say anything.

310
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:04,898
I'm gonna go to sleep, okay?

311
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:06,481
- Don't be a bitch.

312
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:53,128
- How you doing guy?

313
00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:54,144
- Alright.

314
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:56,061
- You have fun tonight?

315
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:59,847
- Nice night, huh?

316
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:00,680
- Yeah.

317
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,057
- Been here long?

318
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:07,892
- Yeah, too long.

319
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:14,981
- What you got planned for the night?

320
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:15,814
- Nothing.

321
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:25,416
- Would you like to come back to my hotel?

322
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:30,871
- Alright.

323
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,073
- Okay, tell you what?

324
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:39,540
Why don't you hop down, get in your car,

325
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,180
I'll wait for you and you can follow me.

326
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,013
- Okay.

327
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,236
- Stand up.

328
00:27:53,484 --> 00:27:55,067
- What do you mean?

329
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,201
- I just wanna look at you.

330
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:13,731
Go over there.

331
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,821
Stand over there next to the mirror.

332
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:35,266
Hold your arms up like this.

333
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,690
Make some muscles.

334
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,668
- I don't have any muscles.

335
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:42,751
- Yes you do.

336
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,596
Look at that.

337
00:28:45,596 --> 00:28:46,596
Keep 'em up.

338
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,360
Good.

339
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,316
Turn around.

340
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,450
All the way.

341
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,535
Hey, how you doing?

342
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,252
- Alright.

343
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,431
- Do you like that?

344
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:31,696
You like being daddy's boy?

345
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,024
- Yeah, I guess.

346
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,143
- You guess?

347
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:44,657
- Yeah.

348
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,490
- But you're not sure?

349
00:29:48,507 --> 00:29:50,840
What else do you like to do?

350
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,534
You like that?

351
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,617
- What do you like to do?

352
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:01,574
- I want you to hit me.

353
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:06,946
Hit me.

354
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:10,831
You like that boy?

355
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,614
I thought you liked being daddy's boy.

356
00:30:25,614 --> 00:30:26,447
- No.

357
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:59,431
- What are you doing?

358
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:02,765
- Putting my clothes on.

359
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,609
- So that's it?

360
00:31:09,194 --> 00:31:10,027
It's over?

361
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:12,355
You're just gonna leave?

362
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:13,188
- Yeah.

363
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:21,512
- Do you just want a
blow job or something?

364
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,345
- No.

365
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,585
- I'm sorry.

366
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:30,602
I'm sorry.

367
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:34,297
You don't have to go.

368
00:31:39,712 --> 00:31:42,279
Look, I'll tell you what,

369
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:45,056
I'll be back in Memphis
in about two weeks.

370
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:48,026
This is the room I always stay in.

371
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,727
Why don't I give you the number

372
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,524
and if you want, you can call me,

373
00:31:53,524 --> 00:31:56,340
we can get together and do something.

374
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,173
- Sure.

375
00:31:58,486 --> 00:32:00,420
- I mean, we can get together
and do whatever you want.

376
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,512
We don't have to--

377
00:32:01,512 --> 00:32:03,345
- I think I should go.

378
00:32:07,796 --> 00:32:09,175
Thanks.

379
00:32:09,175 --> 00:32:10,508
- I'd like that.

380
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:18,455
You liked it for awhile.

381
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:25,363
Take care of yourself, you're a nice kid.

382
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:27,125
- Yeah, you too.

383
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:31,292
- Hey, are you gonna give
me a kiss before you go?

384
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:37,335
It won't hurt.

385
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:50,391
There.

386
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:52,411
That's better.

387
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:54,204
Thanks.

388
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:56,062
- Thanks.

389
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:33,608
(moaning)

390
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:11,627
- Hey boy, how you doing?

391
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:13,844
- Fine.

392
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:17,360
- You don't remember me, do you?

393
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,505
- I remember you.

394
00:34:19,505 --> 00:34:22,053
- Why you don't stop and talk to me?

395
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:24,970
- I'm just gonna watch some movies.

396
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:30,046
- Where you go?

397
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,371
You're so cute.

398
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:40,288
- I'm cute?

399
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,689
- I like those, very cool.

400
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:47,877
- These things?

401
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,854
Dimples.

402
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,463
- Dimble.

403
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,630
- No, dimples.

404
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:53,739
- Dimple.

405
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,572
- Yeah.

406
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:58,969
- You sexy.

407
00:34:58,969 --> 00:34:59,802
- Sexy?

408
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:02,679
- Yeah, you know that.

409
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:06,878
Do you gay?

410
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:09,390
- Why do you care?

411
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,789
- For me?

412
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:11,976
I don't care.

413
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,726
I like straight guys.

414
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:17,264
You have girlfriend?

415
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:19,371
- I don't know.

416
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:20,386
Are you gay?

417
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:21,469
- Yeah, I am.

418
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:30,693
- So you like these places?

419
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:31,996
Come here a lot?

420
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,413
- Yeah, sometime.

421
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:35,999
Three time a week.

422
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,245
- Three times a week?

423
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:38,078
- Yeah.

424
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:40,750
How about you?

425
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,250
- It don't matter.

426
00:35:52,513 --> 00:35:55,099
- I know you be here tonight.

427
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,225
- How do you know that?

428
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:58,701
- You know why I come here?

429
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:00,003
I wait for you.

430
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,379
I know you come here tonight.

431
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:03,643
- How do you know that?

432
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:05,750
- I come here and wait for you.

433
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,218
I really like you but I
wanna take time with you.

434
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:10,405
- Whatever.

435
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:11,919
- You wanna party tonight?

436
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,896
- With you?

437
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:14,639
- Who you think?

438
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,472
- What?

439
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:17,237
- Who you think?

440
00:36:17,237 --> 00:36:20,149
Why you not wanna look at me, huh?

441
00:36:20,149 --> 00:36:24,068
I've been here long time. (mumbling)

442
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:26,980
For you, huh, I don't think so.

443
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,417
Let's go to your house.

444
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,317
- I don't think so.

445
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:30,333
- Why not?

446
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,386
- 'Cause I said so.

447
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:35,697
- We talk, we go somewhere,
this plan is good.

448
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:37,019
- Where do you wanna go?

449
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:38,245
- I don't care.

450
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:40,412
I can't stay here no more.

451
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:45,237
You're so wet.

452
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,070
You hot?

453
00:36:48,283 --> 00:36:50,563
- My father's got a boat.

454
00:36:50,563 --> 00:36:52,555
Do you like water?

455
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:53,388
- Sure.

456
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:56,367
- We could go there.

457
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:57,593
- We buy some beer.

458
00:36:57,593 --> 00:36:59,777
- And what after that, huh?

459
00:36:59,777 --> 00:37:00,754
- I don't know.

460
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,087
It don't matter.

461
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,958
- We could do that.

462
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:08,891
- You so cute.

463
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:17,229
Why you go so fast, huh? (mumbling)

464
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:25,098
This is nice boat.

465
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:27,152
What up here?

466
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:29,689
- Just a deck.

467
00:38:31,568 --> 00:38:35,068
- This is really nice, really really nice.

468
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,652
You want another one?

469
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:40,485
- Sure.

470
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:47,907
- Boy, I like you boy, you know that?

471
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,511
How I miss you boy.

472
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:57,545
- What do you mean?

473
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,958
- How we missed again.

474
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,004
I don't think that's happened,
when I miss you last time.

475
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:05,837
I wanted to, but I don't think so.

476
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:09,594
- Why didn't you talk to me after then?

477
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:11,625
- I don't know.

478
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:13,062
I don't know.

479
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:14,422
It's always like that.

480
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:16,625
It's always like that after.

481
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,441
Like why I not want to
have sex with people.

482
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:23,081
I have sex with guy
and they don't want me.

483
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:26,414
But if I talk with guy first,
they like me, they love me.

484
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:29,331
That's what it's like all the time.

485
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,648
You want to love me?

486
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:36,970
- Huh?

487
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,326
- You want to love me?

488
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:40,590
- Do I wanna love you?

489
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,423
- Uh huh.

490
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:47,200
Did you know I love?

491
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,675
- Don't say that shit to me.

492
00:39:48,675 --> 00:39:49,592
- But I do.

493
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:52,449
- You don't love me.

494
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:53,885
You don't even know me.

495
00:39:53,885 --> 00:39:54,718
- But I do.

496
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:56,165
I do love you.

497
00:39:56,165 --> 00:39:58,272
I tell you the first time I saw you.

498
00:39:58,272 --> 00:40:01,939
And I go home and think
about you all night.

499
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,062
Okay, forget it.

500
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:06,895
Forget it.

501
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,433
- Why are you in such a hurry?

502
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:10,901
- Forget it, anything.

503
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:12,376
Let's go somewhere.

504
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,043
We take this boat out somewhere.

505
00:40:15,977 --> 00:40:17,318
- What do you mean?

506
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:19,272
- On the boat, we go out somewhere,

507
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:21,533
we talk, drink some more
beers, say something,

508
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:22,616
we come home.

509
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:26,111
- We can't do that.

510
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:27,050
- Why not?

511
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,023
- I just don't think I can.

512
00:40:29,023 --> 00:40:30,805
- You don't think so?

513
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:32,305
But maybe you can.

514
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,498
No reason, right?

515
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:37,498
So lets go, we have fun.

516
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:41,111
- Okay.

517
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:42,587
- Really?

518
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:44,254
Boy, I like you boy.

519
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:50,058
- I should go home and get some things.

520
00:40:50,058 --> 00:40:51,308
- No, let's go.

521
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:53,947
Now is better.

522
00:40:53,947 --> 00:40:55,556
If you go home, you change you mind.

523
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:56,782
Now is better.

524
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:59,322
- Maybe that'd be a good idea.

525
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:00,644
- Bad idea.

526
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:02,502
That'd be bad.

527
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,498
- You think so?

528
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:04,498
- I know so.

529
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,085
You good flirt.

530
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:12,387
- I'm a good flirt?

531
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,537
- I like it.

532
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,370
Me too.

533
00:41:36,475 --> 00:41:39,142
(radio talking)

534
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:32,257
Hey boy, where you been?

535
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:37,440
- I was waiting for you to get up.

536
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,940
- What time is it?

537
00:43:41,023 --> 00:43:42,843
- I don't know.

538
00:43:42,843 --> 00:43:44,586
Late, I think.

539
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:46,586
I've been up for awhile.

540
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:50,467
- You want me to get up, you missed me?

541
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:52,919
You could have woke me up, boy.

542
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:53,858
I don't mind.

543
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:55,358
Whatever you want.

544
00:43:57,862 --> 00:44:00,352
- You looked really tired.

545
00:44:00,352 --> 00:44:03,322
- I don't know, I wake a dream.

546
00:44:03,322 --> 00:44:06,961
A dream I rode to (mumbles)
and I win one million

547
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:09,069
and take you to Vietnam with me.

548
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:12,115
Then the lady in the
neighborhood, she want to have sex

549
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:12,948
with me.

550
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,963
This woman wanted me to have sex with her.

551
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:20,681
That wake me up.

552
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:30,824
She asked me to come inside her house

553
00:44:30,824 --> 00:44:33,735
and she asked me to take
off all her clothes.

554
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:36,235
But before I do it, I wake up.

555
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,433
You come in the water,
make you feel better.

556
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:54,310
Feels very good.

557
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,613
- It was cold this morning.

558
00:44:55,613 --> 00:44:57,780
- It's very warm, perfect.

559
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:14,233
If I have a lot of
money, I buy house here,

560
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:17,509
and I go Vietnam and I
buy house for my mom.

561
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:18,342
(mumbling)

562
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:19,984
- You dream a lot.

563
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:21,567
- But I never will.

564
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,444
- I'm worried about my dad.

565
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:27,015
- No, don't.

566
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,563
Don't think about us or talk about us.

567
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:31,563
I do everything for you.

568
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,877
Can you give me hug?

569
00:45:38,797 --> 00:45:40,547
Come on, give me hug.

570
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:53,095
- You happy now?

571
00:45:53,095 --> 00:45:54,609
- Okay.

572
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:57,482
- Ow, why did you bite me?

573
00:45:57,482 --> 00:45:59,628
- If I hurt you, you remember.

574
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:01,869
I want you to remember.

575
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:03,786
Look at it, this is me.

576
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:16,488
- Do you know how old I am?

577
00:46:16,488 --> 00:46:17,561
- How old are you?

578
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:18,729
- Take a guess.

579
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:21,775
- I don't care to know about that.

580
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:22,733
- How old are you?

581
00:46:22,733 --> 00:46:24,400
- What do you think?

582
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,530
- I don't know.

583
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,363
23, two?

584
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,925
- Oh, I think I'm older
than you maybe 10 year.

585
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:34,956
- Thanks grandpa.

586
00:46:34,956 --> 00:46:35,873
- Oh sorry.

587
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,910
Don't get mad to me boy.

588
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:47,369
- How long have you been in America?

589
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,452
- Three year.

590
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,890
- Do you miss Vietnam?

591
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,059
- Sometime.

592
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,266
Not much.

593
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:55,434
I have wife there.

594
00:46:55,434 --> 00:46:56,267
- A wife?

595
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:58,576
- The last time when I go home,

596
00:46:58,576 --> 00:46:59,802
we get married.

597
00:46:59,802 --> 00:47:01,871
She love me very much.

598
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:03,519
I don't really want to marry her

599
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,775
but she tell me she die
if I don't marry her.

600
00:47:06,775 --> 00:47:08,250
And my mother want me to.

601
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,936
She know she a good woman.

602
00:47:09,936 --> 00:47:11,028
So I do.

603
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,350
- What happened to your dad?

604
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,691
- My dad's not married to her.

605
00:47:13,691 --> 00:47:17,139
He black guy, he live
with my mom for three year

606
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:18,365
and then he left.

607
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:19,630
I never see him.

608
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,270
First, make me very
angry, I want to kill him.

609
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,687
But now, he gone, I don't want to bother.

610
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:29,827
My family strange.

611
00:47:30,894 --> 00:47:32,178
They don't like me.

612
00:47:32,178 --> 00:47:35,178
Maybe they know I gay, I don't know.

613
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,706
- I don't know if you'd
call my family strange.

614
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:43,001
My dad just tried to
get laid all the time.

615
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:45,990
So my mom left him for some freak she met

616
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:48,614
at a clinic in California.

617
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:50,530
- You think that bad?

618
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,794
- I don't know.

619
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:53,308
- Doesn't sound so bad.

620
00:47:53,308 --> 00:47:54,898
But you got a lot of things,

621
00:47:54,898 --> 00:47:57,465
nice house, boat, family.

622
00:47:57,465 --> 00:47:59,208
Only way I know a place like this,

623
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:01,737
be here, not family, is to be gay.

624
00:48:01,737 --> 00:48:03,634
- What's that got to do with anything?

625
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:05,837
- You think if I'm not gay, you know me?

626
00:48:05,837 --> 00:48:07,139
I be here?

627
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:08,556
Who take me here?

628
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:11,608
You that's bad?

629
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:14,494
- No, I don't.

630
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,170
- I have park in Vietnam.

631
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,894
I go out with some kids there.

632
00:48:20,894 --> 00:48:22,293
They don't like it.

633
00:48:22,293 --> 00:48:24,955
They say I'm black, they
say I'm ugly and something.

634
00:48:24,955 --> 00:48:28,174
And their mom say, no no
no, don't go out with him,

635
00:48:28,174 --> 00:48:29,091
he's black.

636
00:48:34,821 --> 00:48:36,904
- I should get back soon.

637
00:48:52,088 --> 00:48:54,326
(water splashing)

638
00:48:54,326 --> 00:48:56,159
- You're already gone.

639
00:48:58,943 --> 00:49:00,526
You need some beer.

640
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:33,171
(talking low)

641
00:49:56,592 --> 00:49:59,175
(upbeat music)

642
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:14,706
- Can I have two beer please?

643
00:50:14,706 --> 00:50:16,220
- You old enough to buy?

644
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,053
- Yes.

645
00:50:19,055 --> 00:50:20,555
- That'll be 2.50.

646
00:50:37,387 --> 00:50:38,220
One, two.

647
00:50:39,629 --> 00:50:40,932
- Keep the change.

648
00:50:40,932 --> 00:50:43,099
Got ourself a big spender.

649
00:50:50,587 --> 00:50:53,633
- Excuse me, do you have firework?

650
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,466
- What?

651
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:55,491
- Do you have firework?

652
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:56,506
- Yeah, in the back.

653
00:50:56,506 --> 00:50:59,341
- You have any big one? (mumbling)

654
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:00,941
- I don't know what you call it,

655
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:03,997
you'll have to look for yourself.

656
00:51:03,997 --> 00:51:05,519
Joe, show him the fireworks.

657
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:07,152
- What do you know about fireworks?

658
00:51:07,152 --> 00:51:07,985
- A lot.

659
00:51:09,853 --> 00:51:13,770
(talking drowned out by music)

660
00:51:18,512 --> 00:51:20,408
- Enjoy your chocolate Amber.

661
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:21,241
- Okay.

662
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:22,491
- Alright baby.

663
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:29,584
- That's all we have.

664
00:51:29,584 --> 00:51:31,730
Most of it's gone by now.

665
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,147
- Some very good.

666
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:35,612
- How can you tell?

667
00:51:37,362 --> 00:51:38,627
- See what you want?

668
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:40,127
- Yeah, something.

669
00:51:41,117 --> 00:51:41,950
Hold this.

670
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:45,676
You got a box?

671
00:51:45,676 --> 00:51:46,509
- Sure.

672
00:51:48,129 --> 00:51:50,159
- How much money do you have?

673
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,469
- 20 bucks but I don't wanna
spend it all on this shit.

674
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:55,802
- Give it to me.

675
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:03,052
- So where you from?

676
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:03,885
- Memphis.

677
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:07,247
- No, I mean, where you really from?

678
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:08,856
You from China or something?

679
00:52:08,856 --> 00:52:11,519
- Yeah, I'm from China.

680
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:13,378
- That's interesting.

681
00:52:13,378 --> 00:52:15,868
How'd you end up here?

682
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:18,118
(mumbling)

683
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:21,692
- Take a few things from this?

684
00:52:21,692 --> 00:52:23,359
- Yeah, that's okay.

685
00:52:34,823 --> 00:52:37,740
(crickets singing)

686
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:48,610
Get out of here.

687
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:04,814
Shit, kick it.

688
00:53:07,668 --> 00:53:08,875
- What do you mean?

689
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,708
- Kick it out of here.

690
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:16,724
- What was wrong with it?

691
00:53:18,568 --> 00:53:20,043
- You make me crazy.

692
00:53:20,043 --> 00:53:20,876
- Stop it.

693
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:32,818
- Careful, okay?

694
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:34,235
- You be careful.

695
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,063
(firework screams)

696
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,896
- Woah.

697
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:48,680
Shit.

698
00:53:53,288 --> 00:53:54,121
- Woah.

699
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:00,433
How many is it supposed to have?

700
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:02,042
- Two.

701
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:03,690
Three.

702
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,107
That one cleared.

703
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:24,954
- You boys can't do those here.

704
00:54:24,954 --> 00:54:26,927
You outta take 'em back
to wherever you came from.

705
00:54:26,927 --> 00:54:27,942
- Why not?

706
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:29,092
- It's illegal here.

707
00:54:29,092 --> 00:54:30,701
You're gonna get me in trouble.

708
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:32,138
- Can you take me go back there?

709
00:54:32,138 --> 00:54:34,762
- You understand you can't
do them in the whole county.

710
00:54:34,762 --> 00:54:36,659
- I understand everything you said.

711
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:38,996
- Hey come on, we'll go,
we won't set off any more.

712
00:54:38,996 --> 00:54:40,988
- I'm just trying to tell you the law.

713
00:54:40,988 --> 00:54:42,195
- You a lawyer?

714
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,973
I don't see you no lawyer.

715
00:54:44,973 --> 00:54:48,287
Nobody else cares so why
not live by the law, okay?

716
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:50,395
We're not doing anything.

717
00:54:50,395 --> 00:54:53,153
- Oh well, we might as well stay here now.

718
00:54:53,153 --> 00:54:54,801
(police sirens ringing)

719
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:57,384
No sense in going anywhere now.

720
00:55:27,576 --> 00:55:29,493
- What's going on here?

721
00:55:32,404 --> 00:55:33,821
Who are these kids?

722
00:55:33,821 --> 00:55:36,599
- I don't know who they are.

723
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,745
- You set off those fireworks?

724
00:55:38,745 --> 00:55:40,105
- No sir.

725
00:55:40,105 --> 00:55:42,136
(laughs)

726
00:55:42,136 --> 00:55:44,128
- I like that.

727
00:55:44,128 --> 00:55:47,250
If you didn't, then who did?

728
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,358
Man, ya'll know we ain't had
no rain in the whole state

729
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,729
of Mississippi for over a month.

730
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:56,062
Those fields out there are dry as paper.

731
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:01,561
Where'd these fireworks come from?

732
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:02,691
- It ain't mine, Ron.

733
00:56:02,691 --> 00:56:06,108
- They sure as hell come from your store.

734
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:13,199
Okay, I'm gonna have to ask
you fellas to come with me.

735
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:19,501
Hey, hey!

736
00:56:23,936 --> 00:56:25,488
Come back here.

737
00:56:25,488 --> 00:56:26,738
Come back here.

738
00:56:31,082 --> 00:56:33,915
(heavy breathing)

739
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:52,931
(groaning)

740
00:56:56,008 --> 00:56:57,758
- Crazy motherfucker.

741
00:56:59,265 --> 00:57:00,098
Damn it.

742
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:15,674
- Motherfucker.

743
00:57:15,674 --> 00:57:16,938
- Why'd you do that?

744
00:57:16,938 --> 00:57:18,701
Why'd you do it to me?

745
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,951
(mumbling)

746
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:30,614
You crazy.

747
00:57:38,153 --> 00:57:40,820
You leave me here, motherfucker?

748
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:58,434
(knocking)

749
00:59:49,973 --> 00:59:52,635
- What happened to you?

750
00:59:52,635 --> 00:59:55,718
- I spent the night out in the woods.

751
00:59:56,984 --> 00:59:58,478
- Have you talked to your dad?

752
00:59:58,478 --> 00:59:59,570
- No.

753
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,390
- He's called a lot.

754
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,980
Don't you think you should?

755
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:03,813
- I will.

756
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,851
- He kept calling here.

757
01:00:08,497 --> 01:00:10,107
- What'd you say to him?

758
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:13,153
- Nothing, I didn't know what to say.

759
01:00:13,153 --> 01:00:15,777
I didn't know where you were.

760
01:00:15,777 --> 01:00:17,027
Where were you?

761
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,950
- I went everywhere.

762
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:23,828
Driving around.

763
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:27,386
Just couldn't go home.

764
01:00:27,386 --> 01:00:30,011
- You've been driving around since Friday?

765
01:00:30,011 --> 01:00:32,178
That's a pretty long time.

766
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:38,306
Did you take more drugs?

767
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:39,139
- No.

768
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:46,293
- I don't want my parents to see you.

769
01:01:12,727 --> 01:01:14,585
- Can I lay down?

770
01:01:14,585 --> 01:01:15,835
- I don't care.

771
01:01:40,513 --> 01:01:42,180
- Come here with me.

772
01:01:43,712 --> 01:01:45,629
Come on, I want you to.

773
01:02:00,911 --> 01:02:03,076
Will you come to my house with me?

774
01:02:03,076 --> 01:02:06,064
- I don't want your dad to be mad at me.

775
01:02:06,064 --> 01:02:07,941
- He wouldn't.

776
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:10,087
- But he'll think I was lying.

777
01:02:10,087 --> 01:02:13,267
- You don't have to lie, you
don't have to say anything.

778
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:15,758
- Oh sure, just be mute.

779
01:02:15,758 --> 01:02:17,841
- That's not what I mean.

780
01:02:22,846 --> 01:02:23,763
I love you.

781
01:02:37,099 --> 01:02:39,053
You know I do.

782
01:02:39,053 --> 01:02:41,220
I'll do anything you want.

783
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,603
I don't care.

784
01:02:48,938 --> 01:02:49,771
- What?

785
01:02:51,945 --> 01:02:54,612
- I'm just happy to be with you.

786
01:02:59,934 --> 01:03:03,017
Do you have any clothes I can borrow?

787
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:04,694
- Yeah.

788
01:03:14,574 --> 01:03:17,026
- When I was outside last
night, I had a dream about you.

789
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,526
You wanna hear it?

790
01:03:19,823 --> 01:03:20,666
Huh?

791
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:21,499
- Okay.

792
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:27,592
- It was in my room at home,
except it was your room.

793
01:03:28,616 --> 01:03:31,911
You were living there instead of me.

794
01:03:31,911 --> 01:03:35,244
You wanted me to come in and
take off all your clothes.

795
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:38,290
I went in and then you were gone.

796
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:40,540
I couldn't see you anymore.

797
01:03:43,923 --> 01:03:46,451
Do you wanna come in here with me?

798
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:48,099
- Do you want me to?

799
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:50,182
- I do, don't be a flirt.

800
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,183
- What if my mother hears us?

801
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:58,183
- Don't worry about her.

802
01:04:54,382 --> 01:04:57,049
- Just get in the goddamn house.

803
01:08:11,156 --> 01:08:13,739
(upbeat music)

804
01:08:47,251 --> 01:08:49,668
(chattering)

805
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:11,993
- What you doing?

806
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:13,576
You make me scared.

807
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,832
- I'm sorry, that's
not what I meant to do.

808
01:12:18,832 --> 01:12:20,441
Do I look so bad?

809
01:12:20,441 --> 01:12:22,778
- No you don't look so bad
but it's the way you look

810
01:12:22,778 --> 01:12:24,445
at me, I don't know.

811
01:12:31,744 --> 01:12:35,135
- Well, I was just trying
to get up the courage

812
01:12:35,135 --> 01:12:37,031
to come and say hello.

813
01:12:37,031 --> 01:12:38,364
- I'm not sober.

814
01:12:40,786 --> 01:12:43,410
- You finished with that?

815
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,694
- Yeah.

816
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,035
- Can I get you another?

817
01:12:46,035 --> 01:12:46,868
- Sure.

818
01:12:50,173 --> 01:12:53,506
- Excuse me, can I get two beers please?

819
01:12:56,533 --> 01:12:58,372
So what's your name?

820
01:12:58,372 --> 01:12:59,732
- John.

821
01:12:59,732 --> 01:13:00,732
- I'm Ricky.

822
01:13:02,089 --> 01:13:02,922
- Nice to meet you.

823
01:13:02,922 --> 01:13:03,755
- Same.

824
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:09,933
Thank you.

825
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:12,590
- Thank you.

826
01:13:14,138 --> 01:13:16,629
- So how you been doing tonight?

827
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:18,487
- I'm okay right now.

828
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:20,939
I'm here talking with you.

829
01:13:20,939 --> 01:13:22,970
Everything I want, I got it.

830
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,445
No problem.

831
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:25,362
- I'm glad.

832
01:13:30,499 --> 01:13:31,935
- You're a nice guy.

833
01:13:31,935 --> 01:13:32,768
- Huh?

834
01:13:32,768 --> 01:13:34,636
- You're a nice guy.

835
01:13:34,636 --> 01:13:36,886
- I thought I seemed scary.

836
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:40,556
- I don't know.

837
01:13:40,556 --> 01:13:42,587
I like the people that come talk to me.

838
01:13:42,587 --> 01:13:46,303
(mumbling) I can tell.

839
01:13:46,303 --> 01:13:48,966
I don't like it, one
guy come, he talk to me,

840
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,958
he tell me he got a big dick.

841
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:53,544
I said, what the hell you
talking to me about that?

842
01:13:53,544 --> 01:13:54,675
So what?

843
01:13:54,675 --> 01:13:56,629
I don't care you big, you small.

844
01:13:56,629 --> 01:13:58,372
Why you telling me about that?

845
01:13:58,372 --> 01:13:59,905
I don't feel good for that.

846
01:13:59,905 --> 01:14:01,341
Leave me alone, okay?

847
01:14:01,341 --> 01:14:03,793
- He just came up to you and
said, hi, I got a big dick?

848
01:14:03,793 --> 01:14:06,284
- Yeah and I said, what do you think I am?

849
01:14:06,284 --> 01:14:07,529
I find some big dick?

850
01:14:07,529 --> 01:14:08,362
No.

851
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:13,412
I need lover, I don't
wanna fuck around, shit.

852
01:14:22,536 --> 01:14:25,286
You make me crazy, you know that?

853
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:30,122
Hey, let's get out of here.

854
01:14:30,122 --> 01:14:33,302
I know a place we can
go, buy a beer and talk.

855
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,394
Get out of here.

856
01:14:34,394 --> 01:14:35,582
- Sure.

857
01:14:35,582 --> 01:14:37,440
- Yeah, I'd like that.

858
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,440
I don't like this place.

859
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:45,525
You got a car?

860
01:14:45,525 --> 01:14:46,358
- Yeah.

861
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:48,979
- Okay, you ready?

862
01:14:54,739 --> 01:14:58,572
(upbeat music and chattering)

863
01:15:17,838 --> 01:15:19,486
It's so quiet out here.

864
01:15:19,486 --> 01:15:20,922
- It's late.

865
01:15:20,922 --> 01:15:22,672
- It's not that late.

866
01:15:30,801 --> 01:15:32,384
- Where am I going?

867
01:15:33,464 --> 01:15:36,297
- I tell you, keep going straight.

868
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:53,624
(singing in foreign language)

869
01:16:14,851 --> 01:16:16,633
How long I know you?

870
01:16:16,633 --> 01:16:18,216
One hour, two hour?

871
01:16:19,334 --> 01:16:20,982
You think I like you a lot, right?

872
01:16:20,982 --> 01:16:22,342
- I don't know.

873
01:16:22,342 --> 01:16:24,411
- But you think maybe, you're not sure?

874
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:25,911
- No I'm not sure.

875
01:16:27,744 --> 01:16:29,161
- I just playing.

876
01:16:30,599 --> 01:16:32,668
- You mean you lie.

877
01:16:32,668 --> 01:16:34,487
You don't like me.

878
01:16:34,487 --> 01:16:36,614
- No, I don't lie.

879
01:16:36,614 --> 01:16:39,028
But I play with people all my life.

880
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:41,212
I want to play game with people.

881
01:16:41,212 --> 01:16:44,717
I call, I hug a lot, everybody like you,

882
01:16:44,717 --> 01:16:46,805
they want me, they hug from me.

883
01:16:46,805 --> 01:16:48,664
That's the way I am.

884
01:16:48,664 --> 01:16:50,771
But I know someday I really hurt.

885
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:53,223
If you play game, you hurt form play game.

886
01:16:53,223 --> 01:16:54,373
I know that.

887
01:16:54,373 --> 01:16:56,825
But now, I just play game.

888
01:16:56,825 --> 01:16:58,089
- What are you trying to say?

889
01:16:58,089 --> 01:17:00,292
- I not do something for you.

890
01:17:00,292 --> 01:17:02,361
I do something for me.

891
01:17:02,361 --> 01:17:04,698
Before I young, I hurt from love,

892
01:17:04,698 --> 01:17:07,016
but right now, I learn, I learn a lot.

893
01:17:07,016 --> 01:17:08,510
I hurt a lot.

894
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,158
But now I know better.

895
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:11,920
I do everything I want.

896
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,779
I don't care.

897
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:16,192
- I don't believe you.

898
01:17:16,192 --> 01:17:18,683
- You don't know me.

899
01:17:18,683 --> 01:17:21,461
- I don't know you
basically but I don't think

900
01:17:21,461 --> 01:17:24,641
you're the way you think you are.

901
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:27,808
- I talk, I say nice thing but inside,

902
01:17:28,836 --> 01:17:30,253
nothing, nothing.

903
01:17:31,882 --> 01:17:34,238
You don't know when I say
it but I have nothing here.

904
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:35,752
You think that I ask weird.

905
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:37,648
You think that I go home
and think about you.

906
01:17:37,648 --> 01:17:40,656
But I'm not, I go home and
sleep, I never think about

907
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,489
you again.

908
01:17:44,296 --> 01:17:47,208
- I get the feeling you
don't wanna have sex with me.

909
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,200
- Boy, I sorry.

910
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,599
You think I talk too much.

911
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,932
- No that's not what I mean.

912
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:56,097
- Yes you did.

913
01:17:56,097 --> 01:17:58,415
You just wanna have sex with me, right?

914
01:17:58,415 --> 01:18:02,476
- No, but it wouldn't be so bad though.

915
01:18:02,476 --> 01:18:05,445
- That what you want, I know.

916
01:18:05,445 --> 01:18:06,278
