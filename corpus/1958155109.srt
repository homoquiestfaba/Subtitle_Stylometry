1
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,532
- Hello, my love!

2
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,766
- Hey, babe! How was the game?

3
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,137
- It was great, we won.

4
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,438
Nicky hit two singles
and a double.

5
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,140
Tell your mom about the game.

6
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,442
I would've got the triple,
but I tripped over second base.

7
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,278
- That's why I tell you to keep
rounding your corners, remember?

8
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,414
- Hey, a double is
really great, too, sweetie.

9
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,949
Stan, why isn't Nicky
in the back in his car seat?

10
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,153
- Cause he's a big boy,
he's not a little baby anymore.

11
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,121
He gets to ride up in front with
his old man

12
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,157
cause he's a champion and that's
what the champions do.

13
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,592
- He's too small, okay?
It's not very safe.

14
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,094
- Daddy took the team
out to lunch

15
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,961
at the Dugout
after the game!

16
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,898
- Yes, he did. Grilled cheeses
for everybody.

17
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,433
- The Dugout, huh?

18
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,202
Did daddy had anything to drink
with his lunch?

19
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,504
- Yes, I had one beer, Aud,
thank you for asking.

20
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,072
- And a whiskey.

21
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,575
- You, little snitch.
- Stan, you're driving.

22
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,343
- I'm completely fine. It was an
hour and a half ago,

23
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,777
I had a
full meal.

24
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,513
Hey, we're gonna pass the stores
here in a minute.

25
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,515
You want me to grab something
for dinner? A bottle of wine?

26
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,317
What are we going
to eat tonight?

27
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,152
- Pizza!

28
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,656
- Well, what did you eat
at the Dugout?

29
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,459
- Pizza...
- You want pizza again?

30
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,961
Yep. Pizza is my favorite food.

31
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,863
Oooh, I love this song!

32
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,100
- Do you like Billy Joel?
How do you even know Billy Joel?

33
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,436
- He's Alexa Ray's father,
right?

34
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,171
- Who is Alexa Ray?

35
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,140
- You know, coach,
someday you gonna have

36
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,576
to actually teach your son
what this song is about.

37
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,611
- I don't know,
what is it about?

38
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,346
- What is it about, daddy?

39
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,784
No, no. No.
Oh, please, God, no!

40
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:16,583
- Audrey, huh I had to borrow
one of the nurse's phones.

41
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,818
Just talk to me, please.

42
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,655
Please, come to the hospital.
Please.

43
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,024
- I can't.

44
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,795
- But this wasn't my fault.
I only had one drink.

45
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,298
I was within the legal limit.
I wasn't intoxicated.

46
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:32,700
That truck was out of control.

47
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,168
There was nothing I could do.

48
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,270
- Your reflexes were slowed.

49
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,571
You didn't put Nicky
in his car seat.

50
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,173
He might have survived.

51
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,177
- We don't know that.

52
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,414
- Exactly. And we never will.
I told you

53
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,450
I told you a hundred times
no to drink and drive.

54
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,950
A hundred times!

55
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,554
- Please...

56
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,024
- And now my baby is dead.

57
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,859
- He was my child too.

58
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:06,266
I just need you
to forgive me.

59
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,739
- I can't I can't,
it's too soon.

60
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,173
How can you ask me that?

61
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,777
- I need you
I need my mountain...

62
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,646
- Don't Don't call me that.

63
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,183
You have everything you need.

64
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,285
The hospital has
all your information.

65
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,421
It's up to you.
You'll be fine.

66
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,023
- No, wait, please,
I need my...

67
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,641
I told you to leave me
the fuck alone!

68
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,577
- Audrey.

69
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:56,316
- Oh, God, Father Hill,
I'm so sorry.

70
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,686
I thought you're someone else.
Please, forgive me.

71
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,322
- You thought I was Stanley?

72
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,358
- Yeah, he's just called
from the hospital.

73
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,193
He won't give up.

74
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,929
When I see him
I just I wanna scream.

75
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,533
- Of course. I understand.

76
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,536
I can't even imagine how hard
all of this is for you.

77
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,006
And I'm praying for you.
And for Stanley.

78
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:25,179
Oh, no, I didn't mean.
Look at me,

79
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,948
I'm calling to give you
good news and I'm ruining it.

80
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,517
- Good news?

81
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,053
- Yes. Audrey, the church has
been searching

82
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,355
for someone like you.

83
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:39,026
Someone who deserves
a second chance.

84
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,061
- Father, I don't understand.

85
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,630
- I know this is
going to seem daunting.

86
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,732
But allow me to connect you

87
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,135
with someone who can explain it.

88
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,773
Audrey, this is Cardinal Degal.

89
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,641
- Hello, my child.

90
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:58,178
I have learned of your loss.
I am so sorry.

91
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:03,016
- Thank you,
Your... Holiness.

92
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,718
- Your Eminence, technically,

93
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:08,355
but I think Cardinal Degal
will do just fine.

94
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,492
- Okay.

95
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,461
- I'm sure you're a bit
confused, allow me to explain.

96
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:18,765
I'm in charge of a special
project here in the Vatican.

97
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,534
Our mission is to help people

98
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,537
who have been struck
by great tragedy.

99
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,606
Needless to say,
when I heard your story,

100
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:29,543
I thought, perhaps
she could use our help.

101
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,114
- I don't understand.
Help how?

102
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:36,350
- A miracle.

103
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,586
I am here to offer you
a miracle.

104
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,127
I am Cardinal Degal.

105
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,862
Today is the 27th of January,

106
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,365
in the year of our Lord 2023,

107
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:55,102
time is approximately 7:32 a.m.

108
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,803
We're about to bring
Subject Nineteen

109
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,906
into the Antechamber.

110
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,075
From everything we've learned
in previous trials,

111
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,312
I am very hopeful that...

112
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:12,152
No, I am certain

113
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,489
that we will succeed
with our first attempt.

114
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:22,095
May God grant us all
His blessings.

115
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,538
Let's get started.

116
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:44,685
Miss Martin, have faith.
Have faith.

117
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,955
I'm sorry. I cannot
let you enter this room.

118
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,058
You have to wait here.

119
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,992
- But

120
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,227
- Faith, my child.

121
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,419
Miss Martin,
there is someone

122
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:22,155
who wants to see you.

123
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,631
This is God's miracle.

124
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,634
Your son was chosen to be
the first Resurrected Person.

125
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,603
And now he stands as an example
of what awaits

126
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:40,374
all people who follow
the Word of God.

127
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,342
We join you tonight
with an extraordinary

128
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,012
story out of the Vatican,

129
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,779
where the Church has claimed to
achieve the impossible.

130
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,915
They discovered how to resurrect
the recently deceased.

131
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,885
The Pope assures the world
that this is not a hoax.

132
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,255
The Church has been pursuing
this endeavor for decades.

133
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,890
Now they say they have
successfully

134
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,759
brought a young boy killed in
car crash back to life.

135
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,160
Obviously, there is
much skepticism

136
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,695
surrounding the story.

137
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,330
Especially, considering
the Church's refusal

138
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,765
to reveal the science
behind it.

139
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,600
Still, as of yet no one
has been able

140
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,137
to explain how the boy
was revived.

141
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,604
- So, how does this fit in

142
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,206
with the traditional
teachings of the Church?

143
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,143
- We're not abandoning
tradition.

144
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,345
We're simply trying to move the
Church into the 21st century,

145
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,347
while still following
the sacred scriptures

146
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,816
that have been handed down
to us by God.

147
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,451
- But you're saying people

148
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,820
have to convert
if they want immortality.

149
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,823
- We're not offering
immortality.

150
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:33,560
We're simply offering
second chance to those

151
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,330
who accept Jesus Christ
as their Lord and Savior.

152
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:56,450
Hey, guys, I dunno about you

153
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,518
but with all
the Reincarnation stuff,

154
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,321
I'm feeling a bit riskier
than usual.

155
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:04,257
For the record,
this is not a suicide.

156
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,526
I'm a good Christian, I love
God.

157
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,097
I'm just trying to
pull off some gnarly shit.

158
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,531
So, if I don't make it,

159
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,601
make sure Jesus brings me back.

160
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,269
Peace!

161
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,312
Death is natural, it's part
of the organic life cycle,

162
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,814
even when it's tragic.

163
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,751
But what the Catholic Church
is offering is dangerous.

164
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,719
It hasn't even been
vetted by the FDA.

165
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,521
The Surgeon General has
no idea how it works.

166
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,757
And nobody has any clue
what they're actually doing,

167
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,825
and yet their protections
as a religion

168
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,595
allows them to break the laws
of nature?!

169
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,266
- Ms. Martin, how is it
that you were granted

170
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,069
an annulment after
six years of marriage?

171
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,736
- No comment.

172
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,505
- Mr. Martin,

173
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,773
what do you have to say to your
son's role as spokesperson for
RPs.

174
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,307
- Fuck off.

175
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,742
- How did you get

176
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,477
the Ecclesiastical Tribunal
to agree to that?

177
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,546
- Speak with Bishop Hill
of the Archdiocese.

178
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,448
Now, leave us in peace, please.

179
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,283
- When have you last spoken
to your son?

180
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,684
- Fuck off!

181
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,554
- Sir, any thoughts
on RPs at all?

182
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,523
Let the people know
what it's like

183
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,991
to have your son brought back.

184
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,659
As you can see,
not everyone is thrilled

185
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,629
by resurrecting family
members that have died

186
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,431
The ban on baptism has created

187
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,300
a lucrative black market
for smugglers,

188
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:24,337
who offer to sneak dead loved
ones out of the Middle East.

189
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,473
Just past the border,
the bodies

190
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,575
are posthumously baptized
by missionary Priests

191
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,013
and sent off to the nearest
Resurrection Center.

192
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,019
- So, in order for the Church
to resurrect me

193
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,854
I have to hand over my entire
digital history.

194
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,491
We're talking phone calls,
texts, emails, hard drives.

195
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,260
This is crazy.

196
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,828
What about privacy?

197
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,629
Is the Church trying to become
the new Big Brother?

198
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,898
- Dude, first of all, you don t
have to sign a contract.

199
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,633
Besides, the Church
can only access

200
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,669
this information after
your death.

201
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,305
While you're alive
nobody's gonna know

202
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,738
what porn you like watching

203
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,674
and who you've been sending
your dickpics to.

204
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,342
- All right, let's talk about
these "Cherubs" for a second.

205
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,045
Cause this is really crazy.

206
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,780
The Church is hiring ex-hackers
to look for my sins.

207
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:10,151
So, some guy who only yesterday
was hacking the White House

208
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:12,786
or steal money from somebody's
bank account

209
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,856
is now going to rummage through
my entire digital past

210
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:19,492
and judge me for my sins.
What the hell?

211
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,965
How do you wanna believe us
in this nonsense?

212
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,834
Why do all the resurrected
return without a single scratch?

213
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,171
What about the bullet wounds,
scars, and all this crap?

214
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,671
Wake up, it's all a scam...

215
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,576
- Audrey, one thing we all
want to know.

216
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,279
Is he better behaved now?

217
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,414
Like, do you have to fight to
get him to do his homework?

218
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,851
Yeah, he's a normal kid. Just
like he was before and huh

219
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,355
But, yes, we sort of fight over
homework sometimes.

220
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,325
- Well, Nicholas,
I guess being the very first

221
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,492
resurrected person
doesn't excuse you

222
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,161
from certain responsibilities.

223
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:55,929
What do you think about that?

224
00:14:56,063 --> 00:15:00,000
- I feel blessed.
Until I have to do my homework.

225
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:23,324
I'm sure all of you know
Nicholas Martin's story by now.

226
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,658
Most of you probably saw
the interview

227
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,494
when it first aired
five years ago.

228
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,697
Then we lived in a cruel world
where children like Nicholas

229
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,666
could be ripped from
their parents' arms

230
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,235
without a moment's notice.

231
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:37,171
But cruelty is not God's will.

232
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:39,273
for when one of his purest
creations was taken away,

233
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:42,776
he returned unharmed.

234
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,546
He gave Nicholas
a second chance.

235
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,550
And that's what resurrection is.
A second chance.

236
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:54,454
For family, for love, for life.

237
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:58,825
And understand, resurrection is
not about immortality.

238
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,896
No, it's more like a safety net
for our time here on Earth.

239
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,865
In the end, we must all return
to God's Kingdom.

240
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:09,636
And that's the real reward for
living a good, righteous life.

241
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,353
All right, that's it for today.

242
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,620
May the Lord be with you.

243
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,756
May the Almighty God bless you.

244
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,194
The Father, the Son and
the Holy Spirit. Amen.

245
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,694
Amen!

246
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,225
- Hey, Dad.

247
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,395
- Heeey,
St. Nick. What's up, buddy?

248
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,398
- I'm good. Mom says hi.

249
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,500
- Great. Hey, Audrey.

250
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,900
What do you cook?

251
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:14,968
- Well, it smells good anyway.

252
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,569
- So, what's up?

253
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,737
Tell me how you've been,
tell me everything.

254
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,040
How is school?

255
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:20,807
- Well, it's almost
Spring Break.

256
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,876
So, I didn't really
learn anything.

257
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,280
Mom's taking me to the graffiti
exhibit at the Art Center.

258
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,182
- Well, mom's is a fun machine.

259
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,883
- Yeah.

260
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:31,651
- Look, I wanted to talk to you
about Spring Break.

261
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,988
- Well, yeah,
it's gonna be awesome.

262
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:38,092
Tuesday I'm doing a lecture
at the Catholic Youth League.

263
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,694
And later for the eighth grade
classes of Saint Francis.

264
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:46,300
Wednesday I'm doing RP at
the Children's Brunch.

265
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,303
And Thursday is

266
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:52,173
I don't really remember
but there is something.

267
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,574
- Busy is good.
Busy is good.

268
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,310
- Yeah.

269
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:58,312
- What do you talk about when
you talk to all these people?

270
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:00,081
You ever get nervous?

271
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:02,283
- No, honestly they wanna know
about the resurrection.

272
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,683
How my life has changed,

273
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,288
and stuff like that.
I like it. It's fun.

274
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,656
- You know, your old man does
a lot of public speaking.

275
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,891
I could give you some pointers.
If you want.

276
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:13,827
- No, don't worry.
If I ever get stuck, Bishop Hill

277
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,097
usually asks me a question
or helps me out but

278
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,533
I don't usually.

279
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,002
- Sure.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

280
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:24,205
We're gonna have
an Easter party here.

281
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:27,475
- Christ's resurrection
is a big day for us.

282
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,543
- Yeah.

283
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,012
- What? What is it?
Something wrong?

284
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:35,216
- I was thinking I can ask
mom to invite you.

285
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:38,685
Nicholas!

286
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:45,192
- Hey, you know what, buddy.
Don't bother her.

287
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:47,027
If she wants to invite me,
she will. Okay?

288
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:50,598
And I probably, I definitely,
have a mass that day.

289
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,166
Nicholas!

290
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,102
- Okay, I gotta go.
I love you, dad.

291
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:56,203
- I love you too.

292
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:58,005
Hey, can you put
your mom on for a second?

293
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:01,741
- Yeah, just one sec.
Hey, mom. Dad wants to talk.

294
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,310
- Heeeey.
- Hi!

295
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,079
- What's up? How are you?

296
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,981
- Everything's good.
We are fine.

297
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:10,984
- Great. Hey, Audrey, listen.

298
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:13,786
He missed our call last week.

299
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,722
You know,
it's really important to me

300
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,824
that I get this time
with him.

301
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,427
It's really the only chance
we have to talk

302
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,995
and I need these calls.

303
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,265
- Yeah, sorry, I know.
He's just so busy right now.

304
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:28,002
- Yeah, he tells me he is
talking to all sort of groups.

305
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:30,670
But is he getting
enough down time,

306
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,574
does he get enough time
to be himself?

307
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,276
Is he even
playing sports anymore?

308
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,611
- You know, it's his choice.
I've asked him.

309
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:38,945
He's having fun,
he's meeting

310
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:39,913
a lot of new people,
learning a lot.

311
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,583
He's fine, Stan, really.

312
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,386
- Cool. Cool.

313
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,122
Oh, he told me that you guys
are having an Easter party.

314
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,523
Is that right?

315
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:52,026
- Ah, yeah, I thought he could
use a little celebration.

316
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,030
- Definitely. It's a good idea.
Great idea.

317
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,599
Who is coming?

318
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:02,002
- Umm, Nicky's friends from
school, some of the neighbors.

319
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:04,371
He's been talking to so many
large groups lately.

320
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,640
I wanna keep this one small.

321
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,509
- Yeah.

322
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,277
- Yeaaah.

323
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:16,383
- Okay. I won't keep you.

324
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,953
Take care, Aud.

325
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:23,157
- You too, Stan. Bye.

326
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,126
Little Mountain...

327
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,071
They told me it was going to
feel strange coming back,

328
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:41,108
that I will have to readjust
to being alive.

329
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:45,812
But I didn't think it was going
to be this hard.

330
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,582
- I believed in Islam.

331
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:49,949
And one day I die and wake up

332
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:51,151
and my wife tells me
I've been baptized

333
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:53,053
- Do you resent her for that?

334
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:56,056
- No, she went to a great risk
to smuggle my body

335
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,492
out of Syria just
to bring me back.

336
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,694
- You know, she did it
because she loves you.

337
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,962
- This is a waste of time,
Father.

338
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:04,831
- Well, it's mandatory
Frank.

339
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,833
Every RP has two months
of counseling.

340
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,070
I'm sorry but it's to help you
to integrate back in the life.

341
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:13,873
- When you finally reach the end
and see what's beyond.

342
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:16,677
It's an incredible rush.

343
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,978
Have you ever died, Father?

344
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:21,215
I think I've asked you
that already.

345
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:23,284
- I have not.

346
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:24,884
- It's amazing.

347
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,622
- You know, after the car crash
they didn't bring her back.

348
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:30,291
Just me.

349
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:34,328
When I ask them why,
they show me these text messages

350
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,097
that a cherub has found.
I mean, okay,

351
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:39,832
I know that she was cheating
on me with some guy

352
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,603
but it's not a murder.

353
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,804
It's not a war crime.

354
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:48,908
- Well, as I understand it

355
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:52,379
- I don't care what she did.

356
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:57,950
If I can forgive her, Father,
why can't God?

357
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:01,188
Why can't
the Church, huh?

358
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:05,326
- Well, I still can't sleep.
Every time I close my eyes

359
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,696
I'd see him coming at me
with that knife.

360
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,499
I feel it slicing into me.

361
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:19,139
Ice cold, yet it burned...

362
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:20,873
- We were struggling
before I died.

363
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,543
We are struggling worse now.

364
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,178
My company downsized

365
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:26,613
while my family was waiting for
me to be brought back.

366
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,549
Now I can't get a job.

367
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,085
Everywhere I go companies
don't wanna hire RPs.

368
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:32,686
I'm ready to sell our home,
take my family

369
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,455
and move to another country.

370
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:36,490
Show them a better way.

371
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,025
- Before you do that
you might be

372
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:39,526
interested to know
that I reached out

373
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,261
the foreman of your old
construction site.

374
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:43,030
I had a little word with him.

375
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:45,632
And well, I think you're ready
to start on Monday.

376
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,035
- Really?

377
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:50,037
- Damn right!

378
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,439
- So, I let a stupid cancer
take me instead

379
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:57,211
and it took forever
and it really hurt.

380
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:58,545
And now that I'm back

381
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,615
everybody's at school
looking at me

382
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:04,385
like I'm some kind of freak.

383
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:06,787
I wish I killed myself
when I have a chance.

384
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:10,424
And my parents wouldn't be able
to bring me back at all.

385
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:13,160
- Look, I don't like when you
talk about hurting yourself.

386
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:16,196
You're a righteous person.

387
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,832
You were challenged.
You stayed strong.

388
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,568
It's amazing, Rose.

389
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:25,672
Rose, you are amazing! Okay?

390
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,177
- All right. That's our time.

391
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,645
You good? You gonna be okay?

392
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,547
- I'm amazing.

393
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,682
- Talk soon.

394
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,452
Hey, love.
I'm glad you called.

395
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:55,822
I was getting so bored sitting
here alone.

396
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:59,626
Anything I can do to help you?

397
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,296
Where is the camera?
I can't see you.

398
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:09,003
Ooh, you must be a celebrity.
Or a politician.

399
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:13,140
I see you've taken out Demerit
Sweeper Insurance. Good.

400
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:16,376
What would you like me to do?

401
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:23,817
That's brilliant.

402
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:26,186
Because ever since we connected

403
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,655
I wanted to tell you
all the nasty things

404
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:35,529
Well, just talk.
Anything in particular?

405
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:49,443
My day? It's been an average day
like many other.

406
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:56,350
An average day The truth
or the fantasy?

407
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:04,324
I took my son to school at 9
and went shopping for food,

408
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,561
picked up some shirts
at the cleaner's.

409
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:11,198
My husband picked up our son
from school at 3.

410
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:14,301
Then I made dinner and

411
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:20,407
Of course. We don't keep secrets
from each other.

412
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,318
Well... I don't wanna be
resurrected.

413
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:33,121
I am a One-Lifer.

414
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:34,855
When my time is up, it's up.

415
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,758
Let nature take its course,
is how I look at it.

416
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,961
Well, now it's your turn.

417
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:43,563
Tell me about your day.

418
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:41,822
- Good morning, Bishop.

419
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:44,758
- Good morning.
Haven't you seen the news?

420
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:48,562
No, sorry, I just woke up.
I was having a late morning.

421
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:51,765
- Stan, there's been
an incident.

422
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,167
- What kind of incident?

423
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,737
In Pittsburgh, they're
constructing some skyscraper

424
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,371
and one of
the construction workers

425
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:01,508
just started pushing his
coworkers off the edge.

426
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:04,444
Seventeen people fell
to their death.

427
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,413
- Oh my God, it's horrible.

428
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:10,317
It gets worse The man
who did it was an RP.

429
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,388
This isn't just some RP, this
man was someone from your flock.

430
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:18,291
You were his counselor, Stan.

431
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:22,529
- Oh my God! Frank Collins?

432
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:25,199
That doesn't make any sense.

433
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:28,035
I just saw Frank.
Where is he now?

434
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:31,438
- The cops had to shoot him with
a bean bag gun and he fell.

435
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,875
- What do you mean he fell?

436
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,576
- 12 stories. He's dead.

437
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,047
- There was no sign he was
suicidal. None!

438
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:41,948
Nothing! He was happy.

439
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,451
I just helped him to get his
job back. He was happy!

440
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:47,454
- This doesn't look good
for the Church, Stan.

441
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:49,123
We are strategizing what to do

442
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:50,791
and we are going
to need your help.

443
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:53,460
- Anything. What's the protocol
for something like that?

444
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:55,595
- There's no protocol
for something like this!

445
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:57,831
It's never happened before.

446
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:02,170
Now, I'm setting you up with a
video chat with an agent Ortiz.

447
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:03,503
She is in charge with

448
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:06,973
Resurrected Persons Unit
of the FBI

449
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:09,543
and I really need you
to cooperate with her.

450
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:11,179
- Of course, your Excellency.

451
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:15,415
- That means to give her
whatever information she wants.

452
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:18,019
And I mean it, Stan.
Whatever she wants.

453
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,989
- Yes, Bishop.

454
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:24,991
- Now, in the meantime,

455
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:30,931
I think it might
be best for you to take a break.

456
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:32,833
- But what about my
congregation?

457
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:34,501
- Oh no, we'll provide a
substitute Priest, of course.

458
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,570
Your flock will be
in good hands.

459
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:39,573
And it's only temporary,
of course.

460
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,641
- Am I being suspended
right now?

461
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:44,312
- Oh, Stan, calm down.

462
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:46,280
I'm doing what I think is best

463
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:47,414
just until the spotlight
is off of you

464
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:49,516
and the dust settles.

465
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:51,685
And Stan,
there's another thing.

466
00:30:51,818 --> 00:30:53,453
It's best
if you avoid contact

467
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:55,889
with Nicholas
for the time being.

468
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,458
- Well now wait a minute, what
does he have to do with this?

469
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:02,696
- Nothing. And we need
to keep it that way.

470
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,299
You don't want the press asking
him a lot of questions, do you?

471
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:07,601
We must protect him from that.

472
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:11,339
- I would never,
ever involve him.

473
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:14,674
- No, you wouldn't,
but others would.

474
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:18,079
I'm only asking for silence.
Once this thing calms down

475
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,714
you can contact Nicholas
whenever you want.

476
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:25,518
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm so sorry
about this.

477
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:29,789
- Let's pray for the victims.

478
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:33,460
- Yes, the victims, indeed.

479
00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:47,208
- But by Resurrecting
the victims,

480
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:49,310
aren't you effectively saying

481
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:50,744
"it's okay to kill people,

482
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:52,979
because there aren't any
consequences"?

483
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:55,049
- Forgive me for saying
so but that's ridiculous.

484
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:57,084
Of course, there are
consequences.

485
00:31:57,218 --> 00:31:59,452
The Fifth Commandant:
thou shalt not kill.

486
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:04,557
It is a mortal sin for anyone
to take the life of a human
being,

487
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:05,892
anyone who commits such sin

488
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:08,029
is no longer eligible
for Resurrection.

489
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:10,630
There is a consequence.

490
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:13,566
Look, I just don't see
why the actions

491
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,172
of one troubled man should ruin
the lives of the Resurrected?

492
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:20,241
- But what do you say
to the One-Lifers,

493
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:25,046
who insist that it isn't natural
to be tampering with mortality?

494
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:30,017
They say bringing humans back to
life is devaluing being alive.

495
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:32,686
- The One-Lifers are fanatics
and atheists.

496
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,988
They have no beliefs, no faith.

497
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:37,191
They think we're no different
than insects.

498
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:51,038
- Hello, Agent Ortiz?

499
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:55,276
- Yes, Father Martin. Bishop
Hill told you I'd be calling.

500
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,211
- He did, yes.

501
00:32:57,345 --> 00:32:59,280
I'm at Resurrected Persons Unit
of the bureau.

502
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:01,915
You were the perpetrator's
mental health counselor.

503
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,117
Is that correct?

504
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,019
- Yes, and his Priest.

505
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:07,887
- Were you surprised when you
heard what he had done?

506
00:33:08,022 --> 00:33:11,092
- I was shocked.
I'm in shock, I still am.

507
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:18,798
It doesn't make any sense.
He was... He was happy.

508
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:20,834
I just helped him
to get his job back

509
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:23,004
- So, no reported depression?

510
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:27,408
- None. If anything, he was
happier than he's ever been.

511
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,576
I mean he...

512
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:31,745
- I need you to send me
the recordings

513
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:33,513
of your sessions
with Frank Collins.

514
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:36,017
Can you email those to me?

515
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,784
- Well, that would be
a violation

516
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:39,519
of the sanctity of the seal.

517
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:42,655
The Church doesn't record
sessions.

518
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:44,258
- Actually, they do.

519
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:46,993
And Bishop Hill assured me
that you would cooperate.

520
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:50,131
- Even if that was true...

521
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:54,135
- It's true.
You and I both know it.

522
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:58,506
- To do so would be instant
grounds for excommunication.

523
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:00,974
I could lose my priesthood.

524
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:02,609
- The Penitent is
no longer alive,

525
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:04,211
and he is not coming back.

526
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,114
I could get a court order,

527
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:12,086
but I'd really hate to do that
because it would cost me a day.

528
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,654
But just so you know,
if I get that court order,

529
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:17,024
we come in like gangbusters.

530
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:19,093
And we are liable
to do some damage.

531
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:21,928
I'll have to confiscate
all of your devices.

532
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:24,532
That means your cellphone too.

533
00:34:24,664 --> 00:34:27,068
So, no Internet,
no phone access

534
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:29,636
until my investigation
is complete.

535
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:33,606
Cut off. Is that understood?

536
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:37,644
- That won't be necessary.

537
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:41,748
I can email those
files over to you now.

538
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:45,419
- Thank you, Father.
Have a great day.

539
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,788
- Yeah. You too, asshole.

540
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:14,248
My brothers and sisters,
it's good to see you all here
connected today.

541
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:15,982
Unfortunately, due to some
personal affairs

542
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:18,119
that require my attention,

543
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:21,355
I will be unable to lead
tonight's mass.

544
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,756
So, I'll be taking
a short leave of absence.

545
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,392
But don't worry.

546
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:28,995
I'm leaving you in the capable
hands of Father Dorian.

547
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,431
- Does this have anything to do

548
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:32,299
with what happened in
Pittsburgh, Father?

549
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:34,268
- Is the church responsible?

550
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:35,969
- I can assure you

551
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:37,438
that the authorities and
the Church are investigating.

552
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:38,972
Right now I don't know
any more than you do.

553
00:35:39,106 --> 00:35:40,807
- Is that why you're leaving?

554
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,942
- No.
- Were you fired?

555
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:45,912
- As I said, I have some
personal affairs to attend to.

556
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:47,680
- Did that guy
kill all those people

557
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,916
- because he was resurrected?
- My wife is being resurrected

558
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,552
next week, is she gonna try to
kill me and the kids?

559
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:53,354
- How did the Church managed
to resurrect the murderer?

560
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,456
- What do you hide?

561
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:04,578
Although the police have not
confirmed

562
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:06,380
the identity of
the perpetrator,

563
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,482
we've learned that his name
was Frank Collins,

564
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:13,420
an RP working sporadically in
the construction industry.

565
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:15,289
We've also learned
that the FBI's

566
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:18,692
RP Unit has taken charge
of this case,

567
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:21,295
led by Agent Gloria Ortiz.

568
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:24,465
At the same time, the Church has
released a statement that...

569
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:31,131
What the hell?

570
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,907
- Hello!

571
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,542
- Hi, are you Cherub 45274?

572
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,076
- What?

573
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:25,913
- Hi, are you Cherub

574
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,314
- Wait, hold on!

575
00:42:34,588 --> 00:42:37,291
- Sorry about that, Father.
What can I do for you?

576
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:40,028
- Are you Cherub 45274?

577
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,030
- That's me.

578
00:42:42,162 --> 00:42:43,764
- They put
you in charge

579
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:45,365
of judging people's souls?

580
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:47,868
- Crazy, right? Are you putting
me back to work now?

581
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,737
- No, I'm-- What do you mean
"back to work"?

582
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:52,239
Were you suspended?

583
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:54,341
- It's not my fault
the guy went nuts.

584
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:56,610
I'll tell you like
I told the other guy,

585
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:58,779
I just sign
the recommendations.

586
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,815
I don't do the paper work.

587
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:04,284
Is that what you're calling
about, right?

588
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:07,187
- Well, it is, sort of.
I was his priest.

589
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,890
- Okay.

590
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:12,359
Why are you calling me?

591
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:14,028
- Well, I was suspended too.

592
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:17,431
I read this news story about an
RP who went on a killing spree.

593
00:43:17,564 --> 00:43:19,166
Just like my Parishioner
in Pittsburgh,

594
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:20,701
the one that you've approved.

595
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,170
And they blamed the priest
and the cherub for it.

596
00:43:23,303 --> 00:43:24,805
They blamed them for everything.

597
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:27,641
- So what? You think this
gonna happen to us?

598
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:30,377
- The priest's name was Father
Robert Flynn,

599
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,945
but when I tried to look him up,

600
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,313
it's like he'd been completely
wiped from the Internet.

601
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:35,215
It s like he doesn't exist.

602
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:37,651
- And that's relevant
to me? How?

603
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,186
- It's really strange,
don't you think?

604
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:41,622
It's like someone erased him.

605
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:44,257
- You sound kind of paranoid,
Father?

606
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:47,127
Okay. I was wondering
if in your training

607
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,496
the Church ever asked you
to do anything

608
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,932
beyond the realm of resurrection
recommendations?

609
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:56,037
Like to perform other duties
with your technical talents?

610
00:43:56,169 --> 00:43:57,804
- Like what?

611
00:43:57,938 --> 00:43:59,973
- Like I said, Father Flynn has
been wiped from the Internet.

612
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:02,509
And I was hoping to find out
how it's possible.

613
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:04,277
And I thought that
you could help me.

614
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:06,080
- Why would you think that?

615
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:08,248
- Cause you're a cherub.
And I'm a priest.

616
00:44:08,382 --> 00:44:11,151
And we both seek to bring
light to the darkness.

617
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,622
- That sounds noble and all

618
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:18,026
but are you even supposed
to be talking to me?

619
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,693
- I don't know. Why not?

620
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:22,496
- So you wouldn't mind if I run
this past my boss first.

621
00:44:24,264 --> 00:44:28,435
- Look, other cherub is listed
as being on permanent hiatus.

622
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:30,071
So, if this shakes out
the same way,

623
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:32,406
you won't have to worry about
having a boss anymore.

624
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,346
- Fine. Send me whatever you
have on this Father Flynn guy.

625
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:41,581
I'll look into it.

626
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:45,086
- Yeah, thank you. My name is
Father Martin by the way.

627
00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:46,319
- Call me Rat.

628
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:47,854
- Rat Like the bubonic plague?

629
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:51,725
- What? No, RAT like Remote
Access Trojan.

630
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:53,994
- Oh, I guess it's a hacker
thing or something

631
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:35,869
Oh, Jesus.

632
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:52,706
- Stan! I'm on my way to Rome,
can I call you back?

633
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:54,407
- This has happened before.

634
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,743
- What?
- Frank Collins.

635
00:47:56,877 --> 00:47:58,745
He's not the first RP
to go on a killing spree.

636
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:00,780
The dentist who started
murdering her patients,

637
00:48:00,914 --> 00:48:03,084
the old man who killed
his grandkids.

638
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,585
The guy who drowned
his family at the beach.

639
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,587
- I don't understand, Stan.

640
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,323
- Your Excellency,
the matter is

641
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:12,826
Frank Collins is not the first
RP to go on a killing spree.

642
00:48:12,959 --> 00:48:14,995
You told me
that there is no protocol

643
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:16,930
for something like this.
There have to be.

644
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,066
- You're taking things
out of context.

645
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,235
- There's undeniable pattern
of behavior here

646
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:23,403
- No one's denying anything.

647
00:48:23,536 --> 00:48:26,073
Yes, we've had a few RPs
who've gone astray,

648
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:28,175
but they're human beings, Stan.

649
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:31,711
That dentist she had some mental
illness and she stopped

650
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:32,712
taking her medications
prescribed

651
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:36,083
before her Resurrection.

652
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:40,054
The grandfather had dementia
and the man at the beach,

653
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:41,988
well, he just snapped
when he discovered

654
00:48:42,123 --> 00:48:45,859
that his wife had an affair with
another man while he was dead.

655
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:49,529
These people are flawed
and cracked.

656
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,499
Sometimes they bend,
sometimes they break.

657
00:48:52,632 --> 00:48:54,601
Just like you and me.

658
00:48:54,734 --> 00:48:59,739
- No. You didn't tell me
any of that before.

659
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:02,043
- I didn't see
any connection before.

660
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:06,546
- Am I under internal
investigation?

661
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,984
- No, of course not. After the
FBI discovers the evidence...

662
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:14,688
- Okay, so, where are
the rest of the priests?

663
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:16,756
Are any of them still working
for the church?

664
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,025
- You're getting ahead
of yourself here.

665
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,626
- Then why won't you
just tell me

666
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:21,461
what happened to the other
RP Counselors?

667
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:24,564
Are they being mothballed,
am I next?

668
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:27,000
- Now, hold on.
- No, Bishop, listen to me.

669
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,668
Please, just tell me
what's going on.

670
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,503
If there is something sinful
happening here,

671
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:31,805
and we don't address it now,

672
00:49:31,938 --> 00:49:33,240
it's only going to get worse.

673
00:49:33,374 --> 00:49:34,741
- That's enough.

674
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:36,776
You certainly crossed
a line here.

675
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,745
Just because there are
certain things

676
00:49:38,878 --> 00:49:40,647
I'm not at liberty
to share with you,

677
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,948
doesn't mean that there is

678
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:43,917
any kind of a cover up
or a conspiracy.

679
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:51,258
Stan, you're beginning to slip
back into your old way of life.

680
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:54,961
It's not good for you,
it's not good for the Church,

681
00:49:55,096 --> 00:49:57,897
and certainly not good
for your family.

682
00:49:58,032 --> 00:50:01,868
Get some exercise,
get some sleep or something.

683
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:05,872
You look terrible.
And we'll talk later.

684
00:50:40,974 --> 00:50:41,875
- Hi.

685
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:44,178
Hello, Father Flynn, this is

686
00:50:44,311 --> 00:50:46,180
- Sorry, I can't make it to my
screen at the moment.

687
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:47,814
I'm indisposed.
Please leave a message

688
00:50:47,947 --> 00:50:49,716
and I'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

689
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:51,118
God bless.

690
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,754
Hi, Father Flynn,

691
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:59,527
my name is Stanley Martin,
Father Stanley Martin.

692
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:03,830
I'm calling because it's in
regards to your parishioner

693
00:51:03,963 --> 00:51:06,699
Anyway, I think we
have some commonalities

694
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:07,767
that I'd like to discuss.

695
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:09,136
Can you give me a call back?

696
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,837
I would really,
really appreciate it.

697
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:13,840
Okay. Thanks.

698
00:51:30,558 --> 00:51:31,991
Please, leave a message

699
00:51:32,126 --> 00:51:34,594
and I will get back to you
as soon as possible.

700
00:51:43,237 --> 00:51:45,206
Hi, this is
Father Stanley Martin.

701
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:46,639
Stanley Martin calling.

702
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:48,576
I'm the Father of the man
in Pittsburgh.

703
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:51,145
I'm calling for Father James...

704
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,447
for Father Antony Russo.

705
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:55,182
I was hoping to speak to you.

706
00:51:55,316 --> 00:51:57,118
There are some commonalities
that I would like to discuss.

707
00:51:57,251 --> 00:52:00,421
And I was hoping to have
a brief conversation with you.

708
00:52:00,554 --> 00:52:02,022
If you can give me a call back

709
00:52:02,156 --> 00:52:04,558
in the earliest convenience
I would really appreciate.

710
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:05,692
Thank you. Thank you.

711
00:52:05,825 --> 00:52:07,261
God bless.

712
00:52:36,956 --> 00:52:38,858
- Father Flynn!

713
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:42,630
Hi! I'm so glad that you
give me a call back.

714
00:52:42,762 --> 00:52:43,863
- Are you one of them?

715
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:46,267
Do you know what
they're planning?

716
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,102
- I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

717
00:52:48,235 --> 00:52:50,604
Did you get my message
last night?

718
00:52:50,737 --> 00:52:52,373
- Your message the RP?

719
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,175
- Yeah. That's exactly
why I called you.

720
00:52:54,308 --> 00:52:56,010
He was the parishioner
in Pittsburgh

721
00:52:56,143 --> 00:52:58,646
who pushed those poor people
off the building.

722
00:52:58,778 --> 00:53:00,614
I think there might be
some similarities

723
00:53:00,747 --> 00:53:01,881
to what happened to

724
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:05,419
- No, no, you don't
know anything

725
00:53:05,553 --> 00:53:08,788
The frequencies have mutated,
don't you understand?

726
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:11,991
The Huguenots tried to warn us.

727
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:13,360
- I'm sorry Father Flynn,

728
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:15,462
I don't know what
you're talking about.

729
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:17,431
- No one will listen to me!

730
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:20,601
We are running out of time.
You can't stop them.

731
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:21,734
- Stop who?

732
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:23,270
- The Warriors, you fool.

733
00:53:23,404 --> 00:53:26,706
They're multiplying.
Soon they'll be everywhere.

734
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,343
They're coming to silence me.

735
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:32,879
- Father, who is trying
to silence you?

736
00:53:33,013 --> 00:53:36,183
Is the Church trying
to cover something up?

737
00:53:36,317 --> 00:53:40,120
Because if you have
any details at all

738
00:53:40,254 --> 00:53:44,924
- They are here.
They are inside me now.

739
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:50,564
- Father.

740
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:53,067
What are you doing with that?

741
00:53:55,135 --> 00:53:57,037
- Father, put down the gun.

742
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:58,738
What are you doing with that?

743
00:53:58,871 --> 00:54:00,507
Father, please stop!

744
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:01,941
Don't! Don't do that!

745
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:03,743
Please, put it down!

746
00:54:03,876 --> 00:54:05,246
Father Flynn, please,
put down the gun!

747
00:54:06,113 --> 00:54:07,847
- Thoughts and prayers.

748
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:27,434
- 911, what's your emergency?

749
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:32,373
- I, I want to report
a... there's a...

750
00:54:32,506 --> 00:54:35,109
- I didn't get that.
What's your address?

751
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:49,856
Fuck...

752
00:54:54,295 --> 00:54:56,196
- RAT! RAT! Your camera is on!

753
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:02,069
- Father? What the fuck I was
trying to turn the app off

754
00:55:02,202 --> 00:55:03,537
- You turned it on instead.

755
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:06,340
But good, because
I really need to talk to you.

756
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:10,144
- You have great timing,
Father, I'll give you that.

757
00:55:10,277 --> 00:55:14,581
We're not living in sin,
we're engaged.

758
00:55:14,715 --> 00:55:16,784
- Rat, stop!

759
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,119
- At least we're engaged
to be engaged

760
00:55:19,253 --> 00:55:20,754
- Please, stop,
I need to talk to you.

761
00:55:20,887 --> 00:55:22,289
Shut up, please!

762
00:55:22,423 --> 00:55:24,291
I have to show you something.

763
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:25,693
Brace yourself.

764
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:30,297
- Hey, are you okay, dude?
You look white as a sheet.

765
00:55:30,431 --> 00:55:35,868
- Jesus fucking shit!
Who the fuck is that?

766
00:55:36,002 --> 00:55:38,305
- That's Father Robert Flynn.

767
00:55:38,439 --> 00:55:41,308
I called him last night
and I left him a message.

768
00:55:41,442 --> 00:55:43,444
And he called me back
a few minutes ago.

769
00:55:43,577 --> 00:55:46,347
- Jesus, what the fuck did you
get me into, Father?

770
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,449
- He was trying to tell me
something, right.

771
00:55:48,582 --> 00:55:50,818
But he was rambling,
it wasn't making any sense.

772
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,654
Something about a plan,
said someone was after him.

773
00:55:53,787 --> 00:55:55,322
He was terrified.

774
00:55:55,456 --> 00:55:59,093
- This is some crazy shit,
Father. Did you call the cops?

775
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:02,129
- Not exactly

776
00:56:02,262 --> 00:56:04,064
- What does this mean?

777
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:07,167
- Look, I need your help
figuring out what is going on.

778
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:09,670
- No! No, dude, you need to call
the cops. Now!

779
00:56:09,803 --> 00:56:11,038
If I call the cops

780
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:12,673
now we'll never get access
to what he knew,

781
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:14,074
and the police
will want to know

782
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,476
why was I talking
to him at the first place.

783
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:16,744
How did I get his number.

784
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:18,145
Do you see where
I'm going with that?

785
00:56:21,815 --> 00:56:26,520
- This is fucked up shit,
Father. Excuse my Latin.

786
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:30,290
- Look, all of our computers are
connected right now, right?

787
00:56:30,424 --> 00:56:32,025
Can't you just go in there

788
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:34,795
and copy his hard drive
or something?

789
00:56:34,927 --> 00:56:36,797
He was scared enough
to kill himself,

790
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:38,132
he had to know something.

791
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:39,266
We have to figure
out what it was.

792
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,702
- No. We definitely don't.

793
00:56:41,835 --> 00:56:45,105
- Look, I know you don't wanna
be involved in this,

794
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:47,940
but you are, okay?

795
00:56:48,075 --> 00:56:51,745
And I can't do this alone.
Please.

796
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:54,381
I'm gonna share my screen
with you.

797
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:57,351
- Fine. Whatever.

798
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:03,791
- Oh, is this gonna
leave a trace?

799
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:06,926
Don't worry, I'm gonna delete
any trace of this being here.

800
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,262
All right. Count to three.

801
00:57:08,395 --> 00:57:09,496
- Why?

802
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,963
- Just do it.

803
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:13,534
- One, two, three

804
00:57:17,704 --> 00:57:20,174
- Whoa

805
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:25,345
- You know, this is really
messed up.

806
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:34,221
Right, I'm in his hard drive

807
00:57:34,354 --> 00:57:37,324
and I'm erasing you
from his call log.

808
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:41,161
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it. Literally.

809
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:47,835
Done.

810
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:50,237
- Okay, let's go
through the drive.

811
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,505
- No, Father, definitely not.

812
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:53,440
I'm gonna go through
his drive myself

813
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:54,708
and I'll let you know
if I find anything.

814
00:57:54,842 --> 00:57:56,810
- What? No, that's not what.

815
00:57:56,944 --> 00:57:58,445
I'm not arguing with you.

816
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:01,281
I work better without someone
looking over my shoulder.

817
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:03,317
There is something
and I will find it.

818
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,786
But what you'll be looking for?

819
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:08,689
- Trust me. I'm a cherub.

820
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:12,192
It's my job to find things
people don't want to be found.

821
00:58:12,326 --> 00:58:14,394
- Fine. How long
is it gonna take?

822
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:17,431
- Take a pill.
I'll let you know.

823
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,938
- Hey

824
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:33,674
- Jesus, were you in a fight?

825
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:35,842
No, I haven't been
sleeping very well.

826
00:59:35,976 --> 00:59:37,210
What'd you find?

827
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:41,481
- I didn't find anything.

828
00:59:41,615 --> 00:59:42,950
- What?

829
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,651
That's impossible.

830
00:59:44,785 --> 00:59:47,988
Did you check everything?
Emails?

831
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:49,456
Did you check everywhere
on the computer?

832
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,191
Hidden directories? Chats?

833
00:59:52,192 --> 00:59:53,727
- I checked everything,
Father.

834
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,463
I went through his drive.
Twice. It's clean.

835
00:59:56,597 --> 00:59:58,732
There is not a single suspicious
file or folder on it...

836
00:59:58,865 --> 01:00:01,301
- Do it again, check the cloud
or something, I don't know.

837
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:02,669
- I checked everything.

838
01:00:02,803 --> 01:00:04,271
I even hacked into Bishop
Hill's drive.

839
01:00:04,404 --> 01:00:06,206
There is nothing there.

840
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,741
There are no conspiracies,
no cover-ups.

841
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:10,544
These are the most boring drives
I've ever hacked.

842
01:00:10,677 --> 01:00:15,349
This whole thing, dude,
is a dead end.

843
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:19,886
Are you okay?
You look kinda hungover.

844
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,990
- I'm not.

845
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:25,059
- You can't lie to
a cherub, Father.

846
01:00:25,225 --> 01:00:28,562
- Father Flynn, he wouldn't just
kill himself like that, right?

847
01:00:28,695 --> 01:00:31,732
He specifically called me.
It was

848
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:33,834
He was trying
to tell me something.

849
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:35,669
He was making a statement.

850
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:37,704
- Maybe he felt guilty
about what happened

851
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:38,705
to his Parishioner.

852
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:40,507
I don't know...

853
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:42,776
Sometimes people snap
for no reason.

854
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:46,513
It's a good thing that
we didn't find anything, right?

855
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,416
Because that means there is
nothing to worry about.

856
01:00:54,521 --> 01:00:58,458
- Look, Father.
I did some reading on you.

857
01:01:01,561 --> 01:01:04,665
You forgot to mention that your
son is Nicholas Martin.

858
01:01:05,899 --> 01:01:07,300
- What's your point?

859
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:08,869
- My point is,

860
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:13,707
I get why you're so sensitive
about this RP stuff.

861
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,477
I can't even imagine
what you've been through.

862
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:21,882
But dude, getting wasted
isn't helping.

863
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:24,384
- You don't know what you're
talking about, right?

864
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:26,553
I don't know if you're doing
this to punish yourself

865
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:27,988
because of what happened
to your son,

866
01:01:28,122 --> 01:01:30,557
or if you're one of those
regular old drunks,

867
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:33,493
but you need
to put the bottle down.

868
01:01:33,627 --> 01:01:35,962
It's messing with your head.

869
01:01:36,097 --> 01:01:38,498
- I didn't imagine any of this!

870
01:01:38,632 --> 01:01:42,235
- I know. You didn't.
Shit happens.

871
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:43,603
- Dude, the world
is a crazy place

872
01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:45,839
but that's why people
need the Church.

873
01:01:45,972 --> 01:01:48,042
To help make sense
out of all of it.

874
01:01:48,176 --> 01:01:50,877
You have an eccentric priest
who commits suicide.

875
01:01:51,012 --> 01:01:52,713
You have someone
that you're counseling

876
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:54,848
and they do something terrible.

877
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:58,385
That's just life on Earth.

878
01:01:58,518 --> 01:02:00,554
It's messy.

879
01:02:08,995 --> 01:02:11,398
- You know, I still think we
should've called the cops.

880
01:02:11,531 --> 01:02:14,634
But I guess it's too late
for that now.

881
01:02:14,768 --> 01:02:17,038
And I'm serious about the booze.

882
01:02:17,171 --> 01:02:18,939
- Thank you.

883
01:02:19,073 --> 01:02:21,241
- I'm supposed to report
on stuff like this.

884
01:02:21,374 --> 01:02:23,310
But I'm gonna let it side

885
01:02:23,443 --> 01:02:26,613
because of what
you've been through.

886
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:32,053
But you've got a problem,
I know the signs.

887
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:34,855
You don't want to dig
yourself into a hole

888
01:02:34,988 --> 01:02:36,857
you can't get out of.

889
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,794
- Yeah, well, you and I both
know a priest has to do

890
01:02:40,927 --> 01:02:44,631
something really bad
not to get resurrected.

891
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:48,368
- Maybe it's this life you
should be worried about.

892
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,875
Look, I gotta go.

893
01:02:55,009 --> 01:02:59,913
But I am here if you need
to talk to somebody, okay?

894
01:03:00,047 --> 01:03:09,289
- Yeah.
And, Rat, just...thank you.

895
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,795
- Don't mention it.

896
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:19,066
I guess you can't this time.
Whatever. Bye.

897
01:03:28,408 --> 01:03:30,443
Hi, Stan, um

898
01:03:30,577 --> 01:03:35,183
Listen, I've been
thinking over and well,

899
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:39,220
I figured maybe you wanna come
here on Easter Sunday.

900
01:03:39,352 --> 01:03:42,023
Maybe you could give
the Blessing.

901
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:45,592
I know Nicky would be really
thrilled to see you, so um

902
01:03:45,725 --> 01:03:47,128
Yeah, I just wanna let you know

903
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:49,163
that you are more than welcome
to join if you want.

904
01:03:49,297 --> 01:03:52,166
It's at 10 a.m.

905
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,836
And also I wanted to apologize
for the other day.

906
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:59,806
I know, all of this cannot be
easy for you.

907
01:04:02,076 --> 01:04:04,644
So, I didn't mean for this
message to be so long.

908
01:04:04,778 --> 01:04:07,514
Let me know if you can make it.
Bye.

909
01:05:13,014 --> 01:05:14,714
- Stan.

910
01:05:14,848 --> 01:05:16,384
- Your Excellency, good morning.

911
01:05:16,516 --> 01:05:18,551
Do you have some time for me?

912
01:05:18,685 --> 01:05:20,221
- How are we feeling
this morning?

913
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:22,522
- To be honest, I'm feeling
a little bit embarrassed

914
01:05:22,656 --> 01:05:24,358
about my behavior
the other night.

915
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:29,462
You were absolutely correct
and I hope you'll forgive me.

916
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:32,465
I'm very happy
to hear that, Stan.

917
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:34,501
And of course I forgive you.

918
01:05:34,634 --> 01:05:37,604
You're a very important member
of this Diocese.

919
01:05:37,737 --> 01:05:39,106
And I understand,

920
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,774
everybody is under
a great deal of stress,

921
01:05:40,907 --> 01:05:43,010
especially with the incident
in Pittsburgh.

922
01:05:43,144 --> 01:05:48,049
But actually, Stan, I have some
good news for you.

923
01:05:48,182 --> 01:05:49,916
- Huh?

924
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:51,851
- I just heard back
from the FBI.

925
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:53,653
They finished their
investigation

926
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:56,290
and you're cleared
to return to work.

927
01:05:56,424 --> 01:05:57,857
- Really?

928
01:05:57,991 --> 01:06:00,760
- Stan, everybody knew you had
nothing to do with this.

929
01:06:00,894 --> 01:06:03,530
- What was the determination?

930
01:06:03,663 --> 01:06:05,266
- It sounds like
Mr. Collins had

931
01:06:05,399 --> 01:06:08,601
a rather violent
criminal history

932
01:06:08,735 --> 01:06:11,671
and this was pre-Resurrection
and somehow

933
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:14,741
he managed to hide that
from the Cherubim.

934
01:06:14,874 --> 01:06:19,479
- But I thought the Cherubim
never missed anything?

935
01:06:19,612 --> 01:06:21,815
- Don't be naive, Stan.

936
01:06:21,948 --> 01:06:25,086
There are plenty of ways to hide
sinful behavior.

937
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:28,022
I mean those encrypted servers,
there is retro-tech

938
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:31,891
and that's just for the sins
people commit online.

939
01:06:32,026 --> 01:06:35,329
There is no true way
to judge a soul.

940
01:06:35,463 --> 01:06:40,234
All we can hope is to convince
them enough to behave.

941
01:06:40,368 --> 01:06:42,136
- So...

942
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:44,438
What's gonna happen
to the Cherub

943
01:06:44,571 --> 01:06:47,507
that approved Frank
for Resurrection?

944
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,578
- I'm afraid I can't
talk about that.

945
01:06:51,711 --> 01:06:53,546
- I'm sure that
they did their best.

946
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,614
Hope they won't
be disciplined.

947
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:57,550
- Stan, please, just relax.

948
01:06:57,684 --> 01:07:00,421
This is good news.
It's all good.

949
01:07:00,553 --> 01:07:01,955
And if you're up to it,

950
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:05,092
you can come back to work
as soon as you want.

951
01:07:05,226 --> 01:07:11,564
- That that would be great.
And um, Nicky?

952
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:15,036
- Nicholas?
Call him whenever you like.

953
01:07:17,971 --> 01:07:21,342
- Thank you. Thank you, Bishop.
I am indebted to you.

954
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:22,776
- You're welcome, Stan.

955
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:27,114
Now, get out there
and harvest more souls.

956
01:07:27,248 --> 01:07:28,982
- All right.

957
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:33,620
- Gotta tell you, Rose, sounds
like things are going

958
01:07:33,753 --> 01:07:35,189
really well these days?

959
01:07:35,322 --> 01:07:37,824
- Yeah. At first I was worried
he was only into me

960
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:40,094
because I'm the only other RP
in school,

961
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:43,230
but we actually have
like a lot in common.

962
01:07:43,364 --> 01:07:47,234
Plus he's popular and now all
his friends are my friends.

963
01:07:47,368 --> 01:07:49,270
You're too much!

964
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:51,571
- What about you, Father?

965
01:07:51,704 --> 01:07:54,707
Sometimes I just feel weird
talking about myself so much.

966
01:07:54,841 --> 01:07:57,677
- That's okay, that's why
I'm here. To listen.

967
01:07:57,811 --> 01:08:01,282
- I know, but I don't know
anything about you.

968
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:03,750
Do you priests have the same
kinds of problems

969
01:08:03,883 --> 01:08:05,186
as normal people?

970
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:08,289
- Oh yeah! Priests are
just normal people.

971
01:08:09,223 --> 01:08:11,758
Most of us.

972
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:14,295
Actually, I always have felt
that God takes

973
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:17,531
those truly broken souls and
makes them his priests.

974
01:08:17,664 --> 01:08:19,999
We have the most to learn.

975
01:08:20,134 --> 01:08:22,836
- That's sort of beautiful.
In a sad way.

976
01:08:24,305 --> 01:08:31,011
- You know, years ago
I hurt someone.

977
01:08:31,145 --> 01:08:34,014
In the most painful way
imaginable.

978
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:35,815
And they couldn't forgive me.

979
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:38,285
I couldn't forgive myself even
after I became a priest,

980
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:41,555
which is not how
it is supposed to work.

981
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,393
But um...recently that person
invited me back in her life

982
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,364
and it's a step
in the right direction.

983
01:08:52,366 --> 01:08:53,867
Is it TMI?

984
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,137
- No, thank you for
sharing that with me.

985
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:01,808
I think, in a way, Judgment day
is every day.

986
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:04,211
Don't you think?

987
01:09:04,345 --> 01:09:08,848
- Yeah, well, the penitent
comforting the confessor.

988
01:09:10,817 --> 01:09:13,853
- I like that.
Maybe I could be a priest.

989
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:23,264
- Okay, Rose, that's our time.

990
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:24,731
- Thank you, Father.

991
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:27,034
- It was great to see you.

992
01:09:27,168 --> 01:09:28,202
- You too.

993
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:38,412
- Hey, Chris!

994
01:09:40,713 --> 01:09:43,417
- Hello, Father!

995
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,817
- Oh, God.

996
01:09:44,951 --> 01:09:46,587
Chris, what have you done?

997
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,290
- Don't worry, Father. We have
a cleaning lady every Tuesday.

998
01:09:49,423 --> 01:09:53,227
- Chris, listen to me!
Are any of them alive?

999
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,597
If they need medical attention,
I might help

1000
01:09:56,729 --> 01:10:00,334
- Alive? None of them were ever
truly alive, Father.

1001
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:02,735
But we're changing that.

1002
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:06,307
Soon everyone will wake up and
learn what life is really about.

1003
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:10,377
- Why? Why?

1004
01:10:10,511 --> 01:10:12,613
- You don't understand, Father.

1005
01:10:12,745 --> 01:10:16,283
Once they see what we've seen,
they'll be grateful.

1006
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:19,053
They'll thank us.
You'll all thank us.

1007
01:10:19,186 --> 01:10:22,989
- Listen to me. Chris,
I'm calling the police, right?

1008
01:10:23,123 --> 01:10:24,724
You need to put the knife down.

1009
01:10:24,857 --> 01:10:29,363
- Sorry, Father. I can't do
that. I'm just getting started.

1010
01:10:31,565 --> 01:10:33,267
No, no, not again!

1011
01:10:34,301 --> 01:10:36,337
- 911, what's your emergency?

1012
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:38,539
- Hi, my name is
Father Stanley Martin.

1013
01:10:38,672 --> 01:10:40,241
A man just attacked his family.

1014
01:10:40,374 --> 01:10:42,109
I don't know if they're alive
or they're dead.

1015
01:10:42,243 --> 01:10:45,045
I think he's planning on hurting
more people, okay?

1016
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:49,516
His name is Chris Silva.
You need to... get an ambulance!

1017
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,518
- Do you have an address?

1018
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:58,025
- Okay, 30 Sherwood Avenue,
White Plains, New York.

1019
01:10:58,158 --> 01:10:59,360
- I don't place your call

1020
01:10:59,493 --> 01:11:01,262
anywhere near
that location, Sir.

1021
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:03,197
- No, I was over a video chat
with him. I'm his counselor.

1022
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,832
I could see it all
on the background.

1023
01:11:05,965 --> 01:11:08,302
There was blood everywhere,
there were

1024
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,204
You need to send them
an ambulance right now!

1025
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:13,940
- All right, Sir. Don't worry,
I'm dispatching units right now.

1026
01:11:14,074 --> 01:11:16,176
Can I get an exact

1027
01:11:34,328 --> 01:11:35,696
- Father Martin.

1028
01:11:35,828 --> 01:11:37,431
- Another one of my parishioners
just went on a killing spree.

1029
01:11:37,564 --> 01:11:38,898
- What?

1030
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:40,467
- Okay, I already called it in
to the police.

1031
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:42,369
I call you for a different
reason, right?

1032
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:44,238
I think this parishioner and
my parishioner in Pittsburgh,

1033
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:46,206
I think that they're connected.

1034
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:49,243
I think that Church might be
hiding something

1035
01:11:49,376 --> 01:11:53,213
I don't Look, Bishop Hill was...

1036
01:11:53,347 --> 01:11:55,848
- Listen, I didn't trust him
from the beginning.

1037
01:11:55,982 --> 01:11:57,251
- You didn't?

1038
01:11:57,384 --> 01:11:59,553
- No. Listen, he hasn't been
truthful with me

1039
01:11:59,687 --> 01:12:01,854
and I just knew
something wasn't right.

1040
01:12:01,988 --> 01:12:03,757
There is something
shady going on.

1041
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:05,759
- Thank God, I was afraid
no one's gonna believe me.

1042
01:12:05,925 --> 01:12:08,462
- Listen to me. Where are you
now? Are you some place safe?

1043
01:12:08,595 --> 01:12:10,064
- Yeah, I'm home.

1044
01:12:10,197 --> 01:12:12,399
- Okay, good. Stay where you are
and don't call anyone.

1045
01:12:12,533 --> 01:12:16,136
I'll make a quick phone call
and I'll be right back.

1046
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:18,672
Until I do do not talk
to anyone.

1047
01:12:32,052 --> 01:12:34,421
Shit!

1048
01:12:41,295 --> 01:12:43,097
Hey, this is Rat.
Leave a message

1049
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,765
and if I like
what you have to say

1050
01:12:44,897 --> 01:12:46,999
I'll call you back. Or not.

1051
01:12:47,134 --> 01:12:49,770
Rat, it's me.
Something happened.

1052
01:12:49,902 --> 01:12:51,505
You gotta call me.
It's urgent.

1053
01:12:51,638 --> 01:12:54,641
All right. Just I'll be there
waiting for your call, right?

1054
01:13:14,428 --> 01:13:15,662
- Hey, Dad.

1055
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:19,433
- Hey, Nicky. Is you mom here?
Gotta talk to her.

1056
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:21,034
- She is busy.

1057
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:22,669
- Well, tell her
it's really important.

1058
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:24,538
- Yeah.

1059
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:31,545
Mom, Dad wants to talk to you.
Says it's very important.

1060
01:13:34,214 --> 01:13:37,984
Sorry, but...

1061
01:13:38,118 --> 01:13:39,520
- She's escorting Bishop Hill

1062
01:13:39,653 --> 01:13:42,356
out of the house,
so she can't talk right now.

1063
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:45,958
- Oh yeah? How often is Bishop
Hill at the house?

1064
01:13:48,228 --> 01:13:51,598
- Um, he's been here
a few times. Why?

1065
01:13:51,732 --> 01:13:53,834
- You know, you can tell me
anything, right?

1066
01:13:53,966 --> 01:13:55,169
I mean anything.

1067
01:13:55,302 --> 01:13:57,538
- Yeah, of course.

1068
01:13:57,671 --> 01:14:01,375
- Tell your mom to call me
as soon as she can, right?

1069
01:14:01,508 --> 01:14:03,777
- Yeah, sure.

1070
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:07,047
But you're coming to the Easter
party tomorrow, right?

1071
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:10,784
- Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna miss
it for the world.

1072
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:12,252
- I love you, Dad.

1073
01:14:12,386 --> 01:14:15,122
- I love you too, son.

1074
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:17,391
- Bye.

1075
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:44,785
- Hey, Father.
Watch out!

1076
01:14:44,918 --> 01:14:51,625
Hey! Hey, stop it! Leave him
alone! I'm calling the cops!

1077
01:14:58,365 --> 01:15:01,702
- Hello, hi, no,
I need someone right now!

1078
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:05,339
99 Beam Street 6th floor.
She is trying to kill him.

1079
01:15:05,472 --> 01:15:06,907
Fuck!

1080
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,143
Stop! Get the fuck out of there!

1081
01:15:10,277 --> 01:15:13,146
I'm recording. You will not
get away with this.

1082
01:15:15,716 --> 01:15:18,919
Fuck off! I'm serious!

1083
01:15:21,755 --> 01:15:24,591
Leave him alone!

1084
01:15:28,495 --> 01:15:30,130
Oh, fuck!

1085
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:32,199
Oh my God!
Come on, come on!

1086
01:15:32,332 --> 01:15:36,770
Oh my God, oh my God!
I killed her.

1087
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:39,740
Why were you doing that?

1088
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,612
- Rat?

1089
01:15:45,746 --> 01:15:48,582
That's special agent Ortiz,
head of the RP Unit.

1090
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:51,019
- Dude! You just killed
an FBI agent?

1091
01:15:51,151 --> 01:15:53,820
- She didn't give me
a choice, did she?

1092
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:56,823
Right before that I called
Ortiz and told her everything.

1093
01:15:56,957 --> 01:16:00,727
Two minutes later she is in my
apartment trying to kill me.

1094
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:02,896
- She was already there.

1095
01:16:03,031 --> 01:16:05,899
- She's been outside watching
me. To see how much I know.

1096
01:16:06,034 --> 01:16:10,804
- So, this is a conspiracy
between the Church and the FBI?

1097
01:16:12,706 --> 01:16:14,474
- Shit!

1098
01:16:14,608 --> 01:16:16,610
So, I sort of maybe
called the cops

1099
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:19,446
when it looked like you were
being murdered.

1100
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,214
You may not want to be there
when they show up.

1101
01:16:21,348 --> 01:16:23,183
- It was self-defense!

1102
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:24,818
- I don't think that matters.

1103
01:16:26,486 --> 01:16:29,590
- Yeah. Yeah, point taken.

1104
01:16:33,961 --> 01:16:36,296
I will call you. As soon as I
get the chance.

1105
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,166
- Okay. Leave.

1106
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:50,277
Search the rooms.

1107
01:17:00,187 --> 01:17:01,955
Law enforcement officers
have put out

1108
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:04,558
an all-points bulletin for
Father Stanley Martin.

1109
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:07,661
Martin is wanted for questioning
in the murder of an FBI agent

1110
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:10,364
who was found dead
in his home earlier today.

1111
01:17:15,736 --> 01:17:18,839
- Oh Father, thank God.
I thought the cops got you.

1112
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:19,873
Where are you right now?

1113
01:17:20,008 --> 01:17:22,743
- I'm in an Internet café.

1114
01:17:22,876 --> 01:17:24,244
- Do they still exist?

1115
01:17:24,378 --> 01:17:26,580
- Apparently. I'm using one
of the computers,

1116
01:17:26,713 --> 01:17:29,483
I thought that the feds might be
tracking my phone.

1117
01:17:29,616 --> 01:17:31,585
- That is smart move.

1118
01:17:31,718 --> 01:17:33,420
You're everywhere on the news,

1119
01:17:33,553 --> 01:17:36,490
the cops put out a dragnet
for you. Look, check it out.

1120
01:17:36,623 --> 01:17:39,127
I did some digging on that FBI
agent and it turns out

1121
01:17:39,259 --> 01:17:42,529
she was killed on the job and
resurrected three years ago.

1122
01:17:42,663 --> 01:17:44,331
- Yeah, makes sense
that the Bureau

1123
01:17:44,464 --> 01:17:46,034
would put an RP in charge
of the RP Unit.

1124
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:48,802
- Yeah, except that when your
first parishioner went nuts,

1125
01:17:48,935 --> 01:17:50,904
she said he had history
of violence,

1126
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:53,407
which I know isn't true
because I'm the one

1127
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,442
who recommended him
for Resurrection.

1128
01:17:55,575 --> 01:17:58,146
I don't make those kinds
of mistakes.

1129
01:17:58,278 --> 01:18:01,848
- So, she's not investigating RP
crimes, she's covering them up.

1130
01:18:01,982 --> 01:18:03,583
That's why she wanted
the recordings

1131
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:05,619
of my sessions with Frank.

1132
01:18:05,752 --> 01:18:08,822
To see if he told me anything
I wasn't supposed to know.

1133
01:18:08,955 --> 01:18:10,490
- Like what?

1134
01:18:10,624 --> 01:18:13,326
- Iguess that's what we
have to figure out.

1135
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,263
- Okay well then, check this
out.

1136
01:18:16,396 --> 01:18:20,701
- I hacked into the FBI server
and I got Agent Ortiz's drive.

1137
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:23,071
I figured if anyone had
evidence about what's

1138
01:18:23,203 --> 01:18:24,337
going on it's
gotta be her.

1139
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:27,774
- You hacked the FBI?

1140
01:18:27,908 --> 01:18:29,643
- Chill, Father.
It's not that big a deal,

1141
01:18:29,776 --> 01:18:32,746
their cyber security isn't even
as good as the Church's.

1142
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:34,314
Here, take a look.

1143
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:36,416
If you click "Case files" and
then go over to "Closed cases",

1144
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:40,154
you're gonna see all the info
that Agent Ortiz had on your
RPs.

1145
01:18:40,287 --> 01:18:44,491
And all of Father Flynn's, plus
every RP she's ever
investigated ever.

1146
01:18:44,624 --> 01:18:46,460
- So if we figure out what
these RPs had in common,

1147
01:18:46,593 --> 01:18:48,628
maybe we'll figure out
what's going on.

1148
01:18:50,098 --> 01:18:52,066
What are you doing?

1149
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,567
I'm writing a script

1150
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,001
that will cross-reference
multiple documents

1151
01:18:55,136 --> 01:18:57,571
and look for identical
character sequences.

1152
01:18:59,173 --> 01:19:00,907
- Yeah, of course, you are.

1153
01:19:01,775 --> 01:19:03,211
- Jackpot!

1154
01:19:03,343 --> 01:19:04,311
- What? What you got?

1155
01:19:04,444 --> 01:19:05,912
- It's in the web histories.

1156
01:19:06,047 --> 01:19:09,950
The both RPs frequented
the same URL. A lot.

1157
01:19:10,084 --> 01:19:11,985
- Okay, what's the website?

1158
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,420
It's a dark web chat forum.

1159
01:19:13,553 --> 01:19:19,160
Um Warriors-Of-
Enlightenment-dot-RP.

1160
01:19:19,292 --> 01:19:21,895
- That's what Father Flynn was
ranting about. The Warriors.

1161
01:19:22,029 --> 01:19:23,663
That's who he said
had to be stopped.

1162
01:19:23,797 --> 01:19:25,799
- Okay. I'm gonna share
my screen with you.

1163
01:19:25,932 --> 01:19:28,102
Because you cannot log into
the dark web

1164
01:19:28,236 --> 01:19:29,036
from an internet café.

1165
01:19:29,936 --> 01:19:31,338
Okay.

1166
01:19:31,471 --> 01:19:33,573
You see it?

1167
01:19:33,707 --> 01:19:35,275
- It's password protected?

1168
01:19:35,408 --> 01:19:37,511
- Yeah, and not for long.

1169
01:19:40,248 --> 01:19:41,882
- What's wrong?

1170
01:19:42,016 --> 01:19:45,153
- Damn. These servers are more
secure than the FBI's.

1171
01:19:45,285 --> 01:19:47,487
Oh, thank you.

1172
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:50,524
- Father, are you drinking
alcohol right now?

1173
01:19:52,592 --> 01:19:54,628
- If Ortiz was protecting people

1174
01:19:54,761 --> 01:19:56,930
using this website
maybe she was a user too.

1175
01:19:57,064 --> 01:19:58,465
Can you see if
she's got her password

1176
01:19:58,598 --> 01:19:59,966
saved somewhere on her drive?

1177
01:20:00,101 --> 01:20:04,704
- Hey, Father, I'll make
a hacker out of you, yet.

1178
01:20:13,513 --> 01:20:15,515
- Got it!

1179
01:20:23,924 --> 01:20:25,725
We have waited a long time.
We have shown great discipline.

1180
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:28,962
We must resist the temptation
to begin our work prematurely

1181
01:20:34,601 --> 01:20:38,239
We found another LARPer on the
site, another Judas taken down.

1182
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:40,340
Remember, the Church is
a House of False Prophets,

1183
01:20:40,473 --> 01:20:42,043
and that House will crumble.

1184
01:20:42,176 --> 01:20:45,313
But if we are exposed we will
have failed in our crusade.

1185
01:20:45,445 --> 01:20:47,547
- What is this?

1186
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:49,449
- Well, if I know
anything about cults,

1187
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,118
it sounds like one of those.

1188
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:55,889
Am I the only one worried

1189
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:58,491
we're just going to get arrested
after Resurrection Day?

1190
01:21:01,728 --> 01:21:03,930
- Wait, scroll
to the top comment.

1191
01:21:08,902 --> 01:21:12,206
That's exactly what Chris Silva
said. That they'll be grateful.

1192
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:14,608
- Shit Check this one out.

1193
01:21:14,741 --> 01:21:16,210
Hey fellow Warriors,

1194
01:21:16,344 --> 01:21:18,079
I don't have any family
to save on Resurrection Day,

1195
01:21:18,212 --> 01:21:21,381
so I think I'll go out and save
as many souls as I can.

1196
01:21:21,514 --> 01:21:23,117
Does anyone have advice on how

1197
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:24,951
I can maximize the number of
kills, before someone stops me?

1198
01:21:25,086 --> 01:21:28,688
- This is it, Rat! They're
talking about mass murder.

1199
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:35,129
- Shit!

1200
01:21:35,263 --> 01:21:38,865
It looks like Agent Ortiz has
administrative privileges too.

1201
01:21:38,999 --> 01:21:41,868
Or had, I guess.

1202
01:21:42,002 --> 01:21:46,173
I guess. Well, I think
this comment is about you.

1203
01:21:54,215 --> 01:21:56,183
- They've been
planning this for years

1204
01:21:58,985 --> 01:22:01,022
- Shit!

1205
01:22:01,155 --> 01:22:02,555
They're hacking
data encryption programs

1206
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:04,524
and tracking people's
activity.

1207
01:22:04,658 --> 01:22:05,959
They're planning
to release everything

1208
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:08,662
anyone's ever done
on the dark web.

1209
01:22:22,676 --> 01:22:23,977
That's Matthew 3:10

1210
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:27,114
They don't want any sinners
coming back.

1211
01:22:28,316 --> 01:22:29,649
They weaponized resurrection.

1212
01:22:31,918 --> 01:22:34,621
Matthew 3.11.
It's baptism by fire.

1213
01:22:34,754 --> 01:22:37,557
- It's a mass murder flash mob.

1214
01:22:39,327 --> 01:22:40,894
- Hey, up in
the right corner, you see?

1215
01:22:41,028 --> 01:22:43,964
That little clock symbol.
Can you click on that?

1216
01:22:44,098 --> 01:22:45,166
- Yeah.

1217
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:51,238
- 4 hours until ceremony?
What ceremony?

1218
01:22:51,372 --> 01:22:55,009
- It's Easter.
It's Christ's Resurrection.

1219
01:22:55,142 --> 01:22:57,610
Nicky He's got a party
at 10 a.m.

1220
01:22:57,744 --> 01:22:59,213
I've got to know
if he's involved,

1221
01:22:59,347 --> 01:23:01,781
Can you run a global search
on the website?

1222
01:23:01,915 --> 01:23:04,151
Tell me if my son's name
is mentioned anywhere.

1223
01:23:04,285 --> 01:23:05,585
Hey, his name is Nicholas.

1224
01:23:05,719 --> 01:23:07,921
- I know who he is.

1225
01:23:08,055 --> 01:23:10,458
Nothing. He's not
listed anywhere.

1226
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:13,960
- Okay, I need to tell Audrey
to cancel the party anyway.

1227
01:23:14,095 --> 01:23:16,830
So they do know.

1228
01:23:16,963 --> 01:23:20,067
- Wait, shit! Okay, okay!
That gives me an idea

1229
01:23:34,948 --> 01:23:38,852
- Wait. Wait, hold on. Do you
think that's a good idea?

1230
01:23:38,985 --> 01:23:40,954
Shit!

1231
01:23:54,268 --> 01:23:56,170
- Wait! What if they already
know that's not true?

1232
01:23:56,303 --> 01:23:58,738
- What if it is true?
You got a better idea?

1233
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,315
Fuck it!

1234
01:24:08,449 --> 01:24:09,983
- Write something!

1235
01:24:10,117 --> 01:24:12,219
- Okay! Okay!

1236
01:24:46,653 --> 01:24:48,255
Make them stop!

1237
01:24:48,389 --> 01:24:49,789
Got you!

1238
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:51,425
I'm sorry, Father.

1239
01:24:51,559 --> 01:24:53,027
These guys are gonna be
on your ass in a few minutes.

1240
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,894
Oh yeah!

1241
01:24:55,029 --> 01:24:57,198
- Okay, what about you?

1242
01:24:57,331 --> 01:24:58,631
- My IP is encrypted.

1243
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:00,568
I'm gonna see if I can
get back into the forum.

1244
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:03,170
If I can,
I can try to get evidence

1245
01:25:03,304 --> 01:25:04,871
of what they're doing

1246
01:25:05,004 --> 01:25:06,739
and I can make an anonymous
drop to the media.

1247
01:25:06,873 --> 01:25:09,709
- Maybe they can warn the public
- No, no, no!

1248
01:25:09,843 --> 01:25:11,611
Holy fucking shit!

1249
01:25:11,744 --> 01:25:13,114
911, what's your emergency?

1250
01:25:13,247 --> 01:25:15,282
Hello, police.
I want to report

1251
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:16,716
that I saw the suspect
Stanley Martin

1252
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,452
at the Bolt Internet Café.

1253
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:20,254
441 Franklin Avenue.

1254
01:25:20,387 --> 01:25:24,058
Thanks for your report,
please name...

1255
01:25:40,207 --> 01:25:42,276
That's him!

1256
01:25:42,409 --> 01:25:43,977
Stop the car!

1257
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:45,912
Dispatching Unit Nineteen.

1258
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:06,500
Stop or I'll shoot!

1259
01:26:10,638 --> 01:26:12,373
Where did he go?

1260
01:26:12,506 --> 01:26:15,042
Let's see if we can cut him off
at the other end.

1261
01:26:45,206 --> 01:26:48,142
- Father, thank God! I've been
waiting for your call all night.

1262
01:26:48,275 --> 01:26:50,277
- I had to steal a phone.
I broke the seventh commandment

1263
01:26:50,411 --> 01:26:53,113
- I'll let it slide.
Are you okay?

1264
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:54,847
- No! Now we have
fifteen minutes.

1265
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:56,783
Did you send everything
to the media?

1266
01:26:56,916 --> 01:26:58,485
- I found a way back
into the forum.

1267
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:00,853
I'm downloading all the proof
that we need.

1268
01:27:00,987 --> 01:27:02,922
But what about your son?
Is he okay?

1269
01:27:03,057 --> 01:27:05,125
- I don't know yet.
I just got here.

1270
01:27:05,259 --> 01:27:06,993
There are two cops
around the house.

1271
01:27:07,127 --> 01:27:08,828
I guess they're expecting me.
Anything you can do?

1272
01:27:08,962 --> 01:27:12,132
- Can you zoom in
on that number?

1273
01:27:12,266 --> 01:27:13,434
- Yeah.

1274
01:27:19,273 --> 01:27:22,476
Unit Nineteen.
Unit Nineteen.

1275
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:25,145
Suspect has been spotted four
blocks from your location.

1276
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:26,580
Please, respond.

1277
01:27:26,714 --> 01:27:29,949
Copy dispatch.
We're on it.

1278
01:27:38,459 --> 01:27:40,893
- You're brilliant!
I owe you one.

1279
01:27:41,028 --> 01:27:44,632
- You owe me so much more
than one. Good luck.

1280
01:27:44,764 --> 01:27:46,100
- Okay.

1281
01:27:46,233 --> 01:27:49,637
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1282
01:27:49,769 --> 01:27:53,374
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

1283
01:27:53,507 --> 01:27:58,112
For thine is the Kingdom,
the power, and the glory of God.

1284
01:27:58,245 --> 01:28:01,282
Forever and ever. Amen.

1285
01:28:01,415 --> 01:28:03,284
Amen!

1286
01:28:03,417 --> 01:28:06,320
Now, as we recite
the Rite of Peace,

1287
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:08,455
we'll prepare
for the Eucharist.

1288
01:28:10,957 --> 01:28:15,362
This is the body
and the blood of Christ.

1289
01:28:20,867 --> 01:28:22,503
Through Him, with Him,
in the Unity of the Holy Spirit,

1290
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:23,604
all glory and honor

1291
01:28:23,737 --> 01:28:27,141
- Hey, I need to talk to you.

1292
01:28:27,274 --> 01:28:28,908
- Dad! You missed the

1293
01:28:29,043 --> 01:28:30,977
- Shush, listen!
The Warriors of Enlightenment,

1294
01:28:31,111 --> 01:28:32,845
have you ever heard of them?

1295
01:28:32,979 --> 01:28:34,248
- Dad, take the Eucharist

1296
01:28:34,381 --> 01:28:36,150
and then we will be
all caught up, okay?

1297
01:28:36,283 --> 01:28:38,085
- Did Bishop ever tell you about
the Warriors of Enlightenment?

1298
01:28:38,218 --> 01:28:39,620
You need to tell me.

1299
01:28:39,753 --> 01:28:43,223
- It is about wonderment,
not warriors, come on!

1300
01:28:43,357 --> 01:28:46,126
- Please, tell me.
I need you to focus.

1301
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,362
Stan!

1302
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:49,996
What are you doing here?
The police are

1303
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:51,565
You stay away from my family!

1304
01:28:51,699 --> 01:28:53,233
Father Martin!

1305
01:28:53,367 --> 01:28:55,469
The police are out front waiting
for you. How did you get in?

1306
01:28:55,602 --> 01:28:57,404
- Audrey, please.

1307
01:28:57,538 --> 01:28:59,906
No, no, no! Stop!

1308
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:05,279
- You smell like beer. Have
you... have you been drinking?

1309
01:29:05,412 --> 01:29:08,649
- This isn't about drinking.
It wasn't about drinking then,

1310
01:29:08,782 --> 01:29:10,250
and it's not about drinking now!

1311
01:29:10,384 --> 01:29:13,087
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't listen to me

1312
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,222
- I have tried!

1313
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:18,058
- Please! You're in danger!

1314
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:21,195
- We are in danger from you!

1315
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:25,532
We are in this position
because of you!

1316
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:27,601
Goddamn it!

1317
01:29:27,735 --> 01:29:31,105
Look at yourself! Look at how
you're scaring your son!

1318
01:29:33,607 --> 01:29:36,909
I want you out of my house,
Stan. Go.

1319
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:38,545
- Mom, Dad, stop fighting,
please!

1320
01:29:38,679 --> 01:29:42,416
I want you
out of my house, now!

1321
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:46,553
- You don't understand, right?
I just need to make sure that

1322
01:29:46,687 --> 01:29:49,956
- That we're safe?
Yes, we are safe!

1323
01:29:51,325 --> 01:29:53,360
Get out!

1324
01:29:56,797 --> 01:29:58,298
I just sent out all the data.

1325
01:29:58,432 --> 01:30:00,834
Hopefully, they'll start warning
the public within an hour.

1326
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:02,369
Did you make it?

1327
01:30:05,339 --> 01:30:08,609
- Um Yeah, they're fine.

1328
01:30:10,144 --> 01:30:11,845
- What was that?

1329
01:30:11,978 --> 01:30:15,482
- Listen to me. Sounds like
gunfire. Let me check it out.

1330
01:30:15,616 --> 01:30:16,784
- Please, be careful.

1331
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:18,218
- Yeah.

1332
01:30:25,426 --> 01:30:27,494
Run, run!

1333
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:38,938
Don't move.

1334
01:30:41,141 --> 01:30:43,544
Honey, please!

1335
01:30:45,813 --> 01:30:48,115
Goddamn it, Father Martin!

1336
01:31:15,509 --> 01:31:18,345
- Father, father, administer
last Rites, please!

1337
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:22,049
- No, you're not going to die!

1338
01:31:22,182 --> 01:31:23,983
- Please, Father!

1339
01:31:24,117 --> 01:31:26,153
- Stop!

1340
01:31:32,893 --> 01:31:35,095
God bless you, girl.

1341
01:31:51,078 --> 01:31:52,679
- Nicky?

1342
01:31:52,813 --> 01:31:54,448
- Hey, Dad.

1343
01:31:54,581 --> 01:31:57,951
- No! Oh my God! Don't move,
I'm coming! I'm coming for you!

1344
01:31:58,085 --> 01:32:01,555
- It's all right!
They will be back.

1345
01:32:01,688 --> 01:32:04,858
At least the righteous,
and they'll be grateful.

1346
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:08,562
Nicky, you did this? You're one
of them Hold on, the Eucharist

1347
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:12,733
- The body of Christ, Dad.
What better way to go.

1348
01:32:12,866 --> 01:32:16,169
And the righteous will be reborn
like Jesus was.

1349
01:32:16,303 --> 01:32:18,639
- Why did you do this?

1350
01:32:21,074 --> 01:32:24,077
Hey, it's okay, Mom.
The pain will be over soon.

1351
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:25,746
- Audrey

1352
01:32:27,714 --> 01:32:33,220
- It's okay We'll bring her
back, be a family again.

1353
01:32:33,353 --> 01:32:35,023
- It's my fault.

1354
01:32:35,155 --> 01:32:37,324
- And I forgive you.

1355
01:32:38,859 --> 01:32:41,628
- That's what Resurrection
is about. Second chances.

1356
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:48,135
Now, hurry up. I'll meet you
at the RP Center.

1357
01:32:58,046 --> 01:32:59,580
Dad?

1358
01:33:11,858 --> 01:33:14,928
Though the casualties are still
being counted, the estimated

1359
01:33:15,063 --> 01:33:16,496
body count is expected to reach

1360
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:18,865
upwards of
a half million people

1361
01:33:18,999 --> 01:33:21,602
In a statement condemning
the actions of the cult,

1362
01:33:21,735 --> 01:33:23,670
who call themselves the Warriors
of Enlightenment,

1363
01:33:23,804 --> 01:33:25,272
the Vatican announced
it will be

1364
01:33:25,405 --> 01:33:27,507
opening seven
new Resurrection Centers

1365
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:29,776
to help expedite what will be

1366
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:32,112
a long and logistically
challenging process...

1367
01:33:32,245 --> 01:33:33,647
Though it is
unclear how many

1368
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,682
of those killed
will qualify for Resurrection

1369
01:33:35,816 --> 01:33:38,285
after the data caches
of several

1370
01:33:38,418 --> 01:33:40,787
dark web encryption programs
were made public,

1371
01:33:40,921 --> 01:33:43,957
ousting countless clergy
and civilians alike,

1372
01:33:44,092 --> 01:33:47,160
and prompting worldwide calls
for more relaxed standards

1373
01:33:47,294 --> 01:33:50,864
and transparency
in resurrection protocols...

1374
01:33:50,998 --> 01:33:54,167
One of the main organizers of
the Warriors of Enlightenment

1375
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:56,970
was none other than Father
Stanley Martin,

1376
01:33:57,105 --> 01:33:59,473
wanted in connection for
the murder of an FBI agent

1377
01:33:59,606 --> 01:34:03,243
just hours before he poisoned
a house full of worshippers,

1378
01:34:03,377 --> 01:34:06,613
killing all involved
including his ex-wife.

1379
01:34:06,747 --> 01:34:10,884
His son Nicholas Martin, the
very first Resurrected Person,

1380
01:34:11,019 --> 01:34:13,553
was uninjured in the attack.

1381
01:34:13,687 --> 01:34:15,789
Nicholas Martin has been
sequestered in a location

1382
01:34:15,922 --> 01:34:19,459
inside the Vatican
out of harm's way.

1383
01:34:19,593 --> 01:34:22,696
All requests for interviews
have been denied at this time.

1384
01:34:22,829 --> 01:34:25,099
While Father Martin's crimes
disqualified him

1385
01:34:25,232 --> 01:34:26,600
from being resurrected himself,

1386
01:34:26,733 --> 01:34:28,502
more and more people
are protesting

1387
01:34:28,635 --> 01:34:29,903
against being resurrected
in general.

1388
01:34:30,038 --> 01:34:34,108
We're all sinners,
every last one of us.

1389
01:34:34,241 --> 01:34:36,044
So why are we allowing
the Church

1390
01:34:36,176 --> 01:34:37,377
to take control
of our lives?

1391
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:38,879
The Church will
do well to remember

1392
01:34:39,013 --> 01:34:40,947
that sins are meant to be
forgiven, not punished.

1393
01:34:41,082 --> 01:34:44,418
Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

1394
01:34:45,519 --> 01:34:47,421
I don't see any stones here.

1395
01:34:47,554 --> 01:34:48,989
The tragedy that
befell us on Easter

1396
01:34:49,123 --> 01:34:51,191
had nothing to do with these
people being Resurrected.

1397
01:34:51,324 --> 01:34:53,127
Not every RP was a part of this.

1398
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:57,264
This was simply a group of
misguided impressionable souls

1399
01:34:57,397 --> 01:35:00,534
who fell prey to the words
of false prophets.

1400
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:02,469
There is no reason that these
victims were disqualified

1401
01:35:02,602 --> 01:35:04,871
and were not given
the second chance.

1402
01:35:05,005 --> 01:35:07,674
to live long and healthy lives.

1403
01:35:07,808 --> 01:35:10,677
- Cardinal, Is the Church
willing to accept responsibility

1404
01:35:10,811 --> 01:35:12,412
for what resurrected people do

1405
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:14,981
with those second chances
you're giving them?

1406
01:35:17,118 --> 01:35:20,154
- The Church has taken
responsibility for sinners

1407
01:35:20,287 --> 01:35:22,056
for thousands of years.

1408
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:23,924
And we are not about stop now.

1409
01:35:24,058 --> 01:35:27,894
Admittedly, mistakes were made,
perhaps some hubris,

1410
01:35:28,029 --> 01:35:29,930
but these mistakes

1411
01:35:30,064 --> 01:35:33,867
are all part of man's
imperfection, isn't that so?

1412
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,471
We learn from out mistakes
and we strive to do better.

1413
01:35:37,604 --> 01:35:39,506
That is God's will.

1414
01:35:39,639 --> 01:35:41,575
But to deny the miracle
of Resurrection

1415
01:35:41,708 --> 01:35:45,579
simply because some people did
some bad things...

1416
01:35:45,712 --> 01:35:48,315
No, this is not God's will.

1417
01:35:48,448 --> 01:35:49,649
- But even now the Church

1418
01:35:49,783 --> 01:35:52,120
refuses to divulge
the true nature

1419
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:53,687
of what you call a miracle.

1420
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,689
How can the public trust
something

1421
01:35:55,822 --> 01:35:57,457
when they have no concept of

1422
01:35:57,591 --> 01:35:59,559
how it even works or what it is?

1423
01:35:59,693 --> 01:36:04,898
- Well, that's the point
of a miracle, isn't it?

1424
01:36:05,032 --> 01:36:06,933
You've got to have faith.
