1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,980
- Did you contact Miss Alden?
- Not yet.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,820
- Any appointments?
- Doctor Alezais at 4.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,820
He' s called three times to confirm.
He sounds like he' s over 100.

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,300
If you want to cancel,
you' ll have to do it yourself.

5
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,380
I was just boiling water for tea.

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,540
Perhaps you will join me. Come.

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,140
- I won' t take much of your time.
- Take. I am not a busy man.

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:51,340
You were bitten by a wolf
in Vermont on March 8th.

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,140
Very auspicious.

10
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,860
- Very suspicious?
- Auspicious. Very auspicious.

11
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,780
March 8th. The moon was the closest
it' s been to earth in 100 years.

12
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,340
Well... that is auspicious.

13
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,100
What I' m curious about is...

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,780
Could my symptoms be caused by
chemicals released from a wolf bite?

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,420
Something that medical science
has overlooked.

16
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,300
Among my people there is only
one explanation for your symptoms.

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,220
That you are becoming a wolf.

18
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,180
But... you don' t believe that...

19
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,780
Why not?

20
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:59,180
Remember, man has only been
out of the jungle for 25,000 years.

21
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,740
Please, sit down.

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,300
Life is mystical.
lt' s just that we are used to it.

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,180
Catholicism itself.
A religion so mystical -

24
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,980
- that even primitive tribes
can be converted to it.

25
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,060
The return after death.
Judgement Day, Heaven and Hell.

26
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,620
All so incredible and so ordinary.
But we are used to it.

27
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,900
- Honey, sugar, Sweet N'  Low?
- Anything. Honey.

28
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,420
I don' t have honey.

29
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,580
Visit a shaman.
He' ll tell you the rules.

30
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,260
I can only tell you the theory.

31
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,740
- Do you know any of the rules?
- Very few.

32
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,700
The wolf rests by day
and prowls by night.

33
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,340
But he' s always present.

34
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,820
He grows inside a man he' s entered
until the first full moon.

35
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:21,660
Then he consumes him. Killing
all but his nature and his heart.

36
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,940
Not a great prognosis.

37
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,900
Of course.
not all who are bitten change.

38
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:39,060
There must be something wild within.
An analogue of the wolf.

39
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,220
Among my people, l' m not known
for having an analogue of a wolf.

40
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:56,020
Your people are wrong. Sometimes
one doesn' t even need to be bitten.

41
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,700
Only the passion of the wolf
is enough.

42
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,380
Dr. Alezais...

43
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,020
I' d like to know...
Not that I subscribe to this...

44
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,660
Neither do I.
Only to the possibility.

45
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,620
But out of curiosity...

46
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:25,020
Is there supposed to be any way
to stop this metamorphosis?

47
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,420
Supposedly there are herbs
and rites and amulets.

48
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,300
I don' t know the rites.
I don' t have the herbs.

49
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,180
But I did find something
for you when you called.

50
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,420
This is one
of the most powerful amulets.

51
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,580
It must be worn next to the skin
and never taken off.

52
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,020
If it works, there is said to be
great pain and weakness.

53
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:05,300
The wolf struggles to emerge,
and the charm holds him at bay.

54
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:12,580
I have no idea if any of it is true,
but it' s yours.

55
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,020
It' s a gift.

56
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,980
And in return
I would like a favour from you.

57
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,820
If it' s in my power.

58
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,980
I was recently told that I am dying.

59
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:35,700
Speaking of mystical
and terrifying experiences.

60
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,620
I would like you to bite me.

61
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,340
- What?
- I would like you to bite me.

62
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,700
I can' t ask you to transform me
with your passions.

63
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,700
But I ask you to honour me
with your bite.

64
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,940
I, too, will become a demon wolf.

65
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,340
You' d rather be damned than die?

66
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,340
Damnation is not a part
of my system of beliefs.

67
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,900
The demon wolf is not evil
unless the man he' s bitten is evil.

68
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,660
And it feels good to be a wolf,
doesn' t it?

69
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,860
Power without guilt.
Love without doubt.

70
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,460
Excuse me, I just can' t.

71
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,180
I understand.

72
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,580
Keep the amulet.
If you decide to believe, -

73
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,860
- perhaps
you will give me your gift.

74
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,660
It has been a privilege.
I' ve never seen one like you.

75
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,540
- Hello?
- I' ve been trying to call...

76
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,340
Don' t hang up.
Let me explain.

77
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,100
I' m not a fan of men
who mysteriously disappear.

78
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,500
I had an accident.
I sleepwalked last night.

79
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,780
I hit my head. I drove
to the doctor' s at 6 o' clock.

80
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,020
But you didn' t come and tell me?

81
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,580
No, it was 6 o' clock in the morning
and I had a scalp wound.

82
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,900
I didn' t want you
to take care of me again.

83
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,740
Finish drying yourself.
The towel' s driving me crazy.

84
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,580
Can you hear that?

85
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,260
Yes, it' s one of my new gifts.

86
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,740
Laura, please... can I see you?

87
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,260
Can we have dinner tomorrow?.
I' m at the Mayflower.

88
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,140
Laura?

89
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,380
I' ll be there tomorrow at six.
You' d better look like you fell.

90
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,460
I do!
Room 825. What did you...

91
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,740
... make me for breakfast?

92
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,180
I' m not only the president
of the Hair Club for Men. -

93
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,980
- I' m also a member.

94
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,340
Hold it right there.

95
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,820
Put your hands on the cage.
Spread your legs.

96
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,300
He' s clean.
Put your hands behind your back.

97
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,900
- Did you see that?
- He got my cuffs.

98
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,420
- Wait up!
- Have you got any money?

99
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,540
- Loan us some money.
- All of you?

100
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,540
Yeah...

101
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:50,740
I' ve got about $1,000 in my wallet.
How much would you like to borrow?

102
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,260
Give me the wallet.

103
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,260
Morning, this is Alice
with your 8 o' clock wake up.

104
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,740
You must have been bad last night
I' ve been ringing you forever.

105
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,380
As a matter of fact, Alice,
I was a very good boy last night.

106
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,500
I went to bed...

107
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,460
... so early,
I don' t even remember.

108
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,940
- Big boys here yet?
- Conference room. Deal in hand.

109
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,100
Don' t even pretend
to have any doubts.

110
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,020
It' s a pleasure
doing business with you, sir.

111
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,660
Will... I talked to Mr. Alden
about your consultant position.

112
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,740
It' s less pay of course,
but so is Eastern Europe.

113
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,900
Thanks, but I' ve had a better offer.

114
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,420
- Really? What house?
- This one.

115
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,660
- I don' t understand...
- I did the same thing you did.

116
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,900
I nagged Alden
until he gave me your job.

117
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,380
- When? I don' t understand.
- In my spare time.

118
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,860
I guess I owe you
some congratulations.

119
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,100
I guess the best man won.

120
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,180
I' m glad in a way.
I couldn' t have given it up.

121
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,340
And I didn' t like the way I got it.

122
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,580
I hope we can work together
without rancour.

123
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,180
You' re fired. Stewart.

124
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,340
Don' t, Will. lt' ll ruin me.

125
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,660
I know, but it' s best for the firm.

126
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,460
Give me a few months.
Let me say I quit.

127
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,940
No.
It wouldn' t be best for the firm.

128
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,420
You vindictive son of a bitch!
The best thing for the firm is me.

129
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,740
I' m the best thing this firm has,
and you fucking know it!

130
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,540
- Are you crazy?
- No.

131
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,500
I' m just marking my territory,
and you got in the way.

132
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,580
Nice.

133
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,980
Real nice.

134
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,460
- Suede shoes.
- Asparagus.

135
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,420
Will...

136
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,860
Please, can I talk to you
for a moment?

137
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,220
A moment of your time for 16 years.
That' s pretty cheap.

138
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:59,340
- What do you want?
- I want to come back.

139
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,660
I have no excuse. I deserve
anything you do to me.

140
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,540
I' m just begging you to be kind.

141
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,700
Has Stewart become unlovable
now that he' s out of my job?

142
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,140
I never loved Stewart.

143
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,540
It was a mistake. Will.
I' m going to talk to him.

144
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,940
Stewart never for one moment
meant anything to me.

145
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,780
And you think that makes it better?
You betrayed me with a man -

146
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,260
- that meant nothing to you?
You betrayed me for nothing.

147
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,380
- Don' t be so smug.
- Don' t touch me.

148
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,140
Keep away.

149
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,420
Hi, I thought I' d just come on up.

150
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,780
Have you been waiting for me?

151
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,220
I can' t see you.

152
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,660
Open the door.
You can' t do this to me twice.

153
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,980
Open it!

154
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,060
I wonder
if you could do me a favour...

155
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,700
- Please go.
- Why? What happened?

156
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,820
What have you done?
Where did you get those?

157
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,940
I want you to go.

158
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,300
No.

159
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:56,300
- Tell me why you' ve done this.
- lt' s getting late.

160
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,900
I think I' m dangerous,
especially at night.

161
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:09,300
You' re afraid that
when it gets dark, you' ll attack me?

162
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,220
Yeah.

163
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,620
I think I' m turning into...
something else.

164
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,660
Into the thing that bit you?
Into the wolf?

165
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:35,380
- Tell me where the key is.
- I don' t have a key.

166
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,540
I don' t even know
where l got the handcuffs.

167
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,180
You don' t have a key?

168
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,940
What was your plan? To sit chained
to the radiator until you grew paws?

169
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:57,540
God... you almost make this seem
like it isn' t happening.

170
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,460
I don' t have a plan.

171
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,940
I didn' t think past
not hurting anyone.

172
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:15,220
- I don' t think I can open these.
- You don' t know about me.

173
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,220
When you' re a druggie
and a delinquent, -

174
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:26,220
- and you want to get Daddy,
you get arrested.

175
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,140
You come into contact with
the criminal element of society.

176
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,780
You pick up shit you think
you' re never going to need.

177
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,540
Then one day you meet a guy
who chains himself to the radiator.

178
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,140
Why do you want
any of this nightmare?

179
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,780
You mean instead of the gaiety
of my normal life?

180
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,780
I don' t know.
Because I like you.

181
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:12,820
Because you' re a good man.
And that' s very exotic to me.

182
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,540
I never thought I' d meet a good man
who looked at me the way you do.

183
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,340
- You don' t know I' m a good man.
- Yes. I do.

184
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,980
Then why is this happening?
I thought only the evil were cursed.

185
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,140
No, not at all.
I could' ve told you that.

186
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,620
The worst things
happen to the best people.

187
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,180
I almost had it.

188
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,820
You might consider -

189
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:54,460
- that you' re not cursed at all,
that you' re sick.

190
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,540
There are brain tumours
that can cause all of your symptoms.

191
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,860
Tumours? What are you saying?
Are you serious?

192
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,140
- Yeah.
- God, if only that could be true.

193
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,140
How we lower our sights.

194
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,300
I say we get you examined
for physical causes, -

195
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,020
- before we take for granted
that you' re becoming...

196
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,860
There we go. On your feet.

197
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,420
Let' s get you re-handcuffed.

198
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,900
- Maybe it isn' t necessary.
- Hands behind your back.

199
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,180
There.
You seem pretty helpless now.

200
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,740
- Yes.
- Great.

201
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,100
Interesting. What is it?

202
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,500
- It' s a good luck charm.
- Really?

203
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,740
Does it work?

204
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,580
Well.
today isn' t turning out too bad.

205
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,140
- Laura...
- Yes?

206
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,340
Nothing... not a thing.

207
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,900
- Who is it?
- Police.

208
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,580
Detective Sergeant Bridger, NYPD.

209
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,300
- Is William Randall here?
- Why? What' s wrong?

210
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,060
- I' d rather tell Mr. Randall.
- He' s in the shower.

211
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,140
Is it okay if I come in and wait?

212
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,620
There' s... some kind of a problem.

213
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,940
I understand. I' m Will Randall.

214
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,980
I' m renting the apartment.
About the noise last night...

215
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,500
He' s not the hotel manager.
He' s a police detective.

216
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,700
Could we talk in private?

217
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,780
That won' t be necessary.
This is Miss Smith, my fiancee.

218
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,500
She can hear anything
that you have to say.

219
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,660
Your wife
was found dead this morning.

220
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,820
I' m sorry.
She was murdered last night.

221
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,140
Her body was found in the park.

222
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,740
- How was she killed?
- Her throat was torn out.

223
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,740
- Sit down.
- No... I want to stand up.

224
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,140
Would you mind telling me
when you saw your wife last?

225
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:13,460
Last night, here in the lobby.

226
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,460
- About six.
- Did you argue?

227
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,980
- Don' t answer anything else, Will.
- I' m trying to get the facts.

228
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,820
The clerk said
Mr. Randall and his wife had argued.

229
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:35,100
So you already know they argued.
These are not straight questions.

230
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,740
Could I ask about Mr. Randall' s
whereabouts last night?

231
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,140
Mr. Randall was with me last night.

232
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,300
I arrived at 6:30 and didn' t leave.
Check that with the desk.

233
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,140
I will.

234
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:01,100
We' ve taken some blood and tissue
samples from your... the victim.

235
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:07,140
It would really help if you
would submit some samples...

236
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:13,420
- Not without a court order.
- Just a request.

237
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:26,660
Here' s my number.
In case you want to reach me.

238
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,820
I' d like you to come down
to the station and give a statement.

239
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,980
- Both of you.
- All right.

240
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,460
Thank you for your cooperation.

241
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,660
He' s got an alibi.
The girl says she was with him.

242
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:02,460
- Airtight?
- It depends on who the girl is.

243
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:10,580
Charlotte Randall was wife of the
senior editor of MacLeish House, -

244
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,900
- recently purchased
by Raymond Alden.

245
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,020
Police have no suspects in custody
at this time.

246
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,540
- My God!
- I hope they don' t go after Will.

247
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,220
Why should they?

248
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,020
He' s the husband
and they were separated.

249
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,100
It wouldn' t be great for the stock.

250
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,020
It could be a bonanza for the stock.
The heat, the gossip.

251
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,340
- That' s what publishing' s about.
- Well, you handle it.

252
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,900
You' re back in marketing.

253
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,300
Thank you, sir.

254
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,300
If they do go after Will, -

255
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,980
- and I hope that they don' t,
I' d like to bid again for the job.

256
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,300
Randall has the right
to name his own replacement.

257
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,300
He' s named Roy Macallister.

258
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,500
I see.

259
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,860
Would that contract hold
if Will was arrested?

260
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:23,820
Yes, unless he' s convicted. You' ll
have to keep your fingers crossed.

261
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,820
- I didn' t mean...
- Really? What did you mean?

262
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,300
I hope to God Will is innocent.

263
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,820
And if he is. screw the job.

264
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,820
But if he' s guilty...
screw Roy Macallister.

265
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,940
It' s not much farther now.

266
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,780
- What if I killed her?
- What if you killed her?

267
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:08,660
Are you the guy I spent the night
with? You look so much like him.

268
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,380
I could have gone out
after you fell asleep.

269
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,460
Why does it always
have to be the worst news?

270
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,580
The worst pain?
The worst defeat?

271
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:26,180
- Because... what if it is?
- It' s not!

272
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,140
It' s not.

273
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,020
They' ve left the hotel.
The night clerk identified the girl.

274
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,660
She' s Laura Alden.
How' s that for an alibi?

275
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,300
- Where are we?
- We' re almost home.

276
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,580
Jesus! Where did the day go?

277
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,060
You' d better duck down.

278
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,140
- Hi. Miss Alden.
- Hi, George.

279
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,740
Stay down.

280
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,780
Hi. Tom.

281
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,700
Be careful of the woods.
There are some wild dogs.

282
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:18,580
- What do you mean?
- We found a deer they killed.

283
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,380
Thanks. I' ll be careful.
Goodnight.

284
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,820
I want you to lock me up
before it gets dark.

285
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,500
- Then what?
- Then maybe it won' t happen.

286
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,660
I don' t know where else to put you
but the barn.

287
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:58,060
- Everything else has windows.
- The barn sounds good.

288
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,140
The barn sounds great.

289
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,060
I' m gonna beat this, Laura.
I' m gonna beat this.

290
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,220
Your phone is ringing.

291
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,940
- How do you know?
- I can hear it.

292
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,060
I' ll be right back.

293
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,500
- Hello?
- Laura Alden?

294
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,580
- This is Detective Bridger.
- I know who you are.

295
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,140
- And we now know who you are.
- How long have you been ringing?

296
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,580
About two minutes, but l' ve been
trying to reach you all day.

297
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,060
Tomorrow you' ll give me
the statement I asked for.

298
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:58,380
All right. Do you still want blood
and tissue samples from Mr. Randall?

299
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,780
They' d be useless.

300
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,620
We' ve messed up the samples
we took from the body.

301
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,940
What happened?

302
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,940
There was canine DNA
in all the tissue samples.

303
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:23,220
The victim could have been mauled
after she was killed.

304
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:30,100
Or maybe one of the lab assistants
had been petting her dog.

305
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,060
You scared me.

306
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,740
You were right.
The phone was ringing.

307
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,100
It was that detective. Bridger.

308
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:25,580
He traced me and now
he' s threatening to subpoena me -

309
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,900
- if I don' t give him
a statement tonight.

310
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,060
Will you be all right if I go in?

311
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,340
Yes.

312
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,780
Don' t look so scared.

313
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:49,740
Maybe there' s happy endings even for
people who don' t believe in them.

314
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,220
I want you to know something.

315
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,340
I' ve never loved anybody this way.

316
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,580
I' ve never looked at a woman
and thought:

317
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:11,700
If the world ends, I' ll still
understand what God meant -

318
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,100
- if I' m with her.

319
00:40:54,060 --> 00:41:00,980
Laura Alden' s coming in tonight.
It sounds like she' s been crying.

320
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,300
I just got a call from
Randall' s best friend.

321
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,020
- He wants to see me tonight.
- We' ve got a busy night.

322
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:14,060
The the family of a kid who got
his fingers torn off is out there.

323
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,580
- What is there about a full moon?
- More light.

324
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:21,500
If a rich, white boy had his fingers
torn off, they' d do something.

325
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,900
- Laura Alden for Mr. Bridger.
- He' s running behind.

326
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,500
- Miss Alden, take my seat.
- No.

327
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,940
- Please.
- No. I want to stand.

328
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:44,620
You don' t know me. Stewart Swinton.
I' m a friend of Will Randall' s.

329
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,740
I know who he is...
Well, I know his name.

330
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:57,780
This is a terrible thing.
I' m in shock over it.

331
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,780
Will was more than a friend,
he was my mentor.

332
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,340
- And you were his protege?
- Yes. a better word.

333
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,900
It' s a true pleasure.

334
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,300
A very interesting scent you have.

335
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,780
At once new, and familiar.
Very familiar.

336
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,780
Thank you.

337
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,660
- Were you bitten?
- What?

338
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:39,220
What a very odd question.

339
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,380
What made you ask such a question?

340
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:49,420
I don' t know... When people
are bitten,  it' s often on the hand.

341
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,740
Why are you here?

342
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:59,820
They want some information
about the publishing house.

343
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,300
Stewart Swinton!
Come on in.

344
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,740
Will you have a drink with me?
I' ll tell you all about Will.

345
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,900
Thank you, that' s very sweet.
I' d love to.

346
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,380
Wonderful.

347
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:32,620
- Don' t break our date now.
- I won' t.

348
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:50,060
This is not easy. Will Randall
was a very dear friend of mine.

349
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:55,460
I' m not proud of what
I' m going to say.

350
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:02,020
Charlotte Randall and I...

351
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,500
This is hard.

352
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:14,540
Charlotte Randall and I were
having an affair. It just happened.

353
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,340
And Will found out.

354
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,060
- Yes.
- Will there be anyone else?

355
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,900
There will only be the two of us.

356
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,660
I' ll be flying with a sick friend.

357
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:42,300
Could you please have it
as near the gate as possible?

358
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,820
In about an hour.

359
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:19,180
He was like a madman.
He was a madman. He bit me.

360
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,260
- He urinated on my shoe.
- Urinated...

361
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,860
He told me he would kill her.
I didn' t believe him.

362
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,420
I blame myself.

363
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:39,660
If you' re gonna hang a first-degree
murder rap on Will, forget it.

364
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,860
This was true temporary insanity.

365
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,420
If Will is arrested.
I' ll testify to that in his defence.

366
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,100
I understand.

367
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,580
He' s staying at the Alden place
with Miss Alden, isn' t he?

368
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,220
- I really must find him.
- Ask her. She' s outside.

369
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,820
Laura Alden?

370
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:15,900
She' s gone. She left right after
Mr. Swinton went in.

371
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:26,500
We don' t need her.
Get a warrant for Randall.

372
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,660
Did he say
"on his shoe"  or "in his shoe" ?

373
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,340
No one gets through without a call!
No one!

374
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,220
The horses were restless tonight.

375
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:51,460
It' s all right.
Steer clear of the barn tonight.

376
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,420
- Will you tell the others?
- Yes, ma' am.

377
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,780
Can I help you?

378
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,820
- Mr. Swinton...
- I' m here to see Miss Alden.

379
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:19,980
I' m afraid I' ll have to call.
May I ask your business?

380
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,980
Pleasure.
She' d be the fuck of the decade.

381
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,820
- Back up.
- All right.

382
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,140
Excuse me!

383
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,140
- Can I help you?
- I' m here to see Miss Alden.

384
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,140
You' re not expected.

385
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,940
Really? I have a card...

386
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,380
... and an appointment. Here.

387
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:37,380
Hello. Miss Alden.
If you scream, I' ll kill you.

388
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,660
Il' ll just break your neck, okay?

389
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,620
This is a surprise.

390
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:53,220
- How did you get in?
- I smooth-talked the guard.

391
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,660
If anyone could do it...

392
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,740
Don' t play any more games.
You know, don' t you?

393
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,100
- What?
- What' s happening to me.

394
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:10,140
You' re playing games with me.
You pretended not to know Will.

395
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,740
You know what happened
to Charlotte.

396
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:20,140
All right, I do know Will and
I do know what' s happening to you.

397
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:26,460
Will told me, when I asked him
if there were any more like him.

398
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:32,780
- I' m not a fool. Laura.
- I know that.

399
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:38,260
If you find me so attractive,
how about me fucking you right now?

400
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:44,380
- How would that be?
- I' d have to try it first.

401
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,500
Hello. Will.
Locked you up, did she?

402
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:12,220
- Is my daughter all right?
- I thought she was with you.

403
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,620
Laura!

404
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:24,460
I heard gun shots.
I was afraid to come out.

405
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,900
- Are you with Randall?
- Where' s Randall?

406
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:35,140
As far as I know, he' s on his way
to Teterboro airport.

407
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:43,740
I told him I wasn' t going with him.
He hung up on me.

408
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,940
We' d like to check the cottage.

409
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:54,780
- What' s happening?
- They think Tom shot Swinton.

410
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:02,060
Laura. Tom is dead.
George, too, he was run down.

411
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,220
- With Stewart Swinton' s car.
- He was after Will.

412
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,140
At the police station,
he kept asking where Will was.

413
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,060
Laura Alden chartered a plane.

414
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:19,180
Swinton was looking for Randall.
He asked us if Randall was here.

415
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,940
When he found out that Laura Alden
was gone, he took off.

416
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:28,460
All this might not have happened, -

417
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:35,060
- but I was against Randall,
because he was after my daughter.

418
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:40,060
You were just trying to save me
from a disastrous relationship.

419
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:44,380
It would only have lasted a week.
He was too tame for me.

420
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:50,860
That' s what I thought when I saw
you together at the Mayflower.

421
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:54,740
I hope this time
you will give us a statement.

422
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:58,180
It would be my pleasure.

423
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:10,260
Could I get you
something to drink, detective?

424
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:16,100
- Another vodka-tonic?
- Another... no. thanks.

425
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,940
Let me know if you change your mind.

426
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:25,300
How did she know I' d been drinking?

427
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:30,220
I can smell it.
I can smell it a mile away.

428
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:29,100
