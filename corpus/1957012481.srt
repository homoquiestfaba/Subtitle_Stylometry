10
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,841
How did you sleep?

11
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,710
- Hah, I didn't do much of that.

12
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,413
Who's on the phone?

13
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,115
- Nobody important.

14
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,618
- Hah, mysterious caller again.

15
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,487
- Something like that.

16
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,624
- Big day today.

17
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,593
- Ah, we don't know yet.

18
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,397
- It was all over his face,
he's gonna promote you.

19
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,531
- You think so?

20
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,300
- What else could it be?

21
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,303
- Don't jinx it.

22
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,239
I guess he hasn't said anything
yet, but I do want him to.

23
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,840
- I'm so proud of you.

24
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,577
No matter what happens,

25
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:52,346
I know you're the
best on that team.

26
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,283
- Come here.

27
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:02,723
You're the best, you know that?

28
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,526
- (giggles) Yes.

29
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,703
- (laughs) You're
gonna make me late.

30
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,572
- [Girl] Oh, we don't
want that (laughs).

(text message chimes)

32
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,218
- What are you doing?

33
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,652
- I'm looking at your phone.

34
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,487
- Yeah, I can see that.

35
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,155
- Who's Gilberto?

36
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,557
- We'll talk about it later.

37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,559
- Honey, he has been
calling you nonstop.

38
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,428
- It's not important.

39
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,696
I'll see you later.

40
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,597

(funky music)

42
00:02:58,946 --> 00:02:59,713
- Hooh!

43
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:00,948
- Excuse me, pardon me.

44
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:01,882
- Hey, you scared the
shit out of me man!

45
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,584
- (laughs) What's going on man?

46
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,452
- [Man in striped
shirt] What's happening?

47
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,586
- What's up, we still
on for Wednesday?

48
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,655
- Yeah, you've already asked
me like three times man.

49
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,557
- I'm sorry bro, it's
an important game,

50
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,424
you know, I'm just
kinda excited.

51
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,692
- You got some
money on it right?

52
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,462
- Ah, I can't divulge
my information.

53
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:15,629
- [Man in striped
shirt] Yeah, you do.

54
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,298
- What's up, is
Julia coming with us?

55
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,366
- I don't know.

56
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,767
- You don't know?

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,235
- I don't know.

58
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,303
- Come on man, everybody
knows you're hooking up.

59
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,537
- I'll ask her, I'll find out.

60
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,806
- Okay, well just let
me know, all right?

61
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,574
- [Man in striped
shirt] Gotta go, man.

62
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:27,508
- All right, man.

63
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,610
Hey, corporate is sweet baby.

64
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:30,478
- [Man in striped shirt] Later!

65
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:31,445
- [Man in green
shirt] Hey, peace!

66
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,284
(funky music)

67
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,027
- Good morning, Rick.

68
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,529
- Good morning.

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,534
- Hey, how's it coming?

70
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,339
- Hey man.

71
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,673
- (mumbling) never like that.

72
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,244
- What do you think
he's going to say?

73
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,779
- Beats me.

74
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:14,588
- Well team, the results
for the month are not great.

75
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,890
But things are getting better.

76
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,059
Do you need to get
that, Mr. Escamilla?

77
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,193
- No, it can wait.

78
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,530
- Are you sure, because I
wouldn't wanna interrupt you.

79
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,299
- No, I was just about
to close on a deal.

80
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,668
- Well, in that case,
please answer it.

81
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,536
(text message chimes)

82
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,672
- No, it can wait.

83
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,907
- Mr. Escamilla here
knows just when to call

84
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,377
and not call a client back.

85
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,745
Isn't that right?

86
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,680
- Yes sir.

87
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,816
- You don't wanna
seem, too desperate.

88
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,552
Isn't that right, Mr. Escamilla?

89
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,453
- That's correct.

90
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:49,457
- (laughs) This guy
is so cool, isn't he?

91
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,592
(laughter)

92
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,529
Uhm, it is necessary
that we are going to have

93
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,865
to do some reorganizing.

94
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,602
This means we are going to
have to let some of you go.

95
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,372
It's just a sign of the times.

96
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:09,009
The good news is, we
are creating a new
management position.

97
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,879
And I will be
recommending some of you.

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,681
Meeting adjourned.

99
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,051
Come see me in my office.

100
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,328
Come in.

101
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,640
- Hello captain.

102
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,575
- Yeah right, captain.

103
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,744
- (laughs) How
about those padres?

104
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,946
- Ugh, they'll
never be the same.

105
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,882
- Oh, don't jinx 'em sir, I'm
going to the game Wednesday.

106
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:53,754
- Now remember, when I
first scouted you out of CU.

107
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:54,655
Do you remember that?

108
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,390
- Of course.

109
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,658
I mean, I was
clueless back then.

110
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,894
- I saw potential, and
I hired you on the spot.

111
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,463
- Yes sir.

112
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,931
- That was only the
second time in my career,

113
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:04,965
that I'd ever done that.

114
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,400
- Well I'm flattered sir.

115
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:08,636
- But things are changing now.

116
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,371
I can't hire that
easily anymore.

117
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,008
We have to let people go.

118
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,478
- Sir, I appreciate everything
that you've done for me

119
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,879
and my career.

120
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,581
- Son.

121
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,784
I wanna be the first
one to congratulate you.

122
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,655
- (stammering) I
thought you had to...

123
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,924
- I had to do that whole
show to keep up the morale.

124
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,160
Welcome to management.

125
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,630
- Thank you, thank you sir.

126
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:37,898
- Well, you deserve it.

127
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,567
- I won't let you down.

128
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:40,834
- I know.

129
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:45,673
(relaxing music)

130
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,174
- I'll be right back.

131
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,059
- I got it.

132
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,195
- Got what?

133
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,764
- I got the promo.

134
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:11,665
- No way.

135
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,566
- He just told me right now.

136
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,033
- No way.

137
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:13,834
- Yes he did.

138
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,704
- (gasps) Oh, come here!

139
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,641
- I told you this
would happen soon.

140
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,076
(romantic acoustic guitar music)

141
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,579
- Hmm, I love you.

142
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,582
* And a tasteful wine

143
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,789

has developed conditions

144
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,859
* Of the hurtin' kind

145

for Richard Lynn Escamilla,

146
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,133
I'm calling you from El

you give us a call
as soon as possible.

149
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,575
Once again, this is regarding
your father, thank you.

150
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,650
* 'Cause I'm down
on my cigarette

151
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:07,688
* And I don't know where I'm
going to get a new one, fine

152
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,827
* And there's a little time

153
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,831
* We don't act for
graces to the night

154
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:25,906
* So it's a little time

155
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,741
* To ease your mind

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,023
- I'm in Texas.

163
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,992
- You just got promoted and
you took a vacation already?

164
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,026
What are you, crazy?

165
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,328
- No man, something came up.

166
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,163
Family stuff, I'm sorry.

167
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,701
- You got family, hello?

168
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,168
- Yeah.

169
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,637

170
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,706
- Just a couple of days.

171
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,040
Have fun at the game.

how 'bout them El

00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:29,236
(upbeat music)

182
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,626
(text message chimes)

183
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,664
- What the fuck?

184
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:08,709
(crowd muttering)

185
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,544
- [Voiceover] Mommy!

186
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,250
- Richard Lynn?

187
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,318
- Hello.

188
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,788
- Look at you.

189
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,390
We didn't think you'd show up.

190
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,291
- No, of course.

191
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,394
- Well it's really
good to see you.

192
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,664
You look so much
like your mother.

193
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:32,065
- Thanks, is--

194
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,034
- No, he checked out.

195
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,669
- He checked out.

196
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,037
- We told him he needed to stay,

197
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,106
but he wouldn't hear it.

198
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,142
It is so good to see you.

199
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,643
- [Richard] You too.

200
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:46,446
- Bye, bye.

201
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,347
- [Richard] Bye.

202
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,285
(upbeat music)

203
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,000
- Richard Lynn.

204
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,301
- Hey what's up man?

205
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,170
- What's up bro,

206
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,772
- What are you doing here?

207
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,140
- What I'm doing here,
man, what you doing here?

208
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,441
- [Richard] It's my pops, man.

209
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,109
- Ah, he aight?

210
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,778
- Yeah, yeah, he's good, I
just had a couple of days off,

211
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,847
so, I came to visit.

212
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,982
- Ah, no shit.

213
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,784
- Yeah, when did you get out?

214
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,485
- I've been out.

215
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,288
Man I tried to get in
contact with you, but...

216
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,924
- Yeah, you know, I've
just, I've been busy man.

217
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,359
- I can see.

218
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,732
- You work here?

219
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,769
- Pft, yeah man, I'm digging it.

220
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,403
Man you should come
by the crib later on.

221
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,073
- Yeah I'll try, I'll try.

222
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,242
- What you mean try?

223
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,511
- Nah man, I'll stop
by, I'll go by, I'll go.

224
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,846
- Yeah, for sure.

225
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,381
- You still over at the uh...

226
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,717
- Projects baby, trying to get
out but you know how it is.

227
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,158
All right man, looks
like you all done here.

228
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,894
- [Richard] Thank you, you know,
you didn't have to do that.

229
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,429
- Don't worry about it,
I'ma catch you later.

230
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,498
Good seeing you.

231
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,800
- You too.

232
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,735
- Richard Lynn.

233
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,045
(sad music)

234
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:33,480
(sad music)

235
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,859
- Forget it.

236
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,863
Hi.

237
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,298
Hey uhm...

238
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,433
My name is, is my father here?

239
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:16,356
(sad music)

240
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,025
- Dad!

241
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,465
Gilberto!

242
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,170
Gilberto!

243
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,640
Dad!

244
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,943
- Oh son!

245
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,380
- [Robert] What are you doing?

246
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,515
- Ah you know, feeding the boys.

247
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,384
- [Richard] I went
to the hospital.

248
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,655
- Did you, that was
nice of you (laughs).

249
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,125
- Dad, what's going on,
you're feeding the chickens?

250
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,029
- Well come on, I'll
make some coffee.

251
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:32,665
Come on.

252
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,176
Oh there you are.

253
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,445
You done with saying hi
to the boys out there?

254
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,247
- Yeah.

255
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,149
- Hey, did you see Joey?

256
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,383
That old boy still thinks he's

257
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,086
the king of the roost
out there (laughs).

258
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,522
- What's going on?

259
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,592
- Can't we just have
a pleasant moment?

260
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,263
- You know I don't
have time for that.

261
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,699
Because I have a life
and I have a job.

262
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,436
- Well, how do you
want your coffee?

263
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,238
- I don't drink coffee.

264
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,379
- I'm dying, son.

265
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,651
The cancer came back.

266
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,656
- Why did you
leave the hospital?

267
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,392
- Well they told me
what they had to say.

268
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,627
(sad music)

269
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,464
- It's that damn place that
made you sick, isn't it?

270
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,266
- What, the bar?

271
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,101
How's that?

272
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,570
- Being around those
drunks all day.

273
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,406
- Being around friends
doesn't give you cancer.

274
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,507
- I thought you had
this thing beat.

275
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,342
- Well apparently the
cancer didn't get the news.

276
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,477
- Oh don't make stupid jokes.

277
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,678
- Well what the hell do
you want me to do instead?

278
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,447
Cry like a goddamn baby?

279
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,384
It is what it is.

280
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,552
(sighs)

281
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,423
- Hey dad, man.

282
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,458
Let's take you to California.

283
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,593
- So this is what
I need you to do,

284
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,128
I need you to take
care of the business.

285
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,562
- We could take you to L.A.

286
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,598
- For when I'm gone, make
sure everything is settled.

287
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,633
The doctors have
given me a few weeks,

288
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,601
so that gives you enough time.
- They make new advances in

289
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,169
medicine all the time.
- Decide what to do with

290
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,537
the house.
- Okay, and I have the money,

291
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,505
so I can pay for it.
- Take care of the family,

292
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,572
take care of grandma,
then I gotta teach you

293
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,074
how to run the bar.
- Dad, you're not listening

294
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:21,674
to me, we can get help, okay?

295
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,243
- (shouts) It's done!

296
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,580
Now I need you to do this!

297
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:35,388
And then you can go back
to your, so important life.

298
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,496
(sad music)

299
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,697
Good.

300
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,536
Let's take a walk.

301
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,553
We gotta make sure your
grandma is taken care of.

302
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,656
Her house is paid off, but,
I wanna set up an account

303
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,525
to take care of her
monthly expenses.

304
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,196
And I wanna set up an account
to help your cousins out

305
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,531
with school and stuff.

306
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:19,466
- Dad.

307
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,868
- And I gotta show you
how to run the bar.

308
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,536
- I'm not gonna that place.

309
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,672
- That's okay, I got
someone who can do it.

310
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,540
Someone who's working
there already.

311
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,842
You just have to
keep an eye on it.

312
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,713
- What's this?

313
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,152
- This is all gonna be yours.

314
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,155
- [Richard] What do you mean?

315
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,392
- Well, this is all ours.

316
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,427
Now it's all yours.

317
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,629
It was your mother's idea.

318
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,631
She didn't like you
traveling so far

319
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:55,402
to school, so, she
got this crazy idea

320
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,137
of building one right
next to the house.

321
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,739
- How the hell?!

322
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,642
- Yeah, we started buying
all the land around us,

323
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,512
but we never got around
to building the school.

324
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,847
First it was an
elementary school,

325
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,483
then it was a middle school,

326
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,618
and then when you
started playing football,

327
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,255
she wanted to build a football
field right over there.

328
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:16,689
- No way.

329
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:17,857
- Come on, I'll show ya.

330
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:33,573
(sad music)

331
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,517
- Dad!

332
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:50,623
Dad!

333
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,493
Dad!

334
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:10,910
Dad.

335
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,650
- Here it is.

336
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,319
- Here's what?

337
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,222
- This is for the hospital
your mother wanted to build.

338
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,459
- Hospital, why?

339
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,562
- Well it was really
more like a clinic.

340
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,269
- How am I supposed to sell
all this in a few weeks?

341
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,572
- You do what you gotta do, son.

342
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,577
I'm gonna miss that.

343
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:45,978
- What?

344
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,980
- The sunset.

345
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,019
I don't want anybody to know.

346
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:55,888
- Why?

347
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,658
- I don't want pity.

348
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,893
I got enough of that in my life.

349
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,599
Gee, sunsets in Texas are...

350
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,868
Like no other.

351
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,840
(sad music)

352
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:19,412
* When I die, I may
not go to heaven

353
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:24,817
* 'Cause I don't know
if they let cowboys in

354
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:31,358
* And if they don't
just let me go to Texas

355
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:36,863
* 'Cause Texas is as
close as I've been *

356
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:43,603
(laughter)

357
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,872
- [Group] Happy birthday!

358
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,073
- Ladies and gentlemen,

- Why?

398
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,471
- Because large corporations
need to keep track

399
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,104
of their finances.

400
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:25,738

425
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,118

but tough people do,
Freddy C told me that,

00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,590
Tough times don't last...

429
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:18,658

But tough people do,

430
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:19,992
Freddy C told me that...

431

- (rapping) And
everyday it reigns true.

432
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:22,695

Come on, we got a

I'll make you some coffee.

441
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:55,461
- I don't drink coffee.

442
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,063
- Well it's about

443
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:01,968
(relaxing acoustic guitar music)

444
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:19,686
You remember when I
used to bring you here?

445
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,153

446
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,722

It's me.

454
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,570

455
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:38,871

- Good.

457
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,641
- I heard you were in town.

458
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:47,213
- Oh Caroline here has
three beautiful daughters.

459
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,915
- Caroline, hey.

460
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:51,718
- This is Emily,
Betty and Chida.

461
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:54,053
- Chida, that's an
interesting name.

462
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:57,056
- Yeah, I didn't pick it,
their loser father did.

463
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,192
(car horn honking)

464
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,794
- Well, we gotta, we

465
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,262

Hey you know what,

472
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,007
- [Richard] No, no, you don't
have to do that, really.

473
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:15,942
- Okay.

474
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,109

475
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:17,944

Blast from the past, huh?

478
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,019
- What happened to her?

479
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:28,988
- Life.

480
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,623
- Wow.

481
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:32,759
- Yeah, she's a hard
worker that girl.

482
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,227
- I bet, she used
to be so beautiful.

483
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,730
- Oh, she's kinda
cute in her own way.

484
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,103
You know, those could've been
your three little rugrats.

485
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,605
- Ah, no (laughs).

486
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,641
- (laughs) You should've
seen your face.

487
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:51,110
Thanks for the
breakfast by the way.

488
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,745

489
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,048

00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:49,902
(laughter)

497
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:52,071
- Hey son, come here.

498
00:27:56,475 --> 00:28:00,446
This is Sofia, she's
our general manager.

(Sofia speaks Spanish)

503
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,320
- You two met already?

504
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,322
- Not really, I saw
her at your house.

505
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,758

507
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,327
(Gilberto speaks Spanish)

508
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,996
- She doesn't speak English?

509
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,830
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

510
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,766
- Yeah, she's learning.

511
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,067
Hey Sebastian!

512
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,801

513
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:22,334
Hey.

515
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:24,403

516
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,938
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

517
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:27,439
- Did you wash your hands?

518
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:28,474
- Oops.

519
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,444
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

520
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:33,545
- Ah okay.

521
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:37,183
She prefers that we speak
to the kid in Spanish.

522
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:42,321
(laughter)

523
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,157

528
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:51,998
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

529
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,465
- No, sorry.

530
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,434
Tell her that you
never taught me.

531
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,837
- Actually, you never
wanted to learn.

532
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,105
Hey Sebastian.

533
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:00,773
(Gilberto speaks Spanish)

534
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:02,909
(Gilberto speaks Spanish)

535
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,143
Richard Lynn.

536
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,377
And this is Sebastian.

537
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:06,212

538
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,246

00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:09,415
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

541
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,251
(Gilberto speaks Spanish)

542
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,553
- I'm uh, I'm gonna
take him to school,

543
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,522
and you'll be in good hands.

544
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:19,391
- You're leaving?

545
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,526
- Well, I'll be back.

546
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,527
But uh, she's gonna
show you around.

547
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,461
(Gilberto speaks Spanish)

548
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,462

00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,031

550
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,366
(Gilberto speaks Spanish)

551
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:33,172
- Okay, let's go.

552
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,207
Hop in.

553
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:36,475
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

554
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,310
- Oh funny.

555
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,812
- That's your son?

556
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:40,479
- Yep.

557
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,848
- How old is he?

558
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:42,448
- 30.

559
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,116
- Is he older than you?

560
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,953
- (laughs) Yes he is.

561
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,256
- So how are we gonna do this?

562
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,524
I don't speak Spanish.

563
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,560
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

564
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,899
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

565
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:00,566
- Slow?

566
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,868
- Si.

567
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,970
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

568
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:04,570

(Sofia speaks Spanish)

570
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,373
Okay.

571
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,841
- [Sofia] Okay.

572
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,843
- Well you know that word.

573
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:11,810
- Que?

574
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:15,514
- Okay, you already know
that word in English.

575
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,816
- Okay is Espanol.

576
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,419
- Okay is Spanish?

577
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,521
No, I don't think so.

578
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,457
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

579
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,225
- Bien.

580
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:26,993
- Bien.

581
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,060
Okay.

582
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:37,836
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

583
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:45,344
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

584
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,214
- [Richard] Okay,
all this is new?

585
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,381
- Que?

586
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:52,518
- When I was a kid, they only
had uhm, we only sold cans.

587
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,421
You know cans of beer, cans.

588
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:56,522
The...

589
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,858
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

590
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:01,560
No I mean...

591
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,295
Ah, forget it.

592
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:13,539
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

593
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:14,907
Okay...

594
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:19,511
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

595
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,056
Hmm?

596
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:35,995
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

597
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,097
Two beers?

598
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,199
- No, no, no two beers.

599
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,169
Uhm... (laughs)

600
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,303
- No two beers?

601
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:45,137
- [Sofia] No.

602
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:46,238
- Okay, no two beers.

603
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:47,006
- [Sofia] No two beers.

604
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,706
Uhm...

605
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,511
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

606
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,450
- You drink two beers
and you call somebody,

607
00:31:58,484 --> 00:31:59,351
why, I don't understand...

608
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,087
(Sofia laughs)

609
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,657
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

610
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,561
- Bottles, bottles.

611
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,030
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

612
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,066
- [Sebastian] It's
Wednesday, it's Wednesday,

613
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,702
it's Wednesday, it's Wednesday.

614
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:31,683
(sad music)

615
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,138
- [Sofia] Muy bien!

616
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,509
- Yeah, I moved the tables.

617
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,112
I rearranged the tables.

618
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,683
Did you pick those?

619
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,318
- Beautiful.

620
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:08,087
- Yes.

621
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:11,523
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

622
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:13,559
- I'll get it done.

623
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:14,593
- [Sofia] Que?

624
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,328
- (laughs) Never mind.

625
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:26,572
(TV chattering)

626
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,241
(door knocking)

627
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:30,276
- Come in.

628
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:31,543
- Mother.

629
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:37,183
(the grandmother speaks Spanish)

630
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:38,584
It's good to see you.

631
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,587
- I'm so happy you came,
(Spanish language).

632
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,522
You the know the church
ladies have been telling me

633
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,291
that you've been here for days?

634
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:46,658
- No, I just got in yesterday.

635
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,227
- Hmm, where's your father?

636
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,528
- He's at the bar.

637
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,097
- That unholy place.

638
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,098
What's this?

639
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,565
- Oh, it's dinner, for later.

640
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,700
- From whom?

641
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,768
- I think Ms. Delgado, mom,
dad just gave it to me.

642
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:58,337
- Thank you.

643
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,472
I made some flower
tortillas, you want some?

644
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:01,707
- Oh yeah.

645
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,779
- [Grandmother] These
ones came out really good.

646
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,615
- [Richard] Hmm!

647
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,320
- [Grandmother] Have
you been exercising?

648
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,421
- Yeah, why, do I look fat?

649
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:20,826
- No, no, no, you look muscular,
like you're gonna fight.

650
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,129
- No, no, no, I'm not
gonna fight grandma,

651
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,596
don't worry about that.

652
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:28,800
- So, tell me about California.

653
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,370
- [Richard] It's good,
I got a promotion.

654
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,571
(gasps)

655
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:35,407
- Congratulations.

656
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,243
Do you have a girlfriend?

657
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,177
- [Richard] Yeah.

658
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:38,744
- [Grandmother] What's her name?

659
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:39,645
- [Richard] Julia.

660
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:40,379
- [Grandmother] Julia what?

661
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,313
- Smith.

662
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:42,414
- Oh?

663
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:43,682
Is she a Catholic?

664
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,284
- No, no.

665
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,254
- Good, why didn't
she come with you?

666
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:49,588
- She's working.

667
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:52,258
- And shouldn't you
also be working?

668
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,592
- Yeah, I took a vacation.

669
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,295
- You came here,
for the vacation?

670
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:58,597
Ah, (Spanish language).

671
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,832
I'm so glad you came.

672
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:04,470
You know, nobody calls
me, nobody comes to visit.

673
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:07,239
- I'll be helping dad, so
I'll come by and visit.

674
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,375
- Ah, your father
doesn't need any help.

675
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,442
He already has a helper.

676
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:11,377
- Ah, I met her.

677
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,578
- A nice girl huh?

678
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,580
Yeah, she comes to visits me.

679
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:16,882
- She visits you?

680
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:19,385
- Yeah, Sebastian,
she brings him over.

681
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:22,788
I babysit him,
sometimes she pays me.

682
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,357
I told her she doesn't have to.

683
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:26,458
But she pays me.

684
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:27,593
- That's nice.

685
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,562
- Yeah, too bad she's Catholic.

686
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:31,597
(the grandmother speaks Spanish)

687
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,931
Your favorite.

688
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,369
Frijolitos and tortitas.

689
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:38,737
- Thank you.

690
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,710
- Hey, pray!

691
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:48,247
Don't you remember how to pray?

692
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:52,651
- You pray, grandma, please.

693
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:53,919
- Okay...

694
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,689
Heavenly father, thank
you so much for bringing

695
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,658
my grandson home.

696
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,562
Bless this food, in
the name of your son,

697
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,864
Jesus Christ, amen.

698
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,700
- Richard Lynn.

699
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:09,635
- Hello?

700
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,204
- I forgot that the
soccer match was on.

701
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:13,705
We got an unexpected rush here,

702
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,541
I need you to pick up Sebastian.

703
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,209
- Me, I can't do that!

704
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:18,610
- Why the hell not?

705
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,347
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

706
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,681
I gotta go.

707
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:26,752
- Hello?

708
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,288
What the fuck.

709
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:34,192
(funky music)

710
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,762
- [Voiceover] Okay,

711
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:46,505
Richard Lynn?

712
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,673
- [Richard] Hey Lisa!

713
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,740
- Hey, I didn't know
you were in town.

714
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:49,708
- Yeah.

715
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:50,642
- Yeah, nobody tells me
anything, I never know

716
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:51,977
what's going on.

717
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,412
Are you here to get Sebastian?

718
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,746
- I am.

719
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,981
- [Lisa] Sebastian
sweetheart, your ride is here.

720
00:37:00,486 --> 00:37:00,952
Okay, come on sweetheart.

721
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:01,920
- Come in.

722
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:02,954
- [Lisa] Can you open the door?

723
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:03,889
- Yeah.

724
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,657
- [Sebastian] Bye aunt Lisa.

725
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,626
- Bye, see you tomorrow.

726
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,862
Hey we're having a barbecue
next week for Jes' birthday,

727
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:11,697
you should come.

728
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,265
- Okay.

729
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:14,733
- Everybody's gonna be
really thrilled to see you,

730
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:15,701
I think I'm gonna have Jim
put a brisket in the oven.

731
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:16,568
- [Richard] No, no, you
don't have to do that.

732
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:17,068
- Oh yeah we do,
we'll see you then.

733
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:18,570
- [Richard] Okay.

734
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:19,438
- [Sebastian] Bye aunt Lisa.

735
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,238
- [Lisa] Bye.

736
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:35,020
- How was school?

737
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,588
- Good.

738
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,024
- You call Lisa, aunt?

739
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,859
- She's me aunt.

740
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:41,860
- Who told you that?

741
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,595
- She did.

742
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:44,896
- Is that right?

743
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,432
- Yeah.

744
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,066
Why are you here?

745
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,335
- [Richard] What do you mean?

746
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,837
- I never knew you were coming.

747
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,805
- Yeah, neither did I.

748
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,607
- You live here now?

749
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,276
- No, I'm just visiting.

750
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,745
- Why?

751
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,513
- Why what?

752
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:03,715
- Why don't you
live with your dad?

753
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,717
- Because I live someplace else.

754
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,719
- You don't like it here?

755
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:10,389
- Yeah, it's okay.

756
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,823
- I don't.

757
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,360
- [Richard] Why's that?

758
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,662
- It's boring, there's
nothing to do, no fun,

759
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:19,331
no park, no beach.

760
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,066
- [Richard] There's a beach.

761
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,434
- No way.

762
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,970
- Yeah, there's a
beach, it's not far.

763
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,905
- We used to go all the time.

764
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,340
- [Richard] You and your mom?

765
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:29,775
- And my dad.

766
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,310
I hate it here!

767
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,746
- I'll take you.

768
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,881
- [Sebastian] You will?

769
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,749
- Yeah, why not?

770
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,485
- Yes!

771
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:56,835
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

772
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:57,969
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

773
00:38:58,737 --> 00:38:59,605
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

774
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:00,606
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

775
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,507
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

776
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,408
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

777
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,675
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

778
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:04,910
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

779
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,011
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

780
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,379
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

781
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,883
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

782
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:12,784
- [Sebastian] Okay.

783
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,152
I told her about the beach.

784
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:18,924
(sad music)

785
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,599
- [Gilberto] How did it go?

786
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,601
- [Richard] It was good,
but I think she's mad at me.

787
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:30,802
- Mad, why?

788
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:33,472
- 'Cause I told the kid I was
gonna take him to the beach.

789
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:38,710
- She'll be fine, come on,
let me show you the office.

790
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,051
Hey buddy, we need to
do some work in here.

791
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,486
- Okay.

792
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:59,631
- This is no place for a kid.

793
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,800
- Huh, oh he's fine.

794
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,902
- Thought you hated computers.

795
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:04,836
- [Gilberto] Oh I used to.

796
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,037
- Good, well you know,

797
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,806
then I can get some work
done for the office.

798
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,008
- You know, Sofia insisted
that we'd get one,

799
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,644
and I gotta admit, it
makes things easier.

800
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,485
- How did you uhm,
come to hire her?

801
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:21,052
- Oh, uh...

802
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,056
She was working someplace else

803
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,660
and uh, well I stole her away.

804
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,128
- Is that right?

805
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:32,430
- Ah, she's uh...

806
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,966
She's the best thing that's
happened to the business

807
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,835
since your mother.

808
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,673
- She doesn't speak English.

809
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:43,174
- No, but she's learning.

810
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,777
And besides it doesn't matter,
she does a damn good job.

811
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,979
- Yeah and Sebastian
you know, he seems,

812
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,881
he seems very attached.

813
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:51,617
- Attached?

814
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,786
- Yeah, you take him to school.

815
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,188
- Yeah, so Sofia can open.

816
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,825
- And he calls Lisa, aunt Lisa.

817
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,693
Spends time at grandma's...

818
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:03,762
- Are you jealous, Richard Lynn?

819
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,863
- No.

820
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,566
I just don't want them
to get the wrong idea.

821
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,569
- What's the wrong idea?

822
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:13,505
- She's your
employee, not family.

823
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:16,942
- Oh-ho-ho-ho, listen here.

824
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,710
- And how did you
find these people?

825
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:20,979
You never even
told me about them.

826
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,982
- Because you never
pick up the damn phone.

827
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,216
Look.

828
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:28,620
Every time I need
something, she's here.

829
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,790
She works damn hard and
that boy, he's a good boy.

830
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:32,658
- Doesn't make him family.

831
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,593
- And you are?

832
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:36,227
I had to beg you to come here.

833
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,263
I haven't seen you in
seven years, Richard Lynn.

834
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,631
Seven years!

835
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:43,902
(sad music)

836
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:55,814
- Gilberto's son, Gilberto's
son, where are you going?

837
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,720
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

838
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,061
Where are you going?

839
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,697
- [Richard] Nowhere, I'm
going to clear my head.

840
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,699
- Can I come with
you, Gilberto's son?

841
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:14,299
- [Richard] No.

842
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,767
Ey, and my name is Rick.

843
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:17,736
- I wanna come do something fun.

844
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,805
- No, go inside with your mom.

845
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,873
- Okay...

846
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:25,343
- Hey, all right,
let's go for a walk.

847
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,279
- Okay, I'm gonna tell
my mom, wait for me!

848
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:31,717
- Yeah I'll wait for you,
I got nothing else to do.

849
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,585
(car horn honking)

850
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:38,156
(funky music)

851
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,068
- What you looking at?

852
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:51,937
- Cemetery.

853
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,843
- They're just worried,
can we go back now?

854
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,779
- Let's wait for he sunset.

855
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,113
- Okay.

856
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:08,086
Hi mom.

857
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,925
- Hola.

858
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:15,694

(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

861
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,366
- [Sofia] Sebastian.

862

(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

863

(Sofia speaks Spanish)

864
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,739
- Okay, (Spanish language).

865
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:29,741
- Come sit with us.

866
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,777

(Sofia speaks Spanish)

868
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,682
- [Sebastian] She says

869
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,251
- [Sofia] Gracias.

870
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,887
(Richard speaks Spanish)

871
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,106

873
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:04,175

(Sofia speaks Spanish)

880
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,723
- She says she
has English class.

881
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,157
- Well, what time is class?

882
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,291
- Eight.

883
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,761

(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

885
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:27,866

887
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,737
What?

Por favor!

889
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,907
What?

890
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,442
What's funny?

891
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:38,777
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

892
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,746
- Your accent is funny.

893
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:42,180
- My accent is funny?

894
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,482
(laughter)

895
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:49,420

- I'm going to get some water.

902
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:17,749
- So, where are you from?

903
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:18,616
- Huh?

904
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,186

- Venezuela.

906
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:24,890
- Venezuela.

907
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:29,060
I don't think I've ever
met anyone from Venezuela.

908
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,331
How is it there, is it uhm...

909
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,967
It's uh "bonito"?

910
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,069
- It's very beautiful.

911
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,841
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

912
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:45,043
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

913
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:47,879
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

914
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:49,414
- Thank you.

915
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:50,849
So you are from Venezuela?

916
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:51,983
- Yes.

917
00:45:52,017 --> 00:45:53,885
- Haha, how long
have you been here?

918
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,386
- I don't know.

919
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:57,155
- [Richard] Well ask your mom.

920
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,323
- One year.

921
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,958
- Good.

922
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:03,428
Why did you start
taking class now?

923
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:07,032
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

924
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,301
Well, how do you like it here?

925
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:13,238
- She doesn't, she misses
her family in Venezuela.

926
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,341
- Why did you leave?

927
00:46:18,844 --> 00:46:20,912
- Sorry, class.

928
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,481
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

929
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,482
- Okay...

930
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,485
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

931
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:28,753
- Oh, I'm sorry little boy,

932
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,620
you can't take that
slice with you.

933
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,589
It must be consumed
on the premises.

934
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,358
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

935
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,999
- Excuse me, I'm gonna have
to charge you for that.

936
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:42,233
- Okay.

937
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:05,323
- [Freddy C] So what happened?

938
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:07,625
- Nothing man, I just
had to take a walk.

939
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,461
- In the middle of the
night, are you crazy bro?

940
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:11,997
- I do that sometimes.

941
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,600
So where are we going?

942
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:17,568
- The Sunnyside,
you already know.

943
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,570
- Ah man, let's go
to Greek's, please.

944
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:22,407
- Nah man let's go to
Sunnyside, it's the spot,

945
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,608
it's karaoke tonight.

946
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:24,609
- Karaoke?

947
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:26,144
- [Freddy C] Yeah.

948
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,446
- When did they
start doing karaoke?

949
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,949
- All I know is man, they
had it when I got out.

950
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:33,885
Think the old girl started
it, what's her name, uh...

951
00:47:33,919 --> 00:47:35,053
Sofia?

952
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,621
- Yeah, what's her story
anyway, you know anything?

953
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:37,555
- Pft...

954
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,125
All I know is she was
there when I got out.

955
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:41,927
That's pretty much it.

956
00:47:42,928 --> 00:47:44,195
- Yeah but this is a small town,

957
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,197
somebody must've said something.

958
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:49,634
- Well you know, people
talk, women talk.

959
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,602
- [Richard] And

960
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:55,040

00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:59,577
she a gold digger, she

968
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,272
- Hey Freddy, what

969
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:28,673
- [Freddy C] The usual

00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:30,341

(laughter)

975
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:44,655
- You need something?

976
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:45,656
(crowd muttering)

977
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,459

- You're right, he is cute.

990
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:16,754
- [Caroline]
(giggling) I told you.

991
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,189
- So what can I get you ladies?

992
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,725
- Uhm, jello shots.

993
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,727

12 dollars.

1003
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:47,418
- You're charging me?

1004
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:49,254
- Am I not supposed to?

1005
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:50,755

1006
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:52,557

- [Richard] No hey, I'm
sorry about that, here.

1009
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,627
- [Caroline] Don't worry

1010
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:57,295
- [Richard] Here, here,

1011
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,096
Take your money.

1012
00:49:58,129 --> 00:49:59,697
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1013
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:02,300
Guess you made it.

1014
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:03,634
- Huh?

1015
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,536
- [Richard] You
came after class.

1016
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:07,004
- Que?

1017
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,707
Si, si, class, class.

1018
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,115
- Welcome out to Sunnyside.

1019
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,584
Tonight's karaoke night,

(applause)

1022
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,092
- All right, this is my
favorite part of the night.

1023
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:31,696
(funky music)

1024
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:47,412
(moves into sad music)

1025
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:52,049
(scuffling and grunting)

1026
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:08,433
(scoffs)

1027
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,573
(funky music)

1028
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:17,642
- [Richard] Hey, come on,
we don't want you here.

1029
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:20,345
- [Man] Hey, hey, hey,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

1030
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:24,282
- Hey, no stop, stop!

1031
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,185
- It's okay now.

1032
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:29,086
- Everything is fine
folks, everything is fine.

1033
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:33,424
- What?

1034
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:36,461
- That's not how
we do things here.

1035
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,363
- I can't believe after
everything that happened to mom

1036
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:40,298
you still let drunks
like that in here.

1037
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:41,566
- Hang on.

1038
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,635
Don't you tell me
how to run my bar.

1039
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:04,855
- [Richard] You okay?

1040
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:07,658
- Si.

1041
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:09,594
- That man, he was grabbing you.

1042
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,396
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1043
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:12,697
- He's your friend?

1044
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,733
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1045
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,168
He looked like he
was gonna hurt you.

1046
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:22,207
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1047
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,243
Alright look, I just, I
was trying to help you out.

1048
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:29,314
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1049
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,483
Good, hey.

1050
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,553
I didn't mean to scare you.

1051
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,288
It won't happen again.

1052
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:38,756
- Okay.

1053
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:40,625
- [Richard] Okay.

1054
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:48,165
(funky music)

1055
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:05,416
- How did you sleep?

1056
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,586
- Slept fine, when
did you start packing?

1057
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:12,457
- Yesterday, hey come sit.

1058
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,962
- It's 07:30 in
the morning, dad.

1059
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:19,397
- I know.

1060
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,534
- You've been doing
this everyday?

1061
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:26,737
- Oh, I rest on Sundays,
like the Lord said.

1062
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:28,839
- Yeah, well, that
can't be good for you.

1063
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,409
You know, hey!

1064
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:32,377
- Hmm?

1065
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,778
- You need to rest!

1066
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,581
- I'll rest when I'm dead.

1067
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:42,753
Okay.

1068
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,623
You need to take
a look at these.

1069
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:46,957
This is uh...

1070
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:50,461
This is the deed to the house.

1071
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:54,665
And uh, this is my will.

1072
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:57,502
And I'm leaving
everything to you.

1073
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:01,339
So, I need you to make sure that

1074
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:03,808
you distribute
everything to the family.

1075
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:07,312
And I told your cousins that uh,

1076
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,647
whoever wanted to,
could go to college,

1077
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,548
and I would help them.

1078
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,817
So, you need to create
a trust for that.

1079
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,785
- Which cousins?

1080
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,621
- Whoever wants to.

1081
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:17,788
- And you can afford this?

1082
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:21,792
- I should have enough, I'm
hoping one of them bites.

1083
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,664
There's documentation
on the bar, okay?

1084
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:31,001
Now, you need to take a
look at this, all right?

1085
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:34,505
- Got it.

1086
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:35,740
- All right.

1087
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:39,710
I made an appointment with
Mr. Bonilla for today.

1088
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:41,879
He's a discreet man, so...

1089
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:43,714
Thing is, you're
gonna have to go alone

1090
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:47,685
'cause, I'm not
feeling so hot today.

1091
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,721
- [Richard] You wanna
go to the doctor?

1092
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,658
- No, just go talk to him.

1093
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:56,594
- Okay, boss.

1094
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:06,404
I told you I have to stay here
and take care of some things.

1095
00:55:06,604 --> 00:55:07,972
- But what about your promotion?

1096
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,574
People are talking.

1097
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:11,108
They're like vultures.

1098
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,578
- I'll call 'em tomorrow and
I'm gonna make it all right.

1099
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,413
Julia, it's...

1100
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:18,716
I have to stay here
and help my father.

1101
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,951
All right, he's...

1102
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,052
He's not doing too well

1103
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:24,088
and he doesn't
want anyone to know

1104
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,990
but I know that I can tell you.

1105
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:27,892
He's sick.

1106
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:31,762
So, I'm trying to get him
to go to the hospital.

1107
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:34,432
- You know what
Rick, I have to go.

1108
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:36,066
- Hello?

1109
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,905
(sad music)

1110
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,711
- Well, trust funds are
pretty easy to set up,

1111
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:47,812
you know, just have
your dad give you

1112
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,046
the power of attorney...

1113
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,014
- He already has.

1114
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,716
- He has, huh?

1115
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:53,784
Hmm.

1116
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,754
Looks like everything
is in order.

1117
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,959
Okay, well I'll start
drafting the documents.

1118
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,961
- And the house?

1119
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:06,464
- The house, he wants
to sell the house?

1120
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:07,798
- He just uh, wants to find out

1121
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:09,800
how much the property is worth.

1122
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,436
It's a midlife crisis.

1123
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:12,570
- Hmm-mm.

1124
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:16,741
Well, uhm, I'll have an
appraiser look at it, okay?

1125
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:17,575
- [Richard] Okay.

1126
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:18,743
- [Mr. Bonilla]
Give me a second.

1127
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:20,177
- Can I ask you a question?

1128
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,712
- [Mr. Bonilla]
Sure, what is it?

1129
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:23,581
- How much do you think
Sunnyside is worth?

1130
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,083
- Sunnyside?

1131
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:29,720
Yeah, there's no way your
dad wants to sell Sunnyside.

1132
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,456
Is everything okay?

1133
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:32,623
- Yeah, everything is
fine, I just wanna know

1134
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:34,058
how much the property
itself is worth.

1135
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,661
- Well that land, I'll
tell you right now,

1136
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:37,962
it's not fertile.

1137
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:40,665
- But somebody, I mean,
should wanna buy it,

1138
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:41,766
it's right near the freeway.

1139
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,768
- There's a lot
of history there.

1140
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:46,937
- Yeah well let's
have an appraiser

1141
00:56:46,971 --> 00:56:48,739
take a look at it anyway.

1142
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:50,140
- Of course.

1143
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,209
- You've been waiting for years?

1144
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,410
- Yeah.

1145
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:55,045
- Let me tell you something
son, don't ever wait that long.

1146
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,682
Because this woman
is gonna be gone.

1147
00:56:57,715 --> 00:56:58,649
- No I know--

1148
00:56:58,683 --> 00:56:59,750
- Hey son!

1149
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,219
- I didn't think you'd be here.

1150
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,888
- Why wouldn't I?

1151
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,824
Uh, this is Justin and Martha.

1152
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:07,592
- [Richard] Hello.

1153
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,759
- [Justin] Hi.

1154
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:09,660
- Well, it's nice
to finally meet you.

1155
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:12,196
- [Gilberto] These
two just got engaged.

1156
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:13,363
- [Richard] Oh, congratulations.

1157
00:57:13,397 --> 00:57:16,233
- Well yeah I mean, my dad
proposed to my mom here,

1158
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,035
so I figured...

1159
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:20,571
- So you literally
just got engaged?

1160
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:22,172
Oh wow.

1161
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:22,973
- [Gilberto] Look at
that, look at that.

1162
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:24,675
- [Sofia] Felicitations!

1163
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:25,943
(crowd muttering)

1164
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,712
- That's so nice of you.

1165
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:30,681
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1166
00:57:30,715 --> 00:57:32,082
- Yes, we gotta take
a picture of you,

1167
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,818
this important
moment, for the wall.

1168
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:35,219
- Oh that's so cool,
I've always wanted to be

1169
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:36,453
on the Sunnyside wall.

1170
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:38,823
- [Justin] Oh, but you need to
be in it too, Mr. Escamilla.

1171
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:39,757
- All right.

1172
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,125
- You too, Richard Lynn.

1173
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:42,893
- [Richard] Ah no, I
don't like my photo taken.

1174
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:44,729
- Come on, please?

1175
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:47,665
- [Sofia] Okay!

1176
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,166
Everybody, whiskey!

1177
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,935
- [Group] Whiskey!

1178
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:52,770
- [Sofia] Muy bien.

1179
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:54,038
- Let's see.

1180
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:56,707
Oh great!

1181
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:57,775
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1182
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:58,576
- Okay.

1183
00:57:58,609 --> 00:57:59,544
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1184
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:00,678
She's gonna print it out.

1185
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:03,548
Listen I am so proud
of both of you.

1186
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,782
Thank you for doing it here.

1187
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,950
- [Justin] Thank
you Mr. Escamilla.

1188
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,586
- And I remember when your
parents used to bring you here,

1189
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:09,854
when you were a little kid.

1190
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:11,188
They used to bring you
after football practice.

1191
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:12,823
- Yeah, everyday.
- Right?

1192
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:13,724
(laughter)

1193
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:15,826
Well let me show you
around the place.

1194
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,227
You don't know the
history behind this thing.

1195
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:18,929
You know this was gonna be,

1196
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:21,732
I think it was gonna be a
bowling alley at one time.

1197
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,734
Yeah, we took it over.

1198
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:27,938
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1199
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:41,018
(sad music)

1200
00:58:49,627 --> 00:58:50,761
- Hello, Mr. Young.

1201
00:58:50,795 --> 00:58:52,329
- Rick, are you
on your way back?

1202
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,899
- Actually, sir, I'm gonna have
to stay for a few more days.

1203
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:57,835
- (sighs) You're putting me
in a tough position, Rick.

1204
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,937
- I know, sir, but I have
been doing some work here

1205
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,072
and keeping up with my clients.

1206
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:04,141
I'm about to close
a deal with ZP.

1207
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:06,276
- Really?

1208
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:09,213
- Yes sir, I spoke with Maura
in the financial department.

1209
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:12,917
And she should give me an
answer by the end of the week.

1210
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:15,786
- That's good, that's real good.

1211
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,221
- I told you I wouldn't
disappoint you, sir.

1212
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:19,289
- [Mr. Young] Good work, son.

1213
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:22,559
- Thank you, thank you,
I'll talk to you soon.

1214
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:24,729
- Who's that?

1215
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:26,330
- That's my boss.

1216
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,700
What are you doing here?

1217
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:31,235
- I'm working.

1218
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,838
- I thought you
were feeling sick.

1219
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,907
- I was.

1220
00:59:37,842 --> 00:59:39,910
But I'm feeling better now.

1221
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,781
- Here's your medicine.

1222
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:44,982
- Thank you.

1223
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:53,157
- Dad, I don't
think I can do this.

1224
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,225
Go on pretending that
everything is fine.

1225
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,795
- [Gilberto] Well what
else is there to do?

1226
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,897
- What are those for?

1227
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:01,899
- [Gilberto] Pain.

1228
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:06,904
Symptoms.

1229
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:08,706
- Dad...

1230
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:10,775
- Did you go see Mr. Bonilla?

1231
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,243
- Yeah.

1232
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:17,247
- You're doing fine, son.

1233
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:23,220
(relaxing music)

1234
01:00:52,116 --> 01:00:56,053
- [Voiceover] I
work at a school.

1235
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,855
- [Class] School.

1236
01:00:57,888 --> 01:01:00,991
- I went to school in...

1237
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:02,192
Go ahead.

1238
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:03,327
- Venezuela.

1239
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,661
- [Teacher] Very good.

1240
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:08,866
- Hey Chris.

1241
01:01:08,899 --> 01:01:10,000
- Hey, my man.

1242
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,201
How's it going?

1243
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:12,436
- [Richard] Good,
it's going all right.

1244
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,404
Hey have you uhm, have
you talked to Julia?

1245
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:15,773
- I seen her around.

1246
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:16,774
- [Richard] Is she
doing all right?

1247
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,208
- As she can be, you know.

1248
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,110
- Yeah I know man,
I feel really bad.

1249
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:21,812
Well if you see her,
keep an eye on her okay?

1250
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:23,413
- Yeah, yeah, no doubt.

1251
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:25,750
All right man, hey, I
gotta get back to uhm...

1252
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:27,852
- [Richard] All
right, yeah, thanks.

1253
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,259
- Was that him?

1254
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,427
- Yup.

1255
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:39,864
- How did this happen?

1256
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,300
He can never find out.

1257
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,471
(the grandmother speaks Spanish)

1258
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:49,139
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

1259
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:50,174
(the grandmother speaks Spanish)

1260
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,876
(door knocking)

1261
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:53,811
- Richard Lynn!

1262
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:54,779
- Hey.

1263
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:56,146
(the grandmother speaks Spanish)

1264
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,081
- [Sebastian] Richard Lynn!
- Hey little buddy.

1265
01:01:57,782 --> 01:01:58,816
Came to trim those trees.

1266
01:01:58,849 --> 01:01:59,917
- Finally?

1267
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:00,785
- You wanna help?

1268
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:01,418
- Yes.

1269
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:02,887
- Let's go.

1270
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,755
- Be very careful with that boy.

1271
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:06,791
- [Richard] Go, go, keep going!

1272
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:08,893
Bounce harder,
bounce harder, go!

1273
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:10,527
Dig, dig, dig, dig deep!

1274
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,830
Okay there you go, bounce
harder, go, go, go!

1275
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:14,765
Go, bounce, keep bouncing,
keep bouncing, keep bouncing,

1276
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:15,866
you've almost got it.

1277
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,967
Bounce hard, bounce hard!

1278
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:18,769
Bounce harder, bounce
harder, that's it, dig deep!

1279
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:20,838
Oh, oh, oho!

1280
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:21,772
- Ah!

1281
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:23,440
- [Richard] Got it,
woohoo, you all right?

1282
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,042
Ah yeah!

1283
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:26,777
- Oh!

1284
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:33,117
(the grandmother speaks Spanish)

1285
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:38,789
- Thank you, (Spanish language).

1286
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:40,791
- You're welcome.

1287
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:42,459
- Hey, what about me,
I did all the work.

1288
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:44,461
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1289
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,163
- Okay...

1290
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:48,933
(the grandmother speaks Spanish)

1291
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:49,967
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

1292
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,435
(laughter)

1293
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,904
- I think you deserve a
reward for all that hard work.

1294
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:55,072
- Yes.

1295
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,240
- So how about I take you

1296
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:56,941
and your mom to
the beach tomorrow?

1297
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:58,275
- Yes, yes, yes!

1298
01:02:58,308 --> 01:02:59,243
- Yeah?

1299
01:02:59,276 --> 01:02:59,877
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

1300
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,878
- All right.

1301
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:02,546
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1302
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,549
Oh this is my boss,
I have to take this.

1303
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:07,852
Hello?

1304
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:09,353
Yes sir.

1305
01:03:09,386 --> 01:03:10,287
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1306
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,489
(the grandmother speaks Spanish)

1307
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,293
- Por favor, por favor...

1308
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:18,028
- (sighs) Papi...

1309
01:03:18,863 --> 01:03:19,830
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

1310
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:22,199
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1311
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:25,269
- [Richard] We used to
be just like them kids,

1312
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,271
playing here everyday.

1313
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,273
- Man, you remember
that time we lost?

1314
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,275
And got into it with uh,
oh the dude living over

1315
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,444
across the street from me,
what's his name, uh big dude.

1316
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,613
You know who I'm
talking about, big dude.

1317
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,015
- On Sabla, right there?

1318
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:39,216
- Live right across
the street from me.

1319
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:40,517
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, uh, Big Poppa.

1320
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,919
- Big Poppa.

1321
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:44,488
- Big momma had a
big boy (laughs).

1322
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:45,923
- Man I'm trying
to pull you back

1323
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:47,624
'cause you get into it
with him, I gotta fight.

1324
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,159
Being your big brother
and everything,

1325
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:50,294
you know what I'm saying?

1326
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:50,861
- Is that what
you were thinking?

1327
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:52,096
- Yeah!

1328
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:53,830
- All right man, I'm sorry.

1329
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:57,534
- Don't worry about it, you
know I always got your back.

1330
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,004
- Yeah, I know.

1331
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:06,843
- Man you know, I never...

1332
01:04:07,978 --> 01:04:10,280
I never got a chance
to thank you for,

1333
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:13,183
for the money on my commissary.

1334
01:04:13,217 --> 01:04:14,418
- Yeah man.

1335
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,620
- Nah man, that really
kept me alive in there.

1336
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:18,956
- Don't mention it, man.

1337
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:24,028
- So anyway man, you
back, so what's up?

1338
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:25,629
How the Camp treat you?

1339
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:27,464
- She treat me all right.

1340
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:30,367
- So you here for good?

1341
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:32,903
- Hell no.

1342
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,073
I got a good thing going
on in California, man.

1343
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,176
- So if everything
is so good out there,

1344
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,577
what'cha doing out here?

1345
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:46,883
- I gotta tell you
something, Fred.

1346
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:50,087
Man, but you gotta swear
you're not gonna tell anybody.

1347
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,056
- Swear on the bible.

1348
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,061
- It's my pops, man.

1349
01:04:58,495 --> 01:04:59,964
He's dieing.

1350
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:03,000
- Man, get the fuck
outta here man.

1351
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,969
- Doesn't have
that long too live.

1352
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,239
He doesn't want anybody to know.

1353
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:13,243
(sad music)

1354
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:14,644
- Why he uhm...

1355
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:16,746
Why he don't want
nobody to know?

1356
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,616
- I don't know, he doesn't want
people looking at him funny.

1357
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,551
- No shit.

1358
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,020
- I gotta take
care of everything,

1359
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:25,155
I gotta handle all the business.

1360
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:28,225
- Hey yo man, so what
that mean for Sunnyside?

1361
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:29,493
- I'm gonna burn that place down

1362
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:31,161
when it's all said and done.

1363
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:35,532
- What do you mean
you're burning that down?

1364
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:40,704
- Yeah...

1365
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:42,239
- [Freddy C] You know man.

1366
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:45,609
Whatever you need.

1367
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,412
Whatever you need.

1368
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:50,647
I gotcha.

1369
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,022
- Thank you.

1370
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:02,392
- Okay gentlemen, here you go.

1371
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:06,763
Be right back.

1372
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,764
(Gilberto speaks Spanish)

1373
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:12,636
(sad music)

1374
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:16,240
(grunting, huffing and puffing)

1375
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,976
* You're fading in the distance

1376
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:24,081
* I can barely see you go

1377
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,485
* And I don't care
about tomorrow

1378
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:32,789
* 'Cause tonight is all I know

1379
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:37,294
* So I'm walking
slow, I'm not the same

1380
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:42,032
* I feel a change in the weather

1381
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:47,271
* I see that I won't know
anything I won't know

1382
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:56,713
* And I won't do
anything I don't do

1383
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:06,156
* And I wanna see
everything I don't see

1384
01:07:09,326 --> 01:07:11,595
* So I'm walking slow

1385
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:15,732
- How do you like your eggs?

1386
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,701
- I'm not really hungry, son.

1387
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:21,171
- You should eat,
you're feeling okay?

1388
01:07:21,205 --> 01:07:23,107
- [Gilberto] Just a bit weak.

1389
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,708
- Maybe because
you're not eating.

1390
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,710
- [Gilberto] Maybe.

1391
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:29,279
What uh, what do
you got going today?

1392
01:07:29,313 --> 01:07:31,415
- I'm taking Sebastian
to the beach.

1393
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:34,718
- You know he's been talking
about going to the beach non--

1394
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:39,256
(telephone ringing)

1395
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:44,294
- Gotta take this.

1396
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:46,830
Hello, Mr. Young.

1397
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:48,632
You know, the cat is
almost in the bag, sir.

1398
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:52,469
- I need you back
here, by Monday.

1399
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:54,271
- Sir, I'm gonna need
a little more time.

1400
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,140
My father, he's
still not a 100%.

1401
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:59,109
- People are waiting for me to
announce the new management.

1402
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:00,777
- I've been putting
in 60 hour weeks,

1403
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,446
all I'm asking for
is a little time.

1404
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:04,748
- I can't do it, Rick.

1405
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,884
You get back here, or
I'll find someone else.

1406
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,253
- There is no one else.

1407
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:11,087
- Thank you for the tickets.

1408
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:15,259
I had a great time,
too bad they lost.

1409
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,361
- Yeah, too bad.

1410
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:21,865
(sad music)

1411
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:25,535
So how long has it been since
you've been to the beach?

1412
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:27,704
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1413
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:29,673
- She says a long time ago.

1414
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,541
The beach is fun!

1415
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:33,477
- [Richard] Not afraid
of sharks, are you?

1416
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,278
- [Sebastian] No.

1417
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:35,745
- [Richard] All right.

1418
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,550
Are there sharks in
Venezuela, Sofia?

1419
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:42,586
- Yes?

1420
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:43,420
- Sharks?

1421
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,421
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1422
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,355
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

1423
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:50,360
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1424
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:53,730
Shark empanadas?

1425
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:54,631
- Si.

1426
01:08:54,664 --> 01:08:55,799
- What?

1427
01:08:55,832 --> 01:09:00,837
(relaxing music)

1428
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:22,326
You want a cerveza?

1429
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:23,693
- Si.

1430
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:28,698
- Here you go.

1431
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:29,666
- Gracias.

1432
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:31,901
- Here you are.

1433
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:33,837
Let me get that for you.

1434
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,406
- Oh, gracias.

1435
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:37,441
Salud!

1436
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:38,742
- Salud.

1437
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,749
You know the first time I
saw the ocean, I freaked out.

1438
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:47,917
- Que?

1439
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:50,520
- First time I saw
the, "el agua".

1440
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:51,521
- Uhuh?

1441
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:53,323
- Freaked out.

1442
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:54,324
(laughs)

1443
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:55,292
Crying.

1444
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:56,626
- Por que?

1445
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:59,263
- Por que, it's so big.

1446
01:09:59,296 --> 01:09:59,829
- Oh, si.

1447
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,798
- Le muy, vast.

1448
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:05,969
How's school going?

1449
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:08,305
- School is good.

1450
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:10,740
- I can tell you're
making progress.

1451
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:11,775
- Si.

1452
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:12,742
- It's going good.

1453
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:15,979
- Si, yes, yes.

1454
01:10:16,913 --> 01:10:19,849
- But you only want Sebastian
to speak Spanish to you?

1455
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:22,386
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1456
01:10:22,419 --> 01:10:22,819
Por que?

1457
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:24,454
- Por que...

1458
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:28,325
(Spanish language),
he remember home.

1459
01:10:28,358 --> 01:10:31,695
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1460
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,263
Go back...

1461
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,665
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1462
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:37,401
- You're going back?

1463
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:38,768
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1464
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:41,805
- Some day?

1465
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:48,512
Sebastian his dad, would
take him to the beach?

1466
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:53,483
His father would go to the--

1467
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:54,684
- I understand.

1468
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:58,388
He no good.

1469
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:01,725
- I'm sorry for asking.

1470
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:02,826
- It's okay, yeah.

1471
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:06,730
(Spanish pop music)

1472
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,031
(Sebastian speaks Spanish)

1473
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,399
- Let's go, Richard Lynn!

1474
01:11:09,433 --> 01:11:10,700
- I don't wanna be
eaten by sharks.

1475
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:12,369
- Why?

1476
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:13,837
- [Richard] I don't wanna
get eaten by a shark, boy.

1477
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,705
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1478
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:18,842
- You're stubborn.

1479
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,744
(laughs)

1480
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,699
- [Richard] How did
you like the beach?

1481
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:46,002
- It's awesome, but
the water is brown.

1482
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:48,037
- The water is not brown.

1483
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:51,040
What color is it in Venezuela?

1484
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:52,942
- Clear, always blue.

1485
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:54,043
- Blue.

1486
01:11:55,945 --> 01:11:57,514
- [Richard] Hey!

1487
01:11:57,881 --> 01:12:00,049
I told Fred to come
down to the beach.

1488
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:02,419
He showed up.

1489
01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:04,688
- Just doing my thing.

1490
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:06,956
I'ma let it rain.

1491
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,494
I see the sun.

1492
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,597
(mumbling) everything.

1493
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:16,500
Get my mind clear.

1494
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:21,905
Sofia take it back,
sing a song for us here.

1495
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:23,807
Now go ahead!

1496
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,809
(laughs)

1497
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,644
(laughter)

1498
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:32,482
(crowd muttering)

1499
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,084
- Come on Sofia!

1500
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:35,985
- Whatever, anything.

1501
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:37,521
- Anything!

1502
01:12:38,622 --> 01:12:43,393
(Sofia sings in Spanish
and easygoing music)

1503
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:27,704
(laughs)

1504
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,540
(applause and cheering)

1505
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:36,012
(easygoing music)

1506
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:27,497
- Here we are.

1507
01:14:27,531 --> 01:14:29,098
- Si (giggles).

1508
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,501
- Thanks for everything.

1509
01:14:31,535 --> 01:14:32,869
- You're welcome.

1510
01:14:33,269 --> 01:14:35,505
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1511
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:38,908
No...

1512
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:41,945
- Why not?

1513
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:44,113
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1514
01:14:44,614 --> 01:14:45,214
Oh, it's fine.

1515
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:46,883
- No, no, sorry.

1516
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:50,820
(sad music)

1517
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:52,088
- Okay, buenas noches.

1518
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:53,623
- Buenas noches.

1519
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:01,865
- [Richard] Dad?

1520
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:05,802
Dad?

1521
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:07,837
- Yes, son.

1522
01:15:08,805 --> 01:15:11,675
- [Richard] You okay,
it's still early.

1523
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,743
- Oh, just tired.

1524
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,779
You had a good time?

1525
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:17,080
- [Richard] Yeah.

1526
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,115
- Good.

1527
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,218
- [Richard] Good night.

1528
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:30,059
(sad music)

1529
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:35,865
(flames burning)

1530
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:47,010
(door knocking)

1531
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,318
- You're not dressed
yet, we're gonna be late.

1532
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:56,452
- Oh, I forgot mother.

1533
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:59,756
- Hurry, this is the day
that we worship the Lord.

1534
01:15:59,789 --> 01:16:00,890
- [Richard] Well, let
me go wake up my dad.

1535
01:16:00,924 --> 01:16:03,192
- Wake him, he's over at
my house mowing the lawn.

1536
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,493
- What, he's not coming?

1537
01:16:04,527 --> 01:16:06,796
- He doesn't go to
church anymore ever
since your mother...

1538
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:10,900
I tell him that it's a sin
not to accept God's will,

1539
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:12,736
but he doesn't believe me.

1540
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,705
What's happening here,
what's all this packing?

1541
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:16,806
- Didn't my dad tell you?

1542
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,041
- [Grandmother] Tell me what?

1543
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:19,876
- We're exterminating.

1544
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:23,613
- I told him he didn't keep
this house clean enough.

1545
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:25,181
- You're right.

1546
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:27,350
- [Grandmother] Sofia
can't do it all.

1547
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:28,818
- [Richard] Sofia?

1548
01:16:28,852 --> 01:16:29,886
- Yes.

1549
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,921
Hurry, we're gonna be late.

1550
01:16:32,656 --> 01:16:33,790
- [Richard] Is she coming?

1551
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:35,391
- She's a Catholic, I told you.

1552
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,793
- Oh, right.

1553
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:38,795
- Besides she's gonna
meet us later at Lisa.

1554
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:41,798
Everybody is gonna be there,
everybody wants to see you.

1555
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:42,699
- Oh shit.

1556
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:43,833
(gasps)

1557
01:16:43,867 --> 01:16:46,035
- Richard Lynn
Escamilla Pisalof.

1558
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:48,004
- Sorry mother, I meant dang.

1559
01:16:49,372 --> 01:16:54,277
(church bell ringing)

1560
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:16,866
You have your own
parking space, grandma?

1561
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,835
- God's helper of
the month does.

1562
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:20,136
- That's nice.

1563
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:29,913
(communal music)

1564
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:35,184
- Oh my, if it
isn't young Richard.

1565
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:36,820
- Hello Brother Mark.

1566
01:17:36,853 --> 01:17:38,722
- It's so good to see you,
I'm so glad you're here.

1567
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:39,655
- Thank you.

1568
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:41,858
- I told him to come
and see you, brother.

1569
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:42,792
- Thank you, Sister Escamilla.

1570
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:45,762
I was raised by two very
strong grandmothers.

1571
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:47,931
Now one of them was
strict Southern Baptist

1572
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:50,166
and one was strict
Church of Christ.

1573
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:53,069
I was in church seven days
a week and still going

1574
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:54,971
to hell according
to one or the other.

1575
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,206
(laughter)

1576
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:01,010
But faith isn't
about the trappings.

1577
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:04,147
What we learned from
our reading today,

1578
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,816
is that we can look a mirror
and all we see is a cover

1579
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:08,684
of our true selves.

1580
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:13,857
But our souls, can
be filled with hold.

1581
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:17,026
And whether you
live in El Campo,

1582
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:21,998
or Southern California, you
cannot hide from that truth.

1583
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:22,966
Amen and amen.

1584
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,801
- [Congregation] Amen and amen.

1585
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:29,839
* Amazing grace,
how sweet the sound

1586
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:39,715
* That saved a wretch like me

1587
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:45,188
(relaxing music)

1588
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:13,917
(crowd muttering)

1589
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,018
- [Voiceover] Hello.

1590
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:16,052
- [Richard] Hello.

1591
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,453
- Look who's here.

1592
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:19,956
- [Voiceover] Richard Lynn,
you have grown so much!

1593
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:23,359
And looks like you've grown
up so much like your mother.

1594
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:26,963
- Ugh, heathens.

1595
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:28,832
They're always drinking.

1596
01:19:28,865 --> 01:19:30,566
- [Voiceover] Mother, it's
Sunday, they're just resting.

1597
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,435
- It's a sin.

1598
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:36,005
- And did Jesus not
turn water into wine?

1599
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:38,141
- Back then wine had no alcohol.

1600
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:39,542
- [Voiceover] Hey
Richard, how you been?

1601
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:40,944
Great to see you dude, I
haven't seen you in a long time.

1602
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:41,811
- [Richard] Yeah,
it's been a while.

1603
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:42,812
- Oh great man.

1604
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:43,412
- Man, I missed this.

1605
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:44,180
- So you're my cousin?

1606
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:44,914
- [Richard] Yeah?

1607
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:45,481
- Yeah.

1608
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:46,149
- Happy birthday.

1609
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:47,383
- Thanks man.

1610
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,184
- I remember you, when
you were like, what,

1611
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:49,052
he was like this big?

1612
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:50,453
(laughter)

1613
01:19:51,154 --> 01:19:52,889
- Lisa insisted in
having brisket for you.

1614
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:53,789
- [Richard] Nah, you
didn't have to do that.

1615
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:54,858
- Yo, I'm throwing
up for you, man.

1616
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:56,392
- [Group] Hey, cheers.

1617
01:19:56,425 --> 01:19:57,560
- Welcome back, congratulations.

1618
01:19:57,593 --> 01:19:58,895
- It's good to be home.

1619
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:03,900
(relaxing music)

1620
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:17,480
(sighs)

1621
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:19,515
- That's Gilberto isn't it?

1622
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:37,000
- Hello familia!

1623
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:41,270
(the grandmother speaks Spanish)

1624
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:43,973
- [Grandmother]
That's a nice bike.

1625
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:45,341
- Thank you mother.

1626
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,010
- But those things
are dangerous.

1627
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:49,145
- I know (snickers).

1628
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,914
Ladies.

1629
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:57,253
- Look at that, John
Wayne in the flesh, man.

1630
01:20:57,286 --> 01:20:58,888
- That's right, thank you.

1631
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:00,189
- You, hey man, aren't
you too old for that, man?

1632
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:02,959
- It's never too
late, right son?

1633
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:03,659
- Yeah...

1634
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:04,994
- Better late, than never.

1635
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:09,198
So how's the brisket?

1636
01:21:09,232 --> 01:21:10,633
- Man, it's freaking amazing!

1637
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:11,901
- [Voiceover] It's gotta
be better than that, man.

1638
01:21:11,935 --> 01:21:14,971
(laughter and crowd muttering)

1639
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:18,341
(telephone ringing)

1640
01:21:18,674 --> 01:21:20,109
- [Julia] Hey Rick.

1641
01:21:20,143 --> 01:21:21,610
- Where have you been?

1642
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:24,413
- I've been working, you know.

1643
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:26,515
- Is everything all right?

1644
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:29,085
- No, no, everything
is not all right.

1645
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:31,087
You freaking left and
you didn't even tell me.

1646
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:33,923
- Well I told you to come
down for a couple of days.

1647
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:35,391
- Oh, and do what?

1648
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:38,061
You don't just walk away
from your responsibilities.

1649
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:39,963
- I already told you,
my father is sick,

1650
01:21:39,996 --> 01:21:41,430
the least I could expect
is some moral support

1651
01:21:41,464 --> 01:21:43,099
from my girlfriend.

1652
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,704
- How long until you get back?

1653
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:49,605
- Until I have to.

1654
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:51,274
You know, I'm trying
to explain to you,

1655
01:21:51,307 --> 01:21:53,642
my father, I gotta
be with my family.

1656
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:57,313
- I don't think this is
gonna work out for me.

1657
01:21:57,981 --> 01:22:01,917
I need a man who's not
gonna throw his future away.

1658
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,555
- You know what, my family
is calling me right now,

1659
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:09,192
Julia, you just do what
you gotta do, okay?

1660
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:13,729
- [Grandmother] Well, I
guess I wanna call it a day.

1661
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,698
I'm very tired and
it is very hot.

1662
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,333
- Just stay.

1663
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:18,634
- No, no, no, no, no, I'm
not comfortable anymore.

1664
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:19,702
I have to go.

1665
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:24,940
(playful cheering)

1666
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:30,980
(sad music)

1667
01:22:31,014 --> 01:22:32,115
- Hey.

1668
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:34,317
- Hola.

1669
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:37,120
- Can I buy you a beer?

1670
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:40,589
I brought you a beer.

1671
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:41,724
- Gracias.

1672
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:43,692
Salud.

1673
01:22:43,726 --> 01:22:45,061
- [Richard] Salud.

1674
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:51,700
What are you doing here?

1675
01:22:53,536 --> 01:22:54,703
- Ah...

1676
01:22:54,737 --> 01:22:56,339
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1677
01:23:00,043 --> 01:23:01,310
- I had a dream about you.

1678
01:23:03,112 --> 01:23:07,350
I had a beautiful,
"sueno" about you.

1679
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:10,086
- [Sofia] Si?

1680
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,088
- Si.

1681
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,764
(giggling)

1682
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:35,344
(crowd muttering and
faint guitar playing)

1683
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:44,053
Look at that.

1684
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:47,423
- It's quite
something, ain't it?

1685
01:23:48,224 --> 01:23:49,725
- How often does the
family get together?

1686
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,527
- Pft, every other week.

1687
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:54,263
- [Richard] And how's
the farm running?

1688
01:23:54,297 --> 01:23:56,365
- All right, we had to
sell some of the land

1689
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:57,733
because of the drought.

1690
01:23:57,766 --> 01:23:59,802
- Oh man, sorry to
hear about that.

1691
01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:02,805
- I didn't want to, but, I
gotta do what the wife says.

1692
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:06,142
It's all good man, I wouldn't
have it any other way.

1693
01:24:06,175 --> 01:24:06,842
- Salud to that.

1694
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,111
- Yep.

1695
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:15,184
She's a looker huh?

1696
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:16,719
- Who?

1697
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:18,421
- Sofia, that's who.

1698
01:24:19,288 --> 01:24:20,789
- Yeah, she's kinda cute.

1699
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:30,065
(laughs)

1700
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:32,668
What?

1701
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:34,503
- It's funny.

1702
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,174
Don't tell anybody I told you.

1703
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,845
A while back ago Gilberto
and I, about a year ago,

1704
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:44,713
he was feeling kinda low.

1705
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:46,749
So, I took him over to
the Gentlemen's Palace

1706
01:24:46,782 --> 01:24:48,617
over there in Victoria.

1707
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:49,785
I didn't want Lisa to find out,

1708
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,720
so we went all the
way over there.

1709
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:54,257
The man has needs.

1710
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:56,259
Pass me another beer.

1711
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:59,662
Well he sees her there
and just falls for her.

1712
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:01,130
Next I thing I know, a
couple of weeks later,

1713
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:03,366
she moves in with him.

1714
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:05,668
He must've gone back
and convinced her.

1715
01:25:05,701 --> 01:25:08,337
(ominous music and laughter)

1716
01:25:08,371 --> 01:25:09,772
Ah...

1717
01:25:09,805 --> 01:25:10,639
- Hmm.

1718
01:25:10,673 --> 01:25:11,807
- He's so lucky,
that son of a bitch,

1719
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,376
to have a woman like that.

1720
01:25:16,245 --> 01:25:17,846
He's going to marry her.

1721
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,251
Let's toast to that.

1722
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,355
(laughs)

1723
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:33,529
(Jim laughs)

1724
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:35,764
Ah come on man, I'm
just joking around,

1725
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:37,400
you don't have to get
all mad and everything.

1726
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:38,467
- Oh, I'm not mad.

1727
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:39,668
- [Jim] Ah yeah, alright.

1728
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:40,636
- I'll be back.

1729
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:41,270
- [Jim] Hey, where you
going, come on man?!

1730
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:43,539
You said you weren't mad!

1731
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:47,176
(Jim laughs)

1732
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:52,448
- [Richard] Fuck,
I don't have a car.

1733
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:55,684
- [Sofia] Richard
Lynn, Richard Lynn?

1734
01:25:55,718 --> 01:25:57,720
- Leave me alone whore.

1735
01:25:58,287 --> 01:25:59,822
You know that word, don't you?

1736
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:01,724
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1737
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:02,391
Now that my dad's
dieing you wanna fuck

1738
01:26:02,425 --> 01:26:04,827
and suck him dry, don't you?

1739
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:08,731
- Gilberto die?

1740
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:10,733
- Don't act like you don't know.

1741
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,338
- No...

1742
01:26:18,941 --> 01:26:22,778
I no whore, I no whore...

1743
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:25,448
(shouting) I no whore!

1744
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:36,859
- [Richard] June
sixth, Sunnyside,

1745
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:38,961
goes to Sofia Palumbo?

1746
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:42,197
What is this?

1747
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:44,667
Hmm?

1748
01:26:45,268 --> 01:26:46,402
You can't do this.

1749
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:47,736
- I know, I need
your permission.

1750
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,372
- Why would I do that?

1751
01:26:49,405 --> 01:26:50,606
- Well, because you
hate the damn place.

1752
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:51,774
- Oh, it's fucking
clear now huh?

1753
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:54,810
You wanted me back here so
that I could sign these papers.

1754
01:26:55,811 --> 01:26:57,980
(aggressive door knocking)

1755
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:03,218
(sad music)

1756
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:05,321
- What's wrong?

1757
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:25,474
- Why did you tell
her, she's devastated.

1758
01:27:25,508 --> 01:27:27,776
She's the last person
I wanted to know.

1759
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:28,811
- I'm sorry.

1760
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:30,779
I didn't know about...

1761
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,681
I didn't know about you two.

1762
01:27:32,715 --> 01:27:35,618
- What the hell are you
talking about, Richard Lynn?

1763
01:27:35,651 --> 01:27:37,486
- I know the two of
you are together.

1764
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,288
- Who do the hell
do you take me for?!

1765
01:27:39,322 --> 01:27:41,524
- Jim told me everything
that was going on.

1766
01:27:41,557 --> 01:27:43,459
- How are you gonna
listen to fucking Jim?

1767
01:27:43,492 --> 01:27:44,727
He's a goddamn idiot!

1768
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,728
- Hey!

1769
01:27:46,729 --> 01:27:49,332
Dad, sit down, sit down.

1770
01:27:49,365 --> 01:27:53,802
(sad music)

1771
01:27:54,803 --> 01:27:56,372
Let me get you some water.

1772
01:27:56,405 --> 01:28:00,909
(grunting and heaving)

1773
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:19,828
(coughs)

1774
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:34,009
- I, I met her at that place.

1775
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:35,844
- [Richard] I understand.

1776
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:40,783
- She, she was working there
as a cocktail waitress.

1777
01:28:41,417 --> 01:28:42,618
- Waitress?

1778
01:28:42,918 --> 01:28:44,920
- Yeah, yeah.

1779
01:28:46,522 --> 01:28:50,726
She had such a special
way about her, she...

1780
01:28:51,126 --> 01:28:52,995
She didn't belong there.

1781
01:28:53,762 --> 01:28:58,667
God, Richard, she glows
just like your mom.

1782
01:29:05,408 --> 01:29:07,610
Sebastian's father,

1783
01:29:07,643 --> 01:29:11,113
he got really involved
in politics down there.

1784
01:29:12,481 --> 01:29:14,950
She was a news reporter.

1785
01:29:16,485 --> 01:29:18,587
She did some story
that he thought

1786
01:29:18,621 --> 01:29:21,023
was anti-government, so...

1787
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:25,761
He, he turned her in.

1788
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:30,933
She's here under
political asylum.

1789
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:32,768
- She can't go back?

1790
01:29:33,936 --> 01:29:35,871
- Not now, who knows when.

1791
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,108
She's the one who took
me to the hospital.

1792
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,411
And I lied to her.

1793
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:44,480
I told her I was fine.

1794
01:29:50,953 --> 01:29:53,822
You gotta make sure that
she's taken care of.

1795
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,595
You gotta promise.

1796
01:30:02,865 --> 01:30:06,902
- I promise, okay, I promise.

1797
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:17,546
(doorbell ringing)

1798
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:18,447
(door knocking)

1799
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:19,448
Sofia?

1800
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:23,552
Sofia, I need to talk to you.

1801
01:30:26,889 --> 01:30:28,156
Sofia?

1802
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:31,460
My dad gave me your address.

1803
01:30:31,494 --> 01:30:32,761
- Gilberto is okay?

1804
01:30:32,795 --> 01:30:33,829
- Yeah.

1805
01:30:34,797 --> 01:30:36,465
Can I come in, please?

1806
01:30:39,802 --> 01:30:40,903
Hey!

1807
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:44,139
Sofia, I'm sorry.

1808
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:46,709
I just really need
to talk to you.

1809
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:50,646
Please, will you talk to me?

1810
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:51,780
- You call me, you say...

1811
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:54,717
- [Richard] I know, I know.

1812
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,852
I'm sorry I was a jerk.

1813
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,987
- Jerk?

1814
01:30:59,922 --> 01:31:01,590
- [Richard] Yeah I was a jerk.
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1815
01:31:01,624 --> 01:31:03,125
- (Spanish language), jerk?

1816
01:31:03,158 --> 01:31:04,893
- Jerk is I don't...

1817
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:07,630
I don't know, I don't
know how to explain jerk.

1818
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:09,965
It's what I was being.

1819
01:31:11,634 --> 01:31:12,801
- Jerk?

1820
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:14,903
- You can call me jerk whenever.

1821
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:22,911
- Jerk.

1822
01:31:25,013 --> 01:31:26,615
- [Richard] Yes.

1823
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:29,618
Can I come in?

1824
01:31:45,868 --> 01:31:47,870
I just wanna say thank you.

1825
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:52,207
For, for being
there for my father.

1826
01:31:53,576 --> 01:31:54,877
When I wasn't.

1827
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,545
- That's okay.

1828
01:31:56,945 --> 01:31:58,180
- I just...

1829
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:01,684
You know, I ran away
when things got hard.

1830
01:32:03,619 --> 01:32:05,287
I ran away from my family,

1831
01:32:05,821 --> 01:32:07,890
my friends, everything
that I knew.

1832
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:10,793
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1833
01:32:11,927 --> 01:32:13,796
You don't understand me?

1834
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:16,799
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1835
01:32:18,834 --> 01:32:21,069
I'm gonna make sure
everything is okay with,

1836
01:32:21,103 --> 01:32:22,905
with you and Sebastian.

1837
01:32:22,938 --> 01:32:24,272
- Sebastian.

1838
01:32:24,306 --> 01:32:26,108
- [Richard] Sebastian.

1839
01:32:27,943 --> 01:32:32,915
(romantic, sad, Spanish music)

1840
01:32:33,115 --> 01:32:34,717
- You good.

1841
01:33:30,873 --> 01:33:34,309
(giggling)

1842
01:33:36,411 --> 01:33:41,149
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

1843
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:52,027
(telephone ringing)

1844
01:34:00,736 --> 01:34:01,837
- Hello?

1845
01:34:05,841 --> 01:34:07,142
We gotta go.

1846
01:34:11,313 --> 01:34:12,881
- I just gave him an injection,

1847
01:34:12,915 --> 01:34:14,316
he's in and out
of consciousness.

1848
01:34:14,349 --> 01:34:15,050
- How did you...

1849
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:16,752
- He called me.

1850
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:17,986
- Can I go see him?

1851
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:19,421
- Go ahead.

1852
01:34:22,024 --> 01:34:22,791
- [Sofia] He good?

1853
01:34:22,825 --> 01:34:23,759
- He's doing okay, yeah.

1854
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:24,960
- [Sofia] Okay.

1855
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:25,828
- He's just in and
out of consciousness,

1856
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:27,295
but he's resting
comfortable, yes.

1857
01:34:31,734 --> 01:34:34,202
(sad music)

1858
01:34:34,236 --> 01:34:35,871
- [Richard] Dad?

1859
01:34:38,206 --> 01:34:39,174
- Hey...

1860
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:42,945
- What happened?

1861
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:49,417
- Uh, I think the cancer got
the news real quick, hehe...

1862
01:34:51,887 --> 01:34:53,455
- You just need to rest.

1863
01:34:55,223 --> 01:34:57,893
- There's something
that I need to tell you.

1864
01:34:57,926 --> 01:35:00,462
- Dad, don't talk
like that, okay?

1865
01:35:01,496 --> 01:35:05,801
- I know that you blame me for
what happened to your mother.

1866
01:35:05,834 --> 01:35:07,102
- Hey...

1867
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:09,972
Please.

1868
01:35:12,107 --> 01:35:14,176
- That night at the bar.

1869
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:18,013
I tried to help her.

1870
01:35:20,082 --> 01:35:23,852
But there was nothing
any of us could've done.

1871
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:27,255
- [Richard] What do you mean?

1872
01:35:31,093 --> 01:35:33,962
- [Gilberto] She had a
weak heart, Richard Lynn.

1873
01:35:42,204 --> 01:35:46,341
Do you remember, going in
and out of the hospital?

1874
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:49,945
- Yeah.

1875
01:35:50,278 --> 01:35:51,914
But she told me...

1876
01:35:52,114 --> 01:35:53,982
- [Gilberto] Oh, she...

1877
01:35:55,017 --> 01:35:58,186
She loved you so
much, Richard Lynn.

1878
01:36:00,956 --> 01:36:03,091
That's why she never told you.

1879
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:07,195
She wanted you to be so happy.

1880
01:36:07,963 --> 01:36:09,564
To not worry about her.

1881
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:12,167
- Why didn't you tell
me after she died?

1882
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,838
- Because I gave her my
word that I wouldn't.

1883
01:36:16,204 --> 01:36:18,941
She wanted you to remember

1884
01:36:18,974 --> 01:36:22,945
her healthy, strong.

1885
01:36:29,985 --> 01:36:32,054
I guess when I see her
now, I'm gonna have to

1886
01:36:32,087 --> 01:36:34,990
tell her that I
broke my promise.

1887
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,295
- Dad forgive me.

1888
01:36:43,565 --> 01:36:45,868
Forgive me for running away.

1889
01:36:51,874 --> 01:36:53,475
- [Gilberto] You're home Rich...

1890
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:54,843
You're home...

1891
01:36:54,877 --> 01:36:57,079
You're home Richard Lynn.

1892
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:00,415
Can I ask one last...

1893
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:07,022
Can I ask you a favor?

1894
01:37:07,455 --> 01:37:11,593
(Richard cries and
laughs at the same time)

1895
01:37:11,994 --> 01:37:13,295
- [Richard] Another one?

1896
01:37:13,996 --> 01:37:15,931
(Gilberto laughs)

1897
01:37:17,966 --> 01:37:19,001
Anything.

1898
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:28,076
(sad music)

1899
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:56,871
(faint crying and
church bell ringing)

1900
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,983
(the man speaks Spanish)

1901
01:38:18,961 --> 01:38:20,428
- Ey yo Rick man,
how you holding up?

1902
01:38:20,462 --> 01:38:21,896
- All right.

1903
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,131
- Where you going?

1904
01:38:23,165 --> 01:38:24,266
- [Grandmother] Richard Lynn!

1905
01:38:24,299 --> 01:38:25,968
- I'm gonna go burn
that place down.

1906
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:27,335
- Man come on Rick man, you
ain't gonna burn nothing down.

1907
01:38:27,369 --> 01:38:28,937
- [Richard] Told you I was.

1908
01:38:30,072 --> 01:38:31,206
- Rick, where you going man?

1909
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,307
- I'm gonna burn the
fucking place down,

1910
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:33,942
I already told you.

1911
01:38:33,976 --> 01:38:35,143
- Rick come on man, you ain't
gonna burn nothing down,

1912
01:38:35,177 --> 01:38:36,478
get out the truck man.

1913
01:38:37,145 --> 01:38:39,014
Hey come on, get out the truck.

1914
01:38:39,614 --> 01:38:41,183
Rick, Rick!

1915
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:43,952
Get out the car, Rick!

1916
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:45,487
Rick!

1917
01:38:47,455 --> 01:38:48,490
- [Sebastian] Rick!!

1918
01:38:48,523 --> 01:38:53,028
(ominous music)

1919
01:39:10,245 --> 01:39:13,581
(screeching brakes)

1920
01:39:17,585 --> 01:39:19,721
- [Richard] Thank you everyone
for coming, but please leave.

1921
01:39:21,423 --> 01:39:22,991
Please leave.

1922
01:39:23,025 --> 01:39:24,759
This is private property, leave!

1923
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:27,029
Leave, right now, leave!!

1924
01:39:42,044 --> 01:39:43,111
- Hey yo Rick man,
what you doing?

1925
01:39:43,145 --> 01:39:44,346
- I'm burning this place down!

1926
01:39:44,379 --> 01:39:45,280
- Come on man, I thought
you was just playing!

1927
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:46,148
- I told you I was!

1928
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:46,748
- Rick Lynn, no!

1929
01:39:46,781 --> 01:39:48,550
(shouts in Spanish)

1930
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:50,518
- My mother died here,
my mother died here,

1931
01:39:50,552 --> 01:39:52,087
I'm gonna burn this place down.

1932
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,688
- Tough times don't last,
tough people do, come on man!

1933
01:39:53,721 --> 01:39:55,657
- This place made my
dad sick, it's cursed.

1934
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:56,591
- No, it's not!

1935
01:39:56,624 --> 01:39:57,559
- [Richard] You said
it yourself, grandma!

1936
01:39:57,592 --> 01:39:58,193
You said it yourself!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1937
01:39:58,226 --> 01:40:00,595
I was wrong, I was wrong!

1938
01:40:00,628 --> 01:40:01,496
- This place is cursed!

1939
01:40:01,529 --> 01:40:03,765
(police sirens and
crowd muttering)

1940
01:40:03,798 --> 01:40:05,400
- What's going on here?

1941
01:40:05,433 --> 01:40:07,069
- Please stop him, he says
he's gonna burn down the place.

1942
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:10,338
- Gilberto saved for
years to buy this place,

1943
01:40:10,372 --> 01:40:12,407
so it could be the
center of the town,

1944
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,476
so we could all come
and get together here.

1945
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:18,780
(crowd shouting)

1946
01:40:20,215 --> 01:40:22,217
Beautiful things
have happened here!

1947
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:26,788
(sad music)

1948
01:40:31,393 --> 01:40:33,228
(crowd shouting)

1949
01:40:33,261 --> 01:40:37,031
- [Freddy C] Tough times don't
last, tough people do man.

1950
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:43,105
- [Grandmother] Richard,
Richard remember, remember?

1951
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:50,278
- I like this
place, Richard Lynn.

1952
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:53,781
- I like it too.

1953
01:41:22,677 --> 01:41:25,647
Hello Mr. Young,
I'm sorry but uh,

1954
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,782
but I decided to take
a better offer sir.

1955
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:29,784
Hey now, I wanna thank you,
I really wanna thank you

1956
01:41:29,817 --> 01:41:32,587
for the opportunity and
everything you've done for me

1957
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:34,822
and just, I really
