1
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,840
VOICES FROM THE NEXT ROOM

2
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,400
Hey, hey.

3
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,480
There's a party outside.

4
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,960
Lots of good people.

5
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
Who spent a lot of
money just to see you.

6
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
Yup.

7
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,160
I'm working on my speech.

8
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,000
-Do not joke!

9
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,360
You must join the fray!

10
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
Absorb their hopes

11
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
and pretend they are yours.
-Right!

12
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,920
Right

13
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,400
What's wrong with the speech?
I mean, it works fine.

14
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,280
It worked wonderfully two
days ago in the hospital.

15
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,440
I'm thinking about what I would like to say.

16
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,940
Please leave us alone, I
want to talk to my nephew.

17
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,400
Here, Pudge, this stuff
sucks. Throw it away

18
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,120
I believe that
evil and failures of

19
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
men are nothing,
and what courage

20
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,440
and effort are everything.

21
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,320
My father used to tell me that
it's everyone's responsibility

22
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,120
to help tame the savage menace of man

23
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,920
and to make life better in this world.

24
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,880
With your help as your
representative in Congress,

25
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,740
I would very much like the opportunity
to put his teachings into practice.

26
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,340
You are great!

27
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,180
Cray, you look a lot like your father.
I seem to see it again.

28
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,140
-I'm proud of you!
I hope everyone thinks like you.

29
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,500
You left them speechless!
Beauty, will you bring us a drink?

30
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,380
-What do you take?
-I would like a Pimm's Cup.

31
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,560
Yeah, well, don't stare at the thirsty man.

32
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,400
Honey, get him a
cup of Pimm's now.

33
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,440
-Thank you.
-He earned his drink.

34
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,460
What a beautiful girl is stuff for "iron balls"

35
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:45,676
Are mine?

36
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,220
From the noise it would seem so

37
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,920
That was your zipper.

38
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
Hey, look at you.

39
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,240
Cray walks into my office.

40
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,120
Nathan LaFleur is waiting for you upstairs.

41
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,640
He's an important man, be nice to him.

42
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,860
He can provide the grades
we need, and we need a lot!

43
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you think I can say something stupid?

44
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,440
No, you will not argue.

45
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,960
So where is Natalie?

46
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
She called.

47
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,320
You are late.

48
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,400
Do not look at me like this.

49
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,840
This makes me very nervous.

50
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,800
Mr. LaFleur. -Mr. Flowler

51
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm sorry I missed his speech.

52
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,040
It was almost the same as another.

53
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,580
Please sit down. -Thank you

54
00:07:39,582 --> 00:07:40,960
What do you drink?

55
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,022
What do you drink?
Ah, coke, very little ice, please.

56
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:43,920
Ah, coke, very little ice, please.

57
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,180
I followed her to court
in the Charbonneau case.

58
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,200
I am a great admirer of him.
-Thank you.

59
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,260
It's a nice house
that-he Never been here?

60
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,800
No.

61
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,600
They forced her during Prohibition.

62
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,320
My grandfather bought it after the war.

63
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,120
The Colonel has bought a large number
of things in the county of St Albans.

64
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,400
After the war.

65
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,720
Oh, my grandfather brought
the twentieth century here

66
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,040
electricity, water
system, sewage.

67
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,720
He was a very important man.

68
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,800
I remember a speech he once gave

69
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,760
advocating armed
resistance to immigration.

70
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,080
Are we here to talk about our grandparents?

71
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,920
My grandfather was a

72
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,420
sharecropper for the record.

73
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,520
His father came to see
me a week before he died.

74
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,460
I didn't know you knew each other.
-Indeed

75
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:43,044
He asked me questions about the
federal lawsuit filed against his family.

76
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,680
I did consulting work
for one of the plaintiffs.

77
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,800
Well, the case against my family
was dropped before the trial came.

78
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,500
Your father committed suicide
the day he should have testified.

79
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,660
It was an accident

80
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,660
Mr. Fowler...

81
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,180
Over the past 50 years, his family has amassed
one of the largest fortunes in the state.

82
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,640
And blacks are still at an
intolerable level of poverty.

83
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,840
Now his land sits atop the
largest gas reserves in the region.

84
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,800
Revenue from these
reserves to the oil companies is

85
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,280
conservatively estimated at $75
million in revenue, which by law

86
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,380
would belong to the people who live there.

87
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,460
You know, I've been hearing this barber talk
since I was born, I can't take it anymore!

88
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,480
veiled implications,
baseless accusations.

89
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,800
What the hell does this have to
do with supporting my candidacy?

90
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,640
Have you met my opponent?

91
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,120
Hollister is poised to set
minority causes back a generation.

92
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,760
He has a 20-point lead in the polls.

93
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,260
Do you want to give your support to him?
All right

94
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm afraid he misunderstood what I said

95
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,360
No, no, that's fine.

96
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,840
Next time we see each other,
I'll be the one to trash his family.

97
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,100
It was a pleasure talking to you, David.

98
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,340
Two steps, four steps,
six steps and you will fly!

99
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,000
If you vote for Fowler,
you will always fly high!

100
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,840
Your Wife is preparing to fly.

101
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,360
We're separated.

102
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,360
-Where do you live now?
- In the apartment in Pontalba.

103
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
You've lived there too.

104
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,500
Run and take off
those damn sunglasses.

105
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,640
Why did you choose politics?

106
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,560
Should I ride a bus?

107
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,080
I don't know how to do it.

108
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,640
Do not be so hard on yourself.

109
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm sure you would make
a wonderful bus driver.

110
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
- Please, a scotch.
-Right away.

111
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
- Good, thanks

112
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:19,864
-Sorry for the delay.
-Anything.

113
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,320
-Chappy! -How are you, Cray?

114
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,120
-How are you?
- I'm going ahead Mr. Cray.

115
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,460
I appreciate everything he has
done, he is always nice to me.

116
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,260
- I heard you risk jail.
-I'm innocent

117
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,320
Do you want to have fun?
-No thanks!

118
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,800
"No thanks," the northern
assholes all say that!

119
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,900
Look at that stuff.

120
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,120
When is the trial?

121
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,680
tomorrow

122
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,900
I have a public defender
who can't keep his pants up.

123
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,160
Do you know I'm innocent?

124
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,160
I'll see what I can do.

125
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,200
Thank you she is always kind.
No one is better than her!

126
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,520
Come closer boy, look
at this doll with the snake.

127
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,020
Have you ever seen stuff like this?

128
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
-You want a drink?
-No.

129
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,380
What's your name?

130
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,580
Lee

131
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
Typical southern name.

132
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,280
Want to go somewhere?

133
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,520
Listen, Lee, my apartment is

134
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
only a couple of
blocks away, okay!

135
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,480
Big prick, I already gave you
the advance for this movie!

136
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,720
Wait 15 yards for the fans
and I can kick your ass.

137
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,360
Good luck, You say
that's the right title?

138
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,560
I don't care about
workers' rights!

139
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,400
Come on let's go shoot!

140
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,640
You get off your ass and don't piss me off!

141
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,020
-Where we are?
-In an Aikido gym.

142
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
take off your shoes.

143
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,560
Hey!

144
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,400
first lesson.

145
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,000
Always be prepared.

146
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,880
It's just growing your
wacky sense of humor, right?

147
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
Yup.

148
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,160
All right, wait a second.
- Counterattack.

149
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,940
Beat me.

150
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,280
I am a lawyer I think you should know.

151
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,600
There is no lesson if you don't fight.

152
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Yeah, well, I'm not in the
habit of fighting with girls.

153
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,720
Oh listen, if that's your idea of ​​foreplay.

154
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,560
Losing is inevitable, e

155
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,340
to be patient.

156
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,380
Lee!

157
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,200
-Hello Lieutenant!
-See you later.

158
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Damn!

159
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,320
We should have him deposed.
-Precautionary arrest is better.

160
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,500
- Let's sue him first.
-All right.

161
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,880
I gotta go, bye, cray?

162
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,200
Hey, Natalie.

163
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,480
I was coming to see you.

164
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,740
What happened to you?

165
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm a little sore today, I'm fine.

166
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,720
Looks like you've been struck by lightning.

167
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,380
Maybe it would have been better!.

168
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,960
I want to ask you
something lame with me

169
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,660
-How?
-It's not an excuse, let's go!

170
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,420
Do not rush.

171
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,960
So, how's your life going?

172
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,160
Awesome -Really?

173
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
Are you seeing anyone?

174
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,880
Legions!

175
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,980
what?

176
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Are they all satisfied?

177
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Craig, if you don't
mind, can we skip to

178
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,120
the part where you
tell me what you want?

179
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
I need access to some confidential documents.

180
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,280
You remember the civil suit against my family.

181
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,740
The Oxitec case.
-It has been archived.

182
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,320
All I know is what I read in the
paper, and that was three years ago.

183
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,820
All right.
But it is extremely important.

184
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,180
What do you want to know?

185
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,360
I would like to know why
my father killed himself.

186
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,700
Excuse me for saying this, but
you didn't seem interested at the time

187
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,640
I was always drunk during that time.

188
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
I suppose I can ask a few questions.

189
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,440
I appreciate it.

190
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,080
Maybe we can have dinner sometime.

191
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,120
Focus your energies
on politics, it's better

192
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,760
You are beautiful.

193
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,740
Damn!

194
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,740
All right, get the receipt.
Natalie, send it back to me.

195
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,580
Hey wait.

196
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,300
Is age starting to make itself felt?

197
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,420
Are you coming to my office?

198
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,820
This comes out today understood?

199
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,660
Why are you doing this to me?

200
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,580
I don't think you realize how
difficult the job we have here is.

201
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,500
I mean, it's hard enough trying to
run a modern election campaign.

202
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,520
... with the Paleolithic ideas
of your uncle and his friends.

203
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,620
what's more they refused to trust
me because they think I'm a yankee.

204
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,780
I'm from Tampa, for Christ's sake.

205
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,920
You have shaving foam on your ear

206
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,380
Every night we tear down those posters
and every morning they put them back up.

207
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,660
My latest polls say
Hollister is winning.

208
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,740
you look like shit, you know that?

209
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,320
Thank you.

210
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,600
We asked for a coffee.

211
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,020
There is more Good news

212
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,880
I feel slimy.
I was also at your wedding!

213
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,280
And then I hired a private
investigator who brought us these.

214
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,140
-Do you want coffee?
-Hi Melanie, how are you?

215
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,480
Well, I hope I'm not interrupting.

216
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Ninth. Ninth.

217
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,300
Same old stuff, Politics.

218
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,980
Honey, I need to talk to you.

219
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,900
Um, I've thought long and
hard about this, and it wasn't

220
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,420
an easy decision, and I'd
love to hear your reaction.

221
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,940
Ah, what is it?

222
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,180
I decided to go with the convertible.

223
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,860
Convertible?

224
00:22:35,884 --> 00:22:37,476
Convertible I would

225
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,860
like Calypso red

226
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,420
with anthracite interior
and electric soft top.

227
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,500
maybe even the phone. -Certain!

228
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,220
I was thinking, what do I
need a phone for in the car?

229
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,100
But then I realized,
Hey, when you win the

230
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,820
election, it's going to
come in really handy.

231
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,540
It makes sense to me, so let's go.

232
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,700
Oh good.

233
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,180
We have that thing

234
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,540
Let's go or we'll be late.

235
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,620
Yes I'm sorry.

236
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,960
I have to run, be good!
-All right

237
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,280
So see you later.

238
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,760
Anyway, darling, if it's okay.

239
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,200
They have a car ready
at the dealership. I

240
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,640
was wondering if I could
have a check, please.

241
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,440
- yes in the afternoon.

242
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,920
All right.

243
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,200
Magnificent.

244
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Love.

245
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,160
Well, huh? Yup.

246
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,320
Why do you limp?

247
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,080
No, I pulled a muscle
on the massage table.

248
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,480
You bad boy.

249
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Now be careful.

250
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,640
I like that color, That is

251
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
calypso, Red.

252
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,440
Let's get out of here. -Kisses.

253
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Courage! Beat!

254
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,520
Beat!

255
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,600
Push, push, push.

256
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,900
We got off on the wrong foot
and I'm sorry for how I reacted.

257
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,520
I tell you the truth, I would have been a lot

258
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,160
surprised if you didn't have

259
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,520
questions about my family.

260
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,280
Nathan, I need your support.

261
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,200
I don't think I can
be elected without it.

262
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,080
And I don't see how Abner
Hollister is a viable alternative for you.

263
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,120
Not even I'm so sure you are.

264
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,140
try me.

265
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
you know you are arrogant!

266
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,560
What did you tell my father
about those concessions?

267
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,820
To check its validity at
the mining commission

268
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,500
Tiresome?

269
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,820
That if we could just apply
a little technology to these

270
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,740
documents, we could be a lot
more efficient in this department.

271
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,620
They keep saying they will transfer
these volumes to computer files.

272
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,060
They can't even afford to
immunize children against polio.

273
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,660
Do you think this is a priority?

274
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,860
I'm interested in 1939, 1949.
-Yes.

275
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,780
Mining sector.

276
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,020
We see.

277
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,340
Let's see, let's see.

278
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,060
You know, I could drop dead in here.

279
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,980
They wouldn't find me for a month.

280
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,020
Very strange. -There is not!

281
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,460
Nope, they're missing

282
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,420
1939 and 40.

283
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,100
Who can have taken them?

284
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,940
It is our official government register.

285
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,500
They are not checked.

286
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,220
Could it have been mislaid by me?

287
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:03,220
But if they did, they might as well
have fallen into the Bermuda Triangle.

288
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,580
Craig Fowler was a
brilliant public defender.

289
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,540
Craig Fowler was very good at his job.

290
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,020
Craig Fowler has kept more clients
out of jail than anyone else in town

291
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,940
so they could get right back to
doing what they were good at.

292
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,460
Now Craig Fowler wants
to go to Washington.

293
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,300
Even decent people need representation.

294
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,860
The timing is right.

295
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,700
Hollister for Congress.

296
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,880
Now it's our turn.

297
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,380
He doesn't care about African American votes.

298
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,660
On the bright side, your support
among convicted felons is virtually 100%.

299
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,180
That guy is a fucking pig.

300
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,860
A pig with a 20-point lead, yes.

301
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:42,636
How did we get that tape?

302
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,580
We have a friend at his headquarters.

303
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,740
Fuck you, Mark Hollister.

304
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,300
It's an accident waiting to happen.

305
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,940
I bet on it

306
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,940
Even money the 10:00
news might find our boy

307
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,100
cross-eyed in bed with a
troupe of circus midgets

308
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,820
and a green monkey
who is under accusation.

309
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,940
And on Election Day,
his margin of victory

310
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,180
wouldn't fall below
a giraffe's boobs.

311
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,260
Well done, old chap!
See you at the restaurant.

312
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,260
I almost forgot I have a present for you.

313
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,260
The governor gave me this.

314
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,900
But don't make a fuss

315
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,860
If you put nicotine on it.... Cray!
-Sorry for the delay.

316
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,220
Oh, you're not late.
You are just on time.

317
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,340
I arrived early.
Do you know Avner Hollister?

318
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,460
I think we met at
the Endymion Ball.

319
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,620
But I sure remember.

320
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,580
Bennett Jones, my very
capable campaign manager.

321
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,980
You probably don't remember me.
-No.

322
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,620
I know I haven't seen you
since you were so high.

323
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,180
OPD Lieutenant Michael Trevallian.

324
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,500
You know, this is my man in
charge of campaign security.

325
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,960
It is an honor.

326
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,660
Then how about we
move on to the logistics of

327
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,060
the debate, and all you
have to do is just slap

328
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,840
one of these on your car and
come see me in DC next month.

329
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,480
Opening statements.

330
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,500
We were thinking about 5 minutes
per candidate and questions to...

331
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,800
- Pudge.
- huh? Thank you.

332
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,800
It's the first time I've been here since...

333
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
..from the day of the accident.

334
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,400
Didn't he tell you anything?

335
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,000
No.

336
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,000
The colonel taught us to hunt.

337
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,980
I used to come here with your
father when you were a kid.

338
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,280
- Gentlemen, the bar is open.
-All right.

339
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,420
It's not the same anymore.

340
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,020
Are you thinking about your old man?

341
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,700
But sometimes

342
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,080
you can't know what's
on a man's mind.

343
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,860
The most cursed truth you will ever meet.

344
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,980
You can't know why a

345
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,820
man does what he does.

346
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,500
Do you know any reason why
he would be afraid to testify?

347
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,620
I do not know.

348
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,980
Ray was a good businessman.

349
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:08,076
He was tough.

350
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,560
But he knew how to play honestly and fairly.

351
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,940
But they have opened an investigation.
And the grandfather?

352
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,000
In the 1930s the colonel
worked for Oxytech.

353
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,360
He procured the oil
concessions. He was a good man.

354
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,620
- They say he defrauded them.
- Bullshit!

355
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,160
They were ignorant, they thought it
was unproductive land and they sold it.

356
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,900
The colonel grew up here.

357
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,580
Eight kids in one room.

358
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,740
He lifted himself out of the
swamp with his own hands.

359
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,180
For us, for the family.
He did it for us.

360
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,740
And there are people who
will hate you just out of spite.

361
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,560
People hate those who win.

362
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,260
And he took his own life.

363
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,340
I swore I would try to
be a good father to you.

364
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,020
He was innocent.

365
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,460
And they haunted him to the grave.

366
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,700
And any man who
tries to harm this house

367
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,820
he will pay dearly!

368
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,820
Promise me that you will

369
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,580
come to me in any problem.

370
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,860
Promise me?

371
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,940
(tv) The terrible hurricane
Arthur hit the coasts...

372
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,640
-Hello Mom.
-Cray, I'm glad to see you!

373
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,020
All right, then?
You should be happy

374
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,420
I'm fine.

375
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,340
Yup.

376
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,140
(tv) The situation will
not be resolved quickly

377
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,860
As you see...

378
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,600
Did you see that beautiful girl?

379
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:58,324
It's me, I was presenting
the weather forecast.

380
00:32:58,348 --> 00:33:01,548
The colonel was the
master of the station.

381
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,900
we had that terrible hurricane.

382
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,980
People have lost everything.

383
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,020
Terrible, terrible tragedy.

384
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,140
I was on the air for 5 hours.

385
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,140
Mom?

386
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Do you know when dad died?

387
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,980
did he have any documents?

388
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Or he had a secret place

389
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Things he didn't

390
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,440
want people to see.

391
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,340
Yes. In fact he…

392
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,900
he had a special place.

393
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,460
Who is he?

394
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,420
come up.

395
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,420
I'm sorry, I didn't
know that, sorry.

396
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,660
-I beg you...

397
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,684
Don't move, we need an ambulance.

398
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,960
No, no, my father filmed us.

399
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,900
Thing?

400
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,112
He filmed us making love.

401
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,960
What?

402
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,040
Did your father film us?

403
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,152
-You knew it?
-I came to warn you.

404
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,240
What's your father's name?

405
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,600
Xang.

406
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,420
Someone paid for it.

407
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,440
Who paid for it?

408
00:36:51,464 --> 00:36:53,464
I am sorry!

409
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,500
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

410
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,100
I have to leave the city.

411
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,540
Do you want to leave the city?

412
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,980
How much for the tapes?

413
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,860
Where is the box? At the gym?

414
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,060
The...

415
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,720
Help me!
I can't go back there alone.

416
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,480
She will kill me.

417
00:37:44,236 --> 00:37:46,176
Let's start.

418
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,240
In life you also have to have fun!
Let's have a party.

419
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Here you are...

420
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,640
Get ready Brandy, here
comes the boogeyman!

421
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,560
We tie a few knots
and get to work.

422
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,180
Put on handcuffs.
I want to hear you scream.

423
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,600
Ready? MOANS

424
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,400
Don't you have the keys?

425
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,100
Do you like my daughter?
Did you fuck her?

426
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,300
Shit!

427
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,000
-Have you seen anyone?
-Who was I supposed to see?

428
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,800
Ready?

429
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:39,224
How is my favorite candidate?

430
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,500
Uncle Cliff!

431
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:43,524
There is something wrong?

432
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:44,648
Anything.

433
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
I heard you called me

434
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,700
What happens?

435
00:42:50,724 --> 00:42:52,624
I wanted to ask you...

436
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,380
...if you know what time we
have to tour the factory tomorrow.

437
00:42:57,404 --> 00:43:00,004
At 11.00, then we will go to the rest home.

438
00:43:00,028 --> 00:43:02,028
At 11.00 it is true.

439
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,900
Did you forget about it?

440
00:43:03,924 --> 00:43:05,624
No, I just wanted to check.

441
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,260
Excuse me, I'm distracted.

442
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:11,684
Are you sure you're okay?

443
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:14,308
Relax.

444
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,500
It's all right. -Are you sure?

445
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:17,624
yes I'm fine.

446
00:43:17,648 --> 00:43:19,648
Go to sleep, tomorrow
a great day awaits you.

447
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,040
Already!

448
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,900
What's this tuna smell?

449
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:13,624
Cray! What are you doing around here?

450
00:44:13,648 --> 00:44:16,248
Does your lunch break always last three hours?

451
00:44:16,272 --> 00:44:18,972
Nothing has changed!

452
00:44:18,996 --> 00:44:20,196
come to me

453
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,720
The walls are still dirty.

454
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,520
I forgot about this luxury.

455
00:44:24,544 --> 00:44:26,544
What a fop!

456
00:44:26,568 --> 00:44:28,968
If I had known that you would reach
the top, I would have been less harsh!

457
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,680
I was a bad lawyer

458
00:44:31,704 --> 00:44:35,104
That's not true, the problem is that...

459
00:44:35,128 --> 00:44:38,028
..you have to work harder to
show that you are not "daddy's boy".

460
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:42,252
If you had warned me, I would
have bought you lunch. do you want?

461
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:43,676
No.

462
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,800
Have you had a bout of nostalgia?
I can not believe!

463
00:44:47,824 --> 00:44:50,224
I'm interested in a case.

464
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:01,000
Lee, my name is Cray Fowler,
I'm a lawyer and I will defend you.

465
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,000
How are you feeling? do they treat you well?

466
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Do you need something?

467
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,280
What did you say?

468
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,980
Anything.

469
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,980
Not even the other lawyer?
To nobody?

470
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,440
Why do you do this?

471
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Do you want to tell me what happened?

472
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,160
I've heard rumors.

473
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,860
I've seen him and I've seen you.

474
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,200
I thought you were dead!

475
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:58,224
I have the knife!

476
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Which knife?

477
00:46:04,024 --> 00:46:06,024
Didn't you use a knife?

478
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,740
do you think i killed him?

479
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,320
I haven't even touched it.

480
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,380
Maybe it's possible, maybe
not, you just have to wait.

481
00:46:35,404 --> 00:46:37,404
Thanks for the favor.

482
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,428
I'm busy, I'll call you.

483
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Hello. Was it useful to you?

484
00:46:42,824 --> 00:46:44,824
In fact, it's best that you don't tell me.

485
00:46:44,848 --> 00:46:46,848
All right, I won't tell you.

486
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:48,872
I know you have a murder case.

487
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,640
Only one?

488
00:46:51,664 --> 00:46:53,664
A Vietnamese girl: Lee Trang.

489
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Yup.

490
00:46:57,144 --> 00:46:58,644
Are you in favor of a deal?

491
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:00,468
I had thought about it.

492
00:47:01,192 --> 00:47:02,192
Already!

493
00:47:02,216 --> 00:47:04,216
I'll defend her and go to court.

494
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
I wanted you to know from me.

495
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
It's nothing personal,
it's a coincidence.

496
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
You haven't been involved in criminal cases for three years.

497
00:47:18,424 --> 00:47:20,424
I have to recover!

498
00:47:20,448 --> 00:47:22,448
You have already lost.

499
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,472
Could be!

500
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:26,496
It's not a game I'm a tough guy!

501
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,520
No one knows better than me.

502
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
See you, Natalie.

503
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
Thanks for seeing me, Nathan.

504
00:47:47,944 --> 00:47:49,944
What can I do for you?

505
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:51,968
I've been to the Mining Office...

506
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,780
..and I found something
that may be of interest to you.

507
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Do you know these names?

508
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:02,144
Why should they?

509
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:04,668
They are the holders of the
lands of the district of St.Albans...

510
00:48:04,692 --> 00:48:06,692
..those who have
agreed with Oxytech.

511
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
Maybe they were friends of the colonel.

512
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,180
I checked the corporate records
and the Oxytech responsible list.

513
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:23,000
I've done research, but no one
knows about them. Are you interested?

514
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
Maybe.

515
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,680
Another thing...

516
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,040
If you were available, I would like to
take advantage of your experience...

517
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,620
..to tackle the defense
of a murder case together.

518
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,120
Cost a lot.

519
00:48:52,144 --> 00:48:54,144
I know it.

520
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,080
Who is the prosecution?

521
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:00,104
Natalie Tate.

522
00:49:00,128 --> 00:49:02,160
It's a tough one!

523
00:49:02,184 --> 00:49:04,184
I know, she was my wife!

524
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,720
This is a joke, right?

525
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:10,744
No it is not.

526
00:49:10,768 --> 00:49:14,768
Damn!
How did you come up with it?

527
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,840
It's not that bad...

528
00:49:18,864 --> 00:49:20,864
Hollister is killing us.

529
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:22,888
Who won't vote for him?

530
00:49:22,912 --> 00:49:25,112
Ethnic minorities, white collar
workers and the middle class.

531
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:29,436
Is there a better way to convince
them that I have their interests at heart?

532
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,200
Despite my high-ranking
origins, I defend one of them...

533
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:36,324
..perhaps falsely
accused of murder.

534
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,820
How much free
publicity will it bring us?

535
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,520
News opening service every
evening while the trial lasts.

536
00:49:47,544 --> 00:49:51,144
This is a great idea!
Cray is a genius.

537
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:53,168
No!

538
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,480
Did you do it all by yourself?

539
00:49:57,504 --> 00:49:59,504
It's unbelievable but true.

540
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,480
LaFleur assists me on defense.

541
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,504
Cliff, shall we have a Pimm's Cup?

542
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,592
Of course.

543
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,700
Nathan LaFleur!

544
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,600
Good! moisten your
lips and look into the lens.

545
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,080
Make a mean look.

546
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:45,104
Now put your arms up
and show those big boobs!

547
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,320
Perfect! Now let's change position.

548
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:51,644
Lean forward. Moreover!

549
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,980
Good, touch the nipples.

550
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,760
Magnificent!
Now she rests a hand on the chair.

551
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,660
Spread your legs,
show the wares!

552
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,240
You are very good!

553
00:51:09,264 --> 00:51:11,264
Now stand up and put
one foot on the chair.

554
00:51:11,288 --> 00:51:13,288
Push with your heel. Perfect!

555
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
Now look at me and start touching you.

556
00:51:18,904 --> 00:51:20,904
Nice!

557
00:51:20,928 --> 00:51:22,928
Wait a minute, I have to go to the bathroom.

558
00:51:22,952 --> 00:51:24,952
Remember you're paid by the hour?

559
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:26,976
I know it!

560
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Hurry up!

561
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,080
Hey!

562
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:38,049
Abe!

563
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,320
Hey!

564
00:51:42,344 --> 00:51:44,344
What are you doing in my studio?

565
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,368
I'm Cray Fowler. I represent Lee Trang.

566
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:50,392
Is it Mr. Choate? Is he pronounced like that?

567
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,640
He spells my dick!

568
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,920
The door was open.

569
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:57,944
Then close it when you leave!

570
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,400
Go fuck yourself out of here!

571
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,520
Her name is Brandy.

572
00:52:19,544 --> 00:52:21,544
I do not know her.

573
00:52:21,568 --> 00:52:24,468
Look for it. There's
$50 to find it.

574
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,480
What do I say? Why would I be looking for it?

575
00:52:27,504 --> 00:52:29,504
Say you're in love.

576
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,880
Mr. Cray, why does he
want to get dirty with this shit?

577
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,760
Great question! See you.

578
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,280
Offer me something to drink.

579
00:52:40,304 --> 00:52:42,304
I just gave you $50!

580
00:52:42,328 --> 00:52:44,328
Right!

581
00:52:44,352 --> 00:52:46,352
I tried!

582
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,960
Is there anyone?

583
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I found the key in my pocket.

584
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,860
What do you want?

585
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,680
Just have a drink.

586
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,040
What an impression!
She is identical to me.

587
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,080
No, it's completely different.

588
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,660
Don't you drink?

589
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:57,321
I thought you were going
to change that couch.

590
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
You said you would do it.

591
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,940
What is this story?
It's not an advertising gimmick.

592
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,200
I know you're not that cynical yet?

593
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,740
Advertising has nothing to do with it.

594
00:55:18,764 --> 00:55:20,764
You do it to impress me.

595
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,600
I don't need these tricks.

596
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:26,424
So what's the purpose?

597
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,848
Is it just a good deed?

598
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,600
Or did you sleep with it?

599
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,200
Anything you say will be
used against you in court.

600
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,140
It has nothing to do with us.

601
00:55:44,164 --> 00:55:45,764
I didn't think there was a "we" yet.

602
00:55:45,788 --> 00:55:46,788
There is not.

603
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:48,012
Thanks for the clarity.

604
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,920
Mr. Flower, we are
violating professional ethics.

605
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,200
Cheap tactics, Prosecutor.

606
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,320
Report me.

607
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,040
Natalie, act like a lady!

608
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:48,580
I hope you are prepared
to get your butt kicked!

609
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,580
If I lose, you'll buy me dinner.

610
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:57,604
You've already had a chance to bargain.

611
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,680
Leave the key.

612
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:02,104
It's on the cabinet.

613
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,480
Friends of the Democratic Party...

614
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,900
..before storming this
magnificent dinner that cost me...

615
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:25,224
..more than the $1500
you paid to park the cars...

616
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,400
..Cray's mother will say
the prayer of thanks for us.

617
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,960
Lord, we ask your blessing for
the gifts we are about to receive.

618
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,880
Help us appreciate
your generosity...

619
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,900
..and to sing your Glory.

620
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,400
Show us the way...

621
00:57:56,424 --> 00:58:01,624
..and guide our steps to you
with kindness and firmness.

622
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,780
And may your strength
sustain us in times of weakness.

623
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,600
Merciful Lord, let us become...

624
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,580
..instruments of your will...

625
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:16,604
Amen - amen!

626
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,760
Taste.

627
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,760
It tastes like the forbidden!

628
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,280
If they gave me a dollar for
each dinner, I'd bear them better.

629
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,300
Come to think of it, I
make a lot more out of it!

630
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,500
A politician's hardest
job is to convince voters...

631
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,524
..that you are one of them.

632
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,200
Being at their service is one
thing, socializing is another!

633
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,600
It seems you have more
important things to think about.

634
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,300
Worried about Hollister?

635
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:07,324
We should all care about it.

636
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
It's dangerous, I know.

637
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,640
You're in the ring
with a low blower.

638
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,880
Have you discovered anything?

639
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,120
He was one of the
managers of Oxytech.

640
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:30,340
Good! What does this suggest to you?

641
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:35,000
The oil concessions?
Is Hollister involved too?

642
00:59:35,024 --> 00:59:38,024
The information must be
used to your advantage.

643
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:45,200
In Vietnam, Hollister
was leading a team...

644
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,700
..a team of Green Berets.

645
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,400
When he returned
there was a lot of talk...

646
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,200
..about the atrocities he committed.

647
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,100
It is true?

648
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:02,424
It does not matter.

649
01:00:02,448 --> 01:00:03,848
Do you still want to use this information?

650
01:00:03,872 --> 01:00:08,972
You have to ask yourself,
"How far do I want to go?"

651
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,100
This is the decisive moment.

652
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,400
Cray, you are now
standing in front of a door...

653
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,800
..asking you to open it.

654
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:30,100
If you open it and go beyond it
and accept what life offers you...

655
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:34,224
..you will never regret
the price you had to pay.

656
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,200
Now I will tell you how I see things.

657
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:45,900
I predict two terms in
Congress, maybe even three.

658
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,200
Then you will march to the
seat of Governor of the state...

659
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,920
..to occupy the place that awaits you.

660
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,560
You are your father's son...

661
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,400
..you are a Fowler!

662
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,400
From those swamps full of malaria...

663
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,600
..up to the throne of power
in just two generations!

664
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,800
And perhaps this will only be the beginning!

665
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,400
Cray! Sit down! Hug old Pudge.

666
01:01:36,424 --> 01:01:39,124
My life is a mess!

667
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,300
I wanted you as a son.
I've known you since you were little.

668
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,000
What exactly is your job about?

669
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:49,524
I specialize in PDQs.

670
01:01:49,548 --> 01:01:50,948
What would that be?

671
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:53,372
"A little bit of this
and a little bit of that."

672
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,720
Seriously, do you want to
know what my great talent is?

673
01:01:57,744 --> 01:02:01,644
Make people feel good,
make them feel important.

674
01:02:01,668 --> 01:02:05,568
It is the fundamental quality
of politicians' assistants.

675
01:02:05,592 --> 01:02:06,892
Attention!

676
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,800
A moment ago I was just
thinking of you and Raymond!

677
01:02:12,824 --> 01:02:16,824
Do you remember that before he died
he built the house for the hummingbirds?

678
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,200
Constance!

679
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,600
A great party, right?

680
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:37,000
People think I'm
an old chatterbox.

681
01:02:37,024 --> 01:02:39,024
But it's not true.

682
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,100
I am a historian.

683
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,940
You said a friend gave us
the Hollister promo video.

684
01:02:51,964 --> 01:02:53,964
A man who plays a double game.

685
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,400
A very helpful man.

686
01:02:58,424 --> 01:03:01,524
I wouldn't do anything that
could endanger the situation.

687
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,640
Already!

688
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,340
It's the security
officer: Trevallian.

689
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,300
Please don't tell anyone.

690
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,080
Relax.

691
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
(A moment ago I was thinking
about you and Raymond.)

692
01:03:46,024 --> 01:03:50,324
(Do you remember that before he
died he built 'the cult for hummingbirds?)

693
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,960
St Albans Baptist Church.

694
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,040
Reverend, we spoke on
the phone. I'm Cray Fowler.

695
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,200
I know you, you will be our
congressional representative.

696
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:44,924
I hope so!
This place is very beautiful.

697
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:49,248
It's just a small congregation.
Money is tight.

698
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,700
"Brother, help yourself
that God helps you."

699
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,960
You rarely see people
like her around here.

700
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:06,040
Remember my father?
His name was Raymond.

701
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,040
I'm talking about many years ago.

702
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:10,764
Yes sure!

703
01:05:10,788 --> 01:05:14,888
Raymond Fowler!
He once he came to see me.

704
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:19,012
He wanted information
about some parishioners.

705
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,400
Can you take a look
at this list of names?

706
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,900
Yes, it's them.

707
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,760
They were peasants, sons of freed slaves.

708
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,220
They had received land under sharecropping.

709
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,400
This is the second generation.

710
01:05:44,424 --> 01:05:47,724
They've been breaking
their backs all their lives.

711
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,300
What about this? C. Sumpter.

712
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,180
If I see you around
here, I'll kill you!

713
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,700
Get out of the way! Let's go

714
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,320
I made love with him, then he
said his father had shot a video.

715
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:27,944
He had hit her.
I went looking for the tape.

716
01:07:27,968 --> 01:07:31,268
The father beat me to death.
When I came to he was dead.

717
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,480
A few days ago the man
who paid Xang sent me this.

718
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,160
You have shamefully
violated all ethics!

719
01:07:48,184 --> 01:07:50,884
And you dragged
me into the filth too!

720
01:07:50,908 --> 01:07:53,908
If you help me, you will pay off.

721
01:07:53,932 --> 01:07:55,532
Which?

722
01:07:55,556 --> 01:07:56,756
A man in congress.

723
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,700
You are the practical type.

724
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,440
All right...

725
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,800
We need to find out whose
prints are on this knife.

726
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,600
I think it's all related
to concessions.

727
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,960
Even if I don't know how.

728
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,700
Someone wants to scare me.
Maybe it's Hollister.

729
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,600
Hollister?

730
01:08:39,624 --> 01:08:41,624
He's on the Oxytech
board of directors.

731
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,100
If he has the tape, why
hasn't he used it yet?

732
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:49,124
I think he just did.

733
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,740
You were telling me that a man on the
list isn't buried in St Albans cemetery.

734
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,100
C. Sumpter.

735
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,200
What time did she go
to work that evening

736
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,300
At 10.00

737
01:09:12,324 --> 01:09:16,124
Can you see the palace of the
Ancient Dragon from his window?

738
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,680
Yes, very good.

739
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,240
Did you see the accused arrive that evening?

740
01:09:24,264 --> 01:09:26,664
I didn't see her coming...

741
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,680
..but I saw her leave
the building at 11.45.

742
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,360
What impression did she make on her?

743
01:09:31,384 --> 01:09:33,384
Impression?

744
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,640
She seemed to be in a hurry, she was running!

745
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,660
Miss Johnson, what
is your first name?

746
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,940
Domit Jo.

747
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:50,520
Did you see anyone enter or
exit after Lee but before the police?

748
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,080
Yes, a man.

749
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,060
Can you describe it?

750
01:09:56,084 --> 01:09:58,784
He was wearing a black raincoat.

751
01:09:58,808 --> 01:10:00,408
Was he tall or short?

752
01:10:02,321 --> 01:10:04,321
Quite low.

753
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,700
Did you hear any noise or
music coming from upstairs?

754
01:10:08,724 --> 01:10:12,424
Loud music from the place
where the porn films are played.

755
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,320
just before Lee ran out.

756
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,140
Mr. Choate, what did you
hear at 11.30 that night?

757
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:25,200
It was hot and I had the door open, I
heard someone coming up the stairs.

758
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,000
Just one person?

759
01:10:27,024 --> 01:10:31,124
Yes, then I heard rumors of a fight.

760
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,560
Did he recognize them?

761
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,600
Yes it was Lee and the old man of him.

762
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,400
Did he call the police?

763
01:10:41,424 --> 01:10:43,424
Yes I wanted some peace.

764
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,700
Then what happened?

765
01:10:45,724 --> 01:10:49,524
I heard noise and then silence.

766
01:10:49,548 --> 01:10:53,148
I went out and saw the
girl coming down the stairs.

767
01:10:53,172 --> 01:10:54,372
Have you seen her?

768
01:10:54,396 --> 01:10:56,396
Yes but she was running away.

769
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,820
I thought it was all weird
and something happened.

770
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,600
By instinct?

771
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:03,824
Yup.

772
01:11:03,848 --> 01:11:08,748
Then I went down to wait for the
police and we went up to check.

773
01:11:08,772 --> 01:11:12,772
We found the "yellow".... dead!

774
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,920
Thank you, Mr. Choate

775
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,144
Are you all right, Mr. Choate?

776
01:11:22,168 --> 01:11:23,168
Very good.

777
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:24,192
Magnificent!

778
01:11:24,216 --> 01:11:28,616
When he went up, was there something
wrong with the door to the gymnasium?

779
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,640
Yes it was open.

780
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,440
Did he notice that the glass was
broken and there was blood in it?

781
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,640
Yup.

782
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:43,280
He said he was staying in his
study and heard someone arguing.

783
01:11:43,304 --> 01:11:46,404
So why didn't you hear
the sound of glass breaking?

784
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,200
I don't know, I had the radio on.

785
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,300
It's true, the music was
heard even in the street!

786
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,100
Was she very tall?

787
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:56,824
Yes I like it that way.

788
01:11:56,848 --> 01:11:59,348
But she could hear voices.

789
01:11:59,372 --> 01:12:01,072
I had turned down the volume.

790
01:12:01,096 --> 01:12:02,196
At what time?

791
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,320
At 11.30.

792
01:12:03,344 --> 01:12:06,544
According to Miss Johnson it was 11.45.

793
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,160
Maybe I looked at the clock wrong.

794
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,800
Do you often hear loud music?

795
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,720
When I work.

796
01:12:16,744 --> 01:12:20,944
Is he a photographer? What kind of
photography does he specialize in?

797
01:12:20,968 --> 01:12:23,768
Portraits, weddings, communions?

798
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,920
I do artistic poses,
especially nudes.

799
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:31,044
Does he work with models?

800
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,700
They are certainly not my self-portraits!

801
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,520
Let's see if I understand correctly,
he was at his desk doing the math...

802
01:12:39,544 --> 01:12:44,244
..and to concentrate better
he listened to loud music.

803
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,400
But it wasn't so tall that she couldn't
hear someone coming up the stairs...

804
01:12:48,424 --> 01:12:51,824
..and arguing
upstairs in Vietnamese.

805
01:12:51,848 --> 01:12:56,548
Then she decided to call the police because
she wanted to settle accounts in peace!

806
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,240
Is it forbidden to listen to music?

807
01:13:00,264 --> 01:13:03,664
No, but it is forbidden to bear false witness.

808
01:13:03,688 --> 01:13:05,288
Objection, intimidates the witness.

809
01:13:05,312 --> 01:13:06,612
I'll change the subject.

810
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,300
Was he alone that night?

811
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,960
Only.

812
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,940
Miss Johnson saw a short
man in a raincoat come out.

813
01:13:23,964 --> 01:13:25,964
I don't think it was her.

814
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,800
Thank you, Mr. Choate.
I have no further questions.

815
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,080
The court adjourns until tomorrow.

816
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,200
We have to take a trip
he is my cousin Thaddeus.

817
01:13:41,224 --> 01:13:42,824
Salutations.

818
01:13:42,848 --> 01:13:44,848
A bodyguard comes in handy.

819
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,840
By signing the transfer deeds...

820
01:13:47,864 --> 01:13:50,664
..they gave up
profits for exploitation.

821
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,800
In return they got some money.

822
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,500
A pittance in exchange
for their silence.

823
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,100
Good morning.

824
01:14:04,124 --> 01:14:06,124
Hello.

825
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,500
Where is he?

826
01:14:08,524 --> 01:14:10,024
In that shack.

827
01:14:10,048 --> 01:14:12,148
Hello Mr. LaFleur.

828
01:14:12,172 --> 01:14:13,672
Hi Andy, how are you?

829
01:14:13,696 --> 01:14:15,496
Charlie is waiting for her.

830
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,980
Mr. Sumpter?

831
01:14:18,004 --> 01:14:19,104
Forward.

832
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:25,000
Someone wants to talk
to you, Mr. Cray Fowler.

833
01:14:25,024 --> 01:14:26,724
How is he?

834
01:14:26,748 --> 01:14:28,748
Nice to meet you.

835
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
My eyes don't work anymore.

836
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,160
I'm told you are very rich.

837
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,100
I get money every month.

838
01:14:38,124 --> 01:14:40,124
What do you know about that money?

839
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,400
They come in an envelope.

840
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,700
$300 in cash.

841
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,620
It all started in
September 1939.

842
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,660
What did she do for a living?

843
01:14:52,684 --> 01:14:54,484
I was a gamekeeper.

844
01:14:54,508 --> 01:14:56,208
I quit because of the view.

845
01:14:56,232 --> 01:14:58,232
Do you know who sends you the money?

846
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,200
I know nothing.

847
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,420
If anyone bothers to
send me $300 a month...

848
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,920
..why should I ask questions?

849
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,460
Do you remember
how this story began?

850
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,660
Has anyone come here?
Did they make you sign a card?

851
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,320
A young white man.

852
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,100
He said he worked in a bank.

853
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,160
He went hunting with me.

854
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,820
Does he remember his name?

855
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,100
He didn't tell me.

856
01:15:32,124 --> 01:15:33,824
Did he tell her what he was signing?

857
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,760
A notarized deed
for my property.

858
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,800
He said that from that moment it was all mine.

859
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,200
Would he recognize
him if he saw him today?

860
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,100
I don't even see the television!

861
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,200
Thank you.

862
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,710
See you.

863
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,100
Is very strange...

864
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:07,800
Another white man asked me the
same questions three years ago.

865
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,320
What was his name?

866
01:16:14,272 --> 01:16:16,272
We see...

867
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:22,600
It seems to me that his
name was Raymond, yes!

868
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,800
Thank you.

869
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,840
The prosecution calls
Lt. Michael Trevallian.

870
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,300
I hate you!

871
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,700
Look here.
FOWLER WINS IN THE POLLS

872
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,600
Lieutenant Trevallian, can you
describe how the defendant was arrested?

873
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,340
Of course.

874
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:18,600
When I arrived Mr. Choate
took me upstairs.

875
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,500
I went in and saw
the victim's body.

876
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:28,400
Once the death was ascertained, I
requested the arrest of the accused.

877
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,300
Did you order her to be
taken to the crime scene?

878
01:17:32,324 --> 01:17:33,524
Yup.

879
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:37,348
She was stopped at the station and
taken to the gymnasium within the hour.

880
01:17:37,372 --> 01:17:42,572
What did the defendant say
when you saw her father's body?

881
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:47,100
He said three times:
"It's all my fault."

882
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Did she say it spontaneously?

883
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
That's right, and she said it three times.

884
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,200
Lawyer...

885
01:17:56,224 --> 01:17:57,424
Lieutenant...

886
01:17:57,448 --> 01:18:01,448
She was off duty when
Mr. Choate's report came.

887
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,200
I was driving home.

888
01:18:05,224 --> 01:18:08,624
I had the radio on
and I heard the call.

889
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,700
It's common for a homicide lieutenant...

890
01:18:11,724 --> 01:18:13,924
..respond to a complaint
about disturbing the peace?

891
01:18:13,948 --> 01:18:15,348
No!

892
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:21,200
But I was just in that
area and I'm still a cop!

893
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,600
Didn't they tell you there was already a patrol?

894
01:18:24,624 --> 01:18:25,924
No, I didn't talk...

895
01:18:25,948 --> 01:18:27,648
..with the Central.

896
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,400
Did you know the victim?

897
01:18:29,424 --> 01:18:30,724
Absolutely not.

898
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,040
Had he ever been to the
Ancient Dragon gym before?

899
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,700
No, I'm not familiar
with elder dragons.

900
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,300
According to the report,
no fingerprints were taken.

901
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,600
It wasn't necessary.

902
01:18:46,624 --> 01:18:48,624
Does this seem like a regular procedure to you?

903
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,800
The suspect had been seen
by more than one witness...

904
01:18:53,824 --> 01:18:57,024
..and he had confessed.

905
01:18:57,048 --> 01:18:58,748
He said, "Did I kill him?"

906
01:18:58,772 --> 01:19:00,572
He said, "It's all my fault."

907
01:19:00,596 --> 01:19:02,596
He said, "Did I kill him?"

908
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:04,620
He didn't use those words.

909
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,400
"It's all my fault" can be
interpreted in another way.

910
01:19:08,424 --> 01:19:09,524
No.

911
01:19:09,548 --> 01:19:13,648
There were signs of forced entry
and you found blood on the door.

912
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,680
According to Miss Johnson,
another person exited the building.

913
01:19:19,704 --> 01:19:23,304
You don't investigate because someone says, "Is this all my fault?"

914
01:19:23,328 --> 01:19:25,328
Ninth!

915
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,900
We have made regular inquiries…

916
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,440
..but nothing relevant emerged.

917
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,200
Lieutenant, there was someone else up there that night.

918
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,700
I haven't found any clues.

919
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:48,300
You must understand that a crime
of this nature among those people...

920
01:19:48,324 --> 01:19:50,924
..not unusual at all.

921
01:19:50,948 --> 01:19:52,648
What does she mean?

922
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,600
The Vietnamese.

923
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:57,524
I know he served in Vietnam.

924
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,100
Were you in the Marines?

925
01:20:00,124 --> 01:20:01,624
In the Green Berets.

926
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,200
Who was its commander?

927
01:20:04,224 --> 01:20:05,724
Objection, it is not relevant.

928
01:20:05,748 --> 01:20:07,048
Attorney Fowler?

929
01:20:07,072 --> 01:20:08,872
I don't know yet.

930
01:20:08,896 --> 01:20:10,496
She answers the question.

931
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:13,520
Sure, Major Hollister.

932
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,320
Major Avner Hollister
sitting here in the courtroom?

933
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,200
That's right, you are well informed.

934
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,600
I have no more questions.

935
01:20:23,624 --> 01:20:25,624
The witness can withdraw.

936
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,100
The court adjourns
at 9.00 tomorrow.

937
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,900
The defense may present his witnesses.

938
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,900
Things are going well,
we can be optimistic.

939
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:43,324
Here is our champion!

940
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:46,248
You did a good job!

941
01:20:46,272 --> 01:20:47,772
Thank you.

942
01:20:47,796 --> 01:20:51,096
We took points on Hollister
and the "hit" given in court...

943
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:52,920
..it won't hurt.

944
01:20:52,944 --> 01:20:55,844
But he did not commit acts of cruelty.

945
01:20:56,568 --> 01:20:59,668
Then we won't play that card.

946
01:20:59,692 --> 01:21:01,292
Let's wait.

947
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,920
Do you believe that cop?

948
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:06,944
So far she has only shown the kind side of him.

949
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Did you already know him?

950
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,300
Never seen.

951
01:21:12,324 --> 01:21:13,524
(How's it going, Cliff?)

952
01:21:13,548 --> 01:21:14,848
(I'm glad to see you)

953
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,900
(We got it thanks to a friend
of ours who double-crosses.)

954
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,100
(It's the security officer: Trevallian.)

955
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,500
You have to learn to surrender.

956
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,600
Someone could get hurt.

957
01:21:56,624 --> 01:21:57,824
Is he a threat?

958
01:21:57,848 --> 01:21:59,048
No, a promise.

959
01:21:59,072 --> 01:22:00,772
He's been interrogated three times already.

960
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:03,596
You don't recognize true friends.

961
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,940
Nice tattoo!

962
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:07,164
Do you like it?

963
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:10,888
When you grow up, I'll give
you the same one on your ass!

964
01:22:10,912 --> 01:22:12,412
It's a promise?

965
01:22:12,436 --> 01:22:14,136
It's not an oath.

966
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,520
Lee, where were you born?

967
01:22:21,544 --> 01:22:23,244
In Saigon, Vietnam.

968
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,500
How long have you lived in America?

969
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:28,124
I'm 16 years old, I'm an American citizen.

970
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,400
Have you always lived with your father?

971
01:22:30,424 --> 01:22:33,324
Yes my mother died in the war.

972
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,200
What did her father do in Saigon?

973
01:22:36,224 --> 01:22:38,224
He was a major in the army.

974
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,900
Was her father the owner
of the Ancient Dragon Gym?

975
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,620
Yup.

976
01:22:43,644 --> 01:22:45,844
Was she an instructor there?

977
01:22:45,868 --> 01:22:46,968
Yup.

978
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,100
Was her father's gymnasium
also used for other purposes?

979
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,600
Yes sometimes.

980
01:22:55,624 --> 01:22:57,024
What purposes?

981
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,700
My father took men to the gym.

982
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:09,000
I had to entertain them
and they paid for it.

983
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,100
Has he ever tried to refuse?

984
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,100
The first few times yes.

985
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:18,524
How did his father react?

986
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,400
He hit me.

987
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,400
When did it happen?

988
01:23:24,424 --> 01:23:26,024
It all started six years ago.

989
01:23:26,048 --> 01:23:28,248
How old was she?

990
01:23:28,272 --> 01:23:29,872
14.

991
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:37,000
What happened when her
father hit her? Did she react?

992
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:43,200
Never, I was too scared.

993
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,400
Did you kill her father?

994
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,500
I wish I had.

995
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,400
Many times.

996
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,500
No, I didn't kill my father.

997
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,600
Thank you.

998
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
You test it.

999
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,900
Lee, her father was killed
between 11.00 and 12.30.

1000
01:24:25,924 --> 01:24:30,424
Was she also at the
ancient dragon at that hour?

1001
01:24:30,448 --> 01:24:31,748
Yup.

1002
01:24:31,772 --> 01:24:34,572
Her father forced her into prostitution...

1003
01:24:34,596 --> 01:24:37,896
..and he beat her when
she refused to cooperate.

1004
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,800
Did he hit her the
night of the murder too?

1005
01:24:40,824 --> 01:24:42,224
Yup.

1006
01:24:42,248 --> 01:24:46,648
Because she didn't want to bear
the humiliation anymore, did she?

1007
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,900
Yup.

1008
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:54,000
A little while ago you said that
you wished for your father's death.

1009
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,300
It is true that Lieutenant
Trevallian has heard you repeat...

1010
01:24:58,324 --> 01:25:00,524
..that she was to blame
for the death of her father?

1011
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,200
Yup.

1012
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,900
If she didn't kill him,
how is she guilty?

1013
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:18,400
Lee, that man was
selling it to strangers!

1014
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,080
He brutalized her, humiliated her...

1015
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:28,200
Is it true that he could no longer
bear those atrocities that night?

1016
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:35,000
Is it true that after all those
years of violence and abuse...

1017
01:25:35,024 --> 01:25:40,124
..has she finally made that
endless nightmare stop?

1018
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,600
She answers the question.

1019
01:25:43,624 --> 01:25:45,624
There are important news.

1020
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,300
Lee, answer the question.

1021
01:25:50,324 --> 01:25:51,924
May I come closer, Your Honor?

1022
01:25:51,948 --> 01:25:53,348
How dare you?

1023
01:25:53,372 --> 01:25:55,072
I'd like to speak to the judge.

1024
01:25:55,096 --> 01:25:56,896
What does he want to do?

1025
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,820
You interrupted an interrogation!

1026
01:25:59,844 --> 01:26:01,844
Come to my office.

1027
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,500
What happens?

1028
01:26:05,524 --> 01:26:07,524
I have to find a witness.

1029
01:26:07,548 --> 01:26:08,948
Bullshit!

1030
01:26:08,972 --> 01:26:10,972
Fear your client's responses.

1031
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,400
You are an important witness.

1032
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,060
I hope you are right.

1033
01:26:16,084 --> 01:26:17,184
You are incorrect.

1034
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:18,808
Go to lunch.

1035
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:23,700
I went by bus because my sister
when she takes the medicine...

1036
01:26:23,724 --> 01:26:25,724
.. she is unable to drive.

1037
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,700
I went to my mother
who is not very well.

1038
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,600
She is old!
That's why I'm going to find her.

1039
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,000
I boring you?

1040
01:26:38,024 --> 01:26:39,524
No, please!

1041
01:26:39,548 --> 01:26:41,548
She doesn't want to go to a hospice.

1042
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,600
Maybe he'd make friends in there.

1043
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,200
She once dated a sailor,
but then he disappeared.

1044
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,800
-Tom, let me introduce you to two of my friends.
-Hello! How are you?

1045
01:26:53,824 --> 01:26:54,924
Fine you?

1046
01:26:54,948 --> 01:26:59,948
-Good. We have to ask you some
questions, can we go elsewhere?

1047
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,500
Yes, but I don't have much
time, I just went to my mother's.

1048
01:27:04,524 --> 01:27:06,524
I decided to move to California.

1049
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,000
I will find time.

1050
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:11,124
Good.

1051
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,200
It will be fine in California!

1052
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I remind you that
it is still under oath.

1053
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Can I start?

1054
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,800
Proceed.

1055
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:28,624
When she went to the gym…

1056
01:27:28,648 --> 01:27:31,148
.. did you see anyone in the building?

1057
01:27:31,172 --> 01:27:33,172
Mr. Choate.

1058
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,000
Was there anyone with him?

1059
01:27:35,024 --> 01:27:37,824
Yes, he was photographing a brunette woman

1060
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,320
Does he see you in this courtroom?

1061
01:27:41,344 --> 01:27:42,444
Yup.

1062
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,460
Can you indicate it?

1063
01:27:45,484 --> 01:27:47,284
The woman dressed in white.

1064
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,620
Thank you.

1065
01:27:50,644 --> 01:27:52,444
She can sit down.

1066
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:53,568
Thank you.

1067
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,280
The defense calls Mr. Thomas
Plunkett to the stand.

1068
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:11,100
You swear to tell only the truth.

1069
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:12,624
I swear.

1070
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,460
Name and profession?

1071
01:28:20,484 --> 01:28:22,484
Thomas Plunkett, model.

1072
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:27,480
Was he working in Abe Choate's
studio the night Xang was killed?

1073
01:28:27,504 --> 01:28:29,504
Yup.

1074
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,200
Tell us what happened.

1075
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:37,340
While we were working we
heard commotion from upstairs.

1076
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,200
Soon after we see Lee
running down the stairs.

1077
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,600
Abe tells me not to move...

1078
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,200
..while he goes downstairs
to talk to someone.

1079
01:28:51,224 --> 01:28:53,824
Did he see who he was talking to?

1080
01:28:53,948 --> 01:28:55,248
Yup.

1081
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,200
Is he present in this courtroom?

1082
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,600
It's the cop sitting back there.

1083
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,100
Witness ID'd Lieutenant
Michael Trevallian.

1084
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:11,000
Was this before or after
Mr. Choate called the police?

1085
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,300
Before.

1086
01:29:14,324 --> 01:29:18,324
The cop went upstairs
and Abe called the police.

1087
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,800
Then what happened?

1088
01:29:21,824 --> 01:29:25,024
Abe gave me $300 to disappear.

1089
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,400
I took the beaty-case and went.

1090
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,320
Mr. Plunkett, have you
ever seen this knife?

1091
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:39,100
It looks a lot like Abe Choate's.

1092
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,400
Did he see a knife like that
the night of Xang's murder?

1093
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,200
Yup.

1094
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:59,000
I saw Abe give a knife like that
to the policeman going upstairs.

1095
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:04,500
I'll make you pay, damned Homosexual!
I send you to hell.

1096
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,480
Nathan!

1097
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:35,504
Hollister has retired.

1098
01:31:35,528 --> 01:31:38,328
There is no evidence linking
him to what Trevallian did...

1099
01:31:38,352 --> 01:31:42,052
..but, as my grandmother used to say,
"He has a huge cockroach on his plate."

1100
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,200
Damn! Is my wife out there?

1101
01:31:47,224 --> 01:31:48,824
Do you want me to call her?

1102
01:31:48,848 --> 01:31:50,848
Don't disturb her.

1103
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,000
Did Natalie show up?

1104
01:31:54,024 --> 01:31:55,124
No.

1105
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,800
Hollister has not disclosed that tape.

1106
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,320
If it's not in his hand, who has it?

1107
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,200
The fiercest electoral contest
in this state in recent years...

1108
01:32:14,224 --> 01:32:17,224
..has come to an astonishing epilogue.

1109
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:21,000
Our survey of a small sample
of polling stations demonstrates…

1110
01:32:21,024 --> 01:32:25,624
..that candidate Cray Fowler's
victory proves overwhelming.

1111
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,500
It's done!

1112
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,900
He won!

1113
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,900
Let's all go to Washington!

1114
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,200
Are you happy, baby?

1115
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:39,824
Congratulations, Pete,
let's go to HQ, where's Cray?

1116
01:32:39,848 --> 01:32:41,748
-I do not know.
- I'll take the car.

1117
01:32:41,772 --> 01:32:43,772
We are waiting for him outside, come.

1118
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:47,900
Melanie...

1119
01:32:47,924 --> 01:32:49,924
-Let's go to Washington!
-Yup.

1120
01:32:49,948 --> 01:32:51,948
Where's Cray?

1121
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,420
I do not know.

1122
01:32:53,444 --> 01:32:55,044
-Let's sit down.
- I'll take the bag.

1123
01:32:55,068 --> 01:32:57,868
-It does not matter!
- We'll be late.

1124
01:32:57,892 --> 01:32:59,892
You come.

1125
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:12,000
The provisions of the prenuptial
agreement are in effect.

1126
01:33:12,024 --> 01:33:15,724
You will receive monthly
maintenance payments for five years.

1127
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,800
Of course, if he remarries,
he loses all rights.

1128
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,100
What do I have to do?

1129
01:33:33,124 --> 01:33:35,924
Have you seen the pictures?
Sign up now!

1130
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,520
We won?

1131
01:33:40,544 --> 01:33:41,944
Yes, we won

1132
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,200
Rummaging through
dad's papers, I found this.

1133
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,880
What a fight there was!

1134
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:02,360
My father said: "I will
not give you my consent!"

1135
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,800
"We don't mix with Baptists!
And his father's a good-for-nothing!"

1136
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:14,680
I had 12 suitors.
But I didn't choose any of them.

1137
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,520
why did you choose my father?

1138
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:25,800
Clifford was a very classy man!

1139
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I didn't ask you about
Clifford but about Ray!

1140
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:36,100
I went to talk to the Mother
Superior of the Ursulines.

1141
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,100
I had almost decided
to take the vows.

1142
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,400
Were you expecting a baby?

1143
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,520
Clifford!

1144
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:59,000
Meet our hero and
future President!

1145
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,620
What a night!

1146
01:36:02,744 --> 01:36:04,744
What an unforgettable night!

1147
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,840
We are all proud of you, Cray!

1148
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,700
Why are you here alone?

1149
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,760
Are you preparing a speech?

1150
01:36:15,784 --> 01:36:17,784
No, you were right, it's better to improvise.

1151
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:23,260
Come on, have a drink!
You haven't gotten drunk yet!

1152
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,200
Thanks for everything, it can go.

1153
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,320
-I go?
-Thank you.

1154
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,300
We didn't need his help.

1155
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,320
I hope you didn't
promise him too many.

1156
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,900
Once you tried to explain to
me why life is different here.

1157
01:36:53,924 --> 01:36:58,024
You said: "The past
never dies around here."

1158
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,360
"It hasn't even passed!"

1159
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:11,020
For real? Damn!
What powerful words!

1160
01:37:11,044 --> 01:37:13,044
I thought about this sentence for a long time.

1161
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,100
Let's drink on it.

1162
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,300
I want to talk to you openly
and I hope you do the same.

1163
01:37:21,324 --> 01:37:23,924
We always have!

1164
01:37:23,948 --> 01:37:25,448
I want that tape!

1165
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,500
You had that tape made
now you have to give it to me.

1166
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,560
You can not understand.

1167
01:37:44,584 --> 01:37:45,884
Do not joke!

1168
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:51,640
You paid a jackal to blackmail
me with that recording.

1169
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,600
I'm part of the family!

1170
01:37:54,624 --> 01:37:56,624
I didn't want to use it that way.

1171
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,400
Anyway you used it!

1172
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,200
Take it.

1173
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,200
unfortunately things
got out of hand.

1174
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:28,620
That fucking
Vietnamese turned on us.

1175
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,860
It had become dangerous.

1176
01:38:31,884 --> 01:38:33,884
So you had him killed.

1177
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,300
Did you really have
to be a paladin?

1178
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,360
How could I imagine it?

1179
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,300
A man had been killed!

1180
01:38:44,324 --> 01:38:47,724
I had to watch while
that human waste...

1181
01:38:47,748 --> 01:38:51,648
..trying to ruin your life?
I tried to protect you!

1182
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,000
Trevallian was supposed
to take you out that evening.

1183
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
No one would know about it and
you would have come out clean.

1184
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,700
Cray...
I know it sounds crazy...

1185
01:39:17,724 --> 01:39:21,724
..but the death of that
Vietnamese, this whole thing...

1186
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,420
..it was the best thing that
could have happened to you.

1187
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,800
I swear I'd give my life...

1188
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,200
..because you...

1189
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Well... destroy it...
Now it's really over.

1190
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,700
Now we have to
forget all this history.

1191
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,400
I have an appointment with
the district attorney tomorrow.

1192
01:40:38,424 --> 01:40:42,024
He'll reopen the investigation into
the St. Albans mining concessions.

1193
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,500
Investigations my father
was collaborating on.

1194
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:52,460
When they come to the
conclusion that it was…

1195
01:40:52,484 --> 01:40:57,084
..of a scandalous speculation
that defrauded those poor people...

1196
01:40:57,108 --> 01:40:59,908
..our family will
reimburse all damages.

1197
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,700
The investigation will proceed
with the full cooperation...

1198
01:41:04,724 --> 01:41:07,624
..of every member of this family.

1199
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,900
cray...

1200
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,000
..I'm your father.

1201
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,360
You are my father's killer!

1202
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,800
You took him to the
swamp and slaughtered him!

1203
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
The past never dies
