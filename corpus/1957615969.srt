1
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:14,751
(eerie ominous music)

2
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:22,375
- You're the man of the
family now Jeremiah.

3
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,590
(birds chirping)
You must keep the ways

4
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,423
of your father.

5
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,480
We are not to mix with the outside world.

6
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,883
We are to wait, for the
second coming of our Lord.

7
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,650
Do you understand?

8
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:38,569
(shovel clanking)

9
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,700
(tender music)
The world is an evil place

10
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,040
son, nobody knows about us out here,

11
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,890
nobody ever will.

12
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,963
Ours'll be a hard life but,
but it's so very worth it.

13
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,570
'Cause the end of the
journey is what we seek.

14
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,055
(dreamy music)

15
00:01:58,055 --> 00:02:01,142
Your father made this for you.

16
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:03,273
He meant to give it to
you on your birthday.

17
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,920
He never got a chance
to tell you either but,

18
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:13,233
your father loved you very much Jeremiah.

19
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,816
(somber music)

20
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,979
(woman sobbing)

21
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:35,183
(eerie ominous music)

22
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:56,921
(birds chirping)

23
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:18,145
- Vroom!

24
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:22,723
(grunts), vroom!

25
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,320
(suspenseful music)

26
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:38,634
- Jeremiah, Jeremiah, go inside.

27
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:48,811
(ominous music)
Jeremiah.

28
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,026
Jeremiah get inside.

29
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:53,776
(birds chirping)

30
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,470
(crow cawing)

31
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,370
- Why hello ma'am.

32
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:10,720
- [Man] Ma'am.

33
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,770
- You gentlemen lost?

34
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,933
- (chuckles) Did you hear that Turner?

35
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,963
- Yeah, I heard.

36
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,000
(man laughing)

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,410
- Now ma'am, if you kindly oblige,

38
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,393
we uh, are a might hungry and
our throats are a bit parched.

39
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,430
If you could see fit to go and--

40
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,260
- Well I'm sorry but uh, as you can see,

41
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,130
I'm in the midst of doing my washing.

42
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,180
And my husband's due back in just a bit,

43
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,800
so, uh, I'm afraid that--

44
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,746
- Well, I think you oughta be.

45
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:43,530
(chuckling)

46
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,683
- Now don't pay no
nevermind to old turner.

47
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,623
Turner, go scaring this fine lady.

48
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,635
- I do not walk with the spirit of fear.

49
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:59,280
(sighing)

50
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,760
I think it's best if just move on.

51
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,560
- Turner, I think we heard the lady.

52
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,353
- Good day.

53
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:09,713
(ominous music)

54
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:15,177
- Oh, I think it's gonna
be better than good,

55
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:16,910
it's gonna be gooder!
- (grunts) Get off!

56
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,526
- Good, huh?

57
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,800
- Mama.
(screaming)

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,012
(dramatic music)
- Now, let's see what you got

59
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:22,699
hiding under there, huh?
(grunting)

60
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,631
(mumbling)
- Oh no!

61
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:27,960
- Go (mumbles)!
- No (sobs)!

62
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,947
(screaming)
Here!

63
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,747
Come over!
(sobbing)

64
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,428
- [Woman] No!

65
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:35,111
(grunting)
(whimpering)

66
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:36,921
- Oh my, oh my!

67
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:37,929
- Jeremiah!
- Momma...

68
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:39,848
(mumbling)
(grunting)

69
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:41,406
- Jeremiah!
- What?

70
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:45,259
(mumbles) somebody's
name, it better be mine!

71
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,217
(screaming)
(grunting)

72
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:48,950
(bottle breaking)
- No, no!

73
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,853
- Don't do that!
- Shut up!

74
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:54,104
- Don't do that!
- No, (screaming)!

75
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,771
Jeremiah, look away!

76
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:03,260
- No!
(squishing)

77
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,177
(glass clattering)

78
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:10,831
(forlorn music)

79
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:13,998
(footsteps crunching)

80
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:18,690
- [Man] Why you're just
as pretty as your momma!

81
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:22,397
(clattering)

82
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:25,117
- No!
(thudding)

83
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:30,117
(somber music)
(wooden creaking)

84
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:39,528
- [Man] You ain't pretty no more.

85
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:53,817
(birds chirping)
(woman squealing)

86
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:58,317
(laughing)
(mumbling)

87
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,298
- Put me down!
(chuckling)

88
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:03,110
(thudding)
Oh (giggles)...

89
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,479
- Look baby!

90
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,793
A paradise!

91
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:06,973
Come on let's check it out!
- Oh my god!

92
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,187
- Come on!

93
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:09,529
Come on!
- Uh I don't think so!

94
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,400
(chuckling)
- Why (laughs) it's beautiful,

95
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,040
come on, it's a little fixer-upper!

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,173
- Brad, come on!

97
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:15,744
- Come on baby!

98
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:17,530
(door clattering)

99
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,150
Wow,

100
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,289
this is awesome!
(ominous music)

101
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:23,539
- That's not a good idea.

102
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,030
- Come on baby, the place is ours.

103
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,787
(sighing)
(ominous music)

104
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,732
- Okay.
- (sighs) Come here!

105
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:35,964
(woman giggling)

106
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:38,631
(lips smacking)

107
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:45,046
Hmm...
(chuckling)

108
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:47,912
- Mmm...
(lips smacking)

109
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:52,579
(clattering)
(giggling)

110
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,642
Mmm...
(lips smacking)

111
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:00,112
(mumbling)

112
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,445
(chuckling)

113
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:05,364
- Yeah...
(clothes rustling)

114
00:08:05,364 --> 00:08:06,197
Ah...

115
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,333
Uh-hmm...

116
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,022
(suspenseful music)
(sighing)

117
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:16,105
- [Woman] (mumbles) something...

118
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:25,366
(sighing)
(heavy breathing)

119
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:28,392
(giggling)
(lips smacking)

120
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:30,937
(sighing)

121
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:32,350
(lips smacking)

122
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,630
(giggling)

123
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,166
(chuckling)

124
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,833
- [Brad] Mmm, mmm...

125
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,822
(sighing)
(chuckling)

126
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,546
Mmm...
(lips smacking)

127
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:45,434
(mumbling)

128
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:48,171
(giggling)

129
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:50,511
(chuckling)

130
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:55,511
- Oh yeah!
(lips smacking)

131
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,501
(wooden creaking)

132
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:01,653
- Oh my god!
(screaming)

133
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:03,422
(scuffling)

134
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:08,352
(clattering)
(screaming)

135
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,935
(wet thudding)

136
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:18,527
(energetic rock music)

137
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:34,691
- Frank's gonna hook us
up with a sweat deal!

138
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:37,072
For our Amsterdam flight!

139
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:37,989
Groovy huh?

140
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:41,956
(feedback humming)

141
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,123
(sighing)

142
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:46,720
Well?

143
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,060
- Here baby.
- Oh!

144
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,676
Thank you.

145
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:53,593
(inhaling sharply)

146
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,480
You're doing research for what?

147
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,170
- I'm writing an article
on why getting stoned,

148
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,060
will finally enable us, as a society,

149
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,090
to break through the
paralysis we experience

150
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,680
when we view visual violence.

151
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,020
- This is sick.

152
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,520
That somebody out there,

153
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,310
can just pull up a picture like that!

154
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,880
- Most people'll look at this,

155
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,050
and get on with their day,

156
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,970
but if we're stoned we'd
stop, look, and think.

157
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,324
Billy, pot's the answer!

158
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:24,290
(telephone ringing)
- No, no,

159
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,530
you know what the answer is?

160
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,580
Getting an answering
machine, that is the answer!

161
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,730
- I resent that.

162
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,660
I gave you another
cordless for your birthday,

163
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,350
what more could you possibly want?

164
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,373
- Sunny the phone.

165
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,720
- And stick that tongue back in or I'm

166
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,373
gonna use it for a good use!

167
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,150
- You didn't just say that.

168
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,823
- Sunny, the phone.

169
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,275
(bubbling)

170
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:50,270
(telephone beeping)

171
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,220
- Hello?

172
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,980
Hey, Lehman!

173
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,150
It's your fellow caveman.

174
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,350
You want to grunt hello?

175
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,640
What's up Lehman?

176
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,190
Yeah of course we're packed.

177
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,283
So check it out, does
your girlfriend smoke?

178
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,223
You are so gross.

179
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,660
Okay we'll meet you out front.

180
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,500
All right.

181
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,803
Later.
(beeping)

182
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,873
- So uh, what did he say
does his girlfriend smoke?

183
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,633
- He said, she smokes his beef joint.

184
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,600
- Oh.

185
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,320
So she smokes.

186
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,153
- Yeah.

187
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,727
I can't wait to

188
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,300
(guitar strumming)
get out of here baby.

189
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,713
Breath some fresh air, be one with nature.

190
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,090
- That's why I dig you.

191
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,974
You are such the tree hugger.

192
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:46,800
(chuckling)

193
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,157
(lips smacking)

194
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:50,140
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

195
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,807
(ominous music)

196
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,150
(beeping)
- Hello Kate,

197
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,213
this is Rachel from
Dr. Binderman's office.

198
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,550
(water splashing)
We have your test results,

199
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,910

call us as soon as you get back

200
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,703
to schedule another
appointment, thank you!

201
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:10,703
(clunking)
(dial tone buzzing)

202
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,527
(clattering)

203
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:28,548
(water splashing)

204
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:37,240
(suspenseful music)

205
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,073
(curtain thudding)

206
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:39,590
- Yeeha!
(screaming)

207
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,034
(dramatic music)
(gibbering)

208
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:44,077
- You jerk, the shower's off limits!

209
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:46,110
I thought you were out.

210
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,943
- Back scrub?

211
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,213
Just getting you back for last week.

212
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:53,080
- That's different, I'm
naked and vulnerable in here.

213
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,130
- Yes you are.

214
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,175
- Hmm.

215
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,580
You scared me so bad, you big meanie!

216
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,747
- Oh I'm sorry.

217
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,545
- You're getting all wet.

218
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:03,705
- I don't care.

219
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:06,905
(telephone ringing)
(chuckling)

220
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:08,822
Mmm, I love your hands.

221
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:11,874
(lips smacking)

222
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,974
- We're gonna be late.

223
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,730
- Yep.
(chuckling)

224
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,800
Hi, you've reached Kate and Johnny,

225
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,780
we'd love to take your cow,

226
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,630
but we're out milking a call, moo!

227
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,570
(beeping)
- Hey what's up

228
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,380
you guys it's me, where are you?

229
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,160
Anyway, sorry we're late
but we had to go back

230
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,450
to Lehman's new flavor of the
week's house, she forgot her

231
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,750
Spice Girl's CD you guys,
(groaning)

232
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,410
and uh yeah she's coming with us!

233
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,890
Anyway her name is Heidi Triggers,

234
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,821
she looks like a porn (mumbles).

235
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,654
Anyway I'm going off.
- We should get that.

236
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,300
- We're getting gas right
now we'll see you soon,

237
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,447
be ready, bye.

238
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,255
(clattering)
- Uh, Sunny, hey!

239
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:51,206
Yeah, yeah we're set to go, yeah.

00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,350
Well uh, we'll be out front, okay?

241
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,623
We'll see you in a few?

242
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,953
Okay.
(plastic clattering)

243
00:13:57,953 --> 00:13:59,340
All right bye.
(telephone clattering)

244
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,150
Baby they're gonna be here in 10 minutes,

245
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,183
we gotta get going!

246
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:05,600
(cheerful country music)

247
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:15,624
(door clicking)

248
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:17,361
(static hissing)
- Sheriff this is Maggie,

249
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:19,193
are you there Sheriff?

250
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,582
- Oh...
- Hello?

251
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:22,132
(static hissing)
- Yeah Maggie.

252
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:24,730
(static hissing)
- Sheriff, uh we had a call

253
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,810
come in from a small aircraft,

254
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,430
he sees what seems to be, a-a vehicle,

255
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,426
underwater in the reservoir.

256
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:35,140
(static hissing)
- Uh, copy that Maggie.

257
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,230
Send Russle out there with his boat,

258
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,994
and I'll also send a tow truck out.

259
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:41,064
(static hissing)
Uh, uh, where's Kevin?

260
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:42,710
(static hissing)
- Oh he's tending

261
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,517
to the toilet Sheriff, oh
it's all clogged up again.

262
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,033
(static hissing)
Do you want to speak to him?

263
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:47,866
(static hissing)
- Uh no no,

264
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:49,690
that that, that that's okay.

265
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,770
- You trying to tell me I
aint strong enough to plunge?

266
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,940
Why when I was your age I could take on

267
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,320
three of your size all at the same time!

268
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,373
I was strong as a bear!

269
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,150
- Well you sure crap like one.

270
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,190
- I heard that!

271
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,023
Well you come back here!

272
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:08,630
- You know it's all those
damn hot dogs you eat Harold!

273
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,440
- Oh hold on Sheriff he's right here!

274
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,253
Kevin, Sheriff wants to talk to you.

275
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,800
- Yeah Sheriff this is Kevin uh,

276
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,520
I got that toilet fixed,
you know like you wanted,

277
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,402
it seems Harold was the culprit.

278
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:20,550
(static hissing)
- Well listen that,

279
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,010
that's fine Kevin, I'm just gonna need you

280
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,690
to go on out to the reservoir and,

281
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,870
and uh check that call for me.

282
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,430
Also I want, I want you
to run a plate check

283
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,460
on the uh license, and
I'm uh, I'm gonna be at

284
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,440
Grants for a bit, and then I'll meet up

285
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
with you at the reservoir, all right?

286
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,790
- Copy that and uh,

287
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,890
Sheriff I seem to have another
missing persons report,

288
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,980
it's a Brad Mitchell, and a Jessie Scott.

289
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,974
Uh, they're hikers.

290
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,710
(static hissing)

291
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,259
- All right I've got it, I'll
see you at the reservoir.

292
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,440
(static hissing)

293
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,931
- Over.
(static hissing)

294
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:52,681
(vigorous music)

295
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:02,030
- (laughs) Come on, so you're saying

296
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,130
you wouldn't do it for a
shit load of cash, Billy?

297
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:04,963
- No.

298
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,120
I mean the only high that I need comes

299
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,191
in a plastic baggie.
(laughing)

300
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:13,010
(mumbles), I really think
it's self worship, man.

301
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,090
Climbing a mountain, please.

302
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,000
- Yeah I'm with him, I
wouldn't do it either.

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,110
I mean, people must be bored.

304
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,920
Mount Everest, why?

305
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,320
- Guys, it's a spiritual quest.

306
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,023
(scoffing)
- Spiritual?

307
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,270
Frostbite's a bitch man, I mean,

308
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,830
the guy was a top surgeon
and he loses his fingers?

309
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,360
There is nothing spiritual about that.

310
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,060
- There I rest my case.

311
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,370
The guy, risks his life, he
loses all of his body parts,

312
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,690
for something that's already been done!

313
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,240
- Johnny, tell him the deal with his nose.

314
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,040
- Oh oh, the nose, no,
Lehman, not the nose.

315
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,860
- Come on the nose, Johnny!

316
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,120
- What about the nose (sighs)?

317
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,423
- All right, the nose,

318
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,320
got taken off, frostbite.

319
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,520
Now he's kinda got that,

320
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:04,330
that Phantom of the Opera
thing going, you know.

321
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,940
- Well, at least when he's 69-ing a chick

322
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,779
his nose won't get stuck in her pooper.

323
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,310
(laughing)

324
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,150
- You're such a wag, man!

325
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,613
Car box, boxing, man, you're
on a roll today Lehman.

326
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,733
(birds chirping)

327
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,709
(key clicking)
(police radio chattering)

328
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,542
- Oh...

329
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:25,881
Phew...

330
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:28,548
(door thudding)

331
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:36,711
(clattering)
(foreboding music)

332
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,909
(cable squeaking)

333
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,680
(water splashing)

334
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,513
(grunting)
- You're not gonna believe

335
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:43,140
what's down here!

336
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,370
Sheriff, this is crazy!

337
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,321
Sheriff, this is, this is crazy!

338
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:48,260
(panting)
- Well what?

339
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,623
- I count, I counted 22
cars down there so far!

340
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:53,951
- What?

341
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:56,200
Did you see any bodies?

342
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,813
- Uh no, n-no bodies, sir.

343
00:17:57,813 --> 00:17:59,010
(spitting)

344
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,960
- 22 cars down there, well you know Russle

345
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,570
it can only be one thing, it has to be,

346
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,300
insurance scam, something like that.

347
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,763
'Cause this is the perfect
place to hide vehicles.

348
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:11,066
(sighing)
(mumbling)

349
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:14,030
(police radio chattering)

350
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,830
All right Russle here's what we do.

351
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,550
I want to set up a temporary,
uh vehicle compound here.

352
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:23,750
I want to set up a perimeter,
all around this area, okay?

353
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,700
We got to do this quick, before,

354
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,490
the townsfolk get ahold
of this 'cause as soon

355
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,610
as they hear this they're gonna be

356
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,890
out here like shit through a
goose, looking at all this.

357
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,931
- Oh, with all due
respect Sheriff I mean uh,

358
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:37,770
uh, uh, I'm not, I'm
not too sure about this,

359
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,740
I-I-I don't know what
to do, I, I sell boats,

360
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,203
I'm not in law enforcement.

361
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,042
(patting)
- You want to help me

362
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,270
don't you?
- Oh, yes sir.

363
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,570
- Have you ever robbed a bank,

364
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,805
have you ever murdered anybody,

365
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,980
have you ever used
heroin, marijuana, sheep?

366
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,637
- N-N-No sir.
- Okay then you're deputized.

367
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:55,630
(patting)
Think you can handle it?

368
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,140
- Oh, oh yeah, y-yes sir, yes, yes I can.

369
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,640
- Well by god I appreciate it.

370
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,938
(mumbling)
(police radio chattering)

371
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:05,717
(door clattering)

372
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:09,100
- All right, uh, I'm in charge
now so let's get a move on!

373
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,090
And-and-and be careful, 'cause, 'cause we

374
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,990
don't want to circumcise the evidence!

375
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:20,195
- Russle, uh, (sighs), it's compromise.

376
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:21,722
Compromise, hmm?

377
00:19:25,846 --> 00:19:27,320
- Oh...

378
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,950
Oh, uh all right, you f, you fine,

379
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,530
you fine gentlemen, let's,

380
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,420
let's pull us up some vehicles and,

381
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,910
and, and and place 'em
right, right over here.

382
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,743
(static hissing)
- Sheriff?

383
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:38,516
- Yeah Maggie uh, where the hell is Kevin?

384
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:40,070
(static hissing)
- Kevin's gone over

385
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,640
to Mrs. Parson's house, she fell down

386
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,300
the stairs of her basement.

387
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,320
He just called in from
her phone to tell me.

388
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,583
His radio's still not working properly.

389
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,483
- I want his radio fixed today.

390
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,800
I mean th-this is a damn joke!

391
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,900
Christ almighty, (mumbles), look,

392
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm sorry Maggie, run
this plate for me, okay?

393
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:07,571
(relaxing country music)

394
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:13,638
- Harold!
(snapping)

395
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:15,710
Uh, will you please take these boxes and

396
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,660
throw them in the trash,
they have been sitting here

397
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,000
for over a week now.
- You wish!

398
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,290
That's all just from today.

399
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,730
And besides, what does
the shade of my skin

400
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,880
look like to you, uh,
now what do I look like?

401
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,240
- Like a racist janitor.

402
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,782
- What if I raced my
hand up to your behind?

403
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:36,620
(chuckles) Bet that'll set
off your fireworks, huh?

404
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,530
- Perv.
- What if I perved,

405
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,079
your curve?

406
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,550
Oh, I get it, better to speak to

407
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,367
the hand and not the face (laughs)!

408
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:51,089
(birds chirping)
(foreboding music)

409
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:57,033
(eerily pensive music)

410
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:07,882
(mysterious music)

411
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:27,615
(relaxing music)

412
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,500
- I'm hungry.

413
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,120
- Okay sweetie.

414
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,180
Hey you guys, how 'bout we stop for

415
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,610
a nice, fat, booger with cheese?

416
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,370
- Lehman we just ate, I mean,

417
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,410
I'm okay with stopping
again, don't get me wrong,

418
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,030
no offense, Heidi, but why don't we get

419
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,390
something to eat when we stop for gas

420
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,130
and we can kill two birds with one stone?

421
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,383
- Heidi, you seem to
have a healthy appetite.

422
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,603
- Hey, maybe she's pregnant, poppa, huh?

423
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:07,463
- Kate's right Lehman,
I'm fine I can wait.

424
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,810
- So Heidi, what do you like to smoke?

425
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,390
Cigarettes, pot, or...

426
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,223
Beef...

427
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,210
- I'm sorry, what was the question?

428
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,690
- Do you like to smoke cigarettes,
pot, or, well that's it.

429
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,773
Cigarettes or pot.

430
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,107
- I smoke a little Mary Jane on occasion.

431
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:33,421
(lips smacking)
- Ooh, Mary Jane!

432
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:35,437
- [Johnny] Uh-hmmm...

433
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,840
- Uh speaking of which, how's about

434
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,210
a little Mary Jane for the driver?

435
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,840
- Yeah, pass the Mary Jane!

436
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,593
- Mary Jane coming right up!

437
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:45,893
- Don't let it bother you!

438
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,610
- Hey baby we're just playing.

439
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,390
- What's up with the rain,
anyone check the weather?

440
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,450
- [Kate] It's supposed to clear up later.

441
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,550
- Well I hope it does.

442
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,173
Hiking in the rain sucks.

443
00:22:58,173 --> 00:22:59,964
(chuckling)

444
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:03,042
(gravel crunching)

445
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:05,721
(water splashing)

446
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:08,471
(engine revving)

447
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,890
- [Kevin] Sheriff this is Kevin, over.

448
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:14,883
Uh sir, do you copy?

449
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,601
Sheriff this is Kevin.

450
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:18,630
(static hissing)

451
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,810
- Right uh, uh, I copy
Kevin y-you have to give

452
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,840
me a second to get to the,
to the hand set, okay?

453
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,230
- Yeah I was just checking in sir,

454
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,410
I-I'm back at the station,

455
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,490
I was wondering if I should
go to the reservoir now?

456
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,341
- I think that'd be a good idea.

457
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:34,206
(static hissing)
How's Mrs. Parsons?

458
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,220
(static hissing)
- Oh uh she's just

459
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,490
banged up real bad, and
the doc's taking X-Rays,

460
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,444
she might'a hurt her hip.

461
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:40,200
(static hissing)
- Shit that's too bad.

462
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,480
Look I'll try to get over there

463
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,259
and see her when I got time.

464
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,590
(static hissing)
Listen any word on that uh,

465
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,380
plate that I wanted run?

466
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,333
- Uh no sir the wires seem
to be all tied up right now.

467
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,924
Uh, what's your 20?

468
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:52,350
(static hissing)
- Well, I'm about

469
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,976
30 miles from Fallbrook,

470
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:56,657
(static hissing)
heading up on the east ridge.

471
00:23:56,657 --> 00:24:00,130
(static hissing)

472
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,399
(tense music)

473
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,066
Oh, well now, what have we here?

474
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:13,889
What have we...

475
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:18,900
(static hissing)
Kevin!

476
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,360
Um, I'm gonna make a stop, you
head on out to the reservoir,

477
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,955
and uh, I'll meet you there.

478
00:24:25,955 --> 00:24:27,655
(static hissing)
- Copy that sir.

479
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,370
One more thing I'm having Curtis install

480
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,303
a new radio in my car so,
I'll be mobile soon sir.

481
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:35,643
(static hissing)
- Well that's good Kevin.

482
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:38,607
That's the best news I heard all day.

483
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,657
Out.
(static hissing)

484
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:43,824
(perky country music)

485
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:50,334
(engine revving)

486
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:10,059
(birds chirping)

487
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:13,648
(sighing)

488
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:22,908
(limbs cracking)

489
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:25,575
(ominous music)

490
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,669
(mumbling)

491
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:37,348
Hello?

492
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:41,710
(wooden thumping)

493
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,793
Anybody home?

494
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:47,488
Hello?

495
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:13,328
Hello?

496
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:17,649
(hinges creaking)

497
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:24,608
Hello!

498
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,443
Hello!

499
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:43,371
Hmm...

500
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,857
(suspenseful music)
(grunting)

501
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:53,914
See what this is, here...

502
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:56,164
(thumping)

503
00:26:59,053 --> 00:26:59,886
Uh-hmm.

504
00:27:03,795 --> 00:27:06,045
(mumbling)

505
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:09,179
Well, apparently nobody...

506
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,305
(grunting)
(thumping)

507
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:15,305
else around.

508
00:27:16,622 --> 00:27:21,539
(ominous music)
(mumbling)

509
00:27:36,986 --> 00:27:39,974
(paper rustling)

510
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:40,891
All righty.

511
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:45,388
(mumbling)

512
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,836
And I am, out of here.

513
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,320
(relaxing music)

514
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,420
- Lehman baby are you sure
about taking the back roads?

515
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,990
- Heidi don't worry about it, I mean,

516
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,310
we probably will get lost but,

517
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,980
that has always been Lehman's contribution

518
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,700
to our adventures.
- It's cool poppy.

519
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,900
I always know what I'm doing even when

520
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,437
I don't know what I'm doing.

521
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:20,887
- Well you know getting
lost is part of the trip.

522
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,150
- So, you guys do this every year?

523
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,950
When did you all start?

524
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,950
- Back in high school, junior year.

525
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,180
Lehman was only one with a car back then.

526
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,280
Our first trip was to
woo-hoo, Lake Havasu!

527
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,934
- Whoo-hoo, insane!

528
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,512
- Insane
- It was insane.

529
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:40,760
(laughing)
- Ever since then we,

530
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,520
made a pact to take
these adventures together

531
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,630
until we're old and gray or, we die,

532
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,853
whichever comes first.

533
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,980
- And every year one of us gets to pick

534
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,270
a destination, no matter
how outrageous it is

535
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,940
we all have to commit to it.

536
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,430
This year I picked.

537
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,600
Great hiking, cool places to
explore, horseback riding.

538
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,710
- Ooh, sounds rages, don't it?

539
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,483
- Stop, it's gonna be fun!

540
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,666
- This year we almost didn't make it,

541
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,420
because of what happened last year.

542
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,485
- Why, what happened?

543
00:29:10,485 --> 00:29:12,050
(foreboding music)
- Billy.

544
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,633
- Well, we all went cave diving.

545
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,690
Down in the Bahamas, and
uh, Lehman got us lost.

546
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:25,860
And uh, he was seeing this girl uh, Janet.

547
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,817
Anyway, uh, when we were down there, uh,

548
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,487
Janet got separated from us and uh,

549
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,390
well she never showed up at the surface.

550
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,710
Her uh, body was never uh, recovered.

551
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,670
- Billy you're an asshole.

552
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,440
- Are you serious?

553
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,273
- Oh yeah.

554
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,320
Oh yeah, hey it messed him up.

555
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,213
Messed us all up.

556
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,860
I'm surprised he didn't tell you, Heidi.

557
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,213
- You guys, come on!

558
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,650
Stop the car!

559
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,115
Stop the car!

560
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:04,387
(sighing)

561
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,260
I said stop the car!

562
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,370
- It's official, we're lost.

563
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,939
- Again.
- Yeah, ooh!

564
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:12,362
Lehman!
(cheering)

565
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:13,407
(clapping)
Whoo-hoo!

566
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:14,557
- I'm sorry sweetheart.

567
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,880
- That was twisted, you had me there!

568
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,550
You're all joking, right?

569
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,350
- Yeah you're a good sport,
just part of the initiation.

570
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,910
- That was good, Billy.

571
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,550
- Just wait, it gets better.

572
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,040
People are strange,
when you're a stranger,

573
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,410
you know the song.

574
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,913
Well it's true.
(lazy country music)

575
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:51,047
- Hey check out the primo sign!

576
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:59,340
Free fried chicken meat
with every fill up!

577
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,797
Whoa, hope their cooking's
better than their spelling.

578
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,803
- Johnny we're gonna go blaze up man.

579
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:13,630
(clapping)
All right.

580
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,543
- Howdy ladies.

581
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:17,823
- Oh, excuse me.

582
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,000
Could you tell me where
your bathroom is please?

583
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,190
- Oh yes ma'am uh, right down
through there, in the back.

584
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,190
- Thanks.

585
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,021
You wanna come?
- Sure.

586
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:27,854
- Hey Kate!

587
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,340
You okay?

588
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,343
- Yeah, why?

589
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:35,947
- Ah it's nothing, it's nothing.

590
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:40,947
(chuckling)
(lips smacking)

591
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,070
- Howdy.

592
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,903
I'm Fryed.

593
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,843
Floyd Fryed.

594
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:51,320
What's you all folks lookin' to get?

595
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,730
- Uh, how 'bout you fill
her up please, Floyd.

596
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,943
- Hmm yes sir.

597
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,096
(door clattering)
(doorbell ringing)

598
00:32:00,096 --> 00:32:00,960
(metallic thudding)

599
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,660
Oh and hey, how 'bout some of that

600
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,100
free fried chicken meat, is it fresh?

601
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,220
- Fresh as you're gonna
find in these here parts.

602
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,170
And seein's you got so many of 'ya,

603
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,540
I'm gonna give 'ya a whole bucket full!

604
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,423
- Ooh oh that's mighty fine of 'ya!

605
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:16,280
Probably fried in motor oil.
(tittering)

606
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,113
- What's that?

607
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,490
- Uh, he said while you're at it

608
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,468
you should probably check the motor oil!

609
00:32:21,468 --> 00:32:23,480
(thumping)
- Oh, (chuckles).

610
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,030
No hurt no harm.

611
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,590
There for just the teeniest
twitch of a frog's ass

612
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,930
I thought you was being a cocksucker.

613
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,930
- Oh, no (chuckles).

614
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,770
- Listen I'm gonna, git
your chicken first off,

615
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,650
don't want to get my hand

616
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,423
all dirty and then touch your food.

617
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,100
We uh, pride ourselves
in serving our travelers

618
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,450
with the very best they is.

619
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:50,526
(gravel crunching)
(birds chirping)

620
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,280
- What the hell was that?

621
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,850
- That, was a loose
piece of work, (sighs).

622
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,600
- Why don't you go give
him a hand (chuckles)!

623
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,990
- Sh, shit (chuckles)!

624
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,620
Come on man, let's go,
let's throw some rock.

625
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,760
- No wait wait wait wait wait!

626
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,770
This morning, I overheard this message,

627
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,990
on my machine, doctor
was leaving a message

628
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,580
about some test results of Kate and all

629
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,350
this kind of stuff, she hasn't
mentioned anything about it!

630
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,873
Am I bugging?

631
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:16,590
- (sighing) Yeah, it sounds bad.

632
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,980
- What should I do?
- No (laughs),

633
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,717
I'm just kidding, listen
it's, it's uh, no big deal,

634
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:22,340
if it was serious then,
I'm sure she'd tell you.

635
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,440
- Yeah?
- Yeah, chill out.

636
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,273
Come on go long!

637
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,813
Go uh, go John Holmes on me!
(chuckling)

638
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:32,125
(thumping)
- Ooh!

639
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,790
- So when he came up and offered
to pay for half my drink,

640
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,060
I didn't know what to say,

641
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,550
I just stood there thinking,

642
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,350
this guy is either really cheap,

643
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,410
or, could be different.

644
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,880
- Yeah he's definitely different.

645
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,730
Oh that place was so disgusting!

646
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,350
- I know, it was creepy.

647
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,817
I didn't let the toilet seat
touch my legs (chuckles).

648
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,090
I'm hiding it from Lehman,
he doesn't know I smoke.

649
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,981
New relationship stuff, you know.

650
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:01,231
(mumbling)

651
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,253
- So what do you do?

652
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,820
- I just got out of school.

653
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,850
- Oh yeah?

654
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,570
What were you majoring in?

655
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,390
- Special education.

656
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,400
I work with autistic
children during the day.

657
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,670
- [Sunny] Really?

658
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,823
- You sound surprised.

659
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,160
- I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean
for it to sound like that.

660
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,690
- That's okay, I get that all the time.

661
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,793
I'm also a dancer.

662
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,210
School loans, you know (chuckles).

663
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,956
Just for the record I dance in a bikini.

664
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:31,310
(chuckling)

665
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,300
So what do you do?

666
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,653
- I am working on my
Master's in Psychology.

667
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,590
- Damn (mumbles).

668
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,393
So, are you sizing me up?

669
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,506
- (chuckles) No.

670
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:46,440
- Fried by Fryed!

671
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,560
- Oh, wow,

672
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,830
thanks!
- Uh, uh...

673
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,420
- Hey, food's up!

674
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,253
Pay the man.
- Oh that is

675
00:34:53,253 --> 00:34:54,850
kickin' chicken Floyd.

676
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,360
- Mm, yeah, thanks.

677
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
- 18 on the pump.
- Hmm, appreciate it!

678
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,210
- So, remember this aborigine I was

679
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,660
telling you about from Hawaii,

680
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,400
and he's got this house
made out of solid weed?

681
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,233
Well in order to get into the house

682
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,380
you got to have a password,

683
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,940
to get inside the house,
and the password is

684
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,142
- [Both] Kobuki sulfer mon!

685
00:35:18,142 --> 00:35:19,337
(screaming)
(ominous music)

686
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:20,670
- Oh my god, oh!

687
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:24,649
- This is wrong.

688
00:35:24,649 --> 00:35:27,043
This is very wrong.

689
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,761
(suspenseful music)

690
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,011
(mumbling)

691
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,663
- Hey!

692
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:36,620
(screaming)

693
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,563
Good afternoon.

694
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,010
I'm Mr. Tyler Trout at your service.

695
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:43,813
Uh you're lookin' at the chickens.

696
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,550
Well that mangy old maggot-eaten stray dog

697
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,300
of mine had his way with the chickens

698
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,460
and I had to get rid of a lot of 'em.

699
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:53,562
It's a shame.

700
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,290
Would you like to snap one of 'em's neck?

701
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,723
I got a lot out in the back.

702
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,370
And the minute they die, you can smell the

703
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,693
rabies leave their body, it's spectacular.

704
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,730
Come on!

705
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,980
(retching)

706
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,328
Your girlfriend's not feeling good.

707
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:17,682
(gagging)

708
00:36:17,682 --> 00:36:19,532
I want you to take this chicken wing.

709
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,890
Give me your hand here.

710
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,810
It's not hard, take the
chicken wing, it's soft.

711
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,510
And use it as a suppository.

712
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,900
Leave it in for ten minutes,

713
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,600
it'll take you out of your misery.

714
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,340
Go behind that truck, you'll be hidden.

715
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,600
Go ahead.
(whimpering)

716
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,550
Now tell her to go.

717
00:36:42,443 --> 00:36:45,080
You know what's good
about that suppository?

718
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,050
When she farts, it's gonna smell like

719
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,353
Southern Fried chicken.

720
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:51,624
You hold that in your heart.

721
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:54,322
(thumping)

722
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:56,989
(frantic music)

723
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,101
- [Sunny] Get the hell out of here now!

724
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,262
- [Lehman] Whoa, what
the hell's the matter

725
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:08,466
with you stone monkeys?

726
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:10,731
- Would you look?
- What's that about?

727
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:11,564
- I'll tell you in a minute,

728
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:13,313
just step on the fucking gas!

729
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,350
- Oh, whatever you say Mr. Leary.

730
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,038
(engine revving)
- Go man go!

731
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:20,705
(frantic music)

732
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:27,300
- Did you give 'em some chicken?

733
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,830
- A whole bucket full.

734
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,605
You done good, I'm proud of 'ya.

735
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:31,605
- Thank 'ya.

736
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,260
You know those city folk,
they just don't know how.

737
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,700
- How to what?

738
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,783
- Everything.

739
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:43,394
(gravel scraping)

740
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,727
(chuckling)

741
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,693
Lookit that, look (laughs)!
- You know (laughs)!

742
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:54,443
(engine revving)

743
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,540
Smart alecky bad manners
you can forgive that,

744
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,400
but now wastefulness, that's a sin!

745
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,377
- Oh my god!

746
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:02,620
- Hmph, you know they aint nothing

747
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,013
but the devil's (mumbles), (chuckles).

748
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:09,108
(engine revving)

749
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:11,290
- You know that plane's
gonna take me to Brazil.

750
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,710
(airplane engine droning)

751
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,610
- Listen I'm not ready to let you go.

752
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,170
- Well, I might uh--
- Need you here, need you

753
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,133
right here now!

754
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,595
- You sure?
- Yeah I'm sure!

755
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:21,800
(sighing)
You just tell that plane

756
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,410
of yours, that (stammers) we-we don't

757
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,070
want you going nowhere,
especially to Brazil.

758
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,640
- Well there's a lot
of monkeys down there.

759
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,360
You know what you can do with them?

760
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,086
- Yeah but uh...

761
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:32,134
- Think about it.

762
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:33,240
(chuckling)

763
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,347
- Hey, you want to take me with 'ya?

764
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,900
We'll both go to Brazil.

765
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,558
- Okay.
- Play with the monkeys, huh?

766
00:38:39,558 --> 00:38:40,580
- Play with monkeys,

767
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,095
put bananas in hidden places.

768
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:43,404
(chuckling)

769
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,254
(grunts) I got diarrhea, (mumbles)...

770
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,090
(static hissing)
- Sheriff, are you there?

771
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,350
- Copy Maggie.

772
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,670
(static hissing)
- We got an ID on the

773
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,340
plate you wanted run,
the vehicle's registered

774
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,340
to a Bradley K. Mitchell.
(static hissing)

775
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,190
- Copy that Maggie.

776
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,280
Listen, get Kevin on
the horn, and tell him

777
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,370
that I'm going back out to the east ridge.

778
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,420
I think I might have
found our missing hikers.

779
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,391
Out.
(energetic dramatic music)

780
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:18,141
(truck rattling)

781
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:26,073
(leaves rustling)

782
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:26,945
Maggie?

783
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:28,670
(static hissing)
- Copy that Sheriff.

784
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,010
- Definitely something going on here,

785
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,304
do me a favor, and uh,
call my wife, would 'ya.

786
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:35,660
(static hissing)
- I'll call your wife

787
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,599
right now Sheriff, over and out.

788
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,820
- Mitchell!
(crow cawing)

789
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,890
(foreboding music)

790
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:40,723
Scott!

791
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:43,615
Anybody there?

792
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:47,377
(birds chirping)

793
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:51,896
Mitchell?

794
00:39:58,415 --> 00:40:01,248
(hinges creaking)

795
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:03,136
Scott?

796
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:07,282
(boards creaking)

797
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,365
Anybody here?

798
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:12,462
(hinges creaking)

799
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,991
(door thumping)

800
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,270
(grunting)

801
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:50,396
(sighing)

802
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:53,954
(ominous music)

803
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:05,358
(suspenseful music)

804
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:13,143
(static hissing)
Maggie, I want you to

805
00:41:13,143 --> 00:41:14,522
get somebody out...

806
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:15,355
Shit!

807
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:19,876
(thumping)
God, dammit,

808
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:20,793

809
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:25,673
(tense music)

810
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:31,283
Ah (pants)...

811
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:40,658
(wheezing)

812
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:42,449
(groaning)

813
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:43,282
Oh god...

814
00:41:45,943 --> 00:41:46,776
Ah...

815
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,593
(thumping)
Shit...

816
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:57,137
Oh, (sighs)...

817
00:41:57,137 --> 00:42:00,730
Finish it hey, you psycho son of a bitch!

818
00:42:01,578 --> 00:42:02,962
(grunting)

819
00:42:02,962 --> 00:42:03,795
Ah!

820
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:06,595
(groaning)

821
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:07,896
(grunting)
(thudding)

822
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:10,146
(groaning)

823
00:42:19,443 --> 00:42:21,943
(footsteps tapping)

824
00:42:21,943 --> 00:42:24,693
(dramatic music)

825
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:28,246
(tense music)

826
00:42:32,123 --> 00:42:34,706
(gun clicking)

827
00:42:51,781 --> 00:42:54,793
- Freeze scum bag drop your
hands and raise your gun!

828
00:42:54,793 --> 00:42:55,648
Oh Harold!

829
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:57,744
(Harold groaning)
Harold, good god almighty

830
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:58,932
(Harold coughing)

831
00:42:58,932 --> 00:43:00,471
Hey, hold it!

832
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:01,659

00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:05,858
(mumbling)
(scuffling)

835
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:08,519
Uh, oh, Harold!

836
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,019

(mumbling)

837
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,940
You okay?

838
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,320
- Hell no I'm not okay!

839
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,370
I got hotdog meat coming out of my nose!

840
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,030
You didn't have to push so hard, damn ya!

841
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,124
- Look at all the mess you made,

842
00:43:28,124 --> 00:43:29,701
like come on, uh here.

843
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:30,534
(grunting)
Like what do you think?

844
00:43:30,534 --> 00:43:33,110
What does it look like to you?

845
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,343
- Looks like a whole bunch
of spilled ketchup to me.

846
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,600
- Doesn't look like a whole
bunch of spilled ketchup.

847
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,047
Looks like a dead body
was dragged in here,

848
00:43:41,047 --> 00:43:43,120
that's what it looks like to me!

849
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,640
- You smoke that silly tobacco don't ya?

850
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,253
Now why didn't you take a big whiff?

851
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:52,010
Smells like a damn ketchup farm in here!

852
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,850
- Okay let's just drop it all right?

853
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:54,683
Where's Maggie?

854
00:43:55,824 --> 00:43:58,352
- Sure, I'll drop it.

855
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:01,273
The townfolks are gonna have a field day.

856
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,600
- Harold I already asked
you, where's Maggie?

857
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,620
- Ah Maggie had her choir practice,

858
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,563
left about 20 minutes ago.

859
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:12,560
- Have you heard from the Sheriff?

860
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,000
- Uh a call of some kind come over about

861
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,703
five minutes before you'd come in.

862
00:44:16,703 --> 00:44:18,784
- But was it the Sheriff?

863
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:22,400
- I don't know, nothing but a (gags),

864
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,840
sound like maybe the radio
was broke or something.

865
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,542
- Figures, I get mine
fixed, maybe his is broken.

866
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,042
(perky music)

867
00:44:37,452 --> 00:44:38,702
(birds chirping)

868
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:42,200
- All right, we'll stop
right here and hike in.

869
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,520
- Quite the Johnny on the spot aren't we?

870
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,522
Sorry.

871
00:44:45,522 --> 00:44:47,190
(tense music)
(chattering)

872
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:52,190
- Whoo!
(doors thumping)

873
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:55,296
(foreboding music)

874
00:45:04,813 --> 00:45:07,563
(paper rustling)

875
00:45:10,183 --> 00:45:11,570
- I don't believe this.

876
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,892
I don't believe this!

877
00:45:16,892 --> 00:45:19,043
(static hissing)
Sheriff this is Kevin, over!

878
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,128
Sheriff this is Kevin,

879
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:22,540
I don't know if you can hear me but,

880
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,940
we got a problem here.

881
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,960
(static hissing)
Sheriff this is Kevin, over.

882
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,130
(wet thudding)

883
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,247
Damn where are you?

884
00:45:29,749 --> 00:45:30,895
I don't know if you can
hear me there might be

885
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,580
something wrong with your radio but,

886
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,470
the plates on the cars
in the reservoir match

887
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,517
most of the names in
the missing report file!

888
00:45:36,517 --> 00:45:38,730
(static hissing)
Well, I'll be waiting

889
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,451
for you at the station.

890
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:41,837
Over.
(static hissing)

891
00:45:41,837 --> 00:45:45,052
(wet thudding)

892
00:45:45,052 --> 00:45:47,802
(birds chirping)

893
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:51,440
(leaves rustling)
- You know what this

894
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,470
reminds me of?

895
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,070
- What?
- That movie with those

896
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,957
werewolves in London and those,

897
00:45:55,957 --> 00:45:57,110
those two--
- American Werewolf in London.

898
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,933
- [Billy] Yeah that was the
first movie my dad took me to.

899
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:01,210
- [Johnny] Awe sweet, hey
how is your dad doing?

900
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,533
Business good?
- He's doing all right,

901
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:04,851
as long as people keep dying.

902
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:05,684
(chuckling)
- Wait what's that

903
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:08,603
supposed to mean?
- My dad's a mortician.

904
00:46:09,438 --> 00:46:13,000
When we were kids, we used
to play around in there,

905
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,858
like Dr. Frankenstein.

906
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,950
(mumbling)
- That sounds really creepy.

907
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,440
- [Lehman] Ah, we didn't know
any better we were just kids.

908
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,510
- [Sunny] No, there was
this one time though man,

909
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,600
night stalker, remember him?

910
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,066
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah, I almost

911
00:46:25,066 --> 00:46:27,280
forgot about that, that freaked me out.

912
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,280
- [Sunny] Anyway yeah, so, eh--

913
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,147
- Sounds like (groans raspberry).

914
00:46:31,032 --> 00:46:31,965
It all escapes.

915
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:33,830
(chuckling)

916
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,370
- Hey man, you were such a
chicken shit, you know that.

917
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:41,623
I mean I remember what you
said to me, you know, Lehman?

918
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,223
Where is he?

919
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,580
- He was here like a second ago.

920
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,700
H-H-He stopped to tie his shoes.

921
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,250
Lehman!

922
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,828
- Lehman?

923
00:46:50,828 --> 00:46:51,890
Lehman!

924
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:52,723
- Don't worry about it look,

925
00:46:52,723 --> 00:46:54,100
I'm gonna go back and look
for him, all right guys?

926
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,280
- No no no no, I think we should all go.

927
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,340
It's getting dark and I
don't want to wait around.

928
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,173
- I agree.

929
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,020
- Let's go back,

930
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,349
because personally, I
think he's messing with us.

931
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:06,682
- What a putz...

932
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,653
- Shh, here we go again.

933
00:47:10,558 --> 00:47:15,558
(foreboding music)
(birds chirping)

934
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,547
- [Billy] Hey guys check it out.

935
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,848
- Oh god!

936
00:47:37,848 --> 00:47:38,931
Oh, oh god...

937
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,014
- Heidi don't worry okay,
we're gonna find him.

938
00:47:44,014 --> 00:47:47,420
- Yeah just relax Heidi, he
pulls this shit all the time.

939
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,363
- Why don't we chill here for a minute.

940
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,123
- Lehman!

941
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,680
Lehman!

942
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,333
Stop screwing around.

943
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,060
Come on you guys you know how he is.

944
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,980
- Sh sh sh sh sh...

945
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,250
He's screwing around.
(strained shouting)

946
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,400
Did you guys hear that?

947
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,573
- Come on out lay man.

948
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,580
He hates that, we used to
call him that in high school.

949
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,075
Look he'll come running
out any second now.

950
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:17,182
(strained shouting)
(ominous music)

951
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:19,349
(gasping)

952
00:48:22,557 --> 00:48:23,979
(strained shouting)

953
00:48:23,979 --> 00:48:25,750
- I don't think that's Lehman, guys.

954
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,940
(sighing)
(leaves rustling)

955
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,496
- Heidi, no!

956
00:48:28,496 --> 00:48:30,611
(screaming)

957
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:31,468
Heidi!

958
00:48:31,468 --> 00:48:34,131
(screaming)
Stop!

959
00:48:34,131 --> 00:48:35,381
- Heidi, Heidi!

960
00:48:38,064 --> 00:48:39,826
(screaming)

961
00:48:39,826 --> 00:48:40,659
- Heidi, stop!

962
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:43,658
(Heidi whimpering)

963
00:48:43,658 --> 00:48:44,938
- Heidi!

964
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:47,149
(Heidi screaming)
Heidi!

965
00:48:47,149 --> 00:48:48,662
- [Johnny] Heidi!

966
00:48:48,662 --> 00:48:49,805
Stop!

967
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:50,966
(screaming)

968
00:48:50,966 --> 00:48:52,631
(thumping)
- (screams) No!

969
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:54,017
- Stop, just stop it!
(sobbing)

970
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:56,768
Stop it!
- Oh, hey guys what's up,

971
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,208
I'm glad I found you!

972
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:00,271
- You dick, you're sick!

973
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,940
How could you do this to me?

974
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,530
- Dick?
- What are you brain dead?

975
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,130
You scared the shit out of her!

976
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:08,030
- Whoa-oh-oh, kick back Tyson,
what are you talking about?

977
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,610
- (pants) Where was he?

978
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,550
- You're right Billy it was him!

979
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,580
- You're all whacked, I'm not having fun,

980
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,820
I want to go home!

981
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,327
- My lungs are on fire!

982
00:49:18,327 --> 00:49:20,620
- (sighs) Just wait a damn minute here!

983
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,610
- Wait for what?

984
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,890
You keep pulling this shit somebody's

985
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,290
gonna get hurt, Lehman!

986
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,408
- It's too late.

987
00:49:25,408 --> 00:49:28,320
(winces) I sprained my ankle.

988
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,153
- See?

989
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,130
- Are you okay my little bud?

990
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:34,990
- Such a shit head man.

991
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,720
- I can't believe this,
what are you blaming me for,

992
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,700
I didn't do anything!

993
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,550
- That's bullshit!

994
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,180
Leaving your pack in
the middle of the path

995
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,350
knowing we'd stumble across it

996
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,200
and go looking for your sorry ass?

997
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,440
The whole time you're
fucking (moist smacking),

998
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,233
jacking off in the woods?

999
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,140
We talked about this Lehman,

1000
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,340
you promised me you
wouldn't pull this shit!

1001
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,720
- And I didn't!

1002
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,870
I bent down to tie my
show, I saw a rabbit!

1003
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,600
- Oh please!

1004
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,010
- I swear you guys!

1005
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,043
I took off my pack and went after it!

1006
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:03,780
I-I started going in the other direction,

1007
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,330
and I got all turned around and shit,

1008
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,290
I thought I lost you guys!

1009
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,560
I wasn't playing around though, I mean it!

1010
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,490
I, just wanted to surprise everyone,

1011
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,720
figured we'd have rabbit for dinner.

1012
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,160
- A rabbit?

1013
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,210
How could you even catch a rabbit Lehman?

1014
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,200
The growling, grr, that
was a real nice touch!

1015
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,123
Lame!
- I swear it.

1016
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,043
Growling?

1017
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,283
Guys, listen, I didn't do anything, okay?

1018
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,853
Now while I was out there I,

1019
00:50:35,853 --> 00:50:37,690
I think I saw a cabin or something over in

1020
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,973
that area over there,
we should check it out.

1021
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,653
We need to keep warm and Sunny
needs to put her foot up.

1022
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,673
- Let's just get our packs.

1023
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,580
- Hey squeeze, you okay?

1024
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,940
- Yeah.

1025
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,773
You?

1026
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,383
I'm sorry.

1027
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:03,825
- Sh...

1028
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:06,742
(foreboding music)

1029
00:51:12,348 --> 00:51:13,872
- Ah!
- Cool!

1030
00:51:13,872 --> 00:51:15,050
(crickets chirping)

1031
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,313
Wow this is funky!

1032
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:19,070
(chuckling)
- Yeah,

1033
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:20,710
this is killer!

1034
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,130
- Hey, Lehman, if there is anybody

1035
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,565
living here they're probably
asleep, come on let's go.

1036
00:51:25,565 --> 00:51:26,570
- Nah I don't think anyone lives here,

1037
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,960
it looks deserted.
(ominous music)

1038
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,910
Check it out, it's got a fireplace!

1039
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,580
Score!
- I don't think we

1040
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,360
should go in.
- Oh come on,

1041
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,140
we got nothing to worry about.

1042
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,815
I'm just gonna sneak a little peak, okay?

1043
00:51:37,815 --> 00:51:40,569
(ominous music)

1044
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:43,069
(thumping)
Ah!

1045
00:51:44,565 --> 00:51:46,220
All right, who's coming with me?

1046
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,481
- I'll go.

1047
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:48,370
- Be careful.

1048
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,480
- Oh god, would you
quit that, so dramatic!

1049
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,720
Look, I say we crash out here and just

1050
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,187
leave first thing in
the morning, all right?

1051
00:51:55,187 --> 00:51:57,220
- Hey Billy toss me your light.

1052
00:51:58,158 --> 00:51:59,071
(owl hooting)
(thumping)

1053
00:51:59,071 --> 00:52:01,209
(fluttering)
(screaming)

1054
00:52:01,209 --> 00:52:02,260
- Shit!
- Shit,

1055
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,139
what the hell was that?

1056
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:06,130
(crow cawing)

1057
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,460
- I don't know.

1058
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,660
I think I got pudding in my wares.

1059
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,270
- I'm sorry you guys but
I've had enough of this shit!

1060
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,011
You can just get in there
and get it over with!

1061
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:19,249
- Ooh, sassy, I love it
when you're like that baby!

1062
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:22,167
(mumbles) fire, come on then!

1063
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:23,000
Go on!

1064
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:30,026
(packs rustling)

1065
00:52:30,026 --> 00:52:32,270
- What do you think?
(tense poignant music)

1066
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:33,902
Well?

1067
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:36,652
I don't think anybody lives here.

1068
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,093
- Ooh...
- Ah sweet!

1069
00:52:47,673 --> 00:52:52,173
- [Johnny] Hey Lehman, check
it out, looks like blood.

1070
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,000
- Probably animal blood.

1071
00:52:56,564 --> 00:52:58,414
(mumbles) these people were trappers.

1072
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,190
Ain't no thing but a chicken on a string.

1073
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,880
- Hey, don't say chicken.

1074
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,243
- Right.
(chuckling)

1075
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,220
- Hey, sorry going, sorry
for going off on 'ya

1076
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,830
out there man that was uncool, you know.

1077
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,260
- Don't worry about it bro it's cool.

1078
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,093
- Yeah?

1079
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:19,550
(thudding)
(foreboding music)

1080
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:21,440
- [Lehman] Let's go tell
'em this place is all empty.

1081
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,040
- Yeah.

1082
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,860
Oh hey, check this out.

1083
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,431
(screaming)
(squealing)

1084
00:53:27,431 --> 00:53:28,820
Just kidding it's empty.

1085
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,920
- Sweet fireplace!

1086
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,700
I think we should just
chill here for the night.

1087
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,464
She gotta put that foot up.
- Yeah sounds good,

1088
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:36,780
my foot is killing me you guys.

1089
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,910
- [Billy] Okay, I'm in.

1090
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,380
- [Lehman] Babe?

1091
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,830
- [Heidi] Yeah, okay
Lehman, but you don't--

1092
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,470
- [Lehman] I swear, I'll
keep you comfy cozy.

1093
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,840
- [Kate] All right, what
do you guys, (mumbles),

1094
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,750
what if the someone comes home?

1095
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:50,025
- [Leahman] Oh it's dead in
there, no one lives there.

1096
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:50,932
And if someone does come home,

1097
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:53,400
well then we'll just deal with it.

1098
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,510
- [Johnny] You guys, I'm
gonna go look for some wood,

1099
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,930
we can have a campfire.
- Kickin' good idea!

1100
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,783
- I'll go with you.
- Oh good.

1101
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,962
(mumbling)

1102
00:54:05,962 --> 00:54:07,795
- Good Billy.
- Thanks.

1103
00:54:08,966 --> 00:54:10,911
- [Sunny] (mumbles)
break out the lanterns.

1104
00:54:10,911 --> 00:54:13,960
- I think she's nice, she's insecure.

1105
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,100
She's got all this deep rooted pain,

1106
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,290
you know did you see how she
panicked, that's not normal,

1107
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,120
I think that her pain--
- Stop it, stop it!

1108
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,610
You said you'd leave your work at home,

1109
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,590
no, no psychoanalyzing anybody,

1110
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:25,440
no probing into people's issues.

1111
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,068
- [Kate] What are you so upset about?

1112
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:30,111
(insects chittering)

1113
00:54:30,111 --> 00:54:31,923
- I'm just a little on edge.

1114
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,660
- [Kate] Why?

1115
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,260
- Well gee I don't know Kate, I mean,

1116
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,950
normally you tell me when
you go to the doctor's.

1117
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,750
This morning Dr.
Binderman leaves a message

1118
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,583
on the machine saying
something about test results.

1119
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,580
(chuckles) What's that about Kate?

1120
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,688
(owl hooting)

1121
00:54:49,688 --> 00:54:51,792
(sighing)

1122
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:52,625
- Oh God.

1123
00:54:53,887 --> 00:54:54,853
- Oh, oh god what?

1124
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,230
W-W-What are the results about, Kate?

1125
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,770
- I, I was just having some
blood work done, that's all.

1126
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:02,603
- For what?

1127
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,080
- Well, I don't know if I was,

1128
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,183
ready to tell you.

1129
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:11,370
- (chuckles) Oh yeah.

1130
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:14,120
Now you have to tell me, come
on, what's going on Kate?

1131
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,560
- Johnny I just, I wanted to be sure

1132
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,723
before I said anything.

1133
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,493
- Well are you going to tell me?

1134
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:28,979
Kate come on you're
scaring the shit out of me.

1135
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:30,400
(wood clattering)

1136
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,573
What's going on baby, is everything okay?

1137
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,613
You sick?

1138
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,883
- Only in the mornings.

1139
00:55:41,748 --> 00:55:43,170
(chuckling)

1140
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,900
- You're pregnant?

1141
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,550
- Well it's not 100% sure
yet but it's pretty close.

1142
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,113
- Oh thank god, that's uh this is amazing!

1143
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,080
- Are you mad?
- No.

1144
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,540
- I'm sorry.
- No don't be sorry,

1145
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,500
that's crazy, I'm just
glad you're all right.

1146
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,000
This is beautiful man!

1147
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,006
- Really?

1148
00:56:00,006 --> 00:56:00,880
- Yeah.
- You're okay with it?

1149
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,713
- Yeah!

1150
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,740
Well I (sighs),

1151
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:08,740
it's a little sooner than
I expected but, yeah, yeah.

1152
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,093
Shit I need a cigarette!

1153
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,930
- You know you're gonna
have to smoke outside

1154
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:13,980
after the baby comes.

1155
00:56:15,678 --> 00:56:17,045
- (sighs) That sounds so weird,

1156
00:56:17,045 --> 00:56:18,977
doesn't it?
- (giggles) Yeah.

1157
00:56:18,977 --> 00:56:20,663
- Oh my god you're pregnant!

1158
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:22,999
Come here.

1159
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:27,438
(serene music)

1160
00:56:27,438 --> 00:56:29,695
(lips smacking)
I love you baby.

1161
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:33,879
(fire crackling)
(crickets chirping)

1162
00:56:33,879 --> 00:56:35,603
- (sighs) That wasn't half bad.

1163
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,020
- Well yay it wasn't half good either.

1164
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,613
- I liked it, it sorta tasted like,

1165
00:56:43,825 --> 00:56:45,100
uh rabbit.
- Really.

1166
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:48,063
- Kate, you want to tell 'em?

1167
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,543
- Well,

1168
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:55,160
me and Johnny are gonna have a baby.

1169
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,350
- Hmm?
- You're pregnant?

1170
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:59,274
That's (mumbles).
- Wow...

1171
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:01,623
- Oh my god!
- All right, (mumbles) bro!

1172
00:57:01,623 --> 00:57:03,063
(mumbling)
Congrats!

1173
00:57:03,063 --> 00:57:04,567
- Thanks man.
- That's big time!

1174
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:05,400
Did you hear that?
(squealing)

1175
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,845
Oh shit!
- Baby, I'm (giggles)...

1176
00:57:07,845 --> 00:57:09,100
- You okay?

1177
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,440
Okay, for this special occasion,

1178
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,764
I want Billy to read his
new poem, it is thick man!

1179
00:57:16,764 --> 00:57:17,681
- Oh, okay.

1180
00:57:18,904 --> 00:57:20,062
- Sorry baby, (mumbles).

1181
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:20,990
(lips smacking)
- Okay I'm gonna go

1182
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,450
freshen up.

1183
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,390
- This doesn't have a title.

1184
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,230
- Say it loud enough so I can hear, okay?

1185
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,180
I'll leave the door open.

1186
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:32,777
(serene music)
- If only I could set free,

1187
00:57:32,777 --> 00:57:35,083
that which is written
upon my heart's soul,

1188
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,360
weeping favors held close to my bosom,

1189
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,093
for it is where all of
life's tragedies converge.

1190
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,253
Fear not the pondering dualities of life,

1191
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,597
those of which are summoned against you.

1192
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,680
You can and will conquer
the forces that one has

1193
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,260
to face, as the focus
(ominous music)

1194
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,043
of your eyes and the (mumbles),

1195
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:01,112
are mirrored upon you.

1196
00:58:02,543 --> 00:58:06,123
You are vulnerable, and
they are one in the same.

1197
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,640
Relinquish the things you most cherish,

1198
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,773
as death is the beholder of
all truths in your nakedness.

1199
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,773
Death only knows, what
its victims last see.

1200
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:24,180
The purity of life however,
rises above the demiser,

1201
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,743
the forsaker of breath,

1202
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,120
putting the rest, the spinning thoughts,

1203
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,343
the robber of moments, if
only they were let go of,

1204
00:58:35,314 --> 00:58:38,810
to trail behind, like grains of dark sand,

1205
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,273
to bid them, an ado.

1206
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,830
- I don't know what
the hell you just said,

1207
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,612
but it made me real horny!

1208
00:58:47,612 --> 00:58:49,915
(chuckling)

1209
00:58:49,915 --> 00:58:50,965
(gasping)
(screaming)

1210
00:58:50,965 --> 00:58:54,215
(thudding)
What the...

1211
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:58,127
- You guys, guys, you guys!

1212
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,593
- Heidi!
(ominous music)

1213
00:59:05,897 --> 00:59:08,897
(suspenseful music)

1214
00:59:17,645 --> 00:59:18,478
(squeaking)

1215
00:59:18,478 --> 00:59:19,868
- Oh, god.
(giggling)

1216
00:59:19,868 --> 00:59:22,715
(whimpering)
(chuckling)

1217
00:59:22,715 --> 00:59:25,843
Oh, oh, I'm sorry baby but,

1218
00:59:25,843 --> 00:59:27,920
that was just a ridiculous scream.

1219
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,270
- Wow, this is beginning
(sighing)

1220
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,101
to be quite a trip.

1221
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:31,934
(throat clearing)
- Are you okay?

1222
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:34,229
- (sighs) Oh, yeah, (mumbles)
Lehman baby just please

1223
00:59:34,229 --> 00:59:35,550
get it out of here!
(mouse squeaking)

1224
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:36,791
- Dessert anyone?

1225
00:59:36,791 --> 00:59:38,019
(squealing)
- Eww.

1226
00:59:38,019 --> 00:59:40,966
- (chuckles) All right,
come on little guy.

1227
00:59:40,966 --> 00:59:42,137
(door thumping)
(ominous music)

1228
00:59:42,137 --> 00:59:43,533
Here you go little fella.

1229
00:59:46,938 --> 00:59:48,391
(clapping)
Okay.

1230
00:59:48,391 --> 00:59:49,457
- Yay.

1231
00:59:49,457 --> 00:59:50,959
- [Heidi] (sighs) Thank you baby.

1232
00:59:50,959 --> 00:59:53,235
- Oh thank you, for this!

1233
00:59:53,235 --> 00:59:56,920
(giggling)
I'm about to plode!

1234
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,293
- I'm so sorry about that you guys,

1235
00:59:59,293 --> 01:00:02,639
I just, I'm really scared of mice.

1236
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:04,972
(squeaking)

1237
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:14,400
- Hey you guys, we're gonna
uh, take a little walk,

1238
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,693
so don't wait up, okay?

1239
01:00:18,075 --> 01:00:19,837
(crickets chirping)
(fire crackling)

1240
01:00:19,837 --> 01:00:20,795
(squealing)

1241
01:00:20,795 --> 01:00:22,962
(sighing)

1242
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:26,110
- Would you just help me
inside, just help me inside,

1243
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:28,208
I'm freaking out out here.

1244
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:32,850
(grunting)
(feet scuffling)

1245
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:33,683
- Are you okay?

1246
01:00:35,184 --> 01:00:38,350
You know, with what happened
before we found the cabin?

1247
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:39,313
- Yeah I'm fine.

1248
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:42,440
I had a very emotional experience

1249
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,550
in a forest when I was younger.

1250
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:46,023
Sometimes it still haunts me.

1251
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:49,670
- Do you want to talk about it?

1252
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,970
- Not really, do you mind?

1253
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:54,490
I just want to enjoy the moment with you,

1254
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:55,663
not go there right now.

1255
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,373
- Sure.

1256
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:01,970
- Hey Sunny how's your foot?

1257
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,017
Can I get you anything?

1258
01:01:03,017 --> 01:01:04,741
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

1259
01:01:04,741 --> 01:01:06,191
I mean it hurts but I'm cool.

1260
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,533
- Guys want to tell uh, scary stories?

1261
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:13,600
- No, that's so typical.

1262
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,350
- Yeah that's exactly what
everybody else would do.

1263
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,630
I mean it's so perfect with the candles,

1264
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:21,230
and the fire.
- Well maybe just one.

1265
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,597
- Yeah, yeah (giggles)!

1266
01:01:23,998 --> 01:01:26,520
Oh this is fun, I wish we had smores!

1267
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,530
- Okay Billy, you got a good story for us?

1268
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,463
- Well, no not really.

1269
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,010
- [Sunny] Then why'd you bring it up then?

1270
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:35,610
- Well I would like to hear someone else

1271
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:37,720
tell a story for a change.

1272
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,587
- I've got one.

1273
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:42,000
- Uh oh this is gonna be good.

1274
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,463
When he talks like that.

1275
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,470
- It's about this guy,

1276
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,170
calls himself the Empty Man.

1277
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:51,853
- Wooh shit I'm scared already.

1278
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,683
- He's an EMT, emergency
medical technician,

1279
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,483
killed 27 people.

1280
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,930
- How?

1281
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:05,700
- Well, it all started
when his, fiancee dies,

1282
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,100
the love of his life, right?

1283
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,270
She needed a new heart and
there were no organ donors.

1284
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:14,900
So anyway, her death not only causes him

1285
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,840
to go completely insane,
but it spawned this,

1286
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:23,070
incredible hatred, towards non-donors.

1287
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,360
Took him like a year and a half before he

1288
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,021
finally went back to work.

1289
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:29,280
(tense music)

1290
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,570
And that's when his quiet massacre began.

1291
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:35,593
- [Billy] Why, I mean, what was his trip?

1292
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,273
- [Johnny] Well I already told you he

1293
01:02:37,273 --> 01:02:38,303
was an EMT, right?

1294
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,500
He would show up on the
scene of an accident,

1295
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,420
and he'd, go through their stuff

1296
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,670
and find their ID, and he'd check for that

1297
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:49,390
little, pink dot.
- The donor sticker.

1298
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,223
- Right.

1299
01:02:50,223 --> 01:02:52,000
These people are still alive, right?

1300
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,121
Well if they had that little
pink dot they'd stay that way.

1301
01:02:56,121 --> 01:02:57,320
But if they didn't, he'd take one out

1302
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,213
and put it on it.
- Shit!

1303
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,970
That's gnarly!

1304
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:03,230
- Remember he's got a partner so he's

1305
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,730
gotta be really careful right?

1306
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,130
So what he does, is he gets an empty

1307
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:10,220
hypodermic needle, and he injects it

1308
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,260
into their neck, which
causes air to go into

1309
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,730
the blood stream, makes the heart go into

1310
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,810
cardiac arrest, okay?

1311
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,610
So then, he tries to CPR,

1312
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:20,150
he's rubbing defibrillator paddles,

1313
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:21,913
trying all that, all just for show.

1314
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,430
- Wow.

1315
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,263
- Yeah.

1316
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:32,300
So anyway, his partner starts
to get suspicious, okay?

1317
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,650
I mean, month after month,

1318
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:36,050
people are dying of injuries
that are not that serious,

1319
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:40,140
so, the authorities
start an investigation.

1320
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,950
They exhume the bodies, of all the people

1321
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:44,060
that died in his care.

1322
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,670
Every single one of
them, had a puncture mark

1323
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,363
from a hypodermic needle and,

1324
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,100
their hearts were torn out.

1325
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:56,100
And he confesses to 17 murders,
all from accident victims.

1326
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,163
And get this, 10 more, all of them women.

1327
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:04,043
And when they go to his house,

1328
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,110
they find buckets of dried cement

1329
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,093
with chopped up body parts.

1330
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,950
He's also got this little fish tank,

1331
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:15,950
but there's no little fishies
swimming around in there,

1332
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:17,693
it's filled with formaldehyde,

1333
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:23,950
and it's floating 27 hearts.

1334
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:24,783
- Wow.

1335
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,973
Well they can't say he
was a heartless bastard.

1336
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,729
- That's psychotic.

1337
01:04:31,729 --> 01:04:33,710
(scoffing)

1338
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:35,380
- Strange.

1339
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,623
Why the Empty Man?

1340
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,650
- Well, he was an EMT.

1341
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:42,980
E, plus M, hypen T, EMT

1342
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,410
M-T, M-T, right?

1343
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,943
When his fiance died, he said
he just felt empty inside.

1344
01:04:48,943 --> 01:04:50,207
Thus the Empty Man.

1345
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,190
- It's sad and gruesome at the same time.

1346
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,117
- Strange.

1347
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:57,300
I mean he probably saved some lives

1348
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,840
as a result of the murders.

1349
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,310
- Irony melts like cold
hot steel this evening.

1350
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:05,799
- Isn't that an oxymoron?

1351
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:08,380
(rattling)
(sighing)

1352
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:09,213
- No.

1353
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,693
It's actually beginnings
of a new piece of work.

1354
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,403
That's what this is!

1355
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:22,150
- Ooh my baby's gonna create,

1356
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:24,530
give birth to a new piece of art!

1357
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,010
Like you guys!

1358
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:27,393
I'm so happy for you guys.

1359
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:35,150
Well, I'm tired you guys,
I go sleepy, night-night!

1360
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:38,305
(lips smacking)

1361
01:05:38,305 --> 01:05:40,810
(crickets chirping)

1362
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,010
- When I was growing up,

1363
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:47,033
my father and I had, a
special place we would go.

1364
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,433
This is back home in Michigan.

1365
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:54,053
It was a forest, like out of a fairy tale,

1366
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:58,993
a beautiful magical
place, he loved it there.

1367
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,420
One day when we were out there,

1368
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,583
he told me he'd have
to be going away soon.

1369
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,563
He told me that he had cancer.

1370
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,650
A week later when he disappeared

1371
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,550
I knew in my heart where I'd find him.

1372
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,690
I went, out to our spot, and found him

1373
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:22,910
laying on his favorite blanket,

1374
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:24,743
with an empty bottle of Seconals.

1375
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,920
After they took him away, (sighs),

1376
01:06:32,961 --> 01:06:34,493
I sat there for hours,

1377
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,487
and told him everything I
ever wanted to tell him.

1378
01:06:38,487 --> 01:06:40,737
(sniffing)

1379
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:49,283
(sighing)

1380
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:54,243
I understood, he didn't
want to wither away.

1381
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,523
He had a lot of pride.

1382
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:02,310
(sighing)

1383
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,760
I never went out there again.

1384
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:08,250
That's why it's weird
for me being out here.

1385
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,040
He was my best friend.

1386
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,880
- I'm so sorry, he had...

1387
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,340
- I learned one thing from all of that.

1388
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,173
- What?

1389
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,223
- That everything is temporary.

1390
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,570
No matter how you try
to keep things the same,

1391
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:27,083
they grow, and evolve,
into something else.

1392
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,618
I'm sorry, I know I'm
getting all heavy on you.

1393
01:07:32,618 --> 01:07:35,848
- Hey, I can handle anything.

1394
01:07:35,848 --> 01:07:38,007
The only thing I can't
handle, is my bladder.

1395
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:39,331
(chuckling)
My teeth are floating,

1396
01:07:39,331 --> 01:07:42,059
would you excuse me for a minute?

1397
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:43,270
(lips smacking)

1398
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:45,480
- Put your shoes on I
don't want you to get hurt.

1399
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,079
- Oh, look at that,
getting all maternal on me!

1400
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:51,519
(chuckling)
Okay.

1401
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:54,080
(grunting)

1402
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:54,935
Be right back.

1403
01:07:54,935 --> 01:07:55,894
- Okay.
(lips smacking)

1404
01:07:55,894 --> 01:07:58,477
(serene music)

1405
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:06,715
(foreboding music)

1406
01:08:13,698 --> 01:08:15,613
(static hissing)
- Sheriff this is Kevin, over!

1407
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:17,570
(static whistling)

1408
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:20,012
Sheriff, this is, dammit!

1409
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,681
(ominous music)
(crickets chirping)

1410
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,514

1413
01:08:37,775 --> 01:08:39,942
(gasping)

1414
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:44,136
- Oh, I just had the scariest dream!

1415
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:47,377
(ominous music)
(sighing)

1416
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:50,596
(mumbling)
(wet snapping)

1417
01:08:50,596 --> 01:08:55,596
(paper rustling)

1418
01:08:59,542 --> 01:09:03,613
(mumbles) up to here...

1419
01:09:03,613 --> 01:09:04,530
Or is this?

1420
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:10,235
(car rumbling)
(mumbling)

1421
01:09:10,235 --> 01:09:12,117
(crickets chirping)

1422
01:09:12,117 --> 01:09:16,053

01:09:16,053 --> 01:09:18,303
(grunting)

1424
01:09:19,182 --> 01:09:20,015
Ah...

Ah...

1426
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,880
Look at you.

1427
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,523
You're so beautiful.

1428
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,557
(lips smacking)

1429
01:09:38,621 --> 01:09:41,288
(ominous music)

1430
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,677

1432
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:03,339

01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:10,493
(strained shouting)

1435
01:10:10,493 --> 01:10:13,243
(dramatic music)

1436
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:21,400
- You know what I'd like to do?

1437
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,560
- What?

1438
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,210
- I'd like to take you on a trip.

1439
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:26,710
- That's what we're doing.

1440
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:30,093
- No, no I mean, just you
and me, just the two of us.

1441
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,960
- Where do you want to go?

1442
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,200
- I don't know, somewhere exciting

1443
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,687
and adventurous like
uh, Barstow (chuckles).

1444
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,270
No like uh, Bali or Prague,

1445
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:44,400
maybe down the Mississippi.
(lighter clicking)

1446
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,233
Billy.

1447
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:47,523
Billy!

1448
01:10:49,504 --> 01:10:50,387
Can you take that outside?

1449
01:10:50,387 --> 01:10:52,090
I don't want you to smoke out Kate,

1450
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,710
with the baby, you know.

1451
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:57,450
- I'm sorry I, I wasn't thinking.

1452
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:58,653
- No no that's cool.

1453
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,450
- Don't wait up for me you guys,

1454
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:05,660
it's sh, you know it's
all cooking up here.

1455
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,350
- Goodnight bro.
- Goodnight.

1456
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,433
- See ya later.

1457
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,902
(ominous music)

1458
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:14,863
(frantic music)

1459
01:11:14,863 --> 01:11:19,863
(footsteps rustling)
(crickets chirping)

1460
01:11:32,484 --> 01:11:34,984
(owl hooting)

1461
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:39,337
(ominous music)

1462
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:41,740
(lamp hissing)

1463
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:46,332
(sighs) The trees run wild
there in the darkness.

1464
01:11:46,332 --> 01:11:50,915
She lay before me, or lay (mumbles)...

1465
01:11:52,103 --> 01:11:54,936
Stood there with my beating heart.

1466
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,571
(hinges creaking)

1467
01:12:10,047 --> 01:12:10,880
Whoa.

1468
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:13,958
Whoa!

1469
01:12:16,904 --> 01:12:19,654
(brooding music)

1470
01:13:05,232 --> 01:13:08,149
(foreboding music)

1471
01:13:16,236 --> 01:13:19,153
(mysterious music)

1472
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:39,730
(faint creaking)
(suspenseful music)

1473
01:13:45,151 --> 01:13:45,984
Wow.

1474
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:11,694
(chuckling)

1475
01:14:17,609 --> 01:14:20,912

01:14:20,912 --> 01:14:23,245
(squishing)

1477
01:14:30,187 --> 01:14:32,437
(thudding)

1478
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,000
- Did you hear that?

1479
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,253
- What's that sweetheart?

1480
01:14:38,471 --> 01:14:40,860
- Hmm, I heard a noise, (sniffs), uh...

1481
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:47,613
Ah, it's already 2:30.

1482
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:51,197
I wonder where Lehman and Heidi are.

1483
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,680
I'm gonna go see if they're okay.

1484
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,547
(lips smacking)
- Hurry back,

1485
01:14:56,547 --> 01:14:58,454
I want you to cuddle up with me.

1486
01:14:58,454 --> 01:15:03,454
- Okay baby, (mumbles).

1487
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:09,130
(crickets chirping)

1488
01:15:14,904 --> 01:15:17,154
(thudding)

1489
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,193
Lehman and Heidi!

1490
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,790
Where are you guys!

1491
01:15:27,645 --> 01:15:30,732
(frantic music)

1492
01:15:30,732 --> 01:15:32,296
(siren wailing)

1493
01:15:32,296 --> 01:15:34,400
- (gasps) He's coming!

1494
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,599
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa buddy,

1495
01:15:35,599 --> 01:15:36,618
(mumbling)
back off, back from the car!

1496
01:15:36,618 --> 01:15:37,451
- Something you don't understand!

1497
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:38,284
- Back from the car!

1498
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,260
- He's gonna fucking kill me,
- No, no!

1499
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:40,638
Back off, back off!
- Heidi's dead, (mumbles),

1500
01:15:40,638 --> 01:15:41,471
give me that gun!
- No!

1501
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:43,975
(thumping)
No!

1502
01:15:43,975 --> 01:15:46,833
Oh (mumbles)!

1503
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,770
What the hell's going on tonight?

1504
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,513
Damn!

1505
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,419
- Lehman and Heidi!

1506
01:15:54,419 --> 01:15:56,370
(leaves rustling)
(crickets chirping)

1507
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:57,783
Where are you guys?

1508
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:04,720
Come on you guys it's getting cold,

1509
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,473
it's like, 2:30 in the morning!

1510
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:10,830
Heidi!

1511
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:11,663
Where's Lehman?

1512
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,913
Heidi, wake up!
(ominous music)

1513
01:16:20,596 --> 01:16:21,596
Oh uh, fuck!

1514
01:16:23,171 --> 01:16:24,421
Lehman, Lehman!

1515
01:16:25,595 --> 01:16:27,095
Lehman, oh my god!

1518
01:16:36,171 --> 01:16:38,016
(metallic snapping)
Ah!

01:16:38,016 --> 01:16:40,266
(groaning)

1520
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,470
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

1521
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:47,065

1522
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:47,898
Ow!

1523
01:16:48,927 --> 01:16:50,404
(groaning)

1524
01:16:50,404 --> 01:16:51,237
- Johnny?

1525
01:16:53,761 --> 01:16:54,640
- What's going on?

1526
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,260
- I don't know I just heard Johnny scream,

1527
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,010
look, stay here I'll be right back!

1528
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,233
- Kate, be careful!

1529
01:17:01,564 --> 01:17:02,990

1530
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,170

01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:09,307
- Johnny where are you?

1534
01:17:09,307 --> 01:17:10,890

1536
01:17:14,019 --> 01:17:15,401
- Johnny!

1537
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:16,650
(Johnny wincing)
What happened, what's wrong?

1538
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:19,052
Oh no my god, honey, no!

1539
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:21,693
What do I do?
- Get something to pry it off!

1540
01:17:21,693 --> 01:17:24,765
- Okay!
(groaning)

1541
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,443
- How did this happen to you?

1542
01:17:26,443 --> 01:17:27,276
- Get it off!

1543
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:28,614

(ominous music)

1546
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:34,677

(screaming)

1549
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:48,118

Johnny what's happening?

01:18:03,473 --> 01:18:04,560
Get it off!

1560
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,292
Run!
- No I can't!

1561
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:08,026
- Run Kate!
(Kate sobbing)

1562
01:18:08,026 --> 01:18:10,197
Run, run, run!

No, no, no, no, no!

(thudding)
(groaning)

1565
01:18:17,154 --> 01:18:19,321
(sighing)

1566
01:18:28,978 --> 01:18:30,500
- Well that is quite a story.

1567
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,500
- We've got to get back out there

1568
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,430
before my friends get killed!

1569
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:34,263
You think I'm lying?

1570
01:18:34,263 --> 01:18:36,620
Look at me, would I do this to myself?

1571
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,040
- Anything's possible.

1572
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,410
Then why'd you go for my gun?

1573
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,710
- I told you I was in shock,

1574
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,050
that guy was gonna fucking kill me!

1575
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,220
- We don't need to talk like that okay?

1576
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,060
- I don't give a shit we
need to get back out there!

1577
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:48,520
- Listen to me, let me explain
something for a second okay?

1578
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,950
Things like this just
don't happen in this town.

1579
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:51,850
Just let me think!

1580
01:18:57,033 --> 01:19:00,946
(crickets chirping)
(ominous music)

1581
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:03,723
(sighing)

1582
01:19:03,723 --> 01:19:05,973
(grunting)

1583
01:19:15,723 --> 01:19:17,890
(panting)

1584
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:22,658
(sobbing)

1585
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:23,491
- Please!

1586
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,233
Please don't hurt me (sobs)!

1587
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,763
(sobbing)

1588
01:19:41,873 --> 01:19:44,198
Why are you doing this?
- We're not to mix

1589
01:19:44,198 --> 01:19:46,093
(tense music)
with the outside world.

1590
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,400
Nobody knows about us out here,

1591
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,577
nobody ever will.

1592
01:19:51,577 --> 01:19:54,130
Ours will be a hard life but,

1593
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:55,430
but it's so very worth it.

1594
01:19:57,347 --> 01:19:59,957
(foreboding music)

1595
01:19:59,957 --> 01:20:01,987
Can you maybe take this off?

1596
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,553
- Okay.

1597
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,650
All right I want you to put
your hands through the bars.

1598
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:11,770
- Please I swear to god
I'm telling you the truth!

1599
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,950
- And this is all real hard to swallow.

1600
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:15,310
And I'm shaking inside
because I got a real

1601
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,502
bad feeling about this,
and if I don't cuff you,

1602
01:20:18,502 --> 01:20:20,380
and you do something stupid,

1603
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,213
I might just blow your head off

1604
01:20:21,213 --> 01:20:22,080
then we'd both be sorry.

1605
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,943
So put your hands through the bars!

1606
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,743
- It's hurting me!

1607
01:20:34,311 --> 01:20:36,478
(wincing)

1608
01:20:38,682 --> 01:20:40,849
(panting)

1609
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:48,393
Where are we?

1610
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:52,916
(tense music)

1611
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:58,743
Underneath the cabin?

1612
01:20:58,743 --> 01:21:00,146
(foreboding music)

1613
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:02,315
Oh god!

1614
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:04,898
(car rumbling)

1615
01:21:05,965 --> 01:21:07,360
- It's about to be light.

1616
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,887
You know you're running out of time.

1617
01:21:08,887 --> 01:21:10,137
- You gotta keep driving.

1618
01:21:11,304 --> 01:21:13,410
You gotta keep driving,
you don't understand,

1619
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,713
these are my best friends!

1620
01:21:15,651 --> 01:21:18,151
(tense music)

1621
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:21,683
- Is, my boyfriend outside okay?

1622
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,763
I mean, is he hurt?

1623
01:21:26,225 --> 01:21:28,620
(sobbing)

1624
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,143
Maybe I could, just go
outside and check on him.

1625
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:34,469
I mean (sighs),

1626
01:21:34,469 --> 01:21:35,784
(foreboding music)

1627
01:21:35,784 --> 01:21:36,617
oh...

1628
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:39,683
W-would you let me do that?

1629
01:21:41,103 --> 01:21:42,843
P-Please don't do this!

1630
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:46,120
Okay, okay, it's okay!

1631
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:50,439
But why are you doing this?

1632
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:52,951
Why are you doing this, why?

1633
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:55,969
Oh my god, (screams)!

1634
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:57,404
- Mother fucker!
(screaming)

1635
01:21:57,404 --> 01:21:59,881
(dramatic music)
(thudding)

1636
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:01,293
Are okay baby, are you okay,

1637
01:22:01,293 --> 01:22:02,623
(mumbling)
are you okay?

1638
01:22:02,623 --> 01:22:04,131
(sighing)
(mumbling)

1639
01:22:04,131 --> 01:22:05,379
He's dead, he's dead!

1640
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,337
Let's go!
- Okay.

1641
01:22:06,337 --> 01:22:07,693
- Let's go!

1642
01:22:07,693 --> 01:22:12,693
(Kate whimpering)
(Johnny grunting)

1643
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:21,394
(gravel crunching)
(crickets chirping)

1644
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:23,114
- Are you okay?
(grunting)

1645
01:22:23,114 --> 01:22:25,236
(groaning)
(scuffling)

1646
01:22:25,236 --> 01:22:27,170
(grunts) Johnny!
(groaning)

1647
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:29,410
Johnny!
- Get help, Kate get help!

1648
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,700
Get the keys, they're in the cabin, okay?

1649
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,211
Check on Sunny.
(ominous music)

1650
01:22:35,211 --> 01:22:37,523
Oh god, I'm in bad shape baby!

1651
01:22:37,523 --> 01:22:40,240
- [Kate] (sobs) Who is that
guy who, what's going on?

1652
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,926
- I don't know, I don't know,
(sobbing)

1653
01:22:41,926 --> 01:22:42,759
I don't know.

1654
01:22:42,759 --> 01:22:44,430
(mumbling)

1655
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:45,640
Go baby!
- Johnny come on!

1656
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,740
- No, uh I can't make it!

1657
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:48,018
- No you have to (mumbles)!
- Go, go by (mumbling)

1658
01:22:48,018 --> 01:22:49,967
Get to the road, (mumbles)...
- Johnny I'm not leaving you!

1659
01:22:49,967 --> 01:22:51,484
- Baby you have to make it!

1660
01:22:51,484 --> 01:22:52,734
I love you, go!

1661
01:22:58,255 --> 01:23:00,505
(grunting)

1662
01:23:02,835 --> 01:23:03,918
Run Kate run!

1663
01:23:06,801 --> 01:23:07,634
(thudding)
No!

1664
01:23:07,634 --> 01:23:09,826
(dramatic music)
(thumping)

1665
01:23:09,826 --> 01:23:14,659
(sobbing)
(ominous music)

1666
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,537
(whimpering)

1667
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:22,300
(grunting)
Oh no, oh no, oh no...

1668
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,717
(whimpering)

1669
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:36,333
(metallic snapping)

1670
01:23:41,253 --> 01:23:43,300
- It's about to be light,

1671
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,210
I'm gonna take you back in, I hope

1672
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:45,360
you got a good lawyer.

1673
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,580
- Please, I'm telling you it's ga--

1674
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:48,520
There it is, there's my truck!

1675
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,673
- I see it, I see it!

1676
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:56,730
All right, I want you to stay here.

1677
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:58,580
- No what do you mean,
I gotta go with you!

1678
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,440
- All right then, at least
you know where the cabin is,

1679
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,782
there's no use wasting any more time.

1680
01:24:02,782 --> 01:24:03,840
(door clattering)
All right come on.

1681
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,486
- Let me out, you gotta help me out!

1682
01:24:05,486 --> 01:24:10,486
(crickets chirping)
(birds chirping)

1683
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,587
(door clicking)

1684
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,321
All right it's just over here!
(door thudding)

1685
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:19,988
(ominous music)

1686
01:24:22,546 --> 01:24:25,379
(wooden creaking)

1687
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,898

01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,352
(foreboding music)

1689
01:24:35,352 --> 01:24:36,185
Hey you gotta take these off me now.

1690
01:24:36,185 --> 01:24:37,637
- Shh!
- What do you mean, shh?

1691
01:24:37,637 --> 01:24:39,210
He's gonna kill us, I--
- Shut up, I'm not

1692
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:40,310
playing with you okay?

1693
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:44,097
You go!
- Oh son of a...

1694
01:24:54,579 --> 01:24:57,412
(wooden creaking)

1695
01:25:06,292 --> 01:25:09,125
(hinges creaking)

1696
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,400
- [Kevin] Oh my god!

1697
01:25:22,069 --> 01:25:22,902
Oh my god!

1698
01:25:27,283 --> 01:25:29,229
Oh god help us!

1699
01:25:29,229 --> 01:25:31,059
(slamming)

1700
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:33,334
(suspenseful music)

1701
01:25:33,334 --> 01:25:36,714
(wet thudding)

1702
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:41,714
(eerie dramatic music)
(wet thudding)

1703
01:26:00,785 --> 01:26:04,295

1708
01:27:19,009 --> 01:27:22,676
(poignant mysterious music)
