1
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,097
Clyde?

2
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,227
I've always loved you, Bonnie.

3
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,521
I've always loved you.

4
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,234
How long is it gonna take?

5
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,361
Till it cools off.

6
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,041
Hey, keep them kids out of there!

7
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,751
Hey, hey, hey!

8
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,461
Slow down!

9
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:10,757
- Get back.
- Come on, let's see what's here.

10
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,469
Did you hear me?
Get back over here!

11
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:15,887
What is it?

12
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,097
Get back. Come on.

13
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,683
Boys, get away from there!

14
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,019
Get them out of here!
Do you hear me?

15
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:26,230
I was born Clyde Chestnut Barrow...

16
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:30,318
...in Telico, Texas,
on March 24th, 1909.

17
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,998
Being Christian,
I don't much believe in astrology...

18
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,459
...but I'm told I'm an Aries.

19
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,795
Three and seven
are my favorite numbers...

20
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,714
...end I keep e horseshoe
under my bed for good luck.

21
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,383
I like fast cars...

22
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,678
...girls you wanna talk to
much as undress...

23
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,638
...and my mama.

24
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,808
When I was 9 years old...

25
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,228
...I contracted e fever
of unexplained origin.

26
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:09,065
Almost died
before I really started living.

27
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,699
My great-grandma said
that was why the Lord saw Ht...

28
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,160
...to bless me with what she called
"the second sight."

29
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,040
Clyde?

30
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:30,128
Clyde?

31
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,049
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

32
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,809
Know what'll happen
if you get yourself better, little Clyde?

33
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:48,980
I 'll be out there waiting on you,
that's what.

34
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,778
I don't think he dead yet.

35
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,664
Come on.

36
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,754
- It needs more pepper.
- No.

37
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,674
I made what you like, you'll eat it
the way I make it. Now, have a seat.

38
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,177
I think it needs more pepper.

39
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,429
- Daddy, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

40
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,265
- Do you believe in angels?
- Of course I do.

41
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,143
You got one there on your shoulder.

42
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,604
Of course,
you got a devil on the other one.

43
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,397
Ob, baby, baby, baby.

44
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,192
No meat again?

45
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,736
You're a keen one,
you know that, Marvin?

46
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,946
Told you I don't wanna be called that.

47
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,574
- He wants to be called Buck.
- That's right.

48
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,910
How about we compromise
and call you a horse's ass?

49
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,829
Now, sit down
and eat your damn peas.

50
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,373
Hallelujah.

51
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:53,252
Clouds be gone.
Clyde Chestnut's got better.

52
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,217
You're my little ray of sunshine,
aren't you, Clyde?

53
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,097
My criminal career
began with my brother Buck...

54
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,933
- Hurry up.
- ...stealing chickens.

55
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,685
- I'm trying.
- We gotta go.

56
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,312
- Hey!
- Come on, Marvin!

57
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,940
It's Buck, doggone it!

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,361
- Go! Go, go!
- I'm going!

59
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:21,781
Run!

60
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:25,243
- Stop!
- You old coot!

61
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,333
Maybe if I hadn't found Bonnie Parker...

62
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,586
...all I'd ever be known for
was stealing chickens.

63
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:48,975
Come on!

64
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,202
You got music in your bones,
little man.

65
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:12,290
Is something eating at you, Clyde?

66
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:15,376
I saw something again, Mama.

67
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,044
Something happening to Buck.

68
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,423
Something might happen to Buck,
Clyde...

69
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,385
...but I don't need Great-Grandma's
second sight nonsense to know that.

70
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,680
Ain't nothing to it, you hear me?
Nothing.

71
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,267
What a smart kid does,
and that's what you are...

72
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,437
...he don't wait around
for visions of the future.

73
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:38,441
He starts to make the future happen
by what he does today.

74
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,944
You ain't just smart,
you got a good heart.

75
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,365
- Now, get your little butt to bed.
- All right.

76
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,248
Marvin.

77
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,501
Time to wake up.

78
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:43,130
Buck. Get your ugly butt up...

79
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,050
- ...got a hard day's work.
- No.

80
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,140
Hey, Clyde.

81
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,690
Ever seen a car like that?

82
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,359
That's a Ford Model A Victoria...

83
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,653
...four cylinders, leather back...

84
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,030
...about 40 horses under the hood.

85
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,617
Do about 50 without blowing a gasket,
maybe 55.

86
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,502
Sound like booze to you?

87
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,672
Don't think we're dressed
for the occasion. Let's go home.

88
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,802
What we lack in tailoring,
we'll make up for with charm. Come on.

89
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,596
Come on, free drinks.

90
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,226
All right, all right, hey, hey!

91
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:40,396
Hold it. I'll need all the boys
that ain't hitched yet...

92
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,565
...to come to the middle of the floor.

93
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,359
Leg, please.

94
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,197
Right on time.

95
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:56,454
Oh, this one's mine, boys,
this one's mine.

96
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,707
Here it comes.

97
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,388
I think you been gawking at the bride
long enough.

98
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,224
Why don't you and your buddy...

99
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,185
...take your party-crashing asses
out of here?

100
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:02,937
L-Hey.

101
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,565
- You hear me, boy?
- Oh, I hear you...

102
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,819
...but unless you plan on using that,
don't touch me again.

103
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,739
Come on, Clyde. Company ain't worth
a good goddamn anyway.

104
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,368
Thanks for the drink, sport.

105
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,837
Jesus, Clyde, that girl's
playing to everybody. Come on.

106
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,755
But I didn't see it like that.

107
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,925
I thought Bonnie Parker
had always been looking for me...

108
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:35,719
...like I 'd always
been looking for her.

109
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,603
Jesus.

110
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,274
Look, I'm pretty sure
they're wearing a watch on us.

111
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,776
- Hey.
- Go on.

112
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,946
- And .... Miss, that's right.
- Jesus.

113
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:56,407
It's the damn gun.

114
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,909
Blanche not only got
the tight hind quarters...

115
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,246
...she got a cousin out in Pantego
makes white lightning.

116
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:06,500
Since I did most of the work, I figure
I get first cheese on choosing Blanche.

117
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,169
- What?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:11,130
Look, I could be flexible.

119
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,718
Jesus. Enough killing them damn cans.
I got prime out at the ready.

120
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:18,095
Oh, man, she's all yours, all right?

121
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,389
Them hind quarters is for you.

122
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,018
I ain't got no interest in that poontang.

123
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,473
Gonna be gone a couple weeks.

124
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,768
I got some business in Amarillo.

125
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,271
What about my business?

126
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,690
What, you mean show business?

127
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,404
You know how many girls out there
are dreaming that same dream?

128
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,200
- No, Roy. How many?
- Too many.

129
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:29,041
You saying we aren't going to New York
in the spring like we talked?

130
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,835
Just saying we're going to Amarillo first.

131
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,296
And Los Angeles in the fall.

132
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,634
Yeah. And Los Angeles in the fall.

133
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:46,308
You're full of shit, aren't you, Roy?

134
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,145
Jesus.

135
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,399
You expect me to just waste my life...

136
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,778
...wearing out my feet and hands down
at Marco's greasy spoon, don't you?

137
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,538
This... This ain't living, brother.

138
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:10,165
This is dirt getting
so far up my butt crack...

139
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,960
...it's starting to leak into my damn head.

140
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,170
You're lazy, you know it?

141
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,381
Lazy people never get nowhere.

142
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:20,134
Hey, know that butt crack
I was talking about?

143
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,553
Why don't you give it a big kiss?

144
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,890
They say everyone's a product
of their time and place.

145
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,476
Well, Bonnie and my time
was the dirty '30s...

146
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:33,105
...and our place in it
was pretty close to rock bottom.

147
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,860
Never told me
what you thought about my plan.

148
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:41,989
Ain't a plan. That's a blueprint to get
your ass thrown in the hoosegow.

149
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,533
You go in on a Saturday
when they're closed...

150
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,703
...they ain't gonna have enough money
to last the weekend.

151
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,872
You'd have to steal wheels
to get away.

152
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,750
There isn't any woods to hide in
for a half mile.

153
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,919
- So you have thought about it?
- No, I haven't.

154
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,797
Well, you got a better idea?

155
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,467
Maybe.

156
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,428
All right!

157
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,768
- Yeah!
- We got it!

158
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,313
I knew it'd work! I knew it!

159
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,197
We got laws.

160
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,574
Go! Step on it!

161
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,331
Come on!

162
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,543
Never catch Clyde the Drive!

163
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,600
Clyde.

164
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,488
Ain't nobody
gonna catch us Barrow boys.

165
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,615
Evening, folks!

166
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,590
Hell, Clyde, it's a dead end.

167
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,928
- Let's go. Hey, leave the damn safe.
- The hell with that.

168
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,930
- Leave the damn safe.
- No.

169
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,979
Hold it! Stop, police!

170
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,235
Stop, police! Freeze!

171
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,287
Give it up, boy!

172
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,543
This way!

173
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,482
Down there, by the pond!

174
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,320
Hold it!

175
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,323
Slow down, boy! You can't get away!

176
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,118
We got him!

177
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,226
Just got back
from the pen in Huntsville.

178
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,937
- Marvin all right?
- How come you haven't been?

179
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,439
Not a big fan of penitentiaries.

180
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:06,401
Well, he asked about you.
He asked if you were being safe.

181
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:10,489
Told me to tell you it wasn't safe
to go swimming out in Colter's Pond.

182
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:14,284
He said "safe," like, four times,
like it was code or something.

183
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,121
Well, Buck isn't as sharp as you, Nell.

184
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,541
I doubt he has the smarts
to talk in code.

185
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,087
- Hey, why aren't you in school?
- Because school's for saps.

186
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,422
What'd you just say, little sister?

187
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,969
- Relax. Mrs. Rose got sick, sent us home.
- All right.

188
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,596
- And you didn't finish school.
- Well, I should.

189
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,848
I should've.

190
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,934
You want to be like brother Buck?

191
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,853
Or you want to be like idiot Clyde?

192
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,606
Hey, I got some gossip
you might find interesting.

193
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,943
- Really?
- Don't we have an arrangement?

194
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,780
All right, this better be good.

195
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:56,451
- You extortion Annie over here.
- So rumor has it Roy took off again.

196
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,495
It's the third time he done it.

197
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,790
And Ella Jean told Iris Cantor's sister,
who told me...

198
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:05,085
...what Bonnie wrote in her diary
on New Year's Eve.

199
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:09,089
She said if Roy didn't come back
by the stroke of midnight...

200
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,049
...her and Roy was all done.

201
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,678
She moved in with her mama.

202
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,607
Unless you've got the money
to purchase...

203
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:11,234
...you mind keeping your grubbies
off my Silks?

204
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,571
You seem more of a cotton
kind of fella anyway.

205
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,407
Well, today I'm feeling kind of silky.

206
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:22,454
Come on. Don't you think silk's
a little pricey for a fella like you?

207
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,250
- You getting fresh with me?
- No, ma'am.

208
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,920
I sure as hell
wouldn't get fresh with you.

209
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,047
You know what?

210
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,591
Why don't you just go back
to whatever hole...

211
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,260
...you got your fingers so dirty
digging out of?

212
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,055
All right,
but before I climb into said hole...

213
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,183
...could I buy
all five of them here shirts?

214
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,352
Got the money right here.

215
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,604
You get out of here. You go on.

216
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,107
You get before I call the laws.

217
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,194
Go on.

218
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,949
People are always trying to blame others
for what goes wrong in their lives...

219
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,952
...but the real culprit's
usually a lot closer to home.

220
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:19,821
Bonnie?

221
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,741
What happened, Bonnie?

222
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:23,950
What's wrong?

223
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:28,079
Whatever it is, honey, whatever it is,
it'll be okay.

224
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,335
They said no, didn't they?

225
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,754
It'll be okay, sweetheart.

226
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,131
Your time will Come.

227
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,927
You're a precious thing.

228
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,472
The most precious thing.

229
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,311
You've got to learn
to keep yourself calm.

230
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,438
Scared the daylights
out of your mama.

231
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,982
Worst fit you ever had.

232
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,401
I'm almost 20.

233
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,778
My husband left me...

234
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:04,866
...and I'm stuck here in Cement City
with prospects none, Mama.

235
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:12,707
You will do no such thing. You will
keep this with your special things.

236
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,043
Most girls don't even have
the gumption...

237
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,380
...to get a rejection letter
from a movie studio.

238
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,383
So there.

239
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,180
Up, up!

240
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,027
The memories you've given me.

241
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,326
You know there were over 100 kids
trying to win this?

242
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:53,665
And why Texas Monthly
didn't publish your poems ....

243
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,083
The squirrel makes his case

244
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:01,047
Yappy, quite sure that his song is elixir
Melancholy's cure

245
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,008
Mama, they're not that good.

246
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:11,099
And when all those kids froze up
and forgot their parts...

247
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,059
...you got that audience clapping.

248
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,313
Cartwheels, handsprings.

249
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,774
Who's got the moxie
to just take over like that?

250
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:24,237
- You gave them what they wanted, Bon.
- But I never even got to my soliloquy.

251
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:29,075
Maybe I'll never get to my soliloquy.

252
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:35,415
I will never forget this day.

253
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:41,087
And now Miss Bonnie Parker
would like to sing a song for her father.

254
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,512
This was my daddy's favorite song.

255
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,051
Evening, Mrs. Parker.

256
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:32,138
I'd like to see your daughter,
as I've got intentions to take her out.

257
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,557
- Is she expecting you?
- No, ma'am.

258
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,435
We've never really met.

259
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,939
Bonnie?

260
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,775
Believe you've got a gentleman caller.

261
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,902
- Mr...?
- Barrow.

262
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,697
Clyde "Champion" Barrow.

263
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,455
You were at my wedding.

264
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,374
I was.

265
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,752
Friend of the groom's'?

266
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,964
You talked to Roy recently, have you?

267
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:11,219
Guess you're not one much
to let the kettle cool.

268
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,971
Not me.

269
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,599
Is this car yours?

270
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,227
Tonight it sure is.

271
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,405
Keep them both on the wheel, huh?

272
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,658
All right.

273
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,287
What can I get you?

274
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:22,999
- Two fingers of whiskey'd be nice for me.
- Whiskey sounds good.

275
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,377
- How about you put a little soda in hers?
- Yes, sir.

276
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:31,216
You gonna be all right for a minute,
Bonnie Parker?

277
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,842
Sure. Where you going?

278
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:37,097
Well, music's calling,
I'm just answering the bell.

279
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:16,946
I don't know if I can remember a night
that can hold e candle to this.

280
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,741
It's almost like it's meant to be.

281
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,951
Like you and me.

282
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,624
You can't talk about meant to be
when we haven't even kissed yet.

283
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:33,129
I didn't say I wanted to kiss you.

284
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:35,298
Yeah, you did.

285
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:47,018
So you're convinced after one date
and one middling kiss...

286
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:50,104
...that I'm the girl's gonna make
your dreams come true?

287
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,814
Nope.

288
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,652
I'm convinced I'm the man's
gonna make yours come true.

289
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,840
I get clear, I'll come calling.

290
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:21,803
Hold it! Stop!

291
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:26,307
- All right, don't nobody move!
- Get out of the way!

292
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,560
- Move!
- Get on the back door!

293
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,563
We're shutting the joint down!
Don't nobody move!

294
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,733
You're all under arrest!
This is an illegal establishment!

295
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,986
Don't nobody move,
and nobody gets hurt!

296
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,196
Where do you think you're going?

297
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,659
I know you.

298
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,953
He's the other joker
who stole that safe.

299
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,169
You want a slice of Cobbler with that joe,
Ted?

300
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,714
Just coffee today, Bonnie.

301
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,384
Something on your mind?

302
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,679
Yeah, actually.

303
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:08,725
Heard you got dragged
out of a Speakeasy last night.

304
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,561
Who you seeing
taking you to a place like that?

305
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,688
What do you think
your mama would say?

306
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:17,191
What are you gonna do, tell her?

307
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,735
No.

308
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,864
Herald might.

309
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,648
Things slow down at Marco's'?

310
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,859
Nothing new about that.

311
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,029
It's nice of you
to try to spare me the indignity...

312
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:06,074
...but Mrs. Haskell called
as soon as she saw it.

313
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:09,786
She tried to sound so distraught.
She got on the party line...

314
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,955
...and clucked about my
wayward daughter to all the hens.

315
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:16,459
Well, you're the one that let him in.

316
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,588
Get that out of here.

317
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,431
Choices made.

318
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,060
Roads gone down
or turned away from.

319
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:35,853
From my experience...

320
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,566
...trying to figure out why people
do the things they do defies ell logic.

321
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,202
Clyde Barrow.

322
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,669
And Bonnie Parker.

323
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,594
Clyde and Bonnie.

324
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,226
Bonnie and Clyde.

325
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,066
Bonnie and Clyde.

326
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,410
Maybe if somebody left open
a door they shut...

327
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:36,956
...maybe if we were living in times of
milk and honey instead of grit and piss...

328
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:40,835
...Bonnie might have just faded off
into obscurity.

329
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,506
Maybe if they weren't celebrating
anyone who dared rise up.

330
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:54,223
Hell, maybe if I wouldn't have promised
to make all her dreams come true...

331
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,934
...Bonnie would've forgotten
all about me.

332
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,812
Lord knows she should've.

333
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,075
Can I help you with something?

334
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:57,411
I hope so.
I wanted to see one of your prisoners.

335
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:58,788
Mr. Clyde Barrow.

336
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,249
I'm Clyde's wife.

337
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,833
That's a nice ring.

338
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,128
And I'd like to help,
but we're just a holding tank here.

339
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:09,674
There's no visitation allowed,
even spousal.

340
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:16,722
- Oh, ma'am, you all right?
- I don't know.

341
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,809
We hadn't even gone
on our honeymoon yet.

342
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:23,437
And he's gonna be sent away
to hard time, I know it.

343
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:27,942
And I'm gonna be left alone
for God knows how long.

344
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,241
Your wife's here, Barrow.

345
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,827
Hello, honey.

346
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:39,870
Let's make it short and sweet.

347
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,457
Jesus, Bonnie,
I can't believe you're here.

348
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,626
What are you doing?

349
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:47,878
Where'd you get that?

350
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,172
- It isn't important.
- Bullshit, it's not.

351
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:54,510
- Don't want you getting mixed up in this.
- For Pete's sake, Clyde, take the gun.

352
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,220
Don't take it.

353
00:34:56,387 --> 00:35:00,141
- We'll be in federal lockup by Friday.
- Well, nobody asked you, cracker.

354
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,268
You got one minute.

355
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:06,897
Clyde Barrow,
if anything's meant to be between us...

356
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,692
...I think it better start being now.

357
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,745
- it's empty.
- Well, I didn't know that.

358
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,706
And neither will they.

359
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:28,502
I borrowed my uncle's car. I'll be waiting
by Miller's Creek until midnight.

360
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,717
Lord have mercy.

361
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,563
Stop!

362
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,026
Ain't nowhere for you to go!

363
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,153
Hold it right there!

364
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:59,617
- We got you, Turner!
- Barrow!

365
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:02,828
That's it.

366
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,083
Move over.

367
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:09,126
That's the way.

368
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,712
Barrow! Don't you do it!

369
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,642
Ain't even in third yet.

370
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,310
I got your suit in the back.

371
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:28,896
Even got us a place to go.

372
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,480
What?

373
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:16,485
I used to keep a horseshoe under my bed
for good luck.

374
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,657
You aren't the only one feeling lucky,
Mr. Barrow.

375
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,160
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I bent the rim on my Ford.

376
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:08,329
You do any wheelwrighting?

377
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:11,248
Yeah, I'll help you out
as soon as I'm done with him.

378
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:21,133
- That's your horse out front?
- I think I'm more his than he's mine.

379
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,719
Not a bad idea
if you're the man riding him.

380
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:27,431
Yeah, I sit around eating
more than I used to.

381
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:30,059
It's one of the downsides of retirement.

382
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:33,187
- What'd you used to do?
- I was a Texas Ranger.

383
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,357
You don't say.

384
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:43,072
I bet wrongdoers hated having you
with that big mount of yours on their ass.

385
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,658
That'll be two bits, Mr. Hamer.

386
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:47,409
Hamer?

387
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:54,291
- Are you Frank Hamer?
- I used to be.

388
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,172
Frank Hamer.

389
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:05,761
- You didn't tell me what you do, son.
- Oh, I'm looking for work.

390
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:09,640
Pretty good with cars, if you know
anybody looking for a grease monkey.

391
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:11,976
I'll keep an eye out.
You seem personable.

392
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:15,771
You don't find a job right away,
don't stop looking.

393
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:19,483
A lot of people falling in the wrong line
of endeavor these days.

394
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,278
Not that I'm suggesting you would.

395
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:24,613
Appreciate the fatherly.

396
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:26,615
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hamer.

397
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:32,496
Rumor had it
Hamer could see #red bullets...

398
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:34,874
...hear sounds before they were made.

399
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,378
The press had even given a name
to his .45 Colt: Old Lucky.

400
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:43,757
Which had nothing to do with the chances
of the outlaws who met up with Hamer.

401
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,677
Right then, I made a pact with myself

402
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:52,808
One job to give me and Bonnie a stake.
That was gonna be it.

403
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:58,230
- Clyde?
- Yeah?

404
00:39:58,397 --> 00:39:59,815
Some guy's here to see you.

405
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:02,067
Says his name's Methvin.

406
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,653
- Good.
- What's he here for?

407
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,239
The oil refinery job.

408
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,783
But I thought you said
that was a two-man job.

409
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,287
Yeah, it is, and he's the other man.

410
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,165
What are you talking about?

411
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,627
We planned that together.
I'm the one that did the casing.

412
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,045
More than you should've.

413
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:24,965
Methvin's got experience. It's gonna
be better for everybody, all right?

414
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,635
Now, could you please
get me my pants?

415
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,516
Get me my damn pants.

416
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:47,446
- Excuse me, what's your name again?
- Methvin, Henry Methvin.

417
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:50,574
Well, Clyde's changed his mind,
Henry.

418
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,202
- He won't be needing you.
- Now, hang on, Bonnie.

419
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,371
Hey, Henry. Hey, good to see you.

420
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:58,457
- Just a little misunderstanding.
- Damn it, Clyde Barrow.

421
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,211
We had an agreement
to do this together, me and you.

422
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:07,049
Yeah, well, you gonna carry a gun with
these heels and that little purse of yours?

423
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:10,594
- Those are nice shoes.
- What if you need to run in these shoes...

424
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:13,555
...because somebody's trying
to put buckshot up our asses?

425
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:18,018
Well, I'll kick them the hell off.
Now, tell Mythman here...

426
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,854
...that we don't need him.

427
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,818
Fine. Fine.

428
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,653
All right. All right, already.

429
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,488
All right, heretofore...

430
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:35,285
...the oil refinery is a three-man job.

431
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,955
Are you happy now?

432
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,916
- Well, show him a smile.
- Yeah.

433
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,543
All right.

434
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:02,021
Clyde, the turn to the oil refinery's
back there.

435
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:05,065
But the guns are stashed out here.

436
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,817
- Out here?
- Yeah.

437
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,402
Where?

438
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:10,487
Just yonder.

439
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,916
That old wagon right there,
just under the hay.

440
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,420
You want me to get them?

441
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:29,256
You want to be a part
of this three-man job or not?

442
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:39,767
In here?

443
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,269
Pick you up in a couple hours
when it's over!

444
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,854
Clyde!

445
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,314
Clyde, you...!

446
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:47,232
Goddamn it, Clyde!

447
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,113
I think she could've managed
the lookout.

448
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:05,394
Need a lift, miss?

449
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:09,982
What'd they do?

450
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:11,942
Broke into an oil refinery.

451
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:15,070
- Tried to take the payroll.
- Would've gotten it too...

452
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,532
- ...if we'd had a lookout.
- No lookout.

453
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,659
Imagine that.

454
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:25,956
Huntsville's bad.

455
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:30,002
But unless you get Eastham Farm,
you'll be all right, which you shouldn't.

456
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,713
Small-time stuff you done
and being only...

457
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,883
- How old are you?
- Twenty-one.

458
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:39,303
Unless somebody screws up
or you bone the warden's daughter...

459
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,430
...neither of you will get the Farm.

460
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,224
I'm Bud Russell.

461
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,603
And I'm tougher than all
you guys put together.

462
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,689
Driven this chariot
over one-and-a-half million miles...

463
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:53,066
...and only lost one con in all that time.

464
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:55,485
And that eats at me
every single minute.

465
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:58,238
Do not think
you're gonna be number two.

466
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:01,116
- Hell you looking at?
- I ain't looking at nothing.

467
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:05,078
- You got attitude, boy?
- I ain't got no attitude.

468
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:08,582
I'm thrilled to be here,
what with you the warm welcoming sort.

469
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:15,923
You're shit. Shit going nowhere.

470
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:18,967
Get your worthless ass
in that one-way wagon.

471
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:29,937
Pretty sure that just bought you
the Farm.

472
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:55,295
You tell me you're going to church,
and you wind up here.

473
00:45:56,922 --> 00:46:00,676
You snuck him in that gun, didn't you?
Oh, don't look at me like that.

474
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:04,221
You had any sense, you'd know
the best thing could've happened...

475
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:06,223
...was he got hauled right back in.

476
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:10,477
There is no reason a girl like you
cannot find a good man.

477
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:21,863
Don't you go into
one of your fits over him.

478
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,241
Do not let that happen.

479
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:27,619
Settle your breathing,
like I taught you, you hear me?

480
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,043
He's better for me than Roy, Mama.

481
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,172
That, my daughter, isn't saying,
excuse my French, jack-the-F-shit.

482
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,884
You deserve yourself
way better than Clyde Barrow.

483
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:48,557
Ted Hinton told me
they gave him 14 years.

484
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:50,475
You need to stop this.

485
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:53,145
You need to look me in the eye...

486
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:57,733
...and tell me you won't waste another
moment thinking about that boy.

487
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,328
Pick up the pace!

488
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:20,380
Man, Honolulu ain't got nothing
on this place.

489
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:24,551
Get digging, Barrow!

490
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:30,182
Get on deep in that ditch, boy!

491
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,532
Think he's getting
sweet on you, Clyde?

492
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:51,787
I don't know what's worse, the high rider's
whip or the big guy's affections.

493
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,247
I'll take the high rider.

494
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:07,010
Hey, Sunday after church,
my parents are having a picnic.

495
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:09,471
My dad makes killer ribs.

496
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:11,640
Not a big rib girl, Ted.

497
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:15,519
Well, now, you don't have to eat.
There'd be... There'd be plenty to do.

498
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:19,856
You know, I do some barbershop
with the boys at Dallas P.D.

499
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,859
I know you're into musicals,
maybe you'd like it.

500
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:24,861
Well ....

501
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:27,155
I'll think about it, huh?

502
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:48,552
- Thanks, Ted.
- Hey.

503
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,971
Before you go, I was...

504
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:53,306
I was thinking maybe we should kiss.

505
00:48:55,142 --> 00:48:56,768
Ted...

506
00:48:57,436 --> 00:49:02,357
...I'm not gonna listen to you sing,
or catch any more rides home with you.

507
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:06,653
L... I like you, but nothing...

508
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,447
...more.

509
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,118
Well, I hope we can always be friends.

510
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,171
Got enough darn friends.

511
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,103
The hell you doing?

512
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:44,065
- It was itching to be smelled.
- Yeah? Smell these.

513
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:51,615
I hope you don't mind
that I write every day.

514
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:54,868
But it's the only way for me
to cope with the loneliness...

515
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:57,787
your incarceration
has visited upon me.

516
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:01,374
I wonder what your days are like.

517
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:07,422
Hope things there at Eastham
aren't as bad as folks say.

518
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:23,104
And I hope the knowledge that
you've got a woman waiting for you...

519
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:27,400
...makes it somehow more tolerable.

520
00:50:57,931 --> 00:51:00,850
But I hope these poetic stanzas
I've authored for you...

521
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:03,103
...will bring some solace
to your time there.

522
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:11,528
And she thought of herself
As only a stone

523
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:15,198
Drifting the cosmos so terribly alone

524
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:20,036
Days turned to years and eons
And still

525
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:24,374
She found not her orbit
No gravity until

526
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:30,380
The music of the spheres
Revealed it clear

527
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:34,801
Spinning alone
And suddenly so near

528
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:41,099
The moon found her earth
They danced all that night

529
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,437
And forever they would

530
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,773
Because that's what was right

531
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:19,387
Stop standing around! Get to work!

532
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:45,246
So the incident with Mr. Hamilton
was just an unfortunate accident?

533
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:48,333
No, sir, it was a very painful one.

534
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,544
Yeah. That's some nice work there.

535
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:55,006
You ever think about mounting
any wayward inmates?

536
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:57,592
On the wall, I mean.

537
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:03,723
You know, I voted no
on the leniency owing to your injury.

538
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:06,267
But my vote's but one of seven.

539
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:10,146
I'm sorry you're in the minority there,
but I just want to thank you...

540
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:14,067
...for all the lessons I learned
in this lovely facility.

541
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:17,487
Yeah, you won't be seeing
Clyde Barrow again.

542
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:20,281
Oddly, I believe I will.

543
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,368
I'm sure you know that...

544
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:28,331
...you were near to pardon even if you
had kept all ten of your little piggies.

545
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:30,792
Your mother
and a gal named Bonnie Parker...

546
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:34,587
...have been writing letters
to the governor on your behalf.

547
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:38,216
Apparently, he was about
to have me send you home.

548
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,016
Oh, Barrow?

549
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,729
Hope you don't mind.

550
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,605
I kept one.

551
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:02,991
Why didn't somebody tell me
the governor was about to pardon me?

552
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:06,453
Well, the notion one of us had
was to keep it a surprise.

553
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:09,914
Well, l... I thought it'd be nice.

554
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:12,959
I love surprises.

555
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:16,963
Well, I do too.

556
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:19,215
Maybe you ought to let Bonnie drive.

557
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:22,510
She's the one who borrowed the oar
from some friend of hers.

558
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:26,890
It ain't like my damn neck's
broken, Mama. I can drive.

559
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:51,206
You're gonna come in, aren't you?
Your daddy'd want to see you.

560
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:53,208
No, I'll probably come by Sunday.

561
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:56,085
Get some of that
wonderful ham of yours.

562
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:58,421
What?

563
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:01,007
Just don't know.

564
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:04,677
Just don't know that she's
gonna be good for you, Clyde.

565
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:08,515
No, she's fine.

566
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:14,854
Now, maybe she don't measure up
to you, but trust me...

567
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:18,316
...Bonnie's more than good enough
for me, all right?

568
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:50,139
Bonnie?

569
00:55:51,808 --> 00:55:54,477
No need to rush things.

570
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:15,999
Probably sounds crazy.

571
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:20,003
Guy like me, convict and all...

572
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:23,673
...but I ain't afraid
of making a commitment.

573
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:27,719
I ain't afraid of making a baby.

574
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:32,390
I'm giving up criming.
I'm going straight-arrow.

575
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:34,559
I want to do it for you.

576
00:56:35,852 --> 00:56:38,771
I don't know how to say this,
but I sort of ....

577
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:41,232
I seen our future.

578
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:45,153
I seen us in a big white house...

579
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,864
...with big columns...

580
00:56:48,031 --> 00:56:51,117
...on the prettiest lake you ever saw.

581
00:56:51,284 --> 00:56:54,162
I'm gonna build you that house, Bon.

582
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:58,374
And we gonna fill it with as many
little ones as you want.

583
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,548
That is, if that's what you want.

584
00:57:05,757 --> 00:57:08,134
Of course it's what I want.

585
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:13,640
I just didn't expect we'd start
the making-babies part just yet.

586
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:19,187
Want some time
with just the two of us first.

587
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:23,066
If that's all right with you.

588
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:05,400
How much you think
they'd sell that for?

589
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,276
That house?

590
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:09,821
Probably like 5000.

591
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:12,824
Seems like it might as well be a million.

592
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:17,203
How do you reckon
we get that kind of money?

593
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:21,666
- I don't know. I can find work.
- Well, raising kids isn't Cheap either.

594
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,293
There's doctor bills and clothes.

595
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:28,589
You spend a lot of money
on clothes for girls.

596
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:31,801
And day-laboring ain't gonna be
enough for all that.

597
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:35,722
I know cars. If I could get someone
to front me some money...

598
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:39,892
- ...I could open my own service station.
- I can just see all the bankers...

599
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:43,771
...falling all over to see who can give
the convict the biggest bundle.

600
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:46,399
Hey. Ex-con.

601
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:48,651
Why don't you give it a rest, huh?

602
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:53,406
Well, you're the one
with all the big dreams.

603
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,870
Calling Car 28, Car 2-8.
There 's a holdup at 4th and Main.

604
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:02,248
Come on, baby, we got something
hot on the platter here.

605
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:11,382
- You seen this before?
- What?

606
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:15,011
Well, right before the exciting parts,
you keep squeezing my hand.

607
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:16,387
Well, of course I do.

608
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,390
I can tell when they're coming,
what with the music...

609
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:21,684
...the way they put it together and all.

610
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:33,029
Bonnie never told me
exactly how to keep her happy.

611
00:59:33,196 --> 00:59:36,949
She never told me one last job
wouldn't be enough.

612
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:41,370
She just kind of let me
figure it out for myself.

613
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,112
Next, please.

614
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,698
I'd like to make a withdrawal.
Put it down!

615
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:19,784
- Put it down!
- Drop it!

616
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:23,412
Get his gun! Everybody,
get on the ground right now!

617
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,832
Hey, there, you stupid?
Put your head down!

618
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,752
- All right, take it easy. Take it easy.
- Ain't gonna hurt nobody!

619
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:33,214
All right. Give me all your cash.

620
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:35,508
Come on.

621
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:43,266
Well, that's it?

622
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,852
Yeah, that's it.

623
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,523
Let's go to the vault. Come around!

624
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,191
- Move. Move!
- You too. Move!

625
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:54,235
- Move! Move!
- Easy, now.

626
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:57,113
- There's no money in the vault.
- He's clearly lying.

627
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,323
He's a banker, that's what they do.

628
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,701
- Why isn't it locked?
- Well, like I said...

629
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:04,871
...there's a depression on.
The bank's closing.

630
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,999
- Everybody, in the box!
- I'm claustrophobic.

631
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:11,377
- Well, I'm Baptist. Get in.
- Look, we won't tell.

632
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:13,880
We won't call the cops or nothing.

633
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:17,925
- Don't mess with Bonnie and Clyde.
- Do as they say.

634
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,386
- Everybody, in the vault!
- Get in the vault!

635
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:22,180
Get in! Get in the vault.

636
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:25,266
- Right inside, there you go!
- Just get in, move.

637
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:33,983
What the hell you tell them
our damn names for?

638
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:37,403
Don't go shooting your damn gun.
Half the town probably heard.

639
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:40,656
What you yelling for?
I got them where you told them to go.

640
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:43,659
Because it ain't damn
"Bonnie and Clyde," all right?

641
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:45,953
It's "Clyde and Bonnie."

642
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,115
That's right.

643
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:38,130
You look a lot more womanly
when you let your hair down.

644
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:42,009
I followed you from work,
and the door wasn't locked.

645
01:02:43,511 --> 01:02:46,138
I've been reading your articles
in The Herald.

646
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:48,182
You do a great job...

647
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:53,396
...considering you're under the strictures
of reporting just the facts.

648
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:55,856
Oh, I'm not criticizing. I just ....

649
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:59,986
What with all the foreclosures
and woes of the stock market...

650
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:05,366
...seems like people could stand
a little less black-and-white truth...

651
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:10,329
...and a skosh more being entertained.

652
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:13,040
What are you doing here?

653
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:15,626
I'm just a fan.

654
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:19,797
Oh, I gotta say, I was surprised
when I found out P.J. was a woman.

655
01:03:20,298 --> 01:03:23,676
You always called yourself P.J.?
Or was that your boss's idea...

656
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:27,305
...to stop your readers from finding out
you were a Patricia?

657
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,475
Maybe it's me, but seems like things
are moving forward for our gender.

658
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:35,855
What with that Amelia Earhart
fixing to fly across the Atlantic...

659
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:39,483
...and you in the newsroom
writing about crime...

660
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:43,988
...and me out there committing them.

661
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:48,075
I couldn't help but notice...

662
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,205
...you only put Clyde's name down.

663
01:03:55,708 --> 01:04:00,212
Nice of you to mention me
only as "female companion."

664
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:01,547
Wasn't my idea.

665
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:05,760
My editor said if a girl was involved
in an armed robbery, it had to be...

666
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:08,846
- ...her man making her do it.
- Really?

667
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:11,932
Imagine that.

668
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:18,647
Would you please
get out of my house?

669
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:25,071
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.

670
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:30,743
Oh, goodness, P.J.,
I never introduced myself.

671
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:33,371
I'm Bonnie Parker.

672
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:37,666
A la Bonnie and Clyde.

673
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:59,730
I'm busy. Looks like you got something
going on in that fine-looking head...

674
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:03,901
You wanted my story twice as interesting,
but out out the interesting part.

675
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:06,904
A woman used a shotgun
in a strong-arm robbery...

676
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:11,075
...and I get a quarter of a column on
page 12 and I can't even use her name?

677
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:14,161
- So, what do you want from me?
- Let me follow the story.

678
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:17,623
Write it the way I want
or I'll go find a paper that will.

679
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:19,667
Maybe you'd better start finding...

680
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:23,337
...because a skirt trying to act like
she isn't, that I don't need.

681
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:38,060
You know, when you keep putting guns
in people 's faces...

682
01:05:38,227 --> 01:05:40,896
...the gods tend to frown
on such behavior...

683
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:43,941
...and all sorts of things can go awry.

684
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,903
- Clyde? You ran us out of gas.
- Gauge said it was a quarter full.

685
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:50,156
Well, laws will be on us.

686
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,658
Damn it.

687
01:05:52,825 --> 01:05:55,494
All right, let's go. Come on.

688
01:05:56,162 --> 01:05:59,915
Come on, run. Come on. Let's go.

689
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,187
Go!

690
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:29,987
- Do you know where we're going?
- Not at the moment.

691
01:06:30,196 --> 01:06:35,159
- All this for $46 in the rm.
- $46.32, baby.

692
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,761
Get down. Get down.

693
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:01,810
- Did you get them, Clyde?
- Ain't trying.

694
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:04,605
I ain't killing laws. No future in that.

695
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:08,442
Y'all better give up!
Come out with your hands up!

696
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,570
Do we give up, Clyde?

697
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:15,199
If I do, I'm 20 years in jail.

698
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:22,581
Then you go. You go. Run. Run.

699
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:25,709
- I ain't gonna leave you, Bonnie.
- I ain't got a record.

700
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:28,671
They'll throw me in jail.
I'll talk my way out.

701
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,714
Give it up, Barrow!

702
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:36,637
- You told those bank clerks your name.
- Well, that was clear across the state.

703
01:07:36,804 --> 01:07:39,598
Nobody put my damn name
in the paper anyway.

704
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:07,501
All right, ma'am, on your feet.

705
01:08:08,294 --> 01:08:09,753
Let's go.

706
01:08:17,428 --> 01:08:21,056
Promise to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

707
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:22,641
I do.

708
01:08:23,017 --> 01:08:27,354
Funny, when you're an outlaw,
you tell so many lies...

709
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:30,691
...after a while, you don't know
what's a lie and what isn't.

710
01:08:31,734 --> 01:08:35,029
And Bonnie, she could really
spin e story.

711
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:41,660
I must admit,
I fell under the sway of Clyde Barrow.

712
01:08:42,578 --> 01:08:47,708
Believed like... Like a schoolgirl,
I could right what was wrong in him.

713
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,504
And when the criming started,
I couldn't stop it.

714
01:08:54,256 --> 01:08:59,386
I tried to get away,
but Clyde wouldn't let me.

715
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:05,184
He wouldn't sleep till he put
a out of leather between my lips...

716
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:10,397
...and bound me up in rope
in nothing but my underclothes.

717
01:09:12,316 --> 01:09:17,071
And this limp of mine.
Clyde tied me up so tight...

718
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:20,699
...I lost circulation all the way
from my ankle to my thigh.

719
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:26,830
Bondage, it's horrible.

720
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:30,459
Truly God-awful horrible.

721
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:33,629
Almost more than a woman can bear.

722
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:39,468
And when Clyde wanted his way with me,
there wasn't much I could do.

723
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,932
I only weigh 106 pounds
and Clyde was so strong.

724
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:49,812
And l... Forgive me, Jesus.

725
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:52,731
... I was so weak.

726
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:57,736
What me and Bonnie done,
those we stole from and the laws...

727
01:09:57,986 --> 01:10:03,367
...they'd probably tell things different.
Hell, even Bonnie, sure she would too.

728
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:05,703
Bonnie 'd surely tell it with more flair.

729
01:10:13,836 --> 01:10:16,505
Take some water, ma'am.
Take some water.

730
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:18,882
Thank you.

731
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:33,147
I can't tell you how good it is
to see you out of that godforsaken hole.

732
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:35,858
Jail is no place for a lady.

733
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,902
- Like the new 'do.
- And I was fond of your performance.

734
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:44,616
- Haven't seen your byline in a while, P.J.
- Yeah, well, things are tough all over.

735
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:48,871
- What was she talking about?
- She's a reporter.

736
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:53,250
- Gotta talk about something.
- Gee, you looked good, Bonnie.

737
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:57,504
I picked up that little old chest of yours.
It's right where you said it was.

738
01:10:57,671 --> 01:11:00,674
So, what do you want to do?

739
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:01,967
Go to a show?

740
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:06,013
Maybe buy a new dress?
I got a little money saved.

741
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:11,518
Gr, you're worn out. You just want
to go home and do each ether's nails?

742
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:14,521
- Afraid I'm not going home, Mama.
- What?

743
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:18,442
Some of what I said in that courtroom...

744
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:21,987
...it wasn't true.

745
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:26,074
- Clyde never took me, Mama.
- Of course he did.

746
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:30,454
You've been telling me he did since
the first time I sat with you in your cell.

747
01:11:31,914 --> 01:11:34,249
You're saying he didn't take you?

748
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:39,963
Everything you've been telling me,
everything you said before that judge...

749
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,092
- ...that was all just an act.
- Mama.

750
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:56,063
I'm sorry, Mama.

751
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,154
- Bonnie.
- Yeah?

752
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:10,160
- You'll come see me, won't you?
- You know I will, Mama.

753
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:41,567
So give me the corrected story
first thing in the morning.

754
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:44,236
We'll give you three-quarters
of page two...

755
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:47,573
...800-, 900 words,
nothing more, nothing less.

756
01:12:47,823 --> 01:12:51,493
So, what makes you think
I'm gonna give you your job back?

757
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,037
You don't want
to be stuck at the station...

758
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:58,125
...on the biggest story that's about
to start racing down the tracks.

759
01:12:58,584 --> 01:12:59,626
Who's that?

760
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:02,004
She sold the Kaufman County
Grand Jury...

761
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,340
...the biggest load I ever saw
shoveled down anyone's throat.

762
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:08,135
You're going to rehire me
to write about her.

763
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,012
Her name's Bonnie Parker.

764
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:13,640
She's got more personality than
nine movie stars put together.

765
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:18,437
She's romantically linked with a
rebellious, disenfranchised son of Texas.

766
01:13:18,604 --> 01:13:22,441
Unless I'm wrong, the two of them
are about to embark on a crime spree...

767
01:13:22,608 --> 01:13:26,612
...with lots of violence, glamour
and car chases.

768
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:29,364
And it isn't just the man
shooting the guns.

769
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:32,200
So you're saying there's sex too.

770
01:13:59,394 --> 01:14:00,896
Come on, Barrow.

771
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:14,368
There's the dreadful girl's mother.

772
01:14:17,204 --> 01:14:20,457
- Just awful, shameful.
- It is.

773
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:03,250
- Clyde Chestnut, what the hell?
- Supposed to be in prison, big gorilla.

774
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:06,169
Yeah, warden made the mistake
of making me a trustee.

775
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:09,506
- I made the mistake of busting out.
- Mistake of busting out?

776
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,219
I'm gonna spend the rest of the
weekend with this lovely thing here...

777
01:15:14,386 --> 01:15:16,888
...and then I'm gonna
turn myself back in.

778
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:20,892
- Hearing a lot about you, Clyde Chestnut.
- Clyde Chestnut?

779
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:23,812
- He told me it was Champion.
- Champion?

780
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:26,440
Trying to impress me, I guess.

781
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,443
I tried my best to do right by her.

782
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:32,571
Well, don't beat yourself up.

783
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:35,323
They're gonna go
the way they're gonna go...

784
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,951
...pretty much no matter what we do.

785
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,121
Yeah, I guess.

786
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:45,250
Hey, Blanche, you mind
grabbing us a beer?

787
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:46,877
All right.

788
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,839
We're the luckiest women
in the world, huh?

789
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:53,341
You done good, boy.

790
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:58,180
Anybody ever turn themselves
back into Huntsville, Marvin?

791
01:15:58,472 --> 01:16:00,390
How the hell should I know?

792
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:03,810
I mean, Blanche's father's a preacher.

793
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:07,689
And she said she won't part
her sweet haunches till I marry her.

794
01:16:07,856 --> 01:16:10,776
Her father won't marry us
till I do the rest of my time.

795
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,153
Right. I think I could launch myself...

796
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,697
...clear to the moon.
I'll tell you one thing.

797
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:19,618
Preacher's daughter or not,
she is one fine load of naughty.

798
01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:23,538
Well, not that that's everything.

799
01:16:24,081 --> 01:16:25,665
Right?

800
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:33,548
- What's Mom so pissy about?
- She's always pissy.

801
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:36,426
- She took the money I gave her.
- We need the money.

802
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:39,137
It ain't the criming that's got her goat.

803
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:42,307
Should've hit you boys more.

804
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:44,935
She doesn't like Bonnie, does she?

805
01:16:45,102 --> 01:16:49,523
She doesn't like
that she's married not to you.

806
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:55,821
Yeah, should've hit him more.

807
01:16:57,322 --> 01:17:01,993
You know, Bonnie'd get divorced
if she could...

808
01:17:03,245 --> 01:17:08,083
...but just kind of a legal proceeding,
you know, and legal and us ....

809
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:11,628
Doesn't mean she couldn't take off
Roy Thornton's ring.

810
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:16,675
It's a nice piece of jewelry, Mom.
Bonnie likes jewelry.

811
01:17:16,842 --> 01:17:20,887
And fine clothes and expensive shoes
and getting famous.

812
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:24,474
I'm just wondering how much
she really likes you.

813
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:26,309
Oh, she likes me fine.

814
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:34,025
I was making a record. Remember
what I used to call you, Clyde?

815
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:35,986
Your "little ray of sunshine."

816
01:17:36,528 --> 01:17:39,281
Wrote down where we gathered,
here at Perkins' barn.

817
01:17:39,447 --> 01:17:42,742
What we ate, what we drank,
who was here.

818
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:48,165
Know I'm only gonna be seeing you
here and there from here on out...

819
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:52,419
...and I don't want to forget
any of the here and theres.

820
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,590
I love you, Mom.

821
01:19:00,195 --> 01:19:05,325
The robbery in Hillsboro, right from
the get-go, just felt different.

822
01:19:06,076 --> 01:19:09,704
Jesus, Clyde,
you're making me nervous.

823
01:19:09,955 --> 01:19:12,040
I could've stopped it.

824
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:14,042
I should've.

825
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:16,127
Because after tonight...

826
01:19:17,462 --> 01:19:20,090
...nothing was ever
gonna be the same.

827
01:19:20,674 --> 01:19:23,385
My old buddy Fults
wasn't two weeks out of jail...

828
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:27,347
...before I got him back doing what
landed him there in the first place.

829
01:19:27,514 --> 01:19:28,807
Come on.

830
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:36,606
- Please don't hurt me.
- You do what we say...

831
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:40,568
...just be another good story
to tell your buddies at the Moose Lodge.

832
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:55,500
Hang on a second. Hey.
This doesn't seem right.

833
01:19:56,001 --> 01:20:00,422
- What are you talking about?
- Like this might not be the right job.

834
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:04,884
- Don't even. We're already doing the job.
- We need money to eat tomorrow.

835
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:08,430
- If you hadn't spent so much on clothes...
- I can't go back...

836
01:20:08,596 --> 01:20:11,558
You guys wanna argue
about shopping, be my guest.

837
01:20:11,725 --> 01:20:14,185
But I'm doing the damn job.

838
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:18,606
Come on. Come on.

839
01:20:21,693 --> 01:20:23,153
Faster.

840
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:29,367
Come on, open it.

841
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:47,218
Come on.

842
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:57,479
Hear that?

843
01:21:00,065 --> 01:21:04,277
Just the cash.
Put it in the purse. Come on.

844
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:06,988
A little faster.

845
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:11,701
Come on.

846
01:21:12,077 --> 01:21:15,205
- All right, let's go.
- Come on.

847
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:27,425
- What y'all gonna do with me?
- Nothing.

848
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:31,096
Go upstairs, stay there till the sun
comes up. You're done with us.

849
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:04,254
Despite all the things we done...

850
01:22:04,421 --> 01:22:08,216
...bullets flying north, south,
east and west...

851
01:22:08,425 --> 01:22:10,677
...no one had been killed before.

852
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:14,222
A few here and there
may have collected some lead...

853
01:22:14,431 --> 01:22:16,641
...but no one had been killed.

854
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:35,660
Miss Lane, I'm Captain Grace.

855
01:22:35,827 --> 01:22:38,496
- Anything we can help you sort out?
- Seems clear.

856
01:22:38,663 --> 01:22:42,125
I was hoping you could tell me
the ABC's of it in your own words.

857
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:45,336
Well, plates matched a vehicle
they stole in Topeka.

858
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:49,132
Looks like they got money and some
jewels from the safe here and ran.

859
01:22:49,299 --> 01:22:52,552
Not before obliterating Mr. Bucher,
apparently for the thrill.

860
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:55,889
All fingers seem to be pointing
at who as the triggerman?

861
01:22:56,097 --> 01:22:57,891
Clyde Barrow.

862
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:01,936
I just spoke to the widow.
Told me she could see the whole thing...

863
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:05,815
...from her bedroom window.
I showed her the picture of Clyde.

864
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:08,818
She said he couldn't have
possibly pulled the trigger.

865
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:13,198
All I know is those maggots came to steal
money, now an innocent man's dead.

866
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:17,243
Now, I'd appreciate it if you'd get
your smart ass off my crime site.

867
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,674
Nobody meant for it to happen, Bon.

868
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:35,094
The press could've hung us worse.

869
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:38,348
You shouldn't be drinking.

870
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,901
I'm a horrible person, Clyde.

871
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:52,987
That poor man's dead...

872
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:57,659
...and I'm all bent because the paper
used my stupid sophomore photo.

873
01:23:57,825 --> 01:24:00,578
- You're not a horrible person.
- Yeah.

874
01:24:00,745 --> 01:24:04,207
- Yeah, I am.
- You're just honest.

875
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:09,045
Gonna get out of town before sunup.
Gonna be all right while I jack us a ride?

876
01:24:09,587 --> 01:24:10,838
Yeah.

877
01:24:16,261 --> 01:24:17,887
Cly?

878
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:24,102
- You really think I don't look stupid?
- Not at all.

879
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:27,605
But you definitely look better in person.

880
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:48,793
"Bonnie and Clyde."

881
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:41,971
"Bonnie and Clyde."

882
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:16,756
You know what
I've been thinking, Clyde?

883
01:26:16,923 --> 01:26:19,967
I think we should do bigger jobs.

884
01:26:21,803 --> 01:26:24,263
Maybe we shouldn't do any more jobs.

885
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:27,141
Well, fine...

886
01:26:28,017 --> 01:26:30,561
...but if we're gonna,
they ought to be big ones.

887
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:34,440
Aren't gonna get that lake house of yours
doing five-and-dime stickups.

888
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:38,069
And stuff can go wrong
just as likely doing them.

889
01:26:38,236 --> 01:26:41,656
Don't feel comfortable doing bigger jobs
just the two of us.

890
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:44,951
Maybe we should hook back up
with Fults.

891
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:47,245
What, so he can gun down
some poor SOB...

892
01:26:47,412 --> 01:26:50,123
...who done nothing wrong
whatsoever?

893
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:53,459
Well, what about your brother?
He's done his time, hasn't he?

894
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:56,212
Yeah, and he ain't looking
to do any more.

895
01:26:57,213 --> 01:26:59,632
I ain't getting Buck involved in this.

896
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:02,009
Well, somebody else, then.

897
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:04,679
Gonna pull bigger jobs,
we need bigger guns too.

898
01:27:04,846 --> 01:27:08,057
Well, then somebody else
and bigger guns.

899
01:27:09,559 --> 01:27:13,980
Weren't you just crying about
that poor son of a bitch in the p.j.'s'?

900
01:27:14,147 --> 01:27:17,024
For Pete's sake, Clyde,
I'm not saying we use them.

901
01:27:17,191 --> 01:27:19,610
If we pull big guns on people...

902
01:27:19,777 --> 01:27:23,197
...they're gonna do
exactly what we tell them to.

903
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:27,452
All right, look here.

904
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:31,539
Just so you know, who's in the gang...

905
01:27:31,706 --> 01:27:34,959
...what we do,
what kind of guns we use...

906
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:40,590
...or if we go and join a damn monastery,
it's all up to me.

907
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,509
I make the decisions.

908
01:27:44,093 --> 01:27:45,720
All right?

909
01:27:46,387 --> 01:27:49,682
Fine. Just a thought.

910
01:27:51,225 --> 01:27:53,436
Sorry I had one.

911
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:16,167
Come on, let's go.

912
01:28:54,705 --> 01:28:57,250
- Barrow?
- Miss me?

913
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:01,587
- Where'd you get the suit?
- Just picked it up from a tailor.

914
01:29:02,213 --> 01:29:03,256
Damn crazy.

915
01:29:14,559 --> 01:29:17,019
... three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

916
01:29:22,525 --> 01:29:25,236
Herman?
We got one too many convicts.

917
01:29:25,403 --> 01:29:28,489
Now you're about to have one too few.
Don't move.

918
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:41,127
Gonna shoot me, are you, Barrow?

919
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:50,136
Go! Go!

920
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:52,471
Outrun them.

921
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:03,274
Move around, other side.

922
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:07,695
Through here.

923
01:30:09,947 --> 01:30:12,033
They're heading for the road.

924
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:19,540
Down, get down!

925
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:29,926
- Bonnie, Ray. Ray, Bonnie.
- Like your choice of weapons, Bonnie.

926
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:51,822
It's the warden.

927
01:30:51,989 --> 01:30:54,033
- Watch this.
- Clyde.

928
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:56,994
- What are they doing?
- They're busting out.

929
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:02,458
- Clyde, you really need to?
- Yup.

930
01:31:02,959 --> 01:31:04,001
Barrow.

931
01:31:06,295 --> 01:31:07,421
Oh, God.

932
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:44,125
Ma'am. I'm here to see
Colonel Simmons.

933
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:47,545
- I'll let him know you're both here.
- Thanks.

934
01:31:59,682 --> 01:32:01,684
You're Frank Hamer.

935
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:08,774
I'm Ted Hinton,
deputy of the Dallas P.D.

936
01:32:10,234 --> 01:32:12,236
I know Bonnie.

937
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:16,365
- I know both her and Clyde by sight.
- I know who you are.

938
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:20,119
And I know what you know.

939
01:32:22,997 --> 01:32:26,709
They share a posse, Frank,
but I would put them on the spot...

940
01:32:26,876 --> 01:32:30,588
...make sure it's them,
and shoot everybody in sight.

941
01:32:30,755 --> 01:32:33,090
That's about the run of it.

942
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:35,843
- Any questions?
- Just one.

943
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:39,388
Hope I'm not hearing the idea
is to shoot first...

944
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:43,225
...and ask them to put their hands up
when they're too dead to do it.

945
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,643
Before she met Barrow...

946
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:48,314
...Bonnie Parker was a good girl
from a good family.

947
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:51,984
Yeah, well, bringing them to trial
would be best in any case.

948
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:54,820
If you collar Barrow,
it wouldn't displease me.

949
01:32:54,987 --> 01:32:58,824
- We'd love having him back.
- Not a question of if, just when.

950
01:32:58,991 --> 01:33:01,077
Let's keep the press out of this.

951
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:05,498
If Barrow finds out we're on their trail,
it'll just make our job a lot harder.

952
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:11,253
Anything you can tell me
from Barrow's time here...

953
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:15,591
...that might help in tracking him?
Distinguishing characteristics or the like?

954
01:33:15,758 --> 01:33:19,303
He just might be limping
on his left side.

955
01:33:22,598 --> 01:33:27,019
Barrow paid the guy he busted out
to hack that little piggy off.

956
01:33:37,988 --> 01:33:41,242
Always heard legends seemed smaller
when you met them.

957
01:33:42,576 --> 01:33:45,412
Was wondering if I could buy you dinner
on the Herald.

958
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:48,541
- Would like to do a full-on feature on you.
- The Herald?

959
01:33:50,835 --> 01:33:52,128
You must be P.J. Lane.

960
01:33:53,462 --> 01:33:55,881
I read some of your pieces, Miss Lane.

961
01:33:56,924 --> 01:33:59,301
- You ought to be writing fiction.
- How's that?

962
01:33:59,468 --> 01:34:02,471
It's inventive now you made
law enforcement the bad guy...

963
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:05,141
...for insinuating Barrow
had something to do...

964
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:07,726
...with the murder of that store owner.

965
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:10,312
What would dinner on you get me?

966
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:14,400
Keep you from having to read the same
baloney written about you before.

967
01:34:14,567 --> 01:34:16,110
About being able to hear shots...

968
01:34:16,277 --> 01:34:18,737
...before they're
fired and gunning down 56 outlaws.

969
01:34:19,613 --> 01:34:21,949
Fifty-seven, Miss Lane.

970
01:34:22,825 --> 01:34:23,868
Have a good one.

971
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:26,579
Come on.
Going to write about you either way.

972
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:30,708
At least tell me what about Bonnie
and Clyde brought you out of retirement.

973
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:32,793
It was the publicity.

974
01:35:05,075 --> 01:35:06,952
- Stop! Police!
- You with the bag!

975
01:35:20,883 --> 01:35:22,426
Get in.

976
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:25,596
Stop!

977
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:34,647
I think you picked the right bank
to spring, Clyde.

978
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:00,589
You smoke, Bonnie Parker?

979
01:36:01,507 --> 01:36:04,677
Nope. I was raised Christian.

980
01:36:13,227 --> 01:36:15,145
You dropped something.

981
01:36:21,193 --> 01:36:25,281
Do yourself a favor, Ray.
Grab a cold bath.

982
01:36:32,121 --> 01:36:33,372
What's for breakfast?

983
01:36:34,081 --> 01:36:37,459
Lady at the bakery said
these are best damn doughnuts ever.

984
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,586
- Great.
- I got you something else too.

985
01:36:39,753 --> 01:36:40,796
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

986
01:36:40,963 --> 01:36:42,423
What?

987
01:36:43,299 --> 01:36:46,677
Kodak Folding Autographic, all right?

988
01:36:46,844 --> 01:36:51,473
It's got focusable lenses,
eight pictures per roll, the whole deal.

989
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:55,894
Figure it's time we do something about
that old sophomore photo of yours, huh?

990
01:36:58,063 --> 01:37:03,027
Yeah. So I wanna shoot you down there,
get you on some rocks.

991
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:04,445
- Clyde.
- Clump of trees.

992
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:07,865
- We aren't shooting the photos today.
- Why not?

993
01:37:08,032 --> 01:37:11,702
Problem with that photo, I didn't know
they were taking them that day.

994
01:37:11,869 --> 01:37:15,205
Girl's gotta get clothes,
tailoring to get the fit.

995
01:37:15,372 --> 01:37:18,208
You're asking for trouble
if you don't get a makeover.

996
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:21,628
- What's a makeover?
- You could stand some new dude.

997
01:37:21,795 --> 01:37:24,381
Not to mention a cut.

998
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:30,220
- Your hair is strictly '20s.
- Hey there. You be nice.

999
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:31,323
Been in there forever. My turn for a dip.

1000
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:35,953
Unless you want to double dip.

1001
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:40,749
You got water in those ears?
I'm talking to you.

1002
01:38:42,042 --> 01:38:43,877
You all right, Clyde?

1003
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:49,425
We need to stop.

1004
01:38:50,175 --> 01:38:51,218
What?

1005
01:38:52,886 --> 01:38:57,099
Did you see this?

1006
01:38:57,266 --> 01:39:01,395
- You see who they hired to hunt us?
- Looks like he's seen better days.

1007
01:39:01,562 --> 01:39:06,483
Yeah. You know,
I met him back at the blacksmith shop.

1008
01:39:07,526 --> 01:39:12,406
I knew it was a sign
that we needed to stop all this.

1009
01:39:13,031 --> 01:39:15,200
Frank Hamer's
the meanest son of a bitch.

1010
01:39:15,367 --> 01:39:19,496
I know it sounds crazy,
but I seen something.

1011
01:39:19,663 --> 01:39:20,831
It wasn't good at all.

1012
01:39:20,998 --> 01:39:23,167
This is about one of those things
you see?

1013
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:25,252
- You don't understand.
- I understand.

1014
01:39:25,419 --> 01:39:29,089
Keep talking like that, they'll put you
in a place worse than prison.

1015
01:39:29,256 --> 01:39:31,467
We need to get out while we can,
Bonnie.

1016
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:35,220
Forget about Ray and robbing banks.

1017
01:39:35,429 --> 01:39:37,931
- All of it.
- And get into what, missionary work?

1018
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:40,559
And if I have a dream...

1019
01:39:40,726 --> 01:39:43,687
...about a purple nine-eyed demon
under our bed...

1020
01:39:43,896 --> 01:39:46,231
...should we give up sleeping together?

1021
01:39:47,024 --> 01:39:50,027
- You think I'm kidding around here, huh?
- No.

1022
01:39:50,194 --> 01:39:52,404
We just risked our necks
to bust Ray out...

1023
01:39:52,571 --> 01:39:56,158
...so that we could get done
what we both agreed we were gonna do.

1024
01:39:56,325 --> 01:39:59,369
- So we could get what we both wanted.
- Yeah?

1025
01:39:59,536 --> 01:40:01,705
Well, maybe I already got
what I wanted.

1026
01:40:01,872 --> 01:40:06,084
And if I say it's time to shut it down,
it's time to shut it down, all right?

1027
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:09,129
- Well, maybe it is.
- Maybe it is.

1028
01:40:27,064 --> 01:40:28,649
Bonnie?

1029
01:40:29,358 --> 01:40:30,817
I'm fine, Clyde.

1030
01:40:30,984 --> 01:40:33,737
Yeah? It's almost midnight.
You gonna come to bed?

1031
01:40:37,032 --> 01:40:39,451
When I'm done bathing.

1032
01:41:14,194 --> 01:41:16,572
Since when you smoking?

1033
01:41:20,784 --> 01:41:22,828
What's going on, Bon?

1034
01:41:25,455 --> 01:41:28,208
You had some premonition
or something.

1035
01:41:29,376 --> 01:41:32,087
I guess I gotta try and understand that.

1036
01:41:33,046 --> 01:41:36,133
But I knew there were gonna be
lawmen after us.

1037
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:42,097
And whatever this Frank Hamer is to you,
he's just another one to me.

1038
01:41:42,723 --> 01:41:46,143
And I gotta tell you,
what I see looking forward...

1039
01:41:46,351 --> 01:41:48,937
...isn't dark and foreboding at all.

1040
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:55,068
I see the two of us waking up one day
with all this behind us...

1041
01:41:55,569 --> 01:41:58,697
...with everything we ever dreamed of.

1042
01:42:01,074 --> 01:42:06,580
Now, maybe the road we're taking
to get to dreamland isn't the greatest.

1043
01:42:07,748 --> 01:42:09,541
But it's the road that called us.

1044
01:42:10,083 --> 01:42:15,839
And if you're demanding
we stop this thing we're doing...

1045
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:18,634
...then I don't know.

1046
01:42:20,552 --> 01:42:24,848
Maybe I'm gonna have to find some other
way to get where I'm supposed to be.

1047
01:42:32,898 --> 01:42:35,233
You ain't going nowhere.

1048
01:43:14,314 --> 01:43:18,235
Hey, not like I break the lens or anything.
Snap a couple of me and Bonnie.

1049
01:43:20,028 --> 01:43:21,655
All right.

1050
01:43:27,953 --> 01:43:30,330
Get more of a close-up.
You're way back there.

1051
01:43:30,497 --> 01:43:32,582
You can hardly see our smiles.

1052
01:43:35,544 --> 01:43:36,712
- Go ahead.
- What?

1053
01:43:37,921 --> 01:43:40,799
- That'll make you look mean.
- Not to mention sexy.

1054
01:43:42,426 --> 01:43:45,220
Hey, Ray,
you got some tobacco on your lip.

1055
01:43:45,387 --> 01:43:47,514
Yeah, let me see that.

1056
01:43:47,681 --> 01:43:49,141
- I get it?
- Right there.

1057
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:52,185
Damn.

1058
01:43:53,729 --> 01:43:56,231
Come here.
Got a little something for you.

1059
01:43:56,398 --> 01:43:58,400
Snap one like this first.

1060
01:43:58,608 --> 01:43:59,901
- All right.
- Oh, wait.

1061
01:44:00,068 --> 01:44:01,862
Make it even better right here.

1062
01:44:08,702 --> 01:44:10,746
Make it look mean. Come on.

1063
01:44:52,245 --> 01:44:56,291
Was excited to near Colonel Simmons
got you on board, Captain Hamer.

1064
01:44:56,458 --> 01:45:01,046
We can use all the help we can get.
We narrowed it down to a five-state area.

1065
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:06,885
Barrow's only committed a couple
of his crimes outside of here, Texas.

1066
01:45:07,052 --> 01:45:11,348
You can tell by the density on the map
where he's done most of his damage.

1067
01:45:11,515 --> 01:45:14,768
We've got all the information
on the crimes in this journal...

1068
01:45:14,935 --> 01:45:16,728
...every detail you could imagine.

1069
01:45:16,895 --> 01:45:19,898
We've recovered some of the clothes.

1070
01:45:20,398 --> 01:45:22,484
You can take a look at them
if you want.

1071
01:45:22,651 --> 01:45:26,279
If we weren't prohibited from crossing
state lines in our pursuit...

1072
01:45:26,446 --> 01:45:28,114
...we'd already have him by now.

1073
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:30,742
Well, I ain't prohibited.

1074
01:45:31,243 --> 01:45:34,830
What I'd like is for you to just stop talking
for a minute, sheriff.

1075
01:45:37,582 --> 01:45:38,875
Give me a pencil.

1076
01:45:41,002 --> 01:45:42,963
One that works.

1077
01:45:51,805 --> 01:45:54,724
What we got here is a creature of habit.

1078
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:57,727
Unless he's changed his spots...

1079
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:03,066
...I'd say where he'd be next is
somewhere in Missou'.

1080
01:46:08,071 --> 01:46:10,407
Thought you might be interested
in this.

1081
01:46:10,574 --> 01:46:14,411
The man Bonnie and Clyde busted out
got picked up trying to thumb a ride.

1082
01:46:14,578 --> 01:46:15,745
Where?

1083
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:17,038
Joplin, Missouri.

1084
01:46:21,793 --> 01:46:24,421
Here. Thank you.

1085
01:46:27,883 --> 01:46:31,219
Thanks, Smoot. We'll be in touch.

1086
01:46:34,598 --> 01:46:37,642
Well, that's why
they bust you out, Ray?

1087
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:40,979
No other jobs
they might need another gun for?

1088
01:46:41,146 --> 01:46:42,606
Yeah.

1089
01:46:42,772 --> 01:46:45,275
Told me they wanted
to track down Frank Hamer...

1090
01:46:45,442 --> 01:46:47,819
...bust a cap on him
when he was sleeping.

1091
01:46:49,237 --> 01:46:52,866
You know, Ray,
I grouse-hunt with Judge Wexler.

1092
01:46:53,033 --> 01:46:56,995
Might be worth your while
to tell us something we don't know.

1093
01:46:57,746 --> 01:46:59,456
I ain't no stool, Hamer.

1094
01:46:59,623 --> 01:47:01,917
You do right by Barrow,
but I'll tell you...

1095
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:04,961
...he done you no favors
by busting you out of Eastham.

1096
01:47:05,128 --> 01:47:09,299
Colonel Simmons ain't fond of runners,
and he's tight with Judge Wexler.

1097
01:47:09,466 --> 01:47:13,261
I don't intervene on your behalf,
you ain't got one day left...

1098
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:16,348
...without Simmons' thumb
stuck up your ass.

1099
01:47:19,726 --> 01:47:22,228
They were talking
about getting back into banks.

1100
01:47:22,395 --> 01:47:24,648
Getting some banks
with some real money.

1101
01:47:24,814 --> 01:47:28,777
Bonnie thought we'd pull some jobs
the size of what Pretty Boy was...

1102
01:47:28,944 --> 01:47:31,529
...we could get out of criming sooner.

1103
01:47:32,072 --> 01:47:35,241
I don't know. Probably try to find
somebody to take my place.

1104
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:40,455
Got any specifics on which banks?
Who the somebody might be?

1105
01:47:41,373 --> 01:47:43,500
No. They kept the planning
to themselves.

1106
01:47:43,667 --> 01:47:47,879
You'd better tell me something I don't
know about Bonnie and Clyde, Ray.

1107
01:47:49,589 --> 01:47:51,174
Come on.

1108
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:54,719
They stay in campgrounds.

1109
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:58,932
Or just camp out,
unless Bonnie can talk Clyde out of it.

1110
01:47:59,099 --> 01:48:01,393
He tends to run careful...

1111
01:48:01,851 --> 01:48:05,730
...drive all night if he's spooked,
always the back roads.

1112
01:48:05,897 --> 01:48:09,275
Keeps a stack of license plates,
always switching them.

1113
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:12,904
And Fords.
Clyde loves big-block Fords.

1114
01:48:13,071 --> 01:48:15,740
Won't jack a car unless it's a V-8.

1115
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:23,206
You done us all a favor, Hamilton.
I'll talk to Wexler for you.

1116
01:48:29,921 --> 01:48:33,675
Get a mug snot of Bonnie and Clyde
to every bank in the five-state area.

1117
01:48:33,842 --> 01:48:37,012
Find out from Simmons
who Barrow consorted with in the pen...

1118
01:48:37,178 --> 01:48:38,763
...who's no longer in the pen.

1119
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:40,306
Doubt he'd break in again.

1120
01:48:40,473 --> 01:48:44,686
See if we can get local law to keep an eye
on the cons, an eye out for Barrow.

1121
01:48:44,853 --> 01:48:46,771
There was a burglary around big D...

1122
01:48:46,938 --> 01:48:49,441
...and it wasn't just Clyde
we went looking for.

1123
01:48:49,607 --> 01:48:52,527
Should think about getting somebody
on his brother Buck.

1124
01:48:52,694 --> 01:48:55,613
Good. See it's done.

1125
01:48:57,032 --> 01:48:58,616
But where am I gonna find you?

1126
01:48:58,783 --> 01:49:02,078
If Barrow drives a V-8,
we gotta upgrade our horse.

1127
01:49:04,748 --> 01:49:06,624
On the road with Bonnie and Clyde.

1128
01:49:11,379 --> 01:49:13,089
Coming.

1129
01:49:20,930 --> 01:49:24,517
- I'll be damned.
- How you doing, big brother?

1130
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:27,520
Good. Good. Real good.

1131
01:49:27,687 --> 01:49:29,439
You look good yourself.

1132
01:49:29,606 --> 01:49:31,232
Bonnie.

1133
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:34,652
Well, you guys come in.
Her and Blanche can bump gums.

1134
01:49:34,819 --> 01:49:36,154
We'll all catch up.

1135
01:49:36,321 --> 01:49:40,033
Well, it may be best if you come out
to the car. Got a little hooch.

1136
01:49:40,742 --> 01:49:42,744
Come on.

1137
01:49:46,372 --> 01:49:48,374
Sit there and drink.

1138
01:49:50,126 --> 01:49:51,169
Bonnie.

1139
01:50:08,812 --> 01:50:09,896
Big money.

1140
01:50:14,109 --> 01:50:15,693
You told them no, didn't you?

1141
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:20,782
After the whiskey,
what'd he promise you, the moon?

1142
01:50:20,949 --> 01:50:22,909
No, he didn't promise me the moon.

1143
01:50:23,076 --> 01:50:25,995
Just enough scratch
to get us a home of our own.

1144
01:50:26,162 --> 01:50:30,917
- We're doing all right without them.
- We're living at your father's house.

1145
01:50:31,084 --> 01:50:33,670
He orders me around.
We ain't doing all right.

1146
01:50:33,837 --> 01:50:36,422
- He's giving you an opportunity.
- And so is Clyde.

1147
01:50:36,589 --> 01:50:39,634
Besides, he's my brother.
He needs me to look out for him.

1148
01:50:39,801 --> 01:50:41,469
You'll both end up in prison.

1149
01:50:41,636 --> 01:50:45,473
Ain't nothing bad gonna happen,
all right, darling? Just start packing.

1150
01:50:46,724 --> 01:50:49,561
What do you think you're doing?
We're married.

1151
01:50:50,061 --> 01:50:52,105
Well, I'll write to you.

1152
01:51:11,624 --> 01:51:13,459
Daddy?

1153
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:20,216
- She ain't Coming?
- Probably for the best.

1154
01:51:20,425 --> 01:51:22,385
All right.

1155
01:51:24,137 --> 01:51:25,763
Let's go.

1156
01:51:30,602 --> 01:51:33,396
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Looks like she changed her mind.

1157
01:51:33,563 --> 01:51:34,814
Am I stopping?

1158
01:51:50,205 --> 01:51:53,958
- You expecting any laws for supper?
- Maybe they heard you was in town.

1159
01:52:01,716 --> 01:52:04,427
Clyde the Drive.

1160
01:52:04,594 --> 01:52:05,678
Go, baby.

1161
01:52:15,313 --> 01:52:17,565
Baptism by fire, baby.

1162
01:52:23,488 --> 01:52:26,616
America 's crime wave
became a full-fledged hurricane...

1163
01:52:26,824 --> 01:52:30,745
...as Charles Arthur "Pretty Boy" Floyd
made headlines in Kansas City...

1164
01:52:31,246 --> 01:52:34,540
...committing a brazen daylight attack
to free Frank Nash...

1165
01:52:34,707 --> 01:52:37,335
...e prisoner being returned
to Leavenworth.

1166
01:52:37,877 --> 01:52:41,297
Pretty Boy and his associates
opened fire with guns blazing...

1167
01:52:41,464 --> 01:52:42,632
Why ain't we up there?

1168
01:52:42,799 --> 01:52:45,802
... outside the train station,
killing five lawmen...

1169
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,223
...in what is becoming known
as the Kansas City Massacre.

1170
01:53:20,378 --> 01:53:21,462
Let's go.

1171
01:53:25,842 --> 01:53:27,677
Hands up.

1172
01:53:30,179 --> 01:53:31,514
Let's go.

1173
01:54:22,023 --> 01:54:24,233
The heck you do that for?

1174
01:54:25,026 --> 01:54:27,236
I thought I saw something.

1175
01:54:49,592 --> 01:54:51,427
Don't think the workday's over.

1176
01:54:52,637 --> 01:54:55,932
Shouldn't you be out
trying to put a bullet in someone's head?

1177
01:54:56,099 --> 01:54:58,768
You know how most outlaws get caught,
Miss Lane?

1178
01:54:58,935 --> 01:55:01,979
- Enlighten me.
- Tips.

1179
01:55:02,146 --> 01:55:03,564
From John Q. Public.

1180
01:55:03,731 --> 01:55:07,068
Problem with Bonnie and Clyde
is we're not getting any.

1181
01:55:07,777 --> 01:55:11,781
Now, I appreciate you're trying
to make your star on their skin.

1182
01:55:11,948 --> 01:55:15,618
But let me tell you the next beat
in this story of yours.

1183
01:55:15,785 --> 01:55:18,579
Pretty soon
somebody else ends up dead...

1184
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:21,249
...and there ain't no way
you can perfume that.

1185
01:55:21,416 --> 01:55:25,711
You'll be wondering if you hadn't painted
Bonnie and Clyde like Garbo and Gable...

1186
01:55:25,878 --> 01:55:28,756
...maybe somebody
would've stepped forward...

1187
01:55:28,923 --> 01:55:32,510
...and this husband or that father
wouldn't be dead at all.

1188
01:55:32,677 --> 01:55:35,138
If I don't write this story,
someone else will.

1189
01:55:35,304 --> 01:55:39,142
I suppose, but I don't see anybody else
throwing out these photo spreads.

1190
01:55:39,308 --> 01:55:42,478
- How'd you run across these pictures?
- I'm good at what I do.

1191
01:55:42,645 --> 01:55:44,313
I don't compromise my sources.

1192
01:55:44,522 --> 01:55:47,859
I'm gonna need to see
the uncropped versions of these.

1193
01:55:48,025 --> 01:55:49,986
I'm not inclined to give them to you.

1194
01:55:50,153 --> 01:55:55,700
I thought you might see it that way.
That's why I got a warrant.

1195
01:56:07,628 --> 01:56:12,133
Believe we got ourselves a shindig
in Stringtown.

1196
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,886
What do you say
we take a break, Clyde?

1197
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:17,388
Probably best not to mix and mingle.

1198
01:56:17,555 --> 01:56:19,765
Come on,
we could all stand to shake a leg.

1199
01:56:19,932 --> 01:56:22,018
Been in this car all damn day.

1200
01:56:22,852 --> 01:56:25,771
Could jump a new car here
as well as anywhere.

1201
01:56:25,938 --> 01:56:27,607
Besides, I gotta tinkle.

1202
01:56:28,524 --> 01:56:31,360
Come on, sugar, let's have some fun.

1203
01:56:37,074 --> 01:56:40,369
- How about something jumpier?
- How about staying quieter?

1204
01:56:40,536 --> 01:56:44,290
- And keeping that corn mash out of sight.
- Hell with these people.

1205
01:56:47,084 --> 01:56:48,961
Gotta get to work.

1206
01:56:49,128 --> 01:56:51,839
- Keep an eye on big brother.
- All right.

1207
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:55,801
- Come on, let's dance.
- No. It's too fast for me. I don't want to.

1208
01:56:55,968 --> 01:56:58,095
- Come on.
- No, I don't want to.

1209
01:56:58,513 --> 01:57:01,891
Hey, give me that.
Go dance with your sister-in-law.

1210
01:57:02,058 --> 01:57:04,477
It's killing her being a wallflower.

1211
01:57:04,644 --> 01:57:06,145
- Bonnie?
- All right.

1212
01:57:06,312 --> 01:57:07,772
All right.

1213
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:12,944
Try and keep up.

1214
01:57:14,487 --> 01:57:16,072
Come on.

1215
01:57:28,709 --> 01:57:31,003
Buck, you got a little Shimmy
in your shake.

1216
01:57:31,212 --> 01:57:34,090
Hell, honey, you ain't seen nothing yet.

1217
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:37,194
- Mind if I out in?
- Yeah. This ain't no kiddie dance.

1218
01:58:37,361 --> 01:58:40,031
Girl needs a man. Beat it, sport.

1219
01:58:57,214 --> 01:59:00,635
- What the hell you looking at, cracker?
- Your ugly mug.

1220
01:59:11,187 --> 01:59:12,229
Let's go.

1221
01:59:13,939 --> 01:59:15,274
Get out of here.

1222
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:17,818
Hey, buddy.

1223
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:39,131
Get in.

1224
01:59:40,091 --> 01:59:41,884
Go, Clyde, go.

1225
01:59:55,564 --> 01:59:56,649
Nine-sixteenths.

1226
02:00:07,618 --> 02:00:10,579
Damn it. I said nine-sixteenths.

1227
02:00:10,746 --> 02:00:12,707
- What?
- Gave me the wrong damn wrench.

1228
02:00:12,873 --> 02:00:15,376
And you stole the wrong ride.

1229
02:00:15,584 --> 02:00:20,381
What happened, Buck, is you got drunk
and stupid, and we killed a law.

1230
02:00:20,548 --> 02:00:22,675
Kill a law, the others ain't gonna stop.

1231
02:00:22,842 --> 02:00:26,554
Bonnie got everyone looking our way,
playing to every farm boy...

1232
02:00:26,721 --> 02:00:30,015
...like she played all those stuffed shirts
at the wedding.

1233
02:00:30,182 --> 02:00:31,809
She was acting like a hussy.

1234
02:00:31,976 --> 02:00:36,188
She's right, but Bonnie's got you too tight
by the balls for you to see it.

1235
02:00:36,355 --> 02:00:38,315
You better shut your mouth, Marvin...

1236
02:00:38,482 --> 02:00:42,111
...or I'm gonna leave you and
brain-dead Blanche in a goddamn ditch.

1237
02:00:42,278 --> 02:00:46,365
Are you threatening me? Are you
threatening me? You want a taste of this?

1238
02:00:48,617 --> 02:00:50,995
- Dumb-ass baboon.
- That's it.

1239
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:54,623
That's it.

1240
02:01:01,088 --> 02:01:02,298
Son of a bitch.

1241
02:01:03,174 --> 02:01:04,967
Get his eyes, Daddy, get his eyes.

1242
02:01:10,139 --> 02:01:13,184
Buck, you wanna blame me, that's fine.

1243
02:01:13,768 --> 02:01:15,895
Clyde, you wanna blame Buck,
that's fine.

1244
02:01:16,103 --> 02:01:18,773
None of it's gonna do us any good.
Lawman's dead.

1245
02:01:18,939 --> 02:01:24,320
None of us are happy about that,
but better him than us.

1246
02:01:24,862 --> 02:01:26,864
Come hell or high water, we're family.

1247
02:01:27,031 --> 02:01:31,619
We start fighting amongst ourselves,
we might as well be pissing in the wind.

1248
02:01:32,787 --> 02:01:34,580
You all right?

1249
02:01:35,831 --> 02:01:39,835
- No, you hit me with a damn wrench.
- Yeah.

1250
02:01:40,002 --> 02:01:42,838
Had to against that right hook of yours.

1251
02:01:44,131 --> 02:01:47,635
Let's put on them out-of-state plates.
Come on.

1252
02:01:47,802 --> 02:01:52,264
A dozen witnesses said they were sure
it was Bonnie they'd seen dancing.

1253
02:01:52,431 --> 02:01:55,935
Description of the fella that crippled
Maxwell matched Buck Barrow.

1254
02:01:56,101 --> 02:02:00,314
Nobody got as good a look at the man
who put a bullet in Eugene here...

1255
02:02:01,148 --> 02:02:02,983
...but pretty sure it was Clyde.

1256
02:02:03,567 --> 02:02:05,361
Eugene has three little ones.

1257
02:02:05,528 --> 02:02:10,699
So the witnesses said that the driver,
the man you think was Barrow...

1258
02:02:10,866 --> 02:02:13,285
...fired just once?

1259
02:02:13,953 --> 02:02:16,163
Seems to be the consensus.

1260
02:02:17,748 --> 02:02:19,917
Well, I'll leave y'all to it.

1261
02:02:20,084 --> 02:02:22,920
You think he was lucky, Ted,
the man who fired once...

1262
02:02:23,087 --> 02:02:26,173
...and shot middle of forehead?

1263
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:28,050
It's hard to say.

1264
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:32,179
Just so you know, I make my own luck.

1265
02:02:32,388 --> 02:02:37,977
I get a shot at the man who done this,
I'm shooting before he does.

1266
02:02:38,143 --> 02:02:39,728
Suggest you do like.

1267
02:02:39,895 --> 02:02:42,481
Nobody appointed you executioner,
Frank.

1268
02:02:43,816 --> 02:02:48,320
This man's doing it right now.

1269
02:02:50,656 --> 02:02:55,119
If Barrow stays to form, he'll head east.
Alert police in Missouri and Louisiana...

1270
02:02:55,286 --> 02:02:58,998
...Bonnie and Clyde might be looking
for refuge in their campgrounds...

1271
02:02:59,164 --> 02:03:02,001
...driving their back roads.
But I wanna widen the net.

1272
02:03:02,167 --> 02:03:07,131
As of tomorrow, I wanna be reading police
reports from Alabama, Georgia, Florida.

1273
02:03:07,298 --> 02:03:10,634
I thought we determined
they'd stay within that circle of yours.

1274
02:03:10,801 --> 02:03:16,265
Yeah, but I think killing cops is gonna
push him out of his usual circles.

1275
02:03:26,317 --> 02:03:28,652
Slice of heaven, huh?

1276
02:03:29,737 --> 02:03:31,530
I'm fair-skinned.

1277
02:03:31,697 --> 02:03:33,991
Too much lying in the sun
ain't good for me.

1278
02:03:34,158 --> 02:03:36,619
Not to mention
what you're doing to my lungs...

1279
02:03:36,785 --> 02:03:38,871
...with those stupid Havanas
Buck stole.

1280
02:03:39,038 --> 02:03:41,999
All right, princess, let's go for a dip.

1281
02:03:43,709 --> 02:03:46,378
Shouldn't we be getting back
to work soon?

1282
02:03:46,545 --> 02:03:49,798
You know, for being on holiday,
you seem kind of on edge.

1283
02:03:49,965 --> 02:03:52,384
Well, you're always on edge.

1284
02:03:52,551 --> 02:03:54,261
No, I'm not.

1285
02:04:02,645 --> 02:04:04,521
- Oh, no!
- Go down.

1286
02:04:04,688 --> 02:04:07,608
- Gonna get him now!
- No.

1287
02:04:07,775 --> 02:04:10,110
Don't splash too much.
Watch my book.

1288
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:12,154
Don't get my poetry wet.

1289
02:04:14,531 --> 02:04:20,454
Frank, you getting the idea
it might be time to head back to Texas?

1290
02:04:20,621 --> 02:04:22,331
Nope.

1291
02:04:22,498 --> 02:04:25,501
I was thinking it's time
to scratch my balls.

1292
02:04:30,506 --> 02:04:32,424
Missouri.

1293
02:04:35,803 --> 02:04:36,929
And those pictures.

1294
02:04:38,514 --> 02:04:41,308
- Where are those damn pictures?
- What pictures?

1295
02:04:41,475 --> 02:04:44,353
Them newspaper photos. Those pictures.

1296
02:04:52,403 --> 02:04:54,613
Yeah.

1297
02:05:06,250 --> 02:05:09,211
Son of a bitch. Get the car, Ted.

1298
02:05:10,838 --> 02:05:12,881
We're going to Florida.

1299
02:05:30,149 --> 02:05:31,859
Help you with something?

1300
02:05:32,026 --> 02:05:36,071
Doubtful, unless you got any guests
registered to Missouri plates 89983.

1301
02:05:39,867 --> 02:05:42,161
Supposed to be my day off.

1302
02:05:42,327 --> 02:05:45,831
Instead I got called in
on this scavenger hunt to nowhere.

1303
02:05:45,998 --> 02:05:49,960
Been to every hostel and inn and ....

1304
02:05:50,919 --> 02:05:52,421
Well, hello, nurse.

1305
02:05:53,922 --> 02:05:57,468
Ain't getting nothing but a whole lot
of butt sweat for my efforts.

1306
02:05:57,634 --> 02:05:59,803
In Bungalow 7.

1307
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:01,597
Oh, shit.

1308
02:06:01,764 --> 02:06:04,850
- Your phone. I need your phone.
- Hey, no need to get riled.

1309
02:06:05,017 --> 02:06:07,519
- I saw them drive off this morning.
- Goddamn it.

1310
02:06:07,686 --> 02:06:11,231
But they're coming back.
They ain't even checked out.

1311
02:06:11,690 --> 02:06:13,692
Who y'all looking for?

1312
02:06:14,151 --> 02:06:16,111
Bonnie and Clyde.

1313
02:06:34,046 --> 02:06:36,757
Dale McClanahan. I'm in charge here.

1314
02:06:36,924 --> 02:06:38,967
Heard a lot about you, Captain Hamer.

1315
02:06:39,134 --> 02:06:41,220
Saw your snipers out there, Dale...

1316
02:06:41,845 --> 02:06:45,015
...and the cruisers,
and there's more men here than we need.

1317
02:06:45,182 --> 02:06:48,060
I'd recommend him and him
go get in the cruisers...

1318
02:06:48,227 --> 02:06:50,646
...and drive themselves
back to the station.

1319
02:06:50,813 --> 02:06:54,149
Your snipers, I want them in here
where Barrow can't see them...

1320
02:06:54,316 --> 02:06:56,819
...and I can tell them
what I need them to do.

1321
02:07:02,908 --> 02:07:05,744
You do speak English, don't you, Dale?

1322
02:07:06,286 --> 02:07:07,788
Let's go.

1323
02:07:23,053 --> 02:07:25,264
When we get back,
I'm gonna fry these up...

1324
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:28,600
...and we can call this fish rodeo
a success.

1325
02:07:28,767 --> 02:07:32,271
I don't eat fish. Too fishy.

1326
02:07:32,437 --> 02:07:34,398
Well, now you tell me.

1327
02:07:38,861 --> 02:07:42,948
You've read the story of Jesse James
Of how he lived and died

1328
02:07:43,866 --> 02:07:46,743
If you're still in need
Of something to read

1329
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:50,164
Here 's the story of Bonnie and Clyde.

1330
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:55,085
They call them cold-blooded killers
They say they are heartless and mean

1331
02:07:55,252 --> 02:07:59,173
But I say this with pride
That I once knew Clyde

1332
02:07:59,381 --> 02:08:02,968
When he was honest
and upright and clean.

1333
02:08:07,139 --> 02:08:10,184
But the laws fooled around
Kept taking him down

1334
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:12,728
And locking him up in a cell

1335
02:08:13,604 --> 02:08:17,065
Till he said to me,
"I'll never be free

1336
02:08:17,983 --> 02:08:20,986
So I'll meet e few of them in hell."

1337
02:08:24,114 --> 02:08:25,490
What are you doing?

1338
02:09:24,049 --> 02:09:25,634
McClanahan.

1339
02:09:29,346 --> 02:09:31,098
We found the car, Captain Hamer.

1340
02:09:31,265 --> 02:09:33,976
Missouri plates 89983,
abandoned in Biloxi.

1341
02:09:34,893 --> 02:09:38,146
We got no lead where Barrow
and his gang might be.

1342
02:09:58,959 --> 02:10:01,044
Why'd you do it, Frank?

1343
02:10:01,211 --> 02:10:04,756
Why'd you come out of retirement
for Bonnie and Clyde?

1344
02:10:05,841 --> 02:10:07,426
For the money.

1345
02:10:07,592 --> 02:10:09,928
Heard you were making more
as a union buster.

1346
02:10:10,095 --> 02:10:11,847
Well, it's not just the salary.

1347
02:10:12,014 --> 02:10:16,977
Remember that pickled toe of Barrow's
that Simmons threw at me?

1348
02:10:17,978 --> 02:10:19,730
I got that in a cupboard at home.

1349
02:10:21,857 --> 02:10:26,403
It's Barrow's saxophone,
Bonnie's typewriter...

1350
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:28,071
...their clothes, their guns.

1351
02:10:28,238 --> 02:10:29,948
It's memorabilia, Ted.

1352
02:10:30,115 --> 02:10:34,119
There's a whole network out there.
You get as much notoriety as those two...

1353
02:10:34,286 --> 02:10:37,998
...their stuff will sell for hundreds,
thousands.

1354
02:10:38,165 --> 02:10:40,625
Longer you hang on to it,
the more it's worth.

1355
02:10:41,626 --> 02:10:45,339
So all them other outlaws
you took care of ....

1356
02:10:45,505 --> 02:10:47,841
Is there much money in memorabilia?

1357
02:10:48,508 --> 02:10:52,763
I could give two shits
about memorabilia, money.

1358
02:10:53,722 --> 02:10:56,516
I came back
because there is no better feeling...

1359
02:10:56,683 --> 02:10:59,394
...than putting a bullet
in the brain of somebody...

1360
02:10:59,561 --> 02:11:03,607
...you and God and any half-decent person
knows needed a bullet put in them.

1361
02:11:13,116 --> 02:11:15,994
This the best this damn thing can do?

1362
02:11:19,539 --> 02:11:21,124
How's that?

1363
02:11:21,291 --> 02:11:24,419
Sometimes something happens,
something terrible avoided...

1364
02:11:24,586 --> 02:11:27,672
...but that don't mean
it was for the better.

1365
02:11:27,839 --> 02:11:30,425
If I wouldn't have had that inkling
about Hamer...

1366
02:11:30,592 --> 02:11:32,594
...it'd have all been over in Florida.

1367
02:11:32,761 --> 02:11:35,055
Bonnie would've gotten
her biggest headline.

1368
02:11:35,222 --> 02:11:37,974
And there 'd have been
e lot less mess.

1369
02:11:46,733 --> 02:11:50,153
Everybody get on the ground
right now!

1370
02:11:52,072 --> 02:11:53,573
Don 't mess with
Bonnie and Clyde.

1371
02:11:55,909 --> 02:11:57,702
Get in the vault.

1372
02:12:02,833 --> 02:12:06,461
Everybody on the damn ground
right now!

1373
02:12:10,382 --> 02:12:13,093
Ain't nobody gonna catch us.

1374
02:12:23,728 --> 02:12:27,524
- That's perfect right there.
- Okay.

1375
02:12:28,650 --> 02:12:31,486
This thing doesn't wanna stay on there
for some reason.

1376
02:12:31,653 --> 02:12:36,366
- Cookies.
- Oh, look at that, huh? Thank you, honey.

1377
02:12:36,533 --> 02:12:39,494
Oh, and they're nice and warm too.
You want one?

1378
02:12:40,245 --> 02:12:41,913
- Cookie.
- Good job on that.

1379
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:44,082
Doyle.

1380
02:12:46,084 --> 02:12:47,502
What the hell?

1381
02:12:48,086 --> 02:12:50,547
Hey! Hey, stop!

1382
02:12:50,714 --> 02:12:52,424
Hey, get out of my car!

1383
02:12:52,591 --> 02:12:54,092
Hey! Hey!

1384
02:12:55,135 --> 02:12:57,262
- Clyde.
- You open this door.

1385
02:12:57,804 --> 02:12:59,431
- Let go!
- Hey.

1386
02:13:01,892 --> 02:13:03,977
Doyle?

1387
02:13:05,437 --> 02:13:08,773
Doyle? Doyle? Doyle?

1388
02:13:10,901 --> 02:13:13,612
Doyle! Help! Help us!

1389
02:13:13,778 --> 02:13:16,781
Help!

1390
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:24,456
It's Christmas.

1391
02:13:26,291 --> 02:13:29,211
Could've just pushed him off.

1392
02:13:29,711 --> 02:13:31,046
Christmas day.

1393
02:13:31,796 --> 02:13:36,051
He had a gun. You all saw it, right?

1394
02:14:00,116 --> 02:14:02,786
How you gonna perfume this,
Miss Lane?

1395
02:14:04,079 --> 02:14:05,497
Ma'am.

1396
02:14:06,957 --> 02:14:08,375
Where's the body?

1397
02:14:08,542 --> 02:14:10,335
How many bullets?

1398
02:14:21,388 --> 02:14:23,598
Where's my story?

1399
02:14:23,765 --> 02:14:26,810
I'm not sure
if I can cover them any more.

1400
02:14:26,977 --> 02:14:30,313
Try saying that different. A lot different.

1401
02:14:31,189 --> 02:14:34,943
I just Can't help thinking
I've been aiding and abetting, sir.

1402
02:14:35,110 --> 02:14:39,364
We sell newspapers, P.J.
It isn't our fingers pulling the trigger.

1403
02:14:39,531 --> 02:14:42,701
You know this story better than anyone.

1404
02:14:42,867 --> 02:14:47,038
You gotta turn it
so you can live with yourself, turn it.

1405
02:14:47,205 --> 02:14:52,043
If Bonnie and Clyde are the bad guys,
make them the bad guys.

1406
02:15:27,454 --> 02:15:29,247
She thought he had a gun, Buck.

1407
02:15:31,625 --> 02:15:34,586
- I didn't say nothing.
- Yeah, well, don't.

1408
02:15:34,753 --> 02:15:37,922
All right? You neither, Blanche.

1409
02:15:40,717 --> 02:15:42,218
Hi.

1410
02:15:44,721 --> 02:15:47,182
- How's your mother?
- Oh, she's just fine, yeah.

1411
02:15:47,349 --> 02:15:49,267
Thanks for asking.

1412
02:15:49,434 --> 02:15:51,019
All right.

1413
02:16:06,201 --> 02:16:07,786
Maybe you ought to lighten up.

1414
02:16:10,455 --> 02:16:12,666
Prohibition's over.

1415
02:16:12,832 --> 02:16:14,751
You lighten up.

1416
02:16:20,298 --> 02:16:23,218
You got a play on your jack of hearts.

1417
02:16:23,385 --> 02:16:25,303
I saw that.

1418
02:16:49,411 --> 02:16:51,830
Wish she'd just shut up.

1419
02:16:51,996 --> 02:16:54,165
She don't even mean it.

1420
02:16:54,582 --> 02:16:56,584
Why do they always get
the bigger room?

1421
02:16:56,751 --> 02:16:59,421
Why's she always the one
divvying up the money?

1422
02:16:59,587 --> 02:17:01,005
Can we just play dominoes?

1423
02:17:01,172 --> 02:17:04,259
She talks about family,
us all sticking together...

1424
02:17:04,426 --> 02:17:06,219
...but she's just out for herself.

1425
02:17:06,386 --> 02:17:08,847
She's shorting us, Buck.

1426
02:17:09,013 --> 02:17:10,682
That little hope chest of hers?

1427
02:17:10,849 --> 02:17:13,643
Notice how she never opens it
when anyone's around?

1428
02:17:13,810 --> 02:17:16,896
No, I haven't.
It's probably just her underthingies.

1429
02:17:17,063 --> 02:17:19,649
In any damn case,
it's none of your damn business.

1430
02:17:19,816 --> 02:17:21,609
Like hell, it isn't.

1431
02:17:21,776 --> 02:17:25,363
And I was right there behind her,
and I sure didn't see no gun.

1432
02:18:09,199 --> 02:18:12,952
Gotta go, gotta go. Buck?
Buck, we got company.

1433
02:18:13,161 --> 02:18:15,330
- Daddy?
- Get the light, get the light.

1434
02:18:15,497 --> 02:18:16,831
Daddy, what's going on?

1435
02:18:24,631 --> 02:18:26,174
L-Hey.

1436
02:18:38,645 --> 02:18:41,064
Get down. Get down.

1437
02:18:42,148 --> 02:18:44,984
This is the police.
We've got you surrounded.

1438
02:18:45,151 --> 02:18:46,694
Come out with your hands up.

1439
02:18:56,329 --> 02:18:59,916
You got one minute to exit the building.

1440
02:19:03,002 --> 02:19:05,964
- Stay low. Grab our stuff.
- All right, all right.

1441
02:19:53,219 --> 02:19:55,972
- No.
- Leave the damn box.

1442
02:19:56,139 --> 02:19:58,683
No. No, I'm not leaving it. No.

1443
02:20:00,518 --> 02:20:01,936
The hell you doing?

1444
02:20:04,606 --> 02:20:06,816
Let's go. Let's get going.

1445
02:20:27,795 --> 02:20:29,130
Daddy!

1446
02:20:29,631 --> 02:20:31,341
No, Daddy!

1447
02:20:32,258 --> 02:20:34,010
Come on.

1448
02:20:43,186 --> 02:20:44,729
Come on.

1449
02:20:50,068 --> 02:20:54,197
What the hell were you doing,
cutting your damn toenails?

1450
02:20:56,532 --> 02:21:00,370
No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

1451
02:21:00,578 --> 02:21:01,996
Daddy, no.

1452
02:21:02,163 --> 02:21:05,208
Daddy, no. No!

1453
02:21:06,167 --> 02:21:09,337
Daddy, no! No, Daddy!

1454
02:21:09,963 --> 02:21:11,965
Go on! Go on!

1455
02:21:22,266 --> 02:21:23,851
Daddy!

1456
02:21:54,799 --> 02:21:56,551
- Howdy.
- Evening.

1457
02:21:57,176 --> 02:21:59,012
Evening to you.

1458
02:22:00,388 --> 02:22:01,514
If I could get some...

1459
02:22:01,681 --> 02:22:04,976
Just a can of coffee and some beans...

1460
02:22:05,143 --> 02:22:07,353
...and a loaf of that bread there too.

1461
02:22:10,106 --> 02:22:12,316
Some ice. I could use some ice.

1462
02:22:12,984 --> 02:22:14,527
Yeah.

1463
02:22:16,279 --> 02:22:19,699
Yeah, also some of those bandages
over there too.

1464
02:22:21,075 --> 02:22:25,705
And how about a can
of that lighter fluid right there?

1465
02:22:25,913 --> 02:22:27,832
Yeah.

1466
02:22:27,999 --> 02:22:29,667
Is that it?

1467
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:34,672
- What's the damage?
- That'll be 1.75.

1468
02:22:38,051 --> 02:22:39,802
All right.

1469
02:22:42,388 --> 02:22:46,017
- Can I help you with that?
- No, no, no. Oh, my...

1470
02:22:46,184 --> 02:22:49,937
Yeah, I sprained my shoulder
playing baseball with friends.

1471
02:22:50,104 --> 02:22:51,898
Yeah.

1472
02:22:52,065 --> 02:22:54,067
Keep the change.

1473
02:23:15,004 --> 02:23:18,424
We brought everything we had
and gave it good.

1474
02:23:18,591 --> 02:23:20,802
They just got lucky.

1475
02:23:21,302 --> 02:23:23,054
Lucky?

1476
02:23:25,890 --> 02:23:29,227
Unless I'm mistaken,
didn't you and I have a conversation...

1477
02:23:29,393 --> 02:23:33,523
...that I'd be here in the morning
and take charge of the apprehension?

1478
02:23:33,689 --> 02:23:37,318
We had reason to believe
that they might be gone come morning.

1479
02:23:37,485 --> 02:23:39,070
Really?

1480
02:23:39,487 --> 02:23:42,865
Had nothing to do with you
wanting to make a name for yourself...

1481
02:23:43,032 --> 02:23:45,243
...by collaring Bonnie and Clyde?

1482
02:23:47,328 --> 02:23:50,832
It was like nothing I've ever seen.
It was like the Fourth of July.

1483
02:23:50,998 --> 02:23:54,544
It was Bonnie doing the shooting.
I only saw her for an instant.

1484
02:23:55,294 --> 02:23:58,297
I'll never forget her.
She was the one firing that tommy.

1485
02:24:02,802 --> 02:24:04,971
Good girl, Ted?

1486
02:24:07,515 --> 02:24:09,267
Jesus, you're sweet on her.

1487
02:24:11,519 --> 02:24:13,312
Just got word out of Iowa.

1488
02:24:13,479 --> 02:24:16,816
Clerk at a market, works as a marshal,
just ID'd Clyde Barrow.

1489
02:24:16,983 --> 02:24:19,986
- You tell them to wait till I got there?
- Tried...

1490
02:24:20,153 --> 02:24:22,446
...but my deputy heard it
from a dispatcher.

1491
02:24:22,613 --> 02:24:25,867
Sounds like the train...
Damn big one, from what he understood.

1492
02:24:26,033 --> 02:24:27,285
... just left the station.

1493
02:24:27,451 --> 02:24:31,914
Why's every idiot with a badge
gotta try to out-idiot the other?

1494
02:24:43,509 --> 02:24:45,094
It's cold, Bonnie. We're cold.

1495
02:24:49,390 --> 02:24:52,768
Got a good fire burning now.
It'll be okay.

1496
02:24:53,936 --> 02:24:55,771
Can't take no more of Daddy's hurt.

1497
02:24:56,939 --> 02:24:59,775
Gotta do something
about Daddy's hurt.

1498
02:25:04,322 --> 02:25:06,157
Put some ice on his head.

1499
02:25:06,324 --> 02:25:08,743
Should take down the swelling,
ease his pain.

1500
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:11,245
There's also bandages
in the other one.

1501
02:25:11,412 --> 02:25:15,416
- Can't hardly see, Clyde.
- I was talking to Bonnie.

1502
02:25:26,302 --> 02:25:29,805
Your brother walked five miles into town
to get you this ice, Buck.

1503
02:25:33,935 --> 02:25:37,563
- Gonna get you home.
- Don't got a home.

1504
02:25:42,026 --> 02:25:44,904
Daddy. Daddy.

1505
02:25:58,668 --> 02:26:00,086
No!

1506
02:26:03,506 --> 02:26:04,840
No.

1507
02:26:20,856 --> 02:26:22,066
Mama.

1508
02:26:23,567 --> 02:26:25,194
Mama.

1509
02:27:08,321 --> 02:27:09,864
They're coming.

1510
02:27:11,949 --> 02:27:14,410
Come on. Wake up right now.
They're coming.

1511
02:27:17,913 --> 02:27:21,667
Daddy. Daddy, come on.
Come on, wake up.

1512
02:27:23,085 --> 02:27:26,005
Come on. Coming right now.

1513
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:34,263
Ready.

1514
02:27:36,390 --> 02:27:38,100
Fire!

1515
02:28:02,124 --> 02:28:03,167
Everybody out.

1516
02:28:10,925 --> 02:28:12,802
- Daddy. Daddy, come on.
- Come on.

1517
02:28:19,558 --> 02:28:21,560
- Down by the creek.
- Go on, go on.

1518
02:28:34,156 --> 02:28:35,908
I'm on them.

1519
02:29:19,452 --> 02:29:23,372
No! Daddy!

1520
02:29:24,081 --> 02:29:25,791
L-Hey.

1521
02:29:25,958 --> 02:29:29,128
Barrow, that's enough. It's over.

1522
02:29:29,295 --> 02:29:34,049
No, Buck. Clyde, help us, please.

1523
02:29:34,216 --> 02:29:36,469
- Please. No.
- Drop your weapon.

1524
02:29:36,635 --> 02:29:38,888
Come out with your hands up.

1525
02:29:41,223 --> 02:29:43,184
Do you hear me, Barrow?

1526
02:29:46,187 --> 02:29:49,815
You're finished, Barrow! Come on out!

1527
02:29:52,359 --> 02:29:53,486
No.

1528
02:30:05,623 --> 02:30:08,209
No, please.

1529
02:30:09,168 --> 02:30:10,294
No.

1530
02:30:43,285 --> 02:30:45,621
No laws are after us, Clyde.

1531
02:30:48,791 --> 02:30:50,292
Listen.

1532
02:30:52,753 --> 02:30:56,632
I loved Buck. I couldn't be more sorry
about what happened to him.

1533
02:30:56,799 --> 02:30:58,384
Well, look on the bright side.

1534
02:30:58,551 --> 02:31:01,929
- You'll probably get a nice headline.
- That isn't fair.

1535
02:31:02,096 --> 02:31:06,559
What isn't fair is my brother lying back
there with half his damn head blown off.

1536
02:31:06,725 --> 02:31:10,312
- I didn't want him involved.
- Well, he got involved.

1537
02:31:14,817 --> 02:31:17,486
And even if he dies...

1538
02:31:17,945 --> 02:31:20,447
...people are gonna remember him.

1539
02:31:21,991 --> 02:31:23,576
Clyde...

1540
02:31:23,742 --> 02:31:27,580
...Buck got to be a part of something,
something bigger than all of us.

1541
02:31:27,746 --> 02:31:30,708
You know now many people get nothing
but 60 years...

1542
02:31:30,874 --> 02:31:32,710
...of nobody knowing they're alive?

1543
02:31:32,876 --> 02:31:36,964
- Absolutely nothing?
- And that's all you care about, isn't it?

1544
02:31:37,131 --> 02:31:39,133
People knowing who you are.

1545
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:43,220
I said you weren't a horrible person,
Bonnie, but I was wrong.

1546
02:31:43,387 --> 02:31:45,889
You don't care about Buck.

1547
02:31:46,056 --> 02:31:48,142
You don't love me.

1548
02:31:48,309 --> 02:31:52,271
No, I'm just a footnote
in the story of you.

1549
02:31:52,438 --> 02:31:55,274
Every time the blood was leaking out
of some bastard...

1550
02:31:55,441 --> 02:31:59,862
...you figured just as much ink flowed to
building up the legend of Bonnie Parker.

1551
02:32:01,196 --> 02:32:04,700
And Christmas,
that wasn't cause for mercy, was it?

1552
02:32:04,867 --> 02:32:08,537
No, that was just reason for the papers
to print your picture bigger.

1553
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:10,956
You never saw a goddamn gun,
did you?

1554
02:32:11,582 --> 02:32:14,501
- Did you? Did you?
- Clyde!

1555
02:32:27,097 --> 02:32:28,682
Bonnie.

1556
02:32:40,486 --> 02:32:43,822
Get me out, get me out, get me out!

1557
02:32:58,754 --> 02:33:00,714
Right through here.

1558
02:33:25,406 --> 02:33:27,157
Daddy.

1559
02:33:31,286 --> 02:33:35,040
At least one of them got banged up,
maybe burned.

1560
02:33:35,207 --> 02:33:37,835
They'll be looking for safe harbor.

1561
02:33:40,546 --> 02:33:44,007
I wanna get word out to every
gang member ever worked with them...

1562
02:33:44,174 --> 02:33:47,094
...to the families
of all the gang members...

1563
02:33:47,261 --> 02:33:51,223
...there's full pardons and reward money
for anyone who gives up Barrow.

1564
02:33:53,142 --> 02:33:56,395
Well, I hope someone does.
Been on this a while.

1565
02:33:58,105 --> 02:34:00,149
And we'll be on it...

1566
02:34:00,983 --> 02:34:02,901
...till it's finished.

1567
02:34:21,044 --> 02:34:22,796
Gonna get you better, Bon.

1568
02:34:27,134 --> 02:34:30,304
You should have just let me burn.

1569
02:34:32,931 --> 02:34:37,144
If you meant even half of what you said,
I got no reason to keep breathing.

1570
02:34:37,311 --> 02:34:39,521
You got every reason.

1571
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:51,992
Hush now.

1572
02:35:08,300 --> 02:35:11,345
Remember when Clyde
didn't even trust you to be a lookout?

1573
02:35:12,179 --> 02:35:15,224
Pretty Boy himself would run away
if he ran into you now.

1574
02:35:15,390 --> 02:35:18,936
Probably loves you, though.
You pushed him right off the front page.

1575
02:35:21,146 --> 02:35:24,107
Pretty keen on staying
out of the limelight now, Henry.

1576
02:35:24,274 --> 02:35:26,401
Understood.

1577
02:35:26,568 --> 02:35:29,321
No better place to do it
than Nowhere, Louisiana.

1578
02:35:29,488 --> 02:35:32,366
Really appreciate you putting us up.

1579
02:35:32,533 --> 02:35:35,369
Hell, ain't no skin off my teeth.

1580
02:35:35,536 --> 02:35:37,621
It's a honor to do it.

1581
02:35:38,288 --> 02:35:41,041
Sure your father doesn't mind
us bunking down here?

1582
02:35:41,208 --> 02:35:42,501
Don't worry about him.

1583
02:35:42,668 --> 02:35:45,003
Hiding three fugitives
is no harder than one.

1584
02:35:45,170 --> 02:35:47,923
You keep us in groceries,
he'll be happy enough.

1585
02:35:51,802 --> 02:35:55,556
Hell, breakfast with Bonnie and Clyde.

1586
02:36:00,519 --> 02:36:02,521
I had a dream, Cly.

1587
02:36:02,688 --> 02:36:05,941
- What'd you dream about?
- Johnny.

1588
02:36:06,108 --> 02:36:12,197
He was the cutest little thing,
all bundled in his crib and laughing.

1589
02:36:13,866 --> 02:36:16,159
Not a care in the world.

1590
02:36:17,744 --> 02:36:20,122
I dreamed we had a baby.

1591
02:36:21,248 --> 02:36:24,960
Johnny didn't have his father's
funny little nose, did he?

1592
02:36:25,878 --> 02:36:30,340
He had the most perfect nose,
curly blond hair.

1593
02:36:30,507 --> 02:36:32,175
Blond?

1594
02:36:32,843 --> 02:36:35,095
And pretty green eyes like his daddy.

1595
02:36:41,727 --> 02:36:43,937
Iverson Methvin.

1596
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:48,233
Yeah, I got them both.

1597
02:36:52,946 --> 02:36:57,659
You sure you can make everything my
boy's done dirty come clean, Mr. Hamer?

1598
02:36:58,952 --> 02:37:01,163
I don't know how much longer.

1599
02:37:01,330 --> 02:37:03,206
A few days, maybe a week.

1600
02:37:03,373 --> 02:37:05,542
She ain't doing real good.

1601
02:37:08,086 --> 02:37:12,049
Okay. There's a reward, right?

1602
02:37:12,925 --> 02:37:16,219
Bienville Parish, Louisiana.

1603
02:37:28,357 --> 02:37:31,860
- Where we going, Clyde?
- Texas.

1604
02:37:32,027 --> 02:37:35,697
Figure we should see your family,
your mama and mine...

1605
02:37:35,864 --> 02:37:38,033
...get some new clothes.

1606
02:37:38,408 --> 02:37:41,995
But you bought that Easter ham
for the Methvins.

1607
02:37:42,162 --> 02:37:46,166
Yeah, we pretty much played out
our welcome.

1608
02:37:48,377 --> 02:37:50,963
Mama will be so happy to see us.

1609
02:37:53,882 --> 02:37:57,177
Yeah, you are so cute.

1610
02:38:02,766 --> 02:38:04,643
Missed that one.

1611
02:38:05,894 --> 02:38:09,106
They were selling
these little darlings, Clyde.

1612
02:38:09,272 --> 02:38:11,858
They were practically
giving them away.

1613
02:38:12,025 --> 02:38:14,236
No, I don't like rabbits. They're dirty.

1614
02:38:14,403 --> 02:38:17,364
He's a heck of a lot cleaner than you.

1615
02:38:17,531 --> 02:38:19,825
I don't want that thing in the car.

1616
02:38:21,284 --> 02:38:24,204
It's a present for my mama, Clyde.

1617
02:38:26,873 --> 02:38:29,042
Fine, if that's how you feel...

1618
02:38:29,209 --> 02:38:32,254
...just take the dirty little bunny
and give it back.

1619
02:38:47,644 --> 02:38:51,106
- What you drinking, Mama?
- Whatever I please.

1620
02:38:51,273 --> 02:38:54,192
It don't look to be pleasing you.
You look miserable.

1621
02:38:54,359 --> 02:38:57,863
What in the hell would I have
to be miserable about?

1622
02:38:59,740 --> 02:39:01,992
It ain't helping anyway.

1623
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:04,870
I ought to get me
some of whatever pharmaceutical...

1624
02:39:05,037 --> 02:39:08,457
...Roy Thornton's wife's
floating on over there.

1625
02:39:10,417 --> 02:39:11,752
She's in a lot of pain.

1626
02:39:11,918 --> 02:39:16,673
Pretty sure the two of you have given
a lot more than you've gotten.

1627
02:39:20,177 --> 02:39:25,724
These days with the suns,
those are the days you'd come visit.

1628
02:39:25,891 --> 02:39:30,520
No matter what you did, I was always
happy to see my little ray of sunshine.

1629
02:39:31,521 --> 02:39:35,817
But Buck, he was trying to be good.

1630
02:39:35,984 --> 02:39:40,072
The fact that you done so much bad,
you couldn't go to your brother's funeral.

1631
02:39:40,238 --> 02:39:42,991
- Mom.
- You're the reason he's dead and buried.

1632
02:39:43,158 --> 02:39:47,496
Not the oops that shot him,
not the fates.

1633
02:39:47,662 --> 02:39:49,706
It's just you.

1634
02:40:13,522 --> 02:40:16,733
Look at your cute little ears.

1635
02:40:17,651 --> 02:40:20,779
I was thinking we need to start
weaning you off that Amytal.

1636
02:40:20,946 --> 02:40:26,201
You are so cute.
Mama's just gonna eat you up.

1637
02:40:26,368 --> 02:40:28,245
You hear what I'm saying?

1638
02:40:28,995 --> 02:40:34,417
Yeah, but right now I've just gotta say,
it's just making things easier.

1639
02:40:35,752 --> 02:40:36,878
You know what?

1640
02:40:37,045 --> 02:40:40,048
Mama's not gonna appreciate you
near as much as us.

1641
02:40:40,215 --> 02:40:44,136
We're gonna keep you, sonny boy.
What do you think about that?

1642
02:40:56,523 --> 02:40:57,941
L-Hey.

1643
02:41:13,498 --> 02:41:16,418
- You folks all right?
- We're as right as right can be.

1644
02:41:16,585 --> 02:41:18,128
Just enjoying the day.

1645
02:41:18,295 --> 02:41:21,840
Fixing to have a little picnic
just over there by that tree.

1646
02:41:23,508 --> 02:41:26,595
- That's a fine enough spot for that, right?
- Yep.

1647
02:41:26,761 --> 02:41:29,347
- Just wanted to make sure you're okay.
- Thank you.

1648
02:41:29,514 --> 02:41:31,099
All right. Happy Easter, miss.

1649
02:42:31,576 --> 02:42:33,745
See how his head bounced, Clyde?

1650
02:42:36,706 --> 02:42:38,667
Just like a rubber ball.

1651
02:42:44,214 --> 02:42:46,841
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

1652
02:42:47,008 --> 02:42:50,053
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1653
02:42:50,220 --> 02:42:52,222
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

1654
02:42:52,931 --> 02:42:54,766
He restoreth my soul.

1655
02:42:54,933 --> 02:42:58,979
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1656
02:42:59,145 --> 02:43:02,440
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

1657
02:43:02,607 --> 02:43:05,360
...I will fear no evil,
for though art with me.

1658
02:43:05,527 --> 02:43:09,489
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me ....

1659
02:43:09,656 --> 02:43:12,993
My great-grandma said the Good Book
called the apple Eve ate...

1660
02:43:13,159 --> 02:43:15,287
"the fruit of knowledge."

1661
02:43:16,121 --> 02:43:18,581
I never understood
why knowledge was thought...

1662
02:43:18,748 --> 02:43:20,792
...to be the root of so much suffering.

1663
02:43:20,959 --> 02:43:24,963
The ongoing saga of Bonnie and Clyde
took another dark turn Easter Sunday...

1664
02:43:25,130 --> 02:43:28,842
...es two lawmen, E.B. Wheeler and
Holloway Murphy, were gunned down...

1665
02:43:29,009 --> 02:43:32,137
...outside the notorious outlaw couple's
hometown of Dallas.

1666
02:43:32,304 --> 02:43:36,182
Wheeler's widow, slated to marry
the man the following weekend...

1667
02:43:36,349 --> 02:43:40,103
...found herself wearing her wedding
gown to a much less festive affair.

1668
02:43:40,270 --> 02:43:44,274
And while Bonnie and Clyde had
at one time been virtual folk heroes...

1669
02:43:44,441 --> 02:43:48,403
...e rancher who witnessed the event
was fer from impressed.

1670
02:43:48,570 --> 02:43:54,326
After she shot that lawman, she said,
"See how his head bounced, Clyde?

1671
02:43:54,492 --> 02:43:57,329
Like a rubber ball."
That's what she said.

1672
02:43:58,288 --> 02:43:59,706
Do you believe that?

1673
02:43:59,873 --> 02:44:03,168
"Like a rubber ball. " Man, oh, man.

1674
02:44:03,335 --> 02:44:07,005
The hunt continues for Bonnie
and Clyde, believed to be in Louisiana.

1675
02:44:07,172 --> 02:44:10,300
Police have set up roadblocks
on all roads to other states.

1676
02:44:10,467 --> 02:44:15,513
But on that Easter Sunday,
I tasted the apple.

1677
02:44:16,556 --> 02:44:19,142
And the knowledge it gave me...

1678
02:44:19,309 --> 02:44:21,686
...of what I needed to do...

1679
02:44:22,812 --> 02:44:25,065
wasn't sweet at all.

1680
02:44:54,719 --> 02:44:56,596
Methvin residence.

1681
02:44:57,806 --> 02:44:59,349
Yeah.

1682
02:45:01,601 --> 02:45:03,520
It's Clyde Barrow.

1683
02:45:04,312 --> 02:45:07,107
Yeah. All right, I'll see you then.

1684
02:45:10,402 --> 02:45:14,906
- Hamer.
- This is Methvin, Iverson.

1685
02:45:15,740 --> 02:45:19,536
Everything's been arranged.
Barrow's on his way here.

1686
02:45:20,286 --> 02:45:23,957
- Should be here in a couple of days.
- Thank you, Mr. Methvin.

1687
02:45:24,707 --> 02:45:28,002
We'll make good on our promises
to your boy.

1688
02:45:40,557 --> 02:45:43,685
What are we doing back here,
Clyde Champion?

1689
02:45:44,144 --> 02:45:48,148
Called Methvin while you were dozing.
Gonna pick him up.

1690
02:45:49,023 --> 02:45:51,985
Figure we could pull a few jobs
in Louisiana...

1691
02:45:52,152 --> 02:45:54,779
...maybe push into Arkansas.

1692
02:45:55,321 --> 02:45:57,991
Nobody knows us in Arkansas.

1693
02:45:58,158 --> 02:46:02,412
Too soon to be thinking about retiring
to that lake home, huh?

1694
02:46:03,037 --> 02:46:04,289
Not just yet.

1695
02:46:11,296 --> 02:46:14,048
You know what I been thinking, Clyde?

1696
02:46:14,215 --> 02:46:18,386
- I ain't no mind reader.
- We should lie in wait for him.

1697
02:46:18,887 --> 02:46:21,848
- Who?
- Frank Hamer.

1698
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:26,769
Put one in him
instead of the other way around.

1699
02:46:28,229 --> 02:46:32,108
- Get us a hell of a headline too, huh?
- Who gives two damns about that?

1700
02:46:32,275 --> 02:46:36,029
Just be nice
to be able to sleep better at night.

1701
02:46:38,490 --> 02:46:40,408
Yeah.

1702
02:47:04,682 --> 02:47:06,684
Something wrong, Clyde?

1703
02:47:07,227 --> 02:47:08,603
No.

1704
02:47:09,729 --> 02:47:12,857
Just enjoying now beautiful
everything is.

1705
02:47:34,504 --> 02:47:36,005
You don't have to shoot, Ted.

1706
02:47:37,048 --> 02:47:40,510
Yeah, Frank, I do.

1707
02:47:40,969 --> 02:47:43,179
That's Methvin's truck, isn't it?

1708
02:47:58,736 --> 02:47:59,779
Clyde?

1709
02:48:05,285 --> 02:48:07,954
I've always loved you, Bonnie.

1710
02:50:09,617 --> 02:50:12,120
Mr. Hamer.

1711
02:50:14,205 --> 02:50:18,376
Mr. Hamer, you shot them down
in cold blood?

1712
02:50:18,543 --> 02:50:22,380
What do you say to the accusations
you shot them down in cold blood?

1713
02:50:22,547 --> 02:50:24,382
You think it was fair, Mr. Hamer...

1714
02:50:24,549 --> 02:50:28,344
...that you didn't give Bonnie and Clyde
a warning, just executed them?

1715
02:50:29,804 --> 02:50:33,266
Ma'am, I'm afraid
what we all gave Bonnie and Clyde...

1716
02:50:33,433 --> 02:50:36,352
...was exactly what they wanted.

1717
02:50:37,145 --> 02:50:39,689
Mr. Hamer, Mr. Hamer.

1718
02:50:49,532 --> 02:50:53,619
Sometimes I like to think
that fever of unexplained origin...

1719
02:50:53,786 --> 02:50:57,540
...that I never came out
of the other side...

1720
02:50:57,707 --> 02:51:02,295
...end the rest of my life,
none of it ever happened.

1721
02:51:03,045 --> 02:51:07,425
Especially that part
where I got shot 37 times...

1722
02:51:08,134 --> 02:51:12,597
giving my Bonnie Parker
her big ending.
