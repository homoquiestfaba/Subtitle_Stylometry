think of the shoofly pie?

175
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,876
Delicious.

176
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,249
I'm gonna need
another slice right quick.

177
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,916
It's Katie's recipe,
you know.

178
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,751
Our good fortune, then.

179
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,294
Katie'll makes us lots of good pies
when she's our <i>mam</i>, won't ya?

180
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,797
You'll have to patient with me,

checkers after supper?

182

get out the card.

183
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,971
Maybe Katie can
sing to us, too.

184
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,344
The song you were singing today,
from the other hymn book.

185
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,910
You must be confused, Son.

186
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,320
We only have one
hymn book, the <i>Ausband</i>.

187
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,587
We do not sing
the songs of the English.

about the singing.

right from wrong.

to Ella Mae Zook to pass along.

Nothing.

205
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,858
If we don't respond,
the matter's dead and buried.

206
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,528
No one can find out.

207
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,666
If anyone finds out,
it would change everything.

208

to be the Bishop's wife.

How can I be the kind
of wife he needs,

223
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,923
Little Jacob overheard me
singing one of my songs today

224
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,954
and told everybody
at supper.

225
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,487
Katie, I thought you
was clean past all that.

226
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,123
I prayed and prayed for God
to take the songs out of my heart,

227
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,667
but I can't
get rid of them.

228

why he'd put music

He understood me, Mary.
Like no one else.

232
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,379
Some mornings I wake up
and look out my window

233

347
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,303
I'm so sorry.

348
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,210
(GRUNTS)

349
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,070
So you spoke to
the Bishop then?

350
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,335
<i>Jah</i>, confessed.
Like <i>Dat</i> asked me to.

351
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,366
It's <i>gut</i> to set
things right, Katie.

352
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,610
Get to the plain truth.
You'll feel better.

353
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,789
<i>Mam</i>, who's Laura Mayfield?

354
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,391
Mama.

355
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,562
You cut yourself.

356
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,704
I'm okay.

357
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,410
What happened down there?

358
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,250
She found a scrap of
the letter in the stove.

359
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,956
Tea, <i>Mam</i>.

360
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,554
With two sprigs of mint,
just how you like it.

361
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,827
Go see to supper, Katie-girl.
Let your mama rest.

362
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,604
How much did she see?

363
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,904
Just a name.

364
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,674
What if she starts
asking questions?

365
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,554
What do I say?
Nothing.

366
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,686
We say nothing.

367
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,325
For 20 years,

368
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,987
I've been praying this
day would never come.

369
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,691
She's been our daughter since
the day we brought her home.

370
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:47,497
I will not allow this English woman
to interfere with our lives.

371
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,145
<i>Mam</i>, whose dress is this?

372
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,786
Where did you get that?

373
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,351
In the attic
with my keepsakes.

374
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,393
There's a name stitched into it.
Katherine Mayfield.

375
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,559
Same name that was
on that scrap of letter.

376
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,790
It's an English name.
Ain't so?

377
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,361
REBECCA: Katie, I...

378
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,560
Katie, go.

379
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,194
What are you not telling me?
Go. Go.

380
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,901
Samuel! Time has come.

381
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,345
Katie.

382
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,883
That fancy dress there.

383
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,688
It's yours.

384
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,360
I'm Katherine Mayfield?

385
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,759
<i>Jah</i>, you were.

386
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,760
Please, explain.

387
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,296
Since the day we
laid eyes on you,

388
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,201
we've loved you like our own.

389
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,236
What are you saying?

390
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,079
We're saying that you
are English by birth,

391
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,706
and you are Amish
by adoption.

392
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,307
I'm not your daughter?

393
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,943
You have always
been our daughter!

394
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,951
You just weren't
born to us.

395
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,254
Why didn't you tell me?

396
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,386
It would have
made no difference.

397
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,953
Yes, it would,
I'm not Amish!

398
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,866
You are Amish
through and through.

399
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,005
The name on the letter.

400
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,742
Laura Mayfield. She's...

401
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:15,903
Yes.

402
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,604
The letter was
from her, wasn't it?

403
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,143
What did it say?

404
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,343
It don't matter none, Katie!

405
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,349
Yes it does, it matters to me!
Why did you burn it?

406
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,151
Because some things
are better left unsaid.

407
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,483
All that matters is
we are your family.

408
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,187
But, Dad.
Katie.

409
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,732
Please, trust me on this.

410
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,299
You're better off not
digging up old graves.

411
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,138
Does Benjamin know?

412
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,140
No, just the three of us.

413
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,009
And that's how we're going
to keep it for everyone's sake.

414

(DOOR OPENS)

415
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,473

Not a word about it.

416
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,708
BENJAMIN: Morning, all.

417
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,429
ELLA MAE: Don't suppose you can
pretend not to have seen this

418
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,057
when it shows up
as a wedding gift.

419
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,298
It's for me?

420
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,764
Cow's out of the barn now.

421
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,939
Please,
pour yourself some tea.

422
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,014
What's weighing
on you, Katie-girl?

423
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,383
Last time you stopped by
unannounced was three years ago.

424
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,192
Talking to you lifted
my spirits, Ella Mae.

425
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,459
The only thing that
got me through some days.

426
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,693
Well, I still
have ears to hear.

427
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,639
That envelop you
give <i>Mam</i> the other day.

428
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,235
May I ask how
you come by it?

429
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,685
You and your
folks have a talk?

430
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:09,081
<i>Jah</i>, they told me
about the English woman.

431
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,587
But they wouldn't tell me
what the letter said.

432
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:18,066
Plainly, it weren't meant
for my eyes or yours.

433
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,862
All I know

434
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:26,565
is that I was the baby catcher
in this community for 50 years.

435
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,776
Of all those
hundreds of babies,

436
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,442
only one I didn't catch.

437
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,376
Me?

438
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,448
Your folks brought
you home all bundled up

439
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,616
from the hospital
in Lancaster.

440
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,120
Why do you think
she gave me away?

441
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,964
Perhaps the better question
is why has she come back?

442
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,165
My folks won't say.

443
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,400
Maybe they're doing
what's best for you.

444
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,209
They kept it a secret
from me my whole life.

445
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,801
How is that
what's best for me?

446
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,607
Don't be so quick to judge.

447
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,250
You don't have all
the puzzle pieces.

448
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,217
But don't I deserve to?

449
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,080
What if I was supposed to have
a whole other life, Ella Mae?

450
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,622
Out there,
among the English.

451
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,185
Oh, I won't deny this
is powerful news.

452
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:25,030
But no matter
where God puts us,

453
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,170
it's up to us how
we choose to live.

454
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,023
Can I help you?

455
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,321
I want to look like you.

456
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,360
Excuse me?

457
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,393
I mean, I would like to dress
in something like you are wearing.

458
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,532
Not like this.

459
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,668
Okay. All right, then. Yeah.

460
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:06,131
Trust me.
You were born to wear these.

(CHATTERING)

462
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,056
EPHRAM: God has said, "It's not
good that man should be alone.

463
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:18,223
"Let us make him
a partner like himself."

464
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,235
And for this reason,

465
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,899
a man should leave
his father and mother

466
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,067
and be joined to his wife.

467
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,477
And the two shall
become one flesh.

468
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,747
So,

469
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:40,013
we stand here today
to join this couple,

00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:45,858
John Beiler with Katie Lapp,
in the eyes of the Lord.

471
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,929
If there's a soul present

472
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:54,435
who could give cause why
these two should not be united,

473
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,562
let them speak now,

474
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,438
for after this, not one complaint
should be heard.

475
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,115
If there be no objections

476
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,850
and our sister
and brother agree...

477
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,815
I... I...

478
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,129
I'm so sorry, John Beiler.

479
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,234
I cannot marry you.

480
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,667
I'm so sorry.

481
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,256
Katie, are you in here?

482
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,030
Katie!

483
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:08,832
Katie, are you out here?
Please, answer me!

484
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:14,646
I'm not angry with you!
I just want to know you're okay!

488
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:38,201
Katie! Where have you been?

489
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,771
Have you any idea
of what you've done?

490
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,742
What will the people
think of us now?

491
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,784
Your conduct today has put
shame on this entire family.

492
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,212
I don't expect
you to understand.

493
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:56,815
But I did John
a favor today.

494
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,292
What you did was
leave a widower

495
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,828
with no wife and no
mother for his boys!

496
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,794
John thought he was marrying
a good Amish woman.

497
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,094
But that's not what I am.

498
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,800
Is it?
Daughter.

499
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,502
Don't let your willful
spirit get you shunned.

00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,768
Benjamin, take little Eli.
Go home to your family.

You are to go to
the Bishop tomorrow.

503
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,191
You are to repent for what you did
and beg him to take you back.

504
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,060
If he will still have you.

505
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:47,534
I will not. I will not
obey you in this, Papa.

506
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,671
All my life, I trusted you
to know what's best for me.

507
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,042
But you never
trusted me enough

508
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,376
to tell me
the truth about myself!

509
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,951
I have a right to know
what that letter said.

510
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,748
I demand you tell
me what it said!

511
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,118
You demand?

512
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,556
You speak to me with respect,
you hear me? I'm your father!

513
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:05,821
You are not my father!

raised her as our own.

522
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:39,113
And you were never to
come looking for her.

523
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,453
I know,
but things changed.

524
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,449
Not for us.

525
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,254
For her own sake,
we never told her about you.

526
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:52,225
But you coming here,
sending letters,

527
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,627
snooping around,

528
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,402
forced us to tell her
about you.

529
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,406
I am so sorry.

530
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,773
I just wanted to
meet with Katherine.

531
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,869
Katie.

532
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,106
Katie. I just...

533
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,648
I just wanted to see
her for a few moments.

534
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,815
You may think that I'm naive.

535
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,015
But I know what you want.

536
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,956
You want to take her from us.

537
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,691
No.

538
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,730
I would never do that.

539
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,825
If that's true,

540
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,096
write another letter.

541
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:32,596
Another letter?

542
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,165
One that says you're
sorry for coming here,

543
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,970
for trying to see us.

544
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:40,444
And that once you got here,
you realized that it was all

545
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:44,986
a foolish mistake, that you
lost your heart to see Katie.

546
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,088
And that you're going home,
never to return.

547
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,115
I could never
write those things.

548
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:55,825
You would if you wanted
what's best for Katie.

549
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,234
Not what's best for you.

550
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,763
But I couldn't
say what isn't true.

551
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,635
Then we have nothing more
to say to one another.

552
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,166
I've come to you
seeking counsel.

553
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,129
I'm at my wits'
end with the girl.

554
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,267
We sympathize, Samuel Lapp.

555
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,942
It's a good thing you want to bring
some order back to your household.

556
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,516
It looks to me
as if the poor lamb

557
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,177
has just lost her way.

558
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,484
Let us not forget,

559
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,617
our Lord left
the 99 to go and bring

560
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,686
the one lost sheep
back to the fold.

561
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,898
True, Ephram, but what if all
this ruefulness

562
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,905
is evidence that she wants
to run from the flock?

563
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,472
Leave the people behind.

564
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:19,511
Samuel, this is the question
only you can answer.

565
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:24,945
Are you fearful she's on the
brink of leaving the church?

566
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,947
I pray to God
it's not the case.

567
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,590
But I can't promise
that it ain't in her mind.

568
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,134
Then the scripture
is clear on that.

569
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,539
If she will not
listen to admonishment,

570
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,441
then for her own good,

571
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,207
she has to be disciplined.

572
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,183
"With such a one,
you shall not even eat!"

573
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,381
Bishop John,

574
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:10,090
as grievous as this is, as our shepherd,
this matter now falls to you.

575
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,715
John.

576
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,218
I was planning
to come see you,

577
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,228
but I didn't want to upset the boys
any more than I already had.

578
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,628
Were you planning
to make a confession?

579
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:49,727
No.

580
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,430
(SIGHS)

581
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,938
This confirms it then.

582
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,013
You are drifting
away from the people.

583
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,551
As of today,

584
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,087
you are shunned.

585
00:54:12,088 --> 00:54:13,691
None of us in Hickory Hollow
can speak to you.

586
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,788
You may not eat at the same table
with other church members

587
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:19,299
nor do business with any
plain soul until such time

588
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,631
that you come to your senses

589
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,801
and we see that your actions
meet with your convictions.

590
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,999
Then you may be able
to offer a kneeling

591
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:29,701
confession before
the congregation.

592
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:35,247
And it is only then
<i>die Meinding</i> can be lifted,

593
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,914
even if it takes
the rest of your life.

594
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,032
Mama, why is Katie
sitting at the kids' table?

595
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,263
(SHUSHING)

596
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,200
Just eat your food.

597
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,802
Did you run into Abe Stoltzfus
at the farmers' market today?

598
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:09,933
No.

599
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:13,879
He was going to give you some
medicine to deliver to Ella Mae.

600
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,608
What's the matter
with Ella Mae?

601
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,522
Must be the
old girl's arthritis.

602
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,455
Acts up with
the change of seasons.

603
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,892
I'll go by tomorrow,
take it to her.

604
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,060
Or you could let
me take it to her.

605
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,930
SAMUEL: Horses need
their supper, too.

606
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,732
I'll help.

607
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,308
Ephram, please.
You don't have to say nothing.

608
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,817
Just let me buy
the thread I need.

609
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:48,084
I've always been able to
help her when she's suffering.

610
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:51,224
And now there's
not a thing I can do.

611
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,335
I can't speak to her.
I can't hold her hand.

612
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:02,274
I know I've been hard on the girl.
Have been all her life.

613
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,445
Give her some time.

614
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,345
She'll come to her senses,
do a kneeling confession.

615
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:10,543
All will be well again.

616
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,410
It's what
the shunning's meant for.

617
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,022
You'll see.

618
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,596
But this pain, Samuel?

619
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,698
Is this God's
way of showing us

620
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,605
what Laura Mayfield
has felt all these years?

621
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:37,870
Just wanted to be
close to her child,

622
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,971
just to see her one time,

623
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:44,885
but having a wall
separating her.

624
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:19,777
(GUITAR PLAYING)

625
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,728
She has no respect at all.

626
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:35,456
I'm not trying to
be disrespectful.

627
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:36,588
It's the only way to
get your attention.

628
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,529
We've given her every opportunity.
How does she repay us?

629
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:39,725
Please, <i>Dat</i>, talk to me.

630
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:40,824
Samuel, please!

631
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,693
She brings this English
instrument into our home!

632
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,795
<i>Dat</i>, please talk to me!
I don't know what to do.

633
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,306
I need my papa's help
to help me to know what to do!

634
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:49,565
REBECCA: Samuel,
maybe we could just...

635
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:50,633
What?

636
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,236
We could what?

637
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,008
You want to defy the order?
No.

638
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,980
You want to walk away
from everything we believe in?

639
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,039
No.

640
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,551
Everything that
sets our world apart?

641
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,085
Please, talk to me.

642
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:07,417
No!

643
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,497
(CRYING) Talk to me,
please. I need you.

644
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:51,329
DANIEL:
Remember the fireflies?

645
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,637
They were everywhere,
weren't they?

646
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,474
DANIEL: Shining all around us
as I took you home in my buggy

647
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,210
on this very road.

648
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,083
The night we first
fell for each other.

649
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,048
Everything was perfect.

650
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,890
Everything was right.

651
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:19,095
The people have always
been there for me, Daniel.

652
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:22,568
When you drowned, they gave me
the strength to go on.

653
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,763
Now I've lost them, too.

654
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:30,702
Is this what my
faith has been about,

655
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,439
being banned for
the rest of my life?

656
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,377
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

657
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:37,716
Then maybe it's
time you find out.

658
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:40,745
The only people
who know the truth

659
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,256
about my birth
are <i>Mam</i> and <i>Dat</i>.

660
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,459
And even if they wanted to,

661
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,425
they can't tell me anymore
because I'm shunned.

662
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,698
I don't have anyone left.

663
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:53,289
Is that true?

664
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,397
You mean her?

665
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,937
But I don't even
know who she is.

666
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,868
I don't know how I
would even find her.

667
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:07,778
Deep down,

668
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,342
you know what you
need to do, Katie.

669
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,786
Why did you have
to leave me, Daniel?

670
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,377
Mrs. Lapp?

671
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,976
Hello, I was hoping
to see Mrs. Bennett again.

672
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,215
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're too late. She's gone.

673
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,323
Gone? But she said she was...
MAN: Jessica.

674
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:53,351
Out front. Your flight
leaves in 90 minutes.

675
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,160
I'll be right there.

676
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:01,528
Can you give
this to her for me?

677
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:04,905
I suppose so.

678
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,075
I really have to go.

679
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,174
She left so suddenly.

680
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,511
Her husband arranged
for an air ambulance

681
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,412
to fly her back
to her doctors.

682
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,408
She collapsed this morning.

683
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:19,016
Collapsed?

684
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,713
You mean she
didn't tell you?

685
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,279
Tell me what?

686
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,227
Her vitals have stabilized.
BP 90 over 60.

687
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,127
She's been in and out of UC
all the flight over here.

688
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,426
Laura, can you hear me?

689
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,093
What's wrong with her?
Please, tell me what's wrong.

690
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,861
Laura, I want you
to look at me.

691
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:39,236
That's very good. Okay.
I love you.

692
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,502
Prep her stat,
I'll be right behind you.

693
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,876
The good news is, I don't think
she's had a stroke.

694
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,538
But I did warn her
this could happen.

695
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,442
That tumor's pressing
on her spinal cord

696
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,142
and interfering with the blood
flow to her brain.

697
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,684
Oh, dear God.

698
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,482
We should have done this surgery
a month ago.

699
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:54,577
I know.

700
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,589
She kept insisting there was
something she had to do first.

701
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,682
Whatever it is,
I hope it was worth it.

702
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,696
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

703
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,506
Hello?

704
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:22,307
Yeah.

705
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,616
Yeah, she's doing great.

706
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,413
The surgery was a week ago.

707
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,891
Yeah, she made it through
with flying colors.

708
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,928
Yeah, so about our deal...

709
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,994
You went through
a major surgery, honey.

710
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,128
It's normal to
feel a little down.

711
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,102
We'll have you back on
your feet soon. You'll see.

712
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:51,170
How's she doing today?

713
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,337
Singing the blues.

714
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,312
We need to give her some space
to heal, so keep it short. Hmm?

715
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:57,646
I understand.

716
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:01,013
I know, but I just need to have
a reasonable rate of return.

717
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,288
Morning, Mrs. Bennett.

718
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,489
What's that?

719
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,386
Rebecca.

720
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,366
She came by the hotel when I was
leaving and she gave me this for you.

721
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,186
Oh! Oh!

722
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:50,102
Hey, look, I'll have to get back
to you later. Thanks.

723
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,777
Sweetheart, what's that?

724
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:02,914
Could you give
us a few moments?

725
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:30,768
<i>Mam</i>.

726
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:36,208
I want you to know
everything, Katie.

727
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,651
It's time you come
to know what happened

728
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,086
the night you came
to be our baby girl.

729
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,490
But the ban, you shouldn't be
talking to me.

730
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:51,262
I would rather be
shunned myself than have

731
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,630
another minute in
silence with you.

732
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:59,369
I was eight
months pregnant, Katie.

733
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:05,546
We loved your brother
more than anything,

734
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:09,204
but your <i>dat</i> and me
had been praying for more children.

735
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,613
And God answered our prayers.

736
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:16,316
Just not in
the way we expected.

737
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,522
LAURA: <i>There was a time</i>

738
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:23,226
before my inheritance
that you don't know about.

739
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:28,798
And it's the reason that I
went to Lancaster County.

740
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,905
<i>My mom was an alcoholic</i>
<i>and a drug addict.</i>

741
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,009
<i>And my grandmother</i>
<i>disinherited her.</i>

742
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:41,844
<i>And when I was 16,</i>
<i>I met this boy</i>

743
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,679
<i>who made me feel</i>
<i>like I mattered.</i>

744
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,480
<i>And with no one</i>
<i>really watching over me,</i>

745
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,020
<i>things happened.</i>

746
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:05,901
After Ben was born,
we tried having more babies.

747
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:11,769
I got pregnant three
times and lost each one.

748
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,438
I wasn't taking
chances with this baby.

749
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,452
I was going to
fight for this one.

750
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,187
<i>But the baby</i>
<i>started coming too early.</i>

751
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,459
<i>Your</i> dat <i>wanted</i>
<i>to fetch Ella Mae,</i>

752
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,860
<i>but I knew</i>
<i>something was wrong.</i>

753
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:35,025
<i>I just knew I</i>
<i>needed an English doctor.</i>

754
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:41,898
LAURA: <i>I begged and begged</i>
<i>him not to leave me.</i>

755
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,034
<i>But he did.</i>

756
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,073
<i>He did leave me.</i>

757
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:50,283
REBECCA: <i>Our precious</i>
<i>baby girl was born,</i>

758
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:53,353
<i>but something was</i>
<i>wrong with her heart.</i>

759
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,520
<i>There was</i>
<i>nothing they could do.</i>

760
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,820
<i>She lived</i>
<i>only a few minutes.</i>

761
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:12,703
<i>The doctors said my child-bearing</i>
<i>days were over.</i>

762
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:17,106
<i>Said we'd never again hold</i>
<i>a little one of our own.</i>

763
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:29,254
LAURA: <i>I remember sitting in the</i>
<i>wheelchair wondering what I was gonna do,</i>

764
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,425
<i>when I saw...</i>

765
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,742
REBECCA: <i>That's when</i>
<i>she came to us.</i>

766
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:01,922
<i>She was no more than 16.</i>

767
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,483
<i>She wanted you to</i>
<i>have a good life,</i>

768
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:11,287
<i>the kind of life she didn't think</i>
<i>she could provide at the time.</i>

769
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,658
<i>She offered you</i>
<i>to us in secret</i>

770
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,628
<i>when no one was watching.</i>

771
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,562
That buggy driving away was
the last I ever saw of her.

772
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,376
All that searching
and you didn't get to see her?

773
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,277
No.

774
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,644
I realized that's
the greatest gift

775
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:05,912
a mother could ever
give her daughter,

776
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,885
putting her needs
before her own.

777
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:27,462
REBECCA: <i>All anyone knew was</i>
<i>that we left the Hollow pregnant</i>

778
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,642
<i>and we returned with</i>
<i>a beautiful baby girl.</i>

779
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,524
Why did you keep it a secret?

780
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,088
Because we loved you
so much.

781
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:29,631
We were afraid
if anybody knew,

782
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:37,876
that some people would come
and try to take you away.

783
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:38,941
And that's a risk
we were never willing to take.

784
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:42,141
It mightn't have been legal
in the English's eyes.

785
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:47,448
But we knew in our hearts,
it was legal in God's.

786
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:53,086
You were a gift to us.

787
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,858
Straight from heaven.

788
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:01,828
But I now see you
were a gift to her, too.

789
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,029
She just realized it
too late.

790
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,008
Where is she now?

791
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,202
She went back home.

792
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,503
To New York.

793
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,712
There's something else.

794
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,515
She's dying, Katie.

795
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,280
And that's why
she came back.

796
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,293
She wanted to
meet the daughter

797
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,226
she gave away
all those years ago

798
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:34,160
and to ask for
your forgiveness.

799
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:56,852
I know you can't speak to me, but I
was hoping you might just listen.

800
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,121
You're just
in time for tea.

801
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:29,220
Thank you for talking to me, Ella Mae.
Breaking the ban, I mean.

802
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,226
Half the folks
in this community

803
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:35,693
think I'm as
senile as a loon anyway.

804
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,232
They'll think I forgot
there even was a ban.

805
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,636
Besides,

806
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,434
there are times
the human heart

807
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,169
needs more than the
old ways can give it.

808
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:55,241
My <i>mam</i> also talked to me.
She told me everything.

809
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:57,981
Thought she might.

810
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,146
The reason Laura Mayfield
came looking for me

811
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,984
after all these years is

812
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,024
she's dying.

813
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:09,192
She wanted to see me
while there's still time.

814
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:15,131
Then I guess you've
got a decision to make.

815
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:20,763
If I don't go now, Ella Mae,
I might never get to see her.

816
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,570
I might never find
out who I really am.

817
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,978
Who you really are?

818
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:31,047
That's a peculiar
thing to say.

819
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,948
What do you mean?

820
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,343
Well, I know who you are.

821
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,854
You're that
little girl who loved

822
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,757
picking flowers
of every color.

823
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:44,858
Squabbling with
her ornery brother.

824
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,532
Listening to her
mama's stories.

825
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,335
And always at
her father's feet.

826
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:58,308
Taking late-night buggy rides
with Daniel Fisher.

827
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,307
All of that, child.

828
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,911
That's who you are.

829
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:12,682
If you need to go
see Laura Mayfield,

830
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,395
then go.

831
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:21,564
Or if you just need
to discover the world,

832
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,294
then go.

833
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,203
And God be with you.

834
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,104
But don't go thinking you're
gonna find something out there

835
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,943
that you ain't
already found right here.

836
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:38,979
The miracle

837
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:43,251
ain't the life
you missed, Katie,

838
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,150
it's the life you've got.

839
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,932
Twenty years ago,

840
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:59,199
love brought you
to Hickory Hollow

841
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:04,733
and if you're gonna leave,

842
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,212
let it be that same love

843
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,212
that sends you off.

844
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:33,935
When are you leaving?

845
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:38,877
There's a bus out of
Lancaster later today.

846
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,505
You're going to see her then?

847
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,813
Yeah. I'm going to try.

848
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,121
But even if I don't,

849
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:55,027
I have questions I need answered
for myself out there.

850
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,832
If you do find her,
what will you say to her?

851
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,640
I'll say thank you.

852
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,346
Maybe she regrets
giving me away,

853
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,515
but I'm grateful
that she did.

854
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:24,853
Because she gave me to the best
parents a child could hope for.

855
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,455
She gave me
to my true family.

856
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:32,464
How will we know you're
all right out there?

857
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:36,330
I have money saved
up from housekeeping.

858
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:38,466
And I'll write you.

859
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:46,272
Katie, I'm so sorry
if we hurt you.

860
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:49,543
I'm sorry for
all the secrets.

861
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,875
Can you forgive me?

862
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,219
Mama, I already have.

863
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:06,523
No matter how far you go,
or how long you're gone,

864
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:09,801
we'll always be right here.

865
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:16,070
And when you're ready to come back,
we'll be waiting.

866
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,604
I love you, Mama.

867
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,848
I love you, too, Katie-girl.

868
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:26,614
Never far away.

869
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,346
Never far away.

870
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:23,574
I suppose if I was
going away on a journey,

871
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,942
a little extra
cash might help.

872
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,012
<i>Dat</i>.

873
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,804
MAN ON PA: <i>Attention, passengers</i>
<i>for Buffalo, New York.</i>

874
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,472
<i>All passengers</i>
<i>for Buffalo, New York.</i>

875
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:55,633
<i>The bus will now</i>
<i>begin boarding.</i>

876
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,352
Katie!
