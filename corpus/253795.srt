00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,540
Dear Jamie,
when we're together,

2
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,911
I feel like we're
not in high school,

3
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,179
but in our own little
Chris-andJamie world.

4
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,584
Whether we're watching
"Party of Five"

5
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,122
or practicing our cheers,

6
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,318
I feel like I can
just be myself.

7
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,659
Jamie, we've been friends
for a really long time,

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,665
but I want to be
more than that.

9
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,258
Oops! I don't think so.

10
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,729
Hoping to be
your boyfriend.

11
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,741
Sincerely, Chris Brander.

12
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,470
BFF!

13
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,342
* I swear *

14
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:25,817
* By the moon and the stars
in the skies *

15
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,752
* I'll be there,
yeah *

16
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,723
* And I swear *

17
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:37,195
* Like a shadow
that's by your side *

18
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,199
* I'll be there *

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,394
* For better or worse... *

20
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,337
- Raise your hand if your brother's a homo!
- * Till death do us part... *

21
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,068
- Get out of my room!
- Mom!

22
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,373
Stupid! Anybody ever hear
of privacy around here?!

23
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,642
- * I swear *
- You're the homo.

24
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,315
Jamie!

25
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,120
Yeah, I signed
your yearbook.

26
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,661
Oh, you feel the same
way about me?

27
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,356
Oh, you want a kiss?

28
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,733
Jamie,
I signed your yearbook.

29
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,793
Jamie,
I'm opening your gate.

30
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,018
What's up, guys?

31
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,024
- Class of '95.
- Mm-mm.

32
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,425
Hey, what's up, Leon, Trevor?
Great season. Great.

33
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,866
I love you.

34
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,801
- Hey, guys.
- Chris Brander, ladies and gentlemen!

35
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,963
- Happy graduation, Chris.
- What's going on?

36
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,939
I thought it was supposed to be
just the four of us.

37
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,737
The Palaminos decided
to throw Jamie

38
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,334
- a surprise graduation party.
- Oh, that's just great!

39
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,006
- Tonight's the night.
- Where is she?

40
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,879
I think I saw her go in the garage
with the football team.

41
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,747
- Sweet.
- Hey. No fear, Chris, huh? This is your

42
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,585
- chance to get out of the "friend zone."
- Yeah.

43
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,649
- Huh?
- Okay.

44
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,362
*... for hip hop
this is hip hop for today *

45
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,990
* I give props to hip hop,
so hip hop hooray... *

46
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,568
Jamie.

47
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,662
- Chris!
- Yay!

48
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,231
You came, finally!
I'm so happy.

49
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,473
Oh, come on,
come on!

50
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,553
Oh my God,
we graduated!

51
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,250
Whoo!

52
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,519
- God.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,961
What's up?

54
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,022
There's something I've been
meaning to say to you.

55
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,227
Jamie!
There you are.

56
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,862
- Hey, Tim.
- Shut up, chubs.

57
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,701
Funny guy!

58
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,606
Jamie...

59
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,907
- will you sign my yearbook, please?
- Can I do it later, Tim?

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,778
Can I do you later?

61
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,713
I need a beer!

62
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,187
I can't believe...

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,781
- I went out with him.
- You went out with him.

64
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,622
Jinx! 1-2-34-5-6-7, can't say
a thing till I say...

65
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,260
Come in.

66
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,202
- Oh, hi. Hi, Jamie.
- Hey, Dusty.

67
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,570
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

68
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,340
I didn't know
you played guitar.

69
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,313
L-I r-really...

70
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,283
- I really want to be a famous musician.
- Huh.

71
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,184
And, um,
I wrote you a song.

72
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,587
He wrote me a song!
That's so cute.

73
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,285
It's called
"Jamie Smiles."

74
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,623
Aw.

75
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,823
* When Jam... *

76
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,333
Hold on.

77
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,570
* When Jamie... *

78
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,171
He's crazy.

79
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,007
* When Jamie... *

80
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,014
God damn it!
Come on, Dusty!

81
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,609
Dusty, come here.

82
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,745
Maybe you should come back
another time when you're...

83
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,016
- Oh, no, I got it.
- You can come back

84
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,024
and then play it
for us later, okay?

85
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,117
- I really... I've got it. It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

86
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,059
- It is.
- Bye, Dusty.

87
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,459
Jesus.

88
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,023
Yeah.

89
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,194
Oh, I almost forgot.

90
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,433
I got you a little
something right here.

91
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,440
Okay. Now I know
it's a little dorky,

92
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,442
but I had to do it.

93
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,444
So look at it.

94
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,446
Will you put it
on for me?

95
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,311
- Now?
- Please, please? Put it on.

96
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,874
- Okay. Quickly.
- Okay okay okay okay.

97
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,681
- I think it's gonna fit.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,881
- Let's see.
- Okay.

99
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,821
- Here we go.
- Okay.

100
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,425
It's a little snug.

101
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,932
Oh my God,
isn't that so cute?

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,934
"Shakes come and go,

103
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,594
but friends are
furrr-ever!"

104
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,764
That's adorable!
Let's go show my mom.

105
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,831
She'll love it. Let's go
show her. Come on.

106
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,808
- Let's not. No no. Come on.
- Chris, she's gonna love it!

107
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,174
Just... just wait.

108
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,237
- Just... we're busy!
- Chris, are you okay?

109
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,681
Yes, I'm fine.
I just...

110
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,647
I signed your yearbook.

111
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,155
Um...

112
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,851
read it...
please.

113
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,119
Okay.

114
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,756
Please, God.

115
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,360
"Stud muffin, getting it on
in your love truck was hot!"

116
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,769
- Oh!
- Wait! That's not what I wrote!

117
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,807
This is Tim's yearbook.

118
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,903
- Chris?
- Oh my God!

119
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,345
Listen to this.
Listen to this.

120
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,178
"When we're together,
I feel"...

121
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,184
- Gimme!
- "Like we're not in high school, but we're

122
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,914
- in our own Chris-andJamie little world."
- Tim... okay.

123
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,047
Okay.

124
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,421
- "You're my best friend..."
- Please, don't read that.

125
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,426
"But I want to be
more than that"?

126
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,927
Ooh!

127
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,987
"Hoping to be
your boyfriend.

128
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,556
Sincerely, Chris Brander,
BFF."

129
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,763
It's a joke! That's a joke
between me and Jamie!

130
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,635
Holy shit!
Check out his shirt!

131
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,808
Aw, he's gonna cry.

132
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,612
See ya!

133
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,686
G'bye, fatty!

134
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,447
Chris!

135
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,890
Try a salad!

136
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,894
- Chris!
- Leave me alone!

137
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,123
Don't worry about it.
It happens to everybody.

138
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,497
Chris! We need to talk
about what you wrote.

139
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,502
Is that really
how you feel?

140
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,061
I don't know.
Maybe. Why?

141
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,040
Because that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever written me.

142
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,235
It was?

143
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,642
Yes.

144
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,839
I love you, Chris...

145
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,283
- like a brother.
- Hmm?

146
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:11,187
- We're friends, right?
- For sure!

147
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,160
Ah, you pussy!

148
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,786
Shut up, Tim!

149
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,693
Don't you people have anything
better to do?!

150
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,758
God! Just leave
him alone!

151
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,766
You jerks!

152
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,603
- I'll show you!
- Ooh!

153
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,007
I'll show all of you!

154
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,979
This town
is full of losers

155
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,742
and I'm pulling
out to win!

156
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,977
Chris!
Chris, come back!

157
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,452
- My name is Chris Brander!
- Chris, let's talk!

158
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,013
You remember that name!
'Cause I'm gonna be somebody!

159
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,577
I don't know what to say.

160
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,018
I mean,
the sex is good,

161
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,714
but I'm a person too.

162
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,984
I mean, I have
feelings and needs

163
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,457
other than
just physical!

164
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,586
Don't you have anything
to say for yourself?

165
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,898
I think you've pretty much
said it all.

166
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,901
You know what?
This just isn't working out.

167
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,631
Have a great life,
'cause Athena's out!

168
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,704
I don't know why you
just don't take me serious!

169
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,882
Wow!

170
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,884
I guess Athena's out.

171
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,347
God, can you
believe that?

172
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,355
I get dumped four days
before Christmas.

173
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,357
- I saw.
- Yeah, and yet, you did nothing.

174
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,086
Technically, that makes you
an accomplice.

175
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,627
Guilty as charged.

176
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,323
You know, in some cultures
they'd spank you for that.

177
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,422
Oh, I love to travel.

178
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,793
- Chris Brander.
- I'm Mandy.

179
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,565
Of course you are. You know,
I know a song called "Mandy."

180
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,573
Oh!

181
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,604
He shoots, he scores.

182
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:18,077
- Nice, nice!
- Yeah, Brander! Great job, Brander!

183
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,381
You're the bad bunny.
No. No, that's you.

184
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,684
You're the bad bunny.
Yeah.

185
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,485
Okay, that's enough
out of you.

186
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,583
Next time you call me,
you call me collect.

187
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,594
Okay. Bye-bye.

188
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,256
- So how'd it go last night?
- Home by 10:00.

189
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,629
Pants off in front
of the computer by 10:01.

190
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,134
Nice. What about Sheila?
Are you making any headway?

191
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,137
We'll see. I'm taking her
to lunch today...

192
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,298
Oh, whoa, whoa whoa.
Don't... don't do that.

193
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,035
- Okay? Don't do lunch.
- Why?

194
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,304
That's like the express lane
to the friend zone.

195
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,642
What the hell's
the friend zone?

196
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,874
See when a girl decides
that you're her friend,

197
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,473
you're no longer
a dating option.

198
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,041
You become a complete
non-sexual entity in her eyes,

199
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,883
like her brother.
Or a lamp.

200
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,479
I don't want
to be a lamp.

201
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,683
Yeah. Well, then don't be
her friend, okay?

202
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,887
Oh. Take that guy,
for example.

203
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,987
- You mean that couple?
- No no no.

204
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,658
No, I mean the guy that
wishes they were a couple.

205
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,496
- What is your point?
- My point is...

206
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,298
call Sheila, Ray.
Call her right now.

207
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,202
Move your day date
to tonight.

208
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,174
Play the entire thing aloof and no matter
what you do, kiss her at the end.

209
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,542
- 'Cause friends don't kiss.
- All right. "Aloof."

210
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,138
Hi.

211
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,482
- Straight to voicemail.
- Ouch.

212
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,182
Hope you're not too late.
You may already be girlfriends.

213
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,590
- Really? How will I know?
- Look. It doesn't matter, okay?

214
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,460
If you feel yourself
going there, walk away.

215
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,226
Where'd you come up
with this theory?

216
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,029
Some chick f'd me up
in high school bad.

217
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,400
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

218
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,961
Excuse you!

219
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,631
I saw you flirting
with me out there.

220
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,869
How could you do
that to your boyfriend?

221
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,241
Who, him?
We're just friends.

222
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,746
Oh, no no no, I never said that, Lindsay. I
wouldn't do that.

223
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,877
No, I'm driving
through a tunnel.

224
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,444
Okay. One second here.
Hey, Francine, you look great.

225
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,889
- Thanks.
- That color really brings out your legs.

226
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,951
Hey, I don't even know you.
Yeah. Ho-ho-ho.

227
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,587
That's great.
Merry Christmas.

228
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,859
I can still see it.
I can still... rub harder!

229
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,525
Don't dab at it!
Rub it.

230
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,762
Rub, rub it, rub it!

231
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,998
Look, honestly, these pants
make me look fat?

232
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,835
- Well...
- You're fired!

233
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,772
- What?
- I'm kidding.

234
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,368
Ho-ho-ho! Who's got
a Christmas present?

235
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,003
I do.

236
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,014
How you doing, boss?
Merry Christmas.

237
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,016
- I look fat in these pants?
- Hell no.

238
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,052
Excellent! So you're
seeing your family

239
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,213
- for the holidays.
- Well, as a matter of fact...

240
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,778
- Wait. You want anything?
- No.

241
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,553
Go! Wait.

242
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,526
- Family.
- Parents are separated.

243
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,495
- Jersey's not my idea of a good time, so...
- Fabulous.

244
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,292
- Check this out.
- Yeah. Great. Good.

245
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,630
First up tonight, you've seen
her in the pages of magazines,

246
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,693
and well, the opening
of practically anything,

247
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,932
but what what you may not
know about this "it" girl...

248
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,701
is her humanitarian side.

249
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,333
Hey, everyone.
I'm Samantha James

250
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,842
and I'm here
with Mr. Cluck Cluck

251
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,879
and my new
best friend Wafoofi

252
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,210
and we're part of a kick-ass
humanitarian effort

253
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,944
to help promote vegetarianism
in third world countries,

254
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,679
which is really really
important.

255
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,722
Okay, and speaking of
really really important...

256
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,350
I have some good news.

257
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,154
I've been recording
for my new album

258
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,252
which I hope to have out
early next...

259
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,495
- I want that album.
- Hah! What?!

260
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,966
- Samantha James?
- Yeah.

261
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,060
No no no no. Listen to me
very carefully now.

262
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,367
Samantha James
is a crazy person.

263
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,532
Hey, you're the one that
used to diddle her, not me.

264
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,668
It was one date!
And I ended up in the hospital.

265
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,236
Have you seen this poster?
Huh? Have you seen...

266
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,077
- this poster?
- Yeah, with the fruit.

267
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,811
This is the hottest-selling
poster in the United States.

268
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,876
People love her.
They love her!

269
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,819
Oh, who loves her?

270
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,380
MTV just got her a new
reality show next year.

271
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,950
We time the CD release with the show,
we got a guaranteed hit

272
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,462
plus free promotion.

273
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,055
- She's recording over...
- I know where she's recording.

274
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,330
Good. Good.
Make me happy.

275
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,132
Go away.
Wait. Not you.

276
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,036
Wait!

277
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,075
You don't make me happy, I'm gonna
find somebody else to make me happy.

278
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,543
Loud and clear. Yeah.
Clear as a bell.

279
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,544
- Good.
- Okay.

280
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,080
What are you
still doing here?

281
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,342
Go!
Go get me lobster!

282
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,077
Go! Run! Lobster!

283
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,119
Run away! Run!
Daddy want a fish!

284
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,355
* Uh, uh, uh *

285
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:24,624
* Yeah, uh uh,
eins zwei drei vier! *

286
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,393
* We might be
a world apart *

287
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,593
* World apart *

288
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,568
* But you're always
in my heart *

289
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,628
* Always in my heart *

290
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,573
- * When you look up at the stars *
- * Look up at the stars *

291
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,805
- * Feel my love from afar *
- * Afar afar *

292
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,679
- * Looking down like a shining star *
- * Shining star *

293
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,412
- * Dancing free with my guitar *
- * My guitar *

294
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,853
- * I don't know just where you are *
- * Where are you? *

295
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,914
* Love from afar,
love from afar *

296
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:57,292
* Feel my love... *

297
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,766
Cut! Cut!

298
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,295
Okay, Ron, which jokester
changed the key on me?

299
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,067
No one, Samantha.

300
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,574
It's been the same key
for the last 43 takes.

301
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,204
Well, something's off then,
because I'm just not feeling it, okay?

302
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,077
God, I need my guitar.

303
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,810
- We need to mix the tracks separately.
- No!

304
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:23,253
My lyrics say "dancing free
with my guitar," Ron.

305
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,483
So, I'm gonna
be real, okay?

306
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,923
I'm not gonna let you
and Hong Kong Phooey up there

307
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,588
turn me into some poppy
bubblegum wannabe.

308
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,632
Okay?
I need to transcend!

309
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,599
Are you guys
even listening to me?

310
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,068
* You guys are assholes,
you're assholes... *

311
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,264
- Switch it off, guys.
- * Ron, you're an asshole *

312
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,502
* You guys are assholes,
You're assholes. *

313
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,440
She's all yours.

314
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,775
Chris!

315
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,245
Hey!

316
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,687
I can't hear you, Samantha.
I can't hear you, Samantha.

317
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,816
- Can't hear you.
- Oh.

318
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:03,760
Oh, light bulb.
There you go.

319
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,992
Oh my God,
I don't believe it!

320
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,161
God, I've missed you.

321
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,204
Oh... okay.

322
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,909
Wait a minute. Are you here
because you miss me,

323
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,777
or are you just here because your
boss wants to sign me?

324
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,474
Both?

325
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,350
That's cool.
Guess I missed you too.

326
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,581
God, I want to lick
your skin off!

327
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,717
- I prefer you didn't.
- But I want to.

328
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,159
Don't.

329
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,364
Ow!

330
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,026
Ooh, you're gonna get it.
You're gonna get it, baby.

331
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,435
- I don't want it.
- Bad kitty. Meow, meow.

332
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,598
- Okay.
- Oh! Listen, what're you doing

333
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,040
- over the holidays?
- I'm going to Santa Barbara...

334
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,338
'Cause Paris is throwing
a Christmas bash in Paris.

335
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,878
Okay, Paris isn't
gonna work for...

336
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,005
I'm gonna call my assistant
and we're gonna go tonight.

337
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,413
We can work and play.
Mreow.

338
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,782
Oh my God! I just wrote a new song.
You have to hear it!

339
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,219
This one's called
"Forgiveness."

340
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,589
Ahem.

341
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,200
* Forgiveness *

342
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,862
* Forgiveness *

343
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,030
* Is more than
saying sorry *

344
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,408
* To forgive is divine *

345
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,540
* So let's have
a glass of wine *

346
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,381
* And have makeup sex *

347
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,920
* Until the end of *

348
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,048
* Time time time time *

349
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:42,992
* Time *

350
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,791
* Time. *

351
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,896
So what did you
you think?

352
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,060
Ah!

353
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,832
I mean, my God!

354
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,999
Oh my God,
you're sweet.

355
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,834
- What is that?
- This is a taser gun.

356
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,312
My publicist gave it to me
to ward off stalkers.

357
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,611
Bam!
Ha ha ha!

358
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,119
Ooh, ahi tuna.

359
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,985
- You want some? Yummy yummy.
- I'll pass.

360
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,388
Ahi!

361
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,223
Oh, I'm so glad
KC got us back together.

362
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,058
Yeah, you're awful.

363
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,690
Hey, I have a great idea.

364
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,030
What if on our way to Paris
we stop off in Ireland

365
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,933
and find out
where U2 lives?

366
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,870
What if we got someone
like Bono to sing backup?

367
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,999
I'd be all...
* Forgiveness is the way, *

368
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,272
and he'd go, * Forgiveness every day *
only all Bono-y.

369
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,336
Wouldn't that
be amazing?

370
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,212
Ah! What if I added
more vibrato?

371
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,252
* Forgiveness *

372
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,116
* Is more than
sayin' sorry *

373
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,793
* To forgive is divine *

374
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,959
* So let's have
a glass of... *

375
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,933
Okay. Who's the genius
behind this?

376
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,304
The container said
"microwavable."

377
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,899
But the aluminum
foil wasn't.

378
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,502
Well, I'm not supposed to worry
about stuff like that.

379
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,012
I'm the talent.

380
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,413
Daddy, we're down.

381
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,417
Not exactly warm
out here, is it?

382
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,477
- How long till we're airborne again?
- Nice plane!

383
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,149
- Not till tomorrow.
- Ah, terrific. Where are we?

384
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,816
Not happy!

385
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,657
We're on a private field
an hour outside of Trenton.

386
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,664
Jersey?
We're in New Jersey?

387
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,701
Hey, wait a minute.
Am I being Punk'd?

388
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,668
Where's Ashton?
Ha!

389
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,704
Ashton!

390
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,705
Oh my God!
Ha ha.

391
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,707
You totally got me!

392
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,538
Ashton?

393
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,239
I love it that you're taking me home
to meet your mom.

394
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,249
Was this one of your
clever little plans?

395
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,581
Yes. I planned you
setting the plane on fire.

396
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,621
Surprise!

397
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,224
Ow!

398
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,855
Oh, my little boy.

399
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,535
Be right down.

400
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,412
* La da da, da da *

401
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,722
* La da da da *

402
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,526
* La da da, da da *

403
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,534
* La da da da *

404
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,231
* La da da, da da *

405
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,173
* Da da da da. *

406
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,482
I do not remember
Jersey being this cold.

407
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,953
Well, it's been uncommonly
cold this month.

408
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,321
We've gone through
seven bags of rock salt.

409
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,053
Your house is just
so quaint, Mrs. Brander,

410
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,618
I mean, Chris, you never told me
you were so provincial.

411
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,960
It's like a true
rags to riches story,

412
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,626
but I've always found the middle class to
be just so much more real.

413
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,400
I mean, isn't Chris great?

414
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,406
Yeah, he is a nice boy.

415
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,773
You know, he usually
flies us out to Los Angeles.

416
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,778
It's been, uh...

417
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,144
oh, nine, 10...

418
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,308
- It's 10 years. Yeah.
- 10?

419
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,716
10 years
since he's been home.

420
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,311
- All right. Good job, Dougie.
- Oh, hi, honey!

421
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,053
Oh my God.

422
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,119
- Mikey.
- Oh my God!

423
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,928
- Is that my Christmas present?
- Sam, my younger brother Mike.

424
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,663
- Samantha James.
- Samantha James.

425
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,001
Mike Brander.
It is an honor.

426
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,371
I have your poster
on my wall,

427
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,775
- but you are way hotter in person.
- I know!

428
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,313
- You have her poster on your wall?
- Yeah.

429
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,440
I slapped the ham
to it like an hour ago.

430
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,485
What ham did you slap?

431
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,077
Not the ham
that I just bought?

432
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,215
Oh, Mrs. Brander, do you have
anything else besides ham?

433
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,986
Because I'm on
the Perricone diet

434
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,891
and I need salmon
like now.

435
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,453
I love salmon. It's the prettiest
color for bedrooms.

436
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,524
- So relaxing.
- I'm gonna start drinking.

437
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,660
Um, does anybody want anything?
Some coffee?

438
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,329
Maybe some salmon
or something?

439
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,339
Just gonna...

440
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,999
yeah.

441
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,839
Mike! Good to be home.

442
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,682
Oh, boy. Okay.

443
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:41,214
Hi. Yes, I know,
very exciting.

444
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,887
Hi. Hi.

445
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,896
Oh. Chris,
let's get it to go.

446
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,057
People are staring at me.

447
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,502
Oh my God...
plastic menus!

448
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,300
Well, this isn't gonna work,
is it now, Chris?

449
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,340
Chris?

450
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,411
Excuse me, but I was
wondering if you think

451
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,538
America will ever switch
to the metric system?

452
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,411
Well, that's
a very interesting...

453
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,544
- Oh my God! Chris!
- I don't believe this!

454
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,818
- Oh! God, you look great!
- I don't... you look great!

455
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,416
- Well, thank you! How you been?
- We're married.

456
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,553
- You're married!
- Married?

457
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,189
- Oh, yeah, we're married, we got a kid. TJ.
- We have a son. TJ.

458
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,392
- TJ!
- He looks like me. He's got Clark's eyes...

459
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,435
Oh my God!
Where does the time go?

460
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,063
He's like the creative mind kid, he's like,
brilliant and you can meet him.

461
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,699
- That's great!
- God, look at those teeth!

462
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,640
Those are some nice veneers
you got, my friend.

463
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,678
- Don't tell me that you're a dentist.
- A dentist?

464
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,476
- I totally sold out, dude.
- Hey, you and me both, buddy.

465
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,313
Hey, lover, aren't you
gonna introduce me, huh?

466
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,977
Yes!

467
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,782
Samantha, these are
my old friends.

468
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,016
This is Clark,
this is Darla.

469
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,117
Your names are
"Clark" and "Darla"?

470
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,320
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

471
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,091
Oh my God,
that is so cute!

472
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,258
I just wanna
eat you both up!

473
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,937
Okay, I am gonna go
to the little girl's room.

474
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,905
- Good.
- And then we're outie.

475
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,703
- Okay.
- Okay.

476
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,677
She's... uh, incoming.

477
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,543
Oh my God.

478
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,048
Check out that
girl's ass. Huge!

479
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,477
It was so nice
meeting you.

480
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,747
Mm. Darla.

481
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,656
She's adorable.

482
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,961
- And affectionate.
- Christ sakes.

483
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:32,060
- Chris Brander, ladies and gentlemen!
- Yes! You guys, so good...

484
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,469
Chris Brander?
Chris Brander?

485
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,063
Holy...

486
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,872
I saw you at the Grammys
sitting next to P. Diddy!

487
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,607
It's me Tim.
You remember?

488
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,012
Oh, how could I
forget you, Tim?

489
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,016
Hey, you got $5

490
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,211
that I can,
like, have?

491
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,222
Yeah.

492
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,018
You keep
living the dream, Tim.

493
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:53,989
Done!

494
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,151
Buh-bye now.

495
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,196
- Class of '95!
- Class of '95!

496
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,992
Here's your money,
bitch!

497
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,295
- He looks good.
- Man, I can't believe...

498
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,528
wha... like what happened?
Where did you go?

499
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,436
Hey, you know...
just migrated west.

500
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,097
You know, I'm living
the dream out there, I guess.

501
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,234
I just stayed with my dad
for awhile, and...

502
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,677
yeah, hocked my soul
for a record executive job...

503
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,841
and started...
I mean I had an internship first

504
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,350
- a couple of years.
- Uh-huh, right.

505
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,187
Jamie.

506
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,694
Jamie?

507
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,691
- Chris, hi!
- Hi!

508
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,667
What are you
doing down there?

509
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,603
Oh, I'm just busted!

510
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:44,267
How are you?
Oh, shit. Hold on.

511
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,244
Wow!

512
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,041
Look at you!

513
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,741
Oh my God,

514
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,147
I can put my
arms around you.

515
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,581
- You look so great! Look at this body!
- Thank you.

516
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,385
- You're like a new man!
- Yeah.

517
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,426
These arms
and your belly,

518
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,485
and look at...
pecs, and...

519
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,123
Wow! Chris Brander.

520
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,099
God.
Jamie Palamino.

521
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,071
So, um... so how long
are you in town for?

522
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,268
Um, just the night,
actually.

523
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,607
Just one night, really?
You can't stay any longer?

524
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,842
No. I wish I could, but l...

525
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,883
Let's go, Chris.
There's pee on the floor.

526
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,111
- Yeah.
- Okay, um...

527
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,818
all right, well...

528
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,454
- it's really great to see you again.
- You too.

529
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,055
Oh.

530
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,622
Wow...

531
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,669
Just give me
a call sometime.

532
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,764
I'm living
with my parents.

533
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,742
Oh, I know.
I'm living with my parents.

534
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,874
Okay, bye.

535
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,116
- Bye.
- Bye.

536
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,680
- Jamie Pal.
- Whoa!

537
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,189
She's like a box
of fine wine.

538
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,953
You would know.

539
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,689
You know, in high school
you'd never get a girl like that.

540
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,731
And now you get
whoever you want.

541
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,496
I bet you could
definitely hit Jamie Pal.

542
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,038
- Definitely.
- Okay. Okay.

543
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,672
- Excuse me.
- Oh yeah.

544
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,976
You go! Whoo!

545
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,278
- Hey!
- Hey!

546
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,649
Look, there is a chance that my
flight might be delayed an extra day.

547
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,188
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Um, nothing.

548
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,952
- Do you want to meet for lunch?
- You mean like a day date?

549
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,960
Yeah.

550
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,495
Great!

551
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,496
Chris! Chris!

552
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,032
- I'll pick you up at noon.
- Chris! Chris!

553
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,263
- Chris! Chris! Chris!
- Awesome, I'm really...

554
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,568
- I'm busy!
- I'm busy! Stupid dick!

555
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,404
- That sounds awesome. I'll see you then.
- Bye.

556
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,577
Let's go.

557
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,916
- What was that all about?
- Nothing.

558
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,576
It's just an old
friend saying hi.

559
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,586
Yeah, well, let's
keep it that way.

560
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,555
- It's not a handball.
- My handball.

561
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,058
Meow. Meow.

562
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:28,163
* I used to know you
when we were young *

563
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,640
* You were
in all my dreams *

564
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,340
* We sat together
in period one *

565
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,383
* Fridays at 8:15... *

566
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:43,410
- Whoa.
- * But I will wait for you *

567
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:47,857
* As long as I need to *

568
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:52,420
* And if you ever get
back to Hackensack *

569
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:58,231
* I'll be here for you. *

570
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:09,070
* Jesus Christ our savior
was born upon this day *

571
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,082
* To save us all
from Satan's power *

572
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,778
* When we were
gone astray *

573
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,320
* Oh, tidings... *

574
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,786
Hey! Dumb-ass.

575
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,017
Wake up.

576
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,025
- Hey, wake up.
- Ah! Agh!

577
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,617
Morning.

578
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,663
Ow ow!

579
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,188
Agh! What?

580
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,893
I need you to
do me a favor.

581
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,902
What do you
want from me?!

582
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,665
I ran into Jamie Palomino
last night.

583
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,729
Oh, here we go again.

584
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,071
I'm not the same person
I was in high-school, pal.

585
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,804
You'll always be fat
to me, Chris.

586
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,108
What do you want from me?!

587
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,648
I need you
to detain Samantha.

588
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,274
I could do that.

589
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,917
- Chris, wait!
- It's a beautiful day.

590
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,047
What about Paris?

591
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,887
Look, Paris can wait. This is important.
You don't wanna be

592
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,018
- out of touch with your audience, do you?
- No.

593
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,995
No, well then, you need
to connect with your audience,

594
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,394
you need to feed off their energy.

595
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,865
After all, they're the ones who're
gonna be buying your album.

596
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,868
The problem is where
in New Jersey are we gonna find

597
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,063
a proper cross-section
of your fans?

598
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,532
- The mall?
- A mall!

599
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,132
That's a great idea!

600
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,611
- We have so much in common!
- I know!

601
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,614
- God.
- Let's do it to it!

602
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,445
Whoa! I am not
going with him!

603
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:22,611
Look, what better way to relate
to your fans than to go with one?

604
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,655
In we go.

605
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,156
Hey! You're not
coming with me?

606
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,591
- Hmm-mm.
- No, sweetie. You need to do this alone.

607
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,322
- I can't be your crutch.
- But l...

608
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,829
Watch your face!

609
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,728
Buckle up!

610
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,840
Great.
That's good.

611
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,465
That's looking good.

612
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,080
Great, guys.
Really good.

613
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,516
Mr. Palamino,
how you doing?

614
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,418
Well well well,

615
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,651
if it isn't
Mr. Valentine's Day!

616
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:04,058
This guy, every Valentine's Day,
he'd buy Jamie like a dozen roses.

617
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,926
Used to drive all
her boyfriends nuts!

618
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,899
Ha! Till we explained, of course,
it was just her little friend Chris.

619
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,936
Yeah,
I remember that.

620
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,369
You prick.

621
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,340
I see you still have the best
Christmas display in town, sir.

622
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,569
- Hey! In the state!
- Hey, Chris!

623
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,271
I'll be right out.

624
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,179
So, uh, how'd you
lose all that weight?

625
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,843
Like that retard
from Subway?

626
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,351
It was great
talking to you, sir.

627
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,722
Are you kidding me?

628
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,724
I rented the nicest Porsche
in New Jersey.

629
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,521
I'm just gonna play
this whole thing aloof

630
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,926
and she's gonna be eating out
of the palm of my hand in no time.

631
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,090
Gotta go.

632
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,928
Hey.

633
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,459
Wow! Porsche.
Girls must love this.

634
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,165
I hate this stupid thing too.
It's a rental.

635
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,175
So ostentatious.
It's all they had left.

636
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,211
Hmm.

637
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,474
- God, this place hasn't changed a bit.
- I know.

638
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,542
Are you sure that you don't want
to go someplace else?

639
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,748
- No, we can't leave. We have history here.
- History.

640
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,691
Oh my goodness,
I remember you two.

641
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,889
Oh, you're not
a chubby bunny anymore.

642
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,990
- Oh, my personal space.
- I'll be right back.

643
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,968
I've got a little
surprise for you.

644
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,301
Can't wait.

645
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,839
Haha!
Chubby bunny!

646
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,671
Ahh! Thanks for
reminding me I was fat.

647
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,671
So why did you disappear
on me 10 years ago?

648
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,145
Uh, listen, about that...

649
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,775
Where you
that mad at me?

650
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,151
Come on, Jamie. It was like
100 years ago, all right?

651
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,588
I'm not that pathetic
little dweeb anymore.

652
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:44,321
You were never
a dweeb, Chris.

653
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,364
- So, tell me about your job.
- Oh my God.

654
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,764
You know, once you get over
all the glamour, you know, it's uh...

655
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,597
- it's nothing but total insanity.
- Mm.

656
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,229
You know, if it's not Pink calling you, then
you got Good Charlotte...

657
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,604
it's Jay Z's birthday party, you know, and
I'm totally name-dropping right now

658
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,200
and I'd really like to stop.
Mick Jagger. How 'bout you?

659
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,940
You know, what happened to you?
How'd you end up working at The Maple?

660
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,879
I don't work
at The Maple.

661
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,474
I mean, I work at The Maple
but I don't really work at The Maple.

662
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,144
- Yeah.
- I'm studying to be a teacher

663
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,710
so I'm living at home
and I'm working...

664
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,052
It's the coast.
Be right back.

665
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,287
What happened to him?

666
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,961
* Five golden rings *

667
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,899
- * Four calling birds *
- I don't care what your mommy said.

668
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,095
* Three French hens,
two turtle doves *

669
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,660
Oh, this is gonna be a great song.
"Mall People."

670
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,764
"Mall people,
they come and go...

671
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,809
small people,
they just don't know."

672
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,436
- How's it goin'?
- Fantastic.

673
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,979
- How's it going with Jamie?
- Treating her like

674
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,379
- every boyfriend she's ever had.
- You da man!

675
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,781
- So I wanna run an idea by you.
- No.

676
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,185
Since you're trying to hook up with Jamie,
what if I went to Paris with Samantha

677
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,950
- instead of you? That way you...
- No.

678
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,582
- You haven't heard the whole thing yet!
- No.

679
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,922
You know what, just... just think
about it and get back to me.

680
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,655
Ow!

681
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,199
- Oh my God!
- I gotta go.

682
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,840
- So, how's the coast?
- Super.

683
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,208
Here we go!

684
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,907
One grilled cheese
with ranch on the side

685
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:15,180
and one Sugar Mountain Supreme
for the chubby bunny.

686
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,813
Excuse me, um,

687
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,050
this-this... this isn't
gonna work for me.

688
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,718
But this is what
you always order.

689
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,729
Yeah. 10 years ago,
when I was a whale.

690
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,561
The pancakes are fine.
He's just kidding.

691
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,225
What?

692
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,895
- Be more rude!
- She's rude! She's rude!

693
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,304
I haven't had sweets
in 10 years, okay? Do you know

694
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,809
- what this would do to my stomach?
- Relax, little girl.

695
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,869
I'll have the pancakes and you
can have my sandwich, okay?

696
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,482
I'll just enjoy
this glass of water.

697
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,050
I'm stuffed.

698
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,028
Good times.
Good times!

699
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,565
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

700
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,623
- Thanks again for lunch.
- Oh, I'll get your door.

701
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,726
Oh. Okay.

702
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,236
Shit.

703
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,445
- Whew!
- Yeah.

704
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,180
Well, it was great
seeing you again.

705
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,683
You too.

706
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,150
Yeah, glad I ran
into you last night.

707
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,154
Yeah, it was
a surprise.

708
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,156
Big surprise.
Yeah.

709
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,816
It's cold out here.

710
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,826
Yeah, it is.
It's like the South Pole.

711
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,658
It's like the deep South Pole
if there was one.

712
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,459
There isn't, though.

713
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,193
Um, thanks for walking
me to my door.

714
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,100
Yeah. Again, it was
great seeing you...

715
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,137
again.

716
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,967
- You, too.
- Yeah.

717
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,337
Take care. Uh...

718
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,638
Yeah, you too.
Oh, uh...

719
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,976
- Oh.
- That's good.

720
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,414
Ow!

721
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:57,184
- Take care.
- You too.

722
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,515
Hmm.

723
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,877
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid!

724
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,814
What the hell?!

725
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,788
God!

726
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,090
Oh my God!

727
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,790
It's the South Pole!
It's the deep South Pole?

728
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,856
It's the South Pole.
The deep South Pole!

729
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,959
I don't think there is one,
but if there was one

730
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,095
I bet it would be
in the south!

731
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,574
- I left my gloves in the car.
- Oh.

732
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,757
- There you go.
- Thanks.

733
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,801
Hey, look who's here!
What's up, Hollywood?

734
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,533
- How the big date go?
- It was terrible.

735
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,940
I went in for a kiss,
but she wants a hug, okay?

736
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,570
Then I get caught in a sort
of kiss-hug limbo type thing.

737
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:32,514
I don't know what that is, then I
ended up shaking her entire body.

738
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,245
So y-you gave her
a body shake?

739
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,777
Oh, God! I should've just kissed her!
What am I doing?

740
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,347
It looks like you picked up right
where you left off.

741
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,983
You're back
in the friend zone.

742
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,518
Oh, f-f...

743
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,145
What?

744
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,942
Little problem.

745
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,944
Okay, she's got
a bit of a headache.

746
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,145
It's not that bad. Ha!

747
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,046
Oh my God!

748
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,523
What the hell
happened to her?

749
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,958
Long story short,
she fell.

750
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,859
Samantha, are you okay?

751
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,590
I'm gonna make bubble.

752
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,428
Dude, she's fine!

753
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,298
Look at her. She's having a good time.
She's got her toothpaste.

754
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,270
All you had to do was watch her for a few
hours. What did you do to her?

755
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,103
Nothing! She's just all
loopy from all the Vicodin.

756
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,336
Where did you
get the Vicodin?

757
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,379
Mom.

758
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,243
Blueberry!

759
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,681
Okay.
I'm gonna kill you.

760
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,479
What?!
You said detain her!

761
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,577
- You're a dead man, Mike!
- She's detained!

762
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,917
Eww.

763
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,458
- My balls!
- Oh.

764
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,926
You're dead.

765
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,931
No, Chris! No!

766
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,933
Chris...

767
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,730
Chris, no!

768
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,996
- My boss! Truce!
- Truce!

769
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,700
- Truce!
- Okay.

770
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:04,763
- Hello?
- Nyah!

771
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,707
Hey, Chrissy!

772
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,711
How's my future star doing?

773
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,406
Great.
She's doing great, sir.

774
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,711
So let me... let me...
let me say hi to her.

775
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,978
Uh, she's a little incapacitated
at the moment.

776
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:18,146
Oh, a little incapacitated,
that's my baby, that's my boy!

777
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:22,022
Look, when you two get back, I've got this
incredible marketing campaign

778
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,721
lined up for the spring quarter.
Our number one priority:

779
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:28,060
- Samantha James!
- Awesome.

780
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,862
Three two, one!

781
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,870
Ho-ho-ho.

782
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:37,237
- Yeah-ha-ha! Yeah!
- Merry Christmas!

783
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,401
It's a Palamino Christmas!

784
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,445
Again!

785
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,149
- Hello?
- Jamie.

786
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,412
- Hey.
- What's up?

787
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,387
Listen, you're never gonna believe this,
but I can't get a flight out.

788
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,719
- I'm stuck here another day.
- Oh.

789
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,281
I want to apologize
for earlier.

790
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,849
- Let me make it up to you.
- I taste good.

791
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,895
Do you want to go
ice skating?

792
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,454
- I thought you hated ice skating.
- I used to,

793
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,433
but you know, I'm actually
pretty damn good now.

794
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,764
I'm the MVP
in my league, in fact.

795
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:08,031
Come on, it'll be
like old times.

796
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,508
- Hello, Joyce?
- Mom? I'm on the phone.

797
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,273
Oh! Well, Chris, what are you
doing over at Joyce's?

798
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,180
No, Mom. I'm in the living room,
10 feet away from you

799
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,081
- and I'm on the phone.
- Oh.

800
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,551
Well, you know,
I was wondering

801
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,350
while I have you on the phone,
what would you like for dinner?

802
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:29,120
We-we have a choice between chicken
chow mein or pot roast.

803
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,252
Mom. Please.

804
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,387
Mom!

805
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,058
- Mom!
- What is it, peanut?

806
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,293
Where are my ice skates?

807
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,064
Oh, honey, I gave
those away years ago.

808
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,071
Are you serious?
I need them.

809
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,267
Well, honey, why would I keep them?
You're never here.

810
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,867
Besides, you-you weren't
terribly good at ice skating.

811
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,879
Well, I'm good now!

812
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,313
And I need my skates
to show off my talents.

813
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,841
Oh, well, honey,
I'm sure you can rent a pair.

814
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,480
Besides, you don't have
to show off for Jamie.

815
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,047
Just...
just be yourself.

816
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,923
* Be yourself *

817
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:08,795
* Be yourself,
be yourself. *

818
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,302
Now, come on! Mikey and I are
making snow angels!

819
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,872
I don't want
to be myself.

820
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,970
My snow globe collection.

821
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:30,117
* Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way *

822
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,121
* Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh... *

823
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,987
- Oof! Stupid rental skates.
- Ooh!

824
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,892
You know what?
You're a lot better than before.

825
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,863
- I'm wearing figure skates from the '30s.
- Here, let me help you.

826
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,796
Okay, I can do it myself, okay?
I'm good. I'm good now.

827
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,199
Hey.

828
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,800
- So...
- So...

829
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,934
- How's the love life?
- Lame.

830
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,741
- Marty and I broke up a year ago.
- Ooh, another jerk, huh?

831
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,839
- "Another jerk, huh?"
- I'm kidding...

832
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,850
I'm just saying you
dated a lot of jerks

833
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,818
back in high school,
that's all.

834
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,584
So how about you? You in love
with anyone besides yourself?

835
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,785
No.

836
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,658
I've really just
been dating, you know?

837
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,994
Just trying to look
for my soulmate.

838
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,225
You didn't buy that,
did you?

839
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,461
Maybe you
should try harder.

840
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,733
Or I could try this.

841
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,397
Oh...

842
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,774
Hey guys,
it's Miss Palamino!

843
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,837
Yay!

844
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,974
Hi, guys.

845
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,917
Sarah and Joey
and Brett. Hi!

846
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,819
- What, you... you know these kids?
- Yeah, I substitute teach

847
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,585
- their class.
- Hey, um, we're having a pickup game.

848
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,219
We could use some more bodies.
You guys play?

849
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,889
You know Chris is a great player,
but he has rentals.

850
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,365
- A good skater can skate in anything.
- Yeah!

851
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,265
I'm in.

852
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:58,103
Okay, guys. Keep it clean.

853
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,335
- Oof!
- Shoot it!

854
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,038
Get it in!
And goal!

855
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,175
- What was that?!
- You're pathetic!

856
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,151
I'm sorry, okay?

857
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,449
It's just these damn
rental skates.

858
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,616
It's fine. Just don't cuss in front
of the children.

859
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,421
Potty mouth.

860
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,624
Get him, Terry!

861
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,030
Ow!

862
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,159
He hacked me!

863
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,896
Wanna fight, punk?

864
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:29,439
- What, are you kidding me?
- Fight!

865
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,066
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

866
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:35,305
All right, all right,
break it up, break it up.

867
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:38,143
What is your problem?
She's just a child.

868
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,615
- That's a girl?
- Pussy!

869
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:49,622
- Yeah!
- All right!

870
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,095
Okay, listen. We're getting
creamed out there.

871
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,634
- It's his fault.
- You suck, Brander.

872
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,000
- Hey.
- I brand you "Suckster."

873
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,868
- Oh my... that's enough.
- Hey.

874
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,431
Now Chris is trying
his best here.

875
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,103
Sorry, Miss Palamino,
but he's just so terrible.

876
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,375
- I'm not terrible.
- Suckster! Suckster! Suckster! Suckster!

877
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,780
- Maybe you should call it a day.
- No, I can do this!

878
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,285
- Suckster! Suckster. Suckster! Suckster...
- Hey!

879
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,116
I'm a really good skater,
little girl!

880
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:21,646
Watch! You might
learn something!

881
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,420
I'm taking this one.

882
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,798
Me?

883
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,172
Ah!

884
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,971
Chris, no!

885
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,175
Ahh!

886
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:55,191
No!

887
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,522
No slap shots!

888
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,106
Suckster! Suckster!

889
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:16,203
Suckster! Suckster!
Suckster!

890
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,373
Suckster! Suckster!

891
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:22,044
- What a schmuck.
- Don't worry, Chris. You're gonna be fine.

892
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,280
Oh...

893
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,551
- Wow.
- Well, it looks like I was

894
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:34,324
- in the right place at the right time, Miss...
- Yeah.

895
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,299
Palamino?
Jamie Palamino.

896
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:40,097
- Dusty Dinkleman?
- Ah, yeah.

897
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,695
Actually, I go by
"Dusty Lee" now, but yeah.

898
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,435
- "Dutty Nee?"
- Thanks for saving me.

899
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,977
Yay, Dusty!

900
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:50,206
- You remember Chris Brander?
- Eeh.

901
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,612
- Boo...
- Oh, yeah.

902
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,243
Seen better days, I guess, huh, pal?

903
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,617
Hey, listen, I don't
want to make this weird,

904
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,588
but you look incredible.

905
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,523
- So do you.
- Really glad you dropped in.

906
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,819
Ow!

907
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,536
Cool...

908
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,804
Sorry about that, buddy.

909
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:20,707
Here we go.

910
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,737
Late '20s.
Male Caucasian

911
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,978
with multiple lacerations on lower
mandible and possible concussion.

912
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,712
Transport en route,
over.

913
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,846
- 104.
- So, uh, Jamie,

914
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,618
- you still living in town?
- Oh, yeah, I just moved back.

915
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,625
Oh, really?
Me too.

916
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,059
- It's a small world.
- No kidding.

917
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,391
Jeez, you know,

918
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,297
I cannot get over
how great you look.

919
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,961
Oh, pfft. Me?
Look at you!

920
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,231
Yeah, I guess
my skin cleared up

921
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,966
and I lost my stammer,

922
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,167
but I still play
a mean guitar.

923
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,642
I'm actually only doing this part-time
till I can make it in music.

924
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:57,908
You know, Chris is in the music business
too. He could probably help you.

925
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,745
Oh, hey.
Easy there, Gretzky.

926
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,150
Shh.

927
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,781
You know, we should hang out,
you know, have lunch sometime?

928
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,623
I would love
to have lunch.

929
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:12,389
Um, where can I give you
my phone number?

930
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,986
Just write it on this.

931
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,930
Jamie Palamino.

932
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,596
This is bullshit!

933
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,334
You haven't aged a peep.

934
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,943
What do you know
about Dusty Dinkleman?

935
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,346
- You mean Dusty Lee?
- Yeah.

936
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,385
Works in the building,
drives ambulance. Why?

937
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,979
Well check this out.
So I'm out with Jamie again...

938
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,717
Another day date?

939
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,259
Yes. Anyway,

940
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,954
we're having
a great time

941
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,326
and then Dusty shows up
out of nowhere,

942
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,831
and then Jamie
gives him her number.

943
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,267
Hey, didn't Dusty have like
a huge crush on Jamie?

944
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,737
- Uh...
- Yeah, you got some

945
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,104
competition there, Chris.
I mean, Dusty is a really nice guy.

946
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,666
Yeah, well Jamie
doesn't date nice guys.

947
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,336
She puts them in
the friend zone

948
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,277
and then tortures
the shit out of them.

949
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,782
I don't know. Jamie's come
a long way since high school.

950
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,444
I think she
might be maturing.

951
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,043
Maturing?

952
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,691
So that's why
she went with Dusty.

953
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,623
She wants
a sensitive guy...

954
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,627
more like the old me.

955
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,458
Well, if she wants
Mr. Rogers,

956
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,464
then I'm going
to show her

957
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,397
the biggest pussy
she's ever seen.

958
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,333
Yeah.

959
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,598
Okay, we're done.
Now, uh...

960
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,106
you're gonna need to wear this
for the next few days

961
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:34,166
until those stitches
are ready to come out.

962
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,940
And here you go. Huh?
Just like your old yearbook picture.

963
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,142
* Feel my love from afar. *

964
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,346
Come in!

965
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,117
- Can I come in?
- I just said that.

966
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,452
I brought magazines.

967
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,496
Ugh, these are old.

968
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:56,691
- Flowers?
- Those are daisies.

969
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,998
- How about snacks?
- Carbs? Are you kidding me?

970
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,503
I can't eat that crap.

971
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,766
I'm just trying
to be helpful.

972
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,503
Well you're not.
So vamoose.

973
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,910
- I guess I'll just leave you now.
- No, wait wait.

974
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,506
I'm sorry I'm being
such a biatch.

975
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,074
It's just that I'm supposed
to be in Paris and I'm not,

976
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:19,213
and I'm going out of my mind
with boredom!

977
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,190
I mean, my Sidekick
broke and l...

978
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:26,423
I haven't had sex
in, like, forever.

979
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,088
And I'm so horny.

980
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:31,157
I'm horny.

981
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,600
Wait a minute.

982
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,740
- How old are you?
- I'm 22... 20... 19...

983
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,674
I'm... I'm 18.

984
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,644
Eighteen.

985
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:48,274
So do you really have
my poster on your wall?

986
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:51,810
- Yeah.
- Do you ever like...

987
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,822
All the time.

988
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,619
How many times in a day?

989
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:58,320
- Eight.
- Eight?!

990
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,860
Eight? Oh my God,
that's hot.

991
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:08,371
- You're hot.
- I know, I know.

992
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,007
- Oh, ow.
- Are you okay?

993
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,136
Oh, my back
is killing me.

994
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,681
Oh, I could
give you a massage.

995
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,047
Oh, would you mind?

996
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,053
Not at all.

997
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:27,682
- Oopsie, I'm naked.
- You're naked.

998
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,817
Do you have any oil?

999
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:32,418
Right back.

1000
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,533
What took you
so long?

1001
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,230
- Show me what you've got, baby.
- Okay.

1002
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,241
Baby, ooh!

1003
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,209
Ooh, more more!

1004
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,339
- Okay, enough. Enough!
- Okay.

1005
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:54,884
Oh, yeah.

1006
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,220
Hey hey.
Merry Christmas, neighbor.

1007
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,524
Gee... hey!

1008
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,531
- Ooh, yeah.
- Mikey likey,

1009
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,194
- Mikey likey, Mikey likey, Mikey likey...
- Yeah...

1010
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,029
Oh! Where the hell
have you been?!

1011
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,870
I was getting you food.

1012
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,172
- Are you wearing braces?
- It's not braces.

1013
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,042
It's a retainer
and it's not that bad.

1014
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:27,743
- Ha, you look like a doofus!
- Doofus!

1015
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,285
Doofus! Doofus!

1016
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,482
Doofus! Doofus!
Doof...

1017
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,820
Chris?

1018
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:40,522
Mommy.

1019
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,430
So pretty.

1020
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,628
Honey, look what
just came for you.

1021
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:49,467
It's a "Get well soon"
card from Jamie.

1022
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,301
- Boo.
- Oh yeah?

1023
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:56,868
What do you
think of that, huh?

1024
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,711
It's hugs and kisses, dude.
Mom writes that on my cards.

1025
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,048
That's because
I love you both so much.

1026
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,318
Thanks, Mommy.

1027
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,924
Oh, God.

1028
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,575
Truce!

1029
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,702
Total pussy.

1030
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,714
You're the biggest pussy
on planet Earth.

1031
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,875
It's you.

1032
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,752
- Hello?
- Jamie!

1033
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,918
- Chris! How are you feeling?
- So much better.

1034
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,655
Listen, I know
it's Christmas Eve,

1035
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,789
- but do you have any plans tonight?
- No.

1036
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,662
Well...

1037
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,668
the revival theater
in town

1038
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,727
is showing Nicholas Sparks's
"The Notebook."

1039
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,863
Huh?

1040
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,909
- Hello? I'm on the phone.
- Really you want to see "The Notebook"?

1041
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:02,274
Yes, because I love
sentimental tear-jerkers.

1042
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,245
I'm gonna friggin' puke.

1043
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,111
Just a second.

1044
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,345
- You are so dead. Do you hear me?
- Whatever, dude.

1045
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,550
- What're you doing over there?
- Faggot.

1046
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,354
- Nothing.
- Ooh, that's my call-waiting. One second.

1047
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:18,894
- So, anyway...
- Hello?

1048
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:21,328
- Hey, Jamie. It's Dusty.
- Hey, Dusty.

1049
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,558
Hey, listen, just...

1050
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:25,993
Dude, I think
she left you hanging.

1051
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:29,334
It's probably just an important
business call. Get off the phone.

1052
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:32,569
- What, the bar ran out of curly fries?
- Get off the phone.

1053
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,701
Dude, are you gonna
boink Jamie tonight?

1054
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,769
Yes.
Are you happy now?

1055
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,644
All right.

1056
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,708
- Dude, "The Notebook"'s so gay.
- Get off the phone!

1057
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:46,278
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

1058
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,586
- So anyway, what do you say?
- About what?

1059
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,592
Going to a movie tonight?
Then maybe later

1060
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,061
we can go for some,
uh... herbal tea.

1061
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,428
Okay, sure.

1062
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,831
Um... You know what?
You're on my way to the theater.

1063
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,392
Why don't I pick you up
at like 7:30?

1064
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,937
- It's a date.
- Homo.

1065
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,734
- Bye for now.
- Bye.

1066
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:10,642
Mom! Mom! Truce!

1067
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:16,781
- Paris, here we come!
- Mm.

1068
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:20,216
- But I'm not ready to play a gig.
- Of course you are.

1069
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,225
No. No.

1070
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,726
No!

1071
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:29,254
- This is a bad idea, Chris.
- God, I'm so stupid!

1072
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:32,665
- No you're not, baby.
- Here I am, trying to nurture this artist,

1073
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:36,729
yet you're this
pop bubblegum sensation,

1074
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,798
and that's okay.

1075
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,810
Paris, here we come!

1076
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,076
But I am an artist.
I am an artist!

1077
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,879
Hey! I am an artist!

1078
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,682
- Let's go do this.
- Are you ready for this?

1079
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:54,553
I was born ready, bitch.

1080
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,785
- I'm really excited about this.
- Yeah, me too.

1081
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,124
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do this.

1082
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:02,892
Yeah.

1083
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,094
- Hey! Wait! You're not coming with me?
- Of course I am.

1084
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,796
Mike's just giving you
a ride to the gig.

1085
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,305
I'm gonna stay here, I'm gonna do
some administrative work

1086
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,965
and I'm gonna
meet you there.

1087
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,703
It's open mic night
at The Coffee House.

1088
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:16,109
Coffee House is lame, dude.
Come on...

1089
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,703
all right!

1090
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,772
Think fast. Boop!

1091
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,874
Oh!

1092
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,016
Ow!

1093
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,023
* And I swear *

1094
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,082
- * By the moon and the stars... *
- Jesus.

1095
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,493
- * In the skies... *
- Looks like the Michael Bolton starter kit.

1096
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:36,760
* I'll be there *

1097
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,666
* And I swear *

1098
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:43,228
* Like a shadow
that's by your side. *

1099
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,331
Showtime.

1100
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,652
Come on!
How long does it...

1101
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,925
- Mistletoe.
- Hello.

1102
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,586
- Oh my God!
- Jamie! How are you?

1103
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,927
You've grown into such
a beautiful young woman,

1104
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,296
hasn't she, Chris?

1105
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,965
Ding-dong.

1106
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,940
Dusty. Hey. Why?

1107
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:22,500
Are you kidding, man?
I love "The Notebook".

1108
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,240
I mean, listen,
I know it might sound

1109
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,248
a little corny,
maybe even a little femme,

1110
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,977
but I find something
so resplendent

1111
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,815
in the simplicity of Nicholas Sparks'
writing, you know what I mean?

1112
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:34,323
Nice outfit, by the way.
Rock and roll.

1113
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,222
Carol?

1114
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,852
Oh my God.

1115
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,089
- Carol...
- Dusty, oh my goodness.

1116
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,894
- This is old-home week.
- Oh, absolutely.

1117
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:47,994
- Is it okay that Dusty came?
- Oh, it's awesome that Dusty came.

1118
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,062
Thank you.
- Okay.

1119
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,869
...in the hospital. We got...
- Dust!

1120
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:54,409
Hey, let's hit the road.

1121
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,069
Well, you kids
have fun.

1122
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,841
Oh, Carol, why don't
you come join us?

1123
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,940
She's vacuuming.

1124
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:04,350
W-well, I'd love to, but l...
I wouldn't want to impose.

1125
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,517
- Oh, no imposition at all!
- No.

1126
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,684
We'd love to have you,
wouldn't we, Chris?

1127
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,854
Yeah, rad.
Awesome.

1128
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,693
Mom's coming.
That's good.

1129
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,131
- There's a group now.
- Yes!

1130
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,795
- It was us. It was us.
- Oh, my darling.

1131
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,464
Oh my sweetheart.

1132
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,031
I love you so much.

1133
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:36,712
- How much time do we have?
- I'm not sure.

1134
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,254
Last time it was no more
than five minutes.

1135
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,490
I love you, angel.

1136
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,523
What happened to me?

1137
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,622
This is so gay.

1138
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:01,004
Oh, Dusty...

1139
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:08,479
Son of a bitch!
Huh?

1140
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:11,645
Peanut.

1141
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:18,417
Oh, no.

1142
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,399
* Forgiveness... *

1143
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,401
Show us your tits!

1144
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,597
- * Is more than saying sorry. *
- Hey! Ashlee Simpson!

1145
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,969
Forgive this!

1146
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,975
Dusty, what kind
of car is this?

1147
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:37,376
Carol, this little Japanese princess
here is called the Prius.

1148
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,176
I think it's so neat
that you kids

1149
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:41,183
care about
the environment.

1150
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:44,846
- I love the environment.
- But honey, don't you drive

1151
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,822
a Range Rover?
Aren't those bad?

1152
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,984
Well, I had a really
nice time tonight,

1153
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,617
and I hope we can
do it again soon.

1154
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,821
Hey, Dusty,
thanks for comin'.

1155
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,024
Oh, listen, man, it was
my pleasure, really.

1156
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,034
Thank you all for having me.
It was so nice.

1157
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,161
And hey, before I forget,
make sure

1158
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,569
that you rinse that thing
at least twice a day, okay?

1159
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,768
Your mouth is
a disgusting open cesspool

1160
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:09,073
with germs and bacteria.
Now put that back!

1161
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,306
- Christopher, put that back.
- Put it back!

1162
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,483
Thanks.

1163
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,576
Hey, anyone want
some cocoa?

1164
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:19,486
Oh, Carol,
you are so sweet!

1165
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,491
And I would love to do that,
except I volunteered at the hospital

1166
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,584
so that Paul could spend
Christmas Eve with his family.

1167
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,357
- So, I kinda gotta get going.
- Aw.

1168
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,227
That's a drag. God!

1169
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,130
Hey, Jamie,
what about you?

1170
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,503
- Ready?
- Give me a Cougar roar. Cougar roar!

1171
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,470
Aw.

1172
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,272
Cookie Monster says
the Cougars are

1173
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:45,508
great big cookies

1174
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,675
at the top of the jar.

1175
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,617
Ladies and Gentleman,
the amazing Chris Brander.

1176
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,746
Oh my gosh,
I remember this.

1177
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:57,191
He juggles three tennis balls,
but gets bored very quickly

1178
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,626
and wants something else.

1179
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:03,154
Shh-shh-shh, clear!

1180
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,928
Clear!

1181
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,163
No kissing!

1182
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,569
That's right, Jamie Palamino,

1183
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,665
you're my best friend!

1184
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,676
I love you, Chris Brander.
Mwha!

1185
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,508
Mwha, mwha, mwha!

1186
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,346
Oh, your mom's car.
You see, this is more like you.

1187
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,511
Yeah, I'm gonna take it
back to L.A.

1188
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,584
- What?
- Guess what I found?

1189
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,255
- No, the tape I made you?
- 1995.

1190
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,855
- "The Summer of Like."
- Put it in.

1191
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,796
* Dun-nun-de-dun
de-dun-dun-dun *

1192
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,646
Oh, God.

1193
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,708
- Oh!
- Oh my God,

1194
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,811
I just peed a little.

1195
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:02,415
- Good night, guys.
- Good night, Chris.

1196
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,425
What's up?

1197
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,329
- Little problem.
- Where are you?

1198
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,197
- The Metal Shop.
- What?!

1199
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:15,203
Hey! Hey, ow! Ow!

1200
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,330
- That's it, bitch. It's on!
- Come on!

1201
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,968
Ah! I'm gonna kill you!
Not so funny now, bitch, huh?!

1202
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,012
- Not so funny now?!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1203
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,980
* Christmas, Christmas,
the happiest day of the year... *

1204
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,074
Kudos on the
Christmas cookies, Mom.

1205
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,449
Thanks, pumpkin.
I'll be back in an hour.

1206
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,183
* Where sleigh bells ringing
and go jingle-ling *

1207
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,589
* As we're dashing
through the snow *

1208
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:42,489
* Christmas, Christmas *

1209
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:45,227
* So, Jesus,
hear our song... *

1210
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,565
- What's up, Dude?
- Quiet, she's sleeping.

1211
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,298
I'm going over
to Jamie's.

1212
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,169
- Did you boink her yet?
- Shut it.

1213
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,231
If she wakes up,
tell her I went to meet Bono.

1214
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,869
- You're gonna meet Bono? I wanna come.
- No, you walking void,

1215
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,743
it's a lie, but if she wakes up
just tell her I'll be back in a bit.

1216
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,783
- Fine!
- Fine!

1217
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:03,812
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1218
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:15,590
* Christmas,
Christmas *

1219
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,997
- * The happiest day of the year *
- Mike!

1220
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:23,434
Oh, God!

1221
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:28,500
* Spreading
Christmas cheer *

1222
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,512
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

1223
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,912
* We wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year *

1224
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,075
This is pathetic!

1225
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:39,520
* Good tidings we bring,
to you and your kin *

1226
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,614
* Good tidings for Christmas *

1227
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,454
- * And a Happy New Year *
- Oh shit!

1228
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,616
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

1229
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,618
Encore! Encore!
Encore!

1230
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,620
Okay, all right,
one more time.

1231
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,122
- One more time. Okay.
- Oh yeah!

1232
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:18,957
Here we go.
You guys, you know,

1233
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,655
Christmas is the time
for giving.

1234
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,028
And the most precious gift
that you can give...

1235
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,296
- is your heart.
- Aww.

1236
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,837
Jamie Palamino,
this is my gift to you.

1237
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:32,739
* When Jamie smiles *

1238
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:37,405
* It takes me miles *

1239
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,507
* From where I feel unsure *

1240
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,647
* When Jamie smiles *

1241
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,850
* I realize *

1242
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:54,022
* She's no ordinary girl *

1243
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:57,691
* Hm-mm-mm... *

1244
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,895
* No ordinary girl *

1245
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,371
* Oh-oh-hhh... *

1246
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,379
- Where's Chris?!
- I'll never tell you anything!

1247
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:19,546
Oh yeah?

1248
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:25,316
- He's with his lover.
- * Deck the halls with bows of holly *

1249
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,828
* Fa-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la *

1250
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:31,333
* 'Tis the season
to be jolly *

1251
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,164
* Fa-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la *

1252
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,772
Dude, Jamie's outside.
What are you doing up here?

1253
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,831
I'm getting my butt
kicked by Dinkleman,

1254
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,399
that's what
I'm doing up here.

1255
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:44,969
You see him play that guitar?
It's like he has 15 fingers.

1256
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,448
Everybody loves him.
I can't compete with this guy.

1257
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,953
You can't compete with this...
are you kidding me?

1258
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,184
You're Chris Brander!
You're Hollywood. You date models!

1259
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,886
He's Jersey.
He skis in his jeans!

1260
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,587
It's Dinkleman.

1261
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:02,028
It's Dusty Dinkleman.

1262
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,061
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman.

1263
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,933
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman!

1264
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:11,997
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman's going down.

1265
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,668
Dinkleman...
is going way down.

1266
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,507
Atta boy.

1267
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,945
Now you get out there
and you tell Jamie how you feel!

1268
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,882
- Let's do this.
- Atta boy.

1269
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:25,546
Good ol' Chris Brander,
ladies and gentlemen!

1270
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,784
*... Iooked down
on the Feast of Stephen *

1271
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:31,850
* When the snow
lay round about *

1272
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,396
* Deep and crisp
and even *

1273
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,125
* Brightly shone
the moon that night *

1274
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,258
* Though the frost
was cruel *

1275
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,528
What the...

1276
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:51,040
* It's the most wonderful
time of the year... *

1277
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,240
The jig is up!
Run!

1278
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:55,284
You son of a bitch!

1279
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:58,878
Samantha!
You're here! Shit!

1280
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,048
There she is.
There's the little slut

1281
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,886
you've been
banging behind my back!

1282
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,223
- Me?
- Not you, wrinkles. Her!

1283
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,785
- Who are you?
- Oh...

1284
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:10,627
- I'm Samantha James, bitch!
- Don't shove me!

1285
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,498
- You're a whore! Santa's little whore!
- Get off!

1286
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,537
- Santa's little whore!
- Cat fight!

1287
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,231
- Get out!
- You're gonna pay for this.

1288
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,866
I'm gonna get you fired!

1289
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,411
Hope you enjoy
unemployment, dickweed!

1290
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,242
Get off me, God boy!

1291
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,511
But Samantha, What about the words
to your song? "Forgiveness"!

1292
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:31,212
Forgive this, asshole.

1293
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:33,881
Oh...

1294
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,618
I hate this town!

1295
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:39,252
Call me.

1296
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,161
- Chris?
- Yeah.

1297
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,731
- Little problem.
- Hm?

1298
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,539
Duck!

1299
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:03,646
- Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho!
- No! Not Santa!

1300
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,928
Whoa!
Flaming reindeer.

1301
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:29,467
Wow! You don't see
that every day.

1302
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,506
Hey Chris, it's Samantha.
I just talked to my sponsor

1303
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,483
and I owe you
an apology.

1304
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,213
It's Samantha...
Call me...

1305
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,050
It's Samantha!

1306
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:42,955
Hello, Joyce?

1307
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:45,721
Joyce?

1308
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:53,968
Go away.

1309
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:56,197
Go away!

1310
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,204
Mom, I said
I have a tummy ache.

1311
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,502
Well that was
an interesting Christmas.

1312
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,242
I'm sorry. I'll pay
for everything.

1313
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,045
I'm not here
to collect.

1314
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,710
What are you doing here?

1315
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:13,687
I want to talk to the guy
who wrote me this.

1316
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,885
Wow.

1317
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:23,295
- Mmm... want some more?
- No. Gallon's my limit.

1318
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,629
Oh, excuse me if I'm not
one of your stick models.

1319
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,534
"I'm Chris Brander. I hang out
with Good Charlotte and Pink.

1320
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,129
- I go to Jay Z's birthday party..."
- Okay, okay. All right.

1321
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:33,835
- Thank you very much. I get it. I was lame.
- Yeah.

1322
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:37,709
Actually, I was nervous,
but uh, more importantly,

1323
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,748
does this hat
make me look fat?

1324
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,980
So...

1325
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,957
is your life everything
you'd hoped it'd be?

1326
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:53,051
I always thought that
if I had a huge career

1327
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,393
and famous clients
and tons of money

1328
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,489
that I'd be happy.

1329
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:59,591
And the truth is...

1330
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,602
I was right.

1331
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,104
I love it.
Especially the money. Ooh.

1332
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:07,336
You're so bad!

1333
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,172
What about you?

1334
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,837
Let's put you in
the hot seat, huh?

1335
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,710
Where do you see
yourself in 10 years?

1336
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:17,341
Um, well, I see
myself teaching.

1337
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:20,786
And I see myself
getting married

1338
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,448
and raising a family.

1339
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,493
What?

1340
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,030
It's gettin' late.

1341
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:34,501
Why don't I
take you home?

1342
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,504
Or...

1343
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:38,506
I could sleep over
like old times.

1344
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,187
God.

1345
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:06,097
- Hi.
- Wow.

1346
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,900
- Ahhh.
- Ahhh.

1347
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:16,604
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

1348
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,375
Yeah. Hmm.

1349
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,818
This is it.

1350
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,886
You're finally gonna have sex
with Jamie Palamino.

1351
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:39,230
Oh God, look at that face.
Look at that body.

1352
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:42,566
Why are you smiling
like a friggin' idiot?

1353
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,970
Go on, make a move.

1354
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,201
Make a move!

1355
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,179
What's on your mind?

1356
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,112
Bush.

1357
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:57,309
President Bush,
The First Family, really.

1358
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:07,894
Dude, you're killing me!

1359
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:11,160
This is the girl of your
dreams. Ravish her!

1360
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,360
But what if she doesn't
want to be ravished?

1361
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,903
What if she wants to stay friends? Friends
don't ravish each other?

1362
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:18,269
Friends watch
"New Year's Rockin' Eve."

1363
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,035
I wonder who's
hosting this year?

1364
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,340
Chris, can you put your feet on mine?
They're freezing.

1365
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,073
Yeah.

1366
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:27,240
Hell yeah.
Her feet aren't even cold.

1367
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,181
This is it.

1368
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:32,550
Don't even think about
how weird tomorrow's gonna be.

1369
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:39,785
- Chris.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

1370
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:42,387
What're you doing?
Where're you going?

1371
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,830
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, everything's fine.

1372
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,596
Yeah. You okay? Uh, you need
another blanket or anything?

1373
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,331
- No, I'm fine.
- Ah.

1374
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:52,533
You're not gonna make
a move, are you?

1375
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:55,236
- Good night, Jamie.
- Good night, Chris.

1376
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,109
You don't deserve a penis.

1377
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:02,145
God, and we had
this great night

1378
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:04,242
and we were laughing

1379
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,754
and we were showing each other
old pictures and...

1380
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,722
- Did he try anything?
- No!

1381
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:12,158
- Did you try anything?
- No, but I put myself out there.

1382
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,559
I mean, I wore
the sexy white shirt

1383
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:18,122
and I did the whole cold-feet move
and we slept in the same bed.

1384
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,930
What the hell is wrong with you?
I mean, why didn't you sleep with her?

1385
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,868
- Oh, I know. I had her.
- I mean, are you two

1386
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:24,929
on the same menstrual
cycle yet or what?

1387
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:28,704
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

1388
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:31,109
Maybe I just don't compare
to these L.A. Girls.

1389
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,444
Look, the timing just
wasn't right, you know?

1390
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:37,918
I'm... I'm laying there.
I'm about to make my move

1391
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:40,352
and then suddenly
it just hits me.

1392
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,356
Where's this going?

1393
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,449
What happens after
we sleep together?

1394
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,517
Does she move to L.A.?
Do I move back here?

1395
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:49,564
Jesus, Dude. I thought you just
wanted to sleep with her.

1396
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,191
Maybe he just wants
to be friends.

1397
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,963
Maybe he's gay.

1398
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,562
I can't just sleep with Jamie Palamino.
We have a history.

1399
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,766
- We're... we're... we're... we're...
- Friends.

1400
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,744
God damn it!

1401
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,973
I'm right back in high school again,
you know?

1402
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:09,745
I gotta follow my own advice.
I gotta just walk away.

1403
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:11,251
No, put me on the 3:00.

1404
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,254
The sooner I get out
of here, the better.

1405
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:16,189
- You sure about this?
- No.

1406
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:18,783
* When Janice
smiles... *

1407
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:21,796
- Janice?
- * I realize *

1408
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:24,924
* She's no ordinary *

1409
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,026
* Girl. *

1410
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,441
Hey listen.
I gotta hang out

1411
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,276
with my friends
over there, okay?

1412
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:42,249
- I'll talk to you tonight.
- Whoo!

1413
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:47,284
- What's up, homies?
- You tell me.

1414
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,187
- What's with the nurse?
- Oh, Janice.

1415
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,692
Oof, another bee
in the hive, my friend,

1416
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,786
- just another bee.
- Well, what about Jamie?

1417
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,626
What about her? I mean, hey,

1418
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,189
it's great, right? Two biggest
geeks back in the day

1419
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,463
now finally have a shot with the hottest
chick in high school?

1420
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:04,301
- You can't write that stuff, my friend.
- Hey, are you kidding me?

1421
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,967
Oh, come on, man.
Cut the nice guy routine.

1422
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:09,203
I know what you're up to
and I am all for it.

1423
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,712
I mean it is gonna be
sweet revenge on Jamie Palamino

1424
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,748
for keeping us in the friend zone
all those years.

1425
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:16,410
Oh, yeah, you wish you were
in the friend zone.

1426
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,783
I was in the friend zone.
Friend zone's mine.

1427
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,721
- Dusty, popcorn's ready.
- Copy that, I'm mobile.

1428
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,553
- Listen, I gotta run.
- The man's juice!

1429
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,559
You guys have a nice time.
It's been nice seeing you.

1430
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:28,790
Have fun with Jamie. I know I will.
Clark, always a pleasure.

1431
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,855
- Dinkleman.
- Son of a bitch.

1432
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:35,030
So we're looking at
day cares.

1433
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:37,628
And Darla's got this one picked
out for TJ and it's great.

1434
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,266
And you know, don't get me wrong,
I want the best for my kid.

1435
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:42,173
I mean he deserves
the best

1436
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:45,873
but Tiny Tots is just too...
oh, Mariah Carey!

1437
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,585
What the hell
are you doing?!

1438
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,213
This is a
Pontiac Grand Prix!

1439
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,223
I'm sorry, okay?!

1440
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,987
But I can't let Dinkleman
get away with this!

1441
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:02,792
I refuse to sit back and let Jamie
get used by another asshole!

1442
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:06,323
You could've asked!
L.A. Guys are so dramatic.

1443
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,869
- I'm sorry!
- Okay.

1444
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:15,041
- * Christmas, Christmas... *
- Oh my God.

1445
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:18,238
You know, one good snowfall
and you won't see any of this.

1446
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:22,306
* Where sleigh bells ringing
and go jingle-ling *

1447
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:25,717
* Spreading
Christmas cheer. *

1448
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:27,880
Hi, Mr. Palamino.
How are you?

1449
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,254
Come to destroy
the rest of the house, huh?

1450
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:33,021
Look, I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

1451
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:36,656
- Ho-ho-ho.
- And that.

1452
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,724
Look, I know you hate me, but I need
to speak with Jamie. Where is she?

1453
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,702
- She's gone off with Mr. Lee.
- Dry cleaner?

1454
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:46,070
- No. Dusty, you jackass.
- Where are they?

1455
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:59,385
- * I've been workin' on the railroad... *
- No, Chris! This way.

1456
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:02,787
* All the livelong day *

1457
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,986
* I've been workin'
on the railroad *

1458
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:09,792
* Just to pass
the time away *

1459
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,596
* Can't you hear
the whistle blowing?

1460
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:16,661
* Rise so early
in the morn' *

1461
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,196
- Dinkleman!
- * Can't you hear the captain shouting? *

1462
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,903
- Chris, what're you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

1463
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:27,573
Dusty!

1464
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:29,976
Yes!

1465
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,184
- I really need to speak with you!
- This next number

1466
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,884
- is for your favorite teacher and mine.
- Let's go.

1467
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,086
She put this wonderful concert
together for all of us.

1468
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,289
Give a big round of applause
to Miss Jamie Palamino.

1469
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:47,460
* When Jamie smiles *

1470
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,697
* It takes me miles *

1471
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,269
* From where I've... *

1472
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,742
God, I still can't believe
he wrote me that song.

1473
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:58,871
Oh I can. He's been working on that song
since high school, remember?

1474
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,710
It's like the stalker's
national anthem.

1475
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:03,012
Not to mention I already heard
that song today,

1476
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,110
only it was Janice's eyes
that made him smile.

1477
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,985
- Janice? Who's Janice?
- A nurse with really big boobs

1478
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:11,457
that works at the medical center. A girl
I saw him kissing earlier tonight.

1479
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:14,154
Dusty's a Jersey player,
Jamie!

1480
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,628
He's out
for revenge on you

1481
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,665
for putting him in the friend zone
in high school.

1482
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,462
What are you
talking about?

1483
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:21,502
The guy's looking
for the anger bang!

1484
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,505
Amazing! That's exactly
what he said about you.

1485
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:26,768
- Don't you see what's happening here?
- Oh, I don't know.

1486
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,037
The guy's just
out-playing me, that's all.

1487
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:31,272
Oh, it's about you!
Now he's out-playing you!

1488
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:33,280
- W-what am I, a game?
- No!

1489
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:35,111
Would you guys like
to join us in a carol

1490
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,879
- to celebrate the birth of our Lord?
- No!

1491
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:45,990
My God, don't!
Dusty! Don't!

1492
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,427
- Dinkleman!
- What is the matter with you?

1493
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,488
This is a Christmas
concert for children!

1494
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:53,125
- You liar!
- Suckster's not your boyfriend, is he?

1495
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:56,602
- No, he's not!
- 'Cause we like Dusty.

1496
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,833
Dusty! Dusty!
Dusty! Dusty!

1497
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,636
- Ugh!
- Dusty! Dusty! Dusty...!

1498
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:02,472
Oooh!

1499
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:05,035
I'm being framed!
I'm being framed!

1500
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:09,340
- Dusty!
- Dinkleman!

1501
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,387
Man, when you come back to town,
you come back to town!

1502
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:16,185
Huh? Huh?
Look, don't sweat it.

1503
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,283
W-w-we'll go
to The Maple tonight

1504
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,987
You can apologize
to Jamie

1505
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:23,520
and everything will be just...
just peachy.

1506
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,896
Okay, yep, good.
Thanks, Clark, for everything.

1507
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:28,367
See you in another 10 years.
Guess not.

1508
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:32,972
How'd it go with Jamie last night?
You boink her?

1509
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,373
That would be a no.

1510
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,708
Raise you hand
if your brother's a homo!

1511
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,447
All right.
Keep in touch!

1512
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:50,187
You believe that?
Not one taxi, not one.

1513
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,726
Stupid town.
I gotta take the bus!

1514
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:54,386
Dude, bus sucks!

1515
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:59,057
Yes!
I am outta here!

1516
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:04,736
So long, Sucktown!
Kiss my ass!

1517
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,808
Hey, Mr. Bus Driver Man.

1518
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,538
Hey...

1519
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:14,104
pull my finger.
Come on, pull my finger.

1520
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:40,072
- Aw!
- Yoo-hoo!

1521
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:43,578
- Great.
- Jamie!

1522
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:46,273
- Whoa, miss, miss. W-w-whoa.
- What? What, what, wha...

1523
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:48,612
- what, Chris? What do you want?
- I just want to apologize.

1524
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:50,548
I'm sorry.
I was out of line, okay?

1525
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,951
- You're an asshole.
- Oh, my... I was...

1526
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:55,512
Hey, I'm gonna get you a cab
and take you home, huh?

1527
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,718
- She's so sensitive!
- You blew it. I'm winning.

1528
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,058
- You're the Devil.
- So go ahead, just go sleep it off.

1529
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:03,120
You'll be right as rain
in the morning, brother.

1530
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:06,065
Chris, you're drunk!
Go home!

1531
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,659
I'm not drunk.
What's this?

1532
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:13,105
Ooh.
"Simply Dusty"

1533
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:15,166
Is there any other kind?
That's adorable.

1534
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,177
Do you know what else
is adorable? You two.

1535
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:20,112
Hey! Stop bringing Dusty
into your problems, okay?

1536
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,116
Dusty and I are fine.

1537
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:24,778
- Dusty and I are friends.
- Right!

1538
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,617
- Not for too long, I hope.
- Yeah...

1539
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:29,122
Wait, what?

1540
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,022
Slow down.
What did you just say?

1541
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:33,287
Jamie, listen, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

1542
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,295
L... about our
relationship.

1543
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:37,923
Maybe we could take
the next step or something?

1544
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,466
Dusty, can I be honest with you?

1545
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:42,162
- I think you're a really nice guy.
- Thank you.

1546
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,501
I think you're funny
and charming and sweet,

1547
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:47,565
and I just don't have
those feelings for you.

1548
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,507
- You're kidding.
- No.

1549
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:54,038
Whew!

1550
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:57,209
Okay, 'cause... cause I wrote you
that song and everything,

1551
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:59,116
you know, and I worked
really hard on it

1552
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:01,451
and what kind of girl would you be if you
didn't put out for the guy that wrote

1553
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,514
- you that song, you know what mean?
- Huh?

1554
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:08,429
F-this. I'm mobile.

1555
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:11,632
Ah-ha!

1556
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,299
I'm gonna miss him!

1557
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,998
- Oh!
- Ow!

1558
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,507
- What? Heh.
- Eh!

1559
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:25,012
Get off me, Chris!
Why are you here?

1560
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,775
Why do you keep
messing with my head?

1561
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,839
I messed with your head
for three days.

1562
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,886
You've been torturing me
since the sixth grade!

1563
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:33,716
So that's what
this is about?

1564
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:36,552
Because I wouldn't screw you
in high school? Get over yourself!

1565
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,026
Oh, after years of you
being the biggest tease,

1566
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:42,655
trust me,
I'm so over myself.

1567
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,358
Oh, so now
I'm the tease.

1568
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:45,956
I practically
throw myself at you

1569
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,626
the other night
and you did nothing!

1570
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:51,263
And now you know
how it feels.

1571
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:53,204
I'm outta here.

1572
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,573
Yeah, there you go.
Just walk away like you always do!

1573
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,305
Oh, no no no.
I'm-I'm not walking away.

1574
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:59,404
I'm running back
to my great life in L.A.!

1575
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,881
- Great. Well, have fun.
- Oh, you have fun...

1576
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,145
being the girl
who peaked in high school.

1577
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:07,154
- Ooohh!
- You slap like a cheerleader.

1578
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:09,349
Bye, Chris.

1579
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,194
And stay out!

1580
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,893
I've always wanted
to say that.

1581
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:31,795
How did you
get in here?

1582
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:34,171
My bodyguard
let me in.

1583
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:36,870
I was making cookies.

1584
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:38,606
Oh, I was trying
to be all domesticated

1585
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,910
like that skank you were
banging behind my back.

1586
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:42,472
Please leave me alone.

1587
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:45,485
No, sh-sh-sh-sh!

1588
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,180
Hugs and kisses!

1589
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:50,554
It's all good, baby,
it's all good.

1590
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,685
By making me jealous on purpose
you inspire me to write the best songs,

1591
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,491
you know,
full of angst and hate!

1592
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:58,293
You like that.
You and I are gonna be

1593
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:00,357
the greatest musical
manager team

1594
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:02,767
since Jessica Simpson
and her father...

1595
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:04,862
only we get to "mreow"
and they can't,

1596
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:07,407
'cause it's illegal.
I looked it up.

1597
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:11,070
This is the new and improved
"Forgiveness."

1598
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:20,883
* Forgiveness *

1599
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:24,118
* Is more than
sayin' sorry *

1600
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,626
Are you sorry?
Ha ha!

1601
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,330
* Forgiveness. *

1602
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:34,696
- No.
- No?

1603
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:37,704
- No more.
- But I've forgiven you!

1604
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:39,899
- It's just like the song...
- Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...

1605
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:43,273
This isn't about you.

1606
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,710
It's cool, you can have other girls.
I like girls.

1607
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,577
Darla!

1608
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,776
I don't want other girls.

1609
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:51,443
I want one girl.

1610
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:54,812
- That's not you.
- Hmph.

1611
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:01,895
Look.
I'll call...

1612
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,266
Ouch.

1613
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,637
- Why don't you like me?
- It's a little hard to answer

1614
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,641
with a taser in my balls!

1615
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:17,473
This is about Santa's
little whore, isn't it?

1616
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:23,117
Ooh yeah,
it's go time.

1617
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:24,481
Hey, hey, hey!
It's not go time!

1618
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,486
This isn't how it works,
Samantha.

1619
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:30,012
You can't force or-or torture
someone into liking you.

1620
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,649
Ooh, the big speech.

1621
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:33,455
No! You just have to put
yourself out there

1622
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:34,460
and hope that they
like you back.

1623
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:36,588
This isn't a game!
This is my life!

1624
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,529
Oh, yeah, well,
this is my life!

1625
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,465
Okay? I'm sorry.

1626
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:43,561
I'm not the most
boring person ever!

1627
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,333
Okay? I'm sorry
I'm not poor!

1628
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:48,137
I'm sorry...

1629
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:51,542
I'm sorry I don't
have a fat ass!

1630
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:54,309
I'm sorry I'm not...
where're you going?

1631
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:59,012
* Missed the last
train home *

1632
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:07,894
* Birds pass by to tell me
that I'm not alone *

1633
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:11,295
* Well, I'm pushing myself
to finish this part... *

1634
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:12,890
Hey! Hey,
where is she?

1635
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:17,700
* I handle a lot
walking on this *

1636
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:20,969
* It's in your eyes,
open your eyes *

1637
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:24,910
* Open eyes,
open your eyes *

1638
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:26,674
* Open your eyes *

1639
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,613
* Open your eyes. *

1640
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,617
Hi.

1641
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:32,880
Jamie.
Look, Jamie!

1642
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,815
I said a lot of really crappy
things the other night

1643
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,860
and I'm sorry about that.

1644
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:42,396
I haven't been a very good friend
to you and I'm sorry, okay?

1645
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:46,456
I just... the truth is
I'm-I'm afraid to be your friend

1646
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:48,399
'cause I'm always
gonna want more.

1647
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,165
But then I got
to thinking that-that

1648
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:54,003
I'd rather have you in my life
as a friend than not at all.

1649
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,346
You know what?
That's a lie too.

1650
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,549
Why are you back here?

1651
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:09,353
Because I want
to take you on a date.

1652
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,157
And I don't care if it's
in the day or at night

1653
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:17,596
or whenever, as long
as it's a real date.

1654
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:20,930
And I want to tell you how beautiful
I think you are inside and out.

1655
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:24,231
And I want to have
babies with you

1656
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:27,331
and I want to marry you
and I love you.

1657
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:30,836
Jamie, I always have.

1658
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:36,882
Mmm. Ow!

1659
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:39,078
Sorry. Just, uh...

1660
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:41,121
20 years all at once!

1661
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:04,435
Unbelievable!

1662
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,571
Suckster's making out
with Mrs. P!

1663
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:08,843
What is she thinking?

1664
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:12,044
- Hey, Sarah, do you want my last cookie?
- Oh, thanks, Brett!

1665
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,247
Hey, Joey, do you want
some of my cookie?

1666
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:15,914
Don't mind if I do.

1667
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:19,153
- You're such a good friend, Brett.
- The bestest!

1668
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:20,524
Ahh.

1669
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:21,391
Oh, shit!

1670
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:24,357
* I swear *

1671
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:27,367
* By the moon
and the stars *

1672
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:30,233
* In the skies *

1673
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,103
* I'll be there *

1674
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:35,836
* And I swear *

1675
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:37,969
* Like the shadow *

1676
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:41,948
* That's by your side *

1677
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:45,383
* I'll be there *

1678
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:48,581
* For better or worse *

1679
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:51,557
* Till death
do us part *

1680
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:56,723
* I'll love you with every
beat of my heart *

1681
01:28:56,798 --> 01:29:00,290
* And I swear *

1682
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:05,398
* Oh-hh *

1683
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:10,441
* Hahh-aah... *

1684
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:14,072
* I'll give you
everything *

1685
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,275
* I can *

1686
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,216
* I'll build your dreams *

1687
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:21,847
* With these two hands *

1688
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:24,653
* We'll hang
some memories *

1689
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:28,492
* On the walls *

1690
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,031
- * And when *
- * And when *

1691
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:36,036
* Just the two
of us are there *

1692
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:38,402
* You won't
have to ask *

1693
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:42,068
* If I still care *

1694
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:45,704
* 'Cause as the time
turns the page *

1695
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:50,945
* My love won't age
at all *

1696
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:54,112
- * And I swear *
- * And I swear *

1697
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:57,021
* By the moon
and the stars *

1698
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:59,821
* In the skies *

1699
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:02,920
- * I'll be there *
- * I'll be there *

1700
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:05,591
- * And I swear *
- * And I swear *

1701
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:11,298
* Like the shadow
that's by your side *

1702
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:14,967
- * I'll be there *
- * I'll be there *

1703
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:17,806
* For better
or worse *

1704
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:20,643
* Till death
do us part *

1705
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:26,051
* I'll love you with
every beat of my heart *

1706
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,783
- * And I swear *
- * Oh, yeah *

1707
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:42,869
* And I swear *

1708
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:45,997
* By the moon
and the stars *

1709
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:48,564
* In the skies *

1710
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:51,635
- * I'll be there *
- * I'll be there *

1711
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:54,306
* And I swear *

1712
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:56,407
* Like the shadow *

1713
01:30:56,484 --> 01:31:00,352
- * That's by your side *
- * That's by your side *

1714
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:03,652
- * I'll be there *
- * I'll be there *

1715
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:07,091
- * For better or worse *
- * Better or worse *

1716
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:09,959
- * Till death do us part *
- * Oh no *

1717
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:15,196
* I'll love you with
every beat of my heart *

1718
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:18,261
* And I swear *

1719
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:21,399
* I swear *

1720
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:26,311
* Oh, whoa, I... *

1721
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:29,508
* Swear. *

1722
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:30,608
Mike!

1723
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:43,455
* Forgiveness *

1724
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:48,100
* Is more than
saying sorry *

1725
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:52,128
* Sorry sorry sorry *

1726
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:56,336
* Forgiveness *

1727
01:31:56,410 --> 01:32:00,278
* Means accepting
people's flaws *

1728
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:05,285
* Flaws flaws flaws *

1729
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,844
* To forgive is divine *

1730
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:11,449
* So let's have
a glass of wine *

1731
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,120
* And have makeup sex *

1732
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,129
* Until the end of *

1733
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:19,132
* Time *

1734
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:26,836
* Forgiveness *

1735
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:30,344
* Does not mean
compromising *

1736
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:37,680
* Let's forgive
and forget *

1737
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:40,880
* And solve this
African debt *

1738
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:43,924
* Just like
the Cheshire Cat *

1739
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:47,392
* Who says, "Mreow!
You're running out of time!" *

1740
01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:52,489
* Time time time time time,
wreeow! *

1741
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:20,716
* Forgiveness *

1742
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,660
You'll always be
fat to me, Chris!

1743
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:26,965
* Forgiveness *

1744
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:29,594
God damn it!
Come on, Dusty.

1745
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:33,573
* Forgiveness *

1746
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:36,075
Not happy!

1747
01:33:37,645 --> 01:33:39,636
* Forgiveness *

1748
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:44,651
Hello, Joyce? Joyce?

1749
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,619
Oh my God!

1750
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:52,850
Then said Jesus,
"Father, forgive them

1751
01:33:52,927 --> 01:33:56,124
for they know
not what they do."

1752
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:59,894
If you haven't forgiven yourself
something, how can you forgive others?

1753
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:01,491
I won't apologize.

1754
01:34:01,569 --> 01:34:03,366
I don't forgive you.

1755
01:34:03,437 --> 01:34:06,463
You can forgive,
but you can't forget.

1756
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,676
Where are you?

1757
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:16,811
* Forgiveness *

1758
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:21,210
Time time time time

1759
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:23,779
time time time time.
