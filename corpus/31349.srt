1
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,022
At the beginning of the 21st century,
the Umbrella Corporation...

2
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,567
had become the largest commercial
entity in the United States.

3
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,612
Nine out of every ten homes
contain its products.

4
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,699
Its political and financial
influence is felt everywhere.

5
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,619
In public, it is the world's
leading supplier...

6
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,581
of computer technology,
medical products and health care.

7
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,792
Unknown even to its own employees...

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,420
its massive profits are generated
by military technology...

9
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,674
genetic experimentation
and viral weaponry.

10
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,410
All Umbrella staff must wear
their identity tags at all times.

11
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:46,291
All radiation badges will be collected
at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.

12
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,294
Thank you! God!

13
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,090
Some people.

14
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,300
Yeah.

15
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,081
- Don't show this to me.
- Why not?

16
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,916
Because I'm busy.

17
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,050
It's nothing. Fire drill.

18
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,189
- What is that?
- Fire drill.

19
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,278
- Shit!
- Hey, what the hell is going on?

20
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,989
- Get the computers covered! Move it!
- Damn it, I'm trying!

21
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,033
The experiments! Move them!

22
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,712
Shouldn't the doors
open or something?

23
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,007
It's supposed to take us
to the nearest floor.

24
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,100
What's happening?

25
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,146
Line's dead.

26
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,610
- What's the problem?
- The doors won't open.

27
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,488
- What about the ones at the back?
- Locked as well.

28
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,407
There's no fire here!
No fire!

29
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,870
- The code doesn't work!
- No fire!

30
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,206
- "What's wrong with you?"
- "The door won't open!"

31
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,749
And this water
isn't going anywhere.

32
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,252
- What?
- It's a sealed room.

33
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,505
- Help me with the door!
- Oh, fuck the doors!

34
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,934
We have to get out of here.
What's going on?

35
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,396
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.

36
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,189
- We have to get out of here!
- Take it easy.

37
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,400
- You take it easy!
- Quiet!

38
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,072
What is that?

39
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,755
Oh, my God.

40
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,746
Halo!

41
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,211
Stop it!

42
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,506
Stop it! Stop!

43
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,010
Help!

44
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,502
Let me see.

45
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:07,511
We're going to have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building!

46
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,012
Here, give me a hand.

47
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,976
That's as far as they'll go.
They're caught on something.

48
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:18,105
That's wide enough.
I can squeeze through. I'll get help.

49
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,656
I'm stuck.
You're gonna have to push.

50
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,200
That's it.

51
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,535
A bit more.

52
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:34,872
What was that?

53
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,169
Oh, Christ!
It's the brakes! Get out!

54
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,671
- I can't move!
- We have to get out of here!

55
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,723
Push her out of the way!

56
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,516
Pull me back inside!

57
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,727
Pull me back inside!

58
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,564
Hello?

59
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,060
- Who are you?
- Move!

60
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,603
Don't touch me! Stop!

61
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,188
- Get away from me!
- Down!

62
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,661
What are you doing?
I'm a cop!

63
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,997
I told you, I'm a cop!

64
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,089
You're breaking my arm!

65
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,556
Report.

66
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,853
Report now.

67
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,521
What?

68
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,858
I want your report, soldier.

69
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,943
I don't know
what you're talking about.

70
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,446
Sir, the house's primary
defenses have been activated.

71
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,116
She's probably still suffering
the side effects.

72
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,576
What are you doing with us?

73
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,452
What about the cop?

74
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,914
Matthew Addison.
I'm not getting a match.

75
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,541
Who are you?

76
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,878
I just transferred. They probably
don't even have me on file yet.

77
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,963
The locals are inefficient.
It's possible.

78
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,215
Should I secure him here?

79
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,555
No. We take him with us.

80
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,267
You can't do this!

81
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,438
Blow me.

82
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,609
Prep for entry to the Hive.

83
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,011
Power's down.

84
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,556
- So fix it.
- I'm on it.

85
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,281
Are you done yet?

86
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,449
Jumpy.

87
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,588
Stand clear!

88
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,912
- You got a problem?
- How's that door?

89
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,289
- It's sealed shut.
- Let me.

90
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:35,806
Jumpy?

91
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:12,176
Lie still. Lie still!

92
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,221
Watch this light.
Follow it.

93
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,810
- Now, how many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.

94
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:22,978
Good.

95
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,980
Now tell me your name.

96
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,112
I don't know.

97
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:35,949
He's fine. Memory loss,
just like the other one.

98
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,991
Let's open that door.

99
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,140
Listen to me. I want to know
who you people are...

100
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,560
and I want to know
what's going on here.

101
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,938
Now!

102
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,234
You and I have the same employer.

103
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,403
We all work
for the Umbrella Corporation.

104
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,739
The mansion above us
is an emergency entrance to the Hive.

105
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:02,077
You are security operatives
placed there to protect that entrance.

106
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,745
What about this?

107
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,623
Your marriage is a fake.

108
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:10,002
Just part of your cover
to protect the secrecy of the Hive.

109
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,087
And what is the Hive?

110
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,672
Show them.

111
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:15,799
Accessing schematic of the Hive.

112
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,010
Accessing schematic of the Hive.

113
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,637
Raccoon City, nearest urban center.

114
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,639
The mansion where we found you...

115
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,267
and through which we gained
access to the train...

116
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,312
which, in turn,
brought us to the Hive.

117
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,733
The Hive itself
is located underground...

118
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,652
deep beneath the streets
of Raccoon City.

119
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,323
A top-secret research facility...

120
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,950
owned and operated
by the Umbrella Corporation...

121
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:46,872
the Hive houses over 500 technicians,
scientists and support staff.

122
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,958
They live and work underground.

123
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,794
Their research
is of the highest importance.

124
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,005
Its nature is classified.

125
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:59,801
Our position on the map
is indicated by heat signature.

126
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:16,151
Why can't I remember anything?

127
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,195
The Hive has its own
defense mechanisms...

128
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,030
all computer-controlled.

129
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,742
A nerve gas was released
into the house.

130
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,331
"Primary effect of the gas"--

131
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,376
complete unconsciousness
lasting anything up to four hours.

132
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,046
Secondary effects are varied,
but can include acute memory loss.

133
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,048
- For how long?
- Subjective.

134
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,008
An hour, day, week.

135
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,427
So you're saying
this place was attacked?

136
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:45,806
I'm afraid things are
a little more complicated than that.

137
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,935
Sir! We've breached the Hive.

138
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,655
J.D.

139
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,309
Got it.

140
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,948
Halon content has dissipated.

141
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:07,846
Makes it easier to work underground,
thinking there's a view.

142
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:31,453
Looks like we're taking the stairs.

143
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,716
- Status.
- Red Queen is locked onto us.

144
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,718
She knows that we're here.

145
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,680
Who's the Red Queen?

146
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,682
State-of-the-art
artificial intelligence.

147
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,601
She is the computer
that controls the Hive.

148
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:11,201
This is gonna slow us down.

149
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:14,705
Our route to the Queen
takes us straight through these labs.

150
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:18,041
Rain, J.D., see how bad
the flooding is.

151
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,502
Kaplan, find us
an alternate route.

152
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,007
What happened here?

153
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,139
Five hours ago,
Red Queen went homicidal.

154
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,183
Sealed the Hive
and killed everyone down here.

155
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,518
-Jesus.
- When we realized what was happening...

156
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,854
my team was dispatched
to shut her down.

157
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,230
Why did she do it?

158
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,858
That we don't know.

159
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:46,111
But outside interference
is a possibility.

160
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:47,529
Jesus!

161
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:04,296
Hey. You okay?

162
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:10,427
- Here.
- No.

163
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:11,929
- I'm fine.
- Please, come on.

164
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,388
It's cold in here.

165
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,774
Are you--

166
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:31,782
Do you remember anything
from before this?

167
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:37,996
No. Nothing before the train.

168
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,708
And you?

169
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:46,004
No. Nothing.

170
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,008
I found an alternate route,
but it's gonna cost us time.

171
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:53,679
We double back,
cut through Dining Hall B...

172
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,556
then we're right on track.

173
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,824
Sir, no go.
The whole level's flooded.

174
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,493
All right,
we're behind schedule.

175
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,662
So let's move it.

176
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,669
Come on.

177
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,553
Poor bastards.

178
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,685
Dining Hall B.

179
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:26,188
That's what it says on the map.

180
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,482
Maybe you're reading it wrong.

181
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:32,110
Maybe the corporation's
keeping a few secrets down here.

182
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,820
Something you're
not supposed to see.

183
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:38,200
J.D., you and Rain keep the prisoner
here and secure the exit.

184
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:41,203
Sir, halon levels
are nonexistent in this room.

185
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,705
I think the system malfunctioned.

186
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,250
All right.
There may be survivors.

187
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,293
Give me a search line,
but keep it tight.

188
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,590
Move it.

189
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:48,270
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.

190
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,817
I'm not sure I want to remember
what went on down here.

191
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,490
I don't blame you.

192
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:02,493
What do they keep in these things?

193
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,870
How do I know?

194
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,396
What's taking so long?

195
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,901
Red Queen's defenses are in place.
She's making it difficult.

196
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:41,490
Let's pack it up.

197
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:56,171
You stay here.

198
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,749
The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.

199
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,479
- Transmitter in position.
- "Roger."

200
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:56,648
Running the bypass.

201
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,961
Checkmate.

202
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:27,930
Move up.

203
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:37,022
- What is that?
- That's what will shut the Queen down.

204
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,024
Delivers a massive
electrical charge.

205
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,193
Scrambles the mainframe
and forces it to reboot.

206
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:53,956
Some kind of dormant
defense mechanism.

207
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,707
- Opening the door tripped it.
- "Put it back to sleep."

208
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,042
Working on it.

209
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:03,173
- Would you open that door now, please?
- I'm trying.

210
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:06,260
Hold your positions.
Everyone stay calm.

211
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:07,761
What's that?

212
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,098
- Kaplan, quick!
- We gotta get them out of there!

213
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,559
- Kaplan, you've gotta hurry!
- Come on!

214
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,103
Down! Get down!

215
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:20,607
- Look out! Something's killing them!
-Jesus! Come on, man.

216
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,067
Don't do this to me!

217
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,237
Medic! Medic!

218
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,039
- Open the door!
- Open this door!

219
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:38,333
- I am trying.
- Stay conscious.

220
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,419
You're going into shock.
Stay awake!

221
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:44,381
- I am almost there.
- Sir! It's coming back!

222
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,049
- Open the door!
- I'm trying!

223
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,342
Well, try harder!

224
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,261
It's coming back!

225
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:00,439
Oh, God!

226
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,983
-Just do it!
- I'm almost there.

227
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,610
Come on!

228
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:08,489
- Shit!
- Got it.

229
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:35,724
All right.

230
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,267
Let's do it.

231
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:39,978
Do what?

232
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:42,314
We have to complete the mission.

233
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,358
There is no way
I'm going down there.

234
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,861
Her defenses are down.

235
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,863
Dj vu, anyone?

236
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,552
Keep going.

237
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,755
Give me a hand.

238
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:47,564
Get out! Get out!
You can't be in here.

239
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,399
Don't listen
to anything she says.

240
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,693
She's a holographic
representation of the Red Queen.

241
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,320
You have to get out!

242
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,572
Modeled after
the head programmer's daughter.

243
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,866
She'll try to deceive us,
confuse us.

244
00:35:57,908 --> 00:36:02,454
I wouldn't advise this. Disabling me
will result in loss of primary power.

245
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:05,707
She'll say anything to stop us
from shutting her down.

246
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:08,043
I implore you.

247
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:11,713
- Implore away.
- "Please?"

248
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:14,925
Please?

249
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:18,929
You're all going to die down here.

250
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,118
That pulse forces the circuit breaker to
shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds.

251
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,288
After that, if I don't have
her board, she can reboot.

252
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,008
They're late.

253
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,310
I'm on it.

254
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,694
J.D., we got a survivor!

255
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:40,904
It's okay.
We're here to help.

256
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,950
You seem to be in some serious--

257
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:51,540
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

258
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,711
J.D., get her off of me
before I stab her ass!

259
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,133
Are you okay?

260
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:05,470
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk clean right out of me.

261
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:08,557
Stay down.

262
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:11,226
I'm warning you, stay down!

263
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,394
She's crazy.

264
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:16,857
Come any closer, and I'll fire.

265
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,235
I mean it!

266
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:23,489
Damn you.

267
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:47,596
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?

268
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,681
Bitch isn't standing now.

269
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:58,148
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.

270
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:02,528
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed. She bit me.

271
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:06,281
She's gone. She's gone!

272
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,076
That's bullshit!

273
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,870
She fell right here,
but she's gone!

274
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:15,749
Look, look at this.

275
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,293
There's blood,
but it's not much.

276
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:22,005
Looks like it's coagulated.

277
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:26,009
- Yeah.
- It's not possible.

278
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:27,219
Why not?

279
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:32,391
Because blood doesn't do that
till after you're dead.

280
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,226
Can we go now?

281
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:37,729
We're not going anywhere
till the rest of the team get here.

282
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:46,572
- There's no one else coming.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

283
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:48,073
Wait.

284
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,076
Quiet.

285
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,654
Fuck!

286
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:30,407
Don't come any closer!
They're behind us.

287
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,826
Jesus!

288
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:35,913
They're everywhere.

289
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,957
They're everywhere.
They're all around us.

290
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,024
I said stay back!

291
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,993
Why aren't they dying?

292
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:26,588
Watch the tank! The tank!

293
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:36,014
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

294
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:37,808
- Wait!
- Come on, let's go!

295
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:39,685
- Move!
- Keep moving! Come on!

296
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,816
Move!

297
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:00,038
I can help you get the virus.

298
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:04,084
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

299
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:23,854
Shit!

300
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:33,238
- We lost the others!
- Keep moving!

301
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,333
- You waited?
- Didn't know the code.

302
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:46,168
Come on, come on.

303
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,920
- Shit!
- Come on.

304
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:03,519
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

305
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,354
- Come on, man.
- Shit!

306
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:08,774
- What's taking so long?
- I'm trying!

307
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,501
Come on.

308
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,422
- Move! What's the code?
- Hurry up!

309
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:34,091
I'm running out of ammo!

310
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:36,885
Zero, four, three, two--
No, five!

311
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:39,721
- What?
- Zero, four, three--

312
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:41,932
- What is the code?
- Zero, four...

313
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:44,560
zero, three, one...

314
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:46,603
nine, six, five.

315
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:50,357
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?

316
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:53,068
- Shit!
-J.D., no!

317
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,657
Grab my hand, man!
Come on!

318
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,909
Don't let go!

319
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:12,171
-J.D.!
- Rain!

320
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:04,097
Where are the bodies?
Where did they go?

321
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:05,098
Fuck!

322
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,854
Whatever they are,
there's too many of them out there.

323
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:14,817
Whatever they are?
It's pretty obvious what they are.

324
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,487
Lab coats, badges.
Those people used to work here!

325
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,989
All the people working here
are dead.

326
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:24,034
Well, that isn't stopping them
from walking around.

327
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:27,663
Well, where did they come from?
Why didn't we see them on the way in?

328
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:30,457
When you cut the power,
you unlocked the doors.

329
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,917
You let them out.

330
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:44,638
We're never gonna make it
to the surface.

331
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:47,970
You are security operatives.

332
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:51,014
Security operatives placed there
to protect that entrance.

333
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,486
I've got one in the breech
and an extra mag.

334
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,180
Lisa?

335
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:47,668
I can help you get the virus.

336
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:51,964
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

337
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,757
But?

338
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:55,884
- "But there's gonna be a price."
- "Name it."

339
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:06,770
- Who was she?
- My sister.

340
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:19,158
Corporations like Umbrella
think they're above the law.

341
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:22,744
But they're not.

342
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:29,585
There are hundreds of thousands
of us who think the same...

343
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:31,587
all over the world.

344
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,092
Some of us provide information...

345
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,013
others give their support.

346
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:44,433
Some take more direct action.

347
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,185
Like you.

348
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:50,230
If your friends had been
a little more thorough...

349
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,858
they would've seen
right through my false I D.

350
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:57,654
Then all the red flags
would've gone off--

351
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:01,783
Quantico, NSA, ViCAP,
all the rest.

352
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:06,121
There's no way
I could've infiltrated the Hive.

353
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:09,458
So you sent your sister.

354
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:15,797
We needed something concrete.

355
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:18,800
Anything to expose Umbrella
to the press.

356
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:21,845
Proof of the research
that was going on down here.

357
00:54:22,596 --> 00:54:24,556
What kind of research?

358
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,475
The illegal kind.

359
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,311
Genetic.

360
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:32,189
Viral.

361
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,486
My sister was going to smuggle out...

362
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:40,322
a sample of the virus
they were developing.

363
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:46,119
So how was she
going to make it out of here?

364
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:50,999
She had a contact within the Hive,
someone I never met.

365
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:56,046
They had access to security codes,
surveillance, everything she needed.

366
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,423
So why didn't she make it?

367
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:02,052
Maybe she trusted
the wrong person.

368
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:06,223
Maybe they set her up.

369
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:08,767
Kept the virus for themselves.

370
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:14,106
Do you know how much the T-virus
would be worth on the open market?

371
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:18,861
- What, worth all this?
- Yeah.

372
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:21,196
To someone.

373
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:29,872
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

374
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:33,250
- Close that door!
- They're right behind us!

375
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:37,588
Get off!. Get off!.

376
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:38,964
Stop it!

377
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:43,427
Son of a bitch!

378
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,471
- You okay?
- Yeah.

379
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:49,474
Right behind us.
What about this door?

380
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:53,979
- They're waiting out there too.
- And that way?

381
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:57,608
It's a dead end. There's no way
out of the Queen's chamber.

382
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:58,901
So we wait.

383
00:55:58,984 --> 00:56:02,905
If someone doesn't hear from you,
they'll send backup or something.

384
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:04,072
Right?

385
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:09,578
What? What's wrong?

386
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:13,040
We don't have much time.

387
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,125
You know those blast doors
we passed...

388
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:17,169
on the way in from the mansion?

389
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:19,171
They seal shut
in just under an hour.

390
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:23,383
If we're not out of here by then,
we're not getting out.

391
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:26,762
What are you talking about?
They can't just bury us alive down here.

392
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:34,770
Containing the incident
is the only fail-safe plan they had...

393
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:38,106
against possible contamination.

394
00:56:40,651 --> 00:56:44,446
And you're only telling us this now,
when we're trapped...

395
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,365
half a mile underground?

396
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:49,159
We have to find a way
out of this room.

397
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:52,454
What are you doing?

398
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:59,503
- Where are you taking those?
- I'm turning her back on.

399
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:02,506
- That is not a good idea.
- She'll know a way out of here.

400
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,805
That homicidal bitch
killed my team.

401
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:13,058
That homicidal bitch
may be our only way out of here.

402
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:17,229
Considering the way she's being treated,
I'm sure she'll be happy to help us out.

403
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:19,398
That circuit breaker
you were talking about.

404
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:20,983
- Can you bypass it?
- Yeah.

405
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:22,484
So do it.

406
00:57:29,158 --> 00:57:31,493
All right,
circuit breaker is disabled.

407
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:35,122
This time if I hit the switch,
she won't be able to shut down.

408
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:36,498
She's gonna fry.

409
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:42,087
Kaplan?

410
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,256
The initial charge
must have damaged her boards.

411
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:45,799
Ah, there you are.

412
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:49,845
Things, I gather,
have gone out of control.

413
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:53,473
Give me that fucking switch right now.
I'm gonna fry your ass.

414
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,726
I did warn you, didn't I?

415
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,020
Tell us what's going on down here.

416
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:00,147
Research and development.

417
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,940
What about the T-virus?

418
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:05,444
"The T"-"virus was"
a major medical breakthrough...

419
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:10,991
although it clearly also possessed
highly profitable military applications.

420
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:13,035
How does it explain
those things out there?

421
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:16,246
Even in death, the human body
still remains active.

422
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,248
Hair and fingernails
continue to grow.

423
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:20,751
New cells are produced...

424
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:23,837
and the brain itself
holds a small electrical charge...

425
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:26,715
that takes months to dissipate.

426
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,343
"The T"-"virus"
provides a massive jolt...

427
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:31,386
both to cellular growth...

428
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:34,389
and to those trace
electrical impulses.

429
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:36,350
Put quite simply...

430
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:38,894
it reanimates the body.

431
00:58:38,936 --> 00:58:41,230
It brings the dead back to life?

432
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:42,856
Not fully.

433
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,610
The subjects have
the simplest of motor functions.

434
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:50,405
Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.

435
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:53,158
They are driven by
the basest of impulses...

436
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:55,494
the most basic of needs.

437
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:56,662
Which is?

438
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:58,497
The need to feed.

439
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:05,045
How do you kill them?

440
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:08,715
Severing the top of the spinal column
or massive trauma to the brain...

441
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,718
are the most effective methods.

442
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:14,471
You mean shoot them in the head.

443
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:16,473
Why did you kill
everybody down here?

444
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:20,310
"The T"-"virus escaped"
into the air conditioning system...

445
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:23,897
and an uncontrolled
pattern of infection began.

446
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:25,774
The virus is protean...

447
00:59:25,816 --> 00:59:29,403
changing from liquid to airborne
to blood transmission...

448
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,780
depending on its environment.

449
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:34,366
It's almost impossible to kill.

450
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:37,452
I couldn't allow it
to escape from the Hive...

451
00:59:37,536 --> 00:59:40,455
so I took steps.

452
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:43,834
- Steps.
- "You must understand."

453
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:47,296
Those who become infected,
I can't allow you to leave.

454
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:49,423
Whoa. We're not infected.

455
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:54,428
Just one bite, one scratch
from these creatures is sufficient...

456
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:58,056
and then you become one of them.

457
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,395
A check of my systems indicates
my main drive circuit breaker...

458
01:00:03,479 --> 01:00:05,606
has been disabled.

459
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:07,608
May I ask why?

460
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,152
Insurance.
We need a way out of here.

461
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:13,155
If you refuse to help at any time,
we flip the switch.

462
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:15,282
Understand?

463
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:27,044
After you.

464
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:38,764
What the hell is this place?

465
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:40,140
The utility tunnels.

466
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:43,560
They run underneath the Hive
for water, gas and power lines.

467
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:59,034
- It's been in here before.
- Keep moving.

468
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:01,954
-We're going around in circles.
-This is the route the computer gave us.

469
01:01:02,037 --> 01:01:04,498
- Why are you listening to her?
- Enough already!

470
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:08,168
We have no choice but to keep moving
'cause those things are right behind us.

471
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:16,885
That mesh isn't gonna hold.
Keep moving.

472
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:23,767
Jesus Christ! Hold it!
There's too many of them!

473
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:27,896
-Jesus!
- Fuck!

474
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:44,037
Up on the pipes.
Up on the pipes!

475
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:46,290
Quickly, everyone!

476
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:49,418
- Let's go!
- Come on! There's a way up!

477
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:51,128
Watch out! Keep 'em back!

478
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:54,965
Go on up! Move it!

479
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:00,637
Shit. Okay.

480
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:14,776
Get over here! There's too many of them!
Come on! Go, go, go!

481
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,069
Go on!

482
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:19,198
Go! Go! I can manage!

483
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:24,328
Gotcha!

484
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,076
Rain?

485
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:06,453
Rain.

486
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,621
What?

487
01:03:07,663 --> 01:03:10,457
We have to do something
about your wounds.

488
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,001
I'm fine.

489
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:16,296
I said I'm fine.

490
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,764
You like that, don't you?
Huh?

491
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:30,018
You like the way it tastes,
don't you?

492
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:34,231
Like the taste of that?

493
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,407
She was right.

494
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:48,704
We're all gonna die down here.

495
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:51,540
No. We're getting out.

496
01:03:51,582 --> 01:03:53,083
All of us.

497
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:39,254
Kaplan, are you okay?

498
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,980
Oh, God!

499
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,784
Hold on!

500
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:23,298
- Help him.
- I can't.

501
01:05:24,258 --> 01:05:26,635
- What are you waiting for?
- I can't focus!

502
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:31,682
I can't see!

503
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:40,399
- Kaplan, go up!
- Get up there!

504
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:42,818
You almost got it.
Keep going!

505
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:45,571
- Come on! Come on!
- You can do it!

506
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:48,657
You got it!

507
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:51,285
- Okay, Kaplan.
-Just stay there!

508
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:53,453
Hold on.
We're gonna come get you.

509
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:57,374
Cut this wire and throw it to him.
Then we can go get him.

510
01:05:57,457 --> 01:05:58,876
Hold on!

511
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,258
That's lucky.

512
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:10,679
I want you to go.

513
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:18,896
- We're not leaving you, Kaplan.
- Yes, you are.

514
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:23,192
You can't kill all of them.

515
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:26,028
And I'm not going anywhere.

516
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:28,822
I want you to go. Now!

517
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:30,032
Please.

518
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:32,034
Just do it.

519
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,913
Just do it now!

520
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,247
Please.

521
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,958
Go!

522
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:10,739
You're gonna have to work
for your meal!

523
01:07:42,354 --> 01:07:43,730
Come on.

524
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:55,993
Give me your arm.
Up over my shoulder.

525
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:58,495
Ready? There we go.

526
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:41,747
When I get out of here...

527
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:45,250
I think I'm gonna get laid.

528
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:48,754
Yeah. You might want to
clean up a little bit first.

529
01:08:57,429 --> 01:08:58,847
Hey, wait.

530
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:05,729
Are you okay?

531
01:09:52,651 --> 01:09:55,571
Blue for the virus.
Green for the antivirus.

532
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:03,120
- There's a cure.
- What are you talking about?

533
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:05,497
There's a cure.

534
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,917
The process can be reversed.

535
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:11,753
There's a cure!

536
01:10:11,837 --> 01:10:13,881
You're gonna be okay!

537
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:16,675
I was beginning to worry.

538
01:10:24,475 --> 01:10:26,935
This is where
they kept the T-virus.

539
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:30,606
How do you know all this?

540
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:35,444
Because I was gonna steal it.

541
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,449
I was your sister's contact.

542
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:44,953
- You betrayed her.
- I don't know.

543
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:47,956
- You caused all of this.
- I can't remember.

544
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,583
The truth.

545
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:52,461
I don't remember the truth.

546
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:27,496
I don't understand!

547
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:31,917
It's gone.

548
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,378
It's not there.

549
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:37,673
I can't.

550
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:40,092
I just can't.

551
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:41,635
It's over.

552
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,312
I can help you get the virus.

553
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:55,983
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

554
01:11:57,359 --> 01:11:59,403
But there's gonna be a price.

555
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:01,488
Name it.

556
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:06,451
You have to guarantee me that
you will bring this corporation down.

557
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:26,555
Spence?

558
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:47,367
Thank you.

559
01:12:57,294 --> 01:12:58,295
Spence?

560
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:27,199
We can still make it out of here.
Come with me.

561
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:33,038
We can have everything
we've ever wanted.

562
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:34,998
Money's out there waiting.

563
01:13:35,749 --> 01:13:38,752
You wouldn't believe how much.

564
01:13:38,836 --> 01:13:42,422
Is that how you thought
all my dreams were gonna come true?

565
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:44,883
Please.

566
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,886
I wouldn't want to shoot you.

567
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:50,556
Might need the bullets.

568
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:54,226
Back off.

569
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,607
I won't take any part in this.

570
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:02,776
Okay, but you can't just...

571
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:05,612
wash your hands of this.

572
01:14:05,654 --> 01:14:08,657
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.

573
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:11,410
I was trying to stop them.

574
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,329
You really believe that...

575
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:17,332
people like him...

576
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:19,835
will ever change anything?

577
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:23,380
Nothing...

578
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:26,300
ever changes.

579
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:29,803
Where is...

580
01:14:31,013 --> 01:14:32,431
the antivirus?

581
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:34,558
It's on the train...

582
01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:38,187
where you found me.

583
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,441
Couldn't have been standing
more than three feet from it.

584
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:46,278
I so nearly made it out.

585
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:53,619
Didn't realize that bitch of a computer
had defense systems outside the Hive.

586
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:57,956
In or out?

587
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,708
In...

588
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,293
or out?

589
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:03,045
I don't know what we had...

590
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:05,297
but it's over.

591
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:13,347
Back...

592
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:17,768
the fuck off.

593
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:31,073
I'm missing you already.

594
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:42,751
Your boyfriend's a real asshole.

595
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:42,960
He shot the locking mechanism out.

596
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,295
He shot the locking mechanism out.

597
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:50,092
I can't believe that son of a bitch
is gonna get away with this.

598
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:51,969
I don't think so.

599
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,724
I've been a bad, bad girl.

600
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:58,744
Oh, my God.

601
01:17:14,593 --> 01:17:17,012
What the fuck is that?

602
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:19,807
One of the Hive's
early experiments...

603
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:23,894
"produced by injecting the T"-"virus"
directly into living tissue.

604
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:26,897
The results were unstable.

605
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:31,068
Now that it has fed on fresh DNA,
it will mutate...

606
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:41,036
becoming a stronger,
faster hunter.

607
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,205
Great.

608
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:47,376
If you knew it was loose,
why didn't you warn us?

609
01:17:48,418 --> 01:17:51,505
'Cause she was saving it for us.

610
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:53,674
Isn't that right?

611
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:57,219
I didn't think any of you
would make it this far.

612
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:58,762
Not without infection.

613
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:02,432
Why didn't you tell us
about the antivirus?

614
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:04,476
This long after infection...

615
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,895
there's no guarantee
it would work.

616
01:18:08,522 --> 01:18:12,234
But there's a chance, right?

617
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:14,736
I don't deal in chance.

618
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:24,079
Fuck it.

619
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:36,800
No pressure, guys.

620
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:40,137
You require
"the four"-"digit access code."

621
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:45,267
I can give you the code,
but first you must do something for me.

622
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:48,270
- What do you want?
- "One of your group is infected."

623
01:18:48,353 --> 01:18:51,356
I require her life
for the code.

624
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,276
The antivirus
is right there on the platform.

625
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:56,695
- It's right there!
- "I'm sorry."

626
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:59,364
It's a risk I cannot take.

627
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:03,619
She's right.

628
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:05,412
It's the only way.

629
01:19:05,496 --> 01:19:07,581
You're gonna have to kill me.

630
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:13,754
Otherwise we all die down here.

631
01:19:20,844 --> 01:19:22,387
The glass is reinforced...

632
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:24,640
but it won't hold forever.

633
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:30,813
- Do it.
- No.

634
01:19:30,854 --> 01:19:32,356
- Get up.
-Just do it.

635
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,525
- Rain, please get up.
- Do it!

636
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:36,860
- "You don't have long to decide."
- Get up, please.

637
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:39,571
- You have no choice.
- "Kill her."

638
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:42,324
Kill her now.
You don't have any choice.

639
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:45,160
-Just do it now!
- I can't!

640
01:19:45,244 --> 01:19:47,037
- Please.
- "Do it."

641
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,497
- "Kill her."
-Just do it.

642
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,207
Kill her now!

643
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:54,336
Kill her!

644
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:27,619
The bitch wouldn't open the door,
so I had to fry her.

645
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:30,914
Move.

646
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:41,800
What the fuck was that?

647
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:43,802
It's a long story.

648
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:04,364
Start it up.

649
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:07,534
I'll get the virus.

650
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:44,863
I'm missing you already.

651
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:51,995
Okay, we're in business.

652
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:54,540
Full power.

653
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,750
We're leaving!

654
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:16,687
I don't want to be
one of those things...

655
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:22,317
walking around
without a soul.

656
01:22:24,027 --> 01:22:26,113
You won't.

657
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:28,157
When the time comes...

658
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:31,785
you'll take care of it.

659
01:22:33,662 --> 01:22:35,622
No one else is gonna die.

660
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:39,001
Okay?

661
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:49,261
Here.

662
01:23:52,825 --> 01:23:54,409
I'm not dead yet.

663
01:23:55,702 --> 01:23:58,080
I think I'll have that back.

664
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:03,836
I could kiss you, you bitch.

665
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:09,967
What's going on back there?

666
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:26,316
- Get us the fuck out of here!
- Any faster, we'll come off the rails!

667
01:25:42,559 --> 01:25:44,520
Open the doors!

668
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:09,419
Open the doors!

669
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:10,879
Now!

670
01:27:55,692 --> 01:27:58,278
I failed all of them.

671
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:02,407
I failed.

672
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:05,744
Listen to me.

673
01:28:05,828 --> 01:28:08,413
There is nothing else
you could've done.

674
01:28:08,497 --> 01:28:10,916
The corporation's guilty here,
not you.

675
01:28:10,999 --> 01:28:13,460
And we finally have the proof.

676
01:28:13,544 --> 01:28:15,838
That way Umbrella can't get--

677
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,340
get away with this.

678
01:28:22,136 --> 01:28:23,303
What is it?

679
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:28,559
You're infected,
but you're gonna be okay.

680
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:30,018
I'm not losing you.

681
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:39,778
Help!

682
01:28:39,862 --> 01:28:41,989
Help him.
What are you doing?

683
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:55,043
Matt!

684
01:28:55,794 --> 01:28:57,754
He's mutating.

685
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:02,468
I want him in the Nemesis Program.

686
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:07,431
Get off!.

687
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,892
What's happening?

688
01:29:15,606 --> 01:29:16,690
Matt!

689
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:36,752
I want her quarantined.

690
01:29:36,835 --> 01:29:40,005
Close observation
and a full series of blood tests.

691
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:44,510
Let's see if she's infected.

692
01:29:44,593 --> 01:29:47,012
Take her to
the Raccoon City facility.

693
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:50,057
Then assemble the team.

694
01:29:50,098 --> 01:29:52,643
We're reopening the Hive.

695
01:29:52,726 --> 01:29:55,145
I want to know
what went on down there.

696
01:29:56,605 --> 01:29:58,607
Just do it.

697
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:11,388
Who's in there?

698
01:31:14,224 --> 01:31:15,684
Let me out!

699
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:18,187
Let me out!

700
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:21,440
Who's in there?
