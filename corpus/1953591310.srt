1
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,864
Hello, Wyatt.
I have a few questions

2
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,102
before we complete your profile.

3
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,606
Okay.

4
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,113
Boxers or briefs?

5
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,882
Boxers?

6
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,545
Is your ass hairy?

7
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,647
Well, it's not.

8
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,886
I don't shave my ass
if that's what you mean.

9
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,258
One last question.

10
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,957
Would you rather bang a guy
or get banged by a guy?

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,022
What?
I'm not answering that!

12
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,195
So banged in the ass!

13
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,533
I must be hearing things.

14
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,184
Yeah, the summer sun's gone.

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,059
So what do I do?

16
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,793
Tryin' to move on,
I found someone new.

17
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,927
But it's not you,
no, it's not you.

18
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,134
And misery lives
down Memory Lane.

19
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,905
When I go down the road
always feel the same.

20
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,004
'Cause I miss you,
yeah, I miss you.

21
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:50,283
To be without you
would be pain defined.

22
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,916
And she might?

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,656
Still have the magic
in her eyes.

24
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,397
The magic.

25
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,197
She might?

26
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:09,434
Still have the magic
in her eyes.

27
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,711
The magic.

28
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,302
In her eyes.

29
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,452
Sitting in the room
under candlelight.

30
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,086
Thinking you will never
find your Mr. Right.

31
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,325
But it's not true,
no, it's not true.

32
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,800
And you can be my princess,
I'll be your knight.

33
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,499
My armor might be dirty
but my love still shines.

34
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:46,032
Yes, it shines through,
yeah, it still shines through.

35
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:52,847
To be with you
is happiness defined.

36
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,319
And she might?

37
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:00,256
Still have the magic
in her eyes.

38
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,895
The magic.

39
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,795
She might?

40
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,301
Still have the magic
in her eyes.

41
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,497
Wipe it off. So dirty.

42
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,132
Oh, so dirty. Wipe it.

43
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,236
Oh oh. Slow down.

44
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,145
Oh oh oh yeah.

45
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,946
Oh, too much for me to handle
I just...

46
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,218
Okay, oh yes.
I'm open for a little negotiating.

47
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,522
Ready for this? This is what
we've been training for, buddy.

48
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,722
Ready?
Here we go, buddy.

49
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,236
You pack up that
little thumbtack of yours

50
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:53,004
and haul it on out of here
before I snap it off!

51
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,870
This whole miniature golf course
is calling our names.

52
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,607
Let's finish off this hole
so I can whup your ass!

53
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,876
Oh, you wanna bet?

54
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,509
Hey, it was my turn anyway!
See, that's what you get.

55
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,180
I'm gonna bounce you out.
Oh, look at me, I just gave it to you

56
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,621
I still give you the game,
just like when you were little!

57
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,625
You need to find a nice girl
Maybe that'll cook for you

58
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,561
and stop eating
all that fast food, okay?

59
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,860
You know I go on
a lot of nice dates,

60
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,162
but... I don't know.
We're having a party tonight

61
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,067
and maybe I'll meet the one.

62
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,936
What do you want?
You're almost 30 years old, Wyatt.

63
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,271
You need to find yourself a girl
There's a reason why

64
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,607
somebody's not married by
the time they're 30 years old.

65
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,544
- Yeah? Why's that?
- Because they're fucking nuts!

66
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,414
You don't want to be 40 and fat
and bald and not have somebody

67
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,645
I mean, hey,
everybody wants to get some,

68
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,713
but, you know... not everybody
can be Van Halen, you know.

69
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,656
Huh? Van Halen?

70
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,591
Yeah, guys that get some.

71
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,858
No, they're all rock stars
and all bald by now, okay?

72
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,331
They're not getting
any at all, so there.

73
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,868
They may be bald,
but they've got bigger dicks than me.

74
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,828
Yes, I know.
I've changed your diapers, okay?

75
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,737
- I know what it's like...
- Oh ho ho!

76
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,208
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I know you're not blessed.

77
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,108
- You are not gifted, okay?
- Wow.

78
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,192
It's hard to believe that.

79
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,989
- Hey.
- Whassup, girl?

80
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,996
Are you the guy with the stuff?

81
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,054
Ha, no. I am not.

82
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,362
There's a guy upstairs... Asian guy.

83
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,528
He's got the stuff
you're probably looking for.

84
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,538
Feel free to look around
check it out.

85
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,631
- Cool, thanks.
- Do it.

86
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,176
Do it.

87
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,474
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

88
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,245
- Big time, man.
- The party's a little out of control?

89
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,309
Dude, what are you worried about?
Look at this.

90
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,754
They're chilling, they're all having
a good time. It's a party.

91
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,018
- You know what a party is, right?
- I do.

92
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,526
Don't worry about it.
I got your house unlocked.

93
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,085
We're good.
We're good. I'll be back.

94
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,222
That scares me the most.

95
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,103
Hi, is this your house?

96
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,633
- Yeah.
- You want to show me around?

97
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,203
- Uh...
- Hey, Ange, leave him alone, okay?

98
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,215
You can't have every guy.

99
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,217
We'll see about that.

100
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,244
Okay, bye-bye.

101
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,553
Hey, Angie, go find Kevin.

102
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,616
He's the, uh

103
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,059
dirty Asian guy.

104
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,594
- Your friend is a lucky man.
- Really?

105
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,795
You gotta do this to me.

106
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:09,067
After all is said and done.

107
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,632
Can we go back
to where we've begun?

108
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,042
- Hey!
- Hey-yyy.

109
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,375
Hi.

110
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,746
- Are you Kevin?
- Well, if you're asking

111
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,910
for the double-wide over there
then no, I'm Jason.

112
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,288
I'm the one who's asking.

113
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,791
Well, then you found me.

114
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,589
You're kinda cute.

115
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,426
Thanks.
You know I exfoliate

116
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,693
and drink a lot of water...
what do you mean kinda?

117
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,065
How about you show me
around your house?

118
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,266
And what about you?

119
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,739
Hmm, I'm sorry
I have morals.

120
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,006
That's good, because I was just
about to give up on your kind.

121
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,105
- Oh, off to the dark side, are we?
- "Dark side."

122
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,406
Now that's funny

123
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,877
I always get the worm,

124
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,719
in more ways than one.

125
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,123
I... I...

126
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,968
Are you gonna offer me
some of that drink?

127
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,370
Yeah, I'm... shit, I'm sorry
I'm not a very good host.

128
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,672
Yeah, it totally confused me, because
normally gay guys are great hosts.

129
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,978
- Let's play a game.
- Okay okay.

130
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,682
First one to scream
takes a bodyshot.

131
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,622
Uh, okay.

132
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,687
- Here's one.
- That was a...

133
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,357
okay, I guess it is my turn, huh?

134
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,526
Uh-huh.
Suck it up, stud.

135
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,035
- Can I have that...
- Yeah yeah.

136
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,868
What the fuck?

137
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,241
- How about another one?
- I don't like this game.

138
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,439
- Go on!
- Well, I guess it's not that bad.

139
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,311
- The game is...
- Oh yeah.

140
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,556
Oh fuck!

141
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,717
What, you can't hold
your liquor, you pussy?

142
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,488
What? I wish your face
was your pussy.

143
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,688
Uh-huh

144
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,062
I want you inside me

145
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,623
I don't have a condom.

146
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,363
- I don't care, go in me.
- Okay.

147
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,033
That's... this... oh.

148
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,373
- That's the ticket.
- Ow. Where are you?

149
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,213
You're not inside me.

150
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,645
- What are you fucking?
- Uh, it's these sheets.

151
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,814
They must be
a nice 1,000-thread count

152
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,221
I mean, it felt good?

153
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,259
I'm taking over.

154
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,453
Oh, okay.

155
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,266
- Oh yeah?
- Baby, I like it.

156
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,165
Oh yeah?
How about this?

157
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,193
Much better.

158
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,968
- Is that?
- Huh, how do you like that?

159
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,441
You little bitch!

160
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,875
You like that?

161
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,541
Dude...

162
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,844
- Dude?
- What's up, fuckers?

163
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,353
Has this stoner been
in here the entire time?

164
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,719
Hey, man, can I get in
on some of this?

165
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,520
Dude, what the hell
are you doing here?

166
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,959
My mom had blonde hair too,
just like yours.

167
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,759
In fact my dad was
Asian too, I think.

168
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,135
Are you a real blonde?

169
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,228
Get the hell out of here!

170
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,034
All right, all right, chill out.

171
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,097
All right, so, uh

172
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,574
hey, forget it.

173
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,943
Hey, I love you assholes.
Remember that, all right?

174
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:36,701
You need a beat?
Catch me in the hood.

175
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:37,840
You need a beat?
Catch me in the hood.

176
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,504
See me in the street,
I got what you want

177
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,745
I got what you need,
I'm in the black Lexus.

178
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,218
Oh my God, get it off me!

179
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,084
Oh my God!

180
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,181
Dude, what the fuck
do you have all over you?

181
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,692
- And what's that smell?
- Dude, I was fucking that chick...

182
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,660
thank you, by the way
She's awesome.

183
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,391
And we were going at it so good and I
was fucking her reverse cowboy, right?

184
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,399
Like she was turned around
her ass facing you.

185
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,296
Yeah, I know what
the reverse cowboy is, Kevin!

186
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,684
All right, well, anyway,
I must have been doing her so good?

187
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,139
Because all I remember
is she was screaming

188
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,833
and I looked down

189
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,501
dude, it's everywhere!

190
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,172
- In my bed?!
- And all over me. It's everywhere!

191
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,579
It's everywhere.

192
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,016
Oh, are you just gonna
stay in bed all day?

193
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,020
Or are you gonna do
something productive?

194
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,489
Gimme a break. I didn't get home
from the bar until 4:00 in the morning.

195
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,389
Yeah, I know.

196
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,292
But I think that if you just
wake up a little earlier,

197
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,332
- you might get more stuff done.
- Yeah, and do what?

198
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,766
Let's see, clean the pool,
fix the barbecue!

199
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,899
I am having a bachelorette party
here this weekend.

200
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,644
I'm up now.
Are you happy?

201
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,738
Why do you always
have to wait till the last minute

202
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,339
to do everything?

203
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,441
Okay, I'll do it now.

204
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,419
But we have to have
a little fun time first.

205
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,149
Yeah?

206
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,782
Come on, we haven't touched
each other in a month.

207
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,986
So jack off!
No one's stopping you.

208
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,030
- No kiss bye?
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,198
Love you.

210
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,073
Thanks for coming.

211
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,371
- You've always been there for me.
- Of course.

212
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,540
- You know you're my best friend.
- I know.

213
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,482
- You have it?
- Oh yeah!

214
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,520
- Ta-da!
- Nice box.

215
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,580
She definitely would have found that.

216
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,682
Yeah, that would have been funny

217
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,385
Wyatt, this is a huge step.

218
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,330
It's big.

219
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,367
Yeah, I know, but...

220
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,404
I mean, it sounds like
you don't like the idea.

221
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,632
No no, it's not that
She's great.

222
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,038
Well then what?

223
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,905
I'm not going to be able
to make it to dinner tonight?

224
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,275
Yes, you will.
Just bring your dickhead boyfriend.

225
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,177
- Hey!
- All right, but seriously though.

226
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,547
I need you more than ever,
so I really need you to be there.

227
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,745
- More than ever, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,189
- Okay.
- Did you hear that Kevin got caught

229
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,091
- spanking it, looking at those girls?
- Ugh, yes, I did.

230
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,061
Kevin! He's such a perv.

231
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,461
What an idiot!

232
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,830
You make me.

233
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,497
Smile.

234
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:20,068
You make me.

235
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,703
Cry

236
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,777
I like.

237
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,150
You.

238
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,247
- You fool.
- Yay!

239
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,058
Thank you,
Uncle Kenny.

240
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,254
- Oh, you're welcome.
- Thank you, Uncle Kenny.

241
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,593
That was... quite entertaining.

242
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,532
You know he

243
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,432
just came back
from Palm Springs

244
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,438
from the gay and lesbian rally
to be here at this dinner.

245
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,667
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

246
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,766
You really mean the world
to Katie and me.

247
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,971
Oh, Wyatt, that's sweet!

248
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,446
Don't forget to wipe
from front to back when you pee.

249
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,780
Shut up, Kev, before I wipe you
from front to back.

250
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,447
As you all know, Katie and I have been
dating for a while.

251
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,083
And although we've had
our differences from time to time,

252
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,889
I think that

253
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,930
love brings us through.

254
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,592
When you find someone
who can be your true friend

255
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,862
to love and cherish

256
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,528
how else can you go wrong?

257
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,869
It's like the cosmos

258
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,000
almost align and there's like
a nuclear reaction.

259
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,637
I have something to say.

260
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,211
Miss Katie Elizabeth Jones,

261
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,311
will you marry me?

262
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,589
Um.

263
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,855
Wait, Wyatt. Can we talk?

264
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,520
Can't we talk about it right here,

265
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,586
in front of all of our family?

266
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,496
Okay

267
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,501
I just, um

268
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,932
I'm not... I'm not
ready for marriage.

269
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,976
- Oh shit, I knew this was gonna happen.
- Why?

270
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,773
- Shut up, Kevin.
- I just...

271
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,178
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

272
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,943
This is worse than
the ending of "Beaches."

273
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,350
Now that's fucking funny!

274
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,357
I'm gonna get a drink
Who needs a refill?

275
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,226
You're a jerk, Paul.
Maybe you should

276
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,890
just skip the refill and go home

277
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,831
I haven't laughed in years
Are you kidding me?

278
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,163
This is funny

279
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,868
Katie, I don't understand

280
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,540
I can't marry you

281
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,548
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,112
Dunbrook and Balcrest, please.

283
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:52,984
Hey, check this out,
the amazing girls of Brazil,

284
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,397
Hey, check this out,
the amazing girls of Brazil,

285
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,365
one of the erotic centers
of the world.

286
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,502
We have traveled the globe

287
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,506
to bring you the real girls
of the world.

288
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,838
- They're life-sized.
- Good dog.

289
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,208
You'll never leave me, will you, baby?

290
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,781
Engagement ring?

291
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,283
The exclusive celebration diamond..

292
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,047
Don't do it, you fucking idiot!

293
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,987
- Jared's most exclusive.
- Just break your heart.

294
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,490
Come on, girl.
Let's get out of here.

295
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,792
Visit us downtown
in the heart of Austin.

296
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,634
Mopping around isn't gonna
help anything, okay?

297
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,829
It's like... it's like
my dad always says.

298
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,305
A setback is a set-up
for a great comeback.

299
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,371
It's good!

300
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,503
Yeah, it's good.
It's really good, right?

301
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,548
You gotta get back
on that horse, right?

302
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,207
And do some mounting
of your own, man.

303
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,275
Stick it in some random chick's ass
They love that shit.

304
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,617
If she's super freaky, dude,

305
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,748
she will lick
that shit right off.

306
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,019
But if she does,
I'm telling you, do not

307
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,527
kiss her afterwards.

308
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,325
Dude, what is
with you and anal?

309
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,198
And do you really think your freaky
sex bullshit is helping the situation?

310
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,827
- I think what he needs...
- Alone time

311
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,565
is what I need.

312
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,665
No anal, no hot lunches
in my mouth,

313
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,300
no nothing!

314
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,174
Got it? Got it?

315
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,645
- Yes, fine.
- Okay.

316
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,046
Whatever, dude. We just want
to see you happy again, all right?

317
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,345
- That's it.
- Really we miss you.

318
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,683
- We miss the old Wyatt.
- The old me?

319
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,847
Yes! The one who's
larger than life, man.

320
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,857
Yeah. And, you know,

321
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,859
when the time's right,
you'll meet the one.

322
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,122
My confidence is gone.

323
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,960
Well, figure it out, man,
because you look like a pile of shit.

324
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,025
Okay, waffles
for Miss Cutie Pie.

325
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:43,005
Cherry pie and waffles
for Mr. Sad Eyes.

326
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,200
Thank you.

327
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,845
Scrambled eggs and sausage
for Master Panda Bear.

328
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,403
Mm-hmm, you know!

329
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,675
Thank you.

330
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,410
You're welcome, sugar.

331
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,213
You sure look cute today.

332
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,185
Oh, thanks.
It's a new shirt.

333
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,813
Boy, oh boy,
if I wasn't married, I'd take you home

334
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:03,621
and lick your bamboo stick
till it fell off.

335
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,127
Whoa!

336
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,357
With the sweet potato pie
in your ass...

337
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,458
eating good for a week.

338
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,335
So, dude, you booked
an Elvis commercial, man!

339
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,340
- Come on.
- An enema commercial

340
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,172
with Elvis impersonator.

341
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,712
Bam! And then it's gonna be
a national commercial

342
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,941
and you will get paid
like that chick. Right?

343
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,244
- Flo from the Progressive commercials.
- Right.

344
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,843
- I'm telling you, that girl makes bank.
- She's loaded.

345
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,479
Never have to worry
about it again. Besides,

346
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,388
Elvis is always cool, right?
Anytime,

347
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,791
anywhere, whomever,
how he got it.

348
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,524
Okay, but once again
Elvis impersonator,

349
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,463
okay?
Enema commercial

350
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,467
equals ridiculous.

351
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,671
I think it's pretty cool
I think you're gonna love it.

352
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,230
Well, you know what?
I gotta go.

353
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,037
No!
Sit down.

354
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,702
We're not done, okay?

355
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,647
What do you want from me?

356
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,843
We want you
to get over it, okay?

357
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,012
We're sick of you playing the victim
You need to move on.

358
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,157
- You know what they say?
- Hmm?

359
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,852
When you love someone,
let them go.

360
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,896
- And then if they come back.
- Then you know!

361
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,522
Then you know,
you know?

362
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,828
You know what?
If you guys believe that shit

363
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,631
- you're retarded.
- Come on.

364
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,261
We're just trying
to cheer you up, okay?

365
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,634
I love you all
See you later.

366
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,106
Don't be a baby.
You better kill that tomorrow.

367
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,410
Say, chief, think I could
get a Diet Coke?

368
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,542
Hey, look

369
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,174
if you don't
mind me asking

370
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,118
you seem like you're
a little down in the mouth.

371
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,020
No.

372
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,319
- It's just, uh...
- What is it? Come on.

373
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,054
Come on, you can talk to me
I got you covered, Sancho.

374
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,255
I don't know, man,
this is weird.

375
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,060
You know what's weird?

376
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,566
A man who's got sadness
in his heart

377
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,331
and ain't got no friends
to cut the track with?

378
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,934
That's weird.

379
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,975
Okay.

380
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,533
My girlfriend left me
when I proposed to her.

381
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,977
In front of everyone.

382
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,880
I'm kneeling down
with the ring in my hand

383
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,714
and she just leaves.

384
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,823
That's a bitch, man.

385
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,826
That's it?
That's a bitch, man"?

386
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,961
That's all you've got to say?

387
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,760
Well, what you want me to say?

388
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,302
Hey, Dad, I got something for you?

389
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,362
- Oh yeah? - Mm-hmm.

390
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,339
Let's see it.

391
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,510
Oh, my name is Wyatt.

392
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:17,918
And I'm a sissy
simpering boy.

393
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,479
My girlfriend left me.

394
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,549
All those months ago.

395
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,591
Ain't nothing
to do about it?

396
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,826
Except cry like the rain.

397
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,596
Don't want to talk to nobody.

398
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:37,164
Cause I like the pai-iiin.

399
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,171
Ahhh.

400
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,508
- That's all you got?
- That was it, baby.

401
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,911
All right

402
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,645
I'm not Elvis,
I'm a fraud and a loser.

403
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:52,120
Who assumes the identity
of an aging Vegas act?

404
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,455
Silly sassy boy
who ain't good.

405
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,927
At nothing at all.

406
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,932
Who's been acting
after all these years.

407
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,969
And still hasn't done jack shit.

408
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,733
Fat-ass Elvis, drugged up
can't-take-a-shit Elvis.

409
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,435
Wearing a jacket
that his mama made him.

410
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,273
My mama didn't make it
it's an original.

411
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,541
You little
Mark Wahlberg wannabe.

412
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,242
Ain't got no car,
drive a Pinto to set

413
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,650
I drive a Cadillac,
you little whiny brat.

414
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,657
Who probably takes dick
in the Walmart alley too...

415
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,489
What the hell's going on?
We're trying to set up a shot here.

416
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,290
- I need to replace you two?
- Sorry.

417
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,161
- No, no sir.
- All right, then shut the fuck up

418
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,291
I'm sorry, man.

419
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,892
It's all right, man
Me too. Me too.

420
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,077
I didn't mean that about your suit
It looks real nice.

421
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,933
I appreciate that. I didn't mean nothing
about the Walmart crack either.

422
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,112
So the director wants
you two on set in an hour.

423
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,671
So we're gonna be quick.

424
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,547
Hey, Wyatt

425
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,813
I didn't know you got
cast in this commercial.

426
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,219
What's up, Angie?
What are you doing here? Makeup, huh?

427
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,520
Well yeah, I've gotta get
a couple extra bucks.

428
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,857
- I'm gonna hightail my ass to Vegas.
- Yeah?

429
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,328
For work or for pleasure?

430
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,195
Oh...

431
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,426
you don't know.

432
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,959
- Know what?
- Katie moved back home.

433
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,301
No, I didn't know that.

434
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,806
How is she doing?

435
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,934
She's getting married.

436
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,877
A week after she got back
she met someone.

437
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,915
What happened to
she wasn't ready"? I mean,

438
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,144
when's the wedding?

439
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,345
In 37 hours?

440
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,952
Hey, I've gotta take this.

441
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,492
But if you need to talk

442
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,357
I'll be back
in a couple minutes, okay?

443
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,601
Oh my God!

444
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,198
Come here.
I know how you feel

445
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,801
I really do

446
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,777
I just wanted to tell you, man,

447
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,315
yours truly

448
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,544
I've been kicked down
a couple notches by love.

449
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,711
Believe me, man,
I've been kicked down

450
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,584
from Tupelo to Memphis.

451
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,215
Well, great.
That's you and your shit

452
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,021
and this is me and my shit.

453
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,085
And just because you got shit
doesn't mean my shit's better.

454
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,562
I still got shit!

455
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,327
Wyatt, listen.

456
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,199
You know those rare times

457
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:23,728
when you find someone...
that special someone...

458
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,741
and that someone special finds you,

459
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,777
and you're both drawn
to each other

460
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,143
and you get closer
and closer and you're like...

461
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,739
- like a set of magnets?
- Yeah, it's called attraction.

462
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,681
Exactly, except?

463
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,219
This ain't the good kind.

464
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,687
Huh-uh.
It's the bad kind.

465
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,781
It's the unsexy kind.

466
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,794
- You know what I mean?
- No.

467
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,558
Sometimes the ugly thing in you

468
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,292
is attracted to

469
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:52,028
the ugly thing in someone else.

470
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,969
It's like you got this little
asshole living inside you.

471
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:58,007
Mm-hmm, and... and...
and that little asshole

472
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,237
is just yearning to get
up out of you.

473
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:05,145
And she's got that little
asshole inside of her.

474
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,479
And then these two assholes,
they come together.

475
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,042
These two assholes come out
and they shake hands, man.

476
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,849
They kind of give
each other a little wink.

477
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,685
- Winking assholes?
- That's right.

478
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,657
Okay well, thanks for that
That's great.

479
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,561
See, Wyatt

480
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,295
what you see in her

481
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,566
is the same thing that...
that... that's busted

482
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,039
inside of you?

483
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,737
Okay?
And if you truly...

484
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,836
if you truly love that little girl

485
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,540
you know what you're gonna do?

486
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,742
<i>Mew“.</i>

487
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,421
You're gonna plug up
them winking assholes.

488
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,855
So you're saying
I should go get her?

489
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,824
Now you're talking, Jackson.

490
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,020
Let me tell you something.

491
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,890
We get one go-around
in this world, Wyatt.

492
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,434
- Okay?
- Right.

493
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,970
If it was me,
I'd want some goddamn answers.

494
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,336
Right? As opposed to sitting
around here bellyaching

495
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,238
like some little pansy-ass pussy.

496
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,038
Yeah, so I'm gonna go
to Vegas and win her back.

497
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,169
Now you're talking, Daddy-o
Now you're talking.

498
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,977
Hey, guys, so what's going on?

499
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,517
I'm gonna go
plug some assholes!

500
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,117
Are you sure he said to bring
something nice to wear?

501
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,163
- Like we're going to a wedding?
- That's what he said.

502
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,960
The only girl
he should marry is you

503
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,796
I've been telling him this

504
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,530
- ever since you grew boobies.
- Never gonna happen.

505
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,732
Well, if all you want is friendship

506
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,207
then I'm as straight as 6:00.

507
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,912
Cheese and rice.

508
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,006
- Tell me we're not hauling ass
all the way to Vegas...

509
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,379
- No!
- ...to watch him marry

510
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,749
this white-trash Barbie?

511
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,550
I mean ,I knew he was desperate,
but this is ridiculous!

512
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,648
There's no way
Wyatt's getting married.

513
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,160
No no no no no

514
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:03,165
I'm not going.
Wherever she's going, I'm not going

515
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,996
- if she's going.
- Relax.

516
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,593
- She's going and so are you.
- Don't touch my bag!

517
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,536
Do you remember
our little fiasco?

518
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,096
What are you guys
talking about?

519
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,768
No no, you don't need to know
Nobody-

520
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,368
don't ask, don't tell.

521
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,880
It's fine. I didn't feel
anything anyways.

522
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,178
You can deal with each other
for two days.

523
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,719
- Whatever.
- Fine.

524
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,154
- If you stay on your side of the RV.
- Done.

525
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,716
Guys, Katie's getting
married in 27 hours,

526
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:34,730
and we have to stop it. So let's
pull it together and get going, huh?

527
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:38,666
We're going a road trip, huh?
What are we waiting for?

528
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,101
Let's load up
Come on.

529
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,298
Okay, I guess.

530
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,272
Love you.

531
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,839
Oh Oh.

532
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,971
Wow.

533
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,982
- Dude... yeah.
- Nice.

534
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,211
It totally reminds me
of an '80s porno set.

535
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,048
You know, this couch is
really comfortable.

536
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,712
You wouldn't think so,
but it is.

537
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,815
Oh, we had some hot nights
in this RV.

538
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,826
Friggin' bananas.

539
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,793
No, I'm serious.

540
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,796
Oooh

541
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,924
I mean... I mean there was
lots of bananas in here

542
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,094
and we weren't going
to no gorilla farm,

543
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,638
if you know what
I'm talking about.

544
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,334
Let's get this cock wagon rolling!

545
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,137
Hmm?

546
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,769
Uncle Kenny, when was
the last time you drove this thing?

547
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,474
- It does run, right?
- Don't be silly.

548
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,110
Of course.
Let's see, it was Chicago,

549
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,178
the great
Lesbian Luncheon of 2006.

550
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,951
- Five years ago?
- Yeah.

551
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,357
But it is gonna start, right?

552
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,951
Don't be silly.

553
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,528
Why, that's funny.

554
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,593
My God!
I'm going to miss the wedding.

555
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,231
- I'm in the wedding.
- You are not gonna miss the wedding!

556
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,709
It's probably the stupid
battery or something.

557
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:58,145
We'll just open
that little engine thingy

558
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,513
and jump it.

559
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,811
What the fuck?

560
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,855
Oh, what the fuck was that?

561
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,048
<i>Mama,</i>

562
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,752
Oh my God,
we're gonna get the rabies.

563
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,226
Okay, ideas?
Who's got one?

564
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,229
I vote we take a frigging plane

565
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,662
I'm trying to remember...

566
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,722
what year was it we gave
the whores the vote?

567
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,166
- Oh, fuck you.
- Kevin.

568
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,603
- Not helping, dude.
- Rotten sack!

569
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,435
I know who to call.

570
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,943
- Who?
- It's this guy I used to date.

571
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,501
Skeeter.

572
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,740
Hey, Skeet,

573
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,306
how are you,
my little sugar lumpy?

574
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,553
Come here, you little
son of a bitch.

575
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,350
Easy, hey!

576
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,418
Get... you goddamn bitch
Get in, come here.

577
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,137
Ow!
Get it out!

578
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,433
Dear dear.

579
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,599
Get in there.
Hey, there you go!

580
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,165
Get in there.

581
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,869
Easy there, there you go
That's it.

582
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,914
Whoo, how you like that?

583
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,279
Whoo!

584
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,544
Whew.

585
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:12,247
Well, you are up and running.

586
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,256
- Whoa!
- This little son of a bitch

587
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,622
just did not want
to give up the fight.

588
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,683
Usually I can get in there

589
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,856
and wear them down a little bit
and then they just don't fight at all.

590
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,797
Pfft! Not this one!

591
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,426
He even look like he done
grown up into the engine.

592
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,801
He... he looked like
that scene from "The Fly"

593
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,739
when he has that pod sticking out
of the side of him like that.

594
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,538
He just looked like
a fucking Brundlecoon,

595
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,045
all wrapped up in the hoses
and wires and shit.

596
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:41,106
- I never seen it.
- Thanks for coming over, Skeeto!

597
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,846
Well, you called me,
I was like "Wha-aaaat?"

598
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,115
I can't believe he called me.

599
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,248
But I didn't know whether
to shit or go blind,

600
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,122
so I just closed one eye and farted.

601
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,753
So...

602
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,661
what say you and me put some
pizza rolls on the heater?

603
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,497
And see if we can't find ourselves
at the bottom of a bottle of moonshine?

604
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,662
- Sounds divine.
- It's a date then!

605
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,637
Make sure you get
your sweet ass

606
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,402
back home safe and sound
from Las Vegas.

607
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,467
I just jumped me the RV.
I'm figure on jumping on something else.

608
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,103
All right then,

609
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,148
well, I gotta get going
I know some Japs

610
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,682
who want to make
a noodle salad

611
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,513
outta this here
little troublemaker.

612
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,644
- That is disgusting.
- All right then.

613
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,347
I'll see you later
It's a date.

614
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,720
She says she's coming down
tonight.

615
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,487
Needs a place
to crash in town tonight.

616
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,689
Wants to know exactly
how I feel

617
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,161
I mumble underneath
my breath...

618
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,830
This is so much fun!
I love road trips.

619
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,103
Me too! Let's sing
some show tunes, huh?

620
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:42,975
Yes yes, let's sing show tunes
Show tunes show tunes!

621
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,139
Oh my God,
I know one too!

622
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,377
It goes,
Gay gay gay! Gay! Gay!

623
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,283
For fuck's sake, Kev.
Don't be such a 'phobe, huh?

624
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,686
- Yeah, Kevin.
- What? I just don't want

625
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,918
to hear fucking
show tunes all night.

626
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,119
So you think this
is a mistake?

627
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,684
- Chasing her?
- Yeah.

628
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,963
- I can't really say.
- Why not?

629
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:06,525
Well, Wyatt, I'm your friend
I would even say

630
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,696
- you're my best friend.
- Yeah, I'd say that too.

631
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,335
And we've been close for so long

632
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,003
but I can't tell you what to do here

633
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,014
I mean,
I can't take that responsibility

634
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,346
I won't put that on myself
if it goes the other way

635
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,750
- and I don't think you'd want me to.
- No, I...

636
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,583
you know, it's just...
I don't know.

637
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:29,181
I have so many questions.
What is it about me that made her leave?

638
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,659
I mean, what if it's a sign?

639
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,162
What if she leaves again?
I don't think I could bear that.

640
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:36,255
Do you love her?

641
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,566
Yeah. I mean,
I'm miserable without her.

642
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,606
You invested a lot
of yourself in her.

643
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:47,438
I mean, all this has to go right
or it's just a big waste of time.

644
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,535
But do you think that
equals love?

645
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,877
Or do you think that's just
missing something, you know?

646
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,474
So you're saying this is
a big waste of time?

647
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,077
Never said that, Wyatt.
I just want you to be sure

648
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,281
I don't want you to get hurt again.

649
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:03,292
Yeah, man, I think
Ellen's right, you know?

650
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,919
I don't think anybody
wants you to get hurt again.

651
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,430
Right? Because when you are,
you act like a fucking bitch

652
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,295
and I don't know how much
more of it I can take.

653
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,562
Okay? So what we're gonna do...
this is the plan:

654
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,694
you're gonna go punch
the groom in the dick,

655
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,932
take her back,
quit being a douche, act normal,

656
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,497
and then you're gonna knock her up

657
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,236
and squeeze out a bunch
of other little douches.

658
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,572
- Fucking A!
- Right?

659
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,908
Because I'll be damned
if I'm gonna ride in this box

660
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,641
with the frigging
show-tunes twins here,

661
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,649
featuring Bob the Knob
and Loosey Bowels,

662
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,481
and a cheap-ass episode
of "Dr. Phil" going on back here.

663
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,350
So what do you want?

664
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,913
- A fucking beer!
- I can make that happen.

665
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,686
- Holla!
- That's nothing.

666
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,750
Get it

667
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,888
Uncle Kenny, can we please
get Kevin some beer?

668
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,092
Because he's gonna drive me
crazy and this is gonna be

669
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,635
- a really long trip without it.
- Yeah, sure.

670
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,376
Excellent.

671
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,708
Bath rooms?

672
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,679
Yeah, right over there to the left.

673
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,444
- I gotta pay a visit.
- Yes, thank you for sharing.

674
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,447
What's it gonna be,
my friends?

675
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,853
We will take
three six-packs of Bud

676
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,585
and a Coke and a water
for my gay little friend right here.

677
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,752
- You're a douche.
- Mm-hmm.

678
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,524
Coconut water,
got electrolytes,

679
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,395
good for the kidneys.

680
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,298
- Three six-pack of beer.
- Ohhh.

681
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,167
That was fast
Ready to go.

682
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,866
The bathrooms in here are atrocious.

683
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,876
There was something slippery
on the handle

684
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,072
and I swear there was
a glory hole in the wall.

685
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,016
Gentlemen, 52.55.

686
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,646
- Damn!
- What?

687
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,350
- That's a little steep, isn't it?
- Pesos or dollars?

688
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,023
Oh Shit!

689
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,122
- Oh shit what?
- It's the sarge.

690
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,928
- Sarge like...
- The sarge is coming

691
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,229
- ...like sergeant?
- Sergeant of what?

692
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,938
Oh man. I'd throw my dick
in cocaine to get...

693
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:02,375
- Shut the hell up.
- Do you see... I see that, come on

694
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:08,016
Marcus, I thought you were
gonna close down for a while.

695
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:11,019
We were, sheriff.
I just had these last customers

696
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,986
- and I was...
- Lock the doors.

697
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,820
- On it.
- Hey.

698
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,330
Oh, I love what you do
with that chain.

699
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,389
Go eat a bowl of dicks,
you douchewad.

700
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,867
Come on, that was awesome.

701
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,029
I don't know what this
is all about,

702
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,039
but you can't just lock us in.

703
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,235
Oh no?
Just did, sweetcakes.

704
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,306
What are you gonna do about it?

705
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,609
Well, what do you want me to do?

706
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,446
I'll bet you'd rather be at home
with a cup of warm cocoa?

707
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,646
Curled up
in a Winnie the Pooh snuggie,

708
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,451
reading Oprah's book of the week.

709
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,822
Well, that ain't gonna happen.

710
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,625
You see, we are hunters

711
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:58,394
and we are here on a mission.

712
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:01,096
It's supposed to be
a secret mission,

713
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,105
but now you faggots
are in my mission.

714
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,334
Excuse me?

715
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,536
Well, two regular people
and one faggot.

716
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,239
- That's you.
- Listen, we just want beer.

717
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,576
That's all.

718
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,674
We all want something, son.

719
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,451
Have you ever seen a man

720
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,454
with a dragon tattoo on his dick?

721
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,624
Well, I have!

722
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,125
My daddy.

723
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:29,029
He used to ride bicycles naked
when he was drunk and on leave.

724
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,156
He'd ride endless circles
singing a song

725
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,499
about a man with a dragon in his lap.

726
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,163
What's this all about?

727
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,867
Have you ever heard of a strigoi?

728
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,004
Half zombie, half vampire

729
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,377
one quarter werewolf?

730
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:50,010
One and a quarter's
not even possible.

731
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,020
Not possible?

732
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,953
Then what do you call
the devil beast

733
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,150
we have locked up
in the back there right now?

734
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,753
- What was that awful sound?
- Holy was that?

735
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,593
Settle down.

736
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,690
And we mean to take
him out right now.

737
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,031
And I don't mean for dinner.

738
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:10,937
Then we will come back
and deal with you.

739
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,976
You all have to be inspected

740
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,567
and cleansed.

741
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,304
Is that like a sponge bath?

742
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,940
'Cause if so,
I'd really like for her...

743
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,643
Shut the hell up.

744
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,819
This cleansing could kill you.

745
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,878
But it is the only way.

746
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,556
Winter, to the back.

747
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,230
You've gotta get us out of here, man

748
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,241
I can't... the sarge

749
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,244
I'm getting the gist here pretty good.

750
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,906
Please open the door,

751
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,381
and we'll be outta here
like the fucking wind.

752
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,980
What the high holy was that?

753
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,649
Dude, if you don't let us out of here

754
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,215
right now, I'm going to
penetrate your colon so deep

755
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,853
that your shit is gonna
have my Nike marks on it.

756
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,864
This is insane.
There is no such thing

757
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,958
as a strigoi.
Am I on "Fear Tactics" right now?

758
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,764
<i>Marcus?</i>

759
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,932
My ex-fiancée is
getting married in

760
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,236
17-

761
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,868
...17 hours.

762
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,276
Marrying another guy?

763
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,315
Yeah, hence the "ex" part

764
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,872
I gotta stop her.

765
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,315
Do you love her?

766
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,375
Of course I do

767
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,752
I was almost married once.

768
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,950
Then you know exactly how I feel.

769
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,687
Yeah. She broke my heart

770
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,629
Katie broke mine, but you see
I have a chance to change that.

771
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,425
But you gotta let me
out of here to do that.

772
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,128
Do you think so?

773
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,297
I can do this
for the both of us, Marcus.

774
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,041
Oh, to hell with it.

775
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,077
Love needs to win sometimes.

776
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,237
- Yeah!
- Yes.

777
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,145
Come on, you all get out of here
Let's get out of here quick.

778
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,314
- What are you doing?
- Beer... we need it.

779
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,378
Come on, let's get outta here.

780
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,645
Let's get the hell outta here.

781
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,259
What the hell?

782
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,832
Oh-hhhh Shit!

783
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,599
Let's get outta here!

784
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,540
Now that was purely awesome

785
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,944
Jesus, Becky, nice right hook.

786
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,743
You almost broke my jaw.

787
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,182
Did you have to rip
my top open, huh, Alan?

788
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,550
- Fucking asshole.
- I was giving them a show.

789
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,816
What's the harm?
Besides, you have great tits.

790
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:40,910
All I'm saying is, like,

791
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,322
All I'm saying is, like,

792
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,224
what if it's real... the strigoi?

793
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,228
And there are more
of them out there?

794
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,857
It's ridiculous! The world's
not coming to an end by strigoi.

795
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,902
There are a lot of things,
actually, that happen

796
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,666
that no one has
an explanation for.

797
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,333
Someone should have been
called is all I'm saying.

798
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,502
Like who? The cops?

799
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,309
I need my bag.

800
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,940
Kev, would you grab it for me?

801
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,383
- It's an emergency.
- Fine.

802
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,421
- Which one is it?
- The pink one.

803
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,547
Obviously.

804
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:18,719
- Uh, you want me to grab something?
- Xanax pronto.

805
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,729
Oka-aaay!

806
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,356
Fucking bong rip,
how about one of those, please?

807
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,560
Whoa, what the fuck is this?

808
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,660
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh my God!

809
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,228
- Get it out of here!
- Hey hey hey.

810
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,365
Calm down, everybody, please.

811
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,274
- Let me explain.
- Lookit,

812
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,334
it has pubic hair on it.

813
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,846
Oh my God!

814
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,008
Kevin, get that out of here!

815
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,846
- No telling where that's been.
- I teach classes

816
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,545
on how to give the perfect.

817
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,654
- B.J.

818
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:52,489
The course is called
"Slob on the knob"

819
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,325
and give a good job.

820
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,558
What? What don't you just use
a banana or something?

821
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,032
It's the visual effect.

822
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,626
They learn better if it seems real.

823
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,866
Well, why the fuck would you
even need it on this trip anyway?

824
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, you never know
who's going to need

825
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,010
a Mr. Tugglesworth of their own?

826
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:12,104
And practice makes perfect.

827
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:18,643
Hey, look at these two.
Probably running from the strigoi.

828
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,950
Look like a couple of hippies.

829
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,082
- Dude, pull over.
- No, Kevin!

830
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,594
- No hitchhikers!
- We can't leave them out there

831
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,756
I mean they have weed
I know it. I'm positive.

832
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,925
And... and... and if
anything happens,

833
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,993
I take full responsibility.
I will take your blowjob class.

834
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,596
I... I will do the bob-my-knob thing
Come on!

835
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,504
Come on,
I'll blow Mr. Tugglesworth!

836
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,702
Now that I gotta see.

837
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:44,837
You take full responsibility?

838
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,882
- Oh yeah.
- Whoo!

839
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,160
Thank you for extracting us

840
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:04,358
from that derelict and

841
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,425
- arenaceous desert floor.
- Yes yes yes.

842
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,734
Ahh, and this is my love partner

843
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,365
and traveling companion..

844
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,040
Destiny.

845
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,674
- Dest... Destiny.
- Destiny.

846
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:28,249
Bless your souls
for your kindness.

847
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,314
They seem nice.

848
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,861
- I don't know about that.
- Yeah right, Kevin.

849
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,760
You guys got any weed?

850
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,027
- Oh, we don't have any weed.
- No weed.

851
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:42,366
- No weed.
- Hello, Mr. Tugglesworth.

852
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,838
This is gonna be good.

853
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,205
Sure you guys don't have
any weed at all?

854
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,768
- No...
- Destructive

855
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:55,374
vegetation.

856
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,453
- Awww.
- ...ln our possessions.

857
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,319
Damn it!

858
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,291
But we do have

859
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,157
the dried gift of the mother.

860
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,389
Oh snap!

861
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,063
Join us for a blessing?

862
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,104
Hell yeah.

863
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,766
The Earth turns

864
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,673
all on a ship of souls?

865
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:25,236
Come with me.
And she rewards us with life.

866
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,339
We suck

867
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,850
from the dusky teat.

868
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,945
Birth, life,

869
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,717
death.

870
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,553
We suck the life of the mother

871
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,585
and taste birth.

872
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:44,963
- Destiny, anoint him.
- Yes, anoint me!

873
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:48,196
- I'm so ready.
- Show him your dark cycle.

874
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,378
Baby, there's no rides out here.

875
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,382
Cycle of life, asshole.

876
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,940
Come on, Wyatt, let's go.

877
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,850
Take this with you.

878
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:08,151
- So lame, so lame!
- We're cleansing ourselves of you

879
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,087
Wyatt, don't be so mean.

880
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,989
That dumb bitch on the skateboard.

881
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,864
She can't even catch up.

882
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,129
Cool ritual, bitch.

883
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:21,224
Naw, man, I don't think it's a sign.

884
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:24,331
Naw, man, I don't think it's a sign.

885
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,171
It was a total fluke.
You're not a shit magnet.

886
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:33,378
- I'm sorry.
- It was a really nice ceremony

887
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,043
I mean she really honored you.

888
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,780
- Awww.
- Okay okay. Leave him alone.

889
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,059
Oh dude.

890
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,096
I'm on fucking fire, man.

891
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,098
Yeah, what the fuck
are you doing here?

892
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,501
Dude?

893
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,766
- What?
- Dude!

894
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:58,973
What?

895
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,105
Dude!

896
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,340
What... what?

897
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,245
What?

898
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,307
- Dude?
- What?

899
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,047
What?

900
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,552
Again, what are you
doing here on the RV?

901
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,393
What do you mean what am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

902
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,628
What are you, just some kind
of fucking ninja Batman or something?

903
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,137
Fucking ladies wrestling league
here or something, man?

904
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,073
Dude, what are you doing here?

905
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,475
I think you dented
my fucking beard, man!

906
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,646
What are you doing here?

907
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,507
You mean prior to being accosted

908
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,917
and having my fucking joint
stabbed out on me?

909
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,683
I was using the fucking
facilities, man.

910
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,555
You know,
the fucking head here?

911
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,651
Dude!
Oh, dude.

912
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:57,259
Dude, you're not supposed...
you crapped in the RV?

913
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,699
You're not... no one
craps in the RV, dude!

914
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,998
Hey, man, well, it sure the shit

915
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,040
ain't a fucking reading chair,
now is it there, Komatsu.

916
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,037
Not fucking comfortable enough.

917
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,009
- Hey, man.
- No no, I don't like it here.

918
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,844
Dude, how did you...

919
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,509
Dude felt the pressure.

920
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,610
Release was the option I had, man

921
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,417
I came here for some
quiet time, you know?

922
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:25,119
Meditate on my colon, you know?
Maybe fucking blow a jay.

923
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,220
Next thing I know,
this motherfucker's moving, man.

924
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,728
But I got... oh shit

925
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,201
I gotta tell you though

926
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,999
as far as RV shitters go,

927
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:39,063
This has
got some fucking space, man

928
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,836
I fucking like this guy
You know.

929
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,003
I could spend some
fucking time in here.

930
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,706
It's got some nice
wallpaper and shit, man.

931
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,272
Dude, listen, we can't...

932
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,340
If they find out you're on here

933
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,047
they're gonna flip, okay?
So just lay low and just chill, man.

934
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,215
And we'll figure out
a way to get you off.

935
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,920
You know what? I think you're the one
who needs to fucking drop a deuce.

936
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,655
Okay.

937
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,698
Look at you,
all fucking backed up.

938
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,166
Fucking ninja back up

939
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:09,227
I think you need to ninja
that shit right out of there, man.

940
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,297
Okay, just chill and be quiet.

941
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,433
Why don't you keep it
on the DL and have a hit?

942
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,602
Shut up.

943
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,907
Oh well

944
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,317
I guess I'll have a drink

945
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,979
I'll drink to that!

946
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,760
Wow, I'm so stoned.

947
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,428
Hmm.

948
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,870
That really took it out of me.

949
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,947
Yeah, her too?

950
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,961
You lucky guy

951
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,366
Wyatt, what's wrong?

952
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,426
I don't know.

953
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,473
Something doesn't feel right

954
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,770
I think we need to turn around.

955
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,438
No, you were just having
a bad dream, that's all.

956
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,948
We're not turning around.
You love her, end of story.

957
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,542
Okay?
Get some rest.

958
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:31,677
All right.

959
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,518
A sunny afternoon

960
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:39,118
I've been up for hours
and I don't know what to do today.

961
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:43,596
Tomorrow forever.

962
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,369
You all right, Uncle Kenny?
You need me to drive?

963
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,302
Oh, I'll be fine. I'm fine.

964
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,273
Nobody drives Ernest but me

965
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,832
I'll be fine.

966
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,740
All right then.
Let me know if you need something

967
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,214
I will, thanks

968
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:11,485
I want to leave this place
and start again

969
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:15,428
I don't want to go back
where I began

970
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:19,194
I want to find
somewhere I belong

971
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,703
I don't want to make
this last word.

972
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,098
Without a song

973
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,757
I should clean this place up.

974
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,590
Grab a shower and shave
and go outside...

975
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,430
As long as I am by it.

976
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,196
The phone never rings

977
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,396
I don't know what I'm doing.

978
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,031
But I'm making new friends

979
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,475
I know that this ain't working?

980
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,419
Hey, what do you think about
that waitress over at Nick's diner?

981
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,649
She sure was something.

982
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:17,055
Those were some monstrous jugs,
weren't they?

983
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,118
Oh yeah, I gave them titties
a pearl necklace last weekend.

984
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,925
Whoo-wee!
Boy, you give a girl a piece of jewelry

985
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,090
she might let you slip it in her.

986
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,634
No, you dumb-ass

987
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,603
I didn't buy her nothing
I shot it on her neck.

988
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:33,436
- You shot what on her neck?
- My fucking spunk!

989
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,376
My essence.
My goddamn man-chowder.

990
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:39,871
Oh, she let you do that?

991
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,847
Hell yeah, she let me do that!

992
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,317
She was like, "Oh, Daddy"

993
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,513
goo me up, Daddy!
Goo me up!"

994
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:49,147
Then she held
her big old jugs up like that

995
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,886
and I sprayed 'em like Engine 59

996
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,757
I even got a little on her lip too.

997
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,819
You oughta try that one.

998
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:01,033
Shit. Donna would never let me
goo up that waitress.

999
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,970
She'd kill me!
Huh-uh, huh-uh.

1000
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,598
Are you inbred or something?

1001
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:08,836
Donna!
Give Donna the goo.

1002
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,675
This ain't useful.

1003
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,215
How on earth did they ever
let you have a gun?

1004
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,589
- Son of a bitch.
- What the hell was that?

1005
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,988
Damned RV hit our car, man.

1006
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,564
Hey, boy.
You want to step out of that vehicle

1007
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,367
and keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

1008
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,499
Yes sir, officer.

1009
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,880
Over there, miss. This way

1010
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,010
shaman.

1011
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,247
You too.
Come on, Pops, come on.

1012
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,088
Are we still in Texas?

1013
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:00,685
Have you been drinking, son?

1014
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,721
No, officer. I must have
fallen asleep at the wheel.

1015
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,927
We'll just see about that
What about drugs?

1016
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,061
- You been doing them drugs, boy?
- No.

1017
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,127
Nothing.

1018
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,899
Okay, why don't you just
keep your lips sealed

1019
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,034
and give me your license
and registration?

1020
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,339
We'll see if you have
any warrants coming back.

1021
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,404
You better hope and pray
you don't come back with any warrants.

1022
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,110
No, officer,
I don't have any warrants

1023
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,119
Uncle Kenny,
you hit their patrol car?

1024
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,746
I changed the music
to a country station,

1025
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,291
- all of a sudden, kaboom!
- Country's like the worst choice!

1026
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,349
You should have picked something
like, more upbeat.

1027
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,520
- Like Green Bay?
- Green Bay?

1028
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,564
- Green Day.
- Green Day, yes yes!

1029
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,963
- Green Day would work.
- Oh yeah yeah!

1030
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,295
What if he picked that...

1031
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,994
what is that album called again?

1032
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,059
"Pukie"?
Wouldn't that be great, Kev?

1033
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,572
All I know is I'm driving
the rest of the way.

1034
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:49,805
Like hell you are.
Nobody drives Ernest but me.

1035
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,004
- I'm fine.
- Ernest?

1036
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,307
Okay, shut it, shut it!

1037
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,872
Just shut it already!
Do you realize how much trouble

1038
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,578
- you guys are all in?
- Whatever.

1039
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:01,214
Listen to me, people around these parts
don't take too kindly to your kind.

1040
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,656
I might end up throwing you in jail.

1041
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,624
You ever been
to a gang bang? Huh?

1042
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,925
You know what it's like
to be gang-raped? Sweet thing?

1043
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:12,432
Bending down, picking up the soap?
You're gonna find out the hard way.

1044
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,527
- That's not so bad.
- He's clear, partner.

1045
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:18,766
- Clear.
- You know what? Check the RV.

1046
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,830
Step aside, sir. Aside!

1047
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:22,706
- Sorry.
- Here.

1048
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,507
Thank... thank you, officer.

1049
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:33,417
My God. Nothing!

1050
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,286
Except this.
What do you make of this, partner?

1051
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:39,156
Goddamn sickos.

1052
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,559
Right? You know what?

1053
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,537
I want to give
one of them girls a cavity search!

1054
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,688
But you wouldn't know
what to do with one of those girls

1055
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,692
if they was sitting on your face.

1056
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,601
- Maybe a pearl necklace.
- Take this!

1057
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,300
- All right, who's first?!
- One Lincoln seven.

1058
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,138
Stay right here.

1059
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,305
One Lincoln seven. Go ahead

1060
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,611
415, customer at a minimart

1061
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,016
stating a half-man,
half-zombie being chased

1062
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,021
by a shirtless female officer.

1063
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,148
Sumbitch zombie man-beast

1064
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,385
chasing folks over at the minimart!

1065
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:12,893
Hey, Jess, let's go!

1066
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,088
What about a citation?

1067
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,858
Forget about the citation.

1068
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,730
I had a pearl necklace for you, honey.

1069
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,429
Old truckers never die

1070
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,836
I'll tell you, girl, I wouldn't lie.

1071
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,465
What can I do do do?

1072
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:35,839
- Let's get outta here!
- Let's go!

1073
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,851
- Right?

1074
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,375
Shit.
Hey, Ellen, can you... can...

1075
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:05,242
my leg's falling asleep.

1076
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,805
Hey, Ellen,
my leg's falling asleep.

1077
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,780
Can you move a little bit?

1078
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,049
No, seriously,
I can't feel my leg.

1079
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,954
Oh Shit!

1080
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,392
Dude, what are you doing?

1081
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:27,833
Nothing.
I'm... I'm... I'm fine

1082
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,734
I just dropped something
Go back to sleep.

1083
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,603
It's too late for that.
What the fuck are we listening to?

1084
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,835
I'm just trying
to stay awake, man.

1085
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:38,141
- Change it if you want.
- Yeah, I'll find something.

1086
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,340
- No, wait!
- Oh shit!

1087
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:43,213
Nice boner, dude! Does Ellen
know you're skull-fucking her?

1088
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:46,982
- What's going on, huh?
- Dude, Ellen is sleeping on Wyatt's lap

1089
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:50,149
and he's got a huge boner
Classic.

1090
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,124
Interesting.

1091
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,128
It's not funny.

1092
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,495
- It doesn't mean anything.
- Oh, I beg to differ, my dear.

1093
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:00,364
It's not even a boner!
It's just a bulge in my pants.

1094
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,664
Naw naw, that's bullshit, man.

1095
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,798
- That is fully a boner.
- Shut up! Ellen.

1096
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,010
Oh, you... fuck, man!

1097
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,409
Yeah, motherfucker!

1098
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,846
Oh, I'm going to punch you
in the dick later.

1099
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,733
- Number one or number two?
- Oh, come on!

1100
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,106
No no, first rule of the RV

1101
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,772
is no one dumps in the RV
unless they want to empty the RV.

1102
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:49,044
- Shit!
- Not here, grasshopper.

1103
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:50,607
Ha ha!
Frickin' bridge troll.

1104
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,880
Number one or number two.

1105
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,979
"Cannot cross my bridge
if it's number two."

1106
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:58,287
Hey hey, you gotta pull over, dude
I gotta go.

1107
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,828
We don't have time to stop.
Use the bathroom back there.

1108
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:03,421
- I can't, it's number two.
- Contract your sphincter.

1109
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,565
Come on, man, I gotta go.
I'm about to crap my pants.

1110
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,661
Hey, maybe it's time
to pay Angie back?

1111
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:13,401
- Piss off, Wyatt!
- Wyatt, if Kevin shits the rug

1112
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,238
you're cleaning it.

1113
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:18,279
- Come on, man.
- I will, I will!

1114
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,007
I'm just messing with him

1115
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,783
I don't know, Kev.
This is an Indian reservation

1116
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,821
in the middle of nowhere.
I don't have a good feeling about this.

1117
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,254
What the fuck are you doing
on an Indian reservation?

1118
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,053
The road goes right through it.

1119
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,391
Um, well, fuck it.
I can't hold it, man.

1120
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,522
So just pull over
and I'll say an apology

1121
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,396
and a prayer to the great buffalo
then for making doodie on his land.

1122
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,871
Oh yes, the big one!
The big one!

1123
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,875
Oh, you... God.

1124
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,277
- Oh!
- Use another stall, buddy

1125
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,213
I'm taking a shit!

1126
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,808
Oh fuck!

1127
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,851
Oh, you've gotta-

1128
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:08,261
Oh, God damn it.

1129
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,389
It's just you and me, old buddy

1130
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,592
I need half of you for later.

1131
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,295
Half of you for now.

1132
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,804
Okay.

1133
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,535
No time. No.

1134
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,067
Ohhhh um,

1135
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,135
How long are you gonna be?

1136
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:30,316
How long are you gonna be?

1137
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,478
I just sat down, man
I might be awhile.

1138
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,318
You're disabled?
- No-oooo.

1139
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,619
How long are you gonna be?

1140
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,857
I'm disabled right now, man.

1141
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,955
Get the fuck outta here. Whew

1142
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,626
I'm not leaving
until you open this door.

1143
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,109
- Why?
- You gonna be awhile?

1144
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,009
Are you fucking kidding me?
What's wrong with you, man?

1145
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,743
- Use another stall.
- I'm crippled, you dumb-ass.

1146
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:04,478
Game.

1147
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,817
You wanna use your dick
for a birthday candle?

1148
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,584
You'd better open this door

1149
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,284
I can't, man,
you're gonna have to wait.

1150
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,487
- I'm mid-squeeze right now, nubs.
- Come on!

1151
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:18,499
I'm not leaving
until you open this door.

1152
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,728
What, did you get fucking hit
in the head or something, man?

1153
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,497
Use a different stall, you weirdo!

1154
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,665
- What?
- I said you're gonna have to wait.

1155
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,935
Figure something out,
Wheelie Jim!

1156
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,108
What the fuck?

1157
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,863
Uncle Kenny,
why are you sitting?

1158
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,698
He's not in there.
What's going on?

1159
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,034
It seems he has offended some

1160
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,701
big-shot tribal leader or something.

1161
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:05,412
Yeah, he offends everyone.

1162
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,448
Where is he, in the office?

1163
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:10,313
It's not gonna be that easy.

1164
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,853
What the hell is going on here?

1165
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:15,480
Your friend has offended an elder

1166
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,525
and therefore
he must be punished.

1167
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,357
Well, you bring him down
right now or we are calling the cops.

1168
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,398
Go ahead.
They have no jurisdiction here.

1169
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,900
No, wait, is there

1170
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,232
some kind of offering
that we can make?

1171
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,034
Here, it's all I have
Please just take it.

1172
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,076
And here, I got a couple too.

1173
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,037
Your white-man money
is no good here.

1174
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,262
- But you just took it.
- Huh?

1175
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,976
I am unburdening you.

1176
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,211
The less you have,
the better you are.

1177
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,344
No, you listen to me!
I don't have time to...

1178
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,591
Okay okay!
This isn't gonna resolve anything

1179
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,952
ls there anything that
we can do to bring our friend back?

1180
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,263
I will call the council and I
will relay to them your request.

1181
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,735
Okay, fine.

1182
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,772
When do we start?

1183
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,774
- I need to borrow a phone.
- Oh Jeez.

1184
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,071
- What?
- Diot.

1185
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:14,638
Really?

1186
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,279
Yes, I'm here with the guys.

1187
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,628
And put $5 on Duckling
Okay.

1188
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,298
- Are you kidding me?
- Ha ha!

1189
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,007
Hey!

1190
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,307
You'll get your phone back
with your friend.

1191
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,481
The council says you may do
the ritual of the great Tatonka.

1192
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,952
And that should take care of everything.

1193
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,818
Okay fine.
When do we start?

1194
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,448
End of the road at sundown.

1195
01:01:57,513 --> 01:02:00,983
And how long is this
gonna take... about?

1196
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,530
The ritual of the Tatonka
can take five days.

1197
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,192
We don't have five days.

1198
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,259
Well, screw this!
Let's just pick him up

1199
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:11,236
- on the way back.
- No no no.

1200
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,707
- We're taking him right now.
- Well, fine then!

1201
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,578
Really?
Is it really gonna take five days?

1202
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:23,310
I've seen it done in less time

1203
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:27,085
ls there any way it could
be done in, like...

1204
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:30,420
this ritual... in like an hour?

1205
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,723
- It's never been attempted.
- No?

1206
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:39,323
I have seen it done in...

1207
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,629
in less time.

1208
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,796
It would require all of you
working as one,

1209
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,864
and maybe... just maybe you
will please the great spirit.

1210
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,909
Okay, that's promising.

1211
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,342
- Yeah.
- Know this

1212
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,747
if the spirit is not satisfied
you are not protected

1213
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:57,341
and the ritual may kill all of you?

1214
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,010
What?!

1215
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,681
End of the road.

1216
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:04,190
You should start driving.

1217
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,249
Let's go, come on!

1218
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,360
Do you think
we're gonna make it in time?

1219
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,528
Yeah.

1220
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:19,596
- I hope you're right.
- I am right. I'm always right.

1221
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,073
- Yeah yeah.
- You know that.

1222
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,440
And if not?

1223
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:29,415
Is this the place?
We're in the middle of BFE.

1224
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,315
What's BFE again?

1225
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:34,082
Hmm, so that's what
a tepee looks like.

1226
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,319
Guys, this looks really creepy.

1227
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,361
Where are we?

1228
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:44,026
- I have no idea.
- Oh my God!

1229
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,999
- That looks like a...
- Where the hell is this place, huh?

1230
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,636
This must be it

1231
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,374
I don't like this.

1232
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,966
Me neither.

1233
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,945
Let's just do what we need to do
and get the hell outta here.

1234
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,716
You four have come
for your friend

1235
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,048
who has greatly offended an elder?

1236
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:09,283
- And so the tribe.
- Yes, we have.

1237
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,621
And you intend to take
the ceremony of the Tatonka?

1238
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:14,756
- Yeah.
- Yes, we do.

1239
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:19,431
- Can we see our friend?
- No.

1240
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:23,235
Follow.

1241
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,007
Oh sweet baby Jesus!

1242
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:33,638
I love wheelchair people.

1243
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,011
- Kevin.
- Oh my God.

1244
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,709
- That looks like it hurts.
- Merry Christmas.

1245
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,116
Man, you know,
like when I was a little kid

1246
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,587
I used to play
cowboys and Indians,

1247
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,487
I was always an Indian.

1248
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,083
- What have you done with him?
- You can see him.

1249
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:49,891
There he is. He's up
on the giant thing and he is fine.

1250
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,590
He is in the spirit world.

1251
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,258
Hey, Ellen,

1252
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,802
you know you and Wyatt should bang

1253
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:59,271
and make uptight Caucasian babies.

1254
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:02,070
Just thought I should tell you that
I saw it in a vision.

1255
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,439
No big deal.

1256
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,638
He is so fucked.

1257
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:09,513
It seems like a bad night
I had in Ibiza.

1258
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,519
He committed the disrespect
in the bathroom.

1259
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,612
So the journey for your friend

1260
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,953
is a muddy disgrace
as the elder felt.

1261
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:18,515
Everybody should get stoned.

1262
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,632
And they should
throw rocks at me, man,

1263
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,692
in the mud
while I'm wearing this...

1264
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,897
Now are you ready
to begin your journey?

1265
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:35,237
Pray the great spirit
smiles upon you.

1266
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,437
Sound prehistoric.

1267
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,377
Will there be
hors d'oeuvres there?

1268
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:42,279
Maybe some mystery fingers?

1269
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:45,410
Do you think I could get
clubbed by a warrior?

1270
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:46,612
Uncle Kenny!

1271
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,181
Follow.

1272
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,487
- I don't like this.
- Me neither.

1273
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,757
Hey, man, can I have
some more of that soup?

1274
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,031
So begins the ceremony
of the Tatonka.

1275
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:09,269
Like my ancestors before me
who have shown me

1276
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:12,040
the gift of the Tatonka,

1277
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,945
and those who didn't
show me shit

1278
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,041
cause they were kinda dicks,

1279
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:20,212
I begin this offering.

1280
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:24,658
Oh great spirit,

1281
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:28,218
guide us in this journey.

1282
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:33,425
Yes.

1283
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,560
Drink.

1284
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:39,865
What's in this?

1285
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,636
Cause I don't do dark liquor.

1286
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,974
It's roofies, dear.
You've done it before.

1287
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:47,173
Drink.

1288
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:55,549
Drink.

1289
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,790
Um.

1290
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,635
Drink.

1291
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,538
Blech.

1292
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,844
Drink.

1293
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:28,281
Can I get a straw
and maybe a twist of lemon?

1294
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,722
- Huh?
- Drink.

1295
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,453
Okay okay.

1296
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,559
Good. Good good.

1297
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:42,967
Now the great spirit will
show you the way.

1298
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,920
How come you're not drinking?

1299
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,471
Not my journey.

1300
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,511
I'm glad you think it's funny.

1301
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,381
Last time I felt like this,
it was at the

1302
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,580
and when I woke up
I was covered in ham.

1303
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,884
Drink.

1304
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:06,188
Do you want to scalp me, man?
Go ahead!

1305
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:09,058
All these people out there,
they're all scalping me.

1306
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,428
This girl in Vegas,
she's scalping me.

1307
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,228
Scalping me in the ass!

1308
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:19,870
Thank you. That helps.

1309
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,341
See your destiny?

1310
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,344
I see myself.

1311
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,314
Pigtails, cute little gingham skirt

1312
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,010
lollipops.

1313
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:34,850
Teasing all the football players
from the sideline,

1314
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,447
showing my little b-bubble ass

1315
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:42,087
and then the whole entire team
will jerk jizz all over their cleats

1316
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:44,688
right there
on the 50-yard line

1317
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,494
I am a dynamo!

1318
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:52,438
Drink.

1319
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,940
Mmm, I'm in a white forest.

1320
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,906
But I'm hanging from a tree,

1321
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:05,418
upside down like a bat,
like a big black bat.

1322
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,011
And my tongue is licking

1323
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,648
the snow again

1324
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,750
and again!

1325
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:18,126
What does it mean?

1326
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,791
It means you're insane

1327
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,495
I thought it was cool.

1328
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:28,675
Drink.

1329
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,443
Man, you guys got
the raw end of the deal, man.

1330
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,243
Yes, we know.

1331
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,181
White people are dicks!

1332
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,517
And I can say that
because I'm white.

1333
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,146
Drink.

1334
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:47,750
Oh man

1335
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:50,092
I don't even care
if we get there right now

1336
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:52,462
I just wanna

1337
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,865
stay here

1338
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,369
with the twigs and the spit

1339
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,470
Ellen, what's your vision?

1340
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,908
Oh no no, I'm not... not telling.

1341
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,946
What?

1342
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:08,311
Don't tell.

1343
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,611
- No.
- Come on.

1344
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:14,513
This is just for me.
I wanna go see the fire.

1345
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,648
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Okay.

1346
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,988
Come on,
give me your hand

1347
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,332
Wyatt!

1348
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,175
Wyatt!

1349
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,210
We're leaving now

1350
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,216
Wyatt!

1351
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:44,945
We're leaving.

1352
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,009
Where are you?

1353
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,193
Are we dead?

1354
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:03,396
I wish we were.

1355
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,341
We have to get to Vegas!
Oh my God,

1356
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:10,741
- we have to get to the wedding.
- Where's the RV?

1357
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:13,143
- What about Kevin and the others?
- Fuck!

1358
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:15,580
We have to get
to fucking Vegas!

1359
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:18,050
The wedding... fuck.

1360
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,178
We're gonna miss everything.

1361
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,984
- Well, you're not helping.
- Try dancing or something?

1362
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:32,622
Really?
Come on, who doesn't

1363
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,599
pick up a chick
in a leather two-piece?

1364
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,568
I thought you were gonna show me
how to get it done?

1365
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:41,404
Well, why don't you go
and bury yourself in the sand?

1366
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,703
Well, here comes somebody now.

1367
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,841
You wanna actually
get in that car?

1368
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:51,907
Why don't you go check for me?

1369
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,358
Oh man,
we really need a ride.

1370
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,087
Uh, where are you guys going?

1371
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,288
Uh, we're trying
to get to Vegas. Vegas.

1372
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:05,821
We're going to Buffalo Bill's
You guys can hop in.

1373
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:08,994
- Yeah.
- You gotta bring that little...

1374
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:11,732
that little Shirley Temple-
looking thing with you.

1375
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:16,623
Oh yeah, totally. You can...
whatever you want. You can have her.

1376
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,770
- Yeah.
- Get in.

1377
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,142
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1378
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,648
- All righty, partay.
- Whew.

1379
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:24,343
Thank you

1380
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:27,944
...on Friday,
August 12th at 2:00 p.m.

1381
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,752
All you gotta do is call
the studio between the hours

1382
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,793
of 8:00 and 10:00 p.m
Pacific Standard Time.

1383
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,328
I'm not sure we should have
left the others.

1384
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:36,886
Oh, don't worry
We'll be fine.

1385
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:38,954
What's the worst that
could happen, right?

1386
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,466
A lot of discussion on the table

1387
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,866
about what they're gonna do
to expand the runway.

1388
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,235
Let me tell you...
last week, we had...

1389
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:49,174
Y'all must be getting hot and sweaty
with all that leather down there.

1390
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:53,111
You guys want some beer?
We got a bunch of that shit right here.

1391
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:56,115
- Oh, boo boo.
- Thank you. I am so thirsty right now.

1392
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:58,742
- Yoo! Thank you.
- No problem.

1393
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:01,048
But they're kinda hot, though, man.

1394
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,112
Whoo, hot damn!

1395
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:06,648
- Yeah!
- Oh yeah.

1396
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,423
This is a song we made
so much sweet love to,

1397
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,795
you can't even imagine it.

1398
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:14,630
- Ugh.
- Had plenty of practice with this boy.

1399
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:15,998
Hey now.

1400
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:21,840
- Oh, y'all want a joint?
- Puff puff pass.

1401
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,468
- No, I'm good.
- No thanks.

1402
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,376
I... I had quite a night last night.

1403
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:29,979
More for us to smoke and to drive.

1404
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:32,678
What are y'all supposed to be, anyways?
Sonny and Cher?

1405
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,822
- Who are they?
- Are you kidding with me?

1406
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:42,351
Who is Sonny and Cher? I should come
back there and kick your fucking ass.

1407
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:49,194
Smoking and driving
is funning.

1408
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,204
Yeah, you sure
that's the best idea?

1409
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,797
- You want me to drive your car, man?
- Hey, I pride myself?

1410
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,933
On how we done got it ourselves
This guy

1411
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,036
at a gas station...
he left it.

1412
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,741
And the next thing you know,
me and the lady here

1413
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:04,182
hopped right in, boom!
Outta there.

1414
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,583
You stole this car
or it's your car?

1415
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,053
I didn't steal shit, man

1416
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,418
I didn't steal a damn thing

1417
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:12,482
I settled into these
nice leather seats.

1418
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:14,721
- Yeah, these things got seat warmers.
- Yeah.

1419
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,161
This thing has the coolest.

1420
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,563
Star-Trekking
motherfucking gadget

1421
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,498
button-pushing thing
in front here.

1422
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:25,027
You press a button, it talks.
It says a bunch of shit to you

1423
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:28,097
I call him Carl
I say to Carl...

1424
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:30,507
I say, "Carl,
where are we going?"

1425
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:33,172
And he starts yippering
and yappering. Like watch

1426
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:35,738
Carl, how far to Buffalo Bill's?

1427
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,376
100 miles.

1428
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,851
Isn't that cool?

1429
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:42,320
Man, I'm gonna get arrested
before I even get to Vegas.

1430
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:43,583
You ain't gonna get arrested.

1431
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:45,420
You ain't gonna get
arrested for anything.

1432
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,859
And now we've got that
full back seat back there.

1433
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,362
- That's right, we do.
- You have any other shit in the trunk

1434
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,262
besides your bags?

1435
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,392
There might be a goat in the trunk.

1436
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,364
A... a goat?
A live goat?

1437
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:00,669
Well, it may not be alive any more.

1438
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:03,175
But it was alive when

1439
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,508
we put it in the trunk.

1440
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,274
Yahoo!

1441
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,983
All right, all right, hey!

1442
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,022
Sonny and Cher!

1443
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:17,250
Yoo-hoo.

1444
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,588
Sackajaweenis
and Pocahotness, hey.

1445
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:20,820
Y'all wake up.

1446
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:25,757
Are we at Buffalo Bill's?

1447
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:28,495
Yeah.

1448
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,503
We... fuck,
we have to get a cab.

1449
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:33,096
Oh no, we brought you
all the way here.

1450
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,438
Yeah, the missus here
wanted to see Paris

1451
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:39,172
and there ain't any way
we're actually gonna do that,

1452
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:41,441
so this is as good as it gets.

1453
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,176
Oh man!

1454
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,081
Are you kidding me?
That's awesome!

1455
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,949
- Thanks so much, man.
- Hell yeah!

1456
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,223
Oh fuck.

1457
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,486
Oh yeah, there was... sorry.

1458
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,653
We hit a lot of bumps
on the way here.

1459
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,992
Your titty must have
just popped right out.

1460
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,658
- Really?!
- Yeah, really.

1461
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,632
Totally totally.

1462
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,863
Hey, you guys have
a nice wedding, all right?

1463
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,701
Yep, thanks, man.

1464
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,866
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

1465
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,943
Okay, you gotta get in the shower
because we're gonna be late.

1466
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:19,007
But I still need to go
get a suit though.

1467
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,111
No you don't.

1468
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,083
When did you guys get here?

1469
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:27,991
Oh no, not... not...
like how long... like an hour!

1470
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,461
Where the hell
have you been, huh?

1471
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:41,399
Hey, I finally made it.

1472
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:44,740
Yeah, long story, but I look great.

1473
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,671
How's it going over there?

1474
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:51,149
Oh good!
All right, good luck. See you soon!

1475
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:52,879
Gotta go to the wedding!

1476
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,682
Toodle-loo, lady!

1477
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,416
See you there.

1478
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:58,116
Good luck, Wyatt!

1479
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,524
Buh... bye!

1480
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:02,061
Bye.

1481
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:08,293
- You're not coming down to the bar?
- No.

1482
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,268
I need to talk to Wyatt.

1483
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,963
That's my girl!

1484
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,467
I'm so hot in this suit.

1485
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,373
Too hot!

1486
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,571
Too hot... why am I so hot

1487
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,775
- in this suit? Sexy.
- Hey, get out of here.

1488
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,749
You heard the lady.

1489
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,877
Come on, move it, huh?

1490
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,853
You see this, right?
I'm not the only one.

1491
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,220
- Oh, good-looking dude.
- Oh, get out of here with that.

1492
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,555
Hey, no hooking up
in the shower, all right?

1493
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:42,162
Where is everybody?

1494
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:46,637
Hey, what are you doing here?

1495
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,810
Wait a minute...
wait wait, I can't do that.

1496
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,110
Um...

1497
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:59,380
I'm about to go break up
a wedding and I can't do that

1498
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:02,320
I've loved you practically all my life

1499
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,687
and I can't live a lie anymore.

1500
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,589
What do you expect me
to say to that?

1501
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:08,958
Just say how you feel.

1502
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,623
At least then I'll know the truth

1503
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,928
I do, I love you so much

1504
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,401
but I love you
as a friend, you know?

1505
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,804
That's not enough?

1506
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:34,142
It was a great trip
and a fun ride over the years.

1507
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,417
Take care of yourself, okay?

1508
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,354
Wait

1509
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:43,191
I need you now more than ever

1510
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:46,563
I've heard that before

1511
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,862
I just... I wish you meant it.

1512
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:23,036
You pull me in, I pull away.

1513
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:27,233
And you ask why
I don't stay longer.

1514
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,310
Hey, what can I get you, buddy?

1515
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,212
- A shot of Jack.
- You got it.

1516
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,717
What took you so damn long?

1517
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:44,054
- She's gone.
- Who?

1518
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,523
Ellen.

1519
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,582
She told me she loved me

1520
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:49,094
and I rejected her.

1521
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:52,928
Idiot. You two are
meant for each other.

1522
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:54,490
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

1523
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:56,331
I could have used
this information, you know?

1524
01:19:56,391 --> 01:20:00,032
Would you have listened?
We drove all the way out here

1525
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:04,635
hoping that this whole thing
would come to a head finally.

1526
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:07,270
- No pun intended.
- All I know

1527
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:09,281
is I came out here
to break up a wedding

1528
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:12,011
and that's exactly
what I intend to do.

1529
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,519
You're sure that's
what you want to do?

1530
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:16,749
Yes.

1531
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,553
Then break a leg.

1532
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,756
Yes.

1533
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,263
You're saying words
I want to hear...

1534
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,347
Y'all may be seated.

1535
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:51,989
First off,

1536
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:55,620
I'd like to say congratulations

1537
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:59,029
to Billy and Katie.

1538
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:01,363
This guy must have a huge cock

1539
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,425
because he's as ugly as sin

1540
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,738
I'd like to say thank you

1541
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:11,073
to the parents,
family members and friends

1542
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:14,272
for being here today.

1543
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,008
We've all come together

1544
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,882
"for one common thing"

1545
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:24,151
the love these two individuals

1546
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,522
have for one another.

1547
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:29,653
It's been called
life's greatest adventure?

1548
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,495
Marriage.

1549
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,933
What is marriage

1550
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,527
might you ask.

1551
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:40,471
It has but one meaning.

1552
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:45,802
To share the rest
of your lives together.

1553
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:52,380
At one time

1554
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,387
you were given life individually.

1555
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:58,189
Now...

1556
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:02,289
together

1557
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,387
as one.

1558
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,392
Before we embark
on this miracle

1559
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,703
I must ask

1560
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,709
if there's anyone here
who objects to this marriage?

1561
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,802
What's he waiting for?

1562
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,574
Together!

1563
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,411
Uh-Oh.

1564
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,178
Look who's here.

1565
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:36,222
Let us call now
on Psalm number three...

1566
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,059
I object.

1567
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,690
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- No way.

1568
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:48,467
Wyatt!
What are you doing here?

1569
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:51,204
I never thought I'd see you again.

1570
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:55,080
Thattaboy.

1571
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:03,019
Young man, is there something
you wanted to say?

1572
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,993
Katie, when you find
someone special

1573
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:10,086
that loves you for who you are,

1574
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:14,156
someone who can get behind you
when things get a little confusing,

1575
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:18,102
you know, like they've been lately
a friend...

1576
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,036
Wyatt, I haven't stopped
thinking about you since I left

1577
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,200
I knew that I made
a mistake and...

1578
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:27,137
I was doing it for all
the wrong reasons.

1579
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,978
I thought I'd know what
to say in this moment,

1580
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:33,485
I mean, I've been thinking about it
a lot over the last few days

1581
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,543
and... I don't know,

1582
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,647
I guess something feels different

1583
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:40,022
I mean, here I am down here

1584
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,459
and you're up there

1585
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,861
and I wanted so badly to be...

1586
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:46,899
up there.
And that's why I came.

1587
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:49,993
To stop this and to show you that
we're meant to be together.

1588
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:52,504
Oh, Wyatt, I...

1589
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,437
I love you

1590
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,999
I can't believe you came for me.

1591
01:23:57,065 --> 01:24:00,342
But when I started practicing and saying
all the things I was going to say,

1592
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,483
I realized it doesn't fit.

1593
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:06,314
- But...
- The person in my head

1594
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,444
wasn't you at all.

1595
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:11,149
She just ran out the door

1596
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:14,858
I'm sorry.

1597
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,395
This was wrong.

1598
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,260
I'm sorry.

1599
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:23,828
- What?
- Wyatt, you fucking asshole!

1600
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,894
How could you do this to her?

1601
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:28,600
How could you do this to me?

1602
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,580
Ellen!

1603
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:42,714
C'mere.

1604
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:45,815
I stood up at the wedding
and I couldn't do it.

1605
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,690
- All I could think about was you.
- So you ruined her wedding?

1606
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,321
Well, it was worth it, I think.

1607
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,457
- You think?
- Well, it depends on how you respond.

1608
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:56,127
- How should I respond?
- Um...

1609
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:57,864
"I love you"
would do the trick

1610
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,270
I just... I don't throw
that word around loosely.

1611
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,767
Not the reaction
you were hoping for?

1612
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,905
- Not exactly.
- Well,

1613
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:10,779
maybe if you say it to me,
I might say it back.

1614
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,451
I love you so much

1615
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:15,954
I love you too.

1616
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:22,051
Oh, Wyatt, ahem.

1617
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,791
- Hi.
- Hey.

1618
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:26,332
Hey, guys, hi.

1619
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:29,197
Yeah, so, um, congratulations.

1620
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,999
- Thank you.
- 'Cause yeah, no hard feelings, 'kay?

1621
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,097
- Yes.
- That's really relieving.

1622
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:36,608
Because I was kinda feeling
like a real horse's dick.

1623
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,075
Mm-hmm, yeah?

1624
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,579
- Ah, Jeez, ow.
- You come here

1625
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:43,275
after I haven't seen you
in fucking forever,

1626
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:45,579
and pull that shit?

1627
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,246
In front of my family
and my new husband?!

1628
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:51,813
- Stop, ow!
- Then you ruin my fucking wedding!

1629
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,383
I hate you!

1630
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:57,225
- Oh, my nose is broken.
- Are you okay?

1631
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:59,458
Oh man.

1632
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:01,762
Oh my God

1633
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:04,633
I am so glad I did not marry her.

1634
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:06,137
Yeah.

1635
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,475
Oh man, and I'm glad
you're here.

1636
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:11,477
Can we please go get
a drink right now?

1637
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,137
Yes, baby, we can.

1638
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,839
- Let's go.
- You called me baby.

1639
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:19,851
Hear the words I want to say.

1640
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:22,912
Dying to communicate.

1641
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:25,821
Stuck inside this breakdown

1642
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,918
I want to say it,
but can't get it out.

1643
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,843
Good morning, campers!

1644
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,036
Come on!

1645
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:46,635
It's time to roll your rucksacks

1646
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,477
and stow your tent poles
Get up, get up!

1647
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,107
Get up!

1648
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:53,015
Huh? We have
a long way back home.

1649
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:58,320
You won some money last night
Do you remember?

1650
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,188
No. How much?

1651
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,990
5,000. And...

1652
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:06,794
we just have enough left
for a lovely candlelight dinner.

1653
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:09,300
Just enough?
Did I gamble it all away?

1654
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,894
No no, come on

1655
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:16,405
Wyatt?!

1656
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:19,536
- What?
- What the hell is this?

1657
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,610
Oh my God, it's gorgeous.

1658
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:26,208
Like I said, just enough left.

1659
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,412
Huh?

1660
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:33,723
- I'm glad you like it.
- I love double weddings.

1661
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:43,024
Oh God, no no no!

1662
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:46,231
Of all the stinky tuna fish
in the world, it had to be you!

1663
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:49,207
Oh God, what did I do
to deserve this?

1664
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,471
- Karma's a bitch!
- I'm gonna be sick.

1665
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,338
So sick.

1666
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:57,713
If this is not some hillbilly shit
I do not know what is.

1667
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,412
Well, come on, come on, let's go.

1668
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,955
We have a long way back home.

1669
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:04,354
Come on, get up.

1670
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:06,153
Okay.

1671
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:08,490
I have the wedding pictures.

1672
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:10,426
And they're driving home with me.

1673
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,561
- There are pictures?!
- Yeah.

1674
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,761
- Pictures?
- Uh-huh. Goodbye.

1675
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:19,361
- Bye.
- Let's go!

1676
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:48,894
Once a long long time ago in history.

1677
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:53,996
Was born a man unlike
any other I'd seen.

1678
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:58,374
Kicked out of school
for wearing jeans by age 13.

1679
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:03,405
Gang-bangs and naked boys
are his two favorite things.

1680
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:06,418
- Whoa.
- He wants to be.

1681
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:09,683
- Yeah.
- Your fantasy.

1682
01:29:09,744 --> 01:29:13,248
He's not looking for trouble,
but he might blow your brother.

1683
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:16,090
- Whoa.
- He's living the dream.

1684
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:20,064
- Yeah.
- So obscene.

1685
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:25,833
Look out, boys,
he's the queen of the road.

1686
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:32,244
There on his nightstand
lies a dirty magazine.

1687
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:36,806
Panties on the floor
and cum stains on the sheets.

1688
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:41,718
A force of nature that can
never be contained, no.

1689
01:29:41,776 --> 01:29:46,816
His loins will burn a hole
straight into your brain.

1690
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,623
- Whoa.
- He wants to be.

1691
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:53,154
- Yeah.
- Your fantasy.

1692
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:56,668
He's not looking for trouble
but he might blow your brother.

1693
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:59,204
- Whoa.
- He's living the dream.

1694
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:03,037
- Yeah.
- So obscene.

1695
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:09,048
Look out, boys,
he's the queen of the road.

1696
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:41,244
Oooh.

1697
01:30:41,302 --> 01:30:44,010
That's right.

1698
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:47,985
Come on, you're not
a little curious?

1699
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:52,047
- Mmm, it feels so good.
- Whoa.

1700
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:53,786
Yeah.

1701
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,632
- Whoa.
- He's the queen of the road.

1702
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:03,191
Yeah.

1703
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:11,004
- Whoa.
- He wants to be.

1704
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:14,672
- Yeah.
- Your fantasy.

1705
01:31:14,735 --> 01:31:18,080
He's not looking for trouble
but he might blow your brother.

1706
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:20,676
- Whoa.
- He's living the dream.

1707
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:24,621
- Yeah.
- So obscene.

1708
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:30,561
Look out, boys,
he's the queen of the road
