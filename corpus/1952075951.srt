00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,249
CRY OF THE OWL

2
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,424
Oh great. Thanks.

3
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,311
Oh, shit.

4
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,645
Robert. Perfect.

5
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,651
Can I grab you for one moment?

6
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,381
Let me introduce you
to the guys from Milton.

7
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,479
I'm just giving them a little tour.

8
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,351
This is Robert Forrester.
Robert used to be at Joseph Keys.

9
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,397
Joseph Keys? Wow. Really?
Why did you leave?

10
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,259
Hey...

11
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,291
Joseph's a great, great company, but
I really had to get out of the city.

12
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,303
The guns, the drugs, the prostitution...

13
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,566
It's a lot of fun, but after
a while it gets a little boring.

14
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,339
Okay. Sorry
to have interrupted you.

15
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,849
We should let you get
on with your work.

16
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,284
Gentlemen, if you'd follow me.
This way.

17
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,927
"The guns, the drugs,
the prostitution"?

18
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,267
Shit...

19
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,442
So, it's Sally's and
my anniversary tonight.

20
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,436
- Oh, congratulations, man.
- Thanks man, thanks.

21
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,948
- I am screwed though...
- Oh, you didn't forget did you?

22
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,981
Yeah, I gotta go get some flowers
and chocolates and all that stuff...

23
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,617
that gets one laid, you know.
But I left my wallet at home.

24
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,995
You need to borrow some cash, man?

25
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,864
Would that be alright?
I feel bad asking.

26
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,661
No. Don't feel bad.
How much do you need?

27
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,256
- That's great.
- Allright.

28
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,030
You're a good man.
I could fuck you right now.

29
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,397
I could, in a friendly
way though, not in a gay way.

30
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,034
Man, I think I'll take a pass.

31
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,342
Hey... Mister Wyncoop.

32
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,538
Hey Rabbit.

33
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,808
Sunflowers!
Are those for me?

34
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,509
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,186
- You hungry?
- Always.

36
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,222
I thought you were
gonna kill me tonight.

37
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,991
Why do you have
a knife in your hand?

38
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,994
I keep thinking that
I hear somebody out there.

39
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,634
- Where? Out there?
- Yeah.

40
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,339
Greg! No!
Don't go outside please.

41
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,608
No Greg,
I didn't see anyone, Greg.

42
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,277
If there's anybody out here
I'm gonna cut your fucking head off!

43
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,316
There's nobody out there.
Would you please come inside?

44
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,328
You got to get a dog Jenny.
A Doberman, something mean and nasty.

45
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,694
Oh, great. What?
So it can attack me first?

46
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:36,870
Fuck!

47
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,378
Peace and quiet
driving you crazy yet?

48
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,552
This is rush hour here, you know.

49
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,489
So, how are you finding the place?

50
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,925
The house, it's great.

51
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,765
Yeah? Well, you know, we thought
of selling it at one point, but...

52
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,529
it was my mother's old place
just before she passed away, and...

53
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,560
Yeah, you said, you said.

54
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,000
We lived with her, you know...

55
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,804
the wife and I, just
after we got married.

56
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,674
Yeah. Bet that
wasn't much fun, huh?

57
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,576
No, no, no, no. We all got
on great together.

58
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,777
That's why we bought the house across
the way, so we could be closer to her.

59
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,346
Yeah well, if you need anything,
just let me know.

60
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,485
Okay. Thank you.

61
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,724
Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.

62
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,658
Traffic was just insane.

63
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,335
Can we proceed, counsellor?

64
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,767
Yes. We have filed documents with
the state of New York for divorce.

65
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,274
I would like to state on behalf
of my client...

66
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,803
Wait. I'd like to have a word
with my husband before we start.

67
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,515
- Be careful...
- No, I know. It's okay.

68
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,321
Do you think I could talk
to you outside?

69
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,192
No.

70
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,224
Okay.

71
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,428
This is awkward.

72
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:55,078
Look, Robert, I know I'm the one
who wanted this divorce but...

73
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:58,881
I've...

74
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,854
I've changed my mind.

75
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,761
Well...

76
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,629
I'm joking.

77
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,835
I'm joking.

78
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,041
I'm joking.

79
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,114
I'm sorry, I thought it would
be funny, but it wasn't really funny.

80
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:36,982
Can we move on please?
This is quite an expensive meeting.

81
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,547
- Good point.
- Yes, yes of course.

82
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:44,351
I got your memo, and here's the deal
memo that your office drafted.

83
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,697
We just disagree on a few points...

84
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,310
Robert, Robert, hey...

85
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,440
Hi, Jack.

86
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,742
How are you doing? You got
here alright yeah? Good, good.

87
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,419
Look, I wanted to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

88
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,784
- This is Elaine.
- Hi.

89
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,721
She's 34, she's a doctor
and she's single.

90
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:17,390
This is my friend Robert,
he's 37, he's a designer...

91
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,598
he's soon to be divorced.

92
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,465
So you'll have a lot to talk about,
I'm sure.

93
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,494
Jack, I need you for a moment.

94
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,097
Just... excuse me.

95
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,571
Asshole...

96
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,709
The truth is, I saw you standing
alone and I thought, you know...

97
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,671
he's not mixing very well.

98
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,976
Well, I'm mixing my drinks,
does that count?

99
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,489
Could I introduce you?
Would you like that?

100
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,422
Not really.

101
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,160
I know it's a little bit awkward
meeting people, but...

102
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,800
you have to be brave.
There are some lovely people here.

103
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,791
Brave? Me? No way.

104
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,628
I'm a total coward.
I'm still afraid of the dark.

105
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,007
Do you sleep with the lights on?

106
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,540
Hey, Robert.

107
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,419
- This is Walt. Have you met?
- No... no.

108
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,478
Hey Walt,
this is Robert over there.

109
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,557
Walt, this is Robert.
Robert's nice.

110
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,456
You're kinda heavy...

111
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:29,933
Hey, Jack, I'm not feeling too great,
I think I'm gonna get going.

112
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,028
- Are you leaving?
- I've got a headache coming on, I...

113
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,539
Is it bad? Coz I could like
get you an aspirin or something?

114
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,737
It's not too bad,
it's probably just a tumour.

115
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,474
- Are you okay to drive?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

116
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,848
I could drive you home, if you want.

117
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,012
No, that's fine, I'm okay.
It's not too bad that I can't drive.

118
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,681
I'm fine. Thank you.

119
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,157
Okay. Well, thanks for coming.
I'm glad you could come.

120
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,854
- Listen, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
- Of course, of course. No problem.

121
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:57,691
Alright.

122
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,388
Bye, Robert.

123
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,695
- I'll see you Monday.
- Alright, will do. Take care man.

124
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,633
Oh god...

125
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,369
It's okay.

126
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,543
No, no, no, no,
please don't be afraid.

127
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,239
I'm so, so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

128
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,482
My name's Robert Forrester.

129
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:00,983
Stand right there!

130
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,249
Thanks.

131
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,352
Are you going to call the police?

132
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:18,630
You should call the police.
You probably should, I think.

133
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,283
Look, it's no excuse, but...

134
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,292
I'm leaving.

135
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:43,761
What?

136
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:46,556
What?

137
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,392
What were you gonna say?

138
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,435
I was gonna say that...

139
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,310
Look, can I be honest with you?

140
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,510
I've been here a few times before, okay?

141
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,118
I just watch you in the kitchen,
doing stuff.

142
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:17,593
Listening to music, cooking,
cleaning... nothing else.

143
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,691
I know that sounds really bad,
but it's innocent, I swear to you.

144
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:33,276
You look so happy.
You make me feel happy.

145
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:39,079
Lately I've felt very Ionely
and depressed...

146
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:46,388
I promise you, I will never
come here ever again. Ever.

147
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,488
Depression can crush you.

148
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,333
You know about that?

149
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,409
Do you want to come in?

150
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,343
What?

151
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,113
If we're gonna talk,
I'd rather do it inside.

152
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,376
I've made some coffee.
Do you want some?

153
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,545
Yeah.

154
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,310
Sit down.

155
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,378
It's okay.

156
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,501
Thank you.

157
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,729
Do you live around here?

158
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:09,338
Yeah, over in Humbert.

159
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,100
- Where do you work?
- Lavigne Aeronautics.

160
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,482
Where do you work?

161
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,545
In a bank near Crystal Falls.

162
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,200
Do you think things happen
for a reason?

163
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,613
What? You mean like fate?

164
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,317
Yeah, meeting like this.

165
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,316
I don't really, but...

166
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,223
I don't know.

167
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:09,562
When I was about fifteen,
this man came to stay at our house.

168
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,866
And I got it into my head
that this man, my father's friend...

169
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,106
represented death...

170
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:26,416
Right after he left my little brother
got really sick...

171
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,987
and he died a week later.

172
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:32,989
I'm sorry.

173
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:41,430
Do you really think that your brother
died because this man came to your house?

174
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,464
If I said yes,
you'd think I was crazy, right?

175
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:54,536
Well look, I'm in no position
to call anyone crazy.

176
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,545
We were meant to have
this conversation, you and I.

177
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,463
I think you should go now.

178
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,299
You want a cookie?

179
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,270
Alright. Thank you.

180
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,780
- Good night.
- Good night.

181
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,220
I hope you feel better soon.

182
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:43,253
My name's Jenny by the way.
Jenny Thierolf.

183
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,325
This is really good of you.

184
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,563
Yeah, well, let's just get this
over with as quickly as possible.

185
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,507
Come on, Robert, don't tell me you've
got somewhere better to be...

186
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,907
on a Friday night
than a storage unit?

187
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,473
I keep meaning to ask you,
why did you leave all your crap...

188
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,811
sorry, your stuff... your stuff.

189
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,575
Why did you leave all
your stuff behind anyway?

190
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,387
Don't you need it out
there in Hicksville?

191
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,357
Oh, I know! You're planning
on coming back!

192
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,429
You're planning on coming back
to me aren't you?

193
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,660
I knew it. I knew it, and who
could blame you anyway, right?

194
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,106
So, have you met anyone else
since we broke up?

195
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:08,539
I bet you have. Cos you do fall
in love at the drop of a hat.

196
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,396
Sorry.

197
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,009
You know, I really don't think
your passport's in here.

198
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,844
I was very thorough when I packed.

199
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,353
Twenty seven pens. Fourteen pencils.
Two erasers.

200
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,492
I forgot you were this anal.

201
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,587
This is a bit...

202
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,824
special needs, don't you think?

203
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,269
So, are you feeling
any better these days?

204
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,439
You heard about that guy from
downtown who killed his family, right?

205
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,874
They're blaming
the medication he was taking.

206
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,145
It was the same stuff you were on.

207
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,248
Oh my God, that could have been me.

208
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,628
What? It could have been.

209
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,644
I found it!

210
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,475
Told you.

211
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,519
What?

212
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,228
- You hear any more noises recently?
- What?

213
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,301
No. No.

214
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,974
I hate you living out here,
you're too cut off.

215
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:20,478
I love living out here.
This is my dream home.

216
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,711
Dream home?

217
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,584
If you pull on it,
it's just going to get worse.

218
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,449
Please, will you let
me fix this for you?

219
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,421
No. I like it like that.

220
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,390
It reminds me of Jimmy Stewart's
loose banister.

221
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,013
What?

222
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,787
- 'It's A Wonderful Life'?
- It sure is.

223
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,895
That's a nice shirt, I've not seen
that one on you before.

224
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,663
This? Sure you have.

225
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,837
Greg, I have to get to the oven.

226
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,042
Well, I am not going
to let you go, Jenny.

227
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,607
What? Ever?

228
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,743
That's right.

229
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,318
We are never gonna
move from this spot.

230
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,793
And what will we do for food?

231
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,256
Well, we can eat each other.

232
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,467
Greg, the chicken pie's gonna get...
it's gonna get burnt.

233
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,975
- What?
- She's hot.

234
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,541
- Well, you seem to think so.
- You don't think so?

235
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:36,017
What are you, blind?
She was all over you last week.

236
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,349
I'll set you up with her if you want.

237
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,592
I don't know, Jack.

238
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,991
What with the divorce and everything...

239
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,625
I'm just not interested
at the moment, I guess.

240
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,561
Robert!

241
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,063
Oh, hi.

242
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,568
Jack, this is...

243
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,739
this is...

244
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:03,707
- Jenny.
- Jenny.

245
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,679
Jenny Thireolf.

246
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,808
Nice to meet you.

247
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,785
Well, it's getting late.

248
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,259
I'm gonna be late for... something.

249
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,496
I can't think of what, but
I shouldn't be late for it?

250
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,406
I hope you don't mind me
coming by like this.

251
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,771
No. No. Not at all.

252
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,635
You look a little surprised.

253
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,009
Well, I'm a little surprised, yeah...

254
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,879
You came to see if I really work
here or not, right?

255
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,319
No. No, I believed you.

256
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,052
I knew you were telling the truth.

257
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,652
I was just hoping we could
talk some more, that's all.

258
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,765
Why did you pick me?
My house?

259
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,740
I'm curious.
I'd really like to know.

260
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,413
Well, I was just driving
around in my car and...

261
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:17,750
I saw you on your porch,
you were beating a rug I think.

262
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,586
And then you, you went inside.

263
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,952
And I just felt I had to come back
to see you again.

264
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:35,336
You know, I have been thinking
a lot about the other night.

265
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,335
I think you wanted me to catch you.

266
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:41,807
What?

267
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,539
I think you did.

268
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,882
Why would I want you to do that?

269
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:55,250
I don't know.
Cry for help, maybe?

270
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,560
So does your boyfriend know
you're out with me tonight?

271
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,534
We've... we've broken up, actually.

272
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,369
Well, it's sort of a trial
separation for a month or so.

273
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,498
Oh, right.

274
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,403
He asked me to marry him.

275
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,412
And it's weird, but I instantly
knew that I didn't want to.

276
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,045
And then I thought...

277
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,282
if I don't want to marry him,
why am I still with him?

278
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:29,425
Well, you'll probably feel better
after some time apart.

279
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,021
You'll get back together again,
I'm sure.

280
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,359
No. I decided it's over.

281
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:06,988
Hello?

282
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:10,296
Could we make our appointment
Tuesday instead of Monday?

283
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,001
Do I have a choice?

284
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,161
What do you think?

285
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,468
Tuesday it is.
Good night.

286
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,569
I've just had the worst day ever.

287
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,383
Look Nickie... I don't mean
to be funny or anything, but...

288
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,644
it's actually three in the morning.

289
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:32,982
Hello?

290
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,893
I really wish I'd never met you.

291
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,522
Oh, fuck.

292
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,093
- Hi.
- Hey.

293
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,336
- We are going for a walk in the woods.
- Who is we?

294
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,529
Me and some friends of mine.
And you.

295
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,337
I don't know about that.

296
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,574
Why? You have
some place better to be?

297
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,745
No. It looks like it's gonna rain.

298
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,979
No, I heard, it's gonna clear up.

299
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,587
Are you gonna tread
on my happiness, Robert?

300
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,902
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm fine.

301
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,273
If you don't mind, we're gonna keep
going, we don't want to keep stopping.

302
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,674
Oh, sure.
You guys go ahead.

303
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,510
I don't think your friend likes me.

304
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,543
Who Susie? No.

305
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,712
Well, you just broke up with Greg...

306
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,083
and then you bring along
this total stranger to meet them?

307
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,347
Can't you see how that looks?

308
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,290
I don't care how it looks.
We're friends now, right?

309
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,227
Hey, Jenny, Bill,
I'm just gonna take a breather!

310
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,636
Jenny's pretty fit.

311
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,408
Yeah, well, she's
a lot younger than you, isn't she?

312
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,244
- I love Jenny, she's a great girl.
- Yeah, she is.

313
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,917
I just wish she wasn't
such a dumb romantic.

314
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,054
What's so bad about that?

315
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,054
Well...

316
00:33:56,234 --> 00:34:01,536
Romantics believe in love at first
sight and all that bullshit?

317
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:07,639
I think people who lose their hearts
too easily are never very happy in life.

318
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,947
- Do you know Greg? Her Ex?
- I don't, no.

319
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,378
He's such a nice guy.

320
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,589
I saw him the other day
and he's a mess.

321
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,750
Has no idea why Jenny dumped him.

322
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,496
And she hasn't told us very much
about you.

323
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,396
I don't even know how you two met.

324
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,300
You guys! The sun's going down!
It's beautiful!

325
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,538
Well, we should get going,
I guess.

326
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,013
God it's like heaven up here.
Isn't it great?

327
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,280
Since I've broken up with Greg,
things seem different somehow...

328
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,475
more colourful, more real.

329
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,453
Do you know what I mean?
Do you?

330
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,855
No? Ah, what am I saying...

331
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,555
No, I know what you mean.
It sounds nice.

332
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,563
I'm the opposite.
I'm just sorry, I...

333
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:42,332
I walk around in a daze sometimes,
you know, like I'm still asleep.

334
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,969
It's like I'm in a bubble
or something.

335
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,412
Be nice to get back
to the real world.

336
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:55,408
Well, bubbles can burst.

337
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,322
Look, I haven't been totally
honest with you.

338
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,823
I'm kind of married.

339
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:06,727
Kind of?

340
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,232
Yeah, I'm...
I'm getting a divorce.

341
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,429
Oh. So it's okay then.

342
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,139
I really don't think
it's a good idea.

343
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,108
I think it is.

344
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,485
Hey, how are you guys
doing tonight, huh?

345
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,819
What is wrong with you?

346
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,783
- Hey, Robert Forrester?
- Oh, Jesus Christ...

347
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,692
Is that right?
Is that right?

348
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,930
Yeah, we've not met.
I'm Greg. Greg Wyncoop.

349
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,830
- Stop it, Greg.
- Shake my hand, asshole.

350
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,028
- Shake my fucking hand.
- Are you out of your mind?

351
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,903
Who the fuck is this guy? Huh?

352
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,871
Jenny, I think I'm,
I'm gonna... leave, okay?

353
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,537
- No, Robert, you don't have to go.
- No, Robert, you don't have to go.

354
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,743
Hey! Stop it! I mean it!
I will never speak to you again.

355
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,117
I'm gonna go, okay?
I want to go, Jenny.

356
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,347
It was nice meeting you, Robert.

357
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,355
What is going on, huh?

358
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,253
Oh, yeah!

359
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:48,790
Sorry man.

360
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:57,264
So you're getting that promotion?
That's good news.

361
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,576
Are you gonna take it?
I mean, you gotta take it.

362
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,601
I don't know, man.
Philadelphia?

363
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,846
- Philly's a fun town.
- You been there?

364
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:06,779
No.

365
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,250
I know it feels like you just got here
and then you're taking off again...

366
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,687
but it's good news.

367
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,788
I'm jealous.

368
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:20,190
Yeah. I don't like
moving around too much, you know.

369
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,626
It makes me feel like a hobo.

370
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,892
- Makes you feel like a homo?
- Yeah, like a homo.

371
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,767
Goddammit. Did you see that?

372
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,735
That was a hell of strike, Chris!

373
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,372
Bastard.

374
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,708
9 times out of 10
the fucker does that.

375
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,219
He's got such a stupid way
of throwing the ball, too.

376
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,896
How did you know I was here?

377
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,728
Oh, well, I called your office and
I'd just missed you.

378
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,397
Somebody told
me that you'd be here.

379
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,735
- I hope you don't mind.
- No.

380
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:07,442
It's just...

381
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,970
Greg's been saying some things
about you to some of our friends.

382
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,016
Like what?

383
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:19,820
Like... like you won't leave me alone.
Like you're dangerous...

384
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,358
and that you've been stalking me.

385
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,463
And that we met because you were
hanging outside of my house.

386
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,758
You told him?

387
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,800
No. I didn't tell him anything.
I swear.

388
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,093
That's a pretty big fucking
coincidence, don't you think?

389
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,701
I always had this feeling that somebody
was hanging outside of my house...

390
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:40,005
and so did he.
That's all that he's going on.

391
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,875
I didn't tell him,
I wouldn't tell anyone.

392
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,513
Great.
That's just fucking great.

393
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,593
I'm just gonna see if he's free yet.
I'm going to put you on hold, alright?

394
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,560
Just hang on a second.

395
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:58,553
Hello?

396
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,295
Oh shit. Sorry.

397
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,459
Hello?

398
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,359
It's her again.

399
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:05,899
Oh, shit.

400
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,235
Just tell her I'm
in a meeting, would you Jack?

401
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,499
- Again?
- Come on, man.

402
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,304
Okay.

403
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,675
Hello? Miss Thierolf?

404
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,578
Yeah, he's in another meeting
I'm afraid.

405
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,648
Yeah, it's really busy here today.

406
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,479
Back to back.

407
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,552
I'll tell him you called.
Alright. Bye-bye.

408
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:30,792
I'm sorry, man.

409
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,738
You got locked out, huh?

410
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:27,947
Come on.

411
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:39,059
Hey there, Sam!

412
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,597
Real friendly guy, huh?

413
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,528
'Course, his wife died last year,
so he turned real sour, you know?

414
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,801
You don't have to be rude about
it though. It's not my fault she died.

415
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,844
So, "Under the tree, there's the key".

416
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,851
I make these little rhymes up
to remember things, you know?

417
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,045
Like my wife's birthday.
Could never remember it...

418
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,348
but I got this one.

419
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:09,153
"I see a bird and I remember,
it's gotta be the third of September".

420
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,454
I made that up, so.

421
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,764
"Remember" also rhymes
with November and December.

422
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,123
Yeah, it does.

423
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,965
But her birthday's September,
so that doesn't work, so...

424
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:26,032
- Okay, so you're in.
- Thanks, Mr Kolbe.

425
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,164
I don't think we should really
see each other anymore.

426
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,005
I'm not somebody that you want
to be around.

427
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,879
I had a very bad breakdown last year,
and I guess...

428
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,075
I understand.

429
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,111
I thought that I was...

430
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,656
gonna kill my wife.

431
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,124
But you didn't.

432
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,092
Look, you're not listening to me.

433
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,028
Right? I'm terrified.

434
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,671
I'm terrified one day I'm gonna
wake up...

435
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:36,737
and I'm gonna look in the mirror,
and I'm not gonna know who I am anymore.

436
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:42,848
Nothing you say will frighten
me, Robert. I can help you.

437
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:52,487
This was meant to be. It was.
The way that we met.

438
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,931
I know it was.

439
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,600
Come on.

440
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,799
"This was meant to be".
I mean, it's bullshit!

441
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:05,937
Do you really believe that crap?

442
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,508
Look, I'm leaving anyway.

443
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:20,319
I just got a promotion,
so I'm moving to Philadelphia.

444
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:28,531
- I love you Robert.
- What?

445
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,397
I know that you feel something for me.
The way that you look at me, I...

446
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,167
I can see it in your eyes.

447
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:44,175
I came by your house because
I enjoyed watching you happy...

448
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,139
with someone else.

449
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:51,048
Someone else, okay?
Not me.

450
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,528
I... yeah.

451
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:41,401
Shit.

452
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,359
Hey, no look.

453
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,004
No, wait, hey, no wait...

454
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,800
You dirty son of a bitch!

455
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,260
God.

456
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,930
Come here you...

457
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,320
I'm sorry, I know that I...

458
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,791
Oh my God!
What happened to your face?

459
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,991
Nothing. Greg just
tried to kill me, that's all.

460
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,524
What? What happened?

461
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,727
What happened? I was
driving along in my car...

462
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,406
he cames by me in his truck,
nearly runs me off the road.

463
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:33,342
Then I get out, I try to talk to him,
he tries to take my fucking head off.

464
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:37,837
I mean we're fighting like something
out of a fucking cowboy movie.

465
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:41,748
I throw one lucky punch, I knock him
out, he ends up face down in the river.

466
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,284
Don't ask me why I went in to get him,
because I was fucking furious.

467
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,118
I wanted to drown the bastard.

468
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,955
Oh my God, Robert, I'm so sorry.

469
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,795
I feel like it's my fault.
But I...

470
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,421
I should have known that
this was going to happen.

471
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,365
God, I hate him.

472
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:01,834
Don't hate him.

473
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:06,903
He's just thinks that
he's protecting you.

474
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,036
Yeah, well, I hope I never
see him again.

475
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:21,620
I've been thinking about Philadelphia.
I'm gonna come with you.

476
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,990
Well I...

477
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:35,137
You do know that's not gonna happen,
don't you? I'm going on my own.

478
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,544
Could I sleep here tonight?

479
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,282
Please, I...
Just for tonight.

480
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:56,219
It's just that... Greg has been coming
by my place and I just...

481
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,960
I've been feeling
so miserable at home.

482
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,304
Okay, you can.

483
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,364
I mean, I sleep on the couch.

484
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,805
You can take my bed,
I sleep on the couch.

485
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,539
No, I wanna sleep on the couch.

486
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,378
Okay, if you want.
I'll go get you some blankets.

487
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:28,153
I won't bother you any more after
this Robert. I mean it.

488
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,009
Jenny, what are you doing?

489
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:03,150
- No, no, Jenny...
- Please don't push me away.

490
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:07,827
No, no, Jenny, no.
It's not gonna happen.

491
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:24,538
Jenny, please don't cry.
I'm sorry.

492
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:54,740
Good morning!

493
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,279
Are you hungry?
I'm making blueberry pancakes.

494
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,223
- Lf I were on Death Row...
- Death Row?

495
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:13,924
Yeah, if I were on Death Row, I'd want
my last meal to be blueberry pancakes.

496
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,627
What would yours be?

497
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:23,630
I don't know. I haven't really thought
about it that much, strangely enough.

498
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:27,399
Oh, come on, it's easy. You just
say what your favorite food is.

499
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:33,848
I'd probably have Chinese.
Yeah, Chinese.

500
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,114
But I don't think there'd
be much point...

501
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:40,553
in breaking the fortune
cookie on Death Row, huh?

502
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,653
You know, I was thinking
the other day that...

503
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,287
there's gonna come a point when we
experience everything for the last time.

504
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,800
I mean, I wonder what my last meal
is gonna be...

505
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,701
the last book I'll ever read,
the last song I'll ever hear.

506
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,173
You never think about these things?

507
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,945
I mean, I'm just saying it would be
quite nice to choose.

508
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,718
Because people on death row choose
their last meal, you think that's nice?

509
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,891
If you could choose,
what would your last song be?

510
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,560
Mine would be 'A Kiss To Build
A Dream On' by Louis Armstrong.

511
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:26,861
You?

512
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:30,706
I don't know.

513
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,500
Come on, you're not playing.

514
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,808
"Real Life",
Joan as Police Woman.

515
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,413
I gotta go, I'm very late.
I'm sorry.

516
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,014
Okay.

517
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,541
Sign here.

518
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,017
Well, that's that.
We're done.

519
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,216
I can't believe
I'm single again, can you?

520
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,458
Do you want to go
on a date with me?

521
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:37,738
Hey, Jenny.

522
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,240
Yeah, I just got out.

523
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,576
I'm a free man!
I can't believe it.

524
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,781
Why?
What's the problem?

525
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,043
What?

526
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,351
When you left him on the bank,
you say he was quite out of it?

527
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,821
How far away from the river was he?

528
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,521
Think around,
I'd say about four feet.

529
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,962
It was very dark,
so I can't say precisely...

530
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,368
Do you think he could
have fallen back in?

531
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,304
In the river?
No, I don't think so. No.

532
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,637
He started groaning, he was
coming back round...

533
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,547
that's why I ran, I was frightened that
he was going to come after me again.

534
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,542
But I, I don't think there is no way
he could have fallen back in the river.

535
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,654
Now. You say you just broke
up with Greg?

536
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,427
Well, clearly he was upset
about that, right?

537
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,430
It's just that, if he didn't
fall back in...

538
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,227
then the only other
thing I can think of is...

539
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:38,368
well, Crystal River is pretty
notorious for suicides.

540
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:42,270
Suicide? Greg?
No. No. There's no way.

541
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,442
We used to have arguments about
that all the time. I'm sorry.

542
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,842
He used to say that people who killed
themselves are weak...

543
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:50,141
but I think it takes guts.

544
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,572
No. There's no way
that Greg would do that.

545
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:57,115
Have you called around everyone
that he knows?

546
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,687
Has anyone heard from him?

547
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:01,280
Yeah, we've talked to his friends
and his family, his work colleagues...

548
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,189
no one's heard or seen him...

549
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:08,288
Well, Just so you know, we start
to drag the river as of today.

550
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:23,004
Susie.

551
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:26,009
Hey, Jenny.

552
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,020
I haven't forgotten your birthday.

553
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,057
I'm sorry that I haven't been able
to buy anything for you yet, I...

554
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,684
It's okay, don't worry, it's fine.

555
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:39,858
I know you've got a lot on your plate.

556
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:45,934
So have you picked a date
for your party yet?

557
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,095
Well, it's tonight actually.

558
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:52,400
You should come along.

559
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:54,741
Oh. Tonight?

560
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,070
We can't.

561
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,976
We're going away to...

562
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,480
a cottage in North Bay.

563
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,047
I'm sorry you can't come.

564
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,964
Are you okay?

565
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,498
They've got nothing against you.
It's me.

566
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,650
Robert, don't pretend you're not
there.

567
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,381
Pick up. Pick up.

568
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,456
You're not fooling me.

569
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:51,158
I can see you sitting there,
screening your calls, it's so rude.

570
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:01,105
Okay.
You're not there.

571
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,526
- Hey, good morning, Mr. Jaffe.
- Robert.

572
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:27,463
Listen, there are two
detectives who are here to see you.

573
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,769
They're in the board room.

574
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:34,441
Right.
Thanks Mr. Jaffe.

575
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:40,849
Hello, Mr. Forrester, I'm Detective
Anderson, this is Detective Lippenholtz.

576
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,619
You haven't a found a body yet,
have you?

577
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,089
Well... No.

578
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:52,884
Surely if there was a body,
it would have turned up by now.

579
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:56,488
Well, we've been informed that
Crystal River is a very deep river...

580
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,693
with lots of pockets in the rocks...

581
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:02,704
so a body could be trapped underneath
there for a very long time.

582
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,039
This is what we think:
Greg came after you.

583
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,970
You got in there with a lucky punch,
like you said.

584
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,373
He fell in the water and you ran off.

585
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:17,350
No. I dragged him out
of the water and I helped him.

586
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:20,980
If it was self defense, it's
involuntary manslaughter.

587
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,355
You got a pretty good chance you're
just gonna walk right out of court...

588
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,427
especially if you admit it right now.

589
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:29,329
But when we find a body,
and you haven't told us everything...

590
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,800
You have to see
the bigger picture, Robert.

591
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:09,737
- Hi.
- Hi.

592
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,202
How are you?

593
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:15,839
I'm fine. How are you?

594
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:17,707
Good.

595
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,873
What do you want Susie?
I'm really busy.

596
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,976
- I'm worried about you.
- Well, you don't have to worry.

597
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,385
I am worried though,
really worried.

598
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,592
Robert scares me.
Do you really know this guy?

599
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:31,787
I know you don't like him, but I do.

600
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,257
So I'd be really careful
about what you say next.

601
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:45,433
Jenny. He's a creep.
I'm sorry, but he is.

602
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,533
Don't be so dramatic.

603
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,510
Jenny...

604
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,998
Are you awake?

605
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,269
What?
Did you say something?

606
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,900
I think I just heard an owl.
It kind of scared me.

607
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,276
Why did it scare you?

608
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,516
Owls are a symbol of death,
aren't they?

609
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:34,283
You know that you sleep with
your eyes half open? Did you know that?

610
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,486
Yeah, I've been told.

611
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,796
There's nothing much that
I can do about it though.

612
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,590
It's attractive, huh?

613
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,946
Well, before Mr Wyncoop disappeared
he told a few friends that...

614
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:11,426
you were stalking Miss Thierolf,
and that's how you met. Is that true?

615
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,486
No. That's not true.

616
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,292
We were speaking with
your ex-wife, Nickie.

617
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:20,092
She told us that you had treatment
for some kind of mental disorder.

618
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:23,366
A mental disorder?
I was depressed.

619
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:27,373
I saw a therapist.
I took some pills, I got better.

620
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:29,638
I wasn't locked up anywhere.

621
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:34,073
I don't know what else my wife
told you but we just got divorced...

622
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,413
so we're not on the best of terms.

623
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,511
She said you tried to kill her once.

624
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,988
Woke up one night and you were
standing at the end of the bed...

625
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,490
knife in hand.

626
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,351
She's been telling that lie
for the past year now.

627
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,195
We were having an argument because
she was drunk again.

628
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,763
I was preparing dinner,
I was chopping food.

629
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:59,035
I walked into the bedroom, I'm still
holding the chopping knife in my hand.

630
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:04,678
She's drunk, she screams.
That's me trying to kill my wife.

631
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,379
Okay?

632
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:28,397
I didn't try to kill her Jenny.
I just told you that to scare you off.

633
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,103
I know.

634
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,382
There's something that I haven't
told you.

635
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:45,578
Greg called your wife the day
he attacked you.

636
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:58,024
Hello?

637
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,570
I've just been informed that you
spoke to Greg Wyncoop.

638
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,435
What the fuck did you say to him?

639
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:06,874
"Hello Nickie, how are you?"
What are you talking about?

640
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:09,776
You told him the same lies
you told the police didn't you?

641
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,542
No wonder the guy tried
to fucking take my head off.

642
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,852
Do you know how much
fucking trouble you've got me into?

643
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,685
You got yourself into this
trouble Robert. Not me.

644
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,899
- You want to come in?
- Yeah. Yes, sure.

645
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,567
Look, you said you were
planning on moving out, right?

646
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,404
Yeah, that's right.
In a few months, I hope.

647
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:44,476
Any chance you could make it
any sooner than that?

648
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:47,913
Why? Do you have
someone else moving in?

649
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:49,676
No.

650
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,777
I just want you out.

651
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,000
- Nickie Grace?
- Yeah?

652
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,029
I'm Jenny.
Jenny Thierolf.

653
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,370
Oh...

654
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:16,773
Hello.

655
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:22,708
- You want something to drink?
- I'll have a water.

656
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:27,017
- I ran out of bottled water.
- Tap is fine.

657
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:29,782
Of course.

658
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:40,867
So, you've come a long way.

659
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,833
Just to see me?

660
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,467
No. Yes.

661
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,502
No, yes?

662
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,109
Why do you hate Robert so much?

663
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,584
I don't hate him.

664
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:03,024
You know Robert, he wants
to be everyone's friend...

665
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:07,221
but to be honest with you,
I don't really think he likes anybody.

666
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,426
I don't think that's true.

667
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,865
The man's cursed, if you ask me.

668
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:21,809
I've come to realize that some people
are poison for you in this life.

669
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,512
It's not always clear who they are,
but when you find out who it is...

670
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,049
you have to cut them out.

671
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,691
Okay. Thanks.

672
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,394
No, I have to thank you. Good.

673
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:03,512
Fuck.

674
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,324
Hey man. You ok?

675
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,995
Yeah, I'm fucking great.

676
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,903
- The promotion?
- It's gone.

677
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,933
No. No way.

678
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,537
And I just got
suspended from Lavigne.

679
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:36,844
What?
Fuck man, I'm so sorry.

680
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:40,980
I pulled that guy out of the water.
I fucking saved his life!

681
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,750
I wished I had drowned the bastard.

682
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,293
I need a beer.
You want to go get a beer?

683
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,359
I can't really tonight. I can't.
I wish I could, but...

684
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:59,306
I got to look after the kid.
He's got a touch of croup.

685
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,399
Croup?

686
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:01,340
Yeah.

687
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:06,913
Sorry, man.

688
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,288
- I'm just going to go to the bathroom.
- Okay, sure.

689
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,475
Hi, can I help you?

690
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,369
Oh, hi, I'm just a little ahead
of my colleagues...

691
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,210
I've got a reservation, "Wyncoop".

692
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:43,482
Jed Wyncoop.
You gotta have it there.

693
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,250
- Are you Greg Wyncoop's father?
- I am.

694
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:50,281
I'm so sorry to hear about Greg.
Is there any more news?

695
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,758
No, there isn't.

696
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,886
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

697
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,691
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Let's go.

698
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:03,436
Forrester!

699
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,341
Robert Forrester?
That's you, right? Yeah.

700
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:12,076
Just want to talk.
I just need some answers.

701
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:13,972
Look Mr Wync...

702
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,609
- What did you do to my kid?
- I didn't do anything!

703
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,210
What did you do to my kid,
d'you hear me?

704
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,619
I'm innocent!
You fuckin'...

705
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:21,849
Get me the fuck off!

706
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:23,686
Robert!

707
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,353
Robert, no!
Robert, stop it!

708
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:30,429
Stop it!

709
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,529
Are you okay?

710
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:37,630
Fuck off!

711
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,716
- Hello.
- Mr Forrester here?

712
01:09:58,394 --> 01:09:59,326
Robert?

713
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:09,628
We have some news. A body's
been found in the river.

714
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:12,506
Is it Greg?

715
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,072
It could be Mr Wyncoop.

716
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,910
It could be? Haven't
you identified the body yet?

717
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:23,577
The body was found naked,
no I. D, no jewellery, nothing.

718
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:28,624
The face was badly smashed in
and just that so you understand...

719
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,889
a body that's been in the water
that long is very bloated.

720
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:36,488
Hair, layers of skin have fallen away
along with any distinguishing marks.

721
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:40,796
Even if someone could identify the body,
we couldn't just go along with that...

722
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:43,303
tests will still have
to be carried out, regardless.

723
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:47,476
So you need to do some tests?
How long's that going to take?

724
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,671
We just need to get hold
of his dental records...

725
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,009
that's the quickest way
to identify the body.

726
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,417
It's not him.
It can't be.

727
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:00,387
We'll let you know.

728
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,166
Jenny?

729
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:15,467
I didn't kill him.

730
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,967
I know. I believe you.

731
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:49,547
Body was found a few yards away
from the house, under a tree.

732
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:55,427
Before she killed herself
she called her friend Susie Escham.

733
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,226
Jenny told her
how you two first met.

734
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,192
Bit creepy, don't you think?

735
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:03,601
Spying on a girl alone at night.

736
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:08,470
If you lied about that.
What else have you been lying about?

737
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:12,977
This is for you.
From Miss Thierolf.

738
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:26,953
"Dear Robert.

739
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:30,556
I've always had this feeling about
you ever since we first met.

740
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,467
I know you represented
something for me...

741
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,628
like my father's friend
did for my brother...

742
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:38,399
I just couldn't work out what it was.

743
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:43,067
The signs have been all over the place,
it was impossible to ignore them...

744
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:45,510
and now I know
what I'm supposed to do.

745
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,046
I hope you find your way back
to the real world...

746
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,348
If that's where you wanna be."

747
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,921
Are you going to let me in,
or what?

748
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,038
This should keep you going for now.

749
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,178
Thanks.

750
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:59,777
I'm really worried about Jenny.

751
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:05,756
She's gonna dump him really soon,
she'll see what he's about.

752
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,331
Robert's in a lot of trouble now.

753
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:11,733
Good.

754
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,265
So what do we do next?

755
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,536
Yeah. Hello.
Detective Lippenholtz please.

756
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:57,102
Yeah.

757
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,079
Hi there, this is Robert Forrester.

758
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,280
Yeah, somebody just shot at me.

759
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,320
There was this car waiting...

760
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:10,449
a gun went off and the car sped
away really fast.

761
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:11,787
You don't believe me, do you?

762
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,089
No! The car did not backfire!

763
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:17,188
Look, I need protection!

764
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:20,234
Okay, that's great,
thank you very much, okay? Great.

765
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,993
Jesus fucking Christ.

766
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,356
Oh, God.

767
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:33,370
You're in a lot of trouble, huh?

768
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,250
How did your dog lose its leg?

769
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,720
Previous owner took a bat
to him and shot him.

770
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,561
It's a wonder he still loves people.

771
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:06,136
You were shot at?
Aren't the police doing anything?

772
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,342
They don't believe me.

773
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:17,344
Look, you can spend the night here,
if it'd make you feel safer.

774
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:26,451
You'll notice my wife's taste ran
to the extreme floral.

775
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:28,227
That's nice.

776
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,888
Ah, it's a comfortable room.

777
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,995
I'm sorry to hear
about your girlfriend.

778
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,535
Oh, she wasn't really
my girlf... Thank you.

779
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,533
You know, when my wife died...

780
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:48,940
I had this romantic notion
that I'd go soon after.

781
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,952
You know, the way they say that some
old couples do.

782
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:57,320
Here I am... a year later.

783
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:03,387
Tell you one thing, though.
I'm not afraid of dying anymore.

784
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:11,305
No. When you're young,
that's not the time to die, is it?

785
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:14,068
No.

786
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:20,881
And she killed herself.
I feel so responsible.

787
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:26,414
I feel like I botched something,
a person.

788
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:33,191
I think you need some rest.
Try to get some sleep.

789
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,832
Ah, you're up finally.
That was some sleep you had there.

790
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:24,470
- What time is it?
- Two in the afternoon.

791
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:28,846
Oh my God. I haven't slept
in that late since college.

792
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:30,748
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

793
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:33,114
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

794
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,457
Oh, sh...
I'm so sorry.

795
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,224
Don't worry.
It's just beer.

796
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,925
Can I go and get
a cloth or something?

797
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:20,334
What's wrong?

798
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:47,926
Oh, hello...

799
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:53,333
- Elaine.
- Elaine. Sorry.

800
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:56,564
I'm just going to take a look at
your arm. The bullet missed the bone.

801
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,799
You're incredibly lucky. I'm just
going to take a look at your arm.

802
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:01,437
- Does that hurt?
- No.

803
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,543
Could you raise your arm, please?

804
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:12,713
You can put it down.

805
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:17,490
Thank you.

806
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,180
Oh hey, look.
Another car backfired.

807
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,281
You have 24 hour protection.

808
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,848
You know who did this?

809
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:50,822
We're talking to some people, friends
of Greg's, members of his family.

810
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:54,557
I've got an idea, who did this.
It's Greg Wyncoop.

811
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:58,759
Look, I understand you hanging on to
this notion that Greg is still alive...

812
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,596
but come on, wake up!

813
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:03,531
Why haven't you identified
the body yet?

814
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:06,300
We've had a little trouble tracking
down Greg's dental records.

815
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,535
DNA tests are going to have
to be conducted now.

816
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:12,544
But like I said, Mr Forrester,
you've been assigned protection.

817
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:34,860
Drop the gun!

818
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:36,723
Drop the gun now!

819
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,322
No, no, no, he's getting away!

820
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:40,526
Shut up! Turn around!
Put your hands behind your back!

821
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:42,467
It's Greg Wyncoop!
He's getting away!

822
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:43,902
Put the gun down!

823
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,398
Put it down!
Turn around!

824
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:50,433
Shit! Fuck!

825
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:56,312
- Danny, what are you doing?
- What?

826
01:25:56,384 --> 01:25:57,578
That's our guy.

827
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,346
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

828
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:08,360
Shit!

829
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:14,596
Come in. Haven't you
heard of knocking?

830
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:18,338
Do you know you sleep
with your eyes half open?

831
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,533
What is it?
What do you want?

832
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:23,701
I think you just got lucky.

833
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:31,381
- I don't fucking believe it.
- Neither do we.

834
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,355
Where did you find him?

835
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:37,653
We caught him trying to get
on a bus to the city.

836
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:42,954
He made a call from the diner
before we picked him up.

837
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,999
Mr Wyncoop, you say that Mr Forrester
tried to kill you?

838
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:58,837
Yep. That's right.

839
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:06,652
He tried to bash my head in with a rock
and then he tried to drown me.

840
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,258
He's fucking crazy, he's...

841
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:16,990
he's a psychopath, you know?

842
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:23,597
This is fucking bullshit, man.

843
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,735
I'm not the one that should
be sitting here...

844
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,365
it should be Robert, not me.

845
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:34,279
We know you shot that guy, it's just
a matter of time till we can prove it.

846
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:51,662
Hey Bob!

847
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:58,539
Hey Bob. I just uh heard the news.
They caught Greg Wyncoop.

848
01:27:58,539 --> 01:27:59,471
Yeah.

849
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:03,175
- Really happy for you.
- Thank you.

850
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:07,212
Mr Jaffe he says he can't wait
till you come back.

851
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:09,441
That's great, huh?

852
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:12,281
Well actually Jack,
I'm leaving tonight.

853
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:13,820
I'm driving back to the city.

854
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:16,585
- Like, for good?
- Yeah.

855
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:19,627
Oh...

856
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:22,754
That's too bad.

857
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:27,333
Well you'll stay in touch,
won't you?

858
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:29,368
Sure.

859
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:54,926
What?

860
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:57,331
Do you know what I had to go through
to get you out of there?

861
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:58,888
There's gotta be five people present.

862
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:01,436
You gotta have the prosecuting
attorney, the district attorney...

863
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:04,166
You got me out didn't you?
I don't need to hear about it.

864
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:07,238
I'm sorry, dad.

865
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:10,610
I don't think sorry's
gonna cut it.

866
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:34,419
What the fuck are you doing here?
You come to jerk off?

867
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:36,658
Did you follow me here?

868
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:38,698
Robert, we just want to talk to you.

869
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:45,200
Great.
That's just fucking great.

870
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:46,872
What?

871
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,084
Don't look at me like that.

872
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:05,224
Robert, this is crazy.
This is bad!

873
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,955
Look, he's drunk
and he's really angry.

874
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:10,962
So we have to be careful here, okay.

875
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,325
Robert, you have to help me.

876
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:20,372
You have to convince the police
that I had nothing to do with this.

877
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:22,375
But you did have something
to do with it.

878
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:23,933
No, no, I...

879
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:29,642
You're probably not gonna believe this,
but I still love you.

880
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:34,379
I do.

881
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:46,927
You know, the first time I saw you,
Nickie...

882
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:51,433
I fell for you straight away.

883
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:56,909
You were standing so still in that
gallery, you looked like a statue...

884
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:59,579
Iooking at that awful painting.

885
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:08,110
And then you moved, and I guess
it was fucking downhill from then on.

886
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:17,825
I can't help you.
I won't help you.

887
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,092
Now? What is he saying?

888
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:29,234
Whose is that?

889
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:32,136
Is that me?

890
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:37,408
It's not a good time, dad.

891
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:41,682
What? What is it?

892
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,983
No... no.

893
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,094
Greg, what is it?
What happened?

894
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,863
That guy I shot...

895
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:57,999
he just died!

896
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:00,705
I'm fucked.

897
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:07,276
This is all your fault.

898
01:33:11,385 --> 01:33:12,943
Everybody just calm down!

899
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:14,321
Calm down!

900
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,279
Watch it you idiots!

901
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:42,976
What's wrong?

902
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:46,479
I think I hurt my neck.

903
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:50,418
Come here. Show me.

904
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:53,893
It's alright, it's alright,
take your hand away.

905
01:33:54,895 --> 01:33:56,362
Okay, let me see.

906
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,496
Oh Jesus.

907
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:00,795
Ok... ok... ok...

908
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:03,932
Okay. Take this.

909
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:09,975
Alright, press this towel
on your neck really, really hard.

910
01:34:10,044 --> 01:34:12,376
Very good.
I call an ambulance. Ok?

911
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:22,248
Hello? Could I get an ambulance
please straight away?

912
01:34:22,857 --> 01:34:26,384
What? Look, it's my wife.
I think she...

913
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:45,308
Damned...

914
