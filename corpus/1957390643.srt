00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:13,413
[Radio Operator]
Good morning, darlings.

5
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,583
I'm Alpha One-Nine
and here every day

6
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:18,820
to disseminate the dirt,
destroy the disinformation

7
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:23,858
and hopefully, God willing,
deliver a soupcon of hope.

8
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,061
It is day 592 since the
outbreak of COVID-19 Delta

9
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,398
and you are listening
the Doomsday Daily.

10
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,836
I'm part of the small but
fierce network of radio ops

11
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:38,506
across this sad but so
far undefeated country.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,944
I believe that we are defeated,
but we are still here,

13
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,613
so here's your news.

14
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:48,016
I would have loved
being at that meeting

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,717
where the people in
charge thought it would be

16
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,854
a good idea to take
the healthy folks

17
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,822
and put them into the camps.

18
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,625
'Cause putting lots
of people in camps,

19
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,929
that's always worked out
so well in the past, right?

20
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:03,297
In Pennsylvania where the
remaining isolation camp

21
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,767
is located reports are
clogging the frequencies

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,302
verifying an infected
person or a persons

23
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,304
entered Camp Bastion.

24
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:14,308
Almost all 20,000
people are dead.

25
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,811
Rumors are someone's planted
a napalm in the area,

26
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,412
well, I would love to
know who got their hands

27
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,781
on that kinda shit.

28
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:24,384
[people coughing]
[light dramatic music]

29
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,921
[Man] What do we do here?

[muffled screaming]
[people coughing]

31
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:35,863

00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,841
[heavy breathing]

35
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,381
[Nurse] Your fever's gone.

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,317
That's impossible.

37
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,823

[crow cawing]

41
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,409
[Sarah] How far are we?

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,344
Less than a day.

43
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,948
We could be there
tomorrow morning

44
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,850
if we push through all night.

45
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:31,919
[heavy breathing]

46
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,222
Sarah, what are you doing?

47
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,728
Food, Guy, we need food.

48
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:42,295
[Guy] Yeah, we'll find it.

49
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,732
We haven't eaten since
yesterday, we haven't slept.

50
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,334
Come on, we can't sleep
til we get to Ben's.

51
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,837
[Sarah panting]
[light dramatic music]

52
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:51,739
[Sarah] Are you sure
Ben will be there?

53
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:54,174
When his dad died
he went a little nuts,

54
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,710
became something
of a survivalist.

55
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:58,780
He started stockpiling
things, fortifying his land.

56
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,884
[Guy coughs]

57
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,886
As long as he didn't get
sick, he'll be there.

58
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:09,724
Over here.

59
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,993
[light dramatic music]

60
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,796
[heavy breathing]

61
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,332
Slow down, sis.

62
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,367
- I'm too hungry.
- It has to hydrate.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,070
No, I'm too hungry.

64
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:28,109
[heavy breathing]
[light dramatic music]

65
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,582
You promise Ben will take us in?

66
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,851
He was my mentor
at the bureau,

67
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,753
one of the best FBI
agents I've ever seen.

68
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:39,954
He won't turn us away.

69
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,591
He might when he
finds out who I am.

70
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,926
Listen, we had to run.

71
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,360
At least there we
would've been running

72
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,462
from that nut job.

73
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:50,932
I know.

74
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,435
I know, I still can't figure
out how he found out about you.

75
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,972
[both panting]

76
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:03,978
It was that nurse,
I'm telling you.

77
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,614
She got all kinds of religious.

78
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,784
Like some kind of fanatic.

79
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,021
And he was her god.

80
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,324
[light dramatic music]

81
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,861
[crows cawing]

00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,674
[rocks rustling]
[light dramatic music]

83
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,713
[Man] Do you see anything?

84
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,354
[man hushes]

85
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,024
She's gotta be here somewhere!

86
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:53,094
- [engine rumbling]
- What do we do?

87
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:53,961
How does he keep finding us?

88
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:55,395
It's been weeks.

89
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,965
- [gun popping]
- Run!

90
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,902
[dramatic music]

91
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,274
[Marley] Don't shoot
her, we need her alive.

92
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,041
You need to run.

93
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,109
No, what about you?

94
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,010
I have to protect you.

95
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:09,977
No, I'm not gonna let you die.

96
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,344
Yes, you are.

97
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:15,016
[light dramatic music]
[Sarah panting]

98
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,384
You've known it was
eventually gonna end this way.

99
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:23,124
[gun banging]
[light dramatic music]

100
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,392
Keep running west until
you find Route 21.

101
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,794
Stay off the roads.

102
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,428
Don't stop until
you get to Ben's.

103
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:31,999
[gun banging]
[light dramatic music]

104
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,201
Go!

105
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,401
[dramatic music]

106
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,903
[Marley] Get the girl!

107
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:39,974
[guns banging]
[dramatic music]

108
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,643
[bullets clinking]

109
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,946
[body thuds]

110
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:51,152
[light dramatic music]
[Sarah panting]

111
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,653
[Radio Operator] You
know, I do feel sorry

112
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,589
for those who tried
to run Camp Bastion.

113
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,759
I think it was the last place
pretending to be civilization

114
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:02,362
as if COVID Prime,
I just made that up,

115
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,900
wasn't bad enough, it
just kept mutating,

116
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,835
getting stronger each time.

117
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,004
Things didn't get
completely discombobulated

118
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,672
until the great
collapse due to the lack

119
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:14,441
of healthy workers, which
then caused the first

120
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,711
of the nuke plants to melt down.

121
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,379
Then no food, no supplies,

122
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,351
and you know what that
led to; land pirates.

123
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,753
Marauders acting all
rapey and pillagey

124
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,455
and the cities
descending into chaos.

125
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,757
Survival of the vicious.

126
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,226
But I have a question.

127
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,796
What do the land pirates
do when they've plundered

128
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,099
everything in the cities?

129
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,968
They go into the
country where people

130
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,870
have stockpiles of stuff.

131
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:45,373
And we all know what
that means, right?

132
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,708
We're back in the
wild wild west.

133
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,710
[light dramatic music]

134
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,445
[birds chirping]

135
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:01,088
[light dramatic music continues]

136
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,367
[Ben sighs]

137
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:44,198
[muffled talking]

138
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,313
[Ben yawns]

139
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,285
[radio beeps]

140
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,687
In the "What Does It
Matter Anyway?" Category,

141
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:10,891
they're saying at
Camp Bastion survived.

142
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,860
Like Lazarus going for a stroll,

143
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,731
he just left death's door
and he did not look back.

144
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:19,066
Now, this is, of course,
something we haven't seen before

145
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,337
so you ask, "Did he just
walk out of the camp"?

146
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:24,939
Why yes, yes he did.

147
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,409
After killing a couple
of the caretakers,

148
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:32,313
and like any good messiah,
he got himself some followers

149
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,347
and he's on a quest.

150
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,050
What and where?

151
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:36,884
No clue.

152
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,487
The big brains at the
World Health Organization

153
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,257
said 1% of the infected
could be asymptomatic.

154
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:48,229
So batten down the hatches,
dial up the paranoia,

155
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,498
stranger danger, all that.

156
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:54,368
Watch out for unknowing
carriers and deranged messiahs.

157
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:58,339
I'm not saying you might need
to drop people you don't know,

158
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,274
but you might just
need to drop people

159
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,109
that you don't know.

160
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:03,444
[gun clicks]

161
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,180
Like I tell ya, darlings,
keep your asses home,

162
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,116
stockpile your food, make
sure your guns are clean,

163
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,251
take care of yourselves.

164
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:15,256
With that, all right,
I'm back tomorrow.

165
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,457
Maybe.

166
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,495
[ax thudding]
[dramatic music]

167
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:22,730
[Owen] How much further?

168
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,331
We're close.

169
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,169
Do you think she could've
gotten here already?

170
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,939
On foot she could've gone
straight across the land.

171
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,545
She's either there or
we'll be waiting for her.

172
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,113
When we get her we're
gonna protect her, right?

173
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,982
What'd you think
we'd do with her?

174
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,685
We're gonna breed her,
it feels kinda cruel to me.

175
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:47,321
She's our hope, Owen.

176
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,957
This is how we make sure
this planet keeps going.

177
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,161
But how many others are
gonna be hunting for her too?

178
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:55,496
Shut the hell up!

179
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,702
We follow Aaron's
plan without question.

180
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:04,539
Without hesitation.

181
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,279
He saw death and laughed at him.

182
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:14,849
And death set him free.

183
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:19,753
And now I'm the one who
decides who lives and who dies.

184
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,021
Me.

185
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,357
I conquered this virus
and every one of you

186
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,292
is still breathing
because of me.

187
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,430
I kept the virus away
from you, I pulled you all

188
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,467
out of the trash and
made your lives whole.

189
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:34,735
I gave it order.

190
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,707
And I can make you
un-whole just as fast.

191
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,877
Death gave me the
sight, but it is only

192
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,646
the true believers who
will reap the reward.

193
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:51,085
I will make everything right
again through this girl.

194
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,354
Do any of you doubt me?

195
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,257
You're the boss.

196
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,227
Do any of you doubt me?

197
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,867
Yes, I am the boss.

198
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,336
[light dramatic music]

199
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,639
And why is that?

200
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,274
Because everyone is
looking for this girl

201
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,277
but only I was
able to track her.

202
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:18,879
[birds chirping]

203
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:19,914
And do you know why?

204
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,586
Because he showed me where to go

205
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:28,355
and he will show me what to
do when she's in our hands.

206
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:33,260
[birds chirping]
[light dramatic music]

207
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,564

[Ben panting]

209

210
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,046
[birds chirping]

211
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,584
[Ben sighs]

212
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:58,252
I'm starting to hear things.

213
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,293
It's been too quiet
out here, Dad.

214
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,731
Starting to lose my mind.

215
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:17,505
[dramatic music]
[birds chirping]

216
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:26,013
[birds squawking]

217
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:29,149
Hey, Ben.

218
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,185
Take a second.

219
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,458
Look how beautiful this is.

220
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,759
How lucky are we?

221
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:41,962
Yeah.

222
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,299
Small enough that I
can keep my eye on you

223
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,602
and big enough that I don't
have to see your ass every day.

224
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:50,605
Hey, I'm the one who's
supposed to keep an eye on you.

225
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,342
I promised Mom I'd protect
you, not the other way around.

226
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,477
It was a joke.

227
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:01,448
You losing the ranch
was never a joke to her.

228
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:02,617
- Losing it?
- Yeah.

229
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,487
We ain't gonna lose shit.

230
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:09,591
Your FBI pension is
keeping us afloat

231
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:10,958
until things turn around.

232
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:13,427
[Ben sighs]

233
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,495
You'll see.

234
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:17,965
Things are never
gonna turn around if

235
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,301
you keep blowing through
your money the way you do.

236
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:22,970
Not now, Ben, please.

237
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,006
Just enjoy nature.

238
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,841
Have some fun for once.

239
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,979
It's never gonna be a
good time for you, is it?

240
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,014
You just keep on running.

241
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,517
[light dramatic music]

[birds chirping]

247
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,664
Hey.

248
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:24,231
Hey.

249
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,065
Wake up.

250
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,301
Ben Grant.

251
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:31,972
Hey!

252
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,908
What name did you just say?

253
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:37,545
Ben Grant.

254
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,561
[bag rustling]

255
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:16,751
[birds chirping]
[crow cawing]

256
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,259
Guy Hodges.

257
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:34,935
Damn.

258
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:42,176
[light dramatic country music]

259
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:47,615
Upstairs.

260
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:49,784
Go, first step.

261
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:25,085
[truck engine rumbling]

262
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:29,356
[light dramatic music]

263
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,701

[door creaking]

267
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,567
[suspenseful music]

268
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,167
Howdy.

269
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,537
Name's Matthew.

270
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,106
What can I do for ya?

271
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:21,943
Why, you see, we've been
living out of this thing

272
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:26,113
for awhile now and we're
running out of supplies.

273
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,615
Any of you infected?

274
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:29,817
No, no, we're all good.

275
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,794
Can't help you.

276
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,094
Can't spare anything.

277
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:43,565
What'd you say your name was?

278
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:44,331
I didn't.

279
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,570
You should probably keep going.

280
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:50,638
I've searched for
miles, I found nothing.

281
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,513
[light dramatic music]

282
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,754
Are you Heath Grant's son?

283
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,323
Don't I know you?

284
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,828
I don't think so, but
it wouldn't surprise me.

285
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:16,998
Stop!

286
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,902
All right, all right.

287
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:21,869
What do you want?

288
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,673
Since we aren't armed,
perhaps we could have

289
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,809
a conversation without the gun?

290
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:33,615
[light dramatic music continues]

291
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:41,556
Nope!

292
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:46,995
I know it's the end of
the world but couldn't

293
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,930
you show us some decency?

294
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,898
I'll put mine
down when she does.

295
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:56,871
Ah, that's my friend Marley.

296
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,140
You caught us.

297
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:05,113
A little insurance
always comes in handy,

298
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,915
clearly you're a man
who understands that.

299
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,721
As I said, I'll put
mine down when she does.

300
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:15,857
Well, that's not gonna happen.

301
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,726
So we're gonna have to make due.

302
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,629
Now, listen, as my
friend here mentioned,

303
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:24,799
we're gonna be relieving
you of some supplies,

304
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,002
but more importantly I
think you may have something

305
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,038
that belongs to me.

306
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:31,171
What would that be?

307
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:37,078
That would be a girl
about yay high, dark hair.

308
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:40,180
[light dramatic music]

309
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,181
Haven't seen her!

310
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,821
Not exactly a time to be letting
strangers into your home.

311
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:50,892
No, but maybe we could
have a look around,

312
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:53,260
see if she's hiding
on your property.

313
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,898
Why's she so important to you?

314
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:01,836
She's important to
the future of mankind,

315
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,906
but that's all you need
to know about that.

316
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,042
So, what do you say?

317
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,712
Can we have a look around and
we look and we don't find her

318
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:12,412
we leave, no one gets hurt?

319
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:15,583
Except a girl.

320
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:20,387
If she's hiding
out here somewhere.

321
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,958
[light dramatic music]

322
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,728
Look, I don't wanna kill
anybody, but I'm done talking.

323
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,364
You have 30 seconds to
get off my property!

324
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,800
That's a little abrupt.

325
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,401
[gun bangs]

326
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:39,406
[crows cawing]
[gun clicks]

327
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:40,240
Go.

328
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,785
By the way, the
ranch looks great.

329
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:52,553
Your father would be proud.

330
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:55,857
[truck engine rumbling]

331
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,228
[doors clanging]

332
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,028
Aaron!

333
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,001
We'll find her.

334
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:09,771
How do you know that guy?

335
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:13,574
I know of him
from a former life.

336
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:17,277
His father was a gambler
indebted to the organization

337
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,278
I worked for.

338
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:21,015
This is a sign.

339
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:28,388
Because if death didn't have
a plan for me and that girl

340
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:31,959
then how did we end up here?

341
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:34,195
You could taste the
lies coming from him.

342
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,198
She's there.

343
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:39,934
I'm sure of it.

344
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:43,303
And we're gonna make him pay
for taking what's rightly ours.

345
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,940
[Matthew] We do
whatever has to be done.

346
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,474
We turn around and go back.

347
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:51,512
We'll find her.

348
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:59,987
[light music]
[birds chirping]

349
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,419
[Heath] What do you think?

350
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:35,156
[Ben] What?

351
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,024
What do you think?

352
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,093
[Ben scoffs]

353
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,427
I think it's a lot of work.

354
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,764
Well, if anyone
can do it, it's you.

355
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:46,433
Come on, Benny,
it'll be worth it.

356
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,069
How would it be worth it?

357
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:51,072
You've been out there
in the real world.

358
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:54,542
Out there everyone is waiting
to take something from ya.

359
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,911
What happens if this
virus thing gets bad

360
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:58,746
like they're talking?

361
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:01,215
They're saying manufacturing
might even shut down.

362
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,919
We have to protect the ranch,

363
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:06,988
we have to protect what's ours.

364
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:09,991
It's a huge piece of property.

365
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,361
It would take weeks, no months.

366
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,730
What else is there to do?

367
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:18,599
All I'm asking is to
beef up the fence,

368
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:21,302
grab some more
guns, I don't know,

369
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:23,304
build some more
security around here.

370
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:28,276
Is this about those
guys from the city?

371
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:31,078
No, it's about us.

372
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:34,582
[light dramatic music]

373
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:35,850
I have work to do.

374
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,485
We don't have a lot of time.

375
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,054
We can't trust anybody.

376
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,088
You sound like
you're going crazy.

377
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:43,124
This land is all we have, Ben.

378
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:45,159
It's just me and you out here.

379
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,062
I mean, how would you
feel if you didn't do it

380
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,397
and something happened to me?

381
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,265
Oh, Jesus, Dad,
would you stop?

382
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,466
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

383
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,003
You're losing your fucking mind.

384
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:57,505
What the hell happened?

385
00:23:58,639 --> 00:23:59,807
[Ben] What do you mean?

386
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,008
What kind of
world do we live in

387
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,611
when a boy don't listen
to his own father

388
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:06,380
or a boy don't have
respect for his own father?

389
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:10,284
What am I supposed to respect?

390
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,022
Am I suppose to respect how
you gamble away all your money?

391
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:16,357
Benny.

392
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,992
Am I supposed to respect
how Mom used to sit up

393
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,360
every night not knowing if
or when you'd come home?

394
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:20,328
If you were dead in a trash can?

395
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:22,229
Stop, don't say another word.

396
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay, Dad.

397
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,603
[dramatic music]

398
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:32,940
You know, you tell me what
I'm supposed to respect

399
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,308
and I'll start respecting it.

400
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,778
I gotta go to work.

401
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:42,817
[gun clicks]
[dramatic music continues]

402
00:24:47,755 --> 00:24:51,192
[truck engine rumbling]

403
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:56,230
Here we go.

404
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:02,470
[light dramatic music continues]

405
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:05,006
[gun clicks]

406
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,881
[dramatic music]

407
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:15,249
[gun bangs]

408
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:17,251
Get back inside!

409
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:18,686
Not a chance.

410
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:19,987
Hands!

411
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,122
I wanna see hands!

412
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:26,927
[dramatic music continues]

413
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,533
I know you're lying.
Where's the girl?

414
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:33,734
We can talk about this!

415
00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:35,504
There's nothing to talk about.

416
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,204
Providence brought us here.

417
00:25:37,238 --> 00:25:39,373
And I told you, I
don't have any girl.

418
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:41,342
I can hear the
lie in your voice.

419
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,643
Like father, like son.

420
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:46,414
- [heavy breathing]
- Fuck.

421
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:47,715
We can barter!

422
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,850
[Aaron] This isn't
exactly a negotiation.

423
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:51,085
It should be!

424
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:52,920
Okay, you'd like to barter.

425
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:55,222
Well, all right, may I go first?

426
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:56,957
- Ready?
- Ready.

427
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,259
Okay.

428
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:02,229
You can A, give us the
girl, all your supplies

429
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:04,665
and let me burn your
ranch to the ground.

430
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:10,838
Or B, try and fight at
which point we will kill you

431
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:12,907
and take the girl anyway.

432
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,909
[heavy breathing]

433
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:16,477
And C?

434
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:20,181
Uh, A and B are
your only options.

435
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,384
They're pretty limited.

436
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,252
Now you hear me out.

437
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:26,454
Okay.

438
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:28,589
Think about the long run.

439
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:31,225
If we fight we waste
a whole lotta bullets

440
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,661
and we both know they're a
hot commodity around here.

441
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:34,695
That they are.

442
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:38,799
I'll trade you
food and supplies

443
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,434
in exchange for you leaving.

444
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:45,039
We forget this happened
and go our separate ways.

445
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,442
Doesn't work for me.

446
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:51,178
You see, I am duty
bound to save the earth

447
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:55,149
from this virus and I
won't let anyone stop me.

448
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,354
So now what's gonna happen is
we're gonna take everything

449
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:03,691
that you have and then
we're gonna kill you anyway.

450
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:07,361
- [gun bangs]
- Shit!

451
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:09,263
[dramatic music]

452
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:14,301
[guns banging]
[bullets clinking]

453
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:17,638
Fuck!
[dramatic music continues]

454
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:20,407
[guns banging]

455
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:27,248
[Ben grunts]

456
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:36,724
[bullets clinking]
[dramatic music continues]

457
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:43,230
[Matthew cries]

458
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:44,732
Oh, God, stop it!

459
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:49,370
I will bitchslap you
right through that wall.

460
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:51,640
[dramatic music continues]

461
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:54,509
[guns banging]

462
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:56,777
Your crying isn't
helping anyone.

463
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,247
Jackson is dead!

464
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:02,750
Yes, he is dead, so grab a gun

465
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:05,219
and kill the son of
a bitch who did it.

466
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:06,053
Where's your gun?

467
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,157
Go ahead.

468
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:12,059
[heavy breathing]

469
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:12,893
Go!

470
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:19,733
[dramatic music]
[guns banging]

471
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,375
Stop.

472
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:29,343
Stop firing.

473
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,377
We're running out of ammo.

474
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,112
Matthew, how much do we have?

475
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:32,913
Close to out.

476
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,249
So, what are gonna do?

477
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:37,284
Well, we're not
gonna keep doing this.

478
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:39,554
Jeez, there are five of
us, there's one of him.

479
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:41,523
But he has ammo.

480
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:43,390
Well, then we
make him run out.

481
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:44,559
Well how do we stop
him from running back

482
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:45,594
to the house and getting more?

483
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:46,894
We shoot back.

484
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:48,929
Not a lot, not more than
one bullet at a time.

485
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:50,397
Just keep him there.

486
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,465
[John] Until he runs out.

487
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:52,900
- Exactly.
- And when we run out?

488
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,735
We deal with that
when we get there.

489
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:56,870
Just worry about
keeping him pinned down.

490
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:58,272
That's all we have to do.

491
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:01,108
[heavy breathing]

492
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:07,381
[light dramatic music]
[gun clicks]

493
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,551
[bullets clinking]

494
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:11,952
[Ben panting]

495
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:32,574
[gun bangs]
[light dramatic music]

496
00:29:32,607 --> 00:29:35,309
[guns banging]

497
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:41,949
[dramatic music]

498
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,490
[gun bangs]

499
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:57,865
[dramatic music]

500
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:00,535
[gun bangs]
[Ben groans]

501
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:02,369
[John] I hit him.

502
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:03,437
Fuck!

503
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:08,409
[dramatic music]
[heavy breathing]

504
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,520
[Ben shrieks]

505
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:19,721
Fuck you, Heath.

506
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:27,194
[Marley] He's running out
of ammo, and if he's hit

507
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:29,698
we've got him just
where we want him.

508
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:31,498
[Owen] At this rate we'll
probably be here till night.

509
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:32,567
[Marley] Your point?

510
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,901
[Owen] By then we
could probably go out

511
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:35,135
- and find supplies the-
- We're not here for

512
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,236
the supplies.

513
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:38,506
We're here for the girl.

514
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:44,144
And if we leave and
that idiot inside starts

515
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:49,116
telling people that we ran
and then everyone out there

516
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:50,918
starts to think that we're weak.

517
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,255
And I don't know about
you, but I'm not a fan

518
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,424
of being anyone's bitch.

519
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,359
I'm not either.

520
00:30:58,392 --> 00:30:59,728
He didn't take you in.

521
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:01,028
He didn't take any of you in

522
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,764
because he thought
you were weak.

523
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,401
Are you weak?

524
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:10,437
We're gonna take the
girl and we're gonna kill

525
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:12,607
the rancher and if any
of you think that isn't

526
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,110
what's gonna happen, I
suggest you step outside

527
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:20,948
the war wagon now and gamble
on who shoots you first.

528
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:24,284
[light dramatic music]

529
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:36,130
Thought so.

530
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:38,499
[Ben panting]

531
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,437
Oh shit.
[gun clicks]

532
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,809
[light dramatic music continues]

533
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:50,578
[guns banging]

534
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:56,083
[Ben panting]

535
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:04,659
[Sarah groans]

536
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,164
[Ben panting]

537
00:32:17,772 --> 00:32:20,675
[steady breathing]

538
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,614
Come on.

539
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:28,650
Come on, you fucker.

540
00:32:28,683 --> 00:32:32,019
[light dramatic music]

541
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:34,622
[gun bangs]
[Aaron groans]

542
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:37,525
- My leg.
- Matthew, get something!

543
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,526
[Aaron groans]

544
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,328
[gun clicks]

545
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:42,630
[light dramatic music]

546
00:32:42,664 --> 00:32:43,698
[Ben] Fuck!

547
00:32:46,668 --> 00:32:47,968
[Aaron groans]

548
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,470
[Marley] Hurry!

549
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,842
[dramatic music]

550
00:32:57,377 --> 00:33:02,049
[Ben groans]
[guns banging]

551
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:04,719
[Ben panting]

552
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,893
[gun banging]

553
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:14,562
[Ben panting]

554
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:22,637
[gun bangs]
[Ben groans]

555
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,705
Fuck!

556
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:29,911
[dramatic music]
[Ben panting]

557
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:32,379
Breathe, Ben.

558
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:33,848
Fucking breathe.

559
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:39,286
[steady breathing]

560
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,593
[gun clicks]

561
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:47,394
Fuck.

562
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:55,870
Fuck.
[dramatic music]

563
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:00,274
You can do this.

564
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:03,778
[dramatic music continues]

565
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,650
[Ben groans]

566
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:18,927
[dramatic music continues]
[guns banging]

567
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:24,799
[Ben groans]
[heavy breathing]

568
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:28,603
[dramatic music continues]

569
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,479
Just sit.

570
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:49,757
[groans] Oh, fuck.

571
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:58,098
I'm fine.

572
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:03,938
Yeah, you look fine.

573
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:05,640
[Heath] I mean it.

574
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:06,541
I'm sure you do.

575
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,510
Let me fix you up anyway.

576
00:35:09,544 --> 00:35:11,679
Just rub some dirt in it.

577
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,380
We both know that's bullshit.

578
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:17,685
Oh, that's nice.

579
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:20,487
[Heath groans]

580
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:24,424
I'm sorry, does it sting?

581
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:25,225
Like hell.

582
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,828
Good.

583
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:29,831
It's what you get.

584
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,666
No, not now, Ben.

585
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:35,135
Actually, I can't
think of a better time.

586
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:39,607
[Heath panting]

587
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:41,009
All right.

588
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:45,513
Let's hear it.

589
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,749
How many times have
I told you to stop?

590
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,450
How many?

591
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:52,654
[Heath groans]

592
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:54,022
How many?

593
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:55,023
[Heath] Too many.

594
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:56,858
Too many.

595
00:35:57,992 --> 00:35:59,292
How many times
have I asked you

596
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,629
to add some more
security around here?

597
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:02,864
Why?

598
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:04,732
Because of all the ass
beatings you're taking?

599
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,668
It's not that simple, Ben.

600
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,104
But it is that simple.

601
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:12,406
Ben.

602
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:17,045
Dad.

603
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,048
Dad.

604
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:23,051
Look at me, look at me.

605
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,790
I'm glad you're home and
I'm glad you're safe.

606
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:33,861
I gotta lock up outside.

607
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:42,235
[Ben groans]

608
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,275
[heavy breathing]

609
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:49,877
Rub some dirt in it.

610
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:53,881
Asshole.

611
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:56,617
[pills rattling]

612
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:01,388
[Ben groans]

613
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:04,224
[heavy breathing]

614
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:15,603
I'm gonna need your help.

615
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:21,876
Wake up!

616
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:22,944
Hey!

617
00:37:22,977 --> 00:37:24,979
I need you to wake up!

618
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:25,880
[hands clapping]

619
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,015
I need you to wake up.

620
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,218
[Ben sighs]

621
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,018
Shit.

622
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:36,958
[light dramatic music]

623
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:40,862
[Ben groans]

624
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,146
Come on, baby.

625
00:38:01,149 --> 00:38:06,154
[Ben grunts]
[light dramatic music]

626
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,891
[heavy breathing]

627
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:17,865
[metal clattering]

628
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:40,555
[Aaron] Have you seen him?

629
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:41,388
Nope.

630
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:45,159
Great, so now he's
out there somewhere

631
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:46,160
with a ton of ammo.

632
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:50,231
You're assuming he has
ammo, you don't know that.

633
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:53,134
Then we need a plan, we need
to walk through our options.

634
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,202
Now you're thinking.

635
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,038
He's holed up in
one of those buildings

636
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,673
with nowhere to go.

637
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,908
We could storm in there and
pretend our guns are loaded.

638
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:03,177
Any smart man would
surrender right then.

639
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:05,378
[crows cawing]

640
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:07,915
What happens if
he shoots back?

641
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,550
Why don't we sneak in there
instead of storm in there?

642
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:11,152
Don't you think
he's watching us?

643
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:12,452
John, he's smarter than that.

644
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,860
So if we leave the war wagon
we'll most likely be shot.

645
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:21,428
Right, and if we
stay in the war wagon

646
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,030
we're gonna run outta
supplies and starve

647
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:25,833
or he's just gonna come
down here and kill us.

648
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:29,103
We wait until nightfall, we
could sneak up to the house,

649
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:31,038
storm in, take him by force.

650
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,107
Or you just don't
be chicken shits.

651
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:39,013
What we need to do is
just go in right now

652
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,550
and shoot this fucker
of mothers in the face.

653
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:46,287
We tracked this girl for weeks.

654
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:51,458
It was destiny that brought us
here to start the world anew.

655
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:53,961
With her blood she will breed

656
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:57,397
and her children will be immune.

657
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:02,136
And they will speak of us as
the people who saved humanity.

658
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,973
You're just being tested.
[light dramatic music]

659
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:07,141
You're being tested.

660
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:09,310
Shit, I am being tested.

661
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:16,017
And I have to ask you, are you
ready to embrace your destiny

662
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:22,123
or do you wanna be just another
stain in this dying world?

663
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:27,295
I was led to you
and you saved me.

664
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:28,663
I'm not turning back now.

665
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:32,499
I'm not going anywhere.

666
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:36,270
Let's show that asshole
who he's dealing with.

667
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:40,875
You're my family now.

668
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:44,345
You know I would die for you.

669
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:49,150
[light dramatic music]

670
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:54,155
The greatest expression
of love is death.

671
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:59,627
[light dramatic music continues]

672
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:07,234
[truck engine rumbling]

673
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:19,180
[light dramatic music continues]

674
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:25,553
[dramatic music]

675
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:27,922
Get back.

676
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,625
[truck engine rumbling]

677
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,294
Get us in there
as far as you can

678
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,195
and then we charge.

679
00:41:34,228 --> 00:41:35,129
What about the barricade?

680
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:36,063
[Marley] Fuck the barricade!

681
00:41:36,097 --> 00:41:37,398
Do it, Matthew!

682
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:38,933
Jackson wouldn't of
died for nothing!

683
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:40,668
Fuck off.

684
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:45,840
You're in my house.
[light dramatic music]

685
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:46,674
Who are you?

686
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:48,242
Why did you come here?

687
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:54,081
I'm Guy's sister, Sarah,
and I'm in your house

688
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:56,417
because my brother told me
that you would protect us.

689
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,786
Well your brother
is full of shit.

690
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:01,455
You wanna know what
I did at the FBI?

691
00:42:03,024 --> 00:42:03,791
Maps.

692
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:09,230
I teach agents how to read maps.

693
00:42:11,132 --> 00:42:12,733
Who did you think I was?

694
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:17,671
[truck engine rumbling]

695
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:20,741
[dramatic music]

696
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:22,610
[heavy breathing]

697
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:24,345
They found me.

698
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,946
Come on!

699
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,348
[wood clattering]

700
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:30,785
[tires screeching]

701
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:34,121
[light dramatic music]

702
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:40,728
Don't let them take me.

703
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:53,374
Put that away.

704
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:54,575
Follow me, now.

705
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:03,417
Go, go, go!
[clattering]

706
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:04,251
Not you.

707
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:07,321
Not on that leg.

708
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,658
How much ammo you have left?

709
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:12,326
Enough to kill
him if I see him.

710
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:14,529
Good.

711
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:16,263
Marley.

712
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,000
You're my right hand.

713
00:43:21,202 --> 00:43:22,770
My work is your work.

714
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:25,039
Bring her back to me.

715
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:28,776
Anything for you.

716
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:37,451
[Aaron grunts]

717
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:43,958
[Aaron sighs]

718
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:52,032
They've broken
through the barricades.

719
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:55,870
Get into the basement.

720
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:58,607
Stay quiet and lock the door.

721
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,174
[door thuds]

722
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:03,043
[heavy breathing]
[crows cawing]

723
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:05,746
[birds chirping]

724
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:30,037
Do you see anything?

725
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:30,838
No.

726
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:33,707
He's here somewhere.

727
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,245
[crow cawing]

728
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,348
Owen, Matthew, come with me.

729
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:44,385
John, check that house.

730
00:44:48,189 --> 00:44:50,157
[light dramatic music]

731
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:52,459
[door thuds]

732
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:03,370
[John whistles]

733
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:07,542
[light dramatic music continues]

734
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:37,938
[Heath] I saw on TV that virus
is killing a lot of people.

735
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:40,274
Lotta countries
closing their borders.

736
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:41,909
Yep.

737
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:47,281
[Ben sighs]

738
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:53,854
Another new reason for you
not to go into the city, okay?

739
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:01,128
I ain't seen a deer
around here in weeks.

740
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:02,863
Maybe it's a deer virus.

741
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:09,504
Well, if we can't
kill one for dinner

742
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:11,673
maybe I'll go into
town and buy one.

743
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:17,778
I just told you you need
to stop going into the city.

744
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:22,916
I said town, just down
the road to the market.

745
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,519
It's a venison kinda night.

746
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:32,359
If you insist, if that's
the case, I'll drive.

747
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:35,496
No, really, Ben, I
owe you for patching

748
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,531
me up the other night.

749
00:46:36,564 --> 00:46:38,432
Oh no, I insist.

750
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:39,366
A little father-son bonding.

751
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,302
We can bond here over dinner.

752
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:42,537
You're in no shape
to drive, Heath.

753
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,540
Just let me go as a thank you.

754
00:46:45,573 --> 00:46:47,975
You know, I can't
think of the last time

755
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:49,678
you bought venison
as a thank you.

756
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:51,345
Usually we kill 'em ourselves.

757
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:53,682
Well maybe if we sit
here longer, try harder.

758
00:46:53,715 --> 00:46:55,949
We've sat here
long enough already.

759
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:57,217
[Ben] Dad...

760
00:46:57,251 --> 00:47:00,622
I mean, we can't
sit here all day.

761
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:01,690
- It'll be quicker-
- Dad!

762
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:06,761
Stop lying.

763
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:09,229
Lie?

764
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:11,965
Just trying to do
something nice.

765
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,867
Oh God, you're so
full of shit it's coming

766
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:16,337
out your fucking eyeballs.

767
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,471
I'm telling the truth.

768
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:20,542
The market doesn't
sell venison, Dad!

769
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:26,447
I'm tired of this.

770
00:47:28,616 --> 00:47:29,684
I'm your son.

771
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:34,556
I'm not your babysitter and
I ain't your fucking sponsor.

772
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:37,592
If you keep this up, you're
gonna lose this place.

773
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,664
If you lose this ranch,
you lose everything.

774
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:46,200
And not just our home, you
lose everything Grandma

775
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:48,536
and Grandpa ever worked for.

776
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,871
I lose all my
childhood memories,

777
00:47:50,904 --> 00:47:53,575
all my good memories
with you and Mom.

778
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:58,613
You wanna talk about
Grandma and Grandpa?

779
00:47:58,646 --> 00:47:59,913
Yes!

780
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:02,049
Well let's talk
about them, huh?

781
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,854
Where were you
when Grandma died?

782
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:07,187
And what about Grandpa?

783
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,288
Where were you, Ben?

784
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:09,591
Fuck you.

785
00:48:09,624 --> 00:48:12,459
Don't tell me about loss,
I sat here and watched

786
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,895
- my parents die.
- I was working!

787
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:17,732
I had a job!

788
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:20,467
You knew I couldn't leave.

789
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,469
Do you know why you knew?

790
00:48:22,504 --> 00:48:24,471
Because one of us had
to be the grownup.

791
00:48:24,506 --> 00:48:26,641
Since when does growing
up meaning turning

792
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:28,942
your back on your family?

793
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,645
[light dramatic music]

794
00:48:30,678 --> 00:48:32,112
Turning my back on my family?

795
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:37,786
My family?

796
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:42,089
Where were you when Mom died?

797
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,863
- I was-
- You were fucking gambling!

798
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:53,434
You were gambling!

799
00:48:53,467 --> 00:48:54,803
It's not the same.

800
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:58,972
Of course it's not the same
because you have a disease.

801
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:06,313
I'd never turn my back on you.

802
00:49:07,715 --> 00:49:09,784
If I did, I wouldn't be here.

803
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:16,791
You wanna do this to yourself?

804
00:49:17,826 --> 00:49:19,359
Then you just go right ahead.

805
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:22,697
I can't do it anymore.

806
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:26,967
If I do, I'm gonna have a
heart attack just like Mom.

807
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,206
I'm done wasting my
energy trying to stop you.

808
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:37,010
It's up to you, Heath.

809
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:45,486
[Ben sighs]
[light dramatic music]

810
00:49:48,656 --> 00:49:50,825

00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:09,777
[feet rustling]
[suspenseful music]

812
00:50:35,737 --> 00:50:39,306
I'll do the barns,
check the deer blind.

813
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:42,075
[Marley] Shoot that bastard.

814
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,948
[suspenseful music continues]

815
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,516
[feet rustling]

816
00:51:27,154 --> 00:51:29,857
[Marley sighs]

817
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:43,303
[dramatic music]

818
00:51:54,782 --> 00:51:59,787
[Ben grunts]
[dramatic music]

819
00:52:00,855 --> 00:52:03,758
[both groaning]

820
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:05,860
You're fucking dead.

821
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:09,396
[dramatic music continues]

822
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:15,135
[gun bangs]

823
00:52:16,871 --> 00:52:18,171
[ax thuds]

824
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,842
[Ben gasping]

825
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:41,729
No sign of him or the girl.

826
00:52:41,763 --> 00:52:42,997
Was that just
sitting up there?

827
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:44,999
Yeah, there's
another one up there.

828
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,535
Based on what I've seen
I wouldn't be shocked

829
00:52:47,568 --> 00:52:50,138
if there's weapons hidden
all over this place.

830
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:55,043
[light dramatic music]
[heavy breathing]

831
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:58,780
Go sit in the blind, you
see him, you start firing.

832
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:01,348
We'll come running.

833
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:02,182
And you?

834
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:05,553
I'm gonna take a
walk in the woods

835
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:07,155
and see what I can find.

836
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:08,756
All right.

837
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,223
Good luck.

838
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:11,059
You, too.

839
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:16,597
[light dramatic music]

840
00:53:24,706 --> 00:53:28,009

00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,348
[Ben panting]

851
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,722

[Ben panting]
[light dramatic music]

859
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,754
[light dramatic music]

860
00:56:59,787 --> 00:57:00,988
You can come out now.

861
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:03,658
[Ben panting]

862
00:57:12,934 --> 00:57:13,768
You did that?

863
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,608
Why do they want you?

864
00:57:23,945 --> 00:57:26,314
They think I can
somehow save them.

865
00:57:26,347 --> 00:57:29,684
[light dramatic music]

866
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:33,955
Their leader, he...

867
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:36,023
He wants to breed me.

868
00:57:43,998 --> 00:57:46,167
[Ben sighs]

869
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:52,673
I gotta put some
lights on outside.

870
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,176
It's gonna be dark soon.

871
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,047
It's gonna be a long night.

872
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:10,524
You know, I don't think
you're lying to me,

873
00:58:13,828 --> 00:58:16,330
but you're definitely not
telling me everything.

874
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:20,067
Think about how that helps us.

875
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,743
[light dramatic music]

876
00:58:28,776 --> 00:58:31,645
[ground rustling]

877
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,682
[suspenseful music]

878
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:58,606
[light dramatic music]

879
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:08,249
I know your footsteps.

880
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:13,721
In a pride of lions
the female does most,

881
00:59:13,754 --> 00:59:15,256
if not all the hunting.

882
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:16,824
Do know how a male lion hunts?

883
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:19,226
No.

884
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,795
Okay, I'll tell ya.

885
00:59:20,828 --> 00:59:25,366
He sits on his ass in
the brush and he waits

886
00:59:25,399 --> 00:59:27,168
for the prey to come to him.

887
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:30,604
I am the male lion.

888
00:59:30,638 --> 00:59:32,339
I am the king of the jungle.

889
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:35,843
I just wanted to check on you.

890
00:59:37,578 --> 00:59:38,345
I'll go.

891
00:59:39,814 --> 00:59:42,416
You need to get this
done, it's taking too long.

892
00:59:43,317 --> 00:59:46,420
I know it's a big ranch,
but he's out there,

893
00:59:46,454 --> 00:59:48,089
Marley, and so is she.

894
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,560
He knows where to hide.

895
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:53,627
There are four of
you and one of him.

896
00:59:55,296 --> 00:59:56,531
You disappoint me.

897
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:00,968
I'm sorry.

898
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:03,771
Don't be sorry,
that's for the weak.

899
01:00:03,804 --> 01:00:04,672
You're not weak.

900
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:08,442
You go out there and do what
you have to do, get it done.

901
01:00:09,477 --> 01:00:10,644
Make me proud.

902
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:15,983
I will.

903
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:22,223
[ground rustling]
[crow cawing]

904
01:00:23,157 --> 01:00:26,127

[heavy breathing]

909
01:01:10,004 --> 01:01:12,206
- [Ben gasps]
- No, no, no, no.

910
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:13,040
Shit.

911
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:24,451
Ben.

912
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:28,289
What?

913
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:39,733
I have the virus.

914
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:47,107
What?

915
01:01:53,948 --> 01:01:55,482
They don't know.

916
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:57,451
No.

917
01:01:58,485 --> 01:02:01,288
[Ben chuckles]

918
01:02:01,322 --> 01:02:02,524
[light dramatic music]

919
01:02:02,557 --> 01:02:03,592
They think I'm
immune, but I'm not.

920
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:06,961
I'm a carrier, I
just don't get sick.

921
01:02:14,468 --> 01:02:16,337
The refugee camp
in Pennsylvania.

922
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:21,909
That was you.

923
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:23,143
That was me.

924
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:28,148
All those people.

925
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:29,750
I didn't know what I was.

926
01:02:29,783 --> 01:02:33,020
I showed up and everyone
started getting sick.

927
01:02:35,322 --> 01:02:36,957
They were all dying
except for me.

928
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:46,166
The doctors couldn't
tell people that

929
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,370
they messed up by letting
me in, so they hid it.

930
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:54,308
They told everyone I was immune
and everyone believed it.

931
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,144
They threw me in
a quarantine cell

932
01:02:57,177 --> 01:02:58,812
and said that they
were gonna send me off

933
01:02:58,846 --> 01:03:00,047
to some research place.

934
01:03:01,982 --> 01:03:03,183
But I've heard stories.

935
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:07,522
You don't know what they
do to people like me.

936
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:12,493
They experiment, it's like
being a fucking rat in a cage

937
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:13,961
waiting to be dissected.

938
01:03:16,665 --> 01:03:18,465
Was your brother
Guy a carrier?

939
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:22,704
He was sick and
helped me escape.

940
01:03:24,204 --> 01:03:26,508
Neither one of us knew
how long he would make it.

941
01:03:33,682 --> 01:03:34,683
Am I sick?

942
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:39,621
[light dramatic music]

943
01:03:39,654 --> 01:03:40,689
I don't know.

[crickets chirping]
[light dramatic music]

945
01:04:14,922 --> 01:04:16,390
I'll see who it is.

946
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:19,460
- Ben-
- Go on.

947
01:04:21,095 --> 01:04:21,895
Go on.

948
01:04:23,397 --> 01:04:24,398
All right.

949
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:29,537
[crickets chirping]

950
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,576
What do you want?

951
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:35,876
[Man] What we always want.

952
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:38,879
[Heath] You
shouldn't of come here.

953
01:04:38,912 --> 01:04:43,917
[muffled talking]
[fork tapping]

954
01:04:44,753 --> 01:04:46,788
Heath, we came to collect.

955
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:49,624
I just need more time.

956
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:50,924
[Man] You've had
more than enough.

957
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:53,795
Just a little
more, I'm so close.

958
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:55,062
Close?

959
01:04:55,095 --> 01:04:56,096
Is that a joke?

960
01:04:57,632 --> 01:04:58,733
Close? Hear that?

961
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:01,301
You owe us more money every time

962
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:02,771
you set foot outside that house.

963
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:06,508
- I understand, but-
- Do you have it?

964
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:10,812
Well then why don't we
see if there's anything

965
01:05:10,845 --> 01:05:12,279
more valuable inside?

966
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:13,848
Not in the house!

967
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:19,587
What are you doing, Heath?

968
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:23,691
Get out of my way.

969
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,395
[rustling]
Hey!

01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:30,998

Dad!

974
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:39,808
Hey!

[engine rumbling]

976

Hey!

977
01:05:45,212 --> 01:05:47,314

It's not your fault.

985
01:07:04,124 --> 01:07:05,459
It's nobody's fault.

986
01:07:08,061 --> 01:07:10,330
It's just the way it is.

Now.

[Reporter] Health officials
from around the world

1025
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,876

[Reporter] To suppress
the mass looting

1030
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:51,919
the president sought to
order martial law in effect,

1031
01:10:51,953 --> 01:10:54,055
but with more than 2/3rds
of the country's military

1032
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:56,456

officers sick...

[Radio Operator]
Good evening, darlings.

1039
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,521
This is the new Doomsday
Daily and I'm still learning

1040
01:11:26,554 --> 01:11:29,157
how to operate this
radio along with catching

1041
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:30,925
all the relays
across the country,

1042
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:34,595
so I'm coming to you from
somewhere in the heartland.

1043
01:11:34,629 --> 01:11:38,166
So if you can hear me, I just
might be able to see you.

1044
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:42,970
It's been a brutal 24
hours, so let's forego

1045
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:45,206
the witty alliterative banter.

1046
01:11:47,008 --> 01:11:48,709
The president has died.

1047
01:11:50,077 --> 01:11:52,180
There's just no more government.

1048
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:55,049
He was the last.

1049
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:59,319
There is no longer anybody
running this country.

1050
01:12:00,555 --> 01:12:02,924
I'm not sure what else
to report as we're all

1051
01:12:04,192 --> 01:12:06,994
just figuring this out, but
I'm just gonna keep coming back

1052
01:12:07,028 --> 01:12:08,229
for as long as I can.

1053
01:12:08,262 --> 01:12:11,032

01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,635
This is Jessica.

1056
01:12:14,669 --> 01:12:16,037

You come to my house, you
try to kidnap this girl,

and then you try to kill me?

1073
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,136
Just wanted the girl!

1088
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:39,046
I don't have a choice.

1089
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,480
Yes, you do.

1090
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:43,751
She's not immune.

1091
01:14:48,723 --> 01:14:50,558
The girl is sick.

1092
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:52,727
Hell, at this point, so am I.

1093
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,831
[light dramatic music continues]

1094
01:15:05,106 --> 01:15:10,011
I have to kill you
or Aaron kills me.

1095
01:15:10,044 --> 01:15:12,847
You can run, you can
head into those woods

1096
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,215
and don't you ever look back.

1097
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,525
[Owen chuckles]
[light dramatic music]

1098
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:27,962

[Marley groans]

1108
01:16:21,282 --> 01:16:23,484
We're gonna go for a walk.

1109
01:16:23,518 --> 01:16:25,953
You try anything,
you try to run,

1110
01:16:27,088 --> 01:16:28,622
I swear by sweet
and sainty Jesus

1111
01:16:28,656 --> 01:16:30,658
I'll put a bullet in your head.

1112
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:34,295
[Marley groans]
Get up!

1113
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:35,362
Come on!

1114
01:16:37,765 --> 01:16:38,533
Move!

1115
01:16:39,534 --> 01:16:42,537
[crickets chirping]

1116
01:16:50,044 --> 01:16:51,846
Oh, my God.

1117
01:16:51,879 --> 01:16:53,280
[Aaron] Well, look at us.

1118
01:16:58,553 --> 01:17:00,454
Let's be done with this.

1119
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:04,825
No, we have to talk
before we're finished.

1120
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:06,961
We have nothing else to say.

1121
01:17:06,994 --> 01:17:08,929
You're gonna toss
that gun aside,

1122
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:10,197
I'm gonna give you
your lady back,

1123
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:11,499
you're gonna get into that truck

1124
01:17:11,533 --> 01:17:13,701
and you're gonna ride
off into the sunset.

1125
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:16,605
Ah, happily ever after?

1126
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:18,305
- That's the idea.
- Uh huh.

1127
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,041
Well, let's think through that.

1128
01:17:21,075 --> 01:17:25,312
So, I toss my gun,
you let her go,

1129
01:17:26,515 --> 01:17:28,449
and how do you think
that would end?

1130
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:31,051
I mean, two people who've
been trying to kill

1131
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:34,355
you all day long standing
in front of you defenseless,

1132
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:35,656
we'd be dead in seconds.

1133
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:36,891
I see how that looks.

1134
01:17:38,259 --> 01:17:40,394
I'll throw my gun
as soon as you do.

1135
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:41,630
You have my word.

1136
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:44,298
Your word doesn't
mean anything to me

1137
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:47,368
because I've been ordained
by the other world

1138
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:49,336
to kill anyone who
stands in my way.

1139
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:51,972
I don't want this!

1140
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:53,340
I'm not a killer!

1141
01:17:53,374 --> 01:17:55,676
I think today you
earned that moniker.

1142
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,484
And now you're standing
with a gun to Marley's head

1143
01:18:03,518 --> 01:18:06,353
and you expect me
just to walk away?

1144
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:09,490
[Ben] Yeah, I guess I do.

1145
01:18:09,524 --> 01:18:11,258
Yeah, I guess you can see
that's not gonna happen.

1146
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,060
I didn't ask you to come here!

1147
01:18:13,961 --> 01:18:15,362
Doesn't matter now, son.

1148
01:18:15,396 --> 01:18:16,263
Look around you!

1149
01:18:17,464 --> 01:18:19,333
I've already won!
[Marley groans]

1150
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:22,537
Toss your gun, cut your
losses, and go home!

1151
01:18:24,038 --> 01:18:25,339
Stop!

1152
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:26,541
Just out of common courtesy,

1153
01:18:26,575 --> 01:18:28,042
do you mind taking off her gag?

1154
01:18:28,075 --> 01:18:30,477
I think she has some
wisdom to impart.

1155
01:18:32,547 --> 01:18:33,280
Fuck you.

1156
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:36,717
[Aaron] Hey, Marley,
how's it going?

1157
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:39,320
[Marley laughs]

1158
01:18:42,423 --> 01:18:44,124
I have had better days.

1159
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:47,394
[Marley groans]

1160
01:18:47,428 --> 01:18:50,331
Boys, I think we're
at a stalemate here.

1161
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:55,102
And the only thing
killing anyone is old age.

1162
01:18:57,438 --> 01:19:01,576
The only prize is still
hiding somewhere on this land!

1163
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:06,615
See, we've been after her
ever since she left the camp.

1164
01:19:08,617 --> 01:19:10,150
It was always about the girl.

1165
01:19:10,184 --> 01:19:11,318
But you're wrong
about the girl!

1166
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:13,053
No!

1167
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:17,424
She's immune and Aaron
sees the big picture.

1168
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:21,395
He knows that she could
change everything.

1169
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,097
But she's not immune!

1170
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,432
That's a lie they
told you at the camp.

1171
01:19:25,466 --> 01:19:27,968
She's a carrier and she
will infect you both!

1172
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:30,170
You're a liar.

1173
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:32,172
You expect us to believe that?

1174
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:33,907
Well, you better believe it!

1175
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:36,777
Because right now I'm breathing
all over your lady's face.

1176
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:39,514
And if I'm sick,
then she is too.

1177
01:19:46,655 --> 01:19:49,023
I can smell your lies.

1178
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:52,026
I walked straight through
that disease, son,

1179
01:19:52,059 --> 01:19:53,827
and came out alive.

1180
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:59,500
The girl is my right,
she is my destiny.

1181
01:19:59,534 --> 01:20:02,803
But your destiny is
gonna get you killed.

1182
01:20:02,836 --> 01:20:05,540
She is mine and
I'm taking her.

1183
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:09,577
[gun clicks]

1184
01:20:12,012 --> 01:20:13,515
Don't do it.

1185
01:20:13,548 --> 01:20:14,549
Aaron.

1186
01:20:16,518 --> 01:20:18,352
I've told you time and
again that I would do

1187
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:21,388
whatever it took to end
this and get her back.

1188
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:23,257
You did.

1189
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:28,195
And I have kept my promise
until now, haven't I?

1190
01:20:31,231 --> 01:20:31,999
You have.

1191
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:35,936
[Marley panting]

1192
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:41,075
Then you do what
you need to do.

1193
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:44,378
I will.

I had this thought
that when I got it

1207
01:21:44,972 --> 01:21:46,940
it would be the virus
that took me down,

1208
01:21:47,842 --> 01:21:50,678
not some dumbass with a gun.

1209
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:55,650
Sorry to break it to you,
this isn't how it ends.

[Aaron yells]

1211
01:22:05,325 --> 01:22:07,961
You're gonna have to live
with what you've done.

1212
01:22:16,671 --> 01:22:17,438
What I've done?

1213
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:18,773
I beat death again!

1214
01:22:20,007 --> 01:22:22,777

1219
01:22:52,674 --> 01:22:54,241
He would've done this again.

1220
01:22:55,476 --> 01:22:58,646
I couldn't let him do
this to another person.

1221

I'm so sorry, Ben.

1224
01:23:20,668 --> 01:23:22,102
I'm sorry this happened to you.

1225
01:23:23,671 --> 01:23:25,105
Don't apologize ever.

1226
01:23:30,512 --> 01:23:31,278
Are you okay?

1227
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,047
I've been better.

1228
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:45,693
I always figured if the
world ended we'd band together

1229
01:23:46,861 --> 01:23:48,462
and help each other and...

1230
01:23:51,131 --> 01:23:52,634
I don't know what to do now.

1231
01:23:53,968 --> 01:23:55,202
I don't have anyone.

[Sarah sighs]

1236
01:24:03,912 --> 01:24:05,647
We do have one
thing going for us.

1237
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:09,216
Yeah? What's that?

1238
01:24:12,486 --> 01:24:14,722
An armored truck with
a tank full of gas.

1239
01:24:17,892 --> 01:24:18,660
Yeah.

1240
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:27,969
It's time I leave this place.

1241
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:32,472
Maybe someone out there's
working on a cure.

1242
01:24:37,244 --> 01:24:39,079
You'll need help
if you're sick.

1243
01:24:40,682 --> 01:24:42,784
Are you coming with me?

1244
01:24:44,117 --> 01:24:47,622
You shouldn't go
out there on your own.

1245
01:24:49,356 --> 01:24:52,026
You got any supplies
we can take?

1246
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:54,696
Yeah.

1247
01:24:56,798 --> 01:24:58,666
We'll be fine.
