1
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,216
Hey, how many boyfriends
have you had?

2
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,344
Come on.
Think about it really hard.

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,888
- 10.
- No. She's lying.

4
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,723
Give her a few seconds
to think something up.

5
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,642
- David's staring at you.
- Boys!

6
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,020
- David's staring at you.
- No. He's staring at me, you guys.

7
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,690
He's staring at me. Please admit it.
He's staring at me.

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,024
He's so cute.

9
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,485
If you were 16
and you were out on a date with him

10
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,737
- would you do it with him?
- That's gross!

11
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,947
It's not gross, Marcy.

12
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,241
Then you'll never have any kids, Rachel.

13
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,243
Yes, I will. I'll adopt them.

14
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,453
I'll just do it once, just to get pregnant.

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,581
Don't you have to do it, like, every night?

16
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,417
I love you. Kiss me.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,043
I do, too!

18
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,591
- Gross.
- What?

19
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,176
Tina farted.

20
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,002
- Jill.
- The sitter came in an hour early.

21
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,339
- Great. Here, let me take this.
- Thank you. Hey!

22
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,383
- Come talk to me while I get dressed.
- Okay.

23
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,763
Where the hell are my shoes?

24
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,890
So how are you and Chris doing?

25
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,769
Well, it's weird. I feel really guilty,
but there's this guy at work

26
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,562
that I'm sort of attracted to.

27
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:40,526
- Seriously? Who is he?
- It's so stupid. He's my sous chef.

28
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,111
- Did anything happen?
- No, of course not.

29
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,532
It's just that Chris is so goddamn
possessive, it's making me crazy.

30
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,825
Listen, I wish Don was possessive.

31
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,620
- You look really pretty.
- Thanks.

32
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,707
Oh, this cake is gorgeous.

33
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,294
Chris stayed late at the bakery last night
to make it for the party.

34
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,171
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

35
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,008
Doesn't seem that long since we were
having Jamie's last bachelorette party.

36
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,468
It wasn't.

37
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,346
Can you cut some limes for me?

38
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,265
Can I give Tina Two a piece of cheese?

39
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,641
That is Tina Three.

40
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:17,229
I'm sorry. Hello, Tina Three. Oh,
you need a new pink bow, don't you?

41
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,814
Where's your sister?

42
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,984
Oh, probably terrorizing the staff
at Nordstrom's.

43
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,694
Have a knife?

44
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,739
How is it that somebody with an MBA
ended up being a personnel director?

45
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:31,159
I wish she'd just quit that job
or stop complaining.

46
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,788
Oh, do not tell her I'm pregnant.

47
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,206
Why?

48
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,625
She had to go to
two baby showers last week.

49
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,003
She almost slit her wrists.

50
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,547
She's already got
that old maid mentality.

51
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,675
- She's up to four packs now.
- You are so mean.

52
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,845
What are you talking about?
She's the judgemental one.

53
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,472
- You are too hard on her, though.
- Are you kidding?

54
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,058
She's picked on me
since the day I was born.

55
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,103
She got the Barbie Dream House.
I wasn't allowed to touch it.

56
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,522
She got the canopy bed.
I couldn't even sit on it.

57
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,357
She said my butt was stinky.

58
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,067
- Listen to you.
- What?

59
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,819
Hello! Anybody here?

60
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,990
- Speaking of stinky butts.
- We're back here, Rachel.

61
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,746
Somebody raided
the accessories department.

62
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,209
50% off with employee discount.
I hope you weren't talking about me.

63
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,670
- That's a bit paranoid isn't it?
- I brought my own pillow.

64
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,548
- You look great.
- Really? I'm exhausted.

65
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,386
- Did you start smoking again?
- Of course not.

66
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,972
- I took my last patch off a week ago.
- Your hair reeks.

67
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,807
Well, other people smoke
in the employee lounge.

68
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,769
- Is that my fault?
- All right. Fine. I just asked.

69
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:43,190
- Look at all these goodies!
- "Goodies." Oh, I hate that word.

70
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:47,945
- I'll make a note of that.
- Sorry. I'm... tired.

71
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,155
- How's Noah?
- Great.

72
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,115
- Don?
- Fabulous.

73
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,243
Good.

74
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,412
Why don't you two both go outside?
I'll bring some margaritas.

75
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,582
I want you both in a good mood
before Jamie gets here.

76
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,126
Please, she's really
looking forward to this.

77
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,838
- I'd love a drink.
- Ginger ale for me.

78
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,978
- That's a pretty blouse. Silk?
- Viscose.

79
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,023
- It's Italian.
- Oh.

80
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,861
It's old. I was gonna give it away.
Would you like it?

81
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:33,699
- No, thanks. It's more you.
- Just thought I'd ask.

82
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,830
You two look so pretty. Here. Move in.

83
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,791
Great.

84
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,962
- Where's Marcy?
- I don't know.

85
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,297
She's bringing guacamole.

86
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,840
She's probably in bed
with her house painter.

87
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,300
- What?
- Marcy's having a relationship

88
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,385
- with her house painter?
- No. She's just fucking him.

89
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,053
- But she's engaged to Mark.
- No, she's not.

90
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,263
- Not anymore.
- What happened?

91
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,724
She sent that painter over here
to give me an estimate.

92
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,309
She didn't tell me
she was sleeping with him.

93
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,643
They have wild, kinky sex.

94
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,604
- Marcy?
- What happened to Mark, Jill?

95
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,856
Oh, you guys are out here.

96
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,233
- Marcy.
- Marcy.

97
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,527
- What? What?
- Nothing.

98
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,154
- Are those new glasses?
- Great shoes. Great shoes.

99
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,280
- Thank you.
- They're really nice.

100
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,448
Hi.

101
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,700
- Let me get you a drink.
- Thanks. I could use one.

102
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,454
- What's wrong?
- It's kind of a long story.

103
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,622
So?

104
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,332
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, wait.

105
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,001
You look so pretty in that dress.

106
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,630
Thanks.

107
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,760
So, I've sort of been,

108
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,347
well, seeing the guy
who painted my house.

109
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,599
- Really?
- Jill was just telling us.

110
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,145
- Jill?
- I didn't know it was a big secret.

111
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,313
So what's wrong?

112
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,732
I thought he was a really nice guy
at first, you know?

113
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,360
I mean, not exactly marriage material

114
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,364
but sweet and really, well, sexy.

115
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,617
Anyway, he started acting kind of weird
the last week or so

116
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,160
and I finally had to tell him,

117
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,955
- "Look, Randy"...
- Oh, God, I hate that name, "Randy".

118
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,832
- It's so white trash.
- Yeah.

119
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:08,335
- He has a twin sister named Brandy.
- No, you've got to be kidding.

120
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,753
Anyway, anyway...

121
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,421
- This is good guacamole.
- Oh, thanks.

122
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,173
Anyway, so go on.
Finally you had to tell him...

123
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:16,927
Yeah, that he's a nice guy and all,
but he's not my boyfriend

124
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,304
- and he never will be.
- So what did he say?

125
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,139
I couldn't believe it. He just freaked out.

126
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,475
He's been acting
really possessive lately,

127
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,768
you know, like he owns me.

128
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,938
And all of a sudden he wants to know
everything I do every minute of the day.

129
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,107
And then yesterday,
I told him I felt like being alone

130
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,818
and he accused me
of seeing someone else.

131
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,237
Which I'm not, but it's
none of his business if I was, you know?

132
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,780
I mean I have no commitment to him.

133
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,157
And here's the really creepy part.

134
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,536
When I went out to my car last night,

135
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,289
I saw his El Camino
parked down the street

136
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,374
with him just sitting in it.

137
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,042
He was spying on me.

138
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,463
- A bee!
- It's all right. It's gone now.

139
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,847
What? I'm allergic.

140
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,390
So, did you call the police?

141
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,642
Oh, they won't do anything.

142
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:09,897
Remember that woman who reported
that her ex-husband was stalking her?

143
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,524
Then he massacred the whole family
at the barbecue.

144
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:15,485
I mean, the police didn't do anything
until after he slaughtered them.

145
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,988
Oh, my God. I am so stupid.

146
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,575
I mean, why did I ever get involved with
him? I always pick the wrong people.

147
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,784
Is he cute?

148
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,287
Wait. I have a picture of him.

149
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,872
- What?
- You photographed him?

150
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,248
No.

151
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,294
You know, at first,
I thought he was really sexy,

152
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,296
but now he looks
kind of psychotic to me.

153
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,881
You know, kind of Robert De Niro-ish.

154
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,051
Will somebody please
tell me what happened with Mark?

155
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,845
Didn't I tell you? We broke up.

156
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,932
- Why?
- Oh, it's such a terrible story.

157
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,228
- Oh, my God.
- He puts his picture on everything,

158
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:53,315
his invoice, his business cards.
It's even on his El Camino.

159
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,441
It's true.

160
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,779
He looks a little cross-eyed.
Sort of inbred. Did he go to college?

161
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,031
Well, at least you didn't marry Mark.

162
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,409
I mean, look at Jamie. Three marriages,
and she's just now getting it right.

163
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,495
Yeah, but at least she went out
and found a better guy.

164
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,913
Let's just hope she found
a better dress, too.

165
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,039
No kidding!

166
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,749
Jerome's a doll, though.

167
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,502
She says they have great sex,
said they do it constantly.

168
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,338
Oh, you guys,
I had this picture blown up of her.

169
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,757
I took it at their engagement dinner.

170
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,512
I don't know why, but I have a
real hard time imagining Jerome naked.

171
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,181
- Don't strain yourself.
- She really looks great.

172
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:29,309
She's got the perfect body.
Look at those shoulders.

173
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,687
Oh, you know, I was watching TV
late one night last week,

174
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,813
because I couldn't sleep,

175
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,940
and that movie came on,
the one she did in Mexico...

176
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,817
- Tropical Maniac.
- Oh, that's right. That's right.

177
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,111
So, there's Jamie
and she's standing there on the beach

178
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:42,072
in a requisite bikini,
holding a machine gun. I'm telling you.

179
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,824
She never gets sent out
for any good parts.

180
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,075
What good parts?

181
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,577
There are no good parts for women.

182
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,662
Do you think it bothers her
that Jerome's going bald?

183
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,790
- She thinks it's sexy.
- I don't know, I like a little hair.

184
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:55,752
Well, it's a good thing, considering
Don has it covering his entire body.

185
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,796
I'm telling you, the last time
he was over here swimming

186
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,756
I thought I was gonna have to change
our pool filter.

187
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,300
Oh, now who's mean?

188
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,886
Jerry seems very comfortable
with his masculinity.

189
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,180
Yeah. I guess, considering.

190
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,684
- What?
- Considering what?

191
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,811
- What?
- I can't tell.

192
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:13,979
- Oh, come on.
- No, I can't.

193
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,564
Jamie made me swear on my life.

194
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,608
- It's really not that big a deal.
- Something about Jerome?

195
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,193
- Maybe.
- Jill, now you have to tell us.

196
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,445
He only has one testicle.

197
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,823
Isn't that funny?

198
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,870
And he still has some semen,
so it's not like he's sterile or anything.

199
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,330
Oh, my God.

200
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,500
And he's certainly not impotent,
but can you imagine?

201
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:36,793
Isn't that funny?

202
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,712
Oh, it must look so weird.

203
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,715
And he hates
for anyone to know about it.

204
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,967
He didn't tell Jamie for the longest time.

205
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,636
Wasn't it obvious?

206
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,472
No. She just thought
he had really teeny balls.

207
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:54,895
Anyway, do not repeat that information
about Jerome, please.

208
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:59,399
I mean, it's not like it slows them down.
They have wild, kinky sex.

209
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,195
- You say that about everybody.
- Like who else?

210
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:13,163
- Jesus, Jill.
- I really didn't tell them anything.

211
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,123
Never mind.

212
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,961
So what do Jamie and Jerome do
that's so wild and kinky?

213
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:22,130
Well, she would probably
tell you this herself...

214
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,133
What the hell's going on?

215
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,677
- Jamie.
- Jamie.

216
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,011
The front door's locked.

217
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,807
- I rang the doorbell forever.
- I'm sorry. We didn't hear you.

218
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,392
Wait, wait, wait.

219
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,435
Oh, my goodness.

220
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,062
- Honey.
- You are so skinny, I hate you.

221
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,940
- I can't eat when I'm nervous.
- Hi, bride.

222
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,194
How come you get three husbands
and I don't get any?

223
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,113
Well, you can have the last one.

224
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,656
For that matter, you can have this one.

225
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,158
- What's wrong?
- Jerry and I had a fight.

226
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,995
- You're under a lot of stress.
- Oh, no, no.

227
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,748
This was a real, real nasty one,
and I'm still mad. I never leave mad.

228
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,292
- What happened?
- Well, you know,

229
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,669
Jerry's having
his little bachelor party tonight.

230
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,255
You know, just a couple of
wacky systems analysts sitting around

231
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,133
playing pool in some billiard parlour
in Pasadena.

232
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:10,637
Well, this one guy who's with him,
Dave, he hired a stripper.

233
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,848
Now, Jerry didn't know about it
until tonight

234
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,392
but he doesn't understand
why I'm upset.

235
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,935
Well, it's not like
anything's going to happen.

236
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,979
Look, I worked for
one of those stripper companies

237
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,732
in my pathetic early twenties,
I know what goes on.

238
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,817
Yeah, but you said it wasn't his idea.

239
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,944
No, but he should tell them
that he doesn't want it

240
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,739
and make them cancel
if he had any balls.

241
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,242
I don't blame you. I'd be furious.

242
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,494
Besides, it's really tacky.

243
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:36,747
Yeah, I know. I mean, he should
respect my feelings. He should.

244
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,957
He should respect them
and if it bugs me that much,

245
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,375
then you know, it's not worth it.

246
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,752
Don't you trust him?

247
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:45,464
- I don't trust anybody I'm in love with.
- Oh, Jamie, please.

248
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,590
You don't actually think

249
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,092
that Jerry's going to have sex
with some bimbo at a pool hall?

250
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,302
He's not the type.

251
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,387
But he's going to fantasise about it.

252
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,516
I think it is really twisted that
three days before he marries me

253
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:58,727
he's off there staring at another woman,
thinking about screwing her.

254
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,563
- But that's not the point.
- No, it is the point. Aren't I enough?

255
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,941
You don't stop fantasising
once you get married. Believe me.

256
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,652
Well, I just want him
to fantasise about me.

257
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,282
Okay. You want me to call up some
big, greasy hunk

258
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,326
and have him come over here
and dance around in a Speedo?

259
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,538
No, no, no. I would hate that.
Men are so simplistic.

260
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,331
It takes a little more to excite me

261
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,708
than some naked moron
dancing around for money.

262
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,254
It doesn't take a stripper for him
to fantasise about somebody else.

263
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,757
The first thing that most men do
when they see an attractive woman

264
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,467
is imagine her naked.

265
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:35,055
I read in my psych class that a man
thinks about sex every 12 seconds.

266
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,140
How do they get anything done?

267
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,017
I wonder how many erections
do they have a day?

268
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,185
Hundreds.

269
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:44,398
What ever made me think that
I could be in another relationship?

270
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,860
I mean, I am obviously too neurotic.

271
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,152
I'm not gonna go through with it.

272
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,280
A lot of people
stop their weddings at the last minute.

273
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,615
- Jamie...
- No, I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

274
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,992
Fuck it!

275
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,250
Look, I'm sorry.

276
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,134
I'm cold.

277
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,637
- We're having pizza.
- I love your pizza.

278
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,764
Well, let's have pizza.

279
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,600
- I want some pizza.
- Pig out.

280
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,226
Isn't it beautiful today?

281
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,528
- Hamburger?
- No.

282
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,906
Jerry is crazy about you.

283
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,783
- Yeah.
- Just like Bob was crazy about me?

284
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,745
- Bob was an asshole.
- Bob was an asshole.

285
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,289
Thanks all of you for telling me that
before I married him.

286
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,916
Hey, I told you. You didn't listen.

287
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,418
- You hate everybody.
- I like Jerry.

288
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:50,130
- Got any ginger ale?
- You just told me that you'd be furious.

289
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:53,342
Well, yeah, but I mean, that doesn't
mean I don't think he's a good guy.

290
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,469
He's not like Bob or anything.

291
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,304
This smells like feet. Smell that.

292
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,764
Yeah, well, I picked Bob.

293
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,224
I picked Victor, for that matter.

294
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,768
- Hey, did you bring your dress?
- How can I trust myself?

295
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,770
- Did you bring your dress?
- Yeah, it's in the car.

296
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,730
- Somebody might steal it.
- Who cares?

297
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,233
- Is it white?
- No. It's bone.

298
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,235
I was just thinking how funny it would be

299
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,487
if we all just, you know,
wore the same bridesmaid's dresses

300
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,739
- from your last wedding.
- Oh, God.

301
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,367
I let my goddaughter
cut mine up for doll clothes.

302
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,620
- I burnt mine.
- Oh, come on. They weren't that bad.

303
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,081
Are you kidding? With those sashes?

304
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,667
We looked like we were on Hee Haw.

305
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,336
Oh, God, they were perfect for the time.
Come on.

306
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,880
They were really bad.
I was just looking at the pictures.

307
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,174
You have the...
Oh, my God. I threw mine out.

308
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,427
- Go get them.
- Get them. Come on, Georgina. Please.

309
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,846
- Please, please.
- Please, please.

310
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,889
Okay. Somebody make
another pitcher of margaritas.

311
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,016
I'll make the margaritas.

312
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,352
What?

313
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:48,021
Georg has a crush
on a guy she works with.

314
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,439
- What?
- What?

315
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,276
- She told me. He's her sous chef.
- What about Chris?

316
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,404
I don't know.
I'm just telling you what she told me.

317
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,073
Wow.

318
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,725
Hey.

319
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:30,230
- What you doing?
- Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you.

320
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,943
Hop in a minute.

321
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,529
No. Chris, I can't.
I can't. Everybody's here.

322
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:41,867
- So? It's more exciting that way.
- No. Really, I can't.

323
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,955
Excuse me for wanting a little affection.

324
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,333
Well, I think it's a little unrealistic of you

325
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,126
to expect me to
just jump into bed with you

326
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,504
when all my friends are here.

327
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,799
Are you mad at me or something?
I mean...

328
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,801
I'm just preoccupied, you know.

329
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,095
I'm trying to throw a bachelorette party

330
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,348
for somebody who just decided
not to get married.

331
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,557
Why?

332
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:09,019
She's mad at Jerry and, I don't know,
I think she's just scared.

333
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,896
She's such a drama queen, man.

334
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,941
You don't even know
the whole story, Chris.

335
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,652
You know, she's genuinely upset.

336
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:23,033
I wish you were as understanding
with me as you are with your friends.

337
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,579
I'm just trying to make everybody happy.

338
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,463
Will you come out and join us soon?

339
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,342
I don't really feel like being around
everybody right now.

340
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:43,011
I'm not feeling that great.

341
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,640
Well, get some rest.

342
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,361
Here it is.

343
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,323
Look at this.

344
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,993
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

345
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,996
- Look how fat I am.
- You look stunning in that dress.

346
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,081
Why did you make me wear pink?

347
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,958
I can't believe it.

348
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,419
- Look how small your boobs are.
- I know.

349
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,173
God, look at my ugly hair.
Look at my ugly husband.

350
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:20,340
He wasn't ugly.

351
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,009
- Yes, he was.
- Yes, he was.

352
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,636
God, he was an alcoholic leprechaun.

353
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,182
You know, my taste in men stinks.
My taste in dresses stinks.

354
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,392
I just have terrible judgement
about everything.

355
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,352
No, not anymore.

356
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:36,106
You wouldn't marry an abusive liar
like Victor now, would you?

357
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,733
She wouldn't
have married him in the first place

358
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,693
if she'd known he was already married
to someone else.

359
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,862
Come on, don't remind me.
The only reason I married him

360
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:44,198
is because he was
so completely different than Victor.

361
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,618
That's why I'm fucking Randy. I mean,
he's even more fucked up than Mark.

362
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:51,371
- I do everything ass backwards.
- What did she just say?

363
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,290
Something about
Mark fucking her in the ass.

364
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,000
I didn't know Mark had it in him.

365
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,253
- I didn't think Bob was that bad.
- Oh, God. He was withholding and cold.

366
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:00,422
I'd rather be screamed at than ignored.

367
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,466
Well, Jerry certainly doesn't ignore you.

368
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,302
Yeah. He worships you. It's sickening.

369
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,472
- Is that my car alarm?
- There goes your dress.

370
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,224
Jesus.

371
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,603
Wow, I guess she still wants her dress.

372
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,121
- Here it is.
- It's pretty.

373
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,706
- Nice.
- It's beautiful.

374
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,375
It's not bone, it's champagne.

375
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,503
- I hope I can return it. I had it altered.
- Try it on.

376
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,463
I mean,
since we're not gonna get to see it later.

377
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:43,048
- Yeah.
- Come on.

378
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,883
- Just try it on.
- Put it on.

379
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,635
Try it on.

380
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,470
Okay.

381
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,484
This is just her insecurity
getting the best of her.

382
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,613
I mean, after all, she's gotten
all her validation from her looks

383
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,199
and now she's getting older.

384
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:12,327
Maybe she's just
having second thoughts about him.

385
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,665
I remember waking up
and finding Don totally repulsive

386
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,041
right before we got married

387
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,794
and then I accused him
of not loving me.

388
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:23,297
- That's awful.
- It's normal.

389
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,757
What are you guys whispering about?

390
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:28,719
Just wondering
if you invited Bob to the wedding.

391
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,637
Very funny.

392
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:34,433
Did I tell you that I found out that
he did get married again?

393
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,852
That explains
that stupid annulment attempt.

394
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:37,978
What?

395
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,481
Yeah. I get this letter from his priest
asking me to sign something

396
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,817
that says that we were never married
in the eyes of God

397
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:46,028
because we didn't have
a Catholic wedding.

398
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:48,864
- What a hypocrite.
- What did you say?

399
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,282
Well, I said,

400
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:53,660
"As long as you're having
my marriage annulled,

401
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,371
"can I have my herpes annulled, too?"

402
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,584
- Bob gave you herpes?
- Yeah. Ironic, huh?

403
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,713
After all those sleaze bags
that I slept with in my twenties,

404
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:07,925
and then I get it from
my boring little ex-husband.

405
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,308
Oh, that's beautiful.

406
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,186
- You look beautiful.
- So beautiful.

407
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:21,522
Oh, wait! I forgot my shoes.

408
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,403
I am not accusing you of anything!
I asked you one simple question!

409
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,322
Well, I'm sick of
your goddamn questions!

410
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,574
I saw you talking to her! I saw you!

411
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:35,786
Georgina, your neighbours
are about to kill each other.

412
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,913
I would rather talk to her than you,
goddamn it.

413
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,706
- She's in her underwear.
- Fuck you!

414
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:42,751
- Oh, my God. She just slapped him.
- Good. He's a pig.

415
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:45,754
- How do you know?
- You can tell by looking at him.

416
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,298
- I'm sick of you! Stop it!
- Bitch!

417
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:51,552
I just wanna talk to you!
God, what is your problem?

418
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:55,097
- I said I'm sorry! Don't go! Please!
- Get away from me.

419
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,850
I wanna talk to you. Stay here.

420
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,893
- Get away!
- Let him go!

421
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:03,105
- No! No!
- Get off my goddamn car!

422
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,274
Stay here! I just wanna talk to you!

423
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,861
No! I love you!

424
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,445
- She's so desperate.
- She is crazy.

425
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,573
They do this all the time.

426
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,617
That's marriage for you.

427
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:18,412
- My marriage isn't like that.
- Are you happily married, Jill?

428
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,289
Tell me honestly, are you?

429
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,084
She's never happy.

430
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,712
It has nothing to do with her marriage.

431
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,630
Jamie, for God's sakes.

432
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,966
You don't understand. I've done that.

433
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,759
- When?
- With Bob.

434
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,344
What did you do?

435
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,974
Well, it was just the lowest point
in my whole life.

436
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,395
Bob had moved out, and there I was

437
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,397
holed up in our newly decorated house

438
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,859
which, by that time,
seemed like Amityville.

439
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:52,487
He called to say that he was coming by
to pick up some of his stuff.

440
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,781
I don't know what I was thinking but

441
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,869
I had it in my head I would seduce him

442
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,704
and he would want me back.

443
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,373
Bob.

444
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,713
- What are you doing here?
- I'm taking my pots.

445
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,215
What?

446
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,384
The pots are mine.
The plants are yours.

447
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,095
Bob, the plants are gonna die.

448
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:21,475
- Get some new pots.
- Have you lost your mind?

449
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,854
Bob, look at me.

450
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,024
What are you doing outside
in your underwear?

451
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,527
- Go inside.
- I can't believe this.

452
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,029
You don't even come in and say hello.

453
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,656
The neighbours can see you.

454
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:36,865
Bob.

455
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,744
Go inside. I'll be in in a minute.

456
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,751
Honey, don't be like this. Talk to me.

457
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,378
I've said everything.

458
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:52,714
Why are you running around like that?
Put some clothes on.

459
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,218
Give it to me.
You've broken the bloody flag!

460
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:59,638
Jesus. Jesus, Bob.
You said we were gonna be friends.

461
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,312
So, how's work?

462
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:11,191
Fine. They're doing a movie
of "Hogan's Heroes" and I got a call-back.

463
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:12,526
That's great.

464
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:14,736
Bob, honey.

465
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:20,742
- Jamie, stop it.
- I miss you.

466
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,955
I'm late.

467
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,543
I don't understand
how you can just suddenly hate me.

468
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:33,088
I don't hate you.
I don't feel anything for you at all.

469
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,382
Yes, you do!

470
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:54,735
- Haven't you any pride?
- Bob, Bob.

471
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:08,916
Bob?

472
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:19,051
- Hi.
- Who are you?

473
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,515
I'm Jeff from Greenpeace.

474
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:25,849
"You might have heard about us.

475
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,686
"We are the largest
environmental organisation in the world.

476
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:34,483
"We are famous for our work with
whales, seals and ocean pollution."

477
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,950
And I live up in the green house
at the top of the street.

478
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,203
- My mom's at a neighbourhood watch.
- Right.

479
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:51,375
"Did you know
that whales are still being hunted

480
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,210
"in certain unpatrolled waters

481
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,087
"and brutally slaughtered?"

482
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,718
It's okay though.

483
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,971
Ma'am, you...

484
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,181
Ma'am, contributions...

485
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:08,475
"Contributions of $25 or more

486
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,397
"from generous people like you help us

487
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,858

00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,236
"which are primarily used
to make cheap"...

489
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,696
These cheap key chains.

490
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,532
Stop, stop. Come on in.
I'll write you a cheque.

491
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,876
Let me get my purse.

492
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,303
Okay. I'm gonna find it.

493
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,684
Oh, I remember your mom now.
Jackie, right?

494
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,603
- Janet.
- Right.

495
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:57,441
Damn it, where is it?
This place is such a mess.

496
00:30:58,275 --> 00:30:59,651
Excuse me.

497
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,155
Here I am, wandering around like this.

498
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:08,702
Are you all right?
You seem a little bummed.

499
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,538
You could say that.

500
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:14,666
That's too bad.

501
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,047
You look really nice
in that thing, anyway.

502
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,760
Thank you.

503
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,768
There's my purse.

504
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:20,107
- Okay.
- Could you hand it to me?

505
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:24,945
Sure.

506
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:47,009
- Is "Greenpeace" one word?
- Yeah. Here.

507
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:03,275
Here.

508
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,280
Thanks. That's very generous of you.

509
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:15,412
Look, do you want to
get something to eat or something...

510
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:19,291
That's very sweet of you,

511
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,921
but you better get back to your work.

512
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:27,257
Yeah.

513
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:34,765
Look, have a nice evening.

514
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:39,061
- Thanks. Say hello to your mom.
- Okay.

515
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:50,989
Wow.

516
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:53,700
You actually said that,
"Say hi to your mom"?

517
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,285
Can you believe it?

518
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:59,331
Get off my goddamn car, Kim!

519
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,127
- I love you!
- Kim, get in the house!

520
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:06,463
- Oh, my God!
- What?

521
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:07,965
The pizzas!

522
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:11,134
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

523
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,554
Oh, no!

524
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,055
Put it out.

525
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:20,143
Oh, no. What a waste.

526
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:21,353
They're horrible.

527
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,646
So what? We'll get takeout.

528
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,523
No, but these would've been
so much better.

529
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:25,983
You better change out of that dress.

530
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,694
- Was the sex good?
- Yeah. Untie me.

531
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,737
You know,
it was like when you're starving

532
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:34,408
and you want a big, greasy hamburger,
but, you know, later you feel sick.

533
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:36,451
That's so hot to
have a young, beautiful boy

534
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:38,871
totally dependent on you
to tell him what to do.

535
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:43,167
- This guy knew what to do, believe me.
- I'd like a young boy on my pizza.

536
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,753
- But will a young boy like you?
- Hey, I'm not dead yet.

537
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:53,802
You know, I remember freaking out
right before I married Don

538
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,597
because I would never
be able to have sex with anybody else

539
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,683
for the rest of my life,
let alone kiss anybody.

540
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:03,061
- Do you think that's what's scaring you?
- No, I've kissed enough people.

541
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:07,399
Besides, I don't feel restricted with
Jerry. I mean, he's very experimental.

542
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,320
You ready
to give somebody like that up?

543
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:15,199
He's probably off experimenting
with some sleazy stripper right now.

544
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,951
So how much you think
that jukebox takes in?

545
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,204
- Per night or per month?
- Whatever.

546
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:24,500
Well, you figure four songs for a dollar,
song's three, four minutes long.

547
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,170
- It's active six hours a night.
- It's about 100 songs an evening.

548
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:30,255
Is that a Wednesday night
or a Saturday night?

549
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:31,965
We're talking aggregate.
We're talking a whole week.

550
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:34,593
- Nobody said aggregate.
- We're speaking aggregate.

551
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,763
Check it out.

552
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:40,682
$132.50 a week.

553
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,436
You know who was really kinky

554
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,146
- was Jay.
- Jay?

555
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,232
He was the first person
who ever spanked me.

556
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,275
Oh, Jesus.
Do we really have to hear this?

557
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:51,902
It was so much fun.

558
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,320
The big jerk. I still hate him.

559
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,863
Why don't you call him
and hang up on him?

560
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,533
I can't.
I drove him to an unlisted number.

561
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:01,745
Are you serious?
Jill, that is so immature.

562
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:03,705
What did he do to you?

563
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:06,375
For one thing, he tried to have
a three-way with me and Jamie.

564
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:09,086
When we said no, he broke up with me
and tried to go out with Jamie.

565
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,921
- True.
- I didn't know that.

566
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:14,508
What made Jay think you guys
would have a three-way with him?

567
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,469
You two are so coy.

568
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,388
What?

569
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,473
- Nothing.
- What?

570
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:24,768
No, it was just something that happened
once when we were both at UCLA.

571
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:26,061
- It was stupid.
- Stupid.

572
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:28,272
- I've heard this story.
- How come I didn't hear it?

573
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:31,733
You were at Mount Holypoke,
or whatever that hoity-toity school was.

574
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:35,070
Hey, didn't you have
any nubile lesbian experiences there?

575
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:38,448
Shut up! Yeah, sure. You know I didn't.
Stop changing the subject.

576
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:40,409
What happened when you guys
were at UCLA?

577
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:42,995
- It's too personal.
- Now, that's a first.

578
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:45,122
- Come on, tell!
- No, it was stupid.

579
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,040
- I'll tell.
- You slut.

580
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,835
We were living in that building in Palms.

581
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:52,629
And Jamie was dating
this guy from USC...

582
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,715
Well, she wasn't dating him.
She was exploiting him.

583
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,967
Come on, he was cute,
but nobody you'd ever fall in love with.

584
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,845
So, it didn't matter. It was the '70s.
There was no AIDS.

585
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:03,557
Everybody was fucking each other
and wearing too much lip gloss.

586
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:07,019
He looked kind of like
a Jewish Jim Morrison.

587
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,597
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

588
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:52,105
Shit.

589
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:11,416
I can't believe
you guys had a three-way.

590
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,419
Was it great?

591
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:17,256
No, it was stupid.
We knew each other too well.

592
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,216
It was kind of incestuous.

593
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:21,635
What ever happened to him?

594
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:24,596
He's an agent with
the William Morris Agency.

595
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,684
Rachel, can I borrow your comb?

596
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:31,186
God, I remember, we had to go to
Frederick's of Hollywood

597
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,396
to get those garter belts.

598
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:35,274
You couldn't even get, like, sexy lingerie
in department stores then.

599
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:38,235
- Who even wears garter belts anymore?
- I do.

600
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:39,611
You slut.

601
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:42,698
You know what I hate
is that cheesy lingerie catalogue.

602
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,449
I know.
They're all air-brushed and perfect.

603
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:46,243
- No one looks like that.
- I do.

604
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:49,830
Those perfect little models with those
teddies on that nobody ever wears.

605
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,457
There's never a drop of discharge
on them.

606
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,377
It makes me feel so inadequate.

607
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,422
Do you remember when we talked Mom
into buying that first black bra?

608
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,924
Oh, God, she thought it was so racy.

609
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:04,261
That was the time
we went shopping for your first bra.

610
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,930
- I was so jealous of you.
- I developed first.

611
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,641
- You're older.
- Not by much.

612
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:14,021
What?

613
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,315
- We tried...
- What?

614
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,317
Come on, spit it out.

615
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,611
We finally convinced her
to try a tampon.

616
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:23,238
And she didn't know that she was
supposed to take the applicator out.

617
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:25,449
So she left it in. And she came out
and she sat on the couch,

618
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:27,910
and then she shot six feet in the air.

619
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:36,168
- Jill, Jill.
- What is that?

620
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:41,006
It's the sound my mother makes
when she comes.

621
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:46,303
- You heard her?
- She heard her mother?

622
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:55,938
Oh, my God, what if it's Randy?

623
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:58,649
- Oh, Marcy, for God's sake.
- Relax.

624
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,567
Don't open the door.

625
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:02,986
Sorry.

626
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,155
It's the pizza.

627
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:08,116
- Good, I'm starving.
- I'm stuffed.

628
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,993
Let me get you some money.

629
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,289
- Hi.
- Hi.

630
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:17,960
Oh, my God. Don't let Jamie near him.

631
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:21,129
- Is this a joke? Are you a stripper?
- Pardon?

632
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,423
Don't listen to her. Here.

633
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,260
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

634
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:30,097
- Guys having a party?
- No, Jamie's getting married.

635
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,682
- No, I'm not.
- Third time.

636
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:32,808
Thanks, Jill.

637
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:37,604
Wait a minute. I know you.
You were in Cadet Academy.

638
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:43,235
- Am I right? That was you, right?
- Yeah, I'm afraid it was. Yeah.

639
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,237
Shut up.

640
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,157
You looked so cute in that uniform.
You were my favourite cadet.

641
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,616
Gee, thanks.

642
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:54,163
Well, hey, congratulations.

643
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:57,916
- Thanks.
- See you.

644
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,418
Bye.

645
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:05,382
- Oh, my God! He was cute.
- Yeah, like a Michelangelo.

646
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,675
I need to pee.

647
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,222
You see?
I bet you had a fantasy going about him.

648
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:13,473
No, I didn't.

649
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:16,727
I can admire somebody's looks
without having to see them naked.

650
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,188
- I'd like to see him naked.
- What?

651
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,817
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Club soda and salt. Quick!

652
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:28,947
Hey.

653
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,158
Calm down, it's just me.

654
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,910
I'm sorry. I came out the wrong door.

655
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:36,705
- I'm sorry. I forgot you were in here.
- Nice dress.

656
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,749
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

657
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:42,628
- It's from Loehmann's.
- Loehmann's?

658
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:45,797
Oh, God. My mom used to
take me there when I was little.

659
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:48,008
She still thinks
those open changing rooms

660
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:49,843
are the cause of me being a lesbian.

661
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,721
Are you serious?

662
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:54,431
No.

663
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:00,437
I better get back.

664
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,106
Yeah, right. Okay.

665
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,077
Don't worry. We got it out.

666
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,790
We really did. See, it'll never show.

667
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,917
Besides, it's right where
you hold your flowers.

668
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,877
I mean, you know, if...

669
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,839
It's just another sign.

670
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,260
- Jamie, don't be ridiculous.
- What are you doing?

671
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:33,428
- I don't eat cheese.
- Since when?

672
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:36,265
After I broke up with Mark.
Got a colonic.

673
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:39,935
Mark used to tell me I have these
saddle bags and a Christmas package.

674
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,854
Now what is a Christmas package?

675
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:44,481
That bulge that starts at your pubic hair.

676
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:46,275
Mark used to call it
my Christmas package.

677
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:48,193
What a jerk. You have a great body.

678
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:51,113
Thank you. It doesn't matter.
Now if anybody tells me I'm fat,

679
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,823
I just feel like killing myself.

680
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:54,741
I know what you mean.

681
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:56,785
I can't even masturbate when I feel fat.

682
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:58,328
Everything with you
always comes back to sex.

683
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,330
You know when I hate myself,
I still masturbate

684
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:01,999
but I have really masochistic fantasies.

685
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:05,085
You see? You think you're gonna stop
doing that just 'cause you get married?

686
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:08,255
No, but they're abstract.
They're not about anybody in particular.

687
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:10,174
I went out with
this really smug French guy once

688
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:11,884
who thought
he knew everything about women.

689
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,218
I gotta pee now.

690
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:15,721
And he insisted that
all women have one fantasy.

691
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:21,226
A man comes home, he brings roses
and champagne to his woman,

692
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,769
then he tells her that he loves her...

693
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:25,606
- Are you sure he wasn't Italian?
- He was European.

694
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:27,733
He tells her that he loves her

695
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,652
and she's the most beautiful thing
in the world.

696
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,322
- And that's it.
- Sounds good to me.

697
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:37,409
I hate roses.
My fantasies are so much more explicit.

698
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:39,286
I mean, I disgust myself sometimes.

699
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:45,417
Did you guys read that Nancy Friday
book My Secret Garden of Fantasies?

700
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:46,960
I read that.

701
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:51,507
It's broken into all kinds of categories,
you know, sadomasochism and incest.

702
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,009
There's even an animal category.

703
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:57,179
You know, Victor tried to hump
his cocker spaniel, Lucky,

704
00:43:57,262 --> 00:44:00,641
- when he was little.
- No! Did he really?

705
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,184
- That's disgusting.
- Yuck!

706
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,394
- What?
- Tina farted!

707
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:09,775
You know, I remember
that Nancy Friday book.

708
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:12,653
There was this nun fantasy in it
that was really perverse.

709
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:16,406
Please don't say anything about a nun.
There's nothing sexy about a nun.

710
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,077
Come on. I'd like to look up
some nun's habit and pleasure her.

711
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,622
I did a nun once. An ex-nun.

712
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:26,917
And she lost her virginity
to her mother superior.

713
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:30,295
Some of my fantasies are so weird.

714
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:33,173
- I wonder where they come from.
- Twisted childhoods.

715
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:35,509
You didn't have a twisted childhood.

716
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:38,929
I always feel guilty
after my masochistic fantasies.

717
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,432
I don't know. What do you do
when you're politically correct

718
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:44,601
but your masturbation fantasies aren't?

719
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,604
- I just hate any kind of pain.
- It's not about pain.

720
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,106
I'm sorry.

721
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,608
- I didn't know you were still in here.
- It's all yours.

722
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:54,570
I got something on my shirt.
I gotta go change.

723
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:24,636
- I knew it! You are smoking again.
- Mind your own business!

724
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,305
- This is my first one in six months.
- Oh, God.

725
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:29,016
I've had a very long stressful day
and it's not easy being around you.

726
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,350
Your breath stinks.
Oh, what? What did I do?

727
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:31,727
Just because
I don't want to take care of you

728
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,896
when you're riddled with emphysema...

729
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:37,065
- Guys, you're gonna wake up Chris.
- I'm awake.

730
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:38,317
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

731
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,194
Sorry, honey.

732
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:44,907
- Why didn't you lock the door?
- Jill, stop screaming.

733
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,909
I didn't know you would come
barging in without knocking.

734
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:49,369
Do you remember
how Desi used to spank Lucy?

735
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:50,537
Yeah!

736
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:52,915
I thought that I would grow up to
have a husband who spanked me.

737
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:55,876
Oh! Do you know
what used to get to me was Catwoman.

738
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:58,587
Remember... Remember she used to tie
people up?

739
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,380
I told my parents
that when I watched that,

740
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:01,882
it made me feel all funny inside.

741
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:03,842
They made me stop watching it.

742
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:06,261
Rachel and I have these cousins,
twin boys.

743
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:08,764
And whenever they came over,
we used to play this secret game

744
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:09,973
where they tied me up.

745
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:12,100
I loved it! "Let me go, let me go!"

746
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:14,937
Michael and Mitchell used to tie you up?
Where was I?

747
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,357
I don't know. You were amusing the
adults with an impromptu piano recital.

748
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,567
I didn't even masturbate
until after I had sex.

749
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:23,028
Are you kidding?
I started when I was four.

750
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:24,196
- Four?
- Four?

751
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:26,824
My babysitter caught me
humping my Mother Goose book.

752
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:31,286
I've never found a dick
as hard as that book.

753
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:35,123
Hey, I never masturbated until I read
that book, Our Bodies, Ourselves.

754
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:36,792
- Oh, I read that.
- I read that.

755
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,211
I had to get out a mirror
and find my clitoris and everything!

756
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:40,754
Did you really do that?

757
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,130
I couldn't find it.

758
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:45,133
- Is it clitoris or is it clitoris?
- Clitoris.

759
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:46,552
Wanna know something else?

760
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:49,346
I don't think I've ever had an orgasm
during sex.

761
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:50,597
- Really?
- What!

762
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,474
I don't think so.

763
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:55,769
You know, I bet those systems analysts
are talking about sex right now.

764
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:59,565
What's the least amount of money
you would stick your hand in a toilet for?

765
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:03,193
That depends! We talking about
my toilet or somebody else's toilet?

766
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:05,279
Yeah, and is it clean
or does it have turds floating in it?

767
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:08,782
We're talking about a clean public toilet.
Would you go after a quarter?

768
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:11,618
- No, I wouldn't go after a quarter.
- Would you go after $5?

769
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:13,162
- No.
- I'd go after $5.

770
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:14,705
- How about $10?
- No.

771
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:16,665
How about $20?

772
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:17,875
Yes.

773
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,627
I don't really like vibrators.
They make me feel awkward.

774
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:22,296
Yeah, I've never owned a vibrator.

775
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:24,339
Did you know that Mom sent me one
when I was at UCLA

776
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:25,465
and Tom dumped me?

777
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,551
Mother sent you a vibrator?

778
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:30,345
She wanted me to be satisfied
but not sleep around.

779
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:33,265
My gosh! My mom
would never send me a vibrator.

780
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:34,933
Oh, she'd just gotten divorced.

781
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:37,311
She was going through her...

782
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:40,189
She never sent me a vibrator.

783
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,232
I believe you were too busy
comforting Daddy

784
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:43,901
and not speaking to her at the time.

785
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,694
Well, somebody had to.
He was devastated.

786
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:47,321
Oh, thank God
his favourite daughter was around.

787
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:49,031
Oh, let's please not start that.

788
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:50,324
You know what?

789
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:52,493
I used to have this little pillow
when I was little

790
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:53,827
with a little happy face on it

791
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:57,080
and I used to make out with it
and pretend it was David Cassidy.

792
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:59,583
- You were obsessed with him!
- We all were.

793
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:03,629
You know, I had the most erotic dream
about him once.

794
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:05,589
I did. I know it doesn't sound like much,

795
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:09,468
but it's probably
the sexiest dream I ever had.

796
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:11,595
So? Come on.

797
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:13,222
Well...

798
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:18,435
He's at the top
of this really long flight of stairs.

799
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:21,563
And I felt like I had to climb forever.

800
00:50:22,064 --> 00:50:27,069
And then when I got there,
he was wearing these leather pants

801
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,612
and his

802
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,572
thing was out.

803
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,536
It was really big.

804
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:39,414
How big was it?

805
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,086
What?

806
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:46,964
What?

807
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:50,509
It's hard to explain
but it was really erotic.

808
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:54,888
I had this dream that I had sex
with Andy Rooney in a bathtub!

809
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:57,266
- Oh!
- Disgusting.

810
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:59,560
You know what I loved
about David Cassidy?

811
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:01,603
He had no visible body hair.

812
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:03,147
You know,
I remember thinking when I was little

813
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,567
that I'd never like one of those
big furry grown-ups like my father.

814
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,236
- Like your husband, you mean.
- I was just about to say that.

815
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,779
Hey! Shut up!

816
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:13,699
- At least he's not bald.
- Hey, come on, Jerry's not bald.

817
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:16,577
- His hairline's very distinctive.
- Oh, God, she's defending him.

818
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,245
He's not bald!

819
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,873
All right, wait,
I was gonna say something.

820
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:24,126
Oh, yes. Please say something.
You've been so quiet all evening.

821
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,794
God.

822
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,213
You know, there are some hairy men
that I find attractive.

823
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,965
How about Sonny in The Godfather?

824
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:32,217
Oh, yes, up against the door, page 27.

825
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:33,969
- 26.
- No, 27.

826
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:37,347
I used to read it on the phone
to Brad Fertini in junior high school.

827
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,017
- Oh, I remember him!
- He made me, over and over again.

828
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,144
He had bad skin, right?

829
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,773
You know, there's something
about those gangsters

830
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:48,317
that was such a turn-on.

831
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,360
That was
my biggest masturbation fantasy

832
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:52,279
when I was in high school.

833
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:03,582
I picture that den in The Godfather
with all those men in it.

834
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,961
I've cheated on the Don's son
and the family finds out.

835
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,672
So they bring me into the room

836
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:14,718
and the Don decides
I must be punished.

837
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:24,037
Sometimes he rubs an ice cube
on my butt because it's so sore.

838
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:27,166
Gee, thanks for sharing.

839
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:31,044
I can't believe
you just told that to everybody.

840
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:34,047
What do you mean everybody?

841
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:36,258
Jeez, I've known you guys
practically my whole life.

842
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:39,094
I can't share one little sex fantasy?

843
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:42,431
You know, that is why
we are so messed up.

844
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:44,474
Because we're too ashamed
to reveal ourselves.

845
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:48,270
That's why my fantasy is about
being punished, because I'm ashamed.

846
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:49,897
Don't you get it?

847
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:51,982
I mean, we're women,
so we're supposed to be pure.

848
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:53,484
- We're not supposed to have fantasies.
- Calm down.

849
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:54,735
Calm down. Calm down!

850
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:56,028
We're supposed to be
up on this pedestal.

851
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:58,822
Calm down. I'm glad that you told it.

852
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:03,160
Yes, it's very reassuring to know
that there's someone else

853
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:05,579
who is a little bit
more of a pervert than I am.

854
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:07,247
I am not a pervert!

855
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:10,959
Okay, okay, okay. I'm kidding.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right?

856
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:13,045
- Men like to be spanked, too.
- That's right.

857
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:16,298
I mean, it's that whole dominatrix thing.
It's very, very common.

858
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:17,508
Maybe in England.

859
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:21,053
But I don't like being the spanker.
I only like to be the spankee.

860
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:23,639
- I like getting a spanking.
- Why?

861
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:26,016
It's fun. Me and Jamie do it all the time.

862
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,894
I don't want to get spanked. It hurts.

863
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:32,314
- Your parents spank you?
- Yeah, my dad does.

864
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:36,902
- You wanna see something?
- Okay.

865
00:54:40,823 --> 00:54:42,491
Where'd you get this?

866
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:44,910
It was in your dad's bedroom,
in the cupboard.

867
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:47,830
Jill, put it back.
We're gonna get in trouble.

868
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:51,124
- Why?
- 'Cause those magazines are for men.

869
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,043
So?

870
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:01,093
- Look at her boobies.
- They're gross.

871
00:55:01,677 --> 00:55:03,762
Men like them like that.

872
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:25,325
Where did you get this magazine?

873
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:27,828
- It was in your husband's bathroom.
- What?

874
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:31,248
- I was looking for toilet...
- Jill, you go home.

875
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:32,457
Git!

876
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:37,045
And you, young lady, can stay in
your room until your father gets home.

877
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:38,672
God!

878
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:44,261
Bend over and pull down your pants.

879
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,931
Do you think people
have spanking fantasies

880
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:50,601
in countries
that don't use corporal punishment?

881
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:52,936
I have a domination fantasy.

882
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:55,355
Do tell.

883
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:58,358
I make my cretin supervisor
clean the bathroom.

884
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:03,906
Rachel, that's an intellectual fantasy,
not a sexual one.

885
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:06,408
Well...

886
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,121
I guess.

887
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:14,291
My therapist says that
acting out some fantasies

888
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:16,376
with a partner you trust
is actually quite healthy.

889
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,129
- As long as nobody gets hurt.
- Right.

890
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:22,007
You know,
Randy likes playing those games.

891
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:23,967
Really? What does he do, paint you?

892
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:27,721
No. No, he's an actor,

893
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:31,350
so he likes to get into character
and pretend we're different people.

894
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:34,436
One time, he played doctor,

895
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,564
and he shaved off all my pubic hair.

896
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,983
It was really erotic at the time,

897
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:42,653
but now it's growing back in
and it's really itchy.

898
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:46,698
I let this guy do it to me once and
I forgot and I went to get a Pap smear.

899
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,909
It was so embarrassing!

900
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:51,286
I didn't know anything embarrassed you.

901
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:54,122
- I had a crush on my gynaecologist.
- Oh, that's gross.

902
00:56:54,206 --> 00:56:58,544
Can we please talk about something
other than sex for five minutes?

903
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:04,883
Okay, fine. Let's talk about sex.

904
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:07,052
What is wrong with talking about sex?

905
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:09,805
- Don't you think about sex?
- Of course, I do.

906
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:11,723
So, what turns you on?

907
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,976
Right. You'll just make fun of me.

908
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,811
No, I really wanna know. I won't.

909
00:57:15,894 --> 00:57:17,813
Well, I don't have anything
that compares to yours.

910
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:21,233
- Oh, come on. Rachel, spill it.
- Rachel, come on.

911
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:24,069
All right.

912
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:26,113
Don't laugh.

913
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:30,534
But it has to do with shopping.

914
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,121
I admit I'm a bit of a materialist!

915
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:39,877
Anyway, this man takes me
to a really expensive store,

916
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,463
and he picks clothes out for me.

917
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:49,511
He is completely in control.

918
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:51,805
And he decides everything,

919
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:54,892
right down to the Christian Dior teddy.

920
00:57:56,977 --> 00:57:59,354
And then he

921
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:04,276
makes me model everything.

922
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:13,702
That's it?

923
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:16,663
That...

924
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:19,416
You masturbate to that?

925
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,709
I didn't say that.

926
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:23,337
I'm just trying to figure out
at what point do you come?

927
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,547
When the clerk says,

928
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:29,051
"That'll be $2,750"?

929
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:35,849
Will you stop making...
See, I can't tell anything in front of Jill.

930
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:40,979
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to figure out
how we turned out so different.

931
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:43,440
No, really. Seriously, Rachel, I mean.

932
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:46,026
Do you really think
that's a masturbation fantasy?

933
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,736
I never said that.

934
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,030
What, you don't masturbate?

935
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:53,200
Well, as a matter of fact, I don't.

936
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:54,785
- Really?
- Never?

937
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:56,578
What's the big deal?
I just never wanted to.

938
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:59,957
I just don't like touching myself there.

939
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,167
How can we be sisters?

940
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,545
You know,
my mother doesn't masturbate.

941
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:07,005
- How do you know?
- We tell each other everything.

942
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:10,717
I mean, she has no sex life,
not since my parents got divorced.

943
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:13,762
- And she doesn't masturbate.
- That's a generational thing.

944
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:17,266
- I think that's sad.
- I think a lot of women are like that.

945
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:19,685
You know,
my mother never talks about sex.

946
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:23,272
But she did tell me once that
she thinks that oral sex is disgusting.

947
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:27,651
- Oh, I had my first orgasm with oral sex.
- Me, too, after the prom.

948
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:30,070
You know, I think I was allergic
to Mark's sperm.

949
00:59:30,154 --> 00:59:32,239
When it got on my face,
it gave me a rash.

950
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:35,075
I kind of enjoyed giving head to men.

951
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:37,995
- So which is better?
- Men or women?

952
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,793
I don't know. They're very different.

953
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:48,005
I really enjoyed having sex with men,
but I...

954
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:51,592
I would have to say
that I prefer sex with women. It's...

955
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:54,094
Women are great. I think
they're great in every way, you know.

956
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:58,307
Sexually and emotionally
I feel more of a bond with women. I do.

957
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:02,019
I mean, sex is sex,

958
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:05,814
but I guess when it's all over
I would rather hang out with a woman.

959
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:10,444
You know, I think I like hanging out
with you guys

960
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:13,030
better than any guy I've ever dated.

961
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:14,281
Yeah.

962
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:23,957
- I need some sugar.
- I should check my machine.

963
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,042
More chocolate.

964
01:00:27,252 --> 01:00:29,713
- Oh, my God, Randy called.
- So?

965
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:33,509
- He's furious.
- Well, don't let him intimidate you.

966
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:37,346
Could you grab the napkins
and the ice cream, please?

967
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,098
- I'll just get this out of the way.
- That is so beautiful.

968
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:42,726
- Did Chris make that?
- Yep.

969
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:44,770
She is so talented.

970
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,607
Jerome loves carrot cake.

971
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:51,151
Oh, screw him.

972
01:00:51,235 --> 01:00:53,695
You're not really
gonna cancel your wedding, are you?

973
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:55,239
Ice cream's melting.

974
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:58,826
Jesus, Marcy.

975
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:02,162
He said on my machine
he was gonna call me here.

976
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:04,748
- It's not Randy.
- That's creepy.

977
01:01:04,832 --> 01:01:07,251
Maybe we should call the police.

978
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:08,627
Hello?

979
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,964
- No, Randy, she's not here.
- Oh, my gosh.

980
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,801
Well, I don't care
if you did see her car in the driveway.

981
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:17,553
Look, if you show your face
on my property,

982
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:22,015
I'll have you arrested so fast
that your head will spin. Now, goodbye.

983
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:24,726
- Slumber party massacre.
- What're we gonna do?

984
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,104
No, nothing. He's all bark, honey.

985
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,982
You don't understand. He... He... He...

986
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:32,734
- What?
- He threatened to blackmail me.

987
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:34,444
- About what?
- What?

988
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:36,738
You guys, I did something so stupid.

989
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:39,616
- What? What is it?
- Marcy, what?

990
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:43,036
I can't tell you. It's too embarrassing.

991
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,914
- Come on, you gotta be kidding.
- Marcy.

992
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:49,293
It was so stupid. It was just so stupid.

993
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,420
What?

994
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,381
I let him take pictures of me.

995
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:56,925
Really explicit pictures.

996
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:59,720
- Oh, Marcy.
- That was not a good idea.

997
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,638
Oh, thanks, Mom.

998
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:05,142
He threatened to mail them
to my parents!

999
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:08,228
I am the stupidest person
that ever lived.

1000
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:10,481
How could I have ever liked him?
What's wrong with me?

1001
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:14,234
My parents would have a heart attack
if they even knew I was seeing him.

1002
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,403
How could you go
from a nice, normal attorney

1003
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:17,738
to a psychotic house painter?

1004
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:21,492
- Oh, Mark was a scumbag.
- Oh, God, I know.

1005
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:24,578
I can't believe I wasted six years on him.

1006
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:26,622
What did poor Mark do?

1007
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:29,583
Oh, it's so unsavoury.

1008
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:34,129
You know, after all those years

1009
01:02:34,213 --> 01:02:38,967
of refusing to really commit to our
relationship but still stringing me along,

1010
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:43,347
I found out something really awful
about him.

1011
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:44,973
- What?
- What?

1012
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,687
Oh, he was getting hand jobs
at a massage parlour in Van Nuys.

1013
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:52,481
Are you serious?

1014
01:02:52,898 --> 01:02:56,693
Yeah, he said it helped him relax
after his racquetball games.

1015
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:59,363
That's awful. How did you find out?

1016
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:01,281
When I was doing his taxes.

1017
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:03,659
He saved the receipts
to write off as a business expense.

1018
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:05,494
What a scum!

1019
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:08,080
That's not deductible.

1020
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:11,375
- I never liked him.
- My parents were in love with him.

1021
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:13,460
Oh, forget about your parents
for God's sakes.

1022
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:17,631
You know, that is your problem.
You've been a good girl your whole life.

1023
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,967
I guess that's true.

1024
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:30,310
When I was a little girl,
we'd go on road trips.

1025
01:03:30,394 --> 01:03:34,314
My mother used to always tell me
never to use a rest stop alone,

1026
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:38,026
'cause there might be a rapist in there
waiting for me.

1027
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:52,541
It's so weird but something about
the idea of my very own rapist

1028
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:54,710
used to really excite me.

1029
01:03:55,961 --> 01:04:00,674
Sometimes I'd imagine myself,
all grown up and travelling alone.

1030
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:05,637
And I had to pee so bad
I just couldn't help it.

1031
01:04:21,487 --> 01:04:24,114
I've been waiting for you, darling.

1032
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:26,700
Isn't that awful?

1033
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:30,037
I didn't even know what a rapist was.

1034
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,500
He just kissed me and then asked
if he could watch me pee.

1035
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:39,421
Did you know that on my soap,
the rapist got the most fan mail

1036
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:41,131
from women?

1037
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:45,886
Well, look at Luke on General Hospital.
Laura married him after he raped her.

1038
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:48,013
Yeah, and then
he became the biggest deal.

1039
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:49,139
That's weird.

1040
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:51,266
You know what really bugs me
is in the movies,

1041
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:55,062
you always see little boys jerking off
to dirty postcards and everything,

1042
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:58,524
but you never see
any little girls have any sexuality at all.

1043
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:02,736
- That would scare people.
- It's just like that whole stripper thing.

1044
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,615
I mean, I really thought
that Jerry was evolved,

1045
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:09,451
but he is out there, as we speak,

1046
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:12,621
oogling some unemployed actress
in a dirty thong.

1047
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:15,666
- Ogling.
- How did we get back on this subject?

1048
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:19,461
You guys, should I call over there
and see if she's been there yet?

1049
01:05:19,545 --> 01:05:20,879
- Yes.
- No.

1050
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:22,548
I'm going to.

1051
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:29,513
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

1052
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,223
- The bridesmaid's dress.
- That is hideous.

1053
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:32,891
How did we ever go out in public
in that?

1054
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:35,769
- Where did you find it?
- Mothball section.

1055
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:53,370
You guys been talking about sex
all evening?

1056
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:58,792
I kept hearing
little snatches of your conversation.

1057
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:00,919
No pun intended.

1058
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:04,423
It was giving me the wildest dreams.

1059
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:06,550
Oh, hello.

1060
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:10,345
I sent one of my girls over this evening
to do a strip for a few gentlemen.

1061
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:13,098
I just wanted to know
if she arrived there okay.

1062
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:15,767
I think I see her.

1063
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,436
Cute.

1064
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:22,900
Chris, your cake is fabulous.
I can't stop eating it.

1065
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:26,195
Well, that's it.
The wedding's off, and I mean it.

1066
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:28,155
What was that?

1067
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,622
Oh, my God, it's Randy's El Camino.
He's here.

1068
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:38,707
He's here.

1069
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,460
- I said he's here! What're we gonna do?
- Call the police.

1070
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:42,628
Who is it?

1071
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:44,505
That bozo
who wanted to paint the house.

1072
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,173
He wants to paint the house
at this hour?

1073
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:47,633
No, he's been stalking Marcy.

1074
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:51,261
- Whoever he is, he's in the backyard.
- That little fucker! I'm gonna get him.

1075
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:53,347
- Oh, my God.
- Chris, no!

1076
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:55,015
I got pepper spray!

1077
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:58,560
You're dead!

1078
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:02,356
Chris, oh, my God, that's the pool man.

1079
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:04,358
- Jesus!
- Are you okay?

1080
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:05,484
That's not Randy.

1081
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:08,821
Here, why don't you
have some carrot cake?

1082
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:11,323
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1083
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,700
- Here, Chris baked it.
- This is my favourite.

1084
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:15,828
- It's delicious.
- I'm sorry.

1085
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:18,747
- We thought you were someone else.
- Who, the bogeyman?

1086
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:22,501
- No, a friend of Marcy's.
- He's not really a friend of mine.

1087
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:25,587
- He's actually my house painter.
- Oh, you naughty girl.

1088
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:29,007
You wanna see a picture of him?
I just happen to have one handy.

1089
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:31,426
So, now he's basically stalking me.

1090
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:34,805
He's cute.

1091
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:36,974
- Who is it?
- Oh, God, he's here.

1092
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:38,725
Jesus, I'll get it.

1093
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:41,270
I'd better handle this. She'll kill him.

1094
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:46,150
May I help you?

1095
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:49,361
- Who the hell are you?
- Mr French.

1096
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:50,487
Where's Marcy?

1097
01:07:50,571 --> 01:07:53,115
She's taking a long hot soak in the tub,

1098
01:07:53,198 --> 01:07:55,993
and she's not receiving
any gentleman callers.

1099
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:57,870
What are you, some kind of a fag?

1100
01:07:58,245 --> 01:08:00,914
Tell Marcy
to get her butt out here right now.

1101
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:03,083
Listen, you little soap opera reject,

1102
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:05,836
if you come near that woman again

1103
01:08:05,919 --> 01:08:09,006
I'm gonna smash your
pretty little face in. Do you understand?

1104
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:11,508
Right, just let me go, all right?

1105
01:08:11,758 --> 01:08:12,968
Slut.

1106
01:08:18,015 --> 01:08:20,058
And I really loved her.

1107
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:23,479
Marcy!

1108
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:26,023
Hey, Marcy!

1109
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:29,234
Oh, God, he's a method actor.

1110
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:31,028
Marcy!

1111
01:08:31,653 --> 01:08:33,405
- Marcy!
- Don't!

1112
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:35,157
He is cute.

1113
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:37,201
Randy.

1114
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:43,332
What's your problem?
You won't even take my calls. Why?

1115
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,792
What, all of a sudden
I have cooties now?

1116
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:49,129
No. No. No. It's just that I...

1117
01:08:49,213 --> 01:08:53,008
I told you once already how I feel
and it's kind of hard for me to...

1118
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:54,760
Blow people off?

1119
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:57,721
Look, Randy, I don't know
why you're so upset.

1120
01:08:57,805 --> 01:09:01,892
I didn't sense that much of
an emotional involvement from you.

1121
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:03,268
Really?

1122
01:09:03,811 --> 01:09:06,438
Well, you haven't been paying
much attention then, have you?

1123
01:09:06,522 --> 01:09:10,275
So, what, ultimately, I'm just
not good enough for you, is that it?

1124
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:14,363
You know what? You don't really want to
be involved with me. I'm really a mess.

1125
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:16,532
Christ, I hate that old line.

1126
01:09:16,615 --> 01:09:19,117
You don't wanna be involved with me
because your parents would shit

1127
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:22,871
if they knew their little princess
was boning a house painter.

1128
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,582
Well, you might not think
I have any potential,

1129
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,209
but you're gonna feel pretty stupid

1130
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:30,170
when I become famous and you see
you're gonna miss out big time.

1131
01:09:30,254 --> 01:09:31,964
I'm sure I will.

1132
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:35,050
- Yeah, right.
- No, I'm...

1133
01:09:36,927 --> 01:09:41,557
Randy, I'm really sorry you're upset.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1134
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,100
You used me.

1135
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:44,560
You just wanted to sleep with me

1136
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:46,478
like I was some kind of a bimbo
or something.

1137
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:48,313
No. No, I...

1138
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:51,859
I just thought we were having fun.

1139
01:09:51,984 --> 01:09:53,902
Yeah, well, whatever.

1140
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:56,697
You have a nice life.

1141
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:59,324
Oh, you, too.

1142
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:01,952
And good luck with your career.

1143
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:05,372
I'll look forward
to seeing you on the big screen.

1144
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:12,838
Can I have
a goodbye kiss or something?

1145
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:14,882
Of course.

1146
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:22,890
Who's that?

1147
01:10:23,849 --> 01:10:25,350
Brandy.

1148
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:30,272
Well, take care.

1149
01:10:31,273 --> 01:10:33,192
Yeah, you, too, babe.

1150
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:52,544
Now, let me get this straight,
sweetheart.

1151
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:54,755
- You're dumping this gorgeous...
- Easy on the tequila, Marcy.

1152
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:57,633
...very intelligent-looking man,

1153
01:10:57,716 --> 01:11:01,011
because his horny little friend
hired a stripper?

1154
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:03,931
I just don't feel like
making myself vulnerable

1155
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:05,349
to getting trashed again.

1156
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:07,726
Why'd you get involved with him
in the first place?

1157
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:12,105
Well, I keep thinking that I'll change,
that I'll get more secure.

1158
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:17,402
It's so hard to risk
getting intimate time and time again.

1159
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:22,074
Taking my clothes off
in front of somebody for the first time.

1160
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:24,827
Explaining my breast implants.

1161
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:27,830
- Those aren't real?
- No, unfortunately.

1162
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:31,625
You know,
sometimes I imagine my coffin.

1163
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:37,047
When the rest of me is decomposed,
there's these two little bags of silicone.

1164
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:41,677
I mean, they're just sitting there
in that pine box.

1165
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,345
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus.

1166
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:47,474
You have every reason to be happy
right now and listen to you.

1167
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,561
Do you think maybe
you're just not in love with Jerry?

1168
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:53,063
He's the best guy I've ever been with!

1169
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:58,277
I'd give anything in the world if I could
find a nice Jewish boy and settle down.

1170
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:01,405
He's so cute

1171
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:04,199
- with those round little glasses.
- Oh, God!

1172
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:08,412
- You're so funny.
- Marcy.

1173
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:11,999
It's been fun, girls. We must do it again.

1174
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,751
He's so funny.

1175
01:12:14,835 --> 01:12:18,672
- You're drunk, girlfriend.
- Oh, no, I'm just relaxed.

1176
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:23,552
Jamie, you marry that boy.
He sounds like heaven on a stick.

1177
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:25,721
- Bye-bye.
- Take care.

1178
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:27,097
Night.

1179
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:33,604
Jill, that's Tina's blanket.

1180
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,481
So? It's cosy.

1181
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:37,065
That's gross.

1182
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:41,987
Let's stick her hand in my ginger ale
and see if she pees.

1183
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:49,453
Oh, she looks like a little child,
doesn't she?

1184
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,290
Oh, lucky her to be so innocent!

1185
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:55,584
- Marcy.
- Oh, God.

1186
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:57,669
Give me that. Give it to me.

1187
01:12:57,836 --> 01:12:59,463
I'm so tired.

1188
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,298
It's late.

1189
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:04,134
It's time to hit the hay.

1190
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:08,222
I can't believe he hasn't even called.

1191
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:12,851
I didn't get any message
about a cancellation.

1192
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:16,313
I'm sorry. We left it on your service.

1193
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:18,690
I drove here
all the way from Simi Valley.

1194
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:21,819
What, you guys
don't like the way I look?

1195
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:23,821
No, no, no. No way.

1196
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:26,240
You're terrific.

1197
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:29,827
He just
doesn't want to upset his fiance.

1198
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:33,330
- Hey!
- Turn it off.

1199
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:36,500
- It's the new direct digital sound.
- Look,

1200
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:42,256
I'm sorry about the confusion.
Personally, I'd still like to see the show.

1201
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:45,884
Well, then, when you get married,
why don't you give me a call?

1202
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:49,847
Who is this? It's 3:00 a. m.

1203
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:54,810
Hello? Hi, Jerry.

1204
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:59,940
Yeah, hang on a second.

1205
01:14:05,154 --> 01:14:08,866
- Jamie, Jerry's on the phone.
- Tell him I hate him.

1206
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:10,409
Jamie.

1207
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:22,296
Your bathroom mirrors
are making me suicidal.

1208
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,339
Hello?

1209
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:26,049
Hey, you guys, listen,

1210
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:28,760
I didn't want to tell you this before
because I was too embarrassed

1211
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:30,471
- but you know what I did once?
- I'm allergic to down.

1212
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:32,389
There are other blankets, Rachel.

1213
01:14:32,473 --> 01:14:33,599
You want me to get you another one?

1214
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:36,602
What? You did?

1215
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:39,605
Of course I believe you.

1216
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:44,359
Oh, Jerry, do you really love me?
You do? I'm so sorry.

1217
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:46,653
No, I am. I am sorry.

1218
01:14:46,737 --> 01:14:50,073
Of course, I still wanna marry you.
Don't be ridiculous.

1219
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:51,992
It's just that...

1220
01:14:55,537 --> 01:14:56,622
Here's another comforter.

1221
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:58,540
- It's not down.
- So, you guys, listen,

1222
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:03,045
when I was about 12,
when I was first growing pubic hair,

1223
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:08,258
I got out of the shower and it was all wet
and dripping, you know.

1224
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:12,095
Honey, can you talk up? I can't hear.

1225
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:14,640
And Tuffy, our dog,

1226
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:18,060
started licking it because he was thirsty,

1227
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:21,063
and I just let him.

1228
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:26,151
Right on.

1229
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:28,737
Well, we're all just sharing
our sex stories.

1230
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:31,406
Oh, honey, I love you so much. I do.

1231
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:35,118
I wish that I could come home right now
and hop into bed with you.

1232
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:39,665
This whole sort of slumber party's
been fun but it's really exhausting.

1233
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:44,461
And Rachel and Jill, they have been
going at it all night, as usual.

1234
01:15:45,337 --> 01:15:49,383
Oh, I can't sleep without you,
bunny face.

1235
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:50,801
Bunny face.

1236
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:53,262
Bye.

1237
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:01,353
He cancelled the stripper.

1238
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,605
Good, bunny face.

1239
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:06,316
Were you eavesdropping
on that whole conversation?

1240
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,820
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to use the bathroom.

1241
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:15,325
No, Marcy, no!
I haven't got the plug in yet.

1242
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:18,287
Marcy, no. Cut it out.

1243
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,663
I don't feel well.

1244
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:21,165
Dibs on the sofa.

1245
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:23,041
You always do that.
Why should you get the sofa?

1246
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:25,878
- Motherhood takes precedence.
- Not if she isn't pregnant.

1247
01:16:25,961 --> 01:16:27,546
She is pregnant.

1248
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:38,223
I'm sorry. I'm tired, Jill. I totally spaced.

1249
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:39,641
She hates me.

1250
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:42,311
The wedding's back on.

1251
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:49,818
He's such a good guy.

1252
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:54,281
Even if he does only have one testicle,
he's a hell of a guy!

1253
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,783
You are too much.

1254
01:16:57,367 --> 01:17:00,037
Great. Now everyone hates me.

1255
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:03,207
I wonder why.

1256
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:05,542
I don't feel very good.

1257
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,544
I think I need some fresh air.

1258
01:17:13,926 --> 01:17:16,678
Rachel. Please come out.

1259
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:21,600
She's hardly told anyone.
Rachel, come on.

1260
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:23,727
Leave me alone.

1261
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:26,688
Rachel, let me in.

1262
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:33,403
Chris.

1263
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:34,947
Jesus, man, what'd I do now?

1264
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:38,325
Nothing. I'm trying to get Rachel
out of the bathroom. She's upset.

1265
01:17:38,408 --> 01:17:39,785
Right.

1266
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:42,913
I'll see you in bed.

1267
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,249
- I'm sleeping in the living room.
- What?

1268
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:48,752
I'm the hostess for Christ's sake.
It's a slumber party.

1269
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:52,548
- Why don't you just grow up?
- No, why don't you grow up?

1270
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:55,676
Stop being so fucking possessive.

1271
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:59,179
If you don't like it here, why don't you
just go live someplace else?

1272
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:00,681
Fine.

1273
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:05,310
Shit.

1274
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:06,895
Rachel.

1275
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:09,523
Open the fucking door. Let me in.

1276
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:30,377
- I'm sorry I opened my big mouth.
- No, it's not your fault.

1277
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:36,633
She always finds some way to
hurt me or exclude me

1278
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:38,677
ever since we were born.

1279
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,262
I mean, I'm her sister, for God's sake!

1280
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:42,222
Why wouldn't she tell me
something that important?

1281
01:18:42,306 --> 01:18:43,390
Because she's confused.

1282
01:18:43,474 --> 01:18:45,350
She doesn't even know
what she's gonna do yet.

1283
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:47,186
What do you mean,
what she's gonna do?

1284
01:18:47,269 --> 01:18:49,813
Well, she just got Noah
ready for preschool

1285
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:53,442
and she wants to go back
to school herself, you know that.

1286
01:18:54,485 --> 01:18:56,862
She's not thinking of having an abortion.

1287
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:58,447
Well, I don't know what she's thinking.

1288
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:01,325
You know,
she hasn't even talked to Don yet.

1289
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:05,245
She is so selfish

1290
01:19:05,496 --> 01:19:07,831
to even consider that!

1291
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:09,583
Just for her own convenience?

1292
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,793
You know,
that's why she didn't want to tell you.

1293
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:15,255
I'm sorry. I can't understand
how anybody can do that.

1294
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:18,008
You don't know
what it's like to be my age

1295
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:20,844
and just watch your eggs
just walking away from you.

1296
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:28,018
I want a baby more than anything.

1297
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:30,979
Honey.

1298
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:33,398
Okay.

1299
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:37,402
But Jill's life is still her decision.

1300
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:42,157
What makes you think
I don't understand, huh?

1301
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:44,451
I want to have a baby, too.

1302
01:19:44,701 --> 01:19:46,495
How could you? I mean...

1303
01:19:46,578 --> 01:19:48,580
Rachel, give me a break.

1304
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:52,292
I mean, haven't you ever heard
of a turkey baster for God's sake?

1305
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:55,921
How does Chris feel?

1306
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:57,673
Who knows?

1307
01:19:57,923 --> 01:20:00,175
I don't know how I feel
about Chris right now.

1308
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:03,428
- I'm very confused about all that.
- About what?

1309
01:20:04,388 --> 01:20:08,267
Everything. I just don't know
what I really want right now.

1310
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:14,106
You know,
there's this guy at work that I really like.

1311
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:16,525
Really?

1312
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:19,570
Yeah. And I find myself
thinking all kinds of stupid things.

1313
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:24,032
You know, like how much easier my life
would be if I were straight, you know?

1314
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:27,744
- How happy my mother would be.
- Oh, your mother.

1315
01:20:28,912 --> 01:20:31,456
She wasn't exactly a model mother.

1316
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:34,042
Why do you care what she thinks?

1317
01:20:34,126 --> 01:20:35,961
- Yeah, well...
- I'm sorry.

1318
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:37,713
It's okay.

1319
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:41,550
It's just as well
I was here with my grandmother.

1320
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:42,801
But, I mean, you know,

1321
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:46,555
I might like to get married someday
and have kids.

1322
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,393
I don't know.

1323
01:20:52,603 --> 01:20:56,440
Shit. I am just too old
to be this mixed up.

1324
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:00,736
You poor thing.

1325
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:07,576
I always think of you as
so calm and capable.

1326
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:13,832
I always forget
that you could have problems, too.

1327
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:15,542
I'm okay.

1328
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:26,261
Let's go back in
and join the party, okay?

1329
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:28,514
Come on. Come on.

1330
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:32,309
Come on.

1331
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:34,144
Okay.

1332
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:50,118
I always wanted to be a ballerina.

1333
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,540
I studied for 10 years.

1334
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,793
Now I'm just a CPA with duck feet.

1335
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:02,840
You got nice posture.

1336
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:04,466
Thanks.

1337
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:09,304
That's why my mother
wanted me to study it in the first place.

1338
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:13,600
My mom, she tried
to get me to take dance.

1339
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:15,727
I took bowling instead.

1340
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:19,481
Wow. So you knew pretty young.

1341
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:25,195
Well, you know, I mean that...

1342
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:31,660
You know, Georgina was always
just like the rest of us.

1343
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:35,247
Yeah. I know.
I know what you mean, you know.

1344
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,791
She's bi, and I'm a dyke.

1345
01:22:39,877 --> 01:22:42,421
I knew I was gay when I was five.

1346
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:46,633
I had this really big crush on
Barbara Eden from I Dream of Jeannie.

1347
01:22:46,717 --> 01:22:50,012
I love that show! Oh, I love that show!

1348
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:52,598
I used to have this little Jeannie outfit.

1349
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:55,100
I wanted to look just like her.

1350
01:22:57,019 --> 01:22:58,979
I wanted to marry her.

1351
01:22:59,563 --> 01:23:01,523
Is Barbara Eden gay?

1352
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:06,028
I don't know.
She's not really my type any more.

1353
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:07,988
Oh. Yeah.

1354
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:11,700
She hasn't done much lately.

1355
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:14,745
Anyway.

1356
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:18,207
Wow.

1357
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:22,419
Do you know,
sometimes I've wished I was gay.

1358
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:26,381
It seems like
it would be so much easier.

1359
01:23:27,174 --> 01:23:28,342
Why?

1360
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:30,469
I don't know.

1361
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:33,847
Because then
you wouldn't have to deal with men.

1362
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:36,517
Women are so much easier
to get along with.

1363
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,019
They're so much more diplomatic.

1364
01:23:42,231 --> 01:23:44,066
I've noticed.

1365
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:48,487
I know, but they really love each other.

1366
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,365
It's pretty much the same
when you're gay, you know?

1367
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:54,618
You get in the same fights,
the same jealousy and stuff.

1368
01:23:54,827 --> 01:23:57,454
It's just less socially acceptable.

1369
01:23:58,872 --> 01:24:01,208
Hey, I have a gay third cousin in Seattle.

1370
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:04,253
She married her lover in a big wedding.

1371
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:06,797
They even registered for china.

1372
01:24:07,339 --> 01:24:10,259
My mom bought them
a whole place setting.

1373
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:14,221
She's very impressed
with their families.

1374
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,394
You seem really sad.

1375
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:28,694
I think Georgina wants to break up.

1376
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:35,826
You know, I've always envied you.

1377
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:37,953
You have the perfect husband,
the perfect kid.

1378
01:24:38,036 --> 01:24:40,080
- What do I look like, Mrs Beaver?
- Cleaver.

1379
01:24:40,164 --> 01:24:43,041
Don't try to convince her she's happy,
Jamie. She'd rather be tragic.

1380
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:45,419
Oh, listen to Miss Prozac.

1381
01:24:48,672 --> 01:24:52,092
Can't you ever keep your mouth shut
about anything?

1382
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:55,137
I'm just so tired of her moods,
you know.

1383
01:24:55,971 --> 01:25:00,601
That's so amazing.
I never knew Georgina had moods.

1384
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:03,896
Well, she's great with her friends.

1385
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:07,524
It's just as a lover, you know, it's like,

1386
01:25:07,608 --> 01:25:10,611
"come here" one minute,
"go away" the next.

1387
01:25:11,612 --> 01:25:14,406
Plus, she's so smart, you know.

1388
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:16,950
And beautiful.

1389
01:25:19,578 --> 01:25:21,955
I mean, you know, I'm...

1390
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:23,749
I'm a baker.

1391
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:26,543
I'm just a baker, and she's a chef.

1392
01:25:27,294 --> 01:25:30,088
I don't know what she saw in me
to begin with.

1393
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:31,965
Oh, I do.

1394
01:25:32,549 --> 01:25:35,511
- I think you're very attractive.
- Please.

1395
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:37,471
No, I do. I...

1396
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,015
Hey, if I were a woman...

1397
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,560
Or a lesbian...

1398
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:46,730
You know what I mean.

1399
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:52,027
I find you very attractive
because you seem so

1400
01:25:52,736 --> 01:25:55,447
comfortable with your sexuality.

1401
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:57,950
You know, Georgina seems more

1402
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:00,452
confused.

1403
01:26:01,787 --> 01:26:03,080
Really?

1404
01:26:03,288 --> 01:26:04,706
Oh, yeah.

1405
01:26:05,624 --> 01:26:08,126
Yeah, you have, like,
a self-awareness thing.

1406
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,087
It's very appealing.

1407
01:26:11,213 --> 01:26:13,549
I wish I were more like that.

1408
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:20,931
That's a very nice thing for you to say.

1409
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:48,167
Where the hell is Chris?

1410
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:50,169
What, you think I'm jealous of you?
Don't flatter yourself.

1411
01:26:50,252 --> 01:26:51,795
Stop! Just leave me alone
and stop picking on me.

1412
01:26:51,879 --> 01:26:53,213
You have been picking on me all night!

1413
01:26:53,297 --> 01:26:55,340
- She's been picking on everybody!
- Oh, fine!

1414
01:26:55,424 --> 01:26:58,385
Let's just all gang up on Jill
when I'm pregnant and I don't feel well!

1415
01:26:58,469 --> 01:27:01,430
- All right! All right! Walk away, Jill!
- Nobody's ganging up on you.

1416
01:27:01,513 --> 01:27:02,639
Yes, you are!

1417
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:04,183
When you want something
you walk away from me.

1418
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:06,310
- You're such a big baby.
- Here you are.

1419
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,312
Yeah, what do you care?

1420
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:11,356
You think I'm some spinster and you
have to lie to me so I don't fall apart?

1421
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,816
I've been worried
and I've been looking for you.

1422
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,151
Well, if the shoe fits, wear it!

1423
01:27:17,196 --> 01:27:20,699
Marcy, for God's sake,
it's 4:00 in the morning. Shut up!

1424
01:27:20,782 --> 01:27:23,744
- Stop telling her what to do.
- Chris, you shut up.

1425
01:27:23,827 --> 01:27:26,288
- You shut up.
- Hey, don't tell her to shut up!

1426
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:53,774
- Come on in!
- Come on, get in!

1427
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:04,910
- Chris, come on in.
- Rachel's wearing a bra!

1428
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,622
Come on!

1429
01:29:48,597 --> 01:29:49,723
No!

1430
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,288
Now look what you did, you stupid idiot.

1431
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:47,419
I was talking about four...

1432
01:33:47,503 --> 01:33:49,087
Watch out, Marcy!

1433
01:33:49,171 --> 01:33:51,507
Four, including Jason.

1434
01:33:54,885 --> 01:33:57,054
What do you guys think
about Jeff Harland?

1435
01:33:57,137 --> 01:33:59,556
He's cute,
but I think David Cassidy's cuter.

1436
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,142
- Oh, I think I'm gonna choke!
- No way.
