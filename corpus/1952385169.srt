1
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:29,367
OKAY.

2
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:34,300
MM, THIS LOOKS GOOD.

3
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,300
THERE YOU GO, KITTY.

4
00:00:40,868 --> 00:00:42,434
MM.

5
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,634
IT'S GOOD, HUH?

6
00:00:57,968 --> 00:00:59,634
YEAH.

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,367
HEY HEY.

8
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,367
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

9
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:16,167
OKAY, LET'S GO INSIDE.

10
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,400
OH, I KNOW.

11
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:29,367
* GO TO SLEEP,
LITTLE KITTY *

12
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:34,434
* GO TO SLEEP, LITTLE KITTY

13
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:39,567
* DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES *

14
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:44,734
* TILL THE SUN'S
IN THE SKY. *

15
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:50,901
- WE'RE CLOSING NOW, ROGER. - CAN
I HAVE ONE FOR THE ROAD, THOUGH?

16
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:52,901
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- JUST-- JUST ONE MORE.

17
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,234
- JUST FOR THE ROAD.
- NO.

18
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:56,334
FOR THE ROAD.
JUST ONE FOR THE ROAD.

19
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:58,100
THERE'S THE FUCKIN' ROAD!

20
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,133
NOW GO.

21
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,534
OH GOD.

22
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:06,300
JESUS CHRIST.

23
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:17,300
<i>Welcome to the world of relaxation.</i>

24
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,667
<i>By following</i>
<i>my exercises</i>

25
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:25,300
<i>you will enhance</i>
<i>your ability to relax.</i>

26
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,801
<i>Now I want you</i>

27
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:30,501
<i>to touch your index finger</i>
<i>with your thumb.</i>

28
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,534
<i>This gesture</i>
<i>is to symbolize</i>

29
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:37,033
<i>the link between</i>
<i>the body and the mind.</i>

30
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:40,901
<i>Now close your eyes.</i>

31
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,133
<i>I want you to take</i>
<i>a deep breath.</i>

32
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:50,968
<i>And now slowly exhale.</i>

33
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,667
<i>You are entirely at peace</i>
<i>with your environment.</i>

34
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,467
<i>You feel calm.</i>

35
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:09,667
<i>You feel tranquil.</i>

36
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:13,934
<i>I want you to visualize</i>
<i>the scene I describe.</i>

37
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:18,167
<i>I want you to mentally</i>
<i>recreate every detail.</i>

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,534
<i>You are lying</i>
<i>on an endless white beach.</i>

39
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:27,200
<i>The sun is rising.</i>

40
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,534
<i>Feel the palm trees swaying--</i>

41
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,033
OOH OOH!

42
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,234
THERE YOU GO.

43
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,267
JUST DRINK YOUR MILK
IN ONE GO.

44
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,767
THAT SHOULD TAKE AWAY
THE HICCUPS.

45
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:27,200
- AM I DEAD?
- NO, YOU'RE LUCKY.

46
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:32,434
OH.

47
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:35,901
OKAY.OKAY.

48
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,667
OH, JACQUES, NOT AGAIN.
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST DIE?

49
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,234
GOOD TO SEE
YOU TOO, OLIVIA.

50
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,734
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?
THIS IS NOT MY WARD.

51
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,501
I HAVE TOLD YOU 100 TIMES--

52
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,400
THIS IS A HOSPITAL,
NOT A ZOO.

53
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,868
WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN
STRICT HYGIENIC STANDARDS.

54
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:42,467
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A FUCKIN'
WORD YOU'RE SAYING.

55
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,400
<i>CALL THE FUCKING</i>
<i>ORIENTAL EMBASSY</i>

56
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,501
AND MAKE THEM SEND OVER
AN INTERPRETER IMMEDIATELY.

57
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:48,334
YOU HAVE TO GET RID
OF THE DOG.

58
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,167
IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO STAY HERE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

59
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:51,968
HE'S GOT A NAME, YOU KNOW.
HIS NAME'S ROCOCO.

60
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:53,701
I DON'T CARE
WHAT'S HIS NAME.

61
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,834
HE'S GOT TO LEAVE.

62
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,767
GO BACK TO THE THIRD WORLD,
YOU CHINKY CORIANDER BITCH!

63
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,934
I HOPE YOU DROP DEAD.

64
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,267
DO ME A FAVOR--

65
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,400
UNPLUG THE SMOKE DETECTOR.

66
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,267
WHAT?

67
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:15,167
UNPLUG THE SMOKE DETECTOR.

68
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:19,300
<i>NOW THERE ARE TWO BOXES</i>
<i>ON THE LEFT ON THE WALL.</i>

69
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,801
THE LITTLE ONE ABOVE.
TWO DOORS-- OPEN THEM.

70
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:38,067
NOW UNPLUG THE GREEN WIRE.

71
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:42,267
<i>YES, THAT'S IT.</i>

72
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,734
SO WHAT THE FUCK
HAPPENED TO YOU?

73
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:13,067
SUICIDE... ATTEMPT.
NOT SUCCESSFUL.

74
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,400
JESUS.

75
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,968
EVERY SINGLE DAY
I'M FIGHTING

76
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:18,968
A BLOODY BATTLE
FOR MY LIFE.

77
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:22,100
AT THE SAME TIME, SOME MORON
IN THE PRIME OF HIS YOUTH

78
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,000
IS READY TO THROW HIS LIFE
STRAIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN.

79
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,501
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
- HEART ATTACK NUMBER FIVE.

80
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:35,801
SO, LUCAS,

81
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:38,868
I HOPE THE HOSPITAL'S
BEEN TREATING YOU WELL.

82
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,200
<i>I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD</i>
<i>TO SEEING YOU TODAY.</i>

83
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,801
ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT
WE MAY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

84
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:49,033
SOME THINGS THAT
YOU MAY FIND UNPLEASANT.

85
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:54,968
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY,
BUT I HAVE TO ASK IT.

86
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,067
WHY DID YOU TRY SUICIDE?

87
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,033
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN IT COMES

88
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:05,267
TO SURVIVAL
OF THE FITTEST,

89
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:08,200
I JUST HAVE TO THROW IN
THE TOWEL, I GUESS.

90
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,701
<i>BUT YOU'RE NOT</i>
<i>AN ANIMAL, LUCAS.</i>

91
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,868
YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING.

92
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:14,000
YOU LIVE IN
A HIGHLY-DEVELOPED SOCIETY

93
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,968
THAT HAS ALL KINDS OF
BUFFERS AND SECURITY NETS

94
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:18,901
THAT ARE DESIGNED
TO BREAK YOUR FALL.

95
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:22,801
NO.I DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES
OF CIVILIZATION ANYMORE.

96
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,634
I AM OUTSIDE.
I AM AN ANIMAL.

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,367
TRY TO THINK OF LIFE
AS A COCONUT:

98
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,701
<i>IT'S HARD</i>
<i>ON THE OUTSIDE,</i>

99
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:40,834
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE
PROPER TOOLS OR THE KNOW-HOW,

100
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:44,267
IT CAN SEEM TOTALLY
USELESS AND FUTILE.

101
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:47,934
BUT IF YOU KNOW HOW TO OPEN IT,
THERE'S SWEET JUICE INSIDE.

102
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:52,734
<i>BUT THE KEY IS NOT TO KEEP</i>
<i>THE COCONUT TO YOURSELF.</i>

103
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:55,067
ONCE YOU LEARN
HOW TO OPEN THE COCONUT,

104
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:58,934
YOU SHARE THE COCONUT WITH
SOMEONE WHO HAS NO COCONUT.

105
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:01,934
AND THEN YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPINESS IS.

106
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:07,934
- SHARE THE COCONUT?
- YES.

107
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:54,434
I AM VERY THANKFUL
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU.

108
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,267
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

109
00:10:56,267 --> 00:11:00,601
YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE
AND GIVEN ME

110
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,067
FOOD TO EAT
AND CLOTHES TO WEAR.

111
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,067
I WISH I COULD PAY YOU
BACK IN SOME WAY,

112
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,667
BUT I HAVE
NOTHING TO GIVE...

113
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,601
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- ...EXCEPT FOR MY SPERM.

114
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,767
I WOULD LIKE
TO DONATE MY SPERM.

115
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:13,501
NO NO.

116
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,767
I KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH,
BUT IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

117
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:20,434
IT'S AWFULLY KIND OF YOU,
BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

118
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,801
DOING YOU A PERSONAL FAVOR
THAT YOU HAVE TO REPAY.

119
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:25,434
THIS IS A HOSPITAL.
WE'RE JUST DOING OUR JOB.

120
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:29,167
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
IS THAT YOU SURVIVED.

121
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:33,767
PLEASE, THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO.

122
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,767
WELL, IF YOU INSIST
ON DOING SOMETHING FOR US,

123
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,300
I COULD SIGN YOU UP
AS AN ORGAN DONOR.

124
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,133
THERE'S ALWAYS
A BIG NEED FOR ORGANS.

125
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,601
MY WHOLE BODY.

126
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,968
I AM READY TO DONATE MY BODY
AND MY SOUL TO SCIENCE.

127
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:48,667
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO START WITH?
A KIDNEY?

128
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,334
YOU JUST TAKE
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

129
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,133
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
THANK YOU.

130
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:55,334
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- GOOD LUCK.

131
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:58,434
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

132
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:05,501
- THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

133
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:08,634
AND HERE'S A LITTLE
FAREWELL GIFT FROM THE STAFF

134
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:11,634
TO HELP MAKE YOUR
NEW START A GOOD ONE.

135
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,667
OH.

136
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:35,734
- WHAT IS IT?
- WHERE'S LUCAS?

137
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:39,501
YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO USE
THIS BELL IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.

138
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:41,133
WHERE'S LUCAS?

139
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,234
WELL, I SUPPOSE LUCAS
IS FREE TO GO WHERE HE WANTS

140
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:45,334
WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION.

141
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:51,033
SON OF A MOTHER FUCKIN'
LESBIAN BITCH.

142
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,567
LUC?

143
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,167
- WHAT UP, MAN?
- HEY.

144
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,067
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS.

145
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,400
BOY, YOU LOOK GOOD AS A
GOVERNMENT CHECK. HOW YOU BEEN?

146
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,334
UH, I'VE... I'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN A LITTLE ILL RECENTLY.

147
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:09,300
- YOU'VE BEEN UNDER THE
WEATHER, HUH? - YEAH.

148
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,267
BUT YOU'RE BACK ON ALL FOURS NOW,
AIN'T YOU, CAT?

149
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,934
YEAH, DOING MUCH BETTER.
THANK YOU, POET.

150
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:15,033
- I KNOW YOU'RE A STEPPER.
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

151
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,100
TOUGH TITTY FOR A KITTY,
BUT THE MILK IS GOOD HOT.

152
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,000
- BUT IT'S FAIR OUT HERE, MAN.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

153
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,934
A LITTLE GRIND,
TRYING TO KEEP A FEW DOLLARS

154
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,834
OF THE LUNCH MONEY
IN THE POCKET.

155
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,701
- I KNOW. ME TOO, POET.
- IT JUST AIN'T EASY, BABE.

156
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:29,501
OH, HEY, I ACTUALLY FELL INTO
A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS RECENTLY.

157
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,968
- HEY, AIN'T THAT A BLESSING?
- MAYBE I COULD LEND YOU A FEW.

158
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:34,334
HEY, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER YOU CAN STAND, KID.

159
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:35,834
- I APPRECIATE THIS, MAN.
- THERE YOU GO.

160
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,100
SO EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT, HUH?

161
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,534
EXCUSE ME,
I WAS WONDERING

162
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:41,501
BY ANY CHANCE CAN YOU,
LIKE, GIVE A DOLLAR OR TWO?

163
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,367
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

164
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,033
OF COURSE I CAN.
HERE.

165
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:48,200
MOST APPRECIATIVE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

166
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,734
OH, MAY I HAVE SOME,
PLEASE?

167
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,167
- YES.
- I'M HIS FRIEND.

168
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,534
- NO NO, I KNOW.
- HE'S MY FRIEND.

169
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,234
- OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
- THANK YOU.

170
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:57,400
- THERE YOU GO.OKAY.
- HOW ABOUT ME?

171
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,968
- THAT'S FOR YOU.
- THANKS.

172
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:02,334
AND THAT'S FOR YOU.

173
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,968
ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY.

174
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:46,300
WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?

175
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:52,267
THESE FILES ARE
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

176
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,234
NOW GET OUT.

177
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,634
LUCAS?

178
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:38,834
<i>LUCAS, YOU LITTLE PUNK.</i>

179
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:42,000
- <i>YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.</i>
- WHAT?

180
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,367
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

181
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:48,167
I APPRECIATE IT,
JACQUES,

182
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:50,634
BUT I-- I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO BE LEFT ALONE.

183
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:54,234
COME WITH ME, LUCAS.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

184
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:55,634
FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS,

185
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:57,834
YOU COULD DO WITH
SOME HELP YOURSELF.

186
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,934
OH SHIT.

187
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:35,033
<i>OKAY.</i>

188
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,067
BOMBS AWAY.

189
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:00,067
AH.

190
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,934
<i>HOUSE OF OYSTERS?</i>

191
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:31,934
WHY IS IT CALLED
HOUSE OF OYSTERS?

192
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:35,200
WELL, WHEN I BOUGHT
THE PLACE,

193
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,968
BACK IN THE DAYS,
IT WAS AN OLD OYSTER BAR

194
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,400
RUN BY THE LATE
MR. SAVIOLA.

195
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,200
<i>BUT AFTER A CUSTOMER</i>
<i>CONSUMED A LETHAL OYSTER,</i>

196
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,868
<i>MR. SAVIOLA WAS FORCED</i>
<i>TO CLOSE DOWN THE BUSINESS.</i>

197
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:51,567
BUT I KEPT THE NAME BECAUSE
IT'S THE NAME OF THE BAR,

198
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:54,434
AND A BAR SHOULD NOT
CHANGE ITS NAME,

199
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,934
NO MATTER WHAT GOES WRONG
IN THE WORLD.

200
00:18:56,934 --> 00:19:01,701
COME HELL OR HIGH WATER,
WHEN THE SMOG DISSOLVES,

201
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:04,968
YOU GOTTA TRUST THAT YOUR BAR
IS STILL GONNA BE THERE.

202
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,601
<i>WE'RE READY.</i>
<i>SEND IT OVER.</i>

203
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,434
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- LIKEWISE.

204
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:32,834
CHIN LEE
IS MY EXCELLENT COOK.

205
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:35,567
- MONEYED SALE.
- THANK YOU, CHIN LEE.

206
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:38,601
MY HEART'S NO GOOD.

207
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:40,434
I COULD PASS AWAY
ANY DAY NOW.

208
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:44,767
I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY,
NO FRIENDS,

209
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,701
AND I'M NOT EVEN INTERESTED
IN ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

210
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:51,334
WHAT I AM INTERESTED IN

211
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:53,968
IS THAT THIS BAR GOES ON
AFTER I'M GONE.

212
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:56,534
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME
INTO THE PICTURE, LUCAS.

213
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:59,267
WHEN I'M GONE, I WANT YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

214
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:02,467
DON'T LIKE IT.

215
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,601
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

216
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:06,434
YOU USED TO EAT
OUT OF GARBAGE CANS.

217
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:10,133
BUT WHEN PRESENTED WITH THE HEIGHTS
OF GASTRONOMY, YOU REFUSE IT?

218
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:12,100
SORRY.

219
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,033
YOU HAVE MANY THINGS
TO LEARN, MY FRIEND.

220
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,968
AND I'M NOT
GONNA GIVE UP

221
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,067
UNTIL I'VE TAUGHT
YOU EVERYTHING.

222
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:24,801
FROM NOW ON,
YOU'RE MY STUDENT.

223
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,167
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE.

224
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:53,834
AND THIS IS WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE.

225
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
- OH, THANK YOU.
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

226
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,434
HERE'S SOME PAJAMAS.

227
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:27,067
<i>TOMORROW'S GONNA</i>
<i>BE A BUSY DAY.</i>

228
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:19,868
OPEN UP!

229
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,767
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU MORONS?

230
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,767
WHY IS THE BAR
CLOSED, JACQUES?

231
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,267
- I'M TRAINING A NEW EMPLOYEE.
- HOW LONG IS THAT GONNA TAKE?

232
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:28,501
- I DON'T KNOW.
- COME ON.

233
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:30,567
GIVE US AN IDEA.
A DAY, A YEAR, OR WHAT?

234
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:33,334
FOR GOD'S SAKE, STOP WHINING
AND GO BACK TO YOUR MOTHERS.

235
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:35,834
- BUT I WANNA GET A DRINK.
- MY MOTHER'S DEAD. YOU KNOW THAT.

236
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,033
<i>COME ON, JACQUES.</i>

237
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,434
JACQUES!

238
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:41,133
WELL, LONG SEE
NO TIME.

239
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:44,467
AH.

240
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:46,367
<i>HOW YOU DOING?</i>
<i>HOW'S THE OLD HEART?</i>

241
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:48,501
TERRIBLE AS USUAL,
DIMITRI.

242
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,167
- I HAVEN'T FUCKED SINCE LAST CENTURY.
- OH, NO.

243
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,467
THE CLOSEST I'VE COME
TO SEXUAL ACTIVITY

244
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:54,868
IS BRUSHING MY TEETH.

245
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:56,968
OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE,
JACQUES.

246
00:22:56,968 --> 00:22:58,767
BUT YOU STILL MANAGE
TO GET A BONER?

247
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,534
- HARDLY.
- OH, I'M SO SORRY, JACQUES.

248
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:04,334
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU,
MY FRIEND?

249
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:07,467
WHERE IS YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE?

250
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,234
- SARAH!
- <i>YES?</i>

251
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:11,133
JACQUES WANTS TO
SAY HELLO TO YOU.

252
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:13,334
<i>OKAY, COMING.</i>

253
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:19,367
OH, SARAH!
SARAH, SARAH, SARAH!

254
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,534
HI, JACQUES.

255
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,200
<i>OH MY GOD,</i>
<i>YOU SMELL SO GOOD.</i>

256
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,334
- THANK YOU, JACQUES.
- OH GOD, YOU SMELL GOOD.MM!

257
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:30,501
- <i>OKAY, JACQUES.</i>
- <i>IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, SARAH.</i>

258
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:31,968
- JACQUES.
- <i>OKAY, IT'S ENOUGH.</i>

259
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:33,901
- HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?
- JACQUES!

260
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:36,033
- WHAT?
- TAKE IT EASY.

261
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:39,901
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, JACQUES.
- WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU, SARAH.

262
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:42,033
- <i>COME BACK SOON.</i>
- <i>VERY VERY SOON.</i>

263
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:47,734
- WHERE WERE WE?
- I DON'T KNOW, JACQUES.

264
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,834
- WHY'D YOU COME?
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? - <i>OH YEAH.</i>

265
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,434
YOU SEE THIS
YOUNG GENTLEMAN?

266
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,200
I PULLED HIM
OUT OF THE GUTTER.

267
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,567
WE NEED TO GET HIM
PENGUINIZED.

268
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,901
JEEZ, WE'VE GOT
WORK TO DO.

269
00:23:57,901 --> 00:24:00,534
WELL, BRING IT ON, YOU FUCKING
COMMUNIST. WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.

270
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:03,534
- TAKE IT EASY, JACQUES.
- WHAT?

271
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:05,834
I MEAN, YOU BURST INTO MY STORE,
YOU HARASS MY WIFE,

272
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:07,834
AND NOW YOU START
CRITICIZING MY PAST AS WELL?

273
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,834
I'M NOT CRITICIZING YOU,
DIMITRI.

274
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:11,467
IT WAS A JOKE.
JEEZ.

275
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:15,033
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SO SENSITIVE
ABOUT YOUR COMMUNISTIC PAST.

276
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:17,734
CAN I CALL YOU
A CAPITALISTIC SWINE?

277
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:20,534
WOULD THAT WORK
FOR YOU, DIMITRI? JEEZ.

278
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,734
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

279
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:24,601
YOU GOT HEMORRHOIDS
OR SOMETHING?

280
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,634
THESE ARE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES

281
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:28,534
I HAVE EVER SEEN
IN MY LIFE, JACQUES,

282
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:32,200
- BUT THEY ARE SO STIFF.
- JESUS.

283
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,701
- <i>NO
ARTY-FARTY FASHION BULLSHIT.</i>

284
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:37,367
JUST A DECENT HAIRCUT.
CRAFTSMANSHIP, HONESTY--
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

285
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:38,801
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

286
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:41,067
YOU ARE IN
THE RIGHT PLACE, JACQUES.

287
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:43,934
I DON'T TRUST YOU.

288
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,667
OH, HERE.

289
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:55,334
WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF
WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW

290
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:57,734
IN CASE YOU NEED
SOME INSPIRATION.

291
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,267
HEY HEY HEY HEY.

292
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:03,467
I SAID NO FASHION CRAP.

293
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,968
HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU
THAT THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN

294
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:07,634
MIGHT HAVE AN OPINION
OF HIS OWN?

295
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:10,167
NO.IT IS I WHO'LL PAY
FOR THE OPERATION

296
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,601
AND IT IS I
WHO'LL CONDUCT IT.

297
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:14,167
SO PLEASE STOP
GETTING ON MY NERVES

298
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,767
AND JUST DO YOUR JOB.

299
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:18,234
MY JOB?

300
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,934
- HOW DARE YOU?
- FAGGOT.

301
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:34,133
OH-- OH DEAR, HAVE I--
HAVE I NICKED YOU?

302
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,834
OH NO, BLOOD.

303
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,167
I'M GONNA SUE YOUR FLAMING
WRINKLED HOMOSEXUAL ASS OFF,

304
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:40,534
YOU FUCKING MORON.

305
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:58,901
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

306
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:28,534
JESUS, JACQUES,
I FEEL STRANGE ABOUT THIS.

307
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,534
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

308
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:33,033
- DON'T YOU TRUST ME?
- I DON'T KNOW.

309
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:36,934
IT'S-- IT'S LIKE PEOPLE TAKE
AN EDUCATION TO LEARN THIS.

310
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:39,901
- YOU KNOW, FIVE YEARS OR SOMETHING.
- WHERE YOU BEEN?

311
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:42,167
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ROCKET SCIENCE, YOU KNOW.

312
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,701
IT'S A KNIFE-- THE OLDEST
TOOL KNOWN TO MAN.

313
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:47,067
OKAY.

314
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:50,133
- JUST BE CAREFUL.
- TRUST ME.

315
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:11,400
OH NO...

316
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,067
BLOOD.

317
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:28,868
OKAY OKAY, LISTEN UP,
GENTLEMEN.

318
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:31,868
I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE LUCAS.

319
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:34,133
- HOW YOU DOING, LUCAS?
- HI, LUCAS.

320
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,601
<i>YOU ACT LIKE A WOMAN, THOUGH.</i>

321
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:37,667
<i>BECAUSE THIS IS</i>
<i>FEMALE BEHAVIOR.</i>

322
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:41,000
WOMEN, WHEN THEY HEAR THAT MEN LIVE
WITH THEIR MOMMIES, IT'S NOT SO SEXY.

323
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,167
- <i>BELIEVE ME, I DON'T TELL THEM--</i>
- <i>YOU'RE VERY PASSIVE.</i>

324
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:47,300
<i>I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE</i>
<i>MORE PASSIVE THAN YOU.</i>

325
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,601
<i>WELL, THE TIMES THAT IT'S
WORKED FOR ME IS WHEN--</i>

326
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,634
<i>WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME YOU WERE ON A DATE?</i>

327
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:53,567
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

328
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,601
BUT, LIKE, IF I'M GOING OUT
OR IF I'M GOING TO A MOVIE,

329
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:57,667
LIKE I GOTTA GO TO A MOVIE UPTOWN,
I'LL TAKE THE TRAIN.

330
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:07,067
OH MY GOD, WE'VE GOT A WALK-IN.
WE'VE GOT A WALK-IN.

331
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,934
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- I'LL HAVE A BLOODY MARY, PLEASE.

332
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,634
AND DO YOU HAVE
ORGANIC TOMATO JUICE?

333
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,868
SORRY, WE'RE OUT OF CELERY.

334
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,234
BUT THEN IF YOU
ARE GOING UPTOWN,

335
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:45,701
- YOU ARE TAKING WHAT?
- LUCAS.

336
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:48,133
WE DON'T DO WALK-INS.

337
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,067
WHAT?

338
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:04,400
- <i>EAGER.</i>
- EAGER BEAVER.

339
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,934
LUCAS.

340
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,834
NEVER REMOVE
AN EMPTY GLASS.

341
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,234
IT IS THE CUSTOMER'S
HISTORY,

342
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:13,901
THE TRACK RECORD
OF HIS STATE OF MIND--

343
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:15,434
AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION

344
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:18,434
WHICH SHOULD NOT
BE FIXED NOR FALSIFIED.

345
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:24,267
HEY, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

346
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,567
<i>OVERVIEW OVERVIEW OVERVIEW.</i>

347
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:29,033
<i>YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING</i>
<i>ON WITH EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER.</i>

348
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,868
<i>WHO'S DRINKING WHAT?</i>
<i>WHO NEEDS A REFILL?</i>

349
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:33,100
<i>WHO WANTS TO BE LEFT ALONE?</i>

350
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,868
<i>EACH REGULAR HAS</i>
<i>THEIR OWN ROUTINE</i>

351
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:37,834
<i>WHICH YOU HAVE</i>
<i>TO LEARN BY HEART.</i>

352
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:39,901
<i>A DECENT BARTENDER KNOWS</i>
<i>WHAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS</i>

353
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:41,100
<i>BEFORE HE KNOWS IT HIMSELF.</i>

354
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:49,434
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

355
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:51,701
YOU TAKE
THE DAY'S EARNINGS

356
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:55,801
AND YOU PUT IT
RIGHT IN HERE.

357
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:58,901
- <i>INTO THE FREEZER?</i>
- INTO THE FREEZER.

358
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:01,701
I'VE BEEN BURGLARIZED
TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION.

359
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:03,934
AND I AIN'T LOST
A SINGLE DIME--

360
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:06,467
NOT SINCE I STARTED
FREEZING MY MONEY.

361
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:15,534
THIS IS ENRIQUE.

362
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:17,100
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

363
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,801
<i>IN FACT,</i>
<i>MY ONLY FRIEND.</i>

364
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:22,667
<i>HE LIVES IN MARTINIQUE</i>
<i>WHERE HE GROWS</i>

365
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:25,767
AND HANDPICKS
MY COFFEE BEANS.

366
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:27,434
WONDERFUL PERSON.

367
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:32,634
AND THIS IS HIS MOTHER,
JOSEPHINE.

368
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,400
IF I WASN'T
IN SUCH BAD SHAPE,

369
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,367
I'D GO STRAIGHT
TO MARTINIQUE AND MARRY HER.

370
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,133
WHO'S THE LITTLE GIRL?

371
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,067
AH.

372
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:48,934
THAT IS ENRIQUE'S BEAUTIFUL
NINE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, FELICIA.

373
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:52,634
I WANT YOU TO MARRY HER.

374
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,868
WHEN SHE'S
A LITTLE BIT OLDER.

375
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,767
<i>FOR OVER 15
YEARS HE'S DROPPED BY</i>

376
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:07,234
EVERY SINGLE DAY
FOR ONE CUP OF ESPRESSO.

377
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,334
<i>HE NEVER SAYS GOOD MORNING,</i>
<i>NEVER SAYS WHAT HE WANTS.</i>

378
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:14,701
<i>NOBODY EVEN KNOWS HIS NAME.</i>

379
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:17,267
BUT AS SOON
AS HE ARRIVES,

380
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:19,567
HE EXPECTS YOU TO BRING
THAT ESPRESSO.

381
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:23,501
<i>HE'LL DRINK IT</i>
<i>IN THREE SIPS</i>

382
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:25,434
<i>IN TOTAL SILENCE.</i>

383
00:31:27,634 --> 00:31:29,300
AND HE ALWAYS LEAVES
THE SAME TIP.

384
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,901
SOOTY, THIS ISN'T
YOUR USUAL

385
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,968
CHIMNEY SWEEPING
UNIFORM, IS IT?

386
00:31:49,968 --> 00:31:52,567
NAH, 'CAUSE SOOTY IS NOT
A CHIMNEY SWEEPER.

387
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,367
SOOTY IS A "CHIMNIST."

388
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:57,701
AND I AM LOOKING
PARTICULARLY DELICIOUS TODAY

389
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:00,767
BECAUSE I WAS OFFICIATING
AT A WEDDING.

390
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:04,367
NOW DID YOU KNOW THAT
IT IS LUCKY FOR A BRIDE

391
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:07,400
TO BE KISSED ON BOTH
CHEEKS BY A CHIMNIST?

392
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,901
YEAH.SO WHAT LUCK DOES
THE TRASHMAN BRING?

393
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:14,200
I AM A SANITATION ENGINEER

394
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,367
<i>WHO ONE DAY WILL BE THE FIRST</i>
<i>GARBAGE MAN TO GO OUT INTO SPACE.</i>

395
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:20,601
WE GOT TO GET RID OF SOME OF
THIS TRASH THAT'S AROUND HERE.

396
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:23,200
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU'RE GONNA BE A "TRASHTRONAUT."

397
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,100
- EXACTLY.
- SO WHAT?

398
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,267
YOU STUFF YOURSELF
INSIDE THE RUBBISH BIN

399
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:30,901
- AND, SHHH, SHOOT UP INTO THE
STRATOSPHERE? - <i>IT'LL HAPPEN.</i>

400
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:33,067
YEAH, I READ ABOUT IT.
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN ANY DAY NOW.

401
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:37,100
THERE'S A LOT OF RUBBISH IN THE
FLOWER BUSINESS, ISN'T THERE, RODDIE?

402
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,267
I HATE FLOWERS.
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT FLOWERS.

403
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:41,267
- <i>TOUCHY TOUCHY.</i>
- WHY?

404
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,868
MOMMY'S-- MOMMY'S
UPSETTING YOU?

405
00:32:43,868 --> 00:32:46,634
<i>SAY HI TO MOMMY</i>
<i>FOR ME, WILL YOU?</i>

406
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,701
I FORGET.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW?

407
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:52,400
THERE'S, LIKE,
A TECHNICAL TERM FOR IT.

408
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
IT'S, UM...
IT'S WHORE.

409
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,300
- OOH!
- OOH!

410
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,300
I AM NOT
A FUCKING WHORE.

411
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,934
I'M A STIMULATOR.

412
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,901
TIME TO WAKE UP.

413
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:16,133
- JACQUES, PLEASE.
- <i>TODAY'S A BIG DAY.</i>

414
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,467
TODAY'S THE DAY I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE COFFEE.

415
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:22,567
- MAKE COFFEE?
- <i>YEAH.</i>

416
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:26,400
I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG
ABOUT MY PERSON,

417
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,234
BUT I THINK THAT MAKING COFFEE
IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW SKILLS

418
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:31,834
THAT I ALREADY MASTERED.

419
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:36,667
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
AND DUTY IS TO TRANSFER

420
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:38,634
THE FULL RANGE
OF FLAVOR AND AROMA

421
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,834
OF ENRIQUE'S BEANS
TO THE CUP.

422
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:43,100
ANYTHING LESS
WILL BE A DISGRACE

423
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,868
TO THE CUSTOMERS,
MY BAR, AND ENRIQUE.

424
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:48,868
IN ORDER TO SUCCEED,

425
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:52,000
YOU MUST MASTER
A FEW TECHNICAL SKILLS.

426
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,834
THE FIRST INSTRUMENT
IS THE GRINDER.

427
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,601
NOW COFFEE CAN BE
GROUND IN MANY WAYS,

428
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,334
BUT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE
THE RIGHT WAY--

429
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:58,968
NEITHER TOO FINE
NOR TOO GRAINY.

430
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:00,834
WHEN THE WATER
IS A LITTLE OVER 90°

431
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:02,834
AND ALMOST BOILING,
IT IS FORCED THROUGH THE COFFEE

432
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,634
AT A PRESSURE
OF NINE ATMOSPHERES.

433
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:07,000
AND THIS SHOULD TAKE
EXACTLY 24 SECONDS.

434
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,367
IF IT TAKES MORE THAN 24 SECONDS,
THE COFFEE IS TOO FINE.

435
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:12,000
IF IT TAKES LESS THAN 24 SECONDS,
THE COFFEE IS TOO GRAINY.

436
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
YOU CAN PRACTICE
USING THIS STOPWATCH.

437
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,133
BUT IN TIME YOU WILL COME
TO LEARN BY HEART

438
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:20,300
THE DURATION
OF THE MAGIC 24 SECONDS.

439
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,200
WHY DON'T YOU EVEN TASTE THEM?

440
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,400
IT WOULD BE AN OFFENSE
TO MY TASTE BUDS.

441
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,601
YOU JUST DON'T EXPOSE THEM
TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

442
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:53,367
WELL, I CAN'T SEE
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.

443
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:56,767
- IT'S BLACK, IT'S HOT--
- IT'S DISGUSTING.

444
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:19,033
THIS IS BUTRAGUEÑO...

445
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,033
<i>...THE FAMOUS BULL.</i>

446
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:25,033
<i>BUENOS DIAS,</i> BUTRAGUEÑO,
YOU CRAZY CATHOLIC FUCK.

447
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,567
LUCKY BASTARD--

448
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,801
FUCKING THOSE BEAUTIFUL
COWS ALL DAY LONG.

449
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:18,067
WHY THE FUCK
DID YOU BUY A DUCK?

450
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:19,767
<i>IT'S OUR CHRISTMAS</i>
<i>DINNER, LUCAS.</i>

451
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:22,567
WE'RE GOING TO FEED IT
WITH ORANGES AND GINGER

452
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:24,801
AND FRESH ESTRAGON
AND COGNAC.

453
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:27,000
WE'RE GONNA MARINATE IT
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

454
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,200
- WE CAN'T KILL A FELLOW DUCK.
- <i>YES, WE CAN, LUCAS.</i>

455
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,601
MY MOUTH'S WATERING
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

456
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:52,467
<i>WHAT THE FUCK'S</i>
<i>GOING ON HERE?</i>

457
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:58,567
OKAY, YOU LET ME KNOW
HOW THIS ONE IS.

458
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:03,267
- HERE YOU ARE.
- THANK YOU.

459
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,167
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

460
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A SHAME

461
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
TO LET ALL THOSE
ESPRESSOS GO TO WASTE

462
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,734
WHILE I MASTER
THE TECHNIQUE,

463
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:24,734
SO I THOUGHT
WE COULD TAKE IT

464
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:26,667
AS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO HELP PEOPLE.

465
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,601
- HELP PEOPLE?
- YES, HELP PEOPLE.

466
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,934
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

467
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:41,267
WE'RE RUNNING A BUSINESS HERE,
NOT A GODDAMN SHELTER.

468
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:43,901
<i>NOW GET THESE LOSERS</i>
<i>OUT OF MY SIGHT!</i>

469
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:46,367
FINISH YOUR--
JACQUES...

470
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:49,267
AREN'T YOU SOMETIMES AFRAID
THAT YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL?

471
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:54,334
CHRISTOPHER, YOU CAN FINISH
YOUR COFFEE. IT'S FINE.

472
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:55,834
GO!

473
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,767
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
THANK YOU.

474
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:05,267
WHAT ARE WE GONNA
CALL YOU?

475
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:13,133
ESTRAGON?

476
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:16,133
OKAY.

477
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:18,067
ESTRAGON.

478
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:31,133
BAR'S CLOSED.
GET THE FUCK OUT.

479
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:34,367
WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
THE OWNER OF THIS BUILDING.

480
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:36,434
CORRECT.

481
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,267
WE'RE BUYING BUILDINGS
IN THIS AREA

482
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:41,100
AND WE'RE INTERESTED IN LOOKING
INTO BUYING THIS ONE TOO.

483
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:47,100
WELL, FOR A BILLION DOLLARS

484
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,767
I'LL GIVE YOU A SCENIC TOUR
OF MY ANAL CANAL.

485
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:53,467
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THEM APPLES?

486
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:55,634
IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO SIT DOWN FOR A WHILE--

487
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:59,267
GODDAMN, YOU'RE LIKE A PIECE
OF SHIT THAT JUST WON'T FLUSH.

488
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:02,534
NOW GET THE FUCK OUT OF
HERE BEFORE I GET RUDE.

489
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:07,767
LET'S GO, GUYS.

490
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:16,367
"A WALK IN THE MISTS
OF TIME AND SPACE."

491
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:20,133
- WHAT IS THAT?
- IT'S THE TITLE OF MY BOOK.

492
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:22,434
I LIKE IT.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THAT.

493
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:24,133
YEAH, WELL, I'M STUCK THOUGH.
I'M BLOCKED.

494
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:26,267
COME ON, YOU GOT IT
IN YOUR BLOOD.

495
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:28,300
YOU'RE JULES VERNE'S
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDSON.

496
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,434
- YEAH, BUT THINK OF THE PRESSURE.
- FORGET ABOUT IT.

497
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:34,267
YOU COULD DO IT.
YOU GOT IT IN YOUR BLOOD.

498
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:37,834
- JUST WRITE IT.
- OKAY.

499
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:21,667
- SHE GAVE ME HER NUMBER,
BUT AS SHE WAS WRITING IT OUT,

500
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:23,868
SHE GOES, "DON'T CALL ME
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS."

501
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:26,667
AND I SAID, "HOW COME?"
SHE SAID, "WELL, I'M GONNA--"

502
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,267
AH, I CAN'T
TAKE THIS ANYMORE!

503
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:30,834
WE ARE ALL ANIMALS.

504
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:33,234
ESTRAGON, YOU MUST
BE LIBERATED.

505
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:35,234
- <i>TAKE IT EASY.</i>
- <i>COME ON, DARLING.</i>

506
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:36,934
OUT OUT.

507
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,367
COME ON, OUT,
SWEETHEART.

508
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:44,934
<i>ESTRAGON, MY FRIEND,</i>
<i>YOU MUST BE LIBERATED.</i>

509
00:40:47,734 --> 00:40:49,167
<i>I'M OFFERING YOU FREEDOM</i>

510
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:52,267
<i>AND YOU GO BACK</i>
<i>INTO INCARCERATION.</i>

511
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:08,968
PHIL.

512
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:16,100
- THIS ONE, RIGHT?
- YEAH, MM-HMM.

513
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,567
LISTEN, LUCAS, I DIDN'T
BRING TOO MUCH CASH WITH ME.

514
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:20,400
CAN I BRING IT IN
TO YOU TOMORROW?

515
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,868
I HAVE A TIP
I CAN LEAVE YA.

516
00:41:22,868 --> 00:41:25,067
- YOU THINK IT'LL BE OKAY?
- YEAH, SURE.

517
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:27,501
- THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

518
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:33,300
HOW'S-- HOW'S
YOUR MOTHER DOING?

519
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,734
SHE'S DYING.

520
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:36,267
SHE MIGHT BE
ABLE TO COME HOME

521
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:37,834
FROM THE HOSPITAL
A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK,

522
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:39,434
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

523
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:41,267
HERE'S TO MOOTY.

524
00:41:41,267 --> 00:41:43,534
- MOOTY.
- HERE'S TO MOOTY.

525
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:52,067
MY BOY, YOU'RE MAKING
ONE VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE.

526
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:53,968
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE BEING FRIENDLY.

527
00:41:53,968 --> 00:41:56,000
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
- REMEMBER WHAT I SAY:

528
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,567
NEVER BE FRIENDLY
WITH A CUSTOMER.

529
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:00,334
BE FAMILIAR,
BUT NOT FRIENDLY.

530
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:03,000
FAMILIAR BUT NOT FRIENDLY.

531
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,868
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH FRIENDLY?

532
00:42:04,868 --> 00:42:06,868
SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU
LEAST EXPECT IT,

533
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:09,634
FRIENDSHIP WILL STAB YOU
IN THE BACK LIKE A DAGGER.

534
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:12,534
THE CUSTOMER WILL START TRUSTING
YOU, YOU'LL START TRUSTING THEM.

535
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:14,200
ONE THING WILL LEAD
TO ANOTHER

536
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,767
AND YOU DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN.

537
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,367
CAN I GET ONE
FOR THE ROAD?

538
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,534
NO, SORRY, ROGER.
WE'RE CLOSED.

539
00:42:20,534 --> 00:42:22,133
WAIT, JUST ONE FOR THE ROAD.
COME ON.

540
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:24,467
I THINK YOU'VE HAD
SEVEN FOR THE ROAD.

541
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:27,300
- THIS ONE IS FOR THE ROAD.
- WE'RE CLOSED.

542
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:30,934
DAMN IT.

543
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:36,801
OH, WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO HUMANITY THESE DAYS?

544
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,834
FUCK.

545
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:42,300
YOU'RE DOING
ALL RIGHT, LUCAS,

546
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,067
BUT YOU STILL GOT
A LOT TO LEARN.

547
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:45,467
WE GOTTA WORK
ON YOUR ATTITUDE.

548
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:48,300
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
A NATURAL WHEN IT COMES

549
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,868
TO HOSTILITY AND ARROGANCE.

550
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:53,834
BUT YOU KNOW,
GIVEN TIME IT'LL COME.

551
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:12,868
IT'S AMAZING

552
00:43:12,868 --> 00:43:17,267
HOW BROCCOLI ALWAYS
MAKES YOU FART.

553
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:21,067
IN A WAY, BROCCOLI
IS THE EMBODIMENT OF FART.

554
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:26,167
IF YOU COULD CAPTURE
A PIECE OF FART,

555
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:28,868
MATERIALIZE IT,

556
00:43:28,868 --> 00:43:32,667
I IMAGINE IT WOULD LOOK
PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS.

557
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:37,667
THE INCARNATION OF FART.

558
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,567
LUCAS, MY BOY...

559
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:55,367
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

560
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,534
HI.

561
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:35,601
THE BAR IS CLOSED.

562
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,234
OH...

563
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,601
HEY, DON'T CRY.

564
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:51,767
DON'T CRY.

565
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:55,400
UH, EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

566
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,634
HERE, HAVE A SEAT.

567
00:45:11,634 --> 00:45:13,834
LET ME GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

568
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:17,133
- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?
- CHAMPAGNE.

569
00:45:18,868 --> 00:45:21,634
- CHAMPAGNE?
- <i>YES, PLEASE.</i>

570
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:44,767
- HERE.
- THANK YOU.

571
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:54,601
MM.

572
00:45:59,868 --> 00:46:04,367
- ARE YOU A STEWARDESS?
- NO.

573
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:06,200
OH.

574
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,000
I JUST THOUGHT BECAUSE
OF THE OUTFIT...

575
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,767
- I GOT FIRED.
- WHY?

576
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:17,367
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID.

577
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:19,367
AFRAID OF WHAT?

578
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,434
I WAS AFRAID OF FLYING.

579
00:46:29,934 --> 00:46:34,267
WELL, IT'S NOT
IN OUR NATURE TO FLY.

580
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:36,901
SO I DON'T BLAME YOU.

581
00:46:38,901 --> 00:46:40,834
YOU ARE VERY KIND.

582
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:51,834
CAN I STAY
WITH YOU TONIGHT?

583
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:54,801
YOU MEAN LIKE--

584
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:57,534
I HAVE NO PLACE TO SLEEP
AND I'M VERY TIRED.

585
00:46:57,534 --> 00:47:02,334
UM...

586
00:47:02,334 --> 00:47:07,100
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
MAYBE NOT THE BEST IDEA.

587
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,701
OH, NO NO.

588
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,901
PLEASE, I AM SORRY.
I AM SORRY.

589
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:16,434
<i>DON'T CRY.</i>

590
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:28,234
BUT WE HAVE TO BE
VERY QUIET

591
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:32,100
AND VERY VERY
CAREFUL.

592
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,033
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- I LIVE HERE.

593
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:37,934
WOW.

594
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:40,634
MY BOSS
LIVES HERE TOO

595
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:44,033
AND HE'S NOT
THE KIND OF PERSON

596
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:46,033
YOU'D LIKE TO WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

597
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:49,033
I UNDERSTAND.

598
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,767
I'M SORRY.

599
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:57,667
<i>You will be at peace with yourself</i>

600
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,267
<i>and the people</i>
<i>around you.</i>

601
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:05,534
<i>I am going to wake you up</i>
<i>at the count of five.</i>

602
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:08,501
<i>One--</i>

603
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:12,033
<i>you feel yourself</i>
<i>awakening now,</i>

604
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:16,400
<i>filled with energy</i>
<i>and self-assurance.</i>

605
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,367
<i>Two-- you are</i>
<i>feeling good</i>

606
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:23,033
<i>and glad to be alive.</i>

607
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:26,400
<i>Three-- you are</i>
<i>awakening now, feeling...</i>

608
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:48,901
GOOD MORNING, JACQUES.
THIS IS APRIL.

609
00:48:48,901 --> 00:48:51,067
SHE HAD NO PLACE TO STAY
AND NO MONEY, SO--

610
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:53,534
I WANT THAT WHORE
OUT OF MY HOUSE IMMEDIATELY

611
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:55,934
AND I NEVER WANT
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

612
00:49:00,734 --> 00:49:03,834
- DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE
JUST CALLED ME? - YES.

613
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,200
CHAMPAGNE IS NOT FOR
WETTING PUSSIES, YOU KNOW.

614
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,667
IT'S FOR CELEBRATING
MAJOR VICTORIES IN SPORTS.

615
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:15,133
LISTEN TO ME.

616
00:49:15,133 --> 00:49:16,868
THERE ARE TWO WORLDS--

617
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:18,701
THE WORLD OF MAN
AND THE WORLD OF THE BITCH.

618
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:20,567
A BAR IS NO PLACE
FOR A WOMAN.

619
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:22,267
THEY HAVE THE CAFETERIAS
AND THE PATISSERIES.

620
00:49:22,267 --> 00:49:23,968
THE BAR IS OUR SPACE.

621
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:27,033
IT'S A SANCTUARY WHERE MAN
CAN COME AND BE FREE

622
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:29,234
KNOWING THAT HE'S
PERFECTLY PROTECTED

623
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:31,467
FROM ANY INTERFERENCE
OF THE FEMININE.

624
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:33,968
BUT SHE'S GOT NO MONEY
AND NO PLACE TO STAY.

625
00:49:33,968 --> 00:49:36,534
WELL, THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM
AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T MINE.

626
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:40,033
- WE CAN'T JUST THROW HER OUT ON THE
STREET LIKE GARBAGE. - YES, WE CAN.

627
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:42,434
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE?

628
00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:44,234
OH, JESUS CHRIST, LUCAS.
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

629
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:46,067
I AM JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL!

630
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:49,334
WE GOT EVERYTHING.
SHE'S GOT NOTHING.

631
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:51,534
WE CAN HELP HER.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

632
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:01,100
24 HOURS.

633
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,734
<i>YOU'VE GOT 24 HOURS</i>
<i>TO GET RID OF THE BITCH.</i>

634
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:19,167
SO HOW ARE YOU
FEELING THESE DAYS?

635
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:21,601
DOUBT, FEAR,

636
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,968
PAIN, ANXIETY,

637
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:27,834
DISTRACTION,
NERVOUSNESS,

638
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:31,033
HORROR, FRIGHT,
PANIC, DREAD,

639
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:34,267
TERROR, TREPIDATION.

640
00:50:34,267 --> 00:50:36,667
I FEEL LIKE
A GODDAMN THESAURUS.

641
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,667
COME ON, ESTRAGON,
EAT THOSE HERBS.

642
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,367
THEY'RE GOOD FOR YOU.

643
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:43,634
LOOKS GOOD.

644
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:58,367
WHERE IS YOUR LADY ROOM?

645
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:00,634
NO LADY ROOM.

646
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,934
ESTRAGON?

647
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,367
WHERE'S ESTRAGON?

648
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,734
<i>ESTRAGON!</i>

649
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:35,934
COME ON.
SHH.

650
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:39,000
<i>I LOVE FLOWERS.</i> - Roddie: <i>YEAH?
YOU SHOULD COME BY SOMETIME.</i>

651
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,701
- <i>YES.</i>
- <i>YEAH.</i>

652
00:51:41,701 --> 00:51:43,634
YOU NEED A LIGHTER?

653
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:48,400
IT APPEARS OUR BOY RODDIE
IS HAVING A HARD TIME

654
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,534
GETTING HIS FLAME UP.

655
00:51:50,534 --> 00:51:54,601
WOMEN CAN SEEM CUTE
AND CHARMING ON THE SURFACE.

656
00:51:54,601 --> 00:51:57,934
BUT UNDERNEATH THEY'RE
THE SAME UNIVERSAL BITCH.

657
00:51:57,934 --> 00:52:00,200
YEAH, FUCK YOU.
YOU LITTLE SISSY-BOY, HUH?

658
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,901
- FUCK YOU! YOU COME AND YOU WHINE!
- WHOA WHOA WHOA.

659
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,200
- <i>COME ON, FLOWER BOY!</i>
- <i>DAMN IT, YOU FUCKING WHORE.</i>

660
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,968
I'M NOT A WHORE!
I'M A STIMULATOR!

661
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,934
LUCAS.

662
00:52:35,934 --> 00:52:38,434
<i>COME OVER HERE</i>
<i>FOR A SECOND.</i>

663
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:43,234
I'VE GOT A THERAPY
CLASS AT 9:30.

664
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:46,167
AND WHEN I GET BACK,
SHE'S HISTORY, OKAY?

665
00:53:05,634 --> 00:53:07,968
- <i>APRIL.</i>
- YES?

666
00:53:07,968 --> 00:53:10,634
I WAS THINKING
IT'S BEEN NICE

667
00:53:10,634 --> 00:53:12,200
HAVING YOU
AND EVERYTHING.

668
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,133
OH, THANK YOU.

669
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:16,267
I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE.

670
00:53:38,267 --> 00:53:40,834
IS THAT ALL
YOU WANTED TO SAY?

671
00:53:42,067 --> 00:53:44,501
YES.

672
00:53:44,501 --> 00:53:46,434
I GUESS SO.

673
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:50,300
BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE

674
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
YOU WANT TO
TELL ME SOMETHING--

675
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,234
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

676
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,501
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

677
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,234
HERE.

678
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:06,567
TAKE THIS MONEY.

679
00:54:06,567 --> 00:54:08,801
<i>IT'S A BIT FROZEN</i>
<i>AT THE MOMENT.</i>

680
00:54:08,801 --> 00:54:11,100
BUT WHEN IT MELTS,
IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO GET YOU BACK.

681
00:54:12,968 --> 00:54:15,000
I'M SORRY.

682
00:54:21,934 --> 00:54:23,501
<i>TAKE A NICE DEEP BREATH</i>

683
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:25,267
<i>AND GO TO THE CENTER</i>
<i>AND LET IT OUT.</i>

684
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:29,100
WHOOOA!

685
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,601
THEN GO BACK. OOH.

686
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,601
* HA HA HO HO HO

687
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:35,567
* HA HA HO HO HO

688
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:39,367
* HA HA HO HO HO,
HA HA HO HO HO *

689
00:54:39,367 --> 00:54:43,167
* HA HA HO HO HO,
HA HA HO HO HO... *

690
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:52,067
BAD GUY.

691
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:25,701
LET'S GET MARRIED.

692
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,634
- MARRIED?
- <i>YES.</i>

693
00:55:31,634 --> 00:55:35,767
BUT WOULDN'T WE BE MOVING
A LITTLE BIT FAST?

694
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,701
YES.

695
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:44,567
PLEASE, LUCAS,
DON'T SEND ME BACK.

696
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:46,501
PLEASE PLEASE.

697
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,300
THIS IS A BIG RELIEF
FOR ME, LUCAS.

698
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,767
<i>YOU KNOW, THE BITCH EPISODE</i>
<i>WAS NOT SUCH A BAD THING.</i>

699
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:17,000
<i>IT MADE</i>
<i>THE ALARM BELLS RING</i>

700
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,634
AND IT ALLOWS US
TO BE MORE ALERT FROM...

701
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:25,167
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

702
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:29,167
<i>DID SOMEBODY</i>
<i>WIN SOMETHING?</i>

703
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:32,534
DID I MISS SOMETHING
IN THE WORLD OF SPORTS?

704
00:56:32,534 --> 00:56:34,100
WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON, LUCAS?

705
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:40,133
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

706
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:46,534
LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT:

707
00:56:46,534 --> 00:56:48,801
<i>I ASK YOU TO</i>
<i>KICK OUT THE BITCH</i>

708
00:56:48,801 --> 00:56:50,868
<i>AND I LEAVE YOU ALONE</i>
<i>FOR SIX QUARTERS OF AN HOUR.</i>

709
00:56:50,868 --> 00:56:52,367
AND WHEN I GET BACK,

710
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:56,167
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
TO THE BITCH?

711
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:58,501
WOULD THAT BE A FAIRLY ACCURATE
ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS?

712
00:56:58,501 --> 00:57:02,000
I GUESS SO.

713
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,234
<i>DO I HAVE TO WATCH</i>
<i>YOUR EVERY FUCKING STEP?</i>

714
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:06,734
THIS IS MY WORSE NIGHTMARE
COME TRUE.FUCK!

715
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:09,434
<i>I SHOULD'VE BEEN MORE CAREFUL.</i>
<i>I SHOULD'VE PREVENTED THIS.</i>

716
00:57:09,434 --> 00:57:11,100
<i>JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!</i>

717
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,467
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
STICK TO OUR PLAN?

718
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:17,501
WHAT PLAN?

719
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:20,067
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
ENRIQUE'S DAUGHTER?

720
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:23,234
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH HER.

721
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:25,067
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

722
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,234
YOU WERE GONNA MARRY HER.

723
00:57:27,234 --> 00:57:28,934
YOU'RE CRAZY.

724
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:31,868
SHE'S NINE YEARS OLD.
I NEVER SAID THAT.

725
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:33,567
WE MADE A DEAL,
YOU UNGRATEFUL SON OF A BITCH.

726
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:35,067
I PUT ALL MY BETS
ON YOU, LUCAS.

727
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:37,367
<i>JESUS, MY WORLD</i>
<i>IS FALLING APART.</i>

728
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:39,267
YOU'RE CRAZY.

729
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:43,434
I WORK LIKE A SLEDGEHAMMER
IN HELL FOR YOUR FUCKING BAR.

730
00:57:43,434 --> 00:57:45,767
YOU KEEP ME HERE
LIKE A PRISONER.

731
00:57:45,767 --> 00:57:48,934
<i>IF SHE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS</i>
<i>PLACE, THEN I'M OUT OF HERE TOO.</i>

732
00:57:48,934 --> 00:57:50,467
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- <i>YES, I CAN.</i>

733
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,567
- NO, YOU CAN'T.
- YES, I CAN.

734
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:55,033
JUST TAKE A LOOK,
JACQUES.

735
00:59:33,868 --> 00:59:35,367
I'LL GET IT FRESH.

736
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:37,367
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

737
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:38,934
PSST.

738
00:59:53,834 --> 00:59:56,901
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JACQUES!

739
01:00:02,901 --> 01:00:05,834
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
- IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

740
01:00:05,834 --> 01:00:07,901
- I DON'T DO BIRTHDAYS.
- WE BAKED THE CAKE FOR YOU.

741
01:00:07,901 --> 01:00:09,534
<i>I DON'T GIVE A FUCK</i>
<i>WHAT YOU BAKED.</i>

742
01:00:09,534 --> 01:00:11,701
YOU CAN TAKE THAT AND GET IT
OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?

743
01:00:11,701 --> 01:00:14,334
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HEAR HEAR!
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JACQUES.

744
01:00:14,334 --> 01:00:17,200
LISTEN, YOU FUCKING BUNCH
OF "ANIMALOGICAL" FREAKS,

745
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,734
I DON'T WANT
A FUCKING BIRTHDAY CAKE

746
01:00:18,734 --> 01:00:20,267
AND I DON'T WANT
A FUCKING BIRTHDAY!

747
01:00:20,267 --> 01:00:22,234
SO TAKE THIS FUCKING THING
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

748
01:00:22,234 --> 01:00:25,434
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!

749
01:00:25,434 --> 01:00:27,467
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
GET THE FUCK OUT!

750
01:00:27,467 --> 01:00:29,968
OUT OUT! ALL OF YOU, NOW.

751
01:00:29,968 --> 01:00:32,300
GO! DO YOU HEAR ME?
GET THE FUCK OUT!

752
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,300
DON'T ANY OF YOU FUCKING
UNDERSTAND FUCKING ENGLISH?

753
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,734
- GO, FUCK OUT!
- FUCKING CRAZY.

754
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:41,133
I TOLD YOU SCHMUCKS,
I DON'T DO BIRTHDAYS, OKAY?

755
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:43,400
NOW YOU'RE BANNED,
ALL OF YOU, FOR A WEEK!

756
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- FOR A FUCKING CAKE.

757
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:48,701
FOR A FUCKING CAKE
HE BANS US.

758
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:36,667
OKAY.

759
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:40,033
I'M-- I'M WILLING
TO COMPROMISE,

760
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:41,601
ALTHOUGH I HATE
COMPROMISE

761
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:43,267
MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE IN THE WORLD.

762
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:44,868
BUT WHAT ELSE
CAN I DO?

763
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,501
YOU STABBED ME
IN THE BACK, LUCAS.

764
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:48,133
YOU'RE KICKING ME
WHEN I'M LYING DOWN

765
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:49,934
AND IN NO POSITION
TO DEFEND MYSELF.

766
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:53,334
I WAS BEGINNING
TO LIKE YOU, LUCAS.

767
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,634
I MADE THE FATAL MISTAKE
OF TRUSTING YOU.

768
01:01:55,634 --> 01:01:58,167
<i>WHAT DO I GET?</i>
<i>BAFF.</i>

769
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:01,067
AS SOON AS I SHOW A TINY
SPOT OF VULNERABILITY,

770
01:02:01,067 --> 01:02:03,834
YOU ATTACK ME.

771
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:07,100
YOU'RE A TRAITOR, LUCAS--
A FUCKING TRAITOR.

772
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,367
AND NOW I'M LYING HERE CLOSER
TO DEATH THAN EVER BEFORE

773
01:02:12,367 --> 01:02:15,501
AND FROM THAT HOPELESS
POSITION I HAVE TO NEGOTIATE.

774
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:22,434
OKAY, THE BITCH CAN STAY.

775
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:27,501
<i>I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT,</i>
<i>BUT YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.</i>

776
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:29,801
I HAVE TO KEEP
THE BUSINESS GOING.

777
01:02:29,801 --> 01:02:33,801
AND IF THIS IS THE PRICE,
THEN THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

778
01:02:33,801 --> 01:02:35,767
IF YOU REALLY HAVE IT IN YOU
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

779
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:38,634
OF MY HOPELESS CONDITION,
THEN GO AHEAD.

780
01:02:55,767 --> 01:02:59,100
BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME
BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

781
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,434
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

782
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,334
THANK YOU.

783
01:04:57,567 --> 01:04:59,234
IT SHOULDN'T COME
AS A SURPRISE

784
01:04:59,234 --> 01:05:01,033
THAT YOUR HEART IS CLOSE
TO USELESS BY NOW.

785
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:03,000
SO WHAT I'M INTERESTED
IN DOING IS PUTTING YOU

786
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,734
ON A WAITING LIST
FOR A HEART TRANSPLANT.

787
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,367
WHOA WHOA WHOA.

788
01:05:06,367 --> 01:05:08,400
WAITING LIST?

789
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,267
SOUNDS BAD.
I HATE WAITING.

790
01:05:12,801 --> 01:05:14,968
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

791
01:05:14,968 --> 01:05:16,534
THERE'S A REASON
WE CALL YOU A PATIENT

792
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:18,334
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

793
01:05:18,334 --> 01:05:20,801
HA HA HA.
VERY FUNNY.

794
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:22,868
A POSITIVE ATTITUDE
WOULD REALLY HELP A LOT

795
01:05:22,868 --> 01:05:24,868
WITH GETTING YOU THROUGH
ALL THIS WAITING.

796
01:05:24,868 --> 01:05:27,734
AND IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE YOUR
CHANCES OF SURVIVING A TRANSPLANT.

797
01:05:27,734 --> 01:05:30,868
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
YOU HAVE TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE.

798
01:05:30,868 --> 01:05:32,701
OKAY?
YOU CAN NEVER DRINK OR SMOKE AGAIN.

799
01:05:32,701 --> 01:05:36,067
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, DOC,
SEND ME BACK TO KINDERGARTEN?

800
01:05:36,067 --> 01:05:38,934
YOU GOTTA REALIZE I'M A DIRTY
OLD BASTARD WITH FILTHY HABITS.

801
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:42,267
A NEW HEART
IS A PRECIOUS GIFT

802
01:05:42,267 --> 01:05:44,000
AND WE ONLY
GIVE THEM TO THOSE

803
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,400
WHO ARE GOING TO TREAT THEIR
GIFT WITH RESPECT AND CARE.

804
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,734
I DON'T LIKE THE PATRONIZING
TONE OF YOUR VOICE.

805
01:05:48,734 --> 01:05:51,100
TO BE FRANK, I DON'T LIKE
YOUR ATTITUDE AT ALL.

806
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:55,234
SOMEONE IS GONNA DIE SO YOU
CAN LIVE. DO YOU GET THAT?

807
01:06:01,534 --> 01:06:05,100
YEAH, I GET IT.

808
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:09,234
- NOW DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT YOU
ON THE LIST OR NOT? - YES, PLEASE.

809
01:06:09,234 --> 01:06:12,167
- AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IMPLIES?
- YES, DOC.

810
01:06:37,634 --> 01:06:39,567
JACQUES, YOU OKAY?

811
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:57,767
HERE.

812
01:06:57,767 --> 01:06:59,701
TAKE A LOOK.

813
01:07:02,334 --> 01:07:05,267
THE DOCTOR GAVE ME
THIS PHONE.

814
01:07:05,267 --> 01:07:09,000
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON ON
EARTH WHO HAS THIS NUMBER.

815
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,267
WHEN IT RINGS IT CAN
ONLY MEAN ONE THING:

816
01:07:12,267 --> 01:07:15,767
THAT A NEW HEART
HAS ARRIVED.

817
01:07:15,767 --> 01:07:18,467
SO WHEN
THE CALL COMES,

818
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,501
I HAVE TO BE AT THE
HOSPITAL WITHIN 20 MINUTES.

819
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:23,033
THAT MEANS I MUST BE
READY AT ALL TIMES--

820
01:07:23,033 --> 01:07:25,033
THE SUITCASE PACKED,
READY TO GO.

821
01:07:26,534 --> 01:07:29,133
JUST LIKE THAT.

822
01:07:49,467 --> 01:07:51,234
HI.

823
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

824
01:08:07,067 --> 01:08:09,367
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

825
01:08:18,734 --> 01:08:21,133
JACQUES, LET ME EXPLAIN.

826
01:08:22,834 --> 01:08:24,434
JACQUES, I'M SORRY.

827
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,434
JACQUES, I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU...

828
01:08:26,434 --> 01:08:28,367
WE JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR BUSINESS

829
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:30,167
TO INCORPORATE
THE DINING HALL.

830
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:32,667
WE CAN EASILY MANAGE IT
NOW THAT WE ARE THREE.

831
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:34,868
YOU HAVE NOT
UNDERSTOOD A THING.

832
01:08:34,868 --> 01:08:37,834
THIS IS NOT A CAFE.
THIS IS NOT A RESTAURANT.

833
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:41,400
THIS IS NOT A BISTRO,
NOR IS THIS A BRASSERIE. THIS IS A BAR.

834
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,901
AND BY DEFINITION,
THE CAPACITY OF A BAR

835
01:08:43,901 --> 01:08:46,033
CANNOT EXCEED 13 PEOPLE.

836
01:08:46,033 --> 01:08:48,467
- THINK JESUS AND HIS APOSTLES.
- I'M SORRY.

837
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:51,534
LUCAS, YOU MUST
CONTROL THAT BITCH.

838
01:08:51,534 --> 01:08:53,634
JUST KEEP HER
OUT OF MY FACE.

839
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,968
- SO HOW WAS YOUR DATE LAST NIGHT?
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

840
01:09:21,968 --> 01:09:24,968
I CAN'T GET ANYTHING GOING.
I-- I CAN'T EVEN...

841
01:09:24,968 --> 01:09:26,968
IT'S HARD ENOUGH
MEETING WOMEN.

842
01:09:26,968 --> 01:09:30,234
COME ON, RODDIE, YOU OWN A
FLOWER SHOP, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

843
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:32,000
THAT'S A PRIME
POSITION TO BE IN.

844
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,601
NO, SEE, EVERYBODY THINKS THAT.
IT DOESN'T WORK

845
01:09:33,601 --> 01:09:36,801
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE COMING
INTO THE SHOP-- WOMEN--

846
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:39,234
THEY'RE BUYING FLOWERS
FOR EITHER THEIR BOYFRIENDS

847
01:09:39,234 --> 01:09:40,801
OR THEIR HUSBANDS.

848
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,501
SO, YOU KNOW,
ME HITTING ON THEM

849
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:44,734
WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT
IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

850
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:47,067
AND THEN WHEN I DO GO ON A
DATE AND I BRING THEM FLOWERS

851
01:09:47,067 --> 01:09:49,434
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY KNOW
THAT I OWN A FLOWER SHOP,

852
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:52,033
ANYTHING I BRING THEM
IS JUST NOT IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH.

853
01:09:52,033 --> 01:09:53,701
FORGET THE FUCKING FLOWERS,
ALL RIGHT?

854
01:09:53,701 --> 01:09:55,367
YOU'VE GOTTA FIND
A NEW GROOVE.

855
01:09:55,367 --> 01:09:57,367
<i>YEAH,
IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.</i>

856
01:09:57,367 --> 01:10:01,300
- <i>YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL.</i>
- <i>JUST TALK TO HER, RODDIE.</i>

857
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,334
APRIL...

858
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:07,067
UH, WHAT DO YOU
USUALLY DO AFTER WORK?

859
01:10:12,467 --> 01:10:16,767
SHE'S SURE GOT THE BITCH
ELEMENT DOWN TO A SCIENCE.

860
01:10:16,767 --> 01:10:19,200
YOU SHOULD BE TAKING
NOTES HERE, LUCAS.

861
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,801
<i>YOU NEED TO BE MORE OF A BITCH</i>
<i>YOURSELF. YOU'RE TOO NICE.</i>

862
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:25,567
YOU SEE, WE'RE NOT
HERE TO SAVE PEOPLE;

863
01:10:25,567 --> 01:10:29,534
WE'RE HERE
TO DESTROY THEM.

864
01:10:29,534 --> 01:10:34,133
<i>SCHNEKE,</i> I BELIEVE YOU
HAVESOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO ME.

865
01:10:34,133 --> 01:10:37,467
- WHAT IS IT?
- MY BREATH. YOU TOOK IT AWAY.

866
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:40,567
<i>I CAN'T BREATHE WHEN I SEE YOU.</i>

867
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:43,000
MY HEART STARTS TO RACE.

868
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,501
CAN YOU FEEL IT
GO PITTER-PATTER?

869
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:51,033
- I WAS JUST TALKING TO HER!
- GET OUT.

870
01:10:51,033 --> 01:10:54,100
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE
AND DON'T COME BACK.

871
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:20,534
ROGER.

872
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:35,167
WHERE'S APRIL?

873
01:11:36,934 --> 01:11:38,467
SHE LEFT.

874
01:11:41,234 --> 01:11:43,234
THE BAR IS NO PLACE
FOR A WOMAN--

875
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:44,701
YOU WERE RIGHT
ON THAT ONE.

876
01:11:49,968 --> 01:11:53,934
APRIL WAS MORE OF A MAN
THAN MOST OF THE SISSIES
THAT HANG AROUND HERE.

877
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:56,200
SO YOU LIKED HER?

878
01:11:58,968 --> 01:12:01,767
I DIDN'T COMPLETELY
DISLIKE HER.

879
01:12:09,634 --> 01:12:12,667
LUCAS, GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE.

880
01:12:14,434 --> 01:12:17,734
- WHERE'S APRIL?
- SHE'S GONE.

881
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:19,400
IT'S A DAMN SHAME.

882
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,234
THERE USED TO BE
SPARKS AROUND HER.

883
01:12:21,234 --> 01:12:23,767
PSSH,
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

884
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:28,267
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HEY, WHOA.

885
01:12:28,267 --> 01:12:29,734
THERE'S SOME
SPARKS FOR YOU.

886
01:12:35,334 --> 01:12:36,801
HERE'S TO YOU MORONS.

887
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,801
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
- I DON'T KNOW.

888
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,200
LEAVE ME ALONE, JACQUES.

889
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,167
LET'S GO FOR A SPIN,
LEAVE THIS CITY FOR A WHILE.

890
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:59,300
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- <i>YOU LOOK MISERABLE.</i>

891
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,601
<i>YOU NEED TO CHEER UP.</i>

892
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:11,567
A JUNKYARD?

893
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:14,067
HOW UPLIFTING.

894
01:13:14,067 --> 01:13:16,767
YOU'RE WASTING
MY TIME, JACQUES.

895
01:13:26,501 --> 01:13:30,167
<i>I ALWAYS
DREAMED OF DOING THIS.</i>

896
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:33,400
LIFE'S TOO SHORT
FOR LOUSY CARS.

897
01:15:44,601 --> 01:15:47,200
JACQUES, I'M VERY SORRY.
IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.

898
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,634
NO HEART?

899
01:15:50,634 --> 01:15:53,334
NO, WE GOT THE HEART,
BUT IT WAS NO GOOD.

900
01:15:53,334 --> 01:15:55,200
IT HAPPENS VERY RARELY,
BUT IT DOES HAPPEN.

901
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,000
THE HEART WAS NO GOOD.

902
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,968
YOU MEAN YOU SCARED THE
SHIT OUT OF ME FOR NOTHING?

903
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:02,000
<i>I SHIT MY PANTS</i>
<i>BECAUSE OF THIS.</i>

904
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,834
- <i>HEART RATE: 140.</i>
- OKAY, CHECK HIS BLOOD PRESSURE.

905
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:09,968
JACQUES, CAN YOU BREATHE?

906
01:16:09,968 --> 01:16:12,400
CAN YOU BREATHE DEEPLY?
TAKE DEEP BREATHS. -

907
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,367
BLOOD PRESSURE
HAS FALLEN TO 70/40.

908
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:17,901
LET'S GIVE HIM 2mg
OF METOPROLOL, I.V.

909
01:16:17,901 --> 01:16:20,033
JACQUES, LISTEN TO ME.
CAN YOU LIFT YOUR HEAD?

910
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:23,567
CAN YOU LIFT YOUR HEAD?

911
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:26,634
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP YOU HERE.

912
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:33,601
HERE YOU GO.

913
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,567
- WHAT IS THIS?
- <i>WELL, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.</i>

914
01:16:39,567 --> 01:16:42,234
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
A FUCKING HAMSTER?

915
01:16:42,234 --> 01:16:43,934
HEY.

916
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:46,534
I DON'T THINK
WE'VE BEEN INTRODUCED.

917
01:16:46,534 --> 01:16:49,067
MY NAME'S BEN. I'M YOUR NEW
ROOMMATE. NICE TO MEET YOU.

918
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:51,067
JACQUES.

919
01:16:51,067 --> 01:16:53,033
WHAT BLOOD TYPE ARE YOU?

920
01:16:53,033 --> 01:16:55,434
- O.
- <i>O'S GOOD.</i>

921
01:16:55,434 --> 01:16:58,767
- NO THREAT IN O.
- WHAT BLOOD TYPE ARE YOU?

922
01:16:58,767 --> 01:17:00,834
FUCKIN' "A."

923
01:17:36,133 --> 01:17:39,067
<i>* CHRISTMAS BELLS</i>

924
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:41,734
<i>* CHRISTMAS BELLS</i>

925
01:17:41,734 --> 01:17:47,567
<i>* RINGING LOUD AND STRONG</i>

926
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:50,300
<i>* FOLLOW THEM</i>

927
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,667
<i>* FOLLOW THEM</i>

928
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:57,133
<i>* YOU'VE BEEN AWAY</i>
<i>TOO LONG *</i>

929
01:17:57,133 --> 01:18:03,067
<i>* THERE IS NO CHRISTMAS</i>

930
01:18:03,067 --> 01:18:09,100
<i>* LIKE A HOME CHRISTMAS</i>

931
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,667
<i>* THAT'S THE TIME OF YEAR *</i>

932
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:18,367
<i>* ALL ROADS LEAD HOME.</i>

933
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,868
<i>THROUGHOUT THESE EXHAUSTING</i>
<i>MONTHS OF DOUBT AND PAIN,</i>

934
01:18:21,868 --> 01:18:25,968
MY ONLY CONSOLATION
HAS BEEN VISUALIZING

935
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:28,934
THAT DUCK
SERVED ON A PLATE.

936
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:44,234
HANG ON THERE, LUCAS.

937
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:47,734
<i>LOWER THE BLADE</i>
<i>FOR A SEC.</i>

938
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:54,200
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

939
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,968
WHAT WOULD
YOU BUDDHA PEOPLE EAT?

940
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,300
<i>SAY DURING</i>
<i>THE FESTIVAL OF VESAK.</i>

941
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,300
DUCK, PERSONALLY.

942
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,801
I THOUGHT BUDDHISM
AND VEGETARIANISM

943
01:19:04,801 --> 01:19:06,467
WENT HAND IN HAND.

944
01:19:06,467 --> 01:19:08,968
I MEAN, THE FIRST
PRECEPT OF BUDDHISM

945
01:19:08,968 --> 01:19:12,200
IS TO AVOID KILLING
OR HARMING ANY LIVING BEING.

946
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,334
SO HOW CAN YOU RECONCILE THAT
WITH EATING MEAT?

947
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:17,901
ACTUALLY,
THE BUDDHA HIMSELF ATE MEAT

948
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:20,601
<i>AND WAS THEREFORE</i>
<i>NOT A VEGETARIAN.</i>

949
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:24,534
IN FACT, IT IS THOUGHT THAT
HE DIED FROM FOOD POISONING

950
01:19:24,534 --> 01:19:26,567
AFTER EATING ROTTEN PORK.

951
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:29,767
<i>HOWEVER,</i>
<i>HE ADVISED THAT MEAT</i>

952
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:31,901
<i>SHOULD ONLY BE EATEN</i>

953
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:35,167
WHEN IT WAS NOT SEEN,
HEARD, OR SUSPECTED

954
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,033
THAT THE ANIMAL
HAD BEEN KILLED

955
01:19:37,033 --> 01:19:38,834
SPECIFICALLY FOR
THE PURPOSE OF EATING.

956
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:40,501
<i>LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES</i>
<i>TO DEATH HERE.</i>

957
01:19:40,501 --> 01:19:43,067
I MEAN, THE MEAT YOU EAT
IS OBVIOUSLY FROM ANIMALS

958
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:45,200
BUTCHERED FOR
THE PURPOSE OF EATING.

959
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,934
SO YOU'RE BREAKING THE FIRST
PRECEPT WITH EVERY BITE YOU CHEW.

960
01:19:47,934 --> 01:19:52,434
AS I SEE IT,
I'M NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED

961
01:19:52,434 --> 01:19:54,067
IN THE KILLING
OF THE ANIMAL.

962
01:19:54,067 --> 01:19:56,300
OH.

963
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,534
SO YOU FOUND THE MEAT
AT THE BUTCHER'S.

964
01:19:58,534 --> 01:20:01,100
<i>YOU DIDN'T SEE</i>
<i>NO ANIMAL BEING KILLED</i>

965
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,534
AND YOU DON'T SUSPECT
THAT THE BUTCHER

966
01:20:03,534 --> 01:20:05,801
KILLED AN ANIMAL
FOR THE PURPOSE OF EATING.

967
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,067
KIND OF.

968
01:20:08,067 --> 01:20:10,634
YOU BUDDHA MONKEYS REALLY
OUGHT TO GET YOUR STORY STRAIGHT.

969
01:20:10,634 --> 01:20:13,200
- THIS IS FUCKING NONSENSE.
- CAN I KILL IT NOW?

970
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,300
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

971
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:19,534
<i>I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>EATING AN ANIMAL TONIGHT.</i>

972
01:20:19,534 --> 01:20:23,767
CAN'T YOU PREPARE
SOMETHING WITHOUT A FACE?

973
01:20:23,767 --> 01:20:25,834
LIKE AN OCTOPUS
OR SOMETHING?

974
01:20:34,901 --> 01:20:38,501
- YOU'RE BECOMING A SISSY, JACQUES.
- <i>I KNOW, I KNOW.</i>

975
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:41,100
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

976
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:45,501
I'VE BECOME ALL SENSITIVE
AND SENTIMENTAL LATELY.

977
01:20:45,501 --> 01:20:49,667
<i>WOW, THAT LOOKS WONDERFUL.</i>

978
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:54,567
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.
- MERRY CHRISTMAS, JACQUES.

979
01:20:54,567 --> 01:20:56,634
WILL I SEE YOU
TOMORROW?

980
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:58,701
NO, I'M ONLY ALLOWED OUT
FOR CHRISTMAS.

981
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:01,334
I HAVE TO BE BACK AT THE
HOSPITAL BY MIDNIGHT.

982
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:02,934
HAH, LIKE CINDERELLA.

983
01:21:34,501 --> 01:21:37,901
YOU KNOW, TONIGHT
I'VE BEEN GIVING

984
01:21:37,901 --> 01:21:39,601
LOTS OF THOUGHT
TO SOMETHING.

985
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:44,400
WHAT IS IT, JACQUES?

986
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,334
LET'S SELL THE BAR.

987
01:21:48,133 --> 01:21:51,067
SELL IT?

988
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:52,701
WHY?

989
01:21:52,701 --> 01:21:56,000
WELL, AS YOU INTELLIGENTLY
POINTED OUT EARLIER,

990
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,133
I HAVE BECOME A BIT
OF A SISSY LATELY.

991
01:21:59,133 --> 01:22:02,400
WELL, I WAS
ONLY JOKING, JACQUES.

992
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,200
- DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
- NO NO, BUT IT'S TRUE.

993
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,200
SINCE I GOT
THE FALSE HEART,

994
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,467
SOMETHING CHANGED IN ME.

995
01:22:13,067 --> 01:22:15,267
I BECAME A SISSY.

996
01:22:15,267 --> 01:22:17,767
IT'S JUST A TEMPORARY THING,
YOU KNOW.

997
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:19,701
YOU'RE A BIT WEAK
AT THE MOMENT.

998
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:21,434
YOU'LL BE BACK
ON YOUR FEET IN NO TIME,

999
01:22:21,434 --> 01:22:23,367
INSULTING PEOPLE
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW.

1000
01:22:23,367 --> 01:22:26,667
WELL, THANKS FOR THE
ENCOURAGEMENT, BUT I'M NOT SO SURE.

1001
01:22:28,501 --> 01:22:30,501
YOU SEE, LUCAS...

1002
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,234
I'VE WITNESSED
A CHANGE IN YOU TOO.

1003
01:22:36,634 --> 01:22:38,133
<i>I MEAN,</i>
<i>YOU USED TO BE</i>

1004
01:22:38,133 --> 01:22:41,868
<i>SO OPEN-HEARTED</i>
<i>AND KIND--</i>

1005
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:44,701
HOPELESSLY KIND
WHEN IT COMES

1006
01:22:44,701 --> 01:22:47,801
TO THIS TYPE OF WORK.

1007
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:50,434
BUT SINCE APRIL LEFT,

1008
01:22:50,434 --> 01:22:54,234
<i>YOU'VE BECOME</i>
<i>BITTER AND COLD,</i>

1009
01:22:54,234 --> 01:22:56,234
<i>AGGRESSIVE EVEN.</i>

1010
01:22:56,234 --> 01:22:58,167
AND...

1011
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,567
IT JUST MAKES ME SAD.

1012
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:14,434
DON'T BE SAD, JACQUES.

1013
01:23:14,434 --> 01:23:17,067
IT'S MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,
YOU KNOW.

1014
01:23:17,067 --> 01:23:19,100
<i>BUT IT'S A FAILED</i>
<i>MISSION, LUCAS.</i>

1015
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:22,834
I DON'T WISH FOR YOU
TO COPY MY FATE.

1016
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:24,901
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BECOME
BITTER AND COLD.

1017
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,133
<i>LIFE'S TOO SHORT</i>
<i>FOR THAT.</i>

1018
01:23:29,133 --> 01:23:32,300
I THINK WE SHOULD
THROW IN THE TOWEL,

1019
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,567
LOOK OURSELVES IN THE EYES,
AND ADMIT THAT WE FAILED.

1020
01:23:37,567 --> 01:23:40,067
<i>LET'S GET RID</i>
<i>OF THE FUCKIN' PLACE.</i>

1021
01:23:40,067 --> 01:23:42,100
<i>WE'LL SPLIT IT 50/50.</i>

1022
01:23:43,968 --> 01:23:47,133
I WANT TO SPEND
THE LAST DAYS OF MY LIFE

1023
01:23:47,133 --> 01:23:50,267
IN A BETTER PLACE
THAN THIS SHITHOLE.

1024
01:23:52,467 --> 01:23:55,200
YOU GO AHEAD,
BUT I DON'T WANT ANY OF IT.

1025
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,200
YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING.

1026
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,601
I CAME HERE TO HELP.

1027
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:03,100
AND I'M SORRY
THAT I LET YOU DOWN--

1028
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,334
YOU AND APRIL.

1029
01:24:05,334 --> 01:24:07,267
NO.

1030
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,033
YOU OWN HALF OF EVERYTHING

1031
01:24:12,033 --> 01:24:14,100
<i>AND THE REMAINING HALF</i>

1032
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,968
<i>GOES TO ENRIQUE</i>
<i>AND JOSEPHINE.</i>

1033
01:25:26,467 --> 01:25:29,901
YOU'RE BACK.

1034
01:25:29,901 --> 01:25:32,968
YOU'RE BACK.

1035
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:51,934
AH, THIS IS
A FANTASTIC CHOICE.

1036
01:25:51,934 --> 01:25:54,467
HERE IS TO
"AVRIL" THE GREAT.

1037
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,234
<i>HEY, LUCAS.</i>

1038
01:26:24,634 --> 01:26:27,801
I THINK I NEED TO GO
BACK TO MY ROOM.

1039
01:26:27,801 --> 01:26:29,601
OKAY.

1040
01:26:38,434 --> 01:26:42,234
CAN YOU DEFINE THE PAIN
ON A SCALE OF 0-10?

1041
01:26:44,868 --> 01:26:46,868
- HOW'S HIS PAIN PRESENTING?
- <i>10.</i>

1042
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,968
- RESPIRATION?
- <i>LABORED.</i>

1043
01:26:48,968 --> 01:26:52,200
LET'S GIVE HIM .25 NITROGLYCERIN
AND 5mg OF MORPHINE.

1044
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:07,467
- <i>LUCAS.</i>
- YEAH, I'M COMING. I'M COMING.

1045
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:11,634
- WANT CHAMPAGNE?
- YES, PLEASE.

1046
01:27:11,634 --> 01:27:14,634
ESTRAGON? ESTRAGON?

1047
01:27:14,634 --> 01:27:16,200
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

1048
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,634
<i>OH!</i>

1049
01:32:07,801 --> 01:32:11,200
MM.

1050
01:33:48,234 --> 01:33:52,467
<i>* BEFORE THE MIND</i>

1051
01:33:52,467 --> 01:33:56,000
<i>* WAS AN OPEN BOOK</i>

1052
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,467

1054
01:34:07,033 --> 01:34:10,300
<i>* BUT THEN SOMEONE STARTS</i>

1055
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:13,701
<i>* FILLING THEM IN</i>

1056
01:34:15,133 --> 01:34:18,067
<i>* THE INK IS BLACK</i>

1057
01:34:18,067 --> 01:34:21,267

1058
01:34:25,734 --> 01:34:27,901
