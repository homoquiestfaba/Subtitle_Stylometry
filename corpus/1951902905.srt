1
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,120
I need backup.

2
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,292
Time out.

3
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,634
[Imitating gunfire]

4
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,102
Dude, I said, "time out."

5
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,977
Oh, what's up, dude?

6
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,477
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

7
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,080
I had a feeling
you'd be coming over...

8
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:22,649
And I already unlocked
the piano for you.

9
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:23,415
Serious?

10
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,984
Thanks, Pete, you're the best.

11
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,203
I know.

12
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:29,387
Time in.

13
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,324
[Imitating gunfire]

14
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,758
[Sighs]

15
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:38,154
[Orchestra tuning up...]

16
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:47,536
[Voices vocalizing faintly...]

17
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,403
On my way

18
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:22,534
Though I don't know
where I'm going

19
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,045
On a road that's dark

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,217
And long

21
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:34,319
On my way

22
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,222
But I'm fearful that
I could be lost

23
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,562
That the path I have chosen

24
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:47,065
Might be wrong

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,568
When will it be clear

26
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:55,108
Boy: that I
made the right choice?

27
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:58,576
When can I be sure

28
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:03,207
Boy: that I know
my own voice?

29
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,586
Both: dream of a day
when I'm free from doubt

30
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:10,857
And faith wins out

31
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:15,094
And I overcome my fear

32
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,586
Boy: clear.

33
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,409
[Song ends]

34
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,049
What are you doing?

35
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,791
[Gasps and laughs]

36
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:46,525
You scared me, I...

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,225
I'm Madison Huxley...

38
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,619
Did you hear that?

39
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,054
I'm Madison Huxley,
my father owns this mall.

40
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,333
Oh, yeah, yeah, I totally
know who you are, I'm Ally...

41
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,503
last I heard, this piano
was for official mall use only.

42
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,839
Oh, yeah, I just... I practice.

43
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,341
When there's nobody around,
'cause of the acoustics.

44
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,266
Well, I'm around

45
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,513
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

46
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,307
I'm getting security to
lock this thing back up.

47
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,687
[Door slams shut]

48
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,789
When will it be clear

49
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,725
That I made
the right choice?

50
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,668
When can I be sure

51
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:08,673
That I know my own voice?

52
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,011
Dream of a day
when I'm free from doubt

53
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:16,144
When faith wins out

54
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:20,242
And I overcome my fear

55
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,688
Clear.

56
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:28,960
[Song ends]

57
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,962
Boy: she wrote another song?

58
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,714
Is this one finished?

59
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,031
Don't you know by now?

60
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,167
She never finishes any of it

61
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:35,667
Even half-finished...

62
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,567
her songs are better than
anything I could ever write.

63
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,904
Hey, maybe she's got A.D.D.

64
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,443
I got A.D.D., it can
really impede on one's ability
to complete tasks.

65
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:45,274
Yeah, and, uh,
one's ability to shut up.

66
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,448
All I'm saying is you should
make your move soon, man.

67
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,885
I sang with her last night.

68
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,720
[Laughs] all right, dude,
so you finally talked to her?

69
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,584
Oh, Joey, man, this is
getting pathetic, dude.

70
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,629
You're, like, playing
the phantom of the mall.

71
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,265
Yeah, dude, rock stars
aren't all timid and shy

72
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
It wasn't the right time, Ricky

73
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,434
It's never the right time

74
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,804
Ugh, time, time, time, time...

75
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,101
time!

76
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,484
Well, time don't wait
for no one

77
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,987
No one gets in for free

78
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,420
It's time we got it going

79
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,759
And I can see myself,
I'm a star in a rock band

80
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,878
Signing all them autographs

81
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:36,928
Just don't you know that...

82
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,597
every 10 seconds,
someone's changing the world

83
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,569
Someone's breaking the rules
and someone gets the girl

84
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:47,506
Every 10 seconds,
there's a runner crossing over
the line

85
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,228
Sent my application,
I got nothing to lose

86
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:55,146
Looking at my watch
and it's a quarter to

87
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:59,709
Everything I want, I can
see it, see it in my mind

88
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,771
It's just a matter of time
(time, time, time)

89
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:07,323
It's the matter of time
(time, time, time)

90
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,831
And it takes blind ambition

91
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:15,198
To rock the industry

92
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,001
I'll make somebody listen

93
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,506
They're gonna play my song,
gonna hear it on the radio

94
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,670
Driving down the freeway,
that's what I say...

95
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,445
every 10 seconds,
someone's changing the world

96
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,000
Someone's breaking the rules,
and someone gets the girl

00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:36,520
Every 10 seconds,
there's a runner
crossing over the line

Looking at my watch
and it's a quarter to

100
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:48,100
Everything I want, gotta do
what it takes to get mine

101
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,536
It's just a matter of time

102
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,428
Here we go, one, two,
one, two, three.

103
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:21,434
They're gonna play my song,
gonna hear it on the radio

104
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:24,786
Driving down the freeway,
that's what I say...

105

every 10 seconds,
someone's changing the world

106
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,366
Someone's breaking the rules,
and someone gets the girl

107
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:37,343
Every 10 seconds,
there's a runner
crossing over the line

108
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,886
Sent my application,
I got nothing to lose

109
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:44,021
Looking at my watch
and it's a quarter to

110
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:49,228
Everything I want, gotta do
what it takes to get mine

111
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:52,782
It's just a matter of time
(time, time, time)

112
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:56,302
It's just a matter of time
(time, time, time).

113
00:08:56,337 --> 00:09:00,605
[Song ends]

114
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,107
[Breathing heavily and coughing]

115
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,634
We are gonna be one
kick-ass rock band someday.

116
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,648
Yeah, as soon as we get
some real instruments...

117
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,081
hey, give it time,
man, give it time.

118
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,618
Yeah, in the meantime,
let's get back to work, alright?

119
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,882
Ugh.

120
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,141
You're gonna keep sleeping here
, you can at least open up
the store on time.

121
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,483
It's not like we got them
busting down the door
to buy stuff.

122
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,713
Just because
it's been a little slow...

123
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,013
"slow" would be an improvement,
Mom, it's like...

124
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,292
[yawns] we went out of business,
and nobody told us.

125
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:56,819
Doesn't mean we stop
doing our job.

126
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,264
Not that anyone cares.

127
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:04,704
[Sighs] at least I have three
piano lessons booked today.

128
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,968
Two, Miss Sullivan canceled.

129
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:12,941
Apparently Megan wants to
"do cheerleading instead."
[Giggles sarcastically]

130
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,516
Your friend Ben said this feng shui
fountain would stimulate wealth.

131
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,950
So far, all it's done
is make me want to pee.

132
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:26,191
Maybe I'll put you out
in the mall with a hat
to sing for spare coins.

133
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,458
Yeah, right,
why don't you do it?

134
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,695
I mean, you're the one
who's a professional singer.

135
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,163
Yeah.

136
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,166
One record 20 years ago
that no one ever bought.

137
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,101
Any word from Ohio?

138
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,670
Uh, no, not yet.

139
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,997
Mom: well, don't worry.

140
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,740
They'll accept you off
the wait list.

141
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,603
You're got your father's talent
with numbers, god rest his soul.

142
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,749
You'll get into
your first choice.

143
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:53,250
Huh, uh, yeah, yeah, um...

144
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:57,790
Ohio's got a great, uh,
business department.

145
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,828
Welcome back, Mr. Huxley.
[Laughs]

146
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,400
Oh, it must bring back
a lot of memories being
back at your very first mall

147
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:09,419
After having been
away for so long.

148
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:11,404
Hard at work on
your retail empire.

149
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,870
Huxley: I suppose so.

150
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,908
And how gratifying,
your daughter following
in your footsteps.

151
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:20,913
She's a, uh, Two-For-One split
off the old stock. [Laughs]

152
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:21,931
Huxley: Max Huxley.

153
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:22,915
Ok, that wasn't funny.

154
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,645
That's ok.

155
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,053
What are you doing?

156
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,892
[Tearfully]: I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

157
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:34,558
I'm a stress eater

158
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:39,165
Well, my staff is required
to be a size zero.

159
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,463
Or under, preferably, under.

160
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,033
So you choose,
meaningful employment...

161
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,433
or candy-Coated cellulite?

162
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,045
There's my beautiful
college graduate.

163
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,083
Daddy... [laughs]

164
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,450
I'm so glad you're here, ok,
I've got our day together
all planned out.

165
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,921
You're gonna see my little
presentation first...

166
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,293
and then I made reservations
for us at that chic, new sushi
restaurant I was telling you...

167
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,328
Maddy, I'm sorry, but
I can't spend the day with you.

168
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:12,031
I have to leave in
a few minutes.

169
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,497
Oh.

170
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,056
An opportunity popped up
for me to acquire another mall

171
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,433
And as you know,
business is war.

172
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,638
How 'bout I fly in
next week to make it up to you

173
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,508
We'll have a very special
dinner, just the two of us.

174
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:23,974
Ok.

175
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:29,081
Um, you can still see my
presentation, though, right?

176
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:29,877
Hit me with it.

177
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,641
Ok, ok, um, wait there, um...

178
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,921
[Woman whispering]: Madison.

179
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,625
Madison: you'll find
only the best pieces

180
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,058
From the most
exclusive designers.

181
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,427
[Woman whispering]: Madison.

182
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,430
Demonstrating the most
discerning eye for fashion.

183
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,791
Madison...

184
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,569
expensive, refined, Madison.

185
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,709
So what do you think?

186
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,534
It was nice.

187
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,879
"Nice"?

188
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,683
I'm in stores every day,
all over the country.

189
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,184
And yours looks like
a lot of them.

190
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,710
If you want to succeed in
retail, you have to be
different, unique.

191
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,189
I know that.

192
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,728
I mean, that's why
I did all of this.

193
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:17,696
I wanted to show you ordinary.

194
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,163
That was ordinary.

195
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,225
Madison's is going to be
cutting-edge.

196
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,638
So you have a plan?

197
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,005
Madison: totally.

198
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,507
You just have to
give me a chance.

199
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:33,034
I'm sorry, but if you're gonna
a make this meeting,
we have to go.

200
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,213
Daddy?

201
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,182
[Breathes deeply]

202
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,053
Dori, give Madison whatever
she needs to make this happen.

203
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,121
Dori: yes, sir.

204
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,155
Thank you. [Laughs]

205
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,688
I have to go.

206
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:45,707
Madison: you won't

207
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,691
I know I won't

208
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,228
Um, I'll see you next week
for our special dinner.

209
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:51,719
Huxley: you will.

210
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,773
[Mouths silently]

211
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:02,740
Owen.

212
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,778
This, we're playing this.

213
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,658
That's a pretty tune.

214
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,559
Uh...

215
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,425
yeah.

216
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,154
I thought he was in a hurry.

217
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,309
Mom, don't look at me
like that, please.

218
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:41,779
Come on, give me a chance.

219
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,283
Can never get through to
that woman.

220
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,753
I don't want to talk about it,
what's going on in your life?

221
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:55,294
Not much, except that I just had
a really weird moment
with Max Huxley.

222
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,081
Oh, and last night,
I had a run-in with Madison.

223
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,833
Uh, she said my outfit
looked like baby vomit.

224
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:02,852
She's obnoxious,
spoiled, narcissistic...

225
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:05,113
and she has perfect hair,
I hate her.

226
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:07,304
[Laughs] control
your hair envy, please.

227
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,331
Before Miss Buzzkill even
showed up, I heard a voice.

228
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,845
Uh, there's medication
for that, bubo.

229
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,836
I'm serious

230
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,781
This guy, I have no idea
who he was, but...

231
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:22,121
he was somewhere in the mall and
he was singing words to my song.

232
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,155
And they were good?

233
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,688
Yeah.

234
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,190
Yeah, they were, they were good.

235
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,878
It was like he was in my head
reading the lyrics

236
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:33,532
That were just floating around
that I can't.

237
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:34,760
Get out.

238
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,672
Wow, he really got to you.

239
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,138
A voice, huh?

240
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:45,633
I usually go for a nice butt,
but whatever toasts your bagel.

241
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,047
Girl: please, stop, stop,
please?

242
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:53,018
Please, No-No-No, stop, stop.

243
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,952
Ugh.

244
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,477
[Screaming]

245
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,483
Put me out of my misery.

246
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,531
On the house.

247
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:06,563
No, Ben.

248
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,701
No-No-No-No-No-No,
one of the many perks
of my new power position.

249
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,235
Assistant manager.

250
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,668
What?

251
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,672
Yeah, and my parents
were worried about my future
after high school.

252
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,731
Girl: at least
you're making progress.

253
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,745
Look, Kira's 15 and she's
already got her own boutique.

254
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,212
Ally: that girl's 15?

255
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,649
I know, and I can't even
get my mom to let me
design for the shop.

256
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,786
I mean, I'm going to
the fashion institute
for a reason, right?

257
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,856
Ben: why, you're 18
and already over the hill.

258
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,323
[Coughs]

259
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,861
My mom's excuse is that
I don't know anything about
plus-sized women's bodies.

260
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,328
And I'm like, " hello.

261
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,432
Inside of every skinny girl,
there's a fat chick just
screaming to come out."

262
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,832
You gotta tell her how you feel.

263
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:46,236
Says the girl whose mom still
thinks she's going to college
to be an accountant or whatever.

264
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,074
Hey, backspace, that's not fair

265
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,632
I'm waiting.

266
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,577
I mean, what if I don't
get into Ohio State College.

267
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,477
Then maybe my mom will let me
go to New England Conservatory?

268
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,373
To study music? [Laughs]

269
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,054
Are we still talking about
your mother, right, Mia?

270
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,756
Mia?

271
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,389
What?

272
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:10,020
Sorry, I was checking out
the summer crop of newbie guys.

273
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,764
There's my future Ex-B.F. Now.

274
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,931
Do you know that guy?

275
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,499
No.

276
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,297
But I'm going to.

277
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,270
[Mia grunts]

278
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,307
Ooh, take a number, "next."

279
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,341
[Sighs] whatever.

280
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,544
There's no other cute guy
s here today, anyway.

281
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,977
Hello, what about me?

282
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,779
Whoa, backspace.

283
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,247
Girl: now that's what
I'm talking about

284
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,451
Mia: who are they, why have
we never seen them before?

285
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:33,475
Ben: they're the night crew

286
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:34,409
Mia: janitors?

287
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,686
Girl: dirty.

288
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,588
I think they prefer to be called
custodial engineers.

289
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,587
Mia: mm, I call the one
in the garbage can.

290
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:49,199
[Laughs] I never imagined myself
with a guy who handles
trash for a living.

291
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,468
Me either, but I am now...

292
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,339
you realize that would make
both of you two trash, right?

293
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,108
Whatever, I buy lunch
and I'm ignored

294
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,641
We're not ignoring you

295
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,312
You know, you're
one of the girls.

296
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,779
What?

297
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,280
Whatever, I'm leaving

298
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,783
Ally: Ben, Ben,
come on, come on.

299
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,183
You know how Mia gets.

300
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,953
The only reason she even
works here is to shop for boys.

301
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,753
Mia: hey, look.

302
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,291
People come to the mall
to shop for all kinds of
things, all right?

303
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:13,121
Why not boys?

304
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,642
The minute I walk in,
there is so much to see

305
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:34,144
I check out the boys
who are checking out me

306
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:39,852
Every shape and size,
and I want to sample them all

307
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:43,487
I see dazzling designs
when I open my eyes

308
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,650
Baby, I can change my world
with these hot dogs and fries

309
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:53,532
All: stop and take a look,
something special behind
every wall (wall)

310
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,532
At the mall...

311
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,730
hangin' out with your friend,
at the mall...

312
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,499
circulate and spend

313
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,507
You can be real,
loosen up, what's the deal

314
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,579
Hit your stride as you glide
down the hall

315
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,166
At the mall...

316
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:12,010
at the mall

317
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:13,784
Help me.

318
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,389
I like those uniforms in gray
and smart and brainy types

319
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:20,858
At the mall, ooh,
at the mall

320
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,896
And I go a little crazy
for the scrumptious boys
in stripes

321
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:27,195
At the mall, ooh,
at the mall

322
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,969
Try on the latest in couture
with a wrap that is surreal

323
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,071
At the mall, (fierce), ooh,
at the mall

324
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,940
And some killer
velvet sneakers with a 10-inch
rubber heel

325
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,280
Chorus: at the mall,
at the mall, at the mall

326
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:42,611
Ben: with an image
that is sharp

327
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,381
With a style that'
ultra-slick

328
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,419
And rock the fast food world
with noodles on a stick

329
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,887
Chorus: at the mall,
at the mall, at the mall

330
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:54,259
At the mall, at the mall,
at the mall, at the mall

331
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,726
Girl: ow

332
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:59,363
At the mall...

333
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,434
at the mall
(at the mall, at the mall)

334
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,903
At the mall...

335
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,608
at the mall, at the mall,
at the mall...

336
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:12,945
hanging with a friend
at the mall

337
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,276
Circulate and spend

338
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,606
You can be real,
loosen up, what's the deal

339
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,008
Hit your stride as you glide
down the hall

340
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,053
At the mall

341
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,784
Doing what you please,
at the mall

342
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,649
Possibilities

343
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,390
Lost in a crowd,
all shouting out loud

344
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:34,922
You can scheme, you can dream
at the call

345
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,966
[Phone rings]

346
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,837
At the mall, at the mall,
at the mall

347
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:42,941
At the mall, at the mall...

348
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,211
at the mall.

349
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:47,411
[Song ends]

350
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,948
Daddy's coming in for
the Huxley Mall Summer Slam

351
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,917
So we'll announce
my grand opening then.

352
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,383
Done.
Fantastic.

353
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,688
Hey, should we grab a bite
in the food court before
I show you the space?

354
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,087
Madison: ew.

355
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,994
Even if we did eat lunch,
we wouldn't eat it there,
would we?

356
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,518
Would we, Alexa?

357
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,497
Yeah, barf.

358
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,035
Well, if you don't eat lunch,
then when do you eat?

359
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,537
Mondays and Fridays.

360
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:16,006
Oh... good.

361
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,542
And let's go see the space.

362
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,976
Mm, great.
Ok.

363
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,325
Thanks.

364
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,864
Turn off the- Oh, bye, Emma.

365
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:40,864
Open a door

366
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,901
Want a little something

367
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,903
And bought a little...

368
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:46,370
you wrote lyrics?

369
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,896
That's all I got so far

370
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,910
Shouldn't waste time
trying to finish a tune
I started when you were three.

371
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:56,248
Well, seems like we both have
a problem finishing
songs we started.

372
00:21:56,283 --> 00:22:00,218
Yeah, well, earning a living
is just slightly more important.

373
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,049
With all these bills...

374
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,591
what is it?

375
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,351
It's from Ohio State

376
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,564
My gosh, open it.

377
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,324
I... got in.

378
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,041
You did.

379
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,579
See, I knew you would,
that's so terrific, ooh...

380
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:29,081
my high-powered businesswoman.

381
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,247
Yeah.

382
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:35,083
So the square footage isn't
quite what you asked for, but...

383
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,923
then I want that space too.

384
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,316
But it's occupied.

385
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,728
So?

386
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,196
Well, they're one of
the mall's original tenants.

387
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,630
It's gonna be hard to
convince 'em to vacate, so...

388
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:55,474
Daddy did say to get me
whatever I want, but...

389
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,842
if you can't handle that...

390
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,175
just... give me a second.

391
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,969
Ok.

392
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,713
Are we interrupting?

393
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,951
This is... Madison Huxley.

394
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,490
Wow, you used to run around
with your father when he
first opened up the mall.

395
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:14,410
Yeah, anyway, I'm gonna
knock out this wall

396
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:17,295
And open my new mega-hot
boutique right here.

397
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,125
What?

398
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,600
Um, you can't kick us out,
I mean, we have a lease.

399
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:24,152
Well, we're not gonna
kick you out, it's just...

400
00:23:24,187 --> 00:23:26,670
You're a little overdue for
a rent increase.

401
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,939
Increase?

402
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,675
We can barely afford
what we pay now.

403
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,943
[Clears throat]

404
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,311
Look, I'm so sorry, but this
is completely out of my hands.

405
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:43,121
And according to your lease, if
you're late, we have a problem.

406
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:44,721
But hey, here's an idea.

407
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,492
If you agree to vacate now,
we can offer you a little
compensation.

408
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:51,986
Which you clearly need,
judging by how busy you are.

409
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,664
We're plenty busy, besides...

410
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,170
We've got lots of new students
just begging for lessons.

411
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:00,137
Ally?

412
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,874
We're gonna pay the increase

413
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,841
Look.

414
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,309
I want this store.

415
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,679
And I wanted Zac Efron

416
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,615
But you know what, everyone's

417
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,949
So we'll, we'll talk later,
thank you.

418
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,326
Can you?

419
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,226
What, I, ugh.

420
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,496
Ooh.

421
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,801
At the mall
[laughs].

422
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:32,119
At the mall... do it

423
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:34,402
Ooh, ooh, how'd it go?

424
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,831
I want them gone.

425
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,708
I guess that means not so well.

426
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:42,814
We can't force them out
if they're agreed to pay
the hiked-up rent.

427
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,681
Ok.

428
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,651
And get rid of this thing too.

429
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,171
[Screams]

430
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:52,549
Alexa!

431
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:54,858
Alexa?

432
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,294
Oh... you poor...

433
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:01,695
I have to go.

434
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,085

back another day.

[Loudly]: oh, were you knocking?

439
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,729
I couldn't hear you

440
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,301
What... what is your problem?

441
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:10,767
What?

442
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,269
Oh, my goodness.

443
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,807
I hope our construction
isn't disturbing your business

444
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:19,276
I am so sorry.

445

[Loud buzzing and drilling]

446
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,113
Bye, bye.

447
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,121
She's right.

448
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:35,460
If we're late with our rent,
even once, they can kick us out.

449
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:37,663
Doesn't give us
a lot of options.

450
00:26:37,698 --> 00:26:39,796
There is always
my college money.

451
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,836
No, it's called your
college money for a reason.

452
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:47,839
You let me
worry about the store.

453
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:51,041
You just focus on school.

454
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,645
Get a jump on your
future classmates.

455
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,682
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

Are you the voice?

469
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:28,907
Are you the one
that sang with me?

470
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:32,609
No.

471
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,213
It is you, isn't it?

472
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:37,147
Maybe.

473
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:40,685
How did you know my music?

474
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,949
I... I...

475
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,114
no, I, I can explain this.

476
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,825
Where did you...

477
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,060
my trash can.

478
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,294
No, no.

479
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:54,589
Well, yeah, it's.

480
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,169
But it's not just yours
it... it's my job

481
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:02,073
They were in the trash
for a reason.

482
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,940
But they're good

483
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,306
I mean they're really good

484
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,146
I just, I sang with you
that night when I heard you play

485
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:09,995
I just, I couldn't help myself

486
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,810
And you wrote words to my song?

487
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,985
No, I don't know, it was just
like, in me, I guess.

488
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,787
I heard your music and then I...

489
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,191
it was like you saw what
I was trying to say.

490
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,216
...saw what you were
trying to say.

491
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,825
Yeah.

00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:30,698
I'm Joey

493
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,533
Oh, Ally.

00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,098
Hey.
Hey.

495
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,098
[Clears throat]

496
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,085
You know, I practically
grew up in this mall

497
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,577
But I've never
been in here before.

498
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,059
It's the secret underbelly.

499
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,097
There's lots of places in
the mall that regular people...

500
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,133
aren't allowed to see.

501
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:06,603
Yeah, I bet.

502
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,906
You want to see my favorite?

503
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:15,246
So the guys and I,
we put this band together.

504
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,715
We were just about to
get our big break

505
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,384
Like, with this big A&R guy.

506
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:22,385
Everything got stolen.

507
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,390
Guitars, our amps, everything.

508
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,461
You know my mom's store
has got all that kind of stuff.

509
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,452
Yeah, I know. [Laughs]

510
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,989
We've had our nose
s pressed against your window
since we started working here.

511
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,966
[Laughs]

512
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,981
We're just trying to
save up enough.

513
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:42,962
I can tell it's pretty
important to you.

514
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,945
Yeah.

515
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,246
Also, I really owe the guys,
'cause it's kind of my fault
that everything got stolen.

516
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,244
Oh, how?

517
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,725
I was stupid.

518
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,764
Trusted the wrong people.

519
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,300
Boys are dumb.

520
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:11,291
Yeah.

521
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:19,106
I want to show you something.

00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:02,953
A world that you
never seen before

530
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:08,326
Starts moving in slow motion

531
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:11,329
Both: am I living now?

532
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:14,198
Out loud

533
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:24,908
I'm not afraid somehow

534
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,810
To let you see
right through me

535
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,146
Yeah

536
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,150
I must be dreaming

537
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:35,142
Wide awake

538
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,587
This world

539
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,534
So real

540
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:55,562
Like a kaleidoscope
made clear

541
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,976
To touch

542
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,979
To feel

543
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:06,306
What if it
made it disappear?

544
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:11,714
With just a chance that
you might change

545
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:17,695
I'd rather
breathe this moment...

546
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,697
am I living now?

547
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:23,267
Out loud

548
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,842
And I'm not afraid

549
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:33,910
Somehow

550
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,813
To let you
see right through me

551
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:42,411
Wait, I must be dreaming,
wide awake

552
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,890
Yeah...

553
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:51,427
yeah, yeah, yeah

554
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,632
Wide awake, wide awake

555
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:58,124
Yeah...

556
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,537
yeah, yeah, yeah... yeah

557
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,309
Yeah, yeah

558
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,300
Oh

559
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,981
Am I living now?

560
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:13,317
Out loud

561
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,591
And I'm not afraid
(I'm not afraid)

562
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:24,060
Somehow (somehow)

563
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:28,132
To let you see
right through me, no

564
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:31,135
Am I living now?

565
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,832
Out loud

566
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:44,439
And I'm not afraid somehow

567
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,652
To let you
see right through me

568
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:54,692
I must be dreaming wide awake
(I must be dreaming)

569
00:34:54,727 --> 00:35:00,255
I must be dreaming
wide awake.

570
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:04,534
[Song ends]

571
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,407
Pete: dudes?

572
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:16,607
Come on, man,
if Dori catches you,
she'll put my butt in a sling.

573
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,769
It's cool, man

574
00:35:21,804 --> 00:35:23,486
Sorry, Pete.

575
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,988
Yeah, I'm sorry too, you know.

576
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:31,017
Guys... Joey...
oh, not funny, man.

577
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,238
So...

578
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,577
so, I'll, um, see you tomorrow?

579
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:47,566
You know where to find me.

580
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,676
Yeah, going through
my trash. [Laughs]

581
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:57,986
Bye.

582
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,690
All right. [Chuckles]

583
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,717
Actually, wait, um...

584
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:57,246
[Sawing and hammering]

585
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,351
[Sighs] and you know that
she's only doing it
to force us to leave.

586
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,619
What a total jerk.

587
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:02,818
What are you gonna do?

588
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,537
I don't know, I mean,
it's becoming serious.

589
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:08,222
People are starting to
cancel their lessons.

590
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,593
Sorry, what did I miss?

591
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:10,628
Ben: what took you so long?

592
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:12,914
Finally, gosh.

593
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:15,058
Hey, guys.

594
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:17,133
Hey.
Hey.

595
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:21,706
You're been intentionally tryin
to accidentally run into those
janitor guys again, haven't you?

596
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:22,939
Yes.

597
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:23,975
Well, did you see 'em?

598
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,844
Oh, my god, I look too fierce...

599
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:27,401
hey.

600
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:28,911
Oh, my gosh,
it's a hot janitor guy.

601
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:29,946
Hi.

602
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,113
Hey, Joey.

603
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,818
Uh, could we join you guys?

604
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:35,151
Yeah.

605
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,450
Cool.

606
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,789
What, Joey, what?

607
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,815
Oh, my gosh, he is so hot.

608
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,327
Wait, have you been
holding out on us?

609
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,293
Hey.

610
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,763
I don't think he's all that hot

611
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:46,696
Well, he is.

612
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,232
You need to tell me everything.

613
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,517
Is he a good kisser?

614
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:50,768
How big are his hands?

615
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:51,767
Mia...

616
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,292
these are the guys.

617
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,654
Hey.
Hey.

618
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,637
Hey.
Hey.

619
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,540
Hey.
Hey.

620
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:04,678
Guys, you can sit.

621
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,468
Yeah, sit.

622
00:38:07,503 --> 00:38:09,987
I'm Mia

623
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,990
Well, I guess
I'll get back to work.

624
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,184
Yeah, ok.

625
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,949
What's your name?

626
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,333
[Whispers]: dude...
she scares me.

627
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,172
Mind hanging out of
a spare guitar string?

628
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:29,173
In case yours breaks?

629
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,975
Mm-Hm.

630
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,708
[Laughter]

631
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,007
Yo, Rick, check this out.

632
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,349
[Grunts]

633
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,547
Wow, you're, uh, a real rocker.

634
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,723
Sounds a whole lot
better than my mop.

635
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:48,715
Some critics might disagree.

636
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,756
Let's see what the critics
have to say about this.

637
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,339
Let's go

638
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,611
Everybody caught up in
the wheel of fortune

639
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,885
Virtual life, well,
it can get so boring

640
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,423
Isolation, suffocation,
we all need a big vacation

641
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,221
Just get lost
in the wall of sound

642
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:27,663
Music makes us
come together now

643
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,968
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

644
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:34,070
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

645
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,241
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it,
that's what you want

646
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:41,526
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

647
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:45,777
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on...

648
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,108
yeah, whoo.

649
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:56,861
Don't you know it's all about
the liberation?

650
00:39:56,896 --> 00:40:00,229
Gotta use it or lose it,
no hesitation

651
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,934
Take a lesson,
stop the stressing, here'
a cure for your depression

652
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:08,139
Just get lost
in the wall of sound

653
00:40:08,174 --> 00:40:09,605
Alexa?

654
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,308
...us come together now

655
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,980
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

656
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:19,248
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

657
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,653
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it,
that's what you want

658
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:27,425
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on...

659
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,645
everybody got
their own music

660
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,796
Playing 'round in their head

661
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,601
But when we all
bring it together

662
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,337
Ain't nothing better

663
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:41,038
Ain't nothing better...

664
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:42,571
oh, oh, oh

665
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,107
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

666
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:49,180
Get what you want,
come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

667
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:52,172
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it,
that's what you want

668
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:56,318
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

669
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,523
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

670
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,458
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

671
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,030
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it,
that's what you want

672
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:09,134
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

673
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:12,604
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

674
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,774
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

675
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:19,111
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

676
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:22,413
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on.

677
00:41:22,448 --> 00:41:24,313
[Song ends, cheering]

678
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,714
[Screams]: what is
going on in here?

679
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,421
They're all ruined.

680
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,856
Do you know how much these cost?

681
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,893
Yeah, I was the one
who tagged the prices.

682
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:37,993
Don't be smart.

683
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:41,098
You have to start thinking about
the consequences of what you do.

684
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:44,135
Life is not all
singing and dancing, Ally.

685
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,102
Mom, we, we were just
trying to... help.

686
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:50,241
I mean, did you see all
the people that their music
brought into the store?

687
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:52,232
Oh, did any of those
people buy anything?

688
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,407
Exactly.

689
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,910
Well...

690
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,694
I'm really sorry if
we upset your mom today.

691
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:14,131
No, it's, it's not
you guys, it's the store.

692
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,098
Yeah.

693
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:20,102
And me. [Chuckles]

694
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:23,641
She tried doing the whole music
thing when she was younger.

695
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:26,143
Be a professional singer, but...

696
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:28,134
it didn't work out.

697
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,115
And now we're barely
getting by, and...

698
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:36,085
she told me that, um...

699
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,111
well, what does that
have to do with you?

700
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:45,846
Deep down, I think that she
knows that I want to do it too.

701
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:51,068
And I kind of sort of got into
new england conservatory.

702
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:54,805
What, are you serious?

703
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,472
That's awesome

704
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,542
To you, yeah, but...

705
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,180
I'm terrified as to
what she's gonna say
when she finds out.

706
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:04,780
I mean...

707
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,783
she wants me to go to
Ohio State College for Business.

708
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:11,822
I don't even really know what
studying business means, like...

709
00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:13,789
[sighs]

710
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:18,295
But just 'cause she didn't?
make it doesn't mean that
you're not going to, you know

711
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,730
You're not her

712
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:28,694
Plus, you're...
You're pretty talented

713
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,213
I'm sorry, that was way too...

714
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:38,181
no, no, it, no...

715
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,358
step out of the car
with your hands up.

716
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,397
Joey: Pete,
you're killing me, dude.

717
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:56,434
Dude, you're killing me

718
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,453
If Dori catches you...

719
00:43:58,488 --> 00:44:00,437
Ally: I'm sorry, Pete.

720
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:10,880
[Mouthing silently]

721
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,711
[Phone rings]

722
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,161
Hi, daddy.

723
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,400
Ok, so I was gonna wait
and talk to you about this
at our special dinner...

724
00:44:29,435 --> 00:44:32,236
but I just can't wait, I'm gonna
tell you right now, ok.

725
00:44:32,271 --> 00:44:34,872
So what do you think about
putting a Madison'

726
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:36,905
In every single one
of your malls?

727
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,609
That way we could spend
so much more time together.

728
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:41,578
That sounds great, sweetie.

729
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,014
You're not coming
for our dinner, are you?

730
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,484
They rearranged my schedule,
and I can't change it.

731
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,220
You're not mad, are you?

732
00:44:49,255 --> 00:44:50,886
No, I know you're busy.

733
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,481
Business is war, Maddy,
and battles rarely happen
when you want them to.

734
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,357
Man: here you go, sir.

735
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,562
I'm coming to the summer slam
and for your big launch,
I'll take you to dinner then.

736
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:00,346
I promise.

737
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:02,095
Ok, bye.

738
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,092
[Screams]

739
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,598
Why is it taking you so long
to get me what I want?

740
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,576
I am.

741
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,078
It's only been...

742
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,581
uh, please don't call
your father.

743
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,576
Do I have to do
everything myself?

744
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,563
[Gasps and sniffles]

745
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,700
Surprise.

746
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,601
I thought they took it away.

747
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,405
It was supposed to be
shipped to the main warehouse.

748
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,309
But it got lost in translation.

749
00:45:45,344 --> 00:45:47,209
He means lost in transit.

750
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:51,305
And you know, I thought
you could use a pick me up.

751
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,317
Ally: yeah.

752
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:58,487
What's all this for?

753
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,958
Uh, the, uh, Huxley mall
summer slam...

754
00:46:00,993 --> 00:46:03,194
Hey, what's it called, anyway?

755
00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:05,395
The Huxley mall summer slam.

756
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,730
[Imitating cheering]

757
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,534
I've already got the toy number
worked out, I'm the star.

758
00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:12,936
I should enter my designs,
that'll show my mom.

759
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,703
Awesome, hey, I'll model

760
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,505
Yeah, you're really
good at wearing clothes.

761
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,475
Yeah, it's just
the walking you're gonna
have to worry about.

762
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,478
Dude, drummers just
have to sit down.

763
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:22,446
I can have time
to practice walking.

764
00:46:22,481 --> 00:46:22,969
That's right.

765
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,892
Skylight tonight?

766
00:46:34,927 --> 00:46:37,111
10:00?

767
00:46:37,146 --> 00:46:39,261
10:00.

768
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,866
Hey, you know,
you guys should totally perform
at the summer slam.

769
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:45,119
You know, everyone loved it
when you rocked out at Ally'

770
00:46:45,154 --> 00:46:47,302
Yeah, they should, as a part of
the "stay tuned" submission.

771
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:50,607
Get people grooving,
maybe inspire someone
to buy an instrument.

772
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:53,877
Take up lessons,
bring in business,
yeah, that's a great idea

773
00:46:53,912 --> 00:46:58,143
Yeah, and we could totally
play one of your songs too.

774
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,017
One of our songs.

775
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,914
Joey?

776
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,431
Yeah.

777
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,968
Dori: you're needed
up in store number 63.

778
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,471
Look, can someone else do it,
I, I got plans.

779
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,305
No.

780
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,343
It's kind of
a job security thing for you.

781
00:47:26,378 --> 00:47:27,244
And for me.

782
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:28,629
What?

783
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:29,945
Nothing.

784
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,948
Just... get up there.

785
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,369
You're here.

786
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,471
Yeah, so where'd the emergency?

787
00:47:56,506 --> 00:48:01,178
Well, I'm sure you're heard
about my plans for my new store.

788
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:03,514
Well, this store needs a face.

789
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:05,781
A face for all of our ads.

790
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:10,120
A face that makes women
think, "I want that."

791
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:11,220
Mm-Hmm.

792
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,874
You're that face.

793
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:16,458
[Laughs] what?

794
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,178
Yeah, I don't know
what you're drinking here

795
00:48:18,213 --> 00:48:19,863
But maybe you should
take it easy, you know?

796
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:20,562
Eat some bread or something.

797
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:25,159
"Some bread,"
[laughs], you're funny.

798
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,673
Look, I've heard you sing.

799
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,140
And you're amazing.

800
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:36,945
And I've got a feeling that
underneath all of this...

801
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,951
you're got the potential to be
a lot more than you realize.

802
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:42,720
Well, thanks for
thinking of me, but...

803
00:48:42,755 --> 00:48:44,454
I actually gotta
meet someone right now...

804
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:47,423
So I'm, I'm gonna get going.

805
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,525
What's all this?

806
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:55,065
Just a little something
I picked up for...

807
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,531
you and your crew.

808
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,057
And with that grand piano
in the warehouse...

809
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:02,806
yeah, no, I, it was supposed...

810
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:06,008
keep it, it'll be our secret.

811
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,879
Joey: wait a minute,
you're not just giving this
all to us, are you?

812
00:49:08,914 --> 00:49:10,631
What's the catch?

813
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,314
There's no catch.

814
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:16,853
Why don't you just think of me
as a patroness of the arts?

815
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:20,857
Imagine it, your picture
advertising my stores

816
00:49:20,892 --> 00:49:24,326
In every mall
across the country.

817
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,898
That kind of exposure's gonna
a get you and your band noticed.

818
00:49:27,933 --> 00:49:30,365
You'll play in front of
the right people.

819
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,905
Then come the record deals,
the Cd's, the music videos.

820
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,924
Who knows if it'll ever stop?

821
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:38,909
Come on, you can do all that?

822
00:49:38,944 --> 00:49:40,399
[Chuckles]

823
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:46,717
My dad is a powerful man
with powerful friends.

824
00:49:46,752 --> 00:49:50,220
I could make you a rock star.

825
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:06,103
I've got a plan that can
solve all your problems

826
00:50:06,138 --> 00:50:10,572
Just think of me
as your magical wand

827
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:14,411
You're got a dream,
and I've got connections

828
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:18,213
And we naturally bond
[giggles]

829
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:22,669
If you agree, we can go in
as partners

830
00:50:22,704 --> 00:50:27,055
No other team'
ever been quite this hot

831
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,427
You might be scared,
but there's nothing to lose

832
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:32,796
You can leave if you choose

833
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,300
But I bet you will not

834
00:50:36,335 --> 00:50:39,820
Take a look at the new you

835
00:50:39,855 --> 00:50:43,271
Imagine how it would feel

836
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,309
If what you see
could be real

837
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:49,312
What you want
could be true...

838
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:50,879
[phone ringing]

839
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:54,451
It's the new you (new you)

840
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:55,509
New you

841
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,816
Hey, uh, it's Ally.

842
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:04,394
I know you want
all the things I can offer

843
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,229
I see your face
next to mine on TV

844
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:11,435
Your band will play and
we'll all scream your name

845
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,665
You'll have cash,
you'll have fame

846
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,290
And you'll even have me

847
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:20,903
Take a look at the new you

848
00:51:20,938 --> 00:51:24,446
Imagine how it would feel

00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:28,451
If what you see
could be real

850
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:32,606
What you want could be true

851
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:36,752
So take a look at
the new you

852
00:51:36,787 --> 00:51:40,076
Try on the clothes
you will wear

853
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:43,366
Come take a step,
if you dare

854
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:48,388
Time to make your debut

855
00:51:48,423 --> 00:51:53,376
Chorus: new you, new you

856
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:57,479
The new you

857
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:01,818
New you, new you

858
00:52:01,853 --> 00:52:03,103
The new you

859
00:52:03,138 --> 00:52:04,319
Joey?
What?

860
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:06,288
Pull it together.

861
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:07,847
Hey, man, what's the matter?

862
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,158
I don't know, dude

863
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:13,162
I just, I do this and
I get back all the stuff
I lost for you guys.

864
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:14,663
It doesn't feel right to me

865
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:18,702
I don't know what to say, man,
but what do you have to lose?

866
00:52:18,737 --> 00:52:21,138
You're a rock star now,
go be one.

867
00:52:21,173 --> 00:52:25,676
Take a look at the new you

868
00:52:25,711 --> 00:52:29,130
Imagine how it will feel

869
00:52:29,165 --> 00:52:33,638
What you see can be real

870
00:52:33,673 --> 00:52:38,112
What you want can be true

871
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:42,124
Take a look at the new you

872
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,897
How does it feel
to be a star?

873
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,853
take a look at the new you.

874
00:53:09,888 --> 00:53:11,419
[Song ends]

875
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:14,222
And I was like, " Mom,
what about my designs?"

876
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,260
And she was like,
"your designs might be
better suited for the circus."

877
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:19,262
[Scoffs] I can't believe
your mom said that.

878
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:20,762
I know.
Did you get mad?

879
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:25,302
Please, this was from
a woman who goes to work
in a muumuu, ok?

a family emergency.

even then, Mom, that was just
'cause I thought that's what
you wanted me to do.

I mean... Mom, it's my dream

1058
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:06,082
Ally, there, there are dreams
and there are pipe dreams, ok?

1059
01:03:06,117 --> 01:03:09,503
You don't want to study
business, that's fine.

1060
01:03:09,538 --> 01:03:12,889
Just don't go after
something unattainable.

1061
01:03:12,924 --> 01:03:15,409
Un-, unattain-, Mom...

1062
01:03:15,444 --> 01:03:17,859
I'm good enough to get in

1063
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:19,694
So are hundreds of others
this year

1064
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,231
And thousands more that didn't'
make it in music and quit.

1065
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:26,235
Well, they gave up,
I'm not going to

1066
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:28,153
It's not giving up.

1067
01:03:28,188 --> 01:03:30,037
It's being practical.

1068
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,940
Look, I can't even
pay my rent now.

1069
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,412
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes I made
and wind up stuck like this.

1070
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:40,283
Is this, is your life
really all that bad?

1071
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:41,215
Yes, it is.

1072
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,720
I'm tired of struggling,
and I don't want that for you

1073
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:46,654
That's why I'm
selling the store.

1074
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:51,894
I'm selling the store
to Madison.

1075
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:52,960
What?

1076
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,662
I signed the papers yesterday.

1077
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:57,834
And you didn't talk to me
about it at first?

1078
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:01,103
It's not your
decision to make.

1079
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:03,571
Oh.

1080
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:04,572
Ok, um...

1081
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,844
look, it's the best
thing for us.

1082
01:04:07,879 --> 01:04:09,143
It'll get us both out of debt

1083
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,112
It'll give you the rest of
your college tuition.

1084
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,881
This way we're not stuck with
years of student loan payments.

1085
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,786
Just because you didn't make it
in the music business
doesn't mean I won't

1086
01:04:16,821 --> 01:04:20,790
Your chances of making it
are slim to none.

1087
01:04:20,825 --> 01:04:24,760
You don't know, you can't
see it clearly now.

1088
01:04:24,795 --> 01:04:26,095
You don't think
I'm good enough, do you?

1089
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,495
I didn't say that

1090
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,014
But it's true, isn't it?

1091
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:30,464
Ally...
just say it, Mom.

1092
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,933
Ally, don't
Or are you afraid...

1093
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:35,267
that I'm gonna succeed at
something that you failed at?

1094
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:46,449
I don't think
you're good enough

1095
01:04:46,484 --> 01:04:48,969
Ok?

1096
01:04:49,004 --> 01:04:51,419
I don't

1097
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:56,424
I think you're talented

1098
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:00,828
I just don't know if
you're talented enough

1099
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,497
It's a good thing it's not
your decision to make.

1100
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:23,417
[...]

1101
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:27,622
When gray meets light

1102
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:31,193
It creates new colors that

1103
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:35,029
Stay lost inside

1104
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:39,100
Till they find each other

1105
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:42,705
A world that you
never seen before

1106
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:46,542
Starts moving in slow motion

1107
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:48,544
Am I living now?

1108
01:05:48,579 --> 01:05:51,013
Out loud

1109
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:59,221
Joey: and I'm not afraid
somehow

1110
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:02,790
...right through me, wait

1111
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:05,928
I must be dreaming
wide awake.

1112

[Song ends]

1113
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,951
Hello?

1114
01:06:10,986 --> 01:06:13,034
Ally?

1115
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,838
Oh, hi, Ally,
don't we sound great?

1116
01:06:15,873 --> 01:06:17,672
That's my song.

1117
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,059
Technically, it's yours
and Joey'

1118
01:06:20,094 --> 01:06:22,376
Al, let, please, let me explain.

1119
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,011
You add in a couple of
nursery school rhymes

1120
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,014
And you think that gives you
the right to steal my song?

1121
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,249
That's not how it is.

1122
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,583
Oh, well, then,
tell me, how is it?

1123
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,755
I happen to think that
Joey's lyrics elevated
what was a mediocre tune.

1124
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,623
Maddy, would you cut that out?

1125
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,525
[Laughs] what, it's true.

1126
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,326
You gave it soul.

1127
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,479
Ally: he has no soul to give.

1128
01:06:40,514 --> 01:06:42,563
He's already sold that off.

1129
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:46,068
Um, I'm pretty sure she just
called you the devil.

1130
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:48,070
Yeah, I got that, thanks.

1131
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:49,537
[Sighs]

1132
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,639
Ok, look, I'm gonna give you
some advice.

1133
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:56,212
You're never gonna get
anywhere in life unless you can
see an opportunity and take it.

1134
01:06:56,247 --> 01:06:58,748
See, that's the difference
between me and you.

1135
01:06:58,783 --> 01:07:01,250
I would never step on someone
when they were down.

1136
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:04,787
Well, that's exactly why
I'm successful...

1137
01:07:04,822 --> 01:07:06,288
and you're stepped on.

01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:13,894
Ally, wait.

1140
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,932
Joey, just... let her go.

1141
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:21,003
She's gonna calm down
and she'll realize this is
what's best for everyone

1142
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:24,438
Herself included... ok?

1143
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:29,968
Ok, let's take it again
from the top.

I just woke up from
a fractured fairy tale

1149
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:17,316
I bought the dream but
didn't read the small details

1150
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,495
On which road I should take

1151
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:25,868
I thought I could see
yet you led me astray

1152
01:08:25,903 --> 01:08:28,705
And now I feel cheated

1153
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,507
I let you break my heart

1154
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:34,999
Invaded my power

1155
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:41,567
But I finally learned that
I hate to lose

1156
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:45,488
Now there's something
I've gotta prove

1157
01:08:45,523 --> 01:08:49,755
I'm a survivor (survivor)

1158
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:53,988

I gave away, yeah

1162

And I'll never do it again
unless it's an even trade

1163
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:20,488
Oh

1164
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:23,792
Oh, I opened my heart,
like a fool

1165
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:27,062

in the dark

Until you unplugged it

No, left a mark,
but I rise above it

come down a whole half an inch.

get them to move out.

01:11:54,445 --> 01:11:55,876
Then we're gonna
knock down that wall

1208

a big Mega-Madison's

make me look fat?

your fat makes you look fat.

remember this special night.

tonight after the show.

01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:23,399
Hey, I want to see.

1230
01:13:23,434 --> 01:13:25,866
Ugh, bucket?

1231
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:29,166
No, drew-fus, the A&R guys,
would you come on, let's go

1232
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:39,413
Joey, you coming?

1233
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,715
No, I'll catch up with you.

1234
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,151
Hey, one of you guys got a mint?

1235
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:53,817
[Sighs]

1236
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,124
[Sighs]

1237
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,630
I'm sorry I can't save

1238
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:34,670
A heart when it breaks
and scatters

1239
01:14:34,705 --> 01:14:39,640
In the wind

1240
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:42,643
How can two words

1241
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:46,637
Cover the healthy others

1242
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,619
They're living in...

1243
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:54,089
oh, I never believed

1244
01:14:54,124 --> 01:14:55,823
Mm, mm

1245
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:59,393
I'll never need

1246
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:02,948
any more than I did before

1247
01:15:02,983 --> 01:15:06,433
When sorry's not enough

1248
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:09,972
There's nowhere left to turn

1249
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:12,439
Too much to forgive

1250
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:15,961
Tell me where is the answer?

1251
01:15:15,996 --> 01:15:19,448
How do you
find the strength?

1252
01:15:19,483 --> 01:15:22,451
The strength to let it go

1253
01:15:22,486 --> 01:15:25,420
You need to just to live

1254
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:29,389
Oh, just to live

1255
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:34,987
And sorry's not enough...

1256
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:39,951
oh, oh, oh

1257
01:15:39,986 --> 01:15:43,370
Joey: mm-Mm

1258
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,474
Love can fall hard

1259
01:15:45,509 --> 01:15:47,641
Fall hard

1260
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,979
Leaving a scar
that remembers

1261
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:53,727
How bad it burns

1262
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,440
Ooh-Ooh (oh-Oh)

1263
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:59,686
We won't pretend

1264
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,623
Where next time begins

1265
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,328
Makes us live and learn

1266
01:16:06,363 --> 01:16:08,614
Live and learn, no

1267
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:10,866
Only now I believe

1268
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:12,902
Now I believe

1269
01:16:12,937 --> 01:16:14,903
I'm gonna say

1270
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:16,870
Whoa

1271
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:20,175
Both: little more than
I did before

1272
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:23,410
Sorry's not enough

1273
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,781
There's nowhere left to turn

1274
01:16:25,816 --> 01:16:28,750
Too much to forgive

1275
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,117
Forgive me

1276
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:33,405
Tell me where is the answer

1277
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,658
How do you
find the strength?

1278
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:39,428
The strength to let it go

1279
01:16:39,463 --> 01:16:42,565
You need to just to live

1280
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,632
Oh, just to live, baby

1281
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:50,038
Both: but sorry'
not enough...

1282
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:51,807
no, there's no going back

1283
01:16:51,842 --> 01:16:54,107
No going back

1284
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:56,877
But tomorrow is all...

1285
01:16:56,912 --> 01:17:00,182
Is all we could've had,
we could've had

1286
01:17:00,217 --> 01:17:04,387
So we will have...

1287
01:17:04,422 --> 01:17:08,522
sorry's not enough

1288
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:11,525
There's nowhere left to turn

1289
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,596
Too much to forgive
too much to, yeah

1290
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:17,867
Tell me, where is
the answer?

1291
01:17:17,902 --> 01:17:21,103
How do you
find the strength?

1292
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:23,890
The strength to let it go

1293
01:17:23,925 --> 01:17:27,402
You need to just to live

1294
01:17:27,437 --> 01:17:30,879
Oh, just to live, yeah, yeah

1295
01:17:30,914 --> 01:17:36,551
Sorry's not enough...

1296
01:17:36,586 --> 01:17:40,406
oh, ooh

1297
01:17:40,441 --> 01:17:43,266
Ally: mm.

1298
01:17:43,301 --> 01:17:46,091
[Song ends]

1299
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,063
[Cheering]

1300
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,598
I was totally perf

1301
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,368
Is Ally in the audience?

1302
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:55,103
Um, no, I didn't see her

1303
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:57,939
[Sighs]

1304
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:05,972
[Cheering]

1305
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,716
Watch it, weiner boy.

1306
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,519
Want a bite?

1307
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:16,458
[Scoffs] are you insane?

1308
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:23,181
[Applause and cheering]

1309
01:18:23,216 --> 01:18:25,576
Hey, hot dog, you're up.

1310
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:27,936
[Applause and cheering]

1311
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,301
That's me.

1312
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,076
Dori: ok, next up...

1313
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:36,445
your lunch.

1314
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:42,117
[Laughter]

1315
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:08,369
[Laughter]

1316
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:18,220
I thought we could take a break
and go see the rest of the
summer slam, what do you think?

1317
01:19:18,255 --> 01:19:21,223
I think I want to finish here
and then just go home.

1318
01:19:21,258 --> 01:19:23,714
That's what I think

1319
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:31,082
And now, fall fashions
from the newest store

1320
01:19:31,117 --> 01:19:34,503
To join the Huxley mall
family... Madison.

1321
01:19:34,538 --> 01:19:36,204
[Applause]

1322
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,646
[Inaudible speaking]

1323
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,491
Woman: ok, guys, you're up next

1324
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:06,401
[Cheering and laughter]

1325
01:20:06,436 --> 01:20:12,806
[Laughter...]

1326
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,707
Are you kidding me?

1327
01:20:14,742 --> 01:20:16,574
[Swallows noisily]

1328
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,515
Well. [Laughs nervously]

1329
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,218
We seem to have
a running theme here.

1330
01:20:23,253 --> 01:20:24,886
All right, you can
do it, dude, totally.

1331
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:25,886
All right.

1332
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,622
Just remember, man,
right-Left, right-Left.

1333
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:29,324
...the debut collection
by little penny.

1334
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:31,560
Go get ', tiger.

1335
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:36,997
Ow!

1336
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:42,095
[Laughter...]

1337
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:54,416
This is the last one.

1338
01:20:54,451 --> 01:20:56,383
Wow.

1339
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:58,919
I had no idea you were
such a master packer.

1340
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,923
Guess neither one of us
knew the other as well as
she thought she did.

1341
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:09,429
Ally...

1342
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:10,964
fine, I get it.

1343
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:14,970
You're an adult,
and I have to let you make
your own decisions, I know that.

1344
01:21:15,005 --> 01:21:18,974
I should've talked to you first
before selling the store

1345
01:21:19,009 --> 01:21:24,980
But you should've talked to me
about new england.

1346
01:21:25,015 --> 01:21:26,813
Look...

1347
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:30,817
you're all I've got.

1348
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,488
And I just want you to be happy.

1349
01:21:33,523 --> 01:21:35,979
I know that.

1350
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:41,396
I know.

1351
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:50,871
[Cheering]

1352
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:57,978
[Applause and cheering]

1353
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:00,247
Yo, Joey, he did it,
man, he actually walked.

1354
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:04,786
[Laughs] I do make
a pretty good supermodel
if I do say so myself.

1355
01:22:04,821 --> 01:22:06,453
Shut up.

1356
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:07,822
Better put on your jacket, dude.

1357
01:22:07,857 --> 01:22:12,127
Yeah, Madison is P.O.'d

1358
01:22:12,162 --> 01:22:14,747
You ok, man?

1359
01:22:14,782 --> 01:22:17,992
Yeah, totally.

1360
01:22:18,027 --> 01:22:21,167
You know you don'

1361
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:23,970
You don't owe us anything

1362
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:26,875
If you're having
second thoughts about it, man,
just say it, and we walk.

1363
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,672
No.

1364
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:35,615
Dude...

1365
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,952
we sold out.

1366
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:41,990
Ow, I'm not saying
it's a bad thing, I mean...

1367
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:44,324
Even green day sold out.

1368
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,562
Yeah, I mean, I mean, everybody
does stuff that they're not
proud of to get what they want.

1369
01:22:47,597 --> 01:22:50,465
Just didn't think the sell-out
phase of our career would happen

1370
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,901
Before the "career" phase
of our career phase happened.

1371
01:22:52,936 --> 01:22:55,435
Ow, ow...

1372
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,701
see, it doesn't

1373
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:06,713
Dude... go.

1374
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:11,519
[Cheering]

1375
01:23:11,554 --> 01:23:13,019
Joey?

1376
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:16,024
Where's Joey going,
we're on in a few minutes.

1377
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:19,794
Uh, Joey?

1378
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:23,530
Joey who?

1379
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,400
Joey: hey...

1380
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:28,937
so you guys are really closing?

1381
01:23:28,972 --> 01:23:32,906
Yeah.

1382
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:34,442
Why don't I just...

1383
01:23:34,477 --> 01:23:36,943
Mom?

1384
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:39,481
Too bad you missed our, uh,
Going-Out-Of-Business sale.

1385
01:23:39,516 --> 01:23:40,982
We were giving out
a lot of great deals.

1386
01:23:41,017 --> 01:23:41,948
Ally, please.

1387
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,735
Not that you would
need anything, judging by...

1388
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,487
what I saw the other night
at the rehearsal.

1389
01:23:45,522 --> 01:23:47,555
Will you please
just let me explain?

1390
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,024
[Whispers]: Joey?

1391
01:23:49,059 --> 01:23:50,423
What are you doing?

1392
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:52,726
You don't have to, Joey.

1393
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:55,613
She's beautiful and
influential, I get it.

1394
01:23:55,648 --> 01:23:58,431
No, it's not about her,
it's about you

1395
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:02,437
People spend their whole lives
trying to find what we found
in each other.

1396
01:24:02,472 --> 01:24:06,441
Some people never do.

1397
01:24:06,476 --> 01:24:08,975
I screwed up.

1398
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:13,615
Boys are dumb, all right?
[Cheering in background]

1399
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:15,617
Not that's an excuse
for me, just an apology.

1400
01:24:15,652 --> 01:24:17,669
A lame one.

1401
01:24:17,704 --> 01:24:19,652
I know.

1402
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:24,657
Look, I just...

1403
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:29,664
I hope that when,
if you're ready...

1404
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:33,933
Maybe we can start over.

1405
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:40,168
You know, not many people
get a second chance.

1406
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:48,114
So you should get down there.

1407
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:52,020
It's too big an opportunity
for you to pass up,
so play the song.

1408
01:24:52,055 --> 01:24:55,290
Seriously, it's ok, it's yours

1409
01:24:55,325 --> 01:24:59,459
Oh, and, uh...

1410
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:03,298
in case yours breaks.

1411
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:04,564
Joey, Joey?

1412
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:08,468
This is far too important
to screw up.

1413
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:10,939
Wish I would've
figured that out a lot sooner.

1414
01:25:10,974 --> 01:25:13,339
Joey, Joey?
[Cheering in background]

1415
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:17,512
And now, the moment
you're all been waiting for...

1416
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:19,946
Madison: not yet!

1417
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:24,998
In just a second,
[laughs nervously], so...

1418
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:30,016
...summer slam sounds better
than winter slam.

1419
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:35,563
Look, I know it's not enough
just to say it, but...

1420
01:25:35,598 --> 01:25:37,531
I'm sorry.

1421
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:42,270
What is his problem?

1422
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:44,537
Never mind.

1423
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,574
We'll do it without him.

1424
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:48,093
Ok, go, go.

1425
01:25:48,128 --> 01:25:49,542
Ok and now...

1426
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:52,881
the moment you have
all been waiting. [Laughs]

1427
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:54,147
Hello, places?

1428
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:55,884
Sorry, toots, no Joey, no, go.

1429
01:25:55,919 --> 01:25:56,883
What?

1430
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:59,587
We're a band, babe,
we stick together.

1431
01:25:59,622 --> 01:26:01,322
So we're not selling out?

1432
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:02,023
Get back here.

1433
01:26:02,058 --> 01:26:02,856
Madison.

1434
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,224
Don't you dare
walk off the stage.

1435
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:09,856
Get back here, do you hear me?
[Light applause]

1436
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,704
Hi.

1437
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:21,708
Man: where's the band?

1438
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:24,579
[Whispers]: six, seven, eight.

1439
01:26:24,614 --> 01:26:26,548
When gray

1440
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:28,448
Meets light

1441
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:32,654
It creates new colors that

1442
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:35,140
Stay lost

1443
01:26:35,175 --> 01:26:37,557
Inside

1444
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:40,361
[Scattered laughter]

1445
01:26:40,396 --> 01:26:43,431
Now who's stepped on?

1446
01:26:43,466 --> 01:26:45,717
Hey, what's going on?

1447
01:26:45,752 --> 01:26:47,411
Train wreck, dude.

1448
01:26:47,446 --> 01:26:49,070
Serves her right.

1449
01:26:49,105 --> 01:26:51,104
Slow motion

1450
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:53,840
Am I living now?

1451
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,542
[Scattered laughter]

1452
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:05,752
Out...

1453
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:11,125
'cause I can't
hide me from you

1454
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,151
And I'm not afraid

1455
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,641
Some...

1456
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:33,648
[scattered laughter]

1457
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:38,152
Some...

1458
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:50,387
A world that you're never
seen before

1459
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:56,237
Starts moving in slow motion

1460
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:58,306
Am I living now?

1461
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:02,210
Out loud

1462
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:12,385
And I'm not afraid somehow

1463
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,592
To let you
see right through me, wait

1464
01:28:17,627 --> 01:28:23,081
I must be dreaming
wide awake

1465
01:28:23,116 --> 01:28:28,536
I must be dreaming
wide awake.

1466
01:28:28,571 --> 01:28:32,472
[Song ends]

1467
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:36,374
[Applause...]

1468
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:41,493
[Sighs]

1469
01:28:41,528 --> 01:28:44,241
Um...

1470
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:46,721
ladies and gentlemen...

1471
01:28:46,756 --> 01:28:48,621
Ally Shepherd.

1472
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:55,563
[Applause and cheering]

1473
01:28:55,598 --> 01:28:58,531
Hi, uh, everybody.

1474
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:04,572
I guess I'm gonna play a song
that I wrote.

1475
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:06,563
With a friend.

1476
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:26,550
On my way

1477
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:30,631
Though I don't know where
I'm going

1478
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:34,135
On a road that's dark

1479
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:38,240
And long

1480
01:29:38,275 --> 01:29:42,275
On my way

1481
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:46,748
But I'm fearful that
I could be lost

1482
01:29:46,783 --> 01:29:50,017
That the path I have chosen

1483
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:55,011
Might be wrong

1484
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,424
When will it be clear

1485
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:03,564
That I made
the right choice?

1486
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:06,466
When I can be sure

1487
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:10,636
That I know my own voice?

1488
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:14,675
Dream of a day
when I'm free from doubt

1489
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:19,394
And faith wins out

1490
01:30:19,429 --> 01:30:24,078
And I overcome my fear

1491
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:36,493
Joey: here...

1492
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:48,341
I don't know

1493
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:51,879
I don't know where to
search for answers

1494
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:55,900
In a world that

1495
01:30:55,935 --> 01:30:59,852
Isn't fair...

1496
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:04,657
will I find my strength

1497
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,995
And discover who
I've been, yeah?

1498
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:12,066
Or retreat and pretend that

1499
01:31:12,101 --> 01:31:16,569
I don't care

1500
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:20,006
When will it be clear...

1501
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:24,045
that I made
the right choice?

1502
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,049
When can I be sure...

1503
01:31:28,084 --> 01:31:31,984
that I know my own voice?

1504
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:35,857
Both: I dream of a day
when I'm free from doubt

1505
01:31:35,892 --> 01:31:40,412
When faith wins out

1506
01:31:40,447 --> 01:31:44,932
And I overcome my fear

1507
01:31:44,967 --> 01:31:49,596
Clear...

1508
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,907
I've been told

1509
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:57,411
That we learn from
our mistakes

1510
01:31:57,446 --> 01:32:01,380
But I just don't know

1511
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:06,203
How many mistakes it takes

1512
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:10,083
Oh, I'm trying so hard

1513
01:32:10,118 --> 01:32:14,041
To let down my guard

1514
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:17,965
Maybe right now...

1515
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,637
right here...

1516
01:32:22,672 --> 01:32:26,405
clear...

1517
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,244
that I made the right choice

1518
01:32:30,279 --> 01:32:34,247
Sure...

1519
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:38,117
that I know my own voice

1520
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:42,290
Praise the day
when I'm free from doubt

1521
01:32:42,325 --> 01:32:46,294
When faith wins out

1522
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:48,261
And I overcome

1523
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:53,634
My fear... (yeah, yeah)

1524
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:57,400
Clear...

1525
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:03,609
mm-Mm

1526
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:07,895
Clear, yeah

1527
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:12,147
Clear...

1528
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:17,123
[song ends]

1529
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:22,687
[Applause and cheering...]

1530
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:35,865
[Ally laughs] a lot of you
may recognize this next song.

1531
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:38,208
This one's for you, Mom.

1532
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:49,357
Turn up the volume

1533
01:33:49,392 --> 01:33:52,358
Open the door

1534
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:54,293
Want a little something

1535
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:56,489
And want a little
something more

1536
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:59,233
Don't look for easy

1537
01:33:59,268 --> 01:34:01,367
Easy comes hard

1538
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:03,436
Take the road less traveled

1539
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,406
But don't forget
your own backyard

1540
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:07,874
Rattle some cages

1541
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:10,728
Don't have to play nice

1542
01:34:10,763 --> 01:34:13,045
Ask a million questions

1543
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,216
Mia: but never ask
the same thing twice

1544
01:34:15,251 --> 01:34:20,054
No indecision
that time has passed

1545
01:34:20,089 --> 01:34:22,021
Go a little crazy

1546
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:23,891
And find a way to
make it last

1547
01:34:23,926 --> 01:34:26,494
You can move right up to

1548
01:34:26,529 --> 01:34:29,028
The head of the class

1549
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:33,734
But not if you sit on
your big, fat, whoo

1550
01:34:33,769 --> 01:34:36,570
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1551
01:34:36,605 --> 01:34:39,071
Let 'em know you were here

1552
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:41,609
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1553
01:34:41,644 --> 01:34:43,744
Let 'em know you were here

1554
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:45,277
If you stop and think

1555
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:48,214
Your chance will disappear

1556
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:50,918
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1557
01:34:50,953 --> 01:34:53,386
Let them know you were here

1558
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:59,610
More like you mean it

1559
01:34:59,645 --> 01:35:02,222
Less like you should

1560
01:35:02,257 --> 01:35:04,764
Try a new direction

1561
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:07,134
And that's alright,
that it's all good

1562
01:35:07,169 --> 01:35:09,737
No inhibition

1563
01:35:09,772 --> 01:35:12,271
Arms open wide

1564
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:13,773
Reach a little higher

1565
01:35:13,808 --> 01:35:16,143
Then find some funk down
deep inside

1566
01:35:16,178 --> 01:35:18,612
You might wake up famous

1567
01:35:18,647 --> 01:35:20,579
And filthy rich

1568
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:26,220
But not if all you do
is sit around and whoo

1569
01:35:26,255 --> 01:35:28,422
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1570
01:35:28,457 --> 01:35:30,222
Let 'em know you were here

1571
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:33,294
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1572
01:35:33,329 --> 01:35:35,795
Let 'em know you were here

1573
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:40,501
If you stop and think,
your chance will disappear

1574
01:35:40,536 --> 01:35:42,837
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1575
01:35:42,872 --> 01:35:46,170
Let them know you were here

1576
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:51,777
Don't just stand there

1577
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:56,383
If you don'
like what you see

1578
01:35:56,418 --> 01:35:58,751
No-No-No-No

1579
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:01,138
Change the channel,
change the channel

1580
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:03,491
Change the world,
change the world

1581
01:36:03,526 --> 01:36:06,828
As long as you try

1582
01:36:06,863 --> 01:36:10,096
You'll be free

1583
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:12,867
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1584
01:36:12,902 --> 01:36:15,835
Let 'em know you were here

1585
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:17,705
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1586
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:20,040
Let 'em know you were here

1587
01:36:20,075 --> 01:36:22,174
If you stop and think

1588
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:24,011
Your chance will disappear
(don't hold back)

1589
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:27,281
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1590
01:36:27,316 --> 01:36:30,149
Let them know you were here

1591
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:32,653
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1592
01:36:32,688 --> 01:36:34,086
Let 'em know you were here

1593
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:37,191
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1594
01:36:37,226 --> 01:36:39,492
Let 'em know you were here

1595
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:43,898
If you stop and think,
your chance will disappear

1596
01:36:43,933 --> 01:36:46,198
Don't hold back
make some noise

1597
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:49,987
Let them know you were,
let them know you were

1598
01:36:50,022 --> 01:36:53,741
Let them know you were,
let them know you were

1599
01:36:53,776 --> 01:36:59,613
Let them know you were,
let them know...

1600
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,046
you were here.

1601
01:37:01,081 --> 01:37:06,212
[Applause and cheering...]

1602
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:15,262
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

1603
01:37:15,297 --> 01:37:18,697
Come on, come on, get your,
get your rock on

1604
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:22,269
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it,
that's what you want

1605
01:37:22,304 --> 01:37:27,239
Come on, come on, get your,
get your rock on

1606
01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:32,178
Everybody got their own music
playing 'round in their head

1607
01:37:32,213 --> 01:37:38,243
But when we all bring it
together, ain't nothing better,
ain't nothing better

1608
01:37:42,756 --> 01:37:45,759
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

1609
01:37:45,794 --> 01:37:48,761
Come on, come on, get your,
get your rock on

1610
01:37:48,796 --> 01:37:52,299
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

1611
01:37:52,334 --> 01:37:55,267
Come on, come on, get your,
get your rock on

1612
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:58,806
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it
that's what you want

1613
01:37:58,841 --> 01:38:02,060
Come on, come on, get your,
get your rock on

1614
01:38:02,095 --> 01:38:05,438
Come on, come on, get your,
get your rock on

1615
01:38:05,473 --> 01:38:08,863
Come on, come on, get your,
get your rock on

1616
01:38:08,898 --> 01:38:12,093
Come on, come on, get your,
get your rock on

1617
01:38:12,128 --> 01:38:15,289
Come on, come on, get your,
get your rock on

1618
01:38:15,324 --> 01:38:17,791
[Songs ends]

1619
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:28,585
When gray

1620
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,803
Meets light

1621
01:38:30,838 --> 01:38:33,841
It creates new colors that

1622
01:38:33,876 --> 01:38:36,094
Stay lost

1623
01:38:36,129 --> 01:38:38,277
Inside

1624
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:42,065
Till they find
each other, then

1625
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:45,819
A world that you
never seen before

1626
01:38:45,854 --> 01:38:49,823
Starts moving in slow motion

1627
01:38:49,858 --> 01:38:51,325
Am I living now?

1628
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,816
Out loud

1629
01:38:57,364 --> 01:39:01,834
I'm not afraid somehow

1630
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:05,372
To let you see
right through me

1631
01:39:05,407 --> 01:39:07,374
I must be dreaming

1632
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:11,811
Wide awake

1633
01:39:12,346 --> 01:39:12,835
[Song ends]

1634
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:23,846
At the mall

1635
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:27,384
At the mall

1636
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:30,386
At the mall

1637
01:39:30,898 --> 01:39:34,401
At the mall, at the mall,
at the mall

1638
01:39:34,436 --> 01:39:37,905
Hanging with your friend at
the mall

1639
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:39,395
Circulate and spend

1640
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:42,643
You can be real,
loosen up, what's the deal

1641
01:39:42,678 --> 01:39:45,379
Hit your stride as you glide
down the hall

1642
01:39:45,414 --> 01:39:47,846
At the mall

1643
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:51,385
Doing what you please
at the mall

1644
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:52,851
Possibilities

1645
01:39:52,886 --> 01:39:56,123
Lost in a crowd,
all shouting out loud

1646
01:39:56,158 --> 01:39:59,360
You can scheme, you can dream
at the call

1647
01:39:59,395 --> 01:40:00,912
[Phone rings]

1648
01:40:00,947 --> 01:40:02,394
At the mall

1649
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:07,423
At the mall, at the mall,
at the mall
