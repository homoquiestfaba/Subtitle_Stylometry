1
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:26,086
Now, that is a thing of beauty.

2
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:28,523
Only you get tomatoes
like that, Tony.

3
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:29,828
Thanks, Henry.

4
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:30,742
I don't even want to eat this,

5
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,179
it's such a work of art.

6
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:33,528
All right, I will take
12 of those, please.

7
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,964
Sounds good.

8
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:36,008
You hosting a dinner party?

9
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,837
No, I'm filling in last minute

10
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,969
for a cooking class.

11
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,013
It's been a while.

12
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:43,190
Henry Ross
teaching a cooking class?

13
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,061
Those are some lucky students.

14
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,497
Thanks, Tony!

15
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:52,590
Hey, it's Maggie.
I got your message.

16
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,114
Um...

17
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,898
The whole file should be...

18
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:56,855
Hold on.

19
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:01,208
The whole file
is just sitting on my desk.

20
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,775
We're detectives, Bailey.
I'm sure we can locate a file.

21
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,257
Ugh...

22
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,476
I've got to call you back.

23
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:11,914
Henry!

24
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:13,568
Hey, there you are.

25
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:15,439
Here you go, the cream
for the creme brulees

26
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,224
and the good vanilla extract
that you like.

27
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,399
Thank you, Lucy.

28
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:19,487
Ooh, this is your suit

29
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,401
for the gala tomorrow night.

30
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:21,489
Make sure we get

31
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:22,403
some great pictures
of you walking in

32
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:23,665
for the blog.

33
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,493
We also got an offer
from a casino in Vegas

34
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:27,495
to consult
on a medieval-themed dinner.

35
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:28,496
How many guests?

36
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,280
Four to five hundred.

37
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,239
A couple days
pool-side in Vegas?

38
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:33,718
If they throw in
the penthouse suite,

39
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:35,024
I'm in.

40
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,199
Thought you might say that.

41
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:39,420
Hey, guys!

42
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,205
I'm home.

43
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,206
Hey, Mom.

44
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,208
Hi, honey.

45
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,557
How was school?

46
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:47,558
It was good.

47
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,212
Good.

48
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,171
I am running late.

49
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,955
Mwah!

50
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:53,912
I guess it's going
to be spaghetti again.

51
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,000
Sorry.

52
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:56,176
I'll get dinner.

53
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,264
You start getting ready
for your date.

54
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:58,221
Are you sure?

55
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,440
Positive.

56
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:00,963
Thanks, Mom,
I literally have 20 minutes

57
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,225
to make this happen.

58
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,792
Well, make yourself beautiful,

59
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:04,836
like you are.

60
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,881
Thank you!

61
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:07,796
Oh, and Peter duquette called.

62
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,363
He wants to meet
tomorrow at noon

63
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,233
down by the wharf.

64
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:13,541
That's strange.
Did he say what it's about?

65
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:16,283
He wouldn't tell me,
but he sounded really upset.

66
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,938
He did, huh?

67
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,940
Well, tell him yes,
of course, I'll meet with him.

68
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,246
All right, let's hurry back.

69
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,813
I've got to start
prepping for tonight.

70
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,258
Okay, what do you think?

71
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:36,781
Too job interview-y, or...?

72
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:39,131
What about your red dress?

73
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,437
I hung it on your mirror.

74
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,612
Yeah, that was subtle, Mom.

75
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,092
I don't think this guy

76
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,615
is, like, a red dress
kind of guy.

77
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,269
Then why are you going
on a second date with him?

78
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:50,578
Because I don't have
a lot of practice at this,

79
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,493
and... I don't know,
it's polite

80
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:53,842
to give a guy a second chance.

81
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:57,280
Maybe we'll magically find
something in common.

82
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:59,282
Oh, I wish I was staying home
and eating with you guys.

83
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:00,849
We will save you
some. Go!

84
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,067
Kick up your heels!

85
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,417
Why aren't you wearing heels?

86
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,288
'Cause I hate heels.
You know that.

87
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:06,333
They hurt my feet.

88
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,813
Your mother is a lost cause.

89
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:10,772
I heard that!

90
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,358
Let me help you
with your jacket.

91
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,187
Just... give me a second
to unhook it.

92
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:36,841
Okay, let's get started.

93
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:38,234
Now, I'm very excited

94
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,932
for this evening's
guest teacher.

95
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:43,848
You know him
from his hugely popular blog,

96
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:45,850
"the gourmet detective."

97
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,548
I'm thrilled to welcome

98
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,550
to Mike's chopping block
kitchen tonight,

99
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:50,855
the gourmet detective himself,

100
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,683
my good friend, Henry Ross.

101
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:53,945
Thank you.

102
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,430
Excuse me.

103
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:03,912
What is
a gourmet detective, exactly?

104
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,610
Well...

105
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:10,353
Let's say
you're a billion-dollar company,

106
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:12,007
and a drought half way
around the world

107
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,835
jeopardizes the key ingredient

108
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,489
in your number-one-selling
food line.

109
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:18,361
Millions of dollars
are at stake.

110
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:22,234
Now, if someone could provide
the key substitute ingredient

111
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:23,410
that no one could tell
was different...

112
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:26,064
True story, by the way...

113
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,589
You might not only
call him a detective,

114
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:32,070
you'd probably call him
a pretty good one.

115
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,380
But you're still not dealing
with actual dead bodies,

116
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:39,121
just to be clear.

117
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:41,166
No offense.

118
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,821
Not so far.

119
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,127
Now...

120
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,607
Who here loves to cook?

121
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:48,870
I do!

122
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,872
Let's get started.

123
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,583
Maggie! It's burning!

124
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,672
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry!

125
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:10,761
You can't turn your back
while you're cooking.

126
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,286
One of the many conveniences
of the microwave.

127
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,853
Don't worry, you two,
it happens.

128
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,029
It's why I always make extra.

129
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:19,074
Thank goodness.

130
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:20,118
Thanks.

131
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,163
I am starving.

132
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,209
Mm. Wow!

133
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:26,821
The salt from Turkey

134
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:28,126
makes all the difference
in the world!

135
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,780
Doesn't it?

136
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,956
This is delicious, okay,

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,218
but let's be real.

138
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,220
I barely have time
to get dinner on the table,

139
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,570
much less be running
around the city

140
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:37,571
looking for turkish salt.

141
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:38,876
Fair enough.

142
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,704
If you're stressed for time,
you can't do it all,

143
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:43,446
but that's why paying attention
to the little things,

144
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,056
like the temperature
on your burner,

145
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,623
is so critical.

146
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,016
The more alert
you are in the kitchen,

147
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,497
the more alert you may be
in real life.

148
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,672
Okay...

149
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:52,977
Is this the time
when you tell us

150
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:55,153
about your incredible
observational powers

151
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:57,417
and how they saved Starbucks
from going under?

152
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:03,205
Right.

153
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:13,955
You, sir.

154
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,479
You bought that jacket
at a thrift store,

155
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,220
didn't you?

156
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:20,091
It's a 42 regular.
You're clearly a 44 long.

157
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:21,658
And the shoulder
has been faded by the sun

158
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:22,703
where it hung in
the store window for too long.

159
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,096
But it's Hugo boss,
so you figured,

160
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,837
"hey, why not?
Who's going to notice?"

161
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,276
You, ma'am...
You have two cats,

162
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,757
one a calico,
the other a persian,

163
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,367
and judging
from the traces of hair

164
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:36,847
on your right sleeve,

165
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:37,848
you're also right-handed,

166
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:39,676
and you use that hand
to pet them

167
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,722
while you're watching TV
on the couch.

168
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,027
He's right.

169
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,072
How about us?

170
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:49,033
I, uh...

171
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:51,732
Generally don't like
commenting on couples.

172
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,690
Go on.

173
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,436
I'm just not sure
she's over the divorce yet.

174
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,307
How do you know
that I'm divorced?

175
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,135
You keep rubbing
your ring finger.

176
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:08,226
And judging by the homemade

177
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,924
yet slightly
complicated bracelet,

178
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,143
you have a young girl at home...

179
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,884
I'm guessing maybe 12 or 13.

180
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,017
I bet she's openly supportive
of you dating again,

181
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,801
but secretly loves having you
all to herself.

182
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,937
Am I in the ballpark?

183
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,358
Hi!

184
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:56,927
Still up?

185
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,538
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

186
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,930
Aw.

187
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,236
So, how was it?

188
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,196
Well...

189
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,981
We parted as friends.

190
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,027
Truthfully, I don't think
I'm going to be going

191
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:11,638
on any more dates any time soon.

192
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:12,943
Oh...

193
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,424
Well, I just want
to let you know

194
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,207
that I'm okay with it if you do.

195
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,863
Are you sure?

196
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:23,998
It's been over a year
since you and dad...

197
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:26,783
You know, grandma says it's good

198
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:29,307
for you to get out there
and have some fun,

199
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,395
and I just want you to know

200
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:31,179
that I'm okay with the idea.

201
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:33,834
Come here.

202
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:37,881
Thank you.

203
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:40,841
You know
you're the most important thing

204
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:41,842
in my life, Abby.

205
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,148
Yeah, I know.

206
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,716
Try to get some sleep, okay?

207
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,371
Good night.

208
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,333
Mom?

209
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,031
Yes?

210
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:58,598
Do you think dad will be able
to come to my chess tournament?

211
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,907
I know
he really wants to be there.

212
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,213
And I know he's going
to try. It's...

213
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,431
Yeah, I know.

214
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,695
Work might get in the way.

215
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:13,874
I love you.

216
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:29,977
Oh, I'm looking forward to this!

217
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,675
These are the best fish tacos
in town.

218
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,634
Pauline, your uncle and I,
we've been coming here

219
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,157
for 20 years.

220
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,202
That's how good these tacos are.

221
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:39,203
Mm!

222
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:41,728
Mm-mm-mm!

223
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:44,513
So, why don't you fill me in

224
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,514
on what's going on?

225
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,558
What's with all the mystery?

226
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,909
Someone is sabotaging
my restaurant.

227
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,999
What do you mean by sabotage?

228
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,435
Shipments have been diverted,

229
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:56,960
always vital ingredients
for specific popular dishes.

230
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,701
The labels on spices
have been swapped.

231
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,137
Rats were found in my pantry

232
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,705
on the morning of a visit
from a food inspector.

233
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,664
And you, of all people,
know I run a clean kitchen.

234
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,317
And that's not all.

235
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,972
The other night, they stabbed
a picture of us with a knife,

236
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,626
left it as some kind of message.

237
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,497
I'm worried about our safety,

238
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,325
but I can't go to the police

239
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:15,413
because if they're involved,

240
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:16,458
the public might hear

241
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,416
about the rats
and the cockroaches,

242
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,591
and then I will have
to close down,

243
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:20,418
and that's exactly
what this person wants.

244
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,290
So how can I help?

245
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,726
You are going
to the gala tonight?

246
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,424
Yes, of course.

247
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:28,209
This is a huge night for us.

248
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:31,821
It would be a public nightmare
if anything were to happen.

249
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,346
That's why we want to hire you,

250
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,045
to look into what's been
happening at Chez duquette.

251
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:40,177
Hire me?

252
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,005
Peter,
I'm not a private investigator.

253
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,441
You know the restaurant business

254
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:44,660
inside and out,

255
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,009
and mine specifically.

256
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:47,097
And you know every major player

257
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:48,098
in the city.

258
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,144
And because of our relationship,

259
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,275
no one will suspect anything

260
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:52,494
if you're seen hanging around,

261
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:53,625
watching what happens
at the restaurant.

262
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:56,367
Please...

263
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,068
I don't know
who else I can turn to.

264
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:23,699
Thank you.

265
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,050
Pauline!

266
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,486
Everything running smoothly?

267
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,574
So far so good.

268
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,880
All deliveries
arrived correctly.

269
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,099
The kitchen seems
to be running on time.

270
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,450
I'll take you back.

271
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:36,712
All right.

272
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,327
Raymond bishop is here?

273
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,155
You know, after all these years,

274
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,678
your uncle
has still never told me

275
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,115
what their feud is about.

276
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:49,464
I know, but what can we do?

277
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,988
Raymond owns filmore bistro

278
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,468
and is part of the association,

279
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,383
so he automatically
gets an invitation.

280
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,173
Service, please!

281
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:07,395
Klaus, can I speak
to you for a minute?

282
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:09,223
Henry, good to see you.

283
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,007
You, too, Klaus.

284
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,182
Henry's going to be helping us

285
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,140
with our "problems."

286
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:14,184
Well, thank god for that.

287
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,707
I can't be everywhere at once,

288
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,013
catching every slip-up.

289
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,754
Well, I will leave
you two to it.

290
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,842
All right.

291
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:20,887
I've got to go back out front.

292
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:28,285
Everybody's reputation
is on the line here.

293
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,634
I don't know what to do.

294
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,375
These aren't accidents.

295
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,856
Health inspectors don't usually
announce their visits.

296
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,858
How would somebody know
when to plant the rats?

297
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,555
Our inspectors
keep a rigid schedule.

298
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,861
We Mark him on the calendar.

299
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,689
So only somebody

300
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,212
familiar with this restaurant
and its operation

301
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,910
could have known
the inspector's date?

302
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,607
That's what I'm worried about.

303
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,652
And all of the delivery mishaps,

304
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,480
the access to files and labels,

305
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,265
would require
the same insider knowledge?

306
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:53,223
Exactly.

307
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,094
I see.

308
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,058
Pauline, how is
everything going this evening?

309
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:03,799
So far, so good.

310
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,583
Sally, have you met
Layton Leopold?

311
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:06,367
He's the chef at filmore bistro.

312
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,371
I don't believe I have.

313
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:12,373
You're the cook book author
that says eating out

314
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,070
is a complete waste
of time and money, right?

315
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:15,637
Oh...

316
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,812
Well...

317
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,248
Why don't you come by
the restaurant?

318
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,510
I'll prepare you something

319
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,425
that will make you
eat your words.

320
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,688
Sounds like a challenge.

321
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:24,776
It is.

322
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:28,084
Okay.

323
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:29,129
See you at dinner.

324
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,178
Thank you.

325
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,763
Henry, can I have
a word with you, please?

326
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,460
Of course, Raymond.

327
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:57,940
How are things
at filmore bistro?

328
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,463
Not good.

329
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:01,422
Something strange
is happening at my restaurant.

330
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:02,640
What do you mean?

331
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:03,815
Shipments are going missing.

332
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,513
End of the night receipts
don't add up.

333
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:08,472
Ingredients are ending up
in the wrong containers.

334
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,692
I may be paranoid,

335
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,128
but it's almost
as if I'm being...

336
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,303
Sabotaged.

337
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,484
Gentlemen,
we're starting the meal.

338
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:21,746
Can we continue this later?

339
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,009
Yes, of course, Raymond.

340
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:33,541
No, steak should
never be paired with lobster.

341
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,151
The only reason that it is

342
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,849
is so that restaurants can use
the term "surf and turf."

343
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,462
Americans love catchy titles.

344
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:43,072
Well, you should know
about catchy titles, Sally.

345
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,073
Ooh...

346
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:46,510
Oh!

347
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,860
Ah, now look at that!

348
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:51,907
This, Sally, is why you eat out.

349
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,561
This is the kind of thing
we need on our menu, Raymond.

350
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,780
If you would just listen to me,

351
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:58,522
we could make
bold choices like this

352
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,568
without alienating
our customers.

353
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:02,352
Or you could go buy
your own restaurant

354
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,745
and cook whatever you like.

355
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:06,574
But for the meantime,
I pay you to cook my menu.

356
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:10,621
Well!

357
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,191
Wow. Look at this.

358
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,585
So this is
the lamprey bordelaise.

359
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:19,326
It's very bold of Klaus

360
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:20,805
to serve lamprey
with this crowd.

361
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:22,024
What do you think, Oliver?

362
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,069
It's good.

363
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,722
Klaus is smart

364
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:25,941
to have the wine
accompany the sauce,

365
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,551
and not the eel.

366
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,946
Bet you never
cooked lamprey on your show.

367
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,557
How is everything?

368
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:34,819
Fantastic, pauline.
Well done.

369
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:35,907
Good, I'm glad.

370
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:37,083
I hope the eel

371
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,999
isn't too adventurous
for you, Raymond.

372
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,478
I know you like to keep things
basic at the bistro.

373
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,958
Oh, not at all, pauline.

374
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,700
No, no, I understand
your uncle needs

375
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,397
to distract his clientele
with flash.

376
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:48,703
Okay, here it goes,
here it goes...

377
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,270
All right, all right, you two,

378
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:51,532
let's just enjoy the meal.

379
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,273
You both own
wonderful restaurants,

380
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:54,535
and the good news is,

381
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:57,625
the city is big enough
for both your egos.

382
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:58,800
Let's toast to big egos!

383
00:16:58,843 --> 00:16:59,844
Hear, hear.

384
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,063
Cheers.

385
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,154
Hear, hear!

386
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:09,811
Wait, wait!

387
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:11,813
Okay, go.

388
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,181
Excuse me, everyone.

389
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:34,053
May I have your attention?

390
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,794
My name is Ian jenkin.

391
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:39,406
I'm sure many of you
are familiar

392
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,364
with my investigative
news show...

393
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,541
What is this about?

394
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:46,239
I have no idea.

395
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:48,850
I've been working
on an investigation

396
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,070
for several weeks now.

397
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:54,725
What I'm about to reveal to you

398
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,075
will shock many of you
in this room.

399
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,033
Tonight...

400
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:01,428
I've put it together.

401
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,343
I finally have the proof.

402
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,348
I can prove that...

403
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,307
I can prove...

404
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,391
It was absolutely terrifying.

405
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,221
The deceased's name
is Ian jenkin, 44.

406
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,179
He's an investigative reporter
for channel seven news.

407
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:59,442
The one who took down
the deputy mayor last year?

408
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:00,356
That's the one.

409
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,054
Do we have a cause of death?

410
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:04,360
Well, it isn't clear,

411
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:05,448
although if you notice

412
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:06,884
the bluish tinge
around his mouth,

413
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:10,061
it could be indicative
of any number of conditions,

414
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,802
viral infection,

415
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,630
heart attack,
pulmonary embolism...

416
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,197
Any prescription bottles
in his pockets

417
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,068
to suggest a medical condition?

418
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:18,200
Nothing in his pockets...

419
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,897
Checked myself.

420
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:20,985
Witnesses say

421
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,683
that Mr. Jenkin
was making a speech

422
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:23,727
when he became disoriented
and collapsed.

423
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:25,555
There wasn't any sign
of chest pain,

424
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,644
he just hit the floor.

425
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:28,950
Hmm.

426
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:30,212
Could it be food poisoning?

427
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,474
Could be.

428
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:32,910
If it is,

429
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,434
it's one of the most severe
cases I've ever seen.

430
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,218
Okay, well, until you give us
the toxicology results,

431
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,133
we'd better treat this
like a suspicious death.

432
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:43,747
I can't believe he's dead.

433
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,228
Are you all right?
Can I get you anything?

434
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,229
Excuse me,

435
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,970
are you Mr... Ross?

436
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:51,842
You.

437
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:52,930
I know you.

438
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:55,106
You're the woman from the...

439
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,978
Detective Maggie price.

440
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:58,240
Detective?

441
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,850
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah...

442
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,113
Now it's all coming together.

443
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,811
It's a curious thing, I was...

444
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:05,247
Spare me the long version.

445
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,292
All I want to know is one thing.

446
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,684
Were you a witness
to what happened?

447
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,512
Well, yes, I was.

448
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:11,384
Hmm.

449
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:16,780
Mm!

450
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,478
That might be

451
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,784
the worst cup of coffee
I've ever tasted in my life.

452
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,525
Oh, could we get you
a latte instead?

453
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:23,700
Oh, would you?

454
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:24,658
No.

455
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:27,704
Did you know
Mr. Jenkin personally?

456
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:30,359
No, I didn't.

457
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:31,447
Do you know anyone

458
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:32,231
that would want to harm jenkin?

459
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:36,757
I take it from this line
of questioning

460
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,932
you're not thinking

461
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:40,064
it's a matter
of a simple fish allergy?

462
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,892
Well, until we get
the toxicology results in,

463
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,242
we're not ruling anything out.

464
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:46,593
Well, obviously,
it wasn't an allergic reaction.

465
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:47,985
And is that based on
your super detective powers,

466
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,117
Mr. Ross?

467
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,555
Uh, no,
just... common sense.

468
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,124
Look, number one,
Mr. Jenkin didn't exhibit

469
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,952
any classic choking signs
of anaphylaxis

470
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:01,303
associated
with severe allergic reactions.

471
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,262
And number two, if Mr. Jenkin
were allergic to fish,

472
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,524
he probably wouldn't be eating
the eel

473
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,482
in the first place,
now, would he?

474
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:07,353
Eel's a fish.

475
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,618
That makes sense.

476
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:12,923
Now, what most people
don't understand...

477
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,187
Who is this guy again?

478
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:17,667
Henry Ross.

479
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,887
He's some kind
of food specialist.

480
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,845
What's that mean?

481
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,847
Here's a copy of his bio
I got from his website.

482
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,414
You'll notice he
started his career

483
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,459
25 years ago...

484
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:28,765
At Chez duquette.

485
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,201
Oh...

486
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,203
Interesting coincidence.

487
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,902
Apparently,
he was quite the chef.

488
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,338
Now he's a consultant

489
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,558
and works for everybody
from small restaurants

490
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:39,950
to large international
food conglomerates.

491
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,518
Sounds like if you have
a problem in the food world,

492
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,564
Henry Ross is your guy.

493
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:46,827
Listen,

494
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,828
what you should be
concerning yourself with

495
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:49,525
is the lamprey.

496
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,962
That is an extremely
dangerous dish to be serving.

497
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,008
King Henry I died
from eating too much of it.

498
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:55,662
At least,
that's the official story...

499
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:58,273
I believe it was
from improper handling.

500
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,144
But if lamprey is
not prepared correctly

501
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,581
and all of the natural
toxin removed,

502
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:05,236
that is a fish
that kills quickly and quietly.

503
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,455
Quickly and quietly, huh?

504
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:08,239
Well, that sounds
like the perfect weapon

505
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:09,937
in the right hands.

506
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:14,245
How long have you been working
for Raymond bishop

507
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,246
at filmore bistro?

508
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,683
Seven or eight years.

509
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:18,293
Tell me about his relationship
with Peter duquette.

510
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,121
They can't stand each other.

511
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:21,557
The thing is with Raymond

512
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:22,906
is that he doesn't
listen to anybody.

513
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,125
He's terrified of change.

514
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:25,387
He's probably threatened
by Peter

515
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,649
because Peter
keeps Chez duquette relevant

516
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,434
by trying new things.

517
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:30,087
Mr. Bishop,

518
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,741
is it true that your restaurant,
filmore bistro,

519
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:34,527
has been experiencing
some strange mishaps?

520
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,137
Things that,
if not caught in time,

521
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,573
could damage your business?

522
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:39,488
Yes, that's true.
How did you know?

523
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:41,098
Is it also true
that you and Peter duquette

524
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:43,144
have a strong public dislike
for one another?

525
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:44,406
I hope the eel

526
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,929
isn't too adventurous
for you, Raymond.

527
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,017
I know you like

528
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:47,975
to keep things
basic at the bistro.

529
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,720
We have a healthy competitive
rivalry, that's all.

530
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:56,070
I understand
if not properly prepared,

531
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:57,767
lamprey can kill.

532
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,639
Seems like a pretty risky meal
to serve to 50 people.

533
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,858
I assure you,
the lamprey was safe.

534
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:03,599
I oversaw every step,

535
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:05,384
from ordering, delivery,
and preparation.

536
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,168
No one had access
to the eel except for me.

537
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:08,299
So you're saying

538
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:10,171
if anyone tampered
with the lamprey,

539
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,128
it had to be you?

540
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,695
Why would I do that?

541
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:13,783
I've spent 20 years

542
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,611
building my career as a chef.

543
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:16,699
This is going to ruin me!

544
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:17,961
Why would I destroy
my own career?

545
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,357
Did you know the victim?

546
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,532
No!

547
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:26,883
I mean, on TV, yeah,
like everyone else.

548
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:30,060
Do you think
he might have had any enemies?

549
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,845
The guy made a living
investigating people.

550
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:33,107
I'm sure he had
a list of enemies.

551
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,674
What about this Henry Ross guy?

552
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:37,851
Do you know him?

553
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,679
Sure, he was
on my cooking show. Why?

554
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,332
Of course, I know Henry.

555
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:44,118
Every owner
in the city knows Henry.

556
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:46,729
I've known him for years.
Why?

557
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:50,864
Henry always had a thing for me.

558
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,043
You call yourself...

559
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:58,872
"The gourmet detective?"

560
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,656
Not this conversation again.

561
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,875
Um...

562
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,572
I didn't come up with it,
someone else did,

563
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:04,921
and it just sort of stuck.

564
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,096
Huh.

565
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:09,230
Mr. Ross,
I am very interested in you.

566
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:11,014
Thank you?

567
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:12,538
Maybe you want to explain to us

568
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,888
why the one name
that keeps coming up is yours.

569
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,324
People like me?

570
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,587
Assuming for a minute
that the deceased was poisoned,

571
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,371
whoever did this
would need to understand

572
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,373
the intricacies
of preparing and serving eel.

573
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:25,028
They would need to understand
lamprey poisoning.

574
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:27,378
Did you know that lamprey
killed king Henry I?

575
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,032
Apparently.

576
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:30,207
Wait a minute...

577
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,992
Am I a suspect here?

578
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:33,167
Until we understand

579
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,690
exactly what we are
dealing with here,

580
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:38,041
all I know is that
there is one common denominator

581
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,869
in all of this...

582
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:40,957
And that's you.

583
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:46,746
Okay, I think
I'd like to talk to my lawyer.

584
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:50,097
Oh, sure, lawyer up.
Nothing suspicious about that.

585
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,577
Price, relax.

586
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:57,931
No, I've got your bio, Mr. Ross,

587
00:24:57,974 --> 00:24:59,889
and I don't see a motive
for you... yet.

588
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:05,460
But I do think that you
could be very useful to us,

589
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,548
especially given
your long-standing history

590
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,899
with Mr. Duquette
and his restaurant.

591
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,641
Now, I would like you
to consult on this case.

592
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,251
Wait, what?

593
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:16,732
I spoke with Mr. Jenkin's
station manager.

594
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:17,994
He was working

595
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,561
on some kind
of a food industry expose,

596
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,128
but nobody knew the details.

597
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,173
Now, that dinner
had every major player

598
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:24,610
in the San Francisco food scene,

599
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:27,526
and if I was a betting woman,

600
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,918
I'd say that the target
of jenkin's investigation

601
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,137
was in that room

602
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,052
and knew that he was onto them.

603
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:35,359
If this turns out to be
a murder investigation,

604
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:37,057
I want you and price
working as a team.

605
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,449
You have invaluable insight

606
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:39,755
and contacts into this industry

607
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,930
that we simply don't have.

608
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,628
Okay, captain,
that is so not necessary.

609
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:45,544
We have more than
enough resources,

610
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,806
we do not need to include, um...

611
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:50,287
Henry.

612
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:51,462
Whatever.

613
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:52,376
Can we please just
think about this?

614
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,769
Ah, see, now,

615
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:54,814
fortunately for you,
I already have.

616
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,380
End of discussion.

617
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:57,556
Okay, look,

618
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,645
I am really flattered
by all of this,

619
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:01,429
but I...

620
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:03,910
I do have a rather substantial
daily fee, so...

621
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:05,302
Let's consider your payment

622
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:06,565
staying off my suspect list
for now.

623
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,609
Done.

624
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:08,567
- Good.
- Okay.

625
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,046
Be here in the morning,

626
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,396
and Maggie can start walking you
through what we know.

627
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,007
Captain,
this is not a great idea, okay?

628
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,748
I am more than capable
of doing this by myself

629
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,532
without dragging him along.

630
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,143
Duly noted.

631
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:21,841
I will see you
in the morning, price...

632
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:23,233
With Mr. Ross.

633
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,688
Good morning!

634
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,080
Morning!

635
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:46,082
I just jotted down
a couple of ideas for the blog

636
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:47,344
for you to research.

637
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:49,651
Excited for your first day
as a real detective?

638
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:51,827
You have no idea.

639
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:52,872
What's in there?

640
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,090
Uh-bup-bup!

641
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:55,875
Just a little treat

642
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:57,572
for everyone
down at the station.

643
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,095
Well, have a good first day.

644
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:00,575
Play nice
with the other detective.

645
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:03,622
Wish me luck.

646
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:14,850
All right.

647
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,724
Toxicology is in.

648
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,377
Think I'm going to take Mr. Ross

649
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,162
on a little trip to the morgue
with me.

650
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:23,903
Whoa, price,

651
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:25,208
you going to scare
the poor man off

652
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:26,253
on his first day?

653
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:27,210
Mm?

654
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:30,431
Well, he's already
20 minutes late,

655
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:31,301
so maybe he'll be a no-show.

656
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,696
Good morning, everyone!

657
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,045
Sorry I'm late.

658
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,266
I was busy making you
some decent coffee.

659
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,572
Detectives!

660
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:43,444
May I interest you
in some monkey parchment?

661
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:45,315
- Monkey what?
- Monkey who?

662
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,927
Only the best coffee
on the planet.

663
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,319
I always find

664
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:51,757
that porcelain make things
taste a little better.

665
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,280
There you are.

666
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,066
Thank you.

667
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,546
I love this moment...

668
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,722
When someone realizes
for the first time

669
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:02,506
they've been drinking dishwater
all their life

670
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,943
and calling it coffee.

671
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:06,032
Well?

672
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:06,946
- Wow.
- Right?

673
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:08,251
Oh man, that's good.

674
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,906
$300 a pound good.

675
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,081
Are you kidding me?

676
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,953
What is in this?

677
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:15,476
This is considered the sweetest,

678
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,520
most complex
Indian arabica coffee

679
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:17,739
ever produced.

680
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:21,221
The beans have been chewed on
and spat out

681
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:23,658
by rhesus monkeys
from the jungles of India.

682
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:26,792
I don't care what's in it.

683
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,141
- It's delicious.
- Cheers.

684
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,882
All right, boys...

685
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,144
You enjoy that monkey spit.

686
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:34,277
You. Let's go.

687
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:36,149
Tell me that is
not your breakfast.

688
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,238
Thanks for the coffee.
It's great.

689
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,456
My pleasure.

690
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,893
Next time, I will
bring you kopi luwak.

691
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:41,894
You definitely
don't want to know

692
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:42,938
where those beans came from.

693
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:44,766
Let's go.

694
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,290
You ever been
to a morgue, Mr. Ross?

695
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,465
Ah... right.

696
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:49,684
About that...

697
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:54,602
If you're going to pass out,

698
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,299
you should probably
sit down, Henry.

699
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:57,561
I'm fine.

700
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,607
Really? 'Cause you look
paler than the victim.

701
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,652
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

702
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,829
Watching you squirm?

703
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,308
Yeah, little bit.

704
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,658
Okay.

705
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:11,140
Well, if you two are finished...

706
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:13,142
Mr. Jenkin died

707
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:14,927
from poisoning by ttb,

708
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,321
otherwise known
as tintilinum botulinum,

709
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:21,585
one of the cousins
of the botulism family.

710
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,718
I thought that botulism
only comes from spoiled food.

711
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,590
No, it can occur
in fish and vegetables, too.

712
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:27,853
Even at room temperatures,

713
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:29,942
spores germinate
into an active bacteria,

714
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,508
which produce a nerve toxin,

715
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:32,988
which usually kills.

716
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:34,381
Cooking temperatures
don't destroy it,

717
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:35,817
not even boiling water,

718
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:36,905
and it can kill
in an hour or less.

719
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:39,778
What?

720
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,564
So this ttb was in the lamprey?

721
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:46,959
Yes, and Mr. Jenkin's
bacteria measurement

722
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,482
was 3.5.

723
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,701
Now, anything over 1.2 is fatal.

724
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,181
That is
an enormous amount of ttb

725
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,139
to ingest in one sitting.

726
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:54,227
Yeah.

727
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,837
Is it even possible for him

728
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:56,838
to have consumed
that much of the toxin

729
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:57,752
from his meal alone?

730
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:00,755
In a word?

731
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,582
No.

732
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,598
Can you please
leave my trash alone?

733
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:22,821
You know, your body is a temple,

734
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,518
but you treat yours
like a dumpster.

735
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:25,562
I mean, don't get me wrong,

736
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,086
you look great
on the outside, but...

737
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:28,043
Hey.

738
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:29,871
Um... we're not buddies.

739
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:30,872
You know that, right?

740
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,395
So what I eat, what's in my car,

741
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:34,223
and especially what my body
looks like,

742
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:35,659
that is none of your business.

743
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,052
So if you have something
that you want to say

744
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:39,011
about the case, that's great.

745
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,839
Otherwise,
keep your comments to yourself.

746
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,449
You know, all I'm saying

747
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:44,930
is maybe, if you tried
eating more real food,

748
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,453
you'd stop tricking your body

749
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:48,281
into thinking
that this processed garbage

750
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:49,673
actually tastes good.

751
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:51,110
Yeah, well,
that's where you're wrong,

752
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:52,067
because it does taste good.

753
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,503
No...

754
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:55,897
You've dulled your tastebuds
into thinking it does

755
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,899
because they're so drugged
on sugar, salt,

756
00:30:57,943 --> 00:30:59,596
nitrates, and preservatives,

757
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,598
that they've lost the ability
to pick out

758
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:02,599
the full spectrum of flavor

759
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,906
available to you
in real foods...

760
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,212
The subtleties, the nuances!

761
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,387
I mean, you're like a person
at the symphony

762
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,344
wearing ear plugs.

763
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,911
Look, I love the idea

764
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,653
of preparing locally-grown,
organic gourmet masterpieces

765
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:14,133
every night...
Who doesn't?

766
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,917
But I live in the real world,

767
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,223
and that means
that I usually have

768
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:19,268
about 12 and a half minutes
to prepare dinner

769
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:21,009
and 10 minutes to eat it

770
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:22,097
before my daughter
has to run off

771
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,490
and do her homework

772
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,534
and I have to hit the computer
to finish the work

773
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:26,101
that didn't get done
at the office

774
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:27,973
because I had to leave early
to go home and make dinner.

775
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,800
So spare me

776
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:31,759
your enlightened
foodie speeches,

777
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:34,675
because that is the last thing
that I need to hear

778
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,503
from some bachelor who has
all the time in the world

779
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:37,591
to just go meandering
around pacific heights

780
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,506
looking for turkish salt.

781
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:46,469
What makes you think
I'm a bachelor?

782
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,255
Lucky guess.

783
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,128
Now, how about
we just keep the conversation

784
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:54,129
about the case, okay?

785
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:55,739
Fine.
Sounds good.

786
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:56,740
Great.

787
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:03,486
How long have you been divorced?

788
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,487
This is Bailey.

789
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:06,228
Hey, Bailey, it's me.

790
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:09,188
The victim had enormous levels
of ttb in his system.

791
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:10,711
We are definitely looking
at a homicide.

792
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,060
A planned murder

793
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,670
made to look like
an accidental food poisoning?

794
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:15,194
Yep, the killer was using
a poisonous fish

795
00:32:15,237 --> 00:32:16,499
to cover the poison.

796
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,153
I think we can assume

797
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:19,067
that Klaus's preparation
of the lamprey eel

798
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:21,765
was safe and toxin free.

799
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,942
I mean, why would he jeopardize
his own career like that?

800
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:25,160
No...

801
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:26,857
The killer cultivated the ttb

802
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:28,772
from a second, separate order
of lamprey

803
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,557
and then somehow injected
the poison into Ian's meal

804
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,515
without anyone noticing.

805
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,821
All right, Bailey,

806
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,518
why don't you talk
to the lamprey distributor

807
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:36,650
who sold the restaurant the eel
and see what you can find out.

808
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,391
Got it.

809
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:39,392
How we doing on the restaurant
surveillance footage?

810
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,046
Nothing there.

811
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:42,786
Someone cut the wires
several days ago.

812
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,005
All right, did we run
background checks

813
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,050
on the kitchen staff?

814
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,181
Everyone came up clear.

815
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:47,661
All right, can you run it again?

816
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:49,010
Just... somebody
must've seen something.

817
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,229
Okay. Got it.

818
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:51,752
What about the flash drive? What
was on that?

819
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:53,058
What flash drive?

820
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:58,237
I saw Oliver Paige,
you know, the chef on TV,

821
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,890
give Ian jenkin
a blue flash drive

822
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:02,676
right before the dinner.

823
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:04,547
And you're just
mentioning this now?

824
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:05,853
I can't think of everything.

825
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,289
But you can take 10 minutes

826
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,899
to lecture me
on my breakfast burrito.

827
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:11,250
Okay, I'll check
for a flash drive in evidence.

828
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:12,468
Thank you, Bailey.
I'll call you back.

829
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:17,430
Anything else
you care to mention?

830
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:18,735
Like, I don't know,

831
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,910
maybe you saw somebody
poison jenkin's meal?

832
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:22,826
No,
it's just like what I told you.

833
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,828
Ian was about to tell
everybody in that room

834
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,134
about something
he had just discovered.

835
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,397
Well, forensics is already
sweeping his house,

836
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:29,572
so, hopefully,

837
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:30,399
we'll find out
what he was working on

838
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:31,400
when we get to his office.

839
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:33,054
All right. Good plan.

840
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,708
I'm so glad you think so.

841
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:40,801
How long have you worked
with Ian jenkin?

842
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:43,238
Worked with?
That's a stretch.

843
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:44,631
Ian kept to himself.

844
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:46,720
But I've known him
almost 10 years,

845
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:48,591
since I started working
here at the station.

846
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,245
Did Mr. Jenkin
have any enemies at work?

847
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:51,551
Anybody who disliked him?

848
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,335
This is a competitive business,

849
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:54,641
and Ian stepped
on more than a few toes

850
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:56,121
to get to where he was,

851
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:58,079
but I don't think he
ticked off anyone enough

852
00:33:58,123 --> 00:33:59,211
that they'd want
to see him dead.

853
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:03,650
This way, please.

854
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:10,091
This is his office.

855
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:12,267
He was rarely here,
always on the road.

856
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:13,703
I understand
Mr. Jenkin

857
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:15,444
was looking into a story
on the food industry

858
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:16,315
before he died.

859
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:19,318
Apparently so.

860
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,712
You know as much as I do.

861
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,279
Ian produced his own segments.

862
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,889
I only ever got involved
in what he was doing

863
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,500
if there were any legal issues

864
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:30,155
that our station lawyers
needed to go over first.

865
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:33,201
Other than that,
he was kind of a one-man show.

866
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:35,377
12, 9:30...

867
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:38,119
$350, a.S.

868
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:40,295
Does any of this
mean anything to you?

869
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:43,298
No, I don't think so.

870
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:45,866
I mean, I know
these restaurants, of course,

871
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,999
but I didn't know
he was investigating them.

872
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,305
Uh...
A.s...

873
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,307
That could be Alex scarponi.

874
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:54,614
He was a photographer
Ian would hire sometimes.

875
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:57,312
He would have paid him
around 350 bucks.

876
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,140
Other than that...

877
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,795
I don't think
I can help any more.

878
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:09,411
Could you get us
scarponi's contact information?

879
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:10,412
Sure.

880
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,075
Lucy, it's me.

881
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,598
I need you to look up something.

882
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:26,646
The name is either
Todd Armand or Armand Todd.

883
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:30,084
We're looking for a connection
between him and Ian jenkin.

884
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,607
All right, I'm on it.

885
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,174
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye.

886
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,219
Yep, sounds good, Bailey.

887
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:35,568
Bye.

888
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:38,832
Scarponi's on a photo shoot
in Italy.

889
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,877
He left this morning and is not
due back 'til next week.

890
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,358
Okay, I have my assistant, Lucy,

891
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:46,187
looking up who Todd Armand is.

892
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,928
Okay, look, I don't need
you or your assistant

893
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,712
doing research for us.

894
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,410
Let the department
handle the investigation.

895
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:53,586
Just trying to help.

896
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:54,413
Wait a second!

897
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,112
You know, Oliver Paige's
cooking show

898
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,157
used to tape here.

899
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,897
I guest-starred on it once.

900
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:03,639
I made this sesame
ginger cornish hen...

901
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:04,814
It was out of this world.

902
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:06,076
And this is relevant because...?

903
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,817
Because...

904
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:10,037
When Ian jenkin asked
for a massive pay raise,

905
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,517
the network didn't have
any money left over.

906
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,910
That's why Oliver's show
was canceled.

907
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:14,781
Oliver's been
out of work ever since.

908
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:16,696
So you think that Oliver

909
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:17,958
could have been angry enough
about that

910
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,439
to poison the guy
who got his show canceled?

911
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:21,614
It's possible.

912
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:29,535
It's possible!

913
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,816
So...

914
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,818
How many kids do you have?

915
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,167
One.

916
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,344
Daughter, right?
I was right, wasn't I?

917
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:58,041
You know, I think
it's your humility

918
00:36:58,085 --> 00:36:59,608
that really draws people to you.

919
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:01,219
Was that a joke?

920
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,655
You made a joke!
See, I knew there was

921
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:04,222
a sense of humor
in there somewhere.

922
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,353
Yeah, because
when I'm not on the job,

923
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:06,876
doing real detective work,

924
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,443
I'm actually a fun person.

925
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:10,793
Duly noted.
Fun person.

926
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,448
Of course, if that were true,

927
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:14,623
you wouldn't have been on
that date

928
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,104
with that drip
at the cooking class.

929
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:18,845
What was his name?
Leonard?

930
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:21,239
Len is his name,
and he's a very nice person.

931
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,544
Ah.

932
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,416
So when are you going
to break up with him?

933
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:25,460
What? I'm just saying,

934
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:26,809
if we're going to be partners,

935
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:28,507
- we should probably...
- Whoa. Whoa.

936
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,074
Hold on a second, okay?

937
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:33,642
We are not partners.
Let's be clear about that.

938
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:35,035
All right?

939
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,515
I am not even having
this conversation with you.

940
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:37,864
Oh, my god.

941
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:40,301
I don't think he's home.

942
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,564
Oliver!

943
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,615
In a murder mystery,
this would be very concerning.

944
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:53,009
What's the standard operating
procedure here, detective?

945
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:54,707
Uh, some would say
close the door

946
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,925
and come back another time.

947
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,884
And others?

948
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,193
Others would say get behind me,

949
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:04,847
don't touch anything,

950
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:06,501
and these few moments
never happened.

951
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:08,721
I love
this cloak and dagger stuff.

952
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:12,638
Oliver!

953
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,727
It's detective price,
San Francisco pd.

954
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,253
Anybody home?

955
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,407
Maggie!

956
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,290
He's alive.

957
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,509
Oliver?

958
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:58,466
Oliver!

959
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,295
Oof! Okay.

960
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,775
Let's get you up.
There we go.

961
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,865
Get in the chair.

962
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,128
You okay?

963
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,088
I, uh... I know you.

964
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:14,090
I'm detective price.
We met last night.

965
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:15,962
Oh...

966
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,443
Let me get you a glass of water.

967
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:27,277
Rough night?

968
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,454
Yeah, you could say that.

969
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:31,456
I think we were all
a little shaken up over Ian.

970
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:36,417
You have company last night,
Oliver?

971
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:40,116
No, I was, uh...
I was alone.

972
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,292
No hot date?

973
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,555
Just drowning your sorrows
alone?

974
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:46,166
Ah, no, I'm, um, married...

975
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,473
I mean, separated.

976
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:49,604
Thank you. I, uh...

977
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,521
Why exactly are you here again?

978
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,262
We wanted to ask you

979
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:58,396
about the flash drive
that you gave to Ian jenkin

980
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,310
right before he died.

981
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:02,269
Do you happen to know
what was on it?

982
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:05,054
I don't know.

983
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:08,231
Ian asked me to pick it up
from a photographer.

984
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,232
Alex scarponi?

985
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:10,712
Yeah.

986
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:13,846
I didn't think that you and Ian
were terribly close.

987
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,849
We weren't.

988
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,112
I mean, we knew each other
from the station,

989
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:20,983
but to be honest,

990
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:22,637
I don't think
Ian was close to anybody...

991
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:24,117
Not that I know of, anyway.

992
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,381
Speaking of the station,
I loved the show.

993
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,253
- You did?
- I did. Big fan.

994
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:32,081
I loved the one especially

995
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,606
when Henry cooked you
the cornish chicken.

996
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:35,650
Hen.

997
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:36,912
Hen. Delicious.

998
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:38,566
Yeah, it was a good gig.

999
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:43,919
You must be pretty angry
it got canceled.

1000
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:49,098
Well...

1001
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:51,231
I mean, I was, at first.

1002
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:53,451
But to tell you the truth,
I got pretty burned out.

1003
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:56,715
Hosting a weekly cooking show

1004
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:59,021
is a lot more work
than you'd think.

1005
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:02,372
There's the prep,
the rehearsals...

1006
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:04,940
The whole thing
helped torpedo my marriage.

1007
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:07,595
Anyway, I have some
other opportunities

1008
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,902
that have come my way recently,

1009
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,512
so who knows?

1010
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:12,644
Maybe losing the show

1011
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:13,862
wasn't such a bad thing
after all.

1012
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:26,048
He's lying.

1013
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,833
About what?

1014
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:29,443
When you asked him
if he was alone last night,

1015
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,705
he looked up and to the left.

1016
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:31,967
Classic tell.

1017
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:33,403
Did you read that in a book?

1018
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:36,189
Yes, actually, I did.

1019
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:37,930
I have a little soft spot
for crime fiction.

1020
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:39,235
Mm.

1021
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:40,498
Chandler, rendell, le carre,
I've read them all.

1022
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,543
You know, you'd be amazed
what you can learn

1023
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,327
- from reading a book, detective.
- Oh yeah?

1024
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:46,286
You know what's really amazing?

1025
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,594
Actual police work.

1026
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:52,031
He was lying about being alone.

1027
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:53,075
Is that lipstick?

1028
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,424
Yup.

1029
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:55,600
Where did you find that?

1030
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:57,515
Not in a book.

1031
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,341
We need to check it for prints.

1032
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:25,673
Lamprey distributor
confirms there were two orders,

1033
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:26,935
one week apart from each other.

1034
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:28,458
Told you.

1035
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:31,592
Do we have a name
that goes with the first order?

1036
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,028
Negative.

1037
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:34,769
It was paid for in cash
by a John Doe.

1038
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:37,337
No security cameras
for an I.D.,

1039
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,773
and the distributor
doesn't really remember

1040
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:40,340
what he looked like
other than that he was a man.

1041
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:42,298
So I take it
we won't have much luck

1042
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:43,343
in tracking down a John Doe

1043
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:45,606
who pays for his fish in cash.

1044
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,957
Maybe the victim was doing
an investigative report

1045
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:50,263
on Chez duquette

1046
00:42:50,306 --> 00:42:51,786
and all the crazy stuff
that was going on,

1047
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,136
and Peter was so scared
of all the negative publicity,

1048
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,921
that he killed him.

1049
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:57,923
No, no, listen...
I know Peter.

1050
00:42:57,966 --> 00:42:59,315
He would never hurt anyone.

1051
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,187
And besides, think about it...

1052
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,797
A dead customer just draws
negative attention

1053
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:04,494
to your restaurant, all right?

1054
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,061
It doesn't make sense,

1055
00:43:06,105 --> 00:43:09,282
which is why I also don't think
Klaus could have done it.

1056
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:11,371
A poisoned customer
points the finger at him.

1057
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:12,459
It makes no sense.

1058
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:13,808
Well, we also have
another problem,

1059
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:15,636
because Oliver just confirmed

1060
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,812
that he did in fact give
Mr. Jenkin

1061
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:19,292
a blue flash drive

1062
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:21,163
that there was no evidence of
at the crime scene.

1063
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:22,512
So where did that go?

1064
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:23,644
How could it go missing?

1065
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:24,776
Are you sure
it's not in evidence?

1066
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:25,994
I checked
all of the victim's pockets

1067
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:27,039
at the crime scene myself.

1068
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:29,911
They were all completely empty.

1069
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,826
Trust me, there's
no flash drive in evidence.

1070
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,872
Do you remember anyone
being near the body

1071
00:43:33,915 --> 00:43:35,308
before the police
arrived on the scene?

1072
00:43:35,351 --> 00:43:37,440
Well, we all immediately
surrounded him, of course,

1073
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:38,833
to see what we could do to help,

1074
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:41,619
but I don't remember anyone
going into his pockets.

1075
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,272
Not that they
couldn't have later

1076
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:44,622
when I wasn't looking.

1077
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,754
I thought nothing escaped
your keen observation?

1078
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:48,016
You know what I noticed?

1079
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,191
You've got a button missing
on your jacket.

1080
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,671
You might want to get that
fixed sometime.

1081
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:51,890
The fingerprints
just came back on the glass.

1082
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:55,371
You're not going
to believe this.

1083
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:56,546
They belong to pauline duquette.

1084
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,896
She's in the system?

1085
00:43:57,939 --> 00:44:00,028
She was arrested
at a political rally

1086
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:01,551
at Harvard 12 years ago.

1087
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:05,033
This just got interesting.

1088
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:06,252
Let's go find her.

1089
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:10,691
Nice work, munro!

1090
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:12,258
Thank you.

1091
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:24,879
Oliver and I have been friends
for a long time.

1092
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:27,229
After what happened
at the restaurant,

1093
00:44:27,273 --> 00:44:29,623
we were both upset.

1094
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,972
He asked if I wanted
to have a drink,

1095
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:32,582
so I went.

1096
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:37,457
I also wanted
to continue talking to him

1097
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,328
about opening
a new cooking school

1098
00:44:39,372 --> 00:44:40,460
with him as our star chef.

1099
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,592
What?

1100
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:44,029
I'm sorry, uncle,

1101
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,334
it's just with everything
going on at our restaurant,

1102
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:47,902
I... I was worried
things were falling apart,

1103
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:49,556
and we were losing sales.

1104
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,124
And then when that
reporter died, I...

1105
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,603
We had to do something.

1106
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:55,693
I thought that maybe

1107
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:56,911
we could leverage
the duquette name

1108
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:58,434
into something else
to keep us going.

1109
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:01,089
You shouldn't be making
business decisions without me.

1110
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:02,047
I'm still the owner here.

1111
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,005
I know, I just...

1112
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:06,312
I was trying
to save what we have.

1113
00:45:08,923 --> 00:45:12,274
Why would Oliver lie to us
about seeing you?

1114
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:19,891
We had too much to drink,

1115
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:20,718
and things got out of hand.

1116
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,114
Oliver is trying to fix things

1117
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,682
between him and his wife, so...

1118
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:31,816
He wouldn't want
word to get out.

1119
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:32,730
That's all.

1120
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:45,917
So we've been able to clear

1121
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,353
all friends, family
and co-workers.

1122
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:49,747
Anyone that jenkin nailed
from his investigations

1123
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,924
is either still behind bars
or has been ruled out.

1124
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:55,361
We spoke with scarponi in Italy,
and he said

1125
00:45:55,404 --> 00:45:57,319
that jenkin just wanted
everyone that was associated

1126
00:45:57,363 --> 00:45:59,060
with filmore bistro
and Chez duquette

1127
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:00,366
to be photographed.

1128
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:02,455
He states he never witnessed
anything unusual,

1129
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:04,152
and everything he photographed,

1130
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:05,153
he put on that flash drive

1131
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:07,286
and handed over to Oliver Paige.

1132
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:08,766
We still don't know
who Todd Armand is,

1133
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:09,984
or Armand Todd.

1134
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:13,466
As for 12 to 9:30,

1135
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:15,816
that could be 12 to 9:30
as in a time frame,

1136
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,254
or a 9:30 appointment
on the 12th.

1137
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:21,256
Jenkin was murdered on the 12th.

1138
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,649
Maybe he was meeting
this Armand guy

1139
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:25,521
on the 12th
at 9:30 in the morning?

1140
00:46:25,565 --> 00:46:26,784
All right.

1141
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,829
We still don't have anything
that ties jenkin

1142
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:29,743
to anyone from that dinner.

1143
00:46:34,617 --> 00:46:35,836
Wait a minute.

1144
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,448
What if we're looking
at this all wrong?

1145
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:42,538
What if the murderer
weren't after the reporter?

1146
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:44,105
What if the intended target

1147
00:46:44,149 --> 00:46:47,282
was actually Peter
and his restaurant?

1148
00:46:47,326 --> 00:46:49,328
Who would benefit the most

1149
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:51,199
from Chez duquette
going out of business?

1150
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:53,245
Peter's rival, Raymond bishop.

1151
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:54,724
Exactly.

1152
00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:56,596
Everybody knows
that they hate each other.

1153
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:57,858
Who better than Raymond

1154
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:00,818
to know how to sabotage
another restaurant?

1155
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:02,558
But wasn't Raymond's restaurant

1156
00:47:02,602 --> 00:47:04,691
being sabotaged, too?

1157
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:06,040
Well, that could just be
a cover to throw us all off.

1158
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:07,041
That's right.

1159
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:09,261
Jenkin could've discovered

1160
00:47:09,304 --> 00:47:10,915
Raymond was sabotaging
Chez duquette.

1161
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,351
He confronted Raymond
with his evidence.

1162
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:15,702
Raymond panicked,
poisoned him at the dinner,

1163
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:18,052
thereby silencing
the investigation and...

1164
00:47:18,096 --> 00:47:20,359
Putting his hated rival
out of business.

1165
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:21,882
Killing two birds
with one stone.

1166
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:23,057
- Bam!
- Bam!

1167
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:24,276
Oh, boy...

1168
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:27,322
Okay, this is how it works.

1169
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:29,150
You keep an eye out
for anything suspicious,

1170
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:30,935
and let me do the talking.

1171
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:33,807
If Raymond cultivated
the toxin at his house,

1172
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,852
it's more than likely

1173
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:36,070
there'll be trace elements left.

1174
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:37,289
Forsyth's assembling

1175
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:38,594
a forensics team right now.

1176
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:40,596
Okay,
can you stay behind me, please?

1177
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,684
Okay, fine. Fine.

1178
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:46,733
Raymond bishop,
San Francisco pd.

1179
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:53,609
Detective...
Henry...

1180
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:54,915
What can I do for you?

1181
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:57,178
Mr. Bishop?

1182
00:47:57,222 --> 00:47:58,527
We have some questions for you.

1183
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,921
May we come in?

1184
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:01,966
Uh, well, it's, uh...

1185
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:03,097
If you prefer,

1186
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:03,968
we can take it
down to the station.

1187
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:07,319
No, that's fine.
Come in.

1188
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:17,459
Peter!

1189
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:20,027
Henry.

1190
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:27,861
We've been friends for 40 years.

1191
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,646
We trained together
under the same chef

1192
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,300
at one of the best
cooking schools in Paris

1193
00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:33,867
when we were young men.

1194
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:34,824
He turns up at the school

1195
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:36,522
where I was the star pupil.

1196
00:48:36,565 --> 00:48:38,176
Oh, the ego on this guy!

1197
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,960
I was about to say,

1198
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:41,222
this young guy turns up
at the school,

1199
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:42,049
blows everybody's socks off.

1200
00:48:43,703 --> 00:48:45,052
'Course, I knew
I had to step up my game.

1201
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:46,445
We were always trying

1202
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:48,403
to outdo each other
over the years.

1203
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:51,058
Peter eventually took over
his family's restaurant,

1204
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:52,930
and eventually,
I came to San Francisco

1205
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:54,496
and was able to open
filmore bistro.

1206
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,802
Right,

1207
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:57,847
and shortly after
he had opened his restaurant,

1208
00:48:57,891 --> 00:48:59,066
I gave an interview
in the newspaper

1209
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,808
and, uh...

1210
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:04,506
I made some comments
about Raymond and his cooking.

1211
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,030
Of course, I was just teasing,

1212
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:08,119
but the journalist
didn't write it that way.

1213
00:49:08,162 --> 00:49:10,469
And all of a sudden,
it became this huge...

1214
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:11,470
Rivalry.

1215
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:12,732
Yeah, yeah.

1216
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:14,168
But instead of hurting business,

1217
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:15,822
I mean, customers were flocking
to the restaurants

1218
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:17,302
to see what was going on.

1219
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:19,260
Right, business was booming,
so why set them straight?

1220
00:49:19,304 --> 00:49:21,262
So you never wanted
to ruin Peter?

1221
00:49:21,306 --> 00:49:22,394
Of course not.

1222
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:23,395
No.

1223
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:24,309
No.

1224
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,573
As a matter of fact, he's been
trying to keep my spirits up.

1225
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:30,880
I don't know.

1226
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:32,143
With everything
that's been going on,

1227
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:34,101
sometimes, I wonder
if I should just retire...

1228
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:35,407
Just pack the whole thing up.

1229
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,886
Yeah.

1230
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,888
I've been wondering
the same thing.

1231
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:40,716
This business, it's...

1232
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,761
It's just not the same anymore.

1233
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:48,594
Thank you, gentlemen.

1234
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:56,819
So I might have been
a little off in my theory.

1235
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,562
You should've heard forsyth

1236
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:03,261
when I told her
to call off the forensics.

1237
00:50:03,304 --> 00:50:04,784
I don't know
what she was thinking

1238
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:05,741
by pairing us together.

1239
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:08,092
This is ridiculous.

1240
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:09,049
Oh...

1241
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,051
Thank you.

1242
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:12,357
And what are we doing here?

1243
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,923
I don't really want
to eat ribs right now.

1244
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,753
Maggie, I'm sorry
that I screwed up.

1245
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:18,928
I am.

1246
00:50:18,972 --> 00:50:21,235
But I brought you here

1247
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:22,410
because I wanted to show you

1248
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:25,239
why this case
means so much to me.

1249
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:31,593
When I was a teenager,

1250
00:50:31,637 --> 00:50:34,161
shortly after
I started working for Peter,

1251
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:37,251
he saw something in me.

1252
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:40,602
And so, one day,
he brought me here,

1253
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:43,344
and he pointed to that gentleman
right back there.

1254
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:47,087
That's the owner.

1255
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:48,654
Had this place 50 years.

1256
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:52,658
Peter told me,

1257
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:53,789
"Henry, it doesn't
matter if you work

1258
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,661
in a high-end establishment
like mine

1259
00:50:55,704 --> 00:50:58,577
or a little place like this.

1260
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:04,104
If you bring the same passion
and care to your cooking

1261
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:07,281
that that man brings to his,

1262
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:08,543
you will be a success in life,

1263
00:51:08,587 --> 00:51:11,155
no matter the size of
your bank account."

1264
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:18,292
That is the best advice
anyone has ever given me

1265
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:19,902
my entire life.

1266
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:26,822
And I also brought you here

1267
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:27,823
because we didn't get lunch,

1268
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:29,173
and these are the best ribs

1269
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:30,087
you are ever going to eat
in your entire life.

1270
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,566
I'll see about that.

1271
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,090
There's no way around it.

1272
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:35,004
You've just got
to dive in and get messy.

1273
00:51:35,048 --> 00:51:35,918
I'm not afraid.

1274
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:46,015
Hey, Lucy.

1275
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:48,366
Hi! Okay,
there are three Todd armands

1276
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:49,976
living in San Francisco,

1277
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:52,152
but I can't find a connection
between them and Ian jenkin.

1278
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:54,676
I did have an idea
for this week's blog, though.

1279
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,678
How about food poisoning?

1280
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:59,594
48 million people
get food poisoning each year

1281
00:51:59,638 --> 00:52:00,595
in this country.

1282
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,727
3,000 of them actually die.

1283
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,598
We could call it

1284
00:52:03,642 --> 00:52:05,513
"the secret killer
lurking in your fridge."

1285
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:07,733
I like it.

1286
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:11,606
So how's the case going?

1287
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:22,574
Deadlier by the minute.

1288
00:52:36,283 --> 00:52:37,241
"Drop the case,
or you're next?"

1289
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:38,894
You have to tell Maggie.

1290
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:40,200
No way.

1291
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:41,332
If the police think
I'm in danger,

1292
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,463
they're going to take me
off the case,

1293
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:44,204
and I'm not going
to let that happen.

1294
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:45,379
I promised Peter that I would
get to the bottom of this,

1295
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:46,598
and that's what I'm going to do.

1296
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,252
How can you eat
at a time like this?

1297
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:50,819
It's not for me, it's for you.

1298
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,560
You know I think better
when I'm cooking.

1299
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,041
Voila.

1300
00:52:56,564 --> 00:52:58,436
Best perk of my job.

1301
00:52:58,479 --> 00:53:00,481
Oh, yum.

1302
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:02,918
Yeah?

1303
00:53:02,962 --> 00:53:04,093
Mm-hmm.

1304
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:09,447
Henry, this case
is getting serious.

1305
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,058
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

1306
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,538
How am I supposed to find
another job

1307
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:14,495
where I get to eat this well?

1308
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:23,591
Hello?

1309
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:24,592
Hey, it's Maggie.

1310
00:53:24,636 --> 00:53:26,115
I found something.

1311
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:27,595
Yeah? What have you got?

1312
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:30,424
Well, I was combing the web
for images of Ian jenkin.

1313
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:33,122
Remember how Sally aldrin
said that she'd just met him?

1314
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:34,254
Yeah.

1315
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:35,777
Well, I found
a photo of Sally and Ian

1316
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:38,389
looking pretty cozy
at a fundraiser.

1317
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:40,260
The photo was taken
one week ago.

1318
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,697
Why would she lie to you
about them being an item?

1319
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:45,526
Because that would make her
a top suspect.

1320
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:46,614
We have to talk with Sally
right away.

1321
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:47,485
Right.

1322
00:53:47,528 --> 00:53:49,269
Look, today is Saturday.

1323
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:51,706
Sally's book launch is tonight.

1324
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,142
Perfect.
We'll confront her there

1325
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:54,318
and catch her off guard.

1326
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,493
Good idea.

1327
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:56,842
See you.

1328
00:54:07,722 --> 00:54:08,984
It's funny...

1329
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:11,639
Maggie didn't mention
she had a new partner.

1330
00:54:11,683 --> 00:54:13,293
Oh, no, no, no.

1331
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:14,903
We're not partners.

1332
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:16,905
I'm just a consultant.

1333
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:18,342
Mm-hmm.

1334
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:22,694
You know,

1335
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:23,825
my Mom never takes
this long to get ready.

1336
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,871
You sure this isn't a date?

1337
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:27,481
Oh, no.

1338
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:28,656
Definitely not a date.

1339
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,224
Wait here, I'll go check on her.

1340
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:41,495
You win those?

1341
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:43,497
We all got one
just for showing up.

1342
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,325
Well, that's ridiculous.

1343
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:47,196
I mean, you know, no offense.

1344
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,024
No, it is ridiculous.

1345
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:50,287
I mean, if I get a trophy,

1346
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,331
I want it to mean something.

1347
00:54:53,812 --> 00:54:54,769
So how good are you?

1348
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:56,380
I'm rated at 1650.

1349
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:58,120
Wow! Really?

1350
00:54:58,164 --> 00:54:59,339
You play?

1351
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:02,037
State champ, two years running.

1352
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:03,038
Really?

1353
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:04,126
When I was your age,

1354
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,780
I used to skip school

1355
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:08,087
and play with the old guys
in the park for money.

1356
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,044
I mean,
not that you should do that.

1357
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:10,394
Don't... don't do that.

1358
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:13,962
Maybe you could teach me
something!

1359
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:15,224
Or... whatever.

1360
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:16,356
I mean, I'm sure
you're probably really busy.

1361
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,140
No, I'll definitely show you
some tricks.

1362
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:19,141
I'd love to.

1363
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:21,753
Here she is.

1364
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:25,713
High heels and all.

1365
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:28,716
Whoa.

1366
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,370
Pigs do fly.

1367
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:32,546
Enjoy yourselves, you two.

1368
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:33,547
Mom, for the last time,

1369
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:34,940
we are going out for work.

1370
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:36,768
Then how come you kept
changing your outfit?

1371
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:40,815
Don't you have homework?

1372
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:42,034
Already did it.

1373
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:44,079
Of course you did.
I love you.

1374
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:45,646
Love you, too.

1375
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:46,995
Sorry I have to work late again.

1376
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,954
I'll be back
as soon as I can, okay?

1377
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:50,782
Oh, take your time...

1378
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:02,620
So...

1379
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:04,404
Let's go crash a party.

1380
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:12,978
Thank you so much for coming.

1381
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:17,330
Just trying to blend.

1382
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,506
Of course you are.

1383
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,116
It's nice to see you
not wearing grey.

1384
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,117
You look beautiful.

1385
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:23,162
Right.

1386
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:25,512
What?

1387
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:26,600
What's the punch line?

1388
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:27,645
There's no punch line.
I mean it.

1389
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:28,689
You look beautiful.

1390
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:30,691
Although I am wondering

1391
00:56:30,735 --> 00:56:32,214
where you're hiding your gun.

1392
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:33,912
Sally!

1393
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:36,741
Henry! Hi!

1394
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:39,613
And it's detective... price?

1395
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:41,441
That's right.

1396
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,487
You guys here
on official business,

1397
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,010
or are you here
to enjoy the party?

1398
00:56:45,053 --> 00:56:46,446
Official business.

1399
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:47,447
I'm enjoying the party.
She's driving.

1400
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:48,492
Ms. Aldrin,

1401
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:50,624
this photo suggests
that you and Ian

1402
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:52,626
were on much friendlier terms

1403
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,236
than what you led us to believe.

1404
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,586
Why would you lie to us?

1405
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,156
Because I was scared.

1406
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,942
I watch TV, okay?

1407
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:05,639
The murderer always turns out

1408
00:57:05,683 --> 00:57:07,336
to be the angry girlfriend.

1409
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,818
Look, I had nothing
to do with Ian's murder,

1410
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:12,211
all right?

1411
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:13,821
Ian had enough
enemies on his own.

1412
00:57:13,865 --> 00:57:15,475
He didn't need
my help to kill him.

1413
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,304
There was tension between
the two of you at Chez duquette.

1414
00:57:18,347 --> 00:57:20,045
Well, you should know
about catchy titles, Sally.

1415
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:24,049
What were you fighting about?

1416
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:28,096
Our different definitions
of the word, "exclusive."

1417
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,098
But that doesn't
make me a killer.

1418
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:32,753
Look, I really
can't handle a scandal

1419
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:34,668
right now.

1420
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:36,496
I don't want to make
my publishers nervous,

1421
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,411
so if we could just...

1422
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,673
Wrap this up?

1423
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,371
Come here.

1424
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:47,638
Okay, um...

1425
00:57:51,163 --> 00:57:52,251
Now...

1426
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:53,295
Sally...

1427
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:54,949
Word on the street

1428
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:56,908
is that you're being wooed
by another publisher.

1429
00:57:58,257 --> 00:58:00,085
What? I know things!

1430
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:02,087
What other publisher?

1431
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:03,958
You mean my talks with Layton?

1432
00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:06,091
Layton Leopold?

1433
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:08,397
The chef at filmore bistro?

1434
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:09,398
Yeah.

1435
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:12,401
Layton came to me a while ago.

1436
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:15,143
He said he was starting
his own line of cookbooks,

1437
00:58:15,187 --> 00:58:19,060
mainly featuring his own recipes
from filmore bistro.

1438
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:22,368
He said that he was coming
into a lot of money

1439
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:23,717
and that he was getting ready

1440
00:58:23,761 --> 00:58:24,631
to buy the restaurant
from Raymond.

1441
00:58:24,675 --> 00:58:27,416
Wait, Layton said this?

1442
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,809
Yeah, he said Raymond
was ready to retire,

1443
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,942
and that he was tired
of running the business

1444
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:32,813
and all the hassles
that came with it.

1445
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:34,728
Thought he was going to get

1446
00:58:34,772 --> 00:58:36,077
a pretty good price on it, too.

1447
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:38,558
I think
they were having problems.

1448
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:40,168
Did Layton say

1449
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:41,953
where this money
was coming from?

1450
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:43,345
I didn't ask.

1451
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:44,782
I'm not looking to expand.

1452
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:48,133
As you can see, my publishers
treat me pretty well.

1453
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,267
I really should get back
to mingling.

1454
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:54,182
Sure.

1455
00:58:54,226 --> 00:58:55,270
Just...

1456
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:57,621
Yeah, yeah...
"Don't leave town".

1457
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,844
Okay, look, if we hurry,

1458
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:05,063
we can probably
still catch Layton

1459
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:06,107
at filmore bistro.

1460
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:07,369
The kitchen's open
until 11:00.

1461
00:59:07,413 --> 00:59:08,936
Okay, Henry, it's late.
It's been a long week.

1462
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,024
I'm going to go home

1463
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:11,199
and spend some time
with my daughter.

1464
00:59:11,243 --> 00:59:12,592
We're going to start again
on Monday, okay?

1465
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:13,767
What are you talking about?

1466
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:14,942
We've got a major lead
to follow up on.

1467
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:16,161
I mean, Layton is clearly
up to something.

1468
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:17,292
Henry...

1469
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:19,512
Okay, look,
this is what I propose.

1470
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,774
We go talk to Layton,
then after,

1471
00:59:20,818 --> 00:59:23,777
we go for mu shu pork
and talk about the case.

1472
00:59:23,821 --> 00:59:25,953
Lucy, my assistant,
her parents own

1473
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:27,346
the best restaurant
in all of Chinatown.

1474
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:30,654
I have a life
outside of the police force.

1475
00:59:30,697 --> 00:59:33,395
Abby already doesn't see
enough of me as it is.

1476
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:36,137
Now, this may be hard
for you to understand

1477
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:37,138
because you are not responsible

1478
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:38,270
for anyone else,

1479
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:39,488
but we have a family rule.

1480
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:41,882
I am home for dinner
four nights a week,

1481
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:42,709
and I already missed
that dinner.

1482
00:59:44,189 --> 00:59:45,669
This is my job,

1483
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:47,584
and I care deeply
about what I do,

1484
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:49,977
but my family comes first,

1485
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:51,544
and nobody
is going to change that.

1486
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:31,758
Seriously, I'm right there

1487
01:00:31,802 --> 01:00:33,455
in the middle of the palace,
with soaking wet shoes.

1488
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:35,240
It was ridiculous!
I thought

1489
01:00:35,283 --> 01:00:36,197
they were going to throw
me out of the country

1490
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:37,634
right there.

1491
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:39,026
Thankfully, they didn't.
I was invited back, but...

1492
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,593
Hey!

1493
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,639
What are you doing?

1494
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:44,858
How was your run?

1495
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:46,251
What are you doing here?

1496
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:47,426
He's making breakfast.

1497
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:48,645
You have got
to try these omelets.

1498
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:50,951
They're insane.

1499
01:00:50,995 --> 01:00:51,865
Do you know Henry has traveled

1500
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:53,171
all over the world?

1501
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:54,781
Tell my Mom the story
about the bull in Spain.

1502
01:00:54,825 --> 01:00:56,653
Yeah, now may not be the best...

1503
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:57,654
He was gored by a bull!

1504
01:00:57,697 --> 01:00:59,046
Yeah, uh, minor goring.

1505
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,352
Show her the scar.

1506
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:01,614
Uh, it's fine.
I don't need to see the scar.

1507
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,224
I'm just trying to understand

1508
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:05,139
why you're here when I told you

1509
01:01:05,183 --> 01:01:06,227
that we could reconvene
on Monday.

1510
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:07,576
- Maggie...
- Mom...

1511
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,492
Look, I'm sorry, I just...

1512
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:13,582
I wanted you to know
that I heard you

1513
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:14,671
loud and clear last
night, all right?

1514
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:17,064
You need to be
with your family...

1515
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:18,413
Who are adorable, by the way.

1516
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:19,545
Bon appetit.

1517
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:20,894
Oh, thank you, thank you.

1518
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:22,766
So I was thinking, you know,

1519
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:24,245
why not do both, right?

1520
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:25,507
Mm!

1521
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:30,512
Okay.

1522
01:01:30,556 --> 01:01:33,690
Look, before you throw me out,

1523
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:35,126
why don't I at least
make you breakfast?

1524
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:36,693
I've got everything out.
It's ready to go.

1525
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:46,833
Fine.

1526
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:48,835
Yeah?

1527
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:49,749
What do you like in your omelet?

1528
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:50,924
Everything.

1529
01:01:50,968 --> 01:01:52,143
Oh...

1530
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:53,231
With tabasco.

1531
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:54,972
My kind of woman.

1532
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:16,602
There you are.

1533
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:21,825
Pretty.

1534
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:29,615
How is it?

1535
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:33,140
It's great.

1536
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:34,272
Really?

1537
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:37,014
Wow, you are so needy!
You know that?

1538
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:39,668
All chefs are.
What can I say?

1539
01:02:43,368 --> 01:02:45,239
By the way,
you were right last night.

1540
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:50,157
I don't have anything
outside of work.

1541
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:51,028
This is all I have.

1542
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:55,815
Your family is great.

1543
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:56,729
You're a lucky woman.

1544
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,559
I know.

1545
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:04,128
I'm sorry if I over-reacted.

1546
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:06,173
No, you've got nothing
to apologize for.

1547
01:03:06,217 --> 01:03:08,785
This was a dumb idea.

1548
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:09,829
Look, I'm just
going to clean up,

1549
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,744
and I will get out of your hair.

1550
01:03:19,273 --> 01:03:20,971
Hey, um...

1551
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:22,363
My Mom was going
to take Abby out

1552
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:23,538
for a few hours anyway.

1553
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:25,932
If you want,
we could go over stuff.

1554
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:29,153
I thought you'd never ask!

1555
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,158
Excited?

1556
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:38,031
Bam!

1557
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:39,076
Wow!

1558
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,427
You recreated
the murder board...

1559
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:43,428
In my living room.

1560
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:44,516
In case you're wondering,

1561
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:45,647
I used the photos
from my cell phone.

1562
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:47,475
Trust me, it's exactly the same.

1563
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:49,564
I can see that.

1564
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:51,871
Okay...

1565
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:53,873
You think that Layton

1566
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,179
was sabotaging
his own restaurant

1567
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:57,572
so that he could destroy
the business enough

1568
01:03:57,616 --> 01:03:59,661
to be able to buy the restaurant
from Raymond?

1569
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:02,882
Everybody in town knows
that Layton has a big ego

1570
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,884
and believe that Raymond
doesn't give him

1571
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:06,668
the exposure
he feels he deserves.

1572
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:07,974
If you would just listen to me,

1573
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:10,716
we could make
bold choices like this

1574
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:12,326
without alienating
our customers.

1575
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,459
Or you could go buy
your own restaurant

1576
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:16,026
and cook whatever you like.

1577
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:18,071
And Layton
was clearly frustrated

1578
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:19,681
that Raymond refused
to take any risks.

1579
01:04:19,725 --> 01:04:21,727
If Layton owned filmore bistro,

1580
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:24,338
he would turn it into a shrine
to showcase his cooking,

1581
01:04:24,382 --> 01:04:27,385
something Raymond
would never let happen.

1582
01:04:27,428 --> 01:04:29,474
So, what is Layton's motive
for killing jenkin?

1583
01:04:29,517 --> 01:04:31,432
Jenkin discovered

1584
01:04:31,476 --> 01:04:33,521
what Layton was doing to Raymond

1585
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:35,480
and his restaurant.

1586
01:04:35,523 --> 01:04:36,960
So, Layton also started

1587
01:04:37,003 --> 01:04:40,485
sabotaging Chez duquette
as the perfect decoy.

1588
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:41,529
Exactly.

1589
01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:45,969
Okay, so, from the beginning...

1590
01:04:46,012 --> 01:04:48,885
Layton causes problems
at filmore bistro

1591
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:50,538
but knows that he's going to be
a prime suspect.

1592
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:52,236
So, to throw off
any investigation,

1593
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:55,761
he also sabotages Chez duquette,

1594
01:04:55,804 --> 01:05:00,635
with the added benefit
of harming his main competitor.

1595
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,463
We need to find out
where Layton is right now

1596
01:05:02,507 --> 01:05:04,509
and bring him in
for questioning.

1597
01:05:04,552 --> 01:05:05,423
Exactly.

1598
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:18,740
Maggie, take a look at this.

1599
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:21,656
I've got a message
from Layton Leopold.

1600
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,441
What?

1601
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:24,964
Henry...

1602
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:26,487
I need you to tell everyone

1603
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:29,099
that I never meant for this
to go so far.

1604
01:05:29,142 --> 01:05:31,057
I didn't mean for Mr. Jenkin to
die, but he...

1605
01:05:31,101 --> 01:05:33,538
Anyway, I've ended it all now.

1606
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,503
"If Raymond had
just listened to me,

1607
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:44,331
none of this
would have happened.

1608
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,463
I was the reason

1609
01:05:45,506 --> 01:05:46,377
filmore bistro
was such a success.

1610
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:49,858
But Raymond has no ambition.

1611
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:52,513
When he refused to sell me
the business,

1612
01:05:52,557 --> 01:05:53,601
he left me no choice."

1613
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:56,822
"I began tampering
with ingredients,

1614
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,476
disrupting the business...

1615
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:01,914
Pushing Raymond to the point
where he was ready to retire.

1616
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,003
I started sabotaging
Chez duquette as well..."

1617
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:05,700
I did not order this!

1618
01:06:05,744 --> 01:06:07,354
I got the order right here!

1619
01:06:07,398 --> 01:06:09,530
"To make it look like
all of the chaos linked back

1620
01:06:09,574 --> 01:06:12,229
to the feud between Raymond and Peter.

1621
01:06:12,272 --> 01:06:15,362
When jenkin began
investigating what was going on,

1622
01:06:15,406 --> 01:06:17,234
he was going to blow the lid
off everything.

1623
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:19,018
I panicked.

1624
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:21,368
I knew Klaus was serving
lamprey at the gala

1625
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:22,717
and cultivated my own toxin."

1626
01:06:22,761 --> 01:06:25,416
Excuse me.

1627
01:06:25,459 --> 01:06:28,375
Could you take this drink
over to that gentleman?

1628
01:06:28,419 --> 01:06:29,986
Please and thank you.

1629
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:37,863
"I poisoned his drink
before the dinner,

1630
01:06:37,906 --> 01:06:40,779
hoping everyone would think
jenkin's death was an accident."

1631
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:47,220
"But I didn't have a choice.

1632
01:06:47,264 --> 01:06:48,961
He cornered me.
I was afraid."

1633
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:53,096
"I didn't know what to do."

1634
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,012
"I can't live
with what I've done,

1635
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:58,405
so I've used the poison
on myself."

1636
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:00,059
We just swept his garage

1637
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:01,408
for the second time.

1638
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:03,845
No trace of ttb.

1639
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:06,065
Wherever he cultivated
the poison, it wasn't here.

1640
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:07,980
You should check the harbor.

1641
01:07:09,895 --> 01:07:12,593
Guess what we just found
tucked away in a drawer?

1642
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:14,204
Does this look familiar?

1643
01:07:15,988 --> 01:07:17,076
That's the one.

1644
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,512
We tried it
on one of our laptops.

1645
01:07:18,556 --> 01:07:19,861
It's encrypted.

1646
01:07:19,905 --> 01:07:21,254
I'm sure one of the
I.T. Guys can unlock that.

1647
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:23,256
Shouldn't take them that long.

1648
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,518
Bag it up with everything else.

1649
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:31,699
You know what I take
from all this?

1650
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:36,922
No more seafood, man.
I'm done.

1651
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:42,536
So that's it, then?

1652
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,885
Case closed?

1653
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:47,324
Is it always like this?

1654
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,069
No.

1655
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:55,027
It's never this clean.

1656
01:08:08,388 --> 01:08:09,998
Henry...

1657
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:11,826
I need you to tell everyone

1658
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:14,481
that I never meant for this
to go so far.

1659
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:15,961
I didn't mean for Mr. Jenkin to
die, but he...

1660
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:20,008
Anyway, I've ended it all now.

1661
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:24,926
What are you doing?

1662
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:28,365
There's something bothering me
about this message.

1663
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:30,584
I can't put my finger on it.

1664
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:34,893
Henry...

1665
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:36,416
I need you to tell everyone

1666
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,505
that I never meant for this
to go so far.

1667
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:40,072
I didn't mean
for Mr. Jenkin to die...

1668
01:08:45,817 --> 01:08:48,863
It's too clean.

1669
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:50,909
It's just too clean...

1670
01:08:50,952 --> 01:08:53,868
What's too clean?

1671
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:55,392
Oh, nothing.
Sorry.

1672
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:57,785
I was just thinking about work.

1673
01:08:57,829 --> 01:09:00,614
This looks like
a lot of effort, Mom.

1674
01:09:00,658 --> 01:09:02,181
We could just order something.

1675
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:03,530
No! I want to do this.

1676
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:04,966
You know,

1677
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,446
food is not just supposed
to be about sustenance.

1678
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:08,361
It's about...
The experience.

1679
01:09:08,405 --> 01:09:09,536
Do you know

1680
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,103
how long this experience
is going to take?

1681
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,367
I'm starving.

1682
01:09:14,411 --> 01:09:16,152
Okay, why don't you go
grab an apron,

1683
01:09:16,195 --> 01:09:17,196
and then you can help
speed this along?

1684
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,850
- Okay!
- Okay.

1685
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:23,071
You want help?

1686
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:23,942
Yeah.

1687
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:27,293
So what are we making?

1688
01:09:27,337 --> 01:09:28,903
I was thinking

1689
01:09:28,947 --> 01:09:30,557
about doing thai stir fry.

1690
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:31,558
What do you think?

1691
01:09:31,602 --> 01:09:32,690
Sounds yummy.

1692
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:33,778
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1693
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:34,822
Want to chop on
the carrots there?

1694
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:35,823
Sure.

1695
01:09:35,867 --> 01:09:37,085
And chop.

1696
01:09:38,086 --> 01:09:39,784
Oops, sorry.

1697
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:45,137
Bailey!

1698
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,008
Detective, I've got something
you really need to see.

1699
01:09:47,052 --> 01:09:48,488
The guys in I.T.,
they unlocked the flash drive.

1700
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:50,098
And?

1701
01:09:50,142 --> 01:09:51,622
It was filled
with photos of people

1702
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:52,840
working at Chez duquette
and filmore bistro.

1703
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:54,407
But there's this one photo
in particular

1704
01:09:54,451 --> 01:09:56,931
I think you're really going
to be interested in.

1705
01:09:56,975 --> 01:09:57,976
I'm emailing it over to you
right now.

1706
01:09:59,847 --> 01:10:03,286
I can't get over
these food poisoning stats.

1707
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:07,420
128,000 people
are hospitalized each year.

1708
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:09,074
Well, like you said,

1709
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:10,293
it's the killer
lurking in your fridge.

1710
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:20,694
Or fridge magnet!

1711
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:22,696
That magnet on the board...

1712
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,655
Lucy, it was never Todd!

1713
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:27,832
T-o-d-d.

1714
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:30,617
It was t-c-d-d!

1715
01:10:30,661 --> 01:10:32,924
The "o" was a "c!"

1716
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:35,100
Look up a business called, uh...

1717
01:10:35,143 --> 01:10:37,407
Thompson, christie,
Davies, and devine.

1718
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:41,498
Got it.
Look at this.

1719
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:43,413
This is a merchant bank
right here in San Francisco.

1720
01:10:43,456 --> 01:10:44,544
Check out the address.

1721
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:46,851
1274 Armand St.

1722
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,595
It was never a person,
it's a street.

1723
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:54,293
It says here they specialize
in the food industry.

1724
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:56,295
We know the 12th
was the same day

1725
01:10:56,339 --> 01:10:57,818
jenkin was murdered.

1726
01:10:57,862 --> 01:11:01,605
And Sally said that Layton
was coming into some money.

1727
01:11:01,648 --> 01:11:03,737
Maybe jenkin
discovered a connection

1728
01:11:03,781 --> 01:11:05,217
between Layton and this bank

1729
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,741
and went on the 12th
at 9:30 to investigate.

1730
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:09,961
Whatever he found out
led to his conclusion,

1731
01:11:10,004 --> 01:11:13,747
which he was about to announce
before his death.

1732
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:15,836
Wait a minute.

1733
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,665
Armand street is in
the financial district, right?

1734
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:20,014
The financial district
has that clock

1735
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:21,015
that chimes, right?

1736
01:11:21,059 --> 01:11:21,886
Yeah, it's right by the park.

1737
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,758
Henry...

1738
01:11:24,802 --> 01:11:26,369
There!

1739
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:29,154
...That I never meant
for this to go so far.

1740
01:11:29,197 --> 01:11:30,677
I didn't mean for Mr. Jenkin to
die, but he...

1741
01:11:31,896 --> 01:11:33,724
And again!

1742
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:34,594
Anyway, I've ended it all now.

1743
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:38,642
That was a one o'clock
and two o'clock chime

1744
01:11:38,685 --> 01:11:39,730
in one recording.

1745
01:11:39,773 --> 01:11:42,820
How did two chimes
separated by an hour

1746
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:46,040
end up in a message
that only lasted 15 seconds?

1747
01:11:49,435 --> 01:11:51,045
What?

1748
01:11:51,089 --> 01:11:52,917
I have to call Maggie...

1749
01:11:56,573 --> 01:11:58,314
Henry,
I was just about to call you.

1750
01:11:58,357 --> 01:11:59,837
I have something to show you.

1751
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,273
I have something
to show you, too.

1752
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,666
It's not over.

1753
01:12:04,276 --> 01:12:05,973
I didn't mean for Mr. Jenkin to
die, but he...

1754
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:10,238
Anyway, I've ended it all now.

1755
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:12,458
So the lab guys have confirmed

1756
01:12:12,502 --> 01:12:14,330
that the message
was spliced together

1757
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:15,287
from a number
of different recordings.

1758
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,289
Layton wasn't working alone.

1759
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,378
So Layton was murdered.

1760
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:20,553
Yes.

1761
01:12:20,597 --> 01:12:21,467
Maybe they had an argument,

1762
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:23,251
or Layton wanted to come clean.

1763
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,688
Whatever it was,

1764
01:12:24,731 --> 01:12:26,385
his accomplice recorded
a series of conversations,

1765
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:27,473
spliced them together,

1766
01:12:27,517 --> 01:12:29,257
poisoned him with the toxin,

1767
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:31,521
and... problem solved.

1768
01:12:31,564 --> 01:12:33,697
I just got off
the phone with the merchant bank

1769
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,307
where jenkin had a meeting
the morning of his murder,

1770
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,744
and his investigation
was spot on.

1771
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:39,093
Layton and his partner

1772
01:12:39,137 --> 01:12:40,356
did have a meeting at the bank

1773
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,574
several weeks earlier

1774
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:43,315
about raising funds
for a food conglomerate

1775
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,273
that involved
a frozen food line,

1776
01:12:45,317 --> 01:12:46,797
cooking schools,
a line of books, the works.

1777
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,798
That's right.

1778
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:49,626
That's why jenkin had photos

1779
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:51,889
of Sally aldrin
and Oliver Paige.

1780
01:12:51,932 --> 01:12:54,282
They were going to be
part of this new food empire.

1781
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:57,329
Layton and his partner
were planning all of this

1782
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,679
without Raymond and Peter
knowing anything about it.

1783
01:12:59,723 --> 01:13:01,115
Why did nobody mention
any of this

1784
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:02,116
during interrogation?

1785
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,335
As far as they were concerned,

1786
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,119
these were just
individual conversations.

1787
01:13:05,163 --> 01:13:06,425
They had no idea

1788
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:07,948
that they were part
of some grand conspiracy,

1789
01:13:07,992 --> 01:13:09,297
or even the fact

1790
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:10,386
that they were connected
to Ian jenkin's murder.

1791
01:13:10,429 --> 01:13:12,953
And do you want
to know the best part?

1792
01:13:12,997 --> 01:13:14,564
What's the best part?

1793
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:16,609
Our I.T. Guys were able
to unlock that flash drive

1794
01:13:16,653 --> 01:13:18,437
Ian jenkin
so desperately wanted.

1795
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:21,005
Layton's partner
at that meeting...

1796
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,660
Was pauline duquette.

1797
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:38,239
'Kay, thanks.

1798
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:40,459
Scarponi just confirmed
taking photos

1799
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:41,460
of pauline and Layton kissing.

1800
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:43,070
Why didn't he mention that
earlier?

1801
01:13:43,114 --> 01:13:44,985
Said he didn't bring it up
because it didn't look unusual.

1802
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:47,335
Just two people outside a bank
like any other couple.

1803
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:48,728
Jenkin knew what it meant.

1804
01:13:48,772 --> 01:13:50,121
Yeah.

1805
01:13:50,164 --> 01:13:51,775
That's why Layton stole
the flash drive.

1806
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:53,472
He was worried
about incriminating photos.

1807
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:55,169
They were behind it
from the beginning.

1808
01:13:55,213 --> 01:13:56,649
Layton's been sabotaging
filmore bistro

1809
01:13:56,693 --> 01:13:58,434
and pauline was doing
the same thing to Chez duquette.

1810
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:15,625
Bailey, munro, cover the back.

1811
01:14:17,931 --> 01:14:19,193
Hey, you, stay here.

1812
01:14:19,237 --> 01:14:20,456
What, are you kidding me?

1813
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:21,892
We're not dealing
with the Russian mob here.

1814
01:14:21,935 --> 01:14:23,502
What's she going to do,
throw poisoned fish at us?

1815
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:25,417
Oh, my god... Henry!

1816
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:26,636
Stay behind me!

1817
01:14:32,076 --> 01:14:33,251
Pauline duquette,
you're under arrest

1818
01:14:33,294 --> 01:14:34,382
for the murders of Ian jenkin

1819
01:14:34,426 --> 01:14:35,427
and Layton Leopold.

1820
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,515
Excuse me?

1821
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:38,474
The spliced recording
and suicide note

1822
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:39,910
were a nice touch,
although, frankly,

1823
01:14:39,953 --> 01:14:41,085
I could have done
without the knife in my kitchen.

1824
01:14:44,392 --> 01:14:47,047
At what point did you realize
you needed to get rid of Layton?

1825
01:14:47,091 --> 01:14:48,396
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1826
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,485
I imagine he was
feeling very guilty

1827
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:51,399
about the death of Ian jenkin,

1828
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:53,532
because that was never part
of the plan, was it?

1829
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:56,970
Ian forced your hand
when he confronted you.

1830
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,408
You're the one
who poisoned him at the dinner.

1831
01:15:05,152 --> 01:15:06,980
This is ridiculous.

1832
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:08,242
What proof do you have?

1833
01:15:08,286 --> 01:15:09,548
Aside from the fact that we know

1834
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:10,723
that you and Layton
were a couple

1835
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:11,768
and have photos to prove it,

1836
01:15:11,811 --> 01:15:14,074
and that you were
taking meetings

1837
01:15:14,118 --> 01:15:15,162
at the merchant bank

1838
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:16,729
about merging
your two restaurants,

1839
01:15:16,773 --> 01:15:19,123
what I think
will really please the judge

1840
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:22,256
is that ttb is such
a virulent toxin,

1841
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,173
that even if you wear gloves
and scour your hands after,

1842
01:15:26,217 --> 01:15:29,916
traces of the airborne molecules
remain on your skin for days.

1843
01:15:31,135 --> 01:15:33,485
You have the right
to remain silent.

1844
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,660
Anything you say

1845
01:15:34,704 --> 01:15:35,618
can and will be used
against you...

1846
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:37,097
Whoa!

1847
01:15:37,141 --> 01:15:39,360
Whoa.
Pauline...

1848
01:15:41,232 --> 01:15:42,146
Pauline, put the gun down.

1849
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:46,542
Give me the gun.

1850
01:16:04,168 --> 01:16:04,995
It was unloaded.

1851
01:16:06,518 --> 01:16:08,476
My uncle keeps it for
when he's working late.

1852
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,001
It makes him feel safer.

1853
01:16:12,872 --> 01:16:14,178
Cuff yourself to the radiator.

1854
01:16:27,844 --> 01:16:29,715
And give me the keys.

1855
01:16:36,069 --> 01:16:37,201
You're coming with me.

1856
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,421
Come on, let's go.

1857
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:43,599
Let's go!

1858
01:17:08,232 --> 01:17:09,929
Through the kitchen.

1859
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:11,235
Go!

1860
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:19,722
Move, let's go!

1861
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:20,679
Police!
Drop the weapon!

1862
01:17:20,723 --> 01:17:22,028
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1863
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:24,509
Pauline, drop the gun.

1864
01:17:27,686 --> 01:17:28,687
Stay back!

1865
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:30,646
Okay, everybody, just calm down.

1866
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:32,125
Everything is under control,
all right?

1867
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:36,390
You and Layton were going
to run down both restaurants

1868
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:37,696
to the point

1869
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,697
where you could buy them
off of Peter and Raymond

1870
01:17:38,741 --> 01:17:39,698
for a great price.

1871
01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:41,482
Right?

1872
01:17:41,526 --> 01:17:44,137
It was actually
a brilliant plan.

1873
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:46,052
You and Layton, your lover,

1874
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:48,315
leveraging both restaurants

1875
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:49,926
to woo investors
into a whole new food empire

1876
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:52,972
that put you both
at the center of it all.

1877
01:17:54,757 --> 01:17:56,106
I have to admire your ambition.

1878
01:17:58,151 --> 01:18:00,501
Except that
after you killed jenkin,

1879
01:18:00,545 --> 01:18:01,589
Layton got cold feet,

1880
01:18:01,633 --> 01:18:04,462
and he started
to panic, didn't he?

1881
01:18:04,505 --> 01:18:06,682
Because Layton never planned
on this turning into murder.

1882
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:08,553
Okay, I'm warning you!

1883
01:18:08,596 --> 01:18:09,380
Okay, Maggie, could you just...

1884
01:18:13,297 --> 01:18:15,299
Listen, pauline...

1885
01:18:17,127 --> 01:18:20,913
I have known you
your entire life.

1886
01:18:20,957 --> 01:18:23,611
Think of what you're doing
to Peter.

1887
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:26,440
He loves you so much.

1888
01:18:26,484 --> 01:18:28,791
You're the daughter
he never had.

1889
01:18:31,315 --> 01:18:33,056
This restaurant

1890
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:35,536
has been part
of your family's history

1891
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,061
for the past 80 years.

1892
01:18:38,104 --> 01:18:40,237
Don't let it end like this.

1893
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:44,067
It doesn't have to.
It's not too late.

1894
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:46,765
Look...

1895
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:49,812
You owe it to your family.

1896
01:18:50,987 --> 01:18:52,510
You owe it to Peter.

1897
01:18:55,818 --> 01:18:57,515
Two people have died.

1898
01:18:59,038 --> 01:18:59,865
It's over.

1899
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:03,956
I'm so sorry, Henry.

1900
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:07,481
I didn't mean for it
to be this way.

1901
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:10,920
It just...
It got out of hand.

1902
01:19:10,963 --> 01:19:12,704
You have the right
to remain silent.

1903
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,488
Anything you do say

1904
01:19:14,532 --> 01:19:15,707
will be used against you
in a court of law.

1905
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:19,798
You have the right
to an attorney.

1906
01:19:19,842 --> 01:19:20,712
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

1907
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,019
one will be appointed to you.

1908
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,561
Well, I, um...

1909
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:46,042
Hate to say it, but nicely done.

1910
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,610
Well, something had to be done.

1911
01:19:49,654 --> 01:19:50,655
If I left it up to you,

1912
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:53,049
clearly,
I was going to get shot.

1913
01:19:53,092 --> 01:19:54,746
Excuse me?

1914
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,834
If it weren't for me

1915
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:57,401
and two other armed detectives,

1916
01:19:57,444 --> 01:19:58,837
you would never be seen again.

1917
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:00,186
So I think the words
that you're looking for

1918
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,014
are, "thank you".

1919
01:20:02,058 --> 01:20:03,711
Thank you?
Really?

1920
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:05,191
'Cause at the rate
you were going,

1921
01:20:05,235 --> 01:20:06,845
she was going to shoot me first,
then take aim at you.

1922
01:20:06,889 --> 01:20:08,107
I mean,
you should be thanking me

1923
01:20:08,151 --> 01:20:09,413
for saving both our lives.

1924
01:20:09,456 --> 01:20:10,806
Are you kidding me?

1925
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:12,546
Do you always antagonize
an armed criminal like that?

1926
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:13,852
Because if we're ever
going to partner up again...

1927
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:14,984
Trust me,

1928
01:20:15,027 --> 01:20:15,767
you and I will never
work together again.

1929
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:16,812
I'm just saying...

1930
01:20:16,855 --> 01:20:17,813
Stop talking, Henry.

1931
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:20,380
I'm just saying, if we did...

1932
01:20:20,424 --> 01:20:21,381
Oh my god!

1933
01:20:21,425 --> 01:20:22,905
You cannot stop, can you?

1934
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:24,080
Is it impossible

1935
01:20:24,123 --> 01:20:25,385
for you to just
keep your mouth closed

1936
01:20:25,429 --> 01:20:27,300
for two minutes?

1937
01:20:27,344 --> 01:20:28,824
Make a left up here
if we're going to be...

1938
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:30,260
Don't tell me how to drive.

1939
01:20:36,919 --> 01:20:38,398
Say cheese!

1940
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:43,664
Parents, please be seated
so we can start.

1941
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,362
Go get 'em,
girl. Okay?

1942
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:47,581
Once the buzzer goes
and our kids start playing,

1943
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,409
there will be no talking.

1944
01:20:49,453 --> 01:20:50,846
You'll do great!

1945
01:20:53,283 --> 01:20:54,240
Hey.

1946
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:56,590
You know your dad
would be here if he could be.

1947
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:57,940
Sure, Mom.

1948
01:21:06,209 --> 01:21:07,297
Henry!

1949
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:09,516
Sorry I'm late,
I couldn't find parking.

1950
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,953
What?

1951
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:12,084
I invited him.

1952
01:21:12,128 --> 01:21:13,912
You did?

1953
01:21:13,956 --> 01:21:15,435
Watch your corridors,

1954
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:17,655
and don't bring your queen
out too soon, okay?

1955
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:19,135
Okay. Got it.

1956
01:21:25,706 --> 01:21:28,448
Should we, uh, grab a seat?

1957
01:21:31,451 --> 01:21:33,105
Sure. Yeah,
I, um...

1958
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:35,629
I have a few
reserved right here.

1959
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:36,500
Perfect.

1960
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,639
All right, players.

1961
01:21:45,683 --> 01:21:46,858
Have fun.

1962
01:21:53,169 --> 01:21:54,518
Thank you.

1963
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:55,562
For coming.

1964
01:21:57,477 --> 01:21:58,348
That was very kind of you.

1965
01:21:58,391 --> 01:22:01,351
I'm glad to be here.
