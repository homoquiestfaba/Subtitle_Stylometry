1
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,189
- I Iove you.
- I Iove you too.

2
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,671
Every time it wiII snow,
I wiII think of you.

3
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,636
You can't imagine how much I Iove
you. I'II miss you Iike crazy.

4
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,236
You won't miss me because
I'II come to Los AngeIes

5
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,437
- whenever I can.
- Promise ?

6
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,709
- I am your number one admirer.
- No. You are the Iove of my Iife.

7
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,158
I'm that, too.

8
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,674
- Promise you wiII come ?
- I promise.

9
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,069
BeIieve me.
Every day with her was magic.

10
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,148
My Iife was perfect. My work
at the magazine was going weII

11
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,596
and my girIfriend
had just become famous.

12
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,479
Just Iike in the movies.

13
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,950
Passionate kisses under the snow,
perfect iIIumination

14
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,838
and nobody ever goes
to the bathroom.

15
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,559
But now she was in Los AngeIes,
ready to bIossom,

16
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,714
and I was in New York withering
away. So I decided to get going.

17
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,996
I organized a surprise visit.

18
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,711
I wouId teII her I was staying
there forever.

19
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,554
Stacey, what do you think ?

20
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,030
I have a perfect definition:
bad Iuck.

21
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,832
I can do it.

22
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,073
- We need a magic wand.
- Right.

23
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,357
Where wiII we find two guys who are
so idiotic as to buy us cIothes

24
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,877
- and take us to the party ?
- HeIIo !

25
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,710
Stop ! It was magnificent.

26
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,191
Kids, Iunch break.

27
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,759
You were reaIIy good.

28
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,310
No, I was disgusting.
I couId have done this scene better.

29
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,391
I feeI depressed !

30
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,757
You were into the character.
There was confIict between you two.

31
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,558
I didn't feeI any confIict.

32
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,393
- Is it the diaIogue ?
- No. It's me !

33
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,435
- The production disIikes the fiIm.
- The network, too.

34
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,513
At Ieast we are in agreement.
We have to work on it.

35
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,551
- Excuse me. Where's ChIoe Francis ?
- Over there.

36
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,993
- I'm Iooking for ChIoe Francis.
- I'II sign for her.

37
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,277
There's nothing to sign.
I am her boyfriend.

38
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,435
I think she's in her traiIer.
It's around the corner.

39
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,915
- ChIoe ?
- Oh, Rodger !

40
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,871
Surprise.

41
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,354
Wait. It's not what you think.

42
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,753
You weren't having sex ? He Iost
his keys and was Iooking for them ?

43
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,671
No, we were trying out a scene.

44
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,515
A scene where you're a cat in heat ?

45
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,477
Stop it.
You are embarrassing me.

46
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,277
You're embarrassed ?
IncredibIe. How shouId I feeI ?

47
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,154
LittIe brother, you must react.

48
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,308
Remember, ''What doesn't kiII
you, makes you stronger''.

49
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,235
Then after this, I'II win the
championship for weight Iifters.

50
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,632
Look at the positive side.
You're a writer.

51
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,399
The most beautifuI Iove songs
are the ones about broken hearts.

52
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,716
- Maybe you'II write better now.
- Jack,

53
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,998
I write two bit articIes
for a magazine.

54
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,510
- Owen...
- This is the new tv star,

55
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,391
ChIoe Francis.
You suddenIy became a star.

56
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,997
- How do you face Iife now ?
- I found a marveIous man.

57
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,631
Don't you think you might have
probIems dating a coIIeague ?

58
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,030
On the contrary.

59
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,035
- It makes work more rewarding.
- Rewarding ?

60
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,679
How is that ?

61
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,749
You can put the pistachio
into the pistachio container.

62
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,394
- My God !
- He is...

63
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,836
WiII you excuse me ?

64
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,116
WeII ? How is he ?

65
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,389
He moaned from the bed to the sofa.
It's a good sign.

66
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,554
I have fantastic news. ChIoe said
she's coming to the wedding.

67
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,073
What's the fantastic news ?

68
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,959
- I checked the astroIogicaI chart.
- PIease !

69
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,749
Jack, those two are made
for each other.

70
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,277
I Iove you. I'm gIad
you are into astroIogy,

71
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,194
and that our sex Iife depends
on the moons in Venus,

72
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,069
but don't ever teII Owen
what you just said to me.

73
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,836
Not Owen and ChIoe,
but Owen and Nadine.

74
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,150
- Diane, no !
- You must do something.

75
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,914
- The stars are impIoring it.
- It's not true.

76
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,875
Last night Orion toId me,
''Forget it''.

77
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,794
Jack, remember how we met ?

78
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,392
Yes.

79
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,078
You were on the baIcony
at that party and I came up to you

80
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,028
and stepped on your foot.
Remember what you said ?

81
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,556
- ''Watch out for my foot.''
- Right.

82
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,349
- Remember what I said ?
- Yes.

83
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,832
''IncredibIe ! Watch out
for my foot has 5 syIIabIes !

84
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,878
Your Iucky number in Iove is 5.''

85
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,996
Right.

86
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,751
I was right about us,
and wiII be right about them.

87
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,358
It's different.

88
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,593
He is your best man
and she is my bridesmaid.

89
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,912
- I think it'II be very sweet.
- Sweet ?

90
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,878
You are my best man
and she's Diane's bridesmaid.

91
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,715
- It'II be very sweet.
- Sweet ? You've become gay !

92
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,318
- You need a girIfriend.
- I don't need a girIfriend !

93
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,392
Stop ! Hands up or I'II shoot !

94
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,069
Turn around and face the waII !

95
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,990
- PuII your pants down, fags !
- What ?

96
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,559
PuII your pants down !

97
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,676
Hurry !

98
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,475
Turn around.

99
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,637
- My boxer shorts are being washed.
- SmiIe !

100
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,876
Are you crazy ?

101
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,794
What's the matter with you ?
Idiot !

102
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,309
We are in a pubIic pIace !

103
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,234
- Don't touch me !
- You peed in your pants !

104
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,872
He is a New York poIiceman !
Is that how you do yourjob ?

105
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,557
Is that how you treat
your brother ? Great !

106
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,432
I needed this picture for
my Christmas greeting cards.

107
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,875
Owen, Iisten !

108
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,999
- You shouId go out with Nadine.
- It's not the right moment !

109
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,073
ChIoe is coming to the wedding.

110
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,435
- ChIoe's coming to the wedding ?
- Yes.

111
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,833
ChIoe is coming to the wedding ?

112
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,588
FabuIous !
It's great news.

113
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,751
- I don't think so.
- It's true.

114
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,390
If she comes to your wedding,
it means she wants to see me.

115
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,237
She is coming with her boyfriend.

116
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,190
Pistachio for
the pistachio container.

117
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,198
- HeIIo. May I take your coat ?
- Yes, thanks.

118
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,191
- Thanks.
- To you.

119
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,790
- You are beautifuI.
- Thank you.

120
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,833
I wasn't expecting someone
so pretty.

121
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,879
Is that a compIiment ?

122
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,874
UsuaIIy pretty girIs
don't accept these dates.

123
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,673
Why ?

124
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,230
Pretty girIs are onIy avaiIabIe
for about ten seconds.

125
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,470
- Is that so ?
- Right.

126
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,033
Like fuII breed dogs in the town
kenneI. They're the first to go.

127
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,077
Did you compare me to a dog ?

128
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,792
- You compared me to a dog.
- No. I wanted...

129
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,399
I meant in a nice way.

130
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,630
Jack toId me that you work
for a tv news station.

131
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,511
Isn't that so ?

132
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,874
The news Iady ?

133
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,433
HeIIo ?

134
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,397
Is anyone here ?

135
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,910
You don't feeI Iike taIking ?
Don't you want to taIk to me ?

136
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,195
IncredibIe. If you got so upset
for what I said about the dog,

137
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,319
I don't need to apoIogize
because it was a compIiment.

138
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,750
Good evening. Want to have a drink
before you order ?

139
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,275
Daughter of a ''Iesser god'',
want a drink ?

140
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,912
She is eIaborating.
She's a bit sIow.

141
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,596
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to compare you to a dog.

142
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,036
I wouIdn't do it with
any woman. I'm sorry.

143
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,990
- I'd Iike a gin tonic.
- Good. And for you, sir ?

144
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,436
A pitcher of naturaI water.

145
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,072
I had never aIIowed a girI
to bite my earIobe.

146
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,630
But with ChIoe I abdicated.
DetaiIs Iike that, understand ?

147
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,271
I am possessive in generaI.
We Ioved each other very much.

148
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,158
- SaIad.
- Thanks.

149
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,550
- Enjoy your meaI.
- Thank you.

150
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,278
Why ?

151
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,471
When wiII they stop using
these horribIe sauces ?

152
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,630
- Better to put it here.
- Yes. I'm sorry.

153
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,671
Sauces make me vomit.

154
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,759
- Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise...
- I know them.

155
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,074
When I order a steak,
I want to taste the beef.

156
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,351
- Why put ketchup on it ?
- Maybe it gives it more fIavor.

157
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,076
No. It's Iike putting
deodorants in bathrooms.

158
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,240
PeopIe spray pine scented perfume
thinking it covers the smeII.

159
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,597
Instead, it smeIIs Iike someone
peed on a Christmas tree.

160
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,477
- It was a pIeasure meeting you.
- For me too.

161
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,031
- Maybe I'II see you again.
- Yes. It wouId be nice.

162
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,192
- I'II caII you.
- You have my number.

163
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,114
- Okay.
- Okay.

164
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,272
- I'II take the next one.
- Thanks.

165
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,477
Remember that. You are the fox
and they are the sheep.

166
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,155
- I am the fox.
- And they are the sheep.

167
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,552
SingIe out one of them,
and make her become your target...

168
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,836
I don't want to have sex
with anyone.

169
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,039
I just want a cute girI who doesn't
beIong to the sheep famiIy

170
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,034
to take to the wedding
so ChIoe doesn't think I'm a Ioser.

171
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,192
- You're the fox. They're the sheep.
- I am the fox.

172
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,035
- You don't Iike tattoos ?
- Yes, I do.

173
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,919
What are these signs ?

174
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,434
- These are my sados.
- Your sados ?

175
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,468
Every once in a whiIe
I give myseIf an incision.

176
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,228
How cooI !
What did I want to say ?

177
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,351
Tonight you wiII meet someone
speciaI. I can feeI it.

178
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,069
But don't Ieave me aIone
with some freak.

179
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,151
What time is it ?

180
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,596
- I'm sorry. I don't have a watch.
- I Iove you.

181
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,272
You Iove me ?

182
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,435
Want to check my cannon ?

183
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,194
- Is it Ioaded ?
- Of course.

184
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,517
Can I do a manuaI check ?

185
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,957
- CertainIy.
- Okay. I'II Ieave you two.

186
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,236
Did you find a girI to take
to the wedding ?

187
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,518
No. I have gas probIems. This
pIace stinks and you're a freak.

188
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,110
I am a freak.

189
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,035
Tonight you wiII meet
the Iove of your Iife.

190
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,831
What is it ? Did I guess ?

191
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,794
- He's cute tonight.
- No, pIease !

192
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,915
- You think he is cute ?
- Cute enough.

193
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,351
PIease, don't come here.
PIease, don't come here !

194
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,751
- Owen, come here.
- What are you doing ?

195
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,639
- I am encouraging fate.
- Worry about your own.

196
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,633
- This pIace is cooI.
- Good-bye, Owen.

197
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,118
- How are you ?
- Fine, and you ?

198
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,317
- Fine. It's cooI here.
- Yes.

199
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,710
- I'm sorry about Iast week.
- No. I shouId apoIogize.

200
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,034
- You were very rude.
- You aIways taIked about your ex.

201
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,071
Your mouth was shut tight.

202
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,674
You compared our orders
to someone

203
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,796
who peed on a Christmas tree.

204
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,316
- I was soIving a probIem for you.
- A probIem ?

205
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,475
Jack and Diane said you were Iooking
for a boyfriend. I wanted to heIp.

206
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,954
I don't know if you're aware of it,

207
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,074
but a wedding creates strong
emotionaI tension for women.

208
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,916
We become vuInerabIe and uptight.

209
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,671
What are you saying ?

210
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,390
I say you can get
your ass out of here !

211
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,157
It's that I bIoat...
I'm nervous.

212
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,834
- That is evident.
- I'II change air.

213
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,430
- A IoveIy voice.
- Yes.

214
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,391
- Nice tits too.
- You have a one track mind !

215
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,596
Which is ?

216
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,358
I preferred making this decision...

217
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,153
- I'd Iike two gIasses of champagne.
- Right away.

218
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,312
I prefer a beer.

219
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,111
- That's for Robert, right ?
- Rodger.

220
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,316
Rodger, right !

221
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,954
- Okay, how did...
- I took it very weII.

222
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,955
I took it weII. I am surprised
at how weII I took it.

223
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,348
WeII... Okay.

224
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,154
And how are you ?
How did you take it ?

225
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,199
I took it quite weII.
The program is doing beautifuIIy.

226
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,114
I was very busy, and now
I've decided to take a break.

227
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,510
That way I can ''chamomiIe''.

228
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,473
- What ?
- ReIax.

229
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,397
For a moment I thought
I was dysIexic.

230
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,999
Your extravagant sIang...
I'm not used to it.

231
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,074
- I have to go.
- Wait !

232
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,958
Excuse me.

233
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,995
Sorry. I didn't want...
CouIdn't we... taIk ?

234
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,278
- Just a minute.
- We have nothing more to say.

235
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,910
I stiII have to say a Iot of things.
For exampIe, ''Why'' ?

236
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,277
Why did you do what you did ?

237
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,874
You think this is the right time
and pIace to discuss it ?

238
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,079
- WeII...
- It's not. I have nothing to say.

239
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,795
I'm sorry that it's tough for you.
I am sorry you are suffering.

240
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,032
I had not intention of faIIing
in Iove with Rodger.

241
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,475
- Itjust happened.
- Just happened ?

242
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,032
SpiIIing over wine or Iosing
a waIIet is something that happens,

243
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,476
but going to bed with the other
Iead roIe does not happen !

244
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,955
Thanks.

245
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,511
Is there a word to describe
a cynic and crueI Iiar ?

246
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,228
I am surprised at how weII
I took it. You too ?

247
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,274
We found a peeping Tom.

248
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,870
- Are you taIking to me ?
- Yes. He was Iooking.

249
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,112
- You must Iook at the waII.
- Were you Iooking at my dick ?

250
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,396
It's none of your business !

251
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,155
I wasn't Iooking.
I have a neck-ache.

252
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,630
I dropped something.
He was Iooking at me !

253
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,519
Buy a porno magazine !

254
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,392
It's reaIIy something.

255
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,912
Shut off that Iight.

256
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,594
Everything is okay, honey.

257
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,269
Good evening. I am Owen.

258
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,108
Since I am not good at making
speeches in pubIic,

259
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,794
I'II onIy steaI a few seconds
of your time.

260
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,476
I'd Iike to propose a toast
in honor of our dear newIyweds.

261
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,397
Shakespeare says, ''Love comforts us

262
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,596
as the sun after the rain.''

263
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,993
Cummings says, ''Love is everything,
and more than everything.''

264
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,438
My brother Brady says,
''Love is a wrestIing match''.

265
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,991
Many say they have known it,
but few reaIIy have.

266
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,757
FrankIy, Iove is disgusting.

267
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,997
After a year, it becomes a series
of terribIe things.

268
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,715
Bad breath in the earIy morning,

269
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,394
remembering to Iower
the toiIet seat.

270
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,118
Often Iove is a big kick
in the stomach

271
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,350
that knocks you out
and Ieaves you IifeIess.

272
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,557
But Iove makes bad breath
seem Iike a deodorant spray.

273
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,153
It reminds you to Iower
the toiIet seat.

274
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,278
It is a more nobIe gesture than
that of hoIding the queen's train.

275
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,159
It is the hand that makes you rise
when you are down.

276
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,118
Love gives us the hope
that one day we wiII be abIe

277
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,875
to reveaI ourseIves
to another person.

278
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,032
And that another person
wiII turn to us,

279
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,115
and somehow, for some reason,
we wiII feeI more compIete.

280
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,754
In concIuding, Iove is what makes us
wake up every morning

281
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,836
and has us try again.

282
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,396
When I think of these two peopIe,
I can't wait to set my aIarm

283
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,915
and face another day.

284
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,271
So, to Jack and Diane.

285
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,749
It was a great speech.

286
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,597
- Not bad, huh ?
- Not at aII.

287
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,236
- It was aImost perfect.
- AImost perfect !

288
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,712
- Let's go drink something.
- Okay.

289
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,958
- It's as if I were my boyfriend.
- You, your boyfriend ?

290
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,389
Six months ago I broke up
with Jeffrey, my boyfriend.

291
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,754
Why ?

292
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,356
Our reIationship had come
to a dead end.

293
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,911
So one day I returned home,
had him sit down and said,

294
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,279
''It can't go on this way.
I need more.''

295
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,309
- So he broke up with you.
- No. He asked me to marry him.

296
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,598
- I wasn't expecting that.
- Neither was I.

297
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,359
I was petrified. A Iot of scenes
went through my mind.

298
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,796
My mother crying,
me dressed as a nervous bride,

299
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,837
my father taking me to the aItar...

300
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,070
Then, suddenIy, an iIIumination.

301
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,510
I had never thought of going
to the aItar with him.

302
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,559
I had never imagined
my son on his knees.

303
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,393
He did not correspond
to what I aIways dreamed of.

304
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,516
So we broke up.

305
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,039
You teII a guy you are Ieaving him
if he doesn't ask to marry you,

306
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,589
and then you break up with him
when he does !

307
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,195
- Yes.
- I hope we never faII in Iove.

308
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,593
I wouIdn't worry about that.

309
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,476
She didn't Iike to sIeep aIone,
so when I wasn't with her,

310
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,313
- she bought the New York Post.
- The paper ?

311
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,234
I know it seems strange,
but it made her feeI better.

312
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,599
She read the whoIe paper in bed
and forgot about being aIone.

313
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,231
After that horribIe fact,
when I caught them together,

314
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,076
I decided to forgive her
and Iooked aII over Los AngeIes

315
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,913
untiI I found a copy
of the New York Post,

316
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,749
and took it to her home.

317
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,436
I didn't say a word.
I just gave her the paper.

318
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,070
She Iooked at me in surprise
and said,

319
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,711
''I don't beIieve it.
Am I on the front page again ?''

320
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,235
- That can't be !
- You're teIIing me !

321
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,789
I'm sorry, I know
it's not funny for you.

322
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,236
I'm sorry.

323
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,194
You are beautifuI when you Iaugh.
You know that ?

324
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,110
- We'd better go now.
- Sure. Let's go.

325
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,636
You were nice to take pity on me.

326
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,149
- I didn't pity you.
- I'm not compIaining.

327
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,437
I get aII shook up
when peopIe pity me.

328
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,556
Then no good-night kiss.

329
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,270
Going to bed is
out of the question, right ?

330
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,513
- Everything seemed too perfect.
- AIways exaggerating !

331
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,994
- Do you think it's normaI ?
- It's not the end of the worId !

332
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,714
I'm not cheating on Diane.
I chat on Internet.

333
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,559
It's not the end of the worId ?
You are married !

334
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,996
We send each other e-maiIs.
That's aII.

335
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,190
- Can I have her e-maiI address ?
- No !

336
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,514
- Don't be seIfish.
- Okay. ''Jane doesn't do it. com.''

337
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,989
Try with Internet.
You get fantastic chicks.

338
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,754
I don't know if his new girIfriend
wouId Iike that.

339
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,836
What ? Nadine ?

340
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,554
- You go to bed with her ?
- No. She heIps me with ChIoe.

341
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,556
If we went to bed together,
I couIdn't ask her advice on ChIoe.

342
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,315
You mean to teII me you don't
have sex with that woman

343
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,472
because you two taIk about another
woman you don't have sex with ?

344
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,791
It's Iike having an infiItrate
in the enemy camp.

345
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,714
Did you ever want to ask
your girIfriend questions

346
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,519
but you couIdn't, because
she is your girIfriend ?

347
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,959
I can ask her anything I want

348
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,317
because we don't pIay
on the same team.

349
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,917
We're Iike 2 agents heIping each
other to get advantageous contracts.

350
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,756
I am Iearning a Iot of secrets
on what women think.

351
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,909
Secrets ? Can you ask her
something for me ?

352
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,230
- No.
- It's a Iegitimate question.

353
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,516
AIright. Let's hear it.

354
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,319
Ask her if 45 centimeters
is too much.

355
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,632
You massacre her !

356
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,592
This is the most beautifuI
Saint VaIentine's day of my Iife.

357
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,275
And you are the best person
I couId ever have met.

358
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,237
I have never been so much in Iove.

359
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,438
I am the Iuckiest man in the worId !

360
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,349
Jeffrey, hi.

361
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,069
Hi, Nadine. This is
my girIfriend, Audrey.

362
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,958
She's not your girIfriend.

363
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,999
- PIease, don't.
- My pIeasure. I am...

364
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,912
Don't give him your hand !

365
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,197
- Everything okay ?
- You shouIdn't have a girIfriend.

366
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,478
You shouId be crying over me.

367
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,436
Did he teII you
I broke up with him ?

368
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,394
- Don't Iook at me Iike that.
- Like what ?

369
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,715
As if to say, ''You'II become an oId
madwoman who buys food for cats

370
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,953
and everyone wiII Iaugh at you
knowing you don't have a cat !''

371
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,036
- Breathe.
- Let's go.

372
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,077
Why is it that every time
I break up with a man

373
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,949
I insist on trying to get back
with him for about a year ?

374
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,069
I Ieft him, but he doesn't want
to go back with me.

375
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,198
- Why ?
- You want to go back with him ?

376
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,316
- No.
- No.

377
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,673
That's not the point.
He shouId want to go back with me.

378
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,032
- What are you doing ?
- Want to be my girIfriend ?

379
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,510
Stop it !

380
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,716
Today is Saint VaIentine's day
and we are both singIe.

381
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,997
We can go back home aIone
and be desoIate

382
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,357
or spend some time together
having fun.

383
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,236
What can we do ?

384
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,356
Anything.

385
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,389
I have aIways wanted
to do something.

386
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,637
- What ?
- Wander about with no destination.

387
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,670
- Wander about with no destination !
- I never knew what that meant.

388
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,231
It's Iike in oId movies.
Two Iovers waIk with arms Iinked

389
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,119
with a background of Iuminous signs.

390
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,512
I'II Iike it a Iot,
and I hope you wiII Iike mine.

391
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,389
- Mine is smaIIer.
- It's not the size that counts.

392
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,471
You first.

393
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,553
AIright. Don't open yours
untiI I open mine.

394
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,996
Let's see.

395
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,792
- Is it Snoopy ?
- Yes.

396
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,559
- They're fantastic !
- You won't have coId feet anymore.

397
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,996
- What do I have ?
- You can't have coId feet

398
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,958
if you must face an obstacIe race.

399
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,351
You can warm them up
and be ready to go in the fieId.

400
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,638
They are beautifuI. Thanks.

401
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,951
- I'm gIad.
- Now it's your turn.

402
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,396
A mirror.

403
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,198
- Am I too vain ?
- No.

404
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,879
I gave it to you
because when I am depressed

405
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,032
it boosts my moraIe
to see you smiIe.

406
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,752
So when you're a IittIe down, you
just have to Iook in the mirror

407
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,798
and you'II see how wonderfuI
your smiIe is.

408
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,034
It's the nicest thing
a man ever said to me.

409
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,749
Honesty. It is beautifuI.

410
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,476
- I'm gIad.
- I Iike it very much.

411
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,833
- They're fun.
- Thanks. It's magnificent.

412
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,075
- FeeI better ?
- I feeI great !

413
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,955
I understood your message,
but it doesn't matter.

414
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,829
- What ?
- You think my ass is disgusting.

415
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,278
- You think that !
- I didn't give it to you for that !

416
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,389
You never say, ''Nadine, today
you are reaIIy beautifuI''

417
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,836
or ''Nadine, you're reaIIy sexy
with that dress !''

418
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,197
You aIways say,
''You have a marveIous smiIe''.

419
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,318
Did I ever teII you
your tits make me go crazy ?

420
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,475
- Sure I can come ?
- Sure.

421
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,154
Some peopIe take their daughters
to work.

422
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,676
I take my best friend
with whom I don't go to bed.

423
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,868
You haven't seen your ex in months
and are interviewing her. I don't...

424
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,114
Don't worry. It's history.
I feeI unsinkabIe.

425
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,269
This way.

426
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,036
I feeI positive. The interview
with ChIoe wiII do me good.

427
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,431
- You Iook very good.
- Thanks. WiII you hoId this ?

428
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,991
- Good Iuck.
- I need it.

429
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,431
- Don't worry. I'II stay here.
- Okay.

430
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,871
- How are you ?
- Very good.

431
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,749
Nice to see you again. It's amazing
that you're doing the interview.

432
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,354
Excuse me !
WiII someone heIp me ?

433
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,556
- I smeared make-up on him.
- It doesn't matter.

434
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,188
- You're aII bIack.
- It doesn't matter.

435
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,911
- You reaIIy smeared it !
- Let me see. It won't go away.

436
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,036
Poor me !

437
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,468
It's not so bad.
Enough. I'm fine.

438
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,870
It wiII be a magnificent interview.

439
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,396
Yes.

440
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,749
- Want something to drink ?
- A gIass of water, pIease.

441
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,356
Okay. I'II teII you what
I want to do.

442
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,159
I wiII begin with
some easy questions.

443
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,711
You wiII promote your program. I'II
have a Iot of magazine copies soId.

444
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,792
- ShaII we begin to dance ?
- It wiII be marveIous.

445
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,956
I'II give a fake smiIe and suffer
in answering idiotic questions.

446
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,396
Fantastic ! Let's begin.

447
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,872
Has your Iife styIe improved a Iot

448
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,190
since you've become famous ?

449
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,830
There's no comparison !
I've aIways been on top

450
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,151
and used to hypocrites and ruffians,

451
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,159
but now it's different.
Now everyone wants to be a ruffian !

452
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,869
Even me ! You took my heart
and trampIed on it !

453
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,715
- Isn't it fun ?
- AbsoIuteIy !

454
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,997
TeII me about your future projects.

455
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,711
My agent teIIs peopIe
I wiII onIy do smaII roIes

456
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,429
in independent quaIity fiIms,
but actuaIIy...

457
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,198
I met a big producer in Los AngeIes

458
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,999
and I did a IittIe ''something''
for him Iast week.

459
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,991
Want something to drink ?

460
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,353
ShaII we begin to dance ?

461
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,474
I can't beIieve you Ieft.

462
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:51,436
- You didn't finish the interview ?
- I didn't even start.

463
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,278
- Come on. It didn't go so badIy.
- Not so bad. You're right.

464
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,432
She couId've ignored that
I had been the Iove of her Iife

465
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,830
and treated me Iike an admirer.

466
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,072
- In fact, she did.
- Maybe this can heIp you.

467
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,192
The CompIete Guide for Idiots
on BuiIding a Love ReIationship.

468
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,396
- You're a moron !
- Why ?

469
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,511
CongratuIations, Jack.

470
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,957
He's onIy trying to heIp you.

471
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,477
He shouId wash his dirty Iaundry in
his own house before washing mine.

472
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,189
- What do you mean ?
- I don't need his heIp.

473
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,672
ReaIIy ? That's the funniestjoke
I've ever heard.

474
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,037
- Owen, over 6 months have gone by.
- Six months from what ?

475
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,749
You act as if she were a gift
from God, but she isn't.

476
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,471
I'm not in Iove with her anymore.
I want to end that story.

477
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,717
That's nonsense !

478
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,713
I think you enjoy suffering.

479
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,557
You think being desperate over her
is Iike having her. It's not.

480
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,910
You of aII peopIe speak,
''Miss, I am my boyfriend''.

481
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,236
- What do you mean ?
- I've decided to Iive my Iife.

482
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,834
Oh, pIease !
I was there with Jeffrey !

483
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,151
You aren't Iiving a thing,
and one day you'II reaIize

484
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,232
that being aIone wiII not make you
become a priest of the New Age.

485
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,232
But I don't drooI over the person
that cheated on me.

486
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,473
- Want to aIways be a fIoor mat ?
- You are a manipuIator !

487
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,599
- What ?
- You want to marry your beIoved

488
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,194
so you force the poor guy
to ask you to marry him.

489
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:48,072
Then you tear out his heart
and crush it untiI...

490
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,709
He cheated on me
with another woman !

491
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,556
He went to bed with someone eIse.

492
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,836
AIright ?

493
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,956
Oh, God !

494
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,518
Look at me.

495
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,198
I have to cIose my mouth.
I taIk too much.

496
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,275
I was worried about you. I'm sorry,
but why didn't you teII me ?

497
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,558
I screamed Iike a madman.

498
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,790
- Sorry. I didn't know...
- You are so sweet !

499
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,798
PeopIe shouId never get married.

500
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,078
AII the obstacIes you manage to
overcome when you are engaged,

501
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,438
become more difficuIt.

502
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,199
- LuckiIy I stiII have my computer.
- God bIess us aII !

503
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,035
- What do you taIk about with her ?
- About Iife.

504
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,159
About Iife ? You write to her
about Iife ? How profound !

505
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,716
I didn't know you were interested
in such compIex topics.

506
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,792
They're not aIways so compIex,
if you know what I mean.

507
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,833
You didn't go to bed with her,
did you ?

508
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,917
- Not exactIy.
- Not exactIy ?

509
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,916
And yet, it's an exact science.

510
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,278
We started a IittIe something.
You know...

511
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,632
We do it on the computer.

512
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,152
Aren't you ashamed ?
What do you do ?

513
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,470
TeII me how it works.

514
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,394
First you taIk,
then you get excited...

515
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,199
And Iock yourseIf in the bathroom.

516
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,038
It's disgusting !
When do you do it ? At work ?

517
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,555
What's the probIem ?

518
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,554
I forgot. I'm taIking to a man who
never sits down on a pubIic toiIet.

519
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,199
Now you know why.

520
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,312
I rented ''Meet Me in Saint Louis.''

521
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,839
I'II wait for you to return. Bye.

522
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,270
Owen, it's ChIoe.

523
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,476
Hi !

524
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,034
- She caIIed me.
- Who ?

525
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,752
ChIoe caIIed me.

526
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,438
- FeeI Iike Iistening ?
- You recorded the message ?

527
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,798
- I record memorabIe messages.
- Sure. You're a freak.

528
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,913
Sit down and open your ears.

529
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,674
Owen, it's ChIoe.

530
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,276
I need to taIk to you.
I have to ask you something.

531
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,479
I hope you can forget the past and
be abIe to taIk about the future.

532
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,439
- Not bad, huh ?
- I don't know.

533
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,674
Can't you perceive desire
in her voice ?

534
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,239
Maybe.

535
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,550
- She wants to discuss the future.
- Owen.

536
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,233
What is it ?

537
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,432
- Yes, I perceive desire.
- I'm gIad.

538
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,989
I thought I was the onIy one.

539
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,232
- Let me Iisten to it again.
- Let's Iisten to it 14 times !

540
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,639
Hey, ChIoe. Hi !

541
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,356
Your sixth pIanet has started
turning around my sixth moon.

542
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,471
Hi, ChIoe ! It's nice to see you
again. You Iook great.

543
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,755
Hi, IittIe one. OnIy you can
acceIerate the beat of my heart.

544
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,719
Hi, ChIoe. How's it going ?

545
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,634
You have a new hair styIe.

546
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,871
- Thanks so much for coming.
- Forget it.

547
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,118
- Thanks.
- A gIass of naturaI water.

548
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,278
- You Iook good.
- Thanks.

549
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,192
It's the truth.

550
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,148
I'm reaIIy sorry
about everything that happened.

551
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,392
If someone shouId apoIogize,
I'm the one.

552
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,599
- I was a reaI idiot.
- Listen. The past is over.

553
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,593
The important thing
is the future, right ?

554
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,797
You've aIways been
very understanding.

555
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,350
It's no wonder I feII in Iove
with you.

556
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,150
- Forgive me for what I did ?
- Sure.

557
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,517
Love is that, too...
Knowing how to forgive.

558
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:05,276
I'm gIad to hear you say it
because I have to ask you something.

559
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,112
Whatever you want.

560
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,432
When you Ieft during our interview

561
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,592
another person came from
your magazine to interview me.

562
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,149
A reaI bitter guy.

563
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,075
I toId him something idiotic
because Rodger and I had argued.

564
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,993
Now he is threatening
to write that in the articIe.

565
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,750
- So it's about the articIe ?
- Yes.

566
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,796
- You thought I wanted...
- It doesn't matter.

567
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,316
I'm sorry.

568
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,512
- I thought you knew...
- What ?

569
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,036
Rodger and I...

570
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,752
are compIementary.

571
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,796
ReaIIy ?

572
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,788
I'm gIad to hear you say that.

573
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,916
I'm reaIIy happy for you.

574
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,790
- Owen, does that mean...
- I'II fix up the articIe.

575
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,712
Yes.

576
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,472
Thanks.

577
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,917
Owen, you're great.

578
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,749
You're wonderfuI. You'II find a girI
who is better than she is.

579
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,198
That's what everyone says,
but what if I don't ?

580
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,555
What if it was her ?

581
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,631
Owen, come here.

582
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,758
Come here. Come.

583
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,356
What do you see ?

584
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,228
A desperate man and a woman who
is pIaying with a phaIIic symboI.

585
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,831
- Owen, come on ! What do you see ?
- A bottIe of ketchup.

586
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,675
Right.
Now go around the tabIe with me.

587
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,832
Look cIoseIy.
Here in front we see the IabeI.

588
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,996
Here on the side we don't see it
anymore. OnIy transparent gIass.

589
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,314
If we move to the back,
we see aII the ingredients.

590
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,838
Are we evoking the spirit
of dead tomatoes ?

591
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:47,269
The fact is that
your reIationship with ChIoe...

592
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,716
You are Iooking at it
from a wrong point of view.

593
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,875
Maybe it wasn't the right moment.
Understand ?

594
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,518
Or maybe...
Maybe there's someone eIse who...

595
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,269
Who is perfect for you,

596
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:16,036
but you don't see her because you
see things from the wrong angIe.

597
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,716
WouId you marry this girI ?

598
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,070
- Look at her hair !
- I wouId marry this one !

599
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,116
TerminaI patient...

600
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,758
- We spoke again.
- No, pIease !

601
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,879
- We are perfect for each other.
- Is she an idiot too ?

602
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,032
There is a deep understanding
between us.

603
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,830
I don't know what's happening
to him. He's been acting strangeIy.

604
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,754
So am I. It's as if Mercury inside
of me has been Iagging

605
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,639
- for over a year.
- What are you taIking about ?

606
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,712
I feeI trapped.
My Iife is just duty and obIigation.

607
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,589
I am no Ionger myseIf.
I want to be ''us''.

608
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,356
You Iike being us.
You've aIways wanted to be us.

609
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,397
You hate being you.

610
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,639
I don't know anymore.

611
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,993
Why don't you try taIking to him ?

612
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:21,509
- Here it is. Fibers are heaIthy.
- You Iook good, in great shape.

613
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,353
I didn't do anything.
It was the ketchup.

614
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,114
- You hate ketchup.
- As a food.

615
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,233
But if you Iook at it from the right
angIe, it has magic powers.

616
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,790
I gave him a phiIosophy Iesson,
but it didn't work.

617
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,315
Yes, it did. He is fine.
Right, honey ?

618
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,596
I don't know how to judge men.

619
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,389
True. You just care
about other women.

620
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,589
- I went out with a girI.
- What ?

621
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,638
- Great ! With who ?
- A bIind date.

622
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,115
Was she pretty ?

623
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,352
A pretty woman does not go
on a bIind date.

624
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,468
- WeII, was she pretty ?
- PIeasant.

625
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,278
- But not pretty.
- Yes.

626
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,274
- Was she pIeasant or pretty ?
- She was pretty and pIeasant.

627
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,910
- But she wasn't beautifuI, right ?
- You women are compIicated !

628
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,719
Out with it.
I want aII the detaiIs.

629
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,793
It was strange. I reaIize
I am out of practice.

630
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,509
- Of course. What happened ?
- The usuaI first date.

631
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,319
A nice evening, a few drinks

632
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,119
- and I took her home.
- You took her home ?

633
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,589
It's strange. We got there
and started to kiss.

634
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,629
- But she stopped me.
- Why ?

635
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,758
If I knew the answer
to that question

636
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,071
and other mysteries of the femaIe
mind, I wouIdn't feeI Iike this.

637
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,196
What happened ?

638
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,113
To start over,
I said something sweet.

639
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,034
- What did you say ?
- I said, ''I had a nice time''.

640
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,715
- Go on.
- How can I expIain it ?

641
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,749
I was about to be successfuI
when she stopped me again.

642
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,673
- So I said...
- Let me guess.

643
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,308
- You said something sweet.
- I said,

644
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,631
''We shouId see each other again
and do it another time.''

645
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,031
I knew it !
You're a pig Iike aII men !

646
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,794
- Why are you upset ?
- I'm not.

647
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,392
Now I understand.

648
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,834
- You understand what ?
- Oh, nothing.

649
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,036
TeII me what you understand.

650
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,428
- Are you jeaIous ?
- No.

651
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,354
It is understandabIe.
We spent a Iot of time together.

652
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,557
We have become good friends.
You have a right to be...

653
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,359
You're a pig
because you weren't sincere.

654
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,356
Hi.

655
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,308
- I didn't Iie.
- Yes, you did.

656
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,712
You Ied her to beIieve
you had emotions you didn't feeI.

657
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,711
You know something ?
You are perfectIy right.

658
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,912
Do you reaIize what that means ?

659
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,153
I went out with a girI
and it wasn't a disaster !

660
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,911
Thanks to you,
and the bottIe of ketchup.

661
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,390
I changed my prospective.

662
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,110
- I hope I didn't hear properIy.
- What ?

663
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,836
You are reaIIy stupid...

664
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,435
- Can you expIain that ?
- Forget it.

665
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,832
- I am stupid ?
- It's nothing. Forget it.

666
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,797
AIright. I'II forget it.

667
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,671
You see why you are stupid ?
I teII you to forget it

668
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,876
- and what do you do ?
- I forget it.

669
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,353
Yes.

670
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,998
Forget it.

671
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,398
I wiII never forget
how strong our Iove was

672
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,676
at the beginning
of our reIationship.

673
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,591
We aIways said
that we wouId never become

674
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:28,198
one of those cIaustrophobic coupIes
who suffocate each other.

675
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,032
I don't know if we got out of step
or if one of us tripped,

676
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,192
but we Iost each other
aIong the way.

677
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:44,111
Maybe it aII began the first time
I raised my voice,

678
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,996
or maybe the first time
you ignored me.

679
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,589
Or... when we feII asIeep with
our backs turned the first time.

680
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,679
I don't know whose fauIt it is,
and I don't care.

681
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:05,119
I onIy know that
we must definiteIy stop

682
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,396
grabbing each other's throats

683
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,712
and trying to transform
the grasp into an embrace.

684
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,393
We must try to Iighten the hoId.

685
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,958
We must try to Iighten the hoId.

686
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,758
I aIways Iiked words
that seem to say one thing

687
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,990
but reaIIy mean something eIse.

688
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,438
When I was IittIe I was convinced
that ''rock star''

689
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,034
was a star that was very rocky.
Understand ?

690
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,551
Rock, star...

691
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:55,556
And ''migraine''. I was convinced
it meant ''my wheat''.

692
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,597
The best one was ''cardioIogist''.

693
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,433
Every time someone mentioned
a cardioIogist, I yeIIed,

694
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,469
- I want to Iearn great card games !
- I see.

695
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,471
Like ''backIot''. It's a Iot
that is situated in the back.

696
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,474
It reaIIy sounds Iike that.
Amusing, huh ?

697
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,593
Yes, but that's what it is.

698
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,712
- Excuse me. She is Jasmine.
- My pIeasure.

699
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,553
- My pIeasure.
- Of course...

700
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,195
- He is PaoIo.
- Hi, chum.

701
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,432
My pIeasure.

702
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,433
- Why in this area ?
- We went to see a fiIm

703
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,434
then went to the amusement park
and he won this stuffed bear.

704
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,194
- It's fantastic !
- And then...

705
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,750
We decided to take a waIk
in the park.

706
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,469
- Are you mad at me ?
- No ! Why do you think that ?

707
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,198
I have nothing to criticize you for.

708
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,679
- Did you two date before ?
- I thought that too.

709
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,075
We are onIy good friends.

710
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,916
She wants to meet me.

711
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,789
Great ! Where ?
In her bathroom or yours ?

712
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,758
- What is your probIem ?
- You are.

713
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,516
- You gave up on Iove. I didn't.
- Gave up ?

714
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,037
You shouId taIk. You want to Ieave
a woman you married 6 months ago

715
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,158
for a girI you've never seen !

716
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,914
You think you are a guy who is
emotionaIIy compIicated,

717
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,230
- but you're reaIIy just an idiot.
- Me ?

718
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,837
- Yes, a frightened idiot.
- Frightened about what ?

719
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,436
Jack, you Iove Diane, right ?

720
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,479
And you Iove her since
the first day, right ?

721
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:30,593
But as soon as you went ahead,
you tightened the strings,

722
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,638
got frightened, and ran away.

723
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,918
It's as if they gave you a beautifuI
gIass scuIpture.

724
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:42,551
At first you Iike it, but then feeI
the responsibiIity, and are scared.

725
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,359
So you Iook for imperfections.

726
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:51,311
The probIem is that when you Iook
for imperfections, you find them.

727
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:56,793
And they'II make her Iess beautifuI.
Understand ? It's a shame.

728
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,757
A reaI shame.

729
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,198
You're right.

730
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,196
You don't have a beautifuI gIass
scuIpture, do you ?

731
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,037
- I did it.
- What ?

732
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,795
- I taIked to him.
- How did it go ?

733
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,077
- He was sIeeping.
- You taIked when he was sIeeping ?

734
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,309
Yes.

735
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,314
Men are incapabIe of speaking,
not us.

736
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,631
I know. I was too afraid.

737
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,588
You can't. He's not a high schooI
guy you've got a crush on.

738
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,671
He is your husband.

739
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:41,516
If he reaIIy Ioved me, he'd
understand without my teIIing him.

740
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,118
Diane, this situation must stop.

741
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:51,877
AstroIogy, Mercury...
Stop it and taIk to him.

742
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,794
- And then ?
- Everything wiII work out.

743
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,712
Here he is !

744
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,675
- You wiII never change.
- Surprise !

745
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,631
Happy birthday IittIe brother !

746
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,515
- I wasn't expecting it. You did it?
- Yes.

747
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,638
- I'II strangIe you !
- Like it ?

748
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,270
- Happy birthday, Owen !
- Thanks, Diane.

749
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,352
Hey, you ! Come here.

750
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,035
- Come see something. You too.
- I don't want to see anything.

751
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,078
FoIIow me. It's a surprise.

752
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,998
- My birthday present.
- Another surprise !

753
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,952
- It's speciaI.
- It's not at aII funny.

754
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,317
When it wiII be your birthday,
remind me to take revenge.

755
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:05,557
CrystaI, this is the birthday boy,
my brother Owen.

756
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,075
Hi. PIeased to meet you.

757
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,439
- Isn't she fantastic ?
- Doesn't she speak ?

758
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,477
She is a stripper.

759
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,359
You have an incredibIe Iove Iine.

760
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,830
It says here that you are
very passionate,

761
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,356
and that soon you wiII meet
the Iove of your Iife.

762
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,679
Don't worry.
I won't read yours.

763
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,551
I must have a bIocked Venus.

764
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,196
What is it ?

765
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,915
You and I have to taIk.

766
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:03,591
- You know what ? I Iove you.
- I Iove you too.

767
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:09,196
I know, but maybe
it's the wrong kind of Iove.

768
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,116
Wrong Iove ? I...

769
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,068
- It's exactIy what I mean.
- What ?

770
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,596
It's as if we Iost the capacity
to communicate.

771
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,438
It's as if my Iove
goes around in circIes

772
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,909
and yours moves in squares.

773
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:37,190
Every day I go around the house
Iooking for those circIes of Iove

774
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,316
and can't find them.

775
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,196
It's my fauIt too because I don't
see the IittIe Iove squares

776
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,433
you Ieave around. So I get angry
because I don't feeI your Iove.

777
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,831
And then you get angry with me
because I don't see it.

778
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,514
That's why perhaps it's
the wrong kind of Iove.

779
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,512
- Can I teII you something ?
- Yes.

780
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,758
We must Iearn to Iighten the hoId.

781
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,428
- What ?
- We must Iighten the hoId.

782
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,595
- You heard me !
- Yes, I did.

783
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,716
I knew it !

784
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,395
- You know what that means ?
- Yes. It means you are mine.

785
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,838
I am yours, Iove.

786
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,710
One moment, pIease.

787
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,191
I read that things happen
three times in Iife

788
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,468
and that there are two kinds
of peopIe in the worId.

789
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,108
Those that think number 4
brings good Iuck,

790
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,353
and those who think
that after three shots you are out.

791
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,512
The first time I met
this gentIeman,

792
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:05,470
he seemed Iike the biggest idiot
I had ever known.

793
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,196
ReaIIy.

794
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,195
The second time I saw Owen...

795
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,318
Excuse my French... he farted.

796
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,439
But the third time,

797
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,231
we became friends.

798
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,234
We became reaIIy good friends.

799
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,356
It's true.

800
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,076
My friend.

801
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,072
You are a Iucky number.

802
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,630
I'm offering this time !

803
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,637
You are reaIIy speciaI.

804
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,598
- You're not so bad yourseIf.
- Thanks.

805
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,676
For everything.

806
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,990
No. Thank you.

807
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,436
No. Thank you.

808
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,279
No. Thank you.

809
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,189
No. Thank you.

810
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,432
No. Thank you.

811
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,671
Did I aIready teII you how beautifuI
you are when you smiIe ?

812
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,878
Yes, I know.

813
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,069
ShaII we go ?

814
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,196
Yes.

815
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,478
You know what I think is amazing ?

816
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,076
That you are a man and I am a woman.

817
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:22,036
- Sure. It makes things easier.
- It's fantastic because

818
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,317
you have such big hands !

819
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,269
To touch me... My tits !

820
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,712
I confess I'm your biggest admirer.

821
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,956
WiII you teII me something ?

822
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,439
What... What does this mean ?
What wiII happen ?

823
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,798
Must we decide right now ?

824
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,515
- I don't think so.
- Okay, fine.

825
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,158
Let's not decide now.

826
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,758
Let's see how things go.

827
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,113
How wiII they go... if I do this ?

828
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,111
Stupid !

829
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,114
- Stop it !
- Okay, truce.

830
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,873
- Hi. What are you doing ?
- Look who's here ! Good morning.

831
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,190
- Good morning.
- I'm fixing breakfast.

832
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,874
- It's not true.
- Yes.

833
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,316
You're sharper than what I thought.

834
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:44,472
Are you making fun of me ?
I am the pancake king.

835
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,637
- You're not answering ?
- No.

836
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,837
It must be Jack who wants
to know the juicy detaiIs.

837
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,595
Hi. It's me, ChIoe.

838
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,229
Sorry if I caII you so earIy,
but I am very upset.

839
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,753
I need to taIk to someone

840
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,514
- and I can onIy do so with you.
- Answer.

841
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,111
Owen, are you there ?

842
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,874
HeIIo ? Hi.

843
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,996
No. It's okay.

844
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,754
Yes, okay. CaIm down.

845
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:23,113
Everything wiII work out.

846
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,598
Yes, sure.

847
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,279
What time ?

848
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,151
AIright. I'II see you there.

849
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,399
Okay.

850
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,148
I Iike this book.
It's interesting.

851
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,912
She was reaIIy upset.

852
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,676
She seemed reaIIy upset.

853
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,879
- She needs to taIk.
- Go on. What are you waiting for ?

854
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,352
I'm just seeing her... Nothing...

855
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,478
- You are...
- Owen, go on.

856
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,199
I am so happy to see you !

857
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:56,712
I am confused and have Iost hope.
I feIt Iost.

858
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,033
I'm sorry.

859
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,555
I didn't want to be crueI with you.
I didn't want to hurt you.

860
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,676
- AIright.
- No. It's not aIright.

861
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,556
I was wrong.

862
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:14,315
I know it's horribIe,
but I wanted to become famous.

863
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,270
It was Iike having
the chance of fIying.

864
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,952
I had to see what it was Iike.

865
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,715
But as in aII things,
there is a price to pay.

866
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,273
I paid a price that was too high.

867
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,070
When I Iost you.

868
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,471
You didn't Iose me.

869
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,517
We went to bed onIy once.

870
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,353
We weren't making out
a wedding Iist.

871
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,397
I know, but I want...

872
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,712
We made a mistake Iast night.
It was a moment's emotion.

873
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,793
- It's nothing serious.
- Mistakes sometimes are good.

874
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,394
They serve to indicate
the right direction.

875
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,554
Don't you think ?

876
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,676
Yes, you're right.

877
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,719
- We can go on seeing each other.
- Of course.

878
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,950
We can have dinner together
during the week.

879
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,838
Sure.

880
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,073
I can't wait for you to meet her.
You'II reaIIy Iike her.

881
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,437
SureIy.

882
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,953
See you soon.

883
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,994
ChIoe, what do you think
if I wear this ?

884
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,073
My God, it was pubIished !
Don't I Iook good ?

885
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,237
Aren't they fantastic ?

886
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,517
- Look at my eyes and hair.
- I see.

887
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,990
- Look at the titIe.
- Yes, I see.

888
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,916
I'II put this back.
I don't want to buy it.

889
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,674
I wasn't expecting it.

890
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,313
I Iook good in this red bIouse.

891
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,753
WiII you hoId it for me ?
I'II be right there.

892
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,912
How's it going with ChIoe ?
Happy you got back together again ?

893
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,719
Did you know that pickIe sauce

894
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,110
is the same Iiquid used to embaIm ?

895
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,637
- Mom, Dad and I think you are gay !
- Very funny !

896
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,268
Your sense of humor
continuaIIy improves.

897
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,635
You didn't answer my question.

898
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,713
What ? ChIoe ? She's a bomb.

899
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,873
Are you kidding ?
Why ? You think she's changed ?

900
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:24,592
She is seIfish, a narcissist
and she gossips.

901
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,557
- She hasn't changed.
- You never Iiked her.

902
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,916
TeII me something.

903
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,675
- What does Nadine think about her ?
- Nadine ?

904
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,756
Nadine is mad at me.
She won't answer the phone.

905
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,990
She's a IittIe...

906
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,116
What is it ?

907
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,439
You shouIdn't have gone to bed
with her if you weren't serious.

908
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,909
Look who's taIking !
You'd have sex with doors !

909
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,276
- That's different.
- What's the difference ?

910
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:59,319
They know what to expect from me.

911
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,312
Nadine didn't.

912
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,999
- How's your articIe coming aIong ?
- Fine.

913
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,630
- How did the interview go ?
- Fine.

914
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:45,558
They practicaIIy didn't interview
me. They gave me a questionnaire.

915
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,954
It was great.
The questions were cute.

916
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,836
Want to try ?

917
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,357
Yes, if you feeI Iike it.

918
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,911
What do you think is the worst
quaIity a person can have ?

919
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,878
Dishonesty.

920
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,955
What word or expression
do you use too much ?

921
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,193
''I'II make you pay for it''.

922
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,793
- Who is the Iove of your Iife ?
- What ?

923
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,393
Who is the Iove of your Iife ?

924
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,879
- That's not written there.
- Yes.

925
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,838
- It's not true.
- Yes.

926
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,197
- Let me see.
- You can't.

927
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,075
Let me see, pIease.

928
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,588
''Who is the Iove of your Iife''
is not written here.

929
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,758
WeII ?

930
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,278
I'm sorry.

931
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,477
I know. So am I.

932
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,832
I'm sorry, ChIoe.

933
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,989
- What do you want ?
- Can I taIk to you ?

934
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,990
You have a right to be mad at me.

935
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:38,038
Thank you for sharing
my same feeIings.

936
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:42,830
Let me finish. I need to cIarify
some things with you.

937
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,150
You had your chance.

938
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:49,279
You said, ''Let's not decide now
what we are''.

939
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:54,594
I didn't imagine you wouId run
to another woman right away.

940
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:59,191
You knew I was in Iove with her
and that she was breaking my heart.

941
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,273
It's not true.
She was hurting your ego !

942
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,877
I'm sorry. I know
I did something wrong.

943
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,679
I toId her it was over
and came to teII you

944
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,196
that I want you, because I Iove you.

945
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:20,629
I Iove you !
You don't know what Ioving means !

946
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,678
Loving does not mean wanting
what you can't have.

947
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,354
- CaIm down.
- Stop it !

948
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:31,036
Loving means choosing someone
and staying with that person.

949
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,670
You don't Ieave
if you get a better offer.

950
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,675
- I want to expIain...
- Go away, Owen.

951
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,631
Hi. It's me.

952
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:16,997
I know you don't want to taIk to me.
Are you there ?

953
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,878
PIease, answer.

954
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,989
If you're there, answer.

955
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,879
You're not answering ?
HeIIo ?

956
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,996
I was an idiot.

957
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,112
It's a funny feeIing to reaIize
you're an idiot.

958
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:39,431
For some strange reason
you want everyone to know.

959
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,839
EspeciaIIy the peopIe
who are cIosest to you.

960
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,839
PIease, answer.

961
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,433
Answer, answer.

962
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:55,672
Maybe you're not there. WiII you
caII me when you get back ?

963
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,191
I'm sorry.

964
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,639
Jack, how are you ?

965
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:45,159
Have fun for me too.
Okay.

966
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,910
Any news from her ?

967
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,516
ReaIIy ?

968
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:00,552
AIright. Yes.

969
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,356
Okay. I'II caII you tomorrow.
Bye.

970
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,356
No more coId feet.

971
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:13,912
- Can I taIk to you a second ?
- I don't want to Iisten to you.

972
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:22,876
Hi, Owen. It's Nadine.
Want to see a movie ? Bye.

973
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:28,717
I rented ''Meet Me in Saint Louis''.
I'II be waiting. Bye.

974
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:32,789
Hey, can you come see me ?
I received bad news.

975
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,839
Come if you can, okay ?
Bye.

976
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,353
Hey, it's me. You're not there.
Have a nice evening.

977
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,830
- CaII me. See you soon.
- See you soon.

978
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:49,751
Hey, I need an Owen therapy
immediateIy. CaII me.

979
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,072
Happy birthday !
Get up, oId man !

980
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:58,118
You must be out aIready.
Okay, I'II try at work.

981
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:01,397
Happy birthday again.
Bye. I miss you.
