1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,193
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,012
(gentle music)

3
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,671
(gentle jazz music)

4
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:00,202
(people chattering)

5
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:02,785
(bright music)

6
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:15,757
(elevator chimes)

7
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:41,987
(telephones ringing in offices)

8
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,113
- You need a vacation.

9
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,653
Vacations work wonders.

10
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:51,908
(laughs)

11
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:54,030
- What are you doing here?

12
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,990
- I thought I'd pick up
my messages and my mail.

13
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,780
I wanna hit the ground
running in the morning.

14
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,227
Open it.

15
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:01,043
(laughs)

16
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:02,530
You know that weird thing
where you just wanna check

17
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,410
to be sure if you still have a job.

18
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,663
- You still have a job, Mary Beth,

19
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:08,833
but not until tomorrow.

20
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,030
Pot holders.

21
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,063
Oh, thank you.

22
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,801
Oh, gosh.

23
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,260
(laughs)

24
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,500
Why don't I take you
to Pergots for dinner?

25
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,000
- Christine, I can't eat
another restaurant meal.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,833
There's more.

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,240
Now Harvey discovered this Amish buffet

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,990
right next to the motel.

29
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,260
All all you can eat for $12.99.

30
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,310
- Well, so don't eat.

31
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,290
You can tell me all about
exotic eastern Pennsylvania.

32
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,157
I'm in the mood to listen.

33
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:45,240
(clanking)

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,830
- I'll capitalize it for you.

35
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,580
Alice does not do great in the car.

36
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,320
Come over, have supper with us.

37
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,033
- Nah.

38
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,693
Nah, nothing comfortable domestic tonight.

39
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,543
- What?

40
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,562
- Oh, it's--
- What?

41
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,840
- (stammers) It's stupid.

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,253
It's really stupid.

43
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,810
I had a bank CD that matured today,

44
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,120
and it was the last one
that we held jointly,

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,713
you know, married jointly.

46
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,840
I told it was stupid.

47
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,590
- No, hey.

48
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,695
It's the little stuff
that always clabbers you.

49
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,070
- (laughs) Yeah.

50
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,520
And I know it's for the best.

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,621
Besides the damn thing
didn't even make 4%.

52
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,989
(laughs)

53
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:34,822
- Oh.

54
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,939
Oh, thanks.

55
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:41,189
(jangling)

56
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:46,185
(couple whispering softly)

57
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:51,575
- How are you?
- (giggling) Good.

58
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:54,242
(horns honking)

59
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,593
- Hi, John.

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,390
Love is the air.

61
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,330
- Are they still at it out to there?

62
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,540
- Better out there than upstairs.

63
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,180
I share a wall with that girl.

64
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,345
Her taste in mood music is Tom Waits.

65
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:10,160
- You don't it to Tom Waits.

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,740
You do it to Whitney or Anita Baker.

67
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,050
- You know, John, I'm
sure there was a time

68
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,610
when tenants knew absolutely nothing

69
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,550
about their doorman's love life.

70
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,911
Besides, everybody does
it to Johnny Mathis.

71
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,647
- You're the boss Miss Cagney.

72
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,004
(gun firing)
(woman screams)

73
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:24,837
- Get down!

74
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:29,053
(suspenseful music)
(people clamoring)

75
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:30,507
- My god, he's shot!

76
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:33,814
- Call 911 somebody's been shot!

77
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:36,731
(people clamoring)

78
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:38,671
Hey!

79
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:40,720
- The guy running with the haircut.

80
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,438
(suspenseful music)

81
00:04:44,438 --> 00:04:45,393
(tires screeching)

82
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:47,328
(horn honking)

83
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,661
- Police get out of the way!

84
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:53,705
Joe, stop that guy!

85
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:55,569
Get out of the way!

86
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:56,402
Lady!

87
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:00,287
- I saw him, he was flying.

88
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,620
- Where?
- There.

89
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:23,265
Dammit!

90
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,320
- Jesus please.

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,153
Thank you.

92
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:30,280
- You got him.

93
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,610
- This is a witness.

94
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,760
John, this is Tran.

95
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,900
Would you take him inside please.

96
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,117
- Oh, boy.
- Thank you.

97
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,400
Now go on right inside.
- Come on.

98
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,586
- Thank you very much.

99
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,181
(dramatic music)

100
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,764
(horn honking)

101
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:45,240
Come on let's go.
- I'm all right.

102
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,700
I'm okay.
- I know you are.

103
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,660
- Get him up.

104
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,030
I told John to get him up.

105
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,750
- I can't do that.

106
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,480
- He can't breathe like that.

107
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,353
Sit him up.

108
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,780
- Get a look at who do it?

109
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,220
- Some.

110
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,140
Possible gang bang.

111
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,810
- In this neighborhood.

112
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,640
- Bastards, Gabriel isn't in a gang.

113
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,786
Help him!

114
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:04,660
- Honey, listen to me.

115
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,663
We can't move him, all right.

116
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:08,547
We can't move him.

117
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:09,870
It'll just make things worse.

118
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,173
Now the ambulance will be here any minute.

119
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,479
- Oh, god.
- Shh, shh.

120
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,389
(sobbing)

121
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,222
Sorry.

122
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:20,866
(sobbing deeply)

123
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:23,520
Come on, we'll wait for
the ambulance together,

124
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,943
and you tell me about Gabriel.

125
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:27,410
Tell me about Gabriel.

126
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,693
- He's a med student.

127
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,814
He's got exams so we
called it an early night.

128
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:34,870
(emergency sirens blaring)

129
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,613
I just met him last month.

130
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:38,752
- It's okay, shh, shh.

131
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:39,585
All right.

132
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:41,136
(chimes)

133
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:42,450
(people chatting)

134
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,768
- I don't see anything on her chart.

135
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:46,180
We're looking good for now.

136
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,340
But I don't think we
have anything important.

137
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,173
- Who's telling you?

138
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:51,150
I'm telling you.

139
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,090
- She isn't a minor, sir.

140
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,313
You don't have standing.

141
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:55,777
- Lee.

142
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,990
Detective Moyer.

143
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,600
- Hi, Lieutenant.

144
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,220
- I was hoping to see Darcy.

145
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,053
- So was I.

146
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:03,792
This is her father.

147
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:04,625
(sighs)

148
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,310
- [Christine] Mr. Wylie, how is she?

149
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,410
- She was almost killed last night.

150
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,800
She's traumatized.

151
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,670
- I spoke with the doctor.

152
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,510
She was in shock.

153
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,800
But now she's stable and alert.

154
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,150
I'm about to interview her.

155
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,550
- Mr. Wylie, could I buy you some coffee.

156
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,160
You must have been up all night.

157
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
- From Connecticut.

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,590
- Are you with the police?

159
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,620
- Yes.

160
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,560
But, I'm really a neighbor of Darcy's.

161
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,393
That's the reason I'm here.

162
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:28,700
- Is this your case?

163
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,533
- No.

164
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,510
- Then stay out of it.

165
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,300
- Why don't we both stay
out of it, Mr. Wylie,

166
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,480
and let Detective Moyer do his job?

167
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,380
- I won't be long.

168
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,990
(sighs)

169
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,060
- It'll be okay.

170
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,160
- You don't know that.

171
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,150
Don't talk about things you don't know.

172
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,840
- Where were you?

173
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,310
I saw about the shooting on the news.

174
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,400
I tried to call, and I
get nothing but machine!

175
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,460
- I dropped by the hospital--

176
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,130
- Well, you couldn't return a message.

177
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,659
Right there in front of your own building.

178
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:07,492
- I'm fine.

179
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:09,950
With that much luck I
could've nailed the bastard.

180
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,310
Mary Beth, we're late let's go.

181
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,040
- They got any kind of leads?

182
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,160
- Well, I saw him ditch the weapon.

183
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,993
So they've got that,

184
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:17,870
plus a half good physical description.

185
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,193
Plus, a perfect impression
of the sole of his left shoe.

186
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,950
- Where was that?

187
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,133
- In some excrement.

188
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,760
- Excrement?

189
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,180
Dog excrement?

190
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,133
- God, I hope so.

191
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:32,478
(reports clamoring)

192
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,728
- There's Mr. Kaplovitz there.

193
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:35,846
(reporters clamoring)

194
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,670
- Well, we're not getting
specific with our strategy.

195
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,050
Let it play out in the courtroom.

196
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,742
- [Reporter] Isn't that
really taking a risk?

197
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:42,940
- That's our to case.

198
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,290
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

199
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,980
The guy is Jan Kaplovitz.

200
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,280
He's the defendant's new attorney.

201
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,510
I don't know who the woman is.

202
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,840
- I'm Raymond's aunt.

203
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,700
I've known him since before he was born.

204
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,023
- See, she's Raymond's aunt.

205
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:55,977
Raymond Bolzer's the accused.
- The City of New York

206
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:57,520
and the District Attorney's office

207
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,380
have got to look tough now

208
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,903
because that's the way the wind's blowing.

209
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:06,070
And they gotta find someone
to execute that isn't rich,

210
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,510
that isn't a black,

211
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,930
or His-Spanish or any color than white,

212
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,710
and you know that's true.

213
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,980
- Thank you, gentlemen,
ladies, we're running late.

214
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,100
- [Reporter] Do you have an
opinion about Judge Brice?

215
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,933
- [Jan] I'm pleased.

216
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,501
- Still drawing a crowd,
eh, Mr. Kaplovitz?

217
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,060
- We don't have your resources

218
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,973
in the District Attorney's office.

219
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,330
We have to do what we can.

220
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,171
- Oh, well, that explains
the white trash defense then.

221
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,121
- Trash, trash, you're the trash.

222
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:31,921
- Don't stoop to their level, Grace.

223
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,367
- Nobody's gonna call me trash.

224
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,740
(reporters clamoring)

225
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,720
- I got a nine-year-old
controls her mouth better.

226
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,550
- Well, it's her first
chance in the spotlight.

227
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,300
- I'm talking about you, Christine.

228
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,030
- No, they cropped it wrong.

229
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,160
This is wrong.

230
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,767
- [Mary Beth] Good morning.

231
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,064
- Ah, come in, ladies.

232
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:55,240
- Good morning, sir.

233
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,950
- This is my first look at the visuals.

234
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,230
You've gotta excuse the distractions.

235
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,470
Here just go on to the next one, Tam.

236
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,590
I think they're out of sequence.

237
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,400
Has Cagney offered our standard apology

238
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,000
for pulling you off whatever
you were working on?

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,750
- Yes, sir, she's been very gracious.

240
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,583
- Mm-hmm, of course, it's not every day

241
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,240
you get to work on the
first capital murder case

242
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,600
to be tried in this city in a generation.

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,829
- Nothing like the death
penalty to open up the coffers.

244
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:16,980
- Wrong, wrong.

245
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,986
We wanna see the head from
the perspective of the thing.

246
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:20,990
- What thing?
- The thing,

247
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,183
the passenger side.

248
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,460
- [Mary Beth] I remember this.

249
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,080
Those delivery guys that got robbed.

250
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,960
- [Christine] Mm-hmm.

251
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,440
- Harvey's cousins in the dairy business

252
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,800
were scared out of their heads.

253
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,320
All those delivery guys carry cash.

254
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,130
- This was Lester Purchase, age 57,

255
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,080
shot in the head while delivering produce.

256
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,620
- [Mary Beth] This was Mike Foy's case.

257
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,120
- Still is, I think, that's
what we're doing here.

258
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,700
Old Kaplovitz was outside just
now with the defendant's aunt

259
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,950
beating the reverse
racism drum pretty loud.

260
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,080
- Right, that's the kind of argument

261
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,770
that flies everywhere but in a courtroom.

262
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,729
It's specious, specious.

263
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:54,210
- How do you like the People's case, sir?

264
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,743
- Is this right, huh?

265
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,020
Alright, no, that's fine.

266
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,190
Just keep going, Tamala.

267
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,037
The case, no, I feel good, I feel good.

268
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:02,860
It's a good case.

269
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,640
We got two witnesses who
can put him at the scene.

270
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,690
He's got the, "I was
asleep in bed", alibi.

271
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,190
Plus, we've got physical
evidence and trace amounts,

272
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,700
so I feel good, I feel good.

273
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,900
Of course, you don't wanna go into

274
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,590
a trial feeling to confident,

275
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,200
particularly in the
first capital murder case

276
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,863
to be tried in this city in a generation.

277
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:22,486
(gentle music)

278
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:26,938
(machine whirring)

279
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,873
- Oh, boy.

280
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,550
He was shot on his wife's birthday.

281
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,390
- Mm, when Mike Foy went
over to give her the news,

282
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,270
she ran out into the
street in front of a car.

283
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,558
- Oh, no.

284
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:42,640
- [Christine] A real opera, huh?

285
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,010
- Was she killed?

286
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,510
- No, she wanted to die.

287
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,347
But she's still here.

288
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:47,543
The car didn't hit her.

289
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,809
Anyway.

290
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:51,840
(people chattering)

291
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,560
Our job is to troubleshoot

292
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,620
Kaplovitz's witness
list into chicken soup.

293
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,510
Our own Trayne if nervous.

294
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,860
We also have another very unofficial job,

295
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,284
which I was gonna tell you about before.

296
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:05,070
(telephone ringing)

297
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,903
Cagney.

298
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:09,040
He is.

299
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,579
Thanks, Bill.

300
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,710
(phone resolver slams)

301
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,020
Anyway, I think Doug
Trayne wants as many bodies

302
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,707
put between him and
Detective Foy as he can.

303
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,940
- Mike Foy?

304
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,860
What's not to like about Mike Foy?

305
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,510
- Well, he's in the
building coming to see us.

306
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,653
You can be reminded.

307
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,190
Attaboy, Mike.

308
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,780
Don't bother knocking.

309
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,613
- Look who's here?

310
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:30,979
- As I live and breathe.

311
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:32,550
- (laughs) It's been a dog's age.

312
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,150
- [Mary Beth] You're
a sight for sore eyes.

313
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,560
- So you gonna help us
fry this little bastard.

314
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,620
- Nobody fries anything
anymore, Detective.

315
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,883
It's lethal injection.

316
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,383
- How's Maureen?

317
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:46,960
- Oh, good, good, she's
doing the craft show circuit.

318
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,290
- Kids all grown up?

319
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,200
- Sure, half to year I come
home to an empty house.

320
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,880
- So, Mike, what do you
know about Bolzer's aunt.

321
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,550
Her name is Grace Pound.

322
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,340
Lacey's been going
through the murder book.

323
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,950
- We're working on it.

324
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,010
- Oh.

325
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,713
- Till today we didn't know
how close she was to the kid.

326
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:06,535
You look great, Mary Beth.

327
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,630
(laughs)

328
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,690
- You always did know when to
lay down a compliment, thanks.

329
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:15,726
(gentle music)

330
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,026
- [Christine] Hi, John.

331
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:23,743
- Hi, Miss Cagney.

332
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:26,194
- Thanks.
- What a world, huh?

333
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,190
- I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate

334
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,670
your cool head last night, thank you.

335
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,550
- She's back, you know.

336
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,383
- Darcy?

337
00:13:33,383 --> 00:13:36,230
- Yeah, her folks brought
her here this afternoon,

338
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,690
and they weren't gone 10 minutes

339
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,813
when she had one of her weirdo visitors.

340
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,820
- Well, if she feels like company,

341
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,730
that's not a bad thing.

342
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,800
- He was here and gone like that.

343
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,633
- Thanks.

344
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:51,314
(gentle dramatic music)

345
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:55,549
Hey, John.

346
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,956
Did you get a look at her parents?

347
00:13:57,956 --> 00:13:59,731
- (scoffs) A look was about it.

348
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:01,660
Coming and going not one word,

349
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,664
not even to each other.

350
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:04,713
- You got off lucky.

351
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,858
(heavy sighing)

352
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,413
- So?

353
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,593
- Mm.

354
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,692
- Tell me about it.

355
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:28,775
(laughs)

356
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:33,110
(heavy sighing)

357
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,810
What homicide are you and
all these people working on?

358
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:43,007
(sighs)

359
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,413
- It's People v. Bolzer.

360
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,023
- I saw the news.

361
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,953
I know what it is.

362
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Well, that explains you and
Chris working full time on this.

363
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:04,360
It's always gonna be money
when the politics are right.

364
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,100
- I have absolutely no qualm whatsoever

365
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,843
about working on a capital case.

366
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:16,222
You wanna talk about this.

367
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:17,372
We could talk about it.

368
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,660
- Honey, we don't have to talk about it

369
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,333
if you don't have qualms.

370
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,853
- I don't.

371
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,390
- Then better you than me.

372
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:47,062
(smoke alarm wails)

373
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:54,976
(dramatic music)

374
00:15:57,631 --> 00:15:58,714
- Oh, my god.

375
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:07,560
(lock rattling)
(smoke alarm blaring)

376
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,072
- My board downstairs says Nine G.

377
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:12,739
(ominous music)

378
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:16,606
- Open up please!

379
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:17,439
Darcy!

380
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,440
Open up!

381
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,273
You smell smoke?

382
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:22,210
Get everyone off the floor.

383
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,420
Call the fire department.

384
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,400
Darcy.

385
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,360
Yes, fine.

386
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,193
Darcy!

387
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,080
- I've already called it in.

388
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,226
Wait here, John.

389
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:29,059
(ominous music)

390
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,226
- Darcy Wylie!

391
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:35,530
- [John] Here.

392
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:38,880
- John, when I tell you

393
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,420
kick the door right down here, all right.

394
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,573
You ready?

395
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:44,177
Now!

396
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:45,010
Again!

397
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:47,891
(dramatic music)

398
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:48,724
Darcy!

399
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:51,908
Anybody home?

400
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:55,075
(smoke alarm blaring)

401
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,458
Darcy!

402
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:03,668
Darcy.

403
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:06,021
Darcy.

404
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,031
- What is it?

405
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,516
- Oh, don't come in.

406
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:10,717
Call an ambulance please.

407
00:17:10,717 --> 00:17:13,259
- What, what'd you find?
- Just do it, John.

408
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:16,009
(dramatic music)

409
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:24,520
Oh, Darcy.

410
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:28,349
(somber music)

411
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:42,604
(horn honking)

412
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,750
You're gonna have to
navigate this morning, okay?

413
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,440
I haven't a clue where I'm going.

414
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,453
- Well, fine.

415
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,280
But, I thought you knew this witness.

416
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,150
- I'm going to see him at his work.

417
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,990
It's a new address to me.

418
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,943
- Well, you're fine.

419
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,860
We're not even to Croft.

420
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,693
We're fine.

421
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,080
- Toxicology's in on my neighbor.

422
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,490
- [Mary Beth] Yeah.

423
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,640
- Heroin overdose.

424
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,473
- No.

425
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,340
- I should have read her as a junky.

426
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,383
- So accidental OD.

427
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,113
- Inconclusive.

428
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,860
I hate to think that she killed herself.

429
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,690
- Well, maybe it wasn't really suicide.

430
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,070
You know, junkies,

431
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,790
how do they know how pure the
stuff they're shooting is.

432
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,113
- Well, it was pure enough to up her nose.

433
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,040
- Well, that's handier snorting smack.

434
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,640
Now in the old days before AIDS,

435
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,760
you had to slam that poison in your veins.

436
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,610
You needed all the annoying paraphernalia.

437
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,780
Now be safe.

438
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,990
Snort it right up.

439
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,180
No mess, no track marks,

440
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,770
no fear of infection.

441
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,620
Just burn your brains and die.

442
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,030
- Her parents had her right
there in the hospital.

443
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,240
They had a shot of helping her.

444
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,903
You know, straightening her out.

445
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,973
(scoffing) No, not their darling daughter.

446
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,320
- Hot bed for a kid is heartbreaking.

447
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,630
- And, poor John, you know.

448
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,950
Good bless him John my doorman
he calls about the funeral.

449
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,787
He's gonna take a sick day and go.

450
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:12,086
"No service," he was told.

451
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:14,123
- Well, maybe some kind
of religious thing.

452
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,900
I mean, regardless what
kind of people they are,

453
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,383
Christine, still it's pretty
much of a rotten shame.

454
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:24,240
- God, you know, if I'd made some effort.

455
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,610
- Oh, come on Christine.
- Well, I don't mean

456
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,480
I could've made a big
change, but something.

457
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,090
- Oh, wait.

458
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,380
That was Prospect.

459
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,213
I'm sorry.

460
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:35,459
(sighing)

461
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,640
- I should be talking to the defense.

462
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,853
- [Christine] They're entitled.

463
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,350
- One of the lawyers rolled him downtown

464
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,970
in the Benz bought him lunch.

465
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,520
Then Kaplovitz sat with
him for an hour and a half.

466
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,070
Hey, Ronny!

467
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,366
Ron.

468
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:51,199
The DA is here.

469
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:55,890
You guys should've told him
this was a death penalty deal.

470
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,723
- [Christine] Well, it's not a secret.

471
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:59,330
- Well, I'm just telling
you he didn't know.

472
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,490
Kaplovitz must have laid it on pretty.

473
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,050
- Hey, Ron.

474
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,040
How's it going.

475
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,690
- Hey, how's it going?

476
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,523
- Good, good.

477
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,250
This is investigator Lacey, Mary Beth.

478
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,250
- Hi, Ron.

479
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,440
- Hi.

480
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,010
- Just wanted to keep in touch.

481
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,420
Let you know how the Bolzer case is going.

482
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,290
There's been another
delay surprise, surprise.

483
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,200
But, I think, we can
expect opening arguments

484
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,050
before the end of the month,

485
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,550
and then your testimony should come

486
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,053
one or two days after that, okay?

487
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,643
You're gonna do great I know it.

488
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,710
- They're gonna bring up my priors.

489
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,400
- [Christine] Only if the judge allows it.

490
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,480
- Everybody's gonna hear about

491
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,410
something that happened
to me when I was a kid.

492
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,390
- No, not necessarily.

493
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,230
The judge is gonna decide
if it's even relevant.

494
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,930
Besides the jury will hear
that you're working now.

495
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,000
You're going to school.

496
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,300
It'll all even itself out.

497
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,820
- My church don't believe in executions.

498
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,920
- What church is that?

499
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,433
- If you kill her, that's wrong.

500
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,683
If I kill you, that's wrong.

501
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,740
But if the State of
New York kills someone,

502
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,373
I'm wrong if I don't help them.

503
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:10,695
I mean, what kind of sense is that?

504
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,010
- [Doug] Did you bother
to point out to him

505
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,750
his obligation to testify.

506
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,520
- Well, I didn't wanna lean on him.

507
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,340
- Alright, I'm not gonna micro
manage how you handle him

508
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,170
as long as we're clear about the mission.

509
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,150
Ron Tally has to get on the stand,

510
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,190
put his hand on the Bible,

511
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,520
and identify Raymond Bolzer

512
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,640
as the person he saw
running from the scene.

513
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,900
Alright, I'll see you in court.

514
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,733
- Right.

515
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,630
- I shouldn't have challenged
the guy on his religion.

516
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,560
You never call somebody
on what they believe.

517
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,530
- What are you talking about?

518
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,837
- I said, "What church is that?"

519
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:44,800
You know, put him off.

520
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,550
- You didn't say, "What church is that!"

521
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,683
You did it fine.

522
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,390
This is just a nervous kind of case.

523
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,070
You're picking up on it.

524
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,630
Now we're gonna go see Mrs. Seguin

525
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,350
our darling prize witness,

526
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,113
and we'll both feel a lot better.

527
00:21:58,689 --> 00:21:59,777
(soft knocking on door)

528
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,495
Mrs. Seguin.

529
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:03,712
(soft knocking on door)

530
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:04,712
Mrs. Seguin.

531
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,194
Mrs. Seguin.

532
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:13,190
Mrs. Seguin.

533
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,063
Hi, there, Mr. Seguin!

534
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,053
I remembered to bring me
empty fruit juice can.

535
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,840
I was just telling Mary.

536
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,790
This is my colleague Mary Beth.

537
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,730
- How do you do?

538
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,950
Don't get up, sir.

539
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,500
- I was just telling Mary Beth
you should see all the things

540
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,480
that Mr. Seguin can do with an empty

541
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,950
32-ounce fruit juice can.

542
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,070
Why he grows tomatoes
out on the fire escape.

543
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,380
And, he can keep roaches
out of his cat food.

544
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,870
Well, all kinds of things.

545
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,410
I can't remember them all.

546
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,030
- Oh, lots of things.

547
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,380
I'm glad you come.

548
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,000
- Well, actually, we
came to see Mrs. Seguin.

549
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,140
But you know you're my guy.

550
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,563
Is she in the store?

551
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,090
- She's got the flu.

552
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,080
- I'm so sorry, sir.

553
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,963
- Do you think we might say hi?

554
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,770
- Well, she's no good,
but sure you can go in.

555
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,130
- Have any of the defense
team been here to see you?

556
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,080
- Yeah, they came.

557
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,750
I told them go to hell.

558
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,840
- Good for you.

559
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,673
May I?

560
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:20,563
- Sure.

561
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,943
You know, every time I go in
she's lying crooked in the bed.

562
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:34,039
(emergency siren blaring)

563
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,054
(police radio chatter)

564
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:37,290
- Here they come.
- Okay.

565
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,606
- A little room.
- Watch your step.

566
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:40,285
Down, easy.

567
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,285
(people chattering)

568
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,900
- [Doug] A coma.

569
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,870
- The hospital said diabetic coma.

570
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,530
- [Doug] Do people recover
from diabetic comas?

571
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,363
- We shouldn't count on it.

572
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:56,720
- [Doug] We can't even do a conditional

573
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,710
on video tape, right?

574
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,890
I mean, she's unconscious.

575
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,913
She's out.
- Right.

576
00:23:59,913 --> 00:24:01,890
It's hard to believe.

577
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,932
We just stepped on a land mine, I guess.

578
00:24:03,932 --> 00:24:06,390
- Boy, does this case need a break.

579
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,080
- Tell him we'll stay in
touch with the hospital.

580
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,380
- We'll call you back soon as we know.

581
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,213
- Do that.

582
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,830
(people chattering)

583
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,552
(phone chimes)

584
00:24:16,552 --> 00:24:19,830
- [Christine] Well we did some
real damage today, didn't we?

585
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,890
- [Mary Beth] Don't kid.

586
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,050
I stick my big toe in
this case, it heads south.

587
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,150
- [Operator] Dr. Gross to Nursing Central.

588
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,130
- I'm gonna go see if Lee
Moyer's still at his precinct.

589
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:35,963
- About your shooting?

590
00:24:35,963 --> 00:24:37,307
- Well, it's not my shooting.

591
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:39,103
But I'm gonna check in with him.

592
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,010
(gentle music)

593
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,410
- It feels like a hit to me.

594
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,380
But the victim Gabriel Ramos,

595
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,910
was exactly what Darcy Wylie said he was.

596
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,937
A med student,

597
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,980
and they met online at the movies.

598
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,313
The family's from Rhode Island.

599
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,510
Good kid.

600
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,343
Nothing.

601
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:03,330
- What about Darcy?

602
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,010
- Well, she's the more
logical target of a hit

603
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,740
with her drug history.

604
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,630
- Did you guys talk to my doorman

605
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,650
after Darcy died John O'Meara.

606
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,950
- I spoke to him myself
after the shooting.

607
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,783
- I know you did.

608
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:16,030
But after you talked to him,

609
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,120
Darcy was released from the hospital,

610
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,237
and John said she'd had a visitor.

611
00:25:20,237 --> 00:25:22,233
"Weirdo", was the word he used.

612
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,120
- Male or female?

613
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,033
- I think male,

614
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,490
and I got the impression
he'd seen him before.

615
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,250
- I'll talk to him soon.

616
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,739
Thanks.

617
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,489
(dramatic music)

618
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,970
- Hey, Mike.

619
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,000
- Mary Beth, there's
somebody I want you to meet.

620
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,830
Delores Purchase Inspector Lacey.

621
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,750
- Mrs. Purchase.

622
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,350
- I'm Lester's widow.

623
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,640
Detective Foy has been keeping me informed

624
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,780
about all the goings on.

625
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,253
- Well, it's quite a case.

626
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,770
We're doing all we can
to get a conviction.

627
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,543
- I am to.

628
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,110
- Mrs. Purchase is a very big

629
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,783
believer in the power of prayer.

630
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:07,010
- No matter how good a case is,

631
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,760
we always need every single prayer.

632
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,220
Good to meet you.

633
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:16,603
(telephones ringing in offices)

634
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:20,512
(cans rattling)

635
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:29,520
(screams)

636
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,903
- What are you doing?

637
00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:32,230
(washing machine whirring)

638
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,880
You think it's funny scaring
people in the damn dark?

639
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:38,185
(gasping)

640
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:40,680
(gentle music)

641
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,825
It's Mr. Wylie.

642
00:26:41,825 --> 00:26:43,820
It's Mr. Wylie, isn't it?

643
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,260
Hi, you're Darcy's dad.

644
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,483
- The lights were too bright.

645
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:47,316
- Yeah.

646
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,563
Those Darcy's?

647
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:54,024
- [Matthew] I'm cleaning
out her apartment.

648
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,403
- Look I've got a washer and a dryer.

649
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:02,060
Come on we'll just take these things,

650
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,000
and we can come back and get

651
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,070
the rest of the stuff
out of the machine later.

652
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,973
This really is the basement from hell.

653
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:12,604
Come on.

654
00:27:14,512 --> 00:27:16,073
(gentle music)

655
00:27:16,073 --> 00:27:18,740
(cans rattling)

656
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:30,870
(machine whirring)

657
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,023
I think it's done.

658
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,660
Some of this stuff really does melt.

659
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,430
Would you like a drink?

660
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,570
I don't keep any in the house.

661
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,560
But I'd be heady to go.

662
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,393
- I'm fine.

663
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,923
- Okay.

664
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:44,890
Then you eat.

665
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:45,903
- Oh, no, thank you.

666
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,070
- Then keep me company.

667
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:11,130
Did you tell me your first name?

668
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,863
- Matthew, Matt.

669
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,130
- I'm Christine.

670
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,370
- How do you do?
- Hi.

671
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,990
Listen, Matt, I don't
know where you're from.

672
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,823
- Connecticut.

673
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:24,688
Stonington.

674
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,470
- Well, this is New York.

675
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,053
Here in New York we
send out for everything.

676
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,180
There are people who can
do that laundry for you,

677
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,220
and we've got cleaning crews

678
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,070
who will take toothbrushes to
the ground if they have to.

679
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,820
And we have movers who will pack

680
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,483
everything up for you in acid-free tissue.

681
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,023
All you have to do is say
the word and sign the check.

682
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,083
So why don't you just get
a good night's rest, huh?

683
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,210
And tomorrow you can just call

684
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,010
and send out for anything
that you want, and be back in?

685
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:11,163
- Stonington.

686
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:14,530
- [Christine] Stonington by lunch.

687
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,730
- No, I...

688
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,683
No.

689
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,133
- I understand.

690
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,160
It's a lot to do so soon, so.

691
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,083
- It's fine.

692
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,990
- Well, let me give you a hand.

693
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,083
- Christine, right?

694
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,820
- Christine, this is not your...

695
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,393
This isn't your problem.

696
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,523
It's mine.

697
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,127
Thanks anyway.

698
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,806
(door thuds)

699
00:30:16,476 --> 00:30:19,976
(people muttering softly)

700
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,226
(sighs)

701
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:27,583
(snoring)

702
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,000
(door thuds)

703
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:35,942
- What's going on?

704
00:30:35,942 --> 00:30:38,350
- The judge doesn't
wanna wake the defendant.

705
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,390
- Kaplovitz has petitioned
for another 30 days.

706
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,490
- Do you think Brice is gonna grant it.

707
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,323
- It's my guess.

708
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,001
- Motion denied.

709
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:51,870
(gavel bangs)

710
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,053
Any other business?

711
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,243
Okay, we're done.

712
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:58,843
Court is adjourned until
Monday morning 8:30.

713
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:02,959
(people chatting)

714
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,410
- Maybe you ought to consider

715
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,453
adjusting his medication, Counselor.

716
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,000
- I always thought the
ability to sleep soundly

717
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
was proof of a clear conscience.

718
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,569
- Yeah, what do you think now?

719
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:15,652
- Lieutenant.

720
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,033
- What'd you find out?

721
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:24,730
- Grace Pound lives with her
boyfriend in Staten Island.

722
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,930
- You got an address?

723
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,960
- Wait a second, Lee, there's more.

724
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,103
These neighbors say that in the past year,

725
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:33,270
a young kid matching
Raymond Bolzer's description

726
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,020
seems to have been living at the place.

727
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,719
- Get a search warrant.

728
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,719
- Thank you.

729
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:41,181
(gentle music)

730
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:44,458
(dramatic music)

731
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:47,263
(dramatic music drowns out voices)

732
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:50,230
- My boyfriend Andrew is upstairs.

733
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,887
Andrew!

734
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:52,926
Andrew!

735
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:54,509
- Hands up, Andrew!

736
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,600
(dramatic music)

737
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:14,719
(dramatic music drowns out speech)

738
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:18,923
- I repeat why do you have to be so deaf.

739
00:32:18,923 --> 00:32:21,489
I can't believe anything you people say.

740
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:22,322
- Grace.

741
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,627
- You're clean put your hands down.

742
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:38,315
(dramatic music)

743
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:06,585
- Marijuana in the closet.

744
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:17,634
You got anything?

745
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:19,623
- Shoeboxes, this one's full of crayons.

746
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,070
- Alright, where do you want them?

747
00:33:30,953 --> 00:33:32,997
- Those go here on the bed.

748
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:34,867
- It takes me back to my Thom McAn days.

749
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:36,950
(laughs)

750
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,133
- We have another watch.

751
00:33:45,365 --> 00:33:46,198
And?

752
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:48,342
Nah.

753
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,313
We got a ring.

754
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,783
It's gold.

755
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,233
For a man.

756
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,573
- Is it faceted?

757
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,830
Does it have a lot of little
diamond shapes all over it?

758
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,263
- What else?

759
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,893
- Inscription.

760
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,480
Your husband's wedding ring.

761
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,658
- [Mrs. Purchase] Sure, it's
just a bigger version of mine.

762
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,491
You wanna see mine?

763
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:22,800
- [Mike] Yes, ma'am.

764
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,020
- What's the date of this?
- Sometimes it sticks

765
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,820
on my finger.

766
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,920
I'll get it.
- It's on the tape.

767
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,780
It was right after the homicide.

768
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,600
- [Mrs. Purchase] It hangs
up on the joint there.

769
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,010
There's see the inscription?

770
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,050
- [Mike] I can, but I can't read it.

771
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,462
- [Mrs. Purchase] It's
the date of our wedding.

772
00:34:37,462 --> 00:34:40,183
- [Mary Beth And Mrs. Purchase] 12/28/59.

773
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,090
- I should've been the one to find it.

774
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,860
- What are you so happy about, Mrs. Lacey?

775
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,060
- I think I'm off to Schnide.

776
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,615
- And you, Detective?

777
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:52,830
- I'm leaving for the day.

778
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,663
Trayne is still working.

779
00:34:53,663 --> 00:34:55,710
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodnight.

780
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
- Been good working with you, Mary Beth.

781
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,300
- You certainly have mellowed, Michael,

782
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,160
at least about me.

783
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,010
- Only about you.

784
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:08,933
- [Christine] Give my love to Harvey!

785
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,780
- Doorman was a big help.

786
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,620
- Yeah, good.

787
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,360
I'll be sure and tell him.

788
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,949
So what'd you find out?

789
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,930
- Well, it looks like the
weirdo that visited Darcy

790
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,503
after she left the hospital
was an old boyfriend.

791
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,440
- Thanks.

792
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,797
You know anything about him?

793
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:25,903
- Enough to make him our prime suspect.

794
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,120
- Really?

795
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,280
- He's a Costa Rican rich boy,

796
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,880
whose family doesn't want
him in Costa Rica anymore.

797
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,870
So he spends his time collecting art

798
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,120
and supplying to heroin to addicts

799
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,770
with money enough to have it delivered.

800
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,680
- This is going on in my
building, delivering heroin?

801
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,036
- [Lee] Doorman said he hadn't
seen him in several months.

802
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:44,014
(telephones ringing in offices)

803
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:46,000
(people chattering)

804
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
- Do you think Darcy
could've been clean then?

805
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,833
- Probably.

806
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,170
The hospital drew blood
the night of the shooting,

807
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,270
and when they analyzed it after her death,

808
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,090
proved she'd been clean.

809
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,240
This guy kept pursuing her.

810
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,660
Every week he'd send
her birds of paradise.

811
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,493
You know what they are?

812
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,403
- Yeah, it's a big tropical
flower, very dramatic.

813
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,720
- I thought they were a bird.

814
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,490
Anyway, he sent her
dozens of them at a time.

815
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,680
We tracked them down through the florist.

816
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,560
- So the theory is he's
a jealous boyfriend?

817
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,650
- That's right.

818
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,530
He didn't wanna see her with anyone else.

819
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,284
- Do you think Darcy knew
that's why Gabriel was killed.

820
00:36:22,284 --> 00:36:23,534
- [Lee] Mm-hmm.

821
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,423
- So she kills herself
because she feels responsible?

822
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,881
- That's what it looks like today.

823
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:32,104
(gentle music)

824
00:36:32,104 --> 00:36:32,937
- Kids.

825
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,616
(somber music)

826
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,720
You didn't come back for your laundry.

827
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,020
- Oh, no, I didn't, did I?

828
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,340
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

829
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,450
- I'm on the phone.

830
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,474
Would you come in?

831
00:37:00,474 --> 00:37:01,353
- No, I don't wanna bother you.

832
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:02,733
- No, no, please, please.

833
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:03,650
Come on in.

834
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:12,490
(door thuds)

835
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,580
I'm sorry, Julia.

836
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,450
Someone was at the door.

837
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,020
Now I don't know what to tell you.

838
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,623
Perhaps your teacher.

839
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,100
How's Ted.

840
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,933
Uh-huh.

841
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,480
Tell your mother that...

842
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,400
Sorry I missed her and everything is fine.

843
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,993
And I'll call tomorrow.

844
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,193
All right.

845
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:35,026
Okay.

846
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,183
Dandy, bye, bye.

847
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,250
(phone receiver clicks)

848
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,180
Want a drink?

849
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,730
- No, thanks.

850
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,400
I see you've gone native?

851
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,840
- Huh?

852
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,560
- Sending out.

853
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,613
- Oh, yeah.

854
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,120
- Looks like you've made some headway.

855
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,567
- Well, mostly I pick something up,

856
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,513
and I move it to another corner.

857
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,420
- Is the family doing okay?

858
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,423
- Hard to tell.

859
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,010
- This stuff can weigh you mad.

860
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,843
Go home.

861
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,560
- [Matthew] Oh, no.

862
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,671
- Why not?

863
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:21,504
- I can't.

864
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,880
- [Christine] No.

865
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,470
- Nope.

866
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,463
- I can't be a father right now.

867
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,053
I can't be a husband.

868
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,090
(sighing)

869
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,893
So I guess I just,

870
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,623
need a second wind.

871
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,863
Time.

872
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,283
- Yeah.

873
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,610
You should stay here and take
care of Darcy's business.

874
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,070
But I'm gonna check on you.

875
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,903
Do you mind?

876
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,153
- Not at all.

877
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,300
- If you stop seeing people,

878
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,440
I'll be forced to send out

879
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,243
for one of our New York shrinks.

880
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,780
- He won't know what hit him.

881
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,910
- [Reporter] Coming up next
on the 10 o'clock report.

882
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:24,310
Are whites unfairly treated
in the justice system?

883
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,600
The results of our exclusive poll,

884
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,130
and we'll be in studio

885
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,343
with Defense Attorney Jan Kaplovitz.

886
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:33,340
- [Reporter] And now the
news from Washington.

887
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,663
- The guy is a genius.

888
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:36,992
- What?

889
00:39:36,992 --> 00:39:39,993
- Kaplovitz he's a twisted
genius with this race thing.

890
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:46,240
You know, race is the
hidden agenda in this case,

891
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,930
and he knows it.

892
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,700
You know it as well as I do.

893
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,760
- Honey, Raymond Bolzer

894
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,170
is accused of first degree murder

895
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,100
in the commission of an armed robbery.

896
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,600
Under the new law,

897
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,020
that is a capital crime.

898
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,220
There's no race in that.

899
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,250
- You know who we have to thank for this?

900
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,390
At who's feet we can dump

901
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,440
the festering problem of race in America?

902
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,763
Richard M. Nixon.

903
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,640
- Watergate, we lost our faith
in government with Watergate.

904
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,180
- No.

905
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,890
- Vietnam, the secret bombing to Cambodia.

906
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,730
- No, though fundamentally, I agree,

907
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,110
that was an act of racism

908
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,023
as much as it was military strategy.

909
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,167
Come on, Mary Beth, think.

910
00:40:33,616 --> 00:40:34,783
Algiers?
- No.

911
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:41,224
- Helen Kage and Douglas.

912
00:40:41,224 --> 00:40:44,130
- No.
- People v. Rubiso?

913
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,993
- Racism, Honey.

914
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:47,500
- Feels weird white and gold uniforms

915
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,970
that he put on the White House guards.

916
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,970
- He ended the draft.

917
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,460
Nixon ended military conscription.

918
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,270
One at a time we thought
it was to be a great thing.

919
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,670
But let me tell you
something about the draft.

920
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,230
In an army with conscripted forces

921
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,090
everybody's got one thing
in common, Mary Beth.

922
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,460
I don't care where they're from,

923
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,290
what they look like, what race they are,

924
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,060
they all wanna get out.

925
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,410
Nixon replaced it with an
army of the poor and the black

926
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,233
to defend the interests
of the rich and the white,

927
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,120
which by the way were the
Kaplovitzs of the world are wrong.

928
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,080
The issue isn't really race.

929
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,710
The issue is poverty.

930
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,170
It always has been,

931
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,890
and it always will be.

932
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,700
You making tea or hot chocolate.

933
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,010
- I'm making whatever you like.

934
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,100
- Hot chocolate.

935
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,800
And that's my problem as far
as you're concerned Mary Beth.

936
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,950
The day a rich person is executed,

937
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,710
is the day I'm willing
to put capital punishment

938
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,430
on the table for discussion.

939
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:51,470
But until that day those
executions are only an indication

940
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,120
of the complete failure of the system.

941
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,640
- I work in that system,
Harvey, take it easy.

942
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,510
- Honey, your hands are clean
and your motives are pure.

943
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,857
But the people you're working
for are political jackals.

944
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,760
(gentle music)

945
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,380
- I think we've talked enough about this.

946
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,257
- I'm telling the truth,
Mary Beth, and you know it.

947
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:20,541
(dramatic music)

948
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:23,989
(doorbell ringing)

949
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:26,656
(clock ticking)

950
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:33,330
(doorbell ringing)

951
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,510
- I'm sorry about--
- What's the matter?

952
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,750
- I slipped, clonked my head.

953
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,680
I think it's still bleeding.

954
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,223
- Well, come in, come in.

955
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,373
Let me see.

956
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,613
Yes, it's bleeding.

957
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:08,698
Of course, it's bleeding come on.

958
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,913
Have you been working all night?

959
00:43:15,548 --> 00:43:17,450
- I don't know, I guess.

960
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:18,750
- No wonder you're walking into walls.

961
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,943
You're not sleeping.

962
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,793
You really are a mess.

963
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,540
I know you don't wanna talk about Darcy.

964
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,453
But, could you at least
admit you are a mess?

965
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:31,490
- Sure, I'm a mess.

966
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,790
- Thank you.

967
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,440
This may sting just for a minute.

968
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:39,525
(gasping)

969
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:40,363
I know.

970
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,582
- Christine.

971
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:46,540
- What?

972
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,190
- It wasn't just the drugs, you know.

973
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,700
It was the lies.

974
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,603
Darcy lied, I'd let her.

975
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,477
My other kids lied for her.

976
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,327
Lies were everywhere.

977
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:01,133
They were all over the house.

978
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,100
We lied to each other.

979
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,373
We lied to ourselves.

980
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:07,359
- I'm sorry.

981
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:11,914
- No, no, don't please.

982
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:13,326
- No.
- No.

983
00:44:13,326 --> 00:44:15,909
(gentle music)

984
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,720
- I've made coffee.

985
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,958
- None for me, thanks.

986
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:44,100
- Okay.

987
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,660
Well, I set out three
different kinds of cereal.

988
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,920
And I've got yogurt in the fridge.

989
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,160
- No thanks, I'm fine.

990
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:00,350
- Sorry, I'm afraid I
have to go. (stammering)

991
00:45:00,676 --> 00:45:02,740
- I have a lot of things to do too.

992
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,770
- Oh, I know you do.

993
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:04,603
It's just that.

994
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,360
This time is just so screwy,

995
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,724
and I feel like I shouldn't leave you.

996
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:12,093
- I'll be fine.

997
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:13,593
- I know you will.

998
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,902
(gentle music)

999
00:45:17,902 --> 00:45:20,171
(stammering)

1000
00:45:20,171 --> 00:45:22,203
I really am late though.

1001
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:24,953
I really do have to go I'm sorry.

1002
00:45:27,665 --> 00:45:29,665
But you'll be all right.

1003
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:31,973
Anyway,

1004
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:35,467
I really do have to go.

1005
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:37,634
And, of course, this is...

1006
00:45:44,563 --> 00:45:45,396
Thank you.

1007
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:50,089
(door creaks)

1008
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:52,269
(upbeat music)

1009
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:56,000
- [Operator] You have 232 messages

1010
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,820
that have not been heard.

1011
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,970
- Hi, did you get my message?

1012
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,570
- No, we have a problem.

1013
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:03,830
- I don't need this.

1014
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,870
- I left you a message an hour ago.

1015
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,970
There was a fire on the D train.

1016
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,099
- You're kidding.

1017
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,260
- No, terrorism.

1018
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,720
No lunatic pouring gasoline on himself.

1019
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,960
Just a plain little
stinky electrical fire.

1020
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,970
Smell my hair.

1021
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,010
- I can smell it from here.

1022
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,150
- Well, what is the problem?

1023
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,870
- Attorney Kaplovitz got
on News One this morning.

1024
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,430
I got that from Sharon at the desk.

1025
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,792
I personally did not see it.

1026
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:28,395
(laughs)

1027
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:31,810
Kaplovitz goes on television
and he does his normal rant

1028
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,580
about this being a white bias case.

1029
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,710
And then, he solicits phone calls

1030
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,160
from his viewers who agree with him.

1031
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,990
But he didn't give his number.

1032
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,213
He gave the DA's,

1033
00:46:42,422 --> 00:46:44,680
and everybody's voicemail is in overload.

1034
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,180
What's yours 6544?

1035
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,130
- [Mary Beth] Yeah.

1036
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:53,763
- [Operator] You have 232
messages that have not been heard.

1037
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,900
- Seems to be the magic cut off number.

1038
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,787
I have 232 on mine.

1039
00:46:58,787 --> 00:47:00,200
(telephones ringing in offices)

1040
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,900
- Isn't that obstruction of justice?

1041
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,250
Our regular messages are in there.

1042
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,120
He should be cited.

1043
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,807
- Citing is too good for him.

1044
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,963
Here, let's get started.

1045
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,123
(machine whirring)

1046
00:47:20,123 --> 00:47:22,956
(people chatting)

1047
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,760
Go away.

1048
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,680
- It's Sharon.

1049
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,963
- You have more messages do not come in!

1050
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,010
- Your daughter's school called

1051
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,470
and said that they've been
trying your husband all morning.

1052
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,590
- Harvey's working in Jersey.

1053
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,340
What'd they say?
- It's the nurse.

1054
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,560
- Somebody brought a knife to school.

1055
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,503
The nurse called.

1056
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,345
Excuse me.
- Go, go.

1057
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:46,178
Go, go!

1058
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,403
These games.

1059
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:54,840
Kaplovitz is playing games.

1060
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,720
Her daughter could be who knows.

1061
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,010
Mary Beth is wading through
public opinion calls,

1062
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,533
and the school can't reach her.

1063
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:03,163
What is important here?

1064
00:48:03,163 --> 00:48:04,850
What the hell is important?

1065
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:05,963
Certainly not this!

1066
00:48:07,295 --> 00:48:11,295
(telephones ringing in offices)

1067
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,793
I don't even know his number!

1068
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,459
I'm going to do something that matters!

1069
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:26,876
(door slams)

1070
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:30,130
(heavy breathing)

1071
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,230
I shouldn't have left.

1072
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:38,297
(bright music)

1073
00:48:38,297 --> 00:48:39,464
- I know that.

1074
00:48:55,244 --> 00:48:57,310
(children shouting)

1075
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,620
- She's okay.

1076
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,803
She's okay, sweetheart.

1077
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,180
She just cut her hand a little bit.

1078
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,750
She's waiting out on the playground.

1079
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,342
- Babe, I'm so glad you're here.

1080
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,360
What was she cut with?

1081
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,730
- A box cutter.

1082
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,490
- A box cutter?

1083
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,110
You mean that thing with a razor blade?

1084
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,430
- Uh-huh.

1085
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:14,330
- Some little punk kid comes
to school with a weapon.

1086
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,190
And that's what it is
Harvey, it's a weapon,

1087
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,770
and the school let that happen!

1088
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,350
Did you confront Mrs. Troy with this

1089
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,920
because I would love to
hear her explain this.

1090
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,550
- Alice brought the box cutter.

1091
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,383
- What?
- Yeah.

1092
00:49:24,383 --> 00:49:25,470
She started waving it around

1093
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:29,233
like a martial arts type of
things and she cut herself.

1094
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,467
(children yelling)

1095
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,634
(church bell tolling)

1096
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:38,720
- I'm sorry.

1097
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,120
- [Mary Beth] I'm sorry too.

1098
00:49:43,235 --> 00:49:45,340
- Can I still go to
Brittany's birthday party?

1099
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,173
- Next year.

1100
00:49:47,455 --> 00:49:50,523
(children yelling)

1101
00:49:50,523 --> 00:49:53,356
(whistle blowing)

1102
00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:13,620
(Matthew sighing)

1103
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,153
- [Matthew] You like what you do?

1104
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,200
- What do I what?

1105
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,660
- I honestly don't know
many police officers.

1106
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,493
Do you like it?

1107
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:29,533
- Actually, I don't even think
about it that way anymore.

1108
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,003
I do it very well,

1109
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,590
and I've been doing it for so long

1110
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:37,930
that it stopped being
about, "Well, do I like it."

1111
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,323
It's just what I am.

1112
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,373
There's something to be said for,

1113
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,610
not that it's always comfortable

1114
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,940
because that wouldn't describe it.

1115
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:52,483
But, when I'm working, it's my world.

1116
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,500
It's home base.

1117
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,940
And I think that means more than just

1118
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,203
do you like it or not.

1119
00:51:01,203 --> 00:51:02,740
- Maybe.

1120
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,660
- Now that's not to say that

1121
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,347
once or twice a year I don't start saying,

1122
00:51:06,347 --> 00:51:08,567
"Oh, I pissed it all away.

1123
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:11,127
"I'm just a beat cop
who became a lieutenant

1124
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:12,597
"and stalled right there."

1125
00:51:14,565 --> 00:51:16,680
But that's just the blues.

1126
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,880
What incredible insight.

1127
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,080
I don't even know what you do.

1128
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,350
- Well, I started
importing exotic hardwoods.

1129
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,339
The most beautiful wood in the world.

1130
00:51:36,339 --> 00:51:37,370
- Really?

1131
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,630
- But I don't do that anymore.

1132
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,800
My business grew,

1133
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,850
and I got an offer that was irresistible.

1134
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,840
So I sold my import business

1135
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:50,240
and I invested in a small
telecommunications company,

1136
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,260
which did very well.

1137
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,390
And the years have passed,

1138
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:56,853
and now I'm an investor.

1139
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:58,780
- Do you like it?

1140
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,510
- I'm good at it.

1141
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,273
- You're a very successful man.

1142
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:07,620
- Yes, I am, aren't I?

1143
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,373
I'm a very successful man.

1144
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:30,670
- [Harvey] I'm not saying
it's not important, Mary Beth.

1145
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:31,650
I'm saying there's no reason

1146
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,090
to keep her away from a birthday party.

1147
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,628
- Can't it wait, please,
even for a minute.

1148
00:52:36,628 --> 00:52:38,150
(TV show blaring)

1149
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,680
TV goes off please.

1150
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,290
- This is just what my folks did.

1151
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:42,390
Kid screws up, and suddenly

1152
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,770
the whole house falls in punishment mode.

1153
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,290
Events get canceled.

1154
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:47,250
Traffic stops.

1155
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,545
- No, Harv, we're not getting
off into what happened to you.

1156
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:51,780
- I'm saying that my parents
were wrong, Mary Beth.

1157
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,200
- No, Harvey!

1158
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,280
Ordinary and normal are over
in this house for a minute!

1159
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,660
I want this kid stopped cold by this.

1160
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,720
- Don't you think the cut on the hand

1161
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,800
is a pretty good lesson in
not to play with knives.

1162
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,460
- That's not the lesson
I want her to learn!

1163
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,293
- Oh?

1164
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:06,450
- I want her to learn that you
can't prove you're a big girl

1165
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,900
by intimidating other children.

1166
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,190
There's an element of bullying in it.

1167
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,250
- Bullying, Alice?
- I'm gonna put

1168
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,160
a stop to it now!

1169
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,200
- Well, I couldn't possibly
disagree with you more.

1170
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,210
- I'm right about this.

1171
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:17,750
- No way this is just a
case of forbidden fruit.

1172
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,890
She couldn't resist.

1173
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,710
So she's suffering the consequences.

1174
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,240
Nine-years-olds learn
this stuff every day.

1175
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,610
- Well, this nine-year-old

1176
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,310
is gonna miss out on Brittany's birthday,

1177
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,220
and she's gonna lose her
allowance for two weeks.

1178
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,680
And there's no TV for a month!

1179
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,970
- [Harvey] That is nuts!

1180
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:34,760
- And bedtime is 7:30
until further notice!

1181
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,900
(onions sizzling)

1182
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,890
- God help you, Alice.

1183
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:40,930
Your mother's learned a
taste for the hard line.!

1184
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:41,850
- [Mary Beth] What did you say?

1185
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:43,300
- I say keep your capital punishment

1186
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,600
in the courtroom, Mary Beth.

1187
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,343
Save it for Raymond Bolzer.

1188
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:52,868
Oh, I'm taking Alice to the
birthday party tomorrow.

1189
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:55,500
(onions sizzling)

1190
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,333
- Oh, geez!

1191
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,830
- [Christine] I love these pictures

1192
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:06,260
every single one of them.

1193
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,460
- She never got around to
putting them on the walls.

1194
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,810
- They're Darcy.

1195
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:11,970
Did she shoot these?

1196
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:12,953
- She was good.

1197
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:14,857
- Very.

1198
00:54:14,857 --> 00:54:16,853
Do you know how she managed this one?

1199
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,820
- Everyone looks so
natural, nobody's posed.

1200
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,720
How did she do it?

1201
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,940
- Well, there are cameras

1202
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,830
with the lens at a 90-degree angle,

1203
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:24,790
so you're pointing this way.

1204
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,930
But you're actually shooting that way.

1205
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,593
- So the subject never knows.

1206
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,560
- She still had a couple
of cameras I gave her.

1207
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,470
And now surprise because Patina and I

1208
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,450
we tried rewarding Darcy
for staying clean and sober.

1209
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,363
So I gave her every camera I had.

1210
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
I filled the refrigerator with film

1211
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,870
and we never saw anymore pictures.

1212
00:54:49,135 --> 00:54:51,750
- Well, it sounds like
you were very good to her.

1213
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,750
You paid for this place too, didn't you?

1214
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,450
- Yes, I did.

1215
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,900
However, we warned Darcy

1216
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,930
that if she didn't obey our rules,

1217
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:02,763
she'd have to make her own way

1218
00:55:02,763 --> 00:55:04,960
in the world without our help.

1219
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,800
So, she takes up with a man

1220
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,017
who makes his living selling drugs.

1221
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:13,130
(slams candle in box)

1222
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,023
Costa Rican.

1223
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,723
And in the first month, he broke her arm.

1224
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,150
Yeah.

1225
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:26,933
And I went crazy.

1226
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,310
Sight unseen, I hire a completely

1227
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:34,303
unscrupulous private
investigator named Yap.

1228
00:55:35,774 --> 00:55:38,710
And we had long phone
conversations Mr. Yap and I

1229
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,510
cooking up every scheme in the book.

1230
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,710
And in a way it was
wonderful talking to a guy

1231
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,960
who would do anything
if the price was right.

1232
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,560
- [Christine] You're right that is crazy.

1233
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,393
- Yeah.

1234
00:55:49,393 --> 00:55:51,440
- You never even met this man?

1235
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,273
- Right.

1236
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,120
So, (sighing)

1237
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,413
We agreed to kidnap Darcy.

1238
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,513
We called it an intervention.

1239
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:05,953
So he snatches her.

1240
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,250
We put her into Watch Hill for treatment.

1241
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:18,875
My wife Patina never forgave me for that.

1242
00:56:23,015 --> 00:56:25,515
And what we had just collapsed

1243
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,150
under the weight of Darcy's troubles.

1244
00:56:34,176 --> 00:56:35,789
- Was that the end of Mr. Yap?

1245
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:38,400
- Oh, no, of course not.

1246
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,263
He called now and then to
offer follow up services.

1247
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,523
He even swore that Darcy was
seeing the drug dealer again.

1248
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,923
Now Darcy swore,

1249
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,610
with every gesture possible,

1250
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:54,653
that it wasn't true.

1251
00:56:55,657 --> 00:56:58,403
"Please, daddy, believe me.

1252
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:00,592
(scoffs)

1253
00:57:00,592 --> 00:57:01,457
"Please."

1254
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,930
And I had to chose between the word

1255
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:15,260
of a gross, greedy, unprincipled stranger,

1256
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,903
and the word of my own daughter.

1257
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,683
And I believed him.

1258
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,770
For the rest of my life

1259
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,990
I'm gonna have to live with that.

1260
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,380
- You'd been burned before.

1261
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,503
It's understandable.

1262
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:49,093
- You can afford to be generous.

1263
00:57:49,093 --> 00:57:51,003
You didn't make the choice.

1264
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,733
That killed her.

1265
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,790
- Matt, somebody's gotta
cut you some slack,

1266
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,460
and it's obviously not gonna be you.

1267
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,333
So, I vote for me.

1268
00:58:32,361 --> 00:58:34,120
- So you're working Saturdays too, huh?

1269
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,260
- Hey, trying to make
a dent in my messages.

1270
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,350
You?

1271
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,477
- I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.

1272
00:58:38,477 --> 00:58:39,373
You wanna come?

1273
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,400
- Nah, I brought mine.

1274
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,723
- Come on.

1275
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:45,603
I'll bring you back.

1276
00:58:46,687 --> 00:58:47,520
(bag rattles)

1277
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,970
See, you shouldn't eat alone.

1278
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:58,640
This is a beautiful little girl.

1279
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,850
And now this beautiful child

1280
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:02,690
takes a weapon to school.

1281
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,010
Harvey says I'm making too much of it,

1282
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,450
but to me, (sighs)

1283
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,990
it's like we're watching her innocence die

1284
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,370
in front of our eyes.

1285
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,520
- Yeah, well, you see more than him.

1286
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,920
- [Mary Beth] No,
Harvey's very perceptive.

1287
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,753
- No, don't get me wrong.

1288
00:59:13,753 --> 00:59:15,150
I'm saying because you were a cop,

1289
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,450
you've seen more than him.

1290
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:18,700
You've seen evil.

1291
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,533
You've smelled evil.

1292
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:20,873
You know evil exists.

1293
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,090
I go through the same thing with Maureen.

1294
00:59:25,593 --> 00:59:27,620
Hell, I go through the same
things with the lawyers.

1295
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,453
- [Mary Beth] Yeah.

1296
00:59:28,453 --> 00:59:30,270
- I don't care how many crime scenes

1297
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,145
a guy like Doug Trayne visits.

1298
00:59:32,145 --> 00:59:33,650
- It's not the same.
- Not the same.

1299
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:34,483
They don't know.

1300
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,640
No, I don't think you're crazy

1301
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,806
for wanting your kid to
stay descent, Mary Beth.

1302
00:59:40,806 --> 00:59:42,574
I think, it's the world that's crazy.

1303
00:59:42,574 --> 00:59:45,157
(bright music)

1304
00:59:56,097 --> 00:59:58,170
- You know I collected cameras for years.

1305
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,870
My grandfather he was an architect,

1306
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,220
and right after he died,

1307
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,940
I started photographing buildings.

1308
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,420
Of course, I tried to get Darcy
interested in it but no, no.

1309
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:11,132
She only wanted to take
pictures of people.

1310
01:00:11,132 --> 01:00:13,477
- Well, I'm with her.

1311
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:16,172
(bright music)

1312
01:00:16,172 --> 01:00:17,763
What do you think of that building?

1313
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:21,093
- Why you like those buildings?

1314
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:26,078
- Well, yeah.

1315
01:00:26,078 --> 01:00:27,853
- Well, then get out of the way.

1316
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:29,853
Sit over there.
- Sorry.

1317
01:00:31,324 --> 01:00:32,491
- There we go.

1318
01:00:35,644 --> 01:00:38,823
(camera beeps and flashes)

1319
01:00:38,823 --> 01:00:41,530
(camera whirring)

1320
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:42,740
- I'm surprised a gumball

1321
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,830
doesn't jump out of that thing.

1322
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:46,340
- Oh, you wait and see.

1323
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,983
This makes beautiful pictures.

1324
01:00:52,938 --> 01:00:53,880
- You want buildings, listen,

1325
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,520
this cities lousy with building.

1326
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,590
Come with me.

1327
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,278
- Watch out!

1328
01:01:00,278 --> 01:01:02,718
- Oh, I'm so, excuse me.

1329
01:01:02,718 --> 01:01:03,551
Oh, god.

1330
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,718
Sorry.

1331
01:01:05,718 --> 01:01:07,280
(laughing)

1332
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,640
How was your weekend?

1333
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,380
- My weekend was productive.

1334
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,312
I came in Saturday went
through the messages.

1335
01:01:13,312 --> 01:01:15,600
(alert buzzing)
- Ma'am, try again, please.

1336
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,493
Have you got any keys.
- I know why you're happy.

1337
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,826
- I swore I wouldn't let on.

1338
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:22,650
You can tell.

1339
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,940
- I was talking about the Yankee's

1340
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,030
taking two out of three in Boston.

1341
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,984
What are you talking about?

1342
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:28,817
- You won't like it.

1343
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:31,033
You're wrong, but you'll disapprove.

1344
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,170
- A guy, a drinker?

1345
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,220
- Doesn't seem to be.

1346
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,063
- Married?

1347
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:44,550
- Ladies and gentlemen, of the jury,

1348
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,363
this is a capital case.

1349
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,070
- How married is he?

1350
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:54,443
- We will show you the
scene of the murder.

1351
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,160
You will see how the accused

1352
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,270
waited in a car borrowed from a friend

1353
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:04,130
and how he followed Lester
Purchase from his delivery

1354
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,390
at the Chadwell Market on the 1200-block

1355
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,650
of Queens Parkway South

1356
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:12,290
to the Zhukov Brothers
Market on the 1800-block.

1357
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,370
You will hear scientific testimony

1358
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:17,570
of a fatal shot to the head,

1359
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:22,433
which the accused
delivered to Mr. Purchase.

1360
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:30,270
And after he had stolen $513 in cash,

1361
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:35,340
and after he had taken the life

1362
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,533
of this hard-working man, this good man,

1363
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,770
Raymond Bolzer took a
single gold wedding ring

1364
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:48,513
from the third finger of
the victim's left hand.

1365
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,200
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1366
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,563
that ring was missing for a long time.

1367
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,130
But it was found in the home

1368
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:01,933
of the aunt of the accused,

1369
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,840
a woman who says she's
never seen that ring before,

1370
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,640
a woman who never knew Lester Purchase.

1371
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,060
There is only one link

1372
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,050
between Lester Purchase

1373
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,263
and the aunt of Raymond Bolzer.

1374
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:23,793
And, ladies and gentlemen,
that is Raymond Bolzer.

1375
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:33,758
(telephones ringing in offices)

1376
01:03:33,758 --> 01:03:36,040
(people chattering)

1377
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,540
- [Mary Beth] I've got it.

1378
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,200
Thank you, ma'am.

1379
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,140
You're being used.

1380
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,100
- You better believe it.

1381
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,540
Used and useful, yes.

1382
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,440
- This is not some knee jerk moral thing.

1383
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,270
I'm thinking about what he's doing to you.

1384
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:48,410
Hello.

1385
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:50,090
Mister, uh?

1386
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:50,923
Oaks.

1387
01:03:50,923 --> 01:03:51,850
Mr. Oaks, please.

1388
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:52,800
- Am I happy?

1389
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,500
Let me be happy.

1390
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,333
- It's Investigator Lacey

1391
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,570
with the District Attorney's office.

1392
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,699
Thank you.

1393
01:03:58,699 --> 01:03:59,610
You come to me when it's over.

1394
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,980
Tell me how happy you are.

1395
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,390
- Cagney.

1396
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,640
Yeah, Lee, hi, what's up?

1397
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,083
Sure.

1398
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,620
Sure, yeah.

1399
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:10,453
Right away.

1400
01:04:10,453 --> 01:04:11,286
Okay, thanks.

1401
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:13,523
- What's up?

1402
01:04:13,523 --> 01:04:15,310
- They're holding a guy
who could be my shooter.

1403
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,730
I'm gonna go take a look at him.

1404
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:17,790
- Great.
- Would that be

1405
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,040
a kick in the head?

1406
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,010
Beep me if you need me.

1407
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:20,843
- Go.

1408
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,763
Mr. Oaks, it's Investigator.

1409
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,103
Nice to meet you too, sir.

1410
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,870
You called last week
about the Bolzer case.

1411
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:36,280
Sure.

1412
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,270
No, no, sure.

1413
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:38,123
It matters.

1414
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,593
Where is your store?

1415
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:44,880
(people chattering)

1416
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,137
- I'll take a look.
- is this fresh?

1417
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:52,773
- Mr. Oaks.

1418
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,670
- Oh, you're with the DA?

1419
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,133
- [Mary Beth] Investigator Lacey.

1420
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,700
- I've been getting
called by someone working

1421
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,840
for Bolzer's lawyer every day.

1422
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,740
They don't let up.

1423
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:08,683
I've been putting them off

1424
01:05:08,683 --> 01:05:10,420
because I wanted to
talk to you guys first.

1425
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:12,530
I don't wanna say or do
nothing to screw things up.

1426
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,830
- We appreciate that, sir.

1427
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:16,280
What was it you wanted us to know?

1428
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,380
- Well, it's a little thing.

1429
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,060
But I'm sure you guys got it wrong.

1430
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,540
- [Mary Beth] What?

1431
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,060
- I played card with Lester Purchase.

1432
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:24,310
I know him maybe, I don't know, 15 years.

1433
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:26,530
I see him deliver in here twice a week,

1434
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:29,060
and on Tuesday nights we played cards.

1435
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,110
He never wore a ring.

1436
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,840
- You can't remember Mr.
Purchase wearing a ring?

1437
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,980
- Listen, you can believe
me or not believe me.

1438
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,240
Don't play with my words.

1439
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,363
I never saw Lester Purchase with a ring.

1440
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,173
- Yes, sir.

1441
01:05:43,794 --> 01:05:44,627
Those are nice.

1442
01:05:44,627 --> 01:05:45,460
- They sure are.

1443
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,880
- What'd get for those?

1444
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,170
- Special today.

1445
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,922
The DA Special we call it.

1446
01:05:49,922 --> 01:05:52,005
(laughs)

1447
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:01,210
- [Christine] Number five.

1448
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,888
- You wanna take another second?

1449
01:06:03,888 --> 01:06:06,180
- [Christine] It's number five, Lee.

1450
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,080
- Thank you, ma'am.

1451
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,173
- [Christine] You're welcome.

1452
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,873
- That okay with you, Miss O'Neil?

1453
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:14,550
- Yes.
- Keep number five in the pen.

1454
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,250
- You get all the easy cases, don't you?

1455
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,083
- Oh, no.

1456
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:21,170
This will get gummed up.

1457
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:24,017
Now we have to find out who hired him.

1458
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:24,850
- "Who hired him?"

1459
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,630
Your obsessed Costa Rican boyfriend.

1460
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,690
- I called him in, you know.

1461
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,400
He claims that when he
heard about the shooting,

1462
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,850
his first thought was,
"It should've been me."

1463
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,110
- What?
- He says

1464
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:37,490
that the shooter mistook
Gabriel Ramos for himself.

1465
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,020
That he had been threatened
to keep away from Darcy Wylie

1466
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,433
or else he'd end up dead.

1467
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,690
Nuts.

1468
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:45,082
- [Christine] He didn't happen
to say who threatened him.

1469
01:06:45,082 --> 01:06:47,260
- (scoffs) No, he didn't have a name.

1470
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,770
Of course, he didn't.

1471
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:53,770
But he offered a detailed
description of a giant guy,

1472
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,030
fat big, not muscle big,

1473
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:00,266
who claimed to be a private investigator.

1474
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:03,235
(dramatic music)

1475
01:07:03,235 --> 01:07:04,635
- And he didn't have a name.

1476
01:07:04,635 --> 01:07:06,560
- No, I said he didn't have a name.

1477
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,380
Just a description.

1478
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,900
He claims that he saw
this guy following Darcy

1479
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,330
a few months ago.

1480
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:15,260
Now I'm supposed to
locate this un-named PI,

1481
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,030
and find out who hired him

1482
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:18,513
to threaten my prime suspect.

1483
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,670
(papers rustling)

1484
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,562
I don't believe any of it.

1485
01:07:24,562 --> 01:07:27,312
(dramatic music)

1486
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:30,007
But like you said, "This is an easy one.

1487
01:07:30,007 --> 01:07:32,220
"I should relax and enjoy it."

1488
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,870
Still, you never know.

1489
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:38,534
(gentle piano music)

1490
01:08:29,876 --> 01:08:32,459
(gentle music)

1491
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:34,381
- Rough day.

1492
01:08:36,523 --> 01:08:39,380
- The ghosts are already dancing.

1493
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:41,547
(sighing)

1494
01:08:51,892 --> 01:08:54,380
- Now the important thing is
keep breathing that's all.

1495
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,314
Okay?

1496
01:08:55,314 --> 01:08:56,910
(people chattering)

1497
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:57,743
You all right?

1498
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,540
You look good, Ron?

1499
01:09:02,593 --> 01:09:04,460
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1500
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,400
Now you just,

1501
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,550
you wait here a sec
while I go see if I can

1502
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,720
tell how soon before you're called.

1503
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,133
All right, tuck your shirt in.

1504
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,093
Sit down.

1505
01:09:18,264 --> 01:09:19,700
(paper rustling)

1506
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,510
- I'm opening an envelop.

1507
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:22,853
I'm removing a ring.

1508
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,313
I'm holding a gold ring,

1509
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,530
fairly large sized,

1510
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,253
with faceted edges,

1511
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:34,320
and an inscription inside.

1512
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,870
- Can you read the inscription?

1513
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:42,000
- It says, "12/28/59."

1514
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,503
- Is this the ring found
at the home of Grace Pound?

1515
01:09:45,503 --> 01:09:46,800
- Yes, it is.

1516
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,803
- Your Honor, entered into
evidence is State's 59.

1517
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:53,740
No further questions.

1518
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,573
(dramatic music)

1519
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:05,280
- [Mary Beth] You walked
out of here yesterday

1520
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,930
with the key to the file cabinet.

1521
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,930
- Yes, I did.

1522
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:10,763
Sorry.

1523
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:14,023
- [Mary Beth] Give it to me please.

1524
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:16,840
- Here, hello to you too.

1525
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,673
- Thanks.

1526
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,550
Christine.

1527
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:23,383
- What?

1528
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:30,000
- Christine, I believe that
the wedding ring I found

1529
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,330
is planted evidence.

1530
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:32,630
- What?

1531
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:34,580
- I spoke with a very credible witness.

1532
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,740
Lester Purchase didn't wear a ring.

1533
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:40,460
- The ring is in evidence.

1534
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:43,330
- The autopsy mentions arthritis.

1535
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:44,163
Now look at his hand.

1536
01:10:44,163 --> 01:10:44,996
See his hand.

1537
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:48,130
Well, his joints are swollen.

1538
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:51,270
But a lot of people with
swollen joints wear rings.

1539
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:53,403
- How'd Bolzer get the ring off?

1540
01:10:53,403 --> 01:10:55,350
- Well, I don't know.

1541
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:57,770
- Remember the interview
with Mrs. Purchase?

1542
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:58,970
- Yeah.
- I wanna play you

1543
01:10:58,970 --> 01:10:59,803
a piece of it.

1544
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:01,663
Excuse me.

1545
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:03,773
- Geez, Mary Beth.

1546
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,013
- Listen to her.

1547
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:13,830
- [Mrs. Purchase] On the
inside it says "12/28/59."

1548
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:14,680
That's our wedding day.

1549
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,500
- [Mike] You have the
ring in your possession?

1550
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,600
- [Mrs. Purchase] No, sir.

1551
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,010
- [Mike] Was your
husband wearing that ring

1552
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,780
the last time you saw him?

1553
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,613
- Here.

1554
01:11:24,016 --> 01:11:25,943
- [Mrs. Purchase] Dear
God, make me strong.

1555
01:11:28,378 --> 01:11:29,923
(coughs) Yes, sir.

1556
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,540
(tape clicks)

1557
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:36,250
- Her little prayer.

1558
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,597
- She's just dreading the news,

1559
01:11:37,597 --> 01:11:39,437
"They're gonna tell me
they found his ring.

1560
01:11:39,437 --> 01:11:41,310
"Dear God, make me strong."

1561
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:46,310
- Or, "Here comes the lie I have to tell.

1562
01:11:46,547 --> 01:11:48,824
"Dear God, make me strong."

1563
01:11:48,824 --> 01:11:51,934
(tape rewinding)

1564
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:56,311
- [Mrs. Purchase] Dear
God, make me strong.

1565
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:57,883
(coughs) Yes, sir.

1566
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:02,551
- Mary Beth, you found the evidence.

1567
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,293
- Mike Foy led me to it.

1568
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,550
I think, he planned the whole thing.

1569
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:11,383
- Hold it.

1570
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:14,043
Hold it.

1571
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:20,200
Did he enter the room before you?

1572
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,450
- I went first.

1573
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:23,050
- Was there ever a time when he was alone

1574
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:24,440
with the shoeboxes?

1575
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,500
- I was there the whole time.

1576
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,440
- [Christine] Did you see him
drop anything into the box?

1577
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,273
- No.

1578
01:12:30,273 --> 01:12:32,460
- Well, then cut it out!

1579
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,323
- Where's the key to the file cabinet?

1580
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,630
- I gave it to you two seconds ago.

1581
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,050
- I don't have it.

1582
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:39,950
Check your drawer.

1583
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,620
- It's not in my drawer.

1584
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,523
Don't you remember I gave it to you.

1585
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,310
How'd that get in my drawer?

1586
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:53,323
- Was there ever a time that
I was alone with that drawer?

1587
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:01,721
(key jangles)

1588
01:13:04,206 --> 01:13:06,206
(sighs)

1589
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:10,660
- The jury's already seen the ring.

1590
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,593
It's out there.

1591
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,633
Are you certain?

1592
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:19,080
- It's a moral certainty, sir.

1593
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,130
I can't tell you I saw anything I didn't.

1594
01:13:22,622 --> 01:13:23,455
(sighs)

1595
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,260
- Does Foy know what you know?

1596
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,380
- We haven't said anything.

1597
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:29,890
- We thought in the event
that he was charged, sir.

1598
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,450
- Hey, I don't wanna hear about it.

1599
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:32,520
You're talking about charging

1600
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,823
the chief detective in a capital case.

1601
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:38,500
Well, there's nothing to do but drop it.

1602
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,630
- There's no direct evidence
that it was planted.

1603
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:43,340
- If Lacey can make her case to you,

1604
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,380
don't you think that Kaplovitz

1605
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:45,740
can find a half a dozen people

1606
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,640
who knew the victim never wore a ring.

1607
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,600
We're dropping it.

1608
01:13:51,173 --> 01:13:53,493
(sighing) We're gonna
pay for this big time.

1609
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,080
Kaplovitz is way too smart.

1610
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,363
We're gonna pay for this.

1611
01:14:00,443 --> 01:14:02,755
(groans)

1612
01:14:02,755 --> 01:14:06,505
(people chatting in offices)

1613
01:14:27,141 --> 01:14:29,470
- When are they putting you on the stand?

1614
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:30,303
- Tomorrow.

1615
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:33,530
No keep going, Alice, that sounded good.

1616
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,430
- I'm sorry, Mary Beth.

1617
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,500
You're being used

1618
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,503
by Foy, by the DA.

1619
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,950
You're just part of the politics.

1620
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,007
I hate what they're doing to you.

1621
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:03,830
- [Jan] Have you ever seen members

1622
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:06,333
of the police department plant evidence?

1623
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,940
- No, sir.

1624
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,750
- In 20 years as an officer

1625
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,570
in the New York Police Department,

1626
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:14,800
have you ever seen a fellow officer

1627
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,493
move, or alter, or fabricate evidence?

1628
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:20,803
- No, sir.

1629
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,600
- Are you aware of how restrictive

1630
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,640
the Rules of Evidence are, Mrs. Lacey?

1631
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,920
- [Doug] Objection, vague?

1632
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,943
- Overruled.

1633
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:30,920
- I'm aware of the Rules of Evidence--

1634
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,190
- Are you aware--

1635
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,333
- Can we let the witness
finish, Your Honor?

1636
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:40,430
- I'm aware of the Rules of
Evidence and I obey them.

1637
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:42,330
- Are you aware that most officers

1638
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,330
consider these rules unfair

1639
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:45,920
and impossibly restrictive?

1640
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,580
- Objection, foundational?

1641
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,918
- Sustained.

1642
01:15:48,918 --> 01:15:50,660
(sighs)

1643
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:54,790
- Well, then did you witness

1644
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:58,053
any officer in this case plant evidence?

1645
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,400
- No, sir.

1646
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,270
- Did you plant a wedding ring

1647
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:05,233
at the home of Grace Pound?

1648
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:07,743
- No, sir, I did not.

1649
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:14,260
- Mrs. Lacey, are you
aware of any statements

1650
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,740
by the District Attorney

1651
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,450
that the first person to
be executed in this state

1652
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,890
under its knew capital crimes law,

1653
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,700
will have to be of the white race?

1654
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,170
- Objection, foundational.

1655
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,560
Irrelevant badgering.

1656
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,860
- I withdraw the question.

1657
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:32,870
- Did you refer to my
strategy in this case,

1658
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:35,640
as, "White trash defense?"

1659
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,490
- Objection.

1660
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,410
When, where, foundation?

1661
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,880
- I'll establish foundation, Your Honor.

1662
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:41,893
- Proceed.

1663
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,650
- Have we seen each
other before, Mr. Lacey?

1664
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:47,690
- A couple times.

1665
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,190
- And was one of those occasions

1666
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:51,790
inside the courthouse in
the presence of Mrs. Pound?

1667
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,500
- Yes, sir.
- And on that occasion

1668
01:16:55,500 --> 01:17:00,067
did you use the term,
"What trash defense?"

1669
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,090
- That wasn't me, sir.

1670
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:08,423
- Oh, but heard those words?

1671
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:16,447
- I'm not sure of the exact words.

1672
01:17:16,447 --> 01:17:18,260
- "White trash",

1673
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,123
do you remember those words?

1674
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,060
- Yes, sir.

1675
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,223
- [Jan] Do you remember
who said those words?

1676
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,040
- It was said in a light manner, sir.

1677
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,263
- Did Mrs. Pound react
to it in a light manner?

1678
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:37,490
- No, sir.

1679
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:40,880
- Would you like being called white trash?

1680
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,460
- Objection, badgering.

1681
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,583
- Sustained.

1682
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,457
- Who used the words, "White trash?"

1683
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:59,120
- Lieutenant Christine Cagney, sir.

1684
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,790
You're a disgrace, Michael.
- I don't appreciate--

1685
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,030
- I'm ashamed to work with you!

1686
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,303
- Come on, you know as well as I do

1687
01:18:16,303 --> 01:18:18,330
Trayne's case was falling apart.

1688
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,890
He's got his thumb up his ass.

1689
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:22,330
- Yeah, what if this destroys the case?

1690
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,870
You talked Mrs. Purchase into lying.

1691
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,420
What are you gonna tell her to say

1692
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:26,750
if they put her on the stand?

1693
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:27,830
- She's not gonna testify.

1694
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:29,480
They wouldn't take the chance.

1695
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,330
Come on, you did just fine there.

1696
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:32,347
They took their best shot at you,

1697
01:18:32,347 --> 01:18:34,120
and you got out alive.

1698
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,870
- You are a sworn officer of the law.

1699
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,133
What about your shield?

1700
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:39,162
Did you think about your
oath and your shield?

1701
01:18:39,162 --> 01:18:40,412
(dramatic music)

1702
01:18:40,412 --> 01:18:41,467
- Can't leave it to
the lawyers, Mary Beth.

1703
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,330
They'll ruin it every time.

1704
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:44,350
- Wrong, Michael.

1705
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:47,140
No, the only time it ever works

1706
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,540
is when the police do
what they are sworn to do!

1707
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,997
Come on, Chris.

1708
01:18:53,997 --> 01:18:56,747
(dramatic music)

1709
01:19:09,284 --> 01:19:13,150
I'm sorry as hell about
what happened on the stand.

1710
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:16,363
- Don't you ever apologize
to me for telling the truth.

1711
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:41,011
That private investigator
you hired Mr. Yap.

1712
01:19:41,011 --> 01:19:42,509
- [Matthew] Mm-hmm.

1713
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:44,284
- You used the word, "gross."

1714
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:45,948
- [Matthew] He is.

1715
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:47,382
- He's big.
- Right.

1716
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:48,653
- [Christine] And fat.

1717
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:49,670
- Yeah, he's gross.

1718
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:50,550
- How do you know?

1719
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:51,993
You never saw him.

1720
01:19:53,234 --> 01:19:54,489
- What a memory you have.

1721
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:55,350
- [Christine] (laughs) Yeah.

1722
01:19:55,350 --> 01:20:00,350
- I suppose when we talked
on the phone, he told me.

1723
01:20:00,688 --> 01:20:02,328
(laughs)

1724
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:05,078
(dramatic music)

1725
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:10,177
(elevator chimes)

1726
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,573
- Yeah.

1727
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,543
I sure will.

1728
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,950
Hang on, Lee.

1729
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,713
Lee Moyer he called twice already.

1730
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,257
- I'm not here.

1731
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,420
- She's ducking you, Lee, what can I say?

1732
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,140
- I can't talk to him
right now, Mary Beth.

1733
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:01,190
I know I have to talk to him, and I will.

1734
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,340
I just can't do it now.

1735
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,130
- You don't have to talk
to anybody, Christine.

1736
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:06,963
That's okay.

1737
01:21:11,557 --> 01:21:13,403
- (sighs) I'm worse than Mike Foy.

1738
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:16,396
- You are not.

1739
01:21:16,396 --> 01:21:18,450
(sobbing)

1740
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:20,270
- He was just trying
to hold a case together

1741
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:21,940
that was failing apart.

1742
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:23,640
At least he was on the right side.

1743
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:31,450
I've been withholding information

1744
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:33,323
about a suspect in a murder trial.

1745
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:37,053
I've been protecting a suspect.

1746
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:42,460
That's why Moyer wants to see me.

1747
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:45,577
And until I came in here
today I didn't care.

1748
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,800
- I'll go with you to see Moyer.

1749
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,170
But you have got to tell me everything.

1750
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:56,200
- I think the father of Darcy Wylie

1751
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,100
hired a private investigator
to have her boyfriend killed.

1752
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,320
- And you've been protecting him?

1753
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,970
- Yeah, I've been protecting him.

1754
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,620
I've been sleeping with him.

1755
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:12,110
- Did you think you had
a future with this man?

1756
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:13,823
- No, that isn't why I did it.

1757
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:18,833
No, I don't have a future with him.

1758
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:25,440
- You know that what you have done

1759
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,820
is objection of justice.

1760
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,903
- I didn't care.
- Do you care now?

1761
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:33,813
- Yes.

1762
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:37,380
(sobbing)

1763
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,213
Sorry.

1764
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,290
Will you go with me to see Moyer?

1765
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,393
- We can't go now.

1766
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,210
Trayne asked to see us
before court starts today.

1767
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,153
- You're right.

1768
01:23:06,046 --> 01:23:08,920
(door creaks)

1769
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,843
- I made my opening
statement on Monday the 5th.

1770
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:16,223
I've learned Mr. Oaks called
this office last week.

1771
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,870
If you had met with him earlier,

1772
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:21,520
I could've kept the jury
from hearing about the ring.

1773
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,940
I'd like an explanation.

1774
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,430
- I don't have an explanation.

1775
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:27,840
- That's crap!

1776
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,560
I don't accept that.

1777
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,540
I wanna know what you were
doing on Friday the 2nd!

1778
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,930
- I apologize, sir.

1779
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:35,780
My daughter had a problem at school.

1780
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:37,450
- Four days, Mrs. Lacey.

1781
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:38,970
- There were hundreds of messages, sir.

1782
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:40,400
Everybody in the building was swamped.

1783
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,890
- Yeah, that's right it was a lot of work.

1784
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:45,493
That's what you're paid
to do a lot of work!

1785
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:48,393
What's your excuse?

1786
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:52,250
- We're human beings, sir.

1787
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:53,270
- I'm not talking to you.

1788
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,333
I'm talking to her.

1789
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,780
- I don't have an excuse.

1790
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:59,480
- Don't give me that.

1791
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:02,440
You're posturing I'm not
gonna let you pull that.

1792
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,440
- No, sir.
- I have series questions

1793
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,253
about your professionalism
and your competence.

1794
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,820
- I do too.
- Come on, Christine.

1795
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:12,800
We'll reschedule this meeting.

1796
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,020
This isn't fair.

1797
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:14,860
- [Doug] This isn't fair?

1798
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:17,220
- No, sir, she has a
right to put up a defense.

1799
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,360
She won't do it, come on, Chris.

1800
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,500
You understand, sir?
- Yeah.

1801
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,030
If Cagney wants to pull herself together,

1802
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:23,030
I certainly have no!

1803
01:24:30,033 --> 01:24:31,618
(sighs)

1804
01:24:31,618 --> 01:24:33,701
(chimes)

1805
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:53,240
- Don't make it all
complicated with Lee Moyer.

1806
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,060
Just tell him what you know,

1807
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,510
and spare him the love story.

1808
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,183
I'm coming with.

1809
01:25:03,924 --> 01:25:05,270
- No, this is mine.

1810
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,103
- I know.

1811
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:08,373
I'd like to stand by.

1812
01:25:11,755 --> 01:25:16,755
- Okay.

1813
01:25:20,212 --> 01:25:21,820
(telephones ringing in offices)

1814
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:24,653
(people chatting)

1815
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,700
I know Mr. Wylie is in town

1816
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,051
if you wanna talk to him.

1817
01:25:29,051 --> 01:25:30,677
- [Lee] Mm-hmm.

1818
01:25:30,677 --> 01:25:32,627
You get my phone messages this morning?

1819
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:36,430
- Thought I'd come in person.

1820
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:37,480
- The shooter talked.

1821
01:25:38,443 --> 01:25:41,340
(dramatic music)

1822
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:44,204
He fingered the old boyfriend
as the man that hired him.

1823
01:25:44,204 --> 01:25:47,160
(dramatic music)

1824
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,263
- The Costa Rican?

1825
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:52,350
- You said, "This case
would be dead bang simple."

1826
01:25:53,891 --> 01:25:56,641
(dramatic music)

1827
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,493
- And so it was.

1828
01:26:04,635 --> 01:26:06,051
(horns honking)

1829
01:26:06,051 --> 01:26:07,692
(engines revving)

1830
01:26:07,692 --> 01:26:11,025
(soft knocking on door)

1831
01:26:15,579 --> 01:26:16,412
- Hi.
- Hi.

1832
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,733
My kids called today.

1833
01:26:23,459 --> 01:26:25,132
- Did you have a nice talk?

1834
01:26:25,132 --> 01:26:25,965
- Oh, yes.

1835
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,897
They said they missed me, and I was glad.

1836
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:31,753
No panic.

1837
01:26:36,177 --> 01:26:38,467
- You're going home?

1838
01:26:38,467 --> 01:26:39,733
- Yeah.

1839
01:26:39,733 --> 01:26:42,340
(gentle music)

1840
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:44,187
- Well, that's good.

1841
01:26:44,187 --> 01:26:46,290
That was sort of the idea, wasn't it?

1842
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,643
- Christine.
- Yeah.

1843
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:52,383
- I don't know why you were sent to me.

1844
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:56,367
But I know for certain that you were.

1845
01:27:02,115 --> 01:27:04,667
- It's good you're going home.

1846
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:07,250
(gentle music)

1847
01:27:31,794 --> 01:27:34,544
(dramatic music)

1848
01:27:46,507 --> 01:27:48,674
(sobbing)

1849
01:27:50,796 --> 01:27:52,963
(sighing)

1850
01:28:08,204 --> 01:28:11,204
(utensils scraping)

1851
01:28:23,963 --> 01:28:26,630
(Lacey sighing)

1852
01:28:29,196 --> 01:28:31,213
- You have to let me do my job, Harv.

1853
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:36,703
You have to respect that I follow the law,

1854
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:40,220
whether that's gonna mean
that a person is executed

1855
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:44,000
or a rotten cop gets exposed or--

1856
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,293
- Honey, I do.

1857
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,830
I do, sweetheart.

1858
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,420
There's never been anybody
I respect like you.

1859
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:00,860
- The kid in her room?
- Mm-hmm.

1860
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,420
Sophia called, invited her for pancakes.

1861
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,990
She turned it down without even asking.

1862
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:09,853
She's doing her own version of
self-imposed exile, I guess.

1863
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,020
I went way overboard, huh?

1864
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:15,943
- No, not really.

1865
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:20,430
What freaked her was having
caused a big fight between us.

1866
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,093
- Well.

1867
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:29,376
Do you wanna invite her
in to see us makeup?

1868
01:29:29,376 --> 01:29:31,959
- (laughs) No.

1869
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:34,883
- I take it back.

1870
01:29:36,067 --> 01:29:39,023
(giggling)

1871
01:29:39,023 --> 01:29:40,473
(horns honking)

1872
01:29:40,473 --> 01:29:42,200
(engines revving)

1873
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,170
- Mrs. Saigon, on the morning of June 4th,

1874
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:47,540
you were waiting for the number 94 bus.

1875
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:50,040
What attracted your attention
about the young man?

1876
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,493
- He was watching the guy
taking in the vegetables.

1877
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,383
I saw him watching.

1878
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:01,760
- [Doug] And is that young
man in the courtroom today?

1879
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,354
- Yes, sir.

1880
01:30:03,354 --> 01:30:05,673
- [Doug] Would you
identify him for us please?

1881
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:11,820
- He's the boy at the
table in the gray suit.

1882
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,370
- [Doug] For the record,

1883
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:16,477
the witness has identified Raymond Bolzer.

1884
01:30:21,138 --> 01:30:22,898
(telephones ringing in offices)

1885
01:30:22,898 --> 01:30:24,790
(people chatting)

1886
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:25,930
- [Mary Beth] Package for you.

1887
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:26,763
- Oh.

1888
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:28,613
So what do you think?

1889
01:30:28,613 --> 01:30:30,320
I saw you watching the jury.

1890
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,720
- I think, Mr. Trayne
is not giving an inch.

1891
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,270
I'm impressed.

1892
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:35,993
What do you think?

1893
01:30:35,993 --> 01:30:37,233
Ooh, what's that?

1894
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:39,543
- It's a camera.

1895
01:30:41,384 --> 01:30:42,217
A gift.

1896
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,800
- There's a picture too.

1897
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,190
- Yeah, of a building.

1898
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:49,980
- No, it's of you.

1899
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:50,813
It's a good one.

1900
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,360
- He never took a picture of me.

1901
01:30:56,001 --> 01:30:57,370
(laughs)

1902
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:58,423
I see you.

1903
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:01,903
It's this damn camera.

1904
01:31:03,099 --> 01:31:05,010
(laughs)

1905
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:08,343
(tissue paper rustling)

1906
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:17,881
(gentle music)

1907
01:31:17,881 --> 01:31:20,307
Can I read this to you?

1908
01:31:20,307 --> 01:31:21,140
- Go head.

1909
01:31:23,237 --> 01:31:25,377
- "This gift does not compare

1910
01:31:25,377 --> 01:31:26,923
"with the gift you gave me.

1911
01:31:29,715 --> 01:31:30,548
"Matt."

1912
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:35,188
- Matt.

1913
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:40,527
- Matt.

1914
01:31:52,254 --> 01:31:54,837
(gentle music)

1915
01:32:37,506 --> 01:32:40,089
(bright music)

1916
01:32:43,912 --> 01:32:46,745
(Multicom Jingle)
