1
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,930
We all grow up looking for

2
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,932
somebody to believe in.

3
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,851
For me it was my father.

4
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:26,939
He was my hero.

5
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,610
The day after my 12th birthday I found out

6
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:35,405
my father killed people for a living.

7
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:39,451
He was a made member of the Mafia.

8
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,418
When I saw my father shot dead
outside of our house

9
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,420
I remember thinking

10
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,466
he probably deserved it.

11
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,593
And years later, when I got the chance,

12
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,220
I joined the marines

13
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,515
looking for something new
to believe in.

14
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,184
That lasted until February of 1991.

15
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,311
Just outside Kuwait City

16
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,898
and the Iraqi border.

17
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,944
Fuck!

18
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,454
Let me guess - you're from the government

19
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,498
and here to help me.

20
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,293
Get on your feet, tough guy.

21
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,339
I tell you, you're a helluva good marine.

22
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,927
Commendations, medals...

23
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,931
Made sergeant 26 months ago.

24
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,227
Pretty good.

25
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,229
And then you assault an MP

26
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,231
and you steal the colonel's jeep.

27
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,860
Why?

28
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,695
The colonel is a prick.

29
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,865
Something like yourself.

30
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,992
Tough guy, ain't he?

31
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,994
Smart, too.

32
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,038
Like your friends.

33
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,040
Friends? What friends are those?

34
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,086
Alright, let's see what you're looking at here.

35
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,005
Bad conduct discharge,

36
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,508
forfeiture of all paid allowances,

37
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,554
confinement, 2 to 3 years
at hard labor.

38
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,600
You've really put yourself up the creek,
old buddy.

39
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,271
Maybe I've got a paddle for ya.

40
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,647
Wanna hear more?

41
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,693
Not particularly.

42
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,738
You know this guy,
Manny Matello?

43
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,117
Hey, Rocco,
make me a Cosmopolitan.

44
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,160
Manny Matello was the
mafia boss

45
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,162
my father and my uncle Joe
had worked for.

46
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,500
I swear on Saint
fucking Anthony

47
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,169
if you put too much cranberry juice

48
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,795
in it this time,

49
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,090
I'm gonna kill your whole
fucking family.

50
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:44,136
You hear me?

51
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,308
Hey, Rocco?

52
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,353
Tell me, am I gonna
be lucky tonight?

53
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,000
The shooters were a couple of zips

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,960
working for a guy named
Luciano Reggio.

55
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,385
Now Reggio is a major
drug trafficker.

56
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,429
He's also liaison between
the Gambinos in New York

57
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,431
and the Sicilian mob.

58
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,142
In fact, New York sent Reggio down

59
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,144
to whack Manny Matello.

60
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,022
Take over the family.

61
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,316
Imagine that, huh?

62
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,362
A goddamn immigrant
running the old neighbourhood.

63
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:47,449
Do you remember a guy
named Willy Dolan?

64
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,787
Used to run a little book
for Manny Matello.

65
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,456
Sure, I knew Willy.

66
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,416
We grew up together.

67
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,001
Nice guy.

68
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:02,047
Just looking to buy a house
for his wife and kid.

69
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,716
87 thousand.

70
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,762
The market's changed.
The price is a 100 now.

71
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,806
It took me six months to put
87 grand together.

72
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,975
Now you want a hundred?

73
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,811
You tell me you're gonna
sell me a house for 87 grand,

74
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,229
now you want a hundred.
What's with the quibbling,

75
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,605
Junior? Why are
we quibbling?

76
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,651
Price is a hundred grand.
No quibble.

77
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,863
You know what? You're a fucking

78
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,865
pain in the ass to do business with,
you one-legged motherfucker.

79
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,954
- One-legged?
- I'm taking my money and going home.

80
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,131
You've got a problem with
my leg now, huh?

81
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,510
You don't even know how much money
I'm saving you out of mortgage.

82
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:52,556
That's how fucking stupid you are.

83
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,189
How do you like my leg now?

84
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,482
Tryin to chisel me, huh?

85
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,361
Stealing money out of my pocket?

86
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:10,449
Like the cocksucker you are!
That's right - I fucking spit on you!

87
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,463
Fucking piece of shit.

88
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,717
What's this, Willy?

89
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,763
What's this?

90
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:38,352
You motherfucker.

91
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,155
Willy was working for us.

92
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,199
And we're gonna miss Willy.

93
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,867
We had some things
that we were working on

94
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,955
and there are things we gotta
keep working on.

95
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,416
Which is why we're talking
to you,

96
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,293
tough guy.

97
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,337
Now you wanna be
a good citizen

98
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,339
and help us out here?

99
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,633
Hey, you wanna let me
out of here?

100
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,759
I'd like to get back to my cell.

101
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,886
Please.

102
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,930
Ok, so you don't care about
truth, justice

103
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,932
and the American way.

104
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:21,353
What about Joey Marcucci?

105
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,400
Care about him?

106
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,403
He's family, isn't he?

107
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,448
Yeah, he's my cousin.

108
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,994
Another ignorant dirtbag.

109
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:41,039
But we can't choose our
family, can we?

110
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,293
What exactly do you want me to do?

111
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,087
I don't want you to do anything for me.

112
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,131
But I'm gonna give you a chance
to do something

113
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,133
for your cousin Joey,
the dirtbag.

114
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,388
Because Joey doesn't like the idea

115
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,184
this guy taking over the family business.

116
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,187
I mean, sooner or later
these guys will kill each other,

117
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,190
they are gonna sit down and
make some kind of a deal.

118
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:10,235
Well I want you to be there,
because I want Reggio.

119
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,781
Do you understand me,
tough guy?

120
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,910
I want Reggio.

121
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,955
You give me Reggio,

122
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:26,126
I give you your cousin Joey.

123
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,901
I vowed a long time ago

124
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:54,488
I was never gonna become
what my father was.

125
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,116
Now I was going home to
become something he was.

126
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,793
My mother died giving birth
to my brother Vincent.

127
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,837
After my father was killed,
me and Vincent

128
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,839
went to live with my uncle Joe,

129
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,259
my aunt Tina and my cousin Joey.

130
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,720
Me, Vincent and Joey, we
were more than cousins.

131
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,015
We were brothers.

132
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,519
- Your father got killed?
- Don't make a big deal of it.

133
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,062
Vincent, slow down.
Even if it doesn't make you taller,

134
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,605
it makes you fat.

135
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,608
Go fuck your hand.

136
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,654
Look at Joey.

137
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,156
How's the steamfitters?

138
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,616
It's great, man.

139
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,660
My back hurts all the time,
throbbing.

140
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,662
My legs feel like somebody
beat them with a hammer.

141
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,499
Remind me to thank you
in like a hundred years.

142
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,501
You ain't 10th and Wolf,
where you're from?

143
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:53,109
I'm a friend of Ricky's.
You know Ricky?

144
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,610
Ricky Jerk-Off?

145
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,552
That's what we call him round here,
Ricky Jerk-Off.

146
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,095
You know why?

147
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:03,015
- Why?
- Well cuz he's a jerk-off.

148
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,017
Go get us a pack of
smokes, will ya?

149
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,685
What am I, your bitch?

150
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,312
I'm buying.

151
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,106
Watch my purse.

152
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,109
Let me tell you something
about Ricky Jerk-Off.

153
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,445
Hey, Marcucci,
you're talking to my girl.

154
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,155
I ain't your girl.
I just met ya.

155
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,823
Shut your face.

156
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:20,908
Hi, Ricky Jerk-Off,
what's going on?

157
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,951
Tommy, this is between me

158
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,953
and your prick-face cousin over here.

159
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,085
Is this a jerk-off convention?

160
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,131
Fuck you, Marcucci.

161
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:10,541
Tommy, I'm coming!

162
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,211
Let go of me!

163
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,796
Come on, Vincent!

164
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:19,842
Get off me.

165
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,317
Tommy, you're making a
mess over here.

166
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,153
We're gonna have to pay
for all that stuff we broke.

167
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,865
How much do you think three
tables and a booth cost?

168
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:46,201
Shit, I broke my chain,
I lost my St. Chris.

169
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,120
You sent me for the cigarettes
on purpose, didn't you?

170
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,247
- Shut up.
- That ain't right.

171
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,082
You don't think I'm tough?

172
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,419
- Come on, me and you. Right now.
- Shut up, Vince.

173
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,713
Come on, Joey. Tell him I can
kick his fucking ass.

174
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,008
Not in your wildest dreams, Vincent.

175
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,011
How's my eye?

176
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:06,281
Let me see.

177
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:11,168
Fucking yin and yang douchebags.

178
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,377
It's Manny.

179
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,712
Joey, come here.

180
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:42,758
Manny!

181
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,597
- What do you think he wants?
- Shut up.

182
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,225
Listen to me, son.

183
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:55,187
It's your father, Joey.
He's gone.

184
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:59,107
Uncle Joe was killed the same way
my father was.

185
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:03,153
Left for dead like an animal
in the street.

186
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:09,660
Tommy, get yourself cleaned up.
Go home and take your brother.

187
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:14,164
Your aunt's gonna need ya.

188
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:18,252
Now go on. Good boys.

189
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:51,159
We're all gonna miss him.

190
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,287
He was a good husband.

191
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,205
A good friend.

192
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,708
Thank you for everything, Manny.

193
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,753
Thank you.

194
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,218
Aunt Tina, is Joey home?

195
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,221
What the hell do you think you're looking at?!
Ain't you got no decency?!

196
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,205
Toilet's busted. Take a walk.

197
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,623
Move, I've gotta pee.

198
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,625
Get outta here before I kick
the shit out of you.

199
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,918
Yeah, you and what army?

200
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,711
Back in, I'll knock your teeth
down your throat.

201
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:46,757
Loser!

202
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:50,219
Okay.

203
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,347
You wanna know

204
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,558
or you don't wanna know?

205
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:59,186
You're old enough to decide.

206
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:03,232
You either deal with these things
or you don't.

207
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,027
I wanna know.

208
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,031
You're your father's son.

209
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:16,119
His blood.

210
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:20,165
It's not my place,

211
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,503
unless you give it up.

212
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,798
So,

213
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,844
tell me what to do.

214
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:50,445
Why is he giving him that newspaper?

215
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,498
Oh, is he gonna let him
read the obituary?

216
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,166
How are you holding up?

217
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,254
Okay, I guess.

218
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:13,594
Poor Joey.

219
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,762
- You guys should go home.
- We're not leaving you, Joey.

220
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,472
- Go home.
- I wanna talk about this.

221
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,558
Can we talk about this, please?

222
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,314
He killed my father, Tommy.

223
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,900
What do you want me to do?
You want me to go to the cops?

224
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,902
Ask him to say he's sorry?

225
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,987
All we know is what Manny told us.

226
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,281
Maybe Manny's wrong.
I'm not saying that he is.

227
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,657
But you do this right now, you'll
kill somebody

228
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,950
you're gonna live with that
for the rest of your life.

229
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,661
What, do you think
Manny got it wrong?

230
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:43,749
You know something I don't?

231
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:48,128
Go home.

232
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,714
Benedetto?

233
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:54,760
Joey, what...?

234
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:01,558
Joey!

235
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:12,736
Tommy?

236
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,419
Oh, God.

237
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,547
He's bleeding pretty bad, Joey.

238
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,757
What are we gonna do?
I don't want him to die.

239
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,926
He's not gonna die, Vincent.

240
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,720
Oh, God.

241
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,056
Look Vincent, I need you to do
something for me, alright?

242
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,100
I'm gonna get him to the hospital,
but I need you to do something.

243
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,227
What am I saying to you, Vincent?

244
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,562
Listen to me! What did I say?

245
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,605
- I gotta do something.
- I need you to get rid of the gun.

246
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,775
Break it up into little pieces,
throw it in the river

247
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,944
and dump the car, alright Vincent?

248
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,823
What did I just say?

249
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,450
Break it into pieces
and throw it in the river.

250
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:04,496
And dump the car, Vincent.

251
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,124
Vincent, I need you to get it together.

252
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,418
I can't, I'm sorry, Joey...

253
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,504
Come on, Tommy.
Joey, don't let him die!

254
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:16,550
He's not gonna die, Vincent!

255
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,013
Look at me!

256
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,016
Tommy,I'm not... Look at me!
I'm not going anywhere. Alright?

257
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,184
I'm right here.

258
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:29,229
Don't leave me, Joey.

259
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:34,151
Stay awake.

260
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,320
No, no!
Don't leave me, Joey!

261
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,613
I'm right here, Tommy!

262
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,656
Don't you let him die!

263
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,658
We have this. Please.

264
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:46,955
Don't you let him die!
Tommy, I'm right here!

265
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,920
It had been years since
I've been on that corner.

266
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,548
But as the bus pulled away,

267
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:41,635
I'd felt like i never left.

268
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,651
Horvath and Thornton would have
given me the money

269
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,653
to live anywhere.

270
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,948
But I went home,
to aunt Tina's.

271
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:07,035
I was worried about Vincent.

272
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:43,155
Come here.

273
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,454
You know Joey don't live here no more.

274
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,916
He's got a condo over on Market.

275
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:57,961
- Where are they now?
- Probably at the club.

276
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:06,261
Vincent's the manager.

277
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:11,850
Vincent's working for Joey?

278
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:15,896
What happened to steamfitters?

279
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,314
He quit.

280
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,608
Didn't he tell you?

281
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,110
When did he do that?

282
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:26,156
About a year ago.

283
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,503
You like my new shoes?

284
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:43,006
Vincent got them for me.

285
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:47,052
He's a good boy, that Vincent.

286
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:51,849
I'm so glad you're home, Tommy.

287
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:56,436
We need you around here.

288
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:07,030
...Stinger missiles, C4,
RPG's, everything.

289
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,282
What's an RPG?

290
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,117
Are you a complete fucking nitwit?

291
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,202
I just told you 3 minutes
ago what an RPG is.

292
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,496
- I forgot.
- Rocket propelled grenade.

293
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:18,542
RPG - tattoo it on your
fucking forehead.

294
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,717
- Hi, Joey.
- Hi, Brandy. How you're doing?

295
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:30,762
- You've got a minute for me?
- Yeah, absolutely. Come in.

296
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:41,440
I'm telling you, this guy is like a
fucking weapon supermarket.

297
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,694
Can I stab you?

298
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:49,740
Cops found Willy's car
down by the river.

299
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:51,158
Yeah? What did they say?

300
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,826
Nothing.

301
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:56,830
They asked me if I knew anything
and they gave me back the car.

302
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,708
- Have a drink.
- I'm good.

303
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,754
Have a drink.

304
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,801
I need to know, Joey.

305
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,803
I need to know if Willy's dead.
I'm not gonna do anything.

306
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,847
I'm not gonna go crazy,
I just need to know

307
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,849
so that I can move on.

308
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:24,066
What makes you think I
know anything, Brandy?

309
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,779
Don't fuck with me, Joey.

310
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,866
You know I've got
the kid to think of.

311
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:41,458
Joey, for three weeks
it's like I'm living in mud.

312
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,753
I can't do anything,

313
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,755
I can't get out of bed
in the morning.

314
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,844
I know you for a long time,

315
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,265
and you need to
understand something.

316
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,267
Whatever I tell you,
I would only be guessing.

317
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:04,731
Ok. He's dead?

318
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:22,666
Why?

319
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,754
Why would somebody do that?
What did he do?

320
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:31,008
I don't know.

321
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,551
Ok, I want whoever did it

322
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,094
dead or in jail.

323
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,263
I want their kids to be
without their father.

324
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,473
I wanna know who did it.

325
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:39,683
I can't help you there, Brandy.

326
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,727
Fine, I'll find out
by myself.

327
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,813
- Settle down.
- Fuck you! Settle down.

328
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:47,316
Okay, fine.
Go. Go.

329
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,609
But where?

330
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:49,902
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna go to the cops?

331
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:53,197
When was the last time they helped
anybody from 10th and Wolf?

332
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,199
So you can't do that,
so what - you're gonna

333
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,117
go after whoever done
this yourself?

334
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,161
Then you die and your
kid ends up

335
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,163
in some foster home.

336
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:05,542
You want that?

337
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,755
I've got a seven year old kid
I can't feed no more.

338
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:13,842
What am I gonna do?

339
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:38,659
It's alright.

340
00:27:58,255 --> 00:27:59,255
You want a job?

341
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,808
What?

342
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,854
A job. You want a job?

343
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,691
I'm not much of a dancer.

344
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,360
You think I'd put you up
on one of those stages?

345
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,488
No, we're looking for a bartender.

346
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,490
I don't know how to
bartend either.

347
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,659
Well good. That means you
don't know how to steal yet.

348
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,202
Vincent, come here.

349
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,371
Meet me in the back.

350
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,206
Brandy is your new bartender.

351
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:29,209
Stupid me. I didn't even
know I needed one.

352
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,211
- How you've beenBrandy?
- Good, Vin. Thanks.

353
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:35,257
Give her the good shifts and
give her a grand up front.

354
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,594
- Okay?
- Yeah.

355
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,596
And forget about that other
stuff that we talked about.

356
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,098
That way nobody wins.

357
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,767
I gotta get this.

358
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:47,144
Yeah, hallo?

359
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:51,231
Am I speaking with
Joseph Marcucci?

360
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,358
Yeah, you got him.
Who is this?

361
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:57,446
The Joseph Marcucci who resides
at The Dorchester, 226 Market Square?

362
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:00,616
Who is this?

363
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:04,661
My name is Simon Liebowitz, sir, and
I work for the Board of Health.

364
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,415
The Board of Health?
Who is this?

365
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:11,251
Simon Liebowitz.

366
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:14,296
Yeah, I heard you the first time.
What the fuck do you want?

367
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:16,590
There's no need to be
rude, Mr. Marcucci.

368
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,259
Tell me about the rats.

369
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:20,886
Rats?

370
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:23,514
Okay, you don't know
about the rats.

371
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:27,017
You couldn't have missed them.

372
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,310
What fucking rats?

373
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:30,812
The condominium where you
reside has been quarantined

374
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,648
due to an outbreak of rats.

375
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:33,690
- Rats?
- Yes.

376
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,609
Yes. Big, fat, stinky rats

377
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,277
concentrated in your
bedroom area.

378
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,821
You need to be more careful who
you sleep with, Mr. Marcucci.

379
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:40,948
Who the fuck is this?

380
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:45,035
Leibowitz!
Simon Leibowitz!

381
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,041
Vincent, get out here!

382
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,043
We've got a big,
fat, fucking rat.

383
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:04,221
He still has this jacket.

384
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:08,267
Come here.

385
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:13,146
They told us we were going in there

386
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,940
to get a monster

387
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,608
who has killed thousands
of his own people.

388
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,610
And just before we
got the son of a bitch...

389
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:21,405
- They make a deal?
- They make a deal.

390
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,573
Jesus.

391
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:25,200
They lied to us and people died.

392
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,369
A lot of their guys and some of ours.

393
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,746
Some of my buddies.

394
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,790
So I got drunk that night

395
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,917
and beat the shit out of an MP

396
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,544
and I stole the colonel's jeep

397
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,212
and I went after Saddam myself.

398
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:38,881
Get out of here.

399
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:40,549
I swear to God.

400
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,634
And I'd have got him too,

401
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,636
If I didn't drive 30 miles
in the wrong direction.

402
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:52,728
Jeep ran out of gas just
outside Kuwait City.

403
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:56,481
That's my Tommy right there.

404
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:59,860
For friends and family.

405
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:03,947
It's good to see you, Tommy.

406
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:09,661
I just got the call.
Who's this?

407
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,872
It's my brother Tommy.

408
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:12,998
How you're doing?

409
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,999
Army guy.

410
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,168
Actually it's the marines.
There's a little bit of difference.

411
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,003
One is pussies,
one is not.

412
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,172
Hey, give us a minute, will you?

413
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,883
What you gotta be a jerk for?
Who called?

414
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,259
Rocco.

415
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:28,347
They want to arrange a meet.

416
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,641
Why don't I save us
both a little time

417
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:32,518
and I can tell you to go fuck yourself...

418
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,144
Reggio, Joey.
They wanna meet.

419
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:38,232
Rocco is the one who set Manny up.

420
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,068
Hey, I think we should meet.

421
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,194
Well...

422
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:46,240
Hold up, guys.

423
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,662
Stay there, Rocco.

424
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:55,749
- Did you invite them in here?
- A talk, Joey. A talk.

425
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,003
Who's the grease ball ?

426
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,089
That's Reggio's nephew.
Take it easy.

427
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,217
Fuck these ginzo motherfuckers.

428
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,219
Tell your uncle I refuse to talk

429
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:11,265
with any grease ball,
moustached, foreign motherfucker.

430
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,226
Do you want me to say it again?
I'll say it again.

431
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,521
Rocco?
Let me ask you something.

432
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:20,816
How does it feel to betray
a life-long friend?

433
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:23,610
I mean, how does your life
like fucking the Judas?

434
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,696
I'm just wondering.

435
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,739
Tell your uncle:

436
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,741
I see him, I put a knife in his kidney.

437
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,911
Drop by anytime, guys.

438
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,204
Monday scumbag nights.

439
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:35,622
Drinks are half price.

440
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:38,750
Bring a friend, you know?

441
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:41,587
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?

442
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:45,632
They were ready to share, you asshole.

443
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,178
We can make a lot of money with Reggio.

444
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:51,054
You better get off your
high fucking horse

445
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,848
because if there's an all-out war

446
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:56,935
here's a bulletin - they win.

447
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:01,648
They're looking to play this thing smart.
Why don't we?

448
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:05,694
I wish there was something I didn't know.

449
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:09,740
You're a fucking asshole,
you know that?

450
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,554
- Hello?
- It's me. Give me Horvath.

451
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:55,369
What?

452
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,412
You dangled Joey
out there to hook me

453
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,456
but you helped Vincent
back in case you needed

454
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,458
to twist the screws, didn't you?

455
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,711
Everybody needs a whole card.

456
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,004
I can't do this.

457
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,172
- I want out.
- Nah.

458
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:08,382
It's too late for that.

459
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:09,508
No, I want out.
I can't do this.

460
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,093
- Deal's off.
- Hold on.

461
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:15,138
Deal's off.

462
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,724
Hold on a second.

463
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:21,728
I just want you to listen
to something, alright?

464
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,607
"- Is it 500? How's 500?
- It's un-negotiable."

465
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,693
"Come on Vincent, I can't. I can't."

466
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,194
"Thousand a week, Sid."

467
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:33,240
"That's the number Joey gave you,
that's what you gotta pay."

468
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:37,661
"Otherwise I'll come back with a
hammer and drive nails in your head."

469
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:40,122
"And plus we gotta
wreck the joint, too."

470
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,250
Alright, that's enough.

471
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,794
It's called extortion.

472
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:48,964
And your little brother Vincent
is in it up to his eyeballs

473
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:51,508
thanks to your cousin Joey.

474
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,177
Family.

475
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,053
I don't give a damn
about those cheap thugs.

476
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:59,141
I want Reggio.

477
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,104
If I'm gonna get him,
I need it on tape.

478
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:06,773
You gotta wear a wire.

479
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:08,984
Wire?

480
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,819
You didn't say anything
about wearing a wire.

481
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:11,904
I'm saying it now!

482
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:14,489
You're gonna wear a wire.

483
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:18,118
Look, you'd better straighten
out your loyalties, tough guy.

484
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,120
Who's it gonna be?

485
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:24,166
Reggio or your brother Vincent?

486
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:28,128
I want a guarantee Vincent walks

487
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,005
and you go easy on Joey.

488
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:33,800
Your guarantee is my word.

489
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:37,846
We're going to lunch.

490
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,061
Joey has to meet Reggio

491
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,063
and you gotta get yourself in there.

492
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:50,859
Wear the wire, and we'll
stick to our end of the bargain.

493
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,254
We know Reggio is setting up a heroin pipeline
coming from the Golden Triangle through Sicily.

494
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:14,424
We need to know how it's arriving and how the distribution is.

495
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,051
That's a microrecorder.

496
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:18,095
You tape it underneath your privates.

497
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:20,597
Chances are they search
you - they won't look there.

498
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,267
Just make sure your
dick faces whoever is talking

499
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,354
and do everything you can
to keep them out of areas with noise.

500
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:47,165
Yeah.

501
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:48,709
What's with the door locked?

502
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,754
Some marine thing or something?

503
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,756
I was taking a nap.

504
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,844
Dinner's over.

505
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:07,644
What's going on with her and Joey?

506
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,605
He don't come by, he don't call.

507
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:17,571
Her and Manny was like 
a whole two years

508
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:19,198
after uncle Joey died.

509
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,993
I take care of her, make sure she's 
got enough money and all of that.

510
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,786
You wanna hear something?

511
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:28,832
I've got around 128,216 dollars in the bank.

512
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,837
You picked the right time to come home.

513
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:38,800
What?

514
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,094
How long have you been working for Joey?

515
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,263
I don't wanna hear...

516
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:45,390
- You could have wrote me.
- Tommy, I don't wanna hear it.

517
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,830
It's everything we said 
we didn't want, Vincent.

518
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,331
No, it's everything YOU said.

519
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:50,312
And then you said goodbye and 
ran off to join the marines.

520
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:53,315
- What did you fucking do, Tommy?
- Hey, watch your mouth.

521
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,317
Let me bust my ass 8 hours a day

522
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:57,319
for a lousy 300 dollars a week.

523
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:59,321
Sorry Tommy, no can do.

524
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:00,447
You're in over your head.

525
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:04,535
- Stop it!
- You stop it!

526
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:08,705
Yeah.

527
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:09,998
What? Now?

528
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,792
Tell them you're eating now.

529
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:15,838
I'm eating now.

530
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:25,264
I gotta go.

531
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:26,473
Alright, I'll go with you.

532
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:28,684
I'm not a fucking baby!

533
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:32,729
He didn't even call for you.

534
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:36,859
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to curse.

535
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:42,322
Will you save me a plate?

536
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:46,159
I'll be back later.

537
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:50,247
Smile, please.

538
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:52,226
Tommy, I'm sorry.

539
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,061
Get those puppies shiny.

540
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:17,149
Junior has a thing about clean glasses.

541
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:18,609
Who's Junior?

542
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,693
He owns the drive with Joey

543
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:23,488
stay as far the fuck away from him 
as humanly fucking possible.

544
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,365
Say I said that and I'll call you a liar,

545
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,159
make sure your ass is canned.

546
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:29,870
Yeah, I've got it asshole!

547
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:33,957
Give me a Crown Royal on the rocks.

548
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,588
Vincent's brother Tommy, right?

549
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,714
Yeah.

550
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:42,216
Army?

551
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:43,509
The marines.

552
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,511
Brandy Brenner.

553
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:49,556
You and me and Joey were in the 
7th and 8th grade together at Sacred Heart.

554
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:55,062
Yeah. How's it going?

555
00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:56,063
Wow. You're really a bad liar...

556
00:39:56,664 --> 00:39:59,064
- Is that right?
- Big time.

557
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:09,952
Sorry?

558
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:14,039
- Rock'n'roll. You're new here?
- Yeah.

559
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,416
It's a shot of rockin' rye

560
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:20,462
and a bottle of rolling rock.
Rock and Roll.

561
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:24,716
Yeah.

562
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:28,303
Learn something new every day, huh?

563
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:32,349
Hey that's a nice haircut.
Where did you get it, the army?

564
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:36,353
Marines.

565
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:40,440
Well Semper Fi, motherfucker.

566
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:45,153
Hey, Semper Fi.
Always faithful.

567
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:50,367
Yeah, that's what it means.

568
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:57,457
Semper fucking Fi!

569
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,712
9.50 for the drinks.

570
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:04,214
Are you gonna jump up on the pole?

571
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,384
Bartenders don't dance.

572
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,387
Are you gonna show me your tits?

573
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:11,388
It's 9.50.

574
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,892
I'm sorry, maybe one of 
us is in the wrong place.

575
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,894
Hey, buddy.

576
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:20,939
What's the problem?

577
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:25,027
You got any medals?

578
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:29,031
- Hey.
- It's alright.

579
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:39,458
Let me ask you something.

580
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,920
We send our boys over there,

581
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,506
they kill a bunch of Arabs

582
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,174
that don't mean anything to us

583
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,259
and then we pick up and leave

584
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:51,261
before we take out the 
scumbag we went in there for.

585
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:55,766
- Now what's that about?
- I don't know.

586
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,311
Like a thief in the night

587
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:03,106
they take away our heart and our soul.

588
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:06,527
We give them the best that we've got.

589
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:10,531
My kids are dead,
and Saddam is still alive.

590
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,119
I don't...

591
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:20,165
understand...

592
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:38,642
Yeah, yeah.

593
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:57,452
I was just kidding about the dancing.

594
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:59,162
You're new, so

595
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,498
I just tried to make you feel at home.

596
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:05,544
Keep the change.

597
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:08,797
I've got to talk to you for two minutes. 
You got it?

598
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,466
- Can i kill ya?
- Very funny.

599
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,677
You're a very, very funny guy.

600
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,805
Listen, listen...

601
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:18,891
Listen to me.
What's your Sunday look like?

602
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:19,892
What? After church?

603
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:23,061
I've got a guy who wants to sell us a tank.

604
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:24,605
- A what?
- A tank.

605
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:26,023
- A tank?
- Yeah, big fucking tank.

606
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:28,025
I don't think so, Jimmy.

607
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:29,359
Where will we park it?

608
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:30,986
- I don't know. Behind the club?
- No, I don't think so.

609
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:32,613
Thanks for thinking 
about things, though.

610
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:35,616
It's a good idea, no? Joe?

611
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:39,661
Hey, how you're doing?

612
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,581
You see those titties?

613
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:46,210
I paid for those titties.

614
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,712
Do you know how much doe 
that brings in for me?

615
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,507
- You paid for those titties?
- Yeah.

616
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:54,009
Three times over.

617
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:55,677
I'm thinking we should 
take this meeting, Joey.

618
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:58,013
We can't take on the 
whole fucking Mafia.

619
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,681
What Mafia?

620
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:01,850
Vincent, the mafia in this city is gone.

621
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,685
They're all dead or in jail.

622
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:04,853
Do you know what elmatta means?

623
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:08,190
It means "How much 
time do I get off my sentence?"

624
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,609
Get out of here!

625
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:14,655
Take care of that.
Get off the stage!

626
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,495
Jesus fucking Christ, Jimmy!

627
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,914
How many times have I gotta tell ya?
No beating up the customers.

628
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:27,960
- I ain't doing nothing.
- He's crazy.

629
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:32,840
Should've left him out of it, Joey.

630
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:36,176
I don't speak for Vincent.

631
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,554
You let me down, Joey.

632
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:42,391
I let you down?

633
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:44,518
Well I guess it's not the first time.

634
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,145
Did you tell me to go home that night?

635
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:48,814
Did you tell me to go home?

636
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:52,860
You didn't shoot me, Joey.
You saved me.

637
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:59,741
You still left.

638
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:07,541
So, we're taking the meeting,

639
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,709
or commiting suicide?

640
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,878
Would you shut up?

641
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:13,005
No, Vincent, I mean really...

642
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:16,008
You should take the meeting.

643
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:18,302
Really? Why is that?

644
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:21,096
What's this Reggio need from you?

645
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:23,098
They need me to keep quiet.

646
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,892
After they killed Manny,
they thought the transition

647
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:27,186
would go smooth, but 
they didn't bank on us.

648
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:30,314
They didn't bank on me.
This ain't Palermo, this is my city.

649
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:33,650
They can't afford a war,
but this is what they'll get, Tommy.

650
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:36,612
It's stupid.

651
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:38,197
Stupid.

652
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,823
You know what they need.

653
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:41,617
That's a good piece of intelligence.

654
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:43,619
But it's only worth 
what you make of it.

655
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,953
You let them think they're using you,

656
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:46,663
you get next to Reggio,
you be a good soldier,

657
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:49,124
when the time is right you 
cut the head off. No war.

658
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,709
Nobody dies for Reggio.

659
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,711
That's what I've been 
trying to tell him the whole time.

660
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,796
Yeah, but you couldn't because you 
didn't graduate from 5th grade.

661
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,215
Shut up.

662
00:45:56,256 --> 00:46:00,052
I was busting your balls.

663
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:30,791
You know, I know you love 
him more than me.

664
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:31,792
What is that? Don't say that.

665
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:35,504
No, I know that.

666
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:38,799
If you were in a dark alley,

667
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:42,803
you'd rather have him there, not me.

668
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:46,306
It's alright.

669
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:50,352
There's nothing I can do about it.

670
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:54,648
I just want you all to know

671
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:58,735
that the world could crumble

672
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:01,780
and I would die

673
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:05,868
trying to be in that alley with you all.

674
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,915
You're drunk, Vincent.

675
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:15,961
Maybe I'm a little drunk.

676
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:19,006
I'm still here

677
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:23,051
waiting to be in that alley.

678
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:28,724
I'm sorry.

679
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:31,518
God, you're beautiful.

680
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,146
I'm sorry, you've got to excuse me,

681
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:36,815
I've got to take a piss.

682
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:40,861
I'm sorry - a leak.

683
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:48,785
Tell him I said

684
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:52,831
thanks for everything.

685
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:54,249
You're welcome.

686
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,084
Could you get me another drink?

687
00:47:56,168 --> 00:48:00,130
She's off duty.
Drink mine.

688
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:06,762
I'll see you tomorrow.

689
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:15,896
She's a good looking girl.

690
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:19,942
Yeah, she's a good looking girl.

691
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:34,456
I'm Junior, who are you?

692
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,502
I'm Brandy, I started tonight.

693
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:40,420
Dancing?

694
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:44,007
Bartending.

695
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:46,009
It's a nice car. Is this yours?

696
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:48,178
Yeah.

697
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:52,266
It's in my spot.

698
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:54,059
Sorry.

699
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:57,396
You're parking in the back 
with the rest of the girls.

700
00:48:57,437 --> 00:49:01,441
- Got me?
- Yeah.

701
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:11,952
You're a real fucking 
looker, you know that?

702
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:16,999
What brought you here, Brandy?

703
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,044
I'm a friend of Joey's.

704
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:27,759
I'm gonna try parking in the back next time.

705
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:35,976
Brandy, could you do me a favor?

706
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:39,104
Tommy doesn't have a car. I was wondering 
if you can give him a ride down to the diner?

707
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:42,191
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.
- Thanks.

708
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:44,193
- See you down there.
- Are you coming?

709
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:48,238
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

710
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:02,252
- She's okay.
- Yeah, that's what you said about Willy.

711
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:06,423
Willy's okay.

712
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:07,549
Turns out Willy was a rat.

713
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:09,009
Forgive me if I question your judgement.

714
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:12,596
Yeah, but you didn't know he 
was a rat until after you killed him.

715
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:15,599
That somehow makes a difference?

716
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,768
How do you know she's not a rat too 
like her scumbag husband?

717
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:21,855
You go near her, I'll cut off 
your other leg, Junior.

718
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:28,111
How are we doing, Junior?

719
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:32,157
- We're doing great, Joe.
- Good.

720
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,703
It's bad enough I made 
the poor girl a widow,

721
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:40,749
I don't want to make 
the kid an orphan too.

722
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:44,419
Yeah.

723
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:48,465
So how long is cousin Tom here for?

724
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:52,177
Tommy's okay.

725
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:54,221
Is there anybody 
around here not okay?

726
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:58,225
That's what I'd like to know.

727
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:02,229
Just stay away from Brandy.

728
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:13,323
Thanks.

729
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:14,908
Are you hungry?

730
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,577
No, I gotta get home to my kid.

731
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,955
My neighbor's watching him.

732
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:24,042
Out to the left, three seats back.

733
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:27,087
Where you sat in the 8th grade.

734
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:31,133
Used to piss me off because 
you sat by the window, and I didn't.

735
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:35,554
You should know how cold it was 
by the window in the winter.

736
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,608
What did you say to that guy?

737
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:49,776
The guy in the bar.

738
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,819
I told him the best thing

739
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:51,820
a marine could hope for

740
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,822
is to die for his buddies.

741
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:56,450
That's probably what happened to his son.

742
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:57,659
Is that true?

743
00:51:57,743 --> 00:52:00,704
That's what they told us.

744
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:03,498
How was it over there in Kuwait?

745
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,168
It was hot and sandy.

746
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,878
It's the desert, right?

747
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:11,965
Who knew.

748
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:14,051
I saw the three of you in there

749
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:15,594
the night Joey's father was killed.

750
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:17,888
You and Vincent and Joey.

751
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:20,015
It was a fight.

752
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,600
You looked like the three musketeers.

753
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:23,018
The only thing missing were 
the big swords and the costumes

754
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,064
and stuff.

755
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:32,152
That was the night I told 
Willy I was pregnant.

756
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,783
He's gone, you know?

757
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:41,828
Yeah.

758
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:48,043
It's good to see you.

759
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:09,857
Hallo?

760
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,320
Joey?

761
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,948
Rise and shine, buddy boy,
we're taking the meet.

762
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:22,035
Start this thing all over again,
me, you and Vincent.

763
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:26,665
Ten minutes, don't be late.

764
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,493
Back it up. Guys, we're 
coming through here.

765
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:07,539
- Alex, are we good?
- Yeah.

766
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:39,988
I've got one leg and 
I'm here on time.

767
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,782
They take this kind of thing as an insult.

768
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:45,327
That's what it was meant for.
Nice suit. Italian?

769
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:49,331
Hey, Smiley, how you're doing?

770
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:07,307
Buon giorno, Giuseppe.

771
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:09,977
Joey, my name is Joey.

772
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,311
Scusa.

773
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,896
Capisci Siciliano?

774
00:55:12,938 --> 00:55:15,399
No, I speak English.
I speak American.

775
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,444
Me too. I'm from Carnasi.

776
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:22,322
I don't give a shit where you come from.

777
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:26,368
No. We're getting off to a bad start here.

778
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:29,997
Either you tell me what's on your mind
or I'm gonna go buy myself a rack of lamb

779
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:32,916
and me and my friends are gonna 
have ourselves a little barbecue.

780
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:36,962
Giuseppe, we talk like men, no?

781
00:55:37,754 --> 00:55:40,507
Not like a bulldog in the gutter.

782
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:44,553
The bulldog - very ugly.
So you shoot me in the head,

783
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:49,391
than Sipio shoot you in the head.

784
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:50,809
And what do you get?

785
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:54,855
We've got a big headache.

786
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:57,316
That's funny.

787
00:55:57,357 --> 00:56:00,944
- Ain't that funny?
- Yeah, it's funny.

788
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:02,613
I make you laugh.

789
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,448
Yeah, a laugh.

790
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:05,991
That's good.

791
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:10,037
So let's talk business.

792
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:17,294
Hey, one thing.

793
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:19,796
This Rocco betrayed his friend.

794
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,924
I don't work with someone like that.

795
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:24,426
Either he goes or I go.

796
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:27,054
You have a problem?

797
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:31,141
We'll fix it.

798
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,293
What the hell is that noise?

799
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:02,297
It's a meat grinder.

800
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:05,425
Everything is drowned out. What happened?

801
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:08,011
Sipio killed Rocco.

802
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:09,346
Why?

803
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:11,682
Reggio told him to.

804
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:13,225
Okay. Why?

805
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,227
I don't know.

806
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:16,520
He just told him to shoot him?

807
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:18,355
Yup.

808
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:20,190
And you have no idea why?

809
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:22,359
You know, I didn't ask.

810
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:25,571
That's very helpful.

811
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:28,448
You've got to get me something I can use.

812
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:32,536
Come on, do us proud, tough guy.

813
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:54,057
Thank you, Jimmy.

814
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:02,649
I've got a winner.
