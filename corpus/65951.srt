00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,440
No press beyond this point.

163
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,280
<i>Alone at night
he crosses flames</i>

164
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,200
<i>Ashe makes a fist
with his red right hand</i>

165
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,400
Look, you're worried about the movie,
then protect the movie, okay?

166
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,360
Hire more security. Hire the National
Guard.Just don't kill the movie.

167
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,400
Violence in cinema
is a big deal right now, Roman.

168
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,640
This is not the kind of news
this studio is after.

169
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,680
So if we stop making
scary movies, what?

170
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,680
All the psychos in the world
will retire? Come on.

171
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,200
I've been makin' horror movies for
30 years, never had a psycho problem.

172
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,200
He was your goddamn idea, guys.
All right?

173
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,200
An ex-con with a trashy talk show?
He must've pissed people off every day.

174
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
Detectives, there's no reason
to presume that Cotton's death...

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,840
had anything to do
with this movie, is there?

176
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,000
He was making a movie called Stab.
He was stabbed.

177
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,280
<i>Probably some psycho fan pissed off
they killed Randy in Stab 2.</i>

178
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,280
Well, Tyson, that'd make you next,
wouldn't it?

179
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,200
I am not a Randy substitute.
I'm my own character.

180
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,920
Named Ricky,
who works at the video store.

181
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,800
It's an homage.

182
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,000
Hey! What if the killer's
Sidney Prescott?

183
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,200
I mean, what the hell ever happened to
her? She's probably off in the woods...

184
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
livin' like
the fuckin' Unabomber, man.

185
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,760
I'm starting to see why
Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
didn't want to come back.

186
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,320
Guys, this was about Cotton.
We are not in any danger.

187
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,600
"We are not in any danger,"
says Candy, page 15.

188
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,600
I don't see you leavin'.

189
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,760
You think serious black actors
my age can just throw away jobs?

190
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,680
It's all a business now. They got
Usher doing Pinter off-Broadway.

191
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,880
L.L. Cool J's
Shakespearin' in the park.

192
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,400
- Yeah!
- Maybe it's not meant to be.

193
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,920
Not meant to be? You win that
talent search for the new Sidney.

194
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,320
50,000 girls and they pick you. You
gotta be praying this movie keeps going.

195
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,080
Of course I am, but not
at the expense of people's lives.

196
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,080
Oh. Cue the violins, right?

197
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,920
Jesus.

198
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,720
Deja voodoo.

199
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,640
We need this area cleared, please.
Clear it.

200
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,320
- Gale Weathers! Oh, my God!
- Shit.

201
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,320
I-- Listen,
I-I-- I know we've never met...

202
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,800
and I don't mind you never returning
my calls, but I have to tell you...

203
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,400
after two films,
I feel like I am in your mind.

204
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,560
Well, that would explain
my constant headaches.

205
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,520
You know, I'm sorry things didn't
work out on 60 Minutes II.

206
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,240
<i>- But Total Entertainment,
that's a pretty good fallback.
- Thank you.</i>

207
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,600
I'm sorry that things didn't
work out with Brad Pitt...

208
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,720
but being single,
that's a pretty good fallback.

209
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,720
Gives me more time
for my work.

210
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,400
After all, Gale Weathers,
you're such a complex character.

211
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,720
Oh, and to be played by an actress
with such depth and range.

212
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,560
Uh,Jennifer,
Nick said you wanted to--

213
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,120
Gale.

214
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,240
Dewey.

215
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,560
Well, surprise, surprise.
Someone dies and Gale comes running.

216
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,840
Gale, I think you'll really appreciate
my character work in this one.

217
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,560
- Someone's helped me
understand the real you.
- Someone?

218
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Your ruthless ambition,
your private self-loathing...

219
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,680
and that lost and lonely
little girl inside.

220
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,680
Lost and lonely what?

221
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,920
You heard me.
Thanks, Dewey, I'll return it.

222
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,400
Lost and lonely what?

223
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,000
- Little girl inside.
- I thought you were
supposed to be in Woodsboro.

224
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,400
Well, I'm surprised
you thought about me at all.

225
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,480
Listen, I gotta get back to work.
I really don't have time for this.

226
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
- Wait a minute. You work here?
- Yeah.

227
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,640
The movie needed
a technical advisor.

228
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,320
Someone who went through the real
experience, knew the real people.

229
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,640
- Hey, Dewey.
- Hey, Tom.

230
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,680
Hey! It's the real Gale Weathers.

231
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Real from top to bottom.

232
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Tom Prinze.
Watch your show all the time.

233
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,560
You're so right. Pop culture
is the politics ofthe 21 st century.

234
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,480
- Thank you.
- And that story that you did...

235
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,800
last month on me crashing my car?

236
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,040
-Wow, was that ever powerful journalism.
-Right, uh--

237
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,360
I especially liked the way
you implied that it was caused
by drinking and drugs.

238
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,360
And that the tyre blowout was faked.
That was great.

239
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,480
Tom, sometimes in journalism
you have to--

240
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,040
Are you parked in the lot?
'Cause I should check to make sure...

241
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,800
that nobody's messed
with your brake line.

242
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,400
Who's he supposed to be?

243
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,240
He's playing you? Him?

244
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,440
What?

245
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,760
I did not come here
to fight with you, Dewey.

246
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,840
- Cotton's killer left a picture.
- Of Sid's mom.

247
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,680
- The detectives told me.
- Well, does Sidney know about it?

248
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,440
Listen, Sidney doesn't need
you and your camera in her life.

249
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,960
Do you see a camera?

250
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Right. You bought me
this purse, didn't you?

251
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,320
- Yeah.
- Look, it's-it's a habit.

252
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,280
-I-I walk outta the house, I turn it on.
-What the hell is this?

253
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
- It's like perfume.
- Gale Weathers?

254
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,520
- Could I be more popular?
- No press.

255
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,120
Mo press on set.
Get that woman outta here.

256
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,400
- Yes, Mr Milton. Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where is Detective Kincaid?

257
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,400
- I am working with Kincaid, Dewey.
- Come on. Move along, miss. Let's go.

258
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,440
Rules are rules, Gale.
But, really, it was great seeing you.

259
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,160
<i>Stab 3 is a closed set. But just up
ahead is the old Seinfeld stage.</i>

260
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Now, does anybody
need a potty break?

261
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,800
- Oh, I do.
- Yeah, me too.

262
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,520
Okay, let go!
Thanks for your help, boys.

263
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,480
Holy shit, Silent Bob. It's that
TV news chick, Connie-fuckin'-Chung!

264
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,800
Hey, Connie, how's Maury?

265
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,440
Dude, I think she likes me.
See how she's lookin' at me?

266
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,720
<i>It's happening again.</i>

267
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,280
Cotton had a lot
of enemies, Sid.

268
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,120
The police aren't saying
it's related to us.

269
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Do you ever think about her?

270
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,560
Your mom?

271
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,760
None of this would've
ever happened if she hadn't--

272
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,360
if she hadn't--

273
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,800
Why'd she have
so many secrets, Dad?

274
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,960
Listen, maybe it's time
you came home.

275
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,600
I'm worried about you, kid. Out here
by yourself. You never see anyone.

276
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,400
The only people you talk to
don't even know your real name.

277
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,160
It's as if you don't exist.

278
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,480
That's the idea. Psychos
can't kill what they can't find.

279
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,400
Sid, come here.

280
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,160
Mother needs to talk to you.

281
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,800
Everything you touch, Sid, dies!

282
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,600
You're poison.
You're just like me.

283
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,560
You're just like me.

284
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,400
Oh, my God!
What have they done to me?

285
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,160
They'll do it to you.

286
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,080
- They'll do it to you, baby.
- Mom?

287
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,600
Roman?

288
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,520
<i>Stab 3.
Jesus, I gotta get a new agent.</i>

289
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,680
Roman?

290
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,040
Someone here?

291
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,640
Stan, my man.
He does good work, huh?

292
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,640
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Fuck you very much.

293
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,600
- Tyson, go to hell.
- Well, excuse us, Sarah. Makeup tests.

294
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,560
Yeah, makeup. You can use it.
Damn it, have you seen Roman?

295
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,080
Look, everyone in the office
has gone home already.

296
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,000
- He said it was important.
- Everything's important to Roman.

297
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,480
Oh, shit!

298
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,640
<i>- Director's office.
- Sarah, it's Roman.</i>

299
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,680
<i>I'm sorry I'm running late. I'm still
on the 405. I'm about ten minutes away.</i>

300
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,200
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just
lookin' at your music video awards.

301
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,680
<i>Since I got you on thephone, let's--
let's talk about your character, okay?</i>

302
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,800
What character? I'm Candy,
the chick who gets killed second.

303
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,080
<i>- I'm only in two scenes.
- You're not happy with your part.</i>

304
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm not happy that I am
35 playing a 21-year-old.

305
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,120
I'm not happy
that I have to die naked.

306
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,080
And I'm not happy that my character is
too stupid to have a gun in the house...

307
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,040
after her boyfriend's
been cut into fish sticks.

308
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,400
<i>Great, okay.
So let's--let's run the lines.</i>

309
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,200
Fine.

310
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,760
<i>Page28.
Candy's big moment.</i>

311
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,920
Page 28.

312
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,400
Ring-ring.
Hello?

313
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,000
<i>- Hello?
- Who's this?</i>

314
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,200
<i>- Who's this?
- This is Candy.</i>

315
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,240
Hang on.
Let me get some clothes.

316
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,240
See? I don't understand why I have
to start the scene in the shower.

317
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,800
<i>The whole shower thing's been done.
Vertigo. Hello?</i>

318
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,160
And I mean, my boyfriend just died.
Why am I showering?

319
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,360
<i>Why don't we just read the scene?</i>

320
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,360
<i>Candy. Nice name. Is that like
Candy Cane or Candy Apple?</i>

321
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,800
Whatever.

322
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,080
Come on.
Who is this?

323
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,400
I think you have
the wrong number.

324
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,000
<i>- But you know my favourite name?
- I'm hanging up right now.</i>

325
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,000
<i>It's Sarah.</i>

326
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,360
Roman, that's not the line.

327
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,920
<i>It is in my script.</i>

328
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,840
Has there been another goddam rewrite?
How the fuck...

329
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,840
are we supposed to learn our lines when
there's a new script every 15 minutes?

330
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,760
<i>It's not just a new script.
It's a new movie.</i>

331
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,160
<i>- What? What movie?
- My movie.</i>

332
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,280
<i>And it's called Sarah Gets
Skewered Like a Fuckin' Pig!</i>

333
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,440
<i>Still in character, Sarah?</i>

334
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,200
Shit.

335
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,480
<i>Thank you for calling
Sunrise Picture Studios.</i>

336
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,240
<i>If you'd like today's
commissary menu, press one.</i>

337
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,480
Mr Bridger?

338
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,880
<i>If you'd like to hear previews of
upcoming Sunrise Pictures'releases...</i>

339
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,200

340
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,320
<i>If you'd like information about

00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,400
<i>- Come on. Come on.

342
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,160
<i>If you're trying to reach Lot Security
or you have an emergency, press six.</i>

343
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,640
Shit!

344
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,840
Oh! Fuck!

345
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,840
Look, I wanna get something straight.

346
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,520
I only got into this because
the police asked for my help.

347
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,640
- Why would the police come to you?
- Well, I did write..

348
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,800
the definitive book
on the Woodsboro murders.

349
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,720
I'm sure you just can't wait
to write another one.

350
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,400
- What about you?
- What about me?

351
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,000
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro.
"It's the only place that's real."

352
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,160
But now you're here.
Not with me.

353
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,640
Dewey, I took care ofyou.

354
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,360
I waited until you were well,
but I couldn't stay there.

355
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,560
It was like dog years. One year in
Woodsboro is like seven anywhere else.

356
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,400
So it's off to Paris for a week?
New York for a month? L.A. forever?

357
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,160
It was fucking 60 Minutes II.

358
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,160
- I couldn't say no. I could've
been the next Diane Sawyer.
- Wait a minute.

359
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,400
What's wrong with just being
Gale Weathers? I liked her.

360
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,920
It didn't work, Dewey.
We tried. We're different.

361
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,680
You used to say
that was our strength.

362
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,960
- Well--
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

363
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,960
Dewey, you're not just here because
of that second-rate K-Mart...

364
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,960
straight-to-video
version of me, are you?

365
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,360
Brace yourself, Gale.
All of this is actually not about you.

366
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,440
All of what, Dewey?
You do know something, don't you?

367
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,440
- Off the record?
- Always.

368
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,280
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police
got a call from a woman...

369
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,280
who said she was with Stab 3.

370
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,000
She wanted to see the file
on Sid, "for research."

371
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,000
- And?
- The boys said no.

372
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,000
And she wouldn't give her name.

373
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,640
A month later,
the station gets broken into.

374
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,640
- The file room gets ransacked.
- And someone stole Sid's file?

375
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,240
I already removed it.

376
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,560
I think someone on the film
is tryin' to find Sid.

377
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,400
- I'm sorry, this is incredible.
- I said, "off the record."

378
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,880
Right.

379
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,480
It's Jennifer.
She needs me.

380
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,000
-Jennifer?
- Gotta run.

381
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,920
- Wait! Dewey, where are you going?
- I'm on duty.

382
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,640
Stop following me.

383
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,840
I happen to be working
for the police, damn it!

384
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,400
- You're not a detective, Gale.
- Neither are you, Mr Incognito.

385
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,320
- Uh, you left your motor running.
- Damn it.

386
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,720
Fans, I can handle. Fans, they want
a picture, they want a conversation.

387
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,120
I can handle fans!
You see this, Dewey?

388
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,880
I haven't had one ofthese in a year and
a half. Someone's gonna pay for this.

389
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,640
-Jennifer, settle down. What happened?
- I'm with him.
- You.

390
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,160
Like I'm ever going
to win an award playing you.

391
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,280
- There's been a second murder.
- Who?

392
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,280
- Sarah Darling.
- Where?

393
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,760
-At the studio.
-Where? Nancy Drew
wants to know where.

394
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,920
Cotton Weary. Sarah Darling.
Don't you get it?

395
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,600
Someone's killing them in the order
they die in the movie.

396
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,120
- Dewey, who gets killed third?
- Who gets killed third?

397
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,480
You do.

398
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,520
I get killed in Stab 3?
I get killed?

399
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,240
- Yeah.
- Dewey, where are you going?

400
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,760
I have to get something
from my trailer.

401
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,840
Your--
You live here with her?

402
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,680
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

403
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,240
I needed a place to stay,
and she said she liked having me around.

404
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,240
- Why?
- She says I make her feel safe.

405
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,240
- She says I'm her rock.
- Her rock?

406
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,040
Yeah. If you weren't so concerned
with pretensions and appearances...

407
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,960
you'd be able to appreciate the
positivity and emotional centeredness...

408
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,880
I provide a woman.

409
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,920
Stone, I'm headed
to the crime scene.

410
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,480
You stay by Jennifer's side.
I suggest a search of the grounds.

411
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,840
Hey, Dewdrop.
Can I have a word?

412
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,880
Just so it can be straight. I'm
the professional celebrity guard here.

413
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,600
My resume lists Julia Roberts,
Salmon Rushdie, Posh Spice.

414
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,520
You are the Hollywood hanger-oner.

415
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,800
'Cause you're just no good
as a cop any more.

416
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,720
Your resume reads
like the obituaries.

417
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,520
So how about you take suggestions
from me? All right?

418
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,120
Whatever you say.

419
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,840
Hmm. Same deal?
Found with the body?

420
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,160
- Yeah, Maureen Prescott again.
- This is great.

421
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,800
Ten more murders
and we can publish a calendar.

422
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,800
The old "killer playing
with the cops" routine.

423
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,560
Very Hannibal Lecter.
Very Seven.

424
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,160
Doesn't the killer come after
the cops in those movies?

425
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,160
Usually one cop makes it.

426
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,360
- And?
- One cop doesn't.

427
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,360
- Usually.
- Detective Kincaid.

428
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,880
- What do we know? Same killer?
- Hey, hey.

429
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,120
<i>Terminal Entertainment,
this is a crime scene, okay?</i>

430
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,320
Wallace, Miss Weathers
is working with me now.

431
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,200
- Thank you, Detective.
- You're welcome.

432
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,880
Well, in that case, I'm gonna go dust
for fingerprints with Jane Pauley.

433
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,800
Uh, photos, Wallace, please?
Thank you.

434
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,760
New pictures, same person.
Anything turn up on your research yet?

435
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,240
- Nothing that will help with these.
- What about an increased
police presence around Jennifer?

436
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,840
- She's the next one
to get killed in the script.
- She has a bodyguard.

437
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,800
And besides, the producers told us
that there were three different
versions of the script.

438
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,440
Something about trying to keep
the ending off the Internet.
You should know that.

439
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,360
You're the technical advisor, right?

440
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,240
Three versions.
Three different characters die next.

441
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,600
And we don't know which one
the killer read.

442
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,120
Hey, hold up.

443
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,960
<i>All I ever wanted to do
was make a real classic lovestory.</i>

444
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,800
And the studio said they'd let me.
I just had to do
a scary movie for them first.

445
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,080
And now we're shut down,
and I am fucked!

446
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
God, it's not the end
of the world, Roman.

447
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,360
That is so easy foryou to say. You can
always go back to, to MustSee TV.

448
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,840
You know, I have no movie,
I'm about to turn 30, and it
looks like I'm now the next target.

449
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,440
- What?
- You? Why you?

450
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,600
Do you think this wasn't a message?

451
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,200
- Roman Bridger?
- What?

452
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,240
Mr Bridger,
you didn't tell us...

453
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,600
you spoke with Sarah Darling
before she was murdered.

454
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,400
Uh, spoke with her, uh, when?

455
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,600
The guard said she was here
for a meeting with you.

456
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,080
- What meeting? I don't--
- We talked with her roommate too.

457
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,040
Says you called Sarah,
told her to come down to the studio.

458
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,040
- Roommate answered the phone.
Says it was you.
- Wait a minute. No, no.

459
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,040
I-I never called her.
I never told her to go anywhere.

460
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,080
Roommate says she knows
your voice, Mr Bridger.

461
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,400
Well, she wasn't speaking with me! God!
Look, I did not call Sarah Darling.

462
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,600
- Sarah Darling said you did.
- Someone's trying to ruin my movie.

463
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
Someone wants to kill
my movie!

464
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,960
All right, we'll talk about
your movie down at the station.

465
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,000
- All right.
- This is the scene
where you come with us.

466
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Dewey,Jennifer--
Wait a minute.

467
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,200
She wasn't talking with me
on the phone. I'm coming!

468
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,040
I'll call him in. Battery. Mr Riley,
do you have a cell phone I can borrow?

469
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,480
Yeah.

470
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,320
- Thank you.
- God. Roman.

471
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,040
Remind me not
to sleep with him again.

472
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,640
Come here, Cherokee.

473
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,160
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
My name is Laura. How can I help you?

474
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,160
<i>Oh, Laura.
I do have a crisis.</i>

475
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,880
Okay, well, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

476
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,480
<i>Oh, my God.
I've killed someone, Laura.</i>

477
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,480
<i>- Are you sure ?
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.</i>

478
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,640
<i>I killed someone, I know it!
Oh, my God.</i>

479
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,160
<i>- Well, then, um--
- I did.</i>

480
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,120
Then the people you need to call
are the police.

481
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,480
<i>No, I need to call you!
Just you.</i>

482
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,480
I'm sorry, your-your voice--

483
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,880
<i>Don't you wanna know
how you can help, Laura?</i>

484
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,280
<i>Are you listening to me?
Huh?</i>

485
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,600
<i>- Who is this?
- It's Mother, Laura.</i>

486
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,280
<i>Now, be a good girl
and turn on the news.</i>

487
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,960
<i>Do as Mother tells you!</i>

488
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,840
You're not my mother. How did you
get this number? Who is this?

489
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,720
<i>You know your mother's voice
when you hear it!</i>

490
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,080
<i>Now, turn on the news!</i>

491
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,640
<i>And with a second cast member
murdered, Stab 3...</i>

492
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,360
<i>has been officially shut down,
prompting those involved...</i>

493
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,640
<i>to hope and pray that
these killings maybe over.</i>

494
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,520
<i>Just one question.</i>

495
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,680
<i>Do you think it's over, Sidney?
Do you?</i>

496
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,080
<i>The sky was dark this morning</i>

497
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,600
<i>Not a bird in a tree</i>

498
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,160
Is this a wrap party
or is this a wrap party?

499
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,040
Scene 34.
"Maureen's Murder Flashback."

500
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,920
- I never liked that scene.
- That's 'cause you weren't in it.

501
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,960
Scenes 40 through 47.

502
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,720
- "The Prescott House Flashbacks."
- Tom, stop it.

503
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,680
You're scaring me.
Two people are dead.

504
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,960
Scaring you?

505
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,400
Give the sweet,
young ingenue act a rest.

506
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,000
- You're drunk.
- I'm coping.

507
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,360
I bet she fought and clawed
for that Sidney part.

508
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,080
I bet she stepped on any poor girl
that got in her way.

509
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,360
- So you asked her out and she said no?
- That has nothing to do with it.

510
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,800
Right.
Come on, Dewey.

511
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,160
Scene 50.

512
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,320
"Dewey Saves the Day."

513
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,720
She's so focused on success
that she never thinks...

514
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
about who she's hurting
to get it.

515
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,840
And you saved her life, like,
how many times?

516
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,840
Gale wants the whole world
to love her.

517
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,640
One person's never enough.
She's a dreamer.

518
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,960
-No, she's a narcissistic, psycho bitch.
-No, she's not.

519
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,160
She's got a good heart.
She does.

520
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,480
She just hides it away because
she thinks people see that as weak.

521
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,040
This is a good picture of you.
You look just like her.

522
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,360
God, Dewey.

523
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,520
You make it sound like
you're still in love with her.

524
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,520
And I left out the part
that she's cruel...

525
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,520
and selfish,
obsessive and annoying.

526
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,640
We have one Gale Weathers here.
We don't need two.

527
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,640
Hey, Dewdrop,
got your girlfriend out here.

528
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,720
Look who I found slinkin'
around the yard. The nightly news.

529
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,800
I wasn't slinking.
I was walking.

530
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,320
You were eaves dropping
at the bedroom window.

531
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,040
Yeah, a bedroom that
you seemed awfully at home in.

532
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,800
All right, let's talk.

533
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,920
Come on.

534
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,800
- What's this about, Gale?
- Did you know they released Roman?

535
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,720
Sarah's call didn't come
from his cell phone.

536
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,480
- Where did it come from then?
- A cloned cell phone. It's untraceable.

537
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,120
Well, thanks for the update, Gale.
Why don't you just go back home?

538
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,400
Dewey, wait a minute.
Just wait one second.

539
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,120
How old do you think
Maureen Prescott is in this picture?

540
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,760
- Nineteen, twenty.
- That's what I thought,
so I checked it out.

541
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,320
I cannot find any information about
her at this age. I mean, nothing.

542
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,000
She lived in Woodsboro her whole life.
Someone there must know something.

543
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,480
Almost her whole life.
Two years before...

544
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,080
she met Sidney's father,
she left Woodsboro.

545
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,640
No one has any idea
where she went or what she did.

546
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,920
I mean, it's-it's like she fell into
a black hole, Dewey! She vanished!

547
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,920
- So?
- So?

548
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,640
Why is the killer
leaving pictures of-of Maureen?

549
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,400
And why these pictures at-at--
at that point in her life?

550
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,560
I don't know! If I thought
like a homicidal maniac...

551
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,400
then I'd know how
a homicidal maniac thinks.

552
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,160
What?

553
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,640
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer?

554
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,880
Look at the buildings.
The second story. There and there.

555
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,920
It's the same!
It's the same street 28 years ago.

556
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,400
Oh, my God. Maureen Prescott was
at the back lot at Sunrise Studios!

557
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,160
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta make some calls.

558
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,240
Steven Stone
Protection Services.

559
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,240
<i>Stone, where are you?</i>

560
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,920
I'm just checking
your tin can, Dewdrop.

561
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,840
<i>Well, come back inside
and stay with Jennifer.</i>

562
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,080
<i>Something's happened.
I have to go to the police.</i>

563
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Is that an order, Dewdrop? 'Cause
Steven Stone doesn't work for you.

564
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,000
<i>Get back in the house, Stone.
Would I call you if it wasn 't important?</i>

565
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,120
<i>- What are you doing in there anyway?
- Me?</i>

566
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,520
I'm just checking to make sure
there's no killer in here...

567
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,320
waitin' to off you
like he did your little sister.

568
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,360
<i>What did you say?
I can't believe you said that.</i>

569
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,720
<i>That makes me...</i>

570
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,480
angry!

571
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,600
Fucker!

572
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,160
Gotta call Kincaid.

573
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,040
Dewey, where is everybody?

574
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,280
- Oh, God.
-Jennifer?

575
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,840
Angelina?
Tom?

576
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,360
Oh, my God!
What happened?

577
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,880
Don't do that.
I'm overreacting.

578
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,760
Dewdrop?

579
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,120
- Stone?
- Oh, my God!

580
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,600
Oh, God, Stone!

581
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,960
Oh, God!

582
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,160
- Dewey, is he dead?
- Yeah.

583
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,320
Everyone back inside!

584
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,920
It's all right.
Don't panic.

585
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,160
Okay, outside. Everyone,
stay together and try to remain calm.

586
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,160
A phone!

587
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,680
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.

588
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,440
Shit!
It's the fax.

589
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,640
"Interior, Jennifer's house. Living
room, night." It's a script page.

590
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,600
- W-W-What's it say?
- "With the bodyguard stabbed to death,
the five stand trapped.

591
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,960
- He's rewriting the movie.
- As the killer waits outside...

592
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,080
suddenly the fax machine
sends news of their fates."

593
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,120
It's a trick!
Everybody, outside!

594
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,360
- Outside where he can
pick us off one by one?
- Shut up!

595
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,520
"The killer prepares to grant
mercy to only one of them."

596
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,800
Don't you get it? The killer says he's
outside because he wants us here inside.

597
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,080
- Which one is it?
- Come on!

598
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,240
"Who will survive? Is it Jennifer?
Tom? Angelina? Dewey? Gale?

599
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,880
- The killer will give mercy to--"
- Everyone outside!

600
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,160
He grants mercy to who?
I wanna know what happens!

601
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,840
- I wanna know what happens!
- Wait for the fucking movie!

602
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,840
- I've gotta know! I'm goin' back in!
- No.

603
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,440
All right, everyone, back.
Stay together.

604
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,640
- What's it say?
- "And the...

605
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,800
killer will give mercy to...

606
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,440
- whoever--"
- Whoever?

607
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,960
Whoever?

608
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,760
Piece of shit.

609
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,240
"Whoever--
Whoever smells the--"

610
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,840
I can't stop
rolling down the hill!

611
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,600
Gale!Jennifer!

612
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,560
- Dewey!
- Dewey!

613
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,600
Dewey, where are you?

614
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,440
Over here, Dewey!

615
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,680
- Dewey!
- Gale!

616
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,480
Gale, behind you!

617
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,440
Dewey!
Are you all right?

618
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,600
Yeah, never been better.

619
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,160
Yeah, I'm all right.
Where'd he go?

620
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,600
- He must've rolled under the car.
- All right, stay close.

621
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,640
Is he back there?

622
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,400
- No.
- No?

623
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,000
He's fast.
Could've sworn I hit him.

624
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,360
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

625
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,560
Thanks for saving me.

626
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,160
Ah, it's habit.

627
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,160
Oh, God.

628
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,680
What the fuck happened to you?

629
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,160
-Jennifer, wait a minute.
- Who gave you a place to stay?

630
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,520
-Who are you supposed to be protecting?
-Jennifer!

631
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,600
Hey!

632
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,920
My lawyer liked that.

633
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,840
Not as much as I did.

634
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,320
- Angelina?
- Tom was in the house.

635
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,040
- How'd you end up way over there?
- Oh, my God! Tom was in the house!

636
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,400
- Are we safe?
- Safe from who?

637
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,120
Wait a second!

638
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,600
Another picture.

639
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,840
<i>Whoever it is is now taking credit
for Maureen Prescott's murder.</i>

640
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,880
But we know who killed Maureen
Prescott. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.

641
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,240
-I mean, they even told Sidney
how they did it.
- Yeah, but if I'm not mistaken...

642
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
you said in your book that
Sidney got it wrong once before.

643
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,200
She accused Cotton Weary
of murdering her mother.

644
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,160
And he was sent away for it.
Maybe there is a third killer.

645
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,240
Sidney might know something.

646
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,760
I told you.
I don't know where Sidney is.

647
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,320
And even if there was a third killer,
Sidney doesn't know about it.

648
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,560
That is for me to decide.
I need to talk to her, Mr. Riley.
She is a key element in this case.

649
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
I have a press conference in an hour.
I need to explain...

650
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,240
why there are three dead celebrities
and a bodyguard.

651
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,960
And a very angry mayor.

652
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,960
Okay, look, we all know this has
something to do with Stab 3.

653
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,920
But what we do not know is why
the killer keeps leaving pictures...

654
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,280
of Maureen Prescott
taken over 25 years ago.

655
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,000
And the photographs taken at the same
studio Stab 3 is shooting out of.

656
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,640
What does this
have to do with Sid?

657
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,320
Who knows more about Maureen
Prescott than her own daughter?

658
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,960
Well, Sid's dad couldn't help you,
and he was married to Maureen.

659
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,880
What's your problem?

660
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,320
Last night you were almost charcoal.
You gonna help us or what?

661
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,440
Do you wanna have this
conversation with a polygraph?

662
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,840
- Is that a threat, Detective?
- When it's a threat, you'll know it.

663
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,120
- Was that a threat?
- Boys, boys.

664
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,560
Why don't we compare
our gun calibres later?

665
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,840
- The issue is Maureen Prescott.
- Wrong. The issue is Sidney Prescott.

666
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,640
And either Mr Riley is going
to obstructjustice or he's going
to put me in touch with her.

667
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,880
So, where is she?

668
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,360
<i>Hi, you've reached the machine.
You can leave a message.
Talk as long as you want.</i>

669
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,120
Sid, it's me.
This is the fifth time I've called.

670
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,120
Please pick up.
I wanna make sure you're...

671
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,640
okay.

672
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,640
- Sid!
- Dewey!

673
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,280
What are you doing down here?

674
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,440
Actually, what was I doing up there?

675
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,640
-Jesus, Dewey. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm all right.

676
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,560
- Is she all right?
- Hey, you know Gale.

677
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,280
It'd take a direct hit.

678
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,640
So the news said this was the precinct.
Who's this guy Kincaid?

679
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,600
Come here.
I told you to stay hidden.

680
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,120
- It's not safe for you to be here.
- The killer called me.

681
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,400
- What?
- Yeah, he found me.

682
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,800
I'm no more safe there than I am here,
and at least here I'm not alone.

683
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,760
Okay, come on.

684
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,200
- Detective Kincaid?
- Yeah.

685
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,760
There's someone here
who wants to help.

686
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,400
Oh, my God.
Sidney.

687
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,480
Is the man fast or what?

688
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,880
- Hi.
- Hi, Gale.

689
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,040
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

690
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,640
- Sid, this is Detective Kincaid.
- Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.

691
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,920
- The killer called her.
- What? When?

692
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,320
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know, the usual small talk.

693
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,720
What's new? How you been?
How do you wanna die?

694
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,720
Sidney, do you have any idea
how he could've gotten your number?

695
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,800
He could have monitored her calls on a
scanner. Did you call her from the set?

696
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,880
- No.
- Do you have her number
stored in your memory?

697
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,960
- Phone memory!
- Oh. Yeah, guess I do.

698
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,920
- Has anyone else ever used your phone?
-Just Jennifer.

699
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,960
And you.

700
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,720
Hey, I'm the cop here.
You're in my office, Riley.

701
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,760
The killer leaves a photograph
after each murder, Sidney.

702
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,840
They were taken in Hollywood at the same
studio that they're shooting Stab 3.

703
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,800
Why didn't you tell me?
This is my mother, Dewey.

704
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,480
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid they were bait.

705
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,600
Something to, you know,
trick you out of hiding.

706
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,240
Sidney, was she an actress or a model?
Because they look a lot
like publicity stills.

707
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,400
I, uh, don't know.

708
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,400
Detective, I wanna see
this place in the pictures.

709
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,880
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

710
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,200
- Slow it down.
- Sorry.

711
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,800
Watch the fuckin' aliens.

712
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,440
I'm gonna go talk to
the studio brass about those photos.

713
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,440
Yeah, right.
I know where you're goin'.

714
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,720
- Yeah, keep an eye on Sidney.
- I know where you're goin'.

715
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,400
You're gonna get her some flowers
and candy, huh? Huh?

716
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,400
- Gimme a break.
- Yeah, gimme a call.

717
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,000
Just keep your eye on her.

718
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,720
That stairwell over there, that's
where one of the pictures was taken.

719
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,440
God. I can't believe
she never mentioned any of this.

720
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,920
- She probably just--
- Dewey!

721
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,640
- Sorry.
- Martha!

722
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,680
- Oh, my God, Sid.
- Hey, hold it right there! Hey!
- Don't shoot!

723
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,960
- I'm only 17.
- It's okay. We know her.

724
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,920
We do?

725
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,080
Tell me that's his ex-girlfriend,
I'll shoot myself.

726
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,720
- It's Martha Meeks, Randy's sister.
- Randy's sister?

727
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,320
- Yeah, can't you tell?
- We miss you in Woodsboro, guys.

728
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:05,000
- Martha, what are you doing here?
- There's something you guys should see.

729
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,000
<i>Told ya I'd make
a movie someday. Huh?</i>

730
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,320
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Well, if you're watching this tape...</i>

731
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,320
<i>it means, as I feared, I did not
survive these killings...</i>

732
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,040
<i>here at Windsor College,
and that giving up my virginity...</i>

733
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,800
<i>to Karen Kolchakat the video store
was probably not a good idea.</i>

734
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,160
<i>- Karen Kolchak?
- Yes, Karen Kolchak.</i>

735
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,800
<i>- "Creepy Karen"?
- Shut up! She's a sweet person, okay?</i>

736
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,440
<i>We were workin'late. We were puttin'
away some videos in the porno section...</i>

737
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,120
<i>and, you know, shit happens.</i>

738
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,440
<i>- Open the door, Randy!
- Fifteen minutes.</i>

739
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,120
<i>- It's my room too!
- Paul,15 minutes.</i>

740
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,000
<i>I'm leaving my legacy.</i>

741
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,880
<i>Fifteen minutes, Paul!
Damn! Anyway...</i>

742
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,200
<i>the reason I'm here is to help you so
that my death will not be in vain.</i>

743
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,320
<i>That my life's work will help save some
other poor soul from getting mutilated.</i>

744
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,840
<i>If this killer does come back
and he's for real...</i>

745
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,920
<i>there are a few things
that you gotta remember.</i>

746
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,040
<i>Is this simply another sequel?
Well, if it is, same rules apply.</i>

747
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,520
<i>But here's the critical thing.
If you find yourself dealing...</i>

748
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,960
<i>with an unexpected back-story
and ap reponderance...</i>

749
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,680
<i>of exposition,
then the sequel rules do not apply.</i>

750
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,280
<i>Because you're not dealing with
the sequel. You are dealing with...</i>

751
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,440
<i>the concluding chapter
of a trilogy.</i>

752
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,080
<i>- Trilogy.
- That's right. It's
a rarity in the horror field...</i>

753
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,840
<i>but it does exist, and it is
a force to be reckoned with.</i>

754
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,400
<i>Because true trilogies are all about
going back to the beginning...</i>

755
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,680
<i>and discovering something
that wasn 't true from the get-go.</i>

756
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,320
<i>Godfather, Jedi,
all revealed something...</i>

757
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,680
<i>that we thought was true
that wasn 't true.</i>

758
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,040
<i>So if it is a trilogy
you are dealing with...</i>

759
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,320
<i>here are some super
trilogy rules.</i>

760
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,120
<i>One: You've got a killer
who's gonna be superhuman.</i>

761
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,120
<i>Stabbing him won't work.
Shooting him won't work.</i>

762
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,560
<i>Basically, in the third one, you've
gotta cryogenically freeze his head...</i>

763
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,400
<i>decapitate him or blowhim up.</i>

764
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,440
<i>Number two: Anyone, including
the main character, can die.</i>

765
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,720
<i>This means you, Sid.
I'm sorry. It's the final chapter.</i>

766
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,320
<i>It could be fuckin' Reservoir Dogs
by the time this thing is through.</i>

767
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,200
<i>Number three: The past will
come back to bite you in the ass.</i>

768
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,200
<i>Whatever you think you know
about the past, forget it.</i>

769
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,520
<i>The past is not at rest!
Any sins you think...</i>

770
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,840
<i>were committed in the past are about
to break out and destroy you.</i>

771
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,880
<i>So in closing,
let me say...</i>

772
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,520
<i>goodluck, Godspeed...</i>

773
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,600
<i>and for some of you,
I'll see you soon.</i>

774
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,000
<i>'Cause the rules say some of you
ain't gonna make it. I didn't.</i>

775
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,600
<i>Not if you're watching this tape.</i>

776
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,560
Thank you. And you be careful.
Say hi to your folks for me.

777
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,960
You be careful too, Sid.

778
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,640
- Bye, Dewey. Come visit us soon.
- I will, Martha.

779
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,720
- Thank you.
- Bye.

780
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,120
I've got an idea.
I'll hook up with you guys later.

781
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,560
- Do you want us to come with you?
- I work better alone.

782
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,440
Why don't you try to figure out where
those other pictures were taken.

783
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,800
- I can see nothing's changed.
- No.

784
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,880
Oh, shit.

785
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,400
Hello!

786
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,880
-Jeez.
- What the hell are you doing?

787
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,000
Being Gale Weathers.
What the hell are you doing?

788
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,120
- I am Gale Weathers.
- Here's how I see it.

789
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,040
I've got no house, no bodyguard,
no movie, and I'm being stalked.

790
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,360
Because someone wants to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you.

791
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,640
So now, starting now,
I go where you go.

792
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,200
That way, if someone wants
to kill me, I'll be with you.

793
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,480
And since they really want to kill you,
they won't kill me, they'll kill you.

794
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,320
- Make sense?
- None.

795
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,360
You know, in the movies,
I play you as being much smarter.

796
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,800
And as a sane person.
Foryou, that must be quite a stretch.

797
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,960
- That's funny.
- Ha!

798
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,960
- Need to get in that building?
- Yeah.

799
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,960
- Is there a story in that building?
- Maybe.

800
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,800
Gale Weathers would find a way.

801
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,920
Bitch. All right, wait.Just--

802
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,280
Don't tell me what to do.

803
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,840
Basements, wow.

804
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,920
Basements creep me out.

805
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,520
You'd make
a fascinating interview.

806
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,680
Hello?

807
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,400
Hi. Excuse me.
I am Gale Weathers...
