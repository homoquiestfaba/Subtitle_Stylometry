Mr. Hassan, we are prepared to

00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,433
What?

902
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,600
You remind me of her.

903
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,126
- Who?
- Montine.

904
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,034
Oh gross!

905
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,461
That bitter old lady!

906
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,080
I think she's just sad
because her husband left her.

907
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:43,569
Is that what she told you?

908
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,566
You finally got a
boyfriend, Sammy girl?

909
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:47,752
[crowd giggling]

910
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,742
What's up with
the silly hat, dude?

911
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,386
[sighs]

912
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:54,620
Shut up, McDonough.

913
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,035
Hey, dude, I'm talking to you.

914
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,518
It's not a hat, it's a topi.

915
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,635
A toe cheese?

916
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,948
[crowd giggling]

917
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:08,303
Check out the little
dude's toe cheese.

918
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,148
[laughing]

919
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:12,836
Where you going?

920
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,326
You got a building to blow up?

921
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,927
I asked you a
question, rag head.

922
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,971
Hey leave him
alone. He's just a kid.

923
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,346
It's okay, Sam. I know what
to do with bullies like him.

924
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:26,015
[crowd booing]

925
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,760
And I know what to do
with dirty little Arabs like you.

926
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,903
[chuckles]

927
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,112
What's so funny?

928
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,185
I'm not Arab, I'm Pakistani.

929
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,276
Huh! And there's a difference.

930
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,176
[chuckles]

931
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,294
You don't know the difference
between Arab and Pakistani?

932
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:44,949
[slaps]

933
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,930
Stop it! Get off of him!

934
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,856
Omar, please just stop!

935
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:57,746
[somber music]

936
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:58,932
Yeah!

937
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:17,496
[music]

938
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,130
All right.

939
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,381
Where were you two?

940
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,946
What happened, is that blood?

941
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,630
We were just at the
park. And all of a sudden--

942
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,156
Sam!

943
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:25,878
What?

944
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,316
How could you let this happen?

945
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,186
Well, it's not like I
really had a choice.

946
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,946
Well, you took him to the park,
you were responsible for him.

947
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,666
Yeah. And you took
Uncle Mike to the building.

948
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,396
Does that mean you're
responsible for killing him?

949
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,156
- Samantha Jean McLeod!
- What?

950
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,426
Apologize to her.

951
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:38,853
No.

952
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,266
Yes. You apologize
to her right now.

953
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:41,624
No!

954
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,090
Look, ever since it
happened, all she ever does

955
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:46,956
is look at me with those
angry eyes like it was my fault.

956
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,166
So if you want to blame
me for her blackened heart

957
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,906
and for getting Omar
beat up, then fine.

958
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,747
Fine. Just blame me for everything.

959
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,227
[door closes]

960
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,606
You, okay?

961
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:12,027
I don't think it was such a
good idea to bully the boys.

962
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,869
Let's get you cleaned up.

963
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,965
[water trickling]

964
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,295
I'm allowed to touch you
when you're bleeding?

965
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,760
No.

966
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,680
Now here, take this and--

967
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,628
What are you going
to do with that?

968
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,992
Who is Uncle Mike?

969
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,064
Michael was my husband.

970
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,884
And you told me
that he left you.

971
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,451
He did.

972
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,698
April 19th, 1995.

973
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:11,011
He was working in
the federal building.

974
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,828
Oklahoma City

975
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,078
I dropped him off that morning.

976
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,752
Handed him his lunchbox.

977
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:29,757
And told him I'd pick
him up after work.

978
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,479
I was running late for some
stupid aerobics class and

979
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,296
I forgot to give him a kiss.

980
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,976
It's interesting that some of
the most important moments

981
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,346
in your life happen when
you're not even looking.

982
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,063
I'm really sorry.

983
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:58,934
Me, too.

984
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,546
You missed a
spot there tough guy.

985
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:05,099
Oh.

986
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:19,061
[knocking on door]

987
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,118
Are you okay?

988
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,514
Is the couch comfortable?

989
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,772
Yes, sir. Thank you.

990
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:27,882
Goodnight, Omar.

991
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,907
Excuse me.

992
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:37,872
You can talk to God, right?

993
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:43,864
We all can talk to God.

994
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,966
But you're a holy man.

995
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,878
You've a special, direct
connection with him.

996
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,098
That connection
hasn't

997
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:58,212
exactly been
working so well lately.

998
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:58,729
But--

999
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,682
Why does God let
bad things happen?

1000
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:10,359
[sighs]

1001
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:18,695
Well,

1002
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,824
some people think that

1003
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,590
God created the Earth and

1004
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:32,144
everything that happens
after that is just chance.

1005
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,595
Others would say that

1006
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,703
things happen because
of man's free will.

1007
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:44,091
Sometimes we make good choices,
and sometimes we make bad choices.

1008
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:46,359
But--

1009
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,396
I think there's
some mystery to it.

1010
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:53,273
Because there's

1011
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,529
some things that
happen in this world that

1012
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:58,687
we just can't

1013
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:00,914
fully understand.

1014
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,053
Like what happened
to Montine's husband.

1015
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:06,819
Yeah.

1016
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,996
<i>Like what happened
to Montine's husband.</i>

1017
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:47,106
[somber music]

1018
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,648
Allahu Akbar.

1019
01:02:48,790 --> 01:03:00,296
[music]

1020
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,723
Allahu Akbar.

1022
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,572
Allahu Akbar.

1023
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:09,262
Hey.

1024
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,698
- Let me help you.
- I got it.

1025
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:19,784
[sighs]

1026
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:20,963
Hey, aunt Montine.

1027
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,370
I'm sorry about what I
said to you last night.

1028
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:32,008
I think I can find space in my
blackened heart to forgive you.

1029
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,489
Okay, cool.

1030
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,174
Well, I'm not really into
the whole goodbye thing.

1031
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,800
It's no problem.

1032
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:42,179
Okay.

1033
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,044
Take good care of your dad.

1034
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,056
[scoffs]
Yeah.

1035
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,075
Somebody has to.

1036
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,302
She hates me.

1037
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,592
Now, I'll tell you a secret.

1038
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:07,769
All 15-year-old girls
hate their fathers.

1039
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,662
All big sisters can't
stand their baby brothers.

1040
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,071
I'll be back on Sunday.

1041
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:27,714
Hey, I'm sorry again
about those creeps.

1042
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,386
It's okay. It's not
really your fault.

1043
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:32,032
[car engine revving]

1044
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:37,288
You know, if you tell Aunt Montine about
the cigarettes, I'm gonna kick your ass.

1045
01:04:43,830 --> 01:05:58,246
[music]

1046

[door opens]

1048
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,506
Why you going in that apartment?

1049
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,776
It's just a kid. He's
excited to see his father.

1050
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,790
His father ain't been
home since Tuesday.

1051
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:10,768
Tuesday?

1052
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,306
He worked at the Trade Center.

1053
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:14,823
It's a shame, really.

1054
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,310
He seemed like a nice guy.

1055
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:17,624
[door closes]

1056
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,166
Okay. What's going on here?

1057
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,186
You told me
you talked to him.

1058
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:27,774
I did.

1059
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,888
Yeah. And he said that he would
be here when you got home, right?

1060
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,302
That's what he told me.

1061
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,777
So why'd that lady just say he hasn't
been here since it happened, hmm?

1062
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,060
Where is he?

1063
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,004
I talked to him on
the special phone.

1064
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:47,651
Special phone?

1065
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:49,910
It's right here.

1066
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:52,770
It's what?

1067
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,176
My Abbu taught me that

1068
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:03,066
we all have these invisible wires that
connect us to the people that we love.

1069
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:03,907
[sniffling]

1070
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,456
And so whenever
you wanna talk to them

1071
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,366
all we have to do is

1072
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:09,126
[sniffling]

1073
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:11,415

phones inside our head

[sniffling]

1075
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:16,742
it's like they're
right there with us.

1076
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,817
Oh, my God!

1077
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:29,106
You had me believe
that everything was fine.

1078
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:35,456
You brought me here based on
some imaginary phone in your head?

1079
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,642
It's not an imaginary phone.

1080
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:38,904

Ma'am, there's no Maliq Hassan

1085
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,240
who has been either
positively identified--

1086
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,320
Is there some kind of
form that I could fill out

1087
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,216
so you call me when
you do find him?

1088

when it fell, they ain't gonna find him.

1089

got eight lines holding.

I don't understand why
I can't stay with you?

1116
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,207
Now, kid, I live in a crash pad.

1117
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:41,874
What's a crash pad?

1118
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,886
Well, it's an apartment
with like ten bunk beds

1119
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:47,762
scattered all over the
living rooms and bedrooms.

1120
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,043
You...

1121
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,874
You live with that many people?

1122
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,240
No, the international
girls just usually

1123
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,457

they work the red eyes.

1124

And first come, first serve.

1127

So the beds are full, you gotta
just curl up on that dirty old couch or

1128

Why don't you get
your own place?

1131
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,770
I don't want my own place. I--

1132
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:28,197
It's too quiet.

1133
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,910
You know, sometimes on
my days off, I go to the airport

1134
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:38,725
and just get on whatever
flight is taking off next.

1135
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,022
I spend the night in the hotel
and flight back the next morning.

1136
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:44,599
Why?

1137
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,671
Because as long as I'm--

1138
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:54,651
on that plane or at
the airport or hotel,

1139
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,504
I've a purpose.

1140
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,446
You know, a reason
to get up in the morning.

1141
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:09,478
If there's

1142
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:14,296

might wanna pack it up now.

Who is this?

1150
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:40,063
This is Paul Ehrlich
with Ops in Longview.

1151
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,185
Shit!

1152
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,340
<i>Yeah. Shit's right.
I ring the hotel.</i>

1153
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,051
<i>I ask them to give me room 914,
what do you think they tell me?</i>

1154
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,902
I don't know.

1155
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,462
There is no room 914.

1156
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,567

[phone ringing]

1158
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:03,970
So you made the
unilateral decision to drive

1159
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,761
the unaccompanied
minor back to New York?

1160
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:10,286
Actually, we started out on
a bus, but we got kicked off.

1161
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:13,625
And then, I made the
unilateral decision to drive.

1162
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:16,676
You may think that this is
amusing, but I can assure you I don't.

1163
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:20,740
You violated almost every rule we have
regarding the care of unaccompanied minors.

1164
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,666
Yeah, well, the rule book kinda got
tossed out the window Tuesday morning.

1165
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:25,806
Perhaps by you, but we
still have an airline to ride.

1166
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:28,636
Yeah. And I had a small
child who was all alone and--

1167
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:33,076
With legal obligations to adhere
to and consequences if we don't.

1168
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,228
Do you have any idea what
could have happened if he got lost?

1169
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,609
Or if he had an accident?

1170
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:39,196
The lawsuits that
we'd be liable for?

1171
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,186
Lawsuits?

1172
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,774
Is that what this is about?

1173
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,024
Who's gonna sue you?

1174
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:45,233
This meeting is over.

1175
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:48,068
Mr. Al Katani will
take Omar from here.

1176
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,556
Oh, really? Who are you
afraid is gonna sue you?

1177
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:53,700
I mean, his only family
member is probably buried

1178
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,239
under a billion tons
of steel and concrete.

1179
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,455
What about Omar?

1180
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,964
Termination paperwork.

1181
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,627
And I'll need to get your ID.

1182
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:18,652
Probably he'll end
up in foster care.

1183
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,946
He's not going to a foster home.

1184
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:22,870
He's staying with
Mr. Al Katani tonight.

1185
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,581
And then, he's booked on a
flight to LA tomorrow morning.

1186
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:27,158
Oh, why?

1187
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,090
There's some school there.

1188
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,665
That's what his
father wanted for him.

1189
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,334
That's where
he belongs now.

1190
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:42,092
We like to thank you for all
what you've done with Omar.

1191
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,158
And we ask God

1192
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:47,690
to bless you with
happiness, health,

1193

1195
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:53,915
Have some time with him.

1196

So you gonna be a good kid?

1197
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:12,498
I bought a little

01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:51,446
After a few years, you'll
crawl into bed one night

1257
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:54,138
and realize you don't even
think about him at all of that day.

1258
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,668
But then, every once in a while,

1259
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,650
he'll come to you in
your dreams at night.

1260
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:06,080
And the warm thought of him
will wake you in the morning.

1261
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,000
Will you walk me
on to the plane?

1262
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:19,500
[music]

1263
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,464
And for that little tiny
sliver of the moment,

1264
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,365
he's right there
by your side again.

1265
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:27,612
And nothing...

1266
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:32,626
No other person, no distance or
time can take him away from you.
