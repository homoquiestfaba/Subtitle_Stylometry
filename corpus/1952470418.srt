1
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,924
Find and destroy what stands in the way.

2
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,924
Grandfather?

3
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,824
This makes you weak.

4
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,924
Come.

5
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,924
I saved this for you.

6
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,924
What is it?

7
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,924
A gift.

8
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,924
That amulet is dangerous,

9
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,924
and powerful.

10
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,924
Things change.

11
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,999
A darkness covered the land.

12
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,924
Can not be reversed soon.

13
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,999
The bad is coming from the east.

14
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,999
What will it do us?

15
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,924
The people trying to dominate ...

16
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,924
them to bend,

17
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,924
for his perversity.

18
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,724
Grandfather.

19
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,924
Rachek. My friend.

20
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,999
Arkadi, get some wood for the fire.

21
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,924
Yes, grandfather.

22
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,999
The Red Sun

23
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,999
You can not ignore the forecast.

24
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,924
I know the better prediction
as someone else.

25
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,999
The boy is not ready.

26
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,924
We have no other defense.

27
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,924
The Brotherhood will never accept.

28
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,924
They should, Kirill is stronger every day.

29
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,924
The boy is not ready.

30
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,224
Your pride can not change his fate.

31
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,924
Your failure is not his.

32
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,999
Let him go.

33
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,924
I can not.

34
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,924
Arkadi, go back to the house.

35
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,999
The village is on fire.
We must help them.

36
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,924
The gift that I have given,

37
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,924
should the stones Artu
to be placed.

38
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,924
If I return tomorrow.

39
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,999
To the east, the army job.

40
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,924
Until you reach the tower of Ronbruck.

41
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,924
Look for Maxim,
an old warrior.

42
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,224
He will explain everything.

43
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,624
Rachek, until the boy.

44
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,624
Grandfather.

45
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,924
Arkadi, dive!

46
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,924
Grandfather no!
Arise!

47
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,124
Go! Do as I could.

48
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,924
Grandfather no!
Taci!

49
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,999
Listen!

50
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,924
Find Maxim.
Trust him.

51
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,924
Go! Go! Go!

52
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,924
Let him go.
The boy is not ready.

53
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,924
My men will defend.
They can not protect the west walls.

54
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,024
The king should act.
And he will do.

55
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:58,125
Tovar is not alone.

56
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,224
What is it?

57
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,924
Grandfather is dead.

58
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,924
We have confidence in a guy.

59
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,999
Who is the boy?

60
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,924
I can not say.
Its mission is to remain secret.

61
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,924
Call the townspeople together.
I care for mine.

62
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,924
Our people are now safe.

63
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,924
It is not long until the dragon returns.

64
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,924
Tell the King.

65
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,924
We must give our Guardian some time.

66
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,999
Sir ...

67
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,924
the Keeper is sent.

68
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,924
Then it's time friend.

69
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,924
The red sun marks our end.

70
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,724
But we can not have our Lord
confidence in a boy lay.

71
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,999
We have no choice.

72
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,999
We can at least ...

73
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,924
My whole life I have one
kingdom built.

74
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,924
I have protected the West.

75
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,924
And now, the appreciation of our
world from a boy

76
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,224
But surely Lord.
My men are ready to ride tomorrow.

77
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,924
Yes, my Lord.

78
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,424
Kiril Lord, may I speak.
The king arrives tomorrow morning.

79
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,924
The Grandfather has chosen the Keeper.

80
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,999
My Lord,

81
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,924
The boy brings news of the enemy.

82
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,999
Your majesty, I am by Arkady Tovar.

83
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,999
Who sent you?

84
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,999
Grandfather ...

85
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,924
before he died.

86
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,924
You may leave us.

87
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,924
Where did you say, you're sent Grandfather.

88
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,924
To Ronbruck
Maxim to find.

89
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,924
Then my men
this pass defense.

90
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,924
We will keep him
as long as we can.

91
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,924
Make haste.

92
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,924
The enemy is approaching us quickly.

93
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,924
You need to Ronbruck flights.

94
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,924
We will continue.

95
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,924
Forward march!

96
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,924
Forward!

97
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,924
Connect with me.

98
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,924
I will not be your slave.

99
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,924
Why destroy everything you built.
Why give up your kingdom?

100
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,999
Why do you force your people to such fate.

101
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,999
Let them live!

102
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,224
You will not break my spirit.

103
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,699
Idiot.

104
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,500
Where is the Keeper?

105
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,500
For the Keeper!

106
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,500
For Humanity!

107
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,924
What's in the bag, boy?

108
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,624
Tea Leaves.

109
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,025
Teas.

110
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,924
You know who we are?

111
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,924
We Tovar.

112
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,924
And we take what we want.

113
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,999
Not worth fighting for a mercenary.

114
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,999
Wait.

115
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,999
Where you going?

116
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,924
My name is Arkady,
I'm looking for Ronbruck.

117
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,999
Ronbruck belongs to Tovar mercenaries ...

118
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,924
wise if you returns home.

119
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,924
Wait.

120
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,924
Go home.

121
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,924
I have no home.

122
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,924
Destroyed.

123
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,999
I can not help you.

124
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,924
Looking for Maxim.

125
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,924
Who sent you?

126
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,924
Grandfather.

127
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,924
I know your name.

128
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,924
Katya.

129
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,924
Katya?

130
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,924
The Guardian.

131
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,924
Maxim?

132
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,999
For centuries,

133
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,924
harmony was held by
a group of monks ...

134
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,924
... called the Brotherhood.

135
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,999
She loved the truth.

136
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,924
and science.

137
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,924
She studied virtue.

138
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,924
Everyone except one.

139
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,999
Kirill.

140
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,999
For him,

141
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,999
harmony was not enough.

142
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,924
He left the Order ...

143
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,924
and became a master of dark arts.

144
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,324
He stole the stone Antiphises,
a great force against virtue.

145
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,924
A major threat to humanity.

146
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,924
So ...

147
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,924
... the leader of the Order,

148
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,924
banished the apostate.

149
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,999
He foresaw the virtue of the stone,

150
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,924
ancient relics of unprecedented knowledge.

151
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,924
He had success and found the
stone of patience,

152
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,924
vigilance and abstinence.,

153
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,924
calmness, generosity and kindness.

154
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,924
But his name was announced ...

155
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,924
grabbed his heart and pride.

156
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,924
He was blind,

157
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,924
the greatest gift of all:

158
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,924
humanity.

159
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,924
Thus shirk his duties.

160
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,924
In science

161
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,924
he ...

162
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,924
someone prepared ...

163
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,924
to succeed

164
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,209
where he failed.

165
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,909
Are you listening?
-Yes

166
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,909
I listened.

167
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,924
But I do not know what this
me to do.

168
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,924
You're a great honor conferred.
Why not take that seriously?

169
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,924
Because nobody asked me.

170
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,924
You must succeed.

171
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,999
If you fail

172
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,924
will destroy you seen
have total.

173
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,924
The whole world will perish in flames.

174
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,924
How can the stones of virtue
beat the dragon?

175
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,924
Excuse me ...

176
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,924
What am I doing?

177
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,924
Never turn your back on an enemy.

178
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,924
Why did not Grandfather
I was a Keeper?

179
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,924
Because you

180
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,924
not finished.

181
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,999
He said I was weak.

182
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,924
Then his evidence to the contrary.

183
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,999
A good idea,

184
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,924
We start here.

185
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,024
Have you ever learned from
a blind man to fight?

186
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,224
You will learn to think,

187
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,999
you will learn to fight,

188
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,924
and you will learn the proper respect.

189
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,924
They will first test.

190
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,924
You will learn the power ...

191
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,924
of patience.

192
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,924
Where are we heading?

193
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,999
What we are is just as important ...

194
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,924
as we go.

195
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,924
Tell me something.

196
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,224
By the time the stone back
in the Brotherhood,

197
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,924
They have lost their power.

198
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,924
They should be together,

199
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,924
not separately.

200
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,924
The first stone was lost here.

201
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,924
So all I do is here
go and tackle the stone?

202
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,924
Is that all?

203
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,924
How hard can it be?

204
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,924
The stone?

205
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,924
You can not succeed if you do not
by the rules of virtue.

206
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,924
Control your power.

207
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,924
Well, one idiot took power.

208
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,024
But this is only the first step.

209
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,924
You have knowledge of the Keeper.

210
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,924
Now!

211
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,999
Tell me his name.

212
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,924
Leave me!

213
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,999
Tell me where he is.

214
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,924
Leave me.

215
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,024
Tell me his name!

216
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,324
Breathe in obscurity.

217
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,924
Let it consume you.

218
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,924
I listen.

219
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,924
His name is Arkady.

220
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,424
It is led by a knight
of the Brotherhood.

221
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,724
He follows the river to the east,
through the valley.

222
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,999
Can I ask you something?

223
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,999
What?

224
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,924
Why I am the Keeper?

225
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,924
Just because my Grandfather chose?

226
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,924
Is not that enough?

227
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,999
Why he chose me?

228
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,924
You ask many questions.

229
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,999
Why are you not the Keeper?

230
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,924
Because I was not chosen.

231
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,924
You're not what I expected.

232
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,924
Then, help me.

233
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,924
Can I ask you,
I want this.

234
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,924
The sun is in motion.

235
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,924
We would also have.

236
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,924
Young man?

237
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,924
Hedona, my beloved ...

238
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,924
you know I am older ...

239
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,999
or whose children have kids.

240
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,924
Young Timmy!

241
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,924
Hello, Hedona.

242
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,924
Long ago.

243
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,924
And who is this being pretty?

244
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,524
We have a lot of lilies
need in your bathtub, tonight.

245
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,724
Come.

246
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:36,525
My beloved is necessary,
He will shudder as the flames cut back ...

247
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:40,147
He will have to move to stay warm.

248
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:02,230
Each of the stones has a
specic place in the amulet.

249
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,999
What is that?

250
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,924
This?

251
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,924
I already know I long.

252
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,924
The bath is ready.

253
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,299
Arkani, I will help you.

254
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,924
Do not be shy.

255
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,999
I made this for you.

256
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,924
It is hot.

257
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,924
Sorry.

258
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,924
I can not.

259
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,924
You still stink.

260
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,924
I know.

261
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,924
So fast, Maxim.

262
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,899
Hedona.

263
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,324
Dear, dear children.

264
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,424
Young man I got something for you.

265
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,724
You've earned it.

266
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:06,425
You are driven,
but you're a good boy.

267
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,324
Very respected.

268
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,924
What do you want?

269
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,999
The Guardian must be stopped.

270
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,999
How?

271
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,924
Win his heart, his mind bending ...

272
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,999
crushing his strength.

273
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,924
Yes Lord.

274
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,924
Good morning my friend.

275
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,924
The bed is not soft,
but meets the toilet.

276
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,924
Where are we?

277
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,199
In the forest.

278
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,324
Prisoners of Tovar.

279
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,524
I Arkadi.

280
00:43:46,025 --> 00:43:47,725
Superboy, hé.

281
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,924
You may call me ..

282
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,924
Stranger.

283
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,924
Do you have news of King agmar?

284
00:44:01,325 --> 00:44:03,125
You said the king.

285
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,999
Yes.

286
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,924
He and his army are dead.

287
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,524
Slain by Tovar,
and the dragon.

288
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,999
Kirill ...

289
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,924
He once belonged to the Brotherhood ...

290
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,924
let rise until the dragon.

291
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,999
He crushed the Brotherhood,
He and his evil men.

292
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,999
His army was ...

293
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,924
and destroyed everything the Brotherhood

294
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,924
and bosmensen had made.

295
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,924
The community they had built ...

296
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,524
knowledge, confidence and wisdom.
And .. and freedom.

297
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,924
You're crazy.

298
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,924
You're not my friend.

299
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,699
Get up.

300
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,999
I'm not going sideways for goats.

301
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,924
I said, get up, get up.

302
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,924
I have the keys.

303
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,924
Beware.

304
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,924
Come with me.

305
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,924
This way, this.

306
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,924
Come on, quickly.

307
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,924
Now is no need to
call me stranger.

308
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,224
We have expelled Tovar.
For here.

309
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,924
And if you ...

310
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,924
I reward you,

311
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,924
with a part of our treasure.

312
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,924
With this I can buy Tovar,

313
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,924
for your amulet.

314
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,924
Thank you

315
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,924
The dragon, go, go, everybody.

316
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,924
The dragon has burned everything ...

317
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,024
all villages along the river.,
between here and Sulvan.

318
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,924
He seeks something.

319
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:34,725
The Tovar follow him and fall
what they encounter

320
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,924
There is a town in the east,
not affected.

321
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:39,425
We warn them.

322
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,999
Go you.

323
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,999
I can help.

324
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,924
We are always the weakest,

325
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,924
if we feel the strongest.

326
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,924
No, we will go.

327
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,924
You should go on this way,

328
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,924
until you have found shelter.

329
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,924
You will know.

330
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,924
We will join with you.
Show us this way.

331
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,424
Katya, tell them.

332
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,999
What took you so long.

333
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,924
You make jokes.

334
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,999
Do you know what is in the cave?

335
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,999
I know.

336
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,924
Many people have been felled in that cave.

337
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,924
But not the Keeper.
- Let go.

338
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,999
Are you OK?

339
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,224
My village.
Everything is gone.

340
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,924
Bread, quick.

341
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,999
Eat this.

342
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,999
Thank you, thank you

343
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,999
There is a place not far from here.

344
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,924
Can you walk?

345
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,924
Come on, get up.

346
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,999
You need that way, on the mountain.

347
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,924
You meet the others.

348
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,924
They have nothing, but you're not alone.

349
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,924
Good luck.
Thank-you

350
00:57:16,025 --> 00:57:17,025
Wait!

351
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,924
Take this.

352
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,924
Share it with others.

353
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,924
This was the wise man in the village ..

354
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,924
It belongs to him by virtue searches.

355
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,025
Thank you.

356
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,924
I sense change.

357
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,924
Stop.

358
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,924
Peaceful friend.

359
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,024
Remember him?

360
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,899
Yes, he is from my village.

361
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,959
Yes, yes you're Grandfather 's boy.

362
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,959
I'm Anson.

363
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,959
You may be a hot meal and
some drinking.

364
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,959
He will do well.

365
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,524
Who is he?

366
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,825
A noble man, a friend of Angmar.

367
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,924
A friend of everyone.

368
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,924
Arkadi.

369
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,999
Yes.

370
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,924
There is not much time.

371
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,924
But we must still make a camp.

372
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,999
A good night sleep and hot food.

373
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,224
Then we suited for the trip.

374
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,924
Go.

375
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,999
You've proven that you have virtue.

376
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,924
Remember ...

377
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,924
too much confidence in yourself,

378
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,924
the end of virtue.

379
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,924
Arkadi, come.

380
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,924
Are you not?

381
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,924
We will come there.

382
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,924
Thank you

383
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,004
Certainly are dark days,
as a man to use violence

384
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,504
to have a hot meal,
and a drink.

385
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,924
And you have not yet met the women.

386
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,999
Come bedtime.

387
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,424
Perhaps, I can sleep tonight.
Your strong stories fill my dreams.

388
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,924
Good night.

389
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,924
It is amazing that you've come so far.

390
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,324
I know who you are.

391
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:36,025
I pretended I knew nothing

392
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,999
Grandfather told me everything.

393
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,999
You're it ...

394
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,924
Such power and yet so young.

395
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,999
My companions helped.

396
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,924
Of course.

397
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,924
Grandfather and I have talked a lot ...

398
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,924
about your options.

399
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,924
Most of the stones are found,
of course.

400
01:01:00,225 --> 01:01:01,225
Zoja.

401
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,924
Do you think it is enough to
to save us?

402
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,924
I hope so.

403
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,324
There are only a few people who
can say that they possess true virtue.

404
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,124
Do you believe that your virtue has, Arkady?

405
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,924
Come on.

406
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,924
This mirror can reveal many things.

407
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,924
Tell me what you see.

408
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,924
Breathe in the darkness.

409
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,924
Let it consume you.

410
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,924
Wait!

411
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,924
Guardian ...

412
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,924
You're a great warrior.

413
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,924
Bigger than the boy.

414
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,924
You are the guardians.

415
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,924
The virtues in the stone ...

416
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:28,924
correspond to the virtues in man.

417
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,924
The power ...

418
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,924
is in you.

419
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,924
My name ...

420
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,924
Maxim is.

421
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,924
I'm from the country viros.

422
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:11,025
At the foot of the mountain Drakor.

423
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,224
We are a stubborn people.

424
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,924
However, we are proud.

425
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,724
No!

426
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,924
We come as friends.

427
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,924
We carry the news of the knight Maxim.

428
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,924
This is all he left behind.

429
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,924
You're very gentle.

430
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,924
Thank you

431
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,924
There is not much time left.

432
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,924
We must go.

433
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,999
Why are we here?

434
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,999
Kirill's army passes still ahead.

435
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,924
We stay here until tomorrow.

436
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,924
The dragon will not see us.

437
01:11:27,225 --> 01:11:28,925
There is a stone,
and I can find.

438
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,924
Arkadi trust, we must stay here tonight.

439
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,924
If everything fails, as long as you trust me,
then we have hope.

440
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,924
Katya!

441
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,924
Take me to Kirill.

442
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,924
The Guardian has failed the last
stone found.

443
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,924
Yes, my Lord.

444
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,924
You did good.

445
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,924
Thank you, my Lord.

446
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,924
Now there is nothing left in my way.

447
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,924
Katya!, Katya!

448
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,924
She has failed you, Guardian.

449
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,924
No!

450
01:15:30,525 --> 01:15:32,525
Take her to the pit.

451
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,999
No, let her!

452
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,999
Katya!

453
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,924
I agree.

454
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,999
Katya, it's not you.

455
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,924
Katya Tarkadi.

456
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,924
It's not you.

457
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,924
If you insist boy ...

458
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,224
to prove yourself.

459
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,924
So you can lose your loved ones.

460
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,924
Your world is dying ...

461
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,924
and I give life.

462
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,999
Behold ...

463
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,924
my strength.

464
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,924
The virtue in the stone ...

465
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,424
corresponds to the virtues,
in man.

466
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,924
The power lies in you.

467
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:54,324
We did it, Grandpa.
