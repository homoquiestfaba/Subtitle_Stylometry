SINGER: Well, I've been walking
these soulless streets long

3
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:30,856
enough now to see
some broken dreams,

4
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,298
but I still got a little
faith and a reason to believe.

5
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,779
So pack your things and
come along for the ride.

6
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:44,392
It's just up the road
down the Miracle Mile.

00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:51,138
We can dance with Lady Luck,
and baby, the joker's wild.

Yeah, we're going down to
where the water is wine.

Whoa-ho, the top of the world.

13
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:15,727
Now, I'm tired of doing
time dying on my feet.

00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:19,166
And my body is still
shaking from this heat.

15
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:24,780
It's the same old story
about a brother raking it in.

16
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:26,738
No, you're just fading out.

17
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:29,654
I'll be spinning the wheel
and rolling the dice.

18

gonna let it ride,

back when honey, the time

We're going straight--

I know how this works.

42
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,834
You're trying to push me out
because I'm a little guy--

00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,097
take my business, my car lot.

44
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,490
You can't take my lot.

45
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:07,752
My wife is sick.

46
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:09,189
I need that lot.

47
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:16,674
Mel, if I may, you've
had a run of bad luck.

48
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,415
And it's terrible.

49
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:25,814
You lost 40 straight hands of
blackjack to the casino, Mel.

50
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:28,947
Not to Mr. Atlas.

51
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,253
You could shoot Mr. Atlas.

52
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,646
Then you could shoot me.

53
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,604
You could go downstairs
and shoot everybody

54
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,997
on the blackjack table.

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,176
But you'd still own
this casino $129,000.

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,222
Look, I got friends.

57
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,180
I got-- I got a lot
of juice back home.

58
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,442
You know who I am?

salesman from Idaho.

61
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:52,884
And they're barely used cars,
not one over seven years old.

62
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:58,542
Mel, with or without
me, this casino

63
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,545
is coming after its money.

64
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,286
You will lose your
home, you will

65
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,203
lose what's left of
your barely used cars,

66
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,555
you will lose personally
your car barely used.

67
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,558
They will take your
wife's wedding ring,

68
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:16,299
and she will lose
that off her finger.

69
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:20,303
And if this kills
both of you, they

70
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:22,697
will take the organs
from your body

71
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,961
and sell them until
the numbers balance.

72
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:29,486
The casino will keep
coming after you.

Get stuff for me, man!

Hey, kiss your
mother for me, huh?

She must have
got held up, huh?

Yeah.

busy all day, Ray.

No, you have to do this.

They're all from his wife.

He got all these letters,
and none of them are opened.

109
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:20,292
You must have made
some special arrangements

110

for somebody somewhere
along the way.

111
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,036

Yeah.

00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:57,721
OK.

122
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,070
Well, this is the
time for you to make

123
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,202
a very important decision.

124
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,512
This is push comes
to shove time.

125
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:09,167
Now, are you the man
who's going to do

126
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:12,475
whatever it takes to provide
for his wife, his family?

127
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:19,177
Well, I was thinking more or
less along the lines of a-- a--

128
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:22,964
a loan payment plan.

129

No, this is the only way, Mel.

130
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:32,800
OK.

131
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,019
But I might come back tonight.

132
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:35,846
I understand.

133
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:57,477
We know you'll do
the right thing, Mel.

134
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,046
And Mel, don't take that
gun down into the casino.

135
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,308
We frown on that.

136
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,539
You know, I--

137
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,934
I remember a time when
you would have shot him

138
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,023
and make it look like a suicide.

139
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,938
I know.

140
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:26,941
I know.

141
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,639
I'm gonna go get his signature
and send it down to the county.

142
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:30,553
You do that.

143
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:31,685
You be careful, too.

144
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,209
We're on the top
of the world now.

145
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,558
We want to stay there.

146
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:38,648
It's a big payday for us today.

147
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,476

RAY: Something I gotta do.

151
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,582
Couldn't you have
done that inside?

152
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:02,150
I guess I could have,
but I would have been shot.

153
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:04,848

you're off state property.

I-5 during rush hour

Yeah.

160
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:21,996
Well, they still charged
me $50 to tow it.

161
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,910
So where'd you get this one?

162
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:26,217
Hm?

163
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:30,918
You look great.

164
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,535
You know, you could have
done this alone with one

165
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,972
of those absentee things.

166
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,192
Yeah, well, I wanted
to end this clean, OK?

Face to face, like
we started it.

to a last meal and a smoke.

day he gets out of prison,

00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,076
drives him to Vegas
for a divorce--

174
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,425
what do you call
that, a reprieve?

175
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:25,581
They're here.

176

- Perfect timing.
- Come on, guys.

177
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:32,283
We don't got all night.

178
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,110
Let's get moving.

179
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,332
Hey, man.

180
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,509
You got another smoke?

181
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,946
Yeah, I got one.

182
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,947
Hey, cowboys.

183
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:44,731
What's up?

184
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,781
It's red.

185
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,653
You're supposed to be dressed
like a security guard.

186
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,045
No, man.
You said maintenance.

187
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,568
No, man.
I said a security guard.

188
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:57,482
You said maintenance.

189
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:58,527
I said security guard.

190
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,138
This is not part of the plan.

191
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,532
Get in here before
somebody sees you.

192
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:04,925
What is this, an armored
truck convention?

193
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:06,709
Get in here.

194
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,755
You and I will talk later.
You said maintenance.

195
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,060
I said security.

196
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:11,235
This way.
Come on.

197
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,759
Come on.

198
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:14,848
Come on, hurry up!

199
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:17,502
Do you realize that
almost every job we go on,

200
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,897
you kill everybody?

201
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,507
So?

202
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,335
Well, I'm thinking
that that jeopardizes

203
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,816
us a little more than this.

204
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,818
That really hurts me, man.

205
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:31,603
Listen to me, Carl, I am not
going one step further here

206
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:33,344
until you promise
me that you are not

207
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,216
going to kill anybody
in here that you

208
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,739
do not absolutely have to.

209
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:37,522
Now, promise me.

210
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,876
Hey, Carl.

211
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,790
Promise him.

212
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:49,796
OK.

213
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,622
I promise.

214
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,497
I promise.

215
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,977
That I will not kill anybody.

216
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:04,245
That I will not--

217
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,507
kill anybody--

218
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,857
That I do not
absolutely have to kill.

219
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:18,476
[FORCED] That I do not
absolutely have to kill.

220
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,347
I love you, man.

221
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,652
You know what?

222
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:21,610
I don't care what
they say about you.

223
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:25,005
Come on!

224
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:31,402
[thud]

225
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,883
God, I hit something.

226
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,667
Just-- just pull over baby.

227
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,800
Just hang on.

228
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:38,670
Just hang on.

229
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:42,805
What is it?

230
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,416
Hang on, hang on.

231
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,809
What is it?

232
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:47,854
I don't see anything.

233
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:49,464
I don't think you hit anything.

234
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,292
Maybe it was a stick or
something off the bumper maybe.

235
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:53,685
A piece of tire or something.
- No.

236
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:56,253
I must have killed
something, I'm sure.

237
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,515
You didn't hit
anything, Rebecca.

238
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,908
I'm sure I must
have killed something.

239
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,867
There's nothing there.

240
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,737
I don't see anything.

241
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:08,613
It's nothing, baby.

242
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:12,008
Why couldn't you just have
kept your mouth shut, huh?

243
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,314
Come on, come on, come on.

244
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,489
We've been down this already.

245
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:17,100
Come on.

246
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:20,060
Lots of cops have taken
money and lived with it, Ray.

247
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:22,584
Rebecca, we're not talking
about parking meter kickbacks

248
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:23,890
or pinball machines, baby.

249
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:24,716
Come on.

250
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,289
I'm just so tired.

251
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,256
I'm tired of believing somebody
is going to be there for me.

252
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:49,089
I'm tired of not being
able to trust anybody.

253
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:57,271
I'm just-- I didn't hear
from you for four years, Ray.

254
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:58,185
I know.

255
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,799
I know.

256
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,193
[sobbing]

257
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,891
No!

258
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:11,894
I'm not the same person.

259
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:14,375
That hug and that
rocking thing you do

260
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:15,942
is not going to make it anymore.

261
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,603
You got a guy?

262
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:26,953
[scoff]

263
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:34,264
Right.

264
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:40,009
Want me to drive?

265
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,402
No, I'm fine.

266
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:50,324
Wow, wow, wow!

267
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,803
Looked like the Plaza Hotel.

268
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:55,895
Man, we had a lot of fun
in that place, didn't we?

269
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,244
I don't remember.

270
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,034
Do you have a place to
stay after we do this?

271
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,427
Just drop me at a hotel.

272
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,646
I'll be fine.

273
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,778
Which one?

274
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:10,648
Doesn't matter.

275
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,041
I got $51.

276
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:14,087
Any one will do.

277
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:20,267
$51 in Vegas on
a peak weekend?

278
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,572
You've been in jail too long.

279
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,328
Uh, don't go anywhere.

280
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,461
I'm just going to run into
the casino and get some cash.

281
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:41,941
I'll be right back out.

282
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,290
There's something
you gotta know, baby,

283
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,378
something I gotta tell you.

284
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,250
I don't have time right now.

285
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:50,210
How'd you like to be that pole
up in the Cowboy Cabaret, huh?

286
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:51,776
Oh, you said it.

287
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,040
You better check
that connection.

288
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,476
Not while she's on.

289
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,346
Yeah.

290
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,481
Tell me that ain't a knockout.

291
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:01,482
MAN: Yeah.

292
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,092
That's ain't a knockout.

293
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,876
[zapping]

294
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:07,967
That is a knockout.

295
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,331
Sorry, you gotta get out.

296
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,419
I can't take you with me, pal.

297
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:26,768
We're not going to be long.

298
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,465
She's just using the
cash machine inside.

299
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,294
Look, either I park it, or
you park it out on the street.

300
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,296
It'll only be a minute, man.

301
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,558
It goes or you go.

302
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:35,907
Listen, I'm not
allowed in here.

303
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:37,387
See, it's a gaming house and--

304
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,650
Whatever you're going
to tell me, I've heard it.

305
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,652
I lost my license
when I was in prison.

306
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:42,523
Oh, no shit.

307
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:43,524
Yeah.

308
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,438
That's funny.

309
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:45,352
It never stopped me.

310
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,006
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

311
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,007
I used to steal cars.

312
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,051
Now I park them.

313
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,096
So what's it going to be, pal?

314
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,533
Come on, I'm working alone here.

315
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:53,838
I feel for you.

316
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,971
Keep it close, huh?

317
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,885
Here.

318
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,060
Take this.

319
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,018
You won't get your
car without it.

Where were you?

332
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,153
Just taking a nap.

333
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:50,199
A nap?

334
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:51,374
How about dinner?

335
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,202
If you give me
an hour to bathe.

336
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,421
Right.

Why?

339
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,687
Well, I mean, every
time I call you,

340
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,472
you say you're
taking a fucking nap.

341
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,039
Don't start with me, Charlie.

about you, pussy cat.

He's new on the round.

368
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,392
They're both new
in different jobs.

369
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:37,176
Actually, we're
here to rob the place.

370
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:44,139
[chuckling]

371
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,576
We're gonna rob the place!

372
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,885
[laughter]

373
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,848
Come on, Henry.

374
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:58,632
Go!

375
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,203
It's me, Joe.

376
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,249
Open up.

377
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,599
[buzzer]

378
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:11,558
Hey!

379
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:15,518
What is that?

380
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,088
[inaudible].

381
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:23,439
[explosion]

382
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,317
[phone ringing]

383
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,058
Atlas.

384
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,016
Yeah, Charlie.

385
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,887
I'm in Ridgefield's room.

386
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:39,281
Yeah?

387
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,327
Well, did you get his signature?

388
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,676
Yeah, right after
he left your office.

389
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,808
ATLAS [ON PHONE]: So
why are you there?

390
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:45,983
I'm waiting for the cops.

391
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,463
Oh, fuck.

392
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,596
No, that's where we need, huh?

393
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:50,423
The fucking cops.

394
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,125
Great smoke bomb.

395
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,605
How was I supposed
to know it was a dud?

396
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,433
I thought we weren't
supposed to kill anybody.

397
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:01,303
We weren't.

398
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:02,478
I made a promise.

399
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:03,653
Yeah, but you
made the promise.

400
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,002
I didn't promise shit.
- Come on.

401
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:06,265
Let's go.
- Hey.

402
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,657
Hey, hey.
Hey.

403
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,224
Who's supposed to say let's go?

404
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,094
You are?

405
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:11,008
Yeah.

406
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:12,227
You know why?

407
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,272
Because you're the boss?

408
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,185
Exceptional intellect.

409
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:15,099
Open the door.

410
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,628
Woo--

411
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:22,629
Baby!

412
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,108
Gentlemen?

413
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:27,503
[music playing]

414
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:35,511
Hey.

415
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:38,035
Hey!

416
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,515
This ain't a football
field, you know?

417
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,690
Oy, oy, oy.
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:41,952
I'm really, really sorry.
I, uh--

419
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,650
Yeah, well, sorry
don't walk a dog.

420
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:44,651
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:46,435
Let me give you a hand here.

422
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,523
Give me your cup.

423
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,307
I'll help you.

424
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:53,834
Hey, are you somebody?

425
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:56,184
Well, my mother
likes to think so.

426
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:57,925
Well, you know, there's
only two kinds of guys

427
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,230
that wear suits in Vegas--

428
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,536
that's high rollers
and pit bosses.

429
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,059
Oh, yeah?

430
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,409
Well, the pit boss, he'd
be staring at my tips.

431
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:06,107
And a high roller, he'd
be staring at my tits.

432
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm looking right at
you, and I just can't

433
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:08,979
tell what you're staring at.

434
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:10,329
Well, honey,
where I just been,

435
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,113
you get in a lot of
trouble for staring.

436
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:13,462
What's your name?

437
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,376
Ginger.

438
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,377
Ginger.

439
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,771
Ginger, do me a favor, will you?

440
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:18,946
I'm not allowed to gamble.

441
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:19,990
As a matter of
fact, I'm not even

442
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,688
supposed to be in this place.

443
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,298
And I just wondered if you'd
just walk up to these here two,

444
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,041
20s, very lucky they are,
put them in this machine,

445
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:29,913
pull that lever, I'll split
whatever I win with you 50-50.

446
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:30,827
What do you say?

447
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,220
[chuckling]

448
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:33,395
I'm not supposed to be
playing that either.

449
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,875
Come on.
You're my lucky star.

450
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:36,355
Just walk up, put the two
20s in, pull the lever,

451
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,008
we win, you get half.

452
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:39,358
Oh, what the hell?

453
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,408
Come on, Mac.
You sleeping again?

454
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:47,366
Come on, Mac.

455
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,150
Wake up, buddy.

456
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,586
Hey!

457
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,066
Holy shit.

458
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,241
Hey, open up in there.

459
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,069
I think Louis' had
a heart attack.

460
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,026
- Shit.
- It's all right.

461
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,288
It's all right.

462
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,203
Just a little improvisation, OK?
- Shit.

463
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,161
Fred'll get it.

464
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:01,075
[buzzer]

465
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:01,858
Come on in.

466
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,607
Oh, yeah.

467
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:12,434
Sure.

468
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:16,612
Oh, yeah.

469
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:19,441
That's your fault. Hey.

470
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:22,183
Our turn.

471
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:23,967
- Cross your fingers.
- All righty.

472
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,012
Take it slow.

473
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:27,101
Slow and easy.

474
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:27,928
OK.

475
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:35,979
Come on, daddy-o.

476
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:37,459
Do it now.
Do it now.

477
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:38,417
Do it seven.

478
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,031
Shit.

479
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:44,988
Well, you got another turn.

480
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:45,902
You got the touch.

481
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,338
This is so exciting.

482
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:49,253
You were supposed to be
waiting in the car, Ray.

483
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:50,994
Well, your car is not
much bigger than my cell.

484
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:52,953
And by the way, how long does
it take you to a cash machine?

485
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:53,910
- I'll take that.
- Wait a minute.

486
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:55,564
Hang on a second.

487
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:56,696
Well, I've got your cash
now, so let's get on with it.

488
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:57,697
You get on with it.
I'm busy.

489
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,524
Hang on a second.
Do the--

490
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,482
Don't do this, Ray.

491
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:01,483
You promised me.

492
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,093
In and out, no scenes.

493
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,530
Well, I've changed my mind,
and now I'm in the middle

494
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:05,792
of something, and I gotta--
- And I gotta go.

495
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:06,880
- Hang on one second.
- You know what?

496
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,229
I'm leaving.

497
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:09,491
I'll just let the
lawyers take care of it.

498
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,188
- And I've got to go.
- Wait a minute.

499
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:11,972
What is the bug up your ass
about trying to get rid of me?

500
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:12,189
Hang on a second.

501
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:24,811
Take it easy.
- Excuse me.

502
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:25,942
Have we got a
little problem here?

503
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,291
I've got no problem.

504
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:28,162
I'm in the middle of
a conversation here,

505
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:28,858
a private conversation.

506
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:30,251
Do you mind?

507
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:31,948
Why don't you take
your personal problems

508
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:33,515
or domestic problems, whatever
they are, outside the hotel?

509
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,212
Why don't you take that
pistol and put it where

510
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:36,257
you can really have fun, pal?

511
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,737
I'm talking to my wife here.

512
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,869
Why don't you just come
on over here with me, pal?

513
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:40,653
Hey!

514
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:45,919
Pull the machine, baby.

515
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:47,137
Pull the lever on the machine.

516
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:47,921
What?

517
00:24:57,974 --> 00:24:59,454
[bells and whistles]

518
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,891
Oh, my god.

519
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,414
Ray?

520
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:07,375
Ray, the jackpot.

521
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:10,378
Oh, my god.

522
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:12,815
MAN: Hey, that should
have been my jackpot.

523
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,251
REBECCA: You hit the
big jackpot, Ray.

524
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:21,781
Holy shit.

525
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:23,913
Here.

526
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:26,176
Call housekeeping and tell them
I told them to send you home.

527
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,351
OK, gracias.

528
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:28,657
Take these chips,
cash them out.

529
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:29,658
I don't want you
spending them, all right?

530
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:30,616
No gambling.

531
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,486
Si, se or.

532
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,665
Yeah, Brenda give me a key.

533
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:40,190
Rome, Spain, Madrid, Bangkok,
Hong Kong before the commies

534
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,105
really screwed up.
- Ray?

535
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:43,672
Lamborghini.

536
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:46,196
Remember what you
were asking me earlier?

537
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,458
Yellow.

538
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,025
Fly yellow.

539
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:51,898
Whether I had a guy.

540
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:05,302
Mm, I love a woman
right out of a bathtub.

541
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:17,358
Ah, congratulations on $400,000.

542
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,228
Ooh.

543
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:19,229
450.

544
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:20,883
Oh, yeah?

545
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:21,710
Have you two met?

546
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:34,418
Excuse me.

547
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:35,376
Damn.

548
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:37,204
Now, this one used a gun.

549
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:38,945
Well, why didn't he just
jump like everybody else?

550
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,864
Hm, you guys must
have finally locked

551
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:46,343
down the windows in here, huh?

552
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:47,170
Yeah.

553
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:52,654
Say, did Atlas ever get
the roof of his car fixed?

554
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,090
Uh, no.

555
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:56,049
That-- that wasn't why
they locked them down.

556
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:58,617
Last joker took the plunge
just missed a broad.

557
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,009
Killed her dog.

558
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,881
Yeah, I heard about that.

559
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:04,231
Isn't she suing you?

560
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,146
Yeah, 100 grand.

561
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:08,670
Jesus, 100 grand.

562
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:12,282
What kind of a dog
is worth 100 G's?

563
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,676
You know, it was hard to tell.

564
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,851
It was a small dog.

565
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,600
All is well.

566
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,862
Get the truck started.

567
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,255
They're on their way, boys.
Let's go.

568
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:29,735
Open it up.
Go, go, go, go.

569
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:42,922
You know, Ray, the high
rollers, movie stars,

570
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:44,184
sports figures--

571
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:46,621
they're the perks
in this business.

572
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,667
You know who the backbone is?

573
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,538
Tell me.

574
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,106
It's the little guy.

575
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:55,369
They keep flocking to me.

576
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,501
They keep flocking to me.

577
00:27:57,545 --> 00:28:00,069
With that pull on
that nickel slot,

578
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:03,769
that keno card over breakfast.

579
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:06,336
They keep coming to, uh--

580
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,905
to where the Jesus of luck
may tap them on the shoulder

581
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:11,733
and say, you're the one.

582
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:14,214
You're chosen.

583
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:16,346
Your fate has changed.

584
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,047
You're standing on
top of the world.

585
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,353
Yeah.

586
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:26,139
We're going to
drink to you, Ray--

587
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:29,011
to one of the little guys.

588
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:32,188
I'm grateful.

589
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:33,450
What will you have?

590
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:34,669
Nothing.

591
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,062
Pussy cat?

592
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:38,368
Uh-uh.

593
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:40,240
Uh-huh.

594
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:42,677
I didn't catch your
last name, Ray.

595
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,983
Mercer.

596
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:44,853
Mercer?

597
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:46,550
Mercer?

598
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:48,988
Mercer, how does
that ring a bell?

599
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:50,293
Hey, that's your
last name, Mercer.

600
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,082
Are you guys pulling my leg?

601
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,520
You're the brother, huh,
that she talks about.

602
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,870
No.

603
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,045
You're related.

604
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,438
Not by blood.

605
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,395
She's my wife.

606
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:06,832
Ex-wife.

607
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,660
Not yet.

608
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:12,620
He's right, Becky.

609
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:15,971
If you were his ex-wife,
you probably wouldn't

610
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:18,321
still be using the name Mercer.

611
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:19,670
Would the two of you
like a moment alone?

612
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:27,722
All right.

613
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,726
Putting on a little late.

614
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,510
Yeah, I'm as slim as ever.

615
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:35,338
Hey, uh, you guys
new on this route?

616
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:36,687
I am, yeah.

617
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:38,689
- Yeah, it's his first day.
- All right.

618
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:41,344
Hey, Joe, you're getting a
little green under the gills.

619
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,258
You OK?

620
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:43,694
Yeah.

621
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:44,783
Well, I think this job's
starting to get to me.

622
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:45,696
Yeah, OK.

623
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,828
All right.

624
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,438
Hey, wait a minute.

625
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,919
What's this, uh,
red stuff I see?

626
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,834
Deal with it, Carl.

627
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:55,576
It's blood, stupid.

628
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:56,533
Shit!

629
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:57,796
[gunfire]

630
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,362
Oh, this just
keeps getting better.

631
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:00,233
Wait.

632
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:01,800
[cocking gun]

633
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,193
Can't leave this stuff working.

634
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:10,678
I heard when someone
jumps out of a window when

635
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,680
they hit the concrete,
they bounce and then

636
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:14,421
they pop, just like that.

637
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,162
MAN [ON RADIO]: We've
got a 13 on level two.

638
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:17,424
Yeah, we copy that.

639
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:18,512
We're on our way.
Come on, let's go.

640
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:19,426
Great.

641
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:20,470
Excuse us, folks.

642
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,559
What the hell's a 13?

643
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,474
Suicide's a 12,
robbery's a 13.

644
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,868
We keep them real close to
each other for a reason.

645
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,087
Damn.

646
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,176
Learn something new every day.

647
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:31,090
Hey, Fipps?

648
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,004
What?

649
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:34,180
What's a 13 again?

650
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:35,094
Shit.

651
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,008
That's a 13.

652
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,096
Get down, man.

653
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:39,925
[gunfire]

654
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:51,066
I'm not getting killed for any
4.50 an hour and all I can eat.

655
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,982
Well, it doesn't
feel like rubber.

656
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:57,725
Yeah, we'll-- we'll
take a couple of snaps.

657
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,335
I'm not too wild
about photographs.

658
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:01,207
Why don't you just give me
the real check, and-- whew--

659
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,251
I'll be right out of your hair.

660
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:03,470
Nah.

661
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:06,821
For 450 large, I
need a little boost.

662
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,216
Take a couple of pictures,
you know, and an interview

663
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,826
won't hurt you, Ray.

664
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,307
Well, actually, you
should make it out to her.

665
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:19,051
She, uh, pulled the handle.

666
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:20,443
Mercer, huh?

667
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:21,270
Rebecca Mercer?

668
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:25,971
What?

669
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:28,147
You gotta take the check.
I'm a parolee.

670
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,583
I'm not even supposed
to be in here.

671
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:30,932
I can't take it.
You gotta take it.

672
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,586
All right.

673
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:36,024
So, uh, we gotta take these
pictures, uh, downstairs.

674
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:37,243
Yeah.

675
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:38,766
After you.

676
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,811
Where the hell are you?

677
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:41,682
In a world of shit.

678
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:48,297
This will be painless.

679
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:49,516
We just need a few PR shots.
That's all.

680
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,952
I'm not big on
pictures, Mr. Ajax.

681
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:52,911
Maybe Rebecca would
like the photo op.

682
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,216
Oh, there you are.

683
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,174
Look, we got a problem.

684
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:57,480
What is it?

685
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:58,438
Hey!

686
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:01,832
[gunfire]

687
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:12,713
That's the problem.

688
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,063
Go, go, go, go!

689
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,068
Come on.

690
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:24,029
What is going on?

691
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,552
Well, let's see.

692
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:27,162
It's a casino, and
those guys had guns.

693
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:28,598
I assume it's a robbery.

694
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:30,861
But then again, you
seem to be the queen

695
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:32,298
of the ball around here.

696
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:34,996
I mean, you know something
I don't, pussy cat?

697
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,998
You cut me off
for four years, Ray.

698
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:38,652
What did you expect?

699
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:40,871
When I moved down here with
nothing to be near you,

700
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:41,916
he gave me a job.

701
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,873
A job, really?

702
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:43,918
What kind of job?

703
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,919
I'm head of accounting, Ray.

704
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:45,833
Accounting?

705
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:47,356
He doesn't support me.

706
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,575
But he was there for me
when you didn't want to be.

707
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:50,185
Well, I'll tell
you someplace else

708
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:53,014
I don't want to be is stuck
in this elevator with you.

709
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,277
So why don't we just go
get the divorce, huh?

710
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,192
[doors opening]

711
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:03,372
Now, go downstairs, get
the car out of the valet,

712
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,504
and I'll meet you
down there, huh?

713
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:05,896
Why?
What are you going to do?

714
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,159
I'll find a service
entrance or something.

715
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:08,812
I'm not supposed to be up here.

716
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:10,336
I don't want to get caught
up here in any police sweep.

717
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:11,685
Go ahead.

718
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:15,123
Ray, you read all
my letters, and you've

719
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,517
nothing to say to me?

720
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,431
Get my check.

721
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,267
Tell the pit bosses to
keep the games rolling,

722
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,617
but I want the lobby
entrances closed

723
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,966
until the police get here.
- You got it.

724
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,533
Don't worry about it.

725
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:34,708
And I want to be told
first about any developments.

726
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:35,970
- Done.
- In here.

727
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,016
In here.

728
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,017
Pick it up!
Pick it up!

729
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,887
Pick it up!

730
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,975
Here, come on.

731
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:41,845
Come on, come on.

732
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,108
In, in, in, in!

733
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:44,457
Quick.
Quick.

734
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,501
Let's go.

735
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:46,589
[inaudible]
- Let's move.

736
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:47,764
- Press ahead.
- I'm pressin'!

737
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:48,548
I'm pressin'!

738
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,427
They're late.

739
00:33:58,471 --> 00:33:59,211
Shit.

740
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:05,652
[sirens]

741
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:08,916
What the fuck is 5-0 doing here?

742
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:17,446
[tires squealing]

743
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:21,059
All right, hold
it right there.

744
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:21,972
Let me see your hands.

745
00:34:25,672 --> 00:34:26,673
Who the hell are you?

746
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:29,067
I know this doesn't look good.

747
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,547
Shit.

748
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:33,071
Hey, where you going?

749
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,943
[gunfire]

750
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:50,000

[gunfire]

752
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:12,066
Back, back, back, back!

753
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,893
Go!

754
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:19,856
[sirens]

755
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,425
No.
Uh-uh.

756
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:24,426
Try and catch me!

757
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,427
Aw, man.

758
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:26,428
This is bad, man.

759
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:27,864
This is bad, Benny.

760
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,834
Well, it started
off a pretty good day.

761
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:50,496
I got out of jail,
won a jackpot--

762
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:51,279
whoa!

763
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:00,375
I still had my wife.

764
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:01,985
Holy shit.

765
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:02,769
Ho!

766
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:15,869
We're getting out of here!

767
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,827
We're getting out of here!

768
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:19,307
Take a left on Main.

769
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:20,961
What the fuck are you doing?

770
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:21,831
I got it.

771
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:22,832
I know what I'm doing.

772
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,313
Shut up.

773
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:28,229
[sirens]

774
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:38,892
Shit!

775
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:39,719
Whoa--

776
00:36:58,303 --> 00:36:59,260
Yeah!

777
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:00,043
Yeah!

778
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:06,615
[honking]

779
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:15,624
Whoa!

780
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:40,170
Woo!

781
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:42,564
[chuckling]

782
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:45,088
Aw, shit!

783
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,225
[gunshot]

784
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,052
Whoa!

785
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,060
Move!

786
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:21,560
Hey!

787
00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:24,084
Stop!

788
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:24,998
Come back here.

789
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:30,046
Sorry.

790
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,960
Sorry, buddy.

791
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,453
Who works here?

792
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:46,367
Ma'am?

793
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:47,325
Anybody?
- I do.

794
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:48,630
Hi.
Yeah.

795
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:50,153
I like your sweater.
Nice sweater.

796
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:51,067
Thank you.

797
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:54,549
I got-- $30.

798
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:56,203
All right, let's
move, move, move.

799
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:57,030
Let's go.
- Move!

800
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:57,857
Move!
Move!

801
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,249
Move!

802
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:02,427
[shouting]

803
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:14,917
[shouting orders]

804
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:18,268
De Rosa, sweep the
floor of all civilians.

805
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,880
Clear those with positive
IDs, hold everyone else.

806
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:23,883
Charles Atlas, on
the top of the world.

807
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:26,668
Give me a floor plan
of this entire complex.

808
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:28,627
Oh, good god, is he confused.

809
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,324
Completely be-fucked.

810
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,717
Let me help.

811
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,850
One, I don't work for
you, you work for me.

812
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:37,200
As in the collective us, get it?

813
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:39,899
Because without us,
there would be no Vegas,

814
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,117
there would be no you.

815
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:44,294
Two, you do not
evacuate my hotel,

816
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:50,257
create massive panic, injuries,
lawsuits, bad publicity

817
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,738
that I'll be shaking
off for 10 years.

818
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:56,176
Three, if you ever come in
and close down my casino,

819
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:59,571
my gaming floor, ever again,
I will ruin your career

820
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:02,138
in this state, and I will
hound you in any state

821
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:03,923
you think you can escape to.

822
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:07,753
Now, what was it that you
wanted me to do for you?

823
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:12,061
All right, sir.

824
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:14,237
De Rosa, rescind the order.

825
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:16,370
Secure the perimeter.

826
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,633
All right.

827
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:20,548
I need some floor plans.

828
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:21,854
Give the man what he wants.

829
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,204
Right away.

830
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,335
Where's your
surveillance room?

831
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:26,511
It's upstairs.

832
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:28,251
But these guys have
knocked it out.

833
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,906
Do you have any tape
at all of them coming in?

834
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,169
I'm only one man here.

835
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:36,390
Captain, we got a description
on the armored car guy.

836
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,523
White male, 5 foot
10 inches tall,

837
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:43,310
165 pounds, 40 to 45 years
old, close cropped hair,

838
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:45,268
dark blue suit,
white shirt, no tie.

839
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,183
Oh, I saw that man
earlier this evening.

840
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:48,750
He was having some
kind of beef here

841
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:52,058
on the floor around the
same time as the robbery.

842
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,320
Could have been a diversion.

843
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:55,670
No, that was just my husband.

844
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,106
He-- he had nothing
to do with this.

845
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,152
He had just won a jackpot.

846
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:02,111
Yeah, around a half a mill.

847
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:03,765
Didn't want his
name in the paper,

848
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:06,202
didn't want his picture
taken, didn't even

849
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:08,117
want the check in his own name.

850
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:09,379
What was his name?

851
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:10,337
Ray Mercer.

852
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,207
Mercer.

853
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:12,470
This is ridiculous.

854
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:13,775
You know he had nothing
to do with this.

855
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:14,994
Get this woman to a hard room.

856
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:16,822
Nobody in, nobody out.

857
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:17,692
Ma'am.

858
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:18,824
You'll be safe there.

859
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:20,303
I'll check on you.

860
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:23,045
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

861
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:25,047
NCIC, let's get up
to date on Mercer.

862
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:25,831
I'm on it.

863
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,707
What, somebody kill himself?

864
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:33,752
Must have heard
you were coming.

865
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:40,280
Jesus.

866
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:41,760
God damn it!

867
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:42,717
Jesus Christ.

868
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:43,805
Pick it up.
- Come on.

869
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,241
Come on.
Let's go.

870
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:46,286
Let's go.
- Go, go!

871
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:47,287
Come on.
Come on.

872
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,201
Come on.

873
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:49,158
Let's go.

874
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:50,246
Go!

875
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,073
Jesus!

876
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:06,306
[chuckling] We
got him trapped now.

877
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:07,307
Go that way, Morgan.

878
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,308
All right.

879
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:09,222
But don't take any chances.

880
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:10,615
Don't worry.
I won't.

881
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:11,964
Hey, do we have health
insurance on this job?

882
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:24,411
[gunfire]

883
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,285
Here, put these on.

884
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:30,156
All right.

885
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,331
Who's radio is this?

886
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,550
It's mine.

887
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:34,073
Oh, nice work.

888
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:35,683
But a trail of fucking tacos
just might work better.

889
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:40,166
I can't believe those
motherfuckers left us.

890
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:41,428
I'm going to kill somebody.

891
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:42,690
Oh, shut up about
that, all right?

892
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,257
Yeah, we gotta get
out of here first.

893
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,346
What's that supposed to mean?

894
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:47,390
What?

895
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:49,044
No, what you just said.

896
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:50,611
Look, I was just thinking.

897
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,744
Look, Carl, everybody
knows me here.

898
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:55,311
I mean, I would just
give you guys away.

899
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:57,749
Hey, Fredo, you
want to kill somebody?

900
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,664
Why don't you kill him?

901
00:42:59,707 --> 00:43:00,578
Pissy bastard.

902
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:01,491
Easy.

903
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:02,797
We need this bitch, OK?

904
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:04,538
And nobody is going
anywhere, all right?

905
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:09,064
And nobody is killing anybody
without asking me first, OK?

906
00:43:09,108 --> 00:43:10,979
Dean?

907
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:12,459
Dean?

908
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:13,460
He's in here somewhere.

909
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:14,330
I can feel it.

910
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,332
Oh, shit.

911
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:19,205
I think I peed my pants.

912
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:20,162
Carl.

913
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:21,076
Carl.

914
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,992
Maybe we scared him off.

915
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:25,559
Oh, god!

916
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,429
Maybe not.

917
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:28,431
Maybe not!

918
00:43:28,475 --> 00:43:30,390
[gunfire]

919
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:35,047
Look, may-- may--
maybe we should split up.

920
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,617
Joe, old pal, you're in
this for the whole ride.

921
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,054
You're the only one
who knows this place.

922
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:44,230
You know this joint thoroughly.

923
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:48,538
And you're going to get us
out, ain't you, old pal?

924
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:50,323
Yeah, sure.

925
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:52,107
I'm getting the
hell out of here.

926
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:53,587
You're not going anywhere.

927
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,632
Watch me.

928
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:57,460
[gunfire]

929
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,943
Well, OK, OK!

930
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:02,901
Hold it!

931
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:03,902
Hello, up there!

932
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:06,818
Mister bad man!

933
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,298
Listen, all we want is out.

934
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:11,126
We quit, honest to god.

935
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,127
Don't we?

936
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,172
[chuckling]

937
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:15,130
So go.

938
00:44:15,174 --> 00:44:17,655
What's stopping you?

939
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:18,917
You don't have
to tell me twice.

940
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:24,139
Secure that area over there.

941
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:25,053
Got it.

942
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:26,489
Yes, sir.

943
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:27,969
MAN: Wilson, check in
the corridor down there.

944
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:28,840
MAN: All right.

945
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:30,885
Cops!

946
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:32,800
Fucking cops!

947
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:34,193
Put the money in there.

948
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:40,852
Well, miss, please don't make
any attempt to leave this area.

949
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:47,772
[whistling]

950
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:51,210
Hey, hey.

951
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:52,733
Yes, can I help you, sir?

952
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:53,908
Yeah.

953
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:57,303
Uh, do-- do you
know Rebecca Mercer?

954
00:44:57,346 --> 00:44:58,217
Do I know you?

955
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,174
Yeah, it's me.

956
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:00,523
Remember?

957
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:01,437
Oh, yeah.

958
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:02,874
The jailbird.

959
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:03,744
That's a nice shirt.

960
00:45:03,788 --> 00:45:04,876
Where'd you get the lei?

961
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:06,312
Cute.

962
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:07,530
You seen Rebecca Mercer
around here anywhere?

963
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:08,749
What do you mean,
the boss's girl?

964
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,272
Yeah.

965
00:45:10,316 --> 00:45:11,752
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

966
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,493
Stay away from the boss's girl.

967
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:15,147
Thanks.
I need my car.

968
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,322
Where's my car?

969
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:17,758
I kept it close,
like you said.

970
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:19,281
Well, I guess I should
feel lucky that it's

971
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:20,718
still here at all, right?

972
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:22,154
Oh, that's very funny.

973
00:45:22,197 --> 00:45:23,416
Now, where's your ticket?

974
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:24,896
Well, we got a
problem there, see.

975
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:25,810
You got a problem.

976
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:26,767
I don't have one.

977
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,638
I don't have the ticket.

978
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:30,249
No ticket, no wheels.

979
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:39,737
[train whistle]

980
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:08,678
Pussy cat.

981
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:17,949
You know he didn't rob you.

982
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:20,386
I thought I knew a lot
when I woke up this morning.

983
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:26,435
But you sure surprised
me, pussy cat.

984
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:37,707
You know you're the best thing
that's ever come along for me.

985
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,755
You think I'm going
to go and run off

986
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:46,107
with an ex-con, a guy with
a two-bit weekly paycheck

987
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:49,545
and some stale jokes?

988
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:52,722
I enjoy my life with you.

989
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:55,725
More than you know.

990
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:59,686
You think I'm going to go
and throw all that away?

991
00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:00,774
You're just saying that.

992
00:47:05,605 --> 00:47:08,260
How about getting me
the hell out of here?

993
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:09,609
Hm.

994
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:11,916
Why, you got somewhere
to go, pussy cat?

995
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:15,006
There's a lot
going on out there.

996
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:18,226
You're better off right here.

997
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,837
Where I can keep an eye on you.

998
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,848
You know how much
I worry about you.

999
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:34,982
OK?

1000
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:40,248
Don't stay like that too long.

1001
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:41,032
It's bad for my image.

1002
00:48:07,058 --> 00:48:08,189
Hold it!

1003
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,278
What the fuck you
guys doing here?

1004
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:11,323
What does it look like?

1005
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:13,064
We're taking care of the linen.

1006
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:15,893
All of you?

1007
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:21,159
Well, uh, John's in laundry,
and Mike here, he's in starch.

1008
00:48:21,202 --> 00:48:24,640
And Howard, he
fluffs, and I fold.

1009
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:25,946
And then we all
stay with it to make

1010
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,034
sure it gets where it's going.

1011
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:31,125
It's a union [inaudible].

1012
00:48:31,169 --> 00:48:33,040
Get the hell out of here.

1013
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,534
Damn.

1014
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:57,630
Hold it!

1015
00:48:57,673 --> 00:48:59,153
Linen, my ass.

1016
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:01,155
Fluff this!

1017
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,029
[gunfire]

1018
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:41,065
I give up!

1019
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:42,066
I didn't kill anybody.

1020
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,067
You gotta believe me.

1021
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,068
They forced me into it.

1022
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:45,330
They put a gun to my head.

1023
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,071
Honest to god, you
gotta believe me.

1024
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:50,552
Either you shoot
him, or I will, cop.

1025
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:53,468
[gunfire]

1026
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:58,560
Fuck you, Carl!

1027
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:01,999
[gunfire]

1028
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:41,386
Rebecca!

1029
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,000
Ray!

1030
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:47,957
Ray!

1031
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:51,091
Get out of there!

1032
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:51,874
No!

1033
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,361
[gunfire]

1034
00:51:27,214 --> 00:51:29,260
I guess this is a bad
time to ask for my check.

1035
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:44,623
[shouting]

1036
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:48,279
OK.

1037
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:49,845
Here's what we got.

1038
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:52,239
Our boy is Raymond Lawrence
Mercer, one of our own

1039
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:54,285
until five years ago,
when he quit the force

1040
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:56,243
and moved to California.

1041
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,593
Extradited back to Nevada.

1042
00:51:58,637 --> 00:52:02,206
Convicted on titles 18 and
21, conspiracy to traffic

1043
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:04,947
control substances
and money laundering.

1044
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,907
For those of us
who speak English?

1045
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,432
Well, his own lieutenant was
shaking down a cocaine ring.

1046
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:14,000
Mercer blew the whistle on
him, maybe wanted a bigger cut.

1047
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,871
Wrong.

1048
00:52:15,915 --> 00:52:17,395
Ray knew there was a slush fund.

1049
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:19,571
When he found out it was
dope, he brought it down.

1050
00:52:19,614 --> 00:52:22,095
Not too far down, because
the lieutenant got life,

1051
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,576
Mercer got four years,
and everybody else walked.

1052
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:26,491
That's because the Feds
wanted the whole department,

1053
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:27,970
and Ray wouldn't testify.

1054
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:29,363
Or maybe the police
were just better

1055
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:31,757
at keeping his mouth shut.

1056
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,715
It seems Ray's first
year in the joint,

1057
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:36,370
some very dangerous people
started making very serious

1058
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:38,111
threats against his family.

1059
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:38,894
They ever come after you?

1060
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:45,684
I know these people.

1061
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:46,467
Why didn't they come after you?

1062
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:54,127
When Ray went away, I guess
something gave him the idea

1063
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,607
I wasn't important anymore.

1064
00:53:05,356 --> 00:53:07,662
You think you
can steal from me?

1065
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:09,229
From me?

1066
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:12,667
Do you have any idea who I am?

1067
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:16,497
Yeah, the Jesus
Christ of craps.

1068
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:18,238
[groaning]

1069
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:20,675
Take it easy, sweetheart.

1070
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:21,502
Take it easy.

1071
00:53:32,165 --> 00:53:33,993
[groaning]

1072
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:38,302
Butcher's on his way.

1073
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:39,390
What?

1074
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:40,347
No, no.

1075
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:41,740
Not the "what," the "who."

1076
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:43,655
Tony Borgese, the Butcher.

1077
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:46,484
That's what they're
calling him now.

1078
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:48,268
After that thing that
happened in New York, that's

1079
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,443
what they're calling him?

1080
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:51,532
I guess.

1081
00:53:51,576 --> 00:53:53,926
[chuckling] Do you know
what I want you to do, Vince,

1082
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:55,493
for the rest of the night?

1083
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:59,018
I want you to concentrate
on good news, good vibes.

1084
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,499
Charlie, when you asked
me to take this job,

1085
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:02,761
I told you to lose the guy.

1086
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:09,550
You don't lose Borgese.

1087
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:10,464
He loses you.

1088
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:16,862
Good morning, sir.

1089
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:17,863
I'm very unhappy.

1090
00:54:17,906 --> 00:54:18,733
Yes, sir.

1091
00:54:18,777 --> 00:54:19,908
I know.

1092
00:54:19,952 --> 00:54:24,086
Uh-- I hope you
had a safe flight.

1093
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,392
There's Charlie.

1094
00:54:25,436 --> 00:54:26,567
I'm going to see if
your suite's really.

1095
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:31,572
Problems?

1096
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:33,008
Well, this thing took
us by surprise, Tony.

1097
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:33,966
Totally by surprise.

1098
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:43,410
You call him the Butcher.

1099
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:44,759
The Butcher?

1100
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:48,459
Not just "Butcher"?

1101
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:50,112
The Butcher.

1102
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:50,983
--two, three.

1103
00:54:51,026 --> 00:54:52,463
Up.

1104
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:53,420
One, two, three.

1105
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:54,943
Up.

1106
00:54:54,987 --> 00:54:56,031
One, two, three.
Up.

1107
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:56,902
Come on.

1108
00:54:56,945 --> 00:54:57,816
[inaudible]

1109
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:05,214
Last chance to avoid
the death penalty, Mercer.

1110
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:07,521
One of those cops you shot out
with on the docks just died.

1111
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:08,740
All right, all right.

1112
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:11,569
You're making me weep.

1113
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:13,440
How many men in your crew?

1114
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:14,833
There were seven of us.

1115
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,487
Happy and Dopey came
in through the lobby.

1116
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,837
Sneezy and Sleepy
slipped in the back.

1117
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,405
A little respect, sweetheart.

1118
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:24,277
[groaning]

1119
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:26,497
Hey!

1120
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,802
Get that [inaudible].
Get it!

1121
00:55:27,846 --> 00:55:28,803
Hey, stop him!

1122
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:29,674
He's on!

1123
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:31,284
Hold it!

1124
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,721
Right there, he's [inaudible].

1125
00:55:33,765 --> 00:55:34,722
Get in!

[gunfire]

1127
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:42,077
Don't let him out of here!

[screaming]

1129
00:56:04,143 --> 00:56:05,100
Jesus!

1130
00:56:05,144 --> 00:56:08,974
You're gonna kill somebody.

1131
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:10,367
Move, move, move, move!

1132
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,856
[shouting]

1133
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,816
Out of the way.

[coins dispensing]

1135
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,776
Go.

1136
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,736
Crooked ex-cop.

1137
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:34,086
Real garbage.

1138
00:56:34,129 --> 00:56:35,392
He's the fucking man.

1139
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:39,047
Where are they keeping him?

1140
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:41,006
Son of a bitch.

1141
00:56:41,049 --> 00:56:42,094
They're not.

1142
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:43,008
Watch it.

1143
00:56:43,051 --> 00:56:43,878
Watch out!

1144
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,980
That's your girlfriend.

1145
00:56:59,024 --> 00:57:00,852
Well, we're not getting along.

1146
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:02,462
But I mean--

1147
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:03,637
BUTCHER: Chainsaw, go get him.
- You know this place.

1148
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:04,899
How the hell do I
get out of here?

1149
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:06,423
Head for the carnival.

1150
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:08,337
Look-- see the stuffed animals?

1151
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:25,267
[bells ringing]

1152
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:34,886
Where's the door?

1153
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:35,800
Right.

1154
00:57:35,843 --> 00:57:37,192
Right, right, right!

1156
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:52,730

[sirens]

1158
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,091
We're back.

1159
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:10,095
Go!

1160
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:22,020
[fire bell]

1161
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:26,590
What the hell happened?
What's going on?

1162
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:27,591
Fire!

1163
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:28,548
Get out!

1164
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:31,508
[shouting]

1165
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,035
One, two, three.

[grunting]

1167
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:38,863
Good.

1168
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:50,004
Keep going.

1169
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:51,528
Don't push.

1170
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:53,007
We got people.

1171
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:54,487
Hey, hey.
Easy!

1172
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,488
Watch it!

1173
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,620
Watch it!

1174
00:58:56,663 --> 00:59:00,624
This is an up staircase.
Watch it.

1175
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:02,539
Hey, get away.
Get away!

1176
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:04,889
Hey, is this your husband?

1177
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:06,760
Hey, get your hands off me.

1178
00:59:06,804 --> 00:59:08,240
Look, move it on
your own time, OK?

1179
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:09,589
- Let's go.
- Switch it.

1180
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,547
Come on.

1181
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,811
Get-- get out of here.

1182
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:14,812
All right.

1183
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:16,335
I promised Dean.

1184
00:59:16,378 --> 00:59:18,206
I promised.

1185
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,556
Slow.

1186
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,469
You think you know
how to do this slow?

1187
00:59:20,513 --> 00:59:21,558
One at a time.

1188
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:23,516
One at a time!

1189
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,040
That's it.

1190
00:59:26,084 --> 00:59:26,911
Shall we?

1191
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:27,912
No.

1192
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:28,695
Take a rest.

1193
00:59:40,054 --> 00:59:40,881
There's no booze.

1194
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:49,107
Yeah, get me room
service, please.

1195
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,675
You think it's a good
time to stop for a snack?

1196
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:54,460
Thank you.

1197
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:58,377
1,000 people in the
hotel, no room service,

1198
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:04,470
running out of
booze, one valet guy,

1199
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:09,301
the cocktail girl says
they're unloading staff.

1200
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:13,435
All at the same
time as the robbery.

1201
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:16,003
Police force lost a
lot when they lost you.

1202
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:17,352
Uh-huh.

1203
01:00:17,396 --> 01:00:20,747
What the hell's going
on here, Rebecca?

1204
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:23,010
Huh?

1205
01:00:23,054 --> 01:00:27,406
Vice president in
charge of accounting?

1206
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:28,755
You know what I think?

1207
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:37,851
I think that
hotel's going under.

1208
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:42,073
Hotel's going under, and I
do believe your boyfriend

1209
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:43,814
is ripping off his own casino.

1210
01:00:43,857 --> 01:00:44,641
Right?

1211
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:51,778
All I want to know
is, are you in on it?

1212
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:59,699
Uh-huh.

1213
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:03,442
Well, were you just going to
let me take the bite for it?

1214
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:06,532
Or were you eventually going
to get around to telling me?

1215
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:08,186
Why didn't you tell me?

1216
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:09,100
Tell you what exactly?

1217
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:16,803
I know why you
didn't write, Ray.

1218
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:17,630
You do?

1219
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:21,721
You should have
had faith in me.

1220
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:28,075
I could have taken
care of myself.

1221
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:29,947
Baby, no, you couldn't.

1222
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,862
Not with those guys.

1223
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:33,733
No way.

1224
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:37,389
I would rather they
had come after me

1225
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:38,564
than to think that you--

1226
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:44,048
that you didn't want me anymore.

1227
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:53,535
I always wanted you, baby.

1228
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:55,450
I always wanted you.

1229
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,368
And I'm sorry.

1230
01:02:03,502 --> 01:02:04,808
I'm so sorry.

1231
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,648
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to break this up, Ray,

1232
01:02:19,692 --> 01:02:21,172
as much as I like to watch.

1233
01:02:24,915 --> 01:02:26,568
Yeah, I--

1234
01:02:26,612 --> 01:02:30,007
I tried to get the cop to
bring this Mercer to the office

1235
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,965
first, but--

1236
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:33,837
It's been handled.

1237
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,403
You never cease to amaze me.

1238
01:02:40,495 --> 01:02:41,975
[chuckling]

1239
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:45,196
That's got you a little
uncomfortable, doesn't it?

1240
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:47,067
What?

1241
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:47,894
The name.

1242
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:53,726
I mean, I can tell by
the way you can't say it.

1243
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,380
No, no, no.

1244
01:02:55,423 --> 01:02:59,079
It's just that-- um, I mean,
it doesn't sit well with me

1245
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:00,559
in a sentence.

1246
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:01,386
The Butcher.

1247
01:03:04,128 --> 01:03:07,000
What separates
you from an animal?

1248
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:09,046
Are you still talking to me?

1249
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:10,787
Yes, I am.

1250
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,527
No offense.

1251
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:15,182
But what, beside a bigger
brain and deodorant,

1252
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:19,143
separates you from an animal?

1253
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:20,274
An expensive haircut?

1254
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:26,280
No.

1255
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:27,281
Well--

1256
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:29,675
[chuckling]

1257
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:36,464
Uh, I don't have
to hunt for my food.

1258
01:03:36,508 --> 01:03:37,857
No.

1259
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:39,467
What, do you want me
to keep guessing here?

1260
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:42,383
No, I'm talking pure physical,
Charles, the real deal--

1261
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,211
all we really are, huh?

1262
01:03:44,255 --> 01:03:48,781
No souls, no gods, just you.

1263
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,479
What separates you
from an animal?

1264
01:03:51,523 --> 01:03:53,786
You got me.

1265
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,135
Nothing.

1266
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:57,007
Nothing.

1267
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,704
It's all life.

1268
01:03:58,747 --> 01:03:59,748
It's all special.

1269
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:01,228
Hm?

1270
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:03,752
A human's life is no
different from a cow's

1271
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:07,017
life is no different from
a chicken's life, huh?

1272
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:11,456
If I kill a guy, I'm already
100 kills behind the kid who got

1273
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:15,025
a job yesterday as a butcher.

1274
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:17,636
I'm no better than a butcher.

1275
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,812
And no worse.

1276
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,815
Yeah.

1277
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,297
Now, should we
get to the books?

1278
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,341
Yeah.

1279
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:28,168
Yeah.

1280
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:40,789
I gotta tell you one thing.

1281
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:44,097
There's a big fucking
difference between me

1282
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:46,143
and a fucking chicken, OK?

1283
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:50,495
A big fucking difference.

1284
01:04:50,538 --> 01:04:51,278
Carl.

1285
01:04:59,373 --> 01:05:01,201
Carl, where the
hell are you, man?

1286
01:05:11,298 --> 01:05:13,213
Damn.

1287
01:05:13,257 --> 01:05:17,435
Vince, what about all this--

1288
01:05:17,478 --> 01:05:19,872
our profits have tripled
every three weeks

1289
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,614
since the Mercer girl came?

1290
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:24,398
What happened to where I
was hearing that every week?

1291
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:25,660
Right.

1292
01:05:25,704 --> 01:05:29,838
That-- [clearing throat]
that was true.

1293
01:05:29,882 --> 01:05:32,406
Till we had a big keno hit.

1294
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:35,888
Since February, we've
been hitting big--

1295
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:41,415
uh, taking huge losses
on the roulette.

1296
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:43,852
We've been losing money.

1297
01:05:43,896 --> 01:05:48,205
So much of my money is being
dragged around the casino?

1298
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:50,033
Today, with the
current robbery,

1299
01:05:50,076 --> 01:05:54,037
I'd have to say
conservatively, uh--

1300
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:54,863
$12 million.

1301
01:05:58,084 --> 01:05:59,651
[phone ringing]

1302
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:01,435
Atlas.

1303
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:02,306
MAN [ON PHONE]:
It's your mother.

1304
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:03,916
Jesus fucking Christ.

1305
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,486
Uh-- fire chief again.

1306
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,227
It's always something.

1307
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:17,016
Are you fucking
crazy calling me here?

1308
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,844
Look, I've run out
of places to go, OK?

1309
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:20,106
You've got to get me out.

1310
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,325
This is not my problem.

1311
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:22,935
You messed up.

1312
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,676
You don't get out of here,
I don't fucking know you.

1313
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:26,243
CARL [ON PHONE]:
I didn't mess up.

1314
01:06:26,286 --> 01:06:28,245
I did not do anything wrong, OK?

1315
01:06:28,288 --> 01:06:30,551
Maybe there are too many
guards on tonight, you know?

1316
01:06:30,595 --> 01:06:34,077
Or maybe-- maybe those
morons that you hooked me up

1317
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,992
with are dumber than they look.

1318
01:06:36,035 --> 01:06:38,298
But I did nothing wrong, OK?

1319
01:06:38,342 --> 01:06:40,039
We have a deal.

1320
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,781
Well, I'm reneging, OK?

1321
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:45,566
I mean, if I go down, I'm
going to sing like Pavarotti.

1322
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,133
I'm going to squeal
like a stuffed pig.

1323
01:06:47,177 --> 01:06:48,569
I'm going to tell
them everything.

1324
01:06:48,613 --> 01:06:49,788
I'm going to write a book.

1325
01:06:49,831 --> 01:06:51,224
I'm going to go
on the talk shows.

1326
01:06:51,268 --> 01:06:53,139
I'm going to make shit up, OK?

1327
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:55,272
But I'm not going
to go down alone.

1328
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:56,447
OK, OK.

1329
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,057
Fine, fine.

1330
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:01,321
You just, uh, keep going up.

1331
01:07:01,365 --> 01:07:03,584
Head for the roof.

1332
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:04,672
I'll send my chopper.

1333
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:12,071
Would you excuse
me for a second?

1334
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:17,033
It's the ladies
room, Augustus.

1335
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,860
I mean, what's she going to
do, flush herself out of here?

1336
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:20,253
Yeah, all right.

1337
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:41,579
So how much was it that
got you to cross the line?

1338
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:45,017
I borrowed $4,000
from a police fund.

1339
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,062
And you dimed on it.

1340
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:47,889
That's right, I dimed on it.

1341
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:49,804
Then the Feds
offered you a deal?

1342
01:07:49,848 --> 01:07:50,675
With a hook in it.

1343
01:07:50,718 --> 01:07:52,155
You know the bit.

1344
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:54,244
Yeah, you wonder why
you're up, cop's on trial,

1345
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:55,288
make a big splash.

1346
01:07:55,332 --> 01:07:57,856
Yeah, but it's not my style.

1347
01:07:57,899 --> 01:08:00,119
You know, 4,000
doesn't sound like a lot.

1348
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:01,512
Maybe I should be
asking what it is you

1349
01:08:01,555 --> 01:08:02,948
needed that money so badly for.

1350
01:08:05,777 --> 01:08:08,910
Don't look at me.

1351
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:11,826
All right, let's go.

1352
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,132
We'll take it from
here, detective.

1353
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:15,091
Who are you?

1354
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:17,005
Bodwin, Stevens, and Lewis.

1355
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:18,659
Robbery squad,
Southwest Command.

1356
01:08:18,703 --> 01:08:20,792
We were brought here, special
backup for Captain Hefter.

1357
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,750
Yeah, well, we got
bodies on this one too.

1358
01:08:22,794 --> 01:08:26,014
So why don't we all go to
Hefter and sort this out?

1359
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:26,798
Suit yourself.

1360
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:35,241
Right this way.

1361
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:37,156
No, Hefter's this way.

1362
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,679
Ray.

1363
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:41,682
[gunfire]

1364
01:08:41,726 --> 01:08:42,683
Come on, get in there.

1365
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:44,685
You don't have to push.

1366
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:46,165
Hold your fire!

1367
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:49,125
[gunfire]

1368
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:56,523
Everything you do
is making me less sure

1369
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:57,872
of what you were saying, Ray.

1370
01:08:57,916 --> 01:08:59,874
Now, get this, Augustus.

1371
01:08:59,918 --> 01:09:02,312
You and I are going to
die here together before I

1372
01:09:02,355 --> 01:09:03,269
let her go with those guys.

1373
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:04,140
So what's it going to be?

1374
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:13,584
Give me my gun.

1375
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:15,281
That was easy.

1376
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:17,936
Well, the part about us dying
together threw me a little.

1377
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:20,330
Oh, thank god.
I was really worried about you.

1378
01:09:20,373 --> 01:09:21,548
I'm OK.
You still got the money?

1379
01:09:21,592 --> 01:09:23,376
Oh, of course.

1380
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,769
But are you sure you're OK?

1381
01:09:24,812 --> 01:09:27,380
I've had this terrible
knot in my stomach.

1382
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:29,469
You're a little too
concerned, aren't you?

1383
01:09:29,513 --> 01:09:30,905
I mean, Jesus.

1384
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:33,604
I'm starting to think
you're a little funny.

1385
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:35,214
Funny?

1386
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:36,172
Funny?

1387
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,477
How a little funny?

1388
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:38,391
Funny.

1389
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:41,002
Funny, you know.

1390
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:42,395
Funny.

1391
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:44,267
I've had this feeling,
man, that you're, uh--

1392
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:45,746
[moaning]

1393
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:48,096
What kind of feelings?

1394
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,750
Not feelings.
No, no.

1395
01:09:49,794 --> 01:09:50,664
Not feelings.

1396
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:51,535
A feeling.

1397
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:52,492
A feeling.

1398
01:09:52,536 --> 01:09:53,798
Look, look, look, look--

1399
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:55,191
I've had a really
rough day, OK, man?

1400
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:57,193
I've had a really
rough time tonight.

1401
01:09:57,236 --> 01:09:59,978
Let's just forget it came up.

1402
01:10:00,021 --> 01:10:00,805
Where are you?

1403
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:06,680
I'm on the roof.

1404
01:10:06,724 --> 01:10:08,552
Bring that broad down here.

1405
01:10:08,595 --> 01:10:10,162
Is she OK?

1406
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,946
Lover boy wants to
make sure his fortune

1407
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:13,905
cookie is not broken.

1408
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:15,733
[phone ringing]

1409
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,257
Atlas.

1410
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:20,259
I want my wife, world map.

1411
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:21,782
Who's that?

1412
01:10:21,826 --> 01:10:23,219
It's Mercer.

1413
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:24,916
You know damn well who
it is, and I know you're

1414
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:26,091
ripping off your own joint.

1415
01:10:26,134 --> 01:10:27,527
So here's the deal.

1416
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:30,400
You tell me where
she is right now,

1417
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:31,749
and then you tell
everybody else you

1418
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:33,316
made a big mistake about me.

1419
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:35,796
You hand over my 450
large, and then she and I

1420
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,494
walk out the front door.

1421
01:10:37,537 --> 01:10:40,584
Or I come up there and tell big
cheese that you are the turd

1422
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:42,455
in his punchbowl, got it?

1423
01:10:42,499 --> 01:10:44,675
OK, OK.

1424
01:10:44,718 --> 01:10:46,329
You got a deal.

1425
01:10:46,372 --> 01:10:50,898
She'll be in the Cowboy
Cabaret, the VIP lounge.

1426
01:10:50,942 --> 01:10:53,161
What deal?

1427
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:54,641
You're not gonna believe this.

1428
01:10:54,685 --> 01:10:55,555
Cowboy Cabaret.

1429
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:56,861
What the fuck's that?

1430
01:10:56,904 --> 01:10:57,775
10th floor.

1431
01:10:57,818 --> 01:10:59,167
Let's go.

1432
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:01,605
Bring the girl up
to the Cowboy Cabaret.

1433
01:11:01,648 --> 01:11:03,389
What?
No, no, no.

1434
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:04,608
I set this up.

1435
01:11:04,651 --> 01:11:06,523
But I mean, he'll--
he'll be there.

1436
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,351
What the fuck do you
need her there for?

1437
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:11,919
Yeah, you get Dick and
Nick and Mick and Rick.

1438
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:12,703
Get on it.

1439
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:18,448
What makes me think he's
catching on real quick?

1440
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:21,015
Pack it up.

1441
01:11:21,059 --> 01:11:22,234
This is bullshit.

1442
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,496
I'm calling for some backup.

1443
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,584
You trying to get me shot?

1444
01:11:24,628 --> 01:11:26,194
We're in their place.

1445
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:27,674
We're going to the
Cowboy Cabaret.

1446
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:29,110
That's right where they want us.

1447
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:30,634
They got my wife, Augustus.

1448
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:32,331
We're walking into a trap.

1449
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,724
Yeah, but I got you.

1450
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:34,507
Well, that's true.

1451
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,256
Ow!

1452
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,170
Ow!

1453
01:11:45,213 --> 01:11:47,520
The wiggles are good.

1454
01:11:47,564 --> 01:11:50,044
Live bait is better than dead.

1455
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:51,872
Come on.

1456
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:53,309
Meet you later.

1457
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:02,448
Nick, get over there.

1458
01:12:02,492 --> 01:12:03,275
Dick.

1459
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:13,720
[music playing]

1460
01:12:24,862 --> 01:12:28,648
Now that we're buddies, what
did you do with the four G's?

1461
01:12:28,692 --> 01:12:30,215
You're not going to
let that go, are you?

1462
01:12:30,258 --> 01:12:31,390
Well, I am a cop, Ray.

1463
01:13:03,814 --> 01:13:05,206
Ginger!

1464
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,469
Hey, you know, if you
wanted to see me again,

1465
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:07,861
all you had to do was ask.

1466
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:08,949
I hope you're celebrating.

1467
01:13:08,993 --> 01:13:11,430
Losing my job?

1468
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:13,084
I won the Top of the World.

1469
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:14,477
- The jackpot?
- That's right.

1470
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,043
Half of it's yours, remember?
- You did not.

1471
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:16,957
I did too.

1472
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:17,958
You're rich, honey.

1473
01:13:18,002 --> 01:13:19,046
Well, then let's go get it.

1474
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,439
Hang on.
Hang on a second.

1475
01:13:20,483 --> 01:13:22,093
Hang on a second now.
I gotta go collect it.

1476
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:24,443
We're looking for the
stage to the Cowboy Cabaret.

1477
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:25,749
Oh, you must have
walked right by it.

1478
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:26,793
We just came through there.

1479
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:28,099
Is there another way through?

1480
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:29,187
No, it's just right
through the door.

1481
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,057
Come on.
- Well, wait a minute.

1482
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:31,363
What do we do with her?

1483
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,451
You better get the
hell out of here.

1484
01:13:32,495 --> 01:13:33,278
Hang on.

1485
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:41,895
You know, you
passed it right by,

1486
01:13:41,939 --> 01:13:43,157
because it's right over here.

1487
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:44,420
Hold up there a
second, sweetie.

1488
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:45,551
Hey, do I look
good for a rich girl?

1489
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:46,944
Hold on, Ginger.
Just a minute.

1490
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:47,553
Because I can tell
you, I'm feeling good.

1491
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:48,206
Hang on.

1492
01:13:48,249 --> 01:13:48,815
[gunfire]

1493
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:51,209
[screaming]

1494
01:13:51,252 --> 01:13:53,080
Raymond.

1495
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:56,649
You have no respect for beauty.

1496
01:13:56,693 --> 01:14:00,174
[gunfire]

1497
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:03,047
I think it's time for backup.

1498
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,097
This is Augustus.

1499
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:12,578
I'm calling for backup.

1500
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:15,276
Send backup.

1501
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,495
I'm with Mercer right now.

1502
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:18,715
He's clean.

1503
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:21,935
We're in the Cowboy Cabaret.

1504
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:25,809
In the VIP lounge.

1505
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:27,724
I hate to say I told you so.

1506
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,564
Go!

1507
01:14:47,134 --> 01:14:48,005
Move, move!

1508
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,937
Go on, get out of here.

1509
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,894
Get out of here!

1510
01:15:07,938 --> 01:15:08,808
Is it bad?

1511
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:10,506
Just hang on.

1512
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:11,637
I'm all right.

1513
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:12,551
I'll be back.

1514
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:19,558
[phone ringing]
- Ho, ho, ho!

1515
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:20,516
Ho.

1516
01:15:20,559 --> 01:15:21,560
Jesus Christ.

1517
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:22,735
You scared the crap out of me.

1518
01:15:22,779 --> 01:15:23,954
Atlas.

1519
01:15:23,997 --> 01:15:25,216
How did I know
there still wouldn't

1520
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:26,957
be a chopper up here, huh?

1521
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,002
Well, I'm not risking
that thing picking you

1522
01:15:29,046 --> 01:15:30,787
up until I'm in it with you.

1523
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,353
What are you talking about?

1524
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:33,529
What am I talking about?

1525
01:15:33,572 --> 01:15:35,182
I'm talking about
losing my ride.

1526
01:15:35,226 --> 01:15:36,227
I'm going with you.

1527
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:40,971
How's my girl?

1528
01:15:41,014 --> 01:15:42,407
I don't know.

1529
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:44,496
You don't know?

1530
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,107
- Ho!
- He said he didn't know.

1531
01:15:47,151 --> 01:15:48,413
Charlie!

1532
01:15:48,456 --> 01:15:50,284
I mean, how fucking
rude is that, huh?

1533
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:52,025
How fucking rude is that?

1534
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:54,637
Oh, boy, Charlie, when was the
last time we did this together?

1535
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,030
Oh, now don't you start
getting all sentimental on me.

1536
01:15:57,074 --> 01:15:58,162
I'm not.
I mean, like, this boom.

1537
01:15:58,205 --> 01:15:59,206
Come on.
Come on.

1538
01:15:59,250 --> 01:15:59,642
Next time give me a warning.

1539
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:06,779
Ah!

1540
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:07,737
Who the fuck are you?

1541
01:16:11,523 --> 01:16:12,263
Don't move.

1542
01:16:22,839 --> 01:16:24,449
Who am I?

1543
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:25,624
Who am I?

1544
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:27,017
Bet you didn't see
that one coming.

1545
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:27,931
Yeah.

1546
01:16:27,974 --> 01:16:29,193
Hey, hey, pussy cat.

1547
01:16:29,236 --> 01:16:30,629
She's not here.

1548
01:16:30,673 --> 01:16:31,456
Pussy cat?

1549
01:16:34,154 --> 01:16:35,765
She's not here.

1550
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:36,592
She's not here?

1551
01:16:39,507 --> 01:16:40,944
Let's get to the fucking roof.

1552
01:16:50,954 --> 01:16:53,783
[gunshot]

1553
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:05,185
Come on.

1554
01:17:05,229 --> 01:17:06,578
Keep on going.

1555
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,667
I don't know where
we're supposed to go.

1556
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:11,627
Captain.

1557
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:15,631
December 2, surveillance was
down from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.

1558
01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:17,633
And running the accounting
room on that shift--

1559
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:22,681
Rebecca Mercer?

1560
01:17:28,078 --> 01:17:28,992
BUTCHER: Ugh.

1561
01:17:29,035 --> 01:17:31,864
Climbing.

1562
01:17:31,908 --> 01:17:35,520
Aw, Raymond, that's pathetic.

1563
01:17:35,563 --> 01:17:36,739
You were a cop.

1564
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:38,958
There's no way out there.

1565
01:17:39,002 --> 01:17:41,308
You're chasing
the wrong guy, pal.

1566
01:17:41,352 --> 01:17:44,181
Your boy Ajax owes me money.

1567
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:47,663
That is a very serious
accusation, Raymond.

1568
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:49,490
You have to have some proof.

1569
01:17:49,534 --> 01:17:52,058
Can't you just
take my word for it?

1570
01:17:52,102 --> 01:17:53,320
I'm afraid I can't do that.

1571
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:03,504
This is bad.

1572
01:18:03,548 --> 01:18:05,593
You could have been with him.

1573
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:08,771
Why didn't you shoot him?

1574
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:11,121
Well, I promised
you I wouldn't.

1575
01:18:11,164 --> 01:18:13,340
I wasn't talking
about our guys.

1576
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:14,994
Our guys don't freakin' count.

1577
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:19,085
You guys are
seriously fucked up.

1578
01:18:26,005 --> 01:18:28,878
Aw, Raymond.

1579
01:18:28,921 --> 01:18:30,357
[gunfire]

1580
01:18:31,402 --> 01:18:33,186
BUTCHER: Raymond!

1581
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:34,666
Who the hell are those guys?

1582
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,538
BUTCHER: You gotta pay
to get off this ride!

1583
01:18:37,582 --> 01:18:41,760
You have $11 million
of my money, Raymond.

1584
01:18:41,804 --> 01:18:43,719
I want my money, Raymond, huh?

1585
01:18:48,332 --> 01:18:52,771
There is no such
thing as a free ride.

1586
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:53,685
I want my money.

1587
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,664
I want my money, Raymond!

1588
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:20,581
[gunfire]

1589
01:19:31,157 --> 01:19:33,507
I want my money, huh!

1590
01:19:37,642 --> 01:19:40,079
I want my--

[gunfire]

1592
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,560
Ah!

1593
01:19:42,603 --> 01:19:43,953
He was driving me crazy.

1594
01:20:41,575 --> 01:20:43,926
Waiting for me?

1595
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:47,146
How did I know
you'd see the light?

1596
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,148
There's a couple of things
we need to talk about,

1597
01:20:49,192 --> 01:20:51,281
Charlie, if this is
going to work out.

1598
01:20:51,324 --> 01:20:53,587
Well, you name it,
you big pussy cat.

1599
01:21:00,638 --> 01:21:03,554
Ajax, let her go!

1600
01:21:03,597 --> 01:21:06,905
I'm not forcing
her to do anything.

1601
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:09,342
She's coming with me.

1602
01:21:09,386 --> 01:21:11,649
One of you guys take
care of that joker.

1603
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:46,162
Dean!

1604
01:21:46,205 --> 01:21:47,250
Dean!

1605
01:21:47,293 --> 01:21:48,077
Come on!

1606
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:56,563
Drop your weapon.

1607
01:22:02,178 --> 01:22:03,788
Hey look, you're not
going to die for this.

1608
01:22:03,831 --> 01:22:05,268
You take a walk.

1609
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:06,225
I'm catching a ride.

1610
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,672
Dean, come on!

1611
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:34,079
[gunshot]

1612
01:22:37,822 --> 01:22:38,605
Shit.

1613
01:22:53,664 --> 01:22:54,621
You son of a bitches!

1615
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:00,584
No!

[shouting]

1617
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:05,589
COP: Hold your fire.

1618
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:06,503
Hold your fire.

1619
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,519

Hold your fire!

ATLAS: We have company here.

1623
01:23:49,459 --> 01:23:51,200
- You son of a bitch.
- Charlie?

1624
01:23:51,243 --> 01:23:52,244
Don't, Carl.

1625
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:54,986
Sit in the fucking chair, man.

1626
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,856
Sit.

1627
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,075
I made a deal with her.

1628
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:58,859
- You gotta let her go.
- Great.

1629
01:23:58,903 --> 01:24:00,905
So you made a deal with her,
but he doesn't know that.

1630
01:24:00,948 --> 01:24:02,254
He's trying to kill us.

1631
01:24:02,298 --> 01:24:03,168
Sit in the fucking chair.

1632
01:24:03,212 --> 01:24:04,822
What is wrong with you?

1633
01:24:04,865 --> 01:24:06,215
Sit down!

1634
01:24:06,258 --> 01:24:07,216
Sit down!

1635
01:24:07,259 --> 01:24:08,130
Get up there!

1636
01:24:11,263 --> 01:24:15,398
Hey, man, what the fuck
is the matter with you?

1637
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:18,183
The chick's with me.
- Nah, I don't want her.

1638
01:24:18,227 --> 01:24:19,837
She wants a divorce.

1639
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,317
I want my check.

1640
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,231
What?

1641
01:24:22,274 --> 01:24:24,624
The check's in her name?

1642
01:24:24,668 --> 01:24:25,843
Ah.

1643
01:24:25,886 --> 01:24:29,934
Well, I guess I
need her then, too.

1644
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:31,979
I hope that when
she's not looking

1645
01:24:32,023 --> 01:24:33,546
you make something
happen to him.

1646
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:38,029
Maybe he'll fall.

1647
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:46,472
I can't control Carl if your
husband starts shooting.

1648
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:52,261
Hey, baby.

1649
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:53,131
Put it down.

1650
01:24:53,175 --> 01:24:54,306
You're outgunned.

1651
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,919
Well, maybe not.

1652
01:24:58,963 --> 01:25:01,531
Something tells me
all you goofballs

1653
01:25:01,574 --> 01:25:03,446
aren't on the same side.

1654
01:25:03,489 --> 01:25:05,143
What's that supposed to mean?

1655
01:25:05,187 --> 01:25:06,188
This is lunacy.

1656
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:07,058
Count it.

1657
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,860
What the freak?

1658
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:31,300
What?

1659
01:25:31,343 --> 01:25:33,998
There's a lot of
ones in between.

1660
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:35,347
There's a lot of ones.

1661
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:41,440
Hey, hey, hey!

1662
01:25:41,484 --> 01:25:44,704
Looks to me like we are 11
million short of 12 here.

1663
01:25:44,748 --> 01:25:45,879
You double-crossing
son of a bitch.

1664
01:25:45,923 --> 01:25:49,796
Hey, man, are you kidding?

1665
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,581
Those are all ones?

1666
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:55,541
Boy, I don't know
anything about this.

1667
01:25:55,585 --> 01:25:59,066
Listen, would I risk you
ratting me out later?

1668
01:26:01,852 --> 01:26:05,334
There's only one other guy
who knew what was going down.

1669
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:06,944
- What are you doing?
- Where's the money, man?

1670
01:26:06,987 --> 01:26:08,337
I didn't take the money.

1671
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:10,034
What are you pointing a
gun at me for, Charlie?

1672
01:26:10,077 --> 01:26:12,036
After all we been through,
you think I'd take the money?

1673
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:13,080
Vince.

1674
01:26:13,124 --> 01:26:14,734
Hey, don't Vince me, Charlie.

1675
01:26:14,778 --> 01:26:16,345
Maybe you made the switch.

1676
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:17,694
Vince!

1677
01:26:17,737 --> 01:26:19,130
Push comes to shove here.

1678
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,784
I didn't take the money.

1679
01:26:20,827 --> 01:26:24,744
And if you think I'm going
to kill myself, you're crazy.

1680
01:26:24,788 --> 01:26:25,528
You're right.

1681
01:26:31,447 --> 01:26:32,883
[gunfire]

1682
01:26:32,926 --> 01:26:35,799
When you're right
you're right, man.

1683
01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:37,975
You know why I shot
him on the way down?

1684
01:26:38,018 --> 01:26:39,759
Nobody will ever be
able to prove to me

1685
01:26:39,803 --> 01:26:42,849
that you're unconscious
when you hit the ground.

1686
01:26:42,893 --> 01:26:45,504
And I loved that
little cocksucker.

1687
01:26:45,548 --> 01:26:47,463
[inaudible]

1688
01:26:47,506 --> 01:26:51,815
Oh, that was the humane
thing to do, Roy.

1689
01:26:51,858 --> 01:26:53,120
That was charming.

1690
01:26:53,164 --> 01:26:55,558
There goes the guy
who ripped us off.

1691
01:26:55,601 --> 01:26:59,475
Shouldn't you have asked him
about where our money is?

1692
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:03,479
Bring us to the
marina on Lake Mead.

1693
01:27:03,522 --> 01:27:05,481
Vince has got a
house boat down there

1694
01:27:05,524 --> 01:27:07,831
he didn't think I knew about.

1695
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:11,617
When we pick up the money
there, I'll be expecting

1696
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:14,011
some big apologies here.

1697
01:27:14,054 --> 01:27:18,972
When I get my money, I'll
kiss you between the cheeks.

1698
01:27:19,016 --> 01:27:21,627
Meanwhile, this guy
ain't going anyplace.

1699
01:27:21,671 --> 01:27:23,847
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1700
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:25,196
[gunshot]

1701
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,284
- Hey, we shoot the engine.
- Look, man.

1702
01:27:26,328 --> 01:27:27,242
Drop it.

1703
01:27:27,285 --> 01:27:28,721
Drop it.

1704
01:27:28,765 --> 01:27:29,809
Drop it.

1705
01:27:29,853 --> 01:27:31,071
Well, what are
you waiting for?

1706
01:27:31,115 --> 01:27:33,509
Now all we gotta
do is crash, right?

1707
01:27:33,552 --> 01:27:34,379
I can't.

1708
01:27:38,905 --> 01:27:42,300
You made a deal with him?

1709
01:27:42,344 --> 01:27:44,346
Between all these
guys and the cops,

1710
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:46,870
I figured it was
your only way out.

1711
01:27:46,913 --> 01:27:49,351
You should have had a
little more faith in me.

1712
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:53,485
Yeah, well, you know,
that's part of her charm, man.

1713
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:56,706
That's why we love her, man.

1714
01:27:56,749 --> 01:28:00,405
Well, now that the odds have
improved, I've changed my mind.

1715
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:02,146
What?

1716
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:03,278
You could have waited for a
better time to tell him that.

1717
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:07,847
Hey, you.

1718
01:28:07,891 --> 01:28:09,501
I'm keeping my word.

1719
01:28:09,545 --> 01:28:11,634
[engine sputtering]

1720
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:14,201
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

1721
01:28:14,245 --> 01:28:14,811
I told you we were
going to crash.

1722
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:02,728
[chuckling]

1723
01:29:02,772 --> 01:29:05,209
ATLAS: Don't even
think about it!

1724
01:29:05,252 --> 01:29:07,690
I'm gonna borrow your car!

1725
01:29:07,733 --> 01:29:10,214
[gunfire]

1726
01:29:10,257 --> 01:29:13,173
Hey, race you to the marina!

1727
01:29:13,217 --> 01:29:14,174
[inaudible]

1728
01:29:14,218 --> 01:29:16,655
Race you to marina!

1729
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:18,178
[chuckling]

1730
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:20,180
Suck my ones.

1731
01:29:20,224 --> 01:29:21,530
You motherfucker!

1732
01:29:38,721 --> 01:29:39,548
Stop.

1733
01:29:39,591 --> 01:29:41,158
Don't look down.

1734
01:29:41,201 --> 01:29:42,333
OK.
Get in there.

1735
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,595
Just trust me.
I love you.

1736
01:29:43,639 --> 01:29:44,988
Get in there.

1737
01:29:45,031 --> 01:29:48,078
Get in, or I'll blow
your fucking brains out.

1738
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:49,209
All right.

1739
01:29:49,253 --> 01:29:52,387
OK.
We're safe now.

1740
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:53,213
We're going down.

1741
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:02,222
Didn't I tell you I'd take
you to the nicest places?

1742
01:30:02,266 --> 01:30:05,051
Boy, you can get some fucking
odds on this ride, huh?

1743
01:30:05,095 --> 01:30:05,965
You all right?

1744
01:30:06,009 --> 01:30:06,836
REBECCA: You're crazy!

1745
01:30:26,203 --> 01:30:29,032
I've got to know something.

1746
01:30:29,075 --> 01:30:33,123
Did you have a change of heart,
or have you just been using me?

1747
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:36,518
I do care about you, Charlie.

1748
01:30:36,561 --> 01:30:37,344
But I love him.

1749
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:27,177
Oh, no.

1750
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,965
Miss me?

1751
01:31:33,009 --> 01:31:33,836
Deal's off.

1752
01:31:42,235 --> 01:31:43,019
Hey!

1753
01:31:50,113 --> 01:31:53,943
[gunfire]

1754
01:32:20,491 --> 01:32:24,843
[shouting]

1755
01:32:47,431 --> 01:32:51,478
You still hanging
around, huh, Ray?

1756
01:32:51,522 --> 01:32:53,089
I like the view.

1757
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,159
[chuckling]

1758
01:33:20,203 --> 01:33:22,335
You know-- you know
the problem with being

1759
01:33:22,379 --> 01:33:24,686
on top of the world, Ray?

1760
01:33:24,729 --> 01:33:26,644
There's only room for one.

1761
01:33:26,688 --> 01:33:28,951
You got more problem, Ajax.

1762
01:33:28,994 --> 01:33:31,910
Hey.

1763
01:33:31,954 --> 01:33:34,826
Whoa!

1764
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:38,656
[shouting]

1765
01:33:42,268 --> 01:33:44,096
[chuckling]

1766
01:33:47,447 --> 01:33:48,187
He looked heavier.

1767
01:33:53,802 --> 01:33:57,153
Gee, I wonder where it is.

1768
01:33:57,196 --> 01:33:58,676
What?

1769
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,546
What?

1770
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,026
The $11 million.

1771
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:02,375
Atlas didn't have it.

1772
01:34:02,419 --> 01:34:03,289
Neither did Castor.

1773
01:34:07,424 --> 01:34:09,121
Why would you want
all that money, Ray?

1774
01:34:09,165 --> 01:34:10,601
It's stolen.

1775
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:11,646
I don't want all of it, baby.

1776
01:34:11,689 --> 01:34:14,736
I just want the $450,000.

1777
01:34:14,779 --> 01:34:17,564
Maybe the price of a new suit.

1778
01:34:17,608 --> 01:34:21,743
So where is it, hm?

1779
01:34:21,786 --> 01:34:23,222
You can tell me.

1780
01:34:23,266 --> 01:34:26,573
You ripped off Atlas,
didn't you, baby?

1781
01:34:26,617 --> 01:34:27,749
No.

1782
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:29,402
No?

1783
01:34:29,446 --> 01:34:31,535
I took it from the casino
before Atlas ripped it off.

1784
01:34:35,495 --> 01:34:37,933
[chuckling] You did?

1785
01:34:37,976 --> 01:34:39,761
Mm-hmm.

1786
01:34:39,804 --> 01:34:41,719
You're cute.

1787
01:34:41,763 --> 01:34:44,983
So where is it?

1788
01:34:45,027 --> 01:34:46,724
In my trunk.

1789
01:34:46,768 --> 01:34:48,465
What trunk?

1790
01:34:48,508 --> 01:34:49,814
Of my car.

1791
01:34:49,858 --> 01:34:52,121
The car in valet?

1792
01:34:52,164 --> 01:34:53,426
That's the only
trunk I've got.

1793
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,514
With that valet guy?

1794
01:34:54,558 --> 01:34:55,385
Yes.

1795
01:34:55,428 --> 01:34:57,387
Why?

1796
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:58,301
Shit.

1797
01:34:58,344 --> 01:34:59,824
Let's go.

1798
01:34:59,868 --> 01:35:02,479
[SINGING] I've been walking
these soulless streets

1799
01:35:02,522 --> 01:35:06,701
long enough now to see
some broken dreams.

1800
01:35:06,744 --> 01:35:12,489
But I've still got a little
faith and a reason to believe.

1801
01:35:12,532 --> 01:35:16,319
So pack your things and
come along for the ride.

1802
01:35:16,362 --> 01:35:19,714
It's just up the road
down the Miracle Mile.

1803
01:35:19,757 --> 01:35:25,763
We can dance with Lady Luck,
and baby, the joker's wild.

1804
01:35:25,807 --> 01:35:30,202
Yeah, we're going down to
where the water is wine.

1805
01:35:30,246 --> 01:35:34,206
We're gonna cause a
little trouble this time.

1806
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:37,209
Follow the lights, bright
as diamonds and pearls.

1807
01:35:37,253 --> 01:35:41,170
We're going straight to
the top of the world.

1808
01:35:41,213 --> 01:35:45,087
Whoa-ho, the top of the world.

1809
01:35:48,177 --> 01:35:51,658
I'm tired of doing
time, dying on my feet.

1810
01:35:51,702 --> 01:35:55,271
And my body's still
shaking from this heat.

1811
01:35:55,314 --> 01:35:59,797
It's the same old story
about a brother raking it in.

1812
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:02,234
Or you're just fading out.

1813
01:36:02,278 --> 01:36:05,237
I'll be spinning the wheel
and rolling the dice.

1814
01:36:05,281 --> 01:36:09,241
If I hit it once, I'm
gonna let it ride.

1815
01:36:09,285 --> 01:36:13,506
'Cause there's no use in turning
back when, honey, the time

1816
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:15,247
is right.

1817
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:19,730
Well, we're going to
where the water is wine.

1818
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:23,212
We're gonna cause a
little trouble this time.

1819
01:36:23,255 --> 01:36:26,737
Follow the lights, bright
as diamonds and pearls.

1820
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:30,219
We're going straight to
the top of the world.

1821
01:36:30,262 --> 01:36:33,700
We're gonna have
our moment in time.

1822
01:36:33,744 --> 01:36:36,703
We're gonna push it
right over that line.

1823
01:36:36,747 --> 01:36:40,707
Follow the lights, bright
as diamonds and pearls.

1824
01:36:40,751 --> 01:36:44,189
We're going straight to
the top of the world.

1825
01:36:44,233 --> 01:36:50,674
Whoa-ho, the top of the world.

1826
01:36:50,717 --> 01:37:04,122
Now, my soul shall be rectified
when I let my true light shine.

1827
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:08,648
Well, we're going down to
where the water is wine.

1828
01:37:08,692 --> 01:37:12,652
We're gonna cause a
little trouble this time.

1829
01:37:12,696 --> 01:37:15,612
Follow the lights, bright
as diamonds and pearls.

1830
01:37:15,655 --> 01:37:18,615
We're going straight to
the top of the world.

1831
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:22,097
We're gonna have
our moment in time.

1832
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:26,623
We're gonna push it
right over that line.

1833
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:29,582
Follow the lights, bright
as diamonds and pearls.

1834
01:37:29,626 --> 01:37:33,064
We're going straight to
the top of the world.

1835
01:37:33,108 --> 01:37:37,068
We're going straight to
the top of the world.

1836
01:37:37,112 --> 01:37:41,072
We're going straight to
the top of the world.

1837
01:37:41,116 --> 01:37:46,469
Whoa-ho, top of the world.

1838
01:37:50,081 --> 01:37:50,952
Oh, yeah.

1839
01:37:59,786 --> 01:38:00,526
Top of the world.

1840
01:38:14,801 --> 01:38:15,585
Mm-hmm.

1841
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:22,244
I'm gonna let it ride.

1842
01:38:22,287 --> 01:38:23,985
All right.
