1
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:02,087
This will burn fast.

2
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:05,755
Use it only to start the flame.

3
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:09,334
Then this will last the morning.

4
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,166
Tell me more about the man.

5
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:15,837
He has trouble breathing.

6
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,843
Sometimes he fights to swallow air.

7
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:24,076
He can put his hand on you
and tell what your sickness is.

8
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:26,843
By magic?

9
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,010
By science.

10
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,090
He's a doctor who lives in the city.

11
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,092
Can he cure you of worms?

12
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:37,561
City people don't get sick
the way we do.

13
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:42,396
They speak a different language,
they wear different clothes.

14
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,629
They don't look like us.

15
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:48,303
The people...

16
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,206
The common people love drama.

17
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,938
That's true.

18
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:56,512
They watch soap operas.

19
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,915
That's why you can't believe
any of these rumors.

20
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,584
How is it?

21
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,348
It doesn't seem to have changed.

22
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:08,586
- It isn't bigger?
- It isn't smaller, either.

23
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,721
We'll have to watch it.

24
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,333
What a thought, watching my ass.

25
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:24,436
The Reds make up these stories
and the people believe them.

26
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,739
It makes our job even harder.

27
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,404
You can get dressed.

28
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,278
Thanks.

29
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:44,259
I was sorry to hear about your wife.

30
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,591
Thank you.

31
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,135
There was nothing we could do.

32
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:52,602
Think you'll retire soon?

33
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:55,269
I don't know.

34
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,877
My vacation starts tomorrow.

35
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:01,575
- I'll have time to think.
- Going to the beach?

36
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:05,811
I want to try somewhere new.

37
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,478
Without Isabel...

38
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,287
- Maybe the mountains.
- The mountains?

39
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,393
My Tigers spend half their time...

40
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:18,498
...chasing guerrillas
in those fucking mountains.

41
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:23,735
I thought you'd wiped them out,
that the guerrillas were only a rumor.

42
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,635
It only takes a few of those bastards
to make trouble.

43
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,506
What can you do in the mountains?

44
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:35,511
So tell me, my condition...?

45
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:37,514
It's confidential. As always.

46
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:43,180
- It could be used against me.
- Who'd want to give you trouble?

47
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:46,416
You're like a child, Humberto.

48
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:50,155
The world is a savage place.

49
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:58,963
Very nice of you.

50
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,370
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

51
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:04,443
That's why people like the beach.
They forget their problems.

52
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:07,308
And you, alone, without Mommy...

53
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:11,351
I've been thinking about my students
in the program.

54
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,680
Daddy trained doctors
for the government.

55
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,585
- Ambassadors of health.
- I remember that.

56
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:19,555
The foreigners who made war
on tapeworms.

57
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:21,758
The Alliance for Progress.

58
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:24,159
Why don't they cure
their own Indians?

59
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,993
- Raul.
- What?

60
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:29,534
The government had to accept
their aid to shut the gringos up.

61
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:34,539
That might be true, but the program
was a good idea.

62
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,802
You should be very proud, Daddy.

63
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,779
I want to visit my students.

64
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:43,882
- In the countryside?
- Lf they're still there.

65
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:47,919
- Why wouldn't they be?
- It's been what, two years?

66
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:50,421
- Three.
- Three years with the Indians!

67
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:53,492
My idea of hell.

68
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,328
It isn't a punishment.

69
00:05:56,063 --> 00:06:00,830
Doctor, how many of your patients
are Indians?

70
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,773
My family has been living with them
at our ranch for centuries.

71
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:15,405
The more you do for them
or give them, the lazier they get.

72
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,383
Giving them a taste of modern things.

73
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:22,681
Ideas, medicine, television...

74
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:24,722
...you just destroy their souls.

75
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:27,918
The program was a good idea!
A good idea!

76
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:32,959
It's my legacy.

77
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:36,359
Have your students written to you?

78
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:43,265
No, they haven't, but...

79
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:47,510
Maybe the beach,
but in a smaller hotel.

80
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,149
My kidneys are bothering me too.

81
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:53,754
Whenever I drink red wine,
I get a pain right here.

82
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:57,322
The more expensive the wine,
the sharper the pain.

83
00:06:57,491 --> 00:06:59,516
How awful!

84
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,591
- Good afternoon, doctor!
- Good afternoon.

85
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:10,228
The doctor doesn't look so good.

86
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:37,120
Out With the Government!!

87
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:51,509
In a struggle against death...

88
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,910
...any advantage in technology,
no matter how small...

89
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:57,141
...can win the battle.

90
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,650
Cortés won an empire
with a few men...

91
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:06,054
...but he had horses and guns,
and his adversaries didn't.

92
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:08,354
Where you're going...

93
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:13,262
...your main enemies
will be bacteria and ignorance.

94
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:16,562
Bacteria can be fought with drugs.

95
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:22,403
But their ally, ignorance,
nobody is immune to this disease.

96
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:24,840
To be more specific...

97
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:28,106
...we expect you not only to apply
your medical knowledge...

98
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,722
It was an excellent idea.

99
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:27,732
Bravo! Hey!

100
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,934
Wait!

101
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,408
Bravo!

102
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:45,408
Wait!

103
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:28,552
Don't you recognize me?

104
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:30,153
What do you want with me?

105
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:35,323
- Why aren't you in the village?
- The program is finished.

106
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:38,397
- That's not true.
- It's finished for me.

107
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:43,298
You were trained.
You accepted the responsibility.

108
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:47,998
Dozens of students who applied
weren't as lucky as you.

109
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:51,104
Yes, I was lucky.

110
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:53,910
Luckier than Cienfuegos.

111
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,245
- What happened to Cienfuegos?
- What do you think?

112
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,679
I have no idea.

113
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:04,184
- He didn't get a warning.
- Warning of what?

114
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:08,725
You don't know a thing about it,
do you?

115
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:12,565
What are you doing in Los Perdidos?

116
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,663
This is a pharmacy.

117
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,073
We sell drugs at popular prices.

118
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:28,643
So your classes
weren't a complete waste.

119
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,510
I sent you with medicine, training,
the support of the government.

120
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:39,557
Dr. Fuentes, you're the most
learned man I ever met.

121
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:42,418
But also the most ignorant.

122
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:48,793
Go find Cienfuegos.
He's got the whole story.

123
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:00,944
You'd better go home, doctor.

124
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:04,579
Los Perdidos is no place to be
at night.

125
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:52,132
Angela called me last night.

126
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:54,426
Did you change your plans?

127
00:14:57,838 --> 00:15:00,170
It was a shock.

128
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:02,535
Bravo was one of my best students.

129
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,803
He got some Indian girl pregnant
and had to run to save his ass.

130
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,651
Can I use the Mercedes
until you're back?

131
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,711
Hello.

132
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,781
What town are you from?

133
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:27,350
From here.

134
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:32,356
This place must have a name.
What's it called?

135
00:17:35,662 --> 00:17:40,656
We're salt people.
This is where we live.

136
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:49,933
- But there's nothing here.
- You can't see anything from a car.

137
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:10,290
It was like a hub here.
Like Chicago or Atlanta.

138
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,331
- They cut paths through the jungle?
- There's no jungle to cut through.

139
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,867
It was all farmland back then.
Overpopulated and overfarmed.

140
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:21,004
See if this guy knows.

141
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,104
Excuse me, sir.

142
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:27,971
Please, could you tell us...

143
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:34,519
...do you know how far it is
to the ruins in Jobal?

144
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:38,021
I'm not sure.
I've never traveled here before.

145
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,954
Thank you.

146
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:43,255
I think he said he
doesn't know this area.

147
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,295
Well, at least he speaks Spanish.

148
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,602
When we speak to the Indians...

149
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:53,501
...they don't understand Spanish.

150
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:58,373
I don't think the Indians
in the United States speak English.

151
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:04,440
He says, "Do all our Indians
speak English?"

152
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,551
I think all of them do.

153
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:09,586
I think there's a law.
Isn't there a law?

154
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:12,054
Ask him if he's
heard of any atrocities.

155
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:16,753
No, I'm not gonna ask him that.
You ask him that.

156
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,229
- Lf we're going up there, ask him.
- Ask him. Go ahead.

157
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,169
Are there...?

158
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:25,497
That's right, isn't it? Thank you.

159
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:27,640
Are there...?

160
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:29,241
That's right, isn't it?

161
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:34,813
Are there "atrocidados" here?

162
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:47,089
- "Atrocidados."
- My husband wants to know...

163
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,219
...whether you've read about...

164
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:54,826
...any problems in this area?

165
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:57,128
Political problems.

166
00:19:57,304 --> 00:20:00,569
Tell him about the book we have with
the people with their hands cut off.

167
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,266
- Hands kite.
- Cut.

168
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,138
- Yes?
- Cut.

169
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:06,301
Cut.

170
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,741
No, no. That happens in
other countries. Not here.

171
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,415
Not here?

172
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,346
Everything isn't perfect here...

173
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:17,319
...but you shouldn't believe
all the stories.

174
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:21,188
There are stories in New York...

175
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:24,194
...about murders...

176
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:28,494
...in the newspapers.

177
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:33,034
Newspapers are businesses.

178
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:36,107
And you know the common people
love drama.

179
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:37,941
That's true.

180
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,239
He says the common people
love drama.

181
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,848
Ask him why they
don't have fajitas here.

182
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,278
Why...

183
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,442
...no...?

184
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,316
What's the word for "fajitas"?

185
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:02,344
Señor, is the town of Rio Seco
near here?

186
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:08,856
How do you get there?

187
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,294
Señora, excuse me...

188
00:23:48,702 --> 00:23:50,795
...do you know where
Dr. Cienfuegos lives?

189
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:57,568
The doctor here.
He's called Cienfuegos.

190
00:23:57,911 --> 00:24:00,277
Isn't this Rio Seco?

191
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:04,241
Señora!

192
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:09,846
Hey, listen to me, please...

193
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:15,291
Señora, excuse me.

194
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:19,865
Señores, do you know
Dr. Cienfuegos?

195
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:21,364
Hey, there.

196
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:25,231
This is Rio Seco, right?

197
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:27,703
Where does Dr. Cienfuegos live?

198
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:41,743
It's like nobody here speaks Spanish.

199
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,883
Who's that? Who's out there?

200
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:52,628
Señora, is this Rio Seco?

201
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,064
Of course it is. Are you blind?

202
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:06,475
I've never been here before.
Nobody wants to talk to me.

203
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:12,278
We're just poor sugar people here.

204
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,613
Almost nobody comes here.

205
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,256
Who are you?

206
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:21,019
- I'm Dr. Fuentes.
- That's good, a doctor.

207
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:25,494
We need a doctor,
because the one we had died.

208
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:27,223
Died?

209
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:29,665
How?

210
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,269
- They killed him.
- Who killed him?

211
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,340
Those men. The men with guns.

212
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:36,736
You saw this?

213
00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:41,302
- I'm blind, can't you see that?
- I'm sorry.

214
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:44,211
But I know everything
that happens here.

215
00:25:44,384 --> 00:25:47,512
They made everyone witness,
even me.

216
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:51,987
The doctor and three others,
out there.

217
00:25:52,358 --> 00:25:53,723
Somebody shot them?

218
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,463
No. They burned them with gasoline.

219
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:00,826
I smelled it.

220
00:26:01,034 --> 00:26:04,629
First the gasoline, then the fire,
and then the men.

221
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:07,839
They cooked them all.

222
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,668
Why?

223
00:26:09,843 --> 00:26:12,107
Because they had guns and we didn't.

224
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:14,974
But why Cienfuegos? Why the doctor?

225
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:17,139
- They didn't like him.
- But why?

226
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:20,548
"Why, why, why?"
You talk like a parrot.

227
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:26,416
Are you the only one
who speaks Spanish?

228
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,691
- Then why won't anyone talk to me?
- They don't know you.

229
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:32,692
But you're talking to me.

230
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:38,696
It doesn't matter if I die.
They've killed all my children.

231
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:43,008
- Who killed them?
- The men with guns.

232
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:45,736
But who are these men?
Are they white or Indian?

233
00:26:45,912 --> 00:26:49,905
When an Indian puts on a uniform,
he becomes white.

234
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,152
You'd better go now, doctor.

235
00:26:56,623 --> 00:26:57,920
What's wrong?

236
00:26:58,091 --> 00:27:00,924
The people here don't know you.

237
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:02,857
I taught your doctor.

238
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,759
His name was Cienfuegos.
He was a good student.

239
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:08,025
Cienfuegos wasn't a good doctor.

240
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:15,765
- Why do you say that?
- So many of his patients are dead.

241
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:36,987
My camera!

242
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:39,228
Damn it!

243
00:27:52,178 --> 00:27:56,137
Thousands of them. Tore their hearts
out and threw them in the well.

244
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:58,443
Must have had a labor surplus.

245
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:00,779
Hello! We meet again!

246
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:04,081
The accounts say there was a stream
of blood running down the pyramid.

247
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:05,781
In Mexico.

248
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:07,384
Pardon?

249
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,892
Not here. In Mexico. The Aztecs.

250
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,223
But it says here...

251
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:12,386
Not our people.

252
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,659
It was other tribes
attacking from the north.

253
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:21,066
Honey, he said it was
foreigners invading from the north.

254
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,334
That's not what it says in the book.

255
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:46,723
- <i>I found this in the lobby.</i>
- <i>Read it.</i>

256
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:49,531
It's written in italics.

257
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:51,431
You read it poetically.

258
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:55,430
<i>There is a place where the air</i>
<i>Is like a caress</i>

259
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,235
<i>Where gentle waters flow</i>

260
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,140
<i>A place where your burdens</i>
<i>Are lifted from your shoulders</i>

261
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:02,281
<i>On wings of peace</i>

262
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:04,279
They can't be talking about this place.

263
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,940
This is near Bali.

264
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:09,654
<i>A place to forget</i>
<i>A place to grow</i>

265
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:14,191
<i>A place where each day is a gift</i>
<i>And each person is reborn</i>

266
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,692
<i>Where is this paradise on earth?</i>

267
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:19,661
<i>This heaven, this safe harbor?</i>

268
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,542
They murdered Cienfuegos.

269
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:33,338
Who told you that?

270
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:37,313
I heard a rumor in the capital,
so I went to the village.

271
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:39,246
He wasn't there.

272
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:42,019
The guerrillas kidnapped him.

273
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:44,689
They told me
he was burned to death.

274
00:29:46,392 --> 00:29:47,882
What is your name, sir?

275
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:52,189
Dr. Fuentes. Humberto Fuentes.

276
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:55,960
Dr. Humberto Fuentes.

277
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:58,865
I'll send somebody to investigate.

278
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:01,070
We have to stop these rumors.

279
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,140
That won't change anything.

280
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:06,210
If the guerrillas kidnapped him,
killed him, then...

281
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:09,109
Then you'll be returning to the capital?

282
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:13,241
I'd like to keep on, visit another
student of mine in Tierra Quemada.

283
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:16,348
I wouldn't advise you to go there.

284
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,757
Why not?

285
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:24,390
There have been some incidents
with guerrillas up there.

286
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:28,625
And then there are deserters,
bandits and the Indians...

287
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:32,168
Well, they're Indians, right?

288
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:34,203
They won't talk to anybody.

289
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,808
A white face comes along, and...

290
00:30:38,811 --> 00:30:40,779
I'm sure my student is there.

291
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:45,941
If you want to, go ahead,
but I can't guarantee your safety.

292
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,220
Could I see your identification?

293
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,089
I need to make sure you're a doctor,
not a journalist.

294
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,253
We've had problems with journalists
up there.

295
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:02,959
They go up to take pictures,
then they disappear.

296
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:04,865
And I get blamed for it.

297
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:07,801
I won't take any pictures.
They stole my camera.

298
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:10,670
Your identification, please.

299
00:32:04,697 --> 00:32:10,067
Hey, old man!

300
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:13,603
Are you lost?!

301
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,408
Excuse me, señora...

302
00:33:25,578 --> 00:33:28,342
...do you know
where Dr. Arenas is?

303
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:33,085
The doctor here.

304
00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:39,624
Do you know him, señora?
Dr. Arenas.

305
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:46,092
Nobody knows
where Dr. Arenas is?

306
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,737
Dr. Arenas. Don't you know him?

307
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:56,868
Señoras, don't you know if he's here?

308
00:34:45,224 --> 00:34:47,124
She isn't sick.

309
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,993
This is malnutrition and thirst.

310
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:51,151
Food.

311
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:54,262
What do you feed her?

312
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:58,364
She's too big
for breast-feeding.

313
00:34:58,738 --> 00:35:02,765
She needs solid food, like corn.
You understand?

314
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:05,410
There's no corn. Only coffee.

315
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,807
- What do you eat?
- Nothing.

316
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:15,582
I don't have food, only medicine.

317
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:18,986
Your daughter needs food.

318
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:22,218
Vegetables, fruit, rice.

319
00:35:22,395 --> 00:35:24,386
These are coffee people.

320
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:27,198
They pick coffee to buy food.

321
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,095
Okay, so buy food.

322
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:32,764
They say the coffee price is bad.

323
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:36,271
So the pay is too low to buy food.

324
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,008
This village is fucked.

325
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,440
Where is the doctor?

326
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:43,446
- The other doctor, Dr. Arenas?
- He's gone.

327
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:44,943
Gone where?

328
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:46,878
They took him.

329
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:49,886
- Who took him?
- The army.

330
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,584
- Where to?
- To the school.

331
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:59,026
- Is he still there?
- They said they were taking him there.

332
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,856
Where is the school?

333
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,865
Look, we're here.

334
00:36:04,904 --> 00:36:06,997
- Here?
- No, here.

335
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:09,869
- Really?
- Yes. Where's the school?

336
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:15,906
Is there a road that leads there?

337
00:36:19,285 --> 00:36:21,480
I'll show you for 2 reals.

338
00:36:22,822 --> 00:36:23,914
Fine.

339
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:26,986
Tell your mother you're
coming with me.

340
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,953
- I don't have a mother.
- Then your father.

341
00:36:30,496 --> 00:36:31,520
I don't have one.

342
00:36:32,531 --> 00:36:34,328
He doesn't have anyone.

343
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:17,035
What's wrong?

344
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:19,243
I'm hungry.

345
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:22,278
I'm as fucked as the rest of them.

346
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:34,426
That woman needed food.
That's who I should be feeding.

347
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,793
She didn't have anything to sell.

348
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,394
- Here.
- What?

349
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,265
Stop here.

350
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:48,301
The school is here?

351
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:51,601
No, but it's where the doctor is.

352
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:55,674
Show me.

353
00:37:56,582 --> 00:37:58,812
My 2 reals first.

354
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:45,192
These are people.

355
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:49,162
- Human beings.
- Not anymore.

356
00:38:50,936 --> 00:38:52,233
What are they doing here?

357
00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:54,736
This is where they take you
when you graduate.

358
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:19,228
Why were they killed?

359
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:23,699
Because the army was mad at them.

360
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,070
They didn't even bury them.

361
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,473
To make an example.

362
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:35,275
Example of what?

363
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:38,809
That it's a bad idea to get the army
mad at you.

364
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:42,086
Why did they kill Dr. Arenas?

365
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:45,490
- He was a doctor.
- I know that, but why kill him?

366
00:39:45,658 --> 00:39:47,922
Because he was a doctor.

367
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:58,132
- Was he a good doctor?
- Yes. He fixed my broken wrist.

368
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,603
- Did the village people like him?
- No.

369
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,937
- Why not?
- He wasn't one of them.

370
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:09,644
People should know about this.

371
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:10,804
Everybody knows.

372
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:14,180
The army brought us to see
what could happen to us.

373
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:16,150
I didn't know anything about it.

374
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:18,517
Because you're a stranger.

375
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,920
I'll take you back.

376
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:27,156
You're going home?

377
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,995
I don't know.
I may go to Caras Sucias.

378
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:31,898
You'll get lost.

379
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:35,507
I know how to find it.
You can't come with me.

380
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:40,478
- Where will you sleep?
- In a hotel.

381
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,410
- There aren't any hotels out here.
- And in your village.

382
00:40:43,582 --> 00:40:45,482
They might kill you.

383
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:50,687
Who?

384
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:52,481
The men who are hiding.

385
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,149
When you came there was a signal...

386
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,557
...and all the men went into hiding.

387
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,427
Now they know you're alone,
so they might kill you.

388
00:41:04,303 --> 00:41:05,702
I haven't done anything to them.

389
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:08,036
So what? You're a stranger.

390
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,669
I know where we can sleep.

391
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,481
This was the school.

392
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:27,621
But after the teacher disappeared...

393
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:31,661
...the army brought people here
to ask all the questions.

394
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,732
They'd scare people by saying,
"We'll take you to school."

395
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:40,099
If you survived, people said you
were educated.

396
00:41:40,272 --> 00:41:43,332
If you didn't, they said you
had graduated.

397
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:45,568
How do you know all this?

398
00:41:46,445 --> 00:41:48,675
They brought me here with three girls.

399
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:50,747
The girls washed their clothes...

400
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:53,510
...cooked for them
and did it with them.

401
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:56,449
And I did all the other work.

402
00:41:57,022 --> 00:41:58,284
Were they prostitutes?

403
00:41:58,457 --> 00:42:02,587
The soldiers called them whores,
but they didn't pay them.

404
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:06,191
- Were they white men?
- All the soldiers were Indians.

405
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:09,459
But the commander acted
like he was white.

406
00:42:09,635 --> 00:42:11,432
- From where?
- Not from here.

407
00:42:11,603 --> 00:42:13,935
They never send you
to your own region.

408
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,335
I slept here.

409
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:31,586
What are these for?

410
00:42:32,224 --> 00:42:34,488
For the operations.

411
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,455
- They had a doctor?
- No.

412
00:42:37,629 --> 00:42:42,157
They took your friend's tools
after his "education"...

413
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:47,101
...and used them to make people talk.

414
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:49,931
They call that "operations."

415
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:54,045
The soldiers were always
making jokes.

416
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,112
They used one of these.

417
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:00,242
Don't touch that!

418
00:43:06,925 --> 00:43:10,383
If you want to go to Caras Sucias
tomorrow, we should start early.

419
00:43:10,562 --> 00:43:12,621
There isn't a path.

420
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,695
How can there be a village
if there isn't a path?

421
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:21,635
They don't want to be found.

422
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:39,352
The guys said they'd take me along
as a mascot...

423
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:42,460
...but the commander said no.

424
00:43:43,729 --> 00:43:46,163
I'll wake you up at sunrise.

425
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,271
The boy has no mother.

426
00:44:02,114 --> 00:44:05,550
His mother is alive,
but she won't look at him.

427
00:44:07,286 --> 00:44:09,083
How can that be?

428
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:14,055
She was only a girl herself
when soldiers came and forced her.

429
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:18,253
The boy is something
she pushed from her body.

430
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,625
Use your fingertips.

431
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,367
How can he live?

432
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:28,836
Like a dog lives. He takes the scraps
that real people leave.

433
00:44:29,508 --> 00:44:31,601
So he's bad.

434
00:44:31,777 --> 00:44:36,680
Dogs can't be bad or good.
They're just dogs.

435
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,099
There's nobody left.

436
00:44:56,268 --> 00:44:58,532
These were banana people.

437
00:44:58,704 --> 00:45:01,764
They hid in the trees...

438
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,343
...but during the festival
they got caught in the open...

439
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:08,638
...and were gunned down
from a helicopter.

440
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:10,645
The survivors were taken away.

441
00:45:10,816 --> 00:45:12,579
Why didn't you tell me?

442
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:15,752
You didn't ask if there were people
here.

443
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:20,350
Do you know what happened
to the doctor here? Echevarría?

444
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,960
Okay, now I'll take you back.

445
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:28,828
They don't want me there.

446
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,667
- They say I'm bad luck.
- They're right.

447
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:38,400
You know how to find the main road?

448
00:45:43,715 --> 00:45:46,047
You know where Los Mártires is?

449
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:48,685
It's higher up.

450
00:45:48,854 --> 00:45:49,980
Were you ever there?

451
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,778
Were you?

452
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:17,640
Damn it! This fucking country!

453
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:24,517
Hey, old geezer,
what are you doing here?

454
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:29,320
- Don't block the road!
- So long, buddy!

455
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:31,828
Assholes!

456
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:05,291
Señor, have you seen anyone
with my tires?

457
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:08,522
Where are you coming from?

458
00:47:10,902 --> 00:47:13,530
Watch it, mister. He's a soldier.

459
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:16,064
Do you speak Spanish?

460
00:47:16,675 --> 00:47:20,042
Did you see somebody with tires?
From my car?

461
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,548
I don't know anything about
your fucking tires.

462
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:32,080
How much money have you got?

463
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:35,156
Give me your money
or I'll break his arm.

464
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:37,420
- He isn't mine.
- So what?

465
00:47:37,696 --> 00:47:40,164
- I've only got 2 reals.
- Give them to me.

466
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:42,961
And you?

467
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,646
At least give me back my tires.

468
00:47:56,815 --> 00:47:58,680
How could I have your tires?

469
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,341
Somebody with a jack took them.

470
00:48:02,554 --> 00:48:04,078
Give me the keys.

471
00:48:19,805 --> 00:48:21,568
What are you doing out here?

472
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,468
Visiting a friend.

473
00:48:25,544 --> 00:48:27,774
- Where?
- He works in Pico de Aguila.

474
00:48:29,247 --> 00:48:31,738
You can't reach that village by car.

475
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,650
Some soldier.

476
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:51,793
If there's a battle and a soldier
loses his rifle...

477
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,031
...the captain says he's a spy,
and the soldier is executed.

478
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,837
That's stupid.

479
00:48:59,344 --> 00:49:01,312
They've got discipline.

480
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,949
When I was their mascot
I saw it lots of times.

481
00:49:06,117 --> 00:49:09,644
That probably happened to the man
who took my money.

482
00:49:10,255 --> 00:49:11,722
Two reals!

483
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,251
I had hundreds in my wallet.

484
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:18,027
- Do you have a house in the capital?
- Yes.

485
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,423
And you have more money there?

486
00:49:21,266 --> 00:49:22,358
It's in the bank.

487
00:49:22,534 --> 00:49:24,832
Then what are you crying about?

488
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,938
He took everything I had in the world.

489
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:35,278
- Nobody drives on this road.
- Nobody but idiots.

490
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:42,118
Somebody's coming.

491
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,319
Then it must be some idiot.

492
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,435
Run, kid!

493
00:50:10,248 --> 00:50:11,374
Are you hurt?

494
00:50:15,353 --> 00:50:17,651
Put these tires onto your car.

495
00:50:18,156 --> 00:50:19,851
Where did you get it?

496
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:21,581
I said run!

497
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:25,589
Hurry up!

498
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:29,096
There's a jack in the trunk.

499
00:50:33,305 --> 00:50:34,431
Tourists.

500
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:37,307
Tourists always have flashlights.

501
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,239
Point it at the tires.

502
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,280
What are you doing?

503
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:52,254
Tell me what you're doing!

504
00:50:52,524 --> 00:50:54,924
The bullet went through your arm
and lodged in your ribs.

505
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,993
I have to give you a shot.

506
00:50:58,063 --> 00:51:01,362
- Don't knock me out.
- You can't take the pain.

507
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:03,330
Just do it.

508
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,698
You don't have much experience
with bullets.

509
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:46,942
My patients aren't thieves.

510
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:51,112
The boy said you're a deserter.

511
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,383
I was a medic in the army.

512
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:01,717
If they stop us, say I'm your driver
and that a snake bit me.

513
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:04,017
What?

514
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:08,889
Say I was pissing by the side
of the road, and a snake bit me.

515
00:52:11,836 --> 00:52:13,098
Where are we going?

516
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,502
Further on.

517
00:52:20,111 --> 00:52:22,079
You'll drive.

518
00:52:23,648 --> 00:52:26,082
Give me a shot for the pain now...

519
00:52:26,251 --> 00:52:28,185
...but not enough to knock me out.

520
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:34,424
What's that?

521
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,057
I can't read the label.

522
00:52:37,228 --> 00:52:39,059
It's an analgesic.

523
00:52:39,431 --> 00:52:40,989
Can you read?

524
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:44,364
You have to trust me.

525
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,869
- What is it exactly?
- You have to trust me.

526
00:52:50,975 --> 00:52:52,943
- Your pants.
- He's just a boy!

527
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:55,739
I'll give him half a dose
and see what it does.

528
00:52:56,347 --> 00:52:58,178
Drop your pants!

529
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:01,313
First give me my 2 reals back.

530
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:03,646
When we get where I'm going.

531
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:15,890
What?

532
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:22,731
Where are we going?

533
00:53:25,276 --> 00:53:26,766
Further ahead.

534
00:53:28,446 --> 00:53:29,777
Let's go.

535
00:53:39,357 --> 00:53:41,086
Did you kill the tourists?

536
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:45,790
- Who?
- The ones whose tires you took.

537
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:49,661
Did you kill them?

538
00:53:54,205 --> 00:53:55,536
Why not?

539
00:53:55,707 --> 00:53:57,470
What do you care?

540
00:53:58,009 --> 00:53:59,806
Who shot you?

541
00:53:59,978 --> 00:54:01,104
It doesn't matter.

542
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:13,479
What did he say?

543
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,524
He says he's never been
in an airplane before.

544
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,138
He won't run away.

545
00:54:34,546 --> 00:54:36,605
Am I going to die from this?

546
00:54:39,284 --> 00:54:41,149
Not if you get treatment.

547
00:54:42,854 --> 00:54:45,414
Then you'll get to live a little longer.

548
00:54:48,426 --> 00:54:51,190
If you want to get better,
you need to sleep.

549
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,221
You first.

550
00:56:48,846 --> 00:56:52,407
Keep moving, damn it!
I told you not to go here!

551
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,950
There's no way around this town.

552
00:56:57,689 --> 00:57:00,556
- What are you doing?
- We need food and water.

553
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:06,152
Bring the money.

554
00:57:39,263 --> 00:57:40,958
Where did you get these things?

555
00:57:48,873 --> 00:57:51,433
Where are these from? Ask him.

556
00:57:58,583 --> 00:57:59,982
From the city.

557
00:58:06,991 --> 00:58:09,186
And he got this from the city too?

558
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:18,463
Ask him what it is.

559
00:58:21,939 --> 00:58:23,270
He doesn't know.

560
00:58:24,308 --> 00:58:26,674
Does he know what any of these are?

561
00:58:33,584 --> 00:58:35,484
He says they're for a doctor.

562
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,253
He'll give them to you for a good price.

563
00:58:39,023 --> 00:58:42,959
Where's the doctor's office?
Dr. De Soto's office.

564
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,131
He says there is no doctor.

565
00:58:53,671 --> 00:58:56,231
Tell him I know these are stolen.

566
00:58:56,407 --> 00:59:00,503
If he won't say where Dr.
De Soto is, I'll tell the police.

567
00:59:15,393 --> 00:59:19,693
At the end of that street.
But he says the doctor's not there.

568
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:24,495
We'll see about that.

569
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:26,935
Where are you going?

570
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:19,650
Good afternoon.

571
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,117
Good afternoon.

572
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:23,059
Is the doctor in?

573
01:00:25,563 --> 01:00:28,031
This is Dr. De Soto's office?

574
01:00:29,467 --> 01:00:30,661
It was.

575
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:37,733
- He's not here anymore?
- The doctor passed away.

576
01:00:43,381 --> 01:00:44,905
Do you mind if I sit?

577
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,414
No, please. Sit down.

578
01:01:01,232 --> 01:01:04,258
Could you tell me how he died?

579
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:20,440
It was very unfortunate.

580
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:22,910
The guerrillas murdered him.

581
01:01:23,387 --> 01:01:25,617
Guerrillas came to this town?

582
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:29,248
How can you stop them?
When the army isn't here, they come.

583
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:32,123
They come to shop and visit friends.

584
01:01:32,296 --> 01:01:34,696
What did they have against
Dr. De Soto?

585
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:41,164
He treated wounded soldiers
when the army came.

586
01:01:41,939 --> 01:01:44,703
Then the guerrillas came back...

587
01:01:45,142 --> 01:01:48,043
...and punished the people
who had helped the army.

588
01:01:53,317 --> 01:01:57,913
What if he had refused to treat
the soldiers?

589
01:01:59,056 --> 01:02:01,286
Nobody refuses the men with guns.

590
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:06,458
They killed him to make an example.

591
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:11,834
So now you don't have a doctor.

592
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,770
It seems simpler that way.

593
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:20,035
Well?

594
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:22,776
Would you like a haircut?

595
01:02:28,753 --> 01:02:30,015
Does it hurt?

596
01:02:31,055 --> 01:02:32,113
Yes.

597
01:02:32,657 --> 01:02:34,056
A lot?

598
01:02:34,258 --> 01:02:35,782
Shut up.

599
01:02:36,761 --> 01:02:38,251
Did you get them?

600
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,898
Look, kid, here they are.

601
01:02:49,273 --> 01:02:52,367
The Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

602
01:03:00,117 --> 01:03:01,584
Let's go.

603
01:03:02,386 --> 01:03:03,819
Fine.

604
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:06,584
I'm not kidding.

605
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:08,983
Of course you're not.

606
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:22,105
The rich use the army to push
the Indians off the good land...

607
01:03:22,273 --> 01:03:23,968
...so they'll starve to death.

608
01:03:25,276 --> 01:03:30,179
So the Indians go pick their coffee.

609
01:03:32,149 --> 01:03:34,845
And they come back
with their pitiful wages...

610
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:39,547
...and those leeches suck them dry.

611
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,455
Don't stop.

612
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:50,666
I'm warning you.

613
01:03:50,835 --> 01:03:54,236
Go ahead, shoot.

614
01:03:54,772 --> 01:03:56,899
If the army or police see you alone
in the car...

615
01:03:57,074 --> 01:03:59,508
...they'll arrest you in a minute.

616
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,119
Hello.

617
01:04:15,292 --> 01:04:17,624
- Hello.
- Where are you headed?

618
01:04:18,429 --> 01:04:20,158
Further on.

619
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,447
Are you lost?

620
01:04:37,815 --> 01:04:41,012
Yes. For a long time now.

621
01:04:43,053 --> 01:04:44,247
Where do you live?

622
01:04:45,856 --> 01:04:47,517
Neither here nor there.

623
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,226
What's your name?

624
01:04:50,628 --> 01:04:52,255
Padre Portillo.

625
01:04:52,897 --> 01:04:55,491
But now people just call me
"The Ghost."

626
01:04:56,033 --> 01:04:57,398
You're a priest?

627
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,494
Not anymore.

628
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:03,834
I was when I came here.
I taught religion to the Indians...

629
01:05:04,008 --> 01:05:07,409
...through theater. People love drama.

630
01:05:07,578 --> 01:05:09,910
But I was a bad actor.

631
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,474
I stopped believing in my role,
and lost my faith.

632
01:05:14,218 --> 01:05:15,549
That's a shame.

633
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,978
A man should believe in something.

634
01:05:18,155 --> 01:05:19,144
Are you religious?

635
01:05:19,323 --> 01:05:24,625
No. I'm a doctor. A scientist.
I only believe in progress.

636
01:05:26,063 --> 01:05:28,725
- Always moving ahead.
- That's it.

637
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:32,728
These days I just believe in moving.
Never mind which direction.

638
01:05:33,337 --> 01:05:38,070
I have to admit my faith has been
shaken in the last few days.

639
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,367
I'm sorry for you.

640
01:05:43,013 --> 01:05:46,073
So you got a village girl pregnant.

641
01:05:46,617 --> 01:05:47,982
Oh, no.

642
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,920
Much worse than that.

643
01:05:51,288 --> 01:05:52,755
You stole from the church.

644
01:05:53,357 --> 01:05:55,257
There was nothing to steal.

645
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:58,027
I was a very good priest...

646
01:05:58,863 --> 01:06:00,728
...until I was tested.

647
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:04,266
Tested?

648
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:09,364
I was tested, and I was weak.

649
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:19,077
A priest without faith is like a soldier
without a rifle.

650
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:57,779
You can never save a life.

651
01:06:58,722 --> 01:07:03,022
You can make it longer,
make it better...

652
01:07:03,961 --> 01:07:05,656
...relieve pain...

653
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:08,861
...but in the end everyone dies.

654
01:07:11,635 --> 01:07:14,604
I wanted to leave something
in the world, something...

655
01:07:15,306 --> 01:07:17,035
Eternal?

656
01:07:19,677 --> 01:07:20,939
Something practical.

657
01:07:21,111 --> 01:07:24,547
Something to be passed on
from person to person.

658
01:07:26,483 --> 01:07:30,112
I wanted to save souls, but
how much better to save a life.

659
01:07:31,288 --> 01:07:33,756
I dreamed your life
and you dreamed mine.

660
01:07:35,526 --> 01:07:37,824
And we both ended up...

661
01:07:38,762 --> 01:07:40,491
...a total failure.

662
01:07:41,832 --> 01:07:45,529
You can't feel responsible
for those students.

663
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:48,664
The world is a hard place.

664
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:51,207
I should have warned them.

665
01:07:52,176 --> 01:07:54,974
If you didn't know what the danger
was, how could you warn them?

666
01:07:55,145 --> 01:07:57,375
I should have known.

667
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,374
Maybe.

668
01:08:03,387 --> 01:08:05,912
Maybe innocence is a sin.

669
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:11,493
Your driver doesn't like me.

670
01:08:13,197 --> 01:08:14,630
He's not my driver.

671
01:08:14,865 --> 01:08:17,663
He's just somebody heading
in the same direction.

672
01:08:20,404 --> 01:08:21,928
How far are you going?

673
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:26,807
Until I find my students.

674
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:34,341
You can stay with us tonight,
but in the morning you leave.

675
01:08:36,186 --> 01:08:37,653
May God bless you.

676
01:08:39,923 --> 01:08:41,220
Where are you going?

677
01:08:41,925 --> 01:08:45,554
To relieve myself,
if it's all right with you.

678
01:08:47,731 --> 01:08:49,358
Watch out for snakes.

679
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:16,990
Welcome.

680
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:26,594
We don't get many visitors here.

681
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:28,296
Where are you from?

682
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:31,433
Gum people go wherever the sap
is running.

683
01:09:34,011 --> 01:09:35,342
But where were you born?

684
01:09:36,246 --> 01:09:37,577
On the coast.

685
01:09:37,748 --> 01:09:41,684
In the mountains.
But we live wherever the work is.

686
01:09:45,656 --> 01:09:47,283
Do you know any stories?

687
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:49,617
Stories?

688
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:51,952
We don't get television out here.

689
01:09:52,463 --> 01:09:55,921
People come to places like this
to get away from television.

690
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,091
It's good to have a story at night.

691
01:09:58,268 --> 01:10:02,364
If you talk loud enough,
you can't hear the mosquitoes.

692
01:10:02,973 --> 01:10:04,736
I'll tell you a story.

693
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,200
A true story?

694
01:10:09,813 --> 01:10:12,043
It's a ghost story.

695
01:10:22,726 --> 01:10:25,695
There once was a priest...

696
01:10:26,697 --> 01:10:31,430
...who came to a mountain village
to teach the Bible.

697
01:10:33,303 --> 01:10:35,134
He used theater...

698
01:10:35,906 --> 01:10:39,467
...and put on plays with the children
to bring the holy word.

699
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:42,769
But...

700
01:10:45,149 --> 01:10:49,381
...it was the time when the army
was mad at the people.

701
01:10:49,553 --> 01:10:52,181
Because the priest helped
the people...

702
01:10:52,723 --> 01:10:55,089
...he became their enemy too.

703
01:10:58,395 --> 01:11:00,829
Before the killing began...

704
01:11:01,598 --> 01:11:03,361
...there were threats.

705
01:11:05,335 --> 01:11:06,927
Anonymous notes...

706
01:11:08,572 --> 01:11:11,063
...things painted on the church.

707
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,808
But the people begged him not to go.

708
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:25,012
They thought that if he stayed,
God would protect them.

709
01:11:29,426 --> 01:11:34,887
The army burned Los Sueños,
which was above the village...

710
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,926
...but the people there
had all become Baptists.

711
01:11:41,438 --> 01:11:45,306
Then they burned El Chino,
which was below the village.

712
01:11:46,109 --> 01:11:48,805
<i>In El Chino everyone was Catholic.</i>

713
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:03,816
<i>But nothing bad or unusual</i>
<i>happened in the priest's village.</i>

714
01:12:05,062 --> 01:12:06,927
<i>They were corn people...</i>

715
01:12:07,331 --> 01:12:09,060
<i>... working the land...</i>

716
01:12:10,067 --> 01:12:12,797
<i>... having children</i>
<i>and trying to feed them.</i>

717
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:15,530
<i>Nobody was interested in politics.</i>

718
01:12:15,906 --> 01:12:18,238
<i>So when the army came...</i>

719
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:22,378
<i>... their only thought was to hide.</i>

720
01:12:26,617 --> 01:12:31,213
The <i>comandante</i>
left us this list of five men.

721
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:35,222
Five men and our Padre.

722
01:12:35,692 --> 01:12:38,752
These are men he says
we must execute.

723
01:12:38,962 --> 01:12:41,362
- What have they done?
- He says they are subversives.

724
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:43,726
He says they help the guerrillas.

725
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:45,892
That isn't true.

726
01:12:46,069 --> 01:12:50,062
The <i>comandante</i> says it is.
And he has men with guns.

727
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,003
You saw them.

728
01:12:52,175 --> 01:12:54,575
Can we fight them?

729
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,372
With machetes? With hoes?

730
01:12:56,546 --> 01:13:00,448
He says it's our duty to march
the traitors to our cemetery...

731
01:13:00,617 --> 01:13:05,987
...to dig holes, to kill them and
leave them there until he returns.

732
01:13:06,156 --> 01:13:10,752
He says if we don't do this,
he'll know we are bad people...

733
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:14,921
...and his soldiers will burn our village
and kill us all...

734
01:13:15,098 --> 01:13:18,226
...like in El Chino
and Los Sueños.

735
01:13:18,402 --> 01:13:20,302
What if we run?

736
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:25,874
Then they'll kill us in small groups,
instead of all together.

737
01:13:26,043 --> 01:13:27,601
We should have a vote on this.

738
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:32,272
We have three choices.

739
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:35,748
Try to fight and be slaughtered.

740
01:13:35,919 --> 01:13:38,649
Try to run and be slaughtered...

741
01:13:38,822 --> 01:13:44,590
...or sacrifice the men
on the <i>comandante</i>'s list.

742
01:13:45,529 --> 01:13:49,556
May I see the hands
of those who wish to fight?

743
01:13:52,269 --> 01:13:54,328
And those who wish to run?

744
01:13:58,275 --> 01:14:01,244
And those who think we must do
as the <i>comandante</i> tells us.

745
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,811
Father? Father?

746
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,684
You haven't voted.

747
01:14:16,093 --> 01:14:17,993
I'm sorry.

748
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:21,790
I vote with the majority.

749
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:31,634
Thank you.
On the list are Padre Portillo...

750
01:14:31,808 --> 01:14:34,470
...lsidro Mendez, Jacobo Duran...

751
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:38,273
...Eufemio Ramirez, Sixto Lima...

752
01:14:38,448 --> 01:14:42,441
...and I, Moises lbarra, am the sixth.

753
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:48,353
These men have an hour
to be with their families...

754
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:52,655
...and then we'll all meet
at the cemetery.

755
01:14:52,829 --> 01:14:56,162
It's best if we do this as quickly
as possible.

756
01:15:19,456 --> 01:15:22,983
<i>As a boy the priest read</i>
<i>the histories of the martyrs...</i>

757
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,526
<i>... as if they were comic books.</i>

758
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:32,092
<i>He often imagined his heroic death</i>
<i>at the hands of the infidels...</i>

759
01:15:32,269 --> 01:15:35,261
<i>... a golden ray of light</i>
<i>lifting him to the heavens...</i>

760
01:15:35,705 --> 01:15:39,004
<i>... his soul resting</i>
<i>at the right side of God.</i>

761
01:15:39,342 --> 01:15:40,331
<i>But...</i>

762
01:15:41,344 --> 01:15:43,812
<i>... when the reality was upon him,</i>
<i>well...</i>

763
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:56,256
<i>The church called the gospel</i>
<i>he taught liberation theology.</i>

764
01:15:58,061 --> 01:16:01,292
<i>But he chose to liberate himself.</i>

765
01:16:24,187 --> 01:16:26,815
<i>He knew the people of the village.</i>

766
01:16:29,493 --> 01:16:33,930
<i>He had eaten in their homes,</i>
<i>shared their work...</i>

767
01:16:35,265 --> 01:16:37,825
<i>... baptized their babies.</i>

768
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,503
<i>Because he knew them so well,</i>
<i>he could imagine every detail...</i>

769
01:16:42,672 --> 01:16:44,537
<i>... of what would happen next.</i>

770
01:17:03,727 --> 01:17:09,029
<i>Gonzalo, the sacristan,</i>
<i>led the Catholic part of the ceremony.</i>

771
01:17:10,267 --> 01:17:12,929
<i>The priest's absence</i>
<i>was noted by all...</i>

772
01:17:13,537 --> 01:17:16,028
<i>... but nobody spoke of it.</i>

773
01:17:16,206 --> 01:17:18,970
<i>Their only hope was that the</i>
comandante <i>wouldn't blame them...</i>

774
01:17:19,142 --> 01:17:20,370
<i>... for his lack of faith.</i>

775
01:17:22,078 --> 01:17:23,375
<i>And so it went.</i>

776
01:17:54,477 --> 01:17:58,675
<i>They could have sent someone</i>
<i>to bring him back if they wanted to.</i>

777
01:18:01,585 --> 01:18:03,553
<i>But they didn't.</i>

778
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,614
<i>I suppose they had their reasons.</i>

779
01:18:11,461 --> 01:18:13,520
<i>They waited for the comandante.</i>

780
01:18:22,973 --> 01:18:24,497
Patience.

781
01:18:27,277 --> 01:18:30,178
The villagers clear a section
of jungle...

782
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:36,682
...knowing it will take seven,
eight years for a decent yield.

783
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:43,016
Do you know anyone
with that kind of patience?

784
01:18:46,563 --> 01:18:48,428
What happened to the village?

785
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,765
I've been to where it was.

786
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,299
They were killed?

787
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:01,768
I obviously don't believe in heaven,
doctor.

788
01:19:02,712 --> 01:19:04,441
But hell...

789
01:19:05,982 --> 01:19:08,644
...I can give you a tour of hell.

790
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:12,650
And the priest?

791
01:19:13,556 --> 01:19:16,525
I told you it was a ghost story.

792
01:19:18,428 --> 01:19:22,159
The priest wanders the roads
and pathways of the country...

793
01:19:23,933 --> 01:19:26,094
...never sleeping in the same place.

794
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:31,873
He is neither here nor there.
A ghost.

795
01:19:35,545 --> 01:19:38,309
I'd hate to meet a ghost like that.

796
01:19:39,683 --> 01:19:42,618
What would you do
in the same situation?

797
01:19:43,253 --> 01:19:44,550
If it was me?

798
01:19:47,057 --> 01:19:48,422
Who knows?

799
01:19:49,192 --> 01:19:50,659
I'm not a priest.

800
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:54,293
Priests are not regular people.

801
01:19:58,568 --> 01:20:01,196
They're not supposed to be.

802
01:21:55,718 --> 01:21:57,879
Could you hear my confession?

803
01:22:00,557 --> 01:22:02,718
I'm not a priest anymore.

804
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:05,156
I don't wear a cassock, see?

805
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,191
I was a soldier...

806
01:22:08,498 --> 01:22:10,693
...but now I don't wear a uniform.

807
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:13,892
Does that mean I haven't
killed anyone?

808
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:23,510
Killing the enemy in battle
isn't the same as murder.

809
01:22:36,626 --> 01:22:39,254
It's been a long time
since my last confession.

810
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:43,860
Bless me, Father...

811
01:22:45,802 --> 01:22:47,463
...for I have sinned.

812
01:22:52,108 --> 01:22:54,838
Do it! Give it to him!

813
01:22:55,011 --> 01:22:58,344
Don't be a faggot!
Give it to him!

814
01:22:59,415 --> 01:23:02,407
Hurry up! Kill him!

815
01:23:45,528 --> 01:23:47,723
That was only the first.

816
01:23:48,531 --> 01:23:50,226
It was my initiation.

817
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,365
I'm not a priest.

818
01:23:54,103 --> 01:23:56,230
I can't absolve you.

819
01:23:58,207 --> 01:24:00,004
Then what good are you?

820
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,139
I ought to kill you.

821
01:24:02,879 --> 01:24:04,312
As you wish.

822
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:17,548
Father...

823
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,056
...tell me...

824
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:25,291
...are sins only things that you do?

825
01:24:26,803 --> 01:24:29,203
Or can they be things that you
don't do?

826
01:24:29,739 --> 01:24:32,867
There are sins of commission
and sins of omission.

827
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:35,043
And then there's original sin.

828
01:24:36,012 --> 01:24:39,072
We're all born guilty in the eyes
of the Lord.

829
01:24:40,016 --> 01:24:43,713
What if a man has hurt someone
without wanting to...

830
01:24:43,886 --> 01:24:46,946
...with no intention?

831
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:50,615
He's probably not a sinner.

832
01:24:50,793 --> 01:24:52,954
But he's an idiot for sure.

833
01:24:53,696 --> 01:24:57,223
Of course. An idiot or a coward.

834
01:24:57,767 --> 01:25:01,533
But if God kept such people
out of heaven...

835
01:25:01,904 --> 01:25:03,895
...he'd be very lonely.

836
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:06,267
Oh, shit!

837
01:25:06,743 --> 01:25:07,903
Oh, shit!

838
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:11,678
- Pass them!
- It's too narrow.

839
01:25:11,848 --> 01:25:14,009
- Pass them!
- What's the hurry?

840
01:25:14,183 --> 01:25:15,912
You, shut up!

841
01:25:16,085 --> 01:25:17,450
As you wish.

842
01:25:20,023 --> 01:25:21,285
Hang on.

843
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:01,594
What a ride!

844
01:26:03,266 --> 01:26:04,665
Are you happy now?

845
01:26:05,802 --> 01:26:06,860
Shit!

846
01:26:07,637 --> 01:26:09,195
Shit!

847
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:13,072
Careful what you say, doctor.

848
01:26:37,266 --> 01:26:38,733
Your identification.

849
01:26:45,374 --> 01:26:47,638
- Dr. Fuentes?
- That's right.

850
01:26:48,344 --> 01:26:49,641
And the others?

851
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:57,044
This is his driver and his son.

852
01:26:59,322 --> 01:27:00,380
And you?

853
01:27:01,057 --> 01:27:02,456
A ghost.

854
01:27:03,793 --> 01:27:07,559
The doctor was kind enough to
pick me up in the middle of nowhere.

855
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:09,630
Come with me.

856
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:23,776
I absolve you.

857
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:31,185
Stop when you reach the camp.

858
01:27:33,723 --> 01:27:35,486
Why did he do that?

859
01:27:36,826 --> 01:27:38,157
He's crazy.

860
01:27:39,095 --> 01:27:41,393
And he's a lousy priest.

861
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:07,051
Modelo
COMMUNITY OF HOPE

862
01:29:32,808 --> 01:29:36,369
They bring people here
after they burn their villages.

863
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,372
Why?

864
01:29:38,547 --> 01:29:39,912
To protect them.

865
01:29:40,383 --> 01:29:42,749
Protect them? From what?

866
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:44,947
From the guerrillas.

867
01:29:46,188 --> 01:29:48,122
They're afraid of the guerrillas?

868
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:52,353
They're country people.
They're afraid of everything.

869
01:29:52,528 --> 01:29:54,689
The army thinks they'll
help the guerrillas...

870
01:29:54,864 --> 01:29:57,298
...if they don't watch them all the time.

871
01:30:04,273 --> 01:30:06,764
Our doctor comes only
every three months.

872
01:30:07,543 --> 01:30:10,410
Wasn't there a doctor in
Pico de Aguila before you got here?

873
01:30:10,579 --> 01:30:11,739
Dr. Hidalgo?

874
01:30:11,914 --> 01:30:13,347
He was executed.

875
01:30:14,717 --> 01:30:16,617
Almost a year ago.

876
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:18,579
Why?

877
01:30:18,854 --> 01:30:20,685
For helping the guerrillas.

878
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:22,481
You're sure of that?

879
01:30:22,658 --> 01:30:25,821
Why else would an educated man
live out here?

880
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:29,224
Maybe he just wanted to help
the Indians.

881
01:30:29,865 --> 01:30:31,355
It's the same thing.

882
01:30:42,144 --> 01:30:44,339
How come your driver wasn't driving?

883
01:30:47,049 --> 01:30:48,539
A snake bit him.

884
01:30:49,185 --> 01:30:52,382
He took a leak in the bushes,
and a snake bit him.

885
01:30:53,422 --> 01:30:55,947
That'll teach him to hold his water.

886
01:31:00,763 --> 01:31:03,231
It's further up in the jungle.

887
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:05,196
They call it Cerca del Cielo.

888
01:31:05,368 --> 01:31:06,733
Fairy tales.

889
01:31:06,902 --> 01:31:09,166
Everybody says it's true.

890
01:31:11,741 --> 01:31:13,606
Has anybody ever come back
from there?

891
01:31:13,776 --> 01:31:16,472
Why would anyone want to
come back to Modelo?

892
01:31:24,253 --> 01:31:26,221
You should be resting.

893
01:31:26,422 --> 01:31:28,583
If that priest sings, I'm fucked.

894
01:31:31,961 --> 01:31:35,294
Help me with these people.
Ask what their problems are.

895
01:31:35,464 --> 01:31:37,227
I don't understand this dialect.

896
01:31:46,075 --> 01:31:48,441
- She's got ulcers.
- What color?

897
01:31:48,778 --> 01:31:51,338
- White.
- It's a virus.

898
01:31:52,815 --> 01:31:54,442
You treat it with this.

899
01:31:54,617 --> 01:31:57,142
Three pills a day for two weeks.

900
01:32:05,828 --> 01:32:08,023
How many years were you
in the army?

901
01:32:09,498 --> 01:32:10,556
Two.

902
01:32:11,434 --> 01:32:13,994
We treated skin rashes, dysentery...

903
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:15,694
...now and then gunshot wounds.

904
01:32:15,871 --> 01:32:17,304
You operated?

905
01:32:17,706 --> 01:32:19,469
Only if there was no doctor there.

906
01:32:20,376 --> 01:32:23,641
Sometimes they died,
sometimes they didn't.

907
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:28,448
We never had much medicine.
The officers were selling it.

908
01:32:32,354 --> 01:32:34,686
I got the whole story.

909
01:32:35,391 --> 01:32:37,723
These people are from
Pico de Aguila.

910
01:32:38,127 --> 01:32:41,096
They brought them here
and then burned their town.

911
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:44,328
Your friend, Dr. Hidalgo,
is dead.

912
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,797
The sergeant told me.

913
01:32:46,836 --> 01:32:49,805
The people say there's a village
further on.

914
01:32:49,972 --> 01:32:53,408
It's so high and hidden
that the army can't find it.

915
01:32:54,577 --> 01:32:56,135
They call it Cerca del Cielo.

916
01:32:56,579 --> 01:32:58,706
There's always rumors like that.

917
01:32:59,315 --> 01:33:04,480
They say the refugees from the
burnt villages are hiding up there.

918
01:33:04,653 --> 01:33:07,281
And a young woman doctor
lives there.

919
01:33:08,424 --> 01:33:10,289
A doctor named...

920
01:33:10,726 --> 01:33:11,818
Montoya?

921
01:33:12,194 --> 01:33:13,627
Yes. That's it.

922
01:33:15,898 --> 01:33:17,923
She's the last one.

923
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:22,596
Come forward.

924
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:30,445
Come closer.

925
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:34,972
Ask what her problem is.

926
01:33:36,485 --> 01:33:37,474
You.

927
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:50,128
The old woman says
this girl's stomach hurts.

928
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:51,388
Since when?

929
01:33:55,271 --> 01:33:56,829
Since they raped her.

930
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:58,731
She hasn't spoken a word
since that day.

931
01:33:58,908 --> 01:34:01,206
- When was that?
- Two years ago.

932
01:34:02,378 --> 01:34:03,868
The problem is in her head.

933
01:34:05,347 --> 01:34:07,679
- Give her a pill.
- I can't cure imaginary diseases.

934
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,579
I'm not a psychologist.

935
01:34:16,091 --> 01:34:17,422
Take these.

936
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,525
May God bless you.

937
01:34:45,988 --> 01:34:48,422
If you want to come it has to be now.

938
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:09,234
You'd better head back to the capital.

939
01:35:09,812 --> 01:35:12,406
We heard there are guerrillas
operating around here.

940
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:15,013
They stole some tourist's car.

941
01:35:15,618 --> 01:35:17,882
What happened to the man
who was with us?

942
01:35:18,053 --> 01:35:19,953
You shouldn't pick up strangers.

943
01:35:21,724 --> 01:35:22,850
Get going.

944
01:35:40,476 --> 01:35:42,910
Why didn't you turn me in?

945
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:46,509
I should have.

946
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:48,712
I'm a bad citizen.

947
01:35:53,589 --> 01:35:55,352
You won't find her.

948
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:57,653
There's nothing up there.

949
01:36:04,266 --> 01:36:05,665
Go around her.

950
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,311
What are you doing here?

951
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:30,349
She wants to go to Cerca del Cielo.

952
01:36:30,893 --> 01:36:32,520
We don't know where it is.

953
01:36:33,262 --> 01:36:34,661
So?

954
01:37:04,927 --> 01:37:07,487
We should be charging bus fare.

955
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,907
You'll be warmer if you
come near the fire.

956
01:37:25,981 --> 01:37:27,846
She's afraid of us.

957
01:37:30,185 --> 01:37:31,413
Then why'd she come?

958
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:35,183
She's more afraid of the soldiers
at Modelo.

959
01:37:42,798 --> 01:37:45,460
So this is what's left of Pico.

960
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:51,934
I think Pico is behind us now.
This is some other place.

961
01:37:52,107 --> 01:37:54,439
Another place where everybody
is dead.

962
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:56,134
Or gone to Cerca del Cielo.

963
01:37:56,311 --> 01:37:58,404
There is no such place.

964
01:37:59,114 --> 01:38:01,082
How do you know?

965
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:05,509
When I was in the army
they talked about this place.

966
01:38:06,922 --> 01:38:08,514
But we never found it.

967
01:38:09,158 --> 01:38:11,217
So it's really well-hidden.

968
01:38:11,393 --> 01:38:13,884
We never found it
because it doesn't exist.

969
01:38:16,899 --> 01:38:18,958
We even searched with helicopters.

970
01:38:19,835 --> 01:38:22,998
If people had cleared land to plant...

971
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:25,570
...we'd have seen it from above.

972
01:38:26,542 --> 01:38:28,772
If they haven't cleared land...

973
01:38:29,511 --> 01:38:31,706
...they'd have starved to death.

974
01:38:31,914 --> 01:38:35,406
Just because you haven't seen it
doesn't mean it's not there.

975
01:38:37,419 --> 01:38:40,183
You can believe in heaven
if you want, kid.

976
01:38:41,857 --> 01:38:43,984
See where it gets you.

977
01:38:47,963 --> 01:38:50,523
So why are you coming with us?

978
01:38:52,868 --> 01:38:54,699
Where else can I go?

979
01:40:13,081 --> 01:40:14,070
Señorita...

980
01:40:16,985 --> 01:40:19,852
...if you shoot yourself,
you'll wake up the others.

981
01:40:22,224 --> 01:40:25,022
If you want to, go ahead...

982
01:40:27,462 --> 01:40:31,626
...but it seems a waste when we're
almost to Cerca del Cielo.

983
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:40,975
I know Domingo said it
doesn't exist but he's just bitter.

984
01:40:42,778 --> 01:40:44,177
He's been disappointed so often.

985
01:40:44,346 --> 01:40:46,246
He's lost all hope.

986
01:40:54,990 --> 01:40:56,048
You know...

987
01:40:57,526 --> 01:41:00,086
...Cerca del Cielo
is a very special place.

988
01:41:01,296 --> 01:41:05,858
Where the air is like a caress,
where gentle waters flow...

989
01:41:08,236 --> 01:41:12,104
...where wings of peace lift
the burdens from your shoulders.

990
01:41:12,274 --> 01:41:14,572
A place where you can forget.

991
01:41:16,311 --> 01:41:22,113
A place where each day is a gift
and each person is reborn.

992
01:41:26,021 --> 01:41:29,047
And it's not far from here.
Just a little further on.

993
01:42:07,262 --> 01:42:08,923
Right.

994
01:42:17,706 --> 01:42:20,402
He hates it when people play
with his things.

995
01:42:24,846 --> 01:42:25,972
Shit.

996
01:42:32,254 --> 01:42:33,585
Let's go.

997
01:42:38,794 --> 01:42:40,455
There's no path.

998
01:43:26,708 --> 01:43:30,007
- Get her!
- Watch out!

999
01:43:32,848 --> 01:43:34,679
- Grab her!
- Where is she?

1000
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:36,181
Let me go!

1001
01:43:36,351 --> 01:43:39,809
- Let me go!
- Look for her, idiot!

1002
01:43:48,396 --> 01:43:52,093
Hurry up! You gotta get it
while they're still fresh.

1003
01:43:54,336 --> 01:43:57,271
No! Don't do it!

1004
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:59,430
Don't do it!

1005
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:13,610
Keep going!

1006
01:44:16,658 --> 01:44:18,285
I have to rest.

1007
01:44:20,762 --> 01:44:21,786
Move it!

1008
01:44:24,866 --> 01:44:26,356
Go ahead...

1009
01:44:27,002 --> 01:44:28,594
...shoot.

1010
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:39,842
Fuck it!

1011
01:44:41,383 --> 01:44:43,214
You'll get that wound infected.

1012
01:44:59,734 --> 01:45:02,168
Human beings can't survive here.

1013
01:45:02,337 --> 01:45:06,330
Jaguars, snakes, insects
that eat everything in sight.

1014
01:45:07,542 --> 01:45:10,340
You'd have to burn it all
and start from scratch.

1015
01:45:11,146 --> 01:45:14,843
But why come here in the first place?

1016
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:17,641
To get away from white people.

1017
01:45:20,522 --> 01:45:23,047
I guess that might be worth it.

1018
01:45:23,658 --> 01:45:27,116
There should be somewhere
that white people aren't allowed.

1019
01:45:40,942 --> 01:45:42,603
Hello!

1020
01:45:42,777 --> 01:45:46,042
Hello! Hello, señores!

1021
01:45:46,214 --> 01:45:49,706
Hey, over here! How you doing?

1022
01:45:49,885 --> 01:45:52,217
Good afternoon!

1023
01:45:53,521 --> 01:45:56,251
It's a unique mixture of architectures.

1024
01:45:56,725 --> 01:45:58,716
- You wouldn't believe.
- It isn't clear yet...

1025
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:04,457
...if the Lotecs were a homogenous
group, mongrelized culture.

1026
01:46:04,633 --> 01:46:07,158
Most of the evidence suggests
they were driven up here...

1027
01:46:07,335 --> 01:46:09,098
...by the more dominant civilizations.

1028
01:46:09,271 --> 01:46:13,503
A man stole our car at gunpoint.

1029
01:46:13,675 --> 01:46:17,702
Like <i>The Treasure</i>
<i>of the Sierra Madre</i>.

1030
01:46:18,647 --> 01:46:22,640
The police found the car
but without tires.

1031
01:46:22,817 --> 01:46:25,115
Understand? Not one.

1032
01:46:25,287 --> 01:46:28,586
Another theory is that this site
was founded by runaways...

1033
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:30,952
...from different cities in the lowlands.

1034
01:46:31,126 --> 01:46:32,991
Possibly...

1035
01:46:33,161 --> 01:46:35,254
...people earmarked for sacrifice.

1036
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:38,524
Americans are all obsessed
with these sacrifices.

1037
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:39,689
That's true.

1038
01:46:39,868 --> 01:46:43,326
Honey, he says we're hung up
on sacrifice.

1039
01:46:43,505 --> 01:46:47,532
Well, the concept of sacrifice
is a tough one to sell in the States.

1040
01:46:48,176 --> 01:46:50,371
You know, you don't look so good,
doctor.

1041
01:46:51,346 --> 01:46:54,747
This is the tropics.
You gotta watch yourself.

1042
01:46:58,019 --> 01:46:59,145
Are you okay?

1043
01:46:59,321 --> 01:47:00,948
Yeah? Fine?

1044
01:47:03,024 --> 01:47:05,015
They were gone before the Spanish
got here.

1045
01:47:05,193 --> 01:47:07,127
They fell apart on their own.

1046
01:47:07,696 --> 01:47:09,789
Civil war, family feuds...

1047
01:47:09,965 --> 01:47:12,024
Like Europe during the same period.

1048
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:15,061
Oh, yes, Europe.

1049
01:47:15,236 --> 01:47:18,933
Europe was in much worse shape.

1050
01:47:19,107 --> 01:47:20,199
Much worse.

1051
01:47:21,509 --> 01:47:23,340
Europe bit the big one.

1052
01:47:23,645 --> 01:47:25,704
Here at least there was...

1053
01:47:26,514 --> 01:47:27,538
...some organization...

1054
01:47:27,716 --> 01:47:31,117
...some pattern to the killing...

1055
01:47:31,286 --> 01:47:32,753
...some meaning.

1056
01:47:33,588 --> 01:47:37,354
Europe was all warlords,
feudal disputes...

1057
01:47:37,525 --> 01:47:39,186
...little ethnic conflicts.

1058
01:47:39,361 --> 01:47:42,228
It is so peaceful here.

1059
01:47:42,731 --> 01:47:44,790
How is it? Tranquil, right?

1060
01:47:46,835 --> 01:47:50,362
Battled the jungle to carve out a living
for themselves.

1061
01:47:50,839 --> 01:47:54,240
Incas, Aztecs, Olmecs...

1062
01:47:54,409 --> 01:47:56,775
...Toltecs, Zapotecs.

1063
01:47:57,746 --> 01:47:58,735
And here?

1064
01:47:59,047 --> 01:48:02,676
Here? Here the jungle won.

1065
01:48:02,917 --> 01:48:04,851
Are you sure you'll be all right?

1066
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:10,117
Don't worry. Andrew has
a magnificent sense of direction.

1067
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:13,191
We'll probably see you at the hotel
in Tres Cruces.

1068
01:48:13,361 --> 01:48:15,329
Yes, probably.

1069
01:48:17,866 --> 01:48:20,426
I was a guide at the ruins at Xtal.

1070
01:48:20,602 --> 01:48:25,505
The gringos gave me bigger tips
if I made up bloody stories.

1071
01:48:25,673 --> 01:48:29,074
I told them the priests
ripped out the virgins' hearts...

1072
01:48:29,577 --> 01:48:31,636
...and then ate them.

1073
01:48:32,547 --> 01:48:34,606
It will be cold here tonight.

1074
01:48:36,418 --> 01:48:38,909
I must be going crazy.

1075
01:48:48,663 --> 01:48:50,130
Good evening.

1076
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,797
You're visiting the ruins?

1077
01:48:54,235 --> 01:48:55,930
We were resting here.

1078
01:48:58,506 --> 01:49:00,098
You know this man?

1079
01:49:05,213 --> 01:49:06,373
I do.

1080
01:49:06,781 --> 01:49:10,239
He says he escaped from Modelo,
and the soldiers shot him.

1081
01:49:10,418 --> 01:49:15,754
He says you found him on the road
and treated his wounds.

1082
01:49:18,059 --> 01:49:19,526
That's true.

1083
01:49:21,129 --> 01:49:23,393
Where did he get this?

1084
01:49:24,499 --> 01:49:25,796
He must have stolen it.

1085
01:49:25,967 --> 01:49:29,061
I wish he had stolen more
than three bullets.

1086
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:36,799
Untie him.

1087
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,655
Why are you here?

1088
01:49:53,828 --> 01:49:56,524
I'm looking for a friend,
Dr. Montoya.

1089
01:49:56,698 --> 01:49:59,599
I heard she fled to these mountains
and lives with refugees.

1090
01:49:59,767 --> 01:50:01,667
Dr. Montoya is at Cerca del Cielo.

1091
01:50:03,338 --> 01:50:04,669
You're sure?

1092
01:50:04,939 --> 01:50:10,104
The army tried to kill her,
but she escaped and went up there.

1093
01:50:10,879 --> 01:50:12,437
That's what people say.

1094
01:50:12,614 --> 01:50:15,014
- Where is it?
- We can't tell you.

1095
01:50:16,084 --> 01:50:18,109
She's my friend, my student.

1096
01:50:18,286 --> 01:50:20,220
We don't know where it is.

1097
01:50:20,522 --> 01:50:24,618
This village, Cerca del Cielo,
we've never seen it.

1098
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:30,492
Maybe it's just a rumor, like the story
about Dr. Montoya.

1099
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:35,534
Whenever we look for it, we keep
circling back and end up here.

1100
01:50:39,574 --> 01:50:41,041
Is there any food left?

1101
01:50:41,342 --> 01:50:43,333
Please, help yourselves.

1102
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:52,415
You people should go home.
It's dangerous in these mountains.

1103
01:50:52,587 --> 01:50:53,884
Listen...

1104
01:50:54,989 --> 01:50:57,253
...do you have anything for blisters?

1105
01:51:36,164 --> 01:51:38,325
- They do have it.
- No, they don't.

1106
01:51:38,499 --> 01:51:41,662
- What do you know?
- They don't have it.

1107
01:51:41,836 --> 01:51:46,398
Why should I believe you?
Why not ask the doctor?

1108
01:51:46,574 --> 01:51:48,337
He ought to know.

1109
01:51:51,145 --> 01:51:52,134
Sir.

1110
01:51:53,848 --> 01:51:54,837
Yes?

1111
01:51:55,016 --> 01:51:56,643
You're from the city?

1112
01:51:57,018 --> 01:51:58,280
That's right.

1113
01:51:59,787 --> 01:52:02,984
You know the ice-cream store
near the bus station?

1114
01:52:03,157 --> 01:52:07,059
- I used to take my daughter there.
- What flavors do they have?

1115
01:52:07,929 --> 01:52:09,123
Lots of flavors.

1116
01:52:10,064 --> 01:52:12,430
Say what they are.
They're listed out front.

1117
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:18,505
There's chocolate, vanilla, mango...

1118
01:52:20,008 --> 01:52:23,637
- Lots of them.
- Tell us more, all of them.

1119
01:52:24,679 --> 01:52:27,876
Okay. Chocolate, vanilla, mango...

1120
01:52:28,049 --> 01:52:32,110
...guava, coconut, guanábana,
pineapple...

1121
01:52:32,287 --> 01:52:34,050
...strawberry...

1122
01:52:35,757 --> 01:52:38,123
...banana, coffee, orange...

1123
01:52:38,293 --> 01:52:40,625
...let's see, hazelnut.

1124
01:52:40,795 --> 01:52:44,526
- And rum flavor?
- Rum and tamarind...

1125
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:49,500
...and something green, like mint.

1126
01:52:49,937 --> 01:52:53,134
I want chocolate and coconut.

1127
01:52:54,142 --> 01:52:55,700
You only get one.

1128
01:52:55,877 --> 01:52:57,242
Why?

1129
01:52:57,412 --> 01:52:59,403
Because that's the rule.

1130
01:52:59,947 --> 01:53:02,211
How come you make the rules?

1131
01:53:03,117 --> 01:53:06,018
Because I've eaten ice cream
and you haven't.

1132
01:53:08,389 --> 01:53:11,051
Have you fought against the army?

1133
01:53:11,392 --> 01:53:12,552
Sure.

1134
01:53:13,027 --> 01:53:15,154
We're not just fucking around up here.

1135
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:18,398
We attack them and they run.

1136
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:23,332
And we take whatever guns
and ammo they leave behind.

1137
01:53:23,504 --> 01:53:24,869
But they never leave food.

1138
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:28,202
They know if they brought food,
we'd never leave them alone.

1139
01:53:28,376 --> 01:53:31,243
You two, go to sleep.

1140
01:53:31,412 --> 01:53:34,813
We leave before sunrise.

1141
01:53:34,982 --> 01:53:36,540
Sleep.

1142
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:46,257
Chocolate and mango.

1143
01:54:38,045 --> 01:54:41,378
What do you think they'll find?

1144
01:54:41,549 --> 01:54:43,016
It doesn't much matter.

1145
01:54:43,184 --> 01:54:48,417
When people start into a story
they have to see the end...

1146
01:54:48,589 --> 01:54:51,285
...or they aren't happy.

1147
01:54:54,762 --> 01:54:55,956
How do the tortillas look?

1148
01:54:56,130 --> 01:55:00,191
Like whoever made them
doesn't know what she's doing.

1149
01:55:06,607 --> 01:55:08,199
They're here.

1150
01:55:57,458 --> 01:55:59,983
I'll ask him for you.

1151
01:56:00,161 --> 01:56:04,427
There's no hurry. He's come to stay.

1152
01:57:19,941 --> 01:57:21,431
Welcome.

1153
01:57:22,877 --> 01:57:23,935
Hello.

1154
01:57:24,111 --> 01:57:26,875
You can stay if you want.

1155
01:57:27,481 --> 01:57:32,043
But here we live under the trees.

1156
01:57:33,154 --> 01:57:34,621
Where is the doctor?

1157
01:57:35,056 --> 01:57:37,149
There is no doctor here.

1158
01:57:37,592 --> 01:57:40,789
I heard she was here with you.

1159
01:57:41,562 --> 01:57:43,154
Dr. Montoya.

1160
01:57:44,265 --> 01:57:48,258
This is where rumors come to die.

1161
01:57:51,472 --> 01:57:53,497
Good luck.

1162
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:11,421
This village is fucked.

1163
01:58:11,592 --> 01:58:16,859
The sky people live here.
They eat air and shit clouds.

1164
01:58:17,665 --> 01:58:20,099
This is my legacy.

1165
01:58:20,735 --> 01:58:22,896
Modelo looked better than this.

1166
01:58:24,672 --> 01:58:27,607
Every man should leave a legacy...

1167
01:58:28,409 --> 01:58:31,572
...something he built,
something he left in the world.

1168
01:58:34,482 --> 01:58:38,976
Someone he passed his knowledge to,
who'll carry on for him.

1169
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:48,887
This is what I leave.

1170
01:58:54,335 --> 01:58:55,825
At least...

1171
01:58:58,506 --> 01:59:00,974
...I don't have to climb anymore.

1172
01:59:04,712 --> 01:59:07,146
The ruins looked better than this.

1173
01:59:07,314 --> 01:59:09,839
Is there any place you like?

1174
01:59:10,017 --> 01:59:12,076
There must be another place.

1175
01:59:12,253 --> 01:59:13,948
Somewhere...

1176
01:59:15,256 --> 01:59:17,156
...even further on.

1177
01:59:19,126 --> 01:59:21,560
Can I have my 2 reals back?

1178
01:59:22,563 --> 01:59:26,226
It's not what you had planned
for your vacation, is it, doctor?

1179
01:59:48,122 --> 01:59:49,885
Dead.

1180
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:54,252
Really?

1181
01:59:55,496 --> 01:59:56,622
He's dead.

1182
02:00:06,674 --> 02:00:09,074
They'll steal this if we leave it here.

1183
02:00:20,755 --> 02:00:23,349
She says she needs a doctor.

1184
02:00:23,891 --> 02:00:25,620
There is no doctor.

1185
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:27,254
The doctor is dead.

1186
02:00:38,339 --> 02:00:40,671
There's a piece of metal
in her mother's leg.

1187
02:00:41,609 --> 02:00:45,773
She stepped on a mine that the army
dropped from a plane.

1188
02:00:45,946 --> 02:00:49,905
- She can't stand up.
- The doctor is dead.

1189
02:01:00,394 --> 02:01:01,691
I'm not a doctor.

1190
02:01:31,959 --> 02:01:33,119
Okay.

1191
02:01:34,461 --> 02:01:35,485
Where's your mother?
