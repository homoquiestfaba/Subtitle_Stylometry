1
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,900
Have a drink.

2
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,600
I know that we haven't been
 seeing each other lately.

3
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,520
I hope you won't be upset at me...

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,520
for calling only when I need a favor.

5
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,240
Sorry to bother you.

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,190
Actually, I should be the one doing this.

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,930
But I just got transferred to a new section
at work, and things have been hectic.

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,340
You know my wedding will be held in Hawaii.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,820
I need someone who can secure
a good venue for the post-reception party.

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,840
Your company published 
guide books for Hawaii, right?

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,150
Were you in charge of those?

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,110
On occasion, yes.

13
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,480
Awesome! You must have been there 
several times then, haven't you?

14
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,190
Well...

15
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,130
Will you help?

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,990
I'd be so grateful.

17
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,480
Well then. Please give it some thought.

18
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,910
– See you.
– See you.

19
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,300
Turn her down, Minori.

20
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,820
None of our old classmates wound go to
Hawaii just for a post-reception party.

21
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,790
It'll just be Aiko's fellow cabin attendants 
and her fiance’s clients.

22
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,970
It doesn't matter.

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,210
Her fiancé is rich and
has big-name clients, right?

24
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,710
No one will pay any attention to us.

25
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,020
This party is just an excuse to let
his clients hook up with her colleagues.

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,980
Aiko just wants ordinary girls
like us there as hired help.

27
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,320
You don't know that.

28
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,540
I'm sure of it.

29
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,140
Okay.

30
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,320
If you accept the task,
she'll ask you for a written proposal.

31
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,710
A proposal?

32
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,020
Outlining the venue, the program as well as
details from concierge to cloak service.

33
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,470
"I get so confused if it's not all written down."

34
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,200
She'd say in that sweet voice of hers.

35
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,800
And after you've written it
all out like she said...

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,240
You've actually done this for her?

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,220
She would pick your work to pieces,
pointing out typo and grammar errors.

38
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,640
After you finally fixed all these errors,
she starts vetoing the contents.

39
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,590
I have a full-time job.

40
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,960
Why should I take so much crap
from her helping her out?

41
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,370
So Aiko's dad runs a very established restaurant frequented by politicians.

42
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,800
Since she moves in more rarefied circles than us commoners...

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,470
her go-between were always hugely popular.

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,380
Kayoko would suck up to her
in hopes of getting invited to one.

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,750
Then Aiko became a cabin attendant
and stopped answering Kayoko's calls.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,340
So Kayoko started badmouthing her.

47
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,620
Nevertheless, when Aiko suddenly asked her
to help with her post-reception party...

48
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,500
Kayoko was like "Anything for you."

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,370
Hilarious, isn't it?

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,280
Kayoko is a woman who spends
her downtime in beer bars.

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,430
How would she possibly know
anything about entertaining in Hawaii?

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,390
I guess so.

53
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,890
Although Aiko has her flaws,
she doesn't mean to be a pain in the neck.

54
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,640
She just can't help saying
"Maybe there's a better place."

55
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,610
She's a terror to work for.

56
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,070
Sure sounds that way.

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,400
Congratulations, Tajima!

58
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,700
For me? Thanks!

59
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,730
– Tajima, congratulations!

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,920
Congratulations...

61
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,430
Way to go, Tajima.

62
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,330
Congratulations...

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:11,850
Thank you.

64
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,160
Is it a boy or a girl?

65
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,460
– It's a boy.
– It's a boy!

66
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,130
– Congratulations.
– You are too kind.

67
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,560
Congratulations!

68
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,400
The manuscripts are ready.

69
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,900
"Work Your Brain and Raise Your Pay."

70
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,850
"Walking Tour of 300 Famous Eateries."

71
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,080
And "Live Longer by Laughing." 
Please go through them.

72
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,370
Efficient as ever.

73
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
Shall we do something on astrology next?

74
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,940
No.

75
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,280
Let's create a guide book to Hawaii.

76
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,760
We've already done a bunch of those.

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,160
I know.

78
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,400
"Hawaii Now!"

79
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,830
"My Personal Hawaii."

80
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,830
"Shopping in Hawaii."

81
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,200
"Hooray Hawaii."

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,210
"Feeling Hawaii."

83
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,250
"Hawaiian Ocean."

84
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,850
Enough. You're giving me a headache.

85
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,960
We published all these books
without making any trip to Hawaii.

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,750
Surprising, but clearly possible.

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,250
Hawaii is a hugely popular
travel destination now.

88
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,450
If we were to compile a guide to
the places only locals go...

89
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
it will definitely be a hit.

90
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,740
And to be safe, we can throw in
a guide for Hawaiian weddings.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,630
Weddings and local hangouts are totally 
unrelated. Rethink your strategy.

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,890
We can even include a top ten ranking
of Spam Musubi at the back.

93
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,670
I'm not convinced.

94
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,380
Boss.

95
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,460
I saw something the other day.

96
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,170
That's a pretty nice car you bought.

97
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,320
It's secondhand.

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,500
Every one else here
is struggling to pay their rent.

99
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,480
Owning a Porsche has always been my dream.

100
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,720
If word gets out...

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,520
everyone might start
clamoring for a pay rise.

102
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
– Aiko? I'll plan your party for you.
– Really?

103
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,760
I'd like to go there right away.

104
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,700
Can you get me a ticket?

105
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,000
– Right away.
– Thanks. That'd be great.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,560
– Bye.
– Bye.

107
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,760
I'm terribly sorry.

108
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,670
That's...

109
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,780
Aloha. Welcome to the Moana Surfrider.

110
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,880
Thank you.

111
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,070
I'd like another.

112
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,900
It goes down so easily, it's like juice.

113
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,680
{\pos(192,282)}Sure thing, ma'am.

114
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,720
You sure can drink.

115
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,360
Are you alone, miss?

116
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,480
She ignored me!

117
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,630
This is so typical of lonely women.

118
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,960
Thank you.

119
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,450
Imagine coming all this way
just to snub people.

120
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,390
It's always the lonely ones, I tell you.
It's written all over their faces.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,150
Hey, waiter. A crazy guy just came in.

122
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,740
Hey...!

123
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,110
You...

124
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,620
You there!

125
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,980
You're not a guest here, are you?

126
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,480
You look like a bum.
What are you doing here?

127
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,280
Hey!

128
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,830
What are you doing here?

129
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,500
Are you collecting bottles for money?
 I happen to have some money with me.

130
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,720
I'll buy some bottles from you.
How much are you charging?

131
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,780
Hey, mister. He's a friend of mine.

132
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,220
Is that right?

133
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,630
Are you hoping I'd be grateful or something?

134
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,540
Excuse me?

135
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,760
You wanted to feel good
helping a poor guy out?

136
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,360
What do you mean?

137
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,270
Well. I don't appreciate the gesture.

138
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,180
Even if you don't, there's no need to
highlight that fact, is there?

139
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,450
I just wanted to shut that annoying
old man up, that's all.

140
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,680
It worked, I feel better now.
We're not friend, you're free to go.

141
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,940
But if you plan to hang around,
stop flinging accusations...

142
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,870
and join me for a drink, 
so we can talk trash about him.

143
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,520
You're pretty all right, I guess.

144
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,350
I get that all the time.

145
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,540
Listen...

146
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,320
there's a full-moon party tonight
at Haleiwa Beach. Come if you'd like.

147
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,150
Sorry. Looks like
I've been invited to another party.

148
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,850
You can come anytime.
The party will last all night.

149
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,280
The chairman will be attending the party,
so dress appropriately, okay?

150
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,110
Okay.

151
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,200
Now, face each other.

152
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,390
Very nice. Stand a little closer.

153
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,240
Excuse me.

154
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,190
Let's try that again. Sorry.

155
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,160
Minori.

156
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,360
What's with the outfit?
You're really overdressed.

157
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,610
You told me to dress appropriately.

158
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,010
Allow me to introduce.

159
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,480
Akane...!

160
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,120
Go that way!

161
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,070
Get off the horse.

162
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,110
{\pos(192,283)}Meet up again.

163
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,800
I guess as much. Thanks.

164
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,130
You're welcome.

165
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,770
That's the Hawaii Polo Club chairman.
He said he'd teach me how to ride.

166
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,230
This is my friend. Yoshimura Akane.
She lives here.

167
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,510
She'll help you plan the post-reception party.

168
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,560
So you're the party planner.

169
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,530
The desire to serve others reflects 
mankind's most noble sentiment.

170
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm not in the habit of 
saying "Thanks" to dripping sarcasm.

171
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,670
Great. You'll get along just fine.

172
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,710
I'll leave the rest to you.

173
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,440
No... wait.

174
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,920
Shall we ditch the party?
It's the same old crowd.

175
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,580
You looked like you were 
having a ball though.

176
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,260
No, I was just making it fun for them.

177
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,290
But I haven't even met the groom yet.

178
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,760
Oh, he's hard at work
selling condominiums over there.

179
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,890
Better not bother him.

180
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,230
Are you new to this kind of parties?

181
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes.

182
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,990
Friends of Alan?

183
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,300
Amazing guy.

184
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,180
His products are sold in all big countries.

185
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,850
Alan?

186
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,480
The "horse."

187
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,390
He's the host.

188
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,970
This is his product.

189
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,850
Moisturizer that you wouldn't believe 
you can find them in the toilet.

190
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,210
But you're here to have fun, so bottoms up.

191
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,040
What is this?

192
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,780
Pineapple wine.

193
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,400
I'll pass.

194
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,040
Well...

195
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,530
before you speak, the president of
the winery is right over there.

196
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,080
– It's delicious!
– Thanks.

197
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,510
Hi.

198
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,100
{\pos(192,283)}I think the flavor satisfies Japanese taste.

199
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,690
{\pos(192,283)}Actually, she loves it.

200
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,300
{\pos(192,282)}Thank you very much.

201
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,050
That guy just used me to
talk to that president, didn't he?

202
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,160
He wore a suit to the party in Hawaii.

203
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,470
His kinds are like anteaters,
scavenging for money.

204
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,900
Don't you mean hyenas?

205
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,880
Let's hit a real party.

206
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,240
Is drink driving legal here?

207
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,560
I haven't had a drop.

208
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,280
So you aren't really drunk then?

209
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,420
You've got slam it shut really hard.

210
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,510
We'll drink at my place.

211
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,960
Stealing food from a party
is pretty cheap, don't you think?

212
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,900
Well, you took the champagne, didn't you?

213
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,560
Yes, but I wouldn't bring along
a Tupperware to such a function.

214
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,640
– Don't you find it embarrassing?
– Speak for yourself...

215
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,310
– Akane!
– I'll never bring a Tupperware.

216
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,720
Harassing the rich again?

217
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,160
Hey, Emi. Heading to work?

218
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,100
Yeah, but do you mind if I have some?

219
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,540
Sure.

220
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,040
This is Aiko's friend.

221
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:27,950
I'm Minori.

222
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,860
– I'm Emiko.
– And I'm Akane. Cheers.

223
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,670
Cheers!

224
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,650
Wearing Emi's clothes again?

225
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,740
– Hey Mako.
– She's a painter.

226
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,080
No sugar daddies today?

227
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,570
I knew everyone there.

228
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,280
Is there anyone you don't know?

229
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,670
Sorry to drag you from that party.

230
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,510
We'll go somewhere better.

231
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,900
There's a place called Loa Ridge.
That's where the rich men gather.

232
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,330
Just for the record,
I didn't come here to find a rich man.

233
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,010
So are you saying you'd rather
scrape by than be rich.

234
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,850
I'm saying I'm not looking
for a man in the first place.

235
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,710
You prefer women?
How do I say "Lesbian" in Japanese?

236
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,280
You're already speaking in Japanese.

237
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,420
We won't discriminate. It's fine.

238
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,930
Again for the record,
I am only attracted to men.

239
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,620
So Minori, what type of guys do you go for.

240
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,270
Well, let's see...

241
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,430
someone who'd tell me
when I've had enough to drink.

242
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,430
Of course, I wouldn't listen
and continue to drink.

243
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,240
He'll say, "Enough!" and take away my glass.

244
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,410
But I'll probably hide
some whiskey under my bed.

245
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,870
So you aspire to be an alcoholic?

246
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,800
Get serious if you want your life to work out.

247
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,990
Who asked you?

248
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,990
A Japanese guy won't cut it for me.

249
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,060
I want to stay here, so I need a green card.

250
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,700
When's your visa expiring, Akane?

251
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,790
In three months.

252
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,140
You've got to try harder
and hit the party more.

253
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,830
So you'll settle for any American?

254
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,450
No way. If I have to settle for
some low-income housing over here...

255
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,960
I'd rather go back to my hometown
in Akita and grow rice.

256
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,270
You're from Akita?

257
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,920
Akane!

258
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,760
Oh no. It's Honma.

259
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,870
He's Akane's stalker.

260
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,930
Are you so fond of rich men?
I've got clients from the polo club too.

261
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,970
Take it easy, Honma.

262
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,950
Honma sells insurance.

263
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,150
Do you know how I feel when I hear
my client talking about you.

264
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,950
Okay... I know it's hard.

265
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,320
I know I'm way too old for you...

266
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,110
but I can't control my feelings for you!

267
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,650
You need to find a way to.

268
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,940
Listen, Honma.

269
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,040
If you really love this girl...

270
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,870
you've got to be willing
to help her find her Mr. Right.

271
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,230
Now that's true love.

272
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,660
Who's this chick?

273
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,100
That's right, Honma.

274
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,470
You've got access to lots of
private information at your firm.

275
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,330
Can't you just divulge some?

276
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,390
I'll get fired for that.

277
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,290
Akane, have you got any idea
what people say about you?

278
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,510
What do they say?
Are they calling me a Japanese idol?

279
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,230
They say you're a desperate picnic ant!

280
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,810
They are going to start turning you away.

281
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,280
That's not very nice.

282
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,620
So stop this silly daydreaming 
and marry me.

283
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,390
Okay? Will you please marry me?

284
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,200
Will you?

285
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,340
No!

286
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,940
That's wrong.

287
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,200
Guys who take advantage of women
when they are down are the worst.

288
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,940
Jerks who resort to
such manipulative tricks...

289
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,030
are either the sort who borrow small change
without intending to pay it back...

290
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,740
or the sort who makes things difficult for
the staff at convenience stores.

291
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,150
Which type are you? 
Or are you both?

292
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,450
Who the heck are you?

293
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,760
Go home.

294
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,940
Here...

295
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,440
bottoms up.

296
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,700
Good morning, Mako.

297
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,570
Good morning

298
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,110
Here.

299
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,760
This is from Akane.

300
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,280
Thanks.

301
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,880
Yes.

302
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,270
"Morning shift. Join me for lunch.
Bring the key and come before noon."

303
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,270
Would you like to try on this color?
Here you go...

304
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,720
You look amazing!
These colors are so slimming.

305
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:06,170
It fits you so well that
it seems tailor-made for you.

306
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,040
I almost hate to charge you for it,
but that would be twenty dollars.

307
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:11,710
Oh!

308
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,680
Such energy.

309
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,750
Are you hungry?

310
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,050
Wow! this looks delicious.

311
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,860
This is really awesome.

312
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,580
What do you think?

313
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,650
It's fantastic.

314
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,720
What did I tell you?

315
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,660
Hold on.

316
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,910
Okay.

317
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,700
Don't tell me you tweet about your food?

318
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,870
I have to write a Hawaii travel guide.

319
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,230
Can you show me more places like this
where the local hang out?

320
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,060
Is that why you are here?

321
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,740
To be perfectly honest...

322
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,530
I'm using company money and
Aiko's connections...

323
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,850
to have fun in Hawaii.

324
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,150
My company is covering all my expenses.

325
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,190
I can pay you to be my local
coordinator. Are you in?

326
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,120
I'm in.

327
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,860
Here we are.

328
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,430
– Here?
– This is the place.

329
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,150
– It's lovely!
– Right?

330
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,930
Here we are.

331
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,900
Wait. I want a photo.

332
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,750
– Should I pose like this?
– Shift a little to that side.

333
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,770
Okay.

334
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,010
Why did we park so far away?

335
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,640
I can't help it, there weren't any
parking space available.

336
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:54,230
So how do you attract a white guy?
Do you serve him food or something?

337
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,910
That won't cut it.

338
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,230
Americans like strong women.

339
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,700
Watch and learn.

340
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,730
{\pos(192,282)}I think you're good at arm wrestling...

341
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,490
{\pos(192,284)}but you can't beat me with muscles like these.

342
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,920
{\pos(192,236)}I won't challenge you because 
I don't want to embarrass you.

343
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,380
{\pos(192,282)}You should stay outside, sweetie.

344
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,980
He didn't want to deal with you.

345
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,280
I'm going back in.

346
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,050
{\pos(192,282)}I think you're good at arm wrestling...

347
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,600
{\pos(192,284)}but you can't beat me with muscles like these.

348
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,620
It looks like you're having fun.

349
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,160
Oh!

350
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,040
Want a drink.

351
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,220
Am I supposed to talk this up too?

352
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,550
There isn't anybody to impress today.

353
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,580
May I?

354
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,480
Be my guest.

355
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,940
So did the boss of that pineapple winery
agree to make an investment?

356
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,400
Thanks to you, he agree to
peruse my business plan.

357
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,010
I'm thinking of inviting him to my shop.

358
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,550
Your shop?

359
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,790
Well, a restaurant.

360
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,870
Would you like to come over?

361
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,140
I could use with another's opinion.
Food's on the house.

362
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,580
Well...

363
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,510
but what about my friend?

364
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,940
Should we help her?

365
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,130
She'll be fine.

366
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,100
You have any liquor there?

367
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,240
Just name it.

368
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,890
Thanks.

369
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,810
Thank you.

370
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,280
This is it.

371
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,190
I want to launch my shop in the mainland.

372
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,310
Hawaii is just my testing ground.

373
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,970
"Japanese Tea Rice"?

374
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,260
It's an Ochazuke restaurant.

375
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,890
Coming Through.

376
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,710
What do you think?

377
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,300
– It's quite ordinary.
– That's the point.

378
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,650
Perhaps you should add
more variety to your menu?

379
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,480
No, that's won't work. My plan is
to launch my stores across the country.

380
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,420
The States is teeming with
Japanese restaurant as it is.

381
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,270
I need to set my brand apart from
the others. It's tougher on the mainland.

382
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,380
I see.

383
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,110
Why the States? Why not Europe?

384
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,990
No, I want it to be in America.

385
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,920
Russia's cold. This will go over well.

386
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,800
No way.

387
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,900
So it's either the States or nothing?

388
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,710
I wouldn't say that.

389
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,530
– What about Thailand?
– That's out of the question.

390
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,540
{\pos(192,236)}Smashed presidents' faces,
smashed pumpkins for Halloween.

391
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,490
{\pos(192,252)}Designs, you know, I think
there were like twenty kinds or so.

392
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,680
{\pos(192,252)}Drugs are an easy audience,
so we sold a lot to bars.

393
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,310
{\pos(192,283)}You are the head of a coaster company then.

394
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,160
{\pos(192,236)}Not only coasters, 
but we also made place mats.

395
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,090
Okay.

396
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,370
{\pos(192,284)}After trying to make several designs,

397
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,410
{\pos(192,234)}our company was sold
to a larger kitchenware company.

398
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,850
{\pos(192,252)}So now, I'm just investing the money
we made from there.

399
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,950
{\pos(192,283)}You're living on dividends.

400
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,710
{\pos(192,235)}I'd very much like to hear any good
financial advice you might have for me.

401
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,770
{\pos(192,283)}How about investment trust?

402
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,880
{\pos(192,283)}How about talking at my place?

403
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,670
{\pos(192,282)}Or exchange-traded funds?

404
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,840
Come on,

405
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,200
{\pos(192,283)}let's go.

406
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:00,710
{\pos(192,236)}Listen, I'm living with a couple of girls
that I'm dating right now, but...

407
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,950
{\pos(192,283)}I don't think you'd mind, do you?

408
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,840
"Dating"?

409
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,330
To put it simply, it's a trial period.

410
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,670
He has several girls from among which
he'll choose on to be his girlfriend.

411
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,950
So he can officially sleep
with several girls at the sane time.

412
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,140
But I've never heard of anyone
living with all his dates.

413
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,010
Sound efficient.

414
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,460
It's a joke.

415
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,930
So what happened?

416
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,730
I'm not living in a harem.

417
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,400
I see.

418
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,930
What about you, Minori?
You left with a Japanese businessman.

419
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,210
Nothing happened.

420
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,300
We had Ochazuke and Japanese wine.

421
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,500
You're in Hawaii, you know.

422
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,600
Then I went over to his place...

423
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,740
You went to his place?

424
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,970
Well...

425
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,040
sort of.

426
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,920
Is this a warehouse?

427
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,050
Yes, I rented it as a warehouse,
but it doubles as my house now.

428
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,800
Disappointed?

429
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,820
Not really.

430
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,720
I wear an expensive suit just to
look presentable for business dealings.

431
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,000
But actually, I'm struggling financially.

432
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,640
I've had my share of setbacks.

433
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,820
When I first took the plunge into
business, I sold toe socks.

434
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,500
They rakes in enough profits
to fund my next venture.

435
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,440
That's dry cleaning service.

436
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,810
But that was a disaster.

437
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,680
So next, I tried selling Konjac diet foods.

438
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,000
That did all right.

439
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,430
After that, it was charcoal-infused shampoo.

440
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,890
I guess the advertising didn't work.

441
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,950
It was a major flop.

442
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,040
I made a comeback
with those green tea cookies.

443
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,270
That did pretty well until sales flattened out.

444
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,640
I used the profit to start 
my current restaurant.

445
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,050
Don't you think you're being
way too adventurous?

446
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,120
That's what I need. I don't want
to lose the entrepreneurial spirit.

447
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,430
Perhaps you should take
into consideration local tastes.

448
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,220
No, that won't work.
The cookie business taught me a lesson.

449
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,230
To be well received in the States,
you need a unique Japanese touch.

450
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,480
For example, the Japanese dedication
to meticulous service.

451
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,530
Or an "oriental" vibe.

452
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,220
All these may seem normal to us,
but they really make an impact overseas.

453
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,480
It's hard to see that in Japan.

454
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,140
Want a drink?

455
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,530
And you left?

456
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,200
That guy did not impress me.

457
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,730
What's wrong with that?

458
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:01,270
Back in Japan, my boss kept telling me
to publish anything that would sell.

459
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,410
Travel guides, diet cookbooks,
pelvis correction exercise manuals...

460
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:09,750
B-list restaurant guides,
shocking apocalyptic prophecies...

461
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,030
lymphatic massage for a slimmer face 
and guides to the best spas in town.

462
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,240
That is...

463
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,730
I saw myself in him. It irked me.

464
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,670
Do you understand what I'm saying?

465
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,040
So you prefer a man who doesn’t work?

466
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,730
No, a man should at least work
to support his loved ones.

467
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,380
I see. So love begets money?

468
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:39,280
Even if he's rich, he still needs to work
to maintain his fortune, right?

469
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,850
That's not true.
It's not about how hard you work.

470
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,160
The reality is that the rich get richer
and the poor remain poor, Minori.

471
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,970
That's warped logic.
There's more to life than that.

472
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,350
Emi got married in a hurry
to secure a green card...

473
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,750
only to get abused and now,
she's divorced.

474
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,840
You have to choose wisely, you know?

475
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:01,700
I don't want a green card and
I'm not in a hurry to get married.

476
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,540
So you're all right with staying single?

477
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,840
I can't marry the guy I'm dating anyway.

478
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,320
You're seeing someone?
Why can't you marry him?

479
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,620
– You mean he's already married?
– Drop it already.

480
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,970
There's nothing worse than cheating.

481
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,260
Okay, I'm so sorry.

482
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,820
I'm only saying this in your best
interest. You better listen up.

483
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,020
I hear you, Sis.

484
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,550
But I don’t need you
pointing out all my faults.

485
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:39,630
I'm not looking to settle down
and I don't intend to marry for money.

486
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,400
Neither do I. But you've got to
start looking somewhere, don't you?

487
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,630
I'm just starting with the rich.

488
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,720
Why the rich?

489
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,020
Minori, you think all rich people
are jerks, don't you?

490
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,410
That's discrimination.

491
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:55,180
Yeah. While you don't discriminate,
you'll sleep with anyone.

492
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,810
What's that supposed to mean?

493
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:00,230
You're the one crashing parties
to mount rich tycoons.

494
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,480
That was just innocent fun.

495
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,730
What about Honma?

496
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,050
I did sleep with Honma.

497
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,100
See? You did.

498
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,140
Who else?

499
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,910
Nobody.

500
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,240
What?

501
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,280
I've only slept with Honma.

502
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,510
In fact, he's my first.

503
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,300
That's why he's always on my back.
I think he feels responsible.

504
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,610
Eh?

505
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,130
Why are you so surprised?
What kind of person did you think I was?

506
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,700
Well... I mean...

507
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,090
What about all those men?

508
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,720
I didn't sleep with any of them!

509
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,460
I don't have affairs with married men or
go to their place on the first date!

510
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,930
"Boss, here are the pictures taken
in Hawaii. Fieldwork is progressing well."

511
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,030
"But please send me more money...

512
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,130
"as I'm running low on funds
Regards Minori."

513
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,650
"Minori, I hope you're enjoying
your trip in Hawaii."

514
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,450
"We need to talk after you get back.
Regards, Tajima."

515
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,180
Hello?

516
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,560
How's everything? Found a good spot
for the post-reception party?

517
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,290
That's...

518
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,290
I'm spoilt for choice.

519
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,260
I'm thinking out on the sea...

520
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,980
or maybe on a rooftop.

521
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,190
Or how about a garden party?
Like in Kailua.

522
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,440
That's a great idea.
I'm sure Satoshi will love it.

523
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,130
Let's get together to discuss it.

524
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,690
Welcome.

525
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,450
This way, please.

526
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,090
Are you alone today?

527
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:54,610
I've been thinking about
what your friend said the other day.

528
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,700
If I really care about you...

529
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,640
I should find someone suitable for you.

530
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,710
That's what true love is about.

531
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,500
Have you been drinking?

532
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,290
I'm not drunk.

533
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:22,470
I've chosen a few clients of mine
who might be suitable for you.

534
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,750
Please don't show this to anyone.

535
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,860
I'll be fired if I get found out.

536
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,720
You didn't have to do this.

537
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,420
If things don't go well with
any of these men...

538
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,760
I hope you'll choose me.

539
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,300
There's going to be an Epicurean Club party
tomorrow afternoon at Loa Ridge.

540
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,180
Let's go together.

541
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,240
Regarding your garden party idea...

542
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:20,760
Yes.

543
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,280
I think it's great.

544
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,310
You do?

545
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,270
But I'm concerned about bathroom
facilities for female guests.

546
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:32,170
You see, my friends and clients
tend to attract women wherever they go.

547
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,080
Hey, Tsutomu.

548
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,170
I heard you're going to 
Loa Ridge today. May I tag along?

549
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,000
I don't think so.

550
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,110
The pineapple wine venture fell through.

551
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,890
But a guy I met at Alan's party
showed interest in Japanese food.

552
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,710
I would like to meet him again.
Please do me a favor.

553
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,870
All right then.

554
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:02,860
Why don't you join us, Minori?
It's a party at Loa Ridge.

555
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:05,990
Sure.

556
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,450
Shall we?

557
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,830
Thank you.

558
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,060
I see you prefer successful guys.

559
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:28,970
What?

560
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,170
– This house looks really nice.
– Wait...

561
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,560
Come here...

562
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,320
The event is still going on.

563
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,620
Isn't that why we are here?

564
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:08,030
No, we have to wait for it to end...

565
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,630
before we join the cocktail party.

566
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,660
So we're commoners after all.

567
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,840
Being here is a big deal in itself.

568
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,410
Here, as in hanging around the periphery?

569
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,160
Go home if you hate it so much.

570
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,150
Why are you dressed like that?

571
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,900
This is my strategy.

572
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,410
She works for me.

573
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,280
What's going on?

574
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,530
So, Minori.
Finally interested in the rich?

575
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,090
I'm just here for the drinks.

576
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,040
I'll see how it's going inside.

577
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,420
I wonder when they will
start throwing us table scraps?

578
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,120
This is serious. Shut up.

579
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,500
Get off your high horse.

580
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,880
You're just waiting to pounce on change
that falls from their pockets.

581
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,350
You don't understand because you've never
put your best foot forward, Minori.

582
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,740
I'm sorry, but what are you trying to say?

583
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:57,700
You've never taken anything seriously
enough to understand our feelings.

584
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,290
Are you talking about yourself?

585
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,730
A person looking to marry rich
for a good life shouldn't talk.

586
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,890
If you want money, why don't you
just get a job? Seriously.

587
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,080
Okay. I think we're good.

588
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,220
Let's go.

589
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:24,000
It's better to look plain than tacky.

590
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,320
If you can't marry a rich man,
you can always be his mistress.

591
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,070
Is that a joke?

592
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:59,990
{\pos(192,235)}I think your son will be so thrilled to have 
a yacht for his junior high school graduation.

593
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,830
{\pos(192,283)}Oh, that is fantastic.

594
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,650
{\pos(192,236)}You know now the Japanese food
is widely accepted in the States?

595
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,630
{\pos(192,236)}And my restaurant
is specialized in tea rice.

596
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,660
Thank you.

597
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:22,400
Hi.

598
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,060
{\pos(192,285)}We met at Alan’s party the other day.

599
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,820
{\pos(192,284)}I’m running a Japanese restaurant.

600
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:30,860
{\pos(192,236)}You know now the Japanese food
is widely accepted in the States?

601
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,050
{\pos(192,283)}And my restaurant is specialized in tea...

602
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:37,260
Thank you.

603
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,550
Do I act like a professional?

604
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,280
No, be the flustered rookie.
Maybe you'll win their sympathy.

605
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,440
In that case, shall I rip my sleeve as well?

606
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,520
Those people love doing charity work.

607
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:57,960
{\pos(192,283)}Hon!

608
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,590
Listen, don't forget to take my advice.

609
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:05,730
Hey!

610
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,890
{\pos(192,283)}Hey, Hon.

611
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,120
{\pos(192,283)}How's the night fishing the last time?

612
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,280
{\pos(192,283)}No good.

613
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,330
{\pos(192,236)}You're still the record holder.

614
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:13,560
Of course.

615
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:16,300
{\pos(192,236)}Hon and I train hard against 
each other in trawling.

616
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,190
{\pos(192,283)}He's really good at it.

617
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,520
{\pos(192,282)}May I introduce my new assistant, Akane?

618
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,580
I feel so c-c-c-cold.

619
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,350
{\pos(192,283)}You need something to put on?

620
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,080
Yes.

621
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,470
Don't you have a bigger glass?

622
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,720
Hi, nice to meet you.

623
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,210
{\pos(192,236)}Can I show you my business?

624
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:40,630
Thank you.

625
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,580
Finding this funny?

626
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,560
No, it's boring actually.

627
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,470
The world sure is run in a tedious way.

628
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,490
Go ahead and sneer.

629
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,440
That boring shop of yours
is never going to make it big.

630
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,810
No, I'm sure it will be a hit.

631
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,880
Japanese food is all the rage on the mainland.

632
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,220
And yet you branded
your product as "tea rice"?

633
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:35,350
If you're promoting Japanese cuisine,
you should call it "Ochazuke."

634
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,360
That would be setting the bar too high.

635
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,870
What a lame excuse.

636
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,360
Everyone calls "Sushi" by its name today.

637
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:52,730
You're never going to strike big
with and attitude like that.

638
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:59,780
Are you content to play second fiddle
or trendsetter all the time...

639
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,010
and earning enough just to survive.

640
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,590
What are you talking about?

641
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,090
What I mean is...

642
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,780
you should follow your heart.

643
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:23,100
People can tell when you're half-hearted
about your own business. You fool!

644
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,780
Go home.

645
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,730
– Don't tell me what to do.
– Come on.

646
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,430
– Let's go.
– Let's go of me!

647
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,700
Ouch, that hurts.

648
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,090
If you really believe in what you're doing...

649
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,470
you'll continue selling your product,
even if it's from the side of a truck.

650
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,360
Listen.

651
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,100
Instead of poking your nose into my business...

652
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,790
you should worry about yourself.

653
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,020
{\pos(192,283)}Ladies and gentlemen.

654
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,710
{\pos(192,283)}Let me introduce our new friend.

655
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,680
{\pos(192,283)}Hello.

656
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,510
{\pos(192,283)}My name is Tomoya Abe.

657
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,860
{\pos(192,236)}Nice to see all of you.

658
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,290
{\pos(192,283)}I'm the grandson of Kiotaka Abe.

659
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:04,390
{\pos(192,236)}I grew up in Japan,
but when I was very young...

660
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,310
{\pos(192,236)}I spent long vacations
here in my grandfather's house.

661
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,540
{\pos(192,235)}My grandfather has already passed away...

662
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,890
{\pos(192,235)}but those moments are
very precious memories to me.

663
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:30,650
{\pos(192,236)}I'm sure that all of you have
unforgettable memories as well.

664
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,180
{\pos(192,284)}So I'm not disappoint you.

665
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:36,470
{\pos(192,284)}And, will honor your traditions...

666
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,420
{\pos(192,236)}and I will rise to your expectations...

667
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,040
{\pos(192,236)}now that I'm accepted
as one of your members.

668
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:46,640
I know you!

669
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,450
Oyamada, where's your draft?

670
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,670
Sorry, It's almost done.

671
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,650
We'll publish a book on pelvis correction exercise.

672
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,060
Yes, Boss.

673
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:33,400
What should we do about the binding?

674
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,730
I'm so sorry, Miss Oyamada.

675
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,890
Could you do these too?

676
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,800
Is the book on Jumbo Meals done?

677
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,870
What about the facial slimming?

678
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,670
The World's Ending in 2012 in a hurry!

679
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:48,230
Yes.

680
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,380
I know. I'm so sorry.

681
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,030
I'll contact them immediately. I'm so sorry.

682
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:09,650
Well...

683
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,360
let's call it a night.

684
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,160
No way!

685
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:20,160
You think by getting drunk,
we can just forget everything by tomorrow?

686
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,250
No, I don't. 
But we're going in circles.

687
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:29,370
– Why doesn't anybody understand?
– I understand. I really do.

688
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:33,200
I work the hardest in the company.

689
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,810
Yes, you do.

690
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,810
Don't you think it's ridiculous
that I don't get a pay rise?

691
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,480
It's ridiculous.

692
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,360
I can't believe it.

693
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,700
I'll resign tomorrow.

694
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,540
Now, hold on a second.

695
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,470
I'll do something about the money.

696
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,550
I'll talk to accounting
or just claim more expenses.

697
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,660
It's not about nickels and dimes.

698
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,330
Yes...

699
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:56,510
I'm asking, is this all I'm worth to them?

700
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,250
But you know, Minori...

701
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,850
without you, the company would fall apart.

702
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,430
The company would go bust immediately.

703
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,450
I mean it.

704
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,860
Do you really think so?

705
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,540
Of course! That's obvious.

706
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:24,210
That's... those ungrateful brats...

707
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,360
– Well said, Tajima.
– No...

708
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,720
Please give me a break.
I can't drink anymore.

709
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,920
Wait... wait a minute.

710
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,640
Stop drinking. 
That's enough for this night.

711
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,760
Oh, man.

712
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,200
That sucks.

713
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,520
It sure does for me.

714
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,390
Hold on... that hurts.

715
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:50,510
What do you want?

716
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,110
– I don't know.
– Why...

717
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:55,370
No... stop. That's enough.

718
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,510
I'll take that.

719
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,750
Are we done here?

720
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,970
You were pretty smashed.

721
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,420
Who are you?

722
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,920
To put it simply, my family owns
a bunch of natural gas plants...

723
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,000
as well as chemical and oil companies.

724
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,190
In other words, you're very rich.

725
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,900
Akane would be delighted.

726
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,410
The gold diggers are always after me.

727
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,130
Is that why you collect bottles
and make palm syrup.

728
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,290
What a luxury that is.

729
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,180
Are you a modern-day Robin Hood?

730
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:34,400
I should be thinking about the business,
but I lack my father's talent.

731
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:36,830
Is that so?

732
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,250
What do I know?

733
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,650
And, why do you drink so much?

734
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,000
Well... it's my hobby.

735
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:50,980
Like you collecting bottles.

736
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,310
You don't want to talk about it?

737
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,310
Is it a guy?

738
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:05,890
Correct?

739
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,170
I think it's a boy.

740
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,340
Or was it a girl already?

741
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,930
Hell. I'll just tell you.

742
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,770
A lot of stuff happened at work,
and I was really down.

743
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,180
So I slept with a junior co-worker.

744
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:50,410
But he's married.

745
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:55,280
Since we're colleagues,

746
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,960
I still have to see him everyday.

747
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,350
And...

748
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,380
I started bringing him home
with me after drinks.

749
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:10,000
This went on for about four months.

750
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,000
And then...

751
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,810
I found out his wife was pregnant.

752
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,270
It's really messed up.

753
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,570
That's why you came to Hawaii?

754
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,220
I don't know what I'm doing.

755
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,980
I really ought to think it through.

756
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,580
What is it?

757
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,590
Nothing.

758
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,050
When I first met you...

759
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,650
at the hotel the other day,

760
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,250
you tried to help me, didn't  you?

761
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,140
Not that you needed any help.

762
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:41,700
Still...

763
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,760
I think that you helped me a lot 
even when you're already feeling down.

764
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,550
Oh, stop.

765
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,120
Is it really okay for me to join you?

766
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:24,820
Yeah. It's like a celebration.

767
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:48,790
(Hawaiian language)

768
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,040
{\pos(192,284)}Auntie, I'd like to introduce Minori.

769
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,050
Nice to meet you.

770
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,330
(Hawaiian language)

771
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,370
She says you're as pretty as a flower.

772
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,840
Thank you.

773
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,240
(Hawaiian language)

774
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:27,130
It's her husband who passed away.

775
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:32,070
I just saw him surfing the other day.

776
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:53,800
(Hawaiian language)

777
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,420
Let's go.

778
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,300
Loa Ridge was a disaster,
but today will be different.

779
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,790
Our target today is...

780
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,800
to jog along this course.

781
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,490
When he comes, run alongside him.

782
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,490
Make conversation so that
he'll remember you...

783
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:44,290
then we see him again
at the party this weekend.

784
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,370
What do you think?

785
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,320
That's a good plan...

786
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:48,790
right?

787
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:54,330
It's okay, Honma.

788
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:55,050
No.

789
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:59,260
We only have three 
potential candidates left.

790
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,420
It's enough.

791
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,260
No.

792
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,310
I got it.

793
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:03,230
No, you don't.

794
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:06,470
You still don't get how I care for you.

795
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,550
Yes, I do.

796
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:08,850
No, you don't.

797
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:11,120
Do you have any idea
how valuable this information is?

798
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,890
I said, that's enough!

799
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,910
I've made up my mind
the moment you showed me this.

800
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:19,810
You've made up your mind?

801
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:29,120
I've made up my mind to marry you.

802
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,290
Akane... no!

803
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:40,720
You don't have to shout.
I can hear you fine.

804
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,050
You should find a man
who will give you happiness!

805
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:44,820
That's why I've chosen you!

806
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:54,190
I only played along since 
you went to the trouble to do this.

807
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,610
So it's enough.

808
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,500
A-A-Akane!

809
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,410
That's why I don't need this anymore.

810
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,780
My papers!

811
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,200
Oh well.

812
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,700
Akane.

813
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,390
You're dating that rich guy from
Loa Ridge? Are you crazy?

814
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:01,460
Who are you calling crazy?

815
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,250
I can just hear Emi now.

816
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:07,680
"Minori's boyfriend is a Loa Ridge guy
while you've settled for Honma."

817
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,580
– You're dating Honma?
– Never mind that.

818
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,700
Why...?

819
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,330
Forget about Honma.

820
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:16,200
Are you going to be living at Loa Ridge?

821
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,120
Akane!

822
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,880
Our table's over here.

823
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,560
Yes, I can see that.

824
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,340
You know what? Honma's kind of cute.

825
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,020
Don't make fun of my boyfriend.

826
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,520
Can you not be paranoid?

827
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,440
Akane!

828
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,880
Shall I place the order for you?

829
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,680
Yeah, by all means.

830
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,130
So come on, tell me.

831
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,140
Akane...!

832
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:35,340
What is it now?

833
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:38,100
– There's no Caesar salad.
– Any salad will do.

834
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,060
Hey, they've got mushroom salad.

835
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,760
That's great. Get that.

836
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,920
– So...
– What?

837
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,730
you agree a rich guy is still the best?

838
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:50,260
Akane, you think all rich people
are jerks, don't you?

839
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,570
That's discrimination.

840
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:57,680
You've finally awoken to love.

841
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,200
Will love really beget money?

842
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,550
That was what you said.

843
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:02,770
Forget what I said.

844
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:06,190
How did you hook up with him?
Can you tell me?

845
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:08,300
It's nothing worth mentioning.

846
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,490
Don't be coy.

847
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:13,780
You told him your sob story about dating
a married man and he consoled you?

848
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,930
Well...

849
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:19,460
That's pretty close to the mark.

850
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:22,800
That goes against what you told Honma.
Remember what you said?

851
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,820
Guy who take advantage of women
when they are down are the worst.

852
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,590
Jerks who resort to 
such manipulative tricks...

853
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:27,940
are either the sort who borrow small change
without intending to pay it back...

854
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:29,770
or the sort who makes things difficult for
the staff at convenience stores.

855
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:31,570
Which type are you? 
Or are you both?

856
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,530
Wow, you've got a good memory.

857
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:35,480
That's because I intend to marry him.

858
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,200
Really? Congratulations!

859
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,700
Like I said, this is not about me.

860
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,560
Everything all right?

861
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,230
They are getting married!

862
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:42,850
What?

863
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:50,110
Congratulations.

864
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,570
That's wonderful.

865
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:55,990
Now comes the hard part.

866
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,310
Forget about Honma.

867
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,040
What is it?

868
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,650
Akane...

869
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,190
You've got something 
precious going on there.

870
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,690
So stop talking about me already!

871
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,490
You're so annoying!

872
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:43,430
{\pos(192,236)}Hey, whatever happened
to the pipeline in Azerbaijan?

873
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,780
{\pos(192,283)}Since that conflict in Georgia,

874
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,510
{\pos(192,252)}we had to abandon the project
right, Tomoya?

875
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:50,600
Yeah.

876
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,160
{\pos(192,283)}It seems.

877
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:54,270
{\pos(192,283)}It seems?

878
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,980
{\pos(192,283)}Why aren't you more cooperative?

879
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:04,810
He wants me to be more serious.

880
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,090
{\pos(192,283)}Tomoya.

881
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,320
{\pos(192,283)}Do whatever you like.

882
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,970
How is it going with the guide book?

883
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:14,830
Hey.

884
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,190
– Tajima.
– Yes.

885
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,660
Has she called you?

886
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:18,760
No.

887
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,690
She contacted you though.

888
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,410
She checked out of her hotel
and I can't reach her on her phone.

889
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,250
She should be there for two weeks,
but it's been twenty days.

890
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:31,870
You don't suppose
she will stay for good, do you?

891
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,320
She's on a tourist visa, though.

892
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,950
How long is her visa valid for?

893
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,000
I believe it's three months.

894
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,620
We can't wait that long.

895
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:43,860
– Tajima.
– Yes.

896
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,250
Go to Hawaii and find her.

897
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:48,970
Eh?

898
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,860
Saki...?

899
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,130
Look. According to this,

900
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:08,720
they will let you fly a Cessna.

901
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,510
A Cessna?  Really?

902
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:12,760
Is that awesome or what?

903
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:17,490
– That rocks...! 
– A Cessna, no less!

904
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:19,300
– Awesome!

905
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,520
Yes..!

906
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,820
– I know! We'll be pilots.
– Awesome!

907
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:23,300
Wait.

908
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:23,860
Excuse me.

909
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:27,170
– Look at this.
– What? We can play with dolphins.

910
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:29,440
Really? Dolphins are so cute!

911
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,260
Pardon me. Excuse me.

912
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,680
– Dolphins are the cutest!
– This is so exciting!

913
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,100
Really want to go to Hawaii!

914
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:39,330
You've got to take the night cruise.
That's where I met my ex.

915
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:41,060
– Really?
– Sure.

916
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,620
– You want to meet guys, don't you?
– Excuse me.

917
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,510
Yes, I do.

918
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:49,260
I swear to God this will change your life.

919
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,690
All right! This is so exciting!

920
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:53,360
So exciting!

921
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,090
Excuse me. Please excuse me.

922
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,570
It's going to be great.

923
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,330
There's an amazing place...

924
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:03,410
just beyond the next mountain.

925
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,620
I found it with Ryan.

926
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:10,720
There's a hidden river deep in the jungle.

927
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:13,840
You'll be amazed when you see it.

928
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,000
It will blow you away.

929
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:31,690
What are you doing?

930
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,670
See for yourself.

931
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,690
I'll be parking the truck ahead.
Come and have some.

932
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,110
Your friend?

933
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:58,700
What?

934
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:01,110
Oh... yes.

935
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:13,550
All right.

936
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:16,490
{\pos(192,252)}I take one large
Lomi Lomi Chazuke...

937
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:16,990
Lomi Lomi. Okay

938
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,540
{\pos(192,283)}and one large Salmon Chazuke.

939
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:23,180
{\pos(192,283)}I have a medium Poke Dashi Chazuke...

940
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,710
{\pos(192,283)}and one medium Ume Chazuke.

941
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:27,070
{\pos(192,283)}Just a moment, please.

942
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:28,630
What's up, Tomoya?
How are you doing?

943
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:30,460
{\pos(192,283)}Here you are.

944
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,590
– Thanks.
– Thank you.

945
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,090
Pick anything you like.

946
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:58,840
{\pos(192,284)}Thank you. Please come again.

947
01:17:58,860 --> 01:17:59,360
Thanks.

948
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,130
What do you think?

949
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:11,840
It's delicious!

950
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,750
It goes great with Hawaiian food.

951
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:20,300
I infused Japanese flavors
into local cuisine.

952
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:23,980
This way, the locals can get
a taste of Japanese food...

953
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:27,780
and the Japanese can also 
draw closer to Hawaiians.

954
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:28,730
It feels like...

955
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,440
I'm erasing borders.

956
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:34,850
It sounds interesting.

957
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,300
Do you always set up shop here?

958
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,160
No.

959
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:48,020
I go downtown in the mornings,
and come here in the evenings.

960
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:52,280
At night, I target the tourists
in Waikiki after they hit the pubs.

961
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,620
Sounds busy.

962
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:04,760
Well, you told me to sell my products from 
a truck if my store didn't work out.

963
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:20,450
Are you going out with him?

964
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,650
Yeah... you can say that.

965
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,930
He's from a rich family, right?

966
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:33,310
Apparently.

967
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,240
Good for you.

968
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:54,640
{\pos(192,282)}Excuse me!

969
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:58,040
A commoner's got to work.

970
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:01,680
I'm better off working anyway.
It's a lot of fun.

971
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,780
Did it sound like sour grapes?

972
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,450
No, I know what you mean.

973
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:11,260
I'm a commoner too.

974
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,930
{\pos(192,283)}Give me one large Poke Chazuke.

975
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,820
{\pos(192,283)}Hi! I come over.

976
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:20,500
See you then.

977
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,250
Are you off to work?

978
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,590
I have to get approval for merger plans.

979
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,170
I don't know much about
the workings of the company...

980
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,600
but I'm a board member after all.

981
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,290
Aren't you a hard worker then.

982
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,710
All I do is nod.

983
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,860
Where shall we meet for dinner?

984
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:54,130
Sorry, I promised to meet Aiko tonight.
I'll call you when I'm done.

985
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,300
– Sorry.
– Thank you.

986
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,030
Excuse me,

987
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,360
{\pos(192,283)}have you seen this lady?

988
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:20,900
No.

989
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:24,390
Excuse me,

990
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,590
{\pos(192,283)}have you seen this lady?

991
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,300
No...?

992
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,180
Are you close to Mr. Abe's son?

993
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:31,160
Yes... just recently.

994
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,850
I guess word travels.

995
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:38,370
The four of us should 
get together sometime.

996
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:39,950
Good idea!

997
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:44,570
My friend's having a gallery opening.
Do come with him.

998
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:49,950
Have you heard when the next
Epicurean Club party will be held?

999
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:51,740
No, I haven't.

1000
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,390
I need to use the washroom.

1001
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:08,580
{\pos(192,236)}I set up a mobile Ochazuke 
food truck in the parking lots...

1002
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:11,780
{\pos(192,285)}so that I can sell at different locations.

1003
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,490
{\pos(192,283)}I like the mobility idea. That's smart.

1004
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:20,780
{\pos(192,236)}I'm a little unsure about the menu,
mixing local dishes with Ochazuke.

1005
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:22,190
{\pos(192,283)}Do you think that would work?

1006
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:28,790
{\pos(192,236)}Well, I'm already selling Poke Chazuke
and Spam Chazuke.

1007
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,420
{\pos(192,284)}They're quite popular.

1008
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,680
{\pos(192,283)}I see. Okay.

1009
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,730
{\pos(192,283)}Well...

1010
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:42,290
{\pos(192,283)}aren't you Mr Abe's...?

1011
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:49,030
{\pos(192,285)}I am like Ohana(family) to Mr Abe.

1012
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:57,720
{\pos(192,284)}Mr Kamada?

1013
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:02,480
{\pos(192,236)}Tomoya wants to order 
your Ochazuke takeout again.

1014
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:05,460
{\pos(192,283)}So you're friends with Mr Abe as well?

1015
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:07,310
{\pos(192,283)}Yes, of course!

1016
01:26:09,490 --> 01:26:12,940
{\pos(192,236)}Now, I see why you get
such awesome ideas.

1017
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,240
Okay.

1018
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,760
{\pos(192,283)}I'm interested.

1019
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,500
{\pos(192,283)}See you.

1020
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:19,620
{\pos(192,283)}It's nice to see you.

1021
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,590
{\pos(192,283)}Can you show me some more of this?

1022
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:25,150
{\pos(192,283)}Another one...

1023
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:25,720
is...

1024
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,300
{\pos(192,283)}Tonkatsu.

1025
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:30,070
{\pos(192,283)}Loco Moco.

1026
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,960
{\pos(192,283)}Loco Moco? I like Loco Moco.

1027
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:33,540
{\pos(192,283)}Lau Lau Chazuke.

1028
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,120
{\pos(192,283)}That's a good idea.

1029
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:40,630
What can I do for you?

1030
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:47,060
Well, Akane...

1031
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,900
do you know that Ochazuke hawker?

1032
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:51,960
"Ochazuke hawker"?

1033
01:26:55,940 --> 01:27:01,040
He was at the Loa Ridge party
trying to find backers for his business.

1034
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:03,230
Are you interested in that?

1035
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:04,560
Of course not!

1036
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:09,270
Anyway.

1037
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:12,090
He doesn't need my money and...

1038
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:16,030
he has no lack of interested investors.

1039
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:20,180
What's the big deal about it anyway?

1040
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:26,340
So you don't like Ochazuke that much.

1041
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:28,500
– Thank you.
– Thank you.

1042
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,340
Minori, will you be at your
boyfriend's place today as well?

1043
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,400
Why don't you join us for drinks?

1044
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,390
Minori!

1045
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,690
Thanks for your help back there.

1046
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:44,660
How did it go?

1047
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,200
He's going to invest.

1048
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,080
Really? That's wonderful.

1049
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,040
It's all thanks to you, Minori.

1050
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,990
This calls for a celebration, right?

1051
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,520
– Did he agree to it all?
– I can't thank you enough.

1052
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,050
Everything went so smoothly.

1053
01:27:59,050 --> 01:27:59,810
I see.

1054
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:02,460
I'm so relieved.

1055
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:03,420
What did he say?

1056
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:05,290
He took the initiative to discuss details.

1057
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:07,910
– I see. So he was into it?
– Totally.

1058
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,780
Excuse me...

1059
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,850
Have you seen this lady?

1060
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,860
No?

1061
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:18,000
We don't know her.

1062
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,100
Sorry to bother you.

1063
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,100
Thank you.

1064
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,460
Where on earth are you, Minori?

1065
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,960
Excuse me...

1066
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,600
{\pos(192,283)}have you seen this lady?

1067
01:28:34,450 --> 01:28:36,150
{\pos(192,283)}No. Sorry.

1068
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:38,130
{\pos(192,283)}Thank you.

1069
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:52,890
I see.

1070
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:56,490
So you'll be expanding to the mainland.

1071
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:01,990
Up until now. I've been
so concerned with just staying afloat.

1072
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,870
I had to come up with new ideas
if the previous one didn't work out.

1073
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:11,910
There was constant pressure and,
I think I lost myself for a while.

1074
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:15,010
I know what you mean.

1075
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:16,470
Really?

1076
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,100
I did a lot of thinking
after I closed down my restaurant.

1077
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:27,200
I still remember the first time
I came to the States.

1078
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:31,660
When my dad was posted to the States...

1079
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:34,340
Mom and I visited him once.

1080
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:39,050
At the Arizona countryside.

1081
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:43,120
My father and I borrowed bicycles
and rode around in the neighborhood.

1082
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,200
We had burgers at a diner.

1083
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,580
That memory stuck in my mind.

1084
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,390
Remember what you said to me?

1085
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:59,670
You said I've got to know
what I want to do in life.

1086
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:13,710
Can I get your advice again when I start
scouting for shops in the mainland?

1087
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,500
Sure.

1088
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:22,120
But wouldn't it be better if
you consult an expert instead?

1089
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:30,970
I'd prefer someone who knows me
over an any business expert.

1090
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:45,100
Sure.

1091
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:55,900
They are probably just good friends.

1092
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:00,510
I can tell from their eyes
there's something going on.

1093
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,500
What are you going to do?

1094
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:10,050
Crush that Ochazuke hawker
with your wealth and influence?

1095
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:17,760
I thought I've found a woman
who can accept who I am.

1096
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:21,900
Any girl would say "yes" to you.

1097
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,330
But it's not for her!

1098
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,040
You've lost me.

1099
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:33,420
It doesn't matter to her who I am.

1100
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:38,340
You mean she'll dump you
in spite of your social status.

1101
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:42,560
What's so great about that Ochazuke guy?

1102
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,360
You're upsetting yourself
by letting your imagination run wild.

1103
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:47,260
So silly.

1104
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:50,990
I thought I've found a woman
who can accept who I am.

1105
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:54,830
We're just going in circles now.
May I go already?

1106
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,700
Hold on...

1107
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:00,210
– You're just repeating yourself.
– Just one more drink.

1108
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:00,930
One more drink.

1109
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,770
{\pos(192,252)}Check out this marlin!
I break the new record.

1110
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:09,160
– Get your hands off. 
– Just one more drink...

1111
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:13,460
Akane!

1112
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:18,300
Are you still trying to 
land yourself a rich guy?

1113
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,510
What's with you?

1114
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:22,100
Answer me!

1115
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,140
Of course not! Why would I?

1116
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,550
Then what are you doing?

1117
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:28,850
Honma, come and join us.

1118
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:31,510
How dare you!

1119
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:32,830
Honma.

1120
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:35,260
Where did you get that huge tuna?

1121
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,560
{\pos(192,283)}I made it. I did it!

1122
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,320
Minori, can you believe this?

1123
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:41,420
What's this?

1124
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:44,560
Honma doesn't trust me!

1125
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,370
That's totally understandable.

1126
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,650
I won't marry someone who doesn't trust me!

1127
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:51,870
Minori.

1128
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:55,130
Do you really think he's good enough?

1129
01:32:59,000 --> 01:32:59,850
Me?

1130
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:02,010
Minori, you should apologize him?

1131
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:05,470
Yeah, you're going to regret it
if he dumps you.

1132
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:09,310
{\pos(192,283)}Tomoya, this is my new record, bro!

1133
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:11,740
{\pos(192,283)}My battle...

1134
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:13,700
{\pos(192,283)}I hate trawling!

1135
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:15,270
{\pos(192,283)}It's stupid!

1136
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,630
{\pos(192,283)}Shut the f*ck up!

1137
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,600
{\pos(192,285)}Tomoya, you never know the high of it.

1138
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,360
Do you really think that Ochazuke
dude is good enough for you?

1139
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:27,500
You're mistaken. We just ran into
each other at the restaurant.

1140
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,570
He's better than someone collecting bottles.

1141
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:33,000
Is that how you judge people?

1142
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,700
Look who's talking!

1143
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:37,800
I gave up a lot of opportunities
just to be with you, Honma!

1144
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:38,780
I knew it!

1145
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:40,660
So you do regret choosing me!

1146
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:41,700
No, I don't!

1147
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:44,180
You will definitely regret it.
You'd better kiss and make up.

1148
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:47,600
What's wrong with me?

1149
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,790
Seriously, who are you?

1150
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,280
What do you want to be?

1151
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:56,890
Minori, Mr Abe runs a major
international company...

1152
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:57,960
You...!

1153
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,160
will do anything to land a rich husband!

1154
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,840
How dare you!

1155
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:06,600
Yeah, I'll do anything!

1156
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:14,700
Darn you!

1157
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:23,500
Bring it on!

1158
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:26,390
Come on!

1159
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:27,550
We need to talk.

1160
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:29,690
Mr Abe!

1161
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:31,680
It's all a misunderstanding.

1162
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,010
Minori only has eyes for you.

1163
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,610
That's what I think.

1164
01:34:35,610 --> 01:34:37,500
Who is this guy?

1165
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,620
Oh, pardon me.

1166
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:43,690
I run a condominium
and yacht resale company.

1167
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:50,690
– Here's my another name card.
– Get out of my way!

1168
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:55,310
No... stop it!

1169
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,450
We'll let them work it out.

1170
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,600
Akane!

1171
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:13,280
We're nothing but 
convenient tools to guys like him.

1172
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,480
We're not human to them.

1173
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,050
Don't you understand?

1174
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:18,850
Just let go of him.

1175
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,080
Wait...!

1176
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:38,170
The problems lies with yourself!
Do something about it!

1177
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:43,790
What did I do?

1178
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:47,600
So you're nice to everyone?

1179
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:01,390
For being so nice to me...

1180
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,560
Thank you!

1181
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:06,900
Are you okay?

1182
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:09,920
Are you okay?

1183
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:11,990
Calm down!

1184
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,170
You'll kill him!

1185
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:18,670
He's killing Honma!

1186
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,300
Just calm down!

1187
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:41,230
Well...

1188
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,290
You all carry on then.

1189
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,940
We shall make a move.

1190
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,510
Goodbye.

1191
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,260
I'm really sorry.

1192
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:08,250
I'm okay now.

1193
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:09,430
Really?

1194
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:22,600
I'm so sorry.

1195
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:25,260
I had a drop too much.

1196
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:27,250
It's okay.

1197
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:34,560
Is your business doing well?

1198
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,060
Well...

1199
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:38,600
I'm just starting out.

1200
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:40,410
I see.

1201
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,990
If you need any help,
you can come to me.

1202
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:56,640
Thanks.

1203
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,550
I'm sorry I went ballistic.

1204
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:11,460
That's what keeps you...

1205
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:14,200
from getting ahead.

1206
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:16,710
I'm sorry.

1207
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,450
So when's the weddings?

1208
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:38,130
I don't know if I'll go through with it.

1209
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,600
I mean the wedding ceremony.

1210
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,400
Thank god.

1211
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:47,900
You worry too much.

1212
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,150
What is it?

1213
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,610
Do you know him?

1214
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:31,570
No.

1215
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:34,060
Just a stranger.

1216
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,010
Sorry about today.

1217
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:50,130
No worries.

1218
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:54,480
We'll celebrate another day.

1219
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:00,380
But...

1220
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,400
won't he get angry again?

1221
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:18,400
I'll be busy planning my trip
to scout for shops anyway.

1222
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:24,800
See you then.

1223
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:42,610
I'm sorry.

1224
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:41,600
What's wrong?

1225
01:42:58,730 --> 01:43:02,070
{\pos(192,236)}What happened to the 
natural gas plant in the Caspian sea?

1226
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:04,530
{\pos(192,283)}Well, nothing much has happened.

1227
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:07,840
{\pos(192,236)}Well, who is the principal company,
The UK again?

1228
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:11,160
{\pos(192,236)}No way. 
Azerbaijan will have thirty percent...

1229
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,330
{\pos(192,283)}the two Japanese will take ten percent...

1230
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,460
{\pos(192,283)}and we have fifteen percent.

1231
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:19,590
{\pos(192,236)}You'll still have to stick with the
Russian pipeline. We can't live without it.

1232
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:24,210
{\pos(192,235)}I don't think Europe wants Russia
to have any control of the business anymore.

1233
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:26,170
{\pos(192,284)}Absolutely true.

1234
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:29,220
{\pos(192,252)}Even if you extend it to 
the black sea through Georgia...

1235
01:43:29,390 --> 01:43:31,470
{\pos(192,283)}There's a problem in South Ossetia.

1236
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,810
{\pos(192,285)}You don't know when Russia will be involved.

1237
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:36,440
{\pos(192,283)}Thus you cannot pass Armenia.

1238
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:42,070
{\pos(192,236)}You lay it from Turkey to
the Adriatic Sea out to Italy.

1239
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,510
{\pos(192,237)}What if we let that joint venture company
from Switzerland handle it?

1240
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,410
{\pos(192,252)}I don't think even they
could remedy the situation.

1241
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:51,070
{\pos(192,284)}It's a fool's errand.

1242
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:55,620
{\pos(192,283)}Hey, you want to give it a try?

1243
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:58,210
{\pos(192,283)}Sure.

1244
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:59,880
{\pos(192,284)}I'll do it.

1245
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:06,720
{\pos(192,236)}I'll be flying over there next month
and be in charge there.

1246
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:10,800
{\pos(192,283)}I won't be back until I accomplish the project.

1247
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:17,020
{\pos(192,283)}I see.

1248
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:22,700
I give you credit.

1249
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:25,500
– Thank you.
– That's impressive.

1250
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:31,250
Aiko, Satoshi.

1251
01:45:31,650 --> 01:45:33,000
Congratulations!

1252
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:37,570
I've been asked to make a speech.

1253
01:45:37,570 --> 01:45:39,440
My name is Endo Kayoko.

1254
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:49,250
Because they're holding their wedding
here in Hawaii,

1255
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:51,200
I did a little research.

1256
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:01,490
Is she going to quote from a travel guide?

1257
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:03,100
You've got to admire her style.

1258
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:06,600
Let's see...

1259
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:11,950
In Hawaii, people greet
each other with the word "Aloha."

1260
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:14,300
This word...

1261
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:19,600
"Aloha" means...

1262
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,300
Love.

1263
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:23,200
Pride.

1264
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:24,930
Wisdom.

1265
01:46:25,770 --> 01:46:26,640
Welcome.

1266
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:28,050
Trust.

1267
01:46:28,830 --> 01:46:29,800
Hello.

1268
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:31,070
Goodbye.

1269
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,600
Thank you...

1270
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:34,520
and I love you.

1271
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:37,290
It is a beautiful word...

1272
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:39,460
with a wealth of meaning.

1273
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:42,020
But when translated literally...

1274
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:47,660
"Alo" from Aloha means "to share."

1275
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,600
And "ha" from Aloha means "breathing"

1276
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:56,400
Put together, it means "shared breathing."

1277
01:46:58,180 --> 01:47:01,350
In Japanese, we have a similar phrase...

1278
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:03,230
that means a perfect match.

1279
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,970
In a marriage...

1280
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:10,920
it's not wealth or looks that matters,

1281
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:16,240
but compatibility and finding whether
someone who is your perfect match.

1282
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:18,660
It sure is.

1283
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,000
It really is.

1284
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,220
With that meaning in mind,

1285
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:28,500
I think Aiko and Satoshi...

1286
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,900
can be said to be
a perfect match made in heaven.

1287
01:47:34,850 --> 01:47:35,780
Aloha!

1288
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:59,500
You're next, Akane.

1289
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,950
We'll just be having a party at the shop.

1290
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:04,300
– Really?
– Yes.

1291
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,160
Will you stop that?

1292
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,500
What's wrong?

1293
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,470
I'm just getting my money's worth.

1294
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,250
Have you found a job yet?

1295
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:26,560
I'm thinking of becoming an editor
for a free town paper...

1296
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:27,800
or a waitress.

1297
01:48:28,490 --> 01:48:29,620
The editor sounds good.

1298
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:32,530
I don't know.

1299
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:35,850
But what a shame...

1300
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:39,600
you could have been living up at Loa Ridge.

1301
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:42,270
That's true.

1302
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:29,600
How was the States?

1303
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:31,450
I forgot, this is the States too.

1304
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:32,880
Are you waiting for someone?

1305
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,280
I see.

1306
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:39,100
Let me help you.

1307
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,020
Thank you.

1308
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,240
So where will you be setting up
your first shop on the mainland?

1309
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:52,900
I think I'll start at Washington D.C..

1310
01:49:53,550 --> 01:49:54,550
Because it's the capital?

1311
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:57,130
That's funny.

1312
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:59,150
I visited Texas too. Great place.

1313
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:00,600
As I expected...

1314
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,200
a nation-wide chain store
should start from the capital.

1315
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:06,500
Sounds exciting.

1316
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:11,250
How was the wedding?

1317
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:13,210
It was beautiful.

1318
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:15,250
Were you envious?

1319
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:20,210
I can imagine.

1320
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:29,550
Is he well?

1321
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:33,970
The successor to Abe corporation.

1322
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:39,450
I haven't seen him in a while.

1323
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:41,690
Really?

1324
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:42,780
Why not?

1325
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:49,180
Because I'm a commoner.

1326
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:02,060
Actually, I...

1327
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:08,900
I...

1328
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:25,010
When do you suppose 
I'll be able to get married?

1329
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:32,590
Soon, I suppose.

1330
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:37,100
Really?

1331
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,280
Yeah.

1332
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:39,860
I'm sure of it.

1333
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:42,800
You think so?

1334
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:44,010
Yes.

1335
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:45,970
Are you sure?

1336
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:46,640
Yes.

1337
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:47,470
Do you mean it?

1338
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:48,190
Of course.

1339
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:51,890
I guess...

1340
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:54,470
I'll take your word for it.

1341
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,600
Excuse me.

1342
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,280
Here's the manuscript from Minori.

1343
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:11,460
Is it done?

1344
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:13,640
Here you go.
