1
00:00:11,585 --> 00:00:13,344
Which of the bikes should we load up?

2
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:17,050
Actually none of the bikes. Just the boxes, thanks.

3
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:32,911
Alright guys, I'll be downstairs if you want to grab a drink later.

4
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:47,128
You're already in L.A.

5
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:57,552
You never came back.

6
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,396
I try to think about tomorrow.

7
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,355
Does it hurt?

8
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:13,240
You tell me.

9
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:27,561
-Hey. -Hey.

10
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:31,364
-I see you're all done upstairs. -Yeah. Off for the day.

11
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:32,585
No way.

12
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,408
-Jung? -You...you know this?

13
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:37,145
I do know it. Self-help or school?

14
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:42,141
Come on. Jung isn't exactly a recreational reading.

15
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:47,504
Individuality, consciousness, the dissolving into the crowd.

16
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,531
Yeah, yeah. Sounds like you're a fan.

17
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,711
I am a fan.

18
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:54,929
Self-help or school?

19
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,807
Recreation.

20
00:02:58,181 --> 00:02:59,623
-So what are you drinking? -Pale Ale.

21
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,465
Pale Ale? Ok.

22
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,708
So...

23
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:26,121
I know. This is gonna sound weird

24
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:27,505
but, uh...

25
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:31,090
What are your thoughts on dancing?

26
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:35,503
-Are you ask...asking me to dance? -Well, it depends.

27
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:37,436
Are you looking to dance?

28
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,640
You're asking me.

29
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:44,140
Yeah. I'm asking you. Is that a yes?

30
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:05,192
"I would be a warrior."

31
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:13,762
Do you always ask strangers to dance with you?

32
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,832
Do you always lead?

33
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:20,144
I'm Jordan.

34
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,963
Spencer.

35
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:32,946
"and you would be a thief"

36
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:38,153
"but you would be a good thief"

37
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:53,419
"and what kind of warrior would I be?"

38
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:05,879
I'm afraid I'll forget.

39
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,089
I feel like I've already lost.

40
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,102
What is there to win?

41
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:27,821
If you're always afraid, how will you live?
