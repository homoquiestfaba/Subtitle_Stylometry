5
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:37,684
All right, next call.

6
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:41,213
Doctor, I just want you to know
how much your support has meant.

7
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:43,583
Oh, it just takes time.

8
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:46,282
I know, and I really appreciate it.

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,160
You have been a great, great inspiration
to our Iisteners, Ray...

10
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:58,396
...and although you have come
a very Iong way...

11
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:01,632
- ...the journey to healing isn't over yet.
- Tell her you Iove her.

12
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:04,572
Yeah, well, I'm a changed man, doc.

13
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:07,942
And now that I'm getting out,
there's somebody very special...

14
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:11,175
- ...I'm gonna get back in my life.
- Oh, and I'm sure you will.

15
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:16,186
I'm sure you will,
but it does take time and....

16
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,630
Go get them, Ray-Ray.

17
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:40,543
Hey, Ray, take care now, all right?

18
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:41,738
You too, bro.

19
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:44,178
These are for you.

20
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:50,014
- What am I gonna do with these?
- Give them to your kids.

21
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,159
Don't be afraid to read one,
maybe you'll Iearn something.

22
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,161
- Dinosaurs?
- Helped pass the time.

23
00:01:57,898 --> 00:01:59,889
One in here special for you.

24
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:04,199
"39 Paths to Self Discovery
by Dr. Marjorie."

25
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:07,772
I've walked down every one of those paths
in the Iast seven years, Jimmy.

26
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:11,167
Let me tell you something, Oprah,
all roads Iead right back here.

27
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:15,007
- Failure is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- Just platitudes, brother.

28
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:16,945
Easier said than done.

29
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
We'll see.

30
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,401
- Good Iuck, Ray-Ray.
- Thanks, man.

31
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,668
You know what?
It's a whole new world for me.

32
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,539
From now on, it's just Ray.

33
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:47,509
Just plain Ray.

34
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:52,210
Let me ask you something, what's a guy
fresh out of prison usually do first?

35
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,811
Usually something stupid.

36
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,815
Not this time, my friend.

37
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,058
We'll keep a Iight on for you.

38
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,823
Ray-Ray.

39
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:35,052
Come Iook at me, Ray.

40
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,353
Look at me, Ray-Ray.

41
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:40,155
You can't ignore me forever.
I'm here to help.

42
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:45,467
I don't see anybody else around to help
you on the day you get out of prison.

43
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:47,168
Friends forever.

44
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:52,611
Through thick and thin. Come on, Ray,
I'll give you a ride to wherever you want.

45
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:55,680
Come on, Ray-Ray.
I owe you that much at Ieast.

46
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:02,011
It's Ray. Plain Ray.

47
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,448
What happened to the other Ray?

48
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:07,550
- I wanna drive.
- What?

49
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,024
I wanna drive.

50
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:12,221
I've been inside for seven years.
It's what I do. I wanna drive.

51
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,162
You wanna drive?

52
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,934
If that'll make you happy.

53
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:32,144
- What are you doing?
- You're right, Larue.

54
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:34,781
You do owe me one.

55
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,447
Give me back my car!

56
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,159
This is no way to continue a friendship!

57
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:46,928
Damn. I can't believe I fell for that.

58
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,256
See you tomorrow.

59
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,888
I'm the inventor of my future.

60
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:56,297
I'm the inventor of my future.
I'm the inventor of my future.

61
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,712
Hey, Slim.

62
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,045
Ray-Ray.

63
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,852
It's just Ray. Plain Ray.

64
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:27,865
Nice car.

65
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,729
Thanks. A friend Ioaned it to me.

66
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:34,898
- You shouldn't have come here, Ray.
- I told you I would. I had to.

67
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:38,172
Okay, then you do me a favor, Ray.

68
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:41,241
You turn around
and you Ieave right now.

69
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,117
Damn it. I didn't want this to happen.

70
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,889
Oh, my God.

71
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:58,057
Sally?

72
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,398
Are you who I think you are?

73
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:06,772
Oh, you take my breath away.

74
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:15,505
Seems funny now, you're being
so grown up and all, but here.

75
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,789
I'm sorry,
but I don't know what you expected.

76
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:41,839
Every journey begins with a step.

77
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,476
Hey, over here.

78
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:04,327
Sally, sorry to surprise you.
I told your mom I was coming.

79
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:08,160
I guess she didn't believe me
or something but-- Stop.

80
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:10,266
Come on.

81
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,599
How about it? Fresh start?
Remember the handshake?

82
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,910
You really think a stupid teddy bear...

83
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,807
...and some Iame handshake
are going to make things okay?

84
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,141
I'm a different man now, a better man.

85
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:27,377
Yeah. Then maybe you should try
your fresh start in Alaska.

86
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:32,318
Then I'll do what I've always done,
pretend you don't exist.

87
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,638
Which one of you
is blowing off fireworks?

88
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,410
He snuck up behind me
and he almost busted my eardrums.

89
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:01,679
"AII warfare is based on deception,"
buttwipe.

90
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:05,413
Yeah, and "he will win who knows
when to fight and when not to."

91
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:08,220
- You read The Art of War by Sun Tzu?
- Yeah, who hasn't?

92
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:12,057
Listen. You guys need to find a better way
to channel your aggression.

93
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,556
I found macramé
to be strangely comforting.

94
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:19,169
Show's over. Everyone, get to class.

95
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:20,670
You two, come with me.

96
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,239
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

97
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:23,873
Miss Miller?

98
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:25,874
Yes. Thank you, Mr...?

99
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:27,740
Ray Bradstone, Sally's dad.

100
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:29,006
Oh, how do you do?

101
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:30,376
I'm Miss Miller.

102
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,383
Sally, it's so nice
to finally meet your father.

103
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,350
Yeah, me too.

104
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:38,357
I've only met your Iovely wife.

105
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:40,389
I guess you've been busy working?

106
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,994
Funny, I just spent the Iast seven years
in federal--

107
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:44,186
Government.

108
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,891
Yeah, he does a Iot of work
for the federal government.

109
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,764
Oh, I see. Mr. Bradstone...

110
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:54,406
- ...do you know about our school trip?
- School trip?

111
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:57,338
Sally, I can't believe you haven't
told your dad. How come?

112
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,809
You know, he's been working a Iot Iately.
And it just--

113
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,747
Well, we have a bit of a problem that
I think you might be able to help with.

114
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,217
The school trip is scheduled
for next weekend...

115
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:10,618
- ...and we're short a chaperone.
- No, no, no.

116
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,657
The New Orleans Museum of Art.
The dinosaur exhibit is there.

117
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:15,919
Dinosaurs? I Iove dinosaurs.

118
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,893
Well, fantastic. It's settled then.

119
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:20,960
Yeah, I guess it is.

120
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:25,327
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

121
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:30,001
Hey. If this is gonna work between us...

122
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,644
...we gotta confront it,
tell the truth and Iet it go.

123
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:35,906
No, this isn't going to work between us.

124
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:39,415
What did you expect me to say to her,
"Meet my dad, the criminal"?

125
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:43,646
- I appreciate you not selling me out, but--
- I didn't do that for you. I did it for me.

126
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:47,486
- I don't even know you.
- That's why I'm here. To change that.

127
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,684
Oh, really?

128
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:51,762
Yeah, what was the Iast thing you said,
the "Iet it go" part?

129
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:54,024
You might wanna try that, Iike, now.

130
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:59,598
Because if you go on that field trip,
I'm not.

131
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,782
Your husband hurt you very much,
and no one's denying that.

132
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:14,579
But you have to let it go and move on.

133
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,312
Remember the three essentials?

134
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,617
- Confront it. Be truthful. Let it go.
- Confront it. Be truthful. Let it go.

135
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:25,093
Now, sounds like it's time,
don't you think?

136
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:30,302
I've already forgotten the car incident
and I'm willing to try again.

137
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,199
- What do you want?
- I want a minute.

138
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,500
- I don't have a minute.
- This can't be where you're staying.

139
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:40,544
This can't be the digs of the best driver
and getaway man in the business.

140
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:43,978
I know how it is when you get out.
You need help? I'm here to help.

141
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,675
Take this. It's my pleasure.

142
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,921
You need to walk away.

143
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:54,424
I respect that you're upset.
You got a right to be, my friend.

144
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,118
I was just trying to help.

145
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:59,423
You knew the silent alarm was tripped,
you walked out the back door.

146
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,362
Ray, the cops was on you already.

147
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:04,298
You Ieft me sitting in that car.
I still didn't rat you out.

148
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,668
That's exactly why I'm here, bro.
To try to make things right between us.

149
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:12,242
Honest to God, I am haunted by it.

150
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:15,506
I mean it when I say I owe you one.

151
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,239
I know that. I know I owe you.

152
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,011
I'm putting the crew back together.
It's a bank.

153
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:25,015
So ripe, it's a crime how easy it is.

154
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:28,752
Make you whole again,
get you out of this toilet.

155
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:32,625
And all you gotta do
is what you do best.

156
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,596
Drive.

157
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:42,300
Seven years. Seven years.

158
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:46,002
I Iost my wife, I Iost my kid!

159
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:55,346
You'll change your mind, Ray-Ray.
You're one of us.

160
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:56,988
Since we were Iittle kids.

161
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:59,354
Let it go.

162
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,386
I'm gonna make things right.

163
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:09,867
Got it?

164
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:14,536
- Dr. Etman, we have your new TV.
- Outstanding.

165
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:17,073
Family room, in the back to the right.
Thank you.

166
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,108
- AII right.
- Thank you.

167
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,075
Honey, I'll see you Iater--

168
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:22,475
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:23,876
No, I'm sorry.

170
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,484
- I'm....
- Putting in the HD? Come on in.

171
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:29,118
No. I'm Lynne's ex.

172
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:32,185
Wow, okay.

173
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,956
Marvin Etman. Doctor.

174
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:39,030
Marvin.

175
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,160
Lynne and I are....

176
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,795
- Marvin, could we have a minute, please?
- Okay, then.

177
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:51,834
Did you think you could just pretend
everything was the same?

178
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,502
Come on, Lynne, I've changed.
I really have, okay?

179
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,138
- I need your help with her, that's all.
- I forgot I was Ieaving.

180
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:00,979
I'm holding a staff meeting at 9.

181
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,949
- Did I mention I was a doctor?
- Yup.

182
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:07,557
AII right.

183
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,326
Okay.

184
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,300
- You want me to stay?
- No, no, no, I'm fine, Marvin.

185
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:18,733
- Thank you.
- Okay. AII right.

186
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:26,575
Marvin?

187
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,175
Marvin is a wonderful man
and Sally adores him.

188
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,409
And I'm Sally's father, okay?

189
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:37,989
I'm sorry, Ray, but we have built
a really good Iife without you here.

190
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,818
I'm a nurse now.

191
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:43,553
I struggled through school
as a single mom without you.

192
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:45,788
We did it
and that's the way it's gonna stay.

193
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,899
That is not fair.

194
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:51,197
I at Ieast deserve a second chance
to know my own daughter.

195
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,669
Your daughter is not the same Iittle girl
you remember.

196
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,741
What happened hurt her more deeply
than you could understand.

197
00:14:58,077 --> 00:15:01,604
I understand how you feel. I really do.

198
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:04,839
Just tell me what I gotta do, you know?

199
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:07,781
I'll earn a second chance,
but tell me what I have to do.

200
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:12,152
What do you want me to say, Ray?
There's no magic bullet here.

201
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:14,459
Try acting Iike a parent.

202
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,788
Prove that you're responsible, reliable.

203
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:19,856
Do you even have a job?

204
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,429
I gotta go.

205
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:42,348
I can fix anything on four wheels.

206
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:45,354
- Ever done a Hummer?
- You're talking about the car, right?

207
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:48,322
I mean, pretty much,
a car's a car, right?

208
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:50,491
They're all the same.

209
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,993
How about a Smart car?

210
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,831
Is that a real car?

211
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,135
What about a hybrid?

212
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,336
Like a Smart Hummer?

213
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,372
Live fungus is kept in the cooler.

214
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:07,444
And these are bran, Iow-fat,
no-fat chocolate chip cookies...

215
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:12,073
...our garden vegetable burgers,
and our tossed organic green salads...

216
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:14,151
...with a sprout and carrot medley.

217
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,984
And that, of course, is our wheatgrass.

218
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,789
Any questions?

219
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:26,632
- No meat?
- No meat.

220
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:28,259
But you got fungus.

221
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,959
Yes, indeed. We move tons of fungus.

222
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:33,704
- Nice juicy steak, no?
- No.

223
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:37,206
Cholesterol? Through the roof.
Not good.

224
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:40,710
I gotta tell you,
meat's been pretty good to me.

225
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,142
Maybe you ought to give it a shot.

226
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,448
Okay, that's good.

227
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:51,317
High school, good.

228
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,653
And for the past seven years,
you have been...?

229
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:56,055
Incarcerated.

230
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,131
Is that gonna be a problem?

231
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:05,262
It's hard being on the outside,
you know?

232
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:09,138
Things are different,
stuff just moves so much faster.

233
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:11,799
How are things
with your daughter, Ray?

234
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:13,773
Not good.

235
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:17,077
She really doesn't want to have
anything to do with me.

236
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:19,479
Maybe she just needs some more time.

237
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,211
No.

238
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:23,882
You know, they seem happy.

239
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:27,890
Big house. Lots of stuff.
My ex-wife's boyfriend is this rich doctor.

240
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,187
I can't compete with that.

241
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:33,688
But you are her father, Ray.

242
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,197
Don't ever forget that.

243
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:39,028
Yeah. I haven't.

244
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,239
She has.

245
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:13,536
Fire funny to you?

246
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,976
Not ha-ha kind, but, Iike, ironic.

247
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,339
Everything I had Ieft in the world...

248
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:24,111
...is in that apartment.

249
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:26,778
Man, that's.... That's rough.

250
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,185
It wasn't much.

251
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,408
Tell me about the bank.

252
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,827
Good to have you back, Ray-Ray.

253
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:27,372
So glad to have you aboard,
Mr. Abromowitz.

254
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,480
Please. Stanley.

255
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:31,976
Well, it's just you and me, Stanley.

256
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:35,177
- We have our hands full.
- As Iong as you're here, could be worse.

257
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:38,148
- I'm sorry?
- I mean-- You know what you mean.

258
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:44,624
Thanks, Dad.

259
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:54,331
Eight-fifty-six and six seconds.

260
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:55,735
Very efficient, Simon.

261
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:58,568
You know you're only allowed two bags.

262
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:01,577
I'm aware of the regulations
but these are all essential.

263
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:03,647
Meds and specialty diet food.

264
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:06,341
Laptop. iPad and clothes.

265
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,918
Hypoallergenic pillow.

266
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:10,954
Okay. That's enough. My head hurts,
and we're Iate as it is.

267
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,648
So take your things over there.
I'll make an exception.

268
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,690
Nick?

269
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:24,498
Can you tell me why
you haven't Ioaded a single bag?

270
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,236
Picture hasn't formed yet.

271
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:28,931
Great.

272
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:37,512
It is good to have you back, Ray-Ray.

273
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,348
You know the one thing I really enjoyed
about prison, Goldy?

274
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,544
What's that?

275
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,120
The absence of you.

276
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:53,226
Keep tapping your hands Iike that
I'm gonna cut them off.

277
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,458
I'm gonna cut off your hands.

278
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,693
Why--? What--? What do you--? What?

279
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:22,216
Okay. Even if somebody trips the alarm,
cops' response is five to seven minutes.

280
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:24,919
We're out of there in under three,
no matter what.

281
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:27,429
In case something happens
in those three minutes...

282
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,659
...just press the call button,
Iet us know.

283
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:30,995
Goldy, the masks.

284
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,574
Condi Rice? Interesting choice.

285
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,409
They discontinued Rumsfeld.

286
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,982
Let's do this.

287
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:50,852
- You sure you're gonna be okay?
- Yes, Mom. It's only one night.

288
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,924
It's the first time we've been away
from each other Iike this.

289
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,683
I'll be fine.

290
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:57,158
You'll be fine.

291
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:01,197
Marvin will be fine. You're gonna have
a great time without me.

292
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:05,531
- You have my number if anything happens.
- I do as Iong as you haven't changed it.

293
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:07,932
I Iove you.

294
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,268
- I Iove you too.
- Okay.

295
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:13,001
- Have fun.
- I will.

296
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:15,806
- Be safe.
- Thanks, Mom.

297
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,878
- Trick or treat. Everybody down.
- Everybody down.

298
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:21,986
You heard the man. Get on the ground.

299
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:25,954
Not you. Come on. Give it.
Come on, genius. AII the money.

300
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,632
- Hey.
- Hey.

301
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:51,244
Heck, yeah, you're doing great.

302
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:54,509
Don't touch, Daddy. I can do it.

303
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:58,384
I know, I'm not doing anything.
You're doing it all by yourself.

304
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:01,890
I know, Daddy.
I can drive just Iike you now.

305
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:05,891
Okay. Pull over to the curb.

306
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:15,934
That was awesome.

307
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:18,400
Handshake?

308
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:25,107
Thanks, Daddy.

309
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:42,797
Not again.

310
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:05,746
This is Meredith Sherbourne confirming
my 4:00 with Dr. Frankenheimer.

311
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:08,449
I have the address, yes. Thanks.

312
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:10,652
Isn't there, Iike, a recovery period?

313
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,228
Not with Dr. Frankenheimer.

314
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:17,232
He did Jessica Simpson, and her Iips
were paparazzi-ready in 24 hours.

315
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:19,393
Mr. Choi? This is Ted.

316
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:22,699
The guy who ordered the six boxes
of cherry bombs and M-80s.

317
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,400
Okay. Yeah.
I'll be at your store before you close.

318
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,838
Josh, there's a seat back here.

319
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:34,916
Hey, Brenda. Okay if I sit here?

320
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:38,648
- Sure. Might as well.
- Thanks.

321
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:43,193
Children, I don't want any inappropriate
use of cell phones or iPods.

322
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:45,660
And no gum.

323
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:48,864
Oh, Mr. Bradstone.

324
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,399
You still short a chaperone?

325
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:53,697
Yes, we are. Welcome aboard.

326
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:58,199
Come on.
Big bucks, no whammies, baby.

327
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:00,042
Get that bag. Come on.

328
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:05,009
Coming up on two and a half minutes.

329
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:09,354
- What the hell are you Iooking at?
- I'm sorry.

330
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,113
Your mask.

331
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,848
Condoleezza Rice, right?

332
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:14,117
What?

333
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,058
You think this is funny?

334
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:19,857
You do realize I'm robbing you, right, Iady?
You do see the gun, right?

335
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:22,592
You think it's funny, a gun in your face?

336
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,702
Like I won't shoot you dead?

337
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,132
Like I'm joking around?

338
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,535
So you didn't intend it to be funny?

339
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:30,641
Everybody, Iisten up.

340
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:35,039
I would Iike you to meet Sally's father,
Mr. Bradstone.

341
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:37,682
He will be joining us.

342
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:43,553
Please, God, take me now.

343
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:47,920
- Oh, won't you sit down?
- Thanks.

344
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,923
Cops! You said five minutes!

345
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:57,967
They're still a ways off and we've got
Ray-Ray behind the wheel. Let's go.

346
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:03,041
Thank you very much.

347
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:07,211
Hey, okay, Iet's go. Let's go. Let's go.

348
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:13,212
- Okay. Go, go, go. Come on.
- Go, go, go.

349
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,225
Where the hell is Ray-Ray?

350
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:23,623
I'm gonna kill Ray-Ray twice.

351
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:26,161
- He took the keys. Why take the keys?
- You serious?

352
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:27,355
Shut up, all right?

353
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,968
They didn't see us come out the bank.
They don't know we robbed the bank.

354
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,797
Just be calm. Stay calm.

355
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:42,008
Run!

356
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:50,048
Del, where the hell are you going?

357
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:58,625
Listen to me.
Please, get off this bus now.

358
00:26:58,897 --> 00:26:59,989
I'm begging you.

359
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,556
I get off this bus, I Iose you forever.

360
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:05,430
Same goes if you stay.

361
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:06,962
Let it go.

362
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:34,156
Oh, dude,
you messed up my bags, man.

363
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:38,198
- Hey.
- He's got the money.

364
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,601
Come on. We gotta go.
That money ain't no good to us in jail.

365
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:46,303
- What the hell is he doing?
- Larue, we gotta go now.

366
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:14,368
Hey, you probably ought to get moving.

367
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:16,439
Cops are gonna jam us up.
No field trip.

368
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,599
I Iike to Iet the engine warm up first.

369
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:21,541
I find that a warm engine
is a happy engine.

370
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:23,943
It's warm. Go.

371
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:25,515
Now.

372
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:54,444
Officer involved in a 10-20.
Possibly 10-20-I.

373
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,822
Excuse me.
You don't wanna go to work today.

374
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:13,055
- Why not?
- Because we have guns.

375
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:14,892
And we need your car.

376
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:17,592
- It's a police emergency.
- Commandeering.

377
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:20,437
Except we're not the police.

378
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:22,596
I always wanted to do that.

379
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:33,983
We gotta get that money back.

380
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:42,991
There.

381
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:47,055
Well, Iook who's going on a field trip.

382
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:02,310
Hey, hey, hey.

383
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:04,673
- Come on. The truck.
- I see it.

384
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:06,610
The truck!

385
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,296
So let me get this straight.

386
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,874
He took your Visa, your MasterCard,
your American Express....

387
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:33,067
Get out.

388
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,213
You're not supposed to move
after a blow.

389
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,838
- I just went to a safety seminar.
- Come on. Get out of here.

390
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:41,383
Hey. You bruised my coccyx.

391
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:43,350
I don't see the bus.

392
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:47,458
Well, Redwood Junior High School
Ioves New Orleans.

393
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:55,829
We're just gonna ask a few questions.

394
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:59,459
- Who would you say was in charge?
- I'm not following.

395
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:01,572
It's a simple question.
Who was in charge?

396
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,230
Bush or Cheney?

397
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:04,602
Not sure.

398
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:07,336
I couldn't keep my eyes off
of Condoleezza Rice.

399
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,809
It made no sense to me.

400
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,074
A man chooses
a Condoleezza Rice mask to rob a bank...

401
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,186
...then gets offended when somebody
has a perfectly normal reaction to it?

402
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:20,681
At first I thought, "Hey,
I almost don't mind being robbed...

403
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:24,795
...by a guy in a Condoleezza Rice mask.
It shows he has a sense of humor."

404
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:26,590
I Iike a guy with a sense of humor.

405
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:29,893
Detectives?
We found these keys in the bushes.

406
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,536
They fit the SUV out front.
And we got a print.

407
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:45,706
Let me up. I gotta go talk to my kid.

408
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:06,461
Sally, I know I don't have a place
in your heart right now...

409
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:07,969
...or your mom's.

410
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:10,130
At Ieast not yet.

411
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:12,302
But I was kind of hoping...

412
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:16,038
...that you could give me a chance
to at Ieast show you the real me.

413
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:19,880
This might be my Iast shot at it.
What do you say?

414
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:22,219
I don't see you.

415
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:24,685
I don't hear you.

416
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:26,653
You're not even on the bus.

417
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:34,760
Stop the bus.

418
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,430
- What?
- You heard me. I said, stop the bus.

419
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,180
Hand it over.

420
00:32:57,155 --> 00:33:00,682
- Don't play dumb. Hand it over.
- Look, the shot wasn't meant for you.

421
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:04,795
Collateral damage is an inherent
byproduct of any armed conflict.

422
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:09,829
AII due respect to Sun Tzu...

423
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:11,696
...where I come from...

424
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,134
...you find the guy that did it...

425
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,399
...you tear his heart out.

426
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:29,712
I'm Mr. Bradstone.

427
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,889
I'm the chaperone.

428
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,583
It is too frigging Ioud in here.

429
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:39,821
And I've got a headache
the size of the moon.

430
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:42,290
Mr. Bradstone--

431
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:47,796
Now, I've got no intentions of traveling
with a bunch of screaming misfits.

432
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:50,736
So tone it way down.

433
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:54,236
And don't test me, or it'll get ugly.

434
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,405
If you understand English
raise your hands.

435
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:01,882
Now shut up.

436
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:12,922
Mr. Bradstone. Could...?

437
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:16,733
Hi.

438
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:20,100
We don't ever tell our children
to shut up.

439
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:23,172
Even when they misbehave
and act Iike brats.

440
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:25,566
Why not?

441
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:28,339
Do you know the definition of "Iawsuit"?

442
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:30,375
No matter what these children do...

443
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:33,244
...they cannot be met
with such verbal aggression.

444
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:40,956
Do you hear that?
Librarians kill for that kind of quiet.

445
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:42,817
I know.

446
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:44,427
Me too.

447
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:49,863
The problem is that when misbehavior
is met with your kind of strictness...

448
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:52,935
...bad behavior stops immediately...

449
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:57,939
...but then it begins again
and again and again.

450
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,066
Okay. Yeah.

451
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,942
Your turf.

452
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:05,677
Thank you.

453
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,816
Seen his tattoo?
It's not the type you get in the mall.

454
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:20,556
It's the type you get in a back alley with
a pen, guitar strings and a 9-volt battery.

455
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:22,825
Plus he read The Art of War.

456
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:26,596
Yeah, I know. I thought I was bad.
I've only read the CliffNotes.

457
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:30,502
- He's either a narc or a CIA agent.
- Or both.

458
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:32,472
He's hot. Old hot, but still.

459
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:34,339
Scary hot.

460
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:40,850
This guy's probably Special Forces
or Navy SEALs.

461
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:49,391
My marriage was a disaster.

462
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:52,555
I've been divorced seven years.

463
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:58,032
A day doesn't go by when I don't think of it
and get a pain right here.

464
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:01,903
Confront it. Tell the truth. Let it go.

465
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:05,065
You knocked off the first one,
work on the other two.

466
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:09,377
I feel something very deeply
for Miss Miller.

467
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:17,384
Happy for you.

468
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:19,555
But I need your advice.

469
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,419
You're a man of the world.

470
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:22,821
What do I say?

471
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:25,258
I'm so out of practice.

472
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:29,290
AII right, Iisten.

473
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:31,196
You're obviously a big talker, right?

474
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,430
The key for you is,
Iet her do some talking, all right?

475
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:39,043
And then when she's done talking,
inhale deeply...

476
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:41,234
...hold it.

477
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:42,674
Then respond.

478
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:45,142
Lets her think you're a big Iistener.

479
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:52,051
Breath mint wouldn't hurt either.

480
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,736
Came on a Iittle strong, huh?

481
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,272
I mean, we're here now, right?

482
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:14,240
So you gotta make the most
of the moment.

483
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:18,546
Are you high?

484
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:20,274
When are you gonna understand...

485
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:24,046
...that every second you're here
drives us farther apart?

486
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,414
Excuse me, sir.

487
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:29,856
My name is Josh. Listen, I really
appreciate what you did back there.

488
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:32,628
I swear I read this page 11 times.

489
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:34,526
Yeah.

490
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:37,224
Yeah, you know, it was pretty Ioud.

491
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,802
Yeah. Nice meeting you.

492
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,871
Well, I'm glad somebody appreciated it.

493
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:50,709
Just because that print is Ray Bradstone's
does not put him back behind bars.

494
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:52,907
It sure as hell puts him
at the crime scene.

495
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:54,108
Ray drives.

496
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:57,083
He saw things going bad on the inside
and took a walk.

497
00:37:57,255 --> 00:38:00,520
Seven years ago, I busted this guy.
You know what the joker says to me?

498
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:03,320
"Thank you.
I'm gonna turn my Iife around."

499
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:05,792
And you know what? I believed him.

500
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:16,196
Del.

501
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:18,537
Hey, Del.

502
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,343
Del, can you hear me?

503
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,106
There's no school today, Mommy.

504
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:29,052
AII right, Del, we know you hit
that bank on Main...

505
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,451
...and your associates, Phillip Larue
and Goldy Stentz, stole a car...

506
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:34,524
...right around the corner from the bank.

507
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:37,752
Why don't you make it easy on yourself
and tell us where they are.

508
00:38:38,062 --> 00:38:40,530
You saw a shooting star?

509
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:42,188
Focus, Del. Where's the money?

510
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,460
Pretty bus.

511
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:48,263
What bus?

512
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:51,464
Pretty signs.

513
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:56,445
Going on a trip for school.

514
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:04,117
School trip?
Field trip of some kind? What?

515
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:08,990
Oh, jeez.

516
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:16,965
Yeah?

517
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:20,197
Papers?

518
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:27,937
Redwood Junior High School.
Please connect me.

519
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:32,012
Redwood Junior High.

520
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:35,175
Yeah. You have that
field trip today, right?

521
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,415
Yeah, that's right. Who is this?

522
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:40,689
My niece forgot her--

523
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:42,758
She Ieft her backpack in my car.

524
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:44,895
She needs it right away.

525
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:47,688
I'm sorry. They're on their way.

526
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:50,390
We sent home agendas
for all the students.

527
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:53,128
Perhaps I could contact the teacher
in charge of the--

528
00:39:53,304 --> 00:39:58,105
Well, I'm in a bit of a panic here
because my niece needs her insulin...

529
00:39:58,276 --> 00:40:04,511
...and she forgot her schedule,
and you know how kids are.

530
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:07,776
It's not our policy to give out schedules
over the phone, sir.

531
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:10,921
Really? Well, I'm a Iawyer
with Stein, Simon and Moxie.

532
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:13,990
And if my Iittle niece
doesn't get her insulin...

533
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:16,217
...she could go into a coma...

534
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:20,992
...and, you know what, boom,
she'd go in a coma and she could die.

535
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:23,963
I'll still need the child's name, sir.
It's school policy.

536
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:28,831
- Bradstone.
- Bradstone.

537
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,272
Oh, Sally, yes.

538
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:36,808
Well, they're scheduled to arrive at the
New Orleans Museum of Art at 11 :00...

539
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:39,108
...then on to a tour
of the French Quarter...

540
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:44,050
...and then on to the
Satchmo Music Festival this evening.

541
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:46,414
Hello?

542
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:48,183
Hello?

543
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:53,294
You know, Larue, I've been thinking.

544
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:56,991
So Del ran around one side of the bus
with our money...

545
00:40:57,168 --> 00:41:03,368
...and come out the other side without it,
then it turns out Ray-Ray's on the bus?

546
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:08,608
I mean, you don't think....

547
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:13,910
You do think.

548
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:15,109
Ray-Ray.

549
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,681
Okay, everybody, Iisten up.

550
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:19,982
There are a few rules
that we need adhere to.

551
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:22,056
People.

552
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:25,684
Excuse me.
I need your attention, please.

553
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,624
People, I am talking.

554
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,495
Oh, for the Iove of-- Children.

555
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:32,160
Hey!

556
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:34,927
Listen up!

557
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:39,375
As of this moment,
consider yourself under my watch.

558
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:43,071
I expect all rules to be followed.

559
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:48,708
If not, meal rations will be taken away,
visitor privileges denied...

560
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:50,849
...and hard Iabor instituted.

561
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:58,193
I mean, you'll get a detention.

562
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:00,725
Right.

563
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:05,198
So file in, quietly.

564
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:09,773
You're Iearning.

565
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:13,507
Is this a field trip or basic training?

566
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:15,543
It's Iike a bad episode of Nanny 911.

567
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:19,380
And I thought my parents were Iosers.

568
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:26,618
Del Muniz sees a bus here by the school,
maybe it's a field trip or something.

569
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:31,285
Ten minutes Iater, the truck guy sees
Goldy and Larue driving alongside a bus.

570
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:33,862
- You think it's the same bus?
- Maybe.

571
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:37,091
What if our man Ray-Ray
is on that bus?

572
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:40,160
I bet you that if we find that bus...

573
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:42,863
...we're gonna find Ray
and a whole Iot of money.

574
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,598
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

575
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:47,801
I'm so sorry, but there's been
a bit of a mix-up.

576
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:51,745
Unfortunately, the docent assigned
to your class has called in sick...

577
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:54,248
...and we don't have anyone else
to cover the tour.

578
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:55,578
No tour.

579
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:59,087
- Yeah.
- Wait just a minute.

580
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:01,020
You don't have anyone to fill in?

581
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:03,160
I'm sorry, but not at the moment.

582
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:05,124
No problem.

583
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:07,091
I know the perfect person.

584
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:13,269
This is Oviraptor philoceratops.

585
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:16,031
- Anybody know what that means?
- No.

586
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:20,036
Sally?

587
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:21,269
No clue.

588
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:24,547
It means "egg snatcher."

589
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,780
- What was your name?
- Simon.

590
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:30,551
Not only is Simon
immaculately overdressed...

591
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:33,749
...he also happens to be correct.

592
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,252
Oh, so they stole eggs.

593
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:39,154
Kind of Iike dinosaur robbers.

594
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,322
Maybe they should've returned the eggs
and gone to dinosaur jail.

595
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:47,002
Maybe. Except that they weren't
egg robbers, they were egg protectors.

596
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,772
Oviraptors Iived
their whole Iives devoted...

597
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:52,409
...to defending their nests
and feeding their young.

598
00:43:52,576 --> 00:43:56,012
Well, they sucked at that, didn't they?
Since they are now extinct?

599
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,671
First of all, you shouldn't say "suck."

600
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:01,477
Second of all,
they did the best they could.

601
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:03,711
Well, their best wasn't good enough.

602
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:04,980
Was it?

603
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:08,685
Okay then.

604
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:10,486
Moving on.

605
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:14,495
Does anybody know what modern animal
is a direct descendant of the Oviraptor?

606
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,297
Anyone other than Simon?

607
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:22,972
How about you?
I see you trying to hide back there.

608
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,539
Come on, give it a shot.

609
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:26,870
I don't know. Lizards?

610
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:28,511
That's a really good guess.

611
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,342
I'm gonna give you a hint.

612
00:44:30,881 --> 00:44:33,850
They're around us everywhere,
crapping on everything.

613
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:35,615
Dogs?

614
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:39,516
So you think
that a Tyrannosaurus rex...

615
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,182
...is now being carried around
in a Iittle bag by Paris Hilton?

616
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:45,959
- What about cats?
- Way off.

617
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,654
AIIigators.

618
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:49,129
Snakes?

619
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,665
Bears?

620
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:52,860
- Elephants?
- Incorrect-o.

621
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:54,832
Chickens.

622
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,300
Wait. We have a winner.

623
00:44:58,109 --> 00:44:59,906
As funny as that sounds, she's right.

624
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:01,101
It's birds.

625
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:05,510
It's been proven now that birds' ancestors
all had fused clavicles...

626
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:07,378
...and well developed furcula.

627
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:09,712
You're saying birds descended
from dinosaurs.

628
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:10,911
Right.

629
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:12,555
That's pretty cool.

630
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:26,036
AII right, who wants to see
an Allosaurus?

631
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:27,830
This way.

632
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:30,840
You are doing wonderfully, Mr. B.

633
00:45:31,008 --> 00:45:32,600
Sorry.

634
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,408
- Hey.
- Hey.

635
00:45:34,578 --> 00:45:35,943
Your dad's pretty awesome.

636
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:38,104
He's one surprise after another.

637
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:41,615
You should see my beat on the woolly
mammoth. Really butter your muffin.

638
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:50,289
Kids, all right.

639
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:52,595
We've seen enough dead animals.

640
00:45:52,763 --> 00:45:54,890
How many dinosaurs
you're gonna Iook at?

641
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:59,102
Let's just go back to the bus
and just move on. Okay.

642
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,795
No, no. It's not part of the plan.

643
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:05,738
Everything's gonna be fine. Stanley here
is gonna take you all back to the bus.

644
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,641
- Just go with Stanley. I gotta take a Ieak.
- We have another hour and a half.

645
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:13,113
I know, but Stanley's gonna move you
along. Just follow Stanley.

646
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:15,013
Go with Stanley, get to the bus.

647
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:17,245
I'll meet you out there.
It's gonna work out.

648
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:19,588
- Really?
- It'll be fine. It'll be great.

649
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:21,725
Okay, we'll go back.

650
00:46:33,137 --> 00:46:34,695
Don't panic. Everything's fine.

651
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:36,635
This way. It's okay. Come on.

652
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:38,297
Okay, quietly, please.

653
00:46:38,476 --> 00:46:41,001
Orderly. Go on.

654
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,180
- You hear that?
- He Iikes to sing...

655
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:49,751
...while he goes number two.

656
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,354
He'll have to pick up the tempo a bit.
We got a fire.

657
00:46:52,523 --> 00:46:56,015
Trust me. Unless the fire
is under his rear end, he's not moving.

658
00:46:56,193 --> 00:46:58,787
- Hey, buddy, you done in there?
- Nope.

659
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:00,430
What do you think you're doing?

660
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:04,534
Little man, Daddy's coming in, okay?
Just stay here until I put out the fire.

661
00:47:43,007 --> 00:47:44,565
Daddy, are the firemen in here?

662
00:47:46,076 --> 00:47:50,069
- What are you doing here?
- You fed us to the dogs, Ray.

663
00:47:50,347 --> 00:47:52,907
I changed my mind, end of story.

664
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:56,450
I'm gonna make things right with my kid
and you're not gonna screw it up.

665
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,178
I owe you nothing.

666
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:00,724
I think you broke my nose.

667
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,352
That's a nice touch, using the kid
as a cover, but I don't buy it.

668
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,988
You Ieft us to take the hit, to get even,
and now you got the money too?

669
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:11,600
How would I have your money?

670
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:15,432
We saw Del doing his Iittle magic trick,
getting the money on that bus.

671
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,233
I walked away to save my family.

672
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:18,670
Yeah?

673
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:23,044
I tell you to get up?

674
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:30,611
We'll find you, Ray.
You can run, but you can't hide.

675
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:37,785
I see either one of you near my daughter,
I'm gonna finish this.

676
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:44,167
- Let's go. Everybody on the bus.
- No. What's going on?

677
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:46,667
- What happened?
- Nothing. Just gotta keep schedule.

678
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:48,065
Let's go. Get on the bus.

679
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,434
Listen, we can't go yet
because Nick isn't here.

680
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:54,476
This is a fire Iane. The fire department's
gonna be here any second.

681
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:56,203
You got his cell phone? Call him.

682
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,473
We aren't supposed to Ieave
for another hour.

683
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:01,277
I know, but who'd have known? Fire.
We gotta go. Come on.

684
00:49:01,452 --> 00:49:03,852
Get on the bus.
Sometimes you gotta zig, not zag.

685
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:07,582
Go. Call Nick, you tell him to meet us
at the hotel. Everything will be fine.

686
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:10,226
AII right, who's ready
for some field tripping?

687
00:49:31,815 --> 00:49:33,806
We gotta get a cab.

688
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:37,181
Right. I gotta do something about this.

689
00:49:51,235 --> 00:49:52,600
Why are you driving so fast?

690
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,466
- You're scaring everybody.
- Please, Sally. Trust me, okay?

691
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:58,938
I might not be the best parent in the world,
I know how to drive.

692
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:06,712
- Sorry.
- No problem.

693
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,628
Did I not park the bus right here?

694
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:30,100
We are gonna take a tour
of the historic French Quarter.

695
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:34,802
At the end of the tour, we're gonna go
by St. Louis Cemetery Number 1.

696
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:38,641
That cemetery was established
in 1789.

697
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:42,775
And in that cemetery, we're gonna visit
the tomb of Marie Laveau...

698
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:45,854
...the voodoo queen of New Orleans.

699
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:49,618
Supposedly that tomb
is the second most visited tomb...

700
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:52,421
...in the United States.

701
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,385
- Larue?
- Ray-Ray, you stole my car.

702
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:29,498
You stole my money, okay?
You humiliated us in a public bathroom.

703
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:32,794
My patience is wearing thin with you,
my friend.

704
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,369
Back the hell off, Larue.

705
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:38,768
You give me back my money and I'll
back off. I'm Iooking right at you, Ray.

706
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:42,702
Surprise.

707
00:51:44,214 --> 00:51:47,877
I swear to God, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face in front of your Iittle girl.

708
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:50,076
- Then you know what I'm gonna do--?
- No. No.

709
00:51:50,254 --> 00:51:51,983
You don't come anywhere near my kid.

710
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:54,687
I've got your money right here.

711
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:56,283
I'll bring it to you.

712
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,725
Antoine's, across the street
from where you're standing.

713
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:02,491
AII right? I'll come to you.

714
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:04,725
Now you're talking sense, Ray-Ray.

715
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:07,268
I'll be right here, I'll be here waiting.

716
00:52:18,782 --> 00:52:20,807
- That's them.
- You got them.

717
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:25,081
Ray-Ray, you son of a bitch,
you double-crossed me again!

718
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:26,613
You're dead!

719
00:52:58,088 --> 00:53:02,286
Children, you have 20 more minutes,
then back to the bus.

720
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:23,335
Kellan Smith, right?

721
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:27,381
- Yeah.
- He's awesome.

722
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:30,246
Like, nobody here
even knows who he is.

723
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:35,351
Well, they say that song
is about his father.

724
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:37,721
Well, yeah, stepfather really...

725
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:39,362
- ...but same idea.
- Yeah.

726
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:42,495
It's Iike he writes for--

727
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,293
- I don't know.
- Outsiders.

728
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:45,594
Exactly, you know.

729
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:50,832
People with brains,
not these clones or wannabes.

730
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:54,101
Can't imagine any of Britney's songs
being inspired by Kierkegaard.

731
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:58,010
- Although, you never know.
- Yeah.

732
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:03,780
I think it's pretty cool your dad came
on this field trip.

733
00:54:04,454 --> 00:54:06,752
- Really?
- Yeah. He's not Iike most parents...

734
00:54:06,924 --> 00:54:09,415
...where they build these invisible walls
around them.

735
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:12,255
Oh, no, he's been behind walls.

736
00:54:13,497 --> 00:54:17,763
Well, you can tell he cares about you.
He just wants to spend time with you.

737
00:54:20,304 --> 00:54:24,104
I've been Iooking all over for you.
I thought we could have Iunch together?

738
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:26,936
I'm not hungry. Here, just take that.

739
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:38,445
Oh, God, sorry. It's my mother.

740
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:40,920
Take it.
She's probably just worried about you.

741
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:44,289
I'll talk to you Iater.

742
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,254
Hello?

743
00:54:48,632 --> 00:54:50,327
Sally, honey, it's me.

744
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,592
Everything going good?

745
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:54,928
Brilliant.

746
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:57,435
Yeah?

747
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:01,274
Oh, Marvin, can you turn the fan on?

748
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:03,773
Yeah. Are you Iearning anything new?

749
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:06,947
No, honey, I'm sorry, you're cutting out.

750
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:09,309
- Where is he?
- Hold on.

751
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:11,681
- What? What the hell?
- It's confusing.

752
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:14,847
- It's fine, I got it.
- Is the weather okay?

753
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:19,089
I'm sorry. It's a universal remote.

754
00:55:19,262 --> 00:55:20,923
It's supposed to do this.

755
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:25,057
- Mom, what's going on in there?
- Nothing. Just hit the off button, Marvin.

756
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:27,362
Can probably start the car
with this thing.

757
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:30,472
- Did you know that my father--?
- Honey, what?

758
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:33,269
My glasses, I can't see.

759
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:35,110
--dinosaur freak.

760
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:36,768
What? Whose father did what?

761
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:41,781
- Just turn it off!
- I got it. I got it.

762
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:45,945
- Mom, Ray is one of our chaperones.
- Look, honey, I can't hear you at all.

763
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:49,183
I'll call you back Iater.
I Iove you. I Iove you so much.

764
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,987
- Bye.
- Bye.

765
00:55:52,562 --> 00:55:54,655
I got the fan!

766
00:56:10,347 --> 00:56:13,077
But he's been in prison
the Iast seven years.

767
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,118
AII I'm saying is Ray-Ray was on the bus,
the money was on the bus.

768
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:20,654
- Like you said.
- So you're saying he planned it?

769
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,255
Ray-Ray did more than change his name
in prison.

770
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:26,885
- He became a mastermind.
- Yeah, well....

771
00:56:27,931 --> 00:56:29,364
- What a dump.
- Yeah.

772
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:33,128
If my friend can't sell it quickly,
he's gonna torch it for the insurance.

773
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:35,203
Real estate market is tough out here.

774
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,571
- Put your guns down.
- You put them down.

775
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:45,374
- No, no, you put your guns down.
- You put your guns down.

776
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:47,744
Well, you shot the Iock of my door.

777
00:56:50,654 --> 00:56:52,246
He's right.

778
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:55,853
Technically, we did shoot
the Iock off his door.

779
00:56:56,026 --> 00:56:57,425
It was a nice Iock.

780
00:56:59,496 --> 00:57:01,054
AII right.

781
00:57:06,636 --> 00:57:10,197
- Happy now, Kevin?
- It's been a while, Larue.

782
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:13,405
- What do you want?
- We need your help.

783
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:30,116
Thank you, Mr. B.

784
00:57:30,293 --> 00:57:32,921
That extra time in the French Quarter
made the day.

785
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,764
Isn't it the most fascinating place?

786
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:39,663
The food, the culture,
the history, the voodoo?

787
00:57:40,771 --> 00:57:43,239
And to think,
we'd never have had time for all that...

788
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:45,840
...if we hadn't Ieft the museum early.

789
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:48,909
I know sometimes
I get so attached to my schedule...

790
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:51,274
...I forget to Iive in the moment.

791
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:53,575
Life is Iike a raging river, Miss M.

792
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,775
You never know
what's around the next bend.

793
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:59,012
Make sure your boat doesn't Ieak
and go with the flow.

794
00:57:59,389 --> 00:58:01,619
That's good advice.

795
00:58:02,058 --> 00:58:04,618
You know,
the next time I think I'm gonna zig...

796
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:06,490
...I might just zag.

797
00:58:08,198 --> 00:58:10,598
Oh, and here's our hotel.

798
00:58:18,241 --> 00:58:20,175
Okay, everybody, Iisten up.

799
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:23,005
You have exactly two hours
inside the hotel--

800
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:25,907
And I do mean inside the hotel.

801
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:28,607
--before this evening's festivities begin.

802
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:29,945
In the meantime...

803
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,611
...your Iuggage will be taken
into the Iobby.

804
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:35,223
You will go to the front desk, register...

805
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:38,293
...get your keys,
and settle into your rooms.

806
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:41,190
If you understand, raise your hands!

807
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,197
Very good.

808
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:52,005
Sorry. Parmesan.

809
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:53,742
- Wish me Iuck.
- Good Iuck.

810
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:55,935
You're going to die
when you see the new me.

811
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:57,841
I can't believe you're gonna do this.

812
00:58:58,014 --> 00:59:00,482
Angelina's Iips
won't have anything on me.

813
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:03,483
And he'll forget all about
Iittle Miss Avril wannabe.

814
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:06,986
How far are you from
the Sheraton Hotel downtown?

815
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:10,251
Okay, I need two hours to pick up
my fireworks and get back.

816
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:13,261
AII right, guys. Come on, kids.

817
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,597
Nick, glad to have you back.

818
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:19,098
Yeah, cool. You're the coolest, Miss M.

819
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:23,104
- Hey.
- Hey.

820
00:59:23,273 --> 00:59:27,767
- So why did you take my bus, man?
- Sorry about that, buddy.

821
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:31,744
I just got this thing about doing time--
I mean, being on time.

822
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:33,883
We had plenty of time, bro.

823
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:35,946
Did we really?

824
00:59:36,286 --> 00:59:39,619
I mean, is there ever really
enough time, Nick?

825
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:41,689
I mean, honestly, what is time?

826
00:59:41,858 --> 00:59:46,454
You can't save it, you can't spend it, right?
And when it's gone, it's gone.

827
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:49,861
Know what I mean? Does time even exist,
Nick? If time doesn't exist...

828
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:52,968
...and there's just the moment,
I had to seize that moment.

829
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:55,864
- Do you know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

830
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,031
I just don't understand
how that applies to--

831
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:01,837
It doesn't apply, Nick.
That's the beauty of it.

832
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:04,606
- We're just glad you're back, man.
- Cool.

833
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:07,978
Now, can I get my green duffel bag?
I'm gonna bring it in myself.

834
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:10,745
Green duffel bag. Right. Yeah.

835
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:12,546
This it?

836
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:17,158
That's it.
Thank you very much, my friend.

837
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:18,419
Cool. We're cool?

838
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:20,887
Now is not the time.

839
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:24,062
Not that cool. Right. Okay.

840
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:53,087
- Larue, it's Ray.
- You lying...

841
01:00:53,263 --> 01:00:57,757
...dirty, Iow-Iife,
double-crossing son of a--!

842
01:00:57,934 --> 01:00:59,834
I didn't double-cross anybody, all right?

843
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:03,461
I don't know how those cops got there
or how your money got on the bus.

844
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,200
If I had a plan,
why would I wanna give your money back?

845
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:09,603
Meet me in front of the Sheraton Hotel,
I'll hand over your money.

846
01:01:09,779 --> 01:01:11,110
No way.

847
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:13,476
You know we're onto you.
You need us gone.

848
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,481
You ain't gonna manipulate me again.

849
01:01:17,587 --> 01:01:20,613
- Hold on.
- Don't put me on hold!

850
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:23,315
- He put you on hold?
- He put me on hold.

851
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:27,095
- Hey.
- Hey.

852
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:28,389
How you doing?

853
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,232
I've been giving you a hard time
about being here.

854
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:34,831
Not at all. Listen.

855
01:01:35,005 --> 01:01:37,838
If I was in your position,
I'd be doing the exact same thing.

856
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:44,378
So do you wanna get something to eat?

857
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:46,412
Yeah, that'd be great.

858
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,983
I gotta finish up
a Iittle bit of business.

859
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:51,586
Can I just meet you down in the Iobby
in two minutes?

860
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:55,350
- Okay.
- Cool. AII right.

861
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:00,629
- Continue.
- What was that all about?

862
01:02:00,797 --> 01:02:03,322
- Nothing.
- Is this another one of your tricks?

863
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,061
Listen, all I wanna do
is give you your money back.

864
01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:09,865
Good. We're gonna meet
on my turf this time, all right?

865
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,703
Warehouse Number 5.
Clayton and Mott. Near the bridge.

866
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:15,936
Fine. I'll be there in two hours.

867
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:17,340
Two hours?

868
01:02:17,514 --> 01:02:19,345
Right now, Ray-Ray.

869
01:02:19,516 --> 01:02:22,576
Listen, I've got plans.
You'll get your money.

870
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,688
What, you think he's Iegit?

871
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:28,585
No. Not for a second.

872
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:31,056
But I got other ideas.

873
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,530
- Josh, right?
- Yes, sir.

874
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:48,503
Josh, I've been out of the Ioop
for a while...

875
01:02:48,678 --> 01:02:50,942
...and you seem Iike a standup kid.

876
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:52,706
- So--
- What's up?

877
01:02:52,882 --> 01:02:56,374
Well, I really don't know what kids Iike
anymore, you know what I mean?

878
01:02:56,553 --> 01:02:58,885
- In particular, my kid.
- Sally.

879
01:02:59,155 --> 01:03:00,622
Yeah.

880
01:03:00,924 --> 01:03:05,054
I'm Iooking for something cool to do
with her today, you know, just her and I.

881
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:07,128
Satchmo Music Festival
not working out?

882
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:10,760
It's just that with the music
and all her friends, know what I mean?

883
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:13,596
- We're not gonna be able to talk.
- Well, that's true.

884
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:17,763
AII right. Well, New Orleans is a cool city,
so Iet me check online.

885
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:20,438
I think there's something she will Iike.

886
01:03:21,277 --> 01:03:24,337
Hey, and Iet's keep this
between you and me, right?

887
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:27,278
- Nobody else's business, right?
- You got it.

888
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:32,812
You know what I think is interesting?
That we both ate...

889
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:36,652
...the same part of the croissant.
Don't you think that's interesting?

890
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:42,622
Yes. I usually Iike jelly
with my croissant...

891
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,892
- Oh, sure.
- ...instead of butter.

892
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:46,763
- Or butter sometimes too.
- Yeah.

893
01:03:46,936 --> 01:03:49,996
Excuse me.
Miss M, I kind of got a favor to ask.

894
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:52,004
Sure. Anything, Mr. B.

895
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:57,545
Well, Sally and I haven't had too much
time together Iately because of my work.

896
01:03:57,714 --> 01:04:01,878
I was wondering if it would be possible
for us to maybe zig instead of zag.

897
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:04,117
Maybe blow off the music festival...

898
01:04:04,287 --> 01:04:06,983
...and she and I could spend
some one-on-one time together?

899
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:11,822
Why not? After all, you are a chaperone.

900
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:14,327
So she'll be in very good hands.

901
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:18,865
- Thanks, Miss M. You're the best.
- Thanks.

902
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:22,133
Hey, hey, hey. I did what you said.

903
01:04:22,305 --> 01:04:24,739
You know,
every time she stopped talking...

904
01:04:24,908 --> 01:04:29,004
...I counted, you know, in my head,
of course, the two and a half.

905
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:30,806
Boy, did she take me in.

906
01:04:32,182 --> 01:04:33,547
You changed my Iife.

907
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:37,949
I'm not a big hugger, all right?

908
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:40,749
Okay. You know,
you can play that, you know...

909
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:45,293
...big, strong, Iean, handsome
in that rugged kind of way...

910
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:48,953
...devil-may-care man's man
all you want, Mr. Bradstone.

911
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:53,535
But you have a tender side
that can't be denied, my friend.

912
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,070
Come on. Come.

913
01:04:58,508 --> 01:05:02,035
- That had better be your fanny pack.
- Yeah.

914
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:17,387
First thing I ever bought your mom was
one of those antique hurricane Iamps.

915
01:05:18,361 --> 01:05:21,353
And I was never really
the romantic type, you know?

916
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:24,659
Matter of fact, I don't think
I actually knew what the word meant.

917
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:28,463
Until one night,
I was a bartender at this restaurant...

918
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:30,037
...in walks your mom.

919
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:32,504
She's gonna have dinner
with some Ioser, right?

920
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:35,940
Anyway, on the table,
we had one of those hurricane Iamps...

921
01:05:36,112 --> 01:05:39,275
...which, by the way,
are a terrible pain to Iight.

922
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:42,680
Anyway, the Iight from that Iamp
on your mother's face...

923
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:46,049
...God, it was just magical, you know?

924
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:48,952
Right then, I knew what romance was.

925
01:05:50,326 --> 01:05:54,456
Why...? Why do you think
she married you?

926
01:05:55,098 --> 01:05:57,191
She said I made her Iaugh.

927
01:05:59,402 --> 01:06:00,869
This is it.

928
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:03,595
- Music Factory?
- Yeah. Come on.

929
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:06,136
Thank you.

930
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:14,843
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

931
01:06:15,018 --> 01:06:19,648
You got anything cool on vinyl
Iike Sinatra, Zeppelin, Kellan Smith?

932
01:06:19,822 --> 01:06:21,585
Dude, eclectic taste.

933
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:26,024
Sinatra, Zeppelin, Smith. Trifecta.

934
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:28,220
I tip my hat. Come this way.

935
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:29,831
Kellan Smith.

936
01:06:29,999 --> 01:06:32,593
- Yeah, you know him?
- I Iove him.

937
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:34,566
Really? I heard he was really good...

938
01:06:34,737 --> 01:06:36,932
...but I wasn't sure.
Thought I'd check him out.

939
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:43,011
Who you Iooking for?

940
01:06:43,646 --> 01:06:46,479
Chairman of the Board, Frank Sinatra.

941
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:49,516
- He's a Iittle bit before your time.
- Definitely.

942
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:53,552
- He's a Iittle bit before my time too.
- Okay.

943
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:56,283
So I started reading up on this guy
when I was inside.

944
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:59,292
And it turns out,
we got a Iot in common, you know?

945
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:02,956
We both hit rock bottom.
He was sick and he was broke...

946
01:07:03,132 --> 01:07:05,999
...and borrowing money
from this actress chick, Ava Gardner...

947
01:07:06,169 --> 01:07:10,230
- ...who was huge at the time.
- You're really into this guy.

948
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:13,037
Well, we both turned our Iives around,
you know?

949
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:15,643
And Frank's music gave me hope.

950
01:07:15,812 --> 01:07:18,975
Hope Iike I hadn't had
since you were born.

951
01:07:34,497 --> 01:07:36,829
Nothing? Sorry.

952
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:44,068
- Why'd you do it?
- What?

953
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:46,305
Leave us.

954
01:07:53,116 --> 01:07:57,052
I made a Iot of mistakes in my Iife.
I grew up with a Iot of the wrong people.

955
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:00,712
I was trying to find an easy way
to give you and your mom the things...

956
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:04,417
...that I thought you deserved.
I didn't wanna get caught.

957
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:07,829
How come the first five years
you were away...

958
01:08:07,997 --> 01:08:09,965
...you didn't write me a single Ietter?

959
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,138
I thought you were better off
without me.

960
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:17,838
You know, and....

961
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:21,199
But then I started Iistening to Frank
and Dr. Marjorie.

962
01:08:21,377 --> 01:08:25,074
And I started making up for Iost time.

963
01:08:25,248 --> 01:08:26,442
Yeah.

964
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:29,050
I got those Ietters a Iittle Iate,
don't you think?

965
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:31,510
It's never too Iate.

966
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:33,311
You gotta have faith in people.

967
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:35,181
Faith?

968
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:38,922
Do you have any idea what our Iives
were Iike after you went away?

969
01:08:41,097 --> 01:08:42,462
Mom cried for months.

970
01:08:42,632 --> 01:08:45,430
For months?
Your mom cried for months?

971
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:46,863
Yeah.

972
01:08:47,637 --> 01:08:50,868
And school.
Try explaining to your friends...

973
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,304
...why your dad can't come
to your soccer games...

974
01:08:53,476 --> 01:08:55,808
...or show up for parent night
Iike the other dads.

975
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:57,309
Because he's in jail.

976
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:04,748
I know I've hurt you bad...

977
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:08,022
...and "sorry" doesn't cut it...

978
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:13,258
...but everything that I Iearned, everything,
was to find my way back to you.

979
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:25,798
This is Iovely.

980
01:09:25,975 --> 01:09:28,034
- The tea is Iovely.
- And so is the company.

981
01:09:28,211 --> 01:09:29,303
Miss Miller?

982
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:30,946
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

983
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:33,445
We're with
the Lafayette Police Department.

984
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:35,015
Do you know this man?

985
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:38,352
Yes. He's one of our chaperones.

986
01:09:38,521 --> 01:09:40,045
Has he done something?

987
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:43,152
Just got out of prison.
He's a suspect in a bank robbery.

988
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:45,294
Your class is in danger.
Know where he is?

989
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:47,151
No.

990
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:48,828
No.

991
01:09:50,299 --> 01:09:52,290
Yes. Yes.

992
01:09:52,468 --> 01:09:54,993
He's out in New Orleans somewhere
with his daughter...

993
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:57,002
...probably maybe robbing a bank.

994
01:09:57,173 --> 01:09:58,834
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, okay.

995
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:00,066
Remain calm.

996
01:10:00,243 --> 01:10:02,803
Gather the kids and Iet's gather up
over here. Let's go.

997
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:05,610
You know something, Ray....

998
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:09,774
Sally, you don't have to
call me Ray, okay?

999
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,755
Mr. Bradstone seems kind of odd,
don't you think?

1000
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:18,084
Okay. I guess Ray is a step
in the right direction.

1001
01:10:18,394 --> 01:10:20,362
You know something, Ray...

1002
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,491
...I had a good time today.

1003
01:10:22,665 --> 01:10:24,098
Yeah?

1004
01:10:24,567 --> 01:10:26,091
Me too.

1005
01:10:26,536 --> 01:10:29,994
You should be with your friends.
I'm sure Josh is Iooking for you too.

1006
01:10:30,172 --> 01:10:31,366
Josh?

1007
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:33,073
He's a good kid. I Iike him.

1008
01:10:33,242 --> 01:10:35,403
And he Iikes you too.
I see it in his eyes.

1009
01:10:37,113 --> 01:10:38,410
What are you going to do?

1010
01:10:39,315 --> 01:10:42,546
Take a walk down by the river,
enjoy the fresh air.

1011
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:43,944
You go have fun.

1012
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,171
And now some breaking news.

1013
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:09,436
Ray, alias "Ray-Ray,"Bradstone,
recently released...

1014
01:11:09,612 --> 01:11:12,911
...after serving seven years
in federal prison for bank robbery...

1015
01:11:13,082 --> 01:11:16,643

1017
01:11:20,222 --> 01:11:24,488
...Meyer "Goldy" Stentz,
and Theodore "Del"Muniz.

1018
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:56,484
You're Iate. Come here. Go.
You stand right here.

1019
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,657
Okay. When I give you the signal,
you start playing.

1020
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,161
- Okay?
- Okay.

1021
01:12:05,134 --> 01:12:07,432
Honey? You ready?

1022
01:12:07,603 --> 01:12:09,798
- In a second.
- Okay.

1023
01:12:10,206 --> 01:12:13,437
--Meyer "Goldy" Stintz,
and Theodore "Del"Muniz.

1024
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:17,067
The fourth suspect, Ray-Ray Bradstone,
is believed to be in New Orleans...

1025
01:12:17,246 --> 01:12:19,840
...after hijacking
a Redwood Junior High School bus...

1026
01:12:20,016 --> 01:12:21,950
...on its way to a field trip.

1027
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:29,851
Lynne?

1028
01:12:30,192 --> 01:12:31,989
Dinner's ready.

1029
01:12:32,161 --> 01:12:33,856
Ready, ready.

1030
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:37,295
- Marvin, I'm Ieaving!
- What?

1031
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:42,865
I get to spend some time with my
Iittle girl today. Good time.

1032
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:45,200
Oh, I'm so happy for you, Ray.

1033
01:12:45,374 --> 01:12:47,638
Everything is just working out
Iike you said.

1034
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:51,439
- You changed my Iife.
- Oh, we change our own Iives, Ray.

1035
01:12:51,614 --> 01:12:53,013
You did that yourself.

1036
01:12:53,516 --> 01:12:55,211
Just stuck to the three essentials.

1037
01:12:55,384 --> 01:12:59,013
Confronted it, told the truth,
she's Ietting it go.

1038
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:01,452
She's Ietting it go? What about you?

1039
01:13:01,624 --> 01:13:02,852
I don't understand.

1040
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:05,619
Hey! Ray-Ray!

1041
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:08,256
Looks Iike she misses me already.

1042
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:09,898
Thanks for everything. Bye.

1043
01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:11,397
Hi.
- Oh, Iook.

1044
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:14,263
- It's Ray Bradstone, still at Iarge.
- What?

1045
01:13:14,904 --> 01:13:16,929
Just quoting the evening news.

1046
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,671
So glad we got to spend
some quality time together, Ray-Ray.

1047
01:13:21,844 --> 01:13:24,369
Guess I'll see you
in another seven years.

1048
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:27,345
Sally, I swear,
I had nothing to do with robbing that bank.

1049
01:13:27,516 --> 01:13:30,679
Really? So they just flashed your mug shot
on national TV...

1050
01:13:30,853 --> 01:13:33,413
- ...for your adorable smile?
- I was on the bus with you.

1051
01:13:33,589 --> 01:13:37,184
And your fingerprints happened to be
on the keys to the getaway car? Really?

1052
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:41,589
You are what you always were,
a Iying criminal.

1053
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:43,558
- Don't say that word.
- Which one?

1054
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:45,792
Liar or criminal?

1055
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:47,333
I said it again.

1056
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:49,903
Sally, I swear to you
I didn't rob that bank.

1057
01:13:50,072 --> 01:13:52,597
I mean, I was there
and I was in the car, but I swear--

1058
01:13:52,775 --> 01:13:53,799
I knew it.

1059
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:58,137
I knew something was wrong
the moment you got on the bus.

1060
01:13:58,314 --> 01:13:59,611
I'm an idiot.

1061
01:13:59,782 --> 01:14:02,717
I actually believed you had changed.

1062
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:06,686
Sally, wait.

1063
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:08,915
You're not an idiot
and I have changed.

1064
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:13,885
Okay. I know I've Iet you
and your mom down in the past...

1065
01:14:14,363 --> 01:14:19,198
...but I spent the Iast seven years of my Iife
trying to figure out how to change that.

1066
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:22,596
I don't ever wanna be
away from you again.

1067
01:14:23,806 --> 01:14:27,105
I just need some time to figure out
how to make this right.

1068
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:30,803
Please.

1069
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,373
How are we supposed to get out?

1070
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:38,952
Simple. Return the money,
Iet them take the heat for it.

1071
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,281
What is it?

1072
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,985
I take it back, nothing is ever simple.

1073
01:14:47,163 --> 01:14:48,687
Those guys are cops.

1074
01:14:49,498 --> 01:14:50,965
Sally...

1075
01:14:51,233 --> 01:14:54,532
...I need you to do me a favor, okay?
I've got nobody else.

1076
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:56,531
Please.

1077
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,372
What do you want me to do?

1078
01:15:00,543 --> 01:15:03,637
I need you to go to my room,
bring me the green duffel bag.

1079
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:05,479
Okay?

1080
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:09,442
Be careful.

1081
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:33,541
Nick, what's going on?
Where is everybody?

1082
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:36,473
Lockdown, maximum security,
extreme duress.

1083
01:15:36,645 --> 01:15:38,840
Miss M is in, Iike, cardiac à Ia mode.

1084
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:41,983
Why? Why are we Ieaving?
We can't Ieave yet.

1085
01:15:42,418 --> 01:15:44,682
You tell me. My dad's a plumber.

1086
01:15:47,156 --> 01:15:50,319
Oh, no, no, no. I want that bag with me.

1087
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:57,457
Hey.

1088
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:01,462
They're putting the class in Iockdown
and we're Ieaving.

1089
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:04,629
I have to go back or they'll miss me
and that's not good for you.

1090
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:08,038
Listen, I'll get rid of the money,
I'll turn myself in.

1091
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:10,178
But they'll arrest you.

1092
01:16:10,379 --> 01:16:12,347
Sally, Iisten.

1093
01:16:12,514 --> 01:16:16,143
Something Dr. Marjorie said to me
about Ietting go.

1094
01:16:16,552 --> 01:16:20,511
Coming back here, forcing you
into something you didn't want...

1095
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:22,614
...it was wrong.

1096
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,281
What do you mean?

1097
01:16:26,195 --> 01:16:29,187
I was thinking about my best interests,
not yours.

1098
01:16:29,365 --> 01:16:32,892
The Iast thing I ever wanted to do
was put you in harm's way.

1099
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:36,267
Thank you.

1100
01:16:37,673 --> 01:16:39,231
You're welcome.

1101
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:50,748
- What are you doing?
- Shut up, stupid. Get in there.

1102
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,945
Get off me! No!

1103
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:57,887
You make a sound
or Iook at me cross-eyed...

1104
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,688
...I'll shoot your old man
and shoot you in front of him.

1105
01:17:00,863 --> 01:17:02,296
That makes no sense.

1106
01:17:04,633 --> 01:17:06,931
- Sure, it does.
- No, it doesn't, moron.

1107
01:17:07,136 --> 01:17:10,970
What good would it do to shoot her
in front of him if he's already dead?

1108
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,702
Okay, I might just shoot her now,
you Iike that?

1109
01:17:13,876 --> 01:17:15,901
Is that a better plan?
You Iike that better?

1110
01:17:16,078 --> 01:17:19,013
Then we'll have nothing to bargain
with Ray-Ray for the money.

1111
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:21,581
- I'm guessing you're the Ieader.
- Right, sweetheart.

1112
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,081
Process of elimination.

1113
01:17:23,252 --> 01:17:25,049
I Iearned about it in statistics.

1114
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,245
And it's Ray, okay?

1115
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:30,586
Just once. Ray.

1116
01:17:35,698 --> 01:17:37,029
You Ray-Ray Bradstone?

1117
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:39,896
Ray Bradstone, yeah.

1118
01:17:40,069 --> 01:17:41,661
Come on in, brother.

1119
01:17:46,742 --> 01:17:49,176
My friend Larue says you're a bad man.

1120
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:50,676
Not to underestimate you.

1121
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,339
So I brought my friends.

1122
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:55,676
Listen, guys...

1123
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:58,149
...I just wanna give you back
your money.

1124
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:40,658
Looks Iike it's just me and you.

1125
01:18:50,205 --> 01:18:51,229
Hello?

1126
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:53,967
- Ray-Ray?
- It's just Ray, moron.

1127
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:55,701
- You set me up?
- Better than that.

1128
01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:59,336
I figured even if you managed
to get past the welcoming committee...

1129
01:18:59,515 --> 01:19:02,712
...I'd still need a backup plan.
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.

1130
01:19:02,885 --> 01:19:04,409
- Say hello.
- Daddy?

1131
01:19:04,586 --> 01:19:06,577
Sally? Oh, my God, okay.

1132
01:19:06,755 --> 01:19:08,382
Sally, Iisten, I will come for you.

1133
01:19:08,557 --> 01:19:09,683
Okay? You will be fine.

1134
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:11,621
- Do you hear me?
- Daddy, please--

1135
01:19:13,362 --> 01:19:15,626
I can't believe how she's grown
into such a woman.

1136
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:19,092
- I will kill you twice if you touch her.
- Okay, good.

1137
01:19:19,268 --> 01:19:23,364
So I can assume you're still in possession
of my money since you're not dead yet.

1138
01:19:23,539 --> 01:19:27,669
Larue, you are exactly
as stupid as I thought you were.

1139
01:19:27,843 --> 01:19:30,334
AII I wanna do is give you back
your damn money...

1140
01:19:30,512 --> 01:19:33,037
...and instead you kidnap my daughter,
you mo--

1141
01:19:34,783 --> 01:19:36,808
Hold on, Just Plain Ray.

1142
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:39,215
Not in front of the kiddies.

1143
01:19:40,289 --> 01:19:44,885
Now, Iisten, I don't trust you
as far as I can spit you.

1144
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,154
Okay? So here's how
we're gonna do this.

1145
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,355
Tracy. Meredith?

1146
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:52,397
Hey, how'd it go?

1147
01:19:57,639 --> 01:19:59,470
Ted, there you are.
Where have you been?

1148
01:19:59,641 --> 01:20:01,836
- Am I in trouble?
- No, no.

1149
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:04,342
It's just, some unexpected things
have happened...

1150
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:07,641
...so now we're all waiting in there.

1151
01:20:09,384 --> 01:20:12,911
You think I'm gonna Iose my job because
I Iet a bank robber be a chaperone?

1152
01:20:13,088 --> 01:20:16,080
Of course not. It not your fault.
Everything's fine.

1153
01:20:17,259 --> 01:20:19,386
- Everything's fine.
- Miss Miller.

1154
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:20,858
I can't find Sally anywhere.

1155
01:20:22,464 --> 01:20:24,261
Well, not to worry.

1156
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:27,300
I'm sure she'll be right along.

1157
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:30,933
Now I've Iost a child.

1158
01:20:31,106 --> 01:20:35,202
And do you think that would be
a good thing? No. No. No.

1159
01:20:56,465 --> 01:20:58,228
You have any questions?

1160
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,731
I got it.

1161
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:05,340
Listen, my daughter's Iife
is in your hands, all right?

1162
01:21:05,507 --> 01:21:10,535
This is all the money I have in this world
and you're the only person I can trust.

1163
01:21:10,779 --> 01:21:12,246
- We good?
- Sure.

1164
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:14,939
- No cops.
- Sure.

1165
01:21:20,189 --> 01:21:21,315
Hey, buddy.

1166
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:24,224
Little Sally here's been chatting up
a storm.

1167
01:21:24,393 --> 01:21:26,190
I can't wait to get rid of her.

1168
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:27,922
Good.

1169
01:21:28,096 --> 01:21:30,860
Put her in the cab
and you'll get your money.

1170
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,324
Where is it?

1171
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:33,695
I'm your insurance.

1172
01:21:33,869 --> 01:21:37,430
Just Iet her get in the cab,
money will appear Iike magic.

1173
01:21:40,676 --> 01:21:41,938
Put her in the cab.

1174
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:43,737
My pleasure.

1175
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:45,103
Get in there.

1176
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,475
Smell you Iater, kid.

1177
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:58,585
Stop the cab.

1178
01:21:59,261 --> 01:22:00,592
Stop the cab.

1179
01:22:00,762 --> 01:22:02,787
Stop the cab.

1180
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:04,694
Something's wrong, stop the cab.

1181
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:06,834
Your father said no.

1182
01:22:07,002 --> 01:22:10,096
Stop the cab! Stop the cab!
Stop the cab!

1183
01:22:10,272 --> 01:22:12,137
It's the wrong bag!

1184
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:15,401
You're scary, kid, but you're
not as half as scary as your dad.

1185
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,713
I have never had so much trouble
giving somebody money.

1186
01:22:21,883 --> 01:22:25,148
I'd shoot you now,
but I need that money.

1187
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:27,554
Listen, this is an honest mistake.

1188
01:22:27,723 --> 01:22:29,714
I'm sure somehow
the bags just got switched.

1189
01:22:29,891 --> 01:22:33,156
It's probably on the bus. Not a big deal.
This doesn't have to go bad.

1190
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:36,661
- You just Iet me shoot him right now.
- Shut up.

1191
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:41,067
You worked it with Del and now you got
something going on with that kid.

1192
01:22:41,236 --> 01:22:42,703
Chip off the old block.

1193
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:45,032
Listen, you don't get it, Larue.

1194
01:22:45,207 --> 01:22:49,769
That part of me, the guy that would
have stolen your money, the criminal...

1195
01:22:49,945 --> 01:22:51,344
...is gone. I got rid of him.

1196
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:53,606
You guys can too.

1197
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:56,580
You know, I'm not saying it's easy.

1198
01:22:57,753 --> 01:22:59,721
But Dr. Marjorie...

1199
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:03,753
...she really helped me give birth
to my new self.

1200
01:23:03,925 --> 01:23:07,292
There's some great mental exercises
in the back of this book that--

1201
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:09,524
You know, or maybe not.

1202
01:23:15,404 --> 01:23:17,065
Sally Bradstone?

1203
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:20,106
I'm Officer Fuentes.
This is my partner, Augie Donaldson.

1204
01:23:20,275 --> 01:23:21,299
Where's your father?

1205
01:23:21,843 --> 01:23:23,105
No idea.

1206
01:23:23,278 --> 01:23:27,544
Listen, Sally, the best way to help
your father is just to tell us where he is.

1207
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:29,845
He didn't do anything.

1208
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:32,009
He wasn't a part of that robbery.

1209
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:34,485
He's our chaperone.
He was on our bus.

1210
01:23:34,656 --> 01:23:36,180
Yeah, then why's he running?

1211
01:23:36,358 --> 01:23:39,589
And if that isn't true, concealing
a criminal's whereabouts is felony.

1212
01:23:39,928 --> 01:23:40,986
I don't know.

1213
01:23:41,163 --> 01:23:43,825
He walked me back to the hotel
then Ieft.

1214
01:23:44,533 --> 01:23:47,468
I don't know where he is. Honest.

1215
01:23:50,806 --> 01:23:53,331
AII right, I want you
with the rest the class...

1216
01:23:53,508 --> 01:23:55,408
...until this is resolved, understand?

1217
01:23:55,844 --> 01:23:58,438
Well, I'm so glad
that you're safe and sound.

1218
01:23:58,613 --> 01:24:00,308
Yeah, thanks.

1219
01:24:03,118 --> 01:24:05,086
- Hey.
- Hey.

1220
01:24:05,787 --> 01:24:09,223
Listen, this thing with your dad
must be kind of weird for you.

1221
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:12,189
He's innocent.
He's just trying to straighten things out.

1222
01:24:12,361 --> 01:24:14,693
Yeah, he's a good guy. I can tell.

1223
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:16,354
Yeah.

1224
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,160
- You've got an iPhone, right?
- Yeah.

1225
01:24:21,336 --> 01:24:24,601
- Have that app that tracks any iPhone?
- Yeah.

1226
01:24:24,906 --> 01:24:26,134
I need your help.

1227
01:24:26,308 --> 01:24:27,332
I gotta find my dad.

1228
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:33,242
If you guys are planning an escape op,
I'll be able to help.

1229
01:24:33,415 --> 01:24:35,042
Me too.

1230
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:37,077
I wrote a paper Iast year called...

1231
01:24:37,252 --> 01:24:40,119
..."The Triangulation in
the Cell Phone Jungle for Dummies"...

1232
01:24:40,288 --> 01:24:41,880
...and sent it to the CIA.

1233
01:24:42,057 --> 01:24:44,150
- Did they read it?
- Yeah, but dismissed it...

1234
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:48,319
...saying that it was the fantasies
of an overimaginative 13-year-old.

1235
01:24:48,497 --> 01:24:50,294
My dad says the same thing to me.

1236
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:56,370
The point is, if you need something,
or someone, found, I'm your man.

1237
01:24:56,538 --> 01:24:57,630
Go for it.

1238
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:03,974
When was the Iast time
your father used his phone?

1239
01:25:05,213 --> 01:25:06,771
About 30 minutes ago.

1240
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:11,578
- I'm assuming a Lafayette area code.
- Yes.

1241
01:25:11,753 --> 01:25:14,085
- Where?
- The Riverwalk.

1242
01:25:17,926 --> 01:25:21,418
- Got it.
- Wow, you're kind of scary.

1243
01:25:21,596 --> 01:25:22,620
Thanks.

1244
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:24,421
Okay, okay. You're in.

1245
01:25:25,634 --> 01:25:28,762
Here's what I was thinking.
We have to distract Miss Miller, okay?

1246
01:25:31,973 --> 01:25:33,600
I have to go to the bathroom.

1247
01:25:35,744 --> 01:25:39,578
AII right. It's right down the hall.
Don't be Iong.

1248
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:06,635
Somebody has a gun in the bathroom!

1249
01:26:16,485 --> 01:26:19,010
Oh, no, he's mine.

1250
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:37,003
Nick, open the door.

1251
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:40,537
Nick, Miss Miller is in trouble.
She needs you inside.

1252
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:42,074
- Me?
- Yes.

1253
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:44,644
Really? Cool.

1254
01:26:51,319 --> 01:26:52,786
- Let's go.
- AII right, come on.

1255
01:26:52,954 --> 01:26:54,353
- Close the door.
- Okay, what--?

1256
01:26:54,523 --> 01:26:55,649
Hit any button.

1257
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:57,724
- Which button?
- Hit any button. That one.

1258
01:26:59,327 --> 01:27:03,263
- Sit down and hang on. I can do this.
- You don't even know how to drive a car.

1259
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:17,906
Who's driving the bus?

1260
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:19,808
Sally.

1261
01:27:21,182 --> 01:27:24,083
Remember what I said
about you not being fired?

1262
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:25,845
You're toast.

1263
01:27:29,224 --> 01:27:33,217
This is kidnapping. Endangering the Iife
of a minor. I'm calling my Iawyer.

1264
01:27:33,395 --> 01:27:35,522
Holy crap. What happened to your Iips?

1265
01:27:35,697 --> 01:27:38,063
They're supposed to Iook
Iike Jessica Simpson's.

1266
01:27:38,233 --> 01:27:40,565
Look Iike you tried to suck honey
out of a beehive.

1267
01:27:40,735 --> 01:27:42,032
- Keep going straight.
- Okay.

1268
01:27:42,203 --> 01:27:43,864
- I'm calling the cops.
- Red Iight.

1269
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:46,770
Red Iight. Red Iight.

1270
01:27:54,783 --> 01:27:57,581
Yeah! This day just keeps
getting better.

1271
01:28:01,323 --> 01:28:03,188
Where is it?

1272
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:07,222
I told you, it's probably on the bus.

1273
01:28:09,931 --> 01:28:11,489
Don't do that.

1274
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:13,657
Don't insult my intelligence.

1275
01:28:15,737 --> 01:28:18,467
I've got 26 witnesses
that will swear I was on that bus...

1276
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:21,074
...before the robbery even went down.

1277
01:28:21,242 --> 01:28:23,301
How do I know that's not the plan
with Del?

1278
01:28:23,478 --> 01:28:26,345
With Del?
I didn't even know Del before the robbery.

1279
01:28:26,982 --> 01:28:28,415
I Ieft to be with my daughter.

1280
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,313
Oh, so now you're Father of the Year.

1281
01:28:31,519 --> 01:28:34,147
You don't know that kid
any more than you know Del.

1282
01:28:40,061 --> 01:28:44,998
"Anger dwells
only in the bosom of fools."

1283
01:28:47,502 --> 01:28:49,265
Einstein.

1284
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,166
"A bullet that dwells in the brain...

1285
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:56,443
...Ieaves much pain."

1286
01:28:56,611 --> 01:28:58,010
"Leaves much pain."

1287
01:28:58,513 --> 01:28:59,639
Larue.

1288
01:29:05,887 --> 01:29:07,354
This is it.

1289
01:29:08,189 --> 01:29:09,816
Pull in here.

1290
01:29:09,991 --> 01:29:11,959
- Hold on.
- Cool.

1291
01:29:25,473 --> 01:29:27,703
Now Iisten to me, everybody.

1292
01:29:27,876 --> 01:29:30,777
I've spent just enough time
with my father today to realize...

1293
01:29:30,945 --> 01:29:32,879
...he's not the man I thought he was.

1294
01:29:33,048 --> 01:29:35,676
He's made some mistakes,
but he's a good man.

1295
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:37,181
At Ieast he's trying to be.

1296
01:29:37,352 --> 01:29:40,082
Now he's in there,
and I'm going to get him out.

1297
01:29:40,255 --> 01:29:45,420
But, guys, I need help.
I mean, what if it was your dad in there?

1298
01:29:45,593 --> 01:29:48,756
I wouldn't get off this bus
if my entire family was in that place.

1299
01:29:49,664 --> 01:29:52,189
- So, what's the plan?
- Plan?

1300
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:55,395
A plan? Yes.

1301
01:29:56,037 --> 01:29:59,063
"AII men can see these tactics
whereby I conquer...

1302
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:03,836
...but what none can see is the strategy
out of which victory is evolved."

1303
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:06,838
Sun Tzu, my friends.

1304
01:30:07,015 --> 01:30:10,280
Let's not just do this,
Iet's step up to this.

1305
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:11,441
Yeah.

1306
01:30:18,093 --> 01:30:19,583
Come on.

1307
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:23,458
Quiet. Not so Ioud.

1308
01:30:33,508 --> 01:30:34,975
Guys.

1309
01:30:35,877 --> 01:30:37,469
Open it.

1310
01:30:40,915 --> 01:30:42,382
Okay.

1311
01:30:43,785 --> 01:30:47,482
You guys go that way, we'll go this way.
Signal us when you're ready. Got it?

1312
01:30:47,655 --> 01:30:49,350
Roger that.

1313
01:30:49,891 --> 01:30:51,654
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1314
01:30:53,995 --> 01:30:55,963
We gotta be careful.

1315
01:30:57,699 --> 01:30:59,428
This is scary.

1316
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:10,608
For the Iast time...

1317
01:31:11,613 --> 01:31:13,774
...where's that money?

1318
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:18,342
On the bus.

1319
01:31:22,757 --> 01:31:24,088
Maybe he's telling the truth.

1320
01:31:25,727 --> 01:31:28,127
I'm telling you, he's full of crap.

1321
01:31:28,296 --> 01:31:32,027
It's his mastermind brain
that's trying to trick us again.

1322
01:31:35,937 --> 01:31:37,029
The eagle has Ianded.

1323
01:31:37,505 --> 01:31:39,564
I repeat, the eagle has landed.

1324
01:31:39,741 --> 01:31:42,107
Okay, guys, you know what to do.

1325
01:31:48,183 --> 01:31:49,480
Go.

1326
01:31:58,059 --> 01:31:59,924
Police department,
state your emergency.

1327
01:32:00,094 --> 01:32:03,552
Finally. My emergency
is that I'm on the field trip from hell.

1328
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:06,393
I'm having trouble understanding
what you're saying.

1329
01:32:06,568 --> 01:32:08,399
- Are you in immediate danger?
- Yes.

1330
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:11,801
First of all, I think my Iips
may actually explode.

1331
01:32:14,909 --> 01:32:17,400
AII right. You go in that way.
I'm going this way.

1332
01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:25,583
My God, I'm gonna make a hideous
dead person. Please help me.

1333
01:32:34,829 --> 01:32:36,319
Okay, all right.

1334
01:32:44,372 --> 01:32:46,772
You're going down.

1335
01:32:51,713 --> 01:32:52,873
Now!

1336
01:33:06,861 --> 01:33:10,126
- Let it go and move on.
- The Dr. Marjorie Show. Hello?

1337
01:33:11,466 --> 01:33:15,061
What are you doing? Get up, man.

1338
01:33:23,044 --> 01:33:25,740
- What is this?
- Rotten kids.

1339
01:33:27,248 --> 01:33:29,648
Caller? Hello? Hello?
Can you hear me?

1340
01:33:30,018 --> 01:33:31,383
- Dad.
- Mr. Bradstone.

1341
01:33:31,552 --> 01:33:33,713
- Untie me.
- I got it.

1342
01:33:33,888 --> 01:33:35,150
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1343
01:33:35,323 --> 01:33:36,984
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

1344
01:33:39,627 --> 01:33:42,721
- Where you going?
- Don't shoot. I have the money.

1345
01:33:42,897 --> 01:33:45,764
- Yeah? Well, Iet's see it.
- It's right here.

1346
01:33:47,302 --> 01:33:48,394
AII right.

1347
01:33:51,572 --> 01:33:53,062
Looks Iike it's all there.

1348
01:33:53,241 --> 01:33:55,675
Let's see if I get this straight.
He has taken--

1349
01:33:55,843 --> 01:33:58,038
You gotta hear this.
I think it's Ray Bradstone.

1350
01:33:58,212 --> 01:34:00,146
Caller, hold for one minute, please.

1351
01:34:01,115 --> 01:34:05,245
- Your kid's smarter than you, Ray-Ray.
- It's Ray. Plain Ray.

1352
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,649
Now Iet us go. You have your money.

1353
01:34:07,822 --> 01:34:09,312
Oh, not so fast.

1354
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:13,124
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think we have a very unusual call.

1355
01:34:13,294 --> 01:34:16,127
It appears we have a crime in progress.

1356
01:34:16,297 --> 01:34:17,628
Now, we have alerted 911.

1357
01:34:17,799 --> 01:34:21,291
- We have called....
- AII units in the vicinity of 1626 Mott...

1358
01:34:21,469 --> 01:34:24,029
...possible shots fired,
suspicious activity.

1359
01:34:24,205 --> 01:34:26,070
- Proceed with extreme caution.
- Let's go.

1360
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,105
--and see what we hear.

1361
01:34:30,044 --> 01:34:32,274
Ray wasn't part of that robbery,
was he?

1362
01:34:32,447 --> 01:34:33,539
No.

1363
01:34:33,715 --> 01:34:37,674
That doesn't mean he didn't set it up
to rip us off for sending him to prison.

1364
01:34:38,019 --> 01:34:40,283
You are the reason
my dad went to jail?

1365
01:34:40,455 --> 01:34:43,356
No, Sally, that's on me.

1366
01:34:43,524 --> 01:34:47,051
- They just Iet me take the fall alone.
- My dad's innocent.

1367
01:34:47,228 --> 01:34:49,162
AII he wants is to be a father again.

1368
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:51,355
Oh, yeah?

1369
01:34:51,766 --> 01:34:54,098
That really brings a tear to my eye.

1370
01:34:54,268 --> 01:34:55,530
- You're dead.
- No!

1371
01:35:02,577 --> 01:35:06,069
- Bye-bye, Ray-Ray.
- Nobody move! Drop your weapon!

1372
01:35:06,581 --> 01:35:08,139
Drop it!

1373
01:35:10,918 --> 01:35:12,681
- Cuff him.
- AII right, Iet's go.

1374
01:35:14,155 --> 01:35:16,316
Don't move. Hands behind your back.
Let's go.

1375
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:20,120
- Bye-bye, Larue.
- You got Iucky this time, Ray.

1376
01:35:20,294 --> 01:35:21,488
Move out, move out.

1377
01:35:28,236 --> 01:35:32,400
Well, Iadies and gentlemen,
I think that's a first for me.

1378
01:35:32,573 --> 01:35:34,973
And maybe all of radio.

1379
01:35:35,743 --> 01:35:42,444
We just heard the apprehension
of criminals broadcast Iive on 91 .6 FM...

1380
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:44,642
...The Dr. Marjorie Show.

1381
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:49,722
And looks like our caller, well,
he got everything he hoped for.

1382
01:35:57,832 --> 01:36:00,426
- Hey, hold on a second. Ray Bradstone?
- Yeah.

1383
01:36:00,601 --> 01:36:03,502
You're under arrest for the robbery
of Lafayette National Bank.

1384
01:36:03,671 --> 01:36:05,832
- But he's innocent.
- Step back. Police matter.

1385
01:36:06,007 --> 01:36:08,737
- I witnessed it.
- Hey, you can take him off.

1386
01:36:09,343 --> 01:36:10,810
Wait. Hold on. What?

1387
01:36:11,112 --> 01:36:13,672
Apparently, the whole thing
just went down Iive on WKNO.

1388
01:36:13,848 --> 01:36:16,316
May even give Larue a radio show
from the slammer.

1389
01:36:16,884 --> 01:36:19,079
He confessed to the whole thing.

1390
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:21,945
- Sorry about this, Ray.
- Thanks.

1391
01:36:22,123 --> 01:36:25,251
It turns out you were right to believe him.
He did keep his promise.

1392
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:28,128
He did.

1393
01:36:28,296 --> 01:36:29,729
I appreciate it.

1394
01:36:30,565 --> 01:36:32,192
Sally.

1395
01:36:32,366 --> 01:36:36,132
- My God, are you all right?
- I'm okay. I'm all right.

1396
01:36:42,743 --> 01:36:45,871
- Is this your idea of being a parent?
- Mom, no. Please Iisten to me.

1397
01:36:46,047 --> 01:36:50,313
- He didn't do anything wrong.
- It's okay, Sally. I deserve that.

1398
01:36:51,752 --> 01:36:54,448
And that's for Ieaving us
seven years ago.

1399
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:58,481
- I deserve that too.
- No.

1400
01:36:59,127 --> 01:37:00,594
You don't.

1401
01:37:00,895 --> 01:37:02,726
Trust me, Mom.

1402
01:37:03,698 --> 01:37:06,826
I could have you arrested
for endangering the Iives of these kids.

1403
01:37:07,268 --> 01:37:09,532
You could. I wouldn't blame you one bit.

1404
01:37:10,838 --> 01:37:12,362
Mom.

1405
01:37:12,607 --> 01:37:14,700
Don't you think he spent
enough time in jail?

1406
01:37:20,314 --> 01:37:21,804
Maybe so.

1407
01:37:27,155 --> 01:37:28,713
- Dad.
- Yeah?

1408
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:31,017
You remember the handshake?

1409
01:37:37,999 --> 01:37:39,227
Thank you, Sally.

1410
01:37:53,514 --> 01:37:55,880
- You nervous?
- Definitely.

1411
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:57,347
My hands are shaking.

1412
01:37:58,219 --> 01:38:00,244
About the new job or the first date?

1413
01:38:00,621 --> 01:38:01,883
Both.

1414
01:38:02,056 --> 01:38:04,251
It's been a Iong time in either case.

1415
01:38:04,792 --> 01:38:06,953
Well, you're gonna be awesome
at both.

1416
01:38:07,128 --> 01:38:09,255
And just wait till you actually have a car.

1417
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:12,490
You know, dates and jobs
get easier with cars.

1418
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:15,329
Well, job first.
I'll worry about the car Iater.

1419
01:38:15,503 --> 01:38:18,734
When I get ahead of myself,
that's how I get in trouble.

1420
01:38:18,906 --> 01:38:20,066
Good point.

1421
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:23,741
Okay, you ready?

1422
01:38:26,147 --> 01:38:28,581
- Ready as I'm gonna be.
- Okay.

1423
01:38:28,749 --> 01:38:30,307
Okay. Come on.

1424
01:38:34,055 --> 01:38:35,454
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1425
01:38:43,264 --> 01:38:45,027
Hey.

1426
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:47,590
Hey.

1427
01:38:51,739 --> 01:38:52,967
Okay. Next caller, please.

1428
01:38:56,744 --> 01:39:01,807
Ray-Ray--
I mean, it's just plain old Ray.

1429
01:39:02,049 --> 01:39:03,038
Larue?

1430
01:39:05,553 --> 01:39:09,114
- First-time caller.
- You're a sweet thing, all right.

1431
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:12,817
I'm having a Iittle trouble-- Excuse me.
I'm having trouble adjusting...

1432
01:39:12,994 --> 01:39:14,791
...to my environment.

1433
01:39:14,962 --> 01:39:16,554
Well...

1434
01:39:18,733 --> 01:39:20,701
...you know, Larue, at this point...

1435
01:39:20,868 --> 01:39:24,565
...I think the best thing for you
to remember is the three essentials:

1436
01:39:24,739 --> 01:39:26,263
Confront it...

1437
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,408
...be truthful...

1438
01:39:28,743 --> 01:39:30,836
...and sleep
with your back against the wall.
