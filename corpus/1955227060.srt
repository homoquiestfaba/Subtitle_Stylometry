00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,051
NARRATOR: (FRENCH ACCENT)
Since 1939, filmmakers and film

3
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:20,854
Lovers from all over the world
have flocked to the Cannes Film

4
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:24,258
Festival... the most prestigious
of such celebrations

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,560
To promote and worship cinema.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,363
The mainstream media
only shows the glamour,

7
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,300
The Hollywood styles, and
the international giltterati.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,437
But the Cannes Film
Festival, it is for everyone.

9
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:40,708
For nearly 30 years, Lloyd
Kaufman and the Toma Team

10
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,443
Have made their
annual pilgrimage

11
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,678
To the center of
cinematic culture

12
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,847
On a very, very low budget.

13
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:51,152
At Cannes 2001, the Troma
Team documented exactly how

14
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:54,088
They promote, sell,
and buy movies, hoping

15
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,391
To create a how-to
guide on going to Cannes

16
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,727
With very, very little money.

17
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:03,364
What was supposed to be a
simple, straightforward,

18
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:08,336
Educational exercise proved
to be quite something else.

19
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,504
[Music playing]

20
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:11,305
Troma!

21
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,478
[Snoring] Oh!

22
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,948
Greetings, not from Tromaville,
but from John Fitzerald Kennedy

23
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,419
International Airport
where I'm on my way

24
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,920
To the Cannes Film Festival.

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,921
You'll have to make a movie.

26
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,256
That's a pretty tough job.

27
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,259
But once you've made your
movie, what do you do with hit?

28
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,527
How do you sell it?
How do you make any money on it?

29
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,561
What do you do?

30
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,230
I could give it to
one of those giant,

31
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,899
Evil conglomerates who
will chop it up perhaps

32
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,967
And take it away from you.

33
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,371
Or perhaps you need to
sell your own movie.

34
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,773
You need to only derive
revenue from your own movie.

35
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,108
And the Cannes Film
Festival is a way

36
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,212
Not only to sell your movie,
but to get your name around

37
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,414
And to get your
movie's name around.

38
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,817
So, as you can see, I have
the Troma shopping bag.

39
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,720
Then I have, for example,
this beautiful Troma

40
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,755
Catalog to get out.

41
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:38,091
I've got the beautiful
Tromadance invitation

42
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,993
To the beach party,
which can be given

43
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,929
Out... these peanuts
for the airplane

44
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,130
Because we don't buy them.

45
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:46,700
We got them from the Amish
market near Tromaville

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,270
Because it's very expensive to
get stuff here in the airport.

47
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:30,844
We're in the Nice airport
where we made a connection.

48
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,780
No, we're not.

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,182
We're in the Paris airport.

50
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:39,553
You can see this is the
fabulous Terminal F2.

51
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:44,258
And you can see that I haven't
been able to do any networking.

52
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:49,029
Or I haven't seen any
very important people yet.

53
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,931
But we will a soldier on.

54
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,405
Food from the airplane
because Cannes

55
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,508
Is a very expensive food town.

56
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,744
OK, Jean Pierre... Jeanne
Pierre is... Jeanne

57
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,947
Pierre is doing a... oh, oh, my.

58
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:11,919
Jeanne Pierre is doing a
documentary about Troma.

59
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,588
And what's even more
valuable is we're

60
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:18,892
Going to get a lift from
this airport to Cannes

61
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,363
Because the taxis from Nice
to Cannes cost about $200.

62
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,865
You can get a kidney
transplant for what

63
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,335
The taxis cost in this town.

64
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,337
So we've already made money.

65
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,305
And thanks to
Jeanne Pierre here,

66
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,808
We have saved $200 for a taxi.

67
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,276
And I guess now we will proceed.

68
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,358
They said that they started
the festival here in May

69
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,926
Because in 1939, it
apparently had rained

70
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,828
A lot during the May months.

71
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,598
And what you do in a
resort area that rains.

72
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,933
So how do you fill
up the hotels?

73
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,770
So they decided let's
have a film festival.

74
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,607
Now, 54 years later the
weather patterns have

75
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,409
Changed with global warming.

76
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,944
And it's actually very
warm and beautiful.

77
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,081
This is the world famous
Croisette of Cannes.

78
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,016
This is the most
beautiful, beautiful

79
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,686
Esplanade which...
Which runs along

80
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,689
The entire town of Cannes.

81
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,857
It hugs the water.

82
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:27,094
And where do we who are doing
business choose to walk?

83
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,831
Well, of course, we walk on
the ugly side of the boulevard

84
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,933
So that we can
then hopefully run

85
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,168
Into important business people.

86
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,705
And if you keep your
eyes open, you just

87
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:42,576
Might see independent film
executives like me performing

88
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,079
Full swallow blow jobs
right here on the Croissette

89
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,716
In order to get
our movies licensed

90
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:52,420
To various international
territories.

91
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,489
So where do you stay when
you're at Cannes because Cannes

92
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,624
Is very expensive?

93
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,225
And especially
during the festival.

94
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,662
It is sometimes better
to stay in an apartment,

95
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,697
Which is a lot less expensive.

96
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,900
There is our apartment...
A rather simple place.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,102
It's still
ridiculously expensive.

98
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:14,341
But on the other hand, it is
lovely to get up in the morning

99
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,944
And have this magnificent view.

100
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,613
Do you remember those
pastries from the airplane?

101
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,048
Well, there they are.

102
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,550
That's the breakfast we had.

103
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,317
This is the Martinez Hotel.

104
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,054
There are three major
hotels... the Carlton,

105
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:33,193
Where Troma is situated, the
Majestic, and the Martinez.

106
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,996
Very important people mainly
hang out at those three hotels.

107
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,130
And, of course,
there is there is

108
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,167
The fabulous Cap d'Antibes
the Hotel du Cap,

109
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,602
Which only takes cash.

110
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,370
You have to sign
up for two weeks.

111
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,738
That's where people
like Harvey Weinstein

112
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,508
Will stay... the really
important people.

113
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,478
For about 25 years,
we've had offices.

114
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,481
We rent hotel rooms
in the Carlton Hotel.

115
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,449
And that's where we do business.

116
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:59,620
And you show trailers and
excerpts from your movies.

117
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,055
And sometimes you
even screen the movies

118
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,558
For the people
who buy movies who

119
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,359
Come from all over
the world to Cannes

120
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,829
To buy distribution
rights to movies.

121
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,434
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Sure.

122
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,536
WOMAN: Sorry, I didn't see you.

123
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,337
Thanks, Count, I'm a
college student as well.

124
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,338
I am wondering.

125
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,873
As far as your
company goes, do you...

126
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,275
Do you... is it large
enough to support itself

127
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,243
In different departments?

128
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,045
We have about a
total of 30 people.

129
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,916
We're headquartered in New York
on 50th Street and 9th Avenue.

130
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,151
And then we have a
small office in LA.

131
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,887
And we have about 30 young
volunteers who came to Cannes

132
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,155
From different countries.

133
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,157
They all came here on their own.

134
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,425
They paid their way.

135
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,661
We let them stay
in our apartment.

136
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,564
And so we have sort
of a Troma crash

137
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,566
Pad that's... it's
actually a real,

138
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,736
Real world going on. [Laughter]

139
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,470
And I filmed it this morning.

140
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,239
And it is real.

141
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,342
We have 30 to 40 volunteers
coming from all over the world

142
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,777
Working for free.

143
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,947
The volunteers are very
key in promoting Troma

144
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,850
Because we don't have the money
to pay for advertising all

145
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,052
These magazines and billboards.

146
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,587
So if we don't have any
money for advertising,

147
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,289
We certainly don't have money
to pay for employees to fly out

148
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,658
To France and stay in France.

149
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,527
That's why we have one hotel
room that everyone sleeps in.

150
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:17,397
So this is the...
Uh, Troma's crash pad

151
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,099
Where the Troma
team has the very,

152
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,970
Very luxurious accommodations.

153
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,371
This is where the
Troma team lives.

154
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,172
Look how nice.

155
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:32,145
This is a place that's probably
made for about four people.

156
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:37,918
And I guess it's
probably got about 30.

157
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:48,361
Anyway, Troma Entertainment
is 27 years old.

158
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,363
It's the oldest intact
movie studio in the world.

159
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,865
We've been coming to
the Cannes Film Festival

160
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,167
Over... I guess 27 years, right?

161
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:54,968
27 years, yeah?

162
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,236
Something like that.

163
00:08:56,336 --> 00:09:00,440
And, um, we have the lovely
Tromettes... Tromettes.

164
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,408
Whoo!

165
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,877
She's all beautiful, huh?

166
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:04,678
This is uh...

167
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:05,979
I like the beauty.

168
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,316
This is called marketing
techniques... marketing

169
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,786
Techniques... Troma... Troma.

170
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,589
It's very important that people
see the name of your product...

171
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,624
What you're pitching.

172
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,259
And you have to go
out and make noise.

173
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,427
You have to be seen.

174
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,129
If you want to
promote your film,

175
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,197
You have to go out
and be like, Troma!

176
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:24,998
See look... see look.

177
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:25,799
The Troma.

178
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,567
See all those cameras.

179
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,502
It's because we're idiots!

180
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,904
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Who...
Do you speak English?

181
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,005
Yeah.

182
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,174
LLOYD KAUFMAN: When
did you discover Troma?

183
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:39,947
I discoverd Troma 20 years ago
at the Cannes Film Festival.

184
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,214
LLOYD KAUFMAN: And
do you have a Troma

185
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,717
Movie that's your favorite?

186
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:47,220
Yeah, I like
"Sergeant Kabukiman"

187
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,990
And the "Toxic Avenger."

188
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,860
LLOYD KAUFMAN: And why
do you like Troma movies?

189
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,894
Because it's crazy.

190
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,062
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We
are now preparing

191
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:58,065
For the daily parade...
The big parade.

192
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,532
So we will be more
beloved by the people.

193
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,801
Ah oh!

194
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,837
The cameras are exactly
opposite the doors of the hotel.

195
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,205
So come straight out.

196
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,875
But give the cameras a chance
to get ahead of you so they

197
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,076
Can do what they have to do.

198
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:09,877
Troma!

199
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:18,351
So the parade is... the Troma
Parade is going on behind me.

200
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:23,256
This is a way that we get
the people's attention.

201
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:27,728
We use the Troma Parade
both to promote the spirit

202
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,730
Of independent cinema.

203
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,232
And at the same time we are
able to get some publicity

204
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,401
So that we can sell our movies.

205
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,872
Warner Brothers spends who
knows how much money per movies.

206
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,342
And we basically are doing
it on absolutely nothing.

207
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,280
I believe I hear
the Troma music now.

208
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,250
The Troma musicians... I think...
That's the Troma song, yeah!

209
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,651
That's the "All the
Love You Cannes" song.

210
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:52,953
[Music playing]

211
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,087
(SINGING) All the
love you Cannes.

212
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,493
Follow us to the [inaudible].

213
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:05,432
Ladies and gentlemen,
please come!

214
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:06,399
Come with us!

215
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,868
Drop your phone.

216
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,369
Just come with us.

217
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:10,470
Troma!

218
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:16,043
Lord Kaufmann is here
[inaudible] is here.

219
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,345
Think about where
you're going because you

220
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,948
Could be having a lot
more fun if you follow us!

221
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,415
[Whistle]

222
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,851
[Crowd sounds]

223
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,319
Don't just stand there.

224
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,287
Go to the promenade!

225
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,560
MAN: One, two,
three, four, Troma!

226
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,928
Troma!

227
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:35,863
Troma!

228
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:36,930
Troma!

229
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,731
Troma!

230
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:49,843
[Whistles] [cheers]

231
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,813
Are you coming to
the film festival?

232
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,749
Did you come because you wanted
to see independent cinema?

233
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,717
The only place you're going
to see independent cinema.

234
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,797
[Music playing]

235
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,878
See, we've got some people that
are coming to see the movie.

236
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,213
They are coming to
see the movie, right?

237
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,854
[Cheers]

238
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,025
Yeah, bye, bye, Mad Cowboy.

239
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:38,826
What your tail!

240
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:39,626
What your tail!

241
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,064
Now we lost Mad Cowboy.

242
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,765
We just make our
movies the way we

243
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:49,202
Want to make them...
No bullshit, stupid

244
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,138
Fucking Hollywood ending.

245
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,605
We want blood.

246
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,674
We want... we want drama.

247
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,143
That's what we want.

248
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,078
And that's what we're
bringing to the table.

249
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,247
Troma!

250
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,581
Troma!

251
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,615
Troma dance.

252
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,917
Troma dance.

253
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,853
Troma dance.

254
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:06,653
Troma!

255
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,391
Troma!

256
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,559
CAMERAMAN: What
just happened, Jen?

257
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,869
And degrade myself as a woman
and have no respect for myself.

258
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,741
CAMERAMAN: Why?

259
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,243
I don't know.

260
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,378
CAMERAMAN: Tell me why.

261
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,949
I just feel like
a piece of meat.

262
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,518
Like, it's just really
weird... like all

263
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,887
The cameras are on like me.

264
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,855
And it was just kind of
freaking me out, yeah.

265
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,390
Like everybody was
just staring at me.

266
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,926
Like, I could see all those
like little circles fucking

267
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,061
Just like looking at me.

268
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,897
And it was just like
scariest thing, dude.

269
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,131
CAMERAMAN: What just happened?

270
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,765
Well, we just had an
experience on the Croisette

271
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:53,700
Like you can't believe.

272
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,605
These kids... do
you see that mark?

273
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,008
The mark of a lollipop.

274
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,109
They threw things at me.

275
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,711
I mean, the threw things at us.

276
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,415
Thank god they were just
suckers and bananas and things.

277
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,383
And they were grabbing
us from every which way.

278
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,184
It was very dangerous.

279
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,152
[Cheers]

280
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:14,754
Hey!

281
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,555
Hey!

282
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,423
Hey!

283
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,524
MAN (ON MEGAPHONE): Back off.

284
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,626
Back off, guys, unless
you're [inaudible].

285
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,498
Hey!

286
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,435
MAN (ON MEGAPHONE):
[inaudible] thanks a lot.

287
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,871
This is the Troma office
at the Carlton Hotel.

288
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:36,343
This is where Michael Dwyer...
Michael Dwyer is speaking with.

289
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,778
He's trying to sell movies.

290
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,781
But unfortunately, Michael
has to deal with this.

291
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,751
This is going on
at the same time.

292
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,954
So part of what we're
doing is Michael

293
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:51,091
Is talking to international
buyers... people

294
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,360
From France, Spain,
Japan... Kaula Lumpure.

295
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,228
CAMERAMAN: Where?

296
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,630
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Kuala Lumpur,
incredible... the capital

297
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,531
Of piracy.

298
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,532
They're selling there.

299
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,134
Excellent!
Very good.

300
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,202
[Cheers]

301
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,403
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Tetsu
Fujimora, everybody.

302
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,708
Servant of gaga communication!

303
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,111
[Cheers] Tetsu!

304
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,046
Welcome to Tromaville!

305
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,081
He's your father.

306
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:14,881
He created Kabukiman.

307
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,718
How are you?

308
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,787
I'm all right, yourself?

309
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,555
So we finished "Citizen
Toxie Part Four"

310
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,656
Yeah, I heard.

311
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,824
Any hope we can get
distribution in Japan?

312
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,293
I hope.

313
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:27,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

314
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,262
No, really, seriously,
you don't have to worry.

315
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,263
Is it true?

316
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,732
Can we get anyone
to distribute it?

317
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:37,170
I mean, we can distribute...
We can distribute it.

318
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,938
So it looks good?

319
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,040
Any theatrical?

320
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,041
- It's a question of...
- It's a theatrical.

321
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,142
Theatrical.

322
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,310
Yeah, it's a question of when.

323
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,711
Oh, OK.

324
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,147
So we are trying to talk about
selling "Citizen Toxie... Toxic"

325
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,782
"Avenger IV" to Japan.

326
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,583
And this is going on.

327
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,925
Many of these people, uh...

328
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,394
[Opera singing]

329
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:15,042
The people behind me are the
distributors of Troma in Sweden

330
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,877
And Mike Dwyer is
currently showing

331
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,948
Them various trailers of
movies that we are coming

332
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,450
Out with here at the festival.

333
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,553
After we have discussed
with the clients,

334
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,621
Then we sign contracts.

335
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,756
This is a contract.

336
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,658
This is a typical contract.

337
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:32,959
It's very simple.

338
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,028
It's a very, very
simple contract.

339
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:40,167
This one is with... this is
with Indonesia... Indonesia.

340
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,670
Advances are usually paid
maybe 10% in advance.

341
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,839
So you can see the intense...
You can see that there is

342
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,909
Intense negotiation going
on behind me between Mike

343
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,246
Dwyer and Mr. Lu's company.

344
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,282
It looks like we're going
to make a deal here.

345
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,918
And a Big Tasty is
part of the deal.

346
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,455
Big Tasty is presenting
a very wonderful climate

347
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,823
In which to do business.

348
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,993
This man here... he is buying
movies for Germany and India.

349
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,261
What's your name?

350
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,129
My name is Harish.

351
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,097
Harish.

352
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,332
So welcome to Tromaville.

353
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,633
And sit down here.

354
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:17,504
And we will, um, we'll get
a list of what is available.

355
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,840
So now we are having
the best of Troma dance.

356
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,842
We're showing the
best of Troma dance.

357
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,677
Some of the young
directors will be here.

358
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:29,116
And hopefully, some
buyers or investor

359
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,984
Types or journalists
or someone will

360
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:35,622
Come in and discover somebody.

361
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,958
Welcome to the
best of Tromadance

362
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,394
And the finest selections
of truly independent cinema.

363
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,030
We are out of Park
City, Utah, right here.

364
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,798
LLOYD KAUFMAN: And, of
course, if you look carefully,

365
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,367
You'll see that
within all this, Mike

366
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:51,104
Dwyer is selling a man movies.

367
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,440
And this man is buying
movies for, very

368
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,711
Logically, India and Germany,
which is a perfect combination.

369
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,913
Mike Dwyer has to
take his meetings.

370
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,081
He's out in the hall.

371
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,716
He's meeting with a buyer
at this very minute.

372
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,984
I don't blame him one bit.

373
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:05,785
What's that?

374
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:06,919
What' s that, Mike?

375
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,921
It's money from Malaysia
from a deal I just did.

376
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,123
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Is
that pocket money?

377
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,057
Cash money.

378
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,126
It's maybe for
Troma, not for me.

379
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,827
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So what
did you sell to them?

380
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,130
A package of 23 pictures.

381
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,097
This is just a deposit.

382
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,132
LLOYD KAUFMAN: That's a deposit.

383
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,201
Ooh!

384
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,035
It's $2,200.

385
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:23,836
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Wow!

386
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,104
Excellent.

387
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:29,041
One of the interesting
phenomenon of going to Cannes

388
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,110
On business where you're
trying to sell your movies

389
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:36,916
To international distributors
is that you cannot get...

390
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,050
You don't get the same movies.

391
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,486
You would think at the
Cannes Film Festival

392
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,289
You'd get the C
movies... impossible.

393
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,457
And even you... even
if you had the time

394
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,326
After 30 years in
the film business,

395
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:49,496
Troma is not allowed
to even... well.

396
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,632
Troma is not even
allowed to get tickets.

397
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,867
We can't even get tickets,
even though we take a booth.

398
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,870
Even though I've been
there for all this time,

399
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,139
It's impossible to get
tickets to anything good.

400
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,875
So it's probably the only
film festival I go to where

401
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,578
I actually do not see movies.

402
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,918
So what we do at Cannes is in
addition to selling movies,

403
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,019
We try to get attention.

404
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,821
So here we have RTL.

405
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,757
RTL would probably not
going to be too interested

406
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,926
In an ugly, old person like me.

407
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,561
But because Troma is
kind of interesting,

408
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,697
RTL, which was a major
French network is here.

409
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,299
Hopefully, we
raise the awareness

410
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,669
Of Troma at Cannes and France
because it's difficult to sell

411
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:30,637
Movies to France.

412
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,439
"Citizen Toxie...
Toxic Avenger IV"

413
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,309
Is a shot by shot reconstruction
of the great classic

414
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,446
By Orson Welles, "Citizen Kane,"
and some of the other themes

415
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,813
Of "Citizen Toxie" typically.

416
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,015
Incredible.

417
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,251
There's abortion.

418
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,786
And there's people shitting
and pissing themselves.

419
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:51,258
Oh, that's a small
theme... a very small theme.

420
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,059
But "Citizen Toxie" will be...

421
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,061
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We're
doing an interview...

422
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,496
An interview for French radio.

423
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:57,530
The lady is phoning it in.

424
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,932
And it's going to
be on French radio.

425
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,733
[Speaking french]

426
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,578
What do you think?

427
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,945
CAMERAMAN: About the movie?

428
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:13,846
Oui. [Speaking french]

429
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:21,020
One of the purposes of having
this booth is to get publicity.

430
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,389
So many cameras come here.

431
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,724
There's media from
all over the world.

432
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,560
And something's
going on behind me.

433
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,297
It looks like Scott
McKinley from the Troma,

434
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,231
Los Angeles office
is being interviewed

435
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:37,069
About perhaps it may be the
Troma recycling project.

436
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,571
We put recycle
bins in the American

437
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,908
Pavilion, which is sort
of the center of activity

438
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:42,975
Here at the festival.

439
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,477
At least the Americans
like to think so.

440
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:49,416
So anyone who is making a movie
could easily come to Cannes on

441
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:53,386
His or her own and by coming
up with a little energy

442
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:57,390
Get worldwide publicity because
there are thousands of cameras

443
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,858
Here.

444
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,361
And they are all
looking for a story.

445
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,296
Scott McKinley's job
was raising the money

446
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,831
To have Troma come to Cannes.

447
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,266
Scott McKinley would raise
money like nobody's business.

448
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,336
I don't have time to do that.

449
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,672
Scott would get the money
together for us to have

450
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,374
Our party and come to Cannes.

451
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,943
And it wouldn't
cost us anything.

452
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,678
We got hollywood.com
to sponsor Tromadance

453
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,647
At in the independent film
festival... hollywood.com.

454
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,988
CAMERAMAN: Look at that...
Look at that guy go.

455
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:29,822
Ladies and gentlemen.

456
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:30,990
CAMERAMAN: The Toxic Avenger.

457
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,461
Ooh, that was eerie.

458
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:37,196
It is without further
ado that I would think

459
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,901
Kodak, the Academy, Lloyd
Kaufman, Michael Harris, Yaniv,

460
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:46,205
And of course, Doug Sakmann.

461
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,607
See this?

462
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,843
When I used to come to Cannes in
1971, there were no such thing.

463
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,279
But now you have this
because the problem

464
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,415
With the Cannes Film Festival is
it is very hard to communicate.

465
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,617
It's a big, long Croisette.

466
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,652
So this little thing
here although it's

467
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:02,889
Very expensive because you
have to get a French one.

468
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,557
And they really rip you
off during the Cannes Film

469
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,692
Festival.

470
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,293
It's worth having, even
if you are on a budget.

471
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,962
Don't eat and have this because
you will save a lot of time.

472
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,064
And you will also
be able to do more

473
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,066
Business with a little
phone because you

474
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,668
Can call anyone you wish.

475
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,470
Also, you'll see a lot
of people on the phone

476
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,339
At like 3:00 in the morning
trying to look important.

477
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,675
So if you have nothing to
do, you walk around on this.

478
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,176
You walk down the street
as if you're talking

479
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,778
To somebody on the cellphone.

480
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:26,646
And it's very impressive.

481
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,381
And another thing, Michael.

482
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:31,951
I don't like your
tie, oh, just joking.

483
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,553
CAMERAMAN: It's not actually on.

484
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,856
Now, it's very important
to go to a lot of parties

485
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,358
Because that's how you
can promote yourself.

486
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,727
You go to parties.

487
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,429
You can promote your movies.

488
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,830
You can promote yourself.

489
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,468
And you get a chance to get some
free booze or more free booze

490
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:52,539
And perhaps get lucky
with a cheap woman

491
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,741
And some cheap booze.

492
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,876
So behind us is one
of those parties.

493
00:22:56,976 --> 00:23:00,312
And we have managed to
wrangle and invitation.

494
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:02,248
So at any rate, we will go in.

495
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,616
And hopefully we'll
meet some buyers

496
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,151
And be able to sell
some Troma movies

497
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,454
To different territories.

498
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,857
I used this fake press pass.

499
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:15,361
This is a bogus press pass that
gets me into these parties.

500
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:17,964
And this is a good
thing for you to have.

501
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,968
If you look, and if this doesn't
work... if this doesn't work,

502
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,505
Then we use this one.

503
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,139
This one definitely works.

504
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,442
So next time you read
about Patrick Swayze peeing

505
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,544
In the punch bowl... ah, ah, ah.

506
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,146
This is a fairly fancy party.

507
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,984
This is the party for
the Marche du Film.

508
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,286
And the only reason
that people like me get

509
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:44,256
Invited... low-class riff
raff... is because we

510
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,125
Pay money for screenings here.

511
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,561
To screen your movie,
it costs about $800

512
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,363
For a lousy screening
with shit projection.

513
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,099
But what can you do?

514
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,768
And what's important, of
course, is that there hopefully

515
00:23:55,868 --> 00:24:00,272
Will be film buyers here so I
can grovel and fellate and do

516
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,943
Whatever is necessary
to sell "Citizen Toxie,"

517
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,513
Or "Terror Firmer" or
"Tromeo and Juliet."

518
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,749
The man you are looking
at now is Jerome Pallade.

519
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:13,019
He is the boss of
the Marche du Film.

520
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,987
And that lady...
This lady here is

521
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,689
The director of the festival.

522
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,459
She does all the nuts and bolts
of the actual festival itself.

523
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,065
So ABC television is here to
do some story about Cannes

524
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,367
And how movies are sold here.

525
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:34,541
So John, this is the
fourth Toxic Avenger movie.

526
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:38,244
When you came here 15 years
ago, I think we had just made

527
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:39,245
The first Toxic Avenger movie.

528
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:48,487
Really?

529
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,161
Smokey, can you tell John
where the bathroom is?

530
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,797
This is the great John Stossel
I recognize from America.

531
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,165
That would be me.

532
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,600
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Play the "All
the Love You Cannes" bathroom

533
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,400

All the love you can.

536
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,009
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Can you
show him with Suzie?

537
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,544
Because there's no
toilet in that place.

538
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,445
SMOKULA: This is why
you the Toxic Avenger.

539
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,814
Ah, this is a
standing event, though.

540
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:15,615
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh, OK.

541
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:24,924
I think we just blew any chance
we have to be on "20/20."

542
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,425
CAMERAMAN: What's the
show going to be about?

543
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,226
Promotion?

544
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,761
Selling.

545
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,498
CAMERAMAN: What other studios
are you guys [inaudible]?

546
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,367
Uh, we went to [inaudible].

547
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,337
Went to that [inaudible].

548
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,907
I don't even... I'm too
movie clueless to even

549
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,509
Know the names of the studios.

550
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,911
CAMERAMAN: This is
Arban, by the way, who

551
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,313
Stars in the new Tromo movie.

552
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:48,915
And this is Mr. John Stossel.

553
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,116
Hi, pleased to meet you.

554
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:50,950
WOMAN: If you have any
issues, we have our camera

555
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,151
Right now, if you don't mind.

556
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,120
CAMERAMAN: All right, all
right, yeah, sure, sure.

557
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,554
WOMAN: Not to be rude.

558
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,724
Yes, we are just doing
a little bit with you

559
00:25:57,824 --> 00:26:01,594
And sort of bear in mind for
your self-promotion here.

560
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,596
Our show is not going
to be about Tromo.

561
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:05,264
But this is about selling.

562
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,633
OK

563
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,535
Any insights you have... and
you have about selling and even

564
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:11,470
About some of the crazy
things you've seen

565
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,506
Other people to do to
get attention and what

566
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:15,775
Works and what doesn't.

567
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,077
You should give us some
warning because maybe

568
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,946
We can get Dolphin Man here.

569
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:23,282
And I mean, do you want the...
Do you want to the characters

570
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:27,586
Because since you met us last we
have created new superheroes...

571
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:32,825
Dolphin Man, Killer Condom
Man, Sergeant Kabukiman, NYPD.

572
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,895
And the purpose is to make
people aware of you, right?

573
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,396
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
it's the old-fashioned...

574
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,967
It's called showmanship,
something that many people

575
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,235
In our business have forgotten.

576
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,705
[Music playing]

577
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:47,674
(SINGING) All the
love you Cannes.

578
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:56,548
All the love you Cannes.

579
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:59,018
All the love, all
the love you Cannes.

580
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:07,459
So you come with all this stuff
and just... and people put you

581
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,327
In the newspaper.

582
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,328
And that sells movies?

583
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,064
Troma has been here since 1971.

584
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,866
JOHN STOSSEL: And
nobody has heard of you

585
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,367
Despite all this fancy stuff.

586
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,435
You know why?

587
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,671
Because the movie
business is a cartel.

588
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:20,606
Troma owns 850 movies.

589
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:22,742
The Toxic Avenger
is a household word.

590
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:26,746
And a cartel is running what
we hear and see and smell.

591
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:30,216
But thanks to Troma at Cannes
we do a lot of selling.

592
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,552
This is called showmanship...
Troma showmanship.

593
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,387
Do you have trouble
getting people to dress

594
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,889
Up in these hot outfits.

595
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,324
People do it for free.

596
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,792
People volunteer.

597
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,061
Dolphin Man... do you
make money doing this?

598
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:42,862
No, no, no.

599
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:43,662
But I enjoy it.

600
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,131
It's a lot of fun, you know?

601
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:46,999
People are learning
the movie business.

602
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,500
And the movie
business is being run

603
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,103
As a private preserve
for the elite...

604
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:55,141
Put the Clinton,
Reagan, Nixon axis.

605
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,542

00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,977

00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,478
And there are lot of
young people out there

608
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,881
Who both want to
make money buying

609
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,683
And selling wonderful art
as well as enjoying it.

610
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,118
You're selling
with your breast.

611
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,219
It's not embarrassing.

612
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,455
It's not really
so much selling.

613
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,857
It's just kind of
like a billboard

614
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:13,559
Or like a flashing light...
Like a strobe light.

615
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:14,493
What are breasts for?

616
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:15,394
They are mine.

617
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,796
I do what I want with them, OK?

pussy... everything I've got.

has heard of Troma despite you

because MGM and Universal

Spend millions and
millions of dollars

624
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,611
To just make their movies.

were you guy who

638
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,603
Did the show on racism
that aired about a month

639
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:00,039
Ago or so on ABC?

640
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:01,908
Uhh.

641
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:04,911
YANIV SHARON: Racism, like
in Hollywood, I remember.

642
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:07,346
You went on a college
campus, I think,

643
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,116
And they just like
they spoke so loudly

644
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,750
And they like booed you out.

645
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:12,952
It's about free speech.
YANIV SHARON: Yeah, that was it.

646
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:14,053
That was it.

647
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,755
It's about not being
allowed to speak freely.

648
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:17,990
It wasn't about racism.

649
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,358
YANIV SHARON: Right, OK, yeah.

650
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:20,426

you met the Troma.

I met Troma in Cannes
because every time there

Was a very big problem in
front of hotel or parties,

it was made by Troma.

of these sexy moments.

00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,761
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Anything in those bins?

702
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,229
Open it up.

703
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,765
Nice.

704
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,267
YANIV SHARON: Everybody
here it is in action.

705
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,268
Here it is in action.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh, let's see.

706
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:42,969
YANIV SHARON: She
doen't even know.

707
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,070
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK I see.

708
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:44,736
YANIV SHARON: She's
stepping up as a student

709
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:45,704
Naively and scores!

710
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:46,672
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Nice!

711
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:47,673
Beautiful.

712
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:48,640
YANIV SHARON: Well done.

713
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,609
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Very nice.

714
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:51,777
You can see behind me.

715
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:55,214
You meet all sorts of
interesting people.

716
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,283
And so as a
filmmaker, you may get

717
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:00,186
Great ideas here, even though
you were here on business.

718
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,088
For example, I got
the idea to make

719
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:03,655
What Toxic Avenger a good guy.

720
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,890
It was right here at Cannes.

721
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:07,926
So it's a very
inspiring place to be.

722
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,528
And you have the
wonderful people

723
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:12,298
Like this who are PhDs and
now want to throw it all away

724
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,034
And act in a Troma movie.

725
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:19,338
So what is your... what
is your ambition now?

726
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,340
I am si... singer.

727
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,310
I sing.

728
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,814
(SINGING) My Bonnie
is over the ocean.

729
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:32,251
My Bonnie is over the sea.

730
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:36,722
My Bonnie is over the ocean.

731
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,024
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

732
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:45,131
Bring back, bring
back, oh, bring

733
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,866
Back my Bonnie to me, to me.

734
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:52,071
Bring back way back.

735
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,939
Oh, bring back my
Bonnie to me, to me.

736
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,555
Thank you, bye, bye.

737
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,689
CAMERAMAN: What's going on?

738
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,192
She's very upset because
Jean Claude is coming.

739
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:14,160
Clear out, now.

740
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,993
Because the Toxic
Avenger is here.

741
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:15,961
CAMERAMAN: We got to clear out.

742
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:16,762
Who's coming?

743
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,004
Yeah, but when he come
though, and when he comes,

744
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:28,840
Though, this can't go on.

745
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,841
YANIV SHARON: Who Jean Claude?

746
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:30,642
Don't worry about it.

747
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:31,977
He's all coked up anyway.

748
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,245
He won't even now.

749
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,046
Get to a corner.

750
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,481
And just don't all this, OK?

751
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:37,849
Clear to a corner,
and you guys can stay.

752
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,885
But don't do any of this.

753
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,087
We would take them.

754
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:42,454
But they want to take
their photograph... they're

755
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:43,555
Famous drama action heroes.

756
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:44,890
Of course everybody
wants their photograph.

757
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,691
So...

758
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:46,825
It's fine right now.

759
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:47,926
But when he comes, this
is not going to be fine.

760
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:48,727
Oh, here he is.

761
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,836
[Cheers]

762
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,091
MAN: Oh, what the fuck is that?

763
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,559
Terrible.

764
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,861
What the fuck are
we all doing here.

765
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,297
We make choices.

766
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,465
This is fucking shit.

767
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,266
Crazy.

768
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:31,603
CAMERAMAN: What did you think?

769
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:32,404
Of that?

770
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,205
CAMERAMAN: Yeah

771
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,606
I thought that was ass.

772
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,542
Jean Claude... boo.

773
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,677
The Troma Team has is the best.

774
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:39,478
We beat Jean Claude!

775
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:47,319
[Inaudible] Troma!

776
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,355
Troma!

777
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,589
We challenged Claude
Jean to a fight.

778
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,392
And he went away like a baby.

779
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,194
Victorious!

780
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,363
[Roar]

781
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:59,265
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Anyway, we've
been having a little... we've

782
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:01,200
Been having a bit of a
contretemps with Warner

783
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,270
Brothers across the hall
because they seemed to be

784
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:09,608
Upset with the fact that the
Troma people might actually

785
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,909
Be having a little bit of fun.

786
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:14,446
One day the security people
came up and were showing

787
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,816
The some movies to some buyers.

788
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,319
And the security people just
came and shut the TV off.

789
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:24,055
They didn't even say would
you mind shutting them down.

790
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:27,025
They've got three rooms
on the water there,

791
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,294
Which is very expensive.

792
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:29,895
And they don't seem to
have the sales office.

793
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:34,866
It all seems like it's press
office and executive offices.

794
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,802
Here's how the Warner
Brothers people work.

795
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:38,804
Here's the connection.

796
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,272
Here's the dog.

797
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,574
He says, look how nice.

798
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,043
Look at the office.

799
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:51,183
On the ocean side... so
nice... beautiful breeze.

800
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:53,619
And look who's here.

801
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,788
Oh, it even has a market pass.

802
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,790
It even has a Warner
Brothers... the dog even

803
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,794
Has a Warner Brothers
market pass... incredible.

804
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,764
[Dog barking]

805
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,374
The dog seems to like me.

806
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:16,708
[Speaking french]

807
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,610
LLOYD KAUFMAN: The dog seems...
The dog seems to like me.

808
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,411
Hi, doggy.

809
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,179
[Dog barks] Hi, doggy.

810
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:27,353
You're not so pleased
to see me, Llloyd.

811
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:28,387
LLOYD KAUFMAN: What?

812
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:31,257
When I saw you dead,
it was delightful.

813
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:34,125
We wanted to see... wanted
to see the "Terror Firmer."

814
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,427
LLOYD KAUFMAN: You
want to see it here?

815
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,362
Yeah.

816
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:36,928
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
You want to watch.

817
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,330
Come and watch.

818
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,601
So Ariel, we're going to show
your scene in "Terror Firmer."

819
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,635
I think you'll like it.

820
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:44,703
I hope it's a bit intellectual.

821
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:51,710
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good right?

822
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,511
You like?

823
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:56,648
What?

824
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:03,622
Excuse me, there's
a problem here.

825
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:04,790
I mean, no.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's excellent.

826
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,591
I'm sorry.

827
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,359
It's not good Lloyd.

828
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,095
I mean, we wanted what was that?

829
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,164
We were supposed
to make some art.

830
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:13,965
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Well...

831
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,601
And what have you done?

832
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,469
Couldn't you put
back of the scene

833
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:25,076
Where I am in Venice and talking
about getting old, and um,

834
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,447
And poetry with a young boy.

835
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:31,583
And we are going on the canal.

836
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,051
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We wanted to.

837
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:34,753
There's this strange music.

838
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,722
There was that other
scene where I was

839
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:38,757
Kind of interpretating space.

840
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,526
LLOYD KAUFMAN: The
interpretative dancing, yep.

841
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,227
And after there was all this...

842
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:43,562
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yes?

843
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:48,434
People from Yale University
talking about mathematics,

844
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:50,101
"Zarathustra."

845
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,637
You're not making movies, Lloyd.

846
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:52,504
You're making shit.

847
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,305
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh!

848
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:08,654
[Speaking french] You ask him?

849
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:09,455
When he gets in?

850
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:18,797
Ooh!

851
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:22,233
[Dog barking] Oooh!

852
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:25,604
[Dog barking]

853
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:26,472
[Speaking french]

854
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:27,839
LLOYD KAUFMAN: [speaking french]

855
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,708
[Dog barking]

856
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,412
That's enough, huh?

857
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:34,245
LLOYD KAUFMAN: What?

858
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:36,081
Keep your dog in your place.

859
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:36,882
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.

860
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,049
No, you shut up.

861
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:38,850
Go away.

862
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,486
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh!

863
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:41,387
You go away.

864
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,389
Your dog was in our place.

865
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,356
We are nice people.

866
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:45,657
We like the dog.

867
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:46,825
It's a very nice dog.

868
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:54,400
So I think as a shareholder,
I will write some kind

869
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,670
Of a letter to the powers
that be at AOL-SlimeWarner

870
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,206
And complain about the
use of shareholder money

871
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,675
For hags with dogs.

872
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,577
Now, have you seen
any good films?

873
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,845
I've seen some excellent films.

874
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:07,513
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
What did you like?

875
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:08,714
I like all of them.

876
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:09,915
YANIV SHARON: You haven't
seen "Terror Firmer."

877
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,783
If the rest of this
festival could only get

878
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:12,718
Up to the standard of Troma.

879
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,518
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Quentin,
Lloyd Kaufamn, Troma.

880
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,487
QUENTIN TARANTINO: Oh,
hey Lloyd, how you doing?

881
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:49,421
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Nice jacket.

882
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,522
QUENTIN TARANTINO:
I appreciate it.

883
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:51,990
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
it looks good... nice.

884
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,994
QUENTIN TARANTINO: It's
great to see you, man.

885
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,420
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Uma
Thurman, and of course,

886
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:26,424
Quentin Tarantino, Ethan Hawke,
and, uh, some other people.

887
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,396
So it seems there's a problem.

888
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:33,999
Doug Sakmann, who
is the, uh, brain

889
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,101
Trust of this organization.

890
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,304
Doug Sakmann has been
banned from the Carlton.

891
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:45,644
Doug redefined
obnoxious in Cannes 2001.

892
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:48,046
I mean, dug himself
redefines obnoxious.

893
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,381
Me and... me and John... we were
going to come in because we

894
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,951
Were going to see if Doug
was up here at, you know,

895
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,285
See if what we're
going to do that night.

896
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,521
And we tried to come up.

897
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,856
And there's some big French
get together... tuxedo,

898
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,090
Black tie, and all that.

899
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,459
And we tried to get in with,
you know, badges ablaze.

900
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,761
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Then what happened?

901
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:05,664
And they said we had to wait
for the reception to end.

902
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,499
And then they kept
saying a few minutes.

903
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,734
But I mean, there in the lobby.

904
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,335
LLOYD KAUFMAN: They wouldn't
let you in the office.

905
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:12,437
They wouldn't let us go through
the lobby just to go upstairs.

906
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:13,505
And I just like cut through.

907
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:14,640
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Then what happened?

908
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,416
No, where did he spit it?

909
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:26,718
Where was he when he spit it?

910
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,519
Where was it he spit it?

911
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:34,526
And there was good publicity
at least for Troma?

912
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:36,695
But were there any
Troma signs or anything?

913
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:37,829
How do you know...
How would people

914
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:38,730
Know this is a Troma thing?

915
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:45,203
So it may have been
all for nought.

916
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,938
I'm outside the Troma office.

917
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,374
See I have this as this badge.

918
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:52,744
It says I can get
anywhere... VIP access.

919
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,413
I shouldn't even need a pass
to get my own... look at me.

920
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,283
Am I not recognizable?

921
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:00,886
I mean, I'm a police
officer for Christ sakes.

922
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:04,222
And they will not let
me into my own hotel.

923
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,024
And I think part
of my task at Cannes

924
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,493
As much as anything
else was to sort of

925
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:09,828
Clean up after the Troma Team.

926
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:10,629
Hey, guys.

927
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:18,904
Fine.

928
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:20,505
Go down there.
I will.

929
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:21,339
I will.

930
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:22,140
I will go down there.

931
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:29,681
If I had a nickel for everybody
that came up to me after they

932
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,217
Had some sort of encounter
publicly or privately with Doug

933
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:36,087
An d said what is that guy's
problem and what is his deal, I

934
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:39,224
Would have like $0.20 or $0.25.

935
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:42,193
I went down and sucked off
the manager of the Carlton

936
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,864
And he permitted Kabukiman to
come into the Carlton finally.

937
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,333
And it was the manager...
The head guy was nice enough

938
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,636
To go to security and
permit Sergeant Kabukiman

939
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:53,204
NYPD to enter the Carlton.

940
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,873
But Kabukiman must behave.

941
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:57,475
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Who knows
where American Pavilion is?

942
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,045
Does anybody know where
the American Pavilion is?

943
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:02,748
Where is the American
Pavilion Kabukiman?

944
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:04,249
This way.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: That way.

945
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:05,350
OK.
Troma.

946
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,317
Ah!

947
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,452
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh, that way.

948
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:08,687
This way.
This way.

949
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:09,487
This way.
Come on.

950
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,488
Come on.
This way.

951
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,456
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh, no.
- It's this way.

952
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:12,791
It's this way, Lloyd.

953
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,325
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh, OK thank
you Kabukiman, you really...

954
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,360
No, it's this way.

955
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,194
LLOYD KAUFMAN: You
really know Cannes.

956
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,096
OK, I'm going to be, oh, sorry.

957
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:19,965
Yeah, so I've got to go
in and do this pitch.

958
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,834
So forgive me, I'm
going to go in, OK?

959
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,002
All right, Troma!

960
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:24,803
Troma!

961
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,404
Troma!
Troma!

962
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:27,272
Troma!

963
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:28,439
We have a press conference.

964
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,240
Come on.

965
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,375
Let's go.

966
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,243
Press conference... we
got a press conference.

967
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,244
Let's go to press conference.

968
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,345
Press conference.

969
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,413
We have a Troma press
conference in here.

970
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,182
Troma.
Troma.

971
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:37,983
Troma.

972
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:43,421
Troma.

973
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,222
Yes!

974
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,023
Yes!

975
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,224
It's our press conference.

976
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:48,593
There are two guys from your...

977
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:52,063
But there's more of us.

978
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,031
Troma!

979
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,366
We have a press conference.

980
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,536
Important... important
press conference.

981
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,806
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do you have...
Don't you have a market pass?

982
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:01,707
Yeah, look.

983
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:02,774
Yeah, look, I do.

984
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:03,909
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So why
can't you come in?

985
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:05,276
I don't know.

986
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,845
Our press conference
is in there.

987
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:08,513
LLOYD KAUFMAN: NARRATOR:
Well, let's get Jenna in.

988
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:09,915
Who cares about Kabukiman?

989
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:11,282
We want Jenna anyway.

990
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,450
In there.
Not here.

991
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,251
It's not here.

992
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:14,720
It's in there.

993
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,621
Why are we here, not there?

994
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:17,689
We have a press conference.

995
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,024
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I got
to go do the pitch.

996
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,561
Ah!

997
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,530
Troma!

998
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,665
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Doug, Doug,
Kabukiman... be careful.

999
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:28,599
Troma!

1000
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,500
Ah!

1001
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,336
Troma!

1002
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,939
Apparently, the Troma
team was not permitted

1003
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,007
Into the American Pavilion.

1004
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:38,209
I can't imagine why.

1005
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:42,480
But the guards here felt
that we are not allowed to go

1006
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,581
To our own press conference.

1007
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,950
What can you do?

1008
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,385
But nonetheless, I think they're
making a very good statement

1009
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:49,888
Beyond the walls of
the what they call

1010
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,090
The international prison camp.

1011
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,959
They're good at building
fences in France.

1012
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,094
They did it around
many Jewish people.

1013
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,929
In the interest
of independent art,

1014
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,630
The students await
your esteemed arrival.

1015
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:00,598
Yes, sir, you're right.

1016
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,500
I am a very
irresponsible old man.

1017
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,802
And I apologize.

1018
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:06,071
And I'm getting very bitter
about the lack of freedom

1019
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:09,240
For independent cinema!

1020
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,710
The American Pavilion sponsors
student who come to Cannes

1021
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,346
Because the young people are
supposed to pay their dues

1022
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,347
And suffer.

1023
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,050
And Mr. Roger Corman...
A friend of mine

1024
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,988
And a major influence
on the history of Troma.

1025
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:25,190
There would be no Troma
without Mr. Corman's example

1026
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:30,195
And inspiration and was kind
enough to talk to us a bit

1027
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:33,832
About the development of
new, young, talented writers,

1028
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:36,301
Directors, producers.

1029
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:39,871
We feel that the
Cannes Film Festival

1030
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,372
May have gotten a
little bit too involved

1031
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,975
With the establishment.

1032
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,378
And I think Troma has survived
by being on the extreme side.

1033
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:52,283
We're trying to go beyond
whatever the majors are doing

1034
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,485
And try to be out there
in space a bit further.

1035
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:59,791
I would say a Troma
movie is 1% or 100%

1036
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:02,360
Beyond most other films.

1037
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,263
But for a low budget
film, you can follow

1038
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:09,267
Your individual thoughts.

1039
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,636
And you can find a niche market.

1040
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,105
And you can succeed,
I think, much better,

1041
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:17,976
Which means you have a greater
opportunity to do an individual

1042
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:20,879
And possibly breakthrough film.

1043
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:25,716
And the problem is that the
major studios now are permitted

1044
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:27,385
To own movie theaters.

1045
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:29,454
So it's very hard
to get a new film

1046
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:31,890
Into the public
consciousness or even

1047
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,558
Into the critics' consciousness.

1048
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:37,328
It is clearly possible to
make good work with the majors

1049
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:40,531
If you can maintain
control over your picture.

1050
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,800
And that's really the ultimate.

1051
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:46,304
I think festivals, established
festivals, such as Cannes

1052
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:47,906
Are important.

1053
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:49,507
And I see Jerry Rudes.

1054
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:51,309
Who has the Avignon Festival.

1055
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,711
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Jerry Rudes
in the room... in the house.

1056
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,613
[Applause]

1057
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:59,617
And I think particularly
festivals such as Avignon

1058
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:02,353
And the other smaller
festivals around the world

1059
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:05,656
Are doing a very
important job of bringing

1060
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:10,628
New films and new filmmakers
to the public's attention.

1061
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:14,832
And Troma, Roger Corman,
will spread the vibrations

1062
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:19,337
Of audacity and originality
and Shakespeare's premise

1063
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,972
That to thine own self be true.

1064
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:24,910
And hopefully we will all
go out on a major crusade

1065
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,547
From this very room known as the
American Pavilion. [Applause]

1066
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,317
What I see Troma
doing in Cannes.

1067
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:36,187
I saw Troma in Cannes, you know,
handing out a lot of flyers.

1068
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:39,190
This the world premiere
with French subtitles.

1069
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,392
World premiere... and it's
going to be worldwide.

1070
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,161
Troma is always worldwide.

1071
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:46,031
And this is the biggest
movie Troma has ever made.

1072
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:48,433
It's the return of the Toxic
Avenger after 15 years.

1073
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,769
Generally, a lot of
public drunkenness

1074
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,673
At inappropriate hours of
the day ostensibly attracting

1075
00:47:55,773 --> 00:48:01,446
Publicity, but ultimately just,
again, just generally offending

1076
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:06,251
People and, you know, causing
people to sort of question

1077
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:09,587
The whole existence and
how does the Troma machine

1078
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:12,890
Continue to somehow chug along.

1079
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,559
No, I drink responsibly.

1080
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:18,896
I always drink responsibly.

1081
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:21,066
And one thing I
can say, I've never

1082
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,068
Gotten so drunk
to the point where

1083
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:24,435
I didn't know what I was doing.

1084
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:28,439
And I choked one of my
co-workers, you know?

1085
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:29,574
Let me say that
again because that

1086
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:30,475
Was a little bit too drunk.

1087
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:34,912
Ah!

1088
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:35,913
Oh!

1089
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:36,881
MAN: Don't fall!

1090
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:38,383
The Aroma du Troma

1091
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:39,350
MAN: Oh, aroma, OK.

1092
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,562
- Fuck!
- Fuck you!

1093
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:52,397
Fuck!

1094
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:53,364
Fuck you!

1095
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:54,966
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1096
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:56,301
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1097
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:57,268
Come on.

1098
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:58,069
Come on.

1099
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,516
You hit me.

1100
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,451
What?

1101
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,853
Parlez vous Ingles?

1102
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,224
Parlez vous Ingles, please.

1103
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,159
Ingles?

1104
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:22,160
Parlez vous Ingles?

1105
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:28,966
Ah, I hate you.

1106
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,640
Don't be an asshole.

1107
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,441
Stop being an asshole.

1108
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:37,508
Come on.

1109
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:38,709
You're not going to
drink that, are you?

1110
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,514
How much?

1111
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:44,415
How much?

1112
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:45,216
Money?

1113
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,017
Money?

1114
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:49,187
You want money?

1115
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:49,987
Yeah, yeah, hit me.

1116
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:50,988
Hit me.

1117
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:53,824
Here we are in
France and the locals

1118
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,560
Aren't really too friendly,
if you know what I mean.

1119
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:02,500
Hey!

1120
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,175
Dance!

1121
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,310
Dance!

1122
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,744
Raise the roof.

1123
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,181
Raise the roof, oh, yeah.

1124
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:18,149
Whoo!

1125
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:19,850
What's your name?

1126
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:25,056
I am... I am Sergeant
Kabukiman, NYPD.

1127
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:26,191
And I have a movie.
Really?

1128
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,125
Screening right over there.

1129
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:28,193
[Inaudible]

1130
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:29,427
This is where our
movie is screamed.

1131
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,461
We haven't seen any films yet.

1132
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:32,797
In production, huh?

1133
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:34,232
"Citizen Toxie."

1134
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,166
This is crazy.

1135
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,634
Look at this shit.

1136
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:40,471
Sergeant Kabukiman NYPD.

1137
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:41,639
And this is my evil twin.

1138
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:42,940
See what Doug
doesn't understand

1139
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,310
Is that there are sponsors
that give money to the Troma

1140
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:50,848
To put on the event and to
generate publicity via Troma

1141
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,250
Making noise at these events.

1142
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:58,756
But they also aren't necessarily
interested in doing it

1143
00:50:58,856 --> 00:51:00,825
And being associated
with the way

1144
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,026
Doug thinks it should be done.

1145
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:03,461
Ah!

1146
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,395
Ah!

1147
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:05,530
Ah!

1148
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,331
Ah!

1149
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:07,132
Ah!

1150
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:08,699
Ahh!

1151
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,769
You're flailing yourself
about in the concrete

1152
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:18,309
While we're all hoping that a
wayward Vespa will come along

1153
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,145
And squash Doug's
head like a grapefruit

1154
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:25,416
And make Troma look
like public fools.

1155
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:30,355
CAMERAMAN: Hello,
Claude, you have

1156
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:45,803
To meet... [speaking french]

1157
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,646
That guy behind
me is John Reiber.

1158
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:58,249
He's the head programmer for E!

1159
00:51:58,349 --> 00:51:59,484
Entertainment.

1160
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:03,454
And thanks to him
Troma is featured on E!

1161
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:04,955
More often than not.

1162
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,425
[Gunfire]

1163
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:10,628
All right, you fucking retards.

1164
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:14,365
Drop your tacos or I'll blow
your brains out. [Laughs]

1165
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:22,307
Like so.

1166
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:23,308
CAMERAMAN: So quiet.

1167
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:24,275
So quiet.

1168
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,910
You mix it up.

1169
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:26,944
CAMERAMAN: You've got the guts.

1170
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:28,145
You've got the poo.

1171
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:29,514
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Make
sure that people

1172
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:32,417
Understand to take the poster
that's from "Citizen Toxie."

1173
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:33,551
The two of you are arm and arm.

1174
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,652
Right.

1175
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:37,222
That we are... we want
to... we are calling

1176
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:38,656
Attention to the
great American pastime

1177
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,691
Of students shooting students.

1178
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,660
This is the opening scene.

1179
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,631
The great American pasttime...
A little slice of Americana.

1180
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:47,398
Where is it?

1181
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,599
Where is it at?

1182
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:51,969
Don't spill anything on
the Carlton floor, please.

1183
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,037
Don't spill it.

1184
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:55,105
We got... we got... the
Carlton charged us

1185
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:58,509
$1,500 for blood on
the carpet, not in here

1186
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,578
I think, but somewhere else.

1187
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:01,846
I said it was dog urine.

1188
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:03,448
But they wouldn't believe me.

1189
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:04,949
But it's a $1,500 bill we got.

1190
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:06,351
So we got to be careful.
MAN: Last year?

1191
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:07,318
No, this year.

1192
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:08,386
It just came in.

1193
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:10,020
CAMERAMAN: Why do
they think it's us?

1194
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,622
What would leave
them to believe that?

1195
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,324
Because it's blood
and fecal matter.

1196
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:15,760
But we can... we're going to
try to blame it on that dog.

1197
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,630
I'm sure it's his... the
Warner Brothers dog.

1198
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,566
The movie starts in
15 minutes everybody.

1199
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,600
All right, we got to go.

1200
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,901
We got to go... got to go.

1201
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:25,636
We're going to go out and be
retarded for a little bit.

1202
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:27,338
And we're going to come
out and be like, all right,

1203
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:28,473
You fucking retards.

1204
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,308
Drop your tacos or I'll
blow your brains out.

1205
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,181
It's springtime.

1206
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:38,683
Get this one.

1207
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:39,884
Kill him.

1208
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:40,685
Fucking kill him.

1209
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:48,659
All right, where's the other
retard... the other retard.

1210
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:49,660
Get out there [inaudible].

1211
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:55,666
And that's where we'll be.

1212
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:00,671
That's right.

1213
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:01,472
That's what you get.

1214
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,176
He's dead.

1215
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,446
Dead, you retard.

1216
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:09,246
Get up.

1217
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:13,684
Hey, he got back up.

1218
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:15,152
Oh!

1219
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,854
Ahhh!

1220
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:17,655
Ahhh!

1221
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:25,496
Ahh, I can't help the way I am.

1222
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:26,531
Ha!
Ha!

1223
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:27,332
Ha!

1224
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:30,468
Ah!

1225
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:31,268
Ah!

1226
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:37,408
Ahh!

1227
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:38,208
Ahh!

1228
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:46,717
CAMERAMAN: We're just
going to leave that there?

1229
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:48,653
Yep.

1230
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:51,121
CAMERAMAN: A little
present for France.

1231
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:54,459
We're going right now to the
second screening of "Citizen"

1232
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,093
Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV."

1233
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:59,163
And everybody has been
talking about it at Cannes...

1234
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:00,998
The Cannes Film Festival.

1235
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:03,267
And it's all about the
grassroots promotion.

1236
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:05,736
And this is the opening
scene of "Citizen"

1237
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:06,871
"Toxie" we've reenacted.

1238
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:07,972
It's to hook people in
because they want to see

1239
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:08,906
What happens next, you know?

1240
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:16,414
Ahh!

1241
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,954
[Cheers]

1242
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,890
[Applause]

1243
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:32,430
And once again... once
again it is sold out.

1244
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,364
Looking good.

1245
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:36,300
It looks like it's
a hit in France.

1246
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:37,568
We're big in France.

1247
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,803
We're probably bigger than
Jerry Lewis, right Toxie?

1248
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:39,604
Rah!

1249
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:45,342
So we have another problem...
Doug has been banned once again

1250
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:51,849
From the Troma office
apparently because when

1251
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,217
He was filming for E!

1252
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:56,754
Entertainment, some blood got
on the floor of the Carlton,

1253
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,557
Not on the floor, but on
the outside... on the marble

1254
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:00,758
Where the cars come in.

1255
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,727
The other problem is the
hotel has now charged

1256
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:06,431
Us over $2,000 for damage.

1257
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:07,364
We have blood.

1258
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:08,699
They keep claiming
there was blood.

1259
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,167
MAN: Development, development.
- Oh!

1260
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:11,536
MAN: According to
Doug, the concierge

1261
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:13,037
Grabbed Doug and choked him.

1262
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:13,838
Oh, my god.

1263
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:14,739
That's terrible.

1264
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,040
Well, let's go down.

1265
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,907
What happened?
Tell me.

1266
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:17,742
What happened?

1267
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:19,410
Apparently, hang on one second.

1268
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,446
Apparently they...
According to Dough

1269
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,614
The concierge grabbed
him and choked him.

1270
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:26,116
And now he's not even allowed
on the property anything

1271
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,251
Resembling the Carlton.

1272
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:28,052
Really?

1273
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:29,787
Which one was it?

1274
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,055
Do you know which one?

1275
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:33,123
Well, why don't you... I'll
give you a pen and pencil.

1276
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,091
You write his name down.

1277
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,926
And you sue him.

1278
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:37,027
Well, we'll film him.

1279
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,196
And then you'll sue him.

1280
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:41,365
So I'm going to try to
find Doug and see what's

1281
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:45,135
Up with this problem... why
they hit him on the neck

1282
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,304
And strangled him
and try to find

1283
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,239
Out which concierge did it.

1284
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,608
Let's film it, yeah.

1285
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:51,408
Well, we'll film it.

1286
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:52,209
This guy.

1287
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,143
This guy here.

1288
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,679
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
OK, so you did it.

1289
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:55,646
He did it.

1290
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,515
Ah, ah, OK, then I shoot him.

1291
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:58,549
He choked me.

1292
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:00,485
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I can shoot him.

1293
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,520
So a Carlton person...
We'll sue you.

1294
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,955
So Doug is going to go now.

1295
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:06,457
He was just attacked
by the police...

1296
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:09,126
By the security
guards of the Carlton.

1297
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,261
Now he's going to go
and try to find out

1298
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,397
How to get to the
Commissariat of Police

1299
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:15,900
So he can make a
complaint because I

1300
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,101
Guess this guy choked him.

1301
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,969
It was not a very
nice thing to do.

1302
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:19,804
What's...

1303
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:21,405
There was blood on the carpet.

1304
00:57:21,506 --> 00:57:22,540
LLOYD KAUFMAN: But
we paid for it.

1305
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:37,888
You charged us I
don't believe it.

1306
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:38,889
I go and talk to him.

1307
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:44,228
But then we can't take
our equipment out.

1308
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:45,029
He is the packer.

1309
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:50,535
But where is the blood?

1310
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:51,669
Where is the blood?

1311
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:54,805
There was some
right here before.

1312
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:56,073
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I
don't see any blood.

1313
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:58,142
Look, over here, Toxie,
there's a little bit over here.

1314
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,213
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I
don't understand.

1315
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,314
Listen, I don't see any blood.

1316
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,415
I don't know what to say.

1317
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:07,084
It doesn't look like
a big thing here.

1318
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:08,085
It's the blood.

1319
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,419
It takes five minutes
to wipe it up.

1320
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,321
Everything takes five minutes
in the hotel... everything.

1321
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:15,660
But now I think he
went up to the limit.

1322
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,527
The gun with the...

1323
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:17,595
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's a festival.

1324
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:20,397
I mean, it's a festival
for heaven sakes.

1325
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,365
I don't understand.

1326
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:22,567
I really don't understand.

1327
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:23,367
There's nothing there.

1328
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:40,517
So the manager of the Carlton,
who is a pretty good guy.

1329
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:41,652
He just came in.

1330
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:43,453
And I explained what I
knew of the situation.

1331
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:45,990
And he agreed that the
blood on the outside,

1332
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,892
Especially since
the entertainment.

1333
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:50,127
And it's a
universal... it's owned

1334
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:51,829
By Comcast and Walt Disney.

1335
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:55,499
And it's not a bad thing for the
Cartlon to be on TV worldwide.

1336
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,002
And he agreed that
the blood is washable.

1337
00:58:58,102 --> 00:58:59,469
So what's the big deal?

1338
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,940
So I think he will let
Doug back into the hotel.

1339
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,744
But Doug may want to take
revenge against the security

1340
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:07,878
Guard, of course, I don't know.

1341
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:17,855
Some woman called my on
my cellphone saying you

1342
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:19,356
Guys were peeing on the
balcony or something.

1343
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:25,896
Oh, OK, that's good.

1344
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,565
I came back to the
condo covered in blood.

1345
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,100
And I had to carry
a bucket of guts.

1346
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,336
And everyone's yelling there's
this weird guy in the shower

1347
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:33,137
That no one knew.

1348
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,572
He followed everyone back.

1349
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:37,474
What are you doing?

1350
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,844
So, uh, what are you doing?

1351
00:59:39,944 --> 00:59:41,211
I'm just having a
fucking shower, man.

1352
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,280
Oh, my god, he's
using my fucking towel.

1353
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,415
So everyone is like what...
What are we going to do?

1354
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:46,250
What are we going to do?

1355
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,484
So I come in.

1356
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,520
I open the door, break
it down, and shove

1357
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:52,389
A baseball bat up his ass.

1358
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:53,724
MAN: He's got his baseball bat.

1359
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:54,558
MAN: Fuck off.

1360
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:55,525
I don't need to pay for that.

1361
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:57,094
You need it.

1362
00:59:57,194 --> 00:59:58,062
MAN: I don't want it.

1363
00:59:58,162 --> 00:59:59,029
Bend over.

1364
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:00,130
I don't need a baseball bat.

1365
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,465
You do.

1366
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:03,901
Look, everyone needs a baseball
bat, especially out there.

1367
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:04,869
Ahh!

1368
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:06,871
Ahhh!

1369
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:08,138
MAN: God, holy fucking shit.

1370
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:08,939
MAN: What?

1371
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:10,074
What?

1372
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:11,541
MAN: He's sticking
a bat up his ass.

1373
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,047
Ahh!

1374
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:18,015
Ahh!

1375
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,017
[Laughter]

1376
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,021
It's stuck.

1377
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,856
MAN: What the fuck?

1378
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:26,857
Ahh!

1379
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:27,658
Ahh!

1380
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:29,827
It's stuck.

1381
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:30,828
MAN: Can I go piss on him?

1382
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,029
MAN: Yeah, go piss on him.

1383
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,563
It's stuck.
MAN: He's got a bat up his ass.

1384
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:34,899
Oh!

1385
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:37,802
And Jamie, another one of
our volunteers pissed on him.

1386
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:38,969
Get in the shower.

1387
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:39,937
Get in the shower.

1388
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:41,605
MAN: Hey, let's circumsize him.

1389
01:00:41,706 --> 01:00:43,941
Yeah!

1390
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:44,775
I'm Jewish.

1391
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:47,244
I'm trained to do that, dude.

1392
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,145
MAN: You know how?

1393
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:49,479
And then we called the cops.

1394
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,647
Did I ever tell
you about the time

1395
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:52,482
I fucked the guy in
the ass with a dildo?

1396
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,151
When you're talking about
this independent spirit

1397
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:55,920
And when you first came, you
could sleep on the beach.

1398
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,287
You're finding it
harder this year,

1399
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,858
Aren't you to get the whole
Troma thing out there?

1400
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:01,992
I think it gets
harder and harder

1401
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,695
Every year for independent art.

1402
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:06,030
It is harder and
harder at Cannes.

1403
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,899
We used to be able to put
leaflets under the doors of all

1404
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,167
The rooms.

1405
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:13,337
And bit by bit, Cannes has
squeezed the independents.

1406
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:15,806
No longer are you permitted to
put leaflets under the doors.

1407
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:18,308
There's no more
leafleting of cars.

1408
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,177
Possibly due to the
giant devil worshipping

1409
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:23,213
International conglomerates
like AOL-SlimeWarner,

1410
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,115
We are losing that
independent spirit

1411
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:27,117
Because AOHELL-SlimeWarner,
in my opinion,

1412
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:29,854
Is doing everything it can to
destroy the independence, even

1413
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:32,289
To the extent of sending a
disgusting dog to this booth...

1414
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:33,090
To foul this booth.

1415
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,158
It's awful.

1416
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:35,559
CAMERAMAN: What happened
with the stickers?

1417
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:37,394
What's going on?

1418
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,163
The stickers... the
stickers and the flyers.

1419
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:41,231
We went to the Carlton
this morning to flyer...

1420
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,367
The first flyering of Troma.

1421
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:45,970
And they told us we would
be arrested if we did it.

1422
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,172
So they said we can only do it
in the lobby... put everything

1423
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:49,774
Down in the lobby and
came back an hour later

1424
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:50,607
And they took everything.

1425
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,842
They ripped it up.

1426
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:54,344
They wouldn't let
us... we came up.

1427
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:55,679
We did one floor.

1428
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,114
And a bunch of
guards chased us down

1429
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,583
And said they were going to
arrest us and have the police

1430
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:02,286
Lock us up if we kept doing it.

1431
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,289
Dave LeDon... he owns a company.

1432
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:08,525
We were putting up
flyers on his posters.

1433
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:09,794
MAN: What posters are they?

1434
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:12,897
All the posters downstairs...
The big posters... people

1435
01:02:12,997 --> 01:02:14,164
Paying thousands of dollars.

1436
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:14,965
You know?

1437
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,066
We put something on it.

1438
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,135
Pissed... this guy came
and said that he'll

1439
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:18,969
Break all of our fingers.

1440
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,175
MAN: He's going to break
our fingers and deport us.

1441
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,110
We're going to get deported.

1442
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,278
CAMERAMAN: Wait,
wait, excuse me.

1443
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:29,379
You want to see?

1444
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:30,514
You want see if you
cannot come over there?

1445
01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:31,648
CAMERAMAN: Yeah, wait.

1446
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,385
So it seems if you're
selling your own movie,

1447
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:39,356
Do not put stickers
on the big posters

1448
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:41,859
Because David feels
they are controlled

1449
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:43,593
By the Israeli mafia.

1450
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,795
And then, of course,
Israel is where

1451
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:46,196
We made "Big Gus,
What's the Fuss?"

1452
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,065
Which is the worst
movie in the world.

1453
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,167
And, uh, don't make any
movies in Israel, either,

1454
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,501
Let me tell you.

1455
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,403
The place takes... it's sucks,
that place, to make movies.

1456
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:57,574
CAMERAMAN: You're not
allowed to do that.

1457
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:58,742
[Speaking french]

1458
01:02:58,843 --> 01:03:00,377
CAMERAMAN: You can't do that.

1459
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:04,214
They won't let you hang
things on the wall.

1460
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:05,916
You're not allowed to do that.

1461
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:06,884
You're not, see.

1462
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:12,756
So another purpose
of being at Cannes

1463
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:14,658
Is to acquire the
rights to movies.

1464
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:20,097
And we want to acquire the
rights to the new Argento film.

1465
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:23,733
So now that most of the business
is done or the lack of business

1466
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:29,006
Is done, I am going to try to
go to the office of the lady who

1467
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:31,575
Handles Argento's movies.

1468
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:33,510
And I'm going to
make her an offer

1469
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,380
That she will definitely be
able to refuse because it

1470
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,614
Will be a very low offer.

1471
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:43,087
Troma is sitting here in
the back of the restaurant.

1472
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:48,558
And, meanwhile, the lady from
Warner Brothers with the front

1473
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,960
Rooms at the Carlton.

1474
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,295
She is out there in the sun.

1475
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:52,863
The sun are the prestige.

1476
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:57,434
The front tables are the
prestige tables here.

1477
01:03:57,534 --> 01:04:00,270
And we couldn't possibly
be any further back.

1478
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,571
[Zombie growl]

1479
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,574
[Screams]

1480
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:14,218
YANIV SHARON: There we go.

1481
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,821
Well, this is it... the
night of the big, red carpet

1482
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:19,323
On the crossed set.

1483
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:28,432
The Troma Team is here!

1484
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,833
Can we come in?

1485
01:04:29,934 --> 01:04:31,668
No, it's not possible.

1486
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:32,502
Why is not possible?

1487
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:33,537
- Where is it?
- Not with...

1488
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:34,338
No?

1489
01:04:34,438 --> 01:04:35,305
No, no, no.

1490
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:36,106
No?

1491
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,242
[Speaking french]

1492
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:40,210
This is no good?

1493
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,345
What about this one?

1494
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:43,180
Toxie, show them yours.

1495
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,181
Yours has got to be good.

1496
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:45,015
You're the Toxic Avenger.

1497
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,816
Toxie, get in there.

1498
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,152
Toxie!

1499
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:48,953
Toxie!

1500
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:51,255
Toxie, you go.

1501
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:52,256
We're not allowed in?

1502
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:53,757
We're the Troma Team.

1503
01:04:53,857 --> 01:04:56,560
Look, these people
are going to get in.

1504
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,361
Yo!

1505
01:04:57,461 --> 01:04:59,696
That guy just snuck in.

1506
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:00,897
That guy just snuck in.

1507
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:01,698
I swear to god.

1508
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:02,699
You stop, or police.

1509
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,335
Your choice... the
police, or stop.

1510
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,137
I will stop, but
listen, that guy.

1511
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:08,805
Police.

1512
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,508
Listen, a guy just
snuck in right there.

1513
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:12,842
Sorry.

1514
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:14,711
No, [inaudible].

1515
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:16,113
You need to ask the police?

1516
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:17,948
No, listen, we are done.

1517
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:18,782
You're going.

1518
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:20,084
We are done.

1519
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:21,785
OK, stop.

1520
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:23,220
Listen, the guy
just snuck in, man.

1521
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:29,593
Are we allowed in here?

1522
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:31,528
Are there cocktails
in here, everybody?

1523
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:32,997
Is this cocktail hour?

1524
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:34,931
Cocktails here?

1525
01:05:35,032 --> 01:05:36,400
Yes?

1526
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,867
Oh, look it!

1527
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:39,336
The red carpet!

1528
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,804
Oh, my god!

1529
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:42,306
If I only I could see.

1530
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,611
(SINGING) Troma sneaks in
the back way, sneaks in.

1531
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:50,280
I'm going to check three out.

1532
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,081
Come on, guys.

1533
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:52,582
We'll fit.

1534
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:53,417
We'll fit.

1535
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:55,185
Oh.

1536
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:55,986
Toxie.

1537
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:58,188
Come in and just squeeze in.

1538
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,756
Dolphin Man.

1539
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,425
Snap, ah!

1540
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:02,559
The end of the Troma team.

1541
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:03,360
Where are we?

1542
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,629
Is this a car?

1543
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:07,964
Are we in a car, everybody?

1544
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:09,533
CAMERAMAN: Oh, we keep
on going down, you know?

1545
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:10,734
MAN: There you go.

1546
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:14,204
No, I pressed the up, 0,
1, 0, and then we stopped.

1547
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,305
CAMERAMAN: We know
the elevator...

1548
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:16,206
They have a camera in here.

1549
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,474
So we stopped it.

1550
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:18,708
And there's going to be police.

1551
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,876
MAN: Oh, my god.

1552
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,878
Look at this elevator
full right now.

1553
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,347
Yeah, Troma!

1554
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:24,414
We're fucking stuck.

1555
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:25,915
So I probably leaned
on the stop button.

1556
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:26,983
Holy shit.

1557
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:28,885
Press emergency.

1558
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,487
I'm claustrophobic.
I'm suffocating.

1559
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:31,321
Oh, my god, dude.

1560
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:32,122
You press three?

1561
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:34,224
I pressed all of them.

1562
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,659
CAMERAMAN: Oh, my god, guys.

1563
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:37,094
- Press another button.
- Push the alarm.

1564
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:38,162
Push the alarm or something.

1565
01:06:38,262 --> 01:06:39,063
Press the button.

1566
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,030
I don't want to.

1567
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,398
We're going to
fucking get ejected.

1568
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,599
YANIV SHARON: So
we'll get ejected.

1569
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:46,303
Somebody press the damn
button, for Christ sakes.

1570
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:49,973
Well, we snuck in the back
way for the red carpet.

1571
01:06:50,074 --> 01:06:52,076
And instead of getting
to the red carpet,

1572
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:53,510
We're stuck in an elevator.

1573
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:56,946
The entire Troma Team
is stuck in an elevator.

1574
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:58,882
WOMAN: No, it's too [inaudible].

1575
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:01,885
Listen, listen, shush,
shush, is there an alarm?

1576
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:02,686
This is kind of scary.

1577
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:03,653
But it doesn't work.

1578
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:04,654

1580
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:06,590
CAMERAMAN: Oh, my god.

1581
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:07,391
Help!

1582
01:07:10,927 --> 01:07:12,796
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So we
get to go to the...

1583
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:16,233
To the big, red carpet.

1584
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:19,103
We finally scored some tickets.

1585
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:22,372
Some guy in a restaurant named
Emmanuel gave us tickets.

1586
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,608
Here we are since...
It's the first time

1587
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:29,279
I think since 1971... 1971.

1588
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,981
We have to... we're not allowed
to film here apparently.

1589
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:33,250
It's a top security.

1590
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,153
It's like the Chinese or
something... Chinese spy plane.

1591
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:38,888
So I have to close the camera
because god forbid anyone

1592
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,591
Should film in the salumiere.

1593
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:42,826
So I am closing the camera.

1594
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,294
WOMAN: Well, they could
be copying the film.

1595
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,495
It makes sense.
Well, it's ridiculous.

1596
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:46,296
It's absurd.

1597
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,364
It's a freedom of the press.

1598
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:48,498
It's absurd.
WOMAN: No, no, no.

1599
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:49,633
People could be
taking cameras in.

1600
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:50,967
Oh, to hell with it.
Come on.

1601
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:51,968
It's ridiculous.

1602
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,137
At any rate, I'm
putting this thing away.

1603
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,438
It's a terrible thing.

1604
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:58,508
But I have to put my whole
briefcase so, anyway, ciao!

1605
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:02,846
Well, we lasted about a
half hour in this movie.

1606
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:04,714
And it really sucked.

1607
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,850
And it was unbelievably boring.

1608
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:10,354
And you can probably see
behind me people are leaving.

1609
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:12,656
You cannot imagine how
boring this movie was.

1610
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,391
Look at these people
behind me that are leaving.

1611
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:16,993
I mean, people are just
streaming out of this place.

1612
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,795
The movie sucks.

1613
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:20,130

WOMAN: Oh, god, this
is a little scary.

1618
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,303
I don't think we should
be yelling Troma right now.

1619
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,705
All right, they
know we're in here.

1620
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:30,674
CAMERAMAN: How long
have we been in here?

1621
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:31,975
About 20 minutes, I think.

1622
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:33,143
CAMERAMAN: 20 minutes?

1623
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:33,943
Something like that.

1624
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,044
It seems like an eternity.

1625
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:35,845
It's not working.

01:08:40,484 --> 01:08:42,419
Say, why aren't
you getting us out?

1628
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:43,387
What's the difference?

1629
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:44,721
There's fucking
20 people in here.

1630
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:45,522
Tell him that.

1631
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:47,056
[Speaking french]

1632
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,996
Please shut up now.

1633
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:55,699
We are 10 or 12.

1634
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:56,966
Therefore it's stuck.

1635
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:57,967
And that's why it's too heavy.

HEIDI SJURSEN: I know.

1637
01:08:58,868 --> 01:08:59,736
But we're stuck.

1638
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:03,139
Now can they care...
Just get us out.

1639
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,007
You know what I mean?

1640
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:05,809
Why do they keep
asking how many?

1641
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,477
Like, OK, yeah, we fucked up.
But get us out of here.

1642
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:08,445
MAN: We need a
crane or something.

1643
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:09,446
Yeah, I'd laugh at a crane.

1644
01:09:09,546 --> 01:09:10,714
Can you ask him to
get us out and how

1645
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:11,581

Ah, victory.

1649
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:39,943
Who has the invitations?

1650
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:41,778
We'd like to invite you to
our parties to make up for it.

1651
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:43,380
Come to our party.

1652
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,881
Thank you for saving us.

1653
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:45,682
We have a party, come.

1654
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:47,517
Everyone, come to our party.

1655
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:48,452
Thank you.

1656
01:09:48,552 --> 01:09:49,819

just... we're in an elevator

1661
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:04,200
For the last half hour.

1662
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:05,302
And we called Scott to help us.

1663
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:07,604
And Scott thought
he was joking...

1664
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,038
He thought we were joking.

1665
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:10,407
So he's like, yeah, right.
Yeah, right.

1666
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:11,841
He's talking around a
cellphone at a party.

1667
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,844
And he's like, ah,
yeah, OK, yeah, oh, hi!

1668
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:15,912
Hi, how are you?

1669
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:17,281
Hold on a second.

1670
01:10:17,381 --> 01:10:19,516
He puts girl on the phone to
have a conversation with John

1671
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:22,686
Who are yelling, Scott, if you
do not come here and help us,

1672
01:10:22,786 --> 01:10:24,588
We're going to punch you
next time we see you.

1673
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:32,829
People ask why do we bother
to give the parties at Cannes?

1674
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:33,863
That's a good question.

1675
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:36,900
But the reason is
that buyers come.

1676
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,535
And film buyers
are the people who

1677
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:39,936
Give you money for your movies.

1678
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:43,573
And if you can give them a good
time that the film buyers can

1679
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:49,579
Have some fun and dance with
some Tromettes and Dolphin Man,

1680
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,148
That is a reason for
them to come back

1681
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,584
And do business with Troma.

1682
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,587
So it's not as
stupid as it looks.

1683
01:10:57,687 --> 01:11:02,292
Now, we are going
to the Troma party...

1684
01:11:02,392 --> 01:11:04,193
The hot ticket of Cannes.

1685
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:08,398
So, again, we unlike other
parties, most of these parties

1686
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:12,602
Cost about $50,000 to
$100,000, even a small party.

1687
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:15,071
Troma has managed
to get sponsors.

1688
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:15,872
The Troma party!

CAMERAMAN: Have you made
a lot of money for Troma?

1691
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:38,595
I think I paid for the suites.

1692
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:40,830
And I just did a
deal now that'll pay

1693
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,098
For Lloyd's seersucker suit.

1694
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:43,633
CAMERAMAN: You're working
while you play, huh?

1695
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:44,768
Of course, I have to.

1696
01:11:44,868 --> 01:11:46,135
There's a freaking huge
line, choke line, dude.

1697
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:54,043
Apparently, we can't get
our people into the party

1698
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,646
Because there's too
many people in there.

1699
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:58,014
I think we gave out
too many invitations.

1700
01:11:58,114 --> 01:12:00,116
I worked for Troma in '96.

Greg Radin, hey!

1707
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:11,695
Scott told me not to let anyone
in because it's too crowded.

1708
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:13,697
But Lloyd would let me in.

Stockton Film Festival.

Yeah, I know.

1711
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,035
Everyone wants to get in.

1712
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:20,370
This is fucking mess.

1713
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,839
I mean, this is, you know,
one thing Troma I really think

1714
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:25,375
Stands for is like, you know,
helping the people who helped

1715
01:12:25,475 --> 01:12:26,843
Them, you know, we give back.

1716
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:29,746
And when we see our people stuck
behind these lines, that really

1717
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,347
Kind of rubs me the wrong way.

1718
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:34,183
I mean, the Troma people
have been giving the time

1719
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:37,521
And paid money to fly out
here to the middle of France.

1720
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:40,023
And they're stuck back there in
the lines like everyone else,

a venue to incorporate, um, uh,

1742

Characters and creatures to come
together and express themselves

1743
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:18,387
Through art and allow t hem
to be art that they are,

1744
01:14:18,488 --> 01:14:22,726
Considering that for the most
part, they have been outsiders,

1745
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:27,296
But in being outsiders, it
has created within their minds

1746
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:35,304
And their systems to be
more enveloped and superior

01:15:29,993 --> 01:15:32,295
Has really won the hearts and
minds of just about everybody

1751
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:33,663
At Cannes.

1752
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:36,966
It's incredible, especially the
people from Warner Brothers.

1753
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,271
All right, that's
a wrap for tonight.

1754
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,406
We'll be here all week.

1755
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:48,477
I don't know that I
have anything else in me.

1756
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:49,412
CAMERAMAN: That's all right.

1757
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:50,714
You're doing a good job.

1758
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:54,250
So uh, yeah, this is, uh,
the end of the Troma party.

1759
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:57,120
And this is one of
the last guys left.

1760
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,456
He had a little bit too much
fun... just a little bit.

1761
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,424
Paramedics.

1762
01:16:01,524 --> 01:16:02,258
We have paramedics here.

1763
01:16:02,358 --> 01:16:03,326
Paramedics, hello.

1764
01:16:03,426 --> 01:16:04,427
We have a guy
drunk off his ass.

1765
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:11,067
LLOYD KAUFMAN: The Troma party
last night was successful.

1766
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:13,169
There seemed to be some buyers.

1767
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:15,438
There seemed to be
quite a bit of media.

1768
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:18,541
There was one sour note in
that some kind of fisticuffs

1769
01:16:18,642 --> 01:16:24,013
Broke out between Doug
Sakmann and Scott McKinley...

1770
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:25,615
Two of the Troma employees.

1771
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:28,184
I've been begging Doug
to... pleading with Doug

1772
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:35,625
To curb his turbo-obnoxious
behavior that had just been,

1773
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:37,994
Again, off the
charts, even for Doug.

1774
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,663
LLOYD KAUFMAN: But, Tasty,
what happened... tell us

1775
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:41,297
About Scott McKinley and Doug.

1776
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:42,598
What happened?

1777
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,734
Well, because Doug doesn't
know when to stop sometimes.

1778
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:46,936
Doug will take things
a little too far.

1779
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:49,538
Doug was like baiting the
fuck out of Scott McKinley.

1780
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:51,607
That's... mean, I
don't even understand

1781
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:54,443
How Big Tasty would say that
because Scott was never there.

1782
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:59,048
All week long I was, you know,
I was sort of... I was the, you

1783
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:01,117
Know, it was the
proverbial seltzer bottle

1784
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:02,585
That was just
continually being shook

1785
01:17:02,686 --> 01:17:03,987
And shook and shook until...

1786
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:07,691
I was never... there was never
Scott around for me to shake.

1787
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,625
Finally the night of the
party at the end of the party,

1788
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:10,727
Someone undid the cap.

1789
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:11,761
You're choking me.

1790
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,296
I'm telling someone
else to do work.

1791
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:15,031
I'm not even telling
you to do work.

1792
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,565
And you're choking me.

1793
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,534
And then someone
turned on the camera.

1794
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,704
And we were yelling
about the champagne.

1795
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:23,572
And the rest is caught on tape.

1796
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:26,242
What are you talking
about champagne?

1797
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:27,476
You wouldn't give
me a fucking bottle

1798
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:28,678
Of champagne [inaudible].

1799
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:31,047
[Inaudible]

1800
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,481
Wait, why is there [inaudible]?

1801
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:41,725
I just... I grabbed him
and tried to, uh, um,

1802
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:43,192
Move his tattoos.

1803
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:44,660
You can't fight, okay?

1804
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:46,629
No fighting.

1805
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,630
CAMERAMAN: Oh, shit.

1806
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:52,535
Oh.

1807
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:55,004
Oh, shit.

1808
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:58,007
Are you taping that?

1809
01:17:58,107 --> 01:17:58,808
CAMERAMAN: Fuck.

1810
01:17:58,908 --> 01:17:59,608
You are my girlfriend.

1811
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:01,778
And you are my boyfriend.

1812
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:05,014
But I was, uh, I guess
someone stepped in.

1813
01:18:05,114 --> 01:18:06,582
And that was the end of it.

1814
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:07,851
So there was little
ballroom dance.

1815
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:11,054
And then we went to our
respective corners and...

1816
01:18:11,154 --> 01:18:14,223
Like in the process,
Scott threw a girl down.

1817
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:15,024
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Jennifer.

1818
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:16,192
Just an amazing scene.

1819
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:17,460
It was like one of
the weirdest things

1820
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,695
I have ever seen
because it was real.

1821
01:18:19,796 --> 01:18:20,596
Ah, let's see.

1822
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,365
What was the outcome?

1823
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:23,900
You know, I left.

1824
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,404
And, uh, um, you know,
I guess the outcome

1825
01:18:28,504 --> 01:18:32,141
Was, um, you know,
finally Doug and I

1826
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:34,343
Publicly didn't get along.

1827
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,379
I am at the edge of my seat.

1828
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:38,982
I guess there was a lot
of huffing and puffing

1829
01:18:39,082 --> 01:18:41,384
Because I know Doug
professes himself

1830
01:18:41,484 --> 01:18:44,153
To be quite the man's man.

1831
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:45,955
So should I beat
the shit out of him?

1832
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:46,756
Hey!

1833
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:48,191
He's walking away.

1834
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:50,093
Scott walked away.

1835
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:51,861
I win!

1836
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:53,963
Come back.

1837
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,398
I wasn't ready.

1838
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,300
Now I'm ready.

1839
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,534
Scott McKinley!

1840
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:02,105
Scott McKinley.

1841
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:04,507
Pussy!

1842
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:06,910
Pussy!

1843
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:09,345
Scott, come back.

1844
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:10,679
I'm going to punch
you in the face,

1845
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,082
Knock you out, and then
fuck you in the ass.

1846
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:17,453
That Doug guy... I mean, do
they get any cooler than Doug.

1847
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:18,654
I mean, he's so cool.

1848
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,424
He's actually got Troma tattoos.

1849
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:23,559
Now, how cool.

1850
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:24,794
You don't know Scott.
I know Scott.

1851
01:19:24,894 --> 01:19:26,395
Yeah, well that motherfucker
pushed me on the ground.

1852
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:27,530
He choked me.

1853
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,832
I don't give a fuck
if he choked you.

1854
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:29,632
But I do.

1855
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:30,733
Wait, you both hate him.

1856
01:19:30,834 --> 01:19:31,634
You both hate him.

1857
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:32,836
I don't know him.

1858
01:19:32,936 --> 01:19:34,037
He threw me on the ground.

1859
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:36,005
Let's get the shit and go
because all I want to do

1860
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,206
Is go home.

1861
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:39,175
Scott McKinley is a pussy.

1862
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,609
Scott McDouche.

1863
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,813
Indeed, I think Troma
had made its decision.

1864
01:19:43,913 --> 01:19:46,749
They were... they were
siding with Doug.

1865
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:50,053
And why doesn't
that surprise me?

1866
01:19:50,153 --> 01:19:53,056
Unfortunately, when you give
a party, things go wrong.

1867
01:19:53,156 --> 01:19:55,324
And you piss off friends.

1868
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:57,894
And, unfortunately,
we managed to piss

1869
01:19:57,994 --> 01:20:01,998
Off not only a friend, but the
person for whom we are working.

1870
01:20:02,098 --> 01:20:04,733
It is none other than
Johann, who is a producer

1871
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:06,302
Of parts of the family.

1872
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:08,071
So what happened,
Johann at the party?

1873
01:20:08,171 --> 01:20:12,641
So we were standing
with four other people.

1874
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:14,477
And we were standing there
waiting for three quarters

1875
01:20:14,577 --> 01:20:17,847
Of an hour trying to get in.

1876
01:20:17,947 --> 01:20:22,852
And, um, all of a sudden
Scott McKinley comes up.

1877
01:20:22,952 --> 01:20:26,155
And I say, oh, yeah,
that goes knows me.

1878
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:29,592
I say, OK, let's say,
I want... let me in.

1879
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:30,793
You know me.

1880
01:20:30,894 --> 01:20:33,296
Oh, no, he says, you're
10 to 15 minutes too late.

1881
01:20:33,396 --> 01:20:34,763
And I said, what
the hell's going on?

1882
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:38,401
A few people standing next
to me... they say to McKinley,

1883
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:41,337
Oh, hi, we met in a restaurant
two or three days ago.

1884
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:42,338
Oh, yeah, right.

1885
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:44,073
He opens the gate
and lets them in.

1886
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,875
So that blew me
through the roof.

1887
01:20:45,975 --> 01:20:48,878
And then I took my
phone and called MH.

1888
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:50,846
But I had a machine.

1889
01:20:50,947 --> 01:20:51,881
And you listen to the machine.

1890
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:53,116
Then you hear about
pissed off I was.

1891
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:54,717
JOHANN (ON VOICEMAIL):
Johann from Belgium...

1892
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:59,422
I'm currently standing in
front of the party in Cannes.

1893
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:02,625
And we don't get in.

1894
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:05,194
Scott McKinley knows me,
looks me in the eyes,

1895
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:07,430
And doesn't let me
and my party in.

1896
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,566
People he met in a restaurant
were standing next to me.

1897
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,335
He let them in.

1898
01:21:12,435 --> 01:21:15,671
And me and my party came in.

1899
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:18,141
And Scott McKinley looks at me.

1900
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:18,975
Don't let me in.

1901
01:21:19,075 --> 01:21:21,344
Acts as I am complete dirt.

1902
01:21:21,444 --> 01:21:24,847
And this is completely
out of... out of control.

1903
01:21:24,948 --> 01:21:27,783
And if this the way to act.

1904
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,552
I think that's very indecent.

1905
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:34,023
And I'm very, very, very,
very, very, very, angry.

1906
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:36,993
And as you can hear
from what I'm saying,

1907
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:38,928
This is embarrassing.

1908
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:43,766
And to be honest, I don't
want to get in anymore.

1909
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:47,903
And tomorrow I will go and
really at the... in the office.

1910
01:21:48,004 --> 01:21:48,837
Thank you very much.

1911
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:50,273
I hope Michael Herz gets this.

1912
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:52,241
I'm tired of this.

1913
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:55,111
Really, Scott McKinley
can go to fuck.

1914
01:21:55,211 --> 01:21:57,880
And, of course, this
message naturally

1915
01:21:57,981 --> 01:22:01,985
Was left for Patrick Gallahoo,
has nothing to do with Cannes

1916
01:22:02,085 --> 01:22:05,654
Distribution or
any other reason.

1917
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,257
OK.

1918
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:09,292
Hello?

1919
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:11,060
Hey, good party,
thank you very much.

1920
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,860
Good job.

1921
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:13,462
It was great... excellent.

1922
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:14,830
Yep.

1923
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:15,931
That's all right, what else?

1924
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:17,333
What do you want/ I
know you just woke up.

1925
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,835
So I know you feel guilty
about sleeping so late while

1926
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,070
Everyone else is working.

1927
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:22,938
But it's OK, Scott, don't worry.
It's OK.

1928
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:23,739
It's OK.

1929
01:22:23,839 --> 01:22:25,208
You're special.

1930
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:26,509
You're very special.

1931
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,377
You're like a higher class
person than everybody else.

1932
01:22:28,477 --> 01:22:29,545
But please thank Stephanie.

01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,914

take advantage of publicity

01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:49,632
Someone has just handed me the
bill for the Troma, Carlton,

All the love you can
love chapel... two doors.

1940
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:55,738
They gave it to me because
they felt I was the boss.

1947
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:11,720
CAMERAMAN: I can't read it.

That's Scott.

1952
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:20,929
I have one thing to tell you.

1953
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,832
See that post over there... your
big Recycle S'il Vous Plait.

Oh, look, we broke
the phone too.

Oh, shit.

Gosh, Doug, you really got me.

Boy, you know, breaking
the recycling signs.

1972

Oh, when will it end?

Geez, I mean the
guy is so clever.

1975
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:40,176
All right, today,
Canal+, which, uh,

Is pretty the Fox of France Or?

You know, is major network.

Troma, of course.

CAMERAMAN: One closing remark,
Lloyd, any closing remarks?

1990
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,422
Well, I think the
key is that art that

1991
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:37,560
Was supreme independent
cinema triumphs once again...

1992
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,762
And, um, Troma!

1993
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:42,998
Troma is very grateful to all
the many fans and the people

1994
01:26:43,098 --> 01:26:47,202
At Cannes who have made Troma
beloved in the world of art.

Of Carlton... Doug is
apparently completely in charge

1998

Of everything at Cannes.

1999
01:27:38,654 --> 01:27:42,190
What do you see, uh, Cannes
being like for Troma this year?

2000
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:44,760
Well, my father used to tell
me if you want to know what

2001
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,128
Someone's going to
do tomorrow, look

2002

At what they've done yesterday
because people don't change.

2003
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,867
So I would think we
have lots of excitement

come up with very

um, well-received ideas
