00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,723
<i>It is an exciting night
tonight</i>

3
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:24,847
<i>here at the 2018 American
Sports Awards.</i>

4
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:29,485
<i>From the basketball court
to the ice rink,</i>

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,854
<i>from the ski slopes
to the gridiron.</i>

6
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:33,656
<i>All of your favorite athletes</i>

7
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:35,371
<i>are walking the red carpet
with us tonight.</i>

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,929
And here we have champion
downhill skier, Justin O'Neill,

9
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:41,709
fresh off his 2nd place showing
on the hit show,

10
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,365
"Celebrity Fox Trot."

11
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:44,934
- Justin.
- Hi Maggie.

12
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,103
- How are you doing?
- I'm great.

13
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,338
<i>Justin,
your first nomination</i>

14
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:52,041
<i>for Favorite Male Athlete,
since your big win in Japan.</i>

15
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:53,854
Yeah. Well, I know it's
a bit of a cliché, Maggie,

16
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:56,212
but it really is an honor
just to be nominated.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,547
<i>Be honest, you wouldn't mind
having that award</i>

18
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,461
<i>on your bookshelf with all
the other medals and trophies.</i>

19
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:02,418
<i>Winning isn't everything,
Maggie.</i>

20
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,320
<i>Except on the mountain.</i>

21
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:06,308
- Good luck tonight, Justin.
- Thank you, Maggie.

22
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,330
Anna.

23
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,765
Give me some good news.

24
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,533
<i>I wish I could, Justin.</i>

25
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,201
<i>Niels is out.</i>

26
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:22,071
Can't believe Neils quit.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,839
We'll find you a new coach.

28
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,708
I don't want a new coach,
I want my old coach.

29
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:28,455
Did you tell him I'm done
with physical therapy?

30
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,179
I'm cleared to start
training again?

31
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:32,126
He doesn't think that he can
get you back into shape

32
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,228
in time for the Winter Classic,
but do not be discouraged.

33
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:36,396
I can't start racing without
a coach. I've been out a year.

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,888
I have irons in the fire.

35
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:40,623
Irons in the fire.

36
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:43,225
But why aren't you packed?
We're leaving in the morning.

37
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:45,528
You know, maybe I should wait.
Find a new coach,

38
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,496
train for a few months
and then I'll be ready.

39
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:49,498
You grew up on
Winter Mountain, Justin.

40
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,111
It's the perfect place
for your comeback.

41
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:53,002
People back home...

42
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:54,970
they expect a lot from me.

43
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:57,117
And you'll deliver
when you take first in the Classic.

44
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:58,774
Plus, all those
endorsement deals

45
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,743
are gonna come rushing back.
Trust me,

46
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:02,878
this is not my first rodeo.

47
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,848
Now, eat, finish packing,

48
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:07,383
while I go work the phones.

49
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,485
Create some buzz.

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,220
I'm picking you up at 9:00.

51
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,991
Back to Winter Mountain.

52
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:17,526
<i>And it's gonna be great.</i>

53
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,979
The hometown hero has arrived.

54
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:38,814
I can see the headline already.

55
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,382
You ready to take
your first run?

56
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,851
Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:43,819
But I need to go say hi
to my parents first.

58
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:45,354
- See you in a bit.
- Alright.

59
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:58,634
...were a great idea.

60
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,736
We can get one more display
over by the fireplace.

61
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,151
So is this where
you go to lodge a complaint

62
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:06,709
about the lodge?

63
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,814
Well, look who's finally home.

64
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,283
Hi Mom. Dad.

65
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:15,951
Good to see you, Justin.
How's the knee?

66
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,453
- Fully recovered.
- Range of motion?

67
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,555
- 100%.
- You run a black diamond yet?

68
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,690
- Today.
- You look good.

69
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:23,525
We haven't seen you
since Austria.

70
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,427
We don't talk about Austria,
Mom.

71
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:27,830
In my mind, Austria doesn't
even exist anymore.

72
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:29,498
I've completely blocked it out.

73
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:31,901
Hey. Everyone takes a spill.

74
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,147
You should've seen your father
after the Swiss Downhill in '84

75
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,537
I know. I know.

76
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,284
And I still took first
in that championship.

77
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:39,909
You just get back on the horse,
like I did, all will be well.

78
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:42,745
- That's my plan.
- Good.

79
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,246
How about some cocoa?

80
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:46,282
Your dad bought this fancy
new machine

81
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:48,284
- for the lobby's happy hour.
- Absolutely.

82
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:52,554
Extra marshmallows.

83
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,024
Plying me with my favorite
things?

84
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:56,558
I'll bake you
a key lime pie, too,

85
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:58,394
if it'll get you home
more often.

86
00:03:58,462 --> 00:04:00,195
It could work.

87
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:02,031
There you are.

88
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,199
I got you a 2:00 p.m.
radio interview.

89
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:06,435
Great.
You remember Anna, my manager?

90
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,004
- Of course. Sit down.
- Hi.

91
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:11,607
- I'll get you some cocoa.
- Thanks, but I'm off sugar.

92
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,575
So what's the status
of the new coach?

93
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:15,778
That's the important
thing here, huh?

94
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:18,547
A coach before interviews.
I can make a few calls...

95
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:20,449
Now, we have a few irons
in the fire, right?

96
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:24,031
- That's right, lots of irons.
- So who are you thinking of?

97
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,654
How's the auction coming
along, Mom?

98
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,335
She runs a fundraiser
during the Carnival.

99
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,959
I'm looking forward to it.

100
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:32,275
In fact, Kayla has helped us
get some great auction items.

101
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:34,997
Have you... seen her yet?

102
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:36,231
No. Not yet.

103
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:40,703
You should drop by the ski
school and say hi.

104
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:44,440
I will. At some point.

105
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:46,108
Old... family friend.

106
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,712
Kayla Green.
Best ski instructor we've got

107
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,825
if you're interested in some
lessons while you're here.

108
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,427
- Martin Green's daughter.
- Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:54,883
He was my coach.

110
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:56,385
Justin mentioned that.

111
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:58,120
You've got quite
the legacy here.

112
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:59,989
Skiing is in our blood.

113
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:02,992
Speaking of,

114
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,327
I am gonna go get that run in,
before the interview.

115
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,973
Look out!

116
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,812
Little rug-rat.

117
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:03,085
Hey, I'm so sorry about them.
Are you okay?

118
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:06,288
Justin.

119
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:09,391
Hi, Kay.

120
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,530
Why do you look like
you've just seen a ghost?

121
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,131
Well, I wasn't expecting
to see you yet.

122
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,033
The Winter Classic isn't
for another week.

123
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:20,135
Are you a ghost?

124
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:22,571
Not that I know of.

125
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:24,106
Why do you ask?

126
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,375
Well, you just kind of
disappeared like Poof!

127
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,378
- You know?
- Right.

128
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:31,580
Yep. All me.
Flesh and blood.

129
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,349
So where is...
where's Niels?

130
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,887
I'm not training
with Niels right now.

131
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,691
So, how you been Kay?

132
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,526
I mean, evidently
not as good as you.

133
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,161
You know, magazine covers,
profiles,

134
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,908
the Arctic Skin Thermals
commercial last year.

135
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:50,265
That was something.
But can you tell me the...

136
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:54,103
yeah, the arm flex?
Was that your idea or...?

137
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:55,771
That wasn't mine...

138
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,408
completely.

139
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:01,610
Lot of comments on social
media about it.

140
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:03,712
Are you cyber-stalking me?

141
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:05,881
I'm flattered.

142
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,883
I just hope it's still
about the skiing for you

143
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:10,452
and not the notoriety.

144
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:12,454
It's always about the skiing,
Kay.

145
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,857
Well, you better get back
to skiing,

146
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:17,459
because you just got smoked
by a bunch of 12 year-olds.

147
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,397
- Bye.
- Yeah. See ya.

148
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,536
That went well.

149
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,190
Okay, on Thursday we're gonna
hit an intermediate,

150
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,014
so I want you to get lots
of sleep, okay?

151
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,682
Okay. Good job today.

152
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,720
<i>What took you so long?</i>

153
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,989
You didn't fall again, did you?

154
00:07:47,057 --> 00:07:49,458
No. I just

155
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,293
ran into an old friend.

156
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,195
So that's the infamous
Kayla Green.

157
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,097
I mean, I don't know
about infamous.

158
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,277
I mean, legendary, maybe,
but I don't wanna overshoot it.

159
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:59,301
Kayla, this is my manager, Anna.

160
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:01,003
Hey. Nice to meet you.

161
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:02,704
You've done a good job with him.

162
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,640
Thank you.

163
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:06,553
I mean, not many skiers
become a household name.

164
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:08,143
- It's true.
- Yeah. Sure they do.

165
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:10,056
And now, you're on track to
be the youngest winner ever.

166
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,114
Not ever.

167
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:13,882
Because of that guy.

168
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:15,551
Yeah. He still holds
the record.

169
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:17,386
Winning the Classic
at only 19 years-old.

170
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:18,587
I'm already 20.

171
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:19,788
Here. One sec, eh?

172
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,390
<i>Justin O'Neill.</i>

173
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:24,059
Dude, I'm not worthy.

174
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,696
I... I'm sorry, Hunter Davies.

175
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,331
Big fan.

176
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:30,832
I've... I've seen you ski.

177
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:32,501
Looks like you're gonna
give us all a run

178
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:34,069
for our money up there.

179
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:36,305
I just can't believe I'm
gonna be racing against you.

180
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,640
I used to have this guy's
poster on my wall as a kid!

181
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:41,076
<i>You were the best there is.</i>

182
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:43,545
<i>I remember, when I first saw
you on TV,</i>

183
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,048
Years, and years,
and god, years ago...

184
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,850
and my dad let me stay up
until 2:00 a.m.

185
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:51,153
just to watch you ski,
live, in Japan.

186
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:53,222
That was...
that was a great race.

187
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,957
It was good meeting you.

188
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,432
I guess, I'll see you up
on the hill.

189
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,126
Yeah. Cool.

190
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,162
Hey, I'd buy you a beer,
But I'm not old enough.

191
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:01,797
So anyways,
catch you later, man.

192
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:04,766
Catch you later.

193
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:07,135
I'll get to you this week,
too, Justin. Big comeback?

194
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:08,937
We're all excited to see
how it goes.

195
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:10,439
Absolutely.
Any time.

196
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,107
You've got Anna's number.

197
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:16,812
You know that that's
just noise, right?

198
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:20,126
Remember what my dad used
to say about the press,

199
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,595
"Let them say what
they're gonna say...

200
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:23,619
and keep on skiing."

201
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:25,454
I forgot all about that.

202
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,029
Here is your schedule
for tomorrow.

203
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,342
You've got the Ainsley twins
again.

204
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,266
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm gonna buy you lunch.

205
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:39,935
- You are a slippery one.
- I'm slippery?

206
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:42,070
When were you gonna tell me
about your little run-in

207
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:43,305
with Justin O'Neill?

208
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,873
How do you know about that?

209
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:46,508
I can see it all over your face.

210
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:48,677
Gossip travels at the speed
of light around here.

211
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,712
- Yeah.
- And it wasn't a run-in,

212
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:52,414
it was an encounter
and it was fine.

213
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:54,983
Oh no, okay, hold on.

214
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,819
Why are you not furious
with him?

215
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,254
I'm still mad at Jason Gregory

216
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,089
for ditching me
at the 5th grade dance

217
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,724
and what Justin did
was way worse.

218
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,893
He didn't do anything.
Except for maybe radio silence

219
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:07,496
- for the past few years.
- Oh, come on.

220
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,075
You were going out on
the circuit together,

221
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:10,832
like Dad and Tom.

222
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,868
He had the chance to be
coached by Niels Rediger.

223
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,481
I wasn't about to hold him
back from that.

224
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:16,786
And I what... I didn't have
a professional track record.

225
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,041
Dad taught us everything
we know.

226
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,109
That's your track record.

227
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:23,111
And he loved watching
you coach Justin,

228
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:24,913
seeing you follow
in his footsteps.

229
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:26,626
Yeah, and if he were here
with me right now,

230
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,361
he would love watching me
run the school with you

231
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:30,686
and carrying on his
and Mom's legacy.

232
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:33,388
In that way I'm happy.
Justin's happy.

233
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,857
We're... we're just happy
people.

234
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:39,005
Four years since
I had Nora's pot roast

235
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,696
and it's exactly the same.

236
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:42,664
That's why you get it.

237
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,466
You know, I do follow
a strict training diet.

238
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,101
Most of the time.

239
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,903
I didn't say a word.

240
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,305
Justin O'Neill,
can I get a selfie?

241
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,474
Yeah. It'll cost you.

242
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,543
- Good to see you, man...
- You too.

243
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:57,412
Not on my TV.
We miss you out here, J.

244
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,047
Well, you've got me
for the next week.

245
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,682
Hey, how is your knee doing?

246
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:03,051
Did they do deep tissue
regeneration? Ultrasound?

247
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:05,153
Yeah. All of the above,
Dr. Murphy.

248
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:06,888
Not Dr. Murphy just yet.

249
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,391
Not for another five months.
Not a moment too soon.

250
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,993
Working for these two, by day,
and studying hard at night.

251
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,396
Hey, got time for a drink?

252
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:16,832
Go ahead.

253
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,434
- We'll see you later.
- Not too late, okay?

254
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,470
I'm gonna close off the back
run until 7:00 a.m.,

255
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:23,271
so you can have it for yourself.

256
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,173
- I'll be there at 6.
- Okay. Good.

257
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:26,849
- Alright. Good night, guys.
- Good night.

258
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:29,678
About that beer...

259
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:31,813
I'm in training,
let's make it a coffee.

260
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:33,515
Yeah. I've always wanted
to be Irish.

261
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,450
- Come on, big guy.
- Yeah.

262
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,119
So what's going on, man?

263
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,631
You haven't been home
in like five years?

264
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:41,456
Four. It's a busy life,
traveling around

265
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,225
all the time,
from race to race...

266
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,394
Come on, J. It's me, man.
You haven't raced in a year.

267
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:47,195
Why didn't you come home

268
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:48,964
to the PT Institute to rehab?

269
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:50,832
Best sports medicine clinic
in the world

270
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,367
is on the Upper East Side.

271
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:53,713
My surgeon is right
around the corner.

272
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:55,470
You don't pass that kind
of thing up.

273
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,506
That's how was back in racing
shape in record time.

274
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,741
I'm gonna be way better
than those guys, okay?

275
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,588
And I'm gonna give you a stack
of business cards

276
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:03,423
for your racing buddies
for when they wipe out.

277
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,314
Great ambulance
chaser of Winter Mountain

278
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,916
to the rescue!

279
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:09,918
Don't you cheapen me
like that... come on.

280
00:12:09,953 --> 00:12:11,953
- That's what's he's at.
- Two or three.

281
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:16,672
<i>Are you still carrying
a torch for Kayla's sister?</i>

282
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,162
You ever gonna do anything
about it?

283
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,510
- When the time is right.
- When the time is right.

284
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,367
Yeah. You still carrying
a torch for her?

285
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:27,369
Oh, come on,
what are you talking about?

286
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:28,982
We were best friends.
It was never like that

287
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:31,306
between Kay and I.

288
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:34,509
Sure, Bud. Yep.

289
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:36,578
Right.

290
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,027
He's favoring the left knee.

291
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,473
Is he still having pain
in the right?

292
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,797
- Not for a few months.
- No, he's playing it safe.

293
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:57,392
His knee is healed,
it's time to use it.

294
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:06,408
That knee is healed,
it's time to use it.

295
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:07,976
You're not finishing your turns.

296
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,412
Your weight is too far back.
This is so not my place.

297
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,814
I cannot turn this off.
I'm gonna leave you to it.

298
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:14,949
No. Don't turn it off.

299
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:18,186
Because I think we just
found Justin's new coach.

300
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:19,854
- Excuse me?!
- Kayla?

301
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,656
For the week.
To see how it goes.

302
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:23,870
No I'm like so swamped this week.
I've got like the ski school...

303
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:25,204
And she's not even a coach,
coach.

304
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:26,995
'Scuse me, I did coach you
to your first

305
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,330
- Winter Classic victory. FYI.
- Yes!

306
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,199
Think of the optics, Justin.

307
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,501
Plus, her father led your father

308
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,303
to victory after victory.

309
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:38,106
And history has a tendency
to repeat itself.

310
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,909
Is that always such a good
thing, Anna? And...

311
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:42,677
what happened to the irons
in the fire?

312
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:44,612
The fire's out. Squelched.

313
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:47,048
Justin needs someone
who tells it like it is,

314
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,050
no sugar coating.
No playing to his ego.

315
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:51,052
All of that can be a big
distraction for him.

316
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,554
Justin, I can hear you,
you know.

317
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,022
Let me finish.

318
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:56,357
Who better than his
best friend from childhood?

319
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:58,193
Someone who knew him when.

320
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:00,206
Who isn't gonna be distracted
by the glitz and glamour

321
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,442
- that comes with Justin O'Neill.
- Again... hearing everything.

322
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,299
It all comes from
a place of love.

323
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:06,179
You know, I... I just this
there has to be other option.

324
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:07,869
Like what about his dad?

325
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:09,671
No-no-no!
Not an option.

326
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,172
Or my sister, Jenny.

327
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,885
She works at the ski school
with me and she's amazing.

328
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:14,642
Has Jenny ever coached downhill?

329
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:17,345
I think that you're making
my case for me.

330
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,948
He needs this.
He needs you.

331
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,684
<i>Do it for old time's sake.</i>

332
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,020
Over here.
Is he gonna listen to me?

333
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:27,889
- Are you gonna listen to her?
- I don't know.

334
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:29,702
I don't know even know her
coaching technique anymore.

335
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:31,860
Okay, goodbye.

336
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:33,795
- Bye bye.
- Justin!

337
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:36,265
Come on.

338
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,099
Fine.

339
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:45,707
I'll do whatever you say.

340
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:47,809
Within reason.

341
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:51,132
I don't teach anything
that's without reason.

342
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,817
It's settled then.
We start tomorrow.

343
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:05,727
You guys are amazing.
Okay, good job.

344
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:07,507
But remember, if you feel
the slightest little skid,

345
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,097
I want you to keep your hips up,

346
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:10,966
But whatever you do,
you don't get stuck

347
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:13,001
in the "zombie position," okay?

348
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,669
I've got my eyes on you.

349
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:16,171
Alright. Get back up.

350
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,974
- Good morning.
- Hey.

351
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,575
I thought we were training
at 9:00.

352
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:22,277
We are.

353
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:23,923
So you gonna have someone
take over your class for you?

354
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:24,947
No.

355
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,416
So what are we doing here?

356
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:30,418
You're gonna up that magic
carpet with my kids.

357
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,455
The bunny hill.

358
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,250
You gotta learn to crawl
before you can walk.

359
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,959
Is this within reason?

360
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:40,595
Because I don't see how
skiing with a bunch of kids

361
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,631
on a bunny hill is gonna help
me win the Classic.

362
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,899
Well, maybe you could give me
the benefit of the doubt.

363
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,936
It's just a thought.

364
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,765
When I was your age,
my favorite thing

365
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,589
was skiing on fresh,
fallen powder.

366
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:10,091
There's no feeling like it.
You remember that, Justin?

367
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,595
- This is hardly powder.
- Work with me.

368
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,598
Dude! So cool!

369
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:17,873
Yeah.
Just a little lesson here.

370
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,567
Gotta give back to the kids,
you know?

371
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:22,737
Stay humble.

372
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,706
Namaste.

373
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,611
Alright,

374
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,413
nobody tells the truth,

375
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,981
and there is ice-cream in it
for you.

376
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:37,152
Alright, I want you to
show me those pizza slices

377
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,487
and snow plow...
3, 2, 1!

378
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:41,456
GO! Plow!

379
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,925
<i>Okay. Bend your knees.
Keep your weight forward.</i>

380
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,429
<i>Beautiful!
You're doing so great.</i>

381
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:48,863
<i>Come on, those pizza slices.</i>

382
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,333
I believe in you!

383
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:58,106
- You alright?
- Yeah.

384
00:16:58,141 --> 00:17:00,975
- Can't ski well.
- That's okay.

385
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,084
<i>She's new on the scene,</i>

386
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,386
but as good as her father.
Maybe better.

387
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:15,523
Of course he's wearing
the Mountain Ridge Boots.

388
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,670
He doesn't care if the commercials
aren't running anymore,

389
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:19,794
they are always on his feet.

390
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,496
Yeah, it'll be televised.

391
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,699
The 29th.

392
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:27,102
Okay, thanks Ruth.

393
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,149
We are this close to getting
Mountain Ridge Boots

394
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:32,040
back on board.
How was your time today?

395
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,942
- We didn't run the course.
- Why not?

396
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,111
Because my "coach" wouldn't
let me off the bunny hill.

397
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,046
Are you serious?

398
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:39,447
We have 7 days.

399
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:41,249
Yeah. This was your
brilliant idea, Anna.

400
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:43,752
I am sure she has a plan.

401
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,825
Okay. Okay. Please tell
me you took photographs.

402
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,762
No, I didn't want
to humiliate the man.

403
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:55,930
But it was really funny
seeing him standing there

404
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,032
- with a bunch of little kids.
- What are you doing?

405
00:17:58,068 --> 00:17:59,601
Are you trying to mess
with his head?

406
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:01,636
What? I wouldn't do that.
I just want him to stop

407
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,705
trying to be Justin O'Neill,
the superstar,

408
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,074
and just be... just be
Justin O'Neill, the skier.

409
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,976
Well, if anyone can bring him
back, it's you.

410
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,644
I don't know.
He's a bit more challenging

411
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,513
than he used to be.

412
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:18,798
What's going on? What...
Why are you dressed like that?

413
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:20,522
There's a locker room, inside.

414
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,323
You can get changed in there.

415
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,125
What are we doing?
It's day two

416
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:25,894
and I have yet to be
on the training course.

417
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,809
You know, once upon a time
you used to trust me.

418
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:30,064
- You could try that now.
- Do you have a plan here?

419
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,766
What do you think?

420
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,146
I think answering questions
with questions

421
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,803
is a standard deflection
technique.

422
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,671
Yeah. It certainly can be.

423
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:38,351
I wanna know the plan.
We're partners, here.

424
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,108
The plan is...

425
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,677
you need to comeback down to
earth and get centered again.

426
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:44,279
You are very cryptic.

427
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:46,614
- I don't like that.
- Oh, well, just know this...

428
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,716
there is a method to my madness.

429
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,418
I'm...

430
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:53,454
Still... no idea
what your plan is.

431
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:58,660
I understand none of this.
And it's really hot in here.

432
00:18:58,695 --> 00:19:00,361
It's Bikram.
It's sweaty yoga.

433
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:01,896
Yeah. That seems pretty
unsanitary.

434
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,665
No, it's great.
You get a deeper stretch,

435
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,899
it improves your circulation.

436
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:07,035
- Plus, your skin glows.
- And that helps me how?

437
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,981
Switch legs. Put all your
weight on the bad knee.

438
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:10,638
Can we just ask her
to open a window?

439
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:11,918
Just a tiny sliver.

440
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,608
Fine.

441
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:15,577
Put your weight on the bad knee.

442
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,279
Let's keep it down, please.

443
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:21,382
Keep our zen intact
for our neighbors.

444
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,220
Balance. Right.

445
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:27,255
Hey. Don't help me.

446
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:29,057
I will conquer this, alright?

447
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,825
I will conquer this.

448
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:32,961
I will... conquer this.

449
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:36,130
I did not conquer that.

450
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,467
I don't think my body
bends that way.

451
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:41,502
Sweaty yoga is unnecessary
torture.

452
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,872
Well, you get used to it
after, you know, a while.

453
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:46,374
- Am I going to need to?
- We'll see.

454
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,109
Look at that,

455
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:51,286
they've still got all
my favorite midway games.

456
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:53,626
You know, that's the last time
I was here.

457
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,850
- The Classic. Four years ago.
- Yep.

458
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,485
Still couldn't win
that ring toss.

459
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,621
- You know, I think it's fixed.
- That's not fixed.

460
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,389
- Oh please.
- I speak from experience.

461
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,269
And maybe I'll win you
something nice this week.

462
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:04,926
Nope, this time around,

463
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,394
I will succeed at the ring toss.

464
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:08,296
It's my time. I am due.

465
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:10,164
If only the Classic
was every year,

466
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:12,011
you'd have more of a chance.
But, I mean, if this is

467
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:13,268
what it takes to get you home.

468
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:14,936
I can't change
the racing schedule.

469
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:16,382
The season is five months
of the year.

470
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:18,439
Yeah, but appearances
and endorsements

471
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,453
during the seven other months,
pay for those five.

472
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:22,597
Plus, training. You know,
I've got to follow the snow.

473
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:26,681
Your parents missed you.

474
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:29,028
It's not like I haven't seen
them. They were at every race.

475
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,297
Yeah. I know. Jenny and I run
the lodge when they're gone.

476
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,288
My mom said that the ski
school is thriving.

477
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:35,323
You've developed quite
the reputation.

478
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,659
I'm just doing everything
my Dad would've done.

479
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,194
Not everything.

480
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,597
When I left I never thought
you would've quit coaching.

481
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:45,400
Oh, 'cause I didn't.
I coach the ski team.

482
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:47,368
Yeah, but you wanted to be
a racing coach.

483
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:50,004
- It's a racing team.
- Of 12 year-olds.

484
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,141
That's where champions are born.

485
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:54,976
No one knows that more than you.

486
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:56,355
You could've been so great.

487
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:58,446
That did not come out right.

488
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:00,848
No. I would imagine not.

489
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:03,051
- You loved coaching.
- I'm actually still coaching!

490
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:04,953
I'm coaching you right now.

491
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:07,066
Would you like me to wear
a name tag so you don't forget.

492
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,123
That's not what I meant, okay?

493
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,170
You know, I feel like I can
ever say anything right

494
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:13,261
- with you, Kay.
- Justin...

495
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,297
we had a plan and it didn't
work out. It happens.

496
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:20,034
- You still seem pretty angry.
- I'm not upset about it.

497
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:22,437
I was the one that told you
to go train with Niels.

498
00:21:22,472 --> 00:21:24,205
Did you want me to not go?

499
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:26,474
Justin, it's not that you left,

500
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:28,609
you left, and you
barely looked back.

501
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:30,945
You went away and took our
friendship with you.

502
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:33,581
And the fact that you don't
even realize that is...

503
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:01,309
...you know, ground zero.
Like... bunny hill,

504
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:03,255
- I means, he's gotta start...
- Justin on the bunny bill?

505
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,846
- Yes.
- Are there pictures?

506
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:06,614
- No. Get outta here.
- And then what...?

507
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:09,317
Hey, you two.

508
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:11,185
You know what, Justin.

509
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:13,087
This lady knows a thing or two.

510
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:14,956
I know.

511
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:16,691
And you'd be wise
to listen to her.

512
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:19,260
Well, I always listen
to my coach.

513
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,297
That's so debatable.

514
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,769
This was a good call...
you two working together again.

515
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,370
The O'Neills and the Greens

516
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:32,040
have always been a recipe
for success.

517
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:33,608
<i>I like it.</i>

518
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,012
- Justin?
- Sorry.

519
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:41,315
That almost sounded like
positive feedback,

520
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:42,884
I don't know what to make of it.

521
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:44,472
Yeah. Because he's really
proud of you.

522
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:48,689
He's really proud...

523
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:50,892
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yes.

524
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,262
Everything I do is wrong.

525
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:56,264
Nothing I do
is the way he'd do it.

526
00:22:58,435 --> 00:23:00,168
That's not why you're here.

527
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,736
No. I came to get see
your father.

528
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,371
About me?

529
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:04,817
No, contrary to what you may
believe,

530
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,541
not everything is always
about you.

531
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:08,242
It isn't? Well...

532
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:10,812
- this is disappointing news.
- Alright, come on.

533
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,814
- Let's get back out there.
- Right now?

534
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,593
But it's opening ceremonies
in the village tonight.

535
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:16,517
Yeah. I know.
Jenny and I are going.

536
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:18,052
This is not gonna take too long.

537
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:19,454
You know, I'm going with Wyatt.

538
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:20,888
Maybe we can meet you there.

539
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:23,357
- Yeah. If you want.
- I do.

540
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:25,293
- Okay.
- I...

541
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,666
I really am sorry...

542
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,570
for everything.

543
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:38,473
Justin, you can win this race.

544
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:40,119
But it's not your knee
that's the problem.

545
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:42,577
Your head is.
We can fix that.

546
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:47,982
I know what you're doing.

547
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,051
We used to come out here
at night and plan our path

548
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:52,120
for world domination
on the race circuit.

549
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:54,255
You're about to see,
I'm not so cryptic, after all.

550
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,090
You cracked my code.

551
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,039
So what is it that you
want now, Justin O'Neill?

552
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:00,995
- I wanna win.
- Why?

553
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,964
Because it beats losing?

554
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,499
And?

555
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:06,667
I feel like that's a good
enough reason.

556
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:08,402
But what is it, really?

557
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:10,638
I mean, you've got
countless medals.

558
00:24:10,673 --> 00:24:12,707
A world record that no one
has been able to top.

559
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,775
Why do you wanna win now?

560
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:18,946
Because racing is all I have.

561
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:20,848
It's not all you have.

562
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:22,750
It's all you chose.

563
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:31,425
- So what about you?
- What?

564
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:33,494
You don't get off that easy.

565
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,898
We come out here to plot world
domination for the both of us.

566
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,902
So... what do you want,
Kayla Green?

567
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,538
Nothing.
I'm perfectly content.

568
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:45,506
You were never complacent.

569
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,241
You always had goals. Dreams.

570
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:50,578
Guys falling at your feet.

571
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:52,713
Well, I mean, I do teach
people to glide on ice,

572
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:54,182
So I guess falling
is inevitable.

573
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,385
What about dating?

574
00:24:57,453 --> 00:25:00,254
You know, like,
a few guys here and there,

575
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,323
but nothing really took.
Not since Vince.

576
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,259
Vince?

577
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:09,530
Your parents didn't tell you
about him?

578
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,167
We don't... talk about...
stuff.

579
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:16,837
He was an instructor here...
two years ago.

580
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:19,874
We almost got married.

581
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:21,876
But your dad talked me
out of it.

582
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:23,956
Well, he does love telling
people what to do, doesn't he?

583
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,180
He wasn't telling me what
to do, he was protecting me.

584
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:28,516
My dad? Tom O'Neill?

585
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:30,429
Yeah. Do you have another dad
that I'm not aware of?

586
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:33,254
You are lucky to have him.

587
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:35,289
And your mom, too.

588
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:39,293
It's really hard losing
both parents and...

589
00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:41,696
yours have both filled that
void for both, me and Jenny.

590
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:45,333
I know. I know,

591
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:47,702
it's... complicated
between me and my dad.

592
00:25:49,672 --> 00:25:52,006
I guess, all my relationships
are pretty complicated,

593
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,507
aren't they?

594
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:58,012
We should go.

595
00:25:58,081 --> 00:26:00,281
Opening ceremony is at 8 o'clock

596
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:02,383
and you need a shower.

597
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:09,724
Race you back?

598
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:13,561
Hardly sounds fair,
I mean, I am a professional.

599
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,162
Race you?

600
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:19,974
Last one to the lodge,
buys the first round tonight!

601
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,643
Justin!

602
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:34,015
Justin!

603
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,650
- Hey Anna!
- I've been calling you!

604
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:37,818
My phone is on silent.

605
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:39,531
I'm heading to the carnival
kick off, you want to come?

606
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:41,222
Raincheck on that.

607
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:43,824
The president of Snow Voltz Ski
Wear is in the bar

608
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,160
and he wants to meet you.
You need to get in there!

609
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:47,828
I'm supposed to meet
some friends.

610
00:26:47,864 --> 00:26:49,330
Text them.

611
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,232
You'll be 20 minutes late, tops.

612
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,735
Get in here. Now!

613
00:26:54,771 --> 00:26:56,637
Okay. Okay-okay.
I'm coming.

614
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,481
<i>So I took my inheritance,
retired from snowboarding</i>

615
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,376
<i>and started Snow Voltz Ski Wear.</i>

616
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,512
Five years in, we're now
one of the top brands.

617
00:27:04,547 --> 00:27:06,225
It's very inspiring
what you've accomplished

618
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,049
at your age.

619
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:10,318
And we know there's a lots
of competition out there,

620
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:12,820
but there is no one better
to endorse

621
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:14,522
Snow Voltz Ski Wear than Justin.

622
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,824
He's a world champion

623
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:18,125
and his products sell.

624
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:21,395
I like you, Justin.

625
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,264
I wanted to bring you into
the fold year one,

626
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:24,899
but you were tied up

627
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,378
with Mountain Ridge Boots
at the time.

628
00:27:26,402 --> 00:27:28,536
I think you're relatable,
you could bring a nice

629
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:30,211
"maturity" to our brand.
Expand our reach.

630
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:33,474
Maturity. Right.

631
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,676
But that was a pretty big
spill you took in Austria,

632
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:37,845
to be honest, I have yet
to see a skier come back

633
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,513
<i>from an injury like that.</i>

634
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:42,350
I have to wonder if maybe
our time has passed.

635
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:45,786
I get the hesitation, okay?
You wanna make sure

636
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:48,155
that the old Justin is back
before you commit.

637
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:50,791
But if I didn't think
that I could pull out a win,

638
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,227
I wouldn't put myself on this
international stage.

639
00:27:54,864 --> 00:27:56,230
You'll see after the race,

640
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:58,532
your worries about me
are completely unfounded.

641
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:01,702
Alright.

642
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:03,504
Let's wait and see
what happens on Sunday.

643
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,139
Alright.

644
00:28:17,553 --> 00:28:19,186
I'm serious.

645
00:28:19,222 --> 00:28:20,554
- Hey, you made it.
- Hi.

646
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,390
Hi.

647
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:23,724
How are you?

648
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:27,439
We had to get away from
organizing auctions items,

649
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:29,296
my head was starting to spin.

650
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,798
You know this family.

651
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:32,867
When we set our minds
to something...

652
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:35,102
- My son giving you any trouble?
- Of course he is.

653
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:37,405
But I know how to handle him.
Hey, have you seen him?

654
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,407
He texted that he'd be here
half an hour ago.

655
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:41,108
Well, yeah, you know Justin.

656
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:43,322
Phone calls and interviews.
I'm sure they're on their way.

657
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,879
Hi! Hi! Welcome!

658
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:46,680
Welcome to the Winter Classic.

659
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:50,851
A weeklong celebration
of food, and drink,

660
00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:52,953
and games, and an auction,

661
00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:55,222
and some good old-fashioned
line dancing, you know?

662
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,302
<i>That's right. It's happening
right here in the village,</i>

663
00:28:57,326 --> 00:28:59,460
leading up to the big race
on Sunday.

664
00:28:59,495 --> 00:29:01,028
That's right!

665
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:07,535
<i>And all the game proceeds go
to Skiing for Scholarships,</i>

666
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,203
so like from the auction.

667
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:10,871
We have so many great items
this year.

668
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:12,940
We have diamond earrings.
Spa services.

669
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:14,875
And staycations.

670
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:16,644
So get your checkbooks ready,
okay?

671
00:29:18,014 --> 00:29:19,513
<i>Alright. We'll be back
in a second.</i>

672
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,315
How about some cocoa?
Your treat.

673
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,517
- Okay. I'd love some.
- Get me one too, please.

674
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:26,665
I know, I know...
I made it as quickly...

675
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:28,656
Oh finally.

676
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:30,491
Someone sounds anxious
to see Justin.

677
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,471
I'm not anxious. I just
don't like waiting on people.

678
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:34,428
You say you're gonna be there
at a certain time,

679
00:29:34,464 --> 00:29:36,341
- then you arrive at that time.
- Alright, okay.

680
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:37,843
Go ahead, lady, if you wanna
"doth protest too much."

681
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:39,900
I am so sorry,
my manager set up a meeting

682
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:41,413
- and I just couldn't say no.
- It's okay.

683
00:29:41,437 --> 00:29:43,204
They're about to announce
the start list.

684
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,983
Hang on, don't let him off
the hook that easy.

685
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:47,207
I gave this guy the silent
treatment the whole way here.

686
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,678
Hi. Jenny.
And how are you?

687
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:52,346
I'm good, Wyatt.
How are you?

688
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,281
I'm... yeah.

689
00:29:54,317 --> 00:29:56,183
That was so smooth.

690
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,385
<i>And now, to introduce
the Winter Classic racers</i>

691
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,488
is someone who needs
no introduction at all.

692
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:03,457
Is the current World Slalom
Champion, Nancy Sieber.

693
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:09,196
Wait... is she racing?

694
00:30:09,232 --> 00:30:11,065
I don't see her
on the start list.

695
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,444
Yeah. She's here, training
for the Zurich Invitational,

696
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:14,401
with Hunter Davies' coach.

697
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,270
Thank you so much
for that warm welcome,

698
00:30:16,305 --> 00:30:18,305
considering I'm not even
racing this week.

699
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:20,908
But the line-up is top notch,

700
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:22,676
and it sure to be quite a race;

701
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:24,979
with racers like Hunter Davies.

702
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:27,281
<i>Lars Edmund.
Anthony Norman.</i>

703
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:29,783
And Winter Mountain's very own,
Justin O'Neill.

704
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,724
Thank you so much, guys.
We'll see you on Sunday!

705
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,325
Alright. So...

706
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:40,461
- shall we get a drink?
- You two go.

707
00:30:40,496 --> 00:30:41,874
You gotta get home
and get some rest.

708
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:43,631
What?

709
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,032
You should've been here earlier.

710
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:46,800
- Fine, coach.
- Good.

711
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,837
Because tomorrow we're
running the course.

712
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:53,574
What? No!
Yes? Yes!

713
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:55,075
Finally, we train.

714
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,039
What was that?

715
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:26,719
Because that was definitely
not the Justin O'Neill

716
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:28,576
who took first place in Zermatt.

717
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,244
Tough love angle, huh?

718
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:36,417
Alright. So maybe
I'm a little rusty.

719
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:38,353
And those pillows
at the lodge...

720
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:39,932
I really gotta talk to my dad
about that.

721
00:31:39,956 --> 00:31:41,956
- Those things are so lumpy.
- Pillows?!

722
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:44,559
- They are awful.
- Okay, excuses and 30 bucks

723
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:47,295
is gonna get you a ticket
to the race you are not in.

724
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,864
I know. I know. I don't
know what's wrong with me.

725
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:52,266
- I'm all over the place.
- Okay. Alright.

726
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:54,335
Let's just take a break.

727
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,339
Do you remember when we
were on the junior team?

728
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,041
Some of the best times
of my life.

729
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:02,077
We had the whole world
ahead of us.

730
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:03,823
I mean, the whole world
is still ahead of you.

731
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:05,847
You just have to get back
in that headspace

732
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,616
when nothing mattered
but the wind in your face.

733
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:10,585
The sound of snow
under my skies.

734
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,686
The rush of it all.

735
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:13,788
Yeah.

736
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:17,258
You know, my knee... healed,

737
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,929
what if I never get back
to what I used to be?

738
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:23,765
My dad used to say,

739
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,834
"Never let success
get to your head

740
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:27,802
and failure get to your heart."

741
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:30,071
So once your head is back
in the game,

742
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,140
then your knee is gonna follow.

743
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:35,276
Thanks, Coach.

744
00:32:35,312 --> 00:32:36,778
- Let's go again.
- Alright.

745
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:42,450
How is he looking?

746
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:44,385
<i>Well, he's not favoring
his good knee anymore,</i>

747
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,554
<i>and his turns are solid.</i>

748
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,556
How's the time?

749
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,325
It's improved since
this morning,

750
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,026
but it still not close
to course record.

751
00:32:54,698 --> 00:32:57,499
What else does he need?

752
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:01,035
He needs positive reinforcement.

753
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,571
Not criticism,

754
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,107
'cause I think his confidence
is a little low.

755
00:33:06,143 --> 00:33:08,109
Confidence has never
been his problem.

756
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:09,985
Yeah. I know. That's how
you know it's serious.

757
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,821
Looking... looking good
out there, Justin.

758
00:33:21,158 --> 00:33:22,657
Thanks.

759
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:24,392
So, your mom's auction
is this evening,

760
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,327
I think she was hoping
that you would drop by?

761
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,798
- I was planning on it.
- Okay. Okay, then.

762
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,234
So you're looking good.

763
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:38,106
- Can I show you something?
- Yeah.

764
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:14,742
Justin, you look very handsome.

765
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:17,512
I'm not gonna dress like
a slouch on your big night.

766
00:34:19,316 --> 00:34:21,749
It's really nice
to have you home.

767
00:34:21,785 --> 00:34:23,751
It's nice to be home.

768
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:26,054
Now, eat. Drink. Be merry.

769
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:27,922
And bid on some auction items,
would you?

770
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,525
- Deal.
- Okay.

771
00:34:53,283 --> 00:34:55,450
Cheapskate.

772
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:57,819
Excuse me, but I think
I'm being pretty generous.

773
00:34:57,854 --> 00:34:59,554
Whatever, man.
Next time we host this thing

774
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:01,956
I'm gonna be a doctor and make
millions for this place.

775
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:03,925
- I can't wait.
- Alright.

776
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:07,328
<i>- Ski lessons?
- Yeah-yeah-yeah.</i>

777
00:35:07,364 --> 00:35:08,897
<i>We got diamond earrings?</i>

778
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:10,465
Fancy.

779
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,133
- Hi.
- Hi.

780
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:14,636
- Hey.
- Jenny... you look...

781
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:17,672
You look really great,
too, Wyatt.

782
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,807
Thanks.

783
00:35:22,445 --> 00:35:25,580
Dinner with Hunter Davies
is at $500?

784
00:35:27,517 --> 00:35:29,951
Why didn't my mother ask me
to donate anything this year?

785
00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:32,987
Maybe your mom didn't know
that'd be in town this long?

786
00:35:33,023 --> 00:35:34,656
I mean, Hunter offered.

787
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:36,524
I still don't understand
why she didn't ask.

788
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,526
I mean, I've always donated
something.

789
00:35:38,561 --> 00:35:41,429
Well, maybe...
you could've offered, too?

790
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:43,331
Well, I'm offering now.

791
00:35:43,366 --> 00:35:45,633
Let's find something of mine
we can put out on the table.

792
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:47,802
Okay. Okay.
I will take care of it.

793
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:50,605
You go sit down.
Live auction is about to start.

794
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,675
And sold! To paddle 107
for $600.

795
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,243
Thank you very much, Sir.

796
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:00,915
Okay.

797
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:02,361
Okay. I've just been told that
there had been

798
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:04,786
a last minute donation
to the live auction

799
00:36:04,821 --> 00:36:06,921
as well as a special
guest auctioneer,

800
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,489
the head of our ski school,

801
00:36:08,525 --> 00:36:10,692
here at Winter Mountain,
Miss Kayla Green.

802
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:16,230
Hi how are you?

803
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:18,366
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

804
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:20,668
I helped secure some of
the items

805
00:36:20,704 --> 00:36:22,537
that we will be auctioning off
this evening,

806
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:24,405
which benefits Skiing
for Scholarships,

807
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:25,873
in its 20th year

808
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:27,875
of sending underprivileged
kids to college,

809
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:30,311
courtesy of that beautify angel
over there, Gretchen O'Neill.

810
00:36:32,515 --> 00:36:34,048
<i>Great work!</i>

811
00:36:34,117 --> 00:36:36,117
Who wants to know about
this exciting new item

812
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,986
up for bid, huh?

813
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:42,490
One of you lucky folks is gonna
get to spend the entire day

814
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,258
<i>with World Cup Champion,</i>

815
00:36:44,294 --> 00:36:45,927
<i>multiple medalist,</i>

hawker of everyone's favorite
hiking boots...

817
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:51,766
Justin O'Neill!

818
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,903
<i>Come on up here, Justin!</i>

819
00:36:55,972 --> 00:36:57,839
<i>Let's send some kids
to college together.</i>

820
00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:59,807
<i>Come on!</i>

821
00:37:03,113 --> 00:37:06,080
A day with this legend,
right here.

822
00:37:06,116 --> 00:37:07,882
Let's start the bidding,
shall we?

823
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:09,817
- $150.
- $200!

824
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:12,053
- Do I hear $200!
- $200! $200! $200 over here!

825
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:14,188
Do I hear $300?
We've got $300?

826
00:37:14,224 --> 00:37:16,691
<i>She's $300 right there!</i>

827
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:18,559
$500! Look who just upped
the ante.

828
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:20,128
Justin, look at that!

829
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:22,530
Do you wanna know something?

830
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:25,166
I think we can do a little bit
better than that, don't you?

831
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:29,937
This is the spokesman of the
Arctic Skin Thermals, okay?

832
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:31,973
You all remember that silly
commercial?

833
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:33,674
<i>I bet you got paid
a lot of money?</i>

834
00:37:33,743 --> 00:37:36,444
But listen, show us the flex?
Come on, they wanna see it?

835
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:39,247
They wanna see the flex!

836
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:41,749
Do I hear $1000?

837
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:46,187
Look at this guy!
Come on, he's a legend!

838
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,724
2018's Athlete of the Year!
Come on!

839
00:37:49,793 --> 00:37:51,659
He beat them all!
He's a champion!

840
00:37:51,694 --> 00:37:53,628
Three thousand dollars!

841
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:57,632
Okay?

842
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,802
Do I hear... $3500?

843
00:38:00,837 --> 00:38:03,037
$3500!

844
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,773
Ma'am, you just outbid
yourself.

845
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:07,275
It's for the kids.

846
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:10,078
$3500, going once.

847
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:12,246
Going twice.

848
00:38:12,315 --> 00:38:14,215
<i>Sold. To that beautiful lady</i>

849
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,285
<i>holing paddle number 41
for $3500.</i>

850
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:20,988
I think that's a record
for a single item

851
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:22,957
at an auction, at this auction,
right Gretchen?

852
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:25,093
That's correct.
Thank you, Justin.

853
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:26,794
No...

854
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,263
thank you all for your
generosity.

855
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:37,338
- I like this.
- What?

856
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:39,474
My old friend is back.

857
00:38:45,715 --> 00:38:47,615
Remember when we used
to sneak out as kids

858
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,584
- and come up here?
- Watch the night skiers?

859
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,285
Yeah. Throw snowballs
at them.

860
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:53,221
- Run and hide? Yes.
- Memories.

861
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,757
I'm glad that
we're making new ones.

862
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,293
I thought I had it
all figured out.

863
00:38:59,362 --> 00:39:01,529
Go pro and take on the world.

864
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:05,399
Justin,
that's exactly what you did.

865
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,034
So...

866
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,805
You... okay?

867
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,673
You're living the good life,
man.

868
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:14,809
Premieres, parties,
beautiful actresses.

869
00:39:14,844 --> 00:39:16,555
I mean, not that I'm into
that kind of thing...

870
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,146
- I am really not.
- Okay.

871
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,982
You know, none of that
stuff is real.

872
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,917
You're always wondering
if people like you

873
00:39:22,952 --> 00:39:25,686
for who you are or
what you can do for them.

874
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:27,522
Well, you know,
our dad always said,

875
00:39:27,557 --> 00:39:29,277
"You gotta focus on the people
who loved you

876
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,225
when you were invisible
to everyone else."

877
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:33,895
No one knows you like
those you came up with.

878
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:36,364
Yeah, you know,
being back with you, guys,

879
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:38,666
the auction,
the night skiers out there...

880
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:41,435
this is real.

881
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:43,237
Hey, you got to where
you wanted to go, man.

882
00:39:43,273 --> 00:39:44,772
Not everyone can say that.

883
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:46,252
I mean, I wanted to be
a Backstreet Boy,

884
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:48,276
when I was younger.

885
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:50,945
Look at me now.
Consider yourself lucky, pal.

886
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,214
I know. I don't mean
to sound ungrateful.

887
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:55,082
You're so good at it.

888
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:15,769
Justin, what are you
doing here this morning?

889
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:19,039
Just thinking.

890
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:22,743
This room seemed ginormous
when I was a kid.

891
00:40:22,778 --> 00:40:25,079
Well, you were
much shorter then.

892
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:26,580
Good point.

893
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:31,018
Hey Mom,

894
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,619
what was it like being
married to Dad,

895
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:34,421
when he was on the circuit.

896
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:36,824
Exciting.

897
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:38,459
And challenging.

898
00:40:38,494 --> 00:40:40,828
But we made it work.

899
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,398
What about when he retired?

900
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:47,201
- Were you disappointed?
- Not at all.

901
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:51,805
We finally got the chance
to build something, together.

902
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:54,007
Or besides you that is.

903
00:40:54,043 --> 00:40:56,944
Honey, if I've learned anything

904
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:59,046
from living with your father,

905
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:02,816
is, that sometimes it's best to
step back from all the noise,

906
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:06,153
and think about what it is that
would make you truly happy.

907
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,390
The simple question.

908
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:15,062
Right now, you're just a guy,

909
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,397
sitting in a room,
tying to figure it all out.

910
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:22,302
What does that guy see
when he looks to his future?

911
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:51,498
And keep it vague. Don't give
specific times or techniques.

912
00:41:51,534 --> 00:41:53,433
Just be very positive
and upbeat.

913
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,935
- Okay.
- Smiling.

914
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,548
Smiling the whole time.
This is a big deal.

915
00:41:56,572 --> 00:41:58,238
<i>Justin is a comeback story.</i>

916
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:00,107
<i>And everybody loves
a great comeback.</i>

917
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,242
<i>He knows the drill,
but are you doing okay?</i>

918
00:42:02,278 --> 00:42:03,911
- Kayla?
- Yes.

919
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:05,879
I left my body for a minute.
I'm good.

920
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:08,415
You can do this.
Forget about the cameras.

921
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,184
<i>You're just having
a conversation</i>

922
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:12,419
with your very good friend
and this nice lady.

923
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,621
Right. Got it.

924
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,323
Okay.

925
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,128
Justin, let's
get you here on the right,

926
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,597
and Kayla here on the left.
Alright.

927
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:25,465
- Alright.
- Careful there.

928
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,134
You okay?

929
00:42:27,203 --> 00:42:29,069
Yeah. Great.

930
00:42:30,472 --> 00:42:32,606
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

931
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,908
If you get nervous,
just look in my eyes.

932
00:42:34,944 --> 00:42:36,577
Connect with me, okay?

933
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:38,545
- I got you.
- Okay.

934
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:41,348
<i>In fact,</i>

935
00:42:41,383 --> 00:42:43,450
The Winter Classic was the
first race you ever won?

936
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:46,186
And then, you went on to win
it again, two other years.

937
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:48,655
So what's different
about this year?

938
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,302
Well, I wasn't recovering
from an knee injury,

939
00:42:50,326 --> 00:42:52,659
so there's that.

940
00:42:52,728 --> 00:42:55,395
But, no, I'm coming along.
I'm healing...

941
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:58,365
in every sense of the word.

942
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,067
And I owe a lot of that

943
00:43:00,102 --> 00:43:02,369
to this exceptional woman
right here.

944
00:43:02,404 --> 00:43:05,038
She's not only my coach,
but a really good friend.

945
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:08,954
I'm looking at this Winter
Classic as a way to get back

946
00:43:08,978 --> 00:43:10,811
so many things that I've lost.

947
00:43:10,846 --> 00:43:12,846
Like that medal he should've
won in Austria.

948
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,659
He was on track for it,
like he is for this race.

949
00:43:14,683 --> 00:43:16,149
So Kayla,

950
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:17,896
after Justin joined
the professional circuit,

951
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,586
you didn't coach again.

952
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:22,122
Not a professional racer,
Maggie, no.

953
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:24,458
I mean, how do you top,
working with this guy?

954
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:26,693
Even if was a long time ago.

955
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,506
But I am happy to say that
our Winter Mountain Lodge

956
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,864
junior racers, have taken
the state alpine championship,

957
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,367
- three years running.
- Wonderful.

958
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,569
Well, I think I speak
for everyone when I say,

959
00:43:35,638 --> 00:43:37,304
we are four days away

960
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:39,506
and we can't wait
to see how you two do,

961
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:41,775
together, on that mountain,
again.

962
00:43:57,026 --> 00:43:58,392
Take a run with me.

963
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,127
No, I need to watch
from down here.

964
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:01,862
Come on, one run.

965
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:05,465
Please.

966
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:06,967
Come on, warm me up
like old times.

967
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:11,238
Pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty
please.

968
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,240
I'll go get my stuff.

969
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:39,299
That was very graceful.

970
00:44:39,335 --> 00:44:41,101
And there wasn't even a team
of 12 year-olds

971
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,970
to take me out
like some people I know.

972
00:44:43,038 --> 00:44:43,770
Careful,

973
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,839
it's...

974
00:44:45,874 --> 00:44:47,741
slippery.

975
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:49,810
- Hi.
- Hi.

976
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:51,745
You look kinda lonely down here.

977
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,714
- You okay?
- Yeah.

978
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:55,215
How is your knee?

979
00:44:55,284 --> 00:44:56,883
Feels good.

980
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,791
- This feels good.
- Does it?

981
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,494
I think I have snow
up my back a little bit.

982
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:10,197
I meant this... us.

983
00:45:10,232 --> 00:45:12,132
You know, back together, again.

984
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,601
Yes, it's nice.
It's nice.

985
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,670
You know, I think you're
sufficiently warmed up

986
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:18,538
and I think we gotta
get back to work.

987
00:45:18,574 --> 00:45:20,207
Right.

988
00:45:21,777 --> 00:45:23,877
You okay?

989
00:45:23,946 --> 00:45:26,079
Yeah.

990
00:45:26,115 --> 00:45:27,814
That happens from time to time.

991
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,617
Remember, it's not my knee,
it's my head.

992
00:45:30,652 --> 00:45:32,886
Yeah, believe it not your
head is actually improving,

993
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:34,921
I'm a little bit nervous
about this knee.

994
00:45:34,957 --> 00:45:37,024
It's fine. Look, I have
so much metal in there.

995
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:38,225
I'm practically bionic.

996
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,193
If it's sore we should treat it.

997
00:45:40,229 --> 00:45:41,895
And not exacerbate
any inflammation.

998
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,530
I'm fine.

999
00:45:43,565 --> 00:45:45,245
What did I tell you
about fighting with me?

1000
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,812
I don't really remember
anything in particular

1001
00:45:47,836 --> 00:45:50,203
about fighting,
but there was listening,

1002
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:53,006
obeying... tree pose.

1003
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,919
The correct answer is; Kayla,
I will do whatever you say.

1004
00:45:54,943 --> 00:45:56,321
And I will not ever argue
with you...

1005
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:58,311
and you're perfect.

1006
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,915
- That is a mouthful.
- Just try it.

1007
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,884
I will do whatever you say,
Kayla,

1008
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:05,786
I will not argue with you...

1009
00:46:05,854 --> 00:46:07,721
You're per...

1010
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:09,990
perfect.

1011
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:13,126
Justin, where is this all
coming from?

1012
00:46:13,162 --> 00:46:15,829
Let's go ice your knee.

1013
00:46:25,774 --> 00:46:27,619
What are you waiting for?
You need me to carry you?

1014
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:28,875
Nope. I'm good.

1015
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,078
Just tightening my boot buckles.

1016
00:46:31,113 --> 00:46:32,879
Be right down.

1017
00:46:46,862 --> 00:46:48,206
<i>So I mean,
if you're not doing anything,</i>

1018
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,874
there is, there is a party
for my graduating class.

1019
00:46:49,898 --> 00:46:52,666
- You should come.
- Yeah, no, I mean, I...

1020
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:55,769
I'd love to. Just, you know,
send me the details.

1021
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:56,604
Okay.

1022
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,617
- You can like rest on me...
- I'm alright. I'm alright.

1023
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:00,486
Because I can like handle it.
I'm like pretty strong.

1024
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,243
What? What did you do
to yourself?

1025
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,612
It's nothing.
I'm just a little sore.

1026
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,458
I mean, that's not uncommon
for that type of injury,

1027
00:47:06,482 --> 00:47:08,294
but what are you doing to
maintain your physical therapy,

1028
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:10,051
while you're training.

1029
00:47:10,086 --> 00:47:12,253
Not much,
haven't really needed it.

1030
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,322
Well, today's your lucky day, J,

1031
00:47:14,357 --> 00:47:16,924
we're gonna start on a full
PT regimen.

1032
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:21,462
So the deep heat will help
circulation in the ligament

1033
00:47:21,497 --> 00:47:23,230
and help with pain
and inflammation.

1034
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:25,266
We're gonna have to do this
at least once a day

1035
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,935
before the race,
and ice it at least twice.

1036
00:47:29,238 --> 00:47:30,604
It's very impressive, Wyatt.

1037
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,473
Thanks.

1038
00:47:32,508 --> 00:47:34,453
You should probably call it a
day on the training for now.

1039
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,110
- Start fresh tomorrow.
- A night off.

1040
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,079
Well, I guess a can get
a little rest.

1041
00:47:38,114 --> 00:47:39,513
Not do fast mister.

1042
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:41,515
There are some not-fixed
carnival games

1043
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:43,551
with our names written
all over them.

1044
00:47:43,586 --> 00:47:45,319
Alright, the knee
may be questionable,

1045
00:47:45,355 --> 00:47:47,054
but my ring toss arm is sharp.

1046
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:48,823
Plus there's line dancing
in the square.

1047
00:47:48,858 --> 00:47:51,158
Normally on Tuesday we go
do that at the saloon but...

1048
00:47:51,194 --> 00:47:52,693
I love line dancing.

1049
00:47:52,762 --> 00:47:54,495
You hate line dancing.

1050
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,297
Okay. You haven't been here
in a long time.

1051
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,232
No, no, he's really good at it.

1052
00:47:58,267 --> 00:47:59,567
You're gonna love it, trust me.

1053
00:47:59,602 --> 00:48:01,602
Everyone goes,
we wear cute boots...

1054
00:48:01,637 --> 00:48:03,704
Great, then it's a date.

1055
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,873
I mean, not a date. Date.

1056
00:48:05,908 --> 00:48:08,342
Unless, unless you want it
to be a date. Is it a date?

1057
00:48:08,378 --> 00:48:10,244
- Should it be a date?
- It's a date. Just...

1058
00:48:10,313 --> 00:48:12,012
<i>It's a date.</i>

1059
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,318
Hey son...

1060
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,920
Are you okay?

1061
00:48:19,956 --> 00:48:21,589
Just a little sore.

1062
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:23,224
Totally normal for an injury
like mine.

1063
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:27,228
Justin, sit down for a minute.

1064
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,035
I had an ultrasound
treatment today,

1065
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,337
and I'll have another tomorrow.

1066
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,172
What did Kayla say
about your turns?

1067
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,207
She mentioned they
were inconsistent.

1068
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:42,042
Dad, you don't need
to micro manage me.

1069
00:48:42,111 --> 00:48:43,922
- I know what I'm doing.
- I never said you didn't.

1070
00:48:43,946 --> 00:48:45,491
Then why don't we ever talk
about something else?

1071
00:48:45,515 --> 00:48:47,181
Like Fantasy Football,
or the weather.

1072
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,316
Yeah.

1073
00:48:49,352 --> 00:48:51,419
You know, this is what
my father did to me.

1074
00:48:51,454 --> 00:48:53,788
<i>He rode me so hard
and I hated it.</i>

1075
00:48:53,823 --> 00:48:55,389
But I was a winner...

1076
00:48:55,425 --> 00:48:57,525
You were the best.

1077
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:00,928
Justin, you're better
than I ever was.

1078
00:49:00,997 --> 00:49:02,696
<i>It's not even close.</i>

1079
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,234
Really?

1080
00:49:07,303 --> 00:49:10,304
I knew you were a champion
from the get-go.

1081
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:12,473
Because you're a true natural.

1082
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,845
You know, I don't know if I can
get back there.

1083
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:20,114
I'm healed but it just doesn't
feel the same.

1084
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:22,116
So you have to work
ten times harder.

1085
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:24,185
And I'm saying this not out
of judgment,

1086
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,420
just... it's from experience.

1087
00:49:26,456 --> 00:49:28,133
What if I don't win
the Classic? What if...

1088
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:29,723
What if I'm done?

1089
00:49:32,028 --> 00:49:34,795
I just, I just wanna
make you proud.

1090
00:49:34,831 --> 00:49:36,630
Of course I'm proud of you.

1091
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:47,441
Yes! Yes-yes-yes!

1092
00:49:49,912 --> 00:49:51,679
Go!

1093
00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:55,850
- Alright!
- Yeah!

1094
00:49:57,086 --> 00:49:59,019
- Oh come on!
- Yes!

1095
00:49:59,055 --> 00:50:00,788
That's alright.
I wasn't even trying anyway.

1096
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:03,491
I want you to keep this.

1097
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:04,937
So that you remember that
the game is not fixed

1098
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:07,094
and that just I beat you.

1099
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,963
That's so sweet.

1100
00:50:08,998 --> 00:50:10,831
I will cherish this forever.

1101
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:23,511
Can't believe he finally did it
after all these years.

1102
00:50:23,546 --> 00:50:26,247
Maybe the bear won her heart.

1103
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,883
Well, then this wins a toe.

1104
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,686
A big toe.

1105
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:46,333
I'll have a beer and...

1106
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:48,435
What? I can have one beer.

1107
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,349
I will have his beer,
you can get him a club soda.

1108
00:50:50,373 --> 00:50:52,172
What's that?

1109
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,807
The fish says you're bossy.

1110
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,883
Well, you tell the fish,
that's what you pay me for.

1111
00:50:56,779 --> 00:50:58,812
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1112
00:51:00,249 --> 00:51:02,316
She is dedicated.

1113
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,151
Yeah. Well, she's the only
one who stuck by me

1114
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,086
after the injury.

1115
00:51:06,122 --> 00:51:07,266
They called it a "career ender,"

1116
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,256
but she never doubted
my comeback.

1117
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:11,025
Well, it's nice to
have someone like that

1118
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,192
in your corner.

1119
00:51:14,163 --> 00:51:15,863
You know, you were always
in my corner.

1120
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:19,133
I'm sorry I walked out of yours.

1121
00:51:19,168 --> 00:51:21,201
How is your confidence tonight?

1122
00:51:21,237 --> 00:51:23,103
On a scale of panic
to arrogance,

1123
00:51:23,139 --> 00:51:25,873
I'd give myself,
a mildly assured.

1124
00:51:25,942 --> 00:51:27,474
But, you know,

1125
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,121
there is no pain right now
so that's good.

1126
00:51:29,145 --> 00:51:30,945
I'm not talking about your knee.

1127
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,980
I'm talking
about your dance moves?

1128
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:36,684
Wyatt said I should, you know,
probably rest my knee,

1129
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,752
- so I'd better pass.
- Please,

1130
00:51:38,788 --> 00:51:40,521
line dancing is like
walking with music.

1131
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,234
You're cleared for
the dance floor, partner.

1132
00:51:42,258 --> 00:51:45,159
Oh, great.

1133
00:51:45,194 --> 00:51:47,061
Great.

1134
00:52:08,517 --> 00:52:10,084
This isn't so hard.

1135
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,187
Wait you guys do this too?!

1136
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:14,655
Every week.

1137
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,357
Kayla and Jenny introduced us.

1138
00:52:16,392 --> 00:52:18,192
It's great exercise.

1139
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,327
What is going on?
My parents are line dancing.

1140
00:52:20,363 --> 00:52:21,773
Yeah. You should hang out
with us more often.

1141
00:52:21,797 --> 00:52:24,131
We're fun.

1142
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,372
No-no-no. Kick.

1143
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,185
You be good to her.

1144
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:46,820
Yes, Sir.

1145
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:53,727
I told you he was a good man.

1146
00:52:55,364 --> 00:52:56,630
And so is his son.

1147
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,807
The old Justin is back.

1148
00:53:06,842 --> 00:53:08,942
Yeah, feels good to be back.

1149
00:53:11,347 --> 00:53:13,681
You know, I spent my life
trying to be this

1150
00:53:13,749 --> 00:53:15,516
great champion, like my dad.

1151
00:53:15,584 --> 00:53:17,284
Well, you succeeded.

1152
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,254
But I was chasing more
than just the win.

1153
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:23,502
I wasn't sure what it was,
but something was missing.

1154
00:53:23,526 --> 00:53:25,292
Did you figure it out?

1155
00:53:25,361 --> 00:53:27,027
I think I did tonight.

1156
00:53:28,898 --> 00:53:30,738
You know, I wanted an gold
medal, and I got it.

1157
00:53:32,234 --> 00:53:33,801
I wanted to be a world
champion. Done.

1158
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:37,004
There was one thing I think
I always wanted

1159
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:39,139
that I could never have.

1160
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:41,842
What is that?

1161
00:53:43,612 --> 00:53:44,978
You.

1162
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:47,448
Justin O'Neill...

1163
00:53:47,483 --> 00:53:49,616
you never asked.

1164
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:07,768
Yeah.

1165
00:54:07,803 --> 00:54:10,104
Get some sleep.

1166
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:12,806
Because we're changing
your training

1167
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,708
to the Winter Classic run
tomorrow.

1168
00:54:16,145 --> 00:54:18,412
Goodnight, Sir.

1169
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,315
Goodnight, Kayla.

1170
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,113
So we did all that crazy
line dancing,

1171
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:43,203
and then I walked her home.

1172
00:54:45,374 --> 00:54:47,007
And?

1173
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:49,309
A gentleman does not
kiss and tell.

1174
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:51,145
Well, it did take you 15 years,

1175
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,680
so I guess good things come
to those who wait, right?

1176
00:54:53,716 --> 00:54:55,516
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

1177
00:54:55,551 --> 00:54:57,818
So, how about you and Kayla?

1178
00:54:57,853 --> 00:55:00,120
You seemed a bit friendly
last night.

1179
00:55:00,156 --> 00:55:02,489
You know me and Kay.
We've always been close.

1180
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,993
Any pain?

1181
00:55:06,028 --> 00:55:08,395
A little.

1182
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,365
But I've got three days.
We'll keep working on it.

1183
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,078
Yeah. Maybe I should quit
while I'm a head.

1184
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,736
Join you on the road.
I can be your team doctor.

1185
00:55:15,805 --> 00:55:17,805
I can be your... your entourage.

1186
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,641
Your personal umbrella carrier.

1187
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:22,776
Yeah... I mean,
if everything goes well,

1188
00:55:22,812 --> 00:55:24,589
I should be back out on the
circuit in a few weeks.

1189
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:25,846
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1190
00:55:25,915 --> 00:55:27,781
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1191
00:55:27,817 --> 00:55:29,149
Just me and you on the road,
huh?!

1192
00:55:29,218 --> 00:55:31,251
- Yeah.
- Hey. No.

1193
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:32,397
Dude, me and Jenny,
we're finally dating.

1194
00:55:32,421 --> 00:55:34,221
I can't leave home now.

1195
00:55:34,256 --> 00:55:36,957
You're on your own, buddy.
You're on your own.

1196
00:55:42,865 --> 00:55:44,409
<i>You seem to be
getting over that.</i>

1197
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:47,300
I am. He's sweet.

1198
00:55:47,335 --> 00:55:48,946
You know, it's about time
you came around, too.

1199
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,104
It's been what?
Two years since Vince.

1200
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,572
Well, I date.

1201
00:55:52,607 --> 00:55:54,574
It's just hard meeting
people in a town

1202
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:57,243
when everyone is always coming
and going, once the snow melts.

1203
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,013
I mean, I can think of one
person who might interest you.

1204
00:56:00,048 --> 00:56:02,015
Really good-looking,
ski champ who just happens

1205
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,594
to be in town for the Winter
Classic this Sunday.

1206
00:56:03,618 --> 00:56:05,885
Oh yes. Hunter Davies...

1207
00:56:05,954 --> 00:56:08,521
oh god, no,
he's too young for me.

1208
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,890
Kay, you've been in love
with Justin O'Neill

1209
00:56:10,926 --> 00:56:12,826
since we were kids,
don't try and deny it.

1210
00:56:12,894 --> 00:56:14,605
- You guys always had a thing.
- I am his coach, Jenny.

1211
00:56:14,629 --> 00:56:16,796
There has to be...

1212
00:56:16,865 --> 00:56:19,232
you know, boundaries.

1213
00:56:19,267 --> 00:56:21,100
But you like coaching
at this level again.

1214
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,869
Yes, I love it.

1215
00:56:22,904 --> 00:56:25,371
Okay. So go on the road
with him.

1216
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:27,907
Like the two of you planned to,
before.

1217
00:56:27,976 --> 00:56:30,710
This is your chance at giving
your dream a real shot, Kay.

1218
00:56:30,779 --> 00:56:32,779
Do not let it slip away again.

1219
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,498
That was better.

1220
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,533
- How much better?
- Well, let's just focus

1221
00:56:53,568 --> 00:56:55,179
on strength and relaxation
for the next few runs.

1222
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,970
Because I can see you're...
you're tense.

1223
00:56:57,005 --> 00:56:58,638
- It's in your jaw.
- Yeah.

1224
00:56:58,673 --> 00:56:59,913
Your form looked good up there.

1225
00:56:59,941 --> 00:57:02,509
- Oh, Nancy. Big fan.
- Ditto.

1226
00:57:02,577 --> 00:57:04,811
You know, I had an ACL tear
a couple years ago.

1227
00:57:04,846 --> 00:57:06,646
Looks like you're doing
everything right.

1228
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:08,381
<i>Both of you.</i>

1229
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:10,950
Well, thank you for saying that.

1230
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:13,286
- Good luck on Sunday.
- Thank you.

1231
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:14,854
Alright. Let's do it.

1232
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,357
Relaxed, focused,

1233
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,092
like when you skied Cortina.
Let's go.

1234
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,693
Alright.

1235
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:30,436
Alright.

1236
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,140
Alright.

1237
00:57:36,378 --> 00:57:38,278
Relax.

1238
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:43,516
Relax.

1239
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,407
Are you okay?!

1240
00:58:09,711 --> 00:58:11,344
Justin! Justin! Ju...

1241
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:14,581
What was my time?

1242
00:58:15,684 --> 00:58:17,350
1:11:44.

1243
00:58:17,385 --> 00:58:19,118
Two tenths off the course
record! Yes!

1244
00:58:19,154 --> 00:58:20,787
What about your knee?

1245
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:22,455
Knee is good, head is good.

1246
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,223
I'm gonna take one more run.

1247
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:25,739
Then, I'm taking you to dinner.

1248
00:58:26,661 --> 00:58:28,261
Let's go!

1249
00:58:36,705 --> 00:58:39,005
I am so sorry, I'm late.

1250
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,974
Our favorite instructor
he almost quit today,

1251
00:58:41,009 --> 00:58:42,086
because we have these twins,
these Ainsleys,

1252
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:44,010
and they come up every season

1253
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,957
and they're a little bit
unruly? So we had to try

1254
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,792
- and talk him out of it.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1255
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,483
It's not the first time I've
been left waiting on a date.

1256
00:58:50,552 --> 00:58:52,719
This is a date?

1257
00:58:52,754 --> 00:58:54,788
- What did you think it was?
- Like a dinner.

1258
00:58:54,856 --> 00:58:56,856
It is a dinner date.

1259
00:58:56,892 --> 00:58:59,359
Didn't we already try that once?

1260
00:58:59,394 --> 00:59:01,861
We were 18. And you had
a crush on Matt Fitzsimmons

1261
00:59:01,897 --> 00:59:03,630
and talked about him
the whole time.

1262
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,098
I dodged a bullet with that one

1263
00:59:05,133 --> 00:59:08,034
- because he is now in jail.
- What? No?

1264
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:09,736
I'm just kidding.
He runs the pharmacy.

1265
00:59:09,771 --> 00:59:11,237
But he knows all our secrets

1266
00:59:11,273 --> 00:59:12,772
so we have to stay
in his good graces.

1267
00:59:12,808 --> 00:59:14,307
Yeah. Everyone...
knows everything

1268
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:15,920
- about everyone around here.
- Yeah, it's part of our charm.

1269
00:59:15,944 --> 00:59:17,710
I know.

1270
00:59:17,746 --> 00:59:19,546
- Table is ready.
- Okay.

1271
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:24,551
<i>Kris Davenport come to town...</i>

1272
00:59:24,586 --> 00:59:26,252
<i>Like the Kris Davenport?</i>

1273
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:28,099
Yeah, and he wanted to
impress his new girlfriend

1274
00:59:28,123 --> 00:59:30,156
so he signed up for a lesson
at the Lodge.

1275
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,058
I mean, this guy
is like James Bond,

1276
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:34,594
he hangs out of helicopters
in his movies,

1277
00:59:34,629 --> 00:59:36,196
but you put him in a pair
of skis,

1278
00:59:36,264 --> 00:59:37,730
he can't even stand upright.

1279
00:59:37,766 --> 00:59:39,666
That's incredible.

1280
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:41,734
Sorry. Can I get your
autograph?

1281
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,770
Yeah. Yeah.

1282
00:59:43,805 --> 00:59:45,905
- Hold that thought?
- That... this is important.

1283
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:48,341
- Thanks. What's your name, bud?
- Brady

1284
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,742
Brady.

1285
00:59:49,778 --> 00:59:52,512
- Hey, are you a big fan?
- Yeah.

1286
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,215
Yeah? Me, too.
Between you and me,

1287
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:56,961
I think he's going to win
that race on Sunday,

1288
00:59:56,985 --> 00:59:59,452
so I would save that autograph.

1289
00:59:59,488 --> 01:00:00,587
It's nice to meet you.

1290
01:00:00,622 --> 01:00:02,755
Thanks.

1291
01:00:10,265 --> 01:00:13,132
You know what? I'll catch
you all on my way out,

1292
01:00:13,201 --> 01:00:15,201
okay? Promise.

1293
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,103
Thank you.

1294
01:00:17,172 --> 01:00:20,874
Sorry. So you were saying,
Kris Davenport...

1295
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,942
So he hired one of our ski
instructors

1296
01:00:22,978 --> 01:00:25,645
to wear his ski clothes,
and go down the run

1297
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,313
while his new girlfriend watched

1298
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:29,015
from the balcony up above.

1299
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,484
- He hired a stunt double?
- Hired a stunt double.

1300
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,620
This is not for a movie.
This was in real life.

1301
01:00:33,655 --> 01:00:35,555
Celebrities can be crazy.

1302
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,258
I mean, not like...
not all of them.

1303
01:00:41,897 --> 01:00:43,897
Do you wanna address the
elephant in the room now?

1304
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,698
I don't think they
allow elephants

1305
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:47,334
- in this establishment.
- You kissed me.

1306
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:49,536
- You kissed ME.
- You liked it.

1307
01:00:49,571 --> 01:00:51,971
- I didn't actually say that.
- You didn't like it?

1308
01:00:52,007 --> 01:00:53,806
I didn't say that either.

1309
01:00:53,842 --> 01:00:55,241
So what does this mean?

1310
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,176
I don't know, you tell me.

1311
01:00:57,245 --> 01:00:58,723
You're the one that's leaving
after the Classic.

1312
01:00:58,747 --> 01:01:00,313
What if I didn't?

1313
01:01:00,382 --> 01:01:02,282
You're thinking of retiring?

1314
01:01:02,317 --> 01:01:04,217
I don't know. Competing never
felt like a job,

1315
01:01:04,252 --> 01:01:06,719
but the thought of leaving

1316
01:01:06,755 --> 01:01:08,421
and going out on the circuit
again just...

1317
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,296
doesn't really excite me
anymore. I don't know.

1318
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,204
Suddenly, I can see my future
and it looks a lot different.

1319
01:01:13,228 --> 01:01:15,295
How?

1320
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,730
I feel like it's here.

1321
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,599
With my family at the lodge...

1322
01:01:21,036 --> 01:01:23,903
with you.

1323
01:01:23,939 --> 01:01:25,638
What do you think about that?

1324
01:01:32,747 --> 01:01:34,647
You really think he's serious
about staying?

1325
01:01:34,683 --> 01:01:36,382
I don't know. Maybe.

1326
01:01:36,451 --> 01:01:38,284
Or maybe he's looking
for a contingency plan,

1327
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,565
in case he doesn't win and he's
forced into early retirement.

1328
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:42,188
Okay. It's only one race.

1329
01:01:42,257 --> 01:01:44,135
He's still got some years left
in him, if he wants it.

1330
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,925
Did you mention going with him?

1331
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:48,161
There really wasn't any point.

1332
01:01:48,229 --> 01:01:50,463
Okay. So... coaching?

1333
01:01:50,532 --> 01:01:52,510
Just because he's done
doesn't mean you have to be.

1334
01:01:52,534 --> 01:01:54,245
No, the time for me
to have really gone for this

1335
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:56,502
was 14 years ago,
right after Justin left.

1336
01:01:56,538 --> 01:01:58,271
You're not gonna know
until you try.

1337
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,973
Kay, this was your dream!

1338
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,375
Maybe dreams can change.

1339
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:03,977
I don't know.

1340
01:02:13,421 --> 01:02:15,622
There he is.
Are you ready for Sunday?

1341
01:02:15,657 --> 01:02:18,091
I will be. I have one more
day of training.

1342
01:02:18,126 --> 01:02:19,692
Good.

1343
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:23,596
I'm not nervous.
Is that weird?

1344
01:02:23,665 --> 01:02:26,299
The absence of nerves,
it was always welcome for me.

1345
01:02:26,334 --> 01:02:29,402
But I mean, they're come back
when you hit the starting gate.

1346
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:33,706
When did you know it was time
for you to hang up your hat?

1347
01:02:42,484 --> 01:02:44,684
I guess, I felt like
I had done everything

1348
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,620
that I wanted to do, and it was
time to set down some roots.

1349
01:02:51,426 --> 01:02:53,559
And yeah, I missed being
on the circuit, but...

1350
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,629
I never regretted it.

1351
01:03:01,269 --> 01:03:02,669
You know what...

1352
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,638
I have something for you.

1353
01:03:05,674 --> 01:03:07,540
Hang on.

1354
01:03:27,295 --> 01:03:29,462
- Your lucky pin.
- Yeah.

1355
01:03:31,733 --> 01:03:33,800
Wore it in every race
after I won my first medal.

1356
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,537
Except one, I forgot it at home.

1357
01:03:38,807 --> 01:03:40,773
- The Swiss Downhill in '84?
- Yeah.

1358
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:42,842
Yeah.

1359
01:03:44,212 --> 01:03:45,978
This brought me a lot of luck.

1360
01:03:47,816 --> 01:03:50,349
I put it in a drawer
the day we bought this place,

1361
01:03:53,354 --> 01:03:55,188
and now it's yours.

1362
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,257
Go on.

1363
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,393
I should've given it to you
years ago.

1364
01:04:01,896 --> 01:04:07,500
I guess...
I was trying to hold on.

1365
01:04:08,503 --> 01:04:10,036
Thanks, Dad.

1366
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,840
I will say this though, Justin.

1367
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,875
When the time does come
for you to call it a day...

1368
01:04:17,612 --> 01:04:19,879
it'll be very clear.

1369
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:30,623
- Kayla. Hi.
- Oh hey.

1370
01:04:30,692 --> 01:04:32,737
- We sort of met the other day.
- No, of course. I remember.

1371
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:34,560
I'm actually glad
I ran into you.

1372
01:04:34,596 --> 01:04:37,263
- Can we go somewhere and talk?
- Sure. I know a place.

1373
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:39,132
- Oh amazing.
- How are you doing?

1374
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,733
Fine.

1375
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:44,504
And you've got some great
training courses here

1376
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:46,250
so I'm doing a bit of a trial
with Al Fielding.

1377
01:04:46,274 --> 01:04:48,174
He trains Hunter Davies,

1378
01:04:48,209 --> 01:04:49,976
and we wanted to see
if he'd be a good fit.

1379
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,613
- He's one of the very best.
- He is. Yes.

1380
01:04:53,648 --> 01:04:55,025
And I'm just not feeling him
at all.

1381
01:04:55,049 --> 01:04:56,716
You know, he...

1382
01:04:56,751 --> 01:04:58,851
Well, Hunter requires
a lot of attention.

1383
01:04:58,887 --> 01:05:01,754
- He's a star.
- Yeah, but so are you.

1384
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:03,689
Maybe so, but that's not
what it's about for me.

1385
01:05:03,725 --> 01:05:05,525
Yeah. It's a delicate
balance.

1386
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,226
- I know that can be very hard.
- Yeah.

1387
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:10,229
What's even harder is just
trying to find the right coach.

1388
01:05:10,298 --> 01:05:12,698
It's like a marriage, you know?

1389
01:05:12,767 --> 01:05:14,478
If only there was an app
to help you find your mate.

1390
01:05:14,502 --> 01:05:16,903
Well, my dad said,

1391
01:05:16,938 --> 01:05:19,138
a key to a good pairing
is just when you each bring

1392
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:21,407
something to the table that
the other can benefit from.

1393
01:05:21,442 --> 01:05:23,109
And what do you bring
to the table?

1394
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,345
Sorry?

1395
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:28,447
I've been doing some
poking around.

1396
01:05:28,516 --> 01:05:31,551
Asked a few questions about you
and I like what I'm hearing.

1397
01:05:31,586 --> 01:05:33,486
From who?

1398
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:35,288
Well, Tom O'Neill, for starters.

1399
01:05:35,323 --> 01:05:36,522
He thinks the world of you.

1400
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,158
And I've always thought
the world of him.

1401
01:05:39,294 --> 01:05:41,105
I used to watch him when he
trained with your father.

1402
01:05:41,129 --> 01:05:42,528
Yeah. They were quite a team.

1403
01:05:42,597 --> 01:05:44,263
Yes, they were.

1404
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:48,212
He also mentioned that you're
something of a temporary coach

1405
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:49,802
for Justin O'Neill.

1406
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:52,538
This is true.
We've known each other forever

1407
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,841
and I used to coach him
back in the day.

1408
01:05:54,876 --> 01:05:57,043
What about after the Classic?

1409
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,811
Are you going to continue
with him?

1410
01:05:58,847 --> 01:06:00,980
I... don't know.

1411
01:06:01,015 --> 01:06:04,050
I mean, I run the ski school
and I coach the junior racers...

1412
01:06:04,118 --> 01:06:06,118
I've been watching you
this week,

1413
01:06:06,154 --> 01:06:07,453
and I think you're a real
talent.

1414
01:06:07,488 --> 01:06:09,021
Thank you.

1415
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,901
Look, I leave early Sunday
morning for the Zurich

1416
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,159
Invitational next week.
Then onto Courchevel to train.

1417
01:06:13,228 --> 01:06:15,127
I've got a place out there

1418
01:06:15,163 --> 01:06:17,396
and I would love for you
to come on board as my coach.

1419
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:20,700
Nancy, I am so flattered, I...

1420
01:06:20,735 --> 01:06:24,170
but I can't leave Justin
right before the race.

1421
01:06:24,205 --> 01:06:26,505
I know. It's a lot to ask.

1422
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:28,908
But you did your job
and you did it well.

1423
01:06:28,977 --> 01:06:30,543
I watched him out there today,

1424
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,746
he's ready.

1425
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,282
So the thing to consider is...

1426
01:06:36,317 --> 01:06:38,150
what's the next step for you?

1427
01:06:39,888 --> 01:06:41,888
Why don't you think about it
and we can talk later?

1428
01:07:36,878 --> 01:07:39,045
Do you have a few minutes
to talk? Can I come over?

1429
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,747
Yeah. I'm on the patio
in front of the Lodge.

1430
01:07:57,799 --> 01:07:59,632
Hey. Hey.

1431
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:01,267
Hey.

1432
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,773
You know, I was just thinking
about something

1433
01:08:07,842 --> 01:08:09,875
- my dad said to me.
- What's that?

1434
01:08:09,911 --> 01:08:12,578
He said, "you'll know
when it's time."

1435
01:08:12,647 --> 01:08:14,847
Time for what?

1436
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,482
The next chapter.

1437
01:08:17,986 --> 01:08:20,486
And I'm ready.
I'm ready.

1438
01:08:20,521 --> 01:08:23,356
There is no roots for me
in New York.

1439
01:08:23,424 --> 01:08:26,092
I want a life, I want a family.

1440
01:08:27,662 --> 01:08:30,229
I want to ski all day
and sit out here at night.

1441
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,668
Everything I care
about is right here.

1442
01:08:37,972 --> 01:08:40,906
Nothing has ever been
more clear.

1443
01:08:40,975 --> 01:08:42,808
<i>I need to tell you something.</i>

1444
01:08:42,844 --> 01:08:46,312
Nancy Sieber asked me
to be her coach.

1445
01:08:53,054 --> 01:08:55,254
That's... not what I was
expecting you to say.

1446
01:09:11,706 --> 01:09:13,139
You have to do it, Kay.

1447
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,576
It's your turn.

1448
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:19,245
That's what I came to tell you.

1449
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,714
I mean, I just need to see
or else...

1450
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:23,082
I'll always regret it.

1451
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:28,354
You are gonna be so great.

1452
01:09:32,493 --> 01:09:34,193
There's more.

1453
01:09:34,228 --> 01:09:37,263
She's leaving Sunday morning
before the race.

1454
01:09:39,267 --> 01:09:41,167
She, she just needs
a few days in Zurich

1455
01:09:41,202 --> 01:09:42,968
to acclimate and prep
for the Invitational.

1456
01:09:43,004 --> 01:09:45,671
Then onto her place
to train in France.

1457
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,474
That's really short notice.

1458
01:09:48,543 --> 01:09:50,087
I feel so terrible
leaving you like this.

1459
01:09:50,111 --> 01:09:51,911
Don't. Don't.

1460
01:09:51,946 --> 01:09:53,746
I'm ready, Kay, because of you.

1461
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:55,881
You got me back.

1462
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:57,795
Well, you know, I want you
to run the course tomorrow,

1463
01:09:57,819 --> 01:09:59,852
but don't over do it.

1464
01:09:59,887 --> 01:10:01,787
And I am available by phone
in the morning

1465
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:03,789
before we get on that plane
by 9:00.

1466
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,624
It's okay, believe me.

1467
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,137
There is nothing my dad
would love more

1468
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,161
than to take over my last
day of training.

1469
01:10:09,197 --> 01:10:11,230
You know, I can come back
in the off-season.

1470
01:10:11,265 --> 01:10:13,566
It doesn't have to be the end.

1471
01:10:13,601 --> 01:10:15,468
I don't wanna hold you back.

1472
01:10:16,704 --> 01:10:18,137
This life can take over,

1473
01:10:18,206 --> 01:10:20,739
and I want you to experience
everything it has to offer.

1474
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,680
I love you.

1475
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,650
I've always loved you,
Justin O'Neill.

1476
01:10:33,154 --> 01:10:34,620
Me too.

1477
01:10:36,491 --> 01:10:38,657
Just wish we could have
figured it out sooner.

1478
01:11:22,905 --> 01:11:24,705
<i>We're gonna miss you
around here.</i>

1479
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:27,341
I talked to the parents
of the Mountain Junior Racers,

1480
01:11:27,376 --> 01:11:28,687
they're so thrilled
that Jenny is taking over.

1481
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:30,143
Good.

1482
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:31,523
Well, they might change
their minds

1483
01:11:31,547 --> 01:11:33,180
after the first couple
of lessons.

1484
01:11:33,215 --> 01:11:34,559
- Stop it.
- You're gonna be great.

1485
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,249
And I'm always here to help.

1486
01:11:36,285 --> 01:11:38,118
It's going to be so quiet
without her.

1487
01:11:38,153 --> 01:11:39,431
I'm even going to miss
her snoring.

1488
01:11:39,455 --> 01:11:41,455
- Oh stop.
- Okay. She's not gonna have

1489
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:43,590
time to miss me
because she has a Wyatt now.

1490
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:46,393
Now listen, you
call us anytime, Kayla.

1491
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:48,562
- For anything.
- We mean that.

1492
01:11:48,597 --> 01:11:51,898
I cannot thank you enough
for all that you've do for us.

1493
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:54,134
Thank you for all
you've done for Justin.

1494
01:11:54,169 --> 01:11:56,403
Can you go easy on him?

1495
01:11:56,472 --> 01:11:58,705
Hey, easy doesn't win races.

1496
01:11:58,774 --> 01:12:00,807
What? I'm kidding.
Come on.

1497
01:12:00,843 --> 01:12:02,976
<i>You got him
where he needs to be,</i>

1498
01:12:03,012 --> 01:12:05,912
<i>and Tom will gently guide him
over the finish line.</i>

1499
01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:07,981
But quickly...

1500
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,316
I love you.

1501
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,086
Take good care.

1502
01:12:16,859 --> 01:12:18,892
<i>Alright, I'm going home to pack,</i>

1503
01:12:20,362 --> 01:12:21,628
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1504
01:12:50,559 --> 01:12:52,059
How was it?

1505
01:12:52,127 --> 01:12:54,461
Justin that was good.
A minute, fourteen.

1506
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:56,329
Looked a little icy up there.

1507
01:12:56,365 --> 01:12:57,964
Not my best time.

1508
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,833
- I'm gonna take one more run.
- No.

1509
01:12:59,902 --> 01:13:01,379
Don't overdo it. You wanna be
fresh for tomorrow.

1510
01:13:01,403 --> 01:13:03,136
Dad, I gotta shave
some time off.

1511
01:13:03,205 --> 01:13:05,539
What you're gonna do, is
you gonna trust yourself, huh?

1512
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:08,575
You're a champion.

1513
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:10,490
You're gonna shave off
more time when it counts.

1514
01:13:11,647 --> 01:13:13,580
You've got this.

1515
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:17,150
Son... you do.

1516
01:13:18,454 --> 01:13:19,886
You've got this.

1517
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:30,630
You all packed?

1518
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:32,544
All packed and ready with
a shiny, new passport.

1519
01:13:32,568 --> 01:13:34,201
Remind me to renew mine.

1520
01:13:34,236 --> 01:13:36,336
Because I am gonna come
and visit you in Europe.

1521
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:38,004
Any time.

1522
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,341
- Are you excited?!
- Yeah.

1523
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:44,277
- You paused.
- I was breathing.

1524
01:13:44,313 --> 01:13:47,214
It was a pause slash breath.

1525
01:13:47,282 --> 01:13:49,116
Are you sure this is
really what you want?

1526
01:13:49,151 --> 01:13:50,851
Yeah.

1527
01:13:52,321 --> 01:13:54,754
It was just hard saying
goodbye to Justin last night.

1528
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:57,791
But it's not goodbye forever.

1529
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:00,127
You know,
it's just goodbye for now.

1530
01:14:10,772 --> 01:14:12,584
<i>The day we have
all been waiting for</i>

1531
01:14:12,608 --> 01:14:15,742
<i>is finally here,
as we are now just hours away</i>

1532
01:14:15,777 --> 01:14:18,979
<i>from the 55th Annual Winter
Classic Men's Downhill.</i>

1533
01:14:20,816 --> 01:14:22,594
The pancakes give me
a little bit extra weight.

1534
01:14:22,618 --> 01:14:24,784
I ate too much.

1535
01:14:24,853 --> 01:14:26,620
Conditions are perfect.

1536
01:14:26,688 --> 01:14:28,588
No kidding.

1537
01:14:28,624 --> 01:14:31,057
<i>They're good.</i>

1538
01:14:34,363 --> 01:14:35,962
Yeah, conditions look good
out there,

1539
01:14:35,998 --> 01:14:37,664
and I'll definitely be able
to handled it

1540
01:14:37,699 --> 01:14:39,866
now that I'm part
of the Snow Voltz Team.

1541
01:14:39,935 --> 01:14:42,002
<i>Congratulation.</i>

1542
01:14:42,037 --> 01:14:44,104
Oh thank you. Thank you.
I'm very proud.

1543
01:14:44,139 --> 01:14:46,139
They told me he hadn't decided.

1544
01:14:46,175 --> 01:14:48,575
- He clearly has now.
- Don't let it throw you.

1545
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,243
They aren't the only game
in town.

1546
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:52,012
There are other sponsors here.

1547
01:14:52,047 --> 01:14:54,014
I'm fine. It's okay.

1548
01:14:54,049 --> 01:14:56,483
Everything that doesn't serve
you up there is just noise.

1549
01:14:56,518 --> 01:14:59,085
- Block it out.
- Consider it blocked.

1550
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,724
How are you feeling, Justin?

1551
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:06,660
I got a good night's sleep.
Knee is strong.

1552
01:15:06,695 --> 01:15:08,828
- I'm ready to go.
- I'm loving the confidence.

1553
01:15:08,864 --> 01:15:10,642
So what do have to you say
to all those people

1554
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:12,986
who have chosen Hunter Davies
as the favorite to win today?

1555
01:15:13,835 --> 01:15:15,302
I'd say...

1556
01:15:17,272 --> 01:15:18,972
the final race of a man's
career should be

1557
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:21,374
one for the books.

1558
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,410
So stay tuned.

1559
01:15:23,445 --> 01:15:25,579
Justin are you announcing
your retirement?

1560
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:27,314
- 'Scuse me.
- Thank you very much.

1561
01:15:27,349 --> 01:15:28,815
Justin, are you retiring?

1562
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,184
- Justin, one more comment?
- You're sure?

1563
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:34,354
- Yep.
- We had a good run.

1564
01:15:36,425 --> 01:15:38,758
We had a great run.

1565
01:15:40,963 --> 01:15:43,196
Okay.
Let's go get you ready.

1566
01:15:43,232 --> 01:15:44,898
Let's do this.

1567
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:53,873
So you ready to start
this adventure?

1568
01:15:53,909 --> 01:15:56,476
- Yes, I am.
- This is a bit of a whirlwind,

1569
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:58,523
but I want you to know that I
have a good feeling about this.

1570
01:15:58,547 --> 01:16:00,647
Thank you so much
for believing in me.

1571
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:02,427
Yeah. So I wanna go over
the rankings in the car

1572
01:16:02,451 --> 01:16:04,417
and develop a strategy.

1573
01:16:04,453 --> 01:16:06,052
You'll see there's not
a lot of air

1574
01:16:06,088 --> 01:16:07,732
- between first and third place...
- Right.

1575
01:16:07,756 --> 01:16:09,889
And I intend to crack that.

1576
01:16:09,925 --> 01:16:12,259
I know, it's hard to leave home.

1577
01:16:12,294 --> 01:16:13,760
I feel that way every time.

1578
01:16:13,795 --> 01:16:16,196
No, I'm fine.
We're gonna get you on top.

1579
01:16:16,231 --> 01:16:18,565
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes.

1580
01:16:20,135 --> 01:16:23,870
<i>Okay. So, Renata Verini
had a great run in Finland,</i>

1581
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:26,473
but hasn't been able to
crack the top three since.

1582
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:41,365
<i>It's a beautiful day
here on Winter Mountain</i>

1583
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:43,723
<i>and the 55th annual
Winter Classic!</i>

1584
01:16:43,758 --> 01:16:46,559
<i>Today the question on
everybody's mind is,</i>

1585
01:16:46,595 --> 01:16:49,362
<i>Can three time Classic Gold
Medal Winner, Justin O'Neill,</i>

1586
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:51,631
<i>pull an upset over the current
odds-on favorite,</i>

1587
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:53,499
<i>newcomer Hunter Davies.</i>

1588

<i>Our first racer on the day,

<i>of anyone in this years
Winter Classic.</i>

1591
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,080
<i>And he's off!</i>

1592
01:17:18,827 --> 01:17:21,494
<i>Anthony Norman another
first-timer for this Classic,</i>

1593
01:17:21,529 --> 01:17:23,029
<i>has yet to place
in the top three</i>

1594
01:17:23,098 --> 01:17:25,999
<i>since joining the professional
circuit in 2019.</i>

1595
01:17:38,546 --> 01:17:41,381
Justin, mo matter
what happens here,

1596
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:43,416
you've had a career
to be proud of.

1597
01:17:43,485 --> 01:17:45,365
I learned from the best.

1598
01:17:46,121 --> 01:17:47,687
Okay.

1599
01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:50,523
Remember you stay high in
that turn on the forth knoll.

1600
01:17:50,592 --> 01:17:52,692
- Great.
- Hey...

1601
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:54,894
- go get 'em.
- Alright.

1602

<i>Hunter Davies to the start gate.</i>

1604
01:18:06,441 --> 01:18:09,042
Hey. Good luck.

1605
01:18:09,077 --> 01:18:10,843
May the best man win.

1606
01:18:12,147 --> 01:18:13,324
<i>It's been an exciting Classic</i>

1607
01:18:13,348 --> 01:18:15,314
<i>with only six tenths of a second</i>

1608
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:16,883
<i>separating fourth place
from first,</i>

1609
01:18:16,951 --> 01:18:19,585

1610
01:18:25,794 --> 01:18:27,727

<i>Hunter Davies the youngest
member of the US Ski Team,</i>

1614
01:19:08,069 --> 01:19:09,669

1615
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:11,971

1619
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:29,922
Oh boy.

1620
01:19:39,768 --> 01:19:41,368
<i>And our last racer of the day,</i>

1621
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:43,970

<i>Can he bring home
win number four.</i>

1624
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:06,826
One last time.

1625
01:20:30,819 --> 01:20:32,418
- Good start. Good start.
- Good start.

1626
01:20:37,425 --> 01:20:40,059
<i>This is the
Justin O'Neill we all remember</i>

1627
01:20:40,094 --> 01:20:42,228
<i>before taking that spill
in Austria.</i>

1628
01:20:45,099 --> 01:20:46,499
Come on, Justin.
Come on.

1629
01:20:48,236 --> 01:20:50,069
<i>Justin O'Neil is looking</i>

<i>better than ever, folks!</i>

1631

<i>And if he's able to maintain
this pace</i>

1632
01:20:53,741 --> 01:20:56,342
<i>rounding that final turn
we could have an upset here.</i>

1633
01:20:56,377 --> 01:20:58,177
- Come on, Justin!
- He's on fire!

1634
01:20:58,213 --> 01:21:00,246
Atta boy, J!

1635
01:21:10,692 --> 01:21:13,025
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1636
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:20,233
<i>In an incredible upset,</i>

1637
01:21:20,301 --> 01:21:22,869
<i>Justin O'Neill, who just today
announced his retirement,</i>

Yeah!

1642
01:21:39,354 --> 01:21:42,188
You did it!

1643
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:50,863
You did good.

1644
01:21:50,932 --> 01:21:53,032
You did it!

1645
01:21:53,101 --> 01:21:54,834
What a race!

1646
01:21:54,903 --> 01:21:56,569
It was good luck.

1647
01:21:56,604 --> 01:21:58,437
No. You didn't need the luck.

1648
01:21:58,473 --> 01:22:01,240
- You were amazing.
- Thank you, Mom?

1649
01:22:09,317 --> 01:22:11,651
I'll be back.

1650
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:20,259
What are you doing here?

1651
01:22:20,295 --> 01:22:22,461
What... what about Nancy
and Zurich and...

1652
01:22:22,497 --> 01:22:24,563
She went on to Zurich
without me,

1653
01:22:24,599 --> 01:22:26,265
but she'll be back
after the race.

1654
01:22:26,301 --> 01:22:27,444
'Cause she's gonna train here
with me.

1655
01:22:27,468 --> 01:22:29,368
- Really?
- Yes!

1656
01:22:29,404 --> 01:22:30,981
'Cause I'm gonna be
a professional coach.

1657
01:22:31,005 --> 01:22:32,838
And I'm gonna do it here
from Winter Mountain.

1658
01:22:32,874 --> 01:22:34,785
I mean, after all we do have
the best training courses around.

1659
01:22:34,809 --> 01:22:36,642
That, we do.

1660
01:22:36,678 --> 01:22:38,644
So, it really is true...

1661
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,213
you can have roots
and your dreams.

1662
01:22:41,282 --> 01:22:42,848
That's my plan.

1663
01:22:44,185 --> 01:22:45,484
This is where I belong.

1664
01:22:47,188 --> 01:22:49,350
This is where we belong.
