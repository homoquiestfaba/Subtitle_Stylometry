Doctor, I need that kid ready for

Colonel, that young man was lucky
to survive the surgery.

114
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,144
I realize that, Doctor.

115
00:15:56,348 --> 00:16:01,397
What is at risk here... are the lives
of thousands of innocent people.

116

We'll have to wait
and see what happens.

00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,763
He is our only
hope, doctor.

122
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,972
If the situation changes,
I'll let you know immediately.

123

Is all well with the
handle the shield?

127
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,327
I would need a bit
more time to practice.

128
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,027
It will take me a month.

129
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,789
Do not worry.

130
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:16,044
There are two men of the resistance
down there that will take you through the fields...

131

Vaselli the doctor...
made for you.

134
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,229
- She did not know much about camouflage.
- No.

135
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:31,835
But if you loved the colors
red, white and blue.

136
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,344
Colonel Louis...

137
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:44,806
...Sir? There is something
than anyone has spoken.

When sending
new troops for my battalion.

139
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:52,051
Dr. Vaselli had all the details
the process in his head.

140
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:54,084
He wrote nothing.

141
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:58,419
The same applies to materials
with those who did the uniform and shield.

142
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:01,796
He believed that in this way
would be safer.

143
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,927
Sorry. I think you are it only
of its kind that will be never.

If... Colonel.

147
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:18,300

My American brother
has arrived.

153
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:37,942
Holy crap!

154
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:09,473
Well, an American.

155
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:13,389
Just when I needed one for
practice my English lessons.

156
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,701
It seems that Americans have made
a bad choice with their champion.

157
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:28,661
Have compassion with him.
It's like a child.

158
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:38,253
Dr. Vaselli
died for a failure.

159
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:49,449
Where is the pen
my aunt?

160
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:52,563
The pen of my aunt is
on the table.

161
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:57,205
Did I say good American?
I want to speak English well...

162
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,536
...When I get to New York!

163
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:15,702
All in their positions
for launch!

164
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:18,754
You are a perfect symbol
of America, brother...

165
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:23,219
...Weak, full of self-pity. Share
failed even teaching me English.

166
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,646
But... I practiced
while you were sleeping.

167
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:31,530
Where goes the big bomb?
The large pump heads to...

168
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:37,705
How say... Casa Bianca?
No, do not tell me. I know, it's...

169
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:42,468
...The White House. A gift for
President Roosevelt.

170
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:48,391
Tell me, do you think I could be
President of the United States?

- Listen!
- It's time to fly.

174
00:23:04,838 --> 00:23:07,990
You can travel cheaper
on this flight, you sick fuck!

175
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:10,802
Stop the Launch!
Stop it or I'll take you with me!

00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:13,012
- Stop it!
- Bastard!

177
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:17,984
Unable to stop him!
It's too late!

178
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:26,828
Drop!
I slice off!

179
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:29,638

180
00:23:58,147 --> 00:23:59,615
Thomas Kimball!

181
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:06,626
What are you doing up?
It's four in the morning!

182
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:11,116
How do you want to sleep, Mom?
We are in Washington D.C.

183
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,732
And that's where we'll be
in the morning when you get up.

184
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,682
- Get into bed.
- But I want to see the president!

185
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:21,545
Do not wake daddy. He has a meeting
in the State Department early.

186
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:24,733
When I Grow Up
I will be the president.

187
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,667
Good night.

188
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:36,748
Go to sleep, Mr. President.

189
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:46,046
Somewhere in Alaska.

190
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:28,037
And the guy on the rocket,
changed the course...

191
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:31,970
Avoided... and to blow up the White House
with President Roosevelt.

192
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:33,955
You believe me, do you, Sam?

193
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:41,569
Trust you? The photos do not lie,
and best friends either.

194
00:26:41,746 --> 00:26:45,877
Lucky I'm your friend. You know why
did not fly to pieces, right?

195
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,938
- Why?
- Because I lent my locket...

196
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,886
Captain... Midnight.
You had it on, right?

197
00:26:52,222 --> 00:26:55,167
Yes!
I wore!

198
00:26:56,758 --> 00:27:00,678
- Do you see? I told you.
- Thank you, Sam.

199
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:04,060
All right, all right.
Let's see.

200
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,839
We have to find
who he was.

201
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:11,514
- Did you have a trident?
- No, I had a trident.

202
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:14,960
Right. It was not the Sub-Mariner
and could not be the Human Torch...

203
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:17,527
Had flown... or rocket
before it could land.

204
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:19,777
Did he use a mask?

205
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:24,342
Yes, it was blue with a
"A" white in it.

206
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,500
Very interesting, Tom.

207
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,162
God, this is going to be a great story
for the school newspaper.

208
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,579
It was the most beautiful thing I saw... and never
forget it, Sam, ever again.

209
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,006
Today we celebrate
the surrender of Japan.

210
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,051

Mr. President!

254
00:29:53,968 --> 00:29:57,665
Well, I was here reading
their environmental project...

255
00:29:57,864 --> 00:29:59,201
I say... and it will not
work, sir.

256
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,108
General Fleming, these laws are
enacted as they are written...

257
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:07,324
...And neither you nor the Pentagon have
senators sufficient to prevent it.

258
00:30:09,223 --> 00:30:13,988
I want to live on a planet
clean as much as anyone...

259
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,585
...But you can not expect the
Army reduce its budget...

260
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,844
...By 90% in just six months.

261
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,764
So you want to negotiate.

262
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:24,740
Yes, yes, sir.
Of course I do, sir.

263
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,534
Then go and buy
a used car.

264
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:30,173

265
00:30:31,401 --> 00:30:33,341

go straight down the drain!

head spin.

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,408
Are not you being a little
dramatic general?

279
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:29,109
No, it is not.

280
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,273
Enough trash.

281
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:35,533
I just wanna know... when we
to kill the little son of a bitch?

282
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:37,629
But how?

283
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,747
- Do not kill at all.
- Do not we?

284
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:46,930
No... the murder
is a world of trouble.

285
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:52,502
It took me two years to find Sirhan
and three found Oswald.

286
00:31:53,217 --> 00:31:57,583

more than 22 million.

287
00:31:58,147 --> 00:32:00,711

so hard?

I am a humble businessman...

...Interested in science.

293
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,429
Before you take
a decision...

294
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:35,507
I can suggest... why instead
Kimball killing...

295
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:40,065
What we control... using an implant
brain that I made up myself?

296
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:43,371
Then he will do everything
what we want.

297
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:52,328
I saw him around here.

298
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,702

so, what can we do?

306
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:52,030

not confusion?

found in Alaska.

317
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:15,223

This finding may give...

318

Key... this whole issue

- If this guy can speak to...

320

can give us valuable.

- "... It is October 17, 1993... "

347
00:40:39,763 --> 00:40:40,958
Right.

348
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:46,363
We are in 1943 and... I am
one Nazi spy.

349
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:49,196
So, why am I
asking questions...

350
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:50,766
...On my own side?

351
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:52,876
Look.

352
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:54,283
Do you mind?

353
00:40:54,384 --> 00:40:57,303
Just tell me everything you know
about the guy they called...

354
00:40:57,404 --> 00:41:00,909
...Red Skull, appeared
in 1942.

355
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,739
Yes, still alive.

356
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:06,885
We do not know where it is,
or who he is.

357
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:10,458
We know that you are using the name
it did before the war...

358
00:41:11,112 --> 00:41:13,247
...And has been
extensive plastic surgery.

359
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:18,612
And we know that is the key to a
powerful international organization...

360
00:41:19,484 --> 00:41:25,749
I think... is responsible for the vast
of the pain and misery of the world.

361
00:41:26,203 --> 00:41:30,693
You see, I have evidence
that Red Skull...

362
00:41:31,144 --> 00:41:33,487
Was closely linked...
in the murder of...

363
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:36,929
...Robert Kennedy, John Kennedy,
Martin Luther King...

364
00:41:39,936 --> 00:41:41,449
By God!

365
00:41:44,123 --> 00:41:46,947
Not even know who
I'm talking about, right?

366
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,183
Look, the point is this...

367
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:53,175
The next target... Red Skull
Kimball is president.

368
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:57,762
And if this country loses Tom Kimball,
will be a disaster.

...You have to help us.

372
00:42:02,455 --> 00:42:06,509
There was a scientist,
Italian. His name was...

373
00:42:06,677 --> 00:42:10,773
Dr. Vasili...,
Doctor? Vaselli?

374
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:12,946
Si.

375
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:15,854
Well, she should have known
which was its previous name...

376
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:19,947
...Maybe had some
paper or a journal.

377
00:42:20,323 --> 00:42:22,022
Do you know where could
have left?

378
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:26,854
Can you stop the car, please?
I think I'm gonna puke.

379
00:42:27,218 --> 00:42:29,782
- What?
- Can you stop the car, please?

380
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,779
I'm dizzy.

381
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:34,957
Okay, right away.

382
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:03,303
Hey!
Captain!

383
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:05,897
Are you okay?

384
00:43:07,763 --> 00:43:09,358
Wait!

385
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:13,281
Wait!
Do not leave me here!

386
00:43:28,888 --> 00:43:30,479

Hey!

390
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:07,950
Hello friend.
Do you have a cigarette?

391
00:46:18,797 --> 00:46:20,056
Bernie?

392
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:23,142
- Bernie!
- Hey, stay away!

393
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:26,240
- Dad! Mom!
- Sharon?

394
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,513
This idiot tried
to attack!

395
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:38,971
God!

396
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:41,807
No, no!

397
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:52,738
Bernie...

398
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,227
Do you know this guy?

399
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:01,195
Yes, I know.

400
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:24,390
This I can not be real.

401
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,148
It is.

402
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:45,742
Everyone said "missing in action"
was just another way of saying...

403
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:47,874
...That blew.

404
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,126
But I never believed them.
Not for a second.

405
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,074
I knew you were alive.

406
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:04,825
I think that's why
I stayed with the house.

407
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:09,814
For you to know
where to find me.

408
00:48:11,536 --> 00:48:14,248
Jack is a good man.

409
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:17,030
It is a good father.

410
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:29,456
I was 38...

411
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:34,892
...Wanted to have children before they
was too late.

412
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:37,515
You waited for me...

413
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:41,490
16 years... why?

414
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,211
Steve, I...

415
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:53,672
I feel so old... and ugly
and look at you.

416
00:48:55,704 --> 00:49:02,596
You... ugly? Not a chance.
Oh, Bernie!

417
00:49:02,704 --> 00:49:05,006
Guess it was not
our destiny.

He won the Pulitzer Prize

If anyone can guide
Captain America, he can.

428
00:49:52,184 --> 00:49:54,798
You had it.

429
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,148
You saw him.

430
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,151

Thanks for helping me and let me
use your department, Sharon.

441
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,655
Sure, anything.

442
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,706
I guess they did not have
video recorders where you were.

443
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,046
No.

00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:07,740

- Used to be.

- You have no reason to believe...

449
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,596
...I understand.

450
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:39,351
But it is very important that
find Captain America...

451
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:40,900
...As soon as possible.

452
00:52:41,002 --> 00:52:44,150

interested in anything that sells.

Please, I'm on your side.
I can prove it, single-

455
00:52:55,178 --> 00:52:56,331

456
00:52:57,676 --> 00:52:58,941
No lo-

457
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,720
Where is the
Captain America?

458
00:53:06,156 --> 00:53:07,876
Everything is true.

459
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,522
All that said,
was true.

460
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:18,361
All I saw in
this book.

461
00:53:19,203 --> 00:53:22,953
It is true. Means
Red Skull is still alive.

462
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:28,630
If I had done with him,
none of this would have happened.

463
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:30,620
God!

464
00:53:31,213 --> 00:53:33,165
I have to find it.

465
00:53:34,399 --> 00:53:36,937
Dr. Vaselli
kept a diary.

466
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:40,855
I bet he has written
Red Skull's real name.

467
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:47,819
Hello?

468
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:55,352
No!

00:54:01,812 --> 00:54:03,324
Daddy?

470
00:54:07,727 --> 00:54:12,601
They kept asking
Where was Captain America.

471
00:54:13,405 --> 00:54:15,098
She did not tell...

472
00:54:16,564 --> 00:54:19,048
...Even when...

473
00:54:19,786 --> 00:54:21,403
What?

474
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:23,697
Daddy?

475
00:54:27,191 --> 00:54:30,438
He'll be fine, miss. Is a wound
slight bullet, but is in shock.

00:54:30,597 --> 00:54:31,867

The medallion... the
Captain Midnight.

481
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:53,319
Give it to Tom.

483
00:54:57,011 --> 00:54:58,667
Sure, Sam.

484
00:55:01,976 --> 00:55:05,510
Have you had a heart. You have to perform CPR.
Step aside, please.

485
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,098

521
00:58:14,873 --> 00:58:16,541
No, wait!
You can not go in there!

522
00:58:18,903 --> 00:58:21,663
- Stop right there!
- Sharon, calm down!

523
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,670
Come on.

524
00:59:17,035 --> 00:59:20,533
<i>Thanks to you, I have the opportunity
to amend something I did wrong. </ i></i>

525
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:31,679
By God.
Everything is true!

526
00:59:32,017 --> 00:59:33,344
Where is?

527
00:59:42,733 --> 00:59:45,826
The Vaselli daily.
Found it!

528
01:00:17,517 --> 01:00:21,103
They are here. I'm sure.

529
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:23,530
They are ours.

530
01:00:40,877 --> 01:00:42,080
Damn.

531
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:47,604
Shoot!

532
01:00:56,615 --> 01:01:00,178
The diary of Dr. Vaselli.
I'll bring the Red Skull.

533
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:47,207
That's why Bernie.

534
01:02:10,074 --> 01:02:11,917
Enough is enough, clown.

535
01:02:50,257 --> 01:02:52,569
Where is?
Where is Red Skull?

536
01:02:52,868 --> 01:02:55,870
I know nothing.
None of us knows.

537
01:02:57,383 --> 01:03:00,307
We received our orders
of Red Skull's daughter.

538
01:03:36,307 --> 01:03:38,679
"It had happened
a summer in Venice ".

539
01:03:39,112 --> 01:03:40,282
Wait, here it is!

540
01:03:40,876 --> 01:03:43,142
"I never knew the name
the poor child...

541
01:03:43,356 --> 01:03:46,102
But I heard that wine...
a town called...

542
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:47,869
Portovenere... in northern
of Italy ".

543
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:54,032
"The child was taken from a house
on Via Cavour in the Angelis Tri house ".

544
01:03:54,729 --> 01:03:56,441
The house of the three angels.

545
01:03:58,082 --> 01:04:01,739
Maybe someone in the know Portovenere
Red Skull's name as a child.

546
01:04:06,921 --> 01:04:11,143
Are they still here? Why not
make and end at once?

547
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,841
I wish I could do it,
Mr. President, but...

548
01:04:15,424 --> 01:04:19,587
...Unfortunately, those chemicals
have to act in the brain...

549
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:25,548
...For 24 hours before the
tissue can accept the implant.

550
01:04:25,885 --> 01:04:30,079
Are you crazy just... or search
something in particular?

551
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,864
Looking for what?

552
01:04:31,965 --> 01:04:35,082
I may be president of the
USA.

553
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:38,365
Is not that
the dream of every child?

554
01:04:38,788 --> 01:04:40,549
How stupid
think we are?

555
01:04:40,869 --> 01:04:44,265
My people will find this place
in much less than 24 hours.

556
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,932
Oh, no!
A transmitter hidden.

557
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,463
Does it look something like...

558
01:04:53,749 --> 01:04:56,033
...This?

559
01:04:56,816 --> 01:05:02,124
Extracted a molar pain
bottom right like this...

560
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:04,512
...While I was unconscious.

561
01:05:04,513 --> 01:05:08,037
It was very easy to disable. But
do not worry...

562
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:11,402
...Next time, we will
build in Japan.

563
01:05:11,803 --> 01:05:14,654
Well, I'll see you in...

564
01:05:15,418 --> 01:05:18,392
...Say 24 hours,
Mr. President.

565
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:35,738
Well, now, here is Rome
and here is Portovenere.

566
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:39,190
If we do not stop, we can be there
for lunch.

567
01:05:44,454 --> 01:05:48,026
Sharon? Would you stop for a second?
I think I'm gonna puke.

568
01:05:48,215 --> 01:05:50,973
Does Captain America tide
going by car?

569
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:01,658
Are you okay?

570
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,150
What are you doing?

571
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:07,032
I hope a moment!
What are you doing?

572
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:10,751
I can not endanger you, Sharon.
At least that I can do for Bernie.

573
01:06:10,852 --> 01:06:13,292
- Thanks for your help.
- Thank you for my help?

574
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,524
Open the door!

575
01:06:18,339 --> 01:06:21,088
Damn idiot!
Taxi!

576
01:07:24,895 --> 01:07:26,320
Hello?

577
01:07:30,493 --> 01:07:31,892
Hello!

578
01:07:36,899 --> 01:07:38,195
Do you speak English?

579
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:45,099
I was wondering if you know anything
of people-

580
01:07:53,938 --> 01:07:58,654
The bottom was in ruins
when my parents bought the house.

581
01:07:58,995 --> 01:08:01,158
As destroyed by
an explosion.

582
01:08:01,608 --> 01:08:04,143
They found some objects
in the rubble...

583
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,736
Surely have belonged...
people who are looking.

584
01:08:08,013 --> 01:08:10,147
Who knows why
my mother kept them.

585
01:08:10,528 --> 01:08:13,259
Perhaps we have found
response.

586
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,162
- Look!
- What is that?

587
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:16,978
It is a micro-recorder.

588
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:20,508
I had one of these
as a child.

589
01:08:20,876 --> 01:08:24,439
Ask if there is someone out here
to fix these things.

590
01:08:27,057 --> 01:08:31,323
I had not seen anything like this
for twenty years.

591
01:08:44,617 --> 01:08:47,520
<i>- Why invade my home?
- Fire </ i></i>

592
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,365
<i>child. </ i></i>

593
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:03,322
Can you put it back?

594
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,144
Of course, sir.

595
01:09:17,724 --> 01:09:20,805
I guess it would not do
anything look in the directory.

596
01:09:20,983 --> 01:09:23,443
No. I do not think
you any good.

597
01:09:24,254 --> 01:09:27,031
Why not put an ad
in the classifieds?

598
01:09:27,491 --> 01:09:32,552
Super hero out of time looking for child
prodigy millionaire, with one hand...

599
01:09:32,703 --> 01:09:34,962
And a face completely...
rebuilt.

600
01:09:35,063 --> 01:09:37,574
- Discretion assured.
- Well, that's enough.

601
01:09:37,753 --> 01:09:41,810
I'm sorry I left. What do you
to do? What do you shoot me?

602
01:10:07,705 --> 01:10:09,783
- Steve!
- On the floor!

603
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:22,805
Come on, Sharon, quickly.

604
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,625
Run.

605
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,090
Run!

606
01:10:35,246 --> 01:10:36,691
Get off!

607
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,292
This sucks!

608
01:11:43,558 --> 01:11:44,823
Steve!

609
01:11:57,929 --> 01:12:00,111
What do you want?
Are you crazy?

610
01:12:05,518 --> 01:12:07,112
What are you doing?

611
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:09,643
Hold on, Sharon.
This bike has no brakes.

612
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:51,378
By God, he found it!
I was so angry...

613
01:12:51,526 --> 01:12:53,893
I thought this wallet...
was totally history.

614
01:13:20,372 --> 01:13:22,774
Hey, I told you we lost
completely!

615
01:13:22,929 --> 01:13:24,000
I'm not so sure.

616
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:26,363
Sure seeking
wrecks.

617
01:13:27,057 --> 01:13:29,183
Want to stop being
so paranoid?

618
01:13:40,142 --> 01:13:41,386
Watch!

619
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:51,348
- That's him.
- San Lorenzo, San Lorenzo Isla...

620
01:13:52,751 --> 01:13:56,056
San Lorenzo Island is
Below 80 km along the coast.

621
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:59,154
Since we are close,
What if we visit?

622
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,315
I always wanted to know
the President.

623
01:14:14,527 --> 01:14:16,123
Valentina...

624
01:14:46,561 --> 01:14:49,522
Sharon, when we reach the castle
Red Skull, want you to stay...

625
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,810
Hidden and let me...
do my job.

626
01:14:51,911 --> 01:14:55,305
- We have the worst of luck!
- Hold on tight!

627
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,905
Shit, still looking for us.

628
01:15:29,987 --> 01:15:32,274
You'll have much better
opportunity if you are alone.

629
01:15:47,722 --> 01:15:50,172
Hey!
Sharon!

630
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,941
I give you some advice, friend.

631
01:16:42,313 --> 01:16:44,328
All this tension,
so long...

632
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:46,549
...Is very, very bad.

633
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:50,977
If you're not careful you'll end
with a terrible wrinkles...

634
01:16:51,923 --> 01:16:54,656
...Here and here...

635
01:16:57,522 --> 01:17:00,956
...And here, like your mom.

636
01:17:29,849 --> 01:17:31,327
<i>What's this? </ i></i>

637
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:35,921
<i>- Why invade my home?
- Fire </ i></i>

638
01:17:43,214 --> 01:17:46,717
The pressure is normal, blood
White down 30%...

639
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:48,260
...And have to reach 70%.

640
01:17:48,361 --> 01:17:49,414
Make it simple!

641
01:17:50,191 --> 01:17:52,899
Are you saying that even
we can not do the implant.

642
01:17:53,508 --> 01:17:56,190
You can guarantee that you can
do if blood pressure...

643
01:17:56,387 --> 01:17:59,069
- ... Decreases few points.
- And when would that be?

644
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:02,496
To be completely sure
say...? Twenty minutes?

645
01:18:17,164 --> 01:18:19,243
What is this
pistol, De Santis?

646
01:18:19,344 --> 01:18:23,019
What, this? This is not a gun.
It is a surgical tool...

647
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,038
Made specifically...
for you.

648
01:18:29,265 --> 01:18:31,536
There is so much tragedy, Tom.

649
01:18:31,537 --> 01:18:36,304
Do not you understand that your people will
happier with their new president?

650
01:18:37,403 --> 01:18:40,376
See you in twenty minutes.

651
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,405
Follow telling the story
it made, please.

652
01:19:11,506 --> 01:19:15,311
We can establish a complicity
between the Soviets and kidnapping.

653
01:19:16,129 --> 01:19:18,834
- It's too obvious.
- We always worked before.

654
01:19:20,232 --> 01:19:22,698
- Why not?
- Sure! Yes!

655
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:24,810
Not long now, General.

656
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,583
This time I will not fail.

657
01:19:55,035 --> 01:19:56,631
Fifteen minutes.

658
01:20:06,015 --> 01:20:07,791
It will not work.

659
01:20:21,212 --> 01:20:22,945
Sharon!

660
01:20:23,046 --> 01:20:24,177
Damn!

661
01:20:39,885 --> 01:20:41,908
Spread out and find him!

662
01:21:14,722 --> 01:21:18,497
Please return,
Mr. President.

663
01:21:19,448 --> 01:21:21,322
It's over.

664
01:21:22,505 --> 01:21:26,423
- I need to get your plan, right?
- Of course.

665
01:21:27,158 --> 01:21:28,691
Then do not make it.

666
01:21:34,532 --> 01:21:36,466
No!

667
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:54,392
- Thanks!
- You're welcome, sir.

668
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:57,047
I'm Steve Rogers.

669
01:21:58,006 --> 01:21:59,559
We've met!

670
01:22:00,009 --> 01:22:01,414
I think not possible.

671
01:22:06,352 --> 01:22:09,043
It means... Do you was
the little boy?

672
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,713
I was waiting for this moment
for long.

673
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:14,214
It's incredible!

674
01:22:16,335 --> 01:22:17,706
We have to keep moving,
Mr. President.

675
01:22:17,707 --> 01:22:18,707
Si.

676
01:22:33,522 --> 01:22:35,715
Sam told me that
come days like these.

677
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:41,211
Sam wanted to give you this.

678
01:22:44,849 --> 01:22:47,994
It was the last thing I said
before dying.

679
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:50,234
They killed him.

680
01:22:57,989 --> 01:23:00,596
- They Sharon.
- I know.

681
01:23:00,626 --> 01:23:01,897
Wait for me north
the coast...

682
01:23:01,908 --> 01:23:04,469
There are some caves... on a cliff
where you can hide.

683
01:23:04,486 --> 01:23:06,211
I'll get you when
her out of here.

684
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:09,734
Are you kidding? I'm not
leaving only Captain America.

685
01:23:10,035 --> 01:23:11,464
Come on!

686
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:45,166
Excuse me, sir.

687
01:23:52,641 --> 01:23:54,164
Ask for help!

688
01:24:01,154 --> 01:24:02,675
With the base of Three!

689
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:05,766
I am the President!
Get me Commander!

690
01:24:06,477 --> 01:24:08,709
Yeah, I know, me neither
believe it.

691
01:24:18,307 --> 01:24:19,938
Mr. President!

692
01:24:20,975 --> 01:24:25,702
- I'm in charge of the rescue here-
- General Fleming...

693
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:28,705
Not think I can...
alright this.

694
01:24:30,142 --> 01:24:31,459
Do you believe?

695
01:24:52,985 --> 01:24:56,326
No how
you're here...

696
01:24:56,517 --> 01:25:00,943
...Or how you're still young.
But no matter, my brother!

697
01:25:01,536 --> 01:25:04,737
Today you will die.

698
01:25:04,938 --> 01:25:10,333
50 years ago you were the ridiculous
Dr. Vaselli idea!

699
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:16,623
You're still a symbol
ridiculous that no one cares.

700
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:18,775
I care.

701
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,494
You care.

702
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:24,837
Then come to me,
my brother.

703
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:30,987
Let's see if this heart of yours
is stronger than my hate.

704
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:42,179
You're still a poor
wimpy, little brother.

705
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:45,046
Stop calling
your brother!

706
01:27:27,547 --> 01:27:28,816
Steve!

707
01:27:45,232 --> 01:27:46,845
Mr. President!

708
01:27:47,287 --> 01:27:48,854
Thank you!

709
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:23,078
You were this close
when you killed my mother?

710
01:28:23,251 --> 01:28:24,561
Closer.

711
01:28:24,562 --> 01:28:30,022
No, that was very fast.
To you rather see you suffer slowly.

712
01:28:55,262 --> 01:28:57,012
That was a submachine gun.

713
01:28:58,489 --> 01:29:00,653
This is a detonator!

714
01:29:01,644 --> 01:29:04,675
Did you really think you were going
to capture me alive?

715
01:29:05,981 --> 01:29:12,368
In regard to megatones, this
device does not have the same scope...

716
01:29:16,123 --> 01:29:18,243
But enough...
to ensure...

717
01:29:18,996 --> 01:29:21,758
Throughout South... Europe will
destroyed and uninhabitable by...

718
01:29:22,035 --> 01:29:24,330
Say a century...

719
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:26,836
Perhaps one or two
decades.

720
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:36,872
Seventy million lives snuffed
like the fire of a candle.

721
01:29:38,563 --> 01:29:41,973
And Captain America can not
do anything about it.

722
01:29:50,895 --> 01:29:52,289
Dad!

723
01:30:35,468 --> 01:30:38,663
Do not get up!
Whatever happens!

724
01:30:41,046 --> 01:30:44,827
- Twelve, nine
- De Santis!

725
01:31:19,313 --> 01:31:21,477
Just a second.

726
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:42,841
De Santis!

727
01:31:48,762 --> 01:31:52,015
The two are
a tragedy.

728
01:31:53,298 --> 01:31:57,741
And now send our
tortured souls to rest.

729
01:31:57,842 --> 01:31:59,452
Speak for yourself!

730
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:13,905
Watch your back!

731
01:33:05,775 --> 01:33:10,443
<i>Today in Rome, 116 nations agreed
environmental protection treaty.</i>

732
01:33:11,029 --> 01:33:13,651
<i>In a brief statement after
the agreement, President Kimball...</i>

733
01:33:13,752 --> 01:33:17,242
<i>...asked to recall all
people who sacrificed everything...</i>

734
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:19,801
<i>...to make our world
a better place to live.</i>

735
01:33:20,145 --> 01:33:23,305
<i>The President closed his statement
with this strange message...</i>

736
01:33:23,635 --> 01:33:26,143
<i>...When Captain America, where
ever you are...</i>

737
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,275
<i>...all stand back
in the struggle.</i>
