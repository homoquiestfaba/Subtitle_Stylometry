1
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:47,533
Greetings, Princess Dyanna.

2
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:50,200
I hope you had a safe journey.

3
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I am Cassia,

4
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,241
the liaison for your visit.

5
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,075
The Princess is not
used to travelling

6
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,867
in such stormy conditions.

7
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,325
My apologies.

8
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:01,117
This is our off season.

9
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:03,658
But the storms
will not interfere

10
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,075
in your vacation here
at Pleasure Station.

11
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,241
Of that I can assure you both.

12
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:09,909
Tara's my bodyguard,

13
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:11,575
not my companion.

14
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:13,200
I see.

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,159
Well, we have many activities

16
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,575
to keep your
"body guard" occupied,

17
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:22,950
while you may entertain
yourself privately.

18
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,783
That won't be necessary.

19
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:27,159
I would just like to make sure
you know who the client is.

20
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,408
Of course, Princess.

21
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:31,783
Welcome to Pleasure Station,

22
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,700
where your every fantasy
becomes real.

23
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,408
Doesn't look very inviting.

24
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:39,241
This is merely our greeting bay.

25
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,241
I assure you
the rest of the station

26
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,408
will be much more
to your liking.

27
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:45,491
The Princess has
very specific needs.

28
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,117
We called ahead.

29
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:50,783
I understand the Princesses
desires completely.

30
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:54,159
All preparations have been
made as requested.

31
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,700
And if I can personally

32
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,200
be of any assistance,

33
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,658
please don't hesitate
to call upon me.

34
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:05,491
That won't be necessary.

35
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:08,325
I will attend to
any of the Princesses needs.

36
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:10,325
Tara, I can speak for myself.

37
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:11,950
Of course, Princess.

38
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,117
It's your security
I'm most concerned for.

39
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:17,491
I understand, but please know,

40
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:19,450
the Pleasure Station has one of

41
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,450
the largest security forces
in the sector.

42
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,408
You have
absolutely nothing to fear.

43
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:27,075
Thank you, Cassia.

44
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:29,075
Tara is paid to worry about me.

45
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,075
Now, I'd like to
get on with my vacation.

46
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,658
Time here is short.

47
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:34,617
As you wish, Princess.

48
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:37,450
Please follow me.

49
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,491
Oh, and I hope you

50
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:43,825
didn't bring a swim suit.

51
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:50,117
There's something
about her that I don't like.

52
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:52,075
How do we know
we can trust her?

53
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:54,283
Tara, you're always
so suspicious.

54
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:56,325
She's just an employee.

55
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:58,700
Every time an attractive woman
comes around,

56
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,700
out come your claws.

57
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,700
It's not that, your highness.

58
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,825
It's just...

59
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,825
There's something
about her.

60
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:08,783
I feel like
I've seen her before.

61
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,241
I'd like to see more of her.

62
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,867
But for now,
put your suspicions aside

63
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,867
and let me enjoy myself.

64
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:17,867
Of course, Princess.

65
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:19,533
I hear the pleasure droids

66
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,658
of Exter are
like none other.

67
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:23,075
Let's find out.

68
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,533
Master.

69
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:50,783
Is everything ready as planned?

70
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:53,408
Yes, Aria, standing by.

71
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:55,658
And the Princess is here?

72
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:57,450
She is.

73
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,200
Our intelligence was correct.

74
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,867
And is she alone?

75
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,700
No, master,

76
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,075
she has one body guard with her.

77
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,700
Only one?

78
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,366
How foolish.

79
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:11,034
Where is she now?

80
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:13,200
She is in the Venusian grotto,

81
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,742
being "entertained"

82
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:17,742
by a pleasure droid.

83
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,575
Hmm, excellent.

84
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:23,825
My fleet is standing by
and prepared to attack.

85
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:26,241
Soon we will control this station

86
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:28,241
and create a new outpost

87
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,700
for my Recusa star system.

88
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,034
And the Princess?

89
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:35,450
Once she becomes our prisoner

90
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,700
no one will dare
retaliate against us.

91
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,533
She is the jewel

92
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,742
in the crown of hostages.

93
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,742
With her in our pocket,

94
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:47,117
all resistance will cease.

95
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:49,283
Without her...

96
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,783
Our planet will be destroyed
by the Federation.

97
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:55,241
That won't happen.

98
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,075
You'll see to that,

99
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:58,617
won't you?

100
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:06,950
Your desire is my command.

101
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,491
Start the attack!

102
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:11,325
Commence attack
on Pleasure Station.

103
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,909
Crush all opposition.

104
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,325
Now, bring me the Princess.

105
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:28,241
Soon this rotten little asteroid

106
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:31,742
will be all mine!

107
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:35,283
Your masseuse awaits you,
Princess.

108
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:38,575
Good.

109
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,034
I hope she has strong hands.

110
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,617
I could use one after that.

111
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:45,867
What's that?

112
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,783
Smoke detector?

113
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:55,159
We're under siege,
your Highness.

114
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,450
Why would anyone attack
the Pleasure Station?

115
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,366
I think it's a plot
to kidnap you.

116
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,491
Kidnap me?

117
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:04,533
Aria of Electros has always
been a rebel traitor.

118
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,325
I'm sure she's behind this.

119
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:14,992
Aria? Just my luck.

120
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:17,450
Caught in an alien whore house
with my pants down.

121
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,034
We've got to get out of here.

122
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:21,034
Come on, let's try
the loading dock.

123
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:22,867
Maybe we can hijack
an escape shuttle.

124
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,700
Okay.

125
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:36,159
These space pimps are no match
for my skilled pilots.

126
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,408
This won't last long.

127
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:44,742
Hurry, we don't have much time!

128
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:46,575
But do you think this thing

129
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:48,075
will actually fly?

130
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:50,075
There's only one way
to find out.

131
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:52,366
But do you really
know how to fly this thing?

132
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:54,366
Does it really matter
at this point?

133
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:57,200
All right, here we go.

134
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:02,700
Fingers crossed.
We got incoming.

135
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,992
Well, at least if it's
my time to perish,

136
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:10,825
I died after being licked senseless
by an android hooker.

137
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:12,575
Don't talk like that.

138
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,034
We're not gonna die...
I hope.

139
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:22,366
There's one coming right at us.

140
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:25,117
Oh, no... ah.

141
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,408
We've got one left behind us.

142
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,283
I don't think I can shake him.

143
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:42,117
Hey, pal, tailgating is illegal
in this quadrant.

144
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,783
Good job, Princess.

145
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,075
But we're headed straight
towards that asteroid belt.

146
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:54,992
It's our only chance.

147
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,450
Do you think we can out
maneuver them without killing us?

148
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,283
Are you crazy?
I don't know how to fly this thing.

149
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:02,283
Then let's just close our eyes.

150
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,783
We've slowed down.

151
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:22,159
Does that mean we've entered
a friendly solar system

152
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,159
where we'll we welcomed
and meet new friends

153
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,159
who will protect us
from Aria's evil plans to kidnap me?

154
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,783
Um, no.

155
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:30,617
It means
the engine's on fire.

156
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:32,617
Damn it! Now what?

157
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:34,450
We only have one choice.

158
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,325
We have to
jettison ourselves

159
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:37,992
off of this ship

160
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,366
and take our chances.

161
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,366
Chances, but where?

162
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:43,491
There's a planet,
straight ahead.

163
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:52,491
Where is she?

164
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,325
I don't know.

165
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:56,825
They must have found
a way to escape.

166
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:58,491
How is that possible?

167
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,950
We have the place surrounded.

168
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,658
Perhaps they stole
one of the escape shuttles.

169
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:07,491
Eluding my trained fighters?

170
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,825
I don't believe it.

171
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,825
I'm afraid it's true, Aria.

172
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:14,992
We've had reports of
one small ship slipping through.

173
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:16,992
It must be them.

174
00:15:16,992 --> 00:15:18,783
Do you know what this means?

175
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,700
That I won't be vacationing
in Qualitron next week.

176
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,533
When they find out we don't have
the Princess held hostage,

177
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:30,241
our asses won't
be worth a plug nickel.

178
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:33,034
What do we do?

179
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:36,658
You've got to find her
and bring her to me.

180
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:40,325
In the meantime, I'll pretend
as if we really do have her.

181
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:43,325
That should stall off
a counter attack for now.

182
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,366
But you need to hurry.

183
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:47,533
I can't get busted again.

184
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,867
I'm on my third strike.

185
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:53,867
I'll do my best, master.

186
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:57,700
All royal family members have
an implanted tracking chip in them.

187
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,075
Use that and
it'll lead you right to her.

188
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:23,909
Isn't this amazing?
Just look at it.

189
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:25,742
Let me guess.

190
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:27,241
45 hundred new numbers

191
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:28,742
you've never seen before.

192
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:30,992
Better than that, 48 hundred.

193
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,617
Every day I send dozens of
messages out into space.

194
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,075
Every day, I wait for
someone to answer back.

195
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:39,075
Collect call from Uranus
on line two.

196
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:41,909
You're killing me, Jake.

197
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,867
I know to you
this is all trivial.

198
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,617
But to me this is important.

199
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:47,617
I know something is gonna happen,
something big.

200
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:52,117
I haven't seen anything big
from you in days.

201
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:54,950
Suzi, I'll make time
for you this weekend.

202
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,408
But right now,
I've gotta wait to see if someone in

203
00:16:57,408 --> 00:17:00,117
the outer reaches of space
wants to instant message me.

204
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:03,575
Trust me, babe,
E.T. is not phoning home.

205
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:07,283
If you're bored, why don't you
just go home, call it a day?

206
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:09,283
It's not that I'm bored, Jake.

207
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:12,617
The only time I get to see you
is when I hang out here.

208
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,117
That's not true.

209
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,617
We do live together.

210
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,450
No we don't.

211
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,909
I live in a big house
with a big comfy bed.

212
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:22,950
And you live... here,

213
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,700
in UFO central.

214
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,575
The search for extraterrestrial life
is a thankless one,

215
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,450
but it's my job.

216
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,325
To look for UFO's
where there are none?

217
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,325
I wish you could see
how important this is.

218
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:37,159
If I were to actually
make contact

219
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:39,992
with an honest to god UFO,
I'd be famous.

220
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,658
I could write my own ticket to

221
00:17:41,658 --> 00:17:44,159
the top of the scientific slog heap.

222
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:46,159
I know, I know,
it's just you spend

223
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,825
so much time studying
the heavenly bodies.

224
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:50,658
What about me?

225
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:52,617
What about this body?

226
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:54,241
You know I can't concentrate

227
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,867
when you do that.

228
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:59,366
Well...

229
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:01,825
how about now?

230
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,825
Is this better?

231
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:05,909
Suzi...

232
00:18:07,408 --> 00:18:09,617
Come on, baby.

233
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:11,617
I want your rocket,

234
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:14,491
and I want it to
blast off right now.

235
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
You know, sometimes,

236
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,742
you can be very persuasive.

237
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:23,950
I want you to produce
a real UFO,

238
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,992
an unbelievable fucking orgasm.

239
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:31,200
I think I see one
coming right now.

240
00:24:22,617 --> 00:24:24,617
What's that?

241
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:27,159
It's probably the microwave,
come on.

242
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,159
That's the atmospheric
disturbance meter.

243
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,200
Something's causing a ripple
in the upper stratosphere.

244
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,200
You don't think...

245
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:40,617
Uh, it could be.

246
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:42,241
It looks like

247
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:44,909
something's trying to
break into our orbit.

248
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:47,700
A UFO? Please!

249
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,575
Maybe, I have
the server co-ordinates.

250
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:52,575
You do that.

251
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,575
I'm stepping outside.

252
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:57,742
Suzi, you smoke after sex?

253
00:24:57,742 --> 00:25:00,200
I don't know.
I never looked.

254
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:10,491
We must transport
to the surface.

255
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:12,950
But we must do it quickly.
Hold me tight.

256
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,325
Not now, Tara.
Can't we do that later.

257
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:18,325
No, hold me tight, so we can
transport together, quickly!

258
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:20,325
Oh, right.
Okay, I'm ready.

259
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:41,241
Holy shit!

260
00:25:51,325 --> 00:25:53,325
Well, that could
have been worse.

261
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:55,950
If only I knew where we were.

262
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,533
What a strange place this is.

263
00:26:00,117 --> 00:26:01,658
Look!

264
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:05,491
Well, that's just great.

265
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:08,533
There goes our wheels.

266
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,700
Suggestions?

267
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,325
We need to find food and shelter,

268
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,366
and a place to pee.

269
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:19,658
Do you have a device that
will help us do such a thing?

270
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:21,658
Yes, your highness.

271
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:28,034
Heads.

272
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:29,867
This way.

273
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:38,491
Jake, I saw it, I saw it!

274
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:39,867
Saw what?

275
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,700
The UFO, or whatever it is.

276
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,617
Where?

277
00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:45,867
It was falling from the sky,
and it was on fire,

278
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:47,992
and it blew up
when it hit the hills.

279
00:26:47,992 --> 00:26:49,408
Blew up?

280
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,241
Yeah, ka-pow!

281
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:53,658
Nothing, nothing but smoke.

282
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:56,491
I'm pretty sure
all you saw was a meteorite.

283
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,034
It happens all the time.

284
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,325
But in broad daylight?

285
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:02,283
Well, that's unlikely,

286
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:04,575
but it's probably all is was.

287
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:06,450
Too bad.

288
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,491
I was really hoping for more.

289
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:11,241
Jake, this was no shooting star.

290
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:14,408
You're right, let's go home.

291
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:16,283
I can't any more of this today.

292
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:20,283
Okay, but don't give up, babe.

293
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:22,283
The truth is out there.

294
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:24,117
Thank you.

295
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:53,450
You can run through
a million star systems,

296
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,450
but you can't hid from me,
little Princess.

297
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,117
Cassia to Master Aria, come in.

298
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,575
I've located the Princess
on the third planet

299
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:09,950
in the star of Braxis.

300
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,950
Come in. Aria?

301
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,241
Hello?

302
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,950
What is she doing?

303
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,408
Look, Princess.

304
00:35:21,408 --> 00:35:22,867
Praise Targas!

305
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,867
Perhaps we can
take shelter there.

306
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:26,867
It's a primitive construction.

307
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:28,909
Not much curb appeal,

308
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,408
but we're in no position

309
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:31,950
to be choosy.

310
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,159
It will allow us
to regroup our thoughts

311
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,034
and plan our next move.

312
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,617
But what if
we encounter an alien race?

313
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:41,075
Let me do the talking.

314
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:43,700
Got it.

315
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,075
Time to put this baby
on auto pilot

316
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:10,325
and do a little hooter hunting.

317
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:14,117
Auto pilot activated.

318
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,450
What place is this?

319
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,075
It looks like
a food storage facility.

320
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,366
A kitchen?

321
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:51,034
Yes, are you hungry?

322
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:52,867
I could eat a mahar.

323
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,325
Hmm... what is this?

324
00:36:57,325 --> 00:37:00,325
It looks like my cousin.

325
00:37:00,325 --> 00:37:03,783
Ah, look Princess.

326
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:07,117
Good work, Tara. Let's eat.

327
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:13,825
Agent Daniels, come on in.

328
00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:15,658
You asked to see me, sir?

329
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:17,992
Yeah, take a seat there.

330
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:29,325
What can you tell me about
the UFO tracking station

331
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:31,450
at Santa Mira Springs?

332
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,867
Well, to be honest, not much.

333
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:35,867
It's been pretty hush-hush.

334
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,867
Sparsely maintained.

335
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:40,533
No tangible results from
the center have been reported,

336
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:42,992
at least,
none that I'm aware of.

337
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:45,075
Until now.

338
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:47,366
Until now?

339
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:50,366
Intell has it that something big

340
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:52,575
came out of the sky there,

341
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:55,200
and crashed, today.

342
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,825
The problem is, I haven't heard

343
00:37:57,825 --> 00:38:00,034
anything from the center.

344
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:02,034
That's strange.

345
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:04,533
Do you have any idea
what it was?

346
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,034
Not at all.

347
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:10,450
But there's also reports
that something strange

348
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,909
entered our orbit within
a half hour of the crash.

349
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:18,117
Something totally unexplained.

350
00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:20,034
And you'd like me
to go check it out.

351
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:22,867
Right, I've been trying to
get a hold of Jake Johnson.

352
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,825
He's the scientist who runs
the center up there,

353
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:27,825
but no luck so far.

354
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:29,241
Now, I don't know.

355
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:31,909
Maybe he didn't come in today.

356
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,658
Maybe he took the afternoon off
and went home.

357
00:38:34,658 --> 00:38:36,241
I just don't know.

358
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:37,783
Got it.

359
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,783
I'll go visit the center.

360
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:41,533
Negative, agent.
I want you to go

361
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:43,034
straight out to his house.

362
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,575
He's very isolated.

363
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:46,200
There's no cell phone.

364
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,159
There's no computer, nothing.

365
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,575
But I think he's our best hope.

366
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:52,575
If he's out there, sir,

367
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:55,075
I'll find him.

368
00:38:55,075 --> 00:38:57,992
And, Daniels,
if you do find him,

369
00:38:57,992 --> 00:38:59,992
and he knows something,

370
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:02,783
I'm depending on you
to keep it zipped.

371
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:05,825
You can count on me, sir.

372
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:07,783
Good.

373
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:10,783
What?

374
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,117
Why's the door open?

375
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,491
I don't know.

376
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,783
Do you smell that?

377
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:35,783
Yeah, did you leave
the oven on again?

378
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:37,825
Of course not.

379
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,825
What the hell is going on here?

380
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:58,159
Greetings, Earthlings. How?

381
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,117
How?

382
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:02,783
Earthlings? I think maybe
you better start explaining.

383
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,075
Well, we got lost...

384
00:40:05,075 --> 00:40:07,117
Lost, just completely lost.

385
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:09,117
And we came upon
your construction.

386
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:10,491
Beautiful place.

387
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,159
Really nice.

388
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,783
And no one was here.

389
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:15,366
Not a soul.

390
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:18,783
So we thought,
maybe you wouldn't mind?

391
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,450
Is it okay?

392
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,700
We can leave.
It's not a problem.

393
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,325
I'm just so confused.

394
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:25,909
Your clothes?

395
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:27,867
Everything is just so strange.

396
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:29,867
Are you guys from Centerville?

397
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:31,533
I got dressed in a hurry.

398
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:33,075
I was being kidnapped.

399
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:34,575
Kidnapped?

400
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:36,783
Yes, you are addressing
Her Royal Highness,

401
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:38,617
Princess Dyanna of Alton Four.

402
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:40,034
And I am her

403
00:40:40,034 --> 00:40:41,366
body guard, Tara.

404
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:43,283
You're kidding me, right?

405
00:40:43,283 --> 00:40:44,742
I don't kid.

406
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,742
Suzi, do you think it could be?

407
00:40:54,742 --> 00:40:57,034
Oh, that thing that
crashed in the hills.

408
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:58,742
No, this is fantastic.

409
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:00,617
This is what
I've always dreamed about.

410
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:02,450
I can't believe it.

411
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,408
I mean,
they do look pretty fantastic.

412
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:05,783
All right.

413
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:07,117
Oh, my God.

414
00:41:07,117 --> 00:41:10,950
Okay, ladies,
please finish your meal

415
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,117
and we can have
a little chat... please.

416
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:21,617
Suzi, do you know
what this means?

417
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:24,034
That two big-tittied twits
cleaned out our kitchen

418
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:26,241
and now we have to go
grocery shopping.

419
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:28,241
No, I mean, what if they

420
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:30,241
really did come
on a space ship

421
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,241
here from another galaxy?

422
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:35,075
You really think either one of
those two has the intelligence

423
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,075
to find their way out of
a K-Mart parking lot?

424
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:38,909
Stranger things have happened.

425
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:40,325
Name one.

426
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:41,950
All right, let me start again.

427
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,825
What if they're
telling the truth?

428
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:46,034
Maybe they did escape
from outer space.

429
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:49,034
They look like they escaped
from a Frederick's Catalogue.

430
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:51,075
Either way, it's not bad.

431
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,075
There's only one way
I can prove it.

432
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:54,658
I need to test their clothes.

433
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:56,283
I'll bet they're made of fabric

434
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:57,909
that's not of this Earth.

435
00:41:57,909 --> 00:41:59,950
How are we supposed
to get their clothes?

436
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,325
You're a girl.
Think of something.

437
00:42:03,325 --> 00:42:05,325
What...?

438
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:08,909
This is our room.

439
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:10,783
You can change in here.

440
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:14,200
So, please explain to me again
why you guys want my clothes.

441
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,617
Well, if you really are
from another solar system,

442
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,408
the fabric of the clothes
will prove it's alien composition.

443
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:21,450
I have to study it,
run some tests.

444
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,117
All right, if it proves

445
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:24,867
that we're telling the truth.

446
00:42:24,867 --> 00:42:26,366
You could borrow some of

447
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:27,867
my stuff while he runs tests.

448
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,867
I'll let you ladies
sort things out.

449
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:31,867
Take your time.

450
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:39,325
Do you need some help?

451
00:42:39,325 --> 00:42:41,450
Yeah.

452
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:52,700
Your hands are so soft.

453
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,950
You're really beautiful.

454
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,742
You think so?

455
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,533
Not many people
see me like this.

456
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:03,366
I'm the royal body guard

457
00:43:03,366 --> 00:43:07,200
and I'm not allowed to
indulge in such things.

458
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:13,700
Nobody's ever touched you
like this before?

459
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,366
No, but I've seen it
many times.

460
00:43:17,366 --> 00:43:20,159
Maybe we should

461
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,200
do a little experiment
of our own.

462
00:43:29,117 --> 00:43:31,159
Okay.

463
00:50:01,491 --> 00:50:04,366
MIB headquarters,
this is Agent Daniels.

464
00:50:04,366 --> 00:50:06,366
Paging for General Randall.

465
00:50:06,366 --> 00:50:08,783
Come in. I'm at the location.

466
00:50:08,783 --> 00:50:12,450
MIB headquarters, come in.

467
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,825
Why am I not surprised?

468
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,783
Please,
make yourself comfortable.

469
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:42,783
Thank you.

470
00:50:44,366 --> 00:50:47,200
Whoa!
That's not what I meant.

471
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,700
Hmm...

472
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,950
You're a very mysterious creature.

473
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:53,117
Your intentions confuse me.

474
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:56,117
I've never seen a species
quite like you before.

475
00:50:56,117 --> 00:50:58,283
You mean a man?

476
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:00,159
You've never seen a man before?

477
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:02,825
No, they do not have them
where I come from.

478
00:51:02,825 --> 00:51:05,825
But I think it may be
very important now.

479
00:51:05,825 --> 00:51:07,325
Why is that?

480
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:08,867
Because our ship
has been destroyed.

481
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:10,408
We have no way
of returning home.

482
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:12,159
Good point.

483
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:37,783
We must now learn
to fit into your world,

484
00:51:37,783 --> 00:51:39,783
to become a part of it,

485
00:51:39,783 --> 00:51:43,783
to do as you do,
to feel as you feel,

486
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:47,533
to love as you love.

487
00:51:47,533 --> 00:51:49,992
I'm sure you'll be able
to fit in quickly.

488
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:52,366
You've just got to learn how
to live in a world full of men.

489
00:51:52,366 --> 00:51:55,366
Of course,
and you will teach me, yes?

490
00:51:55,366 --> 00:51:57,200
Yes.

491
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,034
I mean, no!

492
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:00,867
You're a Princess, aren't you?

493
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,700
I'm just your
every day UFO hunter.

494
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,700
Besides,
Suzi's right down the hall.

495
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,533
She majored
in castration in college.

496
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:09,575
Don't worry about Suzi.

497
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:11,366
Tara can handle her.

498
00:52:11,366 --> 00:52:12,992
But now I would like to know

499
00:52:12,992 --> 00:52:15,783
what men do for their mates
here on Earth.

500
00:52:15,783 --> 00:52:19,241
Well, for the sake
of scientific research.

501
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:49,241
MIB headquarters, come in.
This is Agent Daniels.

502
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,034
Paging for General Randall.

503
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:52,867
MIB headquarters, come in.

504
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,450
Cease communications, Earthling.

505
00:56:57,325 --> 00:57:01,325
Drop it.

506
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:03,742
Hold on a second, beautiful.

507
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:06,783
Okay, I'm sure
we can talk about this.

508
00:57:06,783 --> 00:57:09,075
Who are you communicating with?

509
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:11,075
My boss.

510
00:57:11,075 --> 00:57:13,700
I was just checking in.

511
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,700
You know,
they get worried about me

512
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,366
down at headquarters
if they don't hear from me.

513
00:57:18,366 --> 00:57:21,408
Sounds like you've got
a lot to be worried about.

514
00:57:21,408 --> 00:57:23,617
Wait a minute.

515
00:57:23,617 --> 00:57:26,825
One more step,
and I'll vaporize you,

516
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:30,034
Phew, well, we won't
want that now, would we?

517
00:57:30,034 --> 00:57:32,075
You wouldn't.

518
00:57:32,075 --> 00:57:34,075
Look, it's pretty obvious you're

519
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,075
one of those alien things, okay?

520
00:57:37,075 --> 00:57:39,867
But you need me.
I can help.

521
00:57:39,867 --> 00:57:43,366
I don't know what kind
of creature you are,

522
00:57:43,366 --> 00:57:46,909
but I'm certain that there's
nothing you could do for me.

523
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:48,533
Don't be so sure.

524
00:57:51,408 --> 00:57:53,783
I saw the Princess

525
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:56,575
engaging in some
physical contact with

526
00:57:56,575 --> 00:57:59,408
the other of your kind.

527
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:02,408
What was it?

528
00:58:02,408 --> 00:58:04,825
Oh, that.

529
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:08,742
Yeah, let's just say
he was integrating her

530
00:58:08,742 --> 00:58:12,575
into one of
Earth's oldest customs.

531
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:17,408
It looked very...
interesting.

532
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:19,992
I would like you to show me

533
00:58:19,992 --> 00:58:22,742
this contact.

534
00:58:22,742 --> 00:58:24,992
You want me to show you?

535
00:58:24,992 --> 00:58:26,825
Okay.

536
00:58:26,825 --> 00:58:29,867
But, why don't we start by you

537
00:58:29,867 --> 00:58:31,867
not pointing that thing at me?

538
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:36,617
Okay, but no funny business.

539
00:58:36,617 --> 00:58:39,408
Hey, no funny business.

540
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:50,117
Cassia, this is Aria.

541
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,950
Come in.

542
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:56,366
Cassia,

543
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:58,783
this is Aria.

544
01:03:58,783 --> 01:04:01,783
Answer me!

545
01:04:01,783 --> 01:04:04,783
I hate playing phone tag!

546
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,742
No, I want you to get me
the stainless steel ones.

547
01:04:11,742 --> 01:04:14,117
You know, the ones with
the fur on the inside.

548
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:15,533
Yeah.

549
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:17,575
Look, I'm gonna have to
call you back, okay?

550
01:04:17,575 --> 01:04:19,034
General Randall?

551
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:20,533
Daniels, where the hell
have you been?!

552
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,034
I thought you weren't
coming back.

553
01:04:22,034 --> 01:04:24,450
It's a long, long story, sir.

554
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:25,867
But I have big news.

555
01:04:25,867 --> 01:04:27,200
You were right.

556
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,617
Something did crash

557
01:04:28,617 --> 01:04:29,950
in those hills.

558
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,200
I knew it!

559
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,117
It was an alien space craft.

560
01:04:34,117 --> 01:04:36,491
Now, unfortunately,
the ship's totaled.

561
01:04:36,491 --> 01:04:39,533
But the occupants were
able to bail out in time.

562
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:41,950
Where are they?

563
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:44,742
They're at Jake's house,
just like you suspected.

564
01:04:44,742 --> 01:04:46,742
Two of them, women.

565
01:04:46,742 --> 01:04:48,325
One's a Princess,

566
01:04:48,325 --> 01:04:49,950
and the other's her body guard.

567
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,034
Fantastic!

568
01:04:52,034 --> 01:04:54,159
Are they friendly?

569
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:57,617
Oh, yes, they're very friendly.

570
01:04:57,617 --> 01:04:59,700
But without their spacecraft,

571
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,825
they're stranded here on Earth.

572
01:05:01,825 --> 01:05:04,034
That's an incredible story.

573
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:07,200
Are you sure every word
of this is true, Daniels?

574
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,825
I'm positive.

575
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:11,159
In fact, I brought you proof.

576
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:22,159
This is Cassia.

577
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:24,533
Is she one of them?

578
01:05:24,533 --> 01:05:26,992
Oh, she's one of them.

579
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:28,200
Incredible.

580
01:05:31,867 --> 01:05:34,575
I thought you said
there were two.

581
01:05:34,575 --> 01:05:37,034
Two on the ship that crashed.

582
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:39,658
Cassia was actually
sent here on a mission

583
01:05:39,658 --> 01:05:41,867
to capture the Princess.

584
01:05:41,867 --> 01:05:43,408
Incredible!

585
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,867
But, she's changed her mind.

586
01:05:51,867 --> 01:05:53,700
Haven't you, dear?

587
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,200
Yes, darling.

588
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,575
I never

589
01:05:56,575 --> 01:05:58,117
want to go back.

590
01:05:58,117 --> 01:05:59,700
What changed her mind?

591
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,117
It's, it's actually all
in the report, sir.

592
01:06:03,117 --> 01:06:07,075
Let's just say we found
a common ground.

593
01:06:07,075 --> 01:06:10,450
And ground it
and ground it.

594
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:12,992
She's kind of my girlfriend now.

595
01:06:12,992 --> 01:06:15,200
Yeah, uh...

596
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,783
I can see that.

597
01:06:16,783 --> 01:06:18,075
We better wrap this all up.

598
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:19,867
We better bet them to D.C.

599
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:21,825
The President's gonna want to
know about this right away.

600
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:23,450
Yes, sir.

601
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:25,450
Come on, babe.

602
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:35,533
On the deck?

603
01:06:44,325 --> 01:06:46,742
Jake, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

604
01:06:46,742 --> 01:06:48,617
Suzi.

605
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:50,450
Whoa!

606
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,450
You look different.

607
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,034
Do you like it?

608
01:06:54,034 --> 01:06:57,408
It's very...
ordinary.

609
01:06:57,408 --> 01:07:00,408
Don't worry. You look great.
You're gonna fit right in.

610
01:07:01,491 --> 01:07:03,117
Here you go.

611
01:07:03,117 --> 01:07:04,950
I think you'll
find the make up

612
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:07,658
of the material
to be very...

613
01:07:07,658 --> 01:07:09,491
flexible.

614
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:11,491
Excellent.

615
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:13,241
Did you find anything out

616
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:14,950
new about the Princess?

617
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,491
A few things.

618
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:17,950
Me too.

619
01:07:20,575 --> 01:07:23,575
So, ladies, I'm gonna have to

620
01:07:23,575 --> 01:07:25,658
tell someone about
your situation.

621
01:07:25,658 --> 01:07:27,491
They might be able to help you.

622
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:28,825
That's very kind of you.

623
01:07:28,825 --> 01:07:30,658
I'm pretty certain
that we're being tracked

624
01:07:30,658 --> 01:07:32,450
by an evil hunter
named Cassia.

625
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:34,575
She betrayed me
and tried to kill us.

626
01:07:34,575 --> 01:07:37,450
Then let's go now.

627
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:40,742
No one is going anywhere.

628
01:07:40,742 --> 01:07:43,909
- Damn it!
- Who are you?

629
01:07:43,909 --> 01:07:45,700
Stop where you are!

630
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,325
Sorry, folks,

631
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:50,992
MIB is taking over from here.

632
01:07:50,992 --> 01:07:52,366
What's going on?

633
01:07:52,366 --> 01:07:53,992
We've got orders to bring

634
01:07:53,992 --> 01:07:55,825
these girls into Washington.

635
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:57,825
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

636
01:07:57,825 --> 01:07:59,325
On whose orders?

637
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,366
General Randall's orders.

638
01:08:01,366 --> 01:08:04,658
Oh, why didn't you say so?

639
01:08:04,658 --> 01:08:07,783
Like to take you two in
for some quick questions.

640
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:10,075
Is there somewhere
we can go in private?

641
01:08:10,075 --> 01:08:13,241
Um, down the hall,
first door on the left.

642
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:15,408
Don't worry, girls.

643
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:17,241
He won't hurt you.

644
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:20,200
He's just a man...
in black.

645
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,658
I know what to do with a man.

646
01:08:22,658 --> 01:08:24,366
So do I.

647
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:37,159
Um, maybe I should just go
keep an eye on them.

648
01:14:28,408 --> 01:14:30,783
What's taking everyone so long?

649
01:14:33,867 --> 01:14:35,241
I don't know,

650
01:14:35,241 --> 01:14:38,075
but I expect some answers.

651
01:14:38,075 --> 01:14:41,117
I'll bet you do.

652
01:14:41,117 --> 01:14:42,950
And I'll give to you.

653
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,783
But first,

654
01:14:44,783 --> 01:14:47,742
you ever consider
having a close encounter?

655
01:14:57,408 --> 01:15:00,909
Hey, pal, tailgating is illegal
in this quadrant.

656
01:15:00,909 --> 01:15:03,909
I've never seen a species
quite like you before.

657
01:15:03,909 --> 01:15:05,950
I know what to do with a man.

658
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:11,909
Let me do the talking.

659
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:14,159
Greetings, Earthlings. How?

660
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,075
Come on, let's try
the loading dock.

661
01:15:16,075 --> 01:15:18,075
Maybe we can hijack
an escape shuttle.

662
01:15:20,992 --> 01:15:22,992
Time to put this baby
on auto-pilot

663
01:15:22,992 --> 01:15:25,283
and do a little hooter hunting.

664
01:15:27,575 --> 01:15:31,450
I am Cassia,
the liaison for your visit.

665
01:15:34,533 --> 01:15:36,825
Cassia, this is Aria.

666
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,658
Come in.

667
01:15:38,658 --> 01:15:41,283
Eluding my trained fighters?

668
01:15:41,283 --> 01:15:43,825
I don't believe it.

669
01:15:43,825 --> 01:15:46,075
Is everything ready as planned?

670
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:52,867
I haven't seen anything big
from you in days.

671
01:15:52,867 --> 01:15:55,283
That two big-tittied twits
cleaned out our kitchen

672
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:57,658
and now we have to go
grocery shopping.

673
01:15:57,658 --> 01:15:59,617
Yeah, ka-pow!

674
01:15:59,617 --> 01:16:01,825
Nothing, nothing but smoke.

675
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:06,491
To me this is important.

676
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:08,742
I know something is gonna happen,
something big.

677
01:16:08,742 --> 01:16:12,034
Oh, why didn't you say so?

678
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,034
You mean a man.

679
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:16,034
You've never seen a man before?

680
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:21,825
MIB headquarters,
this is Agent Daniels.

681
01:16:21,825 --> 01:16:23,825
Paging for General Randall.

682
01:16:23,825 --> 01:16:26,366
Yes, they're very friendly.

683
01:16:26,366 --> 01:16:29,034
But you need me.
I can help.

684
01:16:45,783 --> 01:16:49,200
What can you tell me about
the UFO tracking station

685
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,700
at Santa Mira Springs?

686
01:16:53,533 --> 01:16:55,533
On the deck?
