Y'best be enjoying it.

136
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:04,950
Come a fortnight and the

137
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:08,584
to be ever silent
as the tomb.

138
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,117

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,417
Y'ain't.

143
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:25,017
<i>The Chicopee,</i>
a fine-un she were.

144
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:28,284
Clean-built
and trig-lookin'!

145
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:31,984
None more fleet in '64

146
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:34,917
We were on the breaks...

147
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:37,317

148
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:39,451
And why, ask ye? Why?

149
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:45,451
What's the terrible part of
a sailor's life, ask ye, lad?

150
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:48,850
'Tis when the work stops when
ye're twixt wind and water.

151
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,584
Doldrums. Doldrums.

152
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:53,651
Eviler than the Devil.

153
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:55,850
Boredom makes men
to villains,

154
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:58,850
and the water
goes quick, lad, vanished.

155
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:04,817
The only med'cine is drink.

156
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:07,317
Keeps them sailors happy,
keeps 'em agreeable,

157
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:09,217
keeps 'em calm,
keeps 'em...

158
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:10,451
Stupid.

[laughing]

160
00:22:17,017 --> 00:22:20,618
Curse me if there ain't
an old tar spirit

161
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:22,484
somewheres in ye, lad.

162
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,883
[exhales and pours drink]

163
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,150
Out with it, lad.

164
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:36,451
Uh...

165
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:40,317
What, uh... What made
your last keeper leave?

166
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,084
Him? Me second?

167
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:44,251
Mmm-hmm.

168
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,017
Died.

169
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:49,484
Went mad, he did.

170
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:54,150
Ravin' about sirens, merfolk,
bad omens and the like.

171
00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:55,618
In the end,

172
00:22:55,684 --> 00:23:00,251
weren't no more sense left
in him than an hen's tooth.

173
00:23:00,317 --> 00:23:05,551
He believed that there was
some enchantment in the light.

174
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,783
He notioned that St. Elmo

175
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,417
had cast
his very fire into it.

176
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:17,451
Salvation, said he.

177
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:22,783
[scoffs]

178
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:25,917
[chuckles]

179
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:29,484
Tall tales.

180
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:36,984
I seen ye
sparrin' with a gull.

181
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,883
Best leave 'em be.

182
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,251
Bad luck to kill a sea bird.

183
00:23:43,317 --> 00:23:44,551
[scoffs]

184
00:23:44,618 --> 00:23:46,284
More tall tales.

185
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:50,317
Bad luck to kill a sea bird!

186
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:02,251
Pay me no mind, lad.

187
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,084
None.

188
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:07,451
Fix us up some coffee.

189
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,184
Long night ahead.

190
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,351
Drop o'coffee
will do us good.

191
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:18,251
[clock ticking]

192
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:28,517
[wind howling outside]

193
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:41,284
[tapping]

194
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:06,251
[grunts softly]

195
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:09,417
[soft thumping]

196
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:19,084
[grunts]

197
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:23,284
[door creaks]

198
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:35,084
[waves crashing]

199
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,451
- [seagulls squawking]
- [grunting]

200
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:19,150
[blows]

201
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:21,850
You've been neglecting
yer duties, lad!

202
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,417
Don't deny it!

203
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,883
What do you call that?

204
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:32,317
- Sir?
- What?

205
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,718
I... I mopped and swept
twice over, sir.

206
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:36,451
Ye lyin' dog.

207
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:41,883
- I swept 'em.
- 'Tis begrimed and bedabbled.

208
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,950
Unwiped, unwashed,
and distained.

209
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:45,750
[chuckles softly]

210
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:48,117
You git some kinda peart
outta molestin' me?

211
00:26:48,184 --> 00:26:49,351
Come now?

212
00:26:51,017 --> 00:26:52,117
I already said...

213
00:26:52,184 --> 00:26:53,883
How dare ye contradict me,
y'dog.

214
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,284
Now look here,

215
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:57,251
I ain't never intended
to be no housewife

216
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:59,484
nor slave
in takin' this job.

217
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,551
It ain't right!

218
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:03,484
These lodgings is
more ramshackle

219
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:06,384
than any shanty boy's camp
I ever seen.

220
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:08,317
The Queen of England's
own fancy housekeeper

221
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:09,984
couldn't even done no better
than what I done,

222
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,351
'cause I tell you,
I scrubbed

223
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:13,551
this here place
twice over, sir...

224
00:27:13,618 --> 00:27:15,850
And I say y'did nothin'
o'the sort.

225
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,117
And I say,
y'swab it again,

226
00:27:18,184 --> 00:27:19,950
and y'swab it
proper-like this time,

227
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:24,251
and you'll be swabbin' it
10 times more after that.

228
00:27:24,317 --> 00:27:26,883
And if I tells ye
to pull up and apart

229
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,317
every floorboard and clapboard
of this here house

230
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:31,117
and scour 'em down
with yer bare,

231
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:33,351
bleedin' knuckles,
you'll do it!

232
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:36,883
And if I tells ye to yank out
every single nail

233
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,017
from every moulderin'
nail-hole

234
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:41,584
and suck off
every spec of rust

235
00:27:41,651 --> 00:27:46,184
till all them nails sparkle
like a sperm whale's pecker,

236
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:49,317
and then carpenter
the whole light station

237
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:50,750
back together from scrap,

238
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:53,684
and then do it all over again,
you'll do it!

239
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,284
And by God and by Golly,

240
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:57,817
you'll do it smilin', lad,
'cause you'll like it.

241
00:27:57,883 --> 00:28:00,451
You'll like it
'cause I says you will!

242
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:08,050
Contradict me again,
and I'll dock yer wages.

243
00:28:10,017 --> 00:28:11,484
D'ye hear me, lad?

244
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:15,117
Aye, sir.

245
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:17,417
Ah.

246
00:28:18,217 --> 00:28:19,684
Swab, dog.

247
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,117
Swab!

248
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,817
[thunder rumbling]

249
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,883
[thunder rumbles]

250
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:25,917
[foghorn blasting]

251
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:41,651
Keep 'em steady, lad.

252
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:43,217
Aye, sir. [grunts]

253
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:45,817
[Thomas] Whitewash
must be even, lad.

254
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:47,684
Bright! Shinin'!

255
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,950
Like a silver
whorehouse token.

256
00:29:50,017 --> 00:29:51,950
Give them sailors
a proper daymark.

257
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:55,584
[Ephraim] They're not going
to see it in a goddamn storm!

258
00:29:55,651 --> 00:29:57,984
Keep your temper now, lad.

259
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,451
'Tis fine work.

260
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:02,317
And ye're makin' high marks
in me logbook.

261
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,850
Them's gospel!

262
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:07,050
I'll drop y'down
a few feet.

263
00:30:07,117 --> 00:30:09,351
- [creaking]
- [grunts]

264
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:10,850
Easy!

265
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,251
Never been in better hands.

266
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,917
Easy!

267
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,883
Quit yer flailing, lad.

268
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,584
- I ain't!
- Y'are!

269
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:22,684
- Keep still!
- I am!

270
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,217
[screams]

271
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:32,284
[waves lapping]

272
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,351
[seagulls squawking]

273
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:54,351
- [seagull squawks]
- [shooing]

274
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,384
Git! Git! Git! Git!

275
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:59,384
[squawking]

276
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,351
[pen scratching on paper]

277
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,984
Thank ye, lad.

278
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:37,484
Winslow.

279
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:41,117
Ephraim Winslow.

280
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,984
These last two weeks, I'd...

281
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,351
I'd like it
if you'd call me by my name.

282
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:49,384
[chuckling] Listen to ye,

283
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,317
giving orders, lad.

284
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:54,618
- Winslow.
- All right, all right.

285
00:31:54,684 --> 00:31:57,984
Suits me just as fine,
Ephraim Winslow.

286
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:04,251
So, what brung such a one
as ye to this damned rock?

287
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:06,684
Such as what?

288
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,150
Pretty as a picture.

289
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:12,017
[laughing] Only joshing, lad,
only josh...

290
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:14,251
- Winslow.
- Winslow.

291
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:17,783
What brung ye...

292
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,451
[inhaling and exhaling]

293
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:24,251
...to this rock,
Ephraim Winslow?

294
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:28,984
What were yer work afore?

295
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:32,750
- Timber.
- Timber?

296
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:36,317
Big timber. Up north.
Canada ways.

297
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:39,351
- Hudson Bay outfit?
- The same.

298
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:40,783
True what they say?

299
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,317
"Forest as far
as the eye can see"?

300
00:32:43,384 --> 00:32:47,750
Yessir. Spruce, tamarack,
white pine.

301
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:49,750
"Bush," them folk
up there call it.

302
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:52,317
Had enough of trees,
that it, then?

303
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:53,484
Yes, sir.

304
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:56,050
Can't say I blame ye.

305
00:32:56,117 --> 00:32:58,451
I hearn tell
about that life.

306
00:32:58,517 --> 00:33:00,017
Hard goin'.

307
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:03,817
Workin' one man harder
than two hosses, they say.

308
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:06,084
No thankee.

309
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:13,284
The sea, she's the only
situation wantin' fer me.

310
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:17,651
Miss it?

311
00:33:17,718 --> 00:33:22,084
Ain't nothing
what can touch it.

312
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,551
But I can't...
[tapping leg]

313
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:26,284
be draggin'
me old stump about.

314
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,050
Nay. Not worth the trouble...

315
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:34,117
Now I'm a wickie
and a wickie I is.

316
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:38,251
And I'm damn-well wedded
to this here light,

317
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:42,618
and she's been a finer,
truer, quieter wife

318
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:45,184
than any alive-blooded woman.

319
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:49,050
Y'ever married?

320
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,817
Thirteen Christmases at sea...

321
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,850
Little 'uns at home.

322
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,850
She never forgave it.

323
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:03,984
'Tis fer the better.

324
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,551
Since we're getting
too friendly, Ephraim Winslow,

325
00:34:08,618 --> 00:34:14,050
tell me, what's a timber man
want with being a wickie?

326
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:21,984
Not enough quiet
for ye up north?

327
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,050
Sawdust itching yer nethers?

328
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:26,618
Foreman found ye
too high-tempered

329
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:28,351
for carrying an axe?

330
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:34,117
Like you said, I just had
enough of trees, I guess.

331
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,950
Since I left Dad,

332
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:45,150
I done every kind of work
that can pay a man.

333
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:47,050
Some I ain't near proud of.

334
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:50,184
- Drifter, eh?
- No, just...

335
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:53,718
Can't find a post
I can take a real shine to,

336
00:34:53,783 --> 00:34:55,651
so I keep movin' along.

337
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,084
And I ain't the kind
to look back

338
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,783
- at what's behind him, see.
- On the run?

339
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,684
Now look here,

340
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,351
ain't nothin' wrong with a man
startin' fresh, startin' new,

341
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:04,651
just lookin'
to earn a living...

342
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:06,417
- No...
- [sighs]

343
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:08,551
Just like any man,

344
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:11,917
just wanna settle down
quiet-like with some earnings.

345
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,684
I read someplace that

346
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,084
a man could earn 630...

347
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:20,117
I read $1,000 a year

348
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,351
if he tends a light
far off shore.

349
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:25,750
The further away,
the more he earns.

350
00:35:25,817 --> 00:35:29,817
I read that, and hell,
I says, work.

351
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:31,517
Save my earnings.

352
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:38,584
Sometime soon
I'll raise my own roof,

353
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:40,017
somewheres up country,

354
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:42,517
with no one to tell me
"what for".

355
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:44,984
And that's all.

356
00:35:49,718 --> 00:35:52,284
Same old, borin' story, eh?

357
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,251
Well, you asked.

358
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:07,484
Say, why is it bad luck
to kill a gull?

359
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:12,117
In 'em's the souls of sailors
what met their maker.

360
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:17,050
You a prayin' man, Winslow?

361
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:21,618

00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:53,175
Don't be losing
yer head now.

542
00:54:53,242 --> 00:54:55,342
- This ain't funny.
- No, it ain't.

543
00:54:55,409 --> 00:54:57,676
And I ain't want to be
stranded here

544
00:54:57,743 --> 00:54:59,542
with some damn lunatic.

545
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:03,542
[chuckles] Stranded?

546
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:05,942
- That's what I said.
- [distant foghorn]

547
00:55:06,008 --> 00:55:09,008
Why, I thought...
I thought you said relief was coming.

548
00:55:09,075 --> 00:55:12,109
If we can
wait out the storm.

549
00:55:13,442 --> 00:55:15,875
[stammers]
The tender is coming!

550
00:55:17,275 --> 00:55:18,776
In '75,

551
00:55:18,843 --> 00:55:23,109
Ol' Striker were marooned here
for seven long months, he was.

552
00:55:23,175 --> 00:55:24,908
The storm died
on the mainland,

553
00:55:24,975 --> 00:55:26,975
but here, the waters
were too rageful

554
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:29,409
neither to launch
nor land.

555
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:33,609
You're just tryin'
to scare me.

556
00:55:33,676 --> 00:55:36,576
Look at ye. Pretendin'.

557
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:42,442
But ye well know yer lot.

558
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:50,142
[thunder rumbling]

559
00:55:52,476 --> 00:55:54,075
[distant foghorn]

560
00:56:05,743 --> 00:56:07,743
[wind blowing]

561
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:09,175
[Thomas] Dig!

562
00:56:09,843 --> 00:56:11,776
[thunder rumbles]

563
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:13,376
Dig, says I!

564
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:15,509
Dig!

565
00:56:16,175 --> 00:56:17,409
Dig!

566
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:24,242
There she lies.

567
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:46,975
Rations.

568
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:50,975
The worst of us couldn't
fend 'gainst the ship rats

569
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:55,075
what gnawed
on the soles of our feet.

570
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:57,908
[distant foghorn]

571
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:02,908
Their legs withered
and turned gangree'nous,

572
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:06,609
every shade
of the peacock's tail.

573
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:08,942
Their gums grew swollen,

574
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:12,142
the color of bone,
then to rot.

575
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:14,676
Tarry blood oozed,

576
00:57:14,743 --> 00:57:20,008
teeth droppin' to the deck
with none to hold on to.

577
00:57:22,709 --> 00:57:26,942
"Land ho!" hears I,

578
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:29,743
but only grass
on that island.

579
00:57:29,809 --> 00:57:32,109
So we et upon the grass.

580
00:57:32,175 --> 00:57:34,509
'And 'twas that scurvy

581
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,576
what left me locked
ever since.

582
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:42,209
I thought you said
you'd broke it.

583
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,209
Aye?

584
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:45,476
Your leg.

585
00:57:46,275 --> 00:57:49,008
Catholic nuns
and such like.

586
00:57:50,209 --> 00:57:52,109
You must've misheard.

587
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,576
- I told that dumb bastard...
- Yep.

588
00:58:02,642 --> 00:58:04,309
Them eaves be gonners.

589
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:07,908
"Give me your cant hook,"
I says to him.

590
00:58:07,975 --> 00:58:12,175
But... [chuckles]
Foreman Winslow,

591
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:15,576
that goddamned
Canady bastard...

592
00:58:15,642 --> 00:58:18,743
- Winslow?
- ...always callin' me a dog.

593
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:20,109
A filthy dog.

594
00:58:20,175 --> 00:58:23,743
- I'll show you who's a dog.
- Winslow.

595
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:27,109
- What about...
- Who, Winslow?

596
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,376
The eaves be fallin'...

597
00:58:29,442 --> 00:58:32,676
- He's always raggin' on me...
- Ragging?

598
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:34,576
Like you.

599
00:58:34,642 --> 00:58:37,342
Damn fool nonsense.

600
00:58:37,409 --> 00:58:39,275
That's the trouble with ye,
Winslow.

601
00:58:39,342 --> 00:58:44,576
Trouble with you is eatin'
grass without no teeth.

602
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:46,376
Come now?

603
00:58:48,476 --> 00:58:53,109
Your sea matey's teeth
had falled out.

604
00:58:56,942 --> 00:58:58,542
What are ye gettin' at,
Winslow?

605
00:58:59,908 --> 00:59:02,642
Well, it just seems
powerful hard

606
00:59:04,075 --> 00:59:08,942
to eat grass with no teeth.

607
00:59:09,008 --> 00:59:12,376
'Cause goats
and sheeps and cows...

608
00:59:12,442 --> 00:59:17,309
Well, now, they all
got teeth, don't they?

609
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:23,576
Y'know how y'eat grass
without yer teeth?

610
00:59:24,942 --> 00:59:26,275
Oblige me.

611
00:59:26,342 --> 00:59:29,042
Ye rip it out
and ye swallow it.

612
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,242
[both laughing]

613
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:34,576
You rip it out
and you swallow it.

614
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:40,275
- Ye rip it out...
- I don't know 'bout that.

615
00:59:41,242 --> 00:59:42,743
Y'don't?

616
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:44,142
I don't.

617
00:59:44,908 --> 00:59:46,509
[distant foghorn]

618
00:59:47,109 --> 00:59:48,908
[window rattles]

619
00:59:52,442 --> 00:59:54,075
[wood creaking]

620
00:59:57,409 --> 00:59:58,542
What?

621
01:00:01,676 --> 01:00:03,042
What?

622
01:00:06,509 --> 01:00:07,642
What?

623
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:11,275
What?

624
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:12,875
What?

625
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,942
- What?
- What?

626
01:00:14,008 --> 01:00:15,042
- What?
- What?

627
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:16,175
- What?
- What?

628
01:00:16,242 --> 01:00:17,476
- What?
- What?

629
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:18,542
- What?
- What?

630
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:19,709
- What?
- What?

631
01:00:19,776 --> 01:00:21,908
[both repeatedly] What?

632
01:00:23,175 --> 01:00:25,442
- That's what I mean!
- What?

633
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:28,609
- That's the trouble with you.
- That's the trouble with ye!

634
01:00:28,676 --> 01:00:29,776
- With you!
- With ye!

635
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:30,942
No!

636
01:00:31,008 --> 01:00:32,875
[shouting] No!

637
01:00:33,908 --> 01:00:36,175
I want a steak!

638
01:00:36,242 --> 01:00:38,509
I want a goddamned steak!

639
01:00:38,576 --> 01:00:39,843
- [laughing]
- I...

640
01:00:39,908 --> 01:00:42,743
If I had a steak...
Oh, boy!

641
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:45,809
A... A rare,
a bloody steak.

642
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,275
If I... If I had a steak,

643
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:51,008
I would fuck it.

644
01:00:56,275 --> 01:00:57,942
You don't like me cookin'?

645
01:00:58,008 --> 01:01:00,075
Ugh, don't be
such an old bitch!

646
01:01:01,509 --> 01:01:02,442
You're drunk!

647
01:01:02,509 --> 01:01:04,042
Ye don't know
what ye're talkin'...

648
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:05,476
How could I possibly like

649
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:07,442
the horse shit
you fix us for supper?

650
01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:10,743
Ye're drunk,
or ye wouldn't be saying that!

651
01:01:10,809 --> 01:01:12,209
Them tin kitchen
shanty cooks

652
01:01:12,275 --> 01:01:14,242
gave us fried donuts
three times a day

653
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:15,743
and country ham
bigger than your fist...

654
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:16,975
Ye're drunk! Ye're drunk!
Ye're drunk!

655
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:19,042
- I'm drunk?
- You heard me!

656
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:20,908
- You've been drunk since...
- Damn ye!

657
01:01:20,975 --> 01:01:23,743
Drunk since I first
laid eyes on you.

658
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:26,109
Ye're fond of me lobster,
ain't ye?

659
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:28,042
You're drunker
than a Virginy fence.

660
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:32,209
I seen it.
Ye're fond of me lobster.

661
01:01:33,576 --> 01:01:35,042
Say it.

662
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:38,109
Say it.

663
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:40,843
Say it!

664
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:42,743
I don't have to say nothin'.

665
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:44,309
Damn ye!

666
01:01:45,609 --> 01:01:49,242
Let Neptune strike ye dead,
Winslow!

667
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:53,142
- [shouts] Hark!
- [thunder cracks]

668
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:57,042
Hark, Triton, Hark!

669
01:01:58,142 --> 01:02:02,442
Bellow, bid our father,
the sea king,

670
01:02:02,509 --> 01:02:07,008
rise from the depths,
full foul in his fury,

671
01:02:07,075 --> 01:02:10,676
black waves teeming
with salt-foam,

672
01:02:10,743 --> 01:02:15,409
to smother this young mouth
with pungent slime,

673
01:02:15,476 --> 01:02:19,142
to choke ye,
engorging yer organs

674
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:21,409
till ye turn
blue and bloated

675
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:25,142
with bilge and brine
and can scream no more.

676
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:30,109
Only when he,
crowned in cockle shells

677
01:02:30,175 --> 01:02:35,042
with slithering tentacled tail
and steaming beard,

678
01:02:35,109 --> 01:02:38,064
take up his fell,
be-finned arm,

679
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:40,350
his coral-tined trident
screeches

680
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:42,650
banshee-like in the tempest

681
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:46,484
and plunges
right through yer gullet,

682
01:02:47,417 --> 01:02:49,317
bursting ye,

683
01:02:49,383 --> 01:02:52,617
a bulging bladder no more,

684
01:02:52,684 --> 01:02:55,017
but a blasted bloody film now,

685
01:02:55,084 --> 01:03:00,550
a nothing for the Harpies
and the souls of dead sailors

686
01:03:00,617 --> 01:03:03,550
to peck and claw
and feed upon,

687
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:06,817
only to be lapped up
and swallowed

688
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:08,951
by the infinite waters

689
01:03:09,017 --> 01:03:12,917
of the dread emperor himself,

690
01:03:12,984 --> 01:03:15,450
forgotten to any man,

691
01:03:16,784 --> 01:03:18,084
to any time,

692
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:23,650
forgotten to any God or devil,
forgotten even to the sea,

693
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:27,684
for any stuff
or part of Winslow,

694
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:30,884
even any scantling
of your soul,

695
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:33,484
is Winslow no more,

696
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:38,650
but is now itself the sea.

697
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:48,917
All right.
Have it your way.

698
01:03:48,984 --> 01:03:50,617
I like your cooking.

699
01:03:52,984 --> 01:03:54,951
- [thunder rumbling]
- [clock ticking]

700
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:07,017
[clock continues ticking]

701
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:52,617

[grunting]

703
01:05:17,851 --> 01:05:19,017
Bitch.

704

708
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,984
[Thomas] Queer way
to wear yer shoes.

709
01:06:50,851 --> 01:06:53,584
Just didn't wanna wake you,
is all.

710
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:57,684
It's a long night.

711
01:06:58,784 --> 01:06:59,717
And such.

712
01:06:59,784 --> 01:07:03,317
Hmm. The sun is
over the yardarm.

713
01:07:03,383 --> 01:07:04,717
Best find me some winks

714
01:07:04,784 --> 01:07:07,751
afore the day
draws farther on.

715
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:10,383
[Thomas farts]

716
01:07:11,317 --> 01:07:13,517
Get back to yer duties

717
01:07:13,584 --> 01:07:16,417
or I'll give you
a real keelhauling.

718
01:07:18,317 --> 01:07:19,917
[foghorn blasting]

01:07:27,118 --> 01:07:28,717

Deducted from yer pay.

899
01:22:28,084 --> 01:22:31,151
Look at yer shiverin'.

900
01:22:31,218 --> 01:22:34,751
Ye're so mad,
y'know not up from down.

901
01:22:38,517 --> 01:22:41,417
How long have we been
on this rock?

902
01:22:41,951 --> 01:22:43,317
Five weeks?

903
01:22:43,383 --> 01:22:44,951
Two days?

904
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:48,051
Where are we?

905
01:22:48,118 --> 01:22:54,650
Help me to recollect,
who are you again, Tommy?

906
01:22:54,717 --> 01:22:57,817
I'm probably a figment
of your imagination.

907
01:22:57,884 --> 01:23:03,617
This rock is a figment
of yer imagination, too.

908
01:23:03,684 --> 01:23:08,084
Ye're probably wand'rin'
through a grove of tag alders,

909
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:09,584
up north in Canady,

910
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:15,517
like a frostbitten maniac
talkin' to yerself,

911
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,650
knee-deep in snow.

912
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:19,984
[wind howling]

913
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:34,817
[grunts]

914
01:23:41,051 --> 01:23:43,017
I could use me a smoke.

915
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:47,650
We're outta drink.

916
01:24:18,617 --> 01:24:20,917
[sputters and gags]

917
01:24:20,984 --> 01:24:22,884
Ooh!

918
01:24:22,951 --> 01:24:24,917
Monkey pump!

919
01:24:24,984 --> 01:24:27,283
[both howling]

920
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,484
[machinery whirring]

921
01:25:15,118 --> 01:25:17,283
[both laughing]

922
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:21,283
[thunder crashing]

923
01:25:42,383 --> 01:25:44,017
[seagulls squawking]

924
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:55,550
[Ephraim] This place is a sty.

925
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,617
[Thomas] Mornin' to you too.

926
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:01,717
[grunts]

927
01:26:05,784 --> 01:26:08,184
I wish I could
go for a walk.

928
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,984
Be my guest.

929
01:26:10,051 --> 01:26:11,350
You'll get drowned.

930
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:13,317
[clattering]

931
01:26:41,984 --> 01:26:43,617
[coughing]

932
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:52,684
[clock ticking]

933
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:02,984
[grunts]

934
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,717
[clock continues ticking]

935
01:27:52,751 --> 01:27:54,450
Fiery pit!

936
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:57,784
[grunts]

937
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:03,317
Ain't there no justice
left in this world?

938
01:28:03,383 --> 01:28:04,751
[match strikes]

939
01:28:12,017 --> 01:28:13,484
Thankee.

940
01:28:14,517 --> 01:28:16,650
What's wrong with yer hand?

941
01:28:20,684 --> 01:28:22,283
The other one.

942
01:28:24,283 --> 01:28:27,017
Ye hear o' tetanus?

943
01:28:27,084 --> 01:28:29,484
- Tet-a-nus?
- Yeah.

944
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:31,584
It started as a sliver of a cut,
is all...

945
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:33,250
I said I heard of it.

946
01:28:33,317 --> 01:28:35,383
...from the forestaysail
when we shoved off...

947
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:36,984
- Don't you ever shut up?
- ...but come a fortnight,

948
01:28:37,051 --> 01:28:38,884
- the bosun was a-shakin'.
- Stop.

949
01:28:38,951 --> 01:28:41,984
His jaw locked tighter
than an anchor...

950
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:45,218
Shut your gum, goddamn it!
I can't hear no more!

951
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:47,817
What were it
ye accused me of?

952
01:28:47,884 --> 01:28:50,450
Y'already told me
y'had me figgerd.

953
01:28:51,383 --> 01:28:55,484
I'm tired
of your damned-fool yarns

954
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:57,784
and your Cap'n Ahab horseshit.

955
01:28:57,851 --> 01:29:00,984
You sound like
a goddamned parody.

956
01:29:01,051 --> 01:29:04,884
Givin' and nagging orders
like a spinster schoolmarm,

957
01:29:04,951 --> 01:29:07,118
and all the while
turning this station

958
01:29:07,184 --> 01:29:09,184
- to the Devil's own rum hole.
- Ye're makin' a fool of yerself.

959
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,417
Well, it's all horseshit,

960
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:15,283
your leg, and your sea life,

961
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:17,550
all of it!

962
01:29:17,617 --> 01:29:20,084
And if I hear
one more word of horseshit

963
01:29:20,151 --> 01:29:23,017
coming out of your foul,
rotten tooth,

964
01:29:23,084 --> 01:29:25,250
- smelly old mouth...
- Ye...

965
01:29:25,317 --> 01:29:26,917
Shut up your gum, goddamn it!

966
01:29:26,984 --> 01:29:29,383
I ain't finished yet!

967
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:31,817
You think you're so goddamned
high and mighty

968
01:29:31,884 --> 01:29:35,017
just 'cause you're a
goddamned lighthouse keeper?

969
01:29:35,084 --> 01:29:37,984
Well, you ain't a captain
of no ship and you never was!

970
01:29:38,051 --> 01:29:41,517
You ain't no general,
you ain't no copper,

971
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:44,383
you ain't the president,
and you ain't my father!

972
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:46,984
And I'm sick of you
actin' like you is!

973
01:29:47,051 --> 01:29:51,084
I'm sick of your laughing,
your snoring,

974
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:53,951
and your goddamned farts.

975
01:29:54,017 --> 01:29:56,584
Your goddamned...

976
01:29:56,650 --> 01:30:00,283
- Goddamn your farts!
- [clattering]

977
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:02,951
[exhales]
You smell like piss,

978
01:30:03,017 --> 01:30:05,550
you smell like jism,

979
01:30:05,617 --> 01:30:09,684
like rotten dick,
like curdled foreskin,

980
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:13,051
like hot onions fucked
a farmyard shit-house.

981
01:30:13,118 --> 01:30:15,550
And I'm sick of your smell.
I'm sick of it!

982
01:30:15,617 --> 01:30:17,484
I'm sick of it,
you goddamned drunk.

983
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:21,350
You goddamned, no-account,
son-of-a-bitch-bastard liar!

984
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:23,184
That's what you are!

985
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:27,317
You're a goddamned,
drunken, horse-shitting,

986
01:30:27,383 --> 01:30:30,450
short, shit liar.

987
01:30:30,851 --> 01:30:32,484
A liar!

988
01:30:33,617 --> 01:30:34,951
[panting]

989
01:30:38,218 --> 01:30:40,517
Ye have a way with words,
Tommy.

990
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:43,851
[groans in frustration]
Damn you!

991
01:30:47,051 --> 01:30:49,283
Ye're relieved
of yer duties.

992
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:51,650
[laughing hysterically]

993
01:30:51,717 --> 01:30:54,218
No need to tell me,
old timer.

994
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:56,984
[water sloshing]

995
01:30:57,051 --> 01:30:58,650
[footsteps thudding]

996
01:31:05,984 --> 01:31:08,151
"Assistant slept late."

997
01:31:08,218 --> 01:31:10,084
"Work below standard."

998
01:31:10,151 --> 01:31:12,817
"Attitude hostile."

999
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:17,051
"Assistant missing."

1000
01:31:17,118 --> 01:31:22,684
"Given to habitual self-abuse
in the supply shed."

1001
01:31:24,751 --> 01:31:25,817
"Drunk on duty!"

1002
01:31:26,884 --> 01:31:28,283
"Assault!"

1003
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:29,684
"Theft!"

1004
01:31:29,751 --> 01:31:34,250
"Recommend severance
without pay."

1005
01:31:34,317 --> 01:31:36,951
- Severance without pay?
- [book clatters]

1006
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:40,417
You trying to ruin me?

1007
01:31:41,084 --> 01:31:42,617
I'm a hard worker.

1008
01:31:42,684 --> 01:31:45,617
I am. I work as hard
as any man.

1009
01:31:45,684 --> 01:31:47,684
- Ye lie, Thomas.
- Stop it!

1010
01:31:47,751 --> 01:31:51,650
Ye lie to yerself,
but y'ain't have the sauce to see it.

1011
01:31:51,717 --> 01:31:52,951
Please...

1012
01:31:55,118 --> 01:31:57,617
Just let me into the light,
old man.

1013
01:31:57,684 --> 01:31:59,517
I've learned so much
from you.

1014
01:31:59,584 --> 01:32:02,151
Just let me show you.
Another chance.

1015
01:32:02,218 --> 01:32:04,851
Forgive and forget, I says.

1016
01:32:04,917 --> 01:32:07,817
Just let me
into that lantern, is all.

1017
01:32:07,884 --> 01:32:09,084
Don't make me beg...

1018
01:32:09,151 --> 01:32:10,450
Or I'll beg.

1019
01:32:10,517 --> 01:32:12,851
I'll beg if that's
what you want. I'll beg.

1020
01:32:14,317 --> 01:32:15,684
Please!

1021
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:20,350
Please! Please! Please!

1022
01:32:20,417 --> 01:32:21,884
Stand down.

1023
01:32:23,317 --> 01:32:25,250
You selfish bastard!

1024
01:32:25,317 --> 01:32:27,851
Keepin' it all to yourself.

1025
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,184
You left your old lady,

1026
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,151
your children, for what?
For what?

1027
01:32:31,218 --> 01:32:38,184
Look at ye, handsome lad,
with eyes bright as a lady.

1028
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:41,617
Come to this rock
playin' the tough.

1029
01:32:41,684 --> 01:32:44,984
Ye make me laugh
with yer false grum.

1030
01:32:45,051 --> 01:32:49,417
Ye pretended to some mystery
in yer quietudes,

1031
01:32:49,484 --> 01:32:52,884
but there ain't no mystery.

1032
01:32:53,884 --> 01:32:55,250
Ye're an open book.

1033
01:32:55,317 --> 01:32:57,684
A picture, says I.

1034
01:32:58,717 --> 01:33:02,184
A painted actress
screaming in the footlights,

1035
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:04,350
a bitch what wants
to be coveted

1036
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:05,984
for nothin' but being born,

1037
01:33:06,051 --> 01:33:09,450
cryin' bout the silver spoon
what should've been yers.

1038
01:33:10,884 --> 01:33:14,684
Now look at ye cryin'.

1039
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,784
Boo! Boo!

1040
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:20,584
What you gonna do?

1041
01:33:21,218 --> 01:33:22,851
Will ye kill me?

1042
01:33:23,417 --> 01:33:25,283
Will ye?

1043
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,550
Will y'kill me
like y'done that gull?

1044
01:33:27,617 --> 01:33:29,784
- I didn't...
- Liar!

1045
01:33:29,851 --> 01:33:31,317
Y'murdering dog!

1046
01:33:31,383 --> 01:33:34,350
Twas ye what changed
the wind on us.

1047
01:33:34,417 --> 01:33:37,084
Twas ye what damned us, dog.
Twas ye!

1048
01:33:37,151 --> 01:33:41,417
Will y'do what y'wish
y'done to Ol' Winslow?

1049
01:33:41,484 --> 01:33:44,984
Will ye best me then?
For Winslow were right!

1050
01:33:45,051 --> 01:33:47,317
Thomas, ye're a dog!

1051
01:33:47,383 --> 01:33:50,350
A filthy dog! A dog!

Bark.

1064

Bark, boy.

1065
01:36:01,417 --> 01:36:03,250
Bark, laddy.

[Thomas] Woof.

1068

Ain't ye never been

1069
01:36:14,118 --> 01:36:16,218
Bark, I says. Bark!

Bark, laddy!

Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

1073
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:26,517
- Now, there's a good boy.
- Ruff!

1074
01:36:27,484 --> 01:36:28,751
There's a good dog.

1075
01:36:28,817 --> 01:36:31,817
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

1076
01:36:33,017 --> 01:36:34,383
Ruff!

1077
01:36:35,283 --> 01:36:36,917
Now roll over.

1078
01:36:38,817 --> 01:36:41,717
- [waves crashing]
- [seagulls squawking]

1079
01:36:53,817 --> 01:36:55,383
Come on.

1080
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:57,684
- [groaning]
- Come on.

1081
01:37:06,684 --> 01:37:08,851
- [Thomas groaning]
- Git!

1082
01:37:32,084 --> 01:37:33,550
[Ephraim] Get up here.

1083
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:35,817
[grunting]

1084
01:37:51,484 --> 01:37:54,383
Good boy. Good boy.

1085
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:58,283
Now you git in there,
where you belong.

1086
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,650
You do as I say, dog.

1087
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:08,383
There's my good lad.

01:38:16,051 --> 01:38:17,517
[Thomas groaning]

1089
01:38:22,817 --> 01:38:26,784
[Thomas] Ye wish to see
what's in the lantern?

1090
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:30,151
So did me last assistant.

1091
01:38:30,218 --> 01:38:31,851
Shut up, old dog!

1092
01:38:33,151 --> 01:38:35,550
Polish your brasswork.

1093
01:38:35,617 --> 01:38:36,951
[groans]

1094
01:38:37,017 --> 01:38:42,317
O what Protean forms swim up
from men's minds,

1095
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:46,184
and melt in
hot Promethean plunder,

1096
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:47,684
scorching eyes,

1097
01:38:47,751 --> 01:38:50,617
with divine shames
and horror...

1098
01:38:51,984 --> 01:38:57,084
And casting them down
to Davy Jones.

1099
01:38:57,151 --> 01:39:00,851
The others, still blind,

1100
01:39:00,917 --> 01:39:03,884
yet in it see

1101
01:39:03,951 --> 01:39:09,084
all the divine graces

1102
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:13,584
and to Fiddler's Green sent,

1103
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:19,717
where no man is suffered
to want or toil,

1104
01:39:19,784 --> 01:39:20,951
but is...

1105
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:23,617
Ancient...

1106
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:27,984
Mutable and unchanging

1107
01:39:29,317 --> 01:39:35,450
as the she who girdles
'round the globe.

1108
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:38,350
Them's truth.

1109
01:39:39,851 --> 01:39:41,250
You'll be punished.

Should pale death

1122

make the ocean caves
our bed,

1123
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:14,250
God who hear'st
the surges roll,

1124
01:42:14,317 --> 01:42:17,017
deign to save
the suppliant soul.
