1
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:55,588
If you're ever tucked
inside Laurel Canyon,

2
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,190
this is the street
my two sisters used to live on.

3
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:09,702
If you listen carefully,

4
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:14,340
you can almost always hear
a distant howling.

5
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,568
My name is Emily.

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,670
And I was born
without a heartbeat.

7
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:48,140
I'd have been
the middle sister.

8
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:52,711
Right between Elle,
the oldest,

9
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:55,247
and Joy,
the youngest.

10
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:03,156
The three of us
would have lived on Weepah Way.

11
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,258
This would have been
our neighborhood.

12
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:10,730
We would have been
three wild animals.

13
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:15,044
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

14
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,307
<b>WEEPAH WAY FOR NOW</b>

15
00:02:23,308 --> 00:02:25,777
I'm here to show you
the last week my sisters spent

16
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,080
on Weepah Way.

17
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,549
At the time,

18
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,483
Elle and Joy
were eight months removed

19
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,686
from moving in
to Laurel Canyon,

20
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:37,622
an historic neighborhood
between sunset and ventura.

21
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:40,826
Two years removed from moving
out of the family house

22
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,830
and in with our
newly divorced mother.

23
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:47,432
Three years from discovering
our father was cheating.

24
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:51,671
Four years removed from starting
anti-anxiety medication.

25
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,672
And eight years
since releasing

26
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:57,143
their last album
as recording artists.

27
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,780
Shit.

28
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,348
-Okay.
-God.

29
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,683
-Different bowl.
-What the shit?

30
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,252
Shit.
I think it's on fire.

31
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:08,121
Let me tell you
about them.

32
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:10,555
Elle liked making budgets,
but never kept them.

33
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:12,592
She loved knowing
what job paid

34
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:15,393
for every item
in her life.

35
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:17,729
Joy would report
Elle's spending to our mother.

36
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:19,831
The separation
from our parents

37
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:23,603
didn't trigger any addictions
or odd behavior.

38
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,805
There was
no real acting out.

39
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:28,840
Although the trauma
might have accentuated

40
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:31,309
the habits
my sisters already had.

41
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:33,746
This is my father, John.

42
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,347
This is my mother, Lynn.

43
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,550
On the rare occasions
Elle and Joy saw him,

44
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,287
they invariably went out
sailing on the canals

45
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,288
around his new
bachelor's retreat.

46
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,790
Mom claimed to enjoy
her freedom.

47
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:50,463
Especially her freedom to stop as
frequently as she wanted on car trips.

48
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,265
Joy, my younger sister,

49
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:55,500
was the last to let go
of the image of our father

50
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,170
as a great man.

51
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,171
Look at this one.

52
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:03,710
All of the ties to their
youth were slipping away.

53
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,520
This is Elle
at 24.

54
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:17,323
This is Joy
at 22.

55
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,791
This is the house
my mom shared with cowboy Lou,

56
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:21,827
her boyfriend of two weeks

57
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,396
who owned a winery
in Paso Robles.

58
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:27,465
She moved in with him
only days after discovering

59
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:31,469
she had two years before
her savings would run out.

60
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:34,774
Elle and Joy, tucked into the
hillside of Laurel Canyon

61
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:38,577
believed it would all
come together.

62
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,480
All of it for the good.

63
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,419
Elle, roadie threw up all over
herself on her Gandalf beard.

64
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,221
And it's dripping.

65
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:50,823
Here, stay in the shower.
Stay there, stay there. Stay!

66
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:54,226
Welcome to a typical morning
with my sisters.

67
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,796
What the fuck?
Were you just touching that?

68
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,730
You're vile,
why is that out?

69
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:00,633
-Why are you in here?
-I'm in here because I don't wanna

70
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,702
drain roadie's vomit beard
in my shower.

71
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:05,003
-That's nice.
-You okay, honey?

72
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,871
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

73
00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:08,440
You're disgusting, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

74
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,243
Mom warned me about this.

75
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:11,643
That it would be really hard
living together,

76
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:13,979
because I do all the work
around here

77
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,282
-while you sit here vibrating.
-She said that? That's interesting.

78
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:16,912
'Cause she said the
same thing about you.

79
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:17,211
Are you kidding me?

80
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:18,340
Why are you here?

81
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,386
I do so much and mom knows
I don't use a vibrator

82
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,955
-to distract me from everyday living.
-Great.

83
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:24,824
Don't use one
in the bath either,

84
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,291
you'll get electrocuted.
Don't even look at that.

85
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,294
Electrocuted?
It's battery operated.

86
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,895
And by the way,
that was not me.

87
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,797
No, that was some weird noise
in the house. Good night.

88
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,866
I really don't think
we should have the party here.

89
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:35,701
I think everything we've been doing
right now is destined to fail.

90
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,335
No, no, no. We are having
a party here. Stop.

91
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:38,503
I don't think
anyone is gonna show.

92
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:39,938
And last year
for Halloween,

93
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,275
we ordered 15 pumpkins
and carving stations,

94
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,777
and how many people came?
Just tell me.

95
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,379
Remind me, for fun.

96
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,481
Two. Hard to forget,
isn't it?

97
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:50,315
It doesn't matter, okay?
People are gonna show up.

98
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,618
They have to.
We're leaving the country.

99
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,185
They're gonna be asshole
friends if they don't.

100
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:54,953
They are asshole friends.

101
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:56,421
Half of them are musicians or
actors. They're not gonna show up.

102
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,791
By the way,
when does terminix come?

103
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:01,760
8:00-12:00. Fuckers never
give an exact time,

104
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,395
so the guy's window
is huge.

105
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,530
Who says 8:00-12:00?

106
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:07,499
That's like me saying "I'll show up
to an audition from 8:00-12:00."

107
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:09,701
What time are we expecting her?
I don't know, 8:00-12:00.

108
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,469
Could be 9:30...
Could be 10:15...

109
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:13,606
Could be 11:52...
Could be past 12:00.

110
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:14,606
Then that's
really fucked.

111
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,342
Yeah, no shit.

112
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,511
You gotta get up at 8:00
in case they come at 8:00.

113
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,846
Then you have to live your life staying
here just to wait for the Rat Man.

114
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:22,614
Shit.
Well, it's better that

115
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,082
than it comes out
during the party.

116
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:26,919
It's like...

117
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,556
It still smells like
something died in here.

118
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,558
It on...
Every time I walk in.

119
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,392
My thing
that I'm worried about

120
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:35,895
is that this house isn't going
to look good for our party.

121
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,331
'Cause when dad shows up
I don't want him doubting us.

122
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,543
I don't want him saying,
"There's Rats..."

123
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:41,633
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

124
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,102
"When dad comes?"

125
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:46,438
-I might've invited him.
-You told our father

126
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,573
-to come to our going away party?
-Yeah, 'cause he's our dad.

127
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,342
-That's so nice.
-He's blood, you know?

128
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,544
Thanks...
You fucked up.

129
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:53,177
Why?

130
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:54,979
You fucking invited him,
when you shouldn't have.

131
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:56,715
And I know why you did it.

132
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:58,049
Because in your little,
weird, strange, obsessive mind,

133
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,719
you're sitting there
in your room

134
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,453
and your mind is racing,
your heart is beating fast.

135
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:03,054
-You're like...
-You know what? He's blood.

136
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,457
And we need to just fucking
stop pussying out about dad

137
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,959
and getting scared about what
he's gonna do at a party.

138
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,426
Admit that you fucked up.
And I will let it go.

139
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,762
Just say,
"you know what, Elle?

140
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:10,962
You're right.
I did something wrong.

141
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:12,464
It's my issue."

142
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,400
Admit it right now,
you fucked up.

143
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,404
Was that just you?

144
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,574
Was that the smell of you?
Your life? Your being?

145
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,943
-Yes.
-It smells like an aquarium.

146
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,146
-Yeah, it smells nice...
-It smells like a fucking fish tank.

147
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:29,414
That is rude. And by the way,
who cares about my little...

148
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,750
-you made her pant harder.
-Who cares if I'm a little stinky.

149
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,118
That's disgusting.

150
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,919
You think my problems
of o. C.D. Are a problem.

151
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:36,522
You need
to fucking bathe.

152
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:38,556
I'm sorry, I sweat
like a normal human being.

153
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,926
-Do you wash?
-Shut up.

154
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,496
-Yes I do.
-Do you clean?

155
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,831
Really?
Are you asking that question?

156
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,566
Yeah, I am, because your
sister is very clean.

157
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,736
Clean skin, clean nails.
Clean face.

158
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,071
I... my vagina
is always clean.

159
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,005
-My breath never smells.
-Your vagina never...

160
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,215
how do you know that
your vagina never smells?

161
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:55,608
I got a physical.

162
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,609
-No, I don't go down and smell.
-Yep, mom!

163
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:59,445
-Vagina's clean. What?
-My nails are clean and always done.

164
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:00,812
My skin is clean.

165
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:02,681
I wash my feet
so they don't smell.

166
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:05,084
I don't sweat that much
because I have the ac on.

167
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:06,818
I think about these things.

168
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:09,020
Okay, let me fucking text
all of your ex-boyfriends

169
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,455
and ask if your vagina never smelled
the entire time you were with them.

170
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:11,856
Sure, they'll all have
the same answer.

171
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,692
Every once in a while
you'll have a bad day

172
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:15,660
because you're on your period
and it gets a little stinky.

173
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,462
All right, put the female stuff
aside. Clean, all the time.

174
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,563
Yeah, well, at least
I didn't lose my virginity

175
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:21,099
to a 33-year-old
fucking creep.

176
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,101
Yeah, that's right.
He was 33.

177
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,537
That's Christ's age. Okay?

178
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,538
That's a powerful age
right there

179
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,905
to lose your virginity.

180
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,140
"Powerful age to lose
your virginity to?"

181
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,476
Are you shitting me
right now?

182
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,035
That's a very important
age in the biblical times.

183
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:32,544
Is it?

184
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:34,179
So Christ was just 33 the entire
time he was in the Bible?

185
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:35,814
-I didn't know he was frozen in time.
-Not saying that.

186
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,817
Most famous age was 33.
Crucifixion.

187
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,485
Okay.
Crucifixion.

188
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,920
In my mind
I feel like maybe

189
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:43,021
when he was a baby
that was a pretty big deal.

190
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,056
When he was like, in a manger
in swaddling clothes

191
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,525
and Mary gave birth to him.
I think that was a big deal.

192
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,626
Most famous age
would be crucifixion.

193
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,829
-Anyone would tell you that, 33.
-Really? Is that right? Is that right?

194
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:53,097
-Is it, is it really that age?
-Yeah, it was 33.

195
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,766
Interesting.

196
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,168
Because I would say
that if the wise men were here,

197
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,770
they would probably agree
with me and say...

198
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,038
Would you talk
to the wise men like that,

199
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,806
with that
"valley girl" accent?

200
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:03,508
Yo, wise men, what was
the most famous age of Christ?

201
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,612
They would say, 100 percent
that it was when he was a baby.

202
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:09,048
-No, no, no. Get her.
-No, no, no.

203
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,883
No, no, she's fine.

204
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:12,684
I don't feel good
about what's been going on.

205
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,118
I'm... I'm fucking upset.

206
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:16,254
Because we keep getting
bad rejection.

207
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,388
And I feel like how
roadie looks right now.

208
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:17,755
Really?

209
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:19,690
What... yeah.
With barf on your face?

210
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:20,745
-Yes.
-Yeah, that's how I feel too.

211
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:22,895
I feel like we're just standing
there with barf and shit on our face,

212
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:24,663
like,
"here's our record."

213
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:27,066
These small comedies,
they don't work.

214
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:29,834
Just last week, I saw a few
that my clients were in.

215
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,503
I wanted
to poke my eyes out.

216
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,738
And now you want to make
a small, independent comedy,

217
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:35,940
heartfelt or not,
nobody's gonna see it.

218
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:38,643
Hello, down there.

219
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,146
Everyone's so little
from up here, aren't they?

220
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:43,616
Look at that lady.

221
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,583
She doesn't know
what's going on up here.

222
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:47,719
She doesn't know what's going on
up here in this office, does she?

223
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:49,153
It's crazy, right?

224
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,722
We're just up here
doing whatever we're doing,

225
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,558
and she's down there
walking her fucking kid.

226
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,092
What were we
talking about?

227
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,261
I really love
that you guys want to produce.

228
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:59,698
It's one of the reasons I was
interested in representing you.

229
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:00,832
This is not the one.

230
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,635
Let's put it on the table.

231
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,904
Let's focus on the things
that are working for you.

232
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,972
Would the indie financing department
be willing to take a look?

233
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,807
That's kinda
why we're here.

234
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,576
Can I ask you one more question
before we change the subject?

235
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,277
Yeah.

236
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,913
Can we talk
about the tour?

237
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,948
-Yeah.
-The tour...

238
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:18,550
Not a good idea.

239
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,285
Why did you change
your hair color?

240
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,553
How did that happen?

241
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,788
I mean,
this is for a role.

242
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,957
So it's been like this
for like a year.

243
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,092
-Like a role in a movie?
-In a film.

244
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,562
-Yeah, yeah.
-Like a studio pic?

245
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,446
No, no. This really great
little independent I did.

246
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:32,064
Fuck it.

247
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:33,966
Fuck that shit.

248
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,869
God damn it,
I need to pee.

249
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:38,803
I always wondered
if I could jump

250
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:41,640
from the top of this building
to the top of that building.

251
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,676
I think
I could make it.

252
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,111
I think I could make it.

253
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:48,780
Do like some parkour shit
down the side of the building

254
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,049
if I miss...
Only if I miss.

255
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,817
In the case
that I did miss,

256
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,919
but I think I could just...
Clear shot right over there.

257
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:56,621
Anyway, when can you change
your hair back?

258
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:59,024
Actually, first of all,
we're going to Turkey

259
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,960
is our first leg of the tour...

260
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:02,226
-We're going to Europe.
-Turkey...

261
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,197
Yeah, and then I also really...

262
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,366
Everybody in Turkey's poor.

263
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,635
There's no money there.
Go to Dubai.

264
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,938
So close. It's just... the
production sounds a little like a...

265
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,077
Dumbed...
Dumbed down.

266
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,379
It was...
It feels dumbed down.

267
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:22,080
That's hard to say,
"dumbed down."

268
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,148
Try that.

269
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,150
"Dumbed down."

270
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:28,153
Dumbed down.

271
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:28,930
Yeah, but see, you're
missing the second "d."

272
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:29,981
Say, "dumbed down."

273
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,531
-It's weird, it sounds...
-"Dumbed down."

274
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,092
I don't think...
Don't say it.

275
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,094
"Dumbed down. You guys
dumbed her down."

276
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,728
By the way, it's freezing in
here. Please turn the air off.

277
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:38,664
Look at me,
I'm fucking dripping.

278
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,399
You're gross.
You're like a miniature mom.

279
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:42,000
-I'm really hot.
-You're menopausing at 22 like her.

280
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,702
It would help you.

281
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:45,704
You wouldn't wake up
in a bath of aquarium water

282
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:48,272
if you actually turned on the AC
and helped yourself.

283
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:50,074
You know what? I'm gonna
have a house when I'm older.

284
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:52,645
When I'm an adult,
when I'm like a grown human,

285
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,713
I'm gonna have my children, that are
gonna be fucking adorable and hot.

286
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:59,885
-And guess what?
-Okay. Depends on who you marry.

287
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:01,120
We're not gonna
have any AC ever.

288
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,254
-Ever?
-No AC. Nope.

289
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:03,821
-Just fans.
-You live in California.

290
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:05,658
You can't come over
with mom

291
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,026
and turn the air conditioning
on, 'cause there isn't one.

292
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:08,193
That's fine.
I don't wanna be invited over.

293
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,395
Good, yeah, well,
guess what...

294
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,230
You're just really
a mean person.

295
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,365
-You don't care about your family.
-Unlike you, unlike you,

296
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,868
I can be by myself and not have a
panic attack in my own bed, like...

297
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,737
Really? We're gonna fucking talk
and joke about my panic attacks?

298
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,240
I'm a creative being.

299
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,375
I suffer with anxiety and OCD.

300
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:26,010
Just like people
like Beethoven and Mozart.

301
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:28,179
Those people had
the same fucking issues.

302
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,847
And they ended up
killing themselves because of...

303
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,049
So now you're wishing
that you're dead.

304
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,818
That's first of all,
really dark.

305
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,220
-Bye. Let's go there. I'm dead.
-Really bad. You're dead?

306
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:36,493
Okay, good night.
Good bye. Bye. I miss you.

307
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:37,321
Good night. Bye. I just died.

308
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:40,192
-I'll miss you. I'll think of you.
-Bye. I died of natural causes.

309
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,127
Okay. I don't know why you're still
talking because you're dead, right?

310
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,429
And you're gonna be
a terrible mother, very selfish.

311
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,164
-Go text mom about it.
-Maybe I will. You know what?

312
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,033
Mom, I ate a tuna
fish sandwich today.

313
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,235
Mom, I had steak for dinner.
Mom, I wiped my butt.

314
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:52,204
-I already left the room.
-Mom, I brushed my teeth.

315
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:53,771
I already left the room.
Your words can't hurt me.

316
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:54,972
I... mom,
I changed my underwear.

317
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:56,408
Should I change
my underwear again,

318
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,310
'cause I think there
was some ovulation in it.

319
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:01,380
-I'm gonna change it a third time.
-Okay... okay...

320
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,948
Come on. We both
went a little too far.

321
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:06,117
Look at me.

322
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,286
Look me in the eye.

323
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:11,389
You were rude and rude.

324
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,158
You were rude.

325
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:14,359
We need to treat
each other with respect,

326
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:15,760
we're all we got.

327
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,929
Who is it?

328
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,164
My gyno.

329
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:22,366
Hello?

330
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,935
Yes.

331
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:24,969
Don't forget to wash roadie.

332
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:29,073
I know. Go.

333
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,909
Hey, Claudia.

334
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:34,145
Yeah.

335
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,888
Okay, but is this actually
a serious thing?

336
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,188
'Cause last time
that I came over,

337
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:47,458
you guys lost
my pee sample.

338
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:49,361
Hey, Joy?

339
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:52,898
When's the last time
I had sex?

340
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,044
My son is my only one.

341
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,946
Claudia had cleaned
our family house

342
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,280
for more than a decade.

343
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:11,884
We'd been there
for the senseless deaths

344
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,119
of three of her family members.

345
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:17,054
She couldn't leave the country
for any of their funerals.

346
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,491
She told my sisters
about mom's drinking.

347
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:22,461
But before anyone intervened,

348
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:28,967
mom moved in with cowboy Lou and
no one ever brought it up again.

349
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,870
And then he
looking at me like...

350
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:35,174
Very bad...
Very mad to me.

351
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,375
He say,
"I don't want it, this kid."

352
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,813
I said, "you don't want it,
but I want my son."

353
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:44,216
You no want to be with us,
the door is open.

354
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,018
-You're out.
-Yeah.

355
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,286
-Lot of women, single mom.
-True.

356
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,988
He don't want my son. He don't
want to give it the last name.

357
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:54,358
I say, "no problem. My son
is gonna have my last name."

358
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:56,127
-No problem.
-What's the difference?

359
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,830
You don't wanna give it?
Okay. Keep it.

360
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,866
Anyway, when you die
you're gonna take it.

361
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:01,900
Who's gonna need it.

362
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,236
Yeah, what do you think?

363
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,604
Well, should we put
one up there?

364
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:08,005
No, no, no.
Because the bigger the cheese,

365
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,342
the more of an aroma
it sends off

366
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,111
and these rats
come sniffing.

367
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:14,546
Yeah, I mean we do,

368
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:17,049
let's kill 'em.
We wanna kill 'em.

369
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,250
You do or you don't.

370
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:22,353
I mean, I charge 120 to
extract a rat or a opossum...

371
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:24,121
All right, yeah.
No, we're gonna do it.

372
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:26,424
-You are?
-Yeah. I think we should, right?

373
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:29,895
How about you give me
your number and I'll call you

374
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,996
and then I'll
have your number.

375
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:33,598
It's always worked
in the past.

376
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,167
Don't fix it
if it's not broke.

377
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,870
-Right, okay.
-Right, right.

378
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,272
I don't have to worry
in case one of you are showering

379
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:42,039
or busy trying stuff on.

380
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,175
-You know what?
-That way we can always...

381
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,611
Let's get
both of yours.

382
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,380
-I'll do it. I'll do it.
-No, no, no.

383
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:49,641
We're gonna put our mom's cell.

384
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:51,383
I think... yeah, mom's
cell is the safest.

385
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,284
You'll get a hold
of her easy. It's fine.

386
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,054
She's a robust,
young, 39...4...

387
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,557
What would you say,
early 40s?

388
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,026
-No, she's in her 50s.
-Okay...

389
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,437
Yeah, but she's healthy.
She's doing good.

390
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:03,127
Yeah, she's great.

391
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,097
-That could work, I could do that.
-She'll be the one...

392
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,164
-Yeah, she'll let you know.
-She'll answer...

393
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:08,500
Yeah, she'll answer
any questions...

394
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:11,202
She's not...
Like tight around the waist?

395
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,505
I'm good, I'm good.

396
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:14,573
That's all I need.

397
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,975
Got a couple visuals.

398
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,079
That was interesting.

399
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:23,314
There's a date
right there for me.

400
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,419
What's mom doing?
Have you texted her yet?

401
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:30,222
Pfft, no. I don't know
what she's doing today.

402
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,957
I think she has
ballet class again.

403
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,558
So you haven't
heard from her then?

404
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,127
No.

405
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,095
You did a a tic after that.

406
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,332
Okay, well,
you have your own weird habits.

407
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,100
I know I do, Elle.
I have to do it.

408
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,668
-It makes me feel good.
-No, you don't have to do it.

409
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,202
You can have self control.

410
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:46,438
Well, we both do it.

411
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,941
It's our OCD.
Can't help it.

412
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:50,275
Okay, well,
your habits are getting worse.

413
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,510
Just saying.

414
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,512
Yours are.

415
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,546
-You're taking long showers again.
-No, I'm not.

416
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,515
Yes, you are.
Because mine are getting cold.

417
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,084
And you're touching windows,
and doorknobs,

418
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:01,252
and fucking curtains and shit.

419
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:02,688
I don't do that any more.

420
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,089
So you're telling me
that you don't touch walls

421
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,291
or shampoo or conditioner.

422
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:08,392
Maybe the shampoo and
conditioner bottles sometimes.

423
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:10,162
Yeah.

424
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,563
-You just did it again.
-Yeah, well, you made me nervous.

425
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,265
Yeah, well,
that's too bad.

426
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:15,499
At least I'm not touching
random shit like this.

427
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,235
What, do you watch me
in the shower, you weirdo?

428
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:19,004
I don't do it
like that either.

429
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,138
I do it like this.

430
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,707
Okay.
That makes sense.

431
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:23,240
Not that you deserve to know.

432
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:27,411
What?

433
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:28,746
Dad texted us.

434
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,182
What did he say?

435
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,616
He wants to bring
Susan on friday.

436
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:33,318
Well, hell no.

437
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,486
This is exactly why we don't
invite him to things.

438
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,455
-Think about mom.
-When mom meets her, she'll be nice.

439
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:39,156
She's nice to everyone.

440
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:40,158
Okay, still,
fuck no.

441
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,526
I agree.

442
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,329
Sorry, okay?
I know, I did it again.

443
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:45,730
Fuck.

444
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:49,266
Okay. Yes. I know.

445
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,534
My gosh.

446
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,336
Stop. It's a problem.

447
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,371
Stop. Don't.

448
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,012
Don't. You'll make me
do it the whole ride.

449
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Shit.
What did I start?

450
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:12,490
We could just have mom do it.

451
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,726
Wait...
Shit, I gotta get...

452
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,496
Really?

453
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:19,097
Smells like piss.

454
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:26,805
Didn't get my keys
on purpose.

455
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:29,274
Joy insisted on taking
all dry cleaning

456
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:31,308
to the commons
in calabasas.

457
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,643
The man who ran the store

458
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:34,780
always complimented
their taste in clothing.

459
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,417
Something Joy refused
to let go of.

460
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:41,319
It can be oddly important,
encouragement.

461
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,488
What's going on here?

462
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:47,225
With the drinking in the
middle of the day on tuesday?

463
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:49,193
I mean, I like it,
don't get me wrong.

464
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:51,530
It's cool.
But it's not like you.

465
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,832
We might as well be honest.

466
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,400
-We are...
-We're depressed.

467
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:56,834
-incredibly depressed.
-So you are sad.

468
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,203
I didn't know if you were
just like partying

469
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,603
or if you're actually sad.

470
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:01,640
Partying in calabasas?
Yeah.

471
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:03,842
No, we're upset.
We're hanging on.

472
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:04,842
This is Dan.

473
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:06,545
This is us upset.

474
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,547
Why, why do you feel...

475
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,714
What face are you doing?

476
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,183
He's one of my favorites.

477
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,186
It's like we're not getting support
when it comes to the record coming out,

478
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:16,654
help with this film
we wanna get made.

479
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:17,711
They don't want us to tour,
they want us to be here...

480
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:18,223
They don't want us to tour.

481
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:19,791
Auditioning for horrible
little slasher films.

482
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:22,526
Where you die naked
in a really weird scene.

483
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,696
-Like literally, shit like that.
-It's great... yeah...

484
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,497
-It's like...
-Okay, well let me ask you this.

485
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:27,698
You should've listened
to the audition

486
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,134
that we had to run
the other day

487
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,435
for a movie
called "the divide."

488
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:31,669
-It was appalling.
-It was appalling.

489
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,305
And this is like
a movie that literally

490
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,540
they would give their
left arm for us to book.

491
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:38,276
The den is a dark place.
I never wanna go back.

492
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,680
I can't believe
you really did fall.

493
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,850
What was captivity like?

494
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:48,820
I don't wanna go into it.

495
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:51,622
But Jessup,
he lost his arm.

496
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:53,792
And Jonah,

497
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,459
he has no leg...

498
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:57,329
Legs.

499
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,870
Those are always
the first to go.

500
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,509
That boy loved to climb.

501
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,546
Let me ask you,

502
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,384
what is your ultimate goal
would you say?

503
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,486
Like what if you had to tell
somebody in five to ten years

504
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,390
this is where I wanna be,
what is that?

505
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:29,860
I wanna be super legit.

506
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,729
For sure.
But can we like...

507
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,165
Narrow that down
a little bit.

508
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,533
Be more specific.

509
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:36,735
That's definitely...
Yeah, that's a wide...

510
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,603
I think just respected.

511
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:42,174
I wanna be the greatest
comedic actress of my time.

512
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,310
Of like, my age.

513
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:46,811
Well, shit.

514
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:48,246
I'll cheers to that.

515
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:49,613
Not something
I've never heard before

516
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:50,782
-but sure, I liked it.
-But you know what?

517
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:51,815
That, that's totally possible.

518
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,952
You could do that.

519
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,188
It's just about setting the
intention and moving towards it.

520
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,522
But people also don't really
have trust in women

521
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:00,391
-being able to make movies either.
-Right.

522
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,394
So that's, I think,
maybe the biggest part.

523
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,961
Honestly, I should've
been born with a dick.

524
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,115
-So we wanna be men.
-We'd be a lot happier.

525
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:07,232
We wanna be men.
That's what we wanna be.

526
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,434
-We missed you, Dan.
-I missed you guys.

527
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:13,838
You know what we need, is we
need a Dan, Elle, and Joy hang.

528
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:15,607
-A little smoky-smoke time.
-For sure.

529
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,908
-In your bed.
-Absolutely.

530
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,309
-With some chips.
-I miss that.

531
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:19,611
-Chip bed!
-Chip bed!

532
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:21,246
Then we'd smoke
and get the munchies

533
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:23,247
and the little chips
would be everywhere.

534
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,783
And the chips would... you guys
always thought that was weird.

535
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:27,552
It's strange. It was
abnormally crumb heavy.

536
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:29,453
It was a lot of crumbs.
Heavy on the crumbs.

537
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:32,323
It was almost kinda like you just
took the bag and just went...

538
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,559
It was almost... it's nice
to lay on a bed of crumbs.

539
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,695
There's almost
an erotic quality to it.

540
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,362
Does this affect women when you try
to bring them over to your house

541
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:39,798
-and they notice it too?
-What, all the chips? No.

542
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,265
Do they ever like get
in there and go like,

543
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:42,700
-"it hurts."
-A little crunchy.

544
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,436
Most girls like it.
It's intriguing.

545
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:45,970
You know, they don't know
what they're feeling.

546
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,505
It's a little bit of pain.
A little bit of pleasure.

547
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:49,006
They're like is...

548
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,743
Is that a chip in my ass or...

549
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:53,945
That's a chip in your ass, baby.

550
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:56,380
And I'ma get it.

551
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:57,815
I eat that chip.

552
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:02,286
No. No.

553
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,855
Is that a
tortilla or is that a...

554
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,256
Is that a...
Is that a...

555
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,361
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

556
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:11,695
I'm just saying,
I know you got cute girls

557
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:13,832
that you could
throw my way.

558
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:15,699
-It won't come to that.
-No, we're not doing that.

559
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,969
Anyway...

560
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,538
I'm gonna hook up
with all your friends.

561
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:22,874
-You're a jerk.
-Whether you like it or not,

562
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:24,743
I'm gonna kiss
all your friends.

563
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:26,443
-You're already bad enough with us.
-How many female friends

564
00:22:26,476 --> 00:22:27,579
-have you made out with?
-Since when?

565
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:28,679
-Since...
-In my life?

566
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:30,649
I don't know,
since chip bed.

567
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:31,665
What?

568
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,618
We kissed that night.
You don't remember?

569
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:36,353
What are you
talking about?

570
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:37,956
What are you talking about?

571
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:39,757
What are you talking about
that I'm talking about?

572
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,893
Have you... did you...
Have you told her that?

573
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:43,962
Or was that first... no,
it's coming out now I'm sorry.

574
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,664
We maybe...

575
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,832
-Had sex? What the fuck?
-No.

576
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:50,792
Got fingered with a chip?
I mean, what are you...

577
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:51,769
My gosh!

578
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,772
What? No.
We... we made out.

579
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,840
We had a little make-out
session on the chip bed.

580
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:58,309
-When you were asleep.
-Well yeah, I mean, it was years ago.

581
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:00,378
-It was like for a second...
-how many Dan?

582
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,580
-How many have you kissed?
-Why are you doing this?

583
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:04,448
-It's getting weird now.
-How many girls?

584
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:06,351
-It is...
-Just stop. Stop yourself.

585
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:10,020
You're getting a little weird.
How is your mom?

586
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:12,390
Mama Lynn.
It's been too long.

587
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:17,428
-It's good.
-She's good.

588
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,428
She's good. Thanks again.

589
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:20,364
That was the least
convincing, "she's great."

590
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,634
-She is dating a guy named, cowboy Lou.
-You know what, she's happy.

591
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,601
-And he's not a cowboy.
-Yeah...

592
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:26,904
He like works
at a winery, I think.

593
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,540
She's dating a cowboy that
works at a... that's cool.

594
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,341
They're living together.

595
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,108
-They're literally living together.
-She's known him for two weeks.

596
00:23:31,141 --> 00:23:32,409
-Two weeks and they're living together?
-Yeah.

597
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:34,645
Is she happy?

598
00:23:34,678 --> 00:23:35,579
She's really happy.

599
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,381
Well, then that's all
that matters, right?

600
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,384
I don't know.

601
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:05,777
Now bring it back.
Bring it back.

602
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:07,913
Yeah.

603
00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:12,683
Can you please not
get on the freeway?

604
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,060
Go up the hill
to our old house.

605
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,219
Why?

606
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,621
'Cause I wanna be there
for memory purposes.

607
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:19,624
What? You're so weird.
And no.

608
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:21,092
You have to get past
the gate, dummy.

609
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:22,626
You think they're
gonna forget us?

610
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:23,995
Pervert Sam is probably
still working there,

611
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,729
he'll let us in.

612
00:24:28,064 --> 00:24:30,501
-I'm serious.
-I wanna hop the fence and take a swim.

613
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:32,836
It'll feel adventurous,
and nice.

614
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,572
I wanna do it.
They're not in town right now.

615
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:36,841
They're in France in June.
You know that.

616
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:37,736
Yeah, but there's
probably somebody

617
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:38,742
there that's waiting,
watching the house.

618
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:40,978
There's no way they have
someone there that's waiting.

619
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,679
No way.
We can easily do this.

620
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,649
We talk about being spontaneous
all the fucking time.

621
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:46,016
And today
I wanna be spontaneous.

622
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,787
I wanna sit there
and feel like a kid.

623
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,588
Yeah...
I miss being a kid.

624
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:52,023
'Kay. This roundabout,
turn around.

625
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:55,192
-Fine.
-I knew that would work.

626
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:58,103
Do I have to show some
cleavage or something?

627
00:24:58,104 --> 00:24:59,063
Yep.

628
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:02,433
-That's high-collared.
-Shit.

629
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,534
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you're bait.

630
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,002
-Hi, hey.
-Hi, Sam.

631
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:06,837
-Hey.
-Yeah. It's so good to see you.

632
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:08,806
-How are you?
-Very nice to see you too. Go on in.

633
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:14,111
-I think we should do it now.
-Well, if we just... right now?

634
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:17,047
Yes, today.
We keep fucking putting it off.

635
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:20,819
My sisters found out our father
was cheating before our mom did.

636
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:22,219
Waiting for how much longer?

637
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:24,054
I don't know,
it's already been three weeks.

638
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:26,157
It was agonizing watching
them decide when to tell her.

639
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,794
It's frustrating.

640
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:32,630
Well, I'm sorry,
it's not the right time.

641
00:25:32,662 --> 00:25:34,031
-When is the right time?
-In a half hour.

642
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:37,534
Okay...

643
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,670
I was more upset that they
had to tell her

644
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,975
than that he had done it
in the first place.

645
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:46,510
You know,

646
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,746
the worst part is that...

647
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,118
My dad can really be
a wonderful person.

648
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,920
Always when you
least expect.

649
00:25:57,955 --> 00:25:59,890
Truly wonderful.

650
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:01,859
What if she just
finds out on her own?

651
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:03,627
No.

652
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,129
No, I'm saying, what if she
just fucking figures it out

653
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:06,630
because he starts to become
more lazy about it.

654
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,677
-Ready?
-Yep.

655
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:20,678
-Okay, on the count of three.
-Okay.

656
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,582
One... two...

657
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:25,816
Three!

658
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:29,714
It's too cold out
when you're holding it under.

659
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:31,917
The game's not the same.

660
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:39,223
A lot of people say my sisters
need to let go of the past

661
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:43,361
but I can see why
they don't want to.

662
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:46,130
This house is amazing.

663
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:52,603
-Elle?
-Yeah?

664
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,639
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. Are you?

665
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:56,740
-You with me?
-Yeah.

666
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,382
Shit, life was so much easier
when we lived here.

667
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:06,184
Yeah, no kidding.

668
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,819
You never realize it
in the moment, do you?

669
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:09,853
Never.

670
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:11,923
It's like, "mom, can you
make me a sandwich.

671
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,195
Dad, can you
wash my car?"

672
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,667
I just wanna be
a kid again.

673
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:24,101
No kidding.

674
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,071
It's the best.

675
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:29,373
It really is.

676
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,943
I want that feeling again,
you know?

677
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,812
It's gone. It's not
coming back anytime soon.

678
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:36,113
Shit.

679
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,351
When we have kids though,
we'll get it back.

680
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:43,353
And we'll live vicariously
through them.

681
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:47,325
Yeah...

682
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,232
I just wanna go back.

683
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,211
And all of a sudden, bam.

684
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:10,313
Our mom taught my sisters
how to train squirrels

685
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:13,016
but never had
a well-trained dog.

686
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,053
She arrived for flights
hours in advance.

687
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:19,122
She never packed sexy panties
on her trips with our dad.

688
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:23,194
She punished Joy for intentionally
stripping her vocal cords at school.

689
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:26,063
She encouraged her girls
to bring friends over

690
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:29,733
but never respected parents
who didn't introduce themselves.

691
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:33,871
She had my sisters stop eating
fast food at 18 and 16.

692
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:38,108
She loved to cook, but never
taught my sisters how.

693
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:40,711
Maybe she wanted
to be needed.

694
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:44,282
Gardening was a therapy that she
guilted them for not helping with.

695
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,820
She realized
when my sisters moved out

696
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:52,090
that she had
almost no friends.

697
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:04,502
-excuse me?
-Hi.

698
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:06,204
Are you guys supposed
to be here?

699
00:30:49,345 --> 00:30:51,082
Don't you think it's kinda weird

700
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:54,217
that we go all the way
to calabasas for dry cleaning?

701
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:56,788
No, I like going
to the commons, it's sweet.

702
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,157
Yeah, we should probably find a
new place that's like closer.

703
00:31:06,362 --> 00:31:07,966
I need to stop.

704
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:23,014
Hey, if I tell you something,
do you promise not to tell mom?

705
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:23,014
It kinda depends on what it is.

706
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:24,582
No, you just have to agree that
you're not going to tell mom.

707
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:26,284
Because this is
between you and I

708
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:29,853
and it's something private.
So... just say that.

709
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,223
I don't like that.

710
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:34,324
No, it's not a big deal,
just promise me

711
00:31:34,358 --> 00:31:35,592
just to stay calm
and not freak out

712
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,228
-and not tell mom.
-No, I won't.

713
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:40,865
Can we stop up here, please?

714
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,132
Hold on, hold on.

715
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,568
I just gotta
catch my breath.

716
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,904
The fuck?

717
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:49,540
-You're out of shape.
-Gotta do more cardio.

718
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:51,376
Yeah, no kidding.

719
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:58,248
Okay, I need you to come
with me to the gyno tomorrow

720
00:31:58,282 --> 00:32:00,385
because they think
I have cervical cancer.

721
00:32:02,585 --> 00:32:03,487
Cancer?

722
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,973
Elle always ordered
what Joy did at restaurants.

723
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:25,976
Even though Joy was younger,
she was the first to kiss a boy,

724
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:29,146
first to have her period,
first to lose her virginity.

725
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,515
My sisters
truly believed

726
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:36,419
angels watched
over them as children.

727
00:32:36,453 --> 00:32:38,423
I'm not sure
they still do.

728
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:44,060
That's cute.

729
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:48,632
-Right? Farewell, ladies.
-Yeah.

730
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,434
Seeing Dan made me think

731
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:54,505
that I haven't been
on a date in ten months.

732
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:58,909
-Come here.
-Yeah.

733
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,250
That's him on set.
He booked a fucking movie.

734
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:08,619
-With her?
-Yeah!

735
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:10,453
I guarantee
it's a small role.

736
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:12,689
Has to be.
Not listed in the trades.

737
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:14,191
No fan sites are
listing about it.

738
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:15,993
No blogs.

739
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,594
-Okay, you did your research.
-He looks horrible there.

740
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,097
That's bad. Who would part
their hair like that?

741
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,332
I like it,
it's kinda messy.

742
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,269
That's bad,
the teeth are really bad there.

743
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:27,071
Well, I think he kind of like
got them fixed a little bit.

744
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:28,471
He got caps.

745
00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:31,141
No, I don't think so.
I think that's him.

746
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:31,960
They look like dentures.

747
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:34,044
No, I think he just got
them like shaved a little.

748
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:34,620
Shaved?

749
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,247
Yeah, you know how
they just even them out.

750
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,715
-They look bigger.
-No, it looks cute.

751
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:40,150
Just fucking agree with me
like I want you to.

752
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,485
I'm just being real with
you, bro. He looks good.

753
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:43,219
Fuck. No.
Most of these are bad.

754
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:44,455
They're probably dating.

755
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:46,090
They could be.

756
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:47,457
No, they're definitely dating.
You can tell.

757
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,292
-They have like a thing.
-Shut up.

758
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:51,495
-Are you a little jealous?
-I know what you're doing.

759
00:33:51,527 --> 00:33:53,029
"They're dating."

760
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:54,532
-Yeah?
-See? That one's ugly.

761
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:55,666
He looks awesome.

762
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:57,234
-Say that one's bad.
-Hot.

763
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,237
Work with me.

764
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:03,674
Fine. He looks okay
in some of these.

765
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:05,575
Don't be bitter.
There, there.

766
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:07,144
No, I'm over it anyway.

767
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:08,611
That's what we all say.

768
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:11,315
Over it enough
to look it up.

769
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:18,421
Do I look good?

770
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:20,690
-I feel round.
-What do you mean?

771
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:22,994
My butt. It's full.

772
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:24,260
It likes to come out.

773
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:26,997
Dudes like that.

774
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,299
Yeah...

775
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:31,202
I shouldn't have
canceled Jerry.

776
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,635
I feel like shit.

777
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:34,337
Cancelling Jerry
for one session

778
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,006
is not gonna change
your entire body.

779
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:38,008
Hold on, though.
If you're saying that,

780
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,610
that means you kind
of agree.

781
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,111
-So I am. I look bigger.
-No, no, no, no, no.

782
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:42,380
I'm not.
No, I'm not.

783
00:34:42,412 --> 00:34:44,347
I mean, what,
how much do you weigh?

784
00:34:44,381 --> 00:34:46,083
I'm like five pounds
over what I usually am.

785
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:49,052
That's bad?

786
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,354
no.

787
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:54,025
That was a bad reaction.

788
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:55,592
-Sorry.
-It's muscle.

789
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,428
Please.
I hate when people say that.

790
00:34:57,461 --> 00:34:59,263
I know, I hate it too
but it's kinda true.

791
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:00,564
That your butt is muscle.

792
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:05,336
No, that muscle
adds pounds.

793
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,137
So that's
most of it, I guess.

794
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,341
-I think you look great, more or less.
-"More or less?"

795
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,109
Actually we would probably
create the ultimate human being.

796
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:14,378
The perfect human being!
Yeah.

797
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,514
Visually it would have
our best attributes.

798
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:18,314
My eye shape
with your lashes,

799
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:20,784
with my lips,
with my teeth,

800
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,486
with your nose,

801
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:25,122
with your hair...

802
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:28,825
-I like that.
-With your butt.

803
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:31,094
Willow,
what do you think?

804
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,664
I think I know what she's
been thinking about.

805
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:37,834
She's been thinking about you
telling mom about your tests.

806
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:40,770
She told me.

807
00:35:40,803 --> 00:35:44,575
"Elle, will you please
tell mommy about your testings."

808
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:47,311
She needs to know.
She really does.

809
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:48,746
And I feel like
if she comes

810
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:50,280
before the party
really gets going...

811
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,682
Joy, we're not telling mom
about my test.

812
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:52,749
-Really?
-No.

813
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:54,451
We're not gonna
tell her.

814
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,486
Joy, we're waiting
until she's here at the house

815
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,822
and by the way, she's gonna
be late like she always is.

816
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,424
No, no, no.
Tell her here at the party.

817
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:02,445
Set aside, go to another
room, and explain it to her.

818
00:36:02,446 --> 00:36:04,428
Yeah, except then
she'll start drinking,

819
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:05,696
and she'll accidentally say
something to one of our friends

820
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:07,665
'cause she's like drunk
and having fun.

821
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:09,566
And she thinks
it's funny to say something.

822
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,434
I'm sorry,
I'm not doing that.

823
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:12,703
I don't know why you're so weird
about me having to tell her.

824
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,504
I know...
I don't...

825
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:16,873
Because you keep saying saturday
and that's the day we leave.

826
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,609
I mean, yeah,
I'll text her at the airport.

827
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:21,544
We can't just send you
on the road if there's an issue.

828
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:23,346
I don't think
the news is gonna be bad,

829
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,849
I'm just saying we should
be ready to tell mom soon.

830
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:26,650
Okay, well, I'm not...
I'm not telling mom, period.

831
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:28,818
You tell her every single
little detail about your life

832
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:30,354
and I don't have to do
the exact same thing too.

833
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:31,722
We're two
different people.

834
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:34,291
So don't say anything
until we know for sure.

835
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:40,832
Sorry.

836
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:52,543
She's mad at me.

837
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,736
The only thing Elle
really loved about the house

838
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:22,805
was the view of the canyon
from her bed.

839
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:27,378
It was a simple view
that you grew to love.

840
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,447
You can grow
to love almost anything.

841
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,150
It's god's gift.

842
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:38,588
Are you sad 'cause
your mommies fight?

843
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:42,826
Are you sad
because your mommies fight?

844
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,604
I'm sorry.

845
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:56,474
It's sad...

846
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,352
Joy wanted
Elle to demonstrate repeatedly

847
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:09,954
how much
she needed her.

848
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:12,590
Elle wanted Joy
not to need her so much.

849
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,639
-Elle, look at this.
-Yeah?

850
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:31,407
-What?
-It's like a big dick.

851
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:34,778
-What?
-Look it.

852
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,783
I can't find the power...
Shit!

853
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,885
We're good.

854
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:45,589
Yes! Yes!
Come to mama.

855
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,791
You're gonna fall.

856
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:50,561
-The gardeners are fired.
-No shit.

857
00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:52,396
-Text them.
-I can't do that. It's rude.

858
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:53,530
Let's ask mom
what we should do.

859
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:55,532
Joy, we text mom
about everything

860
00:38:55,564 --> 00:38:56,800
about 500 times a day.

861
00:38:56,832 --> 00:38:58,269
I think we can
handle this on our own.

862
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,637
She's not gonna be
around forever

863
00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:01,338
-for us to ask her questions.
-All right.

864
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:03,606
I'm sick of you fucking saying
things like that.

865
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,941
-Really?
-Yes, it's rude.

866
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:06,309
Because if I was her,

867
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:07,778
I would be super annoyed
with you.

868
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:09,579
-Really?
-Yeah, I'd fucking hate it.

869
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,448
How's this for annoying?

870
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:16,019
-Joy. Joy stop.
-Yeah, you like that?

871
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:17,453
Are you
out of your mind?

872
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:19,389
-That good?
-Joy, stop!

873
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,890
Good, you feel good?
You feel blown?

874
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:21,958
Stop.

875
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:26,030
You are a very disturbed
young woman.

876
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,997
Hey, John!

877
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,663
Did the gardeners
come for you?

878
00:39:29,664 --> 00:39:31,835
Yeah, I think so.
What happened to your pants?

879
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,469
We're good, we're
gonna get rid of them.

880
00:39:33,503 --> 00:39:36,039
You're in your underwear,
you freak.

881
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:38,441
-He's gay.
-So he's gay?

882
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:40,810
Okay, so that means it's fine
for you to be in your underwear?

883
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:42,679
Next time
terminix comes over,

884
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,615
why don't you just greet him
at the door in your underwear.

885
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,450
Ernie's different.

886
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:50,653
I'm a little
worried sometimes.

887
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:53,790
About what?
Me? The gyno stuff?

888
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:55,959
No, no, no, no.
I think you're gonna be fine.

889
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:58,696
-Thanks.
-I do.

890
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,931
I've been praying
about it.

891
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:03,733
I worry about mom.
Just her and cowboy Lou.

892
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,569
Like she tends to just
disappear and do her own thing.

893
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:07,738
-Yeah.
-I don't wanna lose her.

894
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:09,807
I feel like we've
already lost dad

895
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,044
and it's kinda redundant
and horrible if we lose both.

896
00:40:17,546 --> 00:40:19,983
We're not
gonna lose mom.

897
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:32,363
We are doing the dance.

898
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,466
This is my cocktail.

899
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:40,838
My girl drinks heavy.

900
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,542
I... saw you sitting
at the bar.

901
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:47,410
And wanted you
to dance with me.

902
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:49,579
Do I know you?

903
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,082
-Gregory.
-Gregory?

904
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:54,352
-Pleasure. Janet.
-Pleasure.

905
00:40:57,686 --> 00:41:00,556
That was too masculine,
I shouldn't do that move.

906
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,626
Yeah.

907
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:04,528
Shall we set down
our drinks?

908
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:15,405
What are you doing later?

909
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,908
-I'm going to Jimmy's bar?
-Jimmy's bar?

910
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:20,611
Yeah. You never heard of it?
I love that place.

911
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,513
My tits are shaking.

912
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,914
Does that ever
happen to you?

913
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:26,117
Only on the weekends
when I let 'em loose.

914
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:34,023
You're the guy,
you can't have boobs.

915
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:36,593
Yes, guys sometimes
have man titties.

916
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:38,528
-So Gregory's out of shape?
-Yes.

917
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:40,063
-All right.
-He's a little thick in the waist.

918
00:41:40,095 --> 00:41:42,099
I know, it's good to know
for our story.

919
00:41:42,131 --> 00:41:43,934
Gregory,
you work out often?

920
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:45,735
No, I just
drink whiskey.

921
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,705
I feel like you look
a little soft.

922
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,575
Sorry, that's rude,
we just met.

923
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,197
-Hey, Elle?
-Yeah.

924
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:49,867
You're killing me up here with the
nail Polish fumes and the smoke.

925
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,901
Why are you doing this?

926
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:53,603
I'm sorry. I'm stressed and I
want my nails to look nice.

927
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:56,706
We're getting ready for a party
and our mother is here.

928
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,742
Hold on! We're coming down.

929
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:00,811
-Can you get the gate?
-She always does this. She has a key.

930
00:43:00,843 --> 00:43:02,211
-Please get the gate.
-I don't have a damn key.

931
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:04,213
-Mom, use your key.
-Mom, we're trying to get ready.

932
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:05,916
We gave you two keys.

933
00:43:05,948 --> 00:43:08,584
I don't have
a key with me.

934
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:09,820
There's an extra key
in that pot.

935
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:11,621
We can't come down
right now.

936
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,090
I want somebody to come down
and let me in.

937
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:14,791
No, this is really rude.
I just drove all the way...

938
00:43:14,823 --> 00:43:16,994
If you face the gate
to your left, there's a pot.

939
00:43:17,026 --> 00:43:19,862
And in the pot there's a little hose
head that looks like it's fake.

940
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:22,164
I don't wanna have to dig
through it and look for it.

941
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:22,875
I just... we're here...

942
00:43:22,876 --> 00:43:24,233
Okay, all right, all
right, all right, all right.

943
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:26,469
Just let me... Joy,
what is wrong with you?

944
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,571
I'm coming down.

945
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:28,639
She's been emotional.

946
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:30,006
Will you shut up, please?

947
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,874
What? You have.
And it was dumb to invite dad.

948
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:34,911
No, I'm sorry I like sharing
things with my family.

949
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,580
Like cancer tests.

950
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:38,081
Cancer tests?

951
00:43:38,113 --> 00:43:40,117
Elle had a test this week
for cervical cancer.

952
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,651
They were worried
they found something.

953
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:43,719
It's nothing.
It's nothing. They just...

954
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:45,889
They wanna make sure that
it's an abnormal test result.

955
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:47,023
It was a follow up.

956
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,225
How do you not
tell me this?

957
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,960
Thanks for keeping
a secret, Joy.

958
00:43:49,992 --> 00:43:52,328
I'm sorry, I don't like secrets
when it comes to family.

959
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:53,764
This is mom, okay?
No. Had to.

960
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:54,865
Well, she wants
to have her own life.

961
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,033
So I'm letting
her have it.

962
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,267
Well, Elle,
that's different.

963
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,135
-That is completely unfair.
-Yeah.

964
00:43:59,168 --> 00:44:01,137
Well, you were the one that
said we come to you too much.

965
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,073
And you want this new era where
you're living your own life,

966
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:04,707
so there you go.

967
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,175
It's completely reasonable
that your mom would want

968
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:08,879
to make her own friends
and go on trips

969
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:12,282
and take care
of the things in her life.

970
00:44:12,314 --> 00:44:15,985
My mom died when she was ten
years older than I am right now.

971
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:18,755
Ten years,
I have to live those ten years

972
00:44:18,787 --> 00:44:20,023
as fully as I can.

973
00:44:20,055 --> 00:44:22,592
And if that means,
horses and hiking

974
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,794
and spending time
with my lover,

975
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,861
then that's what
I need to do.

976
00:44:25,894 --> 00:44:27,898
But that doesn't mean I'm not
concerned if you're in a hospital.

977
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,700
Mom, you're not gonna die
in ten years from now.

978
00:44:30,733 --> 00:44:32,768
That's so young. How can you
say something like that?

979
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:34,171
And I'm not
in a hospital.

980
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,639
And this lover of yours

981
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:37,073
you've known
for two weeks.

982
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:38,275
-What did they say?
-That's true.

983
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:40,677
They don't know.
I'll find out tomorrow.

984
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:42,278
Don't get
carried away, god.

985
00:44:42,311 --> 00:44:44,046
-Told her, she should tell you.
-Shut up, Joy.

986
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,182
Okay.

987
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:48,384
My heart did start to beat a little
too fast there for a minute.

988
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:49,986
Yeah. Mine too.

989
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:53,389
Now, Elle's right.
We shouldn't get worried.

990
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:56,193
Until we actually know that there's
something to be worried about.

991
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,928
Joy's worried you're
moving too fast with Lou.

992
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:00,997
We're getting married.

993
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,765
I know it,
he's the one.

994
00:45:02,798 --> 00:45:05,001
I am totally in love.

995
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,971
-Mom...
-Okay, that's great mom...

996
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:10,339
But you've known this guy
for two weeks.

997
00:45:10,372 --> 00:45:12,775
-Two weeks.
-Okay. And his name is Lou.

998
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:14,745
-Say it out loud, "Lou."
-"Lou."

999
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,014
I know, I know.
I get it.

1000
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:20,050
I told him, if I'm gonna take your last
name, you have to change your first.

1001
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:21,785
Okay. Wait. Hold on.

1002
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:23,285
You're talking
about name changes

1003
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:24,353
and marriage already.

1004
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:26,189
What is going on?

1005
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:29,092
If you guys could hear the
messages he leaves for me.

1006
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:31,961
Your father isn't even capable
of kindness like this.

1007
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:34,263
I know. We love
that Lou is sweet to you.

1008
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:36,198
Mom, but we've
also noticed

1009
00:45:36,231 --> 00:45:38,200
you're drinking
a lot more with him.

1010
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,436
Stop it. I hardly drink
at all with him.

1011
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,839
No, no, no, no. No drinking
tonight. It's not happening.

1012
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:44,174
You could say it
a little nicer.

1013
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:46,342
Maybe I'll just bust out
the vaporizer.

1014
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,278
Okay, see this is why
you have to be real with her.

1015
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:49,345
-Don't... definitely don't do that.
-Or she doesn't listen.

1016
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:51,781
I'm not drinking tonight.

1017
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:53,749
Okay, just...
Just protect yourself.

1018
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:55,351
That's all I'm saying.

1019
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,419
Because who knows if all the
things he's telling you

1020
00:45:56,452 --> 00:45:58,255
end up actually
being true, mom.

1021
00:45:58,287 --> 00:45:59,889
Yeah, look at Syd. I didn't
know his issues right away.

1022
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,058
Still invited
him tonight.

1023
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,425
I still have
feelings for him.

1024
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:03,897
-You invited Reed.
-Yeah, has no issues.

1025
00:46:03,898 --> 00:46:04,657
He's poor.

1026
00:46:04,658 --> 00:46:06,363
That is not why I
broke up with him, Joy.

1027
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,765
You both like having
a man around.

1028
00:46:08,798 --> 00:46:10,066
That's okay.
It's normal.

1029
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:11,735
Yeah, thank you.
Very normal.

1030
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:15,271
Just don't fall
into bad habits.

1031
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,875
Okay. Well let's agree to be cautious
with all men. How about that?

1032
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:20,376
Yeah, but with Lou
I know...

1033
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,980
I mean,
it's as clear as...

1034
00:46:24,012 --> 00:46:27,016
It's just love.
I know he's younger.

1035
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,720
I mean, he is.
But not really.

1036
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,354
I met his friends
and I look, you know,

1037
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,756
pretty much as young as
they do for the most part.

1038
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:36,192
Take your time, mom.
Just move slow.

1039
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,894
'Cause right now, it's like
you're hanging out with him

1040
00:46:38,927 --> 00:46:40,396
and we feel like
we're kinda losing you.

1041
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,366
And you're on your own.
And you don't call us as much.

1042
00:46:43,398 --> 00:46:45,067
Okay, mom.
That's all we're saying.

1043
00:46:45,101 --> 00:46:46,970
But this is the kind of love
I've been waiting for.

1044
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:48,905
And he treats me so well.

1045
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:51,173
Okay, well, that's great.
We're really happy for you.

1046
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:52,742
But we're just saying,

1047
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,978
that you don't know him
after just two weeks.

1048
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:55,619
No, you don't.

1049
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,447
So when you've known him
more, you can say that.

1050
00:46:57,479 --> 00:47:00,349
And stop talking about marriage.
It's not allowed. Okay?

1051
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:01,351
I mean, you obviously didn't
know dad well enough.

1052
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:03,320
So I can't trust you.

1053
00:47:03,352 --> 00:47:06,822
And that's the point. This is
already completely different.

1054
00:47:06,856 --> 00:47:09,226
And while we're there,

1055
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:10,827
he was a great dad
to you guys.

1056
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,496
He gave you
a great childhood.

1057
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:15,297
It was good. It was good
when we were little.

1058
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:17,267
Yeah, just that fun thing,
he just lost that.

1059
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,903
-Whatever that thing was. Lost that.
-Completely.

1060
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:21,048
Did he ever have it?

1061
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:23,273
Yeah. No. He was
actually kind of adorable.

1062
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,278
All I'm saying is, if you're
gonna get married again,

1063
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:30,013
you better do it
the right way.

1064
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:34,284
I knew what I was getting.

1065
00:47:34,316 --> 00:47:36,052
But... did you really?

1066
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:37,987
'Cause then you should've
just gotten an annulment.

1067
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:45,128
Yeah, I think I did.

1068
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,363
You knew?

1069
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:49,398
I think I did.

1070
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:54,437
Look what
came out of it.

1071
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:58,241
How could I
possibly regret that?

1072
00:47:58,273 --> 00:48:00,376
I guess, but you could've still
had really awesome children

1073
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,578
with some other dude.

1074
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,246
Yeah, but they wouldn't
be you guys.

1075
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:04,514
-True. But you don't know.
-You don't know that.

1076
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:05,849
-You would never know.
-No regrets.

1077
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:07,983
-You would never know...
-no regrets.

1078
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:09,452
-You would never know...
-never any regrets.

1079
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:12,488
-Shut up.
-I love you, mama.

1080
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:15,025
No regrets.

1081
00:48:15,057 --> 00:48:18,027
I love you, baby.

1082
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,396
So what are you guys
wearing tonight?

1083
00:48:19,428 --> 00:48:21,831
We are wearing
really cute dresses.

1084
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,099
They're vintage.

1085
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:25,034
And mine looks
kinda like a little...

1086
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,204
Like a little sailor girl.
It's really cute.

1087
00:48:27,236 --> 00:48:30,072
Adorable.
And what about Joy?

1088
00:48:30,106 --> 00:48:33,343
Hers is... Like a heart
shaped little dress,

1089
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:36,345
that is gray and has like
a little shift bottom.

1090
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:38,480
Darlings, darling girls.

1091
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:39,916
You requested some tea.

1092
00:48:39,948 --> 00:48:42,084
Is it tea time?
Is it about that time?

1093
00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:44,186
All right, this is what dad
would always do.

1094
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,322
He'd come in
as Rogers, right?

1095
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:46,555
He'd play
this really really

1096
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:49,058
kind of frothy english
character.

1097
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,182
And he had a horrible
accent and we were

1098
00:48:50,183 --> 00:48:51,193
these two little
girls he worked for.

1099
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:53,330
And he'd come down
and he'd go,

1100
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:56,032
"girls, it's time for tea. Would
you like a little tea before bed?"

1101
00:48:56,064 --> 00:48:57,066
And then he'd trip,
of course.

1102
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:58,400
And then
we would be like,

1103
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:00,035
"Rogers, you can't trip
all over our things.

1104
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:01,371
This is
a very upscale bedroom.

1105
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:02,872
You're working
for two princesses.

1106
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:04,206
Don't get our things wet."

1107
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,976
And so he'd come on the bed
and he'd go,

1108
00:49:06,008 --> 00:49:07,309
"I'm so sorry. Rogers has
just had a horrible day.

1109
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:09,613
Very busy in the kitchen."

1110
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,514
And he'd come sit down and he'd show us
his little array of different flavors.

1111
00:49:11,546 --> 00:49:14,316
He'd go, "there's one
that's hibiscus, hydrangea.

1112
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:18,287
There's a Berry bliss
and a mandarin orange flavor.

1113
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,288
Which one
are you feeling?

1114
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:20,957
And we'd pick a flavor.

1115
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,225
And of course we'd have
to fake that flavor and go,

1116
00:49:22,258 --> 00:49:23,593
"it's so good.

1117
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:25,495
Rogers.
We love when you make us tea."

1118
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:27,430
And he'd sit there and we'd kind
of talk about our days

1119
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:29,499
just, I don't know,
school or just hanging out.

1120
00:49:29,532 --> 00:49:30,901
Or what we were up to.

1121
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,269
And then at the end,
he would go,

1122
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,403
"all right,
well, Rogers is off the clock.

1123
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:34,905
It's been a very busy day.

1124
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,171
My two little princesses
fall asleep now."

1125
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:37,606
And he'd kind of walk
out of the room

1126
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:40,242
and gather up his tea set
and trip on the way out.

1127
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:41,912
And we'd go, "Rogers, you're
getting our things wet."

1128
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,345
He'd go, "I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.

1129
00:49:43,378 --> 00:49:45,948
Rogers is a very clumsy man.
Thank you. Sorry."

1130
00:49:45,981 --> 00:49:47,983
And he'd do that thing
where he pulls his head back.

1131
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:49,452
"Sorry.
I'm being pulled.

1132
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:51,320
I'm being summoned
by my housekeeper."

1133
00:49:54,122 --> 00:49:55,691
-Man.
-And that's it, that's my story.

1134
00:49:55,724 --> 00:49:57,627
I wish Rogers was real.

1135
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:28,124
You do know like
two or three people

1136
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:30,293
are gonna show up
tonight, right?

1137
00:50:30,325 --> 00:50:33,162
Yeah... yep.

1138
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:37,500
Foti fotat.

1139
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:48,711
Foti fotat.

1140
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,281
-That was beautiful.
-That's nice, that's nice.

1141
00:51:25,314 --> 00:51:27,350
-I love it. Don't stop.
-Nice, nice, nice.

1142
00:51:27,383 --> 00:51:28,785
-So cool.
-So pretty, Brian.

1143
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:30,285
Wonderful.

1144
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:33,188
So I was thinking
about, "boy" and

1145
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,624
I'm not sure that we should
go with the intro first.

1146
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:38,394
I think we should try
to pick up from the verse.

1147
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:39,795
-Okay.
-Where we just start with the verse.

1148
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:42,032
-Yeah. Instead of just going...
-Right on the vocal.

1149
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:43,700
Yeah, I think it
kind of hits harder.

1150
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:44,767
A little bit
more emotion.

1151
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,268
-Okay, cool.
-Now...

1152
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:49,171
So one, two, three, four.

1153
00:51:56,244 --> 00:51:57,713
I like that.

1154
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,388
Nice.

1155
00:52:23,238 --> 00:52:24,441
Right into the chorus.

1156
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:40,756
One more time.

1157
00:52:54,403 --> 00:52:55,839
Nice.

1158
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,307
We changed that melody
actually going up.

1159
00:52:58,773 --> 00:52:59,923
-Which I think is better.
-It's better.

1160
00:52:59,924 --> 00:53:01,492
Okay. Okay. Cool.

1161
00:53:01,493 --> 00:53:03,240
I don't know why, we just...
it's not on the record.

1162
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:04,680
-But who cares.
-Yeah, whatever.

1163
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:06,315
But that's
the good thing about live,

1164
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,151
is that you can do
whatever you want.

1165
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:10,452
-It doesn't have to be like the record.
-Yeah, yeah.

1166
00:53:10,485 --> 00:53:11,787
And then not doing the intro
I think helped, as well.

1167
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:12,221
I think so too.

1168
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:14,224
-Yeah, you know what I mean?
-The energy immediately goes up.

1169
00:53:14,256 --> 00:53:16,325
And regardless of where
we place it in a set,

1170
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:18,694
that doesn't affect anything
that it just goes right away.

1171
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:20,061
No, you just don't
say anything for it.

1172
00:53:20,062 --> 00:53:20,729
Just a count off.

1173
00:53:20,762 --> 00:53:21,696
You just go right
in from another song.

1174
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:22,164
Okay, cool, yeah.

1175
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:24,233
-No.
-From the top, one more time.

1176
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,293
I mean, even if I'm trying
to think what would be a...

1177
00:53:25,294 --> 00:53:25,635
Okay.

1178
00:53:25,668 --> 00:53:27,637
You know even ending
on a "hothouse" ending

1179
00:53:27,669 --> 00:53:28,838
and then going right into this
would be really pretty.

1180
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:30,372
-Yeah, that would.
-Yeah.

1181
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:31,907
'Cause in rehearsal
it didn't... it felt good

1182
00:53:31,941 --> 00:53:33,743
but it felt too relaxed
or something to intro it.

1183
00:53:33,776 --> 00:53:34,878
-It was kinda disjointed.
-Like it was, okay good night.

1184
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1185
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:38,689
Okay. Let's start it
from there one more time.

1186
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:39,148
All right here...

1187
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,151
Here we go.
One, two, three, four.

1188
00:53:47,756 --> 00:53:49,559
Nice.

1189
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:31,200
Nice. Again.

1190
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:48,218
Nice. Now break down,
break down the hook.

1191
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,401
Nice.

1192
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:22,651
-And into the bridge, right?
-And into the bridge.

1193
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:41,938
You can tell when somebody
is like vibing on your man.

1194
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:42,699
Like you know what I mean?

1195
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,905
-Yeah, that's like...
-Yeah, that's true.

1196
00:55:43,939 --> 00:55:44,907
You're kinda like,

1197
00:55:44,939 --> 00:55:46,309
"yeah, like you're friends,

1198
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,510
but like she
would go for it."

1199
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:50,012
-And that's... and I know.
-Yeah, right. That's weird.

1200
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,314
-And mama knows.
-"Mama knows?"

1201
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:53,882
"Mama knows.
Mama knows best."

1202
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:55,918
Mama knows
and mama doesn't like that.

1203
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,287
Has that ever happened to you,
like personally?

1204
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,590
The guy that I was supposed
to lose my virginity to...

1205
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:02,725
-Supposed to!
-Supposed to!

1206
00:56:02,758 --> 00:56:04,660
-My...
-In my house.

1207
00:56:04,693 --> 00:56:05,794
-Like it was very, it was planned...
-i planned it out.

1208
00:56:05,827 --> 00:56:07,530
-My room.
-I planned it out.

1209
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:09,465
I kind of did do that
but then...

1210
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:11,867
No, my best friend actually
had sex with him

1211
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,836
underneath my nose, twice!

1212
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:15,604
No, sweetheart.

1213
00:56:15,637 --> 00:56:17,539
The girls
are here for you

1214
00:56:17,572 --> 00:56:19,341
just as much
as for your sister.

1215
00:56:19,374 --> 00:56:20,709
-They're your friends, too.
-That's I think what it is.

1216
00:56:20,742 --> 00:56:22,378
Sometimes I feel like
we're just like a unit.

1217
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,447
Like you get one,
you get the other.

1218
00:56:24,479 --> 00:56:25,814
But do you think... some
people don't want the other.

1219
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:27,516
See, I think
it's coming from you.

1220
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,785
I think other people perceive
you as a separate thing.

1221
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:32,621
You are not your sister, you're
not an extension of your sister.

1222
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:36,793
You're you. You're this glorious,
talented, beautiful girl.

1223
00:56:36,825 --> 00:56:38,760
And I think that's
what people see, honey.

1224
00:56:38,793 --> 00:56:41,430
Yeah.

1225
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:43,999
Of course, I'm in here
with mom in the bathroom.

1226
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,435
What could be better?

1227
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:47,765
Had sex with her the
night before and was

1228
00:56:47,766 --> 00:56:48,970
about to have sex
with her that night.

1229
00:56:49,003 --> 00:56:51,106
-No.
-My god.

1230
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:53,342
No, no, nothing with me.
We made out, I was like...

1231
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:54,811
were you
devastated?

1232
00:56:54,843 --> 00:56:56,378
But you weren't like
official yet?

1233
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,514
No, we were official.
He fully cheated on me.

1234
00:56:58,546 --> 00:57:00,682
Were you devastated?

1235
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:02,517
Yeah, but I was so mad at
him because she told me...

1236
00:57:02,518 --> 00:57:03,118
Obviously...

1237
00:57:03,151 --> 00:57:06,521
-This ended the friendship.
-No. It ended the relationship.

1238
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:09,792
She told me in the car
and she's like...

1239
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:12,061
the way she did it
was so creepy...

1240
00:57:12,093 --> 00:57:13,729
and she looked at me
and she's like,

1241
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:16,465
and she was the driver,
I didn't have a license yet,

1242
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,434
and she's just like,
"I had sex with Richard."

1243
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:20,135
And she was smiling.

1244
00:57:20,168 --> 00:57:22,637
She was like, "perfect.
She played right into it.

1245
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:25,140
And like he was like crying,
it was very sad.

1246
00:57:25,173 --> 00:57:27,409
-He cried?
-Yeah, he was very upset.

1247
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:30,046
-Well, why the fuck did he do it?
-Exactly.

1248
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,548
Because he's just a stupid man.
Motherfucker.

1249
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:34,984
I mean, he had like
played like this like...

1250
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:35,785
I'm sorry.

1251
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:37,520
Remember, John,

1252
00:57:37,552 --> 00:57:41,423
"share, care,
and beware."

1253
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,829
You got this.

1254
00:57:46,861 --> 00:57:48,497
Thanks, babe.

1255
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:55,604
John brought Susan to the party
against my sister's wishes.

1256
00:57:55,637 --> 00:57:58,140
Sometimes "John" feels better
than saying "dad."

1257
00:58:10,586 --> 00:58:11,788
Hey, man.

1258
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:17,893
What's up?

1259
00:58:19,628 --> 00:58:20,863
Hi, Syd.

1260
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,633
-Joy.
-Do you like my coat?

1261
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:25,668
-I love it.
-Thank you.

1262
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,053
Come on, take it off.

1263
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:45,121
Why are you doing this?
It's cold.

1264
00:58:45,153 --> 00:58:46,688
I brought
a water slide.

1265
00:58:46,722 --> 00:58:49,091
-Water slide?
-You brought a water slide?

1266
00:58:49,124 --> 00:58:49,769
Yes, I brought a water slide.

1267
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,060
Sorry, tight arms. You
got me too small of a size.

1268
00:58:51,093 --> 00:58:52,595
-Where are you gonna put a water slide?
-What the hell?

1269
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:57,700
Books are different.

1270
00:58:57,733 --> 00:58:59,135
Yeah.

1271
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:05,907
You wanna show me
around?

1272
00:59:05,941 --> 00:59:07,176
Yeah.

1273
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:10,146
I'll show you
some other new things.

1274
00:59:12,213 --> 00:59:14,851
Here's my room.

1275
00:59:14,883 --> 00:59:15,985
It's lovely.

1276
00:59:16,017 --> 00:59:18,954
Don't need
to see that.

1277
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,858
Come on, you pussies,
do a shot with me.

1278
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,494
i haven't
even seen them.

1279
00:59:24,526 --> 00:59:25,994
Give them a break.

1280
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:27,997
I was at pumpkin carving thing
a couple years ago.

1281
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,798
The pumpkin
carving party.

1282
00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:31,032
-Yeah. Dan was there.
-That was so painful.

1283
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:32,535
I wasn't invited
to a pumpkin carving...

1284
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:34,537
That's 'cause only
two of us showed up.

1285
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,138
Don't get all butthurt about the
pumpkin carving party, okay?

1286
00:59:36,171 --> 00:59:38,073
What... you didn't even know
them until like a year ago.

1287
00:59:38,106 --> 00:59:39,541
-A year and a half ago.
-We go back.

1288
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:40,943
-We're the old friends.
-We're old school.

1289
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:42,111
-You're new school.
-Well, you know what?

1290
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:44,213
Who goes back,
me and Lynn.

1291
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:46,148
-Don't get me started on Lynn.
-We go way, way back.

1292
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,749
No, you can't
claim this woman

1293
00:59:47,782 --> 00:59:48,985
-this woman has known me...
-No, she's mine.

1294
00:59:49,017 --> 00:59:50,820
Since I was a toddler
practically.

1295
00:59:50,852 --> 00:59:52,287
Nice.

1296
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,756
-Those are dudes'.
-Those are lady boxers.

1297
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:58,561
I mean, really...
Yes.

1298
00:59:58,593 --> 01:00:01,063
Look,
all you have to do,

1299
01:00:01,095 --> 01:00:03,832
is try my slide
and I'll leave you alone.

1300
01:00:03,865 --> 01:00:05,534
You actually found
my favorite suit.

1301
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:10,039
Believe it or not.
Turn around.

1302
01:00:10,072 --> 01:00:12,974
By the way, I hear you have a
new little man in your life.

1303
01:00:13,008 --> 01:00:14,710
Yeah, I do.

1304
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:16,111
You guys would love him.

1305
01:00:16,144 --> 01:00:18,880
He's super grounded,
super down to earth.

1306
01:00:18,914 --> 01:00:20,682
He he wishes
he could be here.

1307
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:22,784
-Where is he tonight?
-He had to work.

1308
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:24,653
How long
you guys been dating?

1309
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:25,987
It's been
a little while.

1310
01:00:26,021 --> 01:00:27,189
-Yeah?
-All right.

1311
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:29,825
-Fun.
-Hey, where are the girls?

1312
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,196
-My god.
-What? I've barely seen them.

1313
01:00:34,229 --> 01:00:37,198
I think Joy
is in her room.

1314
01:00:37,231 --> 01:00:39,235
Well, you know,
I will go and get them out.

1315
01:00:39,267 --> 01:00:41,570
But before I do,
does anybody want...

1316
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:43,072
What?

1317
01:00:44,372 --> 01:00:45,775
-A smoke?
-Coming in hot.

1318
01:00:45,807 --> 01:00:48,110
This is why
I love you, Lynn.

1319
01:00:48,142 --> 01:00:50,612
You're the coolest mom
of all time.

1320
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:51,191
I wish my mom was like you.

1321
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:52,281
A little present, a
little present from mommy.

1322
01:00:52,314 --> 01:00:54,984
I thought I was the only one who
brought crack to this party.

1323
01:00:55,017 --> 01:00:56,752
Apparently not.

1324
01:00:56,785 --> 01:00:58,020
I'm in good company.

1325
01:00:58,052 --> 01:01:00,055
-No peeking.
-All right.

1326
01:01:00,088 --> 01:01:03,224
-Okay. Very good. My... okay.
-Move the long hair, just a little bit.

1327
01:01:03,258 --> 01:01:04,727
All right. Okay.

1328
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,062
A little precaution.

1329
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,798
Put up the shield
of protection.

1330
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,131
Shield?

1331
01:01:10,164 --> 01:01:11,199
Are you kidding me
with the double doors?

1332
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:12,834
Why am I
turned around then?

1333
01:01:12,867 --> 01:01:14,169
Because,
it's important to me.

1334
01:01:14,202 --> 01:01:16,072
No, no, no, no, no.
We're making a deal.

1335
01:01:16,104 --> 01:01:18,907
Now this is
definitely your bed.

1336
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,276
Yes,
do you like the new artwork?

1337
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:23,345
-I do.
-Good.

1338
01:01:23,378 --> 01:01:26,348
-It's a nice addition.
-Yeah, I agree.

1339
01:01:26,381 --> 01:01:28,050
Is it a little weird
that it's above my bed?

1340
01:01:28,082 --> 01:01:30,019
No, no.
It's completely normal.

1341
01:01:30,052 --> 01:01:30,561
It's...

1342
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,088
Does that say
something bad about me?

1343
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,189
My back has been
bothering me lately.

1344
01:01:34,222 --> 01:01:36,191
No.

1345
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:37,892
You know what? When you're...
when you're first with somebody

1346
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:39,961
and like, you just wanna be
doing it all the time.

1347
01:01:39,994 --> 01:01:42,030
And you wanna try
all these new positions.

1348
01:01:42,064 --> 01:01:43,165
And you know...

1349
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:44,400
Like from the back,

1350
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:46,001
and with the shoulders
and the hair...

1351
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,737
I don't know,
I tweaked something in my hip

1352
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:49,304
and I got
a little back spasm.

1353
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:51,006
Shit.
I gotta meet this guy.

1354
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:52,374
I'm not gonna stop
doing it.

1355
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,043
This place is like camping.
I'm sorry.

1356
01:01:54,075 --> 01:01:55,644
You know
what that means.

1357
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:57,145
This place is nothing
like camping, though.

1358
01:01:57,178 --> 01:01:58,381
Yes, it is.

1359
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,116
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm a little spoiled.

1360
01:02:00,148 --> 01:02:03,218
But I do not like bugs,
and creatures, and flies,

1361
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:04,853
and fucking dead rats

1362
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,789
and leaves falling
all over me on the patio.

1363
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:08,024
That's just how I feel.

1364
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,725
I don't know about you.

1365
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:13,029
Everyone loves this place.
Yeah, I know they do.

1366
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:14,863
But we didn't know what we were
getting ourselves into, okay?

1367
01:02:14,896 --> 01:02:16,097
If it was me, I would
still be living out

1368
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:17,800
in calabasas, right now.

1369
01:02:17,832 --> 01:02:19,135
In the life of luxury.

1370
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,336
Instead,
I'm in a fucking 1920s cottage

1371
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:23,171
dealing with death
around every corner.

1372
01:02:23,204 --> 01:02:24,239
That is my life.

1373
01:02:25,974 --> 01:02:31,113
Well, trust me, Joy.
You haven't lost anything.

1374
01:02:31,146 --> 01:02:33,716
Really?

1375
01:02:33,749 --> 01:02:35,117
Yeah, really.

1376
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:37,352
What makes you
say that?

1377
01:02:37,385 --> 01:02:40,288
You might've
even got hotter.

1378
01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:44,860
Happens with age.

1379
01:02:44,892 --> 01:02:47,195
Look, I'll tell you what.
I'll make a deal.

1380
01:02:47,229 --> 01:02:49,765
I won't make a move
on you all night,

1381
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:51,167
just let me watch.

1382
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,968
Does it look like that,

1383
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:55,104
-or does it look like that?
-Or like that?

1384
01:02:55,137 --> 01:02:56,738
-The latter... no I said...
-So what's the confusion?

1385
01:02:56,771 --> 01:02:58,807
Well, no,
I was pretty sure.

1386
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,810
I just, you know, I'm always a
little uncertain which is which.

1387
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:03,979
-So...
-You don't know...

1388
01:03:04,012 --> 01:03:07,541
Like, is circumcised mean
it's been snipped or not?

1389
01:03:07,542 --> 01:03:08,718
Exactly.

1390
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,352
But you know
what you are,

1391
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:12,121
-you just don't know what the word is.
-Right.

1392
01:03:12,153 --> 01:03:14,222
It's like flammable
and inflammable.

1393
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:16,425
They mean the same thing
actually.

1394
01:03:16,457 --> 01:03:18,727
They both mean flammable.

1395
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,262
-I mean...
-It's tricky though.

1396
01:03:20,294 --> 01:03:23,331
How do you know? You haven't
had to deal with rat death.

1397
01:03:23,365 --> 01:03:25,101
Well, no.
But the smell's lingering.

1398
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:26,869
I mean,
it's gotta be something.

1399
01:03:26,901 --> 01:03:29,871
-It's gotta be...
-clinging to the clothes?

1400
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:31,173
-No.
-Maybe.

1401
01:03:31,206 --> 01:03:32,474
Check the rodarte dress.

1402
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:33,943
Row-dente?

1403
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,144
No, rodarte.

1404
01:03:35,177 --> 01:03:36,512
-Okay...
-That one.

1405
01:03:36,544 --> 01:03:38,347
-What does that mean?
-It's just...

1406
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,115
It's a label.
It's a designer person.

1407
01:03:40,148 --> 01:03:41,282
Please.

1408
01:03:41,316 --> 01:03:43,319
No.
No that one on the right.

1409
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:45,121
On the right.
On the right...

1410
01:03:45,153 --> 01:03:46,121
-Yeah.
-Smell that. Sniff it.

1411
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,224
Go...

1412
01:03:48,256 --> 01:03:50,525
-Does it smell bad?
-I don't think so, actually.

1413
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,294
Really? It doesn't?

1414
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:54,063
Sorry.

1415
01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:57,032
That's good.

1416
01:03:58,432 --> 01:04:00,335
Have a seat.

1417
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:10,345
Okay.

1418
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:12,981
We're gonna make it a show
if that's what you want.

1419
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,494
My god.

1420
01:04:25,526 --> 01:04:27,862
It's a miracle.
It's perfect.

1421
01:04:30,131 --> 01:04:32,066
-Happy?
-Yes.

1422
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:35,137
It's not bad
in here.

1423
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:37,039
It's not like
your calabasas closet.

1424
01:04:37,072 --> 01:04:40,008
Yeah, hello. This is what it's
like to be a poor person.

1425
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:43,344
It's not as bad
as your closet, but...

1426
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:46,816
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1427
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:56,158
-No, I nailed it.
-You did?

1428
01:04:56,191 --> 01:04:58,360
-I did.
-How did you do that?

1429
01:04:58,392 --> 01:05:00,396
Because I was... and I was
reading with him too.

1430
01:05:00,428 --> 01:05:02,331
My... well,
but that's why,

1431
01:05:02,363 --> 01:05:04,066
because he's so good
so you're like...

1432
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:06,001
The chemistry was there.

1433
01:05:06,034 --> 01:05:08,470
Although like, we were supposed
to be brother and sister.

1434
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:10,372
But that's okay.

1435
01:05:10,405 --> 01:05:12,240
There's always
that weird dynamic

1436
01:05:12,273 --> 01:05:13,942
-between brother and sisters.
-There's a couple Oscar movies

1437
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:15,945
that have touched
on that issue I think.

1438
01:05:15,977 --> 01:05:19,481
-Issue?
-Yeah the... issue.

1439
01:05:19,514 --> 01:05:21,383
Incest is best.

1440
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:24,019
Actually, I used to...
They... there's a...

1441
01:05:24,052 --> 01:05:25,588
-there's a...
-incest is best.

1442
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,555
Put your sibling
to the test.

1443
01:05:27,588 --> 01:05:28,490
There, no...
Really.

1444
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,275
-Did you ever find them?
-Yeah. They're coming.

1445
01:07:15,463 --> 01:07:17,166
Okay, you saw
this coming.

1446
01:07:17,198 --> 01:07:19,434
But when John arrived
at the party,

1447
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:22,438
Joy was so surprised
to see Susan standing there

1448
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:24,706
that she fell down.

1449
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,542
Hi, dad.

1450
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,577
Hey, sweetie...

1451
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:33,215
I don't know about the water
slide out here at night.

1452
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,985
It wasn't
our idea, I promise.

1453
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:38,220
-Here you go, I know you like purple.
-Thank you.

1454
01:07:38,253 --> 01:07:40,189
-Yeah. Hey, Joy.
-Hi.

1455
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,591
-Hi.
-Joy, this is susie, Susan.

1456
01:07:42,624 --> 01:07:45,561
-This is... This is Joy.
-Hi.

1457
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:47,563
-Hello.
-I've heard so much about you.

1458
01:07:47,595 --> 01:07:49,030
-Thank you. Sorry, I'm kinda wet.
-Nice to meet you.

1459
01:07:49,064 --> 01:07:50,466
Nice to meet you.

1460
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,034
It's not nice
what happened next.

1461
01:07:52,066 --> 01:07:54,369
Let's skip ahead
and just say this.

1462
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,171
Susan stayed in the car.

1463
01:07:56,204 --> 01:07:57,706
John went inside.

1464
01:07:57,738 --> 01:08:02,510
And Joy went upstairs
to change back into her dress.

1465
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:22,097
Can you get the back?

1466
01:08:44,652 --> 01:08:49,057
-Is it weird seeing him?
-I mean...

1467
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:50,291
I mean, yeah,
it was like awkward

1468
01:08:50,325 --> 01:08:51,827
when I came down
like the steps.

1469
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,329
It was weird
because you know when you like

1470
01:08:54,362 --> 01:08:57,132
still have that...

1471
01:08:57,165 --> 01:08:58,567
That rapport or that...

1472
01:08:58,599 --> 01:09:00,736
-Right.
-I don't know, it's like...

1473
01:09:00,768 --> 01:09:03,638
It kind of floods back
all of a sudden.

1474
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:06,442
So you kind
of miss him...

1475
01:09:06,474 --> 01:09:08,544
-Yeah.
-You have feelings for him still.

1476
01:09:08,576 --> 01:09:11,079
-You're like, yes...
-Yeah.

1477
01:09:11,112 --> 01:09:12,380
Sometimes you need it
from a man.

1478
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:13,682
You know what I mean?

1479
01:09:13,714 --> 01:09:15,083
It's like...
And then he blamed it on,

1480
01:09:15,116 --> 01:09:16,084
"well you're just close
to your mom.

1481
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:17,686
You know
what I mean?

1482
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:18,687
That's all you, you guys
are like three musketeers.

1483
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,188
And you leave me out."

1484
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:23,157
And it's like,
no, like, I love my dad.

1485
01:09:23,191 --> 01:09:25,227
You know, I wanna be
in a relationship with him.

1486
01:09:40,241 --> 01:09:42,643
But did you see
her dress?

1487
01:09:42,677 --> 01:09:45,481
-It was so ugly.
-I know.

1488
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:46,881
-It looked like...
-That thing was offensive.

1489
01:09:46,915 --> 01:09:49,185
Palm Springs meets Vegas.

1490
01:09:55,857 --> 01:10:00,429
-Hey, dada.
-Sweetie.

1491
01:10:00,461 --> 01:10:02,531
Hey, how are ya.

1492
01:10:02,563 --> 01:10:05,666
Look
at you creatures.

1493
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,237
Look at you.

1494
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:09,871
What's going on here?

1495
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:12,241
What is that?
I almost let you kiss me.

1496
01:10:12,273 --> 01:10:13,642
What? What's wrong?

1497
01:10:13,674 --> 01:10:16,512
-It's okay, okay sweetie.
-What happened?

1498
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:17,813
I think she just
threw up in her face.

1499
01:10:17,845 --> 01:10:18,813
Dad said it looked like
she was...

1500
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,314
Honey.

1501
01:10:20,348 --> 01:10:22,451
Yeah, here.
There's some on the floor.

1502
01:10:22,483 --> 01:10:25,419
Honey.

1503
01:10:25,452 --> 01:10:29,423
That smells
like bleach.

1504
01:10:29,456 --> 01:10:31,259
-Really?
-No, this is cum.

1505
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:32,460
What?

1506
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,429
That's not...
No, that's not possible.

1507
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:35,763
Where's my shotglass?

1508
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:36,932
Dad brought Susan.

1509
01:10:36,964 --> 01:10:38,534
Dad what?

1510
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,701
He fucking brought Susan.
I'm gonna lose it.

1511
01:10:39,733 --> 01:10:40,936
I'm gonna pass
the fuck out.

1512
01:10:42,403 --> 01:10:44,339
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where is she?

1513
01:10:44,371 --> 01:10:45,706
Outside. In the car.
Past the gate.

1514
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,808
I told him
if he brought her in

1515
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,477
that he wasn't
my dad anymore.

1516
01:10:48,509 --> 01:10:50,445
-Okay. That's great.
-My god.

1517
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:51,747
-All right...
-I'm so hot.

1518
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,447
I'm just...
It's fine, it's no big deal.

1519
01:10:53,481 --> 01:10:55,483
Elle, everything okay?

1520
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,719
Elle, why the hell
is there cum on the floor?

1521
01:10:57,751 --> 01:10:59,254
-My god.
-There's what?

1522
01:10:59,286 --> 01:11:01,255
What the fuck?

1523
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:03,592
-There's what?
-My god.

1524
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,761
Wait, wait.

1525
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:07,763
-I'm sorry.
-Hold on. Hold the fuckin' phone.

1526
01:11:07,795 --> 01:11:09,630
-There's cum on the floor?
-That's not really cum, right?

1527
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:11,332
-It does look like cum.
-It is.

1528
01:11:11,366 --> 01:11:12,668
What?

1529
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,303
-What?
-That's fucking cum?

1530
01:11:14,335 --> 01:11:16,304
-My god.
-That's fucking cum?

1531
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,974
-What the fuck?
-I don't know. Maybe the dog came.

1532
01:11:19,006 --> 01:11:20,842
What the fuck?

1533
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:23,245
You... you two... when the hell
did this fuckin' happen?

1534
01:11:23,277 --> 01:11:24,713
Not me.

1535
01:11:24,745 --> 01:11:26,714
Elle wasn't wearing panties,
and it leaked out.

1536
01:11:26,747 --> 01:11:28,250
Wasn't wearing pant... okay.

1537
01:11:28,282 --> 01:11:29,584
Thank you, Reed.
Thank you.

1538
01:11:29,617 --> 01:11:30,919
-Thank you for that.
-Shit happens.

1539
01:11:30,951 --> 01:11:32,720
We understand
how that happened.

1540
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:34,256
-You weren't wearing a condom?
-Yeah, I mean,

1541
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:35,857
your dad would never
even have sex with me

1542
01:11:35,889 --> 01:11:39,695
-if he didn't have a condom.
-Okay, mom, stop.

1543
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:41,697
You get the fuck out
of here.

1544
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:42,187
Okay, I'm gone.

1545
01:11:42,188 --> 01:11:43,564
You just go. Get some
panties on, harlot.

1546
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:45,434
-Really, Reed?
-What's with not wearing a condom?

1547
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,302
What...

1548
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:48,804
-what is wrong with you?
-That smell...

1549
01:11:48,836 --> 01:11:50,805
My god.

1550
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:52,341
You really...

1551
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:53,976
Have to be
more responsible.

1552
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,510
I'm sure she's on
the pill, but what?

1553
01:11:55,543 --> 01:11:57,478
You wanna get
herpes from her?

1554
01:11:57,512 --> 01:11:58,847
-I don't know if she has herpes or not.
-Mom, stop it.

1555
01:11:58,879 --> 01:12:00,548
She doesn't have herpes.
You're embarrassing him.

1556
01:12:00,581 --> 01:12:02,351
Well, you know, you wear
condoms for a reason.

1557
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:07,389
-Ahem... after you.
-Thanks.

1558
01:12:07,421 --> 01:12:09,558
I'm actually just gonna
wait out here for a friend.

1559
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,727
It's not 'cause
I have a sword, right?

1560
01:12:11,759 --> 01:12:14,729
It's not real.
It's...

1561
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:17,265
It's actually for wine.

1562
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:18,867
-Awesome.
-Dan.

1563
01:12:20,067 --> 01:12:22,036
Cool.

1564
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:25,040
John's girlfriend Susan
had told her friends

1565
01:12:25,072 --> 01:12:27,575
that she was planning
to spend more time together

1566
01:12:27,608 --> 01:12:30,044
with John's family.

1567
01:12:30,077 --> 01:12:33,482
They wanted proof before they
would support the relationship.

1568
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:36,818
Selfie.

1569
01:12:38,385 --> 01:12:40,888
That was so slutty of you.
I'm embarrassed.

1570
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:43,025
And who changes?

1571
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,893
Who changes right here in front of
this open door for everyone to see?

1572
01:12:44,925 --> 01:12:46,762
And who designed
this piece of shit?

1573
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,764
Who... I mean,
it's literally open windows.

1574
01:12:48,796 --> 01:12:51,633
Hi. Hi, I'm naked.
Hello.

1575
01:12:51,665 --> 01:12:53,968
-I don't get it.
-Okay, very funny.

1576
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:55,504
What are you...
What are you doing in here?

1577
01:12:55,536 --> 01:12:56,905
Are you getting
all freshened up?

1578
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:58,372
Are you about to go round two?
What's going on?

1579
01:12:58,406 --> 01:12:59,875
-Yeah, I am,
-I mean, Lacey panties.

1580
01:12:59,907 --> 01:13:01,709
What...
What're you doing?

1581
01:13:01,742 --> 01:13:03,077
This is the time where you
get comfortable now, right?

1582
01:13:03,111 --> 01:13:04,780
You already had sex.
We get it, okay.

1583
01:13:04,812 --> 01:13:06,480
You trailed your business
all over the floor.

1584
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:08,382
We understand
what happened.

1585
01:13:08,415 --> 01:13:08,765
Right?

1586
01:13:08,766 --> 01:13:09,817
No, I did not trail
all over the floor.

1587
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:11,987
-It was in one spot.
-That we know of.

1588
01:13:12,019 --> 01:13:13,688
Who knows what dad saw.
Who knows what he heard.

1589
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,857
Dad didn't see anything.
He already left.

1590
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:17,659
No, he didn't.

1591
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:18,994
He's still
fucking here?

1592
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,363
No...
Unless the man out there

1593
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:22,863
is... is...
Is not my father.

1594
01:13:22,897 --> 01:13:24,499
Get the broseph
to fucking leave.

1595
01:13:24,531 --> 01:13:25,800
He won't. And she's
still out here, too.

1596
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:27,469
She's on the fucking
street in the car.

1597
01:13:27,501 --> 01:13:29,470
-Susan's still down here?
-Yes, she was smoking.

1598
01:13:29,504 --> 01:13:31,340
Okay, well,
what just happened, actually,

1599
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:32,808
should have made him leave.
So, there you go.

1600
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,976
You got anything left
to trail around?

1601
01:13:35,009 --> 01:13:37,679
Actually, yeah, I could
fucking squeeze it out for you.

1602
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:39,348
-My god.
-You weirdo.

1603
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:40,948
Okay, all right, we're done.
We can't...

1604
01:13:40,982 --> 01:13:42,884
I can't talk about your
sexual activity anymore.

1605
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:44,753
-Were you safe?
-Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

1606
01:13:44,786 --> 01:13:46,855
What does he hate?
He hates movies.

1607
01:13:46,888 --> 01:13:48,590
-He hates movies...
-He hates movies.

1608
01:13:48,622 --> 01:13:49,924
Well, that's a natural thing
to put on at a party.

1609
01:13:49,957 --> 01:13:51,793
We're too loud.
We're too fucking loud.

1610
01:13:51,826 --> 01:13:53,862
-Animated movies he hates.
-He hates animated movies.

1611
01:13:53,894 --> 01:13:55,530
And he hates
subtitled films.

1612
01:13:55,562 --> 01:13:56,831
If we put them on,
it'll give him a headache.

1613
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:58,700
-Perfect.
-Will other people leave?

1614
01:13:58,732 --> 01:14:00,568
-Shit.
-What if our friends leave?

1615
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,070
By the way, a shit ton
of people showed up.

1616
01:14:02,103 --> 01:14:04,439
-I know they did.
-You, me, mom, dad.

1617
01:14:04,472 --> 01:14:07,608
-Alice, Lauren, Reed...
-You can't count us. We live here.

1618
01:14:07,642 --> 01:14:09,778
Fuck, wait, hold on.
Yeah, we can.

1619
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:11,813
You came.
You came twice.

1620
01:14:11,845 --> 01:14:14,148
Very funny.
Hold on. Brian...

1621
01:14:14,182 --> 01:14:15,883
You have to go pee?
Why are you like that?

1622
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:16,451
A little bit.

1623
01:14:16,483 --> 01:14:17,451
You have to pee after sex.

1624
01:14:17,485 --> 01:14:18,687
I haven't done it yet.

1625
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,554
Hold on.
The landlords.

1626
01:14:20,588 --> 01:14:21,790
They count. They're
still in our territory.

1627
01:14:21,822 --> 01:14:23,424
-The landlords.
-Yeah, yeah.

1628
01:14:23,457 --> 01:14:25,427
-They count.
-Wait. Do we count Susan?

1629
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,596
Sure, count Susan.
Yeah, yeah, she's here.

1630
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,631
She's on the street, we didn't
even let her in the house.

1631
01:14:29,664 --> 01:14:30,276
Susan, the landlords...

1632
01:14:30,277 --> 01:14:31,500
You don't fucking count
Susan, you dumbass!

1633
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:33,000
-You're a fucking dumbass.
-Now, hurry up.

1634
01:14:33,034 --> 01:14:34,536
Shut up.

1635
01:14:34,568 --> 01:14:36,670
No more slutty behavior.
That was disgusting.

1636
01:14:40,707 --> 01:14:41,942
You weirdo.

1637
01:14:41,976 --> 01:14:43,577
This is open.
Anyone could do that.

1638
01:14:43,611 --> 01:14:44,845
-I know it is!
-Potentially, anyone could...

1639
01:14:44,879 --> 01:14:46,680
-Shuffle.
-Shuffled. He did it.

1640
01:14:46,714 --> 01:14:49,551
So basically there's
townspeople and there's mafia.

1641
01:14:49,584 --> 01:14:51,052
There's more
townspeople than mafia.

1642
01:14:51,085 --> 01:14:53,855
You have to figure out
who the mafia are.

1643
01:14:53,888 --> 01:14:56,024
-Preach it.
-Everyday you wake up

1644
01:14:56,057 --> 01:14:58,026
-and then you go back to sleep.
-I don't understand...

1645
01:14:58,058 --> 01:14:59,561
I'm not gonna
be able to do this.

1646
01:14:59,594 --> 01:15:01,096
The card picks
who's what.

1647
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:04,633
So, so basically the mafia
has to lie to everyone else

1648
01:15:04,665 --> 01:15:06,500
and tell them
they're not the mafia.

1649
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:07,835
And then if they get
to the end of the game

1650
01:15:07,869 --> 01:15:09,704
and nobody discovers
they are the mafia,

1651
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:11,173
-then they win.
-Also...

1652
01:15:11,205 --> 01:15:13,974
So they basically
have to lie and deceive and...

1653
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:15,477
Your dad would probably be
pretty good at this.

1654
01:15:17,144 --> 01:15:19,481
-That's probably true.
-That's true. He would.

1655
01:15:21,915 --> 01:15:24,585
He lied to us for
fucking, what, 20, 25 years.

1656
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:26,955
If I was in the mafia,
I wouldn't want to be

1657
01:15:26,987 --> 01:15:28,622
adopted by your dad,
though, 'cause...

1658
01:15:28,656 --> 01:15:30,091
It's
a really good game.

1659
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:31,960
Could you come here?

1660
01:15:37,098 --> 01:15:38,066
Dad, wait. Wait.

1661
01:15:38,098 --> 01:15:39,467
-Wait.
-Look.

1662
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,802
This is all about Susan,
all right?

1663
01:15:40,835 --> 01:15:42,671
You shouldn't have
fuckin' brought her.

1664
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:43,170
We told you not to.

1665
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:44,104
Daddy, you've done
this multiple times.

1666
01:15:44,138 --> 01:15:45,707
-All the time, uninvited.
-You never let me

1667
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,209
introduce this woman
to you. Okay?

1668
01:15:47,241 --> 01:15:49,177
-She's the woman in my life.
-She's not invited.

1669
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:51,613
-You need to accept...
-This is the woman you were with

1670
01:15:51,646 --> 01:15:54,215
when you were with our mother.
We will not respect her.

1671
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:55,784
I never hurt your mother
on purpose, ever.

1672
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:57,719
Okay? You have no idea
what was happening.

1673
01:15:57,751 --> 01:15:59,254
You always make it
like we're the bad guy.

1674
01:15:59,286 --> 01:16:00,655
You have no idea
the things that she said.

1675
01:16:00,687 --> 01:16:01,789
The things that she would say.

1676
01:16:01,822 --> 01:16:03,525
Okay, I never touched her.

1677
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:05,060
I was never physical with her.
Ever! I never hit her.

1678
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:07,262
-That's a given!
-That's not the point.

1679
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,564
You're not supposed to be physical
as a husband. You two talk to me

1680
01:16:09,597 --> 01:16:11,566
-like I'm a subcontractor!
-So you're still emotionally abusive.

1681
01:16:11,598 --> 01:16:13,101
I don't work for you! I don't
work for you! You look at me!

1682
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:14,669
-Elle!
-Elle, help us out.

1683
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:17,471
Was I ever physical?

1684
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:19,073
Who gives a shit if
you would've cussed?

1685
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,142
It would have been a lot
better than what you've done.

1686
01:16:21,174 --> 01:16:22,878
She would call me
a son of a bitch.

1687
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,779
A motherfucker,
every single fucking day.

1688
01:16:24,812 --> 01:16:26,515
Okay? Fuck this, fuck that.

1689
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:28,116
-She had a mouth like a sailor.
-Mom?

1690
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:30,919
I wish you would have cussed
her out all the fucking time...

1691
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:32,119
-Okay. Really?
-It would have been way better

1692
01:16:32,152 --> 01:16:33,722
than fucking another woman, dad.

1693
01:16:38,726 --> 01:16:41,963
I wish you would have fucking
swore at our whole family.

1694
01:16:41,995 --> 01:16:45,866
Cause at the end of the day,
that shit doesn't matter.

1695
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,269
We're a family we're gonna
fucking do those things,

1696
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:49,970
but you don't fuck
another woman.

1697
01:16:50,004 --> 01:16:53,075
That's what you don't do.

1698
01:17:02,817 --> 01:17:04,753
This is so fucking
embarrassing, I'm sorry.

1699
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,755
If you knew
my younger sister,

1700
01:17:06,787 --> 01:17:09,790
you'd know this is something
she wouldn't get over,

1701
01:17:09,823 --> 01:17:12,160
honey, it's okay. It's okay.
It's just stressing me out

1702
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:14,019
and I couldn't stay
much longer, anyway.

1703
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:16,027
I know because I have to
get home and let rivers out.

1704
01:17:16,028 --> 01:17:19,768
Okay sweetie, I'm fine. I'll...
I'll call Lou on the way home,

1705
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,169
-and get it out.
-I...

1706
01:17:23,737 --> 01:17:24,738
Okay, honey.

1707
01:17:24,772 --> 01:17:26,608
It's okay.

1708
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,842
We're sorry we didn't...

1709
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:29,644
I'll see you
in the morning.

1710
01:17:29,677 --> 01:17:31,313
-Okay.
-It's okay. I love you.

1711
01:17:31,345 --> 01:17:33,214
Okay.

1712
01:17:33,246 --> 01:17:35,082
-I love you, baby.
-I love you mom, I'm sorry.

1713
01:17:35,116 --> 01:17:36,751
Don't be sorry.

1714
01:17:36,784 --> 01:17:39,019
It's important,
I think, to say that

1715
01:17:39,053 --> 01:17:42,323
this is the last time Elle and
Joy saw our mother alive.

1716
01:17:46,193 --> 01:17:48,095
When she crashed
into a retaining wall,

1717
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:52,233
at the base of the canyon
while texting Lou.

1718
01:17:52,265 --> 01:17:55,803
No one at the party heard the sound
reverberate through the canyon.

1719
01:17:55,836 --> 01:17:57,037
At the bottom
of the canyon...

1720
01:17:57,071 --> 01:17:59,006
Mom? Mom!

1721
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,108
The girls didn't
go running down

1722
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,142
to the scene
of the accident.

1723
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:06,648
For a little while,
no one knew but me.

1724
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,316
you seem to be pointing
it down, though.

1725
01:18:08,348 --> 01:18:09,918
-Don't even worry about that.
-The patio got real small...

1726
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,953
-Well, I'm scared.
-Just right through it.

1727
01:18:11,986 --> 01:18:13,354
This cuts through
something you shouldn't...

1728
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:14,889
Just go through it.
Just stroke through it.

1729
01:18:14,921 --> 01:18:16,825
It's like a weird scene
in "the notebook."

1730
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:18,025
It's like a scene
that got cut...

1731
01:18:18,058 --> 01:18:19,326
Shit.

1732
01:18:21,028 --> 01:18:23,130
That was good.

1733
01:18:23,164 --> 01:18:25,032
My god, you took
half the bottle out.

1734
01:18:25,066 --> 01:18:27,135
That was amazing.

1735
01:18:27,168 --> 01:18:29,004
There's no point
in showing you the grief

1736
01:18:29,036 --> 01:18:31,171
Elle and Joy experienced
when they heard the news.

1737
01:18:31,205 --> 01:18:35,677
There's no point in showing
certain things, to anyone.

1738
01:18:37,411 --> 01:18:41,415
We can choose to focus on
other things if we want to.

1739
01:18:41,448 --> 01:18:43,317
It's god's gift.

1740
01:19:23,357 --> 01:19:26,127
Mom was on life support
for several weeks

1741
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,162
before they had to decide
to let her go.

1742
01:19:30,897 --> 01:19:33,416
I'd like to tell you
there was a reconciliation

1743
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:34,969
between Elle,
Joy, and John.

1744
01:19:37,104 --> 01:19:40,340
Sometimes, I imagine how it might
have gone if there had been.

1745
01:19:40,374 --> 01:19:42,711
You know, I really should
be going back to London.

1746
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:44,278
Is this...
No!

1747
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:47,148
Shit, it's just
a little too much for me.

1748
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:48,817
Actually was, a,
a real trip.

1749
01:19:48,849 --> 01:19:51,352
Not fake
like it used to be,

1750
01:19:51,384 --> 01:19:53,287
anyways,
I have some delicious teas

1751
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:54,789
that are herbal
from the deep,

1752
01:19:54,821 --> 01:19:58,792
dark, forests of...
Bombay,

1753
01:19:58,826 --> 01:19:59,894
you know that place.

1754
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:02,229
And here
is your lovely tea,

1755
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:04,099
just a little bit
of it spilled, my dear.

1756
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:05,500
Let me just get it.

1757
01:20:05,532 --> 01:20:09,838
Some Joy always
replaces the hurt.

1758
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:13,741
My sisters went back to praying
together like they had in calabasas.

1759
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:16,076
This especially
pleased my mom.

1760
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:18,213
She hoped they wouldn't
get married young,

1761
01:20:18,245 --> 01:20:22,249
or stop singing if
they couldn't sell records

1762
01:20:22,282 --> 01:20:24,885
sure, she wasn't on
their patio in the morning,

1763
01:20:24,919 --> 01:20:27,488
or, around to take
their phone calls,

1764
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,823
she couldn't hold
their hands at appointments

1765
01:20:29,857 --> 01:20:32,127
or be there
at their first birth.

1766
01:20:34,228 --> 01:20:36,765
But almost
all of their choices

1767
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:39,901
could still be
traced to her.

1768
01:20:44,338 --> 01:20:45,907
This image
is of my sisters

1769
01:20:45,939 --> 01:20:49,210
a few months after
my mother died.

1770
01:20:49,242 --> 01:20:52,179
It's my favorite image
of them because

1771
01:20:52,213 --> 01:20:56,550
it's the first time in months
that they smiled.

1772
01:20:56,584 --> 01:20:59,320
I'm not sure why
it happened here.

1773
01:20:59,353 --> 01:21:01,523
But it just did.

1774
01:21:05,358 --> 01:21:07,428
We understand you!

1775
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,896
We speak your language!

1776
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:16,237
You there!

1777
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,854
Turkey was cancelled,

1778
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:07,155
but their
team managed to set up

1779
01:22:07,187 --> 01:22:10,157
a more lucrative one
in Dubai.

1780
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:13,862
So, they'd always have
that you know,

1781
01:22:13,894 --> 01:22:17,131
"that time in Dubai."

1782
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:49,531
They said goodbye to the house like
they were leaving it for good.

1783
01:24:36,403 --> 01:24:37,604
Are we past it?

1784
01:24:43,277 --> 01:24:45,079
We can't keep doing
this every day.

1785
01:25:02,295 --> 01:25:05,098
I love my sisters.

1786
01:25:05,131 --> 01:25:07,736
I love everything
about them.

1787
01:25:13,573 --> 01:25:17,577
This is Elle, at 24.

1788
01:25:17,611 --> 01:25:21,182
This is Joy at, 22.
