1
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,800


2
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,507
He's like..bap-bap-bap-bap-bap!

3
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:58,701
I give him a tap.

4
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,482
Oh, man..

5
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,610
I thought God was gonna shoot
pool with the nigger's balls.

6
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,416
You know what I mean?
I know we was out in Chalet.

7
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:14,219
Shit was benini.

8
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,385
And then my man J. back there
think he's wild in' out,

9
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:18,690
'cause we already know
each other like that.

10
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:21,095
God got an ill sense of humor,
you know what I mean?

11
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,430
How come God make a man strip
before he beat him down?

12
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,400
Yo, let me tell you
somethin, G'

13
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:28,735
God say a beatin' don't
mean shit to a nigger.

14
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:32,275
Take a man's dignity away
and strip him down naked, humiliate him,

15
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,277
he'll never forget that,
you know what I'm sayin'?

16
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,540
That's some psychological
ill shit, you know what I mean?

17
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:40,311
That's life, though, right
there. I can get with that.

18
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:43,217
- How much this kid
come up short, though?
- God's like,

19
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:45,517
he told the crack head,
stop doin' all the wild shit.

20
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,252
He's still sucking on the glass
dick. All that's irrelevant,

21
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,227
because we ain't gonna
lay him down, you is.

22
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,959
You know what I mean?
You the new kid on the block.
You gots to earn your stripes.

23
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:57,399
- What you talking about, man?
- What you mean,
what I'm talking about?

24
00:02:57,536 --> 00:03:01,165
- Keepin' it real with us, right?
- You know I am.

25
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,171
Then you ain't got
nothin' to worry about.

26
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,141
So he's gotta make sure his
angel's got wings. nigger, fly.

27
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,739
Here comes the exciting part.

28
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:14,581
After months of hard work,
you're finally where you wanna be.

29
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:18,622
You're deep enough inside
so that the boys want to test you.

30
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:23,161
Now, they want you to prove
that you're down, right?

31
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:25,492
No. Absolutely wrong.

32
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:28,498
What they really want you to
prove is that you're not a cop.

33
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:32,002
What do you do?

34
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:35,373
Aw, come on.
Anybody?

35
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,743
Huh. At least we got
one courageous cadet.

36
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:41,607
Come on down here, rook.
Show me what you got.

37
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:44,011
Now, check it out. crimson baby.

38
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:46,550
Main man gonna hang you the honor
of blastin' this punk.

39
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:48,847
He's skimmin' off the top.
We can't have that.

40
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:52,481
- What's up?
- I'll just hand
the honor right back.

41
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:55,116
I mean, it's the man's
beef, not mine.

42
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:57,252
It's not the way
the game is played.

43
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,489
You see, the man's beef...

44
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,725
is always your beef.

45
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:05,235
And you know what else?

46
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:09,000
If you ain't one of us,
you must be one of them.

47
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:13,134
Your stupid ass is dead.

48
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,510
Is that Play skool enough
for you to understand?

49
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:19,448
- You gots to earn
your stripes, baby.
- Make me proud.

50
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,849
No problems.
Show me where the kid at.

51
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:24,718
Don't you worry about it,
man. We're gonna roll by
his place of employment...

52
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:27,792
sort a "in cog-negro."

53
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,195
Then we going to see
if we got the right one, baby.

54
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:34,788
Let me showy' all Cincinnati cats
how to wet a nigga up right.

55
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,925
That's what
I'm talk in 'about.

56
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:40,163
- Right there?
- Right there. All right. Hold up.

57
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,739
Black cap.
Black cap right there.

58
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,865
Whoo-oo!

59
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,410
Yo, roll up.
Yo, roll up close, man.

60
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:49,537
I want to see the whites
in this cat's eyes.

61
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:53,015
There he is, right in front of you.

62
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:57,282
Just a little punk.
Can't keep his nose
out of the cookie jar.

63
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,323
What you gonna do?

64
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:11,360
You just got yourself
in so deep that you'll
never be able to get out.

65
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:15,605
He didn't pose
an immediate threat.

66
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:18,437
For God's sake, you didn't even
check to see if he was armed.

67
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:23,844
You all know what that is?
That's premeditated murder, Cadet.

68
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:32,079
You're hold in' that gun.
Time is runnin' out.

69
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,782
- We out.
- What you talk about?

70
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:36,190
Your brain vaporized
like ten minutes ago.

71
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,389
Your heart's dancin'
on your tongue.

72
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:42,695
Your life depends on
split-second decisions.

73
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,292
You better do somethin'
and you better do it now.

74
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,441
Damn! Go!

75
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,843
- You ain't hit him yet?
- Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

76
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,577
Let's get the fuck out.

77
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,170
- Why you ain't givin' me no co-op, man?
- You can't shoot worth nothin'.

78
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:33,080
- Yo, I had the kid right there, man.
- You ain't nothin' but a talker.

79
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,847
Yo, turn the car around.
Give me a little co-op.

80
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:39,856
Face up, bro. You whack.
Can't shoot. What?

81
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,153
My boy got a crazy heart.

82
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,956
I got a heart.
Ain't gonna was temyammo.

83
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:55,498
- Move over there.
- No, you come on up here.

84
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,631
Just..Just come on.

85
00:06:57,776 --> 00:07:00,176
Come on, man. What you doin'?

86
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:03,008
Come on. Get yourself
in the picture with your mother.

87
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:05,549
Jeffery.
Jeffery.

88
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,811
- Give me the camera.
- Give your sister the camera.

89
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,945
- Go up there with your family.
- Let me take..

90
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,115
No! Go ahead.

91
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:22,766
Ready?

92
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:25,302
I'm gonna go,
catch a football game.

93
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:28,304
Okay. Nice to meet you all.
It's okay.

94
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:32,542
Wait a minute.

95
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:34,611
- Captain D'Ambrosio.
- What's up?

96
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,408
I was wondering if I could stop by
your office tomorrow.

97
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,810
You saw the memo
on my bulletin board?

98
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,720
- How'd you know?
- Because three other rookies already
talked to me about the job today.

99
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:48,292
I'm sure I'd be better
than any of those guys.

100
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:51,191
Really? What makes you think you'd be
so good at undercover work?

101
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:54,527
My mother says I'm damn good at makin'
anyone believe anything, you know.

102
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,533
Oh, your mother.

103
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:59,661
Listen. I grew up in community
housing back in Cleveland.

104
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:04,443
So growing up in the projects..
that doesn't automatically qualify you.

105
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,877
- You know what a street gang does?
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:08,878
There's big players
out here, man.

107
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,948
They're gonna believe
I need in.

108
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,482
Nobody knows me in Cincinnati.

109
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,945
Be in my office
tomorrow, 4:00.

110
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:19,649
You know, you wear your shooting badge
on the wrong side of your uniform.

111
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:22,124
I don't expect I'll be wear in' it
after tomorrow, sir.

112
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:37,807
Here we go.

113
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,436
Attention on a 1-0-5.
Repeat, 1-0-5. All units.

114
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:43,446
Check out this walk,
Wilson.

115
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:45,914
They're gonna figure him
for a narc a mile away.

116
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:49,145
Cut the brother
some slack, will you?

117
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:51,381
This is his first
time on the street.

118
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,835
- What's up?
- What's up, dog?

119
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:07,234
Got some shit?

120
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,308
I don't know you, man. Take that
shit down the block or somethin'.

121
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:13,434
The sepunks ain't gonna
deal this rookie jack shit.

122
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,478
- Is this a joke or somethin', man?
- Go down the block, man.

123
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,141
- You know this nigger here?
- No, son. I don't know this nigger.

124
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:22,277
What's up, man? You a
po-po nigger? What's up?

125
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:24,218
I ain't no mother
fuckin' po-po.

126
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:26,449
Nigger, you sure
smell like you po-po.

127
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:30,484
You out your mother
fuckin' mind, man.

128
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:34,730
- Fuck, nigger. What's up?
- Oh, shit.

129
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,996
Told you this Puerto Rican nose
can smell heat a mile away.

130
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:42,471
I ain't fuckin' with you cats.
You out here with a little
Crackerjack knife.

131
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:45,372
- Nigger, fuck you, man.
- Fuck you, nigger. You don't know me.

132
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:47,707
Chill out.
Chill. Chill. All right?

133
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:50,713
What's up, man?
You buy in' or what?

134
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:52,715
Come on.

135
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:56,586
Damn. Yo.

136
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,555
- All right?
- Yeah.

137
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:08,030
Yeah! Well,
your Puerto Ricannose...

138
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,158
is gettin' as old
as your concepcion.

139
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:13,032
The rook detective bought
his first time out.

140
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:22,546
- What's up, Cap'n?
- How you doin'?

141
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:26,617
Hey, Pres, man, couldn't you
find a warm coffee shop...

142
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:29,152
or someplace we
can be just as safe?

143
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,722
I like this view
of Cincinnati.

144
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:35,259
You can bring a cup of
coffee with you if you want to.

145
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,794
I don't understand why we
have to meet every week.

146
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:41,332
Because talking on the telephone
is not enough for undercover work.

147
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,594
You gotta be able to
unload face to face.

148
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:47,603
Unload what, man? I made a buy
and bust on my first try out.

149
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:49,606
I'd say I was doin'
pretty good, huh?

150
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,233
I would say the department
is doing pretty good.

151
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:54,710
- That would be the way I would put it.
- Right. Right. Excuse me.

152
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:58,909
Look, the point is, I got..
We got some crack off the street.

153
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:02,214
Yep, we did. About a
rat's nostril's worth.

154
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,313
That much. And two hours later,
that corner was back in business.

155
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:09,484
So then what are we doin' here?
Let's go bust 'em again.

156
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:12,927
And again and again until they
get the goddamn point, man.

157
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,696
- Yep.
- What?

158
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,347
- Time out, dog.
- Wake up, baby. Wake up.

159
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,877
- What's up with this, man?
- What the fuck you think?

160
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,980
I'm sayin', man, you don'tjust
bust in here like that.
What's goin' on?

161
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:16,686
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, there's a problem.
Some shit can't wait.

162
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:20,196
Yo, I can see that, man.
It must be pretty important, right?

163
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:22,528
Stop a brother from, you know,
gettin' his eat on.

164
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:25,364
I hear you're real good
with your tongue.

165
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:29,906
- Real good.
- You know, I do what I gotta do
to please the ladies, right?

166
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:33,102
- "Please the ladies."
- I heard you been pleasing
cops with that tongue too, bra.

167
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:36,509
Yo, what? man..Hell no, God.
In ever talked to the cops, man.

168
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:39,378
Come on, man.
I'm just sayin', everybody knows...

169
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:42,248
- what goes around here is
strictly God's business, right?
- Right.

170
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:44,981
I'm just a hard work in' brother
tryin' to survive. You know how it is.

171
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,615
Don't play me,
mother fucker.

172
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,957
I mean, a couple of cops
came down to Burger Castle
tryin' to scare a brother.

173
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:55,123
That's all, man. Yo, God,
I ain't tell 'em shit. They was
tryin' to get me to rat you out.

174
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:58,895
- 'Cause you took
the fuckin' cheese, didn't you?
- No, man, I wouldn't do that.

175
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:02,666
- I got nothin' but love fory' all.
- What are you, a faggot?

176
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,173
- I'm God. God, mother fucker!
- I didn't say nothin'.

177
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,245
What do you mean, you wouldn't do that,
you tall skinny bastard?

178
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:11,838
Tique, hold her stinky ass down.
Easy, now.

179
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,316
Close the mother fuckin' door.

180
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,616
What's up, girlfriend? Chillin'?

181
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,559
Everything's fine.

182
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,823
I ain't chicken, but
I can't deal with that cat.

183
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,767
If I was you, I'd pick the
nigger's tongue up off the floor...

184
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:34,896
and finish the job myself.

185
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,442
I know I ain't gonna hear
nothin' about this, am I?

186
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:46,142
- No. No.
- Huh?

187
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:48,242
I'm gonna holler at you.

188
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:53,547
Gotcha!
Where you goin' now?

189
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,762
Come on, champ.
One more time!

190
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:01,161
You ain't get him.
You gotta get T-Rex down.

191
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:04,235
T-Rex justjumped up on ya.

192
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:10,733
Marcus, get off
your Uncle Jeff.

193
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,139
You got a good thing goin', bro.

194
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:15,839
Yeah, well, you know,
you're such an expert, man.

195
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:18,347
Time for you to start
a little family of your own.

196
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:22,919
Shit. You musta been
talkin' to Mama.

197
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:24,989
- No, man, I'm serious.
- What?

198
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,216
You been on full-time
for over a year now, right?

199
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,418
- Yeah.
- I know you got some
green socked away.

200
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:33,156
- Little bit.
- Mm-hmm. Time to settle
down, man. Make you busy.

201
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:35,459
All right?

202
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:38,559
Yeah. Maybe after I get busy
with a couple hundred more women.

203
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,104
Then me and you can talk.

204
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,667
Come on.
Wanna dance with me?

205
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:55,443
Turn the music down,
college girl.

206
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:59,546
I been fuckin' with
Manny for months, man.
I'm tired of this shit.

207
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:02,649
What's up, man? You want to
do business or what, Holmes?

208
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,127
Let me check you out, man.
Won't take long.

209
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:08,131
- What you talkin' about?
- Then you got your three ki's, yo.

210
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:11,724
What is this, interrogation?
I can take my money
where it's appreciated.

211
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:14,100
- You hear what I'm sayin'?
- We have procedures.

212
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,333
- "Procedures."
- Oh, oh, oh, oh. Them
niggers from New Jersey?

213
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,838
Forget that.
You don't want to do that.

214
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:24,278
- They bad news, man.
- Oh, they bad news?

215
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,647
- That's right. Stay here.
- Check it out. They might
be bad news for you,

216
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,686
maybe, but for me..

217
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:32,221
- You know what I mean, bro?
- Oh, it's like that. All right.

218
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:36,518
You know what they
call the head one? God.

219
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:39,062
- You believe that shit, man?
- Is that right?

220
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:46,459
- Ese, I don't feel like it.
- Come on!

221
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:49,402
Can't you see I'm talking?

222
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:52,271
You wanna dance with me?

223
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:55,744
Or are you as lame as my
two tired-ass brothers?

224
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,747
Whoa!

225
00:15:57,849 --> 00:16:01,080
Piece of advice.
There ain't no such
thing as one dance...

226
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:03,085
with Esperanza.

227
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:05,712
Well?

228
00:16:07,158 --> 00:16:09,058
- It's cool.
- It's cool?

229
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,526
You don't have to ask him.
Come on.

230
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:18,366
Whoo! Go, college girl. Go.

231
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:29,078
So, uh, what happens
to the family?

232
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:32,307
- What do you mean?
- The girl.

233
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:36,217
- Why are you asking me this?
- Because I would like to know.

234
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:39,757
- Drop it.
- What if I don't want to drop it?

235
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:42,018
Then you're messed up,
buddy.

236
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,060
Look, look, look, guys.
Don't get me wrong.

237
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:46,255
I don't give a fuck what
happens to her brothers.

238
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:49,231
- I just want to make
sure that the girl's..
- The girl what?

239
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,426
If she's as clean as she says she is,
she'll be fine.

240
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:54,197
Not that it's any of your business.

241
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,432
You guys don't get it. Her
brothers are payin' for college..

242
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:59,600
Junkies are payin' for it, man..
some with their lives.

243
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:03,145
If I were her little mamacita,
I'd look into some student loans.

244
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:06,682
Either that, or she can work
her little ass out on the street.

245
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:08,684
- Fuck you!
- Hey, fuck you!

246
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:10,981
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go.

247
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,649
Shit, Captain, help this boy
find himself a cover.

248
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:15,988
This battery's fucked.
Hold this.

249
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:18,187
Makes sure this
shit works, man.

250
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,267
What? I'm cool.

251
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,665
- I hope so.
- Cool.

252
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,797
He's right, you know. You
gotta find yourself a deeper l.D.

253
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:32,068
You gotta find yourself
some street character, you know?

254
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,374
Create one to hide behind
so your feelings don't
mess you up so much.

255
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,381
So what are you saying?
Act more?

256
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,917
No. Care less.

257
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:46,522
Ahh!

258
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:48,956
Whoo! Yeah!

259
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,790
Yeah, look at me,
look at me.

260
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,334
See? See, Mommy?
See? See?

261
00:17:57,468 --> 00:18:02,371
Any one got a vacuum cleaner
like that for a nose ain't
no cabron, Mommy. Right?

262
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:05,704
I hope you're right. Cause you're
the one who bring him here.

263
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,301
Mommy, come on.
He's cool. I promise.

264
00:18:15,953 --> 00:18:18,513
- You want one, Mommy?
- No.

265
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:21,683
I want to count
the money.

266
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,784
Man!

267
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,921
Yo, Miguel, man.
Moms..

268
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:31,297
Moms ain't no joke, man. Damn.
She don't trust nobody, man.

269
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,370
- Mommy?
- Que?

270
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:37,373
Sit and have a drink with us.

271
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:40,103
Long as he's been
felt good for wire.

272
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:47,044
Breakin' my chops.
What's up, man?

273
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:49,619
Shit.

274
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,484
- What's wrong with the reception?
- Got a wire loose.

275
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,081
- You mean you messed up.
- Hey, he's got it on
his balls, for Christ sake.

276
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:58,321
They got a mind of their own.
I mean, he snorted some coke,
he's sweating and it shorted.

277
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,863
Hey, quiet.

278
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,695
I'm sayin', come on with
all of that, man. Miguel.

279
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:07,760
- What's up, man?
- Dude, just two seconds, man.
It ain't nothin'.

280
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:09,999
- Yo, what's the problem, dude?
- It's not about that, man.

281
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,271
You want this money or what?
Ain't nobody feelin' me up for no wire.

282
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:17,404
Yo, yo, yo. You ain't gonna
be doin' business period,
you take that tone in my house.

283
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:20,075
I ain't feelin' that right there.
You got this money right here.

284
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:24,746
Yo, you better step the fuck off.
Don't disrespect me in my house.

285
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:29,416
- Goddamn it. She grabbed his balls.
- Move in. Move in. All units.

286
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:31,791
Move in now. Officer
in distress. Move it!

287
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,799
Shoot the mother fucker!

288
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:53,873
Don't fucking move!

289
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:04,419
What's going on here?

290
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:09,257
- Stay back. You can't go..
- Mommy! Mommy!

291
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:15,503
Mommy!

292
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:17,540
Thanks for nothin'.

293
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:58,080
I put my life on the line
for you, Preston.

294
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:03,546
The least I expect is somebody
to have my back out there, man.

295
00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:05,554
- All right. I'm sorry.
- What happened, man?

296
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:08,716
I don't fuckin' know.
Some freak thing with the wire.

297
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:12,227
Last think I heard in there,
you were fine, and then the
mother grabbed your nuts.

298
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:18,500
"Grabbed"? She practically
ripped 'em off.

299
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,969
I know, man.
Are you all right?

300
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,802
- Believe that?
- Are you all right?

301
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:25,875
- Yeah. Yeah.
- If you want some relief,
Jeff, you just tell me.

302
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,342
No, no, no, no, no. I just
got a little pumped, that's all.

303
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,380
- All right. You sure?
- Yeah. I'm cool.

304
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:32,779
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm in the zone, baby.

305
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:35,249
So you're ready
for the big score?

306
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,484
- I got in this line of work
for the big score, man.
- Good.

307
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,717
I'm going to make you
a very happy man.

308
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:44,454
You're going after God.

309
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,562
J. Reid.

310
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:53,762
You got me out in the
cold, man. What's up?

311
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:55,930
- BreezyT.
- Traffic bad in Akron?

312
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:57,973
- No, it's all right. Yeah.
- You all right?

313
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:00,009
- You ready to make this happen?
- Let's do this.

314
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,746
Dwayne Gittens
is his real name.

315
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:05,781
Comes all the way
from New Jersey.

316
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:07,942
We haven't been able to get
any body near him,

317
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:12,113
but we figure he's hooked in to
about 80% of the crack in this city.

318
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:14,054
- Hold the bag, Tique.
- I got you.

319
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:16,956
He's using the projects as his base.

320
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:19,586
Word is, though, he's
spreading out state wide.

321
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:25,728
- Tique! Hold the fuckin' bag!
- I'm holdin' it.

322
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:28,964
If you let this bag move one more
time, I'm gonna break yourjaw.

323
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:31,337
- Hold the bag.
- I hear you. I hear you.

324
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:37,581

00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:54,790

Come here.

Any parent,

or wandering fucking dog...

336
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,613

your tree this Christmas, all right?

337
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:20,516
Stupid ass. So fuckin'

spendin' his own money.

338
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:25,762
God, this here's J. Reid.

This brother's turnin' out to be...

00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:30,496
a top customer
and a down brother.

00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:33,161
Oh, yeah? J. Reid, huh?

From Akron.

346
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,816
From Akron?

347
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:49,249
I didn't know they was gettin'
no money in Akron.

348
00:23:49,353 --> 00:23:52,618
Well, if you don't say nothin',

I keep makin' money, you know?

349
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:55,658

Get the fuckin' mitts.
Don't ever interrupt me, man.

354
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:14,043
- What the fuck
did you do to your hair?
- Come on, man.

355
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,735
Well, I say, uh,

You were excellent

361
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,558
Yeah, maybe me and him
can go a couple of rounds, you know?

362
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,628
Right now, I'm trying
to make this deal.

363
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:07,788
We'll see about a deal,
but God ain't gonna deal direct
until he check you out fully.

364
00:25:07,898 --> 00:25:09,798
Life's a breeze.
You know what I'm sayin'?

365
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,300
- Life's a breeze?
- Life's a breeze.

366
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:30,478
Looking good.
What's going on?

00:25:33,858 --> 00:25:36,793
But you know, I wanted to talk

You know, so housing is

00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:46,392
And-And I can't play the
damn welfare no more,
you know what I'm sayin'?

372
00:25:46,537 --> 00:25:49,097
You ain't got to tell me
that shit. I was raised on it.
You know what I mean?

373
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,801
And-And-And, you know,
I don't know what else to do,

374
00:25:52,943 --> 00:25:55,537
So I want to talk to you

375
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:58,114

Well, they be tellin' me

00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:07,514

00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:10,059
Look, this is how God's

We gonna set up shop in your
apartment, you know, make it
a little part-time office.

382
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:16,592
It's gonna be strictly business.
I'm gonna take care of your rent.

383
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,294
I'm gonna take care of everything.
And if you get a little itch,

384
00:26:19,436 --> 00:26:21,631
I'll scratch it for you,

385
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:24,707
- I don't do that no more.
I told you that.
- I'm proud of you.

386
00:26:24,842 --> 00:26:27,003
I'm proud of you, all right?
Real proud of you.

387
00:26:27,144 --> 00:26:31,672
So look. I'm gonna send
Breeze and Che around Monday,

388
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:34,649
We're gonna put a
little paper in your pocket.
We're gonna take care of you.

389
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:37,619
All right? You're gonna
be straight. All right?

390
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,622
Meantime, you go over there, get
you some of that sweet potato pie.

391
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,783
- It's bangin'.
Miss Johnson made it.
- All right.

392
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,453
- All right?
- I appreciate this, God.

393
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,929
God is with you.
All right.

394
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:53,799
Hey, little man. Enjoy yourself.
Eat somethin', all right?

395
00:26:58,108 --> 00:27:01,271
Whoo! Nisey be

- Nisey who?
- Nisey, right there.

397
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,008
The girl who just smiled
at you with her pussy.

398
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:08,584
- You better go get some of that. Huh?
- Yeah, maybe.

399
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:12,417
"Maybe"? Fuck the maybe.
You better get some of
that pie while it's hot.

400
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:14,957
- What's up, God?
- What's up, dude?

401
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,960
J. here didn't have no
place to go for, uh,

00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:20,929
this day of Thanksgiving, so
I brought him with, you know?

403
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:23,591
Want him to see what sort of
organization he's dealing with.

404
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:26,534
What you see?

405
00:27:26,637 --> 00:27:28,935
Look to me like

408
00:27:33,544 --> 00:27:35,637
I got this little thing
of my own back home, you know?

409
00:27:35,746 --> 00:27:39,011
- That's good. Yo, Pam! Frisco!

410
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:43,884

- How my baby doin'?
- Kickin' like a bitch.

415
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,626
Don't be callin' my baby
no bitch. That's gonna be
God's little princess.

416
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:59,134
- Give me a fuckin' break, Dwayne.
- Run your mouth, huh?

417
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,531
- Yeah, I'm all right.

You know what I mean?

418
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:06,768
That don't mean nothin'

420
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:13,112
Smart-mouth here's

This is Frisco.

422
00:28:15,853 --> 00:28:18,287
- That's my man. We grew up
together in Newark.
- Peace.

423
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:22,753
Word up. He's gonna be
my baby's godfather.

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,795
- No, no, no, no, no.
Our baby's godfather.
- Our baby's godfather.

425
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:28,490
- Don't start no trouble, man.
- Shut up, nigger.

426
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,658
Yo, you better watch out

He stronger than he look.

427
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:33,601
Oh, yeah? So you like
shootin' joints, kid?

428
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:35,729
A little somethin', you know?

429
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:39,331
- Yo, yo. You holdin'?
- I'm holdin', baby.
I'm holdin' it all.

430
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:41,774
- All right.
I'm feelin' that.
- What you need?

431
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,779
Hey, man. Whatever, man.
You know?

432
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:45,815
Rock, AK, shoddy-body,
whatever.

433
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:48,510
Yo, lines, trees,

434
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:51,247
- Got a necklace

- Uh-huh.

435
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,188
Hold it, now.

436
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:56,691
Get up on it! Hurry up, man!

437
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,428
- Do it!

You got him, man!

438
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,431
Damn.

439
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,627
Give me the uwap!
What's wrong with you?

440
00:29:05,736 --> 00:29:10,036
- Come on!
- What's wrong with y' all? I had him.

441
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,836
I'm a little disgusted with you.
I thought you could shoot.

442
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:15,638
Why you not give me the uwap?
I had the cat right there.

443
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:18,180
- Come on!
- Turn this shit around!

444
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:21,080
All that shootin',
and you ain't hit nothin'.

445
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:23,085
- What's up, G?
- What's up, baby?

446
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:25,018
Chillin'.

447
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:28,023
Did your man J. Reid
murder these mother fuckers or what?

448
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,525
- He's crazy.
- That nigger..
He didn't murder nothin'.

449
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:32,527
- What do you mean?
- He can't shoot.

450
00:29:32,629 --> 00:29:35,530
He emptied out the whole
joint and asked for the Uzi.

451
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:38,032
I'm, like, with
that whack-ass aim..

452
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:40,035
So how you know
he ain't frontin'?

453
00:29:40,137 --> 00:29:44,039
Listen, the way he was shootin' up
and all that, he's on point.

454
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:46,575
- I would vouch for that, for real.
- You'd vouch for that?

455
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:48,577
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

456
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:51,580
So this is what you gon' do..

kids. What's their names?

457
00:29:51,682 --> 00:29:53,582
- Ozzie and Gash.
- Ozzie and Gash.

458
00:29:53,684 --> 00:29:56,585
Whatever the fuck his name is,
you put him with them, let him do that.

459
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:59,713
- If that pans out, let 'em pray to God.
- Send it through.

460
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:06,624
So, you comin' back
tonight, baby?

461
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,631
What, you don't

462
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:12,634
Well, when you get it,
and it's good,

463
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,636
you wanna keep gettin' it.

464
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,706
- Yeah?

465
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,104
So, what's up?
You got a woman in Akron?

466
00:30:22,846 --> 00:30:26,441
For your information, no, l
don't have a woman. All right?

467
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,450
In Akron
or anywhere else.

468
00:30:28,552 --> 00:30:30,611
That's what I want to hear.

469
00:30:32,723 --> 00:30:35,624
- Why I gotta go through
this with you every time?
- What about mean you?

470
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:38,627
- I told you I gotta do somethin'!
- Huh?

471
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:42,790
- It's always Gash!
- Every day it's the same
thing with you, man!

472
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,424
- Hey, Nisey.
- What's up, girl?

473
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:46,628
Come here, man! What the
fuck is wrong with you?

474
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:50,605
- You don't fuckin' listen, man!
- Shit.

475
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:59,946
- Damn.
- What the fuck are you doin'?

476
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,042
You stupid mother fucker!

477
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,554
Come on, get up, man.
I ain't even kicked you
that fuckin' hard.

478
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,225
- Aw, look at you.
- No, man.

479
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,227
Fall on the ground.

480
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,160
You all right, man?

481
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:17,961
What you askin' for?
You just kicked her in her butt.

482
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,968
Bastard.

483
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,970
- Later.
- Get on out of here.

484
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:23,972
What's up with you, dog?

485
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:27,941
- You can't be smackin'
on your girl like that.
- I ain't slap her.

486
00:31:28,045 --> 00:31:31,446
I'm sayin' let's go do this.
You got me out here waitin'.

487
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:33,948
- Yo.
- You was waitin' for
two minutes, man.

488
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:37,384
Don't worry about it.
God wants us to hook you up,
we goin' hook you up.

489
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:47,896
Y'all niggers better be
comin' on with some uncut...

490
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:51,490
to bring me all the way
out to Newport, man.

491
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:53,536
We'll set you up real nice.

492
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,969
You know we got
the good stuff.

493
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:59,008
I thought y'all worked
out of Horton Park.

494
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:02,044
I thought you was
from fuckin' Akron.

495
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:05,410
-Akron.
- What the hell you know
about where God do business?

496
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,784
Just sit tight, dog.

497
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:12,447
We be there in, like,
less than five minutes.

498
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:15,719
Hey, yo, what the fucky' all
used to do out in Akron anyway?

499
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:18,192
Y'all used to
deal corn and shit?

500
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:35,844
- Where the hell we goin', man?
- Downstairs, nigger.

501
00:32:35,946 --> 00:32:38,847
Gonna take care
of this bitch.

502
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:40,849
I like them chains, dog.

503
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:43,943
Gonna get me some chains
just like that.

504
00:32:44,054 --> 00:32:45,954
What's up?
They payin' y'all too?

505
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:48,957
No. They say we gotta
prove ourselves first.

506
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:51,459
That's just what we gonna do..
prove ourselves.

507
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,962
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
We want all the money, man,
and them chains you got on.

508
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:56,965
This how God
do business?

509
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:59,831
No, this how Ozzie and Gash do
business. Where the money at, man?

510
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,462
Fuck that, Oz!
Do this thing!

511
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,540
Oz, come on, man!

512
00:33:47,617 --> 00:33:49,517
Jesus Christ.

513
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:52,520
- Hello?
- Some crazy shit
just happened, man.

514
00:33:52,622 --> 00:33:55,352
These mother fuckers
tried to kill me.

515
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:58,360
- Jeff?
- Wake the fuck up, Preston!

516
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:01,863
- These two cats
tried to take me out, man!
- Are you all right?

517
00:34:01,965 --> 00:34:04,866
They just tried to fuckin'
kill me. Oh, shit.

518
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:08,233
- Did anybody see you? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

519
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,238
- Did anybody see you?
- No.

520
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,240
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

521
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,139
Okay. I'm pullin' you out.

522
00:34:14,277 --> 00:34:16,177
- What?
- I'm pullin' you out.

523
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:20,849
- What are you talkin' about?
I can't do that.
- I'm doin' it.

524
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:23,852
I'm gonna call Wilson.
Meet me at the spot in 45 minutes.

525
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:27,412
- Are you crazy, man?
We're gonna blow the whole thing.
- This is not a suggestion, Jeff.

526
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:31,221
This is an order. You
do what I tell you to do.

527
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:33,990
Hello? Hello?

528
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:43,505
Yeah, yeah.
Who the fuck is it?

529
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:46,508
It's J. Reid, man.
I need to talk to you.

530
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,804
Chill out. You
gon' wake my daughter.

531
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:52,847
- I wanna talk to you.
- Hey, man, what's up? What's up?

532
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:55,850
- "What's up"? I'm still alive.
That's what's up, nigga.
- What the fuck..

533
00:34:55,952 --> 00:34:58,853
- Put the gun down, baby.
- Couple of your boys
just tried to kill me.

534
00:34:58,955 --> 00:35:00,855
- What?
- You tryin' to play me?

535
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:03,858
I ain't tryin' to play you.
All right?

536
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,860
Hey, hey, listen.

537
00:35:05,962 --> 00:35:08,863
Ain't the way we do business.
You know that, J.

538
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:12,435
- You oughta know who you
got workin' for you, dog.
- I know who l got workin' for me.

539
00:35:12,502 --> 00:35:16,632
Maybe they was gonna
try to impress God with
some bullshit. Right?

540
00:35:16,773 --> 00:35:20,334
They new to the fam, J.
That's it. My word.

541
00:35:20,444 --> 00:35:24,778
My word. You tell me where they at,
we'll do 'em right now.

542
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:28,612
Last time I saw Ozzie,
he was bleedin' like a little bitch.

543
00:35:28,718 --> 00:35:31,619
Gash scream
when I shot his dick off.

544
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:34,622
That's what they get
for fuckin' with an O.G.
ike you, right, nigger?

545
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:37,625
Let me make a call.
I'll get you the blow
tonight if you need it.

546
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,161
- No. No.
I'm not tryin' to..
- We'll make it square.

547
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,164
- I'm gon' take my money
where it's appreciated.
- We appreciate it.

548
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,133
- We'll make this deal square.
- You tryin' to play me, man.

549
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,136
Come on, baby. We can
still make this square.
Why it gotta be that?

550
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,968
Why it gotta be
like this sh..

551
00:36:28,245 --> 00:36:30,645
Shit.

552
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:37,820
Damn, Pres.

553
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:41,948
In the dark, layin' in the cut..
You gon' get yourself shot.

554
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,396
I expect my officers
to obey a direct order.

555
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,399
What I don't expect is having
to go to their apartments...

556
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,435
to fucking say so.

557
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,507
Let me tell you somethin'
about your direct order..
it could've got me killed out there!

558
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:01,170
I'm the one in there!
I'm the one doin' it!
It's gonna be my call!

559
00:37:01,311 --> 00:37:04,212
It's gonna be my call whether
you stay on this case or not.

560
00:37:04,314 --> 00:37:07,340
I got seven other officers, seven
other, working undercover.. good ones..

561
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:10,318
and none of them
fuck with me but you.

562
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:14,787
Yeah, none of 'em can do
what I can do either, Pres,
and don't you forget that.

563
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:18,292
Why are you in such a hurry
to end up in a box?

564
00:37:18,395 --> 00:37:22,456
That's exactly where I would be
if I didn't show 'em J. Reid
could handle himself!.

565
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:25,899
You ain't out there, man.
You don't understand what's goin' on.

566
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:27,902
Well, maybe
you'll understand this:

567
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:31,565
You're out of the God business.
You're off the case.
Hand me your gun and badge.

568
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,609
- What?
- I said give me your gun and badge.

569
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,804
You're off the case.

570
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,720
Are you serious?

571
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:47,722
Let's go.

572
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:55,096
I'll find you a
safe place to stay.

573
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:58,656
- God and his boys'll think
you went back to Akron.
- Whatever.

574
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,035
Sorry, kid.
You disobeyed a director oder.

575
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,040
This is the way it works.

576
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,631
Somebody used the place
as a drug lab...

577
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,826
until the D.E.A.
busted them a year ago.

578
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,962
They haven't gotten around
to auctioning it off yet,
so stay as long as you need.

579
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:39,235
Listen, the only hobby you
ever mentioned is photography,

580
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:42,243
so I made arrangements
at a college nearby...

581
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:43,993
if you want to
take some courses.

582
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:48,378
Every cop who's been
undercover as long as you
have needs a break, Jeff.

583
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:51,386
Just think of it
as rural R&R.

584
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:07,634
Well, somebody was
supposed to come out here
and clean this place up,

585
00:39:07,737 --> 00:39:09,671
but obviously they didn't.

586
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:14,107
I can at least guarantee you
you will not run into anybody
who knows J. Reid around here. So..

587
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,110
All right.

588
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:20,045
Oh, yeah. Well..

589
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,051
A little dusting,
you know, you'll..

590
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,984
You'll be all right.

591
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:29,787
Preston, it's like
a tomb in here, man.

592
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:32,726
I-I'm a city boy.
I can't do this. Come on.

593
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,729
What do you want me
to tell you?

594
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,732
You can stay here
and get your shit together,

595
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,735
or you can quit the force
and lead an ordinary life.

596
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,737
Those are your choices,
so..

597
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,773
Thanks.

598
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:47,274
Look, I never been too good
at ordinary.

599
00:39:47,377 --> 00:39:49,436
I know.

600
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,689
Something bothering you,
Mr. Cole?

601
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:45,234
Yeah, actually, I'd like to move
that light hitting her face.

602
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:03,649
Could you hurry up?
I have to pee.

603
00:41:06,055 --> 00:41:07,955
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hi.

604
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:09,957
I'm, uh..
I'm Jeff.

605
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:11,959
Myra.

606
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:14,894
Um, I was just wonderin'
if, uh..

607
00:41:14,998 --> 00:41:17,899
- I don't drink coffee.
- Excuse me?

608
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:21,903
I don't drink coffee,
and I don't date the men
at my nude class.

609
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:24,064
Okay.

610
00:41:24,174 --> 00:41:26,039
It's cool, you know.

611
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:30,178
You're a dancer, huh?

612
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,441
- What?
- You dance, right?

613
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:34,449
How did you know that?

614
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:37,452
'Cause you have posture
like a dancer, you know.

615
00:41:37,554 --> 00:41:39,454
Back upright,
shoulders down.

616
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,591
Yes, actually, I, um..
I am a dancer.

617
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:47,925
But we're on hiatus right now,
so I teach ballet part-time
and I also model.

618
00:41:48,031 --> 00:41:50,124
That's cool.
That's cool.

619
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:53,133
Well, see, actually,
I was just wonderin',

620
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:57,228
'cause I'm finishing up my
portfolio and I need a model.

621
00:41:57,373 --> 00:42:02,538
So I was wonderin' if maybe
I could hire you to pose.

622
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,545
Strictly professional.

623
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:06,842
"Strictly professional."

624
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:09,817
- You can keep your clothes on.
- Oh, thanks.

625
00:42:12,255 --> 00:42:14,086
Oh, you're so cute!

626
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,124
Oh!

627
00:42:16,226 --> 00:42:21,129
You didn't tell me you had a puppy.
My God, he's adorable.

628
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:24,166
Miles is not quite a
puppy. He's a wolf.

629
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,200
You're kidding me, right?

630
00:42:26,302 --> 00:42:28,395
Nuh-uh.

631
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:37,842
So, what made you
name him Miles?

632
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:39,847
After the man himself.

633
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:41,849
Miles Davis.

634
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:44,044
What you know about Miles?

635
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,423
I like Miles.

636
00:42:50,827 --> 00:42:53,227
Actually, I love Miles.

637
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:55,388
Move over here
for a second.

638
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,801
Why don't you just
let me do my thing?

639
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:04,138
Excuse me, mama.
Go ahead, do your thing.

640
00:43:06,276 --> 00:43:08,176
Just do it. Okay?

641
00:43:10,446 --> 00:43:12,346
So?

642
00:43:12,448 --> 00:43:14,348
So what?

643
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,350
So, what do you do?

644
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:20,854
- I'm an actor.
- Yeah, right.

645
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:23,858
Why?
What do you think I do?

646
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:28,963
I think you're puttin 'me on,
is what I think.

647
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,965
Okay, okay.

648
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,306
I'm a cop.

649
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,976
Really?

650
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,982
Really.

651
00:43:49,953 --> 00:43:51,853
Really nice.

652
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:57,625
Very nice.

653
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,329
I mean the girl.

654
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:08,765
I-I..
I think she's beautiful.

655
00:44:08,871 --> 00:44:12,807
So, seems like you two are
gettin' along pretty well.

656
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:15,844
Are you askin' me if
we're sleeping together?

657
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:18,880
No, no. I was just
making an observation.

658
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:21,382
Easy.

659
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:24,112
This one's special, Pres.

660
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,051
Watch yourself.

661
00:44:26,155 --> 00:44:28,453
I'm glad you're doing
so well ,Jeff.

662
00:44:28,558 --> 00:44:32,790
Personally, I think I'm doin'
well enough to go back in.

663
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,455
- We'll see.
- What do you mean, "we'll see"?

664
00:44:36,566 --> 00:44:38,295
I mean,
we'll see.

665
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:42,904
I'm just thinking, what would my
mom think if I brought you home?

666
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:45,704
What would she think?
What do you think?

667
00:44:46,229 --> 00:44:49,130
I think she would think
you're pretty cute.

668
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:02,659
What about my moms?

669
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:06,197
I don't think my moms' take
too kindly to me datin' a dancer...

670
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:08,391
and a part-time
nude model.

671
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:15,404
Nah, I dig it.
I dig it.

672
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:17,702
- I think my moms would love you.
- You do?

673
00:45:35,406 --> 00:45:36,559
What a sexy!

674
00:45:37,508 --> 00:45:38,704
Right there. Right there.

675
00:45:39,962 --> 00:45:41,486
- Oh!
- Beat me up.

676
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,530
Sorry.
Did I get your eye?

677
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:49,835
Ooh, honey, I'm hungry.
Could you go get me a hot dog?

678
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:52,031
Please?
Please, please, please?

679
00:45:52,174 --> 00:45:54,734
- I got your hot dog right here.
- Oooh!

680
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,435
Hold this. I'll be back.

681
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:07,087
See that?

682
00:46:07,189 --> 00:46:09,089
Yeah!

683
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:11,455
- You're Dan Connelly.
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

684
00:46:12,595 --> 00:46:14,426
- Guilty.
- How you doin'?

685
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,431
I'm...Jeff Cole, Officer.

686
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:20,468
I was workin' with
Preston D'Ambrosio in Cincinnati.

687
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,470
We first met when you were assigned
to the Dwayne Gittens case.

688
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,439
- Oh, right. I remember.
- Hey, Daddy, I wanna
see the seagulls.

689
00:46:26,509 --> 00:46:28,409
- Okay, sweetie.
- You wanna see them too?

690
00:46:28,511 --> 00:46:30,741
- Go with Mommy.
- Bye-bye.

691
00:46:30,846 --> 00:46:33,246
We'll be up on the deck, Dan.

692
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:35,544
I'll be right there, honey.
Hold Mommy's hand.

693
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,020
Uh, yeah, you were involved
in the Batista case, right?

694
00:46:40,122 --> 00:46:42,056
- Great memory.
- You did some good work.

695
00:46:42,158 --> 00:46:44,183
Thank you.

696
00:46:44,293 --> 00:46:47,353
Something happened on the Gittens case,
they had to pull you, right?

697
00:46:47,463 --> 00:46:52,696
I was just wonderin' if you
got anybody undercover now..
State, D.E.A., anybody.

698
00:46:52,802 --> 00:46:57,364
We keep tryin' to get in deep
enough to get his main
supplier, but no one lasts.

699
00:46:57,506 --> 00:47:00,634
Either they get made, or it seems
too risky and they want out.

700
00:47:00,743 --> 00:47:03,644
Mmm.
So what's your plan?

701
00:47:03,746 --> 00:47:08,080
We pull Gittens off the streets
on tax evasion charges,
hope we can make it stick.

702
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:11,085
Look, he'll plea-bargain after
two, three years tops, easy.

703
00:47:11,187 --> 00:47:14,520
Well, at the moment
I don't have an alternative.

704
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,017
Put me back in.

705
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,028
I promise you, I'll get you
somethin' to crucify the bastard.

706
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,463
- How can you be sure?
- Nobody can get in as deep as me.

707
00:47:25,868 --> 00:47:29,304
If you want God and his
angels down for good,

708
00:47:29,405 --> 00:47:31,305
put me in.

709
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,611
What's happenin', Pres?
We meetin' early this week or what?

710
00:47:37,713 --> 00:47:39,613
You know goddamn well
what's happenin'.

711
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:42,343
I got called into
State Attorney Connelly's
office this morning.

712
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:44,248
Did you know that?

713
00:47:44,353 --> 00:47:47,720
- So, did you tell him I'm out of
my fuckin' mind or somethin'?
- Yeah, somethin' like that.

714
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:52,157
- I talked to the chief
about getting you fired.
- So why am I not fired?

715
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:55,662
Because Rick Scott of the
D.E.A. and Connelly got to
the chief before I did.

716
00:47:55,764 --> 00:47:59,700
Somehow they're all convinced
that you can single-handedly
bring down Dwayne Gittens.

717
00:47:59,802 --> 00:48:03,169
- I can.
- No, you can't. Not
by yourself, you can't.

718
00:48:03,305 --> 00:48:06,706
Look, the longer it
takes me to get back in,
the harder it's gonna be.

719
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:10,301
You know that.
Just trust me on this, man.

720
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:53,487
What's up?

721
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:01,353
They want you to go
back in, don't they?

722
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,910
So were you gonna
tell me, or.. or what?

723
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:20,608
Was I just supposed
to figure it out?

724
00:49:20,716 --> 00:49:24,777
Look, I've been straight
with you from the beginning,
all right, Myra?

725
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:28,288
And that's it? That's it?
Just like that? That's it?

726
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:31,383
What are you talkin' about?
I'm gonna be back.

727
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:34,019
It's not even that big of a
deal, man. It's just my thing.

728
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:38,362
Everybody has their thing.
Like, you wanted to be a dancer
since you were little girl, right?

729
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:41,436
Yeah, but not every
little boy growing up
in the projects...

730
00:49:41,537 --> 00:49:43,664
wants to be an
undercover cop, okay?

731
00:49:47,209 --> 00:49:49,837
Baby, you don't understand.
When I was growin' up in the projects,

732
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:54,280
there was this huge gray wall
that surrounded the whole thing.

733
00:49:54,383 --> 00:49:57,318
I never figured out if the city
put it up to keep the residents in...

734
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,717
or to keep the scum out.

735
00:49:59,889 --> 00:50:02,585
But, you know, they decided
that the wall needed decoratin',

736
00:50:02,692 --> 00:50:08,289
so they got all the
graffiti artists together,
and they covered the wall.

737
00:50:08,397 --> 00:50:10,695
They covered it with
the names and the ages,

738
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:15,237
sometimes the faces,
of every kid that got killed
in the neighborhood.

739
00:50:15,338 --> 00:50:18,865
I had to pass that
wall, you know,

740
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:21,169
Leavin' home
or comin' in.

741
00:50:21,277 --> 00:50:23,541
Every day.

742
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:26,308
It was like one day
I was comin' home,

743
00:50:26,415 --> 00:50:30,010
passed the wall,
and itjust, like, hit me.

744
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,714
I just realized that
without even trying,

745
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:37,190
I memorized all the names
on the wall.

746
00:50:40,196 --> 00:50:44,064
The youngest kid,
his name was Daryl.

747
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,192
Daryl Rolley.

748
00:50:47,303 --> 00:50:49,430
He was only three years old.

749
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:58,743
That's when I decided that
I wanted to do somethin'.

750
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:04,849
I-I wanted to
make things change.

751
00:51:17,085 --> 00:51:19,747
Hey, come on, man.
We gotta hustle, all right?

752
00:51:19,888 --> 00:51:22,686
I told God you were in Akron.
He thought it was real smart...

753
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,453
for you to disappear
till things chilled out.

754
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,060
Hey, yo. What's up?

755
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,566
- What up, Breezy?
- Word. What up?

756
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:46,111
Do you, Sidney and Martha,
swear before God...

757
00:51:46,214 --> 00:51:48,739
that you will protect
Anwar Sidney Gittens...

758
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,546
from any misfortune that
may befall his parents?

759
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:53,621
- Yes, indeed.
- Yes.

760
00:51:53,722 --> 00:51:56,850
Will the members of the immediate
family please come forward?

761
00:52:02,163 --> 00:52:04,063
That's a beautiful boy,
ain't it?

762
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,533
He's feeling a little better?
All right.

763
00:52:08,637 --> 00:52:10,628
How you doin'?
Thanks for comin'.

764
00:52:14,876 --> 00:52:17,970
- Peace.
- You okay, Nisey?

765
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,152
Take him to the car.

766
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,233
Okay.
Come on, you.

767
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:42,860
- What's up, J.? What's goin' on?
- What's up, baby?

768
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:46,065
- How you been, man? You all right?
- What's up?

769
00:52:46,174 --> 00:52:49,701
- Got a little something for you.
- All right, cool.

770
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:52,405
Did you see the ceremony?

771
00:52:52,514 --> 00:52:55,347
- Oh, no doubt, man.
Yo, congratulations, man.
- Thanks, man.

772
00:52:55,450 --> 00:53:00,046
He may sound soft, man, but
he's gonna be somethin' one day.

773
00:53:00,155 --> 00:53:03,591
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah, definitely.

774
00:53:03,692 --> 00:53:05,592
- Yo, Frisco?
- Yeah.

775
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:08,992
I'm gonna hold you
to them words, brother.

776
00:53:09,097 --> 00:53:11,361
That's my word
from the heart.

777
00:53:11,466 --> 00:53:14,594
I'll tell you somethin'.
I'm with you all the way, man.
I love the baby boy.

778
00:53:14,703 --> 00:53:18,400
Ain't nothin' gonna happen
to that baby that don't
happen to me first.

779
00:53:18,506 --> 00:53:21,839
- I love you.
- Love you too, man.
Love you more.

780
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,712
What's going on, baby?
Where you been at, dog?

781
00:53:28,817 --> 00:53:32,048
Well, got a little..
got a little hectic back home.

782
00:53:32,153 --> 00:53:34,053
- You know?
- Word.

783
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:36,680
Yo, God, J. wants
to do a little business.

784
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:40,420
- Maybe later, huh?
- What ever you need,
you know I got it.

785
00:53:40,562 --> 00:53:44,362
- No doubt, you got it.
Everything, everything, baby.
- Yeah.

786
00:53:44,466 --> 00:53:47,958
- Lookin' good, man.
- Feelin' good, man.
It's been a good year, baby.

787
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:50,094
That's good, man.
That's good.

788
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:52,833
- Yo, um..
- What's up, man?

789
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:55,603
That thing that happened
over at the building?

790
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,577
No, no, no, no. The kid that went
to the hospital? Yeah.

791
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,205
He met with a little accident.
You dig what I'm sayin'?

792
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:03,614
Finito, all right?

793
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:06,653
He wasn't no good
without his dick no way.

794
00:54:06,755 --> 00:54:09,656
- My gift to you, huh? My man.
- All right.

795
00:54:09,758 --> 00:54:12,318
It's good to see you, kid. You
look good. As clean as a chitlin.

796
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,394
- Look at you. All right?
- I'll see you at the joint.

797
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:16,429
- All right, baby.
- I'll let you know, man.

798
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:18,431
- All right. Definitely
want to see you later.
- Stay out of trouble, baby.

799
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:20,433
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, yeah.

800
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:27,473
- What's up?
Yo, get my mans in, man.
- What's up?

801
00:54:27,575 --> 00:54:29,941
- All right, my brother.
- Get 'em up here.
How are you, dog?

802
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:31,944
- All right.

803
00:54:32,046 --> 00:54:33,946
Yeah, yeah.

00:54:37,085 --> 00:54:40,248
- What's up?
- What's up, baby? You smell good.

805
00:54:40,355 --> 00:54:44,189
- Have you seen God? What's up, bro?
- I haven't seen him all night.

806
00:54:57,205 --> 00:55:01,141
- Hi, J.
- What's up? How you doin',
baby? Lookin' good.

807
00:55:01,242 --> 00:55:04,678
- What's up, dog?

808
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:08,340
What's up, dude? Oh, come on, dog.

Yo, J.
Yo, J.

00:55:20,495 --> 00:55:22,690

00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:25,061
- How are you, baby?
- Chillin'. I'm chillin'.

812
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:27,657
You know what I'm say in'?
I'm just checkin' out the scenery.

813
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:29,827
- What's up?
- Lookin' fresh, you know.
Look at these jewels.

814
00:55:29,938 --> 00:55:31,838
You know how I do.
You know how I do.

815
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,636
Yeah, but check this shit
out I got in my pockets.

816
00:55:34,742 --> 00:55:36,903
- All new gold.
You know what I'm sayin'?
- Come on, man.

817
00:55:37,011 --> 00:55:40,344
- I got it.. Hold on. Check it out.
- You seen God?

818
00:55:40,448 --> 00:55:43,679
- Later for all that, man.
What? What, man?
- Come on, dog.

819
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:45,752
It's cool. You know what I'm
sayin'? Everything's cool.

820
00:55:45,854 --> 00:55:48,516
I got the smoke. You
know what I'm sayin'? We
can go chief one real quick.

821
00:55:48,623 --> 00:55:51,091
- Whatever. Let's go.
- Come on, dog.

822
00:55:53,494 --> 00:55:56,429
Need a nickel bump,
nickel bump, yeah, yeah.

823
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:58,931
- Yo, Che, hold up. Che, Che.
- What's up?

824
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:02,491
- Is that J. over there?
- Yeah, that's J.

825
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:04,834
He's goin' out back
with grimy-ass Melvin.

826
00:56:04,939 --> 00:56:08,431
- What would Melvin want with J.? Huh?
- I don't know.

827
00:56:08,543 --> 00:56:11,671
- He's up to somethin'.
- Yeah, he's definitely
up to somethin'.

828
00:56:11,779 --> 00:56:13,679
Wait, wait, wait.
Who did you say the other guy was?

829
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:17,911
- The other guy?
- Excuse us, lady.
We got to have a drink.

830
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:19,953
Wait.

831
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:28,225
- What's up, man?
You gonna smoke it all up?
- No, man.

832
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:32,095
- This is the good shit, baby.
That's the good shit.
- What's up with it?

833
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,725
"It's good shit."
Shit done went out, dog.

834
00:56:34,836 --> 00:56:37,270
- Light it up. You got it?
- Can't get no wind.

835
00:56:37,372 --> 00:56:40,000
Oh, shit!

836
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:43,407
Yeah. Remember that new gold
I was talkin' about in my pocket?

837
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:45,376
It's your shit, bitch.

838
00:56:46,681 --> 00:56:48,581
Yo! What the..

839
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:56,149
Yo, bring him up!
Bring him up! Come on!

840
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:59,658
You ain't done!
You ain't.. That's right!

841
00:57:01,896 --> 00:57:04,023
You don't fuck
with this family, bitch!

842
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:12,034
- You all right, J.?
- Yeah.

843
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,233
- Your boys always got your back.
- Yeah, baby.

844
00:57:14,342 --> 00:57:17,209
Yeah. Always, baby.

845
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:19,337
- Fuck 'im.
- Yeah, Melvin.

846
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:22,348
- Get your punk ass up, boy.
- Yeah, Melvin! Come on!

847
00:57:24,385 --> 00:57:27,582
- You sure you don't
want to shoot this man?
- Take that shit!

848
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:40,766
Yo. Yo.

849
00:57:40,868 --> 00:57:42,768
- J.
- What's up, man?

850
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,770
God wants to see you, man.

851
00:57:44,872 --> 00:57:46,897
All right, I'll come by
tomorrow or somethin'.

852
00:57:47,008 --> 00:57:50,102
- No, he wants
to see you today.
- I can't do it today.

853
00:57:50,211 --> 00:57:53,703
- I got something to do.
- He will be waiting for you
in the club at 4:00, all right?

854
00:57:53,815 --> 00:57:56,477
Come on, man.

855
00:58:08,763 --> 00:58:12,130
So this freak gonna tell me
she know this dude.

856
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:14,667
So you know, I'm like,
"Where'd you meet him from?"

857
00:58:14,769 --> 00:58:18,967
So she gonna be on some old,
"Yeah, he busted
a friend of my family."

858
00:58:19,073 --> 00:58:21,439
- You know what I mean?
So I'm like, "Busted?"
- What?

859
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:24,739
She said, "Yeah, that mother fucker
a cop. Fooled everybody."

860
00:58:24,846 --> 00:58:27,110
Talkin' about you without a doubt.
The pig that brought him down, man.

861
00:58:27,215 --> 00:58:30,150
- No, we were..
- You a cop, J. ?

862
00:58:31,953 --> 00:58:35,616
- What you think?
- I think you know
the answer to that, clown.

863
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:42,728
Well, girl, she gotta
be tellin' the truth.
Why is she just gonna lie?

864
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:45,492
- What are you sayin', she's
gotta be tellin' the truth?
- Just like I said, brother.

865
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,034
- You believin' everything these
tramps is out here talkin'?
- No, no.

866
00:58:48,136 --> 00:58:50,161
Huh? So then
what you talkin' about?

867
00:58:50,271 --> 00:58:52,637
- I put my man on it.
- You know all these broads
went in with the weight.

868
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,833
- Yo, Tique.
Tique, Tique, Tique.
- What?

869
00:58:54,942 --> 00:58:56,842
How long you know
this bitch?

870
00:58:56,944 --> 00:58:59,037
- For a few weeks.
- A few weeks.

871
00:58:59,147 --> 00:59:01,547
- Matter of fact,
bring the bitch down here.
- I ain't bringin' her nowhere.

872
00:59:01,649 --> 00:59:03,879
- Fuck that.
Bring that bitch down here.
- Get that shit out of here.

873
00:59:03,985 --> 00:59:07,182
See me smack her around
the fuckin' room, then you
ask her if I'm a fuckin' cop.

874
00:59:07,288 --> 00:59:09,188
- What's that shit mean to me?
- What you mean, what it mean to you?

875
00:59:09,323 --> 00:59:11,223
- You vouchin' for the bitch!
- I ain't vouchin' for shit!

876
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,259
- We here right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

877
00:59:13,327 --> 00:59:18,390
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I tell you what.
Don't you worry about it, J.

878
00:59:18,499 --> 00:59:21,059
- What you talkin',
don't worry about it, man?
- Yo, don't worry.

879
00:59:21,169 --> 00:59:23,831
She messin' up my money, dog.
She messin' up
my business with you, dog.

880
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:25,838
- She ain't messin' up nothin'.
- So what the fuck
is you talkin' about?

881
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,603
Calm down, cowboy.
Don't be screamin' in my
mother fuckin' office, dog.

882
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,610
- Relax.
- Yeah.

883
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:37,942
Come on down to the basement.
I wanna show you somethin'.

884
00:59:41,756 --> 00:59:45,351
Yo, yo, yo. Obviously, you
got some business to handle.

885
00:59:45,493 --> 00:59:48,792
I ain't got no mother fuck..
Just keep it movin'.

886
01:00:00,608 --> 01:00:03,042
You punk-ass,
bitch-ass nigga.

887
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:06,773
Thought you were badder, badder,
badder and badder, fool.

888
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:09,907
You ain't nothin' but
a lame-ass dude, huh?

889
01:00:10,017 --> 01:00:12,542
- You know, I know.
- Che, shut the fuck up.

890
01:00:12,653 --> 01:00:15,918
Oh, Frisco!

891
01:00:16,057 --> 01:00:19,288
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Say, yo, what's up
with all this, dog?

892
01:00:19,427 --> 01:00:21,691
I guess you see my man here
bleedin', all fucked up,

893
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:24,559
you say, "Damn, God,
what a foul nigger," right?

894
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:28,328
- I'm just sayin'..
- But you see, this here's
some fucked up shit.

895
01:00:28,436 --> 01:00:31,496
Me and this nigga went to
junior high together, played
in the mother fuckin' sandbox.

896
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:35,872
And out of all the bitches
in the world, you wanna try to
step to my baby's moms?

897
01:00:35,977 --> 01:00:39,674
- Yo, I was drunk, man.
- Man, shut the fuck up
that you was drunk!

898
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,840
Now I'm drunk
with revenge, mother fucker!

899
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,783
- All I did was tell her
she was beautiful, man.
- Shut up, man!

900
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,911
- Give me the pool stick.
- Come on, man.
We ain't gotta rock like this.

901
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:53,118
Ain't gotta rock like this?
We gonna rock like what?

902
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:57,992
Rock like what?

903
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,500
Give me another pool stick.

904
01:01:01,602 --> 01:01:03,502
What's up, J. Reid?

905
01:01:03,604 --> 01:01:07,665
- This is God's world.
- God, man.. Come on, man.

906
01:01:07,775 --> 01:01:10,539
- Let me go, man.
Why are you wildin' out?
- What? Why I'm wildin' out?

907
01:01:10,645 --> 01:01:12,545
- You're supposed to be my man.
- I am your man.

908
01:01:12,647 --> 01:01:16,981
Yo, God, come on, man.
Please, man. Yo.

909
01:01:17,084 --> 01:01:19,075
- And I'm gonna prove
it, mother fucker.
- I'm sorry, man.

910
01:01:24,992 --> 01:01:26,892
Love it!
Love it!

911
01:01:26,994 --> 01:01:30,395
Love it! Think about her!
Think about her!

912
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:32,590
Think about her!
Think about her!

913
01:01:32,733 --> 01:01:35,634
Think about her!
Think about her!

914
01:01:35,736 --> 01:01:39,695
- What do you mean, tortured?
- I mean, he beat
the kid half dead.

915
01:01:39,807 --> 01:01:43,334
- Why didn't you call
for immediate backup?
- It was a judgment call.

916
01:01:43,444 --> 01:01:47,574
Why blow the whole operation?
Look, he didn't kill the kid.

917
01:01:47,682 --> 01:01:49,650
How do you know he didn't?

918
01:01:51,953 --> 01:01:54,080
I don't need your shit, Wilson.

919
01:01:54,222 --> 01:01:57,453
- What is this, a fuckin' inquisition?
- No.

920
01:01:57,558 --> 01:02:01,426
We just have to make sure
you didn't take any part in this.

921
01:02:01,529 --> 01:02:04,657
Excuse me.
I know the procedure, okay?

922
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,734
Torturing a brother
is not my thing, all right?

923
01:02:07,835 --> 01:02:09,962
- All right.
- A brother?

924
01:02:10,071 --> 01:02:12,733
What the.. What the fuck
is your problem?

925
01:02:12,907 --> 01:02:16,468
I don't have a problem.
He may be your brother,
but he ain't no brother of mine.

926
01:02:16,577 --> 01:02:19,876
You know what, Pres?
You should've sat this bitch
down a long time ago.

927
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:22,745
- That's enough.
- Look, Cole.

928
01:02:25,586 --> 01:02:30,489
You know, you are
becoming just like the shit
we trying to throw down.

929
01:02:32,793 --> 01:02:35,762
Get out of my face.

930
01:02:35,863 --> 01:02:38,627
Go push some papers or somethin'.
You can't even get wires straight.

931
01:02:45,206 --> 01:02:48,505
- Okay.
- What was that?

932
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:51,305
What was that?

933
01:02:51,412 --> 01:02:55,212
- I'd say that was
totally unprofessional, Cole.
- Oh, you'd say?

934
01:02:55,316 --> 01:02:59,047
And who the fuck are you?
The D.E.A.?

935
01:02:59,153 --> 01:03:03,089
You can't even get a guy to go
undercover long enough without
asking for an extended vacation.

936
01:03:03,224 --> 01:03:06,284
At least I know
who the enemy is.

937
01:03:13,234 --> 01:03:15,395
Jeff?

938
01:03:15,503 --> 01:03:17,596
Wait there. Wait. Leave
him alone. Leave him alone.

939
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:19,673
He's totally out of control.

940
01:03:19,774 --> 01:03:22,834
That's why Gittens trusts
him. He believes him.

941
01:03:22,943 --> 01:03:25,275
Connelly was right.

942
01:03:25,379 --> 01:03:28,280
Nobody will ever
get in this far again.

943
01:03:30,418 --> 01:03:33,148
That's all you care about,
isn't it?

944
01:03:37,425 --> 01:03:40,826
Mmm. Here it comes.
Here it comes.

945
01:03:40,928 --> 01:03:43,726
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Yeah, yeah.

946
01:03:45,566 --> 01:03:47,466
Can I get
another cup of coffee?

947
01:03:52,106 --> 01:03:56,270
- Let me ask you boys somethin'.
- What's up?

948
01:03:58,212 --> 01:04:00,112
God treatin' you all right
with the money?

949
01:04:00,214 --> 01:04:04,583
He's payin'.
Banana money.

950
01:04:04,685 --> 01:04:08,177
Only real cash he layin'
out going to that posse
he come up from Jersey with.

951
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:11,747
Word. He ain't
gonna start payin' us
Cincinnati dudes, right,

952
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:13,883
till we prove ourselves.

953
01:04:14,028 --> 01:04:16,963
But he never say
when that is.

954
01:04:17,064 --> 01:04:20,522
Me and Che been bustin' our ass
for two fuckin' years now.

955
01:04:20,668 --> 01:04:23,603
Why don't you ask
him for a raise?

956
01:04:23,704 --> 01:04:28,038
- Give up.
- What?

957
01:04:28,142 --> 01:04:32,442
And wind up butt-ass
naked on his pool table?
I ain't feelin' that.

958
01:04:32,546 --> 01:04:35,947
Nah, ain't worth
the risk, man.

959
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:39,383
God got us where he wants
and he ain't givin' us no way out.

960
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,984
I tell you what.

961
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:52,831
It's on love, right?

962
01:04:52,933 --> 01:04:57,267
- It's on the love.
- Just a little somethin', you know?

963
01:04:57,371 --> 01:05:01,034
- Whoo!
- Show more love.

964
01:05:01,142 --> 01:05:03,736
Keep your mouth wet.

965
01:05:03,844 --> 01:05:06,039
What we gotta
do for this?

966
01:05:06,147 --> 01:05:08,047
- What you gotta do for it?
- Yeah.

967
01:05:08,149 --> 01:05:10,208
Why don't you get
that waitress' number for me.

968
01:05:12,353 --> 01:05:14,446
- Her? That's it?
- Yeah. That's it.

969
01:05:14,555 --> 01:05:18,616
For this? Yo, let me go
politic that right now.

970
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:29,864
J. Reid. You definitely know how
to treat a brother, huh?

971
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:40,547
Shit. Actin' like this,
you can be H.N.I.C. around here
if you's down for it.

972
01:06:09,877 --> 01:06:13,904
God, he's smart.

973
01:06:15,683 --> 01:06:18,550
He's just gonna keep findin'
a way to slip through the net.

974
01:06:20,588 --> 01:06:22,647
Till somebody takes him out.

975
01:06:24,091 --> 01:06:27,458
- It's simple and plain.
- It's not yourjob.

976
01:06:33,868 --> 01:06:36,359
Mother fucker's slippin', man.

977
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,166
Treats his boys like shit.

978
01:06:39,273 --> 01:06:43,767
Makes them feel scared
and under appreciated.

979
01:06:45,846 --> 01:06:48,041
I tell you what, though.

980
01:06:48,148 --> 01:06:53,780
One of them young cats,
them little mother fuckers, man,
they'd smoke him in a second.

981
01:06:56,924 --> 01:06:59,916
Hand the whole shit
over to me.

982
01:07:11,539 --> 01:07:14,838
When was the last time
you talked to Myra?

983
01:07:17,711 --> 01:07:22,239
Pres, that's none of
your fuckin' business.

984
01:07:29,056 --> 01:07:31,650
Myra's a good girl,
you know?

985
01:07:33,827 --> 01:07:37,729
She really is.

986
01:07:37,831 --> 01:07:40,391
She's all worried about me
gettin' fucked up and..

987
01:07:44,071 --> 01:07:47,404
Besides, man, I-I-I really don't think
she wants to see me anymore.

988
01:07:52,746 --> 01:07:56,807
Well, I think it might not be a
bad idea to give her a call anyway.

989
01:07:56,917 --> 01:08:00,250
Hear her voice.

990
01:08:00,354 --> 01:08:02,254
Let her know how you are.

991
01:08:10,097 --> 01:08:13,260
I, um..

992
01:08:16,036 --> 01:08:19,062
I..
I can't do this.

993
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:23,974
I don't know what you mean.
What are you talkin' about?

994
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:26,478
I can't live like this
anymore.

995
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,480
Live like what?

996
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,377
Like..

997
01:08:34,822 --> 01:08:37,518
Thank you.
Thank you.

998
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:41,152
Like wondering if I'm gonna
open the newspaper...

999
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:44,230
and see, "Undercover Cop
Killed In The Line Of Duty."

1000
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:48,461
- So why did you agree
to meet me here?
- Jeff, you have your life.

1001
01:08:48,569 --> 01:08:53,268
You're happy. It's fun.
Yourjob is exciting for you.
I'm happy for you.

1002
01:08:53,374 --> 01:08:56,901
I just know that I cannot
be a part of it anymore.

1003
01:09:07,087 --> 01:09:10,454
- See all these niggers out here?
- Mm-hmm.

1004
01:09:10,557 --> 01:09:13,651
Strugglin' to survive, man.

1005
01:09:13,794 --> 01:09:17,457
When you're strugglin' to survive,
you need somebody to follow.

1006
01:09:17,564 --> 01:09:21,193
So I figured,
why not give 'em God?

1007
01:09:21,301 --> 01:09:25,897
Like these freaks who let us
use their apartments for free.

1008
01:09:26,006 --> 01:09:29,464
It's not only that we payin'
their rent or give them a free
supply, whatever they're usin'.

1009
01:09:29,576 --> 01:09:33,205
That ain'tjust it.
Mother fuckers wanna feel like
they're a part of somethin'.

1010
01:09:33,313 --> 01:09:35,975
Man, black people in this country,

1011
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:39,712
they wanna feel like they
are a part of somethin'.

1012
01:09:39,853 --> 01:09:42,583
- No doubt.
- Stick around, J.

1013
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:44,590
I'm gonna school ya.

1014
01:09:47,795 --> 01:09:49,990
I ain't had nobody tight
since Frisco.

1015
01:09:50,097 --> 01:09:53,464
- You gotta do what you gotta do.
- Mother fuckin' right. I always do.

1016
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:57,059
Ain't that right, little man?
Yeah, that's my little man.

1017
01:09:57,171 --> 01:10:00,436
Let me ask you somethin',
dog. How much?

1018
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:04,477
- How much what?
- How much the empire worth?

1019
01:10:07,514 --> 01:10:09,505
Eleven million.

1020
01:10:09,616 --> 01:10:12,483
I can feel that.

1021
01:10:12,586 --> 01:10:15,316
I can feel that like a
mother fucker, man.

1022
01:10:15,422 --> 01:10:17,822
- Been lookin' for these mother fuckers.
- Who that?

1023
01:10:17,925 --> 01:10:20,393
Bitch Nisey and this nigger.

1024
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,279
No!

1025
01:10:39,379 --> 01:10:42,212
Leave him alone!

1026
01:10:42,316 --> 01:10:45,012
Leave him alone!

1027
01:10:47,588 --> 01:10:50,716
You and your man gonna rob
me, bitch? Gonna rob me?

1028
01:10:50,858 --> 01:10:52,723
Huh? You gonna rob me,
you stinkin' mother fucker?

1029
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,260
You guys got it wrong, man!
You got it wrong!

1030
01:10:55,362 --> 01:10:58,126
No!

1031
01:10:58,232 --> 01:11:00,564
- Get up! Get up!
- What the hell is wrong, man?

1032
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:04,398
Who the fuck is God? Point
at him! Point at him, bitch!

1033
01:11:16,016 --> 01:11:19,315
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Get the fuck up! Get up!

1034
01:11:19,419 --> 01:11:21,944
Put the mother fucker's arm
in the doorjam! Put him over here!

1035
01:11:22,089 --> 01:11:24,216
Put your arm in there, cowboy!
Put your arm in there, cowboy!

1036
01:11:24,358 --> 01:11:27,054
Take it! Take it!
Take it!

1037
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:30,324
Mother fucker! How does it feel?
Fuckin' faggot!

1038
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:32,955
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1039
01:11:33,066 --> 01:11:36,058
Where you go in', bitch?

1040
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:40,266
Get the fuck up!
Stinky mother fucker! Huh?

1041
01:11:40,374 --> 01:11:42,808
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth! Yeah.

1042
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:46,311
Yeah, you like that, huh?
Huh? Yeah, suck on it!

1043
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:50,008
You wanna suck on
the mother fuckin' pipe, right?
Suck on this, bitch! Yeah!

1044
01:11:50,117 --> 01:11:53,484
What you think ,J. ?
What you think, baby?

1045
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,613
Man, fuck this bitch, man.
She dyin' slow anyway, man.

1046
01:11:57,691 --> 01:12:01,127
You know, there's people
out here, dog. Come on.

1047
01:12:01,228 --> 01:12:03,560
Who am I, bitch?
Who am I?

1048
01:12:03,664 --> 01:12:06,326
- Who am I?
- God!

1049
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:19,877
That stinkin' mother
fuckin' bitch!

1050
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:22,210
Yo, what's up with
little man, man?

1051
01:12:22,316 --> 01:12:24,978
Nah, it smells like
he messed up his diaper.
You'll be all right, Boo-Boo.

1052
01:12:26,887 --> 01:12:31,085
Know what?
Before we done,

1053
01:12:31,225 --> 01:12:34,160
you and me gonna be runnin'
this whole state, man.

1054
01:12:34,261 --> 01:12:36,991
I don't know, man.

1055
01:12:38,298 --> 01:12:42,359
Look, you got my back,
I got yours.

1056
01:12:44,504 --> 01:12:48,372
I ain't never seen you
back down to nothin' or
nobody including me,

1057
01:12:48,475 --> 01:12:52,241
which means sooner or
later I'm gonna have to
murder you before you do me.

1058
01:12:54,615 --> 01:12:59,075
So you can make up your mind
one way or the other.

1059
01:12:59,186 --> 01:13:02,587
You'll be all right, Boo-Boo.
I know. I know.

1060
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:06,352
- I know. You okay?
- What's wrong, little man?

1061
01:13:06,493 --> 01:13:09,724
I know. I know.
It's cold.

1062
01:13:11,231 --> 01:13:14,530
Anyway, it's set up
for tomorrow night.

1063
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:17,103
Make up your mind
one way or the other,

1064
01:13:17,204 --> 01:13:21,300
'cause you ain't makin' a
contact unless you down solid.

1065
01:13:50,003 --> 01:13:52,665
- It is. That was good, though.
- It was good.

1066
01:13:52,773 --> 01:13:55,537
- I'll see you guys later.
- Bye.

1067
01:13:55,642 --> 01:13:58,736
- So, I think we're supposed to
be in at around 4:00 tomorrow.
- Sounds good to me.

1068
01:13:58,845 --> 01:14:02,975
Okay, see you. Bye.

1069
01:14:09,856 --> 01:14:11,721
What's up, girl?

1070
01:14:11,858 --> 01:14:14,156
I guess you just happened
to be driving by, huh?

1071
01:14:14,261 --> 01:14:18,163
Nah, nah. I've been out here
for, like, two hours.

1072
01:14:18,298 --> 01:14:22,291
Tried you at home.
I figured you were down here
doing your thing.

1073
01:14:23,704 --> 01:14:27,071
I was checkin' you out.
You looked pretty good up there.

1074
01:14:29,676 --> 01:14:32,941
Jeff, I thought we already..
I thought we talked about
this thing already.

1075
01:14:33,046 --> 01:14:35,742
I know, I know, I know.
I couldn't stay away.

1076
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:37,840
That's, you know..
That's why I didn't come
inside or nothin'.

1077
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,942
I didn't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

1078
01:14:42,022 --> 01:14:45,480
Um, listen, I've been, um,
modeling since this morning.

1079
01:14:45,592 --> 01:14:47,526
I've been rehearsing
all afternoon. I'm tired.

1080
01:14:47,627 --> 01:14:49,527
I just want to go home
and get into bed.

1081
01:14:49,629 --> 01:14:53,326
Baby, you can't hang out
for a few?

1082
01:14:53,433 --> 01:14:58,769
Huh? I just wanna talk to
you. I just wanna..
I just wanna hear your voice.

1083
01:15:01,308 --> 01:15:03,367
What's up, baby?

1084
01:15:03,477 --> 01:15:05,570
What's up?

1085
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,875
So, um, let me
ask you somethin'.

1086
01:15:10,984 --> 01:15:14,511
- That's your new boyfriend?
- Who?

1087
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:16,953
The boy over there
who was kissin' on you.

1088
01:15:17,057 --> 01:15:21,050
- Jeff, come on.
That's my dance partner.
- Oh, right.

1089
01:15:21,194 --> 01:15:23,094
Hmm.

1090
01:15:24,431 --> 01:15:26,331
You sleepin' with him?

1091
01:15:28,368 --> 01:15:30,802
No! What..
You know what?

1092
01:15:30,904 --> 01:15:33,566
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

1093
01:15:33,673 --> 01:15:37,666
I'm sorry. Close your door.
Close the door.

1094
01:15:39,112 --> 01:15:43,776
- What's wrong?
- Don't talk to me like that, okay?

1095
01:15:43,884 --> 01:15:46,352
He was over there kissin'
on you and all that, you know?

1096
01:15:46,453 --> 01:15:48,978
- We work together.
He's my friend, okay?
- I'm sorry.

1097
01:15:49,122 --> 01:15:51,386
- I'm not..
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1098
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:55,621
Let's start off fresh.
Give me a kiss, baby.

1099
01:15:55,762 --> 01:16:00,426
- I don't want a kiss. Jeff, I
don't want to kiss you right..
- Kiss me.

1100
01:16:02,936 --> 01:16:05,871
- What you runnin' away for?
What are you scared of, baby?
- Don't, Jeff!. Don't..

1101
01:16:05,972 --> 01:16:09,169
Damn!

1102
01:16:11,244 --> 01:16:13,542
Excuse me, ma'am,
is there a problem here this evening?

1103
01:16:13,647 --> 01:16:15,547
There's no problem
here, man.

1104
01:16:15,649 --> 01:16:19,608
- We just had an argument.
- Excuse me, sir. I was
talkin' to the lady.

1105
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:21,949
- Look, I'm a cop. I'm on the job.
- We just had an argument.

1106
01:16:22,089 --> 01:16:23,920
I'm just having a little problem
with my lady, that's all.

1107
01:16:24,024 --> 01:16:26,458
Sir, why don't you come over to the
car and we'll settle it there, huh?

1108
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,120
- There's no need for me
to go to the car.
- Let's go over to the car.

1109
01:16:29,262 --> 01:16:32,197
Please, Officer, stop.
He's a cop. He's not lying.

1110
01:16:32,332 --> 01:16:35,096
- Come on. Don't be like that.
- What are you, stupid?

1111
01:16:35,202 --> 01:16:38,399
- Huh? Didn't I just
fuckin' tell you I'm a cop?
- Okay.

1112
01:16:38,505 --> 01:16:42,566
- All right, look. All right.
Nobody's being stupid.
- Don't be stupid.

1113
01:16:42,676 --> 01:16:44,337
- Back the fuck up!
- Jeff, no!

1114
01:16:44,444 --> 01:16:47,072
You said you were a cop,
right? Then you know the..

1115
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:50,172
- Move it!
- What are you doing?

1116
01:16:50,283 --> 01:16:52,410
Son of a bitch!

1117
01:16:52,519 --> 01:16:56,319
- You wanna play?
- Let him go! Let him go!

1118
01:16:56,423 --> 01:16:59,824
He's a cop!
He's not lying! Please!

1119
01:17:01,695 --> 01:17:04,823
It's too late for this.
We have no time for "I told you so's."

1120
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:10,267
We're talking about potentially
the biggest drug bust
in the history of this state.

1121
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,600
And I still think Cole
can get us there.

1122
01:17:12,706 --> 01:17:16,142
It's not Cole that you're talking about.
That's what you don't understand.

1123
01:17:16,243 --> 01:17:18,143
He doesn't know
who the fuck he is.

1124
01:17:18,245 --> 01:17:21,442
He doesn't know what he's
gonna do when he's J. Reid.
You saw what happened last night.

1125
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:23,717
He understands
what he did last night.

1126
01:17:23,717 --> 01:17:25,844
He's sorry for that.
He's fully conscious.

1127
01:17:25,952 --> 01:17:29,615
He doesn't know what the fuck he did
last night, and he's not sorry.

1128
01:17:29,756 --> 01:17:32,782
You act like he
spilled a glass of water.

1129
01:17:32,926 --> 01:17:36,862
The court accepted a plea
of extreme circumstance
involving an officer on duty.

1130
01:17:38,365 --> 01:17:40,629
- Oh, my God.
- We gotta go.

1131
01:17:40,734 --> 01:17:43,202
I think it's definitely
worth the risk.

1132
01:17:43,303 --> 01:17:47,171
But it's not your risk
to take, is it? It's his.

1133
01:17:47,274 --> 01:17:51,335
Look, if you put Jeff back in,
he will never find his way out.

1134
01:17:51,444 --> 01:17:54,345
It's just for tonight.
That's all. We need him wired.

1135
01:17:54,447 --> 01:17:56,347
We need to have him wired
so that we can find out...

1136
01:17:56,449 --> 01:17:58,849
who Gittens' supplier is
and nail them both.

1137
01:17:58,952 --> 01:18:00,886
Then it'll be over.

1138
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:15,667
Are you there, Jeff?.

1139
01:18:15,769 --> 01:18:19,330
I need you to meet me so you
can tell me what's going down.

1140
01:18:22,042 --> 01:18:24,840
Come on, Jeff. Pick up
the phone if you're there.

1141
01:18:26,012 --> 01:18:27,912
Jeff?.

1142
01:19:14,194 --> 01:19:17,925
Yo, this is where they're
meeting you at, dog?

1143
01:19:18,031 --> 01:19:20,397
Yeah.

1144
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,196
This crazy mother fucker
might be here already.

1145
01:19:27,641 --> 01:19:29,871
He called me between
Chicago and here like an hour ago.

1146
01:19:31,378 --> 01:19:33,608
Let's cut that mother fucker
off. Just go direct, man.

1147
01:19:36,082 --> 01:19:38,346
Mexicans don't fuck
with niggers.

1148
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:42,148
The federales there, they get
all hectic. They get crazy.

1149
01:19:42,255 --> 01:19:44,780
The shit is just off the rockers.
Them taco-eatin' mother fuckers...

1150
01:19:44,924 --> 01:19:48,325
do not like no niggers
down in Mexico.

1151
01:19:51,898 --> 01:19:55,129
It's easier to do it this
way, you know? Good prices.

1152
01:19:59,172 --> 01:20:01,640
It's cool.

1153
01:20:01,741 --> 01:20:04,972
- Yo. You all right?
- What's up?

1154
01:20:05,078 --> 01:20:08,605
- We're here, right?
- No doubt.

1155
01:20:29,269 --> 01:20:33,638
- What's up, Murph?
- What's up, homey?

1156
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,265
- How y'all?
- Chillin'. What's goin' on, baby?

1157
01:20:36,376 --> 01:20:38,276
I'm all right. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not too personal.

1158
01:20:38,378 --> 01:20:41,472
- How you doin', man?
- I'm good.

1159
01:20:41,614 --> 01:20:45,209
- What's goin' on, Thug Life?
- What's up?

1160
01:20:50,457 --> 01:20:53,051
Who's the new eggplant, man?

1161
01:20:53,193 --> 01:20:55,991
Why don't you knock it off
with the insults. That's my man.

1162
01:20:56,096 --> 01:20:58,360
What happened to Frisco?

1163
01:20:58,465 --> 01:21:01,195
Frisco, he's old news, man.

1164
01:21:02,969 --> 01:21:06,769
Frisco's old news?
What are you? You new news?

1165
01:21:09,843 --> 01:21:12,107
Murph, can we speed
up this process, man?

1166
01:21:12,212 --> 01:21:15,045
Who is this guy?
Are you a cop?

1167
01:21:15,148 --> 01:21:18,515
Yo, Murph, Come on
cut the crap.

1168
01:21:18,618 --> 01:21:20,609
Let's do business.
All right, man?

1169
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,688
- I just wanna figure out
who I'm dealing with.
- Yo, Murph.

1170
01:21:22,789 --> 01:21:24,780
Let's do business.

1171
01:21:27,861 --> 01:21:31,854
- Are you a cop?
- What the fuck do you mean
is he a cop, mother fucker?

1172
01:21:31,965 --> 01:21:36,095
- Don't insult me.
- All right. Look, I just wanna
know who I'm doin' business with.

1173
01:21:36,236 --> 01:21:38,136
You're doin' business
with me, mother fucker!

1174
01:21:38,204 --> 01:21:41,139
- You want me to take
my money somewhere else?
- No, we're gonna do this. Alright?

1175
01:21:41,241 --> 01:21:43,334
Next time just call me
and let me know you're
gonna bring some new guy.

1176
01:21:43,476 --> 01:21:47,378
Yeah.
Let's do what we gotta do, man.

1177
01:21:47,447 --> 01:21:50,075
Hey, watch the car, man!

1178
01:21:50,183 --> 01:21:52,515
Sorry about that, God.

1179
01:21:52,619 --> 01:21:56,578
Hey, you got enough cocaine
here, you can buy
a whole fuckin' fleet.

1180
01:21:58,525 --> 01:22:00,459
Just take it easy, man.

1181
01:22:03,997 --> 01:22:05,897
All right.

1182
01:22:12,939 --> 01:22:15,772
- It's all right?
- Come on, man.
What's with that bullshit?

1183
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:19,311
What's the problem, man?
What, you can count my money,
I can't taste your stuff?.

1184
01:22:19,412 --> 01:22:22,438
- 'Cause you're a nigger, Dwayne.
- Hey, fuck you, trailer trash.

1185
01:22:22,549 --> 01:22:26,178
You're lrish, but you're no Kennedy,
Murph. Believe that.

1186
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:29,221
- Let's go.
- That's it.

1187
01:22:33,059 --> 01:22:35,789
- It's all good. What the fuck?
- Shit!

1188
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:41,860
This is Agent Scott. You're
surrounded by the D.E.A.

1189
01:22:41,968 --> 01:22:45,460
- Drop your weapons and come
out with your hands up!
- Let's go! Let's go!

1190
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:50,106
- Let's go! Come on!
- Go, go, go!

1191
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:52,838
- Let's go!
- I knew you were a cop.

1192
01:22:52,946 --> 01:22:54,971
J, watch out!

1193
01:22:58,351 --> 01:23:01,514
Put the mother fuckin'
gun down, Thug!

1194
01:23:01,621 --> 01:23:04,454
- Put the mother fuckin'
gun down! Don't be stupid!
- Put it down!

1195
01:23:04,557 --> 01:23:09,119
- Fuck you! Fuck you, mother fucker!
- Put the gun down!

1196
01:23:17,637 --> 01:23:20,401
Put the gun down.

1197
01:23:20,507 --> 01:23:23,271
Put that gun down!

1198
01:23:30,283 --> 01:23:34,014
I hear him breathing. Why
isn't he giving us the signal?

1199
01:23:41,294 --> 01:23:45,162
Abel One, Baker One. Do you
request backup at this time?

1200
01:23:45,265 --> 01:23:47,893
Hold it.

1201
01:23:50,303 --> 01:23:52,203
What are you..
What are you doing?

1202
01:23:54,307 --> 01:23:57,970
Abel One, Baker One.
Are you ready for entry?

1203
01:23:58,077 --> 01:24:02,241
J, put the gun down, man.

1204
01:24:04,817 --> 01:24:08,719
J, I got
a 600-dollar-an-hour lawyer.

1205
01:24:08,855 --> 01:24:13,554
We'll be out by the morning.
Put the fuckin' gun down, man.

1206
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:16,128
You have ten seconds!

1207
01:24:16,229 --> 01:24:18,129
Wait.

1208
01:24:22,402 --> 01:24:25,462
Put the gun down.

1209
01:24:25,572 --> 01:24:30,305
Put the gun down.

1210
01:24:46,259 --> 01:24:49,228
It's crazy, you know?
It's all a misunderstanding.

1211
01:24:49,796 --> 01:24:53,197
How you doin' today, Officer?

1212
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:56,063
Could you take it easy? It's
all just a big misunderstanding.

1213
01:24:56,169 --> 01:24:59,696
Officer Cole,
would you do the honors?

1214
01:24:59,806 --> 01:25:01,706
Read Mr. Gittens
his rights.

1215
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:06,210
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Go ahead, Jeff.

1216
01:25:06,312 --> 01:25:11,045
Read him his rights. I'm
gonna play him the tape you made.

1217
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:13,744
He'd love to hear
his own voice.

1218
01:25:21,694 --> 01:25:23,924
- You a cop?
- Come on, Jeff.

1219
01:25:26,065 --> 01:25:28,966
You did it.
You brought us home.

1220
01:25:29,068 --> 01:25:31,696
- You have the right
to remain silent.
- You a cop, mother fucker?

1221
01:25:31,804 --> 01:25:34,238
Anything you say can
and will be held against
you in a court of law.

1222
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:36,240
You have the right to an
attorney. If you can't afford one,

1223
01:25:36,342 --> 01:25:38,242
one will be appointed
to you.

1224
01:25:38,344 --> 01:25:42,144
- At any time during questioning..
- All I wanted to do was
be there for you, dog.

1225
01:25:42,248 --> 01:25:47,117
All I did was be there for you.
That's all I did.

1226
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:51,213
Huh, J. Reid?
You ain't no cop!

1227
01:25:52,525 --> 01:25:54,652
You ain't no cop, J. Reid!

1228
01:26:01,034 --> 01:26:03,161
You're a sellout!

1229
01:26:28,695 --> 01:26:32,222
Now the hard part begins.

1230
01:26:32,365 --> 01:26:37,462
I know a doctor who works with cops.
He'll know what you've been through.

1231
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:39,629
This is gonna take
some time, Jeff.

1232
01:26:39,739 --> 01:26:43,869
Who we may have betrayed.

1233
01:26:43,976 --> 01:26:46,968
Who wants to talk about it?

1234
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:51,380
How about you, Jeff?.
Maybe you can bring some
fresh perspective to the group.

1235
01:26:51,484 --> 01:26:56,854
Any cop who was undercover
as long as you were...

1236
01:26:56,956 --> 01:27:00,323
is bound to have some
lasting imprint.

1237
01:27:00,426 --> 01:27:02,394
You crossed the line.

1238
01:27:04,097 --> 01:27:07,624
But that's the reason
Gittens let you in so deep,

1239
01:27:07,767 --> 01:27:10,565
and that's the reason your
testimony could put him away.

1240
01:27:13,406 --> 01:27:16,432
- Tape make you nervous?
- About what?

1241
01:27:16,542 --> 01:27:20,672
I wanna see him
face to face.

1242
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:23,442
Put that bastard
in his place.

1243
01:27:23,549 --> 01:27:28,213
I was undercover, and, uh..

1244
01:27:28,321 --> 01:27:32,155
He tried to kill me.

1245
01:27:32,291 --> 01:27:34,589
The guy called himself God.

1246
01:27:34,694 --> 01:27:39,927
So, you know, I'm ridin' around
with him, playin' my part.

1247
01:28:05,825 --> 01:28:08,521
You know what?

1248
01:28:08,661 --> 01:28:10,561
I just, uh..

1249
01:28:13,533 --> 01:28:18,300
I just wanted to see you,
'cause I wanted you to
know that I'm sorry.

1250
01:28:18,404 --> 01:28:21,396
I fucked up.

1251
01:28:21,507 --> 01:28:25,068
I messed up big time.
I never meant to hurt you.

1252
01:28:30,216 --> 01:28:32,946
You gotta believe me.
I never meant to hurt you.

1253
01:28:34,821 --> 01:28:37,847
I love you, Jeff,

1254
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:40,288
butjust because
two people love each other,

1255
01:28:40,426 --> 01:28:42,860
it does not mean that they're
supposed to be together.

1256
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,300
Who was in charge...

1257
01:28:49,402 --> 01:28:53,270
when you started buying
mass quantities of cocaine
from the New York gang?

1258
01:28:53,372 --> 01:28:57,240
Dwayne Gittens,
known on the street as God.

1259
01:28:57,343 --> 01:29:00,744
- Did Mr. Gittens ever deliver
these goods to you personally?
- On occasion.

1260
01:29:00,847 --> 01:29:04,749
Officer Cole, would
you be so kind as to point
Mr. Gittens out to the jury?

1261
01:29:04,884 --> 01:29:08,877
Certainly. He's the gentleman
seated to the far right
with the bald head.

1262
01:29:11,691 --> 01:29:14,660
Hey, yo, J
Officer Jeff Cole.

1263
01:29:18,631 --> 01:29:21,429
- What's up, man? Look at you.
- What's goin' on, Breezy?

1264
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,832
What's goin' on?

1265
01:29:23,936 --> 01:29:26,837
Thanks for puttin' in
the good word, man.

1266
01:29:26,939 --> 01:29:31,069
You're the one that
decided to testify, man.
You did the right thing.

1267
01:29:31,177 --> 01:29:33,668
Yeah.

1268
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:36,179
I'll guess I'll see you
in about three and a half.

1269
01:29:37,516 --> 01:29:40,246
Be strong, man.

1270
01:29:40,353 --> 01:29:44,517
Dwayne Keith Gittens, you've
been found guilty by this jury...

1271
01:29:44,624 --> 01:29:47,092
of all the crimes in which
you've been accused.

1272
01:29:47,226 --> 01:29:51,128
Therefore, this court
sentences you to a penalty
of two consecutive life terms...

1273
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:55,189
without the possibility of parole.

1274
01:29:57,536 --> 01:29:59,970
- But I would like to say this.
- Thank you.

1275
01:30:00,106 --> 01:30:02,836
I feel really good
about what happened today.

1276
01:30:02,942 --> 01:30:05,934
We did the job
we set out to do.

1277
01:30:06,045 --> 01:30:11,005
Dwayne Gittens and 16members of
the toughest drug organization
operating in this state...

1278
01:30:11,117 --> 01:30:13,517
have been brought down.

1279
01:30:15,388 --> 01:30:19,085
On be half of the D.E.A.,
I would just like to express...

1280
01:30:19,225 --> 01:30:21,386
my deep thanks to
State Attorney Connelly...

1281
01:30:21,527 --> 01:30:24,792
and all the local
police agencies.

1282
01:30:24,897 --> 01:30:26,922
We were fortunate
to have them with us.

1283
01:30:27,033 --> 01:30:29,900
This was a joint effort.
We couldn't have done it without them.

1284
01:30:30,002 --> 01:30:33,028
Now, this operation
may have taken years.

1285
01:30:33,139 --> 01:30:36,006
We needed to be sure
that we could deliver a blow...

1286
01:30:36,108 --> 01:30:38,576
from which this gang
could never recover.

1287
01:30:38,678 --> 01:30:43,911
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is just the blow that was dealt
to Dwayne Gittens.

1288
01:30:44,016 --> 01:30:47,543
If you look around at the
positive changes that have..

1289
01:30:47,653 --> 01:30:51,419
You know, everybody that matters
knows who the real hero is.

1290
01:30:51,524 --> 01:30:55,620
I didn't get into this
war to be a hero.

1291
01:30:59,332 --> 01:31:02,301
Do you.. Do you really
have to go tomorrow?

1292
01:31:02,401 --> 01:31:05,700
Preston says
it's safer that way.

1293
01:31:05,805 --> 01:31:10,970
Besides, those rookies
in Chicago have no idea
what they're in for.

1294
01:31:11,077 --> 01:31:13,477
You know, I've been thinkin'.

1295
01:31:13,579 --> 01:31:17,276
It's not like you could just
pick up and leave or anything,

1296
01:31:17,383 --> 01:31:20,318
but, you know,
you should come with me.

1297
01:31:22,555 --> 01:31:26,082
I got a little
two-bedroom apartment.

1298
01:31:26,225 --> 01:31:29,126
Turn one of 'em into
a dance studio or something.

1299
01:31:33,065 --> 01:31:37,798
A friend of mine was telling
me that they got, like, great
dance companies in Chicago.

1300
01:31:37,903 --> 01:31:40,599
Oh, don't try to
sell me on Chicago.

1301
01:31:40,706 --> 01:31:43,698
Well, you know, I'm just passin'
off information, that's all.

1302
01:31:43,809 --> 01:31:45,709
I know.

1303
01:31:47,747 --> 01:31:50,409
I can go to Chicago
and run things, huh?

1304
01:31:54,453 --> 01:31:56,978
Any other bright
ideas out there?

1305
01:31:59,358 --> 01:32:02,259
Somebody help me out.
Come on.

1306
01:32:02,361 --> 01:32:04,261
Oh, come on.

1307
01:32:07,166 --> 01:32:11,364
You're holdin' that gun.
Time is runnin' out.

1308
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:14,803
Your brain..
Your brain is vaporized,
like ten minutes ago,

1309
01:32:14,907 --> 01:32:18,502
and your heart, your heart
is dancing on your tongue.

1310
01:32:24,183 --> 01:32:27,778
We're talkin' about
your life out there.

1311
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,820
Your life.

1312
01:34:09,555 --> 01:34:11,455
Here we go
Here we go
