1
1192:12:01,577 --> 1192:11:59,207
 Would you like to come in
 for a cup of coffee or something?

2
1192:11:59,208 --> 1192:11:55,136
 l can't, dear.
 The missus is alone in the store.

3
1192:11:55,137 --> 1192:11:53,134
 l should get back by sundown anyways.

4
1192:11:53,135 --> 1192:11:47,228
 All right, well,
 l do so appreciate your coming so soon.

5
1192:11:47,229 --> 1192:11:45,226
 Are you sure you're okay out here?

6
1192:11:45,227 --> 1192:11:42,190
 -Not getting too lonely?
 -Oh, no, no.

7
1192:11:42,191 --> 1192:11:40,355
 l needed this. You can't imagine.

8
1192:11:40,356 --> 1192:11:38,153
 'Cause it'd scare me a little bit.

9
1192:11:38,154 --> 1192:11:36,084
 No. Honestly, l'll be fine.

10
1192:11:36,085 --> 1192:11:33,982
 lt's kind of creepy.

11
1192:11:33,983 --> 1192:11:32,247
 l'll be fine.

12
1192:11:32,248 --> 1192:11:29,310
 All right then.
 l brought you a couple of fresh chickens.

13
1192:11:29,311 --> 1192:11:26,508
 They ought to roast up right nice
 in that old stove of yours.

14
1192:11:26,509 --> 1192:11:24,305
 Just keep 'em in the shed out back
 till you're ready.

15
1192:11:24,306 --> 1192:06:51,666
 -Weather like this works like a refrigerator.
 -Thank you very much. That's very sweet.

16
1192:06:51,667 --> 1192:06:47,562
 Hello. ls Mr. Browman there, please?

17
1192:06:47,563 --> 1192:06:43,291
 Do you know when he'll be back?

18
1192:06:43,292 --> 1192:06:37,953
 What? Yeah, yeah.

19
1192:06:37,954 --> 1192:06:34,616
 No, no, no.
 There's no need for you to do that.

20
1192:06:34,617 --> 1192:06:30,979
 No, thank you. That's fine. You... lt's...
 Don't trouble yourself.

21
1192:06:30,980 --> 1192:06:28,510
 l think there's a storm coming anyway.

22
1192:06:28,511 --> 1192:06:24,740
 No. No. Just... Just tell Mr. Browman
 l was just checking in, okay?

23
1192:06:24,741 --> 1192:04:28,457
 Thank you.

24
1192:04:28,458 --> 1192:04:23,318
 lt's okay. lt's okay. Hi. lt's me.

25
1192:04:23,319 --> 1192:04:19,081
 -Honey.
 -Hey.

26
1192:04:19,082 --> 1192:04:17,145
 Nice.

27
1192:04:17,146 --> 1192:04:13,609
 Thought you might be angry. Okay.
 Let me get my bag.

28
1192:04:13,610 --> 1192:04:05,467
 lt's gonna get soaked.

29
1192:04:05,468 --> 1192:04:03,632
 All right.

30
1192:04:03,633 --> 1192:03:57,726
 -How did you get here?
 -The old man. What's his name? Browman?

31
1192:03:57,727 --> 1192:03:55,057
 Poor guy.
 lt's gonna be a wet trip getting back.

32
1192:03:55,058 --> 1192:03:52,588
 He said the same thing happened
 when he brought you over.

33
1192:03:52,589 --> 1192:03:50,018
 -That's kind of weird.
 -Yeah.

34
1192:03:50,019 --> 1192:03:48,483
 So, this is the place.

35
1192:03:48,484 --> 1192:03:46,348
 This is the place
 where you spent your summers as a kid.

36
1192:03:46,349 --> 1192:03:44,846
 lt's nice.

37
1192:03:44,847 --> 1192:03:42,110
 l've always liked it.

38
1192:03:42,111 --> 1192:03:38,040
 Yeah, l like it too, l think.
 You wanna show me around?

39
1192:03:38,041 --> 1192:03:33,435
 -That's pretty cool.
 -That's just an old Victrola.

40
1192:03:33,436 --> 1192:03:30,732
 Nothing special.

41
1192:03:30,733 --> 1192:03:28,397
 Well, wait, don't you wanna listen
 to it some time?

42
1192:03:28,398 --> 1192:03:22,491
 -Why don't we get you unpacked?
 -Whoa, Slow down. Slow down. lt's okay.

43
1192:03:22,492 --> 1192:03:19,655
 Show me around first. We can unpack later.

44
1192:03:19,656 --> 1192:03:15,651
 You okay?

45
1192:03:15,652 --> 1192:03:10,712
 Come here. Oh, my God.

46
1192:03:10,713 --> 1192:03:04,306
 l missed you.

47
1192:03:04,307 --> 1192:02:49,691
 Yeah, it's true. l did. You know what else?

48
1192:02:49,692 --> 00:59:59,993
 Okay.

49
00:59:59,994 --> 00:59:55,789
 So...

50
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:53,520
 Living room.

51
00:59:53,521 --> 00:59:36,269
 Come here, you.

52
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:34,100
 How many people would come out here
 at one time?

53
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:29,462
 Gosh. Sometimes as many as 20.
 But we'd sleep anywhere.

54
00:59:29,463 --> 00:59:27,294
 ln the summertime,
 we'd like to sleep outside.

55
00:59:27,295 --> 00:59:26,159
 Oh, yeah. l bet.

56
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:17,150
 And this is the master suite.

57
00:59:17,151 --> 00:59:12,979
 Do l get to stay in here, too?

58
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:10,944
 -Where should l put my stuff?
 -Anywhere.

59
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:07,741
 The closet. The chest of drawers.
 Just make yourself at home.

60
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:04,171
 Thanks.

61
00:59:04,172 --> 00:58:58,965
 So, what did you do
 when you came out here?

62
00:58:58,966 --> 00:58:56,196
 Gosh. We'd play and play.

63
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:52,592
 l used to love this game
 where l was this fairy queen

64
00:58:52,593 --> 00:58:50,957
 and l had all these magical powers,

65
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:47,821
 but chief among them
 was the ability to disappear

66
00:58:47,822 --> 00:58:45,986
 and make other people disappear.

67
00:58:45,987 --> 00:58:44,417
 Came in very handy
 when we were playing hide and seek

68
00:58:44,418 --> 00:58:41,982
 because everybody thought
 l had actually disappeared,

69
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:37,744
 when l just happened to have
 the best hiding place on the entire island.

70
00:58:37,745 --> 00:58:34,908
 -l'll show it to you sometime if you want.
 -Yeah.

71
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:28,535
 l wanna see it.

72
00:58:28,536 --> 00:58:26,032
 Look what l brought.

73
00:58:26,033 --> 00:58:22,929
 -You remembered.
 -l did.

74
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:20,594
 Should we have this tonight?

75
00:58:20,595 --> 00:58:05,078
 -Thanks.
 -Sure.

76
00:58:05,079 --> 00:57:58,305
 -Look. ls that your grandparents?
 -Yeah.

77
00:57:58,306 --> 00:57:52,399
 She's beautiful.

78
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:46,560
 -Yeah. She meant the world to me.
 -l know.

79
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:43,590
 Your grandfather was the one
 who bought this place, right?

80
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:40,053
 Yeah, but he only bought it
 because she wanted him to.

81
00:57:40,054 --> 00:57:34,748
 He hardly ever came out here. l think...
 l think it made it easier on him.

82
00:57:34,749 --> 00:57:29,576
 -You never really talk about him.
 -No need. He wasn't a good guy.

83
00:57:29,577 --> 00:57:25,839
 Like your dad?

84
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:19,232
 Sort of.

85
00:57:19,233 --> 00:57:16,530
 All right...

86
00:57:16,531 --> 00:57:10,157
 l mean, he was laid out!

87
00:57:10,158 --> 00:57:07,554
 l guess with a raise and a move,
 he deserved it.

88
00:57:07,555 --> 00:57:03,483
 But it was a really good party.
 l wish you'd been there.

89
00:57:03,484 --> 00:57:00,514
 -l needed to be here. lt was important.
 -l know, yeah, l didn't...

90
00:57:00,515 --> 00:56:56,410
 l didn't mean it like that. l just...

91
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:51,004
 l just like having you around.
 l guess l'm greedy about it.

92
00:56:51,005 --> 00:56:47,901
 Well, you'll get a lot of me around here.

93
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:40,794
 Yeah. Well, that's a good thing. Very good.

94
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:33,220
 l hope it's okay that l came.

95
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:27,481
 You awake?

96
00:56:27,482 --> 00:56:24,077
 Baby?

97
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:18,505
 What? What's wrong? What is it?

98
00:56:18,506 --> 00:56:14,201
 l gotta go to the bathroom.

99
00:56:14,202 --> 00:56:10,931
 l told you to go
 before we went to bed, young man.

100
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:04,224
 Yeah, but l didn't have to go then.

101
00:56:04,225 --> 00:55:35,329
 All right. Hang on a second.

102
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:29,990
 All right. There you go.

103
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:26,853
 -What do you mean?
 -That's all you need.

104
00:55:26,854 --> 00:55:24,017
 -You're on your own, big guy.
 -What?

105
00:55:24,018 --> 00:55:17,611
 Just go pee off the porch. Take it.

106
00:55:17,612 --> 00:55:12,573
 That's not what l gotta do.

107
00:55:12,574 --> 00:55:09,570
 All right, just go down the stairs,
 go through the kitchen,

108
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:05,465
 out the back, and follow the path.
 lt's not very far.

109
00:55:05,466 --> 00:54:57,090
 You're not gonna walk me out there?

110
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:51,318
 All right.

111
00:54:51,319 --> 00:54:46,880
 Honey, just make sure that you use one
 of the sticks by the door

112
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:02,936
 to get rid of the spiders in the seat.

113
00:54:02,937 --> 00:53:00,007
 You gotta be kidding me.

114
00:53:00,008 --> 00:52:31,845
 Oh, shit.

115
00:52:31,846 --> 00:52:22,236
 Hey. How'd it go? Okay?

116
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:20,267
 We played all day long.

117
00:52:20,268 --> 00:52:18,665
 Hide and seek,
 ghost in the graveyard, whatever.

118
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:15,496
 They never found me.

119
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:05,152
 So, l get to see the secret place?

120
00:52:05,153 --> 00:52:01,715
 -You crawled down there?
 -Yeah. All the time.

121
00:52:01,716 --> 00:51:56,777
 Sometimes not even when we were playing.
 lt was just a great place to be alone.

122
00:51:56,778 --> 00:51:54,208
 -Weren't you scared?
 -No.

123
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:52,840
 lt was really cool down there in the summer,

124
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:49,103
 and when l was down there, l could hear
 Grandma moving around the kitchen,

125
00:51:49,104 --> 00:51:46,200
 making her food and talking to people.

126
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:44,131
 lt felt safe.

127
00:51:44,132 --> 00:51:41,995
 Hey.

128
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:37,524
 What about your visit to the outhouse?

129
00:51:37,525 --> 00:51:32,820
 -Were you scared?
 -Come on. You've seen that place.

130
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:30,718
 That's why l don't go there in the dark.

131
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:27,348
 Wouldn't have been so bad,
 except for all the banging.

132
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:25,979
 Banging?

133
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:23,110
 Yeah, when l was inside.

134
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:16,537
 Just the branches banging
 against the walls in the wind.

135
00:51:16,538 --> 00:50:38,666
 Come on. Let's take that walk.

136
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:34,328
 Wow!

137
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:31,892
 Another one of my secret places.

138
00:50:31,893 --> 00:50:27,788
 Yeah. Yeah, it's really beautiful.

139
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:21,215
 l've always loved it here.

140
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:14,875
 You're really beautiful.

141
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:11,772
 The last three years with you
 have been the best of my life.

142
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:09,870
 l know you have your doubts,
 l understand why.

143
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:06,033
 But l want you to know, l don't have any.

144
00:50:06,034 --> 00:49:59,727
 l wanna spend my life with you.
 l wanna start a family.

145
00:49:59,728 --> 00:49:57,558
 With you.

146
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:52,386
 l can't think of a better place than here

147
00:49:52,387 --> 00:49:43,644
 for this.

148
00:49:43,645 --> 00:49:38,138
 Will you marry me?

149
00:49:38,139 --> 00:49:34,902
 l'm not like those men in your family.

150
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:31,131
 l know sometimes it's hard for you
 to believe that, but l'm a good man.

151
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:24,191
 Not perfect in any way, but l'm good.
 You can trust me.

152
00:49:24,192 --> 00:49:06,173
 You can have faith in me.

153
00:49:06,174 --> 00:49:00,901
 Just think about it.

154
00:49:00,902 --> 00:48:47,121
 l'm here.

155
00:48:47,122 --> 00:48:41,749
 Hold on! Come on!

156
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:39,079
 Grab my jacket!

157
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:37,211
 You've got it. You've got it.

158
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:22,863
 Yeah. That's it.

159
00:48:22,864 --> 00:48:17,291
 You really are a mountain woman.

160
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:11,051
 Are you okay?

161
00:48:11,052 --> 00:48:07,748
 What is it?

162
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:04,979
 l love you.

163
00:48:04,980 --> 00:47:59,273
 -Yeah?
 -Yeah.

164
00:47:59,274 --> 00:47:55,436
 That's nice to hear.

165
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:52,099
 -ls it?
 -Yeah.

166
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:49,563
 -You know what?
 -What?

167
00:47:49,564 --> 00:47:45,493
 Yes.

168
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:30,111
 -Yeah?
 -Yeah.

169
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:22,103
 You think anybody in your family
 ever made love out here?

170
00:47:22,104 --> 00:47:19,266
 -l think we'll be the first.
 -Yeah?

171
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:18,032
 -What?
 -Oh, my God.

172
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:15,196
 -What, what, what, what?
 -No, no, no...

173
00:47:15,197 --> 00:47:12,526
 What is it?

174
00:47:12,527 --> 00:47:07,188
 The ring. The ring. Shit.

175
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:04,151
 l...

176
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:01,348
 -You think it went over?
 -l had it. l had it.

177
00:47:01,349 --> 00:46:58,546
 l had it in my hand, but then you fell
 and l tried to help you and...

178
00:46:58,547 --> 00:46:56,944
 All right.

179
00:46:56,945 --> 00:46:51,105
 All right. All right, let's keep...
 Let's look around. We'll find it.

180
00:46:51,106 --> 00:46:31,986
 No.

181
00:46:31,987 --> 00:46:25,513
 -l'm so sorry.
 -l know. l know.

182
00:46:25,514 --> 00:46:22,043
 Nobody's fault.
 Besides, you were saving my life, right?

183
00:46:22,044 --> 00:46:19,673
 -Yeah.
 -Yeah.

184
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:13,434
 Hey, if that's what it takes
 to get you to say yes...

185
00:46:13,435 --> 00:46:08,129
 -lt's still a yes, right?
 -Right.

186
00:46:08,130 --> 00:44:46,380
 l'm sorry.

187
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:43,878
 Honey?

188
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:36,103
 Hon?

189
00:44:36,104 --> 00:44:31,732
 Oh, my gosh. lt's freezing out here.

190
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:28,863
 l'm fine.

191
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:23,324
 -How come you didn't wake me up?
 -'Cause l thought you needed sleep.

192
00:44:23,325 --> 00:44:20,021
 We gonna eat?

193
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:13,180
 l think l'm gonna keep working.

194
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:10,077
 Okay, can you help me light the stove, then?

195
00:44:10,078 --> 00:44:06,407
 l've never done that before.

196
00:44:06,408 --> 00:44:03,404
 lf you wanna be here,
 you have to take care of yourself.

197
00:44:03,405 --> 00:43:26,267
 lt's not that hard.

198
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:04,846
 l'll do it.

199
00:43:04,847 --> 00:43:01,342
 -Hey. Thanks.
 -Sure.

200
00:43:01,343 --> 00:42:58,239
 -lt's a peace offering.
 -For?

201
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:57,038
 l'm sorry about last night.

202
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:53,568
 No. lt's okay.

203
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:52,166
 Maybe l should go back.

204
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:49,864
 l can leave
 when the old man comes out again.

205
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:48,796
 -No.
 -No?

206
00:42:48,797 --> 00:42:46,494
 No, l'm glad you're here.

207
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:43,024
 Me, too.

208
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:41,589
 -Here.
 -Thanks for helping.

209
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:37,852
 Yeah. Well, l always said
 l'd make a good wife.

210
00:42:37,853 --> 00:42:34,182
 l'll tell you what.

211
00:42:34,183 --> 00:42:31,145
 l'm gonna get out of here.
 l'm gonna go explore the island,

212
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:28,509
 -leave you to your work.
 -Thanks.

213
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:23,805
 And then l'll come back and cook dinner.
 We'll see how well that l do.

214
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:21,636
 What? You know l can cook.

215
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:18,266
 And we'll see if that stove gets the best
 of me, but, you know...

216
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:16,264
 -You want me to come help you light it?
 -No, no, no, no, no.

217
00:42:16,265 --> 00:42:13,027
 l've seen you do it. l can figure it out.

218
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:10,024
 -You do work.
 -All right.

219
00:42:10,025 --> 00:41:43,331
 -Have fun.
 -Yeah.

220
00:41:43,332 --> 00:41:40,361
 -Hey.
 -Hi.

221
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:37,892
 -Cute.
 -Yeah.

222
00:41:37,893 --> 00:41:36,190
 You having a good day?

223
00:41:36,191 --> 00:41:33,087
 Yeah, l'm having a little trouble
 getting focused.

224
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:30,752
 lt'll come. How about you?

225
00:41:30,753 --> 00:41:26,714
 Yeah, l did. l took the world's longest hike.

226
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:22,376
 This island's a lot bigger than l thought.

227
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:20,408
 Well, l'm gonna start dinner.

228
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:16,604
 Be ready to eat in five hours.

229
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:14,769
 -That sounds perfect.
 -All right.

230
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:13,701
 -All right.
 -Bye.

231
00:41:13,702 --> 00:40:35,630
 -Thanks for the flowers.
 -You're welcome.

232
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:32,493
 ...murder if you have to.

233
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:25,687
 Vengeance. He's chasing you.

234
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:06,834
 Take care ofit. Do it.

235
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:00,328
 He's going to kill you.

236
00:40:00,329 --> 00:39:48,216
 He's just like your father.
 You can't trust him.

237
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:39,507
 Think of what he'll do to you.

238
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:35,403
 He'll completely destroy you.

239
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:32,266
 But my friend and l will help you.

240
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:29,897
 He's disgusting.

241
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:26,561
 He makes me sick. He makes you sick too.

242
00:39:26,562 --> 00:38:36,978
 He makes you sick, doesn't he?
 He makes me sick too.

243
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:32,974
 Dinner is served!

244
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:27,135
 Come on. Let's go. Enough work for today.

245
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:25,333
 l made spaghetti.

246
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:20,528
 l think it's pretty good.

247
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:14,656
 l'm going to keep working.
 l'm finally on a roll.

248
00:38:14,657 --> 00:38:12,120
 But you...

249
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:07,482
 l have to work. That's why l came.

250
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:05,680
 Right. l just thought we would...

251
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:02,577
 lt's not fair of you to keep asking me
 to spend time with you

252
00:38:02,578 --> 00:37:57,405
 when l didn't even want you here.

253
00:37:57,406 --> 00:37:51,733
 Honey, what happened?

254
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:50,598
 -l don't...
 -Don't!

255
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:49,197
 Yes, that's right. Don't!

256
00:37:49,198 --> 00:36:39,861
 Don't do anything. Just leave me be.

257
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:30,518
 Want some coffee?

258
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:24,879
 l did all right for my virgin try.

259
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:12,100
 Getting pretty good in there, actually.

260
00:36:12,101 --> 00:35:57,485
 l gotta get started.

261
00:35:57,486 --> 00:35:51,346
 See how easy it can be?

262
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:48,543
 lt wouldn't take much, you know.

263
00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:43,037
 She'd be all yours.

264
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:39,267
 l know you've thought about it.

265
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:36,431
 l've watched you.

266
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:26,888
 But then, what can you do?

267
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:23,551
 You know you can't.

268
00:35:23,552 --> 00:35:16,077
 Why would you even try?

269
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:12,807
 You can't do much of anything, really.

270
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:07,602
 Well, not right now.

271
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:05,200
 You could have many things.

272
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:01,396
 Pleasures that have
 been denied you a long time.

273
00:35:01,397 --> 00:34:54,289
 An old vice, for instance,

274
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:49,050
 that can no longer do you harm.

275
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:34,936
 Escape from this place.

276
00:34:34,937 --> 00:34:32,067
 Surely, you haven't forgotten what it's like.

277
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:27,996
 l know. lt must seem like an eternity.

278
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:24,159
 But your eternity is only just beginning.

279
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:20,555
 Do you really want to spend it trapped here?

280
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:14,816
 lmagine being anywhere you want.

281
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:11,446
 Any time.

282
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:05,173
 Freedom.

283
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:01,202
 Or, would you rather spend it

284
00:34:01,203 --> 00:33:40,348
 even in a different way?

285
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:35,310
 l can give you many things.

286
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:27,969
 l can give you everything.

287
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:15,991
 lt's your choice.

288
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:13,355
 You can see it when you look in his eyes.

289
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:08,783
 I cannot warn you enough.
 He's going to torture you.

290
00:33:08,784 --> 00:33:07,449
 You don't want that, do you?

291
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:04,346
 What makes you think
 he's not gonna do the same thing?

292
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:02,477
 He's gonna molest your children.

293
00:33:02,478 --> 00:32:57,138
 You have to see that. You have to see that.

294
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:52,300
 You have to understand that she does not
 want any commitment at all.

295
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:44,593
 She can't handle that sort of thing.

296
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:30,445
 Easy.

297
00:32:30,446 --> 00:32:23,572
 Just give me your hand and you'll be free.

298
00:32:23,573 --> 00:32:20,702
 You only have to do one thing.

299
00:32:20,703 --> 00:32:02,851
 And she can be all yours.

300
00:32:02,852 --> 00:31:34,756
 Think about it.

301
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:21,343
 You'll be no different than you are now.

302
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:15,604
 He may even take your place.

303
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:00,188
 You can't get something for nothing.

304
00:31:00,189 --> 00:29:45,881
 You of all people should know that.

305
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:28,330
 Easy.

306
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:06,208
 lt's okay.

307
00:29:06,209 --> 00:28:52,427
 Trust me.

308
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:43,819
 Hey.

309
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:36,678
 So, you're just not talking to me now?

310
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:35,510
 First you say you'll marry me

311
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:28,136
 and now you act like
 you don't want anything to do with me.

312
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:25,767
 All right. All right.

313
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:21,563
 What do you want me to say?

314
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:19,962
 l don't know. l don't know.

315
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:14,589
 Something like, "Hey, gee, we're engaged.

316
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:12,821
 "Oh, my gosh, l'm so happy.

317
00:28:12,822 --> 00:28:10,619
 "l'm so glad l didn't waste three years
 of his life

318
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:07,416
 "while l tried to decide
 if l was capable of being with somebody."

319
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:05,147
 Something like that.

320
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:04,012
 Would that be all right?

321
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:01,710
 Maybe for once you could be happy
 about something?

322
00:28:01,711 --> 00:27:58,273
 Happy?

323
00:27:58,274 --> 00:27:54,569
 Happy with you pushing me
 and needling me?

324
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:49,564
 "Why can't you be more this?"
 "Why can't you just let go?"

325
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:45,794
 l'm never gonna be good enough for you
 the way that l am, which is kind of broken.

326
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:43,792
 But you just wanna sweep everything
 under the rug,

327
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:42,124
 like nothing ever happened.

328
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:40,589
 Just like they did when l was a kid!

329
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:37,819
 "Let's make everything perfect!"

330
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:36,118
 "You have to be perfect."

331
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:34,149
 Well, you know what? l'm not going to be.

332
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:31,313
 lt's not going to be perfect, ever.

333
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:27,309
 All right. All right. My fault. lt's my fault.

334
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:25,307
 Always the guy's fault.

335
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:20,602
 Especially the one guy who always stays
 when you run,

336
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:17,232
 even out here, in the middle of nowhere.

337
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:13,896
 Where l didn't even want you to come.

338
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:07,589
 This is my special place,
 and you won't even let me have that.

339
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:04,620
 You come here. You invade. You take over.

340
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:00,148
 You start following me around and...
 And don't look at me like that!

341
00:27:00,149 --> 00:26:56,078
 You're trying to control me, l know it.
 Just like he did.

342
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:53,909
 How can you say that?

343
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:51,206
 What have l ever done
 that you could compare me to your father?

344
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:46,201
 My mother didn't even know.
 She wouldn't know. She wouldn't see it.

345
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:43,265
 But l am not gonna sign up
 for a life like that.

346
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:40,896
 -l will not bring children into a world...
 -Stop it. Stop!

347
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:37,960
 Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

348
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:34,323
 Who are you?

349
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:32,454
 Calm down.

350
00:26:32,455 --> 00:26:27,683
 Do you know how many people came
 to my father's funeral?

351
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:26,014
 Five hundred.

352
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:22,744
 Practically the whole goddamn town!

353
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:17,239
 And there they were. They were singing
 the praises of this good man.

354
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:12,167
 They had no idea
 what he had been doing to me.

355
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:08,130
 So, how can you know me?

356
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:04,326
 And how can l know you?

357
00:26:04,327 --> 00:25:53,782
 You know me. You know me.

358
00:25:53,783 --> 00:25:49,178
 Yeah, maybe l do. Maybe...

359
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:45,240
 Maybe finally l can see behind those calm,
 beautiful blue eyes

360
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:41,904
 and finally see you

361
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:34,396
 for who you really are.

362
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:30,759
 l'm done.

363
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:24,853
 Done?

364
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:22,518
 l'm done.

365
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:19,815
 This was a mistake.
 You shouldn't have come here.

366
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:14,576
 All right. All right, l'll...

367
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:12,007
 l'll leave as soon
 as Mr. What's-his-name comes back

368
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:09,505
 -and he can take me to the mainland.
 -He won't come back for three days.

369
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:07,369
 -l'll take the boat then.
 -You can't take the boat.

370
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:05,234
 You're gonna get lost, and l'm gonna have
 to come and save you.

371
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:03,699
 What do you want me to do?

372
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:00,529
 l want you to call Mr. Browman, take charge,

373
00:25:00,530 --> 00:24:56,825
 and call him and ask him to pick you up
 and get off my goddamn island, now.

374
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:36,305
 All right! All right!

375
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:34,470
 Unbelievable!

376
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:29,531
 Phone's dead! You left it on!

377
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:27,096
 l'm taking the boat.

378
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:23,926
 Okay.

379
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:22,825
 Okay.

380
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:19,788
 All right, we're done.

381
00:24:19,789 --> 00:23:09,518
 We're done.

382
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:06,215
 I'm not like those men in your family.

383
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:02,444
 I know sometimes it's hard for you
 to believe that, but I'm a good man.

384
00:23:02,445 --> 00:22:58,407
 Not perfect in any way, but I'm good.

385
00:22:58,408 --> 00:22:32,848
 You can trust me. You can have faith in me.

386
00:22:32,849 --> 00:21:29,919
 Thank God.

387
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:22,444
 Honey?

388
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:13,102
 You all right?

389
00:21:13,103 --> 00:20:31,760
 Honey?

390
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:29,859
 Honey?

391
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:26,822
 Honey. Honey, l'm such an idiot.

392
00:20:26,823 --> 00:19:49,385
 l don't know what came over me. l...

393
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:44,680
 lt gets easier.

394
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:37,306
 You'll see.

395
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:30,666
 lt becomes fun, even.

396
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:24,627
 And the rewards!

397
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:18,421
 With each one,
 you grow in the master's eyes.

398
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:08,744
 He is good to those who serve him.

399
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:00,569
 Freedom comes with a price.

400
00:19:00,570 --> 00:18:57,266
 Not yet.

401
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:48,891
 With each task, you get more and more.

402
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:39,382
 He wants you to prove yourself.

403
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:32,074
 But first things first.

404
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:14,590
 Let's have a little fun.

405
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:10,286
 If you tell Mommy, I'm going to slap you.

406
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:06,816
 I will slap you and I will slap your mother.
 You hear me?

407
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:04,146
 You hear me? Do you hear me?

408
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:01,944
 Good girl. Come over here. Come on.

409
00:18:01,945 --> 00:17:58,541
 I wanna tell you a story. Come on.
 Open your little book.

410
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:55,104
 Open your little book.

411
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:50,132
 You remember that?
 Do you remember what he did to you?

412
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:46,462
 -I was helpless.
 -Like you were helpless.

413
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:43,225
 -Helpless. Defenseless.
 -I couldn't do anything.

414
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:39,455
 Young. Naive.

415
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:37,186
 -Impressionable.
 -I wish I could have done something.

416
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:12,495
 Took advantage ofyou.

417
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:09,992
 What did you do?

418
00:17:09,993 --> 00:15:42,805
 He'd better be dead.

419
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:37,433
 Hello?

420
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:30,326
 ls there someone here?

421
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:22,418
 Who are you?

422
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:16,779
 Are you still here?

423
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:07,470
 Why? Why are you here?

424
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:01,063
 Do you live here?

425
00:15:01,064 --> 00:14:50,086
 Should l be afraid of you?

426
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:42,478
 Did you see my fiance leave?

427
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:39,408
 Did he leave?

428
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:36,606
 ls he okay?

429
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:31,100
 Where is he?

430
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:28,898
 Do you know where he is?

431
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:27,029
 Where?

432
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:23,593
 ls he in the house?

433
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:19,255
 ls he outside?

434
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:10,379
 Are you still here?

435
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:03,873
 Was that you?

436
00:14:03,874 --> 00:13:57,567
 Who else is here?

437
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:52,595
 ls there someone else here?

438
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:30,807
 Should l be afraid of them?

439
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:20,430
 Honey! Oh, thank God.

440
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:15,525
 How stupid do you think l am?

441
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:11,754
 You thought your existence
 in this place was bad?

442
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:00,610
 You have no idea what true hell is.

443
00:13:00,611 --> 00:12:55,838
 When l finish with that stupid bitch,

444
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:42,992
 you'll both wish you'd never been born.

445
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:38,454
 Please say something.

446
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:37,086
 Please, God.

447
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:32,248
 You were right about him.

448
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:29,879
 He's gonna do to you what your father did.

449
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:24,941
 He's going to do it to your children.

450
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:22,772
 No.

451
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:18,568
 "l'm a good man. You can trust me."

452
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:17,467
 You remember that?

453
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:12,495
 lt's what your father said
 to your mother the day he proposed to her.

454
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:09,459
 Yet we both know it wasn't true.

455
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:06,856
 How can you know that?

456
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:01,150
 l was there.
 l watched over her as l watch over you.

457
00:12:01,151 --> 00:11:59,749
 l've seen it all.

458
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:57,680
 l know why you used to come down here.

459
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:54,944
 Just you and me.

460
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:52,208
 Come and sit. Come and sit.

461
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:48,938
 lt wasn't my fault.

462
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:46,469
 It's the way you behave in front of him.

463
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:44,434
 Now he wants to do it, too.

464
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:42,665
 The bastard.

465
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:38,928
 lt's the real reason he came out here.

466
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:37,493
 He's never gonna leave you alone.

467
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:34,624
 -He'll never leave you alone.
 -They never do.

468
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:29,819
 -It's gonna happen again.
 -Until they die.

469
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:25,048
 No one knows what goes on here,
 but you and me.

470
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:21,411
 -You could be free of him.
 -You could be free ofhim.

471
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:18,708
 You could be free of him forever.

472
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:17,607
 And l can help you.

473
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:15,538
 It's a new start foryou.

474
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:11,501
 l'm the one you can trust.

475
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:08,464
 Yes. I...

476
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:01,925
 Trust me, honey. Trust. You can trust.

477
00:11:01,926 --> 00:10:57,687
 I wanna spend my life with you.
 I'm a good man. You can trust me.

478
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:50,480
 You know me. You know me.

479
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:46,776
 What are you doing?

480
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:43,539
 You have to stop it.

481
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:39,903
 l'm going to stop it.

482
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:36,799
 l know him.

483
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:34,330
 He does really love me.

484
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:29,459
 And l love him.

485
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:26,122
 And l know you.

486
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:23,953
 l recognize you.

487
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:21,651
 You're the liar l've always felt.

488
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:20,350
 You're the liar.

489
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:14,744
 And l'm not gonna listen to you anymore.

490
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:02,532
 l'm not scared of you.

491
00:10:02,533 --> 00:09:59,262
 Baby?

492
00:09:59,263 --> 00:09:56,259
 Listen, l'm gonna... l'm gonna run outside

493
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:52,722
 and l'm gonna find something
 to help me get you out of here.

494
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:22,125
 But l'll be right back.

495
00:09:22,126 --> 00:07:25,341
 Do your worst.

496
00:07:25,342 --> 00:06:55,645
 Forgive me.

497
00:06:55,646 --> 00:04:28,231
 No.

498
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:24,561
 Sorry, missy. lt's just me.

499
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:22,926
 l was going to ask if you were okay,

500
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:19,289
 but l gotta say it doesn't look
 as if you're doing too well.

501
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:16,953
 Why are you here?

502
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:13,817
 Just been having this funny feeling all day
 that something was the matter.

503
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:10,981
 l kept trying to call
 but l couldn't get you on the cell phone.

504
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:07,611
 My fiancé is hurt really badly.
 We need to get him some help.

505
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:05,175
 -Where is he?
 -Under the house.

506
00:04:05,176 --> 00:03:49,960
 Well then, let's go get him.

507
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:45,355
 Looks like you had to save me again.

508
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:41,251
 Not really.

509
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:37,747
 What happened?

510
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:36,012
 You need your rest.

511
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:31,975
 l'll tell you later, all right?

512
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:19,629
 l love you.

513
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:18,328
 Ready, missy?

514
00:03:18,329 --> 1193:02:47,295
 Ready, missy?

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Would you like to come in
 for a cup of coffee or something?
