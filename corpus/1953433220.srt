00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
It was ground and
behalf of Buffalo,

4
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:37,999
lived a little girl
named Jules Daly,

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,709
who dreamed of traveling
to far places,

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,396
where people sing and dance.

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,155
Houses are full
musical boxes,

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,596
mechanical dolls
and cuckoo clocks.

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,793
Unfortunately, not all stories
have a happy ending.

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,953
Jules grew up, and although
she still had her dreams

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,874
still lived in Buffalo.

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,394
Hello there! Speaking Bufflské
antiques and other things.

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,916
Yes we buy and repair
clock and all their parts.

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,794
Sure, bring them here.

15
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,096
I'll get there. Hello
I can help you?

16
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,673
Yes, seeking a gift for my daughter.

17
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:52,308
-Well, and what she likes?
- Well, she's ...

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,632
Leeches!

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,400
-Maddie, again doing mess?!
-No, I'm just a snack.

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,909
Glue? Milo!

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,160
Kasawanskiho ninja massacre, super!

21
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,869
Hi, Milo! How are you?
- Zoey! What are you doing here?

22
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,431
-I am your neighbor. Also in
this one store I go.
- Stop following me.

23
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,079
-But that's just for adults.
-Tell me something I do not know!

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,516
Psycho-Bobo will never sell.
-On but it does not matter.

25
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,797
-Did you find what you were looking for?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,235
-I'm outta here.
-Me too.

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,153
-Wait!
-Come on Let's get out!

28
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,913
-Attention!
-Coming!

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,992
-Stop it!
Split-up!

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,068
It's perfect! How did you
It came so quickly?

31
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,959
At home I have a seven-year
girl ... and a teenager.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,509
-Step-children?
No, I am their aunt and guardian.

33
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,592
We're on it all by yourself, but I
great babysitter who is managing.

34
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,872
Mrs. Caley?

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,118
-Not at all. Happy and Merry!
- Merry Christmas!

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,192
Hey, did you see how I sold it here
old music box? I did not
I can find someone to buy it.

37
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,396
Jules, we need to talk.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,193
-You must know that we are now on the right.
-I'll try harder.

39
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,600
You're doing a great job. Or
I can not imagine

40
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,599
both for you had
be difficult this year.

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,559
Losing a sister and brother in law for Christmas ...

42
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,349
-I got it.
-Look, I say it easily,

43
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,396
But I can not afford
you keep paying.

44
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:23,639
If this goes on,
I'll have to close shop.

45
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,838
-Arthur, please.
-I'm really sorry, Jules.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,356
Are you one of the best shop assistants,
I've ever had.

47
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,229
I'll ask around if
I would not employ anyone.

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,958
Yeah, thanks.

49
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,638
Milo, open up. We
the emergency.

50
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,271
You were there!
I'll say it for you.

51
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,275
You say one word and doll
Dingle will lose his head. Fine.

52
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,350
Milo, do not leave the dumpster
the driveway.

53
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,792
-I can not bear it any longer!
-Milo is a killer!

54
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,473
-I told you about it.
-What happened?

55
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,279
Pulling Dingel doll head!

56
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,875
-Again stalked out of the house!
-You were there?

57
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,319
-Wait until you see the laundry!
-Mrs Caley, I'm so sorry!

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,358
Milo, that you put it there glue?

59
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,879
-That's it! I quit!
No, I need you!

60
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,350
All you need
unit is SWAT!

61
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,511
-Wait!
-And one more thing ...

62
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:55,230
The check is not cashed. Again!

62
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,717
Contains violence, outrageous humor,
gory scenes and ticklish topics ...

63
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,780
Milo, you have two weeks of house arrest.

64
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,798
This well-I do not!
-But you do! And do not talk back to me!

65
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,758
-After the Christmas holidays!
-And no TV!

66
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,229
-It will be n ..
-Do not you dare I finish!

67
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,663
Careful, Milo, or the Santa Claus
produces only sweetness.

68
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:25,679
So what? Everyone knows
that Santa does not exist.

69
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,117
How can you tell?
Of course, that Santa exists!

70
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,510
These are the worst Christmas.

71
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,871
Milo, wait!

72
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,436
Come to me, honey.

73
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,791
-Do not cry.
-Why are told that Santa is not?

74
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,960
-Honey, he did not mean it. Just because
 that living alone does not mean that Santa does not exist.

75
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,880
-Just believe.
-I believe it.

76
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,433
Me too, sweetie.

77
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,677
I know you're mad at me a lot,

78
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,072
but you do not like my sister
wounding and destroying her Christmas.

79
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,740
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,236
Tomorrow we will go to the Maddie
tree. Want to join us?

81
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,960
I want Christmas is over already.

82
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,951
It makes me think
about the loss of mom and dad.

83
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,956
Good evening!
My name is Paisley Winterbottom.

84
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,995
You must be Miss Maddie.
I work for your grandfather.

85
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,789
-I have a grandfather?
-Of course you do!

86
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,392
Maddie, Mr. Paisley and now I
We will keep grown-up conversation.

87
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,550
I do not want more than five minutes of your time.

88
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,128
I do not know what you mean, but the name of their
grandfather was not mentioned since

89
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,958
which broke all contact with his son,
because he married my sister.

90
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,953
Yes, it was a very unfortunate decision.

91
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,148
-Unhappy? Have you ever met my sister?
-Unfortunately, I had the honor.

92
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,950
It was an amazing person.
And the pompous fart did not even weightless.

93
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,274
If I may be so bold, they
not just any family.
Their grandfather is Duke!

94
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,070
-That's it?! What is your title?
-I am the butler.

95
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,596
Really? I thought
that those already extinct.

96
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,639
Oh, no, we found again his
exercise. P Diddy himself has three.

97
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,980
Mr. Milo.

98
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,639
-Who is it?
-Paisley Winterbottom.

99
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,999
I came to invite Vác
Christmas at Castlebury Hall to.

100
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,879
-And where's that?
-What is a stone's throw from Liechtenstein.

101
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,349
-It does not matter, just not going anywhere.
-Why not?

102
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,593
-Because I have to go to work.
-I understand that today you rid this obligation.

103
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,478
Well, no way, you fired?

104
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,590
Tickets delivered to you tonight
and here's a check to cover your costs.

105
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,469
From a cowardly family members
do not take any money.

106
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,872
-They told me without you come back.
-Hold it you have to somehow cope.

107
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,429
-He could stay here with us.
-Not a chance!

108
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,071
Is there anything Duke
not feeling well a ..

109
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,031
And would like my grandchildren
seen before ...

110
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,751
-Well, it's out.
-I'm really sorry.

111
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,836
Do not think about it.

112
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,434
Nothing more I can do now.

113
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,434
-No, thank you.
-I'll get it together.

114
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,558
Good-night, Miss Daly!
-Good night, Mr. Winterbottom!

115
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,750
I miss you, sis.

116
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,831
So much for the kids to try, but ...

117
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
Milo looks angry forever.

118
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,953
Maddie needs constant supervision.

119
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,034
And now ended nanny

120
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,351
our car broke down and
I lost my job.

121
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,636
I have a really big problem.

122
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,589
Wish you could be here and
tell me what to do.

124
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,720
Maddie, look!
Is not it beautiful?

125
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,432
-We are already close to her grandfather's house?
-We're almost there.

126
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,630
Welcome to Castlebury Hall.

127
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,158
-It's a castle!
-It's huge!

128
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,476
It's ... a nightmare! Children
Do not break anything!

129
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,797
-Who is it?
-I think the servants.

130
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,509
Let me introduce them to you,
already looking forward to you.

131
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,032
This is Mrs Birch, our porter.
You will be at your disposal.

132
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,200
-Good day, call me Jules. How do I call you?
-Mrs Birch.

133
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:41,307
And this is Abigail.
It will take care of Maddie.

134
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,865
You're pretty.

135
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,396
And this is Floyd, lower butler.
It will take care of Mr. Milo.

136
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,475
I have a servant? This is crazy. He could not
I would instead get Abigail?

137
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,640
This is George, Amy and Brian.

138
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,996
Please follow me.

139
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,198
-All I like.
-Must have courage.

140
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,112
Shut up and go.

141
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,836
This is the entrance hall.

142
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,959
The last renovations were
in 1852.

143
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,380
We're not in Buffalo.

144
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,350
Servants will accompany you to your rooms
and in the meantime I'll tell master that you have arrived.

145
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:38,394
This way, please!

146
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,552
-It slips nicely!
-Yes, it often waxes.

147
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,910
Bed for a princess!

148
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,860
Great!

149
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,998
Where's the TV?

150
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,710
It is beautiful!

151
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,671
-Welcome back to Castlebury Hall!
-Paisley, it's great to see you again!

152
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,834
-Did you have a good trip?
-Yes it worked.
-Your room is already ready.

153
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,500
Thank you, Gibson!

154
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,111
Wait, now I correct it.

155
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,275
Hands off hockey t-shirts!

156
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,558
It is a unique annual edition!

157
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,278
My mistake!

158
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,876
In the east wing of our library,
is at your disposal.

159
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:32,876
You'd better unpack itself.

159
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,794
-But that's my job!
-I will not tell anyone.

160
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,238
If you insist. Dinner is served
At half past eight,

161
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,349
Please be punctual,
Lord I hate waiting.

162
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,869
Mrs. Brichová!

163
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,392
It is therefore fast.

164
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,830
-Hey!
-Hello!

165
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,836
I'm sorry.

166
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,640
-You're Ashton.
-Yes.

167
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,236
I saw you in the picture
My sister, who ...

168
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,551
married ... my brother Charles.

169
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,280
Sorry for the light.
I guess it's pretty old, is not it? And expensive.

170
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,197
It looks like the work of Louis Philippe ...
It's him.

171
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,952
I'm sure it will fix it, just
a little glue and sealer.

172
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,680
Just put it here.

173
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,110
Will you tell me, please, the way to the dining room?

174
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,197
Down the stairs, hallway
the second door on the left to the right.

175
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,992
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

176
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,355
I also like to meet you.

177
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,032
Your bubble-water, sir!
Thank you.

178
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,592
Milo, we're late!

179
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,672
Coming. What is here?

180
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,192
Are locked, which means that
not to go there. Come on.

181
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,550
He said the left or right?!

182
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,156
Sir, may I introduce to you, Mr. Mila,
Miss Maddie and Aunt Jules Daly.

183
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,795
Are you sure you
brought the correct family?

184
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,367
Does not seem to be
kick the bucket, right?

185
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:55,697
No, it does not look around
Pasileyho kill.

186
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:59,752
-Children look exactly like Charles.
-Yes, sir, I've said it now.

187
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Do not just stand there and let's sit down between
us, we do not want to die of hunger, right?

188
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,678
Grandfather.

189
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,675
-This is an Empire chair.
-Yes it is.

190
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,432
Allow me, sir.

191
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,998
-Edward is probably miraculously healed, what?
-Yes, I'm about to talk to you.

192
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,109
Yes, maybe I did not tell you the whole truth,
last good but really not feeling well.

193
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,029
-Children, this is your Uncle Ashton.
-Hey!

194
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,954
-It is also your uncle?
No, sweetie, I'm not related to them.

195
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,912
-Castlebury looks really beautiful.
-Nonsense. It's cold and unhappy place.

196
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,949
-Milo, what are you wearing?
Swashbucklers-Jersey.

197
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,475
You're a swordsman?

198
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,438
-That's for sure.
-It's hockey team.

199
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:08,277
I do not like hockey. It's just a bunch of fools
skating on the ice, which lack teeth.

200
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,195
Not like cricket. This is at least
proper sport for men!

201
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,797
-It's weird!
-Not just weird old!

202
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,960
-How long will you stay?
Why? He would've wanted us zabvit?

203
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,993
-I was kidding!
-I know.

204
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,113
Children, there's something to what you
wanted to ask your grandfather?

205
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,637
Why have you ignored us for so many years?

206
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,189
-Milo!
-It's okay.

207
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,036
The truth is that your mother
had no title

208
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,672
which made her an inappropriate woman
for my son, your father.

209
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,231
-But I realized that I was ...
Full-donkey?

210
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,428
That's not exactly the word I was looking for.
-Did you change your mind.

211
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Yes, and it might as well
recent influenza infection.

212
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,920
-You mean, when you almost died.
-For a while I had a narrow escape.

213
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,836
No, but I'm with you.

214
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,309
After all, we are a family.

215
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,230
What do you think?

216
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,436
It depends on how we
are you going to make up for those years.

217
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,275
-What is going on here?
-Just for Mr. Milo join television.

218
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,795
Milo, I can be with you for a moment?

219
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,237
-Your punishment was no TV.
Yeah, but that was before you made me
spend Christmas at the Castle with nabuřelým grandpa.

220
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,871
-I did it! It works!
Thank you, Floyd.

221
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,191
-Now you can disconnect it.
-Very well.

222
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,860
What?

223
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,997
Much not missing,
nechytáme here or HBO.

224
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,677
It bothers me, as I keep saying,
what to do. You're not my mom!
Not even close.

225
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,840
You're right. I'm not.
But I'm trying with all my strength.

226
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,674
Also, I really miss, you know! Both of you.

227
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:49,080
-It will get better, Milo, I promise.
-I'm tired, I'm going to sleep.

228
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,992
Well, rest and
I'll see you in the morning.

229
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,911
I go to bed, Borucki?

230
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,675
-Have you prayed?
Not yet.

231
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,873
Lord, bless mommy and daddy
in heaven and Jules and Mila too.

232
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,397
The only thing I wish is that
grandfather stopped being so annoying

233
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,204
and we could all be happy
and merry Christmas. Amen!

234
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,434
Honey, I know it's not
the grandfather, what you wish

235
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:55,479
but it is important that
with people give up.

236
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,480
-He was not too happy when her mother
and dad got married, right?
- No, it was not.

237
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,513
But you know, they loved him anyway.
Maybe it's time we also forgive him.

238
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,322
So they come to us angry,
we're here?

239
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:13,114
No, they would be happy.

240
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,069
For your grandfather was a big step when
you and your brother invited to Castlebury.

241
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,151
-All right.
-This is my girl.

242
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,838
And, Jules, do you think Santa will find us,
even if we have tree and lights?

243
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,790
Do not worry, Santa knows where
are all good kids.

244
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,598
Sleep tight.

245
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,752
-You pořádáš hunting tomorrow?!
-It's a tradition, remember?

246
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,833
-I thought it pleases you.
This well-pleased.

247
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,869
I do not want my band
hunters roamed the castle.

248
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Father, they are all friends.
And it's too late to put it aside.

249
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,279
What's wrong with you? I thought
you merry family Christmas.

250
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
I changed my mind.

251
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,960
Christmas makes me think of Charles.

252
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,988
-And the kids too.
-It's obvious! And what did you expect?

253
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,436
I do not know. Perhaps the
I'll feel better.

254
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,379
So your new plan is to make
all feel terrible?

255
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,875
I do not have a plan!

256
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,398
-Yes?
-I'm sorry to bother you, I just ...

257
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,156
-I could never in a castle
Find your Christmas tree.
-That's because there is none.

258
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,717
-And why not?
-I do not like them.

259
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,590
Leave a mess everywhere and
green prickly litter gets everywhere.

260
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,877
-Father.
-But the children it will be!

261
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,669
-I do not want to!
-And you tell me, please, what do you want?

262
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,070
-According to me know.
-Of course I do.

263
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,232
I want to know why you had to bring the kids here,
when they do not want to make a nice Christmas.

264
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,400
I'm not talking about Christmas in a castle
where everyone walks like a zombie ..

265
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,640
I mean Merry Christmas
bells and big dirty tree,

266
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,589
with lots of lights to
Santa knows where we are.

267
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,349
-The kids had a really tough year.
-So do we!

268
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,069
Then we all deserve Happy
Merry Christmas, eh?

269
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,919
-Maybe you could even consider the tree.
-It does not!

270
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,277
And if you do not like that, you
go back to Geneva.

271
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,718
I do not understand why you
ever returning home.

272
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,316
Because I'm your son.

273
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,429
Maybe not your favorite,
but certainly the only living.

274
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,869
Good morning.

275
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,917
-Who is it?
-Jules Daly from America.

276
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,878
-Is there visiting with children.
-Came up with them from such a distance?

277
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,349
What does he want?

278
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,273
Come on you two. We're going.

279
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,940
Come on.

280
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,231
Good morning!

281
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,000
-Hello!
Hi, Paisley.

282
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,792
Nice decoration.

283
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Yes, I've always thought.
Children are waiting in the car and is poised
the road to the village.

284
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,309
Can I ask you? Would you
us in the car? Thank you.

285
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,032
Children, look! Corps.

286
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,878
They are orphans as we do that?

287
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,354
Yeah, but you got me.
Both of you.

288
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,993
Next task ... Christmas tree!

289
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,118
Come on, Milo, come on.

290
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,192
-What is it?
-Barrel organ.

291
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,360
-Look at all those trees!
-You know what? Run ahead and choose the prettiest.

292
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,556
-Come on, Milo.
No, it's okay.

293
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,475
-Come on! Select some nice.
-No, I'll wait here.

294
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,352
Jules, come on.

295
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,918
Jules I found our tree!

296
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,158
This is beautiful!

297
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,955
Hey, slamming me!

298
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,395
We should get the handsome
taken to the castle!

299
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,314
Hey, I'm talking to you. -What's going on?
-Look to apologize!

300
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,720
Milo!

301
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,351
Mude need ice.

302
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,220
Sit!

303
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,629
Struggled!

304
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,316
-I ... -Shut up! Milo ...
- I do not understand why so angry.

305
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,720
Threw you master the buyer presents
orphan attacked and cut Christmas
concert, conducted by a nun!

306
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,000
Goodness!

307
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,915
At least you have anything to say grandchildren, right?

308
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,319
-Where did you get that?
-Miss Daly, sir.

309
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,591
-How are the children liked the village?
-Do not ask, now they are with Paislym.

310
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,639
Your tree passed by.

311
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,152
-How was the fishing?
-Why do you say such a tone?

312
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,269
-Well, I'm not a champion in torture
innocent foxes. -That makes two of us.

313
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,953
What do you think?

314
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,830
Hunt foxes came to me terribly cruel,
so I banned hunting them.

315
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,719
-And what do you hunt?
-Man.

316
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,677
-Man?
-Yes.

317
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,197
Dragging fake bait.

318
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,118
I'm sorry. It should be
enrolled in the sports pages in Buffalo.

319
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,718
We are not formally engaged,
but soon we will.

320
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,678
-Hello. Who are you?
Jules-this is my boyfriend Thomas.

321
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,153
Asthon-behaving decently?
-As Prince.

322
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,869
Well, after all, he is a prince.

323
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,396
-You're not a prince, do you?
-Yes, I am.

324
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,680
-No ... But ...
-The title comes from the mother's side.

325
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,391
-Will you join us for tea?
-Of course it does.

326
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,796
-Look who I found American.
-Hello.

327
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,460
Hello, darling.

328
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,876
Jules, this is Lady Arabella
Marchand du Belmont.

329
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,033
-Great name.
-You mean the title.

330
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,158
It's also my sister,
but I hate it admits.

331
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,432
Ah, sandwiches.

332
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,592
They look delicious.

333
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,396
-What are they?
-S watercress and cucumber.

334
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,997
-You have at your afternoon tea?
-Rather chicken wings and beer.

335
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,071
Definitely do not look like that.

336
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,756
And this is in fact painted
tea set from Louise Bilton.

337
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,959
-You mean Christopher Laundrieho, right?
No, I'm talking about Louis Bilton.

338
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,917
My mistake.

339
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,551
-Miss Daly, we found those boxes.
-Found box ...

340
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,317
I'm sorry, but I gotta go.
It was very nice to meet you all in. ..

341
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,710
Thank you for your sandwiches.

342
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,711
Louise Bilton say ...

343
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,676
-Well, sister, I am afraid that it is a point for America.
-Baby!

344
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:36,039
Check them out!
They are beautiful! Thank you!

345
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,198
Decorations are prohibited-
Why?

346
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:50,360
The Lord would never allow it. A take
this monstrosity where you took it!

347
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,440
You're kidding, right?
After all, it's Christmas!

348
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,836
You're serious.

349
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,637
-You can not just for once, let it be?
-It is difficult, no one would have noticed.

350
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,276
-Mrs Birch, you have children?
-Sun

351
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,068
-Niece or nephew?
-Sun

352
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,310
But once you were a kid.

353
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,119
How can you deny children
just the Christmas tree?

354
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,390
Do not you remember,
how was it?

355
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:50,520
I had a miserable childhood. Never
I've never seen a merry Christmas.

356
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
One year in my sock
found a lot of coal.

357
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,434
-This is terrible!
-I do not deserve any girl!

358
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,559
Maybe I did, but still ...

359
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,720
So good!

359
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,315
-I'm ready!
-This is the right mood, Mrs. Birch!

360
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,158
First-decoration on the tree - done.
-A second.

362
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,260
I really do not understand why every time

363
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:32,679
when we go hunting, we
go back entrance.

364
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,639
-Do you know what the view is father muddy boots.
-I think it's silly.

365
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,271
Mainly, my darling, do not forget that this
weekend go with my parents to the club for lunch.

366
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,032
I'd hate to miss.

367
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,111
Milo, come back!

368
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,915
-Maddie!
-Hold it!

369
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,716
-I'm sorry, sir, it's my fault.
-Are you okay?

370
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,189
Everything is fine, Paisley.

371
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,319
Everything except my new
handbag is fine.

372
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,480
You know, Ashton, are you giving
I thought of the boy more careful.
Completely out of control.

373
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,715
-Thomas, let's go.
-Bye, Thomas.

374
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,360
-Would you tell me who started it?
-He started it.

375
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,557
He's right, it was me.
I'm sorry, Maddie.

376
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,540
This is good.

377
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,997
Now that it's all good again at what
if you Paislymu help with his duties?

378
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,037
-S obligations?
-Yes.

379
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,436
-Feed the ponies.
-Ponies?

380
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,436
-This is a great idea, so come on kids.
-I love ponies.

381
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,594
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. After you.

382
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,715
So call tree.

383
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,714
-Do you like it?
-It's wonderful.

384
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,668
-Want to help?
-I would like.

385
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,630
-Even though I do not know what to do.
-Do not worry, there is no bad
way of decorating the tree.

386
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,831
-Higher. -Higher? -Well, you're a lot higher,
so that we could use.

387
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,037
-Here? Even higher?
-Yeah.

388
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,035
-Super. Thank you.
-Perfect.

390
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,711
-That's what I call change.
-Definitely for the better.

391
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,838
We can also dress?

392
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,956
This is the largest tree,
we've ever had.

393
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,440
I know that his aunt Jules could buy
paid card for emergencies.

394
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,670
I did not know it still works.

395
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,712
Look.

396
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,273
-Dad's favorite.
-It's beautiful!

397
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,192
What's that supposed to be?!

398
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,674
Christmas tree, Father.

399
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,718
I see I'm not
blind or stupid.

400
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,237
-Where do you come from?
-I bought it.

401
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,597
I told you quite clearly,
that no I do not!

402
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,514
Here, Grandpa, here prettiest
We hid for you.

403
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,393
Ashton said that the
It's your favorite.

404
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,037
I really say that?

405
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,555
Do you remember her?

406
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,030
Yes, I remember.

407
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,391
Me and my older brother
We each got one.

408
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,759
My family was shattered me.

409
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,472
I cried terribly.
So I gave you mine.

410
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,600
-I think it is forever lost.
-The tree is still a place for her.

411
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,518
Thank you, Jules. It
truly beautiful tree.

412
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,749
You're welcome. But it is not
just my credit.

413
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,000
Come between us. More
left a lot of ornaments.

414
00:41:58,001 --> 00:42:00,737
That will take care of the servants.

415
00:42:00,738 --> 00:42:04,349
But this is the best Christmas.

416
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,054
The family, which together
TREE tree.

417
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,478
Join us, Dad.

418
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,392
You're right, my dear.

421
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,031
-Obviously enjoys it.
-I know

422
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,112
-It's still hard for him?
-Yes. I wish I could do something with it.

423
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,916
Leave it to me.

425
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,756
I sleep!

426
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,238
Good morning. For fifteen minutes
Meet me on the terrace.

427
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,152
Is that an order?

428
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,118
Application.

429
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,953
-Super.
-Your turn.

430
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,554
-Which eye do you better?
-I do not know and I do not care.

431
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,231
-This is bullshit, I'm going back to bed.
-Milo!

432
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,674
Milo, I want to help you. Go back
and raise the bow, please.

433
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,354
Put it on th side.

434
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,638
Fingers like that.
And breathe.

435
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,951
Look at the target. On
the eye can see better?

436
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,477
-On the right.
-Then look through it.

437
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,791
When I was your age,
I used too frequently monocles.

438
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,714
It's hard to know how to fight,
I later gave up ..

439
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,348
How so?
Nunesl strikes you?

440
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,799
On the contrary. Even though I won,
I still felt like a bum ..

441
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,998
Now stretched bow.

442
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,312
And let arrow, let me
walk away with your anger.

443
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,831
-Super.
-Even Jenda?

444
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,999
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, Paisley.

445
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,160
It's funny how decorating the Christmas tree
can induce the Christmas atmosphere.

446
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,350
-Paisley, how many days are left until Christmas?
-Five, sir.

447
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,310
Five ... It will be hard work, but I think
invitations that can be ready in time to divorce.

448
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,471
-Invitations?
-Yes, to the ball.

449
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,949
We will be throwing the ball?

450
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,557
Yes, it will be at our Christmas Ball,
I just decided.

451
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,720
We need to hire a band. And tell
Ashton let invite all your friends.

452
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,515
-Are you all right, sir.
-Never been better.

453
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,559
-What do kids?
Mila-Asthon learn to shoot a bow

454
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,158
Maddie and Miss Abigail Jules and run
looking after the castle and head dolls Dingle.

455
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,199
Sorry, I should have
the head sew tighter.

456
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,752
-Your?
-Thank you.

457
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,478
Look at this!

458
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,995
Whoa! This is a tragedy!

459
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,271
-Are you sure
do not want a new one? -Sun

460
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,195
In that case, put on your best people,
who will not stop until they find the head!

461
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,114
Come on, Maddie, we
a tea party.

462
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,393
I saw you in the morning
and Milo on the terrace.

463
00:46:34,394 --> 00:46:36,954
It is very nice of you,
that you spend time with him.

464
00:46:36,955 --> 00:46:39,699
So if you too worried.

465
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:42,712
The hour went surprisingly well.

466
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,190
-And you're next.
-With arms on it I'm not very good.

467
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,480
And what about the waltz? You'll need
the ball, which his father holds.

468
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,757
-Really?
-Yes.

469
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,117
It appears that it is thought
thanks to someone.

470
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,900
Shall We Dance?

471
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,869
-You're too stiff.
-I just wanted to say the same thing about you.

472
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,600
Allow your hand.

473
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,389
And how should it then be?
-Sensitively.

474
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,870
Much better.
Now counting.

475
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,114
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

476
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,749
I'm sorry, I'm not
just musically talented.

477
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,790
Do not worry, I am. From five
I learned the violin.

478
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,918
-Do you play the violin?
-Yes.

479
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:46,380
-And now, try to concentrate.
-I just think it's interesting.

480
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,838
It seems to me interesting that you eat wings
and you know the art from Christopher Landry.

481
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,357
Children, I thought,

482
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,000
that since you both Hauntigtni,

483
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:05,039
I should expand
your cultural education.

484
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,349
Can this obligation
addressed until after the holidays?

485
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,520
You will be able to choose between language,
literature, music, dance or art.

486
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,072
I chose ballet.

487
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,429
-What did you choose?
-Electric guitar.

488
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,273
-This is impossible.
-Come on, lighten up a bit.

489
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:25,880
-I'm just funky type.
-Do not worry, I am.
Basic lessons with YMCA.

490
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,677
Oh come on, I know you're a prince, but certainly
you sometimes hidden dance moves.

491
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,975
I'm sorry to bother you
this ... your ghetto dance

492
00:50:26,975 --> 00:50:30,000
-But we have to ...
-Lunch ... with your parents!

493
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,396
Excuse us.

493
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,993
-I'm really sorry.
-For'll forgive you this time.

494
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,715
Now you should have around
a lot of distractions.

495
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,354
You know, Ashton, I think
it's great

496
00:50:53,355 --> 00:50:56,639
both to those children
dedicate. Really.

497
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,518
Finally, we use it here, huh?

498
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,993
Yes, but their life is
Buffalo and soon will go home.

499
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,439
Of course it is occasionally see ...
on oprázdninách or graduation.

500
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,833
But we must be realistic,
not like us.

501
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,321
It would be wrong to force
is to change it.

502
00:51:18,322 --> 00:51:20,174
Change it?

503
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:24,555
Sorry to interrupt, but we have
less of a problem with canapés to the ball.

504
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,190
-What's the problem?
-Chef can not decide between
shrimp quiche and salmon mousse.

505
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,399
I would prefer salmon. Although
caviar would be even better.

506
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,917
So salmon?
Or something else?

507
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,796
Maybe I should come back later.

508
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,273
Speaking of tomorrow evening
I have the most beautiful dress.

509
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,078
Come walk me to my car.

510
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,598
-Which dress is Miss Jules tomorrow, Mrs. Birch.
-I suppose it will be these.

511
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,518
-This is the robe away.
-Maybe it helps when it vyžehlíme ...

512
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,994
-What is the guest list?
-Good. Nearly all accepted the invitation.

513
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,660
That is fine.

516
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,719
Yes, you're right.

517
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,829
You should not have happened to be at lunch
Arabellinými with parents?

518
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,995
Badly-I looked at the clock and missed it.
-That's a very irresponsible.

519
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,790
Family du Belmond is in this highly esteemed county,
We did not want to squander it, did it?

520
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,637
Believe me, Dad, it was not intentional.

521
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,268
Very well, then.

522
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,355
I noticed that you spend
much time with Jules.

523
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,071
I taught her about the dance waltz.

524
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,794
We invite her?

525
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,271
Let me guess, you want there ij
just because it does not have a title.

526
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,390
If only it, but behaves
also quite obscene.

527
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,266
I suppose it
will not not invite?

528
00:53:22,747 --> 00:53:27,444
Exactly so. We only hope
avoiding trapasům.

530
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,191
Hello.

531
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,315
The clock did not work for years.

532
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:48,395
Only had to pull a little shaver.
They would have had to go right.

533
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,869
You are amazing!

534
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,828
You need to go bake Christmas cookies,
I promised the kids.

535
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,672
They taste great.

536
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,799
-She is Miss Jules.
Cute-girl.

537
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,177
-What could compel him to play again?
-I asked rather WHO.

538
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,036
-What is it, Floyd?
-Sorry to interrupt, sir.

539
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,758
But I found it!

540
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,473
I think you're looking for this.

541
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,871
Thank you, Maddie will be thrilled.

542
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,955
-Are you okay?
-Just give me something in my eye.

543
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,271
-I'm fine.
-Of course.

544
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,394
-Did you want something else?
-Yes.

545
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,395
I wanted to ask.

546
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:38,877
We have a problem with the selection jednohubkek.

547
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,991
-What's the problem?
-Shrimp quiche or salmon mousse?

548
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,556
-What do you like most?
-Shrimp quiche.

549
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,220
That's it.

550
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,273
-Do you like shrimp?
-Very much.

551
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,396
Then it is solved.

552
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,598
Good night.

554
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,355
Charles was of
best. Your father.

555
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,198
Much better than I
when I could be.

556
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:32,278
-Why was locked in his room?
-Probably because ...

557
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,231
it hurts too much to remember.

558
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,360
But this is everything
from my father left.

559
00:57:41,402 --> 00:57:45,639
All of this makes him a living.
Why no one remembers?

560
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,315
Every morning when I wake up, the
I'm trying to remember, but ...

561
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,679
But his face out of my mind
disappears more and more.

562
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,630
And for a while, until I try,
was left with no bit.

563
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,950
That's not true.

564
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,995
The love you for you
he will always be here.

565
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,754
You look just like him.

566
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,078
-Really?
-A lot.

567
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:29,316
Milo, I'm so glad that you and Maddie
and Jules arrived for Christmas.

568
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,837
I hope you noticed how
all elevated Christmas spirit.

569
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,551
Should I leave the door
from now unlocked?

570
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,391
Come on, it's too late and
tomorrow is the big day.

571
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,670
Coming.

572
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,269
-Sorry I woke you?
-Is everything okay?

573
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,876
-Not been some incident.
-Incident?

574
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:28,119
I'm terribly sorry, Miss, did not realize
I think the iron is too hot.

575
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,883
Nothing happens, Abigail ...

576
00:59:29,884 --> 00:59:33,518
But this is, after all, Miss Jules
Now what does not go to prom.

577
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,636
What's that burning?

578
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,513
-For God's sake, call it a hole!
-Thanks, Paisley, for your valuable observations.

579
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,570
What will you do? All shops
the clothes were shut down.

580
00:59:45,571 --> 00:59:47,569
You'll have to repair,
nothing else can do.

581
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,236
-Maybe it's a sign.
-What do you think?

582
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,434
-That I would not go to the ball.
-You can not be serious.

583
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,559
Miss Daly, were it not for you,
supplier no ball would not happen.

584
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:02,272
It's nice of you to say so,
but I think miss him.

585
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,640
Into the seat.

586
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,393
We have to do something.
I have an idea.

587
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,832
I must say that the tailor did a great job, sir.
Even if you only had one exam ..

588
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,629
Paisley, I have a feeling that
tonight will be fantastic.

589
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,111
Crystal glasses in the hall.

590
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,876
Patricia, you've found the rest of the dishes!
Take it into the kitchen.

591
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,758
These glasses in the dining room.

592
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,833
-Everything all right?
-Yes.
-Amazing.

593
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,996
Ah, musicians are
there. Right this way, gentlemen.

594
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,118
Welcome.
Right this way, sir.

595
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,070
-Get back to work.
-Of course.

596
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,869
-It is a pity that you're leaving early.
-I need to find a job as soon as possible.

597
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,395
Moreover, these and Maddie
had a great enjoy.

598
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,516
And I'll see you when you return.

599
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,589
Complete 007th agent.
Look at the Svelte.

600
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,512
-You know what, Jules?
-Yes?

601
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,468
-You are great.
-Thank you, Milo.

602
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,990
Here's my princess.

603
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,551
Maddie, seriously we have to introduce
program into smaller eating chips.

604
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,919
-Why do not you go to the ball with us?
Next time, baby, right?

605
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,116
But miss Christmas.

606
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:49,800
You know what, we celebrate is how you arrive
home and you will have two Christmas.

607
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,357
I want you to tell me a favor?

608
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:59,031
Say goodbye for me with grandfather
Ashton and uncle?

609
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,433
-But wait till I'm gone.
-Are you sure?

610
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,397
Yeah, like this is better.

611
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,369
They got a lot tonight to work.

612
01:03:07,762 --> 01:03:10,063
Sure to proudly introduce you to the whole Castlebury.

613
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,756
Stand up, I want to see you.

614
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,950
You look amazing. I love you
both very much.

615
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,079
And I know that parents look at you
and are very proud of you.

616
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,596
And me too!

617
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,878
Hooray for them.

618
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,420
Go on!

619
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,980
-Thank you!
-Good evening!

620
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,991
Thank you, sir.

621
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,995
I chose correctly.

622
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,480
The Castleburské station, please.

623
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,156
Ms. Daly?

627
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,032
Where is Aunt Jules?

628
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,589
-She said that I will execute ...
Not yet.

629
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,512
Dealt with what?

630
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,636
-Edward.
-Lady Blanchart.

631
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,756
Hurry not much time.

632
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,550
Wait!
Get in!

633
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:11,475
-Where are we going?
On-station. Jules went away.

634
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,380
Step on it!

637
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,993
Arabella, my dear, you look amazing.

638
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,637
Sir Edward, you are too kind.

639
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,440
-Thomas.
Hi, honey.

640
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,955
Edward, it's great to see you again.

641
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,169
Arabella, I tried you all day
unavailable, why did not you call back?

642
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:47,397
But I was due to
ball in one round.

643
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,239
-I said it in a hurry!
Stop-dramatize it!

644
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,757
I need to talk to you and can not wait it.

646
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:07,160
-Jules, where are you going?
-Mrs Birch, waiting for the train to the airport.

647
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,551
-Something you forgot there.
Really?

648
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,473
Yes, it's in the car. Come on.

649
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,470
You're all here!

650
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,517
-What is it?
-Your Ball gown.

651
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,036
-You you could fix my dress?
No, not really.

652
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,429
I'm sure that they are
nice, thank you very much!

653
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:31,389
You want to at least look at them?

654
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,500
Definitely.

655
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,075
Those are not my clothes.

656
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,394
But yes, miss. Paisley is
arranged the way from Vienna!

657
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,872
-Who paid for them?
She folded-back from the služebnoctvo.

658
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,912
-But it had to happen a lot.
Get in-Come.

659
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:03,552
Floyd, sit forward. Sure, those on
It hit the power, Jules has to catch the ball.

660
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,432
Oh my God!

661
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,713
She was editor of the French Vougue,
who spoke the Countess Lillehookovou?

662
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:19,591
I do not know. Arabella, do you
that belong together?

663
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,149
What kind of stupid question.
We are the perfect couple.

664
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,108
All that said, even
our parents think so.

665
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,559
-And what if I did not have a title?
-What the hell is this nonsense!

666
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,952
-You did not answer my question.
-Because it's a stupid question.

667
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:47,640
Well, if you were to be a gardener,
I would not even look at you without looking.

668
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:52,431
-Is that what you wanted to hear?
-Yes.

669
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,910
Why?
-Because it's true.

670
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:02,438
We do not want the same things. My
life to yours does not fit.

671
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,790
You're breaking up with me?

672
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,833
No, of course not, we all
expect to espouse.

673
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,313
Sorry, but I'm not sure
that I can make you happy.

674
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:24,031
But I want to be happy.
I want to be a princess!

675
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,151
It's over, Arabella.

676
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:33,279
-Ah, here is our love birds.
-Mother.

677
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,109
-Where is your aunt Jules?
-I can not say.

678
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,915
We have our Jules.
He's coming.

679
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,517
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss
Jules Daly from Buffalo!

680
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,239
The Buffalo? Today she gets here
already seriously by anyone.

681
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:26,436
-Jules, you're here!
-Nice dress!
Thank you.

682
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,751
-I'm glad you're back.
-Me too.

683
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,391
Jules, I have no words
You look ravishing.

684
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,519
Thank you, sir.
-I think that the ball can begin.

685
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,758
Lady Christina.

686
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,837
-So, kids, who wants to dance?
-I!
-I'll take it.

687
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,109
-Jules?!
-I prefer to wait here, thank you.

688
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,312
Henri Dasson.

689
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,676
Do you enjoy it here?

690
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,832
-I was just admiring your decor.
-I see.

691
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,994
You know how to do with antiques.
I can not stay away from them.

692
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:14,188
Do not worry, not break it. It seeks to
every effort to embarrass you.

693
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,353
-What do you mean?
-I heard it with
Edvard say in the study.

694
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:24,520
I know you did not want to invite me.
Stupid girl without a title and fortune.

695
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:30,472
There has been a misunderstanding.
Father talked about Bunny McCracken.

696
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,270
-Who?
-It's a horrible woman, something in grizzlies style.

697
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:41,440
Scaring children ... and elderly.
Yonder stands.

698
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:49,753
Yeah, you're right,
Not that the grizzly ...

699
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,870
Jules, you must know, no
maybe you do not know, but ...

700
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:01,273
The truth is that I care too much about you.
I clamped one that you have no title.

701
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,798
You're really funny, smart and surprisingly
unconventional, which is a rare combination

702
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,512
I think they are playing our song.

703
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,114
-But we have a song?
-Now we already have.

704
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,460
How come dancing with her?

705
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,715
-Do something!
Where's Edward?

706
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,236
What are you so upset?

707
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,354
I suggest you get more
watch your son.

708
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,355
-I do not know what you're talking about.
-About that.

709
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,237
-Are you okay?
-Yes, just need some air.

710
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,078
Of course.

711
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,900
Jules, wait!

712
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:15,232
You should go back inside, I'm sure
that you are looking for you. I'll stay a while.

713
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,512
No, I'll wait here with you.

714
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,636
If you do not mind.

715
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,552
-But what Arabella?
-I finished it.

716
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:42,679
-What happened?
-You hit my heart.

717
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,676
And how do I do it?

718
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:53,631
-You're a prince and I Castlebury
just a poor girl from Buffalo.
-Exactly.

719
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:22,951
Such an insult! Prince Ashton
There publicly cavort with that girl.

720
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:29,036
-When should engage with our daughter.
-My son can decide for themselves

721
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:34,593
Yes, we know about your sons and their
weakness for women without a title.

722
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,260
Watch your tongue, woman!

723
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:41,553
I'm top Baroness Belmondo
and you can not address me like that!

724
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,278
You may Baroness,

725
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:49,440
But Jules Daly is larger lady
than what you ever will.

726
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:55,840
You obviously do not know the right Jules Daly.
It had just about money, why else would there be.

727
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,236
Everyone sees the kids
can not cope at all.

728
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,234
So I did
small personal exploration.

729
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,632
Did you know that Jules Daly
thrown out of work?

730
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,793
That Mr. Milo is actually kleptomaniak?

731
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:18,556
And that little Maddie is changing
the addict to food?

732
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:23,350
-That's a lie!
No, Arabella's right.

733
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,954
See? I said it.

734
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,671
Milo really stole the game,
but then it went back.

735
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:35,470
Maddie loves chips, which
we are trying to alleviate.

736
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,928
And I really
currently unemployed,

737
01:16:37,929 --> 01:16:40,959
but I hope it will not last
long because I work like that.

738
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,930
Maybe too much about
parenthood do not know

739
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,797
but I know that we do not need money,
we were happy.

740
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,876
We just need yourself.

741
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,391
They are brave children who
deserves to have a family.

742
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,917
Even if you do, Arabella, seem to be impossible,
that's the only reason why we are here.

743
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,159
Ashton, perhaps it
really believe that.

744
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,669
Yes, I do.

745
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,793
-Edward, surely you can see, it is ...
-And if so what?

746
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,713
Say about Jules is poor mother.

747
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:28,113
I was also a bad father.
And worse father-in-law.

748
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:33,115
Jules should at least work while you
worked a single day in his life.

749
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,909
And if you ask me, Arabella
Marchand du Belmont,

750
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:41,517
You're here because
coats and necklaces.

751
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,352
That's enough, we're leaving!

752
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,318
Come on, Thomas!

753
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,353
Thanks, Dad!

754
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,157
No, thank you, you did not
give up the old fool.

755
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,229
Can I donate one
fatherly advice?

756
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,958
Do not let the girl escape.

757
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:26,395
-Can I talk to your aunt for a moment to talk?
-Definitely.

758
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:38,998
Jules, I know that there are no hockey and chicken
wings, but we have cricket and pancakes.

759
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:46,360
Is it possible that you would get with Maddie
Milo and extend your stay?

760
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,113
Here at Castlebury Hall?

761
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:00,557
-Jules has a beautiful dress.
-Yes, sir.

762
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:04,838
-Great taste!
-I thought about where bought?

763
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,703
If you would like to
replace your expenses,

764
01:19:08,145 --> 01:19:11,133
submit my bill in the morning.

765
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,674
So back to work.

766
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,197
Thank you, sir.
-You are a good man, Paisley.

767
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,154
It's time!

768
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,740
Children!

769
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,192
Santa!

770
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:46,316
You see, Maddie, wrong
I. Santa exists.

771
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,040
Come on, kids!

772
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,800
Hello, Santa!

773
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,118
-Look at all the presents!
-Do you see the big gold?!

774
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,556
Where did you come from
all those gifts?

775
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:07,679
-You are really great!
No, my dear, you're amazing!

776
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:17,068
-What is it, Dad?
-I just wish that there was Charles.

777
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:21,597
But he's here. Did not see it
Mila in bright eyes?

778
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,434
Or a beautiful smile Maddie?

779
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:32,193
Charles is here. And my sister too.

780
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:39,360
You're right, dear. And Ashton, this
is a really smart girl.

781
01:20:39,361 --> 01:20:45,158
We should not cry over what we have lost,
but celebrating what we found.

782
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,676
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

783
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,037
-Look!
-Fireworks!

784
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,275
This must-see.

785
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,875
Merry Christmas!

786
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,798
Jules and Ashton, all the best!

787
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:57,748
Hi, my prince!
Hi, my princess!

788
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,835
-It sounds like we're in line for a throne.
-The problem is that we really are.

789
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,752
Oh yeah!

790
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,756
Really?

791
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,114
Here we go!

792
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,272
All the stories do not end well.

793
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:28,309
But for Jules Daly,
dreamer of Buffalo,

794
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,234
this story is just beginning.
