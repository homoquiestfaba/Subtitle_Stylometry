00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:19,957
Goes hips, and hips, shake,shake, shake, and turn.

373
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,338
OK, come on.

374
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:22,719
Find your partner.

375
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:25,618
Let's go.

376
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:30,347
One, two, three, four, five,six, seven, eight, yeah, OK.

377
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,349
Let's see some energy.

378
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:34,834
Keep it going.

379
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:36,802
[phone ringing]

380
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,389
Ma.

381
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:39,736
No, it's your father.

382
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,945
My God, don't you
people ever sleep?

383
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,015
Listen to me.

384
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:44,775
Your mother is in
a panic, all right?

385
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:46,605
She was up all night.

386
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,641
Her ulcer is all flared
up and everything.

387
00:26:48,745 --> 00:26:50,574
Now, what's with this girl?

388
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:51,817
Are you really living with her?

389
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,647
Look, I'm trying
to sleep here, OK?

390
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,338
I cannot talk about
this right now.

391
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:57,236
The hell you can't.

392
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:58,824
You know, we have--

393
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:02,655
Mikey, I gotta go!

394
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,383
I want to finish this
later, take care.

395
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:09,282
Why don't you save
us all some money,

396
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:11,457
go into the demolition business.

397
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,493
The resort's number is here.

398
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:14,598
You can use this plate.

399
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:17,014
And you may drink
from this glass.

400
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:20,880
Please, be sure to turnthe gas off, if you could.

401
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:23,607
Now, Lulu gets hermedicine at 4:00 o'clock.

402
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:27,611
You will talk to her
twice a day in English

403
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:29,509
so she doesn't get lonely.

404
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:33,893
Yeah, my little pumpkin.

405
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:35,584
Don't leave the lights on.

406
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:39,002
And do not use this room.

407
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:42,764
I don't like fingerprintson the marble.

408
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:47,251
Now, when you take
a bath, a bano.

409
00:27:47,355 --> 00:27:49,840
It's bano.

410
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:51,531
Whatever.

411
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:54,431
Don't even think about
using my bathtub.

412
00:27:54,534 --> 00:27:56,882
There's one in the
maid's quarters.

413
00:27:56,985 --> 00:27:58,504
OK.

414
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:01,438
And stay away
from my Ming vase.

415
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:04,786
This is worth more thanyou'll see in your lifetime.

416
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,856
Selma, let's go!

417
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,892
Come on!

418
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:08,203
Coming.

419
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:09,101
Bring my bags.

420
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:13,657
[speaking spanish]

421
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:20,043
Oh, be sure and start
my car for the battery.

422
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:21,803
Oh, and one other thing.

423
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:25,048
I don't want anyone, Imean anyone, in the house.

424
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:26,083
Is that understood?

425
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:27,050
Yes, of course.

426
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:29,949
No, no, no, no,
I mean, comprendo.

427
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:31,917
Christ, she's got it.

428
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,021
I don't trust her kind.

429
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:41,029
Enjoy yourself, Lola.

430
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,445
All right, I'm ready.

431
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:44,446
I'm gonna miss you.

432
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,586
Get in.

433
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,073
OK, let's go.

434
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:53,593
[dance music]

435
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:19,403
[beeping]

436
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,892
[engine sputtering]

437
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,075
Is there a problem?

438
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,284
Oh, I don't know.

439
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:39,768
It just died.

440
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,631
Tony.

441
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,773
Lola.

442
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,914
Lola.

443
00:30:47,017 --> 00:30:48,812
Lola, why don't you pop thetrunk, and let's take a look,

444
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:49,951
OK?

445
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:51,504
Hey, Mikey, you give
me a hand over here, OK?

446
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:53,092
I think this lady'shaving the same problem I

447
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:54,266
had with my Ferrari last week.

448
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:58,132
Come on.

449
00:30:58,235 --> 00:30:59,374
Don't you ever get
tired of the bullshit?

450
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:00,341
Hey, just focus, Mikey.

451
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:01,238
Come on.

452
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:07,935
Lola, this is-- this isMike, my business partner.

453
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:11,628
And we actually-- we
buy, sell, and own

454
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:13,837
several of the propertieshere in this neighborhood.

455
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:14,907
OK, give it a shot.

456
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:15,804
Should be all set?

457
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:19,981
It works.

458
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:21,293
Thank you, Mike.

459
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:22,501
You're welcome.

460
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:24,123
Yeah, Thank you, Mike.

461
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:25,262
Oh, you know what?

462
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,540
You better call London,
see if that $10 million

463
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:28,783
transfer made it
into our account.

464
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,962
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

465
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:36,549
I really appreciate
you fixing my car.

466
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:37,757
It's not a problem.

467
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:40,174
Is there anything else
that needs fixing?

468
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:42,831
No, nothing I can think of.

469
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:46,697
OK, then, you know, maybe--

470
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:48,492
maybe we could have dinner?

471
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:49,493
That's very kind of you.

472
00:31:49,597 --> 00:31:52,703
But, no thank you.

473
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:56,845
You have a boyfriend
or something?

474
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:59,331
No, but you've got a wife.

475
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:08,271
Actually, my wife, shepassed away three years ago.

476
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:10,583
Oh, I'm so sorry.

477
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:12,240
No, no, it's all right.

478
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:14,656
It's all right.

479
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:21,042
I just-- just thought we could,you know, have dinner and talk.

480
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:21,974
OK.

481
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:23,976
But just dinner, nada mas.

482
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,116
Yeah, absolutely, where
would you like to go?

483
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:30,707
Che Philippe.

484
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,228
How about I pick
you up at eight?

485
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:36,609
How about I meet you there?

486
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:38,542
Yes.

487
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:39,474
We'll meet at 8.

488
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:40,786
OK.

489
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:42,753
[phone ringing]

490
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,621
Leanne speaking!

491
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:51,245
Leanne, Mike
Greenbaum calling.

492
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:53,005
Hi.

493
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:56,457
Mike, hi, how are you?

494
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,012
Good, you know, I just
wanted to call and thank

495
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:00,979
you for the other night.

496
00:33:01,082 --> 00:33:04,085
I had a really great time.

497
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:05,569
Yeah, me too.

498
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:07,640
It was-- I mean,
I never imagined

499
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:10,609
that you like the macarena.

500
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:12,783
That place was
really rocking, huh?

501
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:14,371
Especially when that
masked girl came on.

502
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:15,303
I know.

503
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:16,408
Isn't she great?

504
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:20,205
Wherever she is, the
crowd just goes wild.

505
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:21,482
You wouldn't
happen to know where

506
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:24,209
she is tonight, would you?

507
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:26,176
Well, it's
different every night.

508
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:32,562
But, hey, if we hit some ofthe clubs, we could find her.

509
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:34,564
I would love to, actually.

510
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:37,601
But my car is in the shop.

511
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:40,466
No problem, I'll
swing by, really.

512
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,227
How's 9:00 o'clock?

513
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,470
Good, see you then.

514
00:33:44,574 --> 00:33:45,368
Woo-hoo!

515
00:33:53,307 --> 00:33:55,033
Hey, honey pie,
where's junior?

516
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:00,935
She's at my mom's.

517
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,799
Where are you going?

518
00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:06,492
The office, Monahan, he'son a mission, I'm telling you.

519
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:10,117
Bullshit, Tony, youare not dressed for work.

520
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,152
It's night.

521
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:13,051
Things, they're a
little more casual.

522
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:16,157
Are you wearing cologne?

523
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:18,608
No, it's the Japanese.

524
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:19,747
They get very--

525
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,923
You are a lying
bastard, you know that?

526
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:26,650
Do you want to destroy
our lives, Tony?

527
00:34:26,754 --> 00:34:28,514
You know what, how about this?

528
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:29,584
How about I help you with that?

529
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:32,104
Let's just destroy everything.

530
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,002
Deborah!

531
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,107
Why not!

532
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:37,558
Why not Tony!

533
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,525
How about this!

534
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:42,494
How about this!

535
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:44,358
No!

536
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:46,394
How about it?

537
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:48,120
Don't, don't do it, Debbie.

538
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:50,916
Either jump or
shut up, will you!

539
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,883
Mind your own
business, you fat ass!

540
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:55,817
Mind my own business,
you white trash!

541
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:58,061
Deb!
Come on inside.

542
00:34:58,165 --> 00:35:00,512
Look, I'm calling the office.

543
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,755
Then call them, Tony!

544
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:04,516
I'm trying to have dinner!

545
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,759
Oh yeah you big pig!

546
00:35:06,863 --> 00:35:08,175
This is you!

547
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:09,072
Hello?

548
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:10,832
We got a problem.

549
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:11,937
Tony, what's up?

550
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,835
You know the rich
chick in the Porsche?

551
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:15,975
She's waiting for me,
but Deb is freaking out.

552
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:16,873
And I can't get down there.

553
00:35:16,976 --> 00:35:17,977
So you got to go.

554
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:19,047
Call the restaurant.

555
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,083
Deb is going to kill herself.

556
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,912
I'm calling the police now.

557
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:23,845
You call the police!

558
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:25,847
And you get the
zookeeper to get you.

559
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:27,884
I got $13 in my pocket.

560
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:31,612
They wouldn't even let
me in to Che Philipe.

561
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:32,889
I'm not asking you to eat.

562
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,650
Just go down there and
apologize for me, OK?

563
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:36,996
You tell your
boss that you have

564
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,689
a life outside of the office.

565
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:42,657
Honey, I am telling him.

566
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:45,591
Mr. Monahan, I am spendingthe evening with my family.

567
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:46,489
And that is that.

568
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:47,386
Uh-huh.

569
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:50,493
Shit.

570
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:05,473
I'm just going to
be a minute or two.

571
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:17,727
- Excuse me?
- Sir, may I help you?

572
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,420
Yeah, I'm looking fora young woman named Lola.

573
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:22,283
This way.

574
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:31,672
Hi.

575
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:32,638
Hi.

576
00:36:32,742 --> 00:36:33,708
I, oh, excuse me.

577
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:36,401
Seat.

578
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:37,816
Thank you.

579
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:40,681
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

580
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:41,820
Tony is not going to make it.

581
00:36:41,923 --> 00:36:43,891
He did his thing.

582
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:48,654
And so he, unfortunately, had--

583
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:50,138
I'm so glad you could come.

584
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,969
I'm glad I don't
have to eat alone.

585
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:58,354
Mademoiselle has orderedthe chateau Latreau, 1977.

586
00:36:58,457 --> 00:37:02,047
Would you care for the same,or perhaps another vintage?

587
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,877
Well, actually, that's--the thing is, I don't.

588
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:06,120
Oh, it's very nice.

589
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,949
You should taste it.

590
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:10,193
She is absolutely correct.

591
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:14,439
It is one of the best bottlesyou can get in the $300 to $500

592
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:15,474
range.

593
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:18,236
Oh, the special
for today for two,

594
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:22,723
which I have already
suggested, is the duck.

595
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:23,689
Would you like to share it?

596
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:24,621
Share it?

597
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:26,934
No, I want my own.

598
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,556
She has quite an appetite, no?

599
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,006
Monsieur?

600
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:32,698
Well, actually, I'm not surethat I'm going to be able to--

601
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:33,561
Table for my guests.

602
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,051
The duck sounds great.

603
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:42,536
I would like a duck.

604
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,228
Two-- two ducks.

605
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:46,229
Oui, oui.

606
00:38:12,428 --> 00:38:16,777
I recommend the Merlot, 1966.

607
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,300
A bit more expensive, but verycomplimentary to the duck.

608
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:23,404
You know, I'm--

609
00:38:23,508 --> 00:38:24,750
I'm not--

610
00:38:24,854 --> 00:38:26,856
Oh, I love that wine.

611
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:31,309
Very good.

612
00:38:40,732 --> 00:38:43,286
So it sounds like you and Tonyare doing a lot of business.

613
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,186
Oh, yeah, well, you
know, we're buying.

614
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:51,190
And we're selling.
What do you do?

615
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:53,710
What is it that you do?

616
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:57,887
Internationalarchitecture landscaping.

617
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,648
We own offices all
around the world.

618
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,443
So you must travel a lot.

619
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,583
- Sometimes.
- That's great.

620
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:05,688
The contract.

621
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,206
Can be.

622
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,934
But since I broke up with myex-boyfriend Prince Alberto

623
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:13,765
III, it's been a bit lonely.

624
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:14,697
I'm sorry.

625
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,698
No, no, no, don't be.

626
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:17,389
He was a jerk.

627
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:18,356
What about you?

628
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:20,081
Me?

629
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:22,463
A guy like you must beinvolved with a beautiful girl.

630
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:27,365
Yeah.

631
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:32,887
Yeah, she's really beautiful.

632
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:34,786
To you and your girl.

633
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,513
Yeah.

634
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:39,929
[applause]

635
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:07,335
Hi.

636
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:08,889
I'm Leanne.
- I remember you.

637
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,028
Your Mike's friend.

638
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:12,444
Yeah, know where he is?

639
00:40:12,548 --> 00:40:13,411
He stood you up?

640
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:14,895
Big time.

641
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:16,068
It's a good thing I'm here.

642
00:40:18,692 --> 00:40:19,520
I love those rings.

643
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:20,418
Thanks.

644
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:21,488
Check this out.

645
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:25,457
Very cool.

646
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:32,844
It would look cool on you.

647
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:36,157
Want a shot of Jagermeister?

648
00:40:36,261 --> 00:40:37,227
Jager's my flavor.

649
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:42,163
Be right back.

650
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:54,452
Focus, focus, focus.

651
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:03,081
A very rare
vintage, which will

652
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:06,912
superbly accompany the salad.

653
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:07,879
Thank you.

654
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:19,718
Aren't you going
to smell the cork?

655
00:41:19,822 --> 00:41:21,651
Smell the cork?

656
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:24,585
It is a $700 bottle of wine.

657
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:28,520
Perfect.

658
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:33,249
Could I have some ice, please?

659
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:34,146
Ice?

660
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,700
Yeah, I'm a little.

661
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:43,535
A flower for the lady.

662
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,432
Ah!

663
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,415
For you.

664
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:07,386
Thank you.

665
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,387
You're welcome.

666
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:16,844
Your girlfriend is very lucky.

667
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:18,881
Why's that?

668
00:42:18,984 --> 00:42:23,851
Because you're
a really nice guy.

669
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:26,336

[dance music]

671
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:45,079
May I recommend a digestivand after dinner drink?

672
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:46,494
Yes.

673
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:54,019
A rare, 90-year-old cognac,like velvet under your throat.

674
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:55,849
Please.

675
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:58,196
Sir?

676
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:00,854
If you wouldn't--
excuse me for a moment.

677
00:43:00,957 --> 00:43:02,890
I'm going to go to the restroom.

678
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:04,996
Don't forget to
wash your hands.

679
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:05,893
Please excuse me.

680
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:10,415

[moaning]

682
00:43:13,418 --> 00:43:14,868
Hello.

683
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:16,317
Thank God you're home.
Listen.

684
00:43:16,421 --> 00:43:17,491
I'm not home.

685
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,805
Benny, I really, really
need your help here, OK?

686
00:43:20,908 --> 00:43:21,702
I told you.

687
00:43:21,806 --> 00:43:22,600
I'm not home.

688
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,015
Wait!

689
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:24,912
Dammit.

690
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,710
[phone ringing]

691
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:32,886
Hello?

692
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:33,818
Tony?

693
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,198
Mikey, what's up?

694
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:36,303
I'm sitting in
a very expensive

695
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:37,718
meal with $3 in your pocket.

696
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:39,133
Where are you?

697
00:43:39,237 --> 00:43:40,376
Where am I?

698
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:41,342
What do you mean, where I am?

699
00:43:41,446 --> 00:43:43,172
you know exactly where I am.

700
00:43:43,275 --> 00:43:44,345
Che Phillipe, huh?

701
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:45,277
Fancy.

702
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:46,416
Fancy.

703
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,763
Oh, Mike, come on.

704
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:49,696
We can't really afford
a place like that.

705
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:51,525
You know that?

706
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,422
You're buying, huh?

707
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:53,907
What's the occasion?

708
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,184
Listen to me.

709
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:58,912
Get down here, and bring
me some money right now.

710
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:00,776
I wish you had
called us earlier.

711
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:01,811
We just ate.

712
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:03,675
Tony, don't do this to me.

713
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:04,918
But you know what?

714
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:06,298
Tell her happy birthday.

715
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:07,817
Don't hang up on me.

716
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:08,784
Happy birthday.

717
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:10,164
Happy birthday.

718
00:44:10,268 --> 00:44:11,718
And thank you for calling.- Don't do that!

719
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:12,684
Bye.

720
00:44:12,788 --> 00:44:13,789
Dammit!

721
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:14,652
Dammit!

722
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,704
Greenbaum?

723
00:44:32,808 --> 00:44:33,740
Mr. Monahan?

724
00:44:33,843 --> 00:44:38,330
What in God's
name are you doing?

725
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:40,332
I-- I--

726
00:44:40,436 --> 00:44:42,507
I-- I--

727
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:46,614
I-- I was feeling a
little dizzy, sir.

728
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:50,204
So I thought I shouldget some fresh fresh air.

729
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:51,999
No, no, Greenbaum.

730
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:56,141
What are you doing here
in this restaurant?

731
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:57,867
Well, I'm--

732
00:44:57,971 --> 00:44:59,662
I'm on a date, sir.

733
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:02,216
Yes, well I'm here on acrucial business meeting.

734
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,460
And I will not
let the Matsutushi

735
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:06,496
group see you like this.

736
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,981
No sir, no, they won't, sir.

737
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:09,051
They won't.

738
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:12,502
Do you realize they

00:55:13,793 --> 00:55:14,656
It's gorgeous!

927
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:15,657
Look!

928
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,038
I don't believe this.

929
00:55:18,142 --> 00:55:22,491
I had no idea you
were doing so well.

930
00:55:22,595 --> 00:55:26,668
Ma, Ma, no, no,
Bernard, get the bags.

931
00:55:26,771 --> 00:55:29,602
You're a dead man.

932
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:33,882
Mike, how much do
you tip out here?

933
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:35,401
I wouldn't worry about it.

934
00:55:35,504 --> 00:55:38,093
Put it away.
- What's right is right.

935
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:44,133
Anything else, sir?

936
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:45,100
No, you know what, Bernard?

937
00:55:45,203 --> 00:55:47,758
Why don't you take
the weekend off?

938
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:50,105
Bernard?

939
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:51,175
Oh, really, ma'am, you don't--

940
00:55:51,278 --> 00:55:52,141
Your tip.

941
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:58,009
$10 you gave him, Doris?

942
00:55:58,113 --> 00:56:01,841
Are you trying to ruin us?

943
00:56:01,944 --> 00:56:06,259
Look at this place!

944
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,193
It's so beautiful!

945
00:56:09,296 --> 00:56:12,403
And so tasteful.

946
00:56:12,507 --> 00:56:13,646
Very impressive, son.

947
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:18,167
I knew you'd make us proudout here, but this place!

948
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:21,308
Dad, Ma, this is Lola.

949
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:25,071
This is the girlfriendwe've heard so much about?

950
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:27,314
Girlfriend?

951
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:30,697
- She means fiance?
- Fiance.

952
00:56:30,801 --> 00:56:34,667
I told you he was
hiding something, Doris.

953
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,600
Welcome to the family, dear.

954
00:56:42,468 --> 00:56:43,261
Laura.

955
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:44,159
Lola.

956
00:56:44,262 --> 00:56:46,403
Lola, so pretty.

957
00:56:46,506 --> 00:56:49,026
Enough with the
kisses, Max, enough.

958
00:56:49,129 --> 00:56:50,337
OK, OK.

959
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:51,925
A little something for you.

960
00:56:55,688 --> 00:56:58,069
Thank you.

961
00:56:58,173 --> 00:56:59,933
Why don't you shoe
them to our room?

962
00:57:00,037 --> 00:57:01,694
Dinner will be ready soon.

963
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:02,591
I'll get the bags.

964
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:04,524
Let me give you a hand.

965
00:57:04,628 --> 00:57:07,009
Our own room.
Thank you, dear.

966
00:57:12,705 --> 00:57:15,811
Beautiful table, so festive.

967
00:57:15,915 --> 00:57:17,744
Where did you learn this, dear?

968
00:57:17,848 --> 00:57:21,023
I learned everything
I know from mi mama.

969
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:23,647
So where is your mother?

970
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,581
In Paris, with my
Papa in business.

971
00:57:26,684 --> 00:57:28,893
And what sort ofbusiness is your family in?

972
00:57:28,997 --> 00:57:30,067
Gardening.

973
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:33,864
Oh, you mean like gardeners?

974
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:35,866
Dad.

975
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:37,868
Architectural landscaping.

976
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:42,182
We create parks andgardens all over the world.

977
00:57:42,286 --> 00:57:43,460
That's quite a
big chunk there.

978
00:57:43,563 --> 00:57:46,635
How does your fatherhandle that all by himself?

979
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:53,021
My uncle Jose, he is in chargeof the entire United States.

980
00:57:53,124 --> 00:57:55,299
Well, you tell your uncle
Jose, parks and gardens

981
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:56,956
need plumbing too, you know?

982
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:58,923
Dad, come on.

983
00:57:59,027 --> 00:58:00,477
Oh, come on.

984
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:04,446
Tell me, Lola, where isyour family from originally?

985
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,516
Guadalajara.

986
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,693
Guadalajara, that's
in the Mediterranean.

987
00:58:09,796 --> 00:58:10,694
Doris.

988
00:58:10,797 --> 00:58:11,798
It's in Africa.

989
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:15,077
Actually, it's in Mexico.

990
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:17,632
Please, help yourselves.

991
00:58:17,735 --> 00:58:18,943
What is this?

992
00:58:19,047 --> 00:58:20,842
Tostadas.

993
00:58:20,945 --> 00:58:22,188
Try it.

994
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:23,085
Oh.

995
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:29,402
Michael, I'm so happy.

996
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,130
I always knew you would
find a nice Jewish girl.

997
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:35,097
Yeah, they're all nicetill after they get married.

998
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:37,168
Dad, she's not like that, OK?

999
00:58:37,272 --> 00:58:38,376
You've got a
prenuptial, right?

1000
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,516
Dad.

1001
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,034
How do we know Little
Miss Guadalajara here

1002
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:42,691
isn't some kind of gold digger?

1003
00:58:42,795 --> 00:58:44,210
Dad.

1004
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:46,419
Is everything all right?

1005
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,973
Great, great, sweetie.

1006
00:58:49,077 --> 00:58:49,871
Yes.

1007
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:54,807
This looks so tasty.

1008
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:06,577
[gasping]

1009
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:07,751
Ma.

1010
00:59:07,854 --> 00:59:08,614
Hot.

1011
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:14,309
Drink some water.

1012
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:19,072
It's just very hot
salsa. you'll be OK.

1013
00:59:19,176 --> 00:59:20,833
I'll get some ice.

1014
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:24,146
Did you see that?

1015
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,079
I knew it.

1016
00:59:26,183 --> 00:59:27,702
Mom and dad, don't worry.

1017
00:59:27,805 --> 00:59:29,151
We already talked to a rabbi.

1018
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:30,705
And she's going to convert.

1019
00:59:30,808 --> 00:59:31,706
She is?

1020
00:59:31,809 --> 00:59:33,190
Oh yeah, definitely.

1021
00:59:33,293 --> 00:59:35,675
But, you know, it's kind
of a very touchy issue.

1022
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:37,850
So don't bring it up.

1023
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:39,403
No, no, not a word.

1024
00:59:41,785 --> 00:59:42,579
Here's the ice.

1025
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:44,097
Are you OK?

1026
00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:47,031
Much better, thank you.

1027
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:50,414
So tell me, how
long did the rabbi

1028
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:54,349
say the conversion would take?

1029
00:59:54,452 --> 00:59:55,350
Excuse me?

1030
00:59:55,453 --> 00:59:57,145
You know, the rabbi,
sweetie, that we

1031
00:59:57,248 --> 00:59:59,734
went to visit the other week.

1032
00:59:59,837 --> 01:00:02,150
Oh yes, how long?

1033
01:00:02,253 --> 01:00:04,531
[speaking spanish]

1034
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:06,741
Pardon?

1035
01:00:06,844 --> 01:00:09,122
Half an hour.

1036
01:00:09,226 --> 01:00:11,400
Half an hour?

1037
01:00:11,504 --> 01:00:13,264
New age rabbi, very quick.

1038
01:00:13,368 --> 01:00:14,576
Oh, yes, speedy rabbi.

1039
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,993
In LA, people convert sooften that it's very easy.

1040
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:20,582
Great little place,
Jew can be a Jew too.

1041
01:00:20,686 --> 01:00:23,240
You can zip in, you zip
out, boom, you're a Jew.

1042
01:00:23,343 --> 01:00:24,137
Quick.

1043
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:25,345
Drive through temple.

1044
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:26,450
[laughter]

1045
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:33,733

Thanks Dad.

1049
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:40,119
You did good.

1050
01:00:40,222 --> 01:00:41,534
I'm so happy you guys came.

1051
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,431

Goodnight, Dad.

1056
01:00:50,716 --> 01:00:53,166
What?

1057
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,548
Why don't you tell me
what's going on here?

1058
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,343
First I'm your girlfriend,then your fiance,

1059
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:58,413
now I'm converting?

1060
01:00:58,516 --> 01:00:59,863
By tomorrow we'll
have three kids.

1061
01:00:59,966 --> 01:01:01,727
Everything is fine!Everything was going fine.

1062
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:04,143
Your cross just slipped out.

1063
01:01:04,246 --> 01:01:05,627
Now you're
blaming my religion?

1064
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:08,699
[speaking spanish]

1065
01:01:08,803 --> 01:01:09,700
Speak to me in English.

1066
01:01:09,804 --> 01:01:10,632
You want English?

1067
01:01:10,736 --> 01:01:11,806
How is this?

1068
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:12,876
Buenas noches.

1069
01:01:12,979 --> 01:01:14,360
Mike, dear?

1070
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:17,294
I need a glass of water
for your father's teeth.

1071
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:20,090
Oh, downstairs,
Ma, in the kitchen.

1072
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:21,125
Can I get it for you?

1073
01:01:21,229 --> 01:01:24,163
Oh, no, no, I'll go get it.

1074
01:01:24,266 --> 01:01:26,993
You go inside and
get some sleep.

1075
01:01:27,097 --> 01:01:27,994
Goodnight.

1076
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:29,616
Goodnight.

1077
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,514
Goodnight.

Night.

1079
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:32,481
Goodnight.

1080
01:01:36,382 --> 01:01:38,418
Don't tell me you
want to sleep in here.

1081
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:39,661
I don't have a choice.

1082
01:01:39,765 --> 01:01:41,836
I said you could stay inmy house, not in my bed.

1083
01:01:41,939 --> 01:01:43,113
I'll sleep on the floor.

1084
01:01:43,216 --> 01:01:45,287
There are five other
bedrooms in this house.

1085
01:01:45,391 --> 01:01:46,633
But my parents are outside.

1086
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:48,566
How would they know?

1087
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:50,707
You don't know my mother.[knocking]

1088
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:51,708
Michael?

1089
01:01:51,811 --> 01:01:54,434
Michael are you there?

1090
01:01:54,538 --> 01:01:56,954
Come in, Ma.

1091
01:01:57,058 --> 01:01:59,336
Just wanted to say
goodnight again, dear.

1092
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:01,338
And thank you for dinner.

1093
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:06,274
Those tostadas, I'll
never forget them.

1094
01:02:06,377 --> 01:02:07,171
You're welcome.

1095
01:02:07,275 --> 01:02:08,448
Goodnight.

1096
01:02:08,552 --> 01:02:09,449
Goodnight, Ma.

1097
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:13,522
Get out of my bed!

1098
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:14,420
Out!

1099
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:15,317
Out!

1100
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:31,471
Can I help you?

1101
01:02:31,575 --> 01:02:32,645
She's got a bad tooth.

1102
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,646
Mr. Greco's in Vegas.

1103
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,786
But he said the doctor
will fix her up.

1104
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,098
But it's not possible.

1105
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:38,513
What do you mean it's notpossible, you little bitch,

1106
01:02:38,616 --> 01:02:39,790
I'm in pain!

1107
01:02:39,894 --> 01:02:41,481
He's not here.

1108
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:42,759
What's going on?

1109
01:02:42,862 --> 01:02:44,001
Not here, huh?

1110
01:02:44,105 --> 01:02:45,209
Not here?

1111
01:02:45,313 --> 01:02:46,728
We want you to fix her tooth.

1112
01:02:46,832 --> 01:02:48,074
Find a dentist.

1113
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:49,489
Don't mess with us.

1114
01:02:49,593 --> 01:02:51,319
You either fix her tooth, or I'mgoing to shoot you in the face.

1115
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:58,844
No, no, the dentist
will fix her tooth.

1116
01:02:58,947 --> 01:03:00,155
Take her over there
in the dental room.

1117
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:02,813
We'll be right there.

1118
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:05,920
Don't touch me.

1119
01:03:06,023 --> 01:03:08,198
Come on, stupid.

1120
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:10,545
You are so stupid,
and you're fat.

1121
01:03:10,648 --> 01:03:12,340
What the hell is going on?

1122
01:03:12,443 --> 01:03:13,686
- You have to fix her tooth.- Me?

1123
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,652
I'm not a dentist.

1124
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:16,689
And I'm not the
owner of this house.

1125
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,586
What?

1126
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,105
This is not my house.

1127
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:20,382
What do you mean
it's not your house?

1128
01:03:20,486 --> 01:03:22,626
Who the hell's house is it?

1129
01:03:22,729 --> 01:03:24,386
I also a confession to make.

1130
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:26,078
This house belongs to my boss.

1131
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:27,113
He's on vacation.

1132
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:28,356
I'm just house sitting.

1133
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:30,082
He's the dentist.

1134
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:31,290
You mean, my
parents are sleeping

1135
01:03:31,393 --> 01:03:32,809
in the house of some dentist?

1136
01:03:32,912 --> 01:03:33,671
Yes, but it's OK.

1137
01:03:33,775 --> 01:03:36,502
He's away for two weeks.

1138
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:37,986
I'm dead.

1139
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:41,024
I'm so dead.

1140
01:03:41,127 --> 01:03:41,956
Doc!

1141
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:42,853
She's in pain!

1142
01:03:42,957 --> 01:03:43,889
Let's go!

1143
01:03:43,992 --> 01:03:46,270
- You have to do it.
- Are you crazy?

1144
01:03:46,374 --> 01:03:47,789
I don't know how to do that.

1145
01:03:47,893 --> 01:03:49,446
So pretend, they're dangerous.

1146
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:51,206
They're hit men.

1147
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:52,794
Doc, we're losing her.

1148
01:03:52,898 --> 01:03:54,900
If she dies, everyone dies.

1149
01:03:55,003 --> 01:03:57,661
Michael, do you have guests?

1150
01:03:57,764 --> 01:03:59,870
Go back to sleep, OK.

1151
01:03:59,974 --> 01:04:01,527
Please, go back to bed.

1152
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,357
Don't talk to your mother likethat, you little piece of shit.

1153
01:04:04,461 --> 01:04:05,255
Sorry, Ma.

1154
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:08,396
We have to go.

1155
01:04:08,499 --> 01:04:11,882
Hello, hello, I'm Doris.

1156
01:04:11,986 --> 01:04:13,573
Hi, I'm Louis.

1157
01:04:13,677 --> 01:04:15,921
What's taking so long?

1158
01:04:16,024 --> 01:04:17,612
Let's go, hurry up.

1159
01:04:17,715 --> 01:04:18,509
You go fix him a drink.

1160
01:04:18,613 --> 01:04:19,579
And I'll take care of her.

1161
01:04:19,683 --> 01:04:21,927
OK, let's just have
a drink over here.

1162
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:27,415
Just give me some drugs, lady.

1163
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:30,349
So Louis, what
exactly do you do?

1164
01:04:30,452 --> 01:04:31,868
I run the show for Mr. Greco.

1165
01:04:31,971 --> 01:04:35,216
Show business, are you
an actor, or a writer?

1166
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:36,355
What do you do?

1167
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:38,219
I make people disappear.

1168
01:04:38,322 --> 01:04:40,807
A magician?

1169
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,706
Splendid, have a cookie.

1170
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:45,640
I made them myself, fat free.

1171
01:04:45,743 --> 01:04:47,090
Can I have two?

1172
01:04:47,193 --> 01:04:48,332
Sure.

1173
01:04:48,436 --> 01:04:49,230
Thank you.

1174
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:52,440
Doctor, she's ready.

1175
01:04:52,543 --> 01:04:54,856
OK, we're going
to fix her right up.

1176
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,134
So don't worry.

1177
01:04:57,238 --> 01:05:02,277
OK, now, where does it hurt?

1178
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:07,179
OK, do you brush much?

1179
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:08,076
Is this an interview?

1180
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,802
You gonna fix my tooth?

1181
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:10,734
Sure.

1182
01:05:10,837 --> 01:05:13,461
Open wide.

1183
01:05:13,564 --> 01:05:14,358
Aye!

1184
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,847
Excuse me.

1185
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:22,125
It's her wisdom tooth.

1186
01:05:22,228 --> 01:05:23,402
It's infected.

1187
01:05:23,505 --> 01:05:24,403
What do you want me to do?

1188
01:05:24,506 --> 01:05:25,852
- You have to pull it?
- Are you crazy?

1189
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:26,888
I can't pull a tooth.

1190
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:27,785
You have to!

1191
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:29,132
I cannot do it!

1192
01:05:29,235 --> 01:05:31,444
What's with the chitchat?

1193
01:05:31,548 --> 01:05:33,101
We're going to be withyou in just a jiffy, sir.

1194
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:35,172
We're just a little--
we're just consulting.

1195
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:36,449
You got to try the
old lady's cookies.

1196
01:05:36,553 --> 01:05:37,554
They're unbelievable.

1197
01:05:37,657 --> 01:05:38,658
What kind?

1198
01:05:38,762 --> 01:05:39,832
Oatmeal, fat free, come on.

1199
01:05:43,905 --> 01:05:44,802
Ow!

1200
01:05:44,906 --> 01:05:46,804
Ow!

1201
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:48,910
Just give her something.

1202
01:05:49,014 --> 01:05:50,808
Novocaine, it
will knock her out.

1203
01:05:50,912 --> 01:05:52,293
Good.

1204
01:05:52,396 --> 01:05:53,777
[moaning]

1205
01:05:55,365 --> 01:05:56,745
Me?

1206
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:59,093
Yes, you're the dentist.

1207
01:05:59,196 --> 01:06:00,784
This will do it?

1208
01:06:00,887 --> 01:06:02,993
Oh yes, she will
sleep for three days.

1209
01:06:12,175 --> 01:06:13,831
Is this going to hurt?

1210
01:06:13,935 --> 01:06:15,109
No, you'll just
feel a little prick.

1211
01:06:15,212 --> 01:06:17,180
It won't hurt.
I promise.

1212
01:06:17,283 --> 01:06:18,595
[yelp]

1213
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:27,604

1214
01:06:27,707 --> 01:06:29,986
Relax, it will be very quick.

[shrieking]

1216
01:06:39,823 --> 01:06:44,207
So when the medication wearsoff, she should be like new.

1217
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:45,484
Doc, your mom's
the best, all right?

1218
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:47,555
So you better have
respect for her.

1219
01:06:47,658 --> 01:06:49,212
OK.

1220
01:06:49,315 --> 01:06:50,730
Yeah, you better have respect.

1221
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:51,628
Thank you.

1222
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:52,629
You're welcome.

1223
01:06:52,732 --> 01:06:54,907
Oh, you should try this shit.

1224
01:07:00,775 --> 01:07:02,259
Thank God it's over.

1225
01:07:02,363 --> 01:07:05,090
What are you
trying to do to me?

1226
01:07:05,193 --> 01:07:06,677
I thought I was helping you.

1227
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:07,575
Helping me?

1228
01:07:07,678 --> 01:07:08,507
How?

1229
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,164
How are you helping me?

1230
01:07:10,267 --> 01:07:11,958
By letting you
stay in my house.

1231
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,684
It's not your house.

1232
01:07:13,788 --> 01:07:15,272
Your parents don't know that.

1233
01:07:15,376 --> 01:07:16,411
Relax.

1234
01:07:16,515 --> 01:07:17,654
Relax?

1235
01:07:17,757 --> 01:07:19,138
How would you feel
if your mom was

1236
01:07:19,242 --> 01:07:20,691
sleeping in some
random dentist's bed

1237
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:23,487
serving cookies to a hit man?

1238
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:25,696
I thought I had
honesty problems.

1239
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,526
You know something,
you're right?

1240
01:07:27,629 --> 01:07:28,527
You want honesty.

1241
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:29,597
I'll give you honest.

1242
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:30,805
Why don't we wake
up your parents

1243
01:07:30,908 --> 01:07:34,912
and tell them the truth,right now mister big shot.

1244
01:07:35,016 --> 01:07:37,639
Are you trying
to destroy my life?

1245
01:07:37,743 --> 01:07:40,746
You are not the onlyone taking risks here, OK?

1246
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:43,335
If my boss knew what
I was doing for you,

1247
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:45,371
I would never get my
work permit, never.

1248
01:07:45,475 --> 01:07:48,098
I would lose everything.

1249
01:07:48,202 --> 01:07:49,513
I don't know why I'm
trying to help you.

1250
01:07:49,617 --> 01:07:50,583
You don't like me?

1251
01:07:50,687 --> 01:07:52,689
Fine, I'm not crazy
about you either.

1252
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:54,000
But just keep this
up for two more days.

1253
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:55,209
And then you never have
to talk to me again.

1254
01:07:55,312 --> 01:07:56,417
- Fine.
- OK, fine.

1255
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,349
Fine.

1256
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:59,834

She's not here.

1264

It's not a man.
It's Mike.

Hi.

1279

about you, Jose.

1289
01:10:09,895 --> 01:10:11,345
We didn't come at a bad time?

1290
01:10:11,448 --> 01:10:13,209
Oh, no, not at all.

1291
01:10:13,312 --> 01:10:15,280
Maybe we should
leave, Jose, no?

1292
01:10:15,383 --> 01:10:17,178
No, please come in.

1293
01:10:17,282 --> 01:10:21,286
We have so much to talk about.

1294
01:10:21,389 --> 01:10:23,702

1296
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:40,236
How was your trip?

1297
01:10:40,339 --> 01:10:43,377
Bumpy, but worth it.

1298
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,311
Vacations are very important.

1299
01:10:46,414 --> 01:10:48,416
You've been very kind to Lolita.

1300
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,487
I thank you.

1301
01:10:50,591 --> 01:10:53,835

But definitely thank
you for the invite.

1319
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:26,100
Yeah, we got a little tied up.

1320

You and me?

1327
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:03,309
Yeah, I could help
you a lot, you know?

1328
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:05,346
I'm very good at what I do.

1329
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:06,554
I know.

1330
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:10,075
Lola told me you are thebest, but very expensive.

1331
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:12,388
Jose, we're family.

1332
01:13:12,491 --> 01:13:14,251
I'll give you my best bargain.

1333
01:13:14,355 --> 01:13:16,875
In fact, first job for free.

1334
01:13:16,978 --> 01:13:18,048
Really?

1335
01:13:18,152 --> 01:13:19,947
Damn right, you tell
me what the problem is.

1336
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:20,844
I'll fix it.

1337
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:24,779
I don't know.

1338
01:13:24,883 --> 01:13:26,091
Come on, you ask anyone.

1339
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:28,990
I keep my clients very happy.

1340
01:13:29,094 --> 01:13:31,890
Actually, I am
missing a tooth.

1341
01:13:31,993 --> 01:13:33,305
A tooth?

1342
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,307
Right here.

1343
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,204
Oh, I see.

1344
01:13:36,308 --> 01:13:37,309
Well, that's nothing.

1345
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,828
If I were you, I'd have
them all pulled out.

1346
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:40,381
All pulled out, my teeth?

1347
01:13:40,485 --> 01:13:43,729
Absolutely, that's what I did.

1348
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:45,524
But don't let this
come between us.

1349
01:13:45,628 --> 01:13:47,975
You and me, we should set upan appointment for tomorrow?

Absolutely.

1352
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:10,549
Moved in on my turf, Mikey.

1353
01:14:10,653 --> 01:14:13,138
You mean I got screwed
with your turf, Tony.

1354
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,277
You know what?

1355
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:17,142
I'm sorry about the
whole restaurant thing.

1356
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:20,559
But come on, Mikey,
the gal is mine.

1357
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,461
You're a sick person, Tony.

1358
01:14:25,564 --> 01:14:26,496
Very sick.

1359

This is a party.

1360
01:14:27,808 --> 01:14:30,258
I'm having so much fun, honey.

1361
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:31,812
Where's the hostess
of the house?

1362
01:14:31,915 --> 01:14:35,194
I haven't been able to see him.

1363
01:14:35,298 --> 01:14:36,264

1366
01:14:43,858 --> 01:14:46,309

That's what he told me.

1372
01:14:59,633 --> 01:15:00,944
Uh-huh.

1373
01:15:01,048 --> 01:15:02,808
I've been dead
for three years.

1374
01:15:02,912 --> 01:15:05,535
Have I been dead

1375
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:09,505

First our trip is ruined
by this stupid bug.

Doctor?

1434
01:18:58,664 --> 01:19:00,701
I'm the owner of

01:19:00,805 --> 01:19:01,598
You are not.

1436
01:19:01,702 --> 01:19:02,565
This is my son's house.

1437
01:19:02,668 --> 01:19:04,256
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

It-- it's his house.

1440
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:14,025

1441
01:19:14,128 --> 01:19:17,062
Lola, is this true?

1442
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:20,031
This is the real Dr. Henson.

1443
01:19:20,134 --> 01:19:24,760
Mikey, you mean this
is not your house?

1444

What?

1446
01:19:29,488 --> 01:19:33,285
I just said that
to impress you.

1447
01:19:33,389 --> 01:19:34,839
You are not a dentist?

1448
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:35,736
Me?

1449
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,531
No, I'm a plumber.

1450
01:19:37,634 --> 01:19:40,258
A plumber?

1451
01:19:40,361 --> 01:19:42,018
And you want wanted to
pull out all my teeth.

1452
01:19:42,122 --> 01:19:43,192
What?

1453
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:44,193
All right, that is it.

1454
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:47,058
Everybody out, go!

1455
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:52,649
Come on, out, out,everybody, go, go, get out.

Lola, not only are youfired, but you can forget

1458
01:19:56,999 --> 01:19:58,379
about your legalization papers.

1459
01:19:58,483 --> 01:20:00,243
Now, get out.

1460
01:20:00,347 --> 01:20:01,866

What can I do for you?

1467
01:20:23,025 --> 01:20:25,475
Forget about what
you can do for me.

1468
01:20:25,579 --> 01:20:26,407
Look at what you did to her.

1469
01:20:29,445 --> 01:20:31,102
I don't understand.

1471
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:35,175
Yeah, little cookie,
I know it's him.

1472
01:20:35,278 --> 01:20:37,798
Ow!

1473
01:20:37,902 --> 01:20:38,695
No!

1474
01:20:46,186 --> 01:20:50,535
I guess a blow job
is out of the question.

1475
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:52,709
Oh no!

1476
01:20:52,813 --> 01:20:55,989
I-- I can glue it.

1477
01:20:56,092 --> 01:20:58,957
Let's get out of here.

1478
01:20:59,061 --> 01:21:00,959
I'm going to take
you for a mocha.

1479
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:05,861
I'm so sorry.

1480
01:21:05,964 --> 01:21:08,864
But, but what
are we going to do?

1481
01:21:08,967 --> 01:21:12,868
The dentist is going tocall [speaking spanish]..

1482
01:21:12,971 --> 01:21:15,594
It doesn't matter.

1483
01:21:15,698 --> 01:21:18,528
I'm going home tomorrow.

1484
01:21:18,632 --> 01:21:19,702
Going home?

1485
01:21:19,805 --> 01:21:22,705
[speaking spanish]

1486
01:21:22,808 --> 01:21:26,709
Don't you see
everything I did?

1487
01:21:26,812 --> 01:21:31,093
I-- I've hurt you all.

1488
01:21:31,196 --> 01:21:32,680
And I'm not going
to do it any more.

1489
01:21:48,593 --> 01:21:51,147
I want to go to
the airport now.

1490
01:21:51,251 --> 01:21:53,425
I told you, Max, our
special fare tickets

1491
01:21:53,529 --> 01:21:56,670
are only good for tomorrow.

1492
01:21:56,773 --> 01:21:58,499
I've never been so
humiliated in my life.

1493
01:21:58,603 --> 01:21:59,397
I'm sorry, Dad.

1494
01:22:02,503 --> 01:22:04,436
Where did I go wrong?

1495
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,542
How did I screw up?

1496
01:22:06,645 --> 01:22:10,304
I tried so hard to
guide you, to give

1497
01:22:10,408 --> 01:22:12,203
you opportunities I never had.

1498
01:22:12,306 --> 01:22:13,583
Dad, you don't understand.

1499
01:22:13,687 --> 01:22:15,723
It's not about opportunities.

1500
01:22:15,827 --> 01:22:18,209
Michael, I'm not finished!

1501
01:22:18,312 --> 01:22:19,555
Why the hell do
you think I named

1502
01:22:19,658 --> 01:22:21,557
the company Greenbaum and Son?

1503
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,628
That's your problem, Dad.

1504
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:25,595
It's all about
you, what you feel,

1505
01:22:25,699 --> 01:22:27,563
what you think I should do.

1506
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:29,392
I have my own plans.

1507
01:22:29,496 --> 01:22:30,497
I have my own dream.

1508
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,394
Dream?

1509
01:22:31,498 --> 01:22:32,948
This is a nightmare!

1510
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:34,811
Max, your blood pressure.

1511
01:22:34,915 --> 01:22:36,158
He lied to us?

1512
01:22:36,261 --> 01:22:37,849
That's because nothing Iever do is good enough for you!

1513
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:38,884
You hear this, Doris?

1514
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:40,679
Now it's my fault
that he's a failure.

1515
01:22:40,783 --> 01:22:42,819
It's not about
success or failure, Dad.

1516
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:48,204
I don't love you because
you're a plumber.

1517
01:22:50,931 --> 01:22:53,865
I love you because
you're my father.

1518
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:57,041
It would be nice if
you could do the same.

1519
01:22:57,144 --> 01:23:02,356
If you loved me, if
you loved your mother,

1520
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,633
you'd move back home.

1521
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,329
I can't do that, dad.

1522
01:23:09,432 --> 01:23:11,434
Then there's nothing
more to talk about.

1523
01:23:44,467 --> 01:23:45,744
Are you sure?

1524
01:23:45,848 --> 01:23:47,367

1525

I'm so sorry that
things got messed up.

1531
01:24:07,697 --> 01:24:11,218
No, it's my fault.

1532
01:24:11,322 --> 01:24:14,635
Tell your parents I'm sorry.

1533
01:24:14,739 --> 01:24:19,192

Hi, is Dr. Henson there?

1539
01:25:21,254 --> 01:25:23,359
It's urgent.

1540
01:25:23,463 --> 01:25:24,878
Dr. Henson, it's for you.

This is Dr. Henson,
can I help you?

Dr. Henson, hi,
it's Mike Greenbaum.

1544
01:25:32,748 --> 01:25:34,370
I was at your
house this weekend.

1545
01:25:34,474 --> 01:25:37,373
It wasn't Lola's
fault. It was mine.

1546
01:25:37,477 --> 01:25:38,719
Is there any way
I could maybe get

1547
01:25:38,823 --> 01:25:42,033
her number from you, or maybeher address or something?

1548
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,725
You listen to me,
you little twerp.

1549
01:25:44,829 --> 01:25:48,626
If you even step intothe 90210 zip code again,

1550
01:25:48,729 --> 01:25:49,592
I will have you arrested!

1551

Ow!

1552
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:00,051
She's here.

1553
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:12,546
Excuse me, hold on!

1554
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:14,514
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Where are you going?

1561
01:27:36,389 --> 01:27:37,666
Home to Guadalajara.

1562
01:27:37,769 --> 01:27:39,150
But your audition
is in two hours.

1563
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,047
It's too late.

1564
01:27:40,151 --> 01:27:41,117
It doesn't matter.

1565
01:27:41,221 --> 01:27:42,602
Yes, yes, it does.

1566
01:27:42,705 --> 01:27:45,467
She has no papers.

1567
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:48,746
It's all over, Mike.

1568
01:27:48,849 --> 01:27:50,057
No, no, no, it's not.

1569
01:27:50,161 --> 01:27:52,267
There's nothing we can do.

1570
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:55,373
We can get married.

1571
01:27:55,477 --> 01:27:56,271
What?

1572
01:28:09,353 --> 01:28:11,734
I-- I love you.

1573
01:28:16,843 --> 01:28:23,228
Would-- would you
marry me, please?

1574
01:28:36,863 --> 01:28:37,657
Please.

Oh no, look at the line.

01:29:27,707 --> 01:29:30,572
Hi, I am really
sorry to bother you.

1580
01:29:30,675 --> 01:29:32,159
But she has to besomewhere by 5:00 o'clock.

1581
01:29:32,263 --> 01:29:33,437
Is there any way
possible we could

1582
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,197
maybe just go in front of you?

1583
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:38,131
No, we've been waiting inthis line for three hours.

1584
01:29:38,234 --> 01:29:41,134
Please, please, it isreally, really important.

1585
01:29:41,237 --> 01:29:44,379
What part of no
didn't you understand?

1586
01:29:44,482 --> 01:29:45,794
She's dying.

1587
01:29:45,897 --> 01:29:47,243
She is?

1588
01:29:47,347 --> 01:29:50,212
Yeah, she could
go at any minute.

1589
01:29:50,315 --> 01:29:51,731
It's my last wish.

1590
01:29:51,834 --> 01:29:52,628
That's too bad.

1591
01:29:52,732 --> 01:29:55,424
Come on.

1592
01:29:55,528 --> 01:29:57,530
Paul, how can you
be so insensitive?

1593
01:29:57,633 --> 01:29:59,877
Look at the poor thing.

1594
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:02,880
Here you go, honey,
you go right ahead.

1595
01:30:02,983 --> 01:30:05,607
Thank you.

1596
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:08,161
Great, what has
gotten into your brain?

1597
01:30:08,264 --> 01:30:10,750
We've been waiting inthis line for three hours.

1598
01:30:10,853 --> 01:30:13,718
Oh, me, me, me, me,it's all about you, is it?

1599
01:30:13,822 --> 01:30:15,271
Obviously, the
sacrament of marriage

1600
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:16,894
means nothing to a man like you.

1601
01:30:16,997 --> 01:30:18,033
What are you saying?

1602
01:30:18,136 --> 01:30:19,931
I'm saying that I do
not wish to exchange

1603
01:30:20,035 --> 01:30:21,554
the vows of marriage
with a man like you.

1604
01:30:21,657 --> 01:30:22,934
No, Darlene, don't say that.

1605
01:30:23,038 --> 01:30:24,349
Come on.

We're in a little
bit of a rush today.

1610
01:30:34,394 --> 01:30:36,500
Can you kind of
cut to the chase?

1611
01:30:36,603 --> 01:30:37,639
What?

1612
01:30:37,742 --> 01:30:38,605
We do.

1613
01:30:38,709 --> 01:30:39,606

That was the last number.

1626

She missed her time.
