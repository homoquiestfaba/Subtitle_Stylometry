And why are we having a town council meeting here?

12
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,600
You said if you got elected

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,240
you'd get the town hall finished once and for all.

14
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,790
Once and for all, that's what you said.

15
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,563
We hit a snag, Hap, that's all.

16
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,563
Find us a doctor yet?

17
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:01,570
(indistinct chatter)

18
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,650
I call this meeting of the St. Nicholas

19
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,640
veteran committee to order.

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,123
First, on the agenda we have just got word

21
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:13,110
that St. Nicholas has been named one of the top

22
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,845
100 towns of populations under 1,500 in America.

23
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:18,861
(group chuckling and clapping)

24
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:21,260
That's wonderful.

25
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,390
Obviously, we're,

26
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,420
we're hoping that this is going to boost our tourist trade.

27
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,030
It better.

28
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,610
Second on the agenda,

29
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,220
selection of the honoree for this year's

30
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,890
grand electrician of the tree lighting ceremony.

31
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,308
Almost everyone in town's already been honored.

32
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:37,020
Some of them nine or 10 times.

33
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,530
We need more townspeople.

34
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,580
We need a doctor.

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,640
Who wants to live in the town without a doctor?

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,270
Now, what have you been doing about finding us a doctor?

37
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,410
Well Hap, I ran ads

38
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,500
all over the country.

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,260
And?
This is our latest response.

40
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,970
It's another rejection.

41
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,020
This one's from a doctor in Nome, Alaska.

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,780
And he doesn't wanna live here?

43
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,320
Too remote, he says.

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,153
I don't get it.

45
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,870
I mean, we got a skating rink.

46
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,330
We got the St. Nicholas Literary Society.

47
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,360
We got the world's largest hay bale.

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,660
People don't know paradise when they see it.

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,610
Maybe it's because we got a woman mayor.

50
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,240
We got a woman sheriff.

51
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,361
I didn't vote for you.

52
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,210
Well, I didn't vote for you either, you old Scrooge.

53
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,043
(chuckling)

54
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:19,050
Now everybody, listen up.

55
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,452
Hap's right.

56
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,920
If we don't get a doctor by January first,

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,360
we're gonna have to close the hospital.

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,850
And then without either one of them,

59
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,580
who's gonna wanna raise their children here?

60
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,690
Who's gonna wanna retire here?

61
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,840
Kinda hard driving three hours to the nearest hospital

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,610
when you're having a heart attack.

63
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,940
Doesn't anybody here know a good gall dern doctor?

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,773
I do.

65
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,740
Bob, I know it's your son and all, but get real.

66
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,910
Mike will never come back here.

67
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,470
Broke my heart when he left the first time.

68
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,303
Mine too.

69
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,170
Well, just trying to help.

70
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,553
How's Mike been since his wife passed away?

71
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,210
It's been four years and

72
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,430
he's not over it yet.

73
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,350
You don't never get over it.

74
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,183
Yeah.

75
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:07,693
No, but you gotta get on with your life.

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,670
He might be better off here.

77
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,837
He sure would.

78
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,053
It's a moot point.

79
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,763
Let's go on.

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,650
Didn't Mike used to be kind of sweet on you?

81
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,770
Oh Hap, we were kids.

82
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,664
He's coming home for Christmas, you know?

83
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,242
Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything, Bob.

84
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:29,790
Why don't we make him grand electrician this year?

85
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,000
Hello?
Yeah.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,944
And the mayor can ask him to stay on.

87
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,567
Excuse me!

88
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,467
Now don't go doing too much.

89
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:36,300
You'll scare him away.

90
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,830
I have to declare right now

91
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,980
that this idea does not have the endorsement

92
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,250
of the mayoral office.

93
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,780
You don't have an office.

94
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,274
I will.

95
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:45,187
That's a great idea.

96
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:48,000
(indistinct chatter)

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,060
Mark my words.

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,340
Mike Greiser will never come back here for good.

99
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,133
Please, listen to me!

100
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,714
Just don't want you to get hurt again.

101
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,930
So what is going on with you Mike?

102
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,150
A year ago you would've never given up a case like this.

103
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,790
Single parent thing.

104
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,940
I promised Jilly I'd take her out Christmas shopping.

105
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,490
And as soon as I was ready to walk out the door

106
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,450
this myocardia infraction walked in.

107
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,180
You can't break a promise to a kid, Fred.

108
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,250
Not at Christmastime.

109
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,150
Don't I know it.

110
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,580
Well, if you're really serious about giving it up

111
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,263
I'll do it.

112
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,240
Thanks.

113
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,073
Thank you.

114
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:34,160
(indistinct chatter)

115
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,793
Mike, you okay?

116
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:38,670
To tell you the truth Hal, I'm not sure.

117
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,010
You look stressed out.

118
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,843
Maybe that's it.

119
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:41,676
Well, you've been more

120
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,240
than a little distracted lately.

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,430
Huh?
I said--

122
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,290
Listen, I'm really late

123
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,560
for a very important appointment with my kid.

124
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,650
Maybe we can talk about this later, okay?

125
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,483
Okay.

126
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:58,683
Merry Christmas, kids.

127
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:00,667
(bells ringing)

128
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:01,500
Thank you.

129
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:10,463
Why do we have to go to Iowa for Christmas?

130
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:12,710
Why can't we stay here with our friends?

131
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,356
Well grandpa's kind of expecting us.

132
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,980
Why can't he come here?

133
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,753
He used to do that.

134
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,510
Well he's, he's getting kind of old, you know.

135
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,663
Yeah, and scarier every year.

136
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,348
Bob, scary?

137
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:30,253
You must be thinking of somebody else.

138
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:34,582
I remember this place.

139
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,890
I remember mom saw and elf in the window

140
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,360
and she wanted it,

141
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,100
only it was for display only.

142
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,900
And the guy in the store,

143
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,720
he wouldn't sell it to her.

144
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,010
But she badgered him for an hour

145
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,050
until he finally gave in.

146
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,780
And then she got it home and she thought

147
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,280
it was really ugly,

148
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,580
and she hid it in the back of the coat closet.

149
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,283
Right.

150
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,140
I'm sorry, dad.

151
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:06,403
For what?

152
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:09,737
I know it's hard for you to talk about mom.

153
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,900
Since when did you get so smart?

154
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,030
Good upbringing.

155
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,803
You okay?

156
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm okay.

157
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,323
How about you?

158
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,427
I miss her.

159
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:28,907
Yeah.

160
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:32,100
But I don't think she'd like it very much

161
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,700
if she knew we were moping around here

162
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,900
because she wasn't here.

163
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,330
I think going home and making some popcorn

164
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,980
and watching a Christmas movie would be good for you.

165
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,550
Okay, sounds like a good idea.

166
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,650
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.

167
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,360
That's what I think.

168
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,874
Okay, doctor.

169
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,296
And after that, Frosty the Snowman.

170
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:55,380
Oh, you gotta be careful.

171
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,890
Don't mix your medicines.

172
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,723
Side effects.

173
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:02,471
(phone ringing)
Oh!

174
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:06,870
Yeah, it's the hospital.

175
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,653
We'll do it when you get back.

176
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:13,653
Great.
(gentle music)

177
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:18,211
You're gonna be okay, dad.

178
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:19,044
You will.

179
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,193
Dr. Chen, Dr. Chen.

180
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,993
Aneurysm.

181
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,503
What happened to Pearson?

182
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:31,840
I thought she was on call.

183
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,153
Chicago, airplane, snow storm.

184
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:42,013
(sighing)

185
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:47,187
(stretcher rattling)

186
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:58,401
(indistinct chatter)

187
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,743
Mike?

188
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,083
Fred, can you do an aneurysm?

189
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,310
Yeah, sure Hal.

190
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,220
Get in there.

191
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,343
Mike, my office.

192
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm sorry, Hal.

193
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,443
I don't know what's wrong with me.

194
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,800
Ever since Thanksgiving I've felt...

195
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,473
I don't know.

196
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,130
Whenever I walk into the OR

197
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,900
I break out into a sweat,

198
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,133
my heart's starts beating faster.

199
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,940
It's been building up for a long time.

200
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,390
Lately, it's gotten worse.

201
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,420
And today for the first time in my life,

202
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,840
I couldn't do my job.

203
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
What are you afraid of?

204
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,053
Failing, I guess.

205
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,480
Can I ask you a personal question?

206
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,020
If it would help.

207
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,280
Do you think this has anything to do

208
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,403
with your wife passing away?

209
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,990
She's been gone for four years.

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,390
Well, something's going on inside you.

211
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,590
Denying it will only make it worse.

212
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,780
Well how can you deny something

213
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,030
you're not even aware of?

214
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,690
I have an idea.

215
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,380
You're going home for Christmas, right?

216
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,470
Yeah.

217
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,993
Take some extra time.

218
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:25,830
Now, go home and deal with this, Mike.

219
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,250
Let it go.

220
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,390
You know you're safe there

221
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,650
and you have people all around you

222
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,723
who love you and can help you through it.

223
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:36,630
I haven't seen most of those people for over 20 years.

224
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,330
Mike, your patients used to know they were in good hands

225
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,393
the moment you stepped into the room.

226
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,763
That is no longer the case.

227
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,600
You're not fit to practice medicine in this condition.

228
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,330
And if you don't do something about it,

229
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,683
you won't have a career.

230
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,690
I know.

231
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,523
Good.

232
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,823
Now get out of here.

233
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,393
Go on.

234
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,374
(trumpet playing)

235
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:18,457
Oh come on.

236
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:21,018
Get those ropes tighter.

237
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:22,514
You're gonna have to get them tighter.

238
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,107
Get them tight.

239
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:25,440
Tighten them up.

240
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,793
Oh, I gotta get the show on the road.

241
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,927
(crowd cheering)
Very nice, Dave.

242
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:39,760
Very nice.

243
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,550
Could I have your attention please?

244
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,840
All right.

245
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,787
Now when I call your section,

246
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:51,700
I want you to pull on those ropes.

247
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,738
You got that?

248
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:54,150
Yeah!
Okay!

249
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,829
Here we go.

250
00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:00,829
(indistinct shouting)
(cheerful music)

251
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:20,061
(crowd cheering)

252
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,717
Sorry I'm late!

253
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:35,408
Again.

254
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,120
Oh Dr. Sarah, mayor.

255
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,363
Oh honey.

256
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,720
It appears that with word of Mike coming home

257
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,123
everybody's gotten just a little overexcited.

258
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,040
What do you mean overexcited?

259
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,819
Well, maybe enthusiastic would be a better word.

260
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,213
You're making me nervous.

261
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:57,280
Testing, testing, one two three.

262
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,500
You know, we figure he's gonna be coming through here

263
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,887
anytime between now and dinner time,

264
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:03,820
and a few people just don't mind waiting around.

265
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,903
(indistinct chatter)

266
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:13,451
Think we overdid it?

267
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,840
I still don't know why we had to come back here.

268
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,323
We never have before.

269
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:26,994
It's always kind of hard to get away.

270
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:28,283
Well, with my job and all.

271
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,460
Are you sure grandpa wants us?

272
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,743
Of course I am.

273
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,815
Why would you say that?

274
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,900
He just sounded so grumpy on the phone.

275
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Well that's 'cause he can't believe

276
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,800
he's being charged money just to talk.

277
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,230
I wish he didn't smoke.

278
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,373
It smells.

279
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:50,863
Maybe you can get him to quit.

280
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,480
Look, there's Tiny's Luncheonette.

281
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,117
Tiny was 300 pounds.

282
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,575
Possible thyroid problem

283
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:01,283
now that I think about it.

284
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:03,520
Down there is the hospital.

285
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,293
I worked down there helping Dr. Jenkins.

286
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,920
I wonder know how he is doing.

287
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,270
Wait til you see the town square.

288
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,440
Every year some old farmer will give them

289
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,970
a great big pine tree for a Christmas tree.

290
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,080
Everybody in the town comes out to help decorate it.

291
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,640
And somebody got the honor of plugging in the lights

292
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,593
for Christmas Eve.

293
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:26,514
Oh, it's really something.

294
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,847
(chuckling)

295
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,023
What's this?

296
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:36,147
(indistinct chatter)

297
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:38,161
There he is!

298
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,911
(Deck the Halls)

299
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,492
Hello!

300
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:48,625
Come on dear!

301
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,958
You must be Mike's daughter.

302
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:58,016
(crowd applauding)

303
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,410
What's going on?

304
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,910
Well you'll see.

305
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,012
Mike!

306
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:11,711
Mike!

307
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:14,212
Come on, come on.

308
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:24,113
That's it, that's it, stop the band.

309
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:26,333
And of course you know Mayor Sarah.

310
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,813
Sarah?

311
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:30,270
Ladies and gentlemen,

312
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,870
it is my official duty to inform you

313
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,040
that this year

314
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,800
St. Nicholas's favorite son and most illustrious graduate,

315
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,470
other than our own mayor,

316
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,040
Mike Greiser, has been nominated

317
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,700
the Grand Electrician of the town tree

318
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,670
and we'll plug in that tree this Christmas Eve!

319
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,420
(crowd cheering)

320
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:58,473
(Deck the Halls)

321
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,792
Mayor Gladstone will now present you

322
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:05,828
with the golden plug.

323
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:06,849
Mayor?

324
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:07,682
Um hum.

325
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:13,800
And a years supply of Fro Kazinsky's famous

326
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Christmas fruitcake.

327
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,661
(crowd applauding)

328
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,578
(cameras clicking)

329
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:28,228
Smile.

330
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,992
(gentle music)

331
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,363
Hey Mike.

332
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm sorry about all that hoopla.

333
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,123
I guess we, I guess we got a little excited.

334
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,073
I was a little surprised.

335
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,003
Yeah.

336
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:06,793
Well now you can relax a bit.

337
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,930
Anything in particular you want to do while you're here?

338
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,930
Just take it easy.

339
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,498
I was thinking of going and visiting Doc Jenkins.

340
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:16,331
Oh.

341
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:22,560
Doc Jenkins passed away about two months ago.

342
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,570
I didn't tell you, Mike,

343
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,043
because I didn't wanna upset you.

344
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,860
Who's running the hospital?

345
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,760
Oh, that'd be Sarah.

346
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,660
But she's a vet.

347
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,550
Yeah but she's mighty good at stitching people up.

348
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,617
She really is.

349
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:43,250
And even though she's the best veterinarian around

350
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,210
people are a little leery about letting her work on them.

351
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,720
Being as how her idea of what to do for a broken leg is

352
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,023
euthanasia.

353
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,830
Did we forget somebody?

354
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,133
Jilly?

355
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,303
Hey, aren't you freezing?

356
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,003
Come on up here, girl.

357
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:10,040
You're gonna catch pneumonia.

358
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,853
Come on!

359
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:19,270
Now what's the matter with you?

360
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,830
She's going through a shy phase.

361
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,970
We've done everything humanly possible

362
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,270
to get ourselves a doctor.

363
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,237
Nobody wants to come and live here.

364
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:36,443
You think somebody would see the potential.

365
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,390
I don't get it, that's for sure.

366
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,813
Hey you!

367
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:49,430
I get a whole box of Christmas decorations waiting for you.

368
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,020
I didn't want to hang them until you got here.

369
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,531
Come on, I'll show them to you.

370
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:54,364
Come on.

371
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,170
I don't cut myself a personal tree anymore.

372
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,590
That one they put up in the square every year,

373
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,210
I consider that mine.

374
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,510
This year it actually is because I donated it.

375
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,513
Generally, I hang these all over the place.

376
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,920
What's the matter with your dad?

377
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,280
I think something's wrong with him.

378
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,590
You mean because it's Christmas

379
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,940
and your mother's not here?

380
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,597
That's what I thought.

381
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,212
But he says no.

382
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:36,011
It's a mystery.

383
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,040
He always was a little mysterious.

384
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,233
Even when he was a kid.

385
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,475
Really?

386
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:43,308
How?

387
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,010
He was always keeping things to himself.

388
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,860
You never really knew if he was sad

389
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,863
or happy or sick or well.

390
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,003
He's still like that.

391
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,953
Excuse me.

392
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,463
Do you think we could designate this a no smoking area?

393
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,213
Sorry.

394
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,757
It's a really bad habit, you know.

395
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:15,824
But it's the only one I have left.

396
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,080
We have to put all those things up?

397
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,730
Maybe we could just put up a few.

398
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,100
Christmas used to be your favorite holiday.

399
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,090
People change, Bob.

400
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,175
Well let's just do it for Jilly.

401
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:33,008
What do you say?

402
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,003
Sure.

403
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,915
Would you go and get a pair of scissors

404
00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:43,333
in a drawer in the kitchen, please?

405
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:49,823
You know, Mike

406
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,693
Lori was a wonderful woman and I miss her too.

407
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,310
But there comes a point

408
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,390
when a person has to get on with his life

409
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,433
for the sake of everybody else around him.

410
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,380
It was just not that easy.

411
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,753
I didn't say it was easy.

412
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,430
Dad liked the same books I do.

413
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,193
I guess the room hasn't changed for 20 odd years.

414
00:21:24,193 --> 00:21:26,776
(gentle music)

415
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,400
Sorry!

416
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,380
Sorry I'm late.

417
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,090
I have tonight's agenda right here.

418
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,480
Let's cut to the chase.

419
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,170
Bob, how's Mike doing?

420
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,424
Oh, you know Mike,

421
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:56,680
he's kind of hard to read.

422
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,980
No, he's not.

423
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,390
It's plain as day on his face.

424
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,320
He's frightened.

425
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,180
He sure didn't act that scared.

426
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,013
He's a nice man.

427
00:22:03,013 --> 00:22:04,130
He was being polite.

428
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,900
Now, Sarah, your honor,

429
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,660
you know St. Nicholas is paradise if you squint.

430
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,110
All Mike needs is a little encouragement.

431
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,263
I wish you'd all come to your senses.

432
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:20,940
You know, you're going to have to get up the nerve

433
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,870
and ask him one of these days, honey.

434
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,637
I mean, he's our only hope.

435
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:27,030
All right, all right, I will.

436
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,160
But I refuse to tell him that he's our only chance

437
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,790
to keep the hospital open.

438
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,083
I intend to keep some semblance of pride.

439
00:22:34,093 --> 00:22:36,630
You're not still stuck on him, are you?

440
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,105
Oh, Margie, come on!

441
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:39,830
That was a long time ago.

442
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,780
Besides, I'm a professional.

443
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,900
And even if I did still have feelings for him,

444
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,540
I wouldn't let that influence my behavior.

445
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,080
Professionals are allowed to have feelings too, you know.

446
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,530
Feelings interfere with getting things done.

447
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,630
You know that, Margie.

448
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:57,584
(knocking on door)

449
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,020
You're supposed to be asleep.

450
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,693
So are you.

451
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:14,081
(gentle music)

452
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,083
You know, Jilly,

453
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,220
Bob is the only grandpa you have.

454
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:21,835
I know.

455
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,370
Maybe you ought to be a little nicer to him.

456
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,210
We don't exactly have a lot in common.

457
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,109
Well, how do you know?

458
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,703
You gotta try to find something.

459
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:36,600
You know, you'll regret it someday

460
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,470
if you don't get to know him better.

461
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,743
He's a wonderful man.

462
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:44,110
Do you know he paid cash for my medical school,

463
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,750
doing extra farming for other people.

464
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,643
Because he doesn't believe in loans.

465
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,263
He's an amazing guy.

466
00:23:58,273 --> 00:24:00,440
Well, you get some sleep.

467
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:10,609
Now.

468
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:30,530
First you go to Drysdales

469
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,670
and then you go to Nick's for groceries.

470
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,930
Do you remember where they are?

471
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,860
Sure.

472
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,790
Okay.
You don't mind

473
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,130
having Jilly around, huh?

474
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,120
Are you kidding?

475
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,745
Besides, she's going to help me.

476
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:41,660
Now you go ahead.

477
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,634
It's gonna be fine, here.

478
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:46,277
Well, you two have fun then, huh?

479
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,753
Or else.

480
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,523
Hey.

481
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,770
What if we go and see the pigs, huh?

482
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:03,273
Ooh, you don't know what fun is until you've met a pig.

483
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:08,273
(cheerful music)
(kids shouting)

484
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,319
(door bell jingling)
(indistinct chatter)

485
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:25,352
Got your items all bagged up, doc.

486
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:27,600
Well how'd you know what I wanted?

487
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,704
Oh, Bob called.

488
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,843
Said you were coming by, doc.

489
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,290
We're just so glad to have you back.

490
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,260
You used to shovel the snow on our walk every winter

491
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,300
in order to make money for medical school.

492
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,650
Now you remember that?

493
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,580
I sure do, Mr. Drysdale.

494
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,260
Our walk has never been shoveled again by a doctor.

495
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,190
We knew you'd turn to be a great surgeon.

496
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,023
Everybody did.

497
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,840
Well, thanks, Mr. Drysdale,

498
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,763
Mrs. Drysdale.

499
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,860
(door bell jingling)

500
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,693
Wait til you see her.

501
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:03,526
She's beautiful.

502
00:26:06,305 --> 00:26:09,388
(pig softly oinking)

503
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:13,105
Here she is.

504
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,633
Isn't she a beauty?

505
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,010
I just got her a week ago.

506
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,094
Yeah, that is breakfast, honey.

507
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:22,927
Come on.

508
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:25,221
Here, come on.

509
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,949
It is she okay?

510
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:34,542
I don't know.

511
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,541
A pig that doesn't want breakfast isn't right,

512
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,113
that's for sure.

513
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,923
I better call Sarah.

514
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:45,995
And you, stay here with Janet.

515
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,109
Can't I come with you?

516
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:48,257
No, no, no, no.

517
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:51,356
No honey, Janet needs you.

518
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:53,183
Just stay here, okay.

519
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,822
I'll be right back.

520
00:26:56,822 --> 00:26:57,933
Be right back, honey.

521
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,510
I am so sorry about Doc, Mrs. Jenkins.

522
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,190
I really wanted to talk to him while I was here.

523
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,183
I just hope the next doctor we hire is single.

524
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,910
He works hard all his life to make that hospital go.

525
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,480
It's sad to think of so much hard work coming to an end.

526
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,190
Especially with so many attractive, single women

527
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,053
around town.

528
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,050
Well I'm, I'm sure you'll find someone to run the place.

529
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,680
Somebody single.

530
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,513
Gotta be single.

531
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,920
You know Mike, he always followed your career.

532
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,570
It made him so happy

533
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,349
to see you were doing so well for yourself as a doctor.

534
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:43,319
Well thank you, Ms. Jenkins.

535
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,369
Yeah, you know,

536
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:49,600
Mike, I've been getting a twinge of rheumatism lately.

537
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,830
Not, not now, mother.

538
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,633
Well, very nice to see you again, doctor.

539
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,393
Let let go of him, mother.

540
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,613
She won't eat at all, and that that's not like her.

541
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:15,480
I'll get that gate.

542
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,276
I don't think she feels well.

543
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:18,790
You're probably right, Jilly.

544
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,890
Jilly, you remember Sarah Gladstone?

545
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,540
She was at the tree raising

546
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,508
when you got here the other day.

547
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:25,341
Hi.

548
00:28:25,341 --> 00:28:26,673
She's Janet's doctor.

549
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,123
Jilly would you, would you hand me the thermometer there?

550
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:31,543
It's in bag please.

551
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,540
Sarah and your dad were friends in high school.

552
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,930
Did you know that?

553
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,000
No.

554
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,260
He never told me.

555
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,503
He was always a little bit absent minded.

556
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,073
So what do you mean by friend?

557
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,373
Well...

558
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:52,320
Used to call it going steady back then.

559
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,714
Yeah, I believe that was the correct term.

560
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:56,240
You're kidding me!

561
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,720
You and my dad?

562
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,870
Unbelievable, I know.

563
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,340
Wow.

564
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,320
So what was he like back then?

565
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,153
Your father?

566
00:29:07,518 --> 00:29:09,690
Well, he was very popular.

567
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,913
He helped everybody.

568
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,690
He was the star of the debate team.

569
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,160
Championship swimmer.

570
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,260
He used to swim the river upstream just for fun.

571
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,627
My dad?
Um hum.

572
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:25,490
Told terrible, terrible jokes.

573
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,720
They were horrible.

574
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,977
Everybody loved him.

575
00:29:27,977 --> 00:29:30,923
Everybody thought he'd be coming back after college.

576
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,723
Well, Bob, I know what's wrong with your sweet pig here.

577
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,533
I can take it.

578
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,563
She's pregnant.

579
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:47,740
What?

580
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,850
We're gonna have babies?

581
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,683
Absolutely.

582
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:52,700
I never heard of a pig delivering in December.

583
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,533
You have now.

584
00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:03,860
So Mike, what do you think of that daughter of mine?

585
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,660
I'm glad she's been so successful.

586
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,590
Can't never reach her.

587
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,790
Always off someplace doing something,

588
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,900
taking care of everything and everybody but herself.

589
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,760
She's always been like that.

590
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,573
Well, since her mother died.

591
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,223
Sarah was so young, I guess in order to get through things,

592
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:22,273
she had to mother everybody else.

593
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,760
How much do I owe you?

594
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,200
It's on the house, Mike.

595
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,033
You don't have to do that.

596
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:31,863
Hey, I fed you more growing up than your own folks did.

597
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,010
You and Sarah are the best thing

598
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,248
this town ever accomplished, Mike,

599
00:30:36,248 --> 00:30:37,460
I feel proud to know

600
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,163
I played a part in you're becoming a doctor.

601
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:43,163
Thanks Nick.

602
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:47,300
(whimsical music)

603
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,300
(tapping on window)

604
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,460
So he was all dressed in this suit for the prom,

605
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,040
but there was this poor little calf

606
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,660
stuck in the mud by the road.

607
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,280
So he gets out in the rain,

608
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,910
wades through the mud and pulls this calf to safety.

609
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,825
And then the calf turns around and kicks him.

610
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:13,751
(chuckling)

611
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:15,340
Think that's when he decided to become a doctor

612
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,330
because he felt that people were a lot safer

613
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,370
and a lot cleaner, too.

614
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,720
He had to go to the prom was mud all over him.

615
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,225
Everybody was joking with him.

616
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:24,380
What's going on?

617
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,320
Sarah's telling stories about you.

618
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,605
Oh really?

619
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:29,440
Yeah, well I better be going.

620
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,050
I gotta stop by Saul Winkler's

621
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,500
and inoculate his llamas.

622
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,720
Thanks for coming out.

623
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,540
Just watch her closely and call me when it's time.

624
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,373
Okay.

625
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,163
Say I, I got an idea.

626
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,870
Why don't you take Mike off tomorrow

627
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,213
and then show him all of the old sites, huh?

628
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,830
I'm sure that you two have got a lot to talk about.

629
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,480
Yeah, well, I'm sure she's probably pretty busy, too.

630
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,913
Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

631
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah, well I totally understand.

632
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,943
If I didn't have a meeting, I would do it.

633
00:31:59,943 --> 00:32:00,890
I really would.

634
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,090
Yeah, then take the day off.

635
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,740
You've been working too hard as it is.

636
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,820
The town council will back you on it, I promise.

637
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,630
Well...
How about two o'clock, huh?

638
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,830
I'll take care of Jilly.

639
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:18,040
Okay, two o'clock then.

640
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,010
Fine.

641
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,260
He'll be waiting for you.

642
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:27,927
Now is there anything wrong with

643
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:29,943
having a little bit of fun?

644
00:32:29,943 --> 00:32:30,981
Well...

645
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,148
Ah, come on!

646
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,690
Is it my imagination or are you decorating

647
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,350
a lot more than you used to?

648
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,950
Oh, that's all part of the town council's

649
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,258
plan to revitalize St. Nicholas.

650
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,670
We want people to think of Christmas Eve here

651
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,023
like they think of Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

652
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,285
What's so funny?

653
00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:57,118
Nothing.

654
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,160
Oh, that's all right.

655
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,700
I understand.

656
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,690
Went to the big city.

657
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,410
Learned the difference between Chardonnay and Merlot

658
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,520
and you forgot all about small town life.

659
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,863
I didn't forget at all.

660
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,690
I'd do anything to be able to come back here and live.

661
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:13,713
Why don't you?

662
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:17,328
Hey Mike!

663
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,503
Mike, how you doing?

664
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:22,150
Long time, no see.

665
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,160
Ethan, is that you?

666
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,860
Yeah, hey look doc!

667
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,943
Straight as an arrow!

668
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,041
You were my first splint.

669
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,940
Well, you're a great doctor.

670
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,040
Good to see you again.

671
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,200
Good to see you, too.

672
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,160
Look, I know you did this for Bob.

673
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,993
So did I.

674
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,693
So why don't you just call it a day

675
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:43,266
and I'll take you home.

676
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:45,183
Oh, I don't wanna go back home just yet.

677
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:48,139
So quiet there.

678
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:51,389
(upbeat country music)

679
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,640
Oh and Twyla put in a dance floor.

680
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,170
I knew it would go, and I invested.

681
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,450
Well now let me get this straight.

682
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,360
You are a vet.

683
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,030
You're the mayor.

684
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,440
And you own part of a dance hall?

685
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,690
And dad's cafe, we're partners.

686
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,523
That's amazing!

687
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:08,430
Oh, I wasn't exactly--

688
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,320
No, no, no, it's mine.

689
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,153
Thanks.

690
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:13,870
I wasn't exactly stuck in traffic all day long.

691
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,963
So I had time to invent my own life, I guess.

692
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,570
Can I ask you a question?

693
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,403
Sure.

694
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,710
Why didn't you come back after med school?

695
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:28,963
Well, I met Lori.

696
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,290
She never could have survived here.

697
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,123
It's funny.

698
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:34,870
I always thought that you would be the one to come back,

699
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,680
and I would be the one to stay away.

700
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,440
You did, why?

701
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,195
Because you were the town hero.

702
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:42,753
Ha!

703
00:34:42,753 --> 00:34:43,860
Well if I was such a hero,

704
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,642
then why'd you break up with me?

705
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:46,475
What?

706
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,320
You broke up with me.

707
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,153
Never.

708
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:51,320
I never would've done that.

709
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,760
Don't you remember sitting on the rock in the quarry

710
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,160
and it was a hundred degrees and everybody was swimming.

711
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,950
And you said that you thought that it would be best

712
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,850
if we started to date other people in college

713
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,350
because you didn't know what was going to happen.

714
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,920
Well, I seem to recall you thinking

715
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,980
that was a pretty good idea.

716
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,873
Well, I wasn't gonna let you win.

717
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:16,815
(chuckling)

718
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,732
Why haven't you gotten married?

719
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:25,832
Haven't ever fallen in love.

720
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,665
Why not?

721
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:29,683
I don't know really.

722
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,653
Too busy, maybe.

723
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,810
Afraid you'd have to give up doing all those things

724
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,870
you like to do, huh?

725
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,677
Yeah.

726
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:43,820
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am afraid.

727
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,023
Seen too many relationships ruin careers.

728
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,020
I think you haven't found the right guy.

729
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,373
Not too many would put up with my schedule.

730
00:35:54,474 --> 00:35:56,307
The right guy could.

731
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:06,660
Everybody says you haven't gotten over

732
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,810
the death of your wife.

733
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,713
Why am I always the last one to hear about these things?

734
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,973
You don't need to get over it, you know.

735
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:22,370
I don't?

736
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,826
No.

737
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:25,010
No.

738
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,810
It's really impractical to expect that of a human being.

739
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,423
I miss my mother every day.

740
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,483
So you wind up giving everybody else

741
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:37,142
what you missed getting in your own life.

742
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:40,414
(upbeat country music)

743
00:36:40,414 --> 00:36:42,213
I guess so.

744
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,650
Say, did you ever learn how to dance?

745
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,660
Nope.

746
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,946
No?

747
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:50,919
Well then now's the time to learn.

748
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,396
Come on, let's go!

749
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:55,479
(indistinct chatter)

750
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:18,141
(laughing)

751
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,438
(slow music)

752
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:30,438
♪ One more lonesome Christmas ♪

753
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:37,061
♪ The years they've been so long ♪

754
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:42,699
♪ I'm counting the days ♪

755
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:46,626
♪ Til I'm there with you ♪

756
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:51,626
♪ Back where I belong ♪

757
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,766
♪ Back where I belong ♪

758
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,807
So did you ask him?

759
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:10,400
What'd he say?

760
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,430
Actually I didn't ask him.

761
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,628
Why not?

762
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:15,210
Well, we just never got around to the subject.

763
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,300
What's go into you?

764
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,321
This town is in the state of emergency

765
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:20,793
and you're out all night dancing.

766
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,386
How did you know?

767
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,640
Oh, I, I heard it from,

768
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,070
from Sadie Fikel,

769
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,610
and she heard it from Jesse Flossmore

770
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,170
and she heard it from Connie Hawkins.

771
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,133
I don't know where she heard it from.

772
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,063
Call him right now.

773
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:41,093
Ask him out again.

774
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,040
He knows we don't have a doctor.

775
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,873
If he wanted the job

776
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:46,290
all he has to do is ask.

777
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,070
Well, he hasn't seen the hospital for a while.

778
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,950
So give him a tour.

779
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,810
Show him all the new doctor things that we pay for.

780
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,660
Once he sees all those newfangled toys

781
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,850
Doc Jenkins had put in

782
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,970
he'll jump on it.

783
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,740
Just needs a little inspiration.

784
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,343
One more afternoon with you won't make him suspicious.

785
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,914
All right, all right, all right.

786
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:23,081
I'll call him.

787
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:32,212
(phone clicking)

788
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,600
Bob, Bob, this is Sarah.

789
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,433
Uh huh.

790
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,423
Is Mike there?

791
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,040
Well, I'm not gonna be gone long.

792
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,243
Well maybe I will.

793
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:55,076
I don't know.

794
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:56,570
She's gonna show me around town some more.

795
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,913
Some of the improvements,

796
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,690
strictly business.

797
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,523
Sure dad.

798
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:02,356
Yeah, we know.

799
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:07,058
Haven't seen my cologne around here, have you?

800
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:08,290
Smell okay to me.

801
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,123
Why?

802
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:11,912
(car horn honking)

803
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,223
Whoops, there she is.

804
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:15,979
See you later.

805
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:16,812
Yeah.

806
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:21,369
He sure is in a good mood.

807
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:22,202
Sure is.

808
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:32,278
Hi.

809
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:33,111
Hi.

810
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:34,390
So where are we going?

811
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,223
Oh, the new bank.

812
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:36,200
The new skating rink.

813
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,033
The hospital.

814
00:40:58,927 --> 00:40:59,842
Oh Sarah.

815
00:40:59,842 --> 00:41:00,675
Okay, come on!

816
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,927
I've been here plenty of times.

817
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:06,660
No, not since we made the improvements.

818
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,633
It won't take long.

819
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,333
We have a lot of new equipment.

820
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:24,670
(gentle music)

821
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,793
Oh, it's still the same.

822
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,800
It hasn't changed a bit.

823
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,860
You know, all this stuff here,

824
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,593
this was all Doc Jenkins's idea.

825
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,173
He figured if he made the place look cheerier, brighter,

826
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,970
people wouldn't feel so bad about being here.

827
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,173
It'd reduce their stress about being sick or hurt.

828
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,963
Oh boy.

829
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,150
You know, he's the reason that I became a doctor.

830
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,291
All he ever wanted to do in life was just

831
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,467
make people better.

832
00:41:58,794 --> 00:42:00,840
You know, later on in life,

833
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,620
Doc became kind of rebellious.

834
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,597
He was sick of all the problems with HMOs

835
00:42:05,597 --> 00:42:08,010
and he refused to become a part of one.

836
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,733
So he let people pay whenever they could,

837
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,280
taking barter.

838
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,313
Wouldn't believe how many chickens he had when he died.

839
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,660
I'm amazed it's still in operation.

840
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,202
Boy, if this was in the city.

841
00:42:25,202 --> 00:42:26,343
Hello?

842
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,426
Anybody home?

843
00:42:28,706 --> 00:42:29,539
You open?

844
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,280
Hi Ruby, hi Cleat.

845
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,250
What's the matter?

846
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,160
Grady got him in the eye at practice.

847
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,993
Well, we wouldn't have come in

848
00:42:35,993 --> 00:42:37,610
except it looks worse than usual.

849
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,443
I panicked.

850
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:40,380
The eye is so close to the brain.

851
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,213
Okay.

852
00:42:41,213 --> 00:42:42,312
Come on in here.

853
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:43,145
I'll take a look at it.

854
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:45,150
I'd rather the doc take a look at it.

855
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,160
If you don't mind, Sarah.

856
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,710
No, I don't mind.

857
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,543
Mike?

858
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:59,540
How'd you like the dance club, doc?

859
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,120
It was fun.

860
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,730
Did I see you there?

861
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,670
Jerry Hopper told me.

862
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,280
Said he saw you and Sarah there,

863
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,790
and you seemed to be having a good time.

864
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,203
Just like in the old days.

865
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,073
There.

866
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,690
Oh boy.

867
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,950
You're gonna have a very cool scar to show your friends

868
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,363
Really?
Oh yeah.

869
00:43:25,972 --> 00:43:28,300
Do you have any adhesive tape, Sarah?

870
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,133
I'll look.

871
00:43:30,957 --> 00:43:31,973
We're out.

872
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,383
How about a large bandage?

873
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,453
All out.

874
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,233
Duct tape?

875
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,653
Ah.

876
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,103
This will do.

877
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,695
Now, you're gonna have to keep an eye on this all night.

878
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,170
Want you to wake him up every couple hours

879
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,720
and look into his good eye and see if it's dilated.

880
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,223
I'm afraid you're gonna have to

881
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:00,722
sit out a couple of games there, Grady.

882
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:01,627
Oh!

883
00:44:01,627 --> 00:44:04,223
I can't tell you how grateful we are.

884
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,473
Thanks doc.

885
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,520
Come on.

886
00:44:12,747 --> 00:44:14,080
You all right?

887
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,572
Why don't you show them out.

888
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,440
I hope dad makes it back.

889
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,420
Yeah, I do too.

890
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,393
His car is blocking my plow.

891
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:38,954
Grandpa!

892
00:44:38,954 --> 00:44:40,272
Whoa, don't be afraid.

893
00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:42,413
That happens all the time.

894
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:47,720
We just have to turn on this old lamp here.

895
00:44:50,393 --> 00:44:51,433
There we go.

896
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:53,663
That's nice.

897
00:44:54,674 --> 00:44:56,442
Oh and we gotta...

898
00:44:56,442 --> 00:44:58,610
I'm gonna build up that fire, too.

899
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,850
It's gonna be a while.

900
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,585
You know, your dad used to love to sit

901
00:45:05,585 --> 00:45:07,493
in front of the fireplace and read.

902
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,232
He did?

903
00:45:10,232 --> 00:45:11,065
Yeah.

904
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,924
What else do you know about him?

905
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:15,674
Well, he used to...

906
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:20,780
are you sure your don't wanna play

907
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,070
with that computer of yours?

908
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,673
Nah, that's boring.

909
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,887
He didn't like pigs too much.

910
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:30,720
I do.

911
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,022
I love Janet.

912
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,120
I know, I know.

913
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,303
I'm happy about that.

914
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,183
You know,

915
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,977
I used to be scared of you.

916
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:45,594
You were?

917
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,713
I'm sorry.

918
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:52,430
That's all right, that's not your fault.

919
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,387
I, sometimes I am kind of grizzly.

920
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:01,186
Do you like popcorn?

921
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:06,110
Well I've got a little popper

922
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,923
that fits right into the fireplace.

923
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:12,103
Oh, I think it's in the kitchen.

924
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,490
I'll be right back.

925
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:20,710
(gentle music)
(wind whooshing)

926
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:23,260
No road, no phone, no doctors.

927
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,600
Two feet of snow,

928
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,053
but at least we have soup.

929
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,833
Let me see.

930
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,646
Split pea or, or chicken noodle?

931
00:46:36,646 --> 00:46:37,479
Oh, this is fine.

932
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:38,524
Is it?

933
00:46:38,524 --> 00:46:40,920
Oh!

934
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,626
Mmmm, it's good.

935
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:43,650
There you go.

936
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,320
Not only is she a vet and a mayor

937
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,153
and an entrepreneur,

938
00:46:47,153 --> 00:46:49,101
but she can cook too.

939
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,434
(chuckling)

940
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,870
I still don't understand why you don't have a family.

941
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,750
Don't have enough time.

942
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,300
You gotta make the time.

943
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,350
Jilly taught me that.

944
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,100
She has made everything about my life more meaningful.

945
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,793
I have to admit, sure is nice being home.

946
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,200
Must mean that it's still a great place.

947
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,053
It is.

948
00:47:17,888 --> 00:47:19,188
Then why don't you stay?

949
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,860
Don't answer that, I don't wanna know.

950
00:47:25,813 --> 00:47:27,850
You pulled Pete Peterson out of the water,

951
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:28,810
gave him mouth to mouth.

952
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,520
You saved his life!

953
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,420
Well, I remember doing that.

954
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,137
I just can't believe that I did.

955
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:36,723
And the town declared Mike Greiser day.

956
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,460
If I come back here,

957
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,223
it would be a lot different.

958
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,780
What was your wife like?

959
00:47:51,764 --> 00:47:52,597
She was smart,

960
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:54,976
and funny.

961
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:58,983
She was different than anyone else I ever met.

962
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,490
I think you did the right thing.

963
00:48:06,781 --> 00:48:08,066
You do?

964
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:09,831
Absolutely.

965
00:48:09,831 --> 00:48:11,631
Moving away from here gave you experiences

966
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:13,964
you never would've had here.

967
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,433
That's right.

968
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,327
And Jilly is the best reason of all.

969
00:48:25,663 --> 00:48:27,663
Oh, I should have known.

970
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:37,008
You all right?

971
00:48:40,402 --> 00:48:41,319
I just...

972
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:45,247
I've never talked with anybody about this before.

973
00:48:49,474 --> 00:48:50,730
I better get us some light.

974
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,063
Wait a minute.

975
00:48:55,907 --> 00:48:56,740
Thanks.

976
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:19,916
You're a much better kisser than you were 22 years ago.

977
00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:25,769
I'll get you your blanket.

978
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,120
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

979
00:49:34,944 --> 00:49:35,777
See you.

980
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:41,695
Good night.

981
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,723
Good night.

982
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:52,019
(sighing)

983
00:50:15,764 --> 00:50:16,866
Well.

984
00:50:16,866 --> 00:50:19,452
Well.

985
00:50:19,452 --> 00:50:21,570
I wanna thank you for showing me around.

986
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:22,420
You're welcome.

987
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:26,916
So look, there's something that I've been,

988
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:27,749
I've been wanting to ask you,

989
00:50:27,749 --> 00:50:30,060
but I've been so scared of the answer

990
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,430
that I haven't been able to do it,

991
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,393
but now I have to.

992
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,410
See, the whole reason that everybody's been

993
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,790
so nice to you is because first of all,

994
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,143
they really do love you.

995
00:50:41,132 --> 00:50:42,060
But secondly,

996
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,963
because they want you to take over for Doc Jenkins.

997
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:50,120
Sarah--
If we don't find a doctor

998
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,070
we're gonna have to close the hospital.

999
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,259
This town will die, Mike.

1000
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:57,676
(slow music)

1001
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,510
I'd like to help you out.

1002
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:03,943
Really, I would.

1003
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:06,859
But I can't.

1004
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,253
You see I...

1005
00:51:12,423 --> 00:51:13,973
I just got a promotion.

1006
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,690
Oh well, that's good.

1007
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,920
That's true.

1008
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,753
As a matter of fact,

1009
00:51:19,753 --> 00:51:22,030
I just found out about it yesterday morning,

1010
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,230
before you picked me up.

1011
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:26,450
As it turns out

1012
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,883
I won't even be a able to stay for Christmas.

1013
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,340
They need me right away.

1014
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,355
I'll be heading up the otolaryngology unit

1015
00:51:38,355 --> 00:51:39,743
in Minneapolis.

1016
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,120
It's a chance of a lifetime.

1017
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,423
Yeah, of course it is.

1018
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:51,543
I'm sorry.

1019
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,803
Well, it'll be hard to tell everybody else.

1020
00:52:05,307 --> 00:52:07,210
But it was very nice seeing you again

1021
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,493
after all these years.

1022
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,327
We don't have to...

1023
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:13,160
Goodbye.

1024
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:26,866
He's back!

1025
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,224
I called work this morning from the hospital

1026
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:10,547
when the power came back on.

1027
00:53:10,547 --> 00:53:11,707
You know, just to, just to,

1028
00:53:11,707 --> 00:53:13,653
you know, see how things were going.

1029
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,930
I got some wonderful news.

1030
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:17,763
You did?

1031
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,290
What?

1032
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,590
Well, I got a promotion.

1033
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,490
It's a big jump in pay.

1034
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,713
It's very prestigious.

1035
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,310
The only problem is

1036
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,800
they're gonna need me back there right away.

1037
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,553
I guess we'll miss Christmas here, Bob.

1038
00:53:41,495 --> 00:53:43,912
(slow music)

1039
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,630
He got a promotion at the place

1040
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,150
where he were works in Minneapolis.

1041
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,423
He's going back there.

1042
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,210
What?

1043
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,820
I can't believe it.

1044
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,970
What did we do wrong?

1045
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,527
I don't think it's anything we did.

1046
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,433
I'm sorry, Hap.

1047
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:20,580
I tried.

1048
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,700
He's a hard case.

1049
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,793
She did her best.

1050
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,238
We knew you did your best, honey.

1051
00:54:26,238 --> 00:54:27,900
Well, I don't know about the rest of you,

1052
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,770
but I don't feel much like having a meeting tonight.

1053
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,290
Me neither.

1054
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,123
See ya.

1055
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:36,913
See ya.

1056
00:54:36,913 --> 00:54:39,253
Now we'll reconvene when everybody's got over it.

1057
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,503
Come on Hap, I'll buy you a coffee.

1058
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:12,012
(pig softly oinking)

1059
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,303
You sure are easy to get along with.

1060
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,990
Not like some people I know.

1061
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:28,190
We come back here and my dad gets happy

1062
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,553
for the first time in years.

1063
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,360
So what are we doing?

1064
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,923
We're going home early.

1065
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,203
Now he's gonna be all sad again.

1066
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,613
You figure it out.

1067
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:49,552
Morning.

1068
00:55:49,552 --> 00:55:50,385
Morning, Mike.

1069
00:55:51,907 --> 00:55:53,080
Is there coffee?

1070
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,073
Yeah, fresh pot.

1071
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,133
Listen, Bob.

1072
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:02,667
I'm sorry about this, but there's nothing I can do.

1073
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:03,993
The hospital needs me.

1074
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:07,410
I sure hope you know what you're doing.

1075
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:08,243
I do.

1076
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:11,240
Look, I...

1077
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,660
I'm gonna go into town and gas up.

1078
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,297
I'll grab some breakfast there and,

1079
00:56:15,297 --> 00:56:17,680
and I'll pack when I get back.

1080
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,793
I wanna get on the road as soon as possible.

1081
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:21,983
Suit yourself.

1082
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,703
Gosh, Mike.

1083
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:36,620
Edith Drysdale ordered extra socks in your size

1084
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,480
for the store.

1085
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,253
And Nick got in that yuppie ice cream for you.

1086
00:56:41,254 --> 00:56:42,170
Well I'm sorry, Dave.

1087
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,150
I didn't know.

1088
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,590
We'll be all right with the disappointment,

1089
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,710
but it's gonna be hard explaining to all our little kids

1090
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,760
when they're coming down with the flu and strep throat,

1091
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,240
poison ivy and croup.

1092
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,690
Not to mention those new viral diseases.

1093
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,740
And of course there's always the measles.

1094
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,893
Hello?

1095
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,720
Anybody there?

1096
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,633
Hey Mike.

1097
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,149
Hey, cup of coffee and a donut, please, Nick.

1098
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,543
Heard you spent the night with my daughter, Mike.

1099
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,173
Well we got snowed in.

1100
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,913
I understand.

1101
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,728
We slept in separate rooms.

1102
00:57:23,728 --> 00:57:25,150
I understand.

1103
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,927
I in no way compromised your honor.

1104
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:30,633
It's too bad, but you'd made a great team.

1105
00:57:31,853 --> 00:57:33,003
I understand.

1106
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:34,943
Thanks.

1107
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,523
You think we're too nosy?

1108
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,713
That's not it.

1109
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,303
I understand.

1110
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:51,019
(O Come All Ye Faithful)

1111
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,380
Sorry things didn't work out, Mike.

1112
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,680
You two cut quite a rug on Central.

1113
00:58:12,543 --> 00:58:15,660
Well, I didn't see you there that night, Ms. Jenkins.

1114
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,550
Oh, I only go once, twice a week.

1115
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:19,653
Everybody told me.

1116
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,143
Well, good luck son.

1117
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,659
Oh, don't look so sad, Ms. Drysdale.

1118
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:36,580
I'm not the guy you thought I was.

1119
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,480
We're just so proud of you, Mike.

1120
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,605
We just wish you loved us as much as we loved you.

1121
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:42,522
That's all.

1122
00:58:48,142 --> 00:58:50,559
(slow music)

1123
00:58:55,162 --> 00:58:57,745
Boy, you sure are in a hurry.

1124
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,460
Well, it's a great opportunity.

1125
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,683
I'll be head of the nasopharyngeal unit there.

1126
00:59:09,753 --> 00:59:11,710
Well, I can't pass this up, Bob.

1127
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,586
No, I guess not.
Grandpa!

1128
00:59:13,586 --> 00:59:14,419
Grandpa!

1129
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:16,800
Something's wrong with Janet.

1130
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,070
I went to the barn to visit her

1131
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,570
and she's lying on her side and she can't breathe.

1132
00:59:22,407 --> 00:59:23,240
You go and stay with her.

1133
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,607
I'll call Sarah and then I'll be right out.

1134
00:59:39,154 --> 00:59:40,659
Is she gonna be all right?

1135
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:43,253
I don't know, Jilly.

1136
00:59:43,253 --> 00:59:44,753
Daddy, help her!

1137
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,564
Jilly, we gotta pack the car.

1138
00:59:47,564 --> 00:59:48,981
Please!

1139
00:59:50,184 --> 00:59:52,010
Lucky I was just down at your neighbors.

1140
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,520
Janet can't breathe!

1141
00:59:56,646 --> 00:59:57,993
Looks to me like she's in labor,

1142
00:59:57,993 --> 01:00:01,040
but I'm no expert on pigs.

1143
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,090
Pig can get very violent about their babies, Mike.

1144
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:04,497
I'm gonna need your help.

1145
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:09,380
I was really planning on getting on the road.

1146
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,770
Please, daddy, you have to!

1147
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:11,983
Janet needs you!

1148
01:00:24,473 --> 01:00:27,223
Tell me what you want me to do.

1149
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:36,717
(piglets squeaking)

1150
01:00:38,484 --> 01:00:42,143
Why don't the other babies let that one eat?

1151
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:44,123
This little guy right here?

1152
01:00:44,123 --> 01:00:45,790
Oh, oh there you go.

1153
01:00:48,384 --> 01:00:50,512
Because he's the runt.

1154
01:00:50,512 --> 01:00:51,345
It's nature's way.

1155
01:00:51,345 --> 01:00:52,640
But he'll die.

1156
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,473
No, he won't not.

1157
01:00:53,473 --> 01:00:55,221
Not if we take care of him.

1158
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:56,388
Yeah.

1159
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,770
Will he really be all right?

1160
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:05,310
You'll just have to be his mom.

1161
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:06,143
How?

1162
01:01:07,525 --> 01:01:08,960
Well be like your mom.

1163
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,620
She was good at it obviously.

1164
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,620
You turned out well.

1165
01:01:14,998 --> 01:01:16,415
If I'm his mom,

1166
01:01:17,822 --> 01:01:19,489
who's gonna be mine?

1167
01:01:20,554 --> 01:01:23,260
Hmm, that's an interesting question.

1168
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,810
I'm not sure I have the answer.

1169
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,380
Too bad you and my dad didn't get back together.

1170
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:35,470
Well, I'm afraid that wasn't in the cards.

1171
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:37,570
It's not easy finding good moms.

1172
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,513
Honey,

1173
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:44,917
Why don't you do what I did when I lost mine.

1174
01:01:46,441 --> 01:01:47,274
What's that?

1175
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,200
Pretend she's there.

1176
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,657
Talk to her, ask her questions

1177
01:01:53,763 --> 01:01:54,846
in your head.

1178
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,060
She's never really gone you know.

1179
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,233
She's inside of you.

1180
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,863
Then you can have her anytime, any way you want.

1181
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:08,920
I want her to be like my mom,

1182
01:02:11,553 --> 01:02:12,386
and you.

1183
01:02:15,784 --> 01:02:17,367
Thank you, Jilly.

1184
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:22,553
What's Patrick gonna do when I go?

1185
01:02:23,457 --> 01:02:27,560
Can't we just stay for Christmas, please dad, please?

1186
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,033
I'm sorry, but we can't.

1187
01:02:30,505 --> 01:02:33,684
Jilly, sometimes part of being a good mother,

1188
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:34,580
a really good mother,

1189
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,430
is doing the very best for your baby.

1190
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:38,643
What about me?

1191
01:02:55,365 --> 01:02:56,615
Well.

1192
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:59,949
She'll get over it.

1193
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:01,616
I'm sure she will.

1194
01:03:05,493 --> 01:03:06,826
Good luck, Mike.

1195
01:03:09,701 --> 01:03:10,534
I mean it.

1196
01:03:11,943 --> 01:03:12,776
Bye.

1197
01:03:42,122 --> 01:03:43,660
Okay, this is it, huh?

1198
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,560
Hey, wait a minute.

1199
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,483
There's one more.

1200
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,330
What's this, Bob?

1201
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,380
I'm going with you.

1202
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,180
Well, you don't have to do that.

1203
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:54,573
I'm not gonna spend Christmas here all alone.

1204
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:57,260
Well, what about the farm?

1205
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,500
Oh, I already called a neighbor.

1206
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,240
He's gonna cut down and take care of things while I'm gone.

1207
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,380
Ah, Sarah's gonna take care of Patrick.

1208
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,130
We can drop him off on the way out.

1209
01:04:12,444 --> 01:04:14,944
(pig oinking)

1210
01:04:17,843 --> 01:04:18,930
(knocking on door)

1211
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,873
Come on, honey.
Oh sweetheart!

1212
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:25,110
Look at that, look at that.

1213
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,600
I can't believe you won't be here

1214
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,400
for the lighting of the tree.

1215
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,753
Yeah well, Jilly needs me.

1216
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,839
At least you're coming back.

1217
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,480
Yeah.

1218
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,130
Maybe he'll change his mind.

1219
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:37,963
No he won't.

1220
01:04:37,963 --> 01:04:39,660
He's obviously just the wrong person.

1221
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,078
It's fate.

1222
01:04:41,078 --> 01:04:42,886
Yeah right, sure, maybe.

1223
01:04:42,886 --> 01:04:43,990
Though he is making a big mistake.

1224
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,070
He'll be bored with otolaryngology in a month.

1225
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:50,092
That's nasopharyngeal he's going into.

1226
01:04:50,092 --> 01:04:53,223
No, no he told me otolaryngology.

1227
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,190
Well, anyway, it doesn't matter.

1228
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:58,220
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

1229
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,880
You know, doc,

1230
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,360
you've been running your tail off for 20 years

1231
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,350
trying to improve things here.

1232
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,580
Everybody thinks you're the best thing since

1233
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:07,430
pivot irrigation.

1234
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,290
That's very nice of you to say.

1235
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:12,123
Yeah, but

1236
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:16,300
maybe it's time you did something for yourself.

1237
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,403
Get something you need.

1238
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:23,213
I have everything I really want.

1239
01:05:23,213 --> 01:05:27,191
No you don't.
(slow music)

1240
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:29,858
Yeah, well it's not that easy.

1241
01:05:31,247 --> 01:05:34,283
You know how to get a town hall fixed.

1242
01:05:35,242 --> 01:05:37,600
You know how to take care of a little pig,

1243
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,446
but you don't know how to go after something

1244
01:05:39,446 --> 01:05:40,779
you really want.

1245
01:05:45,897 --> 01:05:47,814
Don't be afraid, Sarah.

1246
01:05:49,671 --> 01:05:50,504
Bye Patrick.

1247
01:05:51,638 --> 01:05:53,555
Merry Christmas, honey.

1248
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:59,124
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1249
01:05:59,124 --> 01:05:59,957
Bye.

1250
01:06:04,748 --> 01:06:07,331
(gentle music)

1251
01:06:30,744 --> 01:06:32,480
You know, if everyone carried my things around

1252
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,980
like that door man of yours...

1253
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,053
I'd be decrepit in a week.

1254
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:45,940
Haven't you got some chores for me to do?

1255
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,640
We got maintenance men for that.

1256
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,600
Bob, you're on Christmas holiday.

1257
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,500
Relax.

1258
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,100
Look out the window.

1259
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,330
Enjoy yourself.

1260
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:55,743
I did that already.

1261
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,713
Well try again.

1262
01:06:59,732 --> 01:07:00,565
Okay.

1263
01:07:00,565 --> 01:07:02,898
(chuckling)

1264
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:21,993
Oh am I glad Christmas doesn't last long.

1265
01:07:23,898 --> 01:07:26,315
(slow music)

1266
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:49,930
Excuse me.

1267
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,448
Go ahead.

1268
01:07:51,448 --> 01:07:54,730
I'm, I'm looking for Mike Greiser.

1269
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,420
A doctor Mike Greiser.

1270
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:57,600
He's not here anymore.

1271
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,150
He's not?

1272
01:07:59,150 --> 01:07:59,983
Nope.

1273
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:03,860
Told me he had a promotion.

1274
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,020
Let me guess.

1275
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,950
You're the woman who's been running that hospital

1276
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:11,700
back in Mike's hometown.

1277
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,046
How did you know that?

1278
01:08:13,046 --> 01:08:15,140
Well, Mike mentioned you.

1279
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,090
He works on a different floor now.

1280
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:17,923
I see.

1281
01:08:17,923 --> 01:08:19,400
And what department is that?

1282
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,250
Administration.

1283
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,440
Administration?

1284
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,439
Yes, didn't he tell you?

1285
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:25,670
But he's a doctor.

1286
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,253
He requested a change.

1287
01:08:29,108 --> 01:08:31,750
I wish I knew what was going on with him.

1288
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,400
Well, to be honest with you, I wish the same thing.

1289
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:36,630
About a year ago

1290
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:39,580
he started having anxiety attacks at work

1291
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:42,260
that got progressively worse until about a week ago

1292
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:44,800
when he suddenly couldn't do his job anymore,

1293
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,703
at all.

1294
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:50,350
I thought going home might help him to work things out.

1295
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:52,980
But he came back early and

1296
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,235
asked to be transferred to administration.

1297
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:57,117
He asked?

1298
01:08:57,117 --> 01:08:58,500
But he told me that...

1299
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,673
I see.

1300
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:08,220
Well, if you'd like to see him, I'm sure he is in.

1301
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,053
Yeah, I would.

1302
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,380
How's it going back home?

1303
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,700
You find a doctor yet?

1304
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,710
No, we'll have to close the hospital down for good.

1305
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:18,543
That's too bad.

1306
01:09:18,543 --> 01:09:20,090
It is.

1307
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:21,370
Sue, is Mike around?

1308
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,483
He's up on the roof getting some air.

1309
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:29,920
If you don't mind, I'd like to surprise him.

1310
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,753
Thanks.

1311
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,030
I'm sure you will.

1312
01:09:36,685 --> 01:09:39,602
(traffic whirring)

1313
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:47,630
You didn't tell me you got a promotion in the North Pole.

1314
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,290
I guess when I came home,

1315
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:52,543
I remembered how much I like bad weather.

1316
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,230
What are you doing here?

1317
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:58,530
What are you doing here?

1318
01:10:00,872 --> 01:10:02,633
I guess it's hard for you to understand.

1319
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:04,180
Absolutely.

1320
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:05,470
It is hard for me to understand.

1321
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,490
You're a doctor, Mike.

1322
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:08,964
What are you doing shuffling papers?

1323
01:10:08,964 --> 01:10:10,253
I'm not a doctor.

1324
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:12,740
Not anymore.

1325
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,573
I still don't understand.

1326
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,400
Look Sarah, when I went home

1327
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,050
everybody treated me like a hero.

1328
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,683
I panicked.

1329
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,333
I'm not a hero, Sarah.

1330
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:30,013
I can't even walk into a operating room anymore.

1331
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:32,123
I'm afraid.

1332
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:35,930
I'm not who you thought I was.

1333
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:38,540
I just couldn't stand the thought of

1334
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:41,873
letting any of you down.

1335
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,313
Oh Mike, nobody cares if you're a doctor or not.

1336
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:52,660
They care about the man who listens to them when they talk.

1337
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,563
Doesn't judge them for their faults.

1338
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:59,523
A man who knows how valuable love is and can talk about it.

1339
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,380
It's not what you are or what became

1340
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,053
that makes the whole town want you back again, Mike.

1341
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,773
It's who you've always been.

1342
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:14,739
I can't go back.

1343
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,810
I just haven't got the courage.

1344
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,130
What happened, Mike?

1345
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:25,880
Something must have happened to make you feel this way.

1346
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,223
I don't know.

1347
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:32,743
You know, you are always your own harshest critic.

1348
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:38,253
Whatever happened, maybe it's time you forgave yourself.

1349
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:41,263
I'm sorry.

1350
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,440
No, I'm...

1351
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,673
I'm sorry.

1352
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,850
We got another doctor, you now.

1353
01:12:01,262 --> 01:12:02,348
We did?

1354
01:12:02,348 --> 01:12:03,181
Um hum.

1355
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,033
Congratulations.

1356
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,270
She'll be moving in in a few days now.

1357
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:14,833
Great.

1358
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,473
Where is she from?
From?

1359
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:23,320
Oh, Nome, Alaska.

1360
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,393
She wants culture.

1361
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:31,183
So why did you come all the way down here?

1362
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,423
Because I decided you are right.

1363
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,818
I need to take care of myself

1364
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,193
as well as everybody else.

1365
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,943
I need to get something I want.

1366
01:12:54,795 --> 01:12:56,145
And I thought that was you.

1367
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:04,953
Boy.

1368
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:06,873
I'm sorry.

1369
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,650
I don't know what to say.

1370
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,100
I have nothing to give.

1371
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,543
I feel like such a coward.

1372
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:32,603
Courage is not the absence of fear, Mike.

1373
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:37,323
It's taking action in the face of it.

1374
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,047
Merry Christmas.

1375
01:14:00,623 --> 01:14:03,206
(gentle music)

1376
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,793
Dad?

1377
01:14:31,215 --> 01:14:32,048
Sarah.

1378
01:14:37,243 --> 01:14:40,848
Some things are just not meant to be.

1379
01:14:40,848 --> 01:14:42,913
You did the best you could, Sarah.

1380
01:14:42,913 --> 01:14:45,216
Everybody knows that.

1381
01:14:45,216 --> 01:14:48,863
Daddy, would you mind hugging the mayor?

1382
01:15:00,817 --> 01:15:03,815
The forecast, cloudy and windy today

1383
01:15:03,815 --> 01:15:04,791
and cold this morning.

1384
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:05,960
What are you two gonna do today?

1385
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,730
I'm taking grandpa to the children's museum

1386
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,126
for the Christmas festival.

1387
01:15:09,126 --> 01:15:10,260
Well,

1388
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,093
you're gonna find that

1389
01:15:11,093 --> 01:15:11,926
pretty enlightening, huh?

1390
01:15:11,926 --> 01:15:13,110
And then we're gonna do some skating.

1391
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:14,840
You sure you're up for that?

1392
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,493
Well if I'm not we'll soon find out.

1393
01:15:18,493 --> 01:15:21,490
(chuckling)

1394
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:23,040
Oh I'm late.

1395
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,450
I gotta go.

1396
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,150
Have a nice day.

1397
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,050
See you tonight.

1398
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:35,411
Well, at least he doesn't have to wear a beeper anymore.

1399
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:36,244
Yeah.

1400
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,187
I can't send her home.

1401
01:15:42,187 --> 01:15:43,620
You know, she's not stable yet.

1402
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,550
Anything could go wrong.

1403
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,280
I just want to keep her one more night for observation.

1404
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,113
There's no justification.

1405
01:15:48,113 --> 01:15:48,946
Justification.

1406
01:15:48,946 --> 01:15:50,200
I'm having schpillties over this case.

1407
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,520
That's not justification enough?

1408
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,820
Look, Fred. I understand your line of thought.

1409
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,400
But hospital policy dictates that she has to be sent home.

1410
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,252
Hospital policy is endangering my patient.

1411
01:15:58,252 --> 01:16:00,310
You know, if anything happens and it costs more

1412
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,940
to bring her back than to have her stay here one more night.

1413
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:03,773
No.

1414
01:16:03,773 --> 01:16:05,343
Mike, please.

1415
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,363
I feel very strongly about this.

1416
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,330
There's nothing I can do.

1417
01:16:15,754 --> 01:16:19,120
You know, you used to be such a good doctor.

1418
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,270
How'd you get to be such a good bureaucrat?

1419
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:27,220
I did not become a doctor

1420
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,540
so I could risk people's lives

1421
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,710
by sending them home from the hospital too early.

1422
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,596
I'll get back to you.

1423
01:16:32,596 --> 01:16:33,930
What's the problem?

1424
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:35,480
The problem?

1425
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,770
Medicine is not supposed to be like this.

1426
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:39,700
I'm sick and tired

1427
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,640
of business being more important than making people better.

1428
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,263
Uh huh.

1429
01:16:45,263 --> 01:16:48,250
I can't believe I have to risk lives

1430
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:49,630
to save a company money

1431
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:51,590
that's supposed to save lives.

1432
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:53,900
I've been wondering how long it would take.

1433
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,733
What?

1434
01:16:55,630 --> 01:17:00,270
There are very few doctors as talented as you.

1435
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:01,670
Even in your own hometown

1436
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:04,460
they're closing the hospital because they can't find anyone

1437
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,070
competent enough to run it.

1438
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:08,140
They're not closing the hospital.

1439
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,240
That's what your friend, Sarah, told me.

1440
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:14,091
She told me they just hired somebody.

1441
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:16,508
(slow music)

1442
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:22,923
She took a big risk coming all this way to see you.

1443
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:26,003
That woman has courage.

1444
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:35,773
Daddy!

1445
01:17:37,246 --> 01:17:39,496
Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy!

1446
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:43,630
Grandpa's in the emergency room.

1447
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:44,463
What?

1448
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:52,124
(indistinct chatter)

1449
01:17:55,181 --> 01:17:56,014
Hey Fred.

1450
01:18:07,263 --> 01:18:09,346
So this is what you do.

1451
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:13,863
He's my father.

1452
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,370
Cardiac arrest.

1453
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,815
You see anything interesting?

1454
01:18:20,815 --> 01:18:23,500
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

1455
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,110
He's tachycardic.

1456
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:25,943
Let's go!

1457
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,600
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1458
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,273
Let's go, let's go, clear the hallway.

1459
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:36,250
I want those blood gasses, stat.

1460
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,360
OR seven, I think.

1461
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,141
OR seven, let's go!

1462
01:18:39,141 --> 01:18:40,058
Let's move!

1463
01:18:44,034 --> 01:18:45,284
Okay, let's go!

1464
01:18:46,342 --> 01:18:47,259
Tachycardic

1465
01:18:53,545 --> 01:18:55,739
I knew this would happen, I knew it!

1466
01:18:55,739 --> 01:18:56,587
It's gonna be all right.

1467
01:18:56,587 --> 01:18:58,050
No, he's not!

1468
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:01,184
He's old and he smokes and it's his heart.

1469
01:19:01,184 --> 01:19:02,807
They're gonna do everything they can for him.

1470
01:19:02,807 --> 01:19:04,700
You go, dad!

1471
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:05,533
Jilly.

1472
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:06,950
You can save him.

1473
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,590
Please, daddy, you can save him.

1474
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:10,040
You've got to, please!

1475
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:19,791
You sit in the waiting room, okay?

1476
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:28,148
(slow dramatic music)

1477
01:19:34,206 --> 01:19:37,039
(machine beeping)

1478
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:43,920
Clamp.

1479
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,273
Sponge.

1480
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:00,420
(machine beeping rapidly.)

1481
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,270
His blood pressure's bottoming out.

1482
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,930
His O2 sats are dropping.

1483
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,340
Let's go, let's go!

1484
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,173
More clamps.

1485
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:09,493
Bigger clamp.

1486
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,900
Come on people, we're losing him.

1487
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,320
What's the pressure?

1488
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,245
Pressure?

1489
01:20:14,245 --> 01:20:16,050
More sponges.

1490
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:16,883
Nurse.

1491
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,470
Clamp.
I'm taking over.

1492
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,183
You sure?

1493
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:26,227
I'm sure.

1494
01:20:47,085 --> 01:20:48,830
Is he gonna be okay?

1495
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:50,240
I don't know, Jilly.

1496
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,390
I have to wait and see.

1497
01:20:53,217 --> 01:20:55,233
I'm gonna stay up with him all night.

1498
01:20:56,816 --> 01:20:57,800
Are you okay here?

1499
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,633
Yeah.

1500
01:21:00,144 --> 01:21:01,327
And Jilly.

1501
01:21:01,327 --> 01:21:02,470
Yeah?

1502
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:04,363
Want you to know

1503
01:21:04,363 --> 01:21:06,807
I love you very much.

1504
01:21:06,807 --> 01:21:08,374
I know dad.

1505
01:21:08,374 --> 01:21:10,874
(slow music)

1506
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:46,760
Can you hear me, dad?

1507
01:21:54,816 --> 01:21:57,431
I know we haven't seen each other very much

1508
01:21:57,431 --> 01:21:59,203
in the last 20 odd years.

1509
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:05,358
I just didn't realize how fast time was passing.

1510
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:13,920
I'm not ready for this.

1511
01:22:15,715 --> 01:22:16,715
And neither are you.

1512
01:22:19,503 --> 01:22:20,336
You've got a lot of chores

1513
01:22:20,336 --> 01:22:21,370
waiting for you back home.

1514
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,973
Fence needs mending.

1515
01:22:26,915 --> 01:22:29,063
Barn is a mess.

1516
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,587
And Jilly needs you.

1517
01:22:39,096 --> 01:22:39,929
So do I.

1518
01:22:50,645 --> 01:22:52,228
Don't leave me dad.

1519
01:22:56,796 --> 01:23:00,129
Don't make me feel like a failure again.

1520
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:14,207
(machine beeping)

1521
01:23:43,464 --> 01:23:44,964
Where you going?

1522
01:23:50,696 --> 01:23:53,279
Don't tell me you were worried.

1523
01:23:55,077 --> 01:23:55,910
I wasn't.

1524
01:23:57,898 --> 01:24:00,148
I knew I was in good hands.

1525
01:24:03,726 --> 01:24:05,197
I wish I was as sure as you.

1526
01:24:06,206 --> 01:24:07,456
Are you gonna

1527
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,043
tell me what's going on now?

1528
01:24:18,697 --> 01:24:21,115
I thought I lost it.

1529
01:24:21,115 --> 01:24:22,448
You mean Lori?

1530
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,233
I suppose so.

1531
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:33,140
But it wasn't your fault.

1532
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,340
I was the head of the surgical team.

1533
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:37,443
It was up to me.

1534
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:45,443
I thought we got all of it, but we didn't.

1535
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,123
I failed her.

1536
01:24:52,335 --> 01:24:53,523
And you stewed on it.

1537
01:24:54,367 --> 01:24:56,483
All this time.

1538
01:24:58,230 --> 01:24:59,230
I couldn't let go.

1539
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:03,640
Maybe you thought you

1540
01:25:05,693 --> 01:25:09,153
you could keep all those around you safe.

1541
01:25:12,853 --> 01:25:14,160
And you found out

1542
01:25:16,573 --> 01:25:18,723
it just wasn't possible.

1543
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:21,213
All my life

1544
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:25,173
all I've ever wanted to do was make people better.

1545
01:25:27,393 --> 01:25:28,943
Why couldn't I do that for her?

1546
01:25:32,397 --> 01:25:34,314
It wasn't up to you.

1547
01:25:39,087 --> 01:25:41,337
I'm gonna be all right son.

1548
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:13,238
Hey Jilly.

1549
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,097
Grandpa.

1550
01:26:16,097 --> 01:26:19,029
Yeah, he's gonna be okay.

1551
01:26:19,029 --> 01:26:20,034
Can I see him?

1552
01:26:20,034 --> 01:26:21,367
Yeah, come on.

1553
01:26:36,268 --> 01:26:37,101
Jilly.

1554
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:41,743
Now will you quit smoking?

1555
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:44,517
Oh good, just what I need.

1556
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:46,493
A lecture.

1557
01:26:49,482 --> 01:26:50,760
When you get out of the hospital

1558
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,347
I'll take care of you.

1559
01:26:52,347 --> 01:26:53,840
You will?

1560
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:54,890
I have to practice.

1561
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:57,660
I'm gonna be a doctor when I grow up.

1562
01:26:58,743 --> 01:27:00,160
I bet you will.

1563
01:27:01,585 --> 01:27:03,502

(indistinct chatter)

1579
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,160
Welcome everybody to the 67th annual

1580
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,243
St. Nicholas Christmas Eve celebration.

1581
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,250
Things have been kind of tough

1582
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,263
for St. Nicholas this past year.

1583
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,831
We lost Doc Jenkins.

1584
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:19,831
There's no reason that we shouldn't celebrate this holiday

1585
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:24,340
that exemplifies the people of this town.

1586
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,483
People who are generous and giving.

1587
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:30,000
And because we have not found a doctor

1588
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,123
to replace Doc Jenkins,

1589
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,190
the hospital will have to close.

1590
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:38,080
Still,
(crowd moaning)

1591
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,780
still it's imperative that we continue

1592
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,960
to celebrate this holiday

1593
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:46,400
the way we always have,

1594
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,423
with joy and with faith.

1595
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,053
The things happen as they do because there's a reason.

1596
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,670
And we shouldn't let this setback

1597
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:01,393
make us feel like failures.

1598
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:07,090
And since this year's honoree for grand electrician

1599
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:09,590
was unexpectedly called away,

1600
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:12,120
leaving us with nobody to replace him,

1601
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:12,953
I am--

1602
01:29:12,953 --> 01:29:13,890
Wait a minute!

1603
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:16,392
Excuse me.

1604
01:29:16,392 --> 01:29:17,225
(indistinct chatter)
Excuse us.

1605
01:29:17,225 --> 01:29:18,817
Wait a minute.

1606
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:20,733
Sorry, excuse use.

1607
01:29:21,666 --> 01:29:23,190
Uh, I'm sorry.

1608
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:24,710
I'm sorry we're late.

1609
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,699
My dad had a heart attack in Minneapolis.

1610
01:29:26,699 --> 01:29:27,604
(crowd gasping)

1611
01:29:27,604 --> 01:29:28,437
He's fine.

1612
01:29:28,437 --> 01:29:29,280
He's gonna be just fine.

1613
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,130
He's gonna be up and back home as soon

1614
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:33,971
as they can get him here.

1615
01:29:33,971 --> 01:29:37,750
Oh Mike, you bring him back here.

1616
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,460
We'll let him sty with us

1617
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:42,280
for just as long as it takes for him to recover.

1618
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,713
That's right, we will.

1619
01:29:45,653 --> 01:29:49,150
(indistinct chatter)

1620
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,003
Well I did wanna say um,

1621
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:57,773
you all have always treated me like a hero and

1622
01:29:57,773 --> 01:30:02,000
it's you that are really the heroes.

1623
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,260
I mean you've stayed here.

1624
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:05,990
You've dedicated your whole lives

1625
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:07,950
to helping other people.

1626
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,300
I mean you've made your own lives

1627
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:14,300
but, well you've created the futures of others.

1628
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:16,910
And I think that's great.

1629
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:17,823
I really do.

1630
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:22,293
And I want that example for my own daughter.

1631
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,310
So, if it's still okay with all of you

1632
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:30,769
I'd like to accept the position.

1633
01:30:30,769 --> 01:30:31,602
(crowd gasping)

1634
01:30:31,602 --> 01:30:33,686
As the head of the St. Nicholas hospital.

1635
01:30:33,686 --> 01:30:35,040
(crowd gasping)

1636
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,689
I wanna come home.

1637
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:40,689
(crowd applauding and cheering)

1638
01:30:57,662 --> 01:30:58,495
Here we go children.

1639
01:30:58,495 --> 01:30:59,633
Make that connection.

1640
01:30:59,633 --> 01:31:01,383
Plug it in!

1641
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:04,971
Get ready!

1642
01:31:04,971 --> 01:31:07,973
Watch this now, watch this.

1643
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:09,993
Come on.

1644
01:31:11,494 --> 01:31:16,494
(crowd cheering)
(festive music)

1645
01:31:35,049 --> 01:31:35,882
Sarah.

1646
01:31:37,343 --> 01:31:39,180
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1647
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:40,490
What's wrong?

1648
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:42,740
So all of a sudden you just got rid of all your problems?

1649
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:45,248
No, not all of a sudden.

1650
01:31:45,248 --> 01:31:46,940
It's taken a long time

1651
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:49,763
and the help of a lot of people.

1652
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:52,277
What if it all comes back?

1653
01:31:52,277 --> 01:31:53,423
That'll make them hurt.

1654
01:31:53,423 --> 01:31:54,873
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

1655
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,380
I'm in a place that I love.

1656
01:31:59,935 --> 01:32:01,153
I'm very happy.

1657
01:32:01,153 --> 01:32:02,313
Are you sure?

1658
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:04,573
I'm very sure.

1659
01:32:08,727 --> 01:32:11,747
Why did you tell me you'd found a doctor?

1660
01:32:11,747 --> 01:32:13,139
I didn't want your pity.

1661
01:32:13,139 --> 01:32:14,224
Oh yeah?

1662
01:32:14,224 --> 01:32:15,057
Well...

1663
01:32:16,748 --> 01:32:18,107
I shouldn't have lied to you.

1664
01:32:18,107 --> 01:32:20,106
You deserve more than that.

1665
01:32:20,106 --> 01:32:21,304
Yes I do.

1666
01:32:21,304 --> 01:32:23,911
You deserve somebody that admires you

1667
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:25,850
and has all of his life.

1668
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:27,590
Absolutely correct.

1669
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:29,360
You deserve someone who respects you

1670
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,820
for what you've done with your life.

1671
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:34,766
And wants nothing more than to spend the rest of his life

1672
01:32:34,766 --> 01:32:35,599
with you.

1673
01:32:37,405 --> 01:32:38,238
Yes!

1674
01:32:46,477 --> 01:32:49,763
