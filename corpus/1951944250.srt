1
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:31,521
<i>The word "camera,"</i>
<i>my father once told me...</i>

2
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:34,359
<i>... came from the Latin word</i>
<i>for "room."</i>

3
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:38,598
<i>"Each person lives in camera,"</i>
<i>he said...</i>

4
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>..."in an isolated room,</i>
<i>full of secrets. "

5
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,320
David, something's definitely
happening.

6
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:11,367
Honey, no, that's impossible.
First babies are usually late.

7
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:20,238
Ira. Yeah, it's me.

8
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:22,846
Her contractions
are four minutes apart.

9
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:25,142
Okay. Okay, we'll see you there.

10
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:28,746
He said, go to the clinic.
It's closer than the hospital.

11
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,290
He's gonna call Nurse Gill too.
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

12
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,627
You didn't tell me
it would hurt this much.

13
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:38,319
I swear, I didn't know.

14
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:41,295
- But you're a doctor.
- I'm a bone doctor.

15
00:01:56,782 --> 00:02:00,047
- Wait, wait, wait. Stop the car.
- What, what?

16
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:06,021
Just think, when we get back,
our lives will never be the same.

17
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:19,801
- May I help you?
- I'll take this.

18
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:22,998
Your wife will be very happy.
When is she due?

19
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:26,508
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, this is a maternity robe.

20
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:29,579
I'm not married.

21
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:38,955
What? What are you looking at?

22
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,491
You.

23
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:06,175
- Where's Ira?
- There was an accident.

24
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:10,048
He's fine. His car went into a ditch.
He'll be here as soon as possible.

25
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,549
- Well, this baby won't wait.
- Let's get her inside, then.

26
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:17,891
Let's get you comfortable.
Here you go.

27
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,290
One side. Very good, okay?

28
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,708
There you go. Just try and relax.

29
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,377
I'm just gonna take
a little look inside.

30
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:45,484
Everything looks good.
I put her at 10 centimeters.

31
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,750
I delivered five babies
in medical school.

32
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,393
Each one of them a success.

33
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:51,461
And this one will be too, doctor.

34
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay, Norah, I'm gonna give you
some gas. It'll help with the pain.

35
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:03,706
Here. Breathe in.

36
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,571
- "Phoebe."
- What's that?

37
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:09,141
- If it's a girl. "Paul," if it's a boy.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:11,714
Did I tell you that?
I meant to tell you, I decided.

39
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:15,182
- Those are good names.
- Phoebe and Paul are great names.

40
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,016
Breathe in, breathe in.
You're doing fine.

41
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,591
- God, it's coming fast.
- You're doing fine too, doctor.

42
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:24,954
Just relax.

43
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,257
- We're crowning.
- Okay, Norah, push.

44
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,130
Push.

45
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:41,440
God, he's beautiful.

46
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:50,353
- He's beautiful.
- I wanna hold him. I wanna see him.

47
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:54,322
We'll clean him up first,
and then he's all yours.

48
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,823
Doctor?

49
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,333
David? David, is he all right?
Is he all right?

50
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:15,412
- Is everything all right?
- He's perfect.

51
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,878
- He's perfect.
- Absolutely.

52
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,881
Absolutely perfect.

53
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:26,315
- What is that?
- Yeah, it's okay.

54
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:30,052
- It's okay. It's just the placenta.
- David.

55
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:34,325
- David.
- Oh, God. Nurse.

56
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,862
- Everything's fine.
- What's happening?

57
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,935
- Nurse, I need you here right now.
- David.

58
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:41,004
There's another baby.
Give her more gas.

59
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:45,173
Okay, Norah, breathe deep.
That's it.

60
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,172
That's good, that's good, it's coming.
I can see the head.

61
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,214
- It's coming fast.
- Okay, Norah, push. Push.

62
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,912
I'll be right back.

63
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:02,257
It's a girl.

64
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:06,120
It's a girl. It's a girl.

65
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:47,899
Hey.

66
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,180
I'm sorry, doctor.

67
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:12,791
All right. Clean her up, please.
But keep her in the other room.

68
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,430
I don't want my wife to know yet.

69
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:26,977
- David.
- Sleep now, sweetheart.

70
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:30,609
You were incredible.

71
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:38,786
You're a beauty.

72
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:06,807
There's a home outside Louisville.
I want you to take her there.

73
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:11,053
She's a mongoloid.
She won't live long.

74
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,217
- Caroline.
- But, why?

75
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:22,595
My sister died when she was 12.
It destroyed my mother's life.

76
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,566
I can't do that to Norah.

77
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:03,040
Here. It's just off the highway,
about 60 miles.

78
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,809
I'll call ahead.

79
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,576
I can't thank you enough.

80
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:38,034
<i>Unfortunately, the blizzard will be</i>
<i>continuing throughout the night.</i>

81
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,268
<i>Please stay off the</i> h...

82
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,620
<i>Dr. Henry?</i>

83
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:01,798
Dr. Henry?

84
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:09,472
Everyone's gone home.
I think you should be going home too.

85
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,012
Hello?

86
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:23,273
Stop it. Stop it.

87
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,679
Well, don't just stand there.
Give me a hand.

88
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,581
Billy, stop it. Stop it.

89
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:32,848
Hold him down.
Now, get me the strap.

90
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:37,787
Oh, stop it. Calm down, Billy.
Hold this down.

91
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:41,090
- Are you the new nurse?
- No, I'm here to...

92
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,257
- Did Dr. Henry call?
- Who?

93
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,926
A doctor was supposed to call ahead.
He sent me...

94
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:48,402
We're short-staffed tonight.
Hold his legs down.

95
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:50,473
If anybody called,
I didn't hear about it.

96
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:54,339
Billy, if you don't settle down, you're
gonna be in these all day tomorrow.

97
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:56,980
Do you understand me?
What was that name again?

98
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:01,747
- Dr. Henry.
- Okay, wait here. Let me ask Janet.

99
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,951
You better hurry up.
We're closed in 10 minutes.

100
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,063
Come on.

101
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,507
Here we go. Come on, little girl.
That's it. Good girl.

102
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,036
Good, good girl.

103
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:22,060
Oh, God. Oh, God.

104
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:26,536
Oh, God.

105
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:32,570
Wait, come back.

106
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:35,906
I have a baby here!

107
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,625
I have a baby here.

108
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,098
- Hi.
- Hey.

109
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,873
- Hi.
- You were so brave.

110
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,712
Look at him.

111
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:20,590
Our beautiful boy, our perf...

112
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,256
Perfect Paul.

113
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:35,238
What? What is it?

114
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,436
We had twins, honey.

115
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:44,944
One of each.

116
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,812
Twins?

117
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:53,616
Where is she?

118
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:00,257
You know I love you, right?

119
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:02,556
Right?

120
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:06,129
Oh, God.

121
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,969
I am so sorry.

122
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:22,077
She died as she was born.

123
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,973
Did you forget something?

124
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,848
I was trying to get to the phone.
I'm out of gas.

125
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,720
Out of gas?

126
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:03,052
Listen, lady, at this time,
in this weather, you're also out of luck.

127
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,188
Oh, man.

128
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:13,837
- How old?
- Newborn.

129
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:17,335
Listen, you gotta
come join me in my rig.

130
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:24,242
I delivered a load of milk.
I'm just waiting out the storm.

131
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,582
Lady, I'm considering that baby.

132
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,551
Name's Al.

133
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:05,616
Al Simpson.

134
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,751
Caroline Gill.

135
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:13,120
Oh, I bet you have a story.

136
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:18,567
Where were you two headed?

137
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:21,698
- Lexington.
- Lexington?

138
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,740
Well, if it's only Lexington,
I can give you a lift.

139
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:30,074
I might as well park the rig there
as here.

140
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:33,717
- If it doesn't put you out.
- Oh, hell, no. It's...

141
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,051
Oh, pardon my French.

142
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:41,549
I mean, Lexington is on my way.

143
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:45,653
Thank you.

144
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:22,759
He is perfect, isn't he?

145
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:33,143
I wanna see her.

146
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:40,247
- Oh, no.
- Just for a moment, David. Please.

147
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,314
They took her away.

148
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,157
No.

149
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:30,991
Morning.

150
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:34,495
Oh, hi. I hope you...

151
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:38,335
I hope you don't mind.
I made myself at home.

152
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:42,676
No, it smells good. I'm hungry.

153
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:47,147
That's great because,
you know, I made lots.

154
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:52,379
- Thanks.
- I talked to a friend of mine.

155
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:57,051
And he's gonna fill your car with gas
and then drop it off this afternoon.

156
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:59,321
Why, that's incredibly kind.

157
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:01,260
Yeah.
It's my infinite pleasure, ma'am.

158
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:03,400
- Thank you.
- There you go.

159
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:07,263
Well, listen,
I've been meaning to say...

160
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:11,431
...that I'm sorry for whatever happened
with your little girl's...

161
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:14,772
- Well, you know, her father.
- Thank you.

162
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:17,938
I know for a fact
how bad men can behave.

163
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:20,481
I used to behave
a little bad myself sometimes.

164
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:24,050
I doubt that.

165
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:31,453
Anyway, I gotta...
I'm heading back to Pittsburgh.

166
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:35,429
It's my home between runs, so...
You know Pittsburgh?

167
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,534
- No.
- Oh, it's a great town.

168
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,863
It's great. You'll...

169
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:42,662
You should come visit sometime.

170
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:51,579
Anyway, if you do... Let me...
Let me give you my phone number.

171
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,481
You know, just in case you visit...

172
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:58,281
...or, you know,
you just wanna talk sometime.

173
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,483
I'm a pretty good listener.

174
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,291
I know that.

175
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:13,266
Thank you.

176
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:36,690
- Lexington East Clinic.
- <i>Hi, Ruby, it's Caroline.</i>

177
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:41,295
I won't be coming in this afternoon.
I'm coming down with something.

178
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:44,992
Don't worry. I'll call in Emma.
Hey, did you hear?

179
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:48,900
Dr. Henry's wife gave birth
to a baby boy last night.

180
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,139
And a little girl who died.

181
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:55,544
- She died?
- <i>Yes.</i>

182
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:57,010
Yes, isn't that awful?

183
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,231
- Hi, Kay.
- David, honey, I'm so sorry.

184
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,429
We all just rushed over
as soon as we heard.

185
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:20,527
Thank you.

186
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:24,505
I just want you to know
that we'll all be there on Tuesday.

187
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:27,974
- What do you mean, "Tuesday"?
- We...

188
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:31,945
We all talked her into it.
We think it's the best thing.

189
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:35,249
- A memorial?
- Something small.

190
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,047
Something simple.
It'll help us put her to rest.

191
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:41,214
Norah, I don't think we need
a public ceremony to do that.

192
00:22:41,392 --> 00:22:44,589
- She died, there's no shame in that.
- No, of course not.

193
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:46,923
We need to mark
her presence here on earth.

194
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:50,033
Whose idea is this?
Your little sewing circle?

195
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:53,192
Everyone agrees
it's the right thing to do.

196
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,999
Kay called the papers and the church.
It's been arranged.

197
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:58,403
Why didn't Kay call me?
Why didn't you ask me?

198
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:00,771
This isn't wrong.
You think this is wrong?

199
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:03,573
- No, Norah...
- You touched her.

200
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,239
You held her. At least you held her.

201
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:14,152
- Oh, God.
- Caroline.

202
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:15,917
You told her she died?

203
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:18,619
Well, I tried to tell her the truth,
but...

204
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:22,061
I know what it's like to grow up
in a house with a terminally-ill child.

205
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:25,430
Any joy my mother had in life,
disappeared when my sister was born.

206
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:29,130
Phoebe only has half a brain.
She'll wind up in a home eventually.

207
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:31,740
No one raises mongoloids
on their own.

208
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,605
And why do I need
to tell Norah any of this...

209
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:36,644
...if it's just gonna break her heart?

210
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:38,509
You mean it's not broken now?

211
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:44,912
She didn't see the baby.
Someday she'll recover. God willing.

212
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:48,581
And she never will, knowing
that her daughter's dying in an insti...

213
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:56,259
I couldn't leave her in that place.

214
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,834
Well, why not?
Why in the world not?

215
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,300
Have you been there?

216
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:03,097
Oh, God.

217
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:15,376
Look, do whatever you have to do.
Find a better place for her if you can.

218
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,218
I have the birth certificate.
It's not filled out.

219
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:23,619
- Take this.
- I don't want your money.

220
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:25,056
It's not for you.

221
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:28,096
Just please, don't tell Norah.
Please don't.

222
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:29,698
Don't you wanna see her?

223
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:33,331
The first goodbye was hard enough.

224
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:39,905
<i>Though little Phoebe's body</i>
<i>rests elsewhere...</i>

225
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:42,875
...we erect a stone here,
in her memory.

226
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:46,215
The night is as clear as day.

227
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:50,850
The darkness and the light
are to thee both alike.

228
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:55,749
Thou has set our misdeeds
before thee...

229
00:24:55,926 --> 00:25:00,989
...and our secret sins
in the light of thy countenance.

230
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,436
For the things that are seen
are transient.

231
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:10,370
But the things that are unseen
are eternal.

232
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:13,207
We have committed her body
to the elements.

233
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:14,901
Earth to earth...

234
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:18,281
...ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

235
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:21,043
The Lord keep her and bless her.

236
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:24,381
The Lord make his face
to shine upon her...

237
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:28,121
...and give her peace.

238
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:37,199
Amen.

239
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:39,233
Amen.

240
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:59,583
- Excuse me. Is this Caroline Gill's?
- 3B? Yeah.

241
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:02,351
She called, donated the stuff,
left town this morning.

242
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,289
- To go where?
- Didn't say.

243
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:06,622
Just said, she was starting life over.

244
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:13,364
<i>Thank you.</i>

245
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:17,739
David. Thank you.

246
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:20,171
For today.

247
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:28,449
For the new father.

248
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:33,113
I bought it a couple of months ago,
but I forgot about it... Everything.

249
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:46,161
It's beautiful.

250
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,630
Thanks.

251
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,001
Aren't you gonna take our picture?

252
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:57,539
The salesman said
it was ready to go.

253
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,228
Are you seeing someone?

254
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:02,064
What?

255
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,773
You're never home.

256
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:09,269
And then when you are home,
you're up in that damn darkroom.

257
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:13,906
Come on, Norah. It's the free clinic.
My patients need me.

258
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:15,745
I need you.

259
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:19,552
I miss you.

260
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:26,559
You never touch me.

261
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:55,956
I want another child.

262
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,464
David.

263
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,337
It's been six years.

264
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:13,868
I know.

265
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,477
I'm just not ready yet.

266
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:33,594
- Every child deserves an education.
- Order.

267
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:36,198
Every child deserves an education.

268
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:40,700
- Mrs. Gill.
- My daughter is 6 years old.

269
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:44,102
And, yes, it takes her more time,
it's true, to learn new things.

270
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:47,038
But she can do anything
that every child her age can do.

271
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:50,578
She can dress herself.
She can recite the alphabet.

272
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:52,874
She can count to 50 and...

273
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,847
And yet, according to you...

274
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:57,111
...she's not allowed
to attend public school.

275
00:30:57,287 --> 00:30:58,914
- Mrs. Gill...
- And she's not alone.

276
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:03,583
- Every parent here has a child like her.
- Your passion is admirable, Mrs. Gill.

277
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,058
But the bottom line is,
these are mongoloid...

278
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,393
- We don't call them mongoloids!
- They're not mongoloids.

279
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:11,124
If we accede to your demands...

280
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:14,099
...overnight we'd have
a flood of retarded individuals.

281
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:16,205
It's now called, Down syndrome.

282
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:19,308
These children are not stupid.
They can do everything that...

283
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:22,536
But are they capable
of mastering academic skills?

284
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:25,546
Why not teach them
a productive and useful trade?

285
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:30,281
Phoebe is 6 years old.
She doesn't need a trade.

286
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:32,445
Order, please. Sit down, sit down.

287
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:36,753
One at a time, please. One at a time.

288
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,625
In you get, sweetie.

289
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:15,697
There you go.
So who put on your nightgown?

290
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,026
Daddy.

291
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:20,226
Daddy. Okay.

292
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:23,635
So, what do you
wanna hear tonight?

293
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,400
Funny Bunny.

294
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:31,111
Are you sure? All right.

295
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:33,943
But if I forget something,
you're gonna have to help me.

296
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:35,846
Okay.

297
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:42,083
Once there was a little bunny
who was perfect in every way...

298
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:45,285
...except she wasn't like
every other bunny.

299
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,957
And when she went for a walk...

300
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:52,124
...the other bunnies
would sometimes call her?

301
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:55,294
- Funny Bunny.
- Yeah.

302
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:57,463
And how did that make her feel?

303
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,269
- Sad.
- Sad.

304
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:05,074
- So, what did she do?
- She went home to Mommy Bunny.

305
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:06,909
She went home to Mommy Bunny.

306
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:11,478
And Mommy Bunny
took her in her paws and said:

307
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:14,590
"Everything is different.

308
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:18,694
No two flowers are the same,
no two butterflies...

309
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:21,296
...and no two bunnies.

310
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:24,357
And that is why I love you."

311
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:28,237
You're not my Funny Bunny.

312
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:31,670
- You're my Honey Bunny.
- Honey Bunny.

313
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:39,240
You ready to go to sleep?
Okay. Let's take your glasses off.

314
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:42,213
Good girl. Okay.

315
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:45,913
- How was tonight?
- Oh, don't ask.

316
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,951
How was Atlanta?

317
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,930
Why don't you want him
to know where we live?

318
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:03,900
Because I'm afraid
he'll take her back.

319
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:06,437
Over my dead body.

320
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:12,371
Come here.

321
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:14,615
Come on.

322
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:16,916
Come here.

323
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:19,988
Let me show you some dance moves
I was working on with Phoebe.

324
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:24,026
- Only a little closer.
- Oh, yeah?

325
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:41,739
I've never done
anything like this before.

326
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:45,848
I'll have a lot more time on my hands
once Paul starts the 1 st grade.

327
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:49,408
Well, my husband's
never at home, so...

328
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:53,555
Well, he's a very busy doctor.

329
00:34:53,723 --> 00:34:59,127
Well, I only need someone part-time.
But you're certainly pretty enough.

330
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:02,794
I'm talking to another girl tomorrow.

331
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:05,764
I'll let you know after the holiday.
How's that?

332
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:09,702
Well, I promise you won't regret it.

333
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:51,404
Hi, Mom.

334
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:54,307
Hi, baby.

335
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:56,843
Isn't she the cutest?

336
00:35:57,654 --> 00:36:00,885
I keep telling her, I say, "Elizabeth,
hon, you are the cutest thing."

337
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:03,355
I hope it doesn't go to her head.

338
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:07,325
Like a little tomato juice
with your vodka?

339
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:12,096
It's a party. You need to be
a little more adventurous.

340
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:14,533
- Like this.
- Kay.

341
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:17,798
If I had legs like yours,
I would be living in miniskirts.

342
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:19,703
Especially if I was married to David.

343
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:22,271
He's so hot, I'm surprised
you're not bowlegged.

344
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,310
Kay.

345
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:32,415
Let me see you goof around.
Sort of like you're about to fall off.

346
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:36,722
Hey, Mom, look at me. Look at me.

347
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:38,121
Paul.

348
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,156
You get down from there.
Get down right now.

349
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:42,525
He's a kid. He'll be fine.

350
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:45,259
Don't encourage him, David.
Stop taking pictures.

351
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:47,226
- We're throwing a party.
- Come on.

352
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:50,703
- You can't just hide behind a camera.
- Nobody minds.

353
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,705
I do. It's rude.

354
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:55,304
I organized everything,
I made all the food.

355
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:56,968
- The least you could do...
- Help.

356
00:36:57,414 --> 00:36:58,438
Help.

357
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:02,346
Paul, stop. Stop it.
Get down this instant.

358
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,645
Ease up, Norah.

359
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,789
And put away the damn camera.
I'm sorry I ever gave it to you.

360
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:09,391
Maybe lighten up a little
on the liquor, shall we?

361
00:37:13,363 --> 00:37:15,331
I can't stay up here.

362
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,236
Stop.

363
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:24,570
Oh, it's all right. You'll be fine.

364
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:29,435
Are you all right?

365
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:32,838
You look a little bruised.

366
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:37,119
She's just on one of her things.
I never know what sets her off.

367
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:41,247
Kay. I told you I can't.

368
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:43,153
Paul.

369
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:45,918
Paul.

370
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:47,996
Paul? Paul.

371
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,359
- It really hurts.
- Show me where.

372
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:54,196
- Is it broken?
- It could be.

373
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,936
You said nothing would happen
and he broke his arm.

374
00:37:57,107 --> 00:37:58,631
- Yeah.
- It could've been his neck.

375
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:00,571
- Well, it wasn't, was it?
- Or his back.

376
00:38:00,744 --> 00:38:03,372
Just stop it, Norah, please.
Just stop it.

377
00:38:20,263 --> 00:38:23,164
<i>Just stop it, Norah, please.</i>
<i>Just stop it.</i>

378
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,234
<i>Stop it. Stop it.</i>

379
00:38:44,988 --> 00:38:46,148
You're so good to me.

380
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:49,356
How do I rate this?

381
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:55,227
You're a wonderful husband
and I'm a terrible nagging wife.

382
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:57,291
No.

383
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:06,970
Hey, where were you? There was a
phone call. Something about a job?

384
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,543
Did I get it? I got it?

385
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:12,876
Did I? I got it? Oh, is it okay?

386
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:15,244
I'll be a better mother,
a perfect wife. Please.

387
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:18,649
Well, sure.
Whatever you want, yeah.

388
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:26,757
What's in there? Is that where
you keep your dirty pictures?

389
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,162
That's just insurance papers.
Hey, I'm almost done in here.

390
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:34,360
Why don't you get ready for bed
and I'll be right over?

391
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:36,300
Okay.

392
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:45,981
Don't be long.

393
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:33,787
Like that.

394
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:36,454
- Hold still.
- It's hot.

395
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:38,601
That's it. Wait.

396
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:40,292
Here.

397
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,937
That's good. There.

398
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:43,836
Yeah.

399
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,364
Yeah, like that.

400
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:48,404
That's it.

401
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:58,118
Yeah, like that. Wait.

402
00:40:58,621 --> 00:41:00,350
- That's it.
- I don't get it.

403
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:04,653
Why take a picture of me at all if you
want me to disappear into the dunes?

404
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,492
It's about perception, honey.

405
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:11,666
About hiding things in plain sight.
We're almost done.

406
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:19,673
- That's a nice camera.
- Thanks.

407
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:23,573
You mind if I?

408
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:25,043
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

409
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:27,183
- You a photographer?
- Little bit.

410
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,147
- Oh, that's a cool shot.
- Yeah.

411
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:31,720
Yeah, I use it a little bit in my work.

412
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:34,179
- What work is that?
- I'm an artist.

413
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:36,825
- So you take pictures and then draw?
- No, not exactly.

414
00:41:36,993 --> 00:41:38,722
I use a camera obscura.

415
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:41,363
- I didn't think they still made those.
- They don't.

416
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:43,499
I made it myself. It's beautiful.

417
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,395
- That's impressive.
- Thank you.

418
00:41:46,135 --> 00:41:47,659
- My name's David, by the way.
- Hi.

419
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:50,169
- I'm Howard.
- Nice to meet you.

420
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,776
How long are you folks down here?
Because I'd love to show it to you.

421
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:58,380
We've got another week. Norah here,
is the queen of travel agents.

422
00:41:58,548 --> 00:42:01,517
We're here because of all of her
hard work. How about yourself?

423
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:04,219
I'm gonna be here all summer.

424
00:42:04,387 --> 00:42:06,878
I'm kind of in the middle
of a messy divorce.

425
00:42:07,056 --> 00:42:09,149
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

426
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:12,089
Well, maybe you'll come with us
to dinner?

427
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:14,355
- Does that sound okay, hon?
- Sure.

428
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:17,364
Yeah. Come to dinner.

429
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:19,398
Thank you.

430
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:26,934
I've never seen anything like it.

431
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,975
It started when Paul broke his arm.
First it was the x-rays.

432
00:42:31,147 --> 00:42:34,412
And then I went into the operating
theater with a telephoto lens.

433
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,748
What do you think that is?

434
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,912
- It's not a tree?
- Well, actually, it's the human heart.

435
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,997
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

436
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,583
That was amazing, Paul.
You are amazing.

437
00:43:10,753 --> 00:43:11,981
Thanks.

438
00:43:12,755 --> 00:43:15,349
Got a lot of amazing talent
in this house, David.

439
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:17,419
Thank you.

440
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:20,456
I can't wait to see what you do.

441
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:29,304
It's a mahogany box that seals out
all light except for a tiny pinpoint...

442
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:32,703
...which focuses whatever image
you're aimed at, onto a screen inside.

443
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,775
- Right.
- A lot of famous painters used it.

444
00:43:34,944 --> 00:43:38,345
- Vermeer. Da Vinci, perhaps.
- Boy, I'd love to see that.

445
00:43:38,514 --> 00:43:40,641
Paul and I are going
deep-sea fishing tomorrow.

446
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:44,446
- But maybe the next day.
- Sure, anytime.

447
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:47,283
Though, I am in
all tomorrow morning, Norah.

448
00:43:47,457 --> 00:43:50,392
Perhaps you'd like
to come and see it.

449
00:43:51,327 --> 00:43:54,626
- Perhaps I could even draw you.
- We'll see.

450
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:07,465
Paul. Paul, wake up.

451
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:12,643
Paul. It's time to go.
Don't wake your mom.

452
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:41,598
Well, you heard what he said, right?
He said I was amazing.

453
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:44,331
Which you are. I just don't think
you should shut doors.

454
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,135
Juilliard is opening doors,
not closing them.

455
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,973
- It's a dream. It's not reality.
- You don't think I'm good enough?

456
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:53,775
I don't think you can make
a solid living as a musician.

457
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,817
What if I'm the next Segovia?
What if I have it in me...?

458
00:45:56,986 --> 00:45:59,113
What if you find the cure
for an awful disease?

459
00:45:59,288 --> 00:46:02,780
- That is your dream, not mine.
- That may be. But it's not something...

460
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:06,019
You think music is less important
than science? What do you know?

461
00:46:06,195 --> 00:46:09,323
You know what, screw you.
You don't know a damn thing.

462
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,926
- Paul.
- Come on, move your damn car!

463
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:14,096
- Move it!
- Paul!

464
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:17,166
- Come on.
- Okay.

465
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,274
Move it!

466
00:46:39,562 --> 00:46:41,120
Go.

467
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,711
- Phoebe, sweetie, what is it?
- Time for breakfast, Mom.

468
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:07,014
Okay, we'll be right down.

469
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:09,991
Why are you two so lazy today?

470
00:47:12,228 --> 00:47:15,061
- Well, should we tell her?
- Tell me what?

471
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:18,564
It's a surprise.
We'll tell you over breakfast.

472
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,523
Surprise.

473
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:54,636
Oh, honey, that's so nice.
Thank you, sweetie.

474
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:58,306
Oh, sweetie.

475
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:01,503
And you made me a card. Look.

476
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:11,050
I did. I said, yes. Come here.

477
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:15,048
- Yes, sweetheart.
- Oh, thank you so much.

478
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:17,954
- Well, will you be our flower girl?
- Yeah.

479
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:28,095
Oh, man. This place is so cool.

480
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,705
He comes here when
he doesn't wanna be with us...

481
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:33,933
...which is pretty much all the time.
- He took all these pictures?

482
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:37,273
Most of them, yeah.
He's such an ass.

483
00:48:37,446 --> 00:48:40,643
He wants my music
to become a hobby like this.

484
00:48:40,816 --> 00:48:43,979
- He wants me to become a doctor.
- Dude, that sucks.

485
00:48:45,488 --> 00:48:46,921
Is that your mom?

486
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,119
- Yeah.
- Nice.

487
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:53,457
- What does she say?
- She's got her own problems.

488
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:55,620
I don't even know
why they're still married.

489
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:58,858
- Their marriage sucks.
- Join the club.

490
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:01,126
Did you do that?

491
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:05,597
- Yeah, when I was a kid.
- Who's "Feebee"?

492
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:08,136
She's my twin sister.

493
00:49:09,512 --> 00:49:14,711
- She died when we were born.
- Cool.

494
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:27,058
Hey, hey, hey. Lighten up. What are
you doing? Your dad will kill you.

495
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:29,629
I don't care. Do you think I care?
Screw him.

496
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:15,601
Hi, Mom.

497
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:25,787
- He wants to meet her.
- What?

498
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:29,418
The latest letter you brought me...

499
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:35,428
...he says, what he did was a mistake
and he wants to know where we live.

500
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,461
What do you think?

501
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,434
He wants to take her from us, Al.

502
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:47,171
I doubt that.

503
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:50,335
I can't risk it.

504
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:55,709
Well, he'll have to get past me first.

505
00:51:03,692 --> 00:51:07,025
Come on, let's go to bed.

506
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:14,830
Okay, buddy. Here we go.

507
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:18,906
You are not getting any lighter.

508
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:34,087
Dad?

509
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:40,594
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

510
00:51:41,063 --> 00:51:42,997
I just kind of lost it.

511
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,200
I can make it up.
Just tell me what you want.

512
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:56,468
Hold this.

513
00:52:11,927 --> 00:52:13,656
That's you and your sister, huh?

514
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:16,489
June.

515
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:18,890
How did she die again?

516
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,297
She was born
with a hole in her heart.

517
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:27,773
It was just a matter of time.

518
00:53:00,442 --> 00:53:03,878
<i>Oh, hello, yes. I'd like to speak</i>
<i>to the congressman, please.</i>

519
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:09,040
<i>My name's Caroline Gill.</i>
<i>Yeah, it's about Down syndrome.</i>

520
00:53:19,328 --> 00:53:21,728
- You know what they told us today?
- What?

521
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:24,630
Finally, you're allowed
to attend public school.

522
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:28,565
Great, just when you graduate.
Great.

523
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,824
- Outstanding work.
- Thank you.

524
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:55,422
Thank you, and my greatest thanks
to Dr. Salter...

525
00:53:55,598 --> 00:53:59,261
...and the Winsley Gallery
of Pittsburgh, for supporting my work.

526
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:02,529
I'm a doctor. I understand science.

527
00:54:02,705 --> 00:54:05,765
But I'm afraid I'm fairly inarticulate
when it comes to art.

528
00:54:05,941 --> 00:54:09,672
My son calls me,
"a boring medical egghead."

529
00:54:09,845 --> 00:54:12,211
Which I no longer dispute.

530
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:18,918
"In camera" means,
more or less, "in secret."

531
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:22,017
And I think photography
does the exact opposite.

532
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:24,989
I think it reveals what is hidden.

533
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:42,440
But I look at these photographs and
I have no idea where they came from.

534
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:46,570
How can one live without theory? I see
the passion but I don't see the point.

535
00:54:46,749 --> 00:54:49,513
- I don't know what I was thinking...
- David?

536
00:54:55,457 --> 00:54:57,516
Have I changed that much?

537
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,950
Do you two know each other?

538
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:04,021
Yes, we do. Excuse us a moment.

539
00:55:12,975 --> 00:55:17,309
Good God, Caroline.
You live here in Pittsburgh?

540
00:55:18,814 --> 00:55:20,805
I looked all over for you.

541
00:55:20,983 --> 00:55:23,918
Atlanta, Cleveland, all those places
you had me send letters.

542
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:25,747
My husband's
a long-distance trucker.

543
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:28,014
He'd pick them up
and bring them back to me.

544
00:55:28,424 --> 00:55:29,914
You're married.

545
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:32,521
Yes.

546
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:38,057
And Phoebe? Is she still with you?

547
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:40,133
Of course.

548
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:47,673
I came to your apartment that day
after the service. You'd already left.

549
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:52,711
Were you coming to take her back?

550
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:57,315
I don't know.

551
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,013
I just wanted to see her.

552
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:02,815
No.

553
00:56:03,892 --> 00:56:07,123
You just wanted to make sure
that I wouldn't tell.

554
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:13,234
All those years you sent nothing
but little notes and lots of money.

555
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:17,498
You never asked about her. Or me.

556
00:56:17,673 --> 00:56:20,233
Then out of the blue,
I get some long rambling letter...

557
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:23,503
...about how you want her
back in your life.

558
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:26,977
Did you really think that
I was gonna let you take her away?

559
00:56:27,149 --> 00:56:30,550
- That was never my intention.
- You didn't intend any of this?

560
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:35,485
- Yes?
- Dr. Henry, is everything okay?

561
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:37,922
I'll be right out.

562
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:43,527
Look, please,
I don't have to tell her who I am.

563
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:45,223
I wanna meet her. She's 18.

564
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,632
- Why would I even let you near her?
- I just wanna know if she's okay.

565
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:51,272
- Is her health okay?
- She's fine, her heart is fine.

566
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,431
Which is not what you predicted.

567
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:57,773
She's bright and happy,
which is not what you predicted.

568
00:57:00,716 --> 00:57:02,946
She loves to sing.

569
00:57:03,118 --> 00:57:05,712
She's learning to weave.

570
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:09,853
You missed a lot of heartache, David,
but you also missed a lot of joy.

571
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:13,085
Why did you even come here
if you're not gonna let me see her?

572
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:16,123
I don't know.

573
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,425
I wanted you out of my head.

574
00:57:23,972 --> 00:57:25,769
It's over now.

575
00:57:26,942 --> 00:57:29,137
I was in love with you.

576
00:57:32,247 --> 00:57:34,112
What are you even saying?

577
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:37,112
What did I ever do
to encourage that?

578
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:41,212
Nothing.

579
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:45,457
Everything.

580
00:57:49,731 --> 00:57:51,665
I was wrong,
I shouldn't have come here.

581
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:53,324
Wait.

582
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:54,930
Wait.

583
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:59,335
Dr. Henry, I'd like you to meet one of
our biggest patrons, a fan...

584
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:04,510
- These past 40 years, he's...
- I'm sorry, would you excuse me?

585
00:58:23,732 --> 00:58:25,723
<i>Hi, this is the</i>
<i>Lindstedt Detective Agency.</i>

586
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:27,766
<i>No one's here now,</i>
<i>but leave a message...</i>

587
00:58:27,936 --> 00:58:30,200
<i>... and we'll get back to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

588
00:58:30,806 --> 00:58:32,171
My name is Dr. David Henry.

589
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:36,675
I'd like to hire you to find someone,
a woman who lives in Pittsburgh.

590
00:58:36,845 --> 00:58:39,609
There's a terrific cruise
that leaves for Alaska mid-June...

591
00:58:39,781 --> 00:58:42,215
...so you'll be there
during the solstice.

592
00:58:42,417 --> 00:58:45,409
I took it myself two years ago,
and it was amazing.

593
00:58:45,587 --> 00:58:46,884
I'll be right with you.

594
00:58:47,055 --> 00:58:49,956
I can get you a cabin with a view
and you won't believe...

595
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:51,524
Mom?

596
00:59:07,142 --> 00:59:09,269
- Hello.
- <i>Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

597
00:59:09,444 --> 00:59:12,743
I'm still in Pittsburgh.
It's gonna take me a few more days.

598
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:15,247
Is everything all right?

599
00:59:16,084 --> 00:59:18,211
Yeah, everything's fine.
How about with you?

600
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:22,983
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, God, I overslept. Bye.

601
00:59:23,158 --> 00:59:24,318
Paul.

602
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:44,002
Hello.

603
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:48,343
I told you not to call me here.

604
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:55,946
- <i>I have to see you again.</i>
- I can't, it's crazy today.

605
00:59:56,124 --> 00:59:57,989
- <i>When's David get back?</i>
- I don't know.

606
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,025
<i>Sam, listen, I can't...</i>

607
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:02,428
- <i>Norah?</i>
- Oh, God.

608
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:08,065
Paul. Paul.

609
01:00:08,236 --> 01:00:11,467
Paul. Paul.

610
01:00:13,475 --> 01:00:14,703
Paul.

611
01:00:23,518 --> 01:00:24,985
Did you talk to him?

612
01:00:25,153 --> 01:00:28,850
No, but he's very nice.
He took my picture.

613
01:00:29,725 --> 01:00:33,889
- Without asking?
- He was on the other side of the street.

614
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:29,116
Phoebe, how many times
have I told you not to talk...?

615
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:32,481
"Do not talk to strangers."
I know, I didn't talk.

616
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:33,814
You worry too much.

617
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:37,550
Phoebe, we worry because there are
people out there who would hurt you.

618
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:39,523
You treat me like I'm a little girl.

619
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:42,459
I'm a grownup now,
I can look out for myself.

620
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:30,161
Phoebe?

621
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:37,902
Go away, go away.

622
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,879
You're a bad man.
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

623
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:03,068
- Any word?
- No.

624
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:04,262
You call the police?

625
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:07,499
The police won't do anything
until he's been missing for 48 hours.

626
01:04:07,676 --> 01:04:10,110
- Did you call the school, his friends?
- I'm not stupid.

627
01:04:10,278 --> 01:04:12,269
- Why did he do this?
- I don't know, I told...

628
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:15,075
One minute he's having breakfast,
then he's storming out?

629
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,514
He doesn't have his wallet,
he doesn't have money.

630
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:19,881
He won't get very far
before he runs out of gas.

631
01:04:20,055 --> 01:04:22,683
- Maybe if you'd been here.
- Oh, now it's my fault?

632
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:25,520
I'm not talking about Pittsburgh.
I'm talking about him.

633
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:28,629
- I'm talking about "been here for him."
- I've been here for him.

634
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:30,992
We used to go fishing,
play basketball. Come on.

635
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:33,634
He hates basketball.
He hasn't been fishing for years.

636
01:04:33,802 --> 01:04:35,565
You never supported
what he wanted.

637
01:04:35,737 --> 01:04:38,365
He left because I wanted him
to have a good education?

638
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:41,600
- He wants to be a musician.
- He's a teenager. They all want...

639
01:04:41,776 --> 01:04:43,869
I'm trying to give him
everything I never had.

640
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:47,037
- Yes, and he hates you for that.
- He'll come around.

641
01:04:47,215 --> 01:04:49,547
No, he won't, we've lost him, okay?

642
01:04:50,518 --> 01:04:55,182
We've lost him, he's the only child
we have and it's too damn late.

643
01:04:55,924 --> 01:04:57,983
And I need to go to the office.

644
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,026
If you'll man the phones,
I need the keys.

645
01:05:02,664 --> 01:05:05,997
Maybe if we go into counseling,
as a family.

646
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:10,297
It's too late for me too, David.
It's too late.

647
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:25,077
Hello.

648
01:05:34,863 --> 01:05:36,296
Dad?

649
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:50,174
Are these really necessary?

650
01:05:50,345 --> 01:05:53,178
I mean, he's not a criminal.
He stole some cheese.

651
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,314
I was hungry.

652
01:05:57,052 --> 01:06:01,512
Paul, sweetie.
Thank God you're safe.

653
01:06:06,861 --> 01:06:07,885
Is he going to jail?

654
01:06:08,063 --> 01:06:11,499
The supermarket where he shoplifted
has agreed not to press charges.

655
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,691
Fine, great. He's grounded.

656
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:16,701
Mom, I have to rehearse.
I have a concert in a week.

657
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:20,034
You can't just do what you did
and expect things to go on as usual.

658
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:22,537
Oh, really?

659
01:06:24,646 --> 01:06:28,343
Okay, fine. Then I'm not going home.
I'd rather go to jail, I'd rather be dead.

660
01:06:28,516 --> 01:06:30,814
- You don't mean that.
- You wanna bet?

661
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:36,081
I am sick of you.

662
01:06:44,399 --> 01:06:45,661
Miss.

663
01:06:48,937 --> 01:06:50,700
All right.

664
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:54,869
Why?

665
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:59,672
I applied to Juilliard
without you knowing it.

666
01:07:01,116 --> 01:07:03,914
Duke drove me down to Chicago
last month so I could audition.

667
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:08,421
- And I got accepted.
- Good.

668
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:12,784
Good for you.

669
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:15,462
I thought you'd be pissed.

670
01:07:17,632 --> 01:07:20,396
If it's what you want,
go and be happy.

671
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:23,937
I'm proud of you, son.

672
01:07:28,376 --> 01:07:30,037
Mom's got a boyfriend.

673
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:34,943
I know.

674
01:07:38,653 --> 01:07:40,086
He's not the first, Dad.

675
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:53,125
- You're not coming in?
- I won't be long.

676
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:58,963
- Where are you going?
- No place you'd wanna come.

677
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,331
Robert, Phoebe, that's enough.

678
01:09:37,505 --> 01:09:39,564
It's okay, Phoebe's my girlfriend.

679
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:42,141
We love each other.
You kiss someone you love.

680
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:45,643
That's true,
but that looked like more than kissing.

681
01:09:45,914 --> 01:09:47,848
Mom, we're getting married.

682
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:51,384
What? No, you're not.

683
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,246
Why not?

684
01:09:55,757 --> 01:09:58,089
Because it's complicated.

685
01:09:58,493 --> 01:10:01,121
- Where would you live?
- Here.

686
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:03,526
- Oh, Phoebe.
- We'll buy a house.

687
01:10:03,698 --> 01:10:05,529
With what? How will you afford it?

688
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,191
I have a job. So does Phoebe.

689
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:11,295
We're gonna get married
and have lots of babies.

690
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:16,605
Babies are an awful lot of work.

691
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:20,475
And, Phoebe, you can't keep a job
if you're watching babies.

692
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:24,579
I love Robert, and Robert loves me.
Why can't we get married?

693
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:27,050
- Oh, honey.
- It's not fair.

694
01:10:27,222 --> 01:10:30,953
I know, I know it's not fair.
So much in life isn't fair.

695
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,059
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
Come on, let's finish getting dressed.

696
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:39,166
- Why can't it be simple?
- Maybe it is simple.

697
01:10:39,334 --> 01:10:41,234
Maybe she needs
to move into a group home.

698
01:10:41,402 --> 01:10:43,893
She is not ready
to go out in the world.

699
01:10:44,072 --> 01:10:45,801
And she certainly can't get married.

700
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:51,310
I mean, what if she got pregnant?
I don't wanna raise another child.

701
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:53,037
Look, ever since I met you...

702
01:10:53,214 --> 01:10:56,445
...you've been demanding
that the world not slam doors on her.

703
01:10:57,418 --> 01:10:59,352
Why can't she move out?

704
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:01,880
Why not let her try?

705
01:11:02,557 --> 01:11:04,081
Because...

706
01:11:06,861 --> 01:11:09,056
...I can't let her go.

707
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:14,667
I can't imagine my life without her.

708
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,505
Come on, we're gonna be late.

709
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:27,540
Come, Mom. Let's sit up front.
Come, Robert.

710
01:11:27,715 --> 01:11:29,012
Oh, I don't know, honey.

711
01:11:29,183 --> 01:11:30,946
It's open seating. Why not?

712
01:11:32,854 --> 01:11:35,186
He's not gonna recognize her.

713
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,444
There you go, Tabitha.

714
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:42,885
- How's that feel?
- Okay.

715
01:12:43,057 --> 01:12:46,424
All your friends are gonna sign
their names and draw pictures on it.

716
01:12:47,695 --> 01:12:48,889
Doctor, Paul called.

717
01:12:49,063 --> 01:12:50,792
- Oh, excuse me.
- Oh, he couldn't talk.

718
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:54,025
He just wanted to remind you
that today is Norah's birthday.

719
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:56,627
Hi.

720
01:12:56,804 --> 01:12:58,635
What could I get you
that you don't have?

721
01:12:58,806 --> 01:13:01,536
<i>How about a trip?</i>
<i>I know a great travel agent.</i>

722
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:05,777
Well, you could do me a favor.
Well, two, really.

723
01:13:05,947 --> 01:13:07,812
I'll do my best. Shoot.

724
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:11,852
You know Frederick and I are getting
married and moving to France?

725
01:13:12,019 --> 01:13:15,250
- Yeah, I heard.
- <i>Well, we're gonna sell the house.</i>

726
01:13:15,523 --> 01:13:17,184
You could clean out that darkroom...

727
01:13:17,358 --> 01:13:19,883
...like you've been promising
for the last three years.

728
01:13:22,296 --> 01:13:23,456
Yeah, sure.

729
01:13:23,631 --> 01:13:27,089
If you wanna be sweet, get someone
to fix that drip under the kitchen sink.

730
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:29,702
It's gotten worse,
and the plumber's on vacation.

731
01:13:29,871 --> 01:13:31,270
How old are you, Norah?

732
01:13:32,306 --> 01:13:34,604
- Forty-six.
- <i>Well, that's good.</i>

733
01:13:34,776 --> 01:13:37,973
Because I'd only do a favor like that
for someone turning 46.

734
01:13:39,947 --> 01:13:43,508
Thanks. It was good of you to call.

735
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:45,643
Bye.

736
01:14:22,523 --> 01:14:25,651
<i>Hey, Mom. Just wanted</i>
<i>to wish you happy birthday.</i>

737
01:14:26,427 --> 01:14:28,895
<i>I love you. Bye.</i>

738
01:14:34,869 --> 01:14:36,393
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

739
01:14:36,571 --> 01:14:39,904
<i>I love you so much,</i>
<i>and I count the days until we marry.</i>

740
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,465
David.

741
01:16:59,313 --> 01:17:01,008
David?

742
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:09,923
David?

743
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:12,989
- To Carrie?
- Great show last night, man.

744
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,321
- You were terrific.
- Thanks.

745
01:17:16,664 --> 01:17:18,222
Backstage.

746
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:20,424
Hey, Mom, what's up?
Did you get my message?

747
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:24,002
- I called to wish you happy birthday.
- <i>Paul, Paul.</i>

748
01:17:24,805 --> 01:17:26,670
It's your father.

749
01:17:29,443 --> 01:17:31,934
I asked him to fix the drip
in the kitchen sink.

750
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:36,277
And I came home
to find him collapsed on the floor.

751
01:17:37,585 --> 01:17:41,885
- What happened?
- <i>Oh, they think it was an aneurysm.</i>

752
01:17:42,056 --> 01:17:44,183
Something he'd been carrying
his entire life...

753
01:17:44,358 --> 01:17:48,158
...without anyone knowing it,
and today, it just broke.

754
01:17:49,897 --> 01:17:52,229
What do you mean?
Is he gonna be all right?

755
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,961
Paul.

756
01:17:57,505 --> 01:17:59,439
Paul, he's dead.

757
01:18:21,862 --> 01:18:23,090
You guys looked happy.

758
01:18:25,766 --> 01:18:27,427
We were.

759
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:34,096
Look at these.
I forgot how cute you were.

760
01:18:34,275 --> 01:18:35,299
"Were"?

761
01:18:35,476 --> 01:18:38,070
You ought to use that
for your concert poster.

762
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:41,980
- Yeah, right, Mom.
- Why not?

763
01:18:47,688 --> 01:18:51,089
What's this?
There's hundreds of them.

764
01:18:51,258 --> 01:18:52,816
Who are these?

765
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:55,060
I haven't a clue.

766
01:18:57,164 --> 01:18:59,098
They're all different too.

767
01:19:04,305 --> 01:19:07,331
So someone's actually
gonna buy all these?

768
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:09,503
Museums are interested.

769
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:13,306
- A few dealers too.
- Really?

770
01:19:21,122 --> 01:19:22,749
I'd like this one.

771
01:19:23,924 --> 01:19:27,189
Of course.
He'd want you to have that.

772
01:19:35,636 --> 01:19:36,967
You can have this too.

773
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:39,467
If you want.

774
01:19:44,745 --> 01:19:45,769
Thanks, Mom.

775
01:19:55,623 --> 01:19:58,490
This must be to the locked files.

776
01:19:59,693 --> 01:20:01,888
Why did he lockup
his insurance files?

777
01:20:14,675 --> 01:20:16,438
Who is this?

778
01:20:18,512 --> 01:20:20,412
She looks familiar.

779
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:27,179
It's weird though.
They're all of the same girl.

780
01:20:31,358 --> 01:20:35,692
I don't get it. He never had
a Polaroid camera, did he?

781
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:39,827
Who is that?

782
01:20:46,874 --> 01:20:49,707
Mom, who's C. Gill?

783
01:21:19,173 --> 01:21:20,197
Mom?

784
01:21:47,968 --> 01:21:49,094
Bastard!

785
01:21:57,278 --> 01:21:58,939
Bastard.

786
01:22:31,045 --> 01:22:32,512
I was thinking.

787
01:22:35,883 --> 01:22:37,942
You know
that box of pictures of girls?

788
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:40,313
We didn't know who they were?

789
01:22:41,655 --> 01:22:45,489
I think that those are pictures
that he took of girls.

790
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:49,186
Perfect girls growing up.

791
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,554
Just like he took pictures of me.

792
01:22:54,835 --> 01:22:56,564
He missed her too, Mom.

793
01:22:57,838 --> 01:23:01,831
He lost a daughter too. Just like you.

794
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:32,898
I found an address.

795
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:35,906
Among his things.

796
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,444
She's in Pittsburgh, Mom.

797
01:23:41,815 --> 01:23:43,840
She's in Pittsburgh.

798
01:24:19,753 --> 01:24:21,721
Caroline Gill.

799
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,061
We found your letters
in David's office.

800
01:24:34,368 --> 01:24:36,563
He died over a week ago.

801
01:24:37,438 --> 01:24:39,133
Oh, God.

802
01:24:41,308 --> 01:24:42,639
Oh, God.

803
01:24:44,144 --> 01:24:45,634
Mom.

804
01:24:46,046 --> 01:24:47,946
Mom, I got a surprise.

805
01:24:49,616 --> 01:24:51,106
Come on, come over.

806
01:24:52,986 --> 01:24:55,011
Come, come over here.

807
01:25:09,336 --> 01:25:11,964
I didn't pick them.
I bought them with my own money.

808
01:25:12,773 --> 01:25:14,798
Happy Mother's Day.

809
01:25:14,975 --> 01:25:17,136
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

810
01:25:22,716 --> 01:25:24,308
Come here.

811
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:29,050
- Hello.
- Hello, Phoebe.

812
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:30,850
Who are you?

813
01:25:33,026 --> 01:25:35,426
She's your mom, sweetheart.

814
01:25:35,829 --> 01:25:38,662
No, she's not. You're my mom.

815
01:25:40,567 --> 01:25:42,797
Why are you crying? Are you okay?

816
01:25:43,403 --> 01:25:44,563
I know I'm your mom.

817
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:51,337
And I always will be,
but you grew in Norah's tummy...

818
01:25:51,512 --> 01:25:53,480
...before you came to live with me.

819
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:58,009
I didn't tell you when you were little,
because I didn't want to confuse you.

820
01:25:58,185 --> 01:25:59,675
And I wanted you to know...

821
01:25:59,853 --> 01:26:05,086
...that I love you more than anything
or anyone. Okay?

822
01:26:05,626 --> 01:26:08,254
But you're old enough now
to understand, okay?

823
01:26:09,263 --> 01:26:11,390
Okay, come here.

824
01:26:16,036 --> 01:26:20,496
Hey, I know you. I saw you play.
You're very good.

825
01:26:22,509 --> 01:26:23,942
Thanks.

826
01:26:25,712 --> 01:26:26,906
What are you doing here?

827
01:26:27,915 --> 01:26:29,883
This is your brother, Phoebe.

828
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:33,914
Your twin brother, Paul.

829
01:26:35,923 --> 01:26:38,687
Wow, very nice to meet you.

830
01:26:39,293 --> 01:26:41,523
It's very nice to meet you too.

831
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:45,457
Why don't we all go inside?

832
01:26:45,632 --> 01:26:47,964
Phoebe made some iced tea
this morning, didn't you?

833
01:26:48,135 --> 01:26:51,036
Yeah, and it's not from a mix.
It's the real thing.

834
01:26:55,008 --> 01:26:56,703
Happy Mother's Day.

835
01:27:07,454 --> 01:27:10,480
Wanna see my room, Paul?
I like music too.

836
01:27:10,657 --> 01:27:14,149
I got a new record player.
I got it from Robert.

837
01:27:14,661 --> 01:27:16,424
- Who's Robert?
- My boyfriend.

838
01:27:16,597 --> 01:27:20,795
He thinks we should get married.
But I don't think that's a good idea.

839
01:27:22,669 --> 01:27:25,399
He didn't...

840
01:27:26,907 --> 01:27:28,272
He thought...

841
01:27:30,177 --> 01:27:34,409
People thought, you know,
babies like Phoebe, they...

842
01:27:35,315 --> 01:27:37,613
He thought she wouldn't live.

843
01:27:38,685 --> 01:27:41,984
He was doing
what he thought was best.

844
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:45,724
You make mistakes...

845
01:27:46,793 --> 01:27:49,591
...and then you try and fix them
and you move on.

846
01:27:50,097 --> 01:27:53,260
