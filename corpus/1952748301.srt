1
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:38,282
I saw a strange dream.

2
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,564
It's Friday, we
are in the hospital

3
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:46,565
not a hospital though.
It is a forest...

4
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:51,061
And I know this because,

5
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:55,062
your side is a bear and
a little over a stream.

6
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:03,457
And suddenly you begin to give
rise and I can not get into.

7
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:10,258
But the bear can...

8
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:15,109
And soon I see that holds the
hands of our beautiful baby boy!

9
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,360
And here is where it
gets really weird dream...

10
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:24,466
Intersects with the teeth
of the umbilical cord,

11
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:26,466
and I do not seem
to be annoyed.

12
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,409
This should be a good sign!

13
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:43,530
The Theodore I liked, but
remember that article I had shown,

14
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:46,892
saying that we should not give our
children the names of famous people?

15
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:50,893
I do not want to think that it
failed if not do something...

16
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:53,547
...Arthur! The Arthur is good.

17
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:57,481
There is the myth
of the Round Table...

18
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,588
But there's a word game

19
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:02,576
which is not very flattering
to the name Arthur.

20
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:04,345
And then we come to Casey.

21
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:06,580
Where is the list
of names like...

22
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,354
Casey, Dylan Jordan,
Tyler and Skailer...

23
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,535
which are all girls names.

24
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:15,061
If so the call through Sydney.

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:22,054
I try to leave Atlanta. In
Denver there is more bread

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,917
There is an underground
conspiracy government.

27
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:26,989
So?

28
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,493
There has been much buzz
and discussion forums.

29
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:32,192
Wait a minute, to answer
my phone. Hi darling.

30
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,262
Hi. -Did you get my message?

31
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,735
I got it and I heard
around the waist.

32
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:38,476
I went for a break.

33
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:42,209
Look, I would not like to think that
arbitrarily rejected these names...

34
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,621
You can see them
for yourself...

35
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,526
But it is a great
decision to take.

36
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:49,649
Yes, I see than you take very
seriously the whole issue.

37
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,303
I have not told me
yet... What direction?

38
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,649
Armani!

39
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,539
I call my wife... no no...
The driver is my baby.

40
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,969
Listen, just arrived at
the airport... I gotta go...

41
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,387
Bye, love you and I
can not wait to meet!

42
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,198
Goodbye, I love you...
have a nice flight!

43
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:21,017
I hit the car! I
plucked out the door!

44
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:23,620
Sorry... Tell me
first, he hit anyone?

45
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:27,621
I have a limo. You have not heard
of the protocol at the airport?

46
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:52,090
Set... This is serious
damage... That is nothing!

47
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:58,560
Are you okay? Sorry for my
friend... I think it is drunk.

48
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:01,548
And you look a bit...
Does pinate together?

49
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:05,638
You can not say that... we drank
a half a dozen beers we shared.

50
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,205
You know something? My father used
to say... when your day starts so...

51
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:14,292
then all will be like a
huge uphill afterwards.

52
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:16,293
This is wrong...

53
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:19,473
Normally they say that
everything is like a downhill.

54
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:21,208
But everybody wants to be
over... no one wants to be down.

55
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,343
So say it is an uphill.

56
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:24,212
Yes, but it's easier
to be a downhill...

57
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:25,701
So your dad had no idea!

58
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:26,760
Selby? Are you okay?

59
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,815
A happy man! We
take care of myself!

60
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:33,083
Excuse me sir, but you
can lift my suitcases?

61
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,622
No, because they say
that you should never,

62
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:37,322
to grab their luggage
in a foreign airport.

63
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:41,134
Pick them yourself.

64
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:58,207
Checking baggage!

65
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:01,697
In your owns this bag?
-Is there a problem?

66
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:04,843
Can I look at the fast?
-Yes, yes... course.

67
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,496
What magazine is
this? Very cute.

68
00:05:08,497 --> 00:05:10,203
This is not mine.

69
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:12,204
But is your bag...

70
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,480
Bingo!

71
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,261
This is definitely not mine!

72
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:17,581
Not mine this bag...
Mistook her before with...

73
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:18,675
Pack your own suitcase sir?

74
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:22,676
Yes, but not this bag.
I never did my drugs.

75
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:25,047
Maybe carry drugs...

76
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,888
You look like someone
carrying drugs?

77
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,781
I do not know what they
look like they carry drugs...

78
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:29,889
What to say...
You're the expert?

79
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,517
What do you say?
That's the look like me?

80
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:32,261
Who said that?

81
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:33,563
Your eyes! Your eyes say...

82
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:35,218
My eyes? Eyes say something
that says my mouth?

83
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:37,241
I do not think
you look like...

84
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:41,160
You could not stir
things so much... I?

85
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,705
Tempelakos you... eh?

86
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:45,928
Your behavior
is inappropriate!

87
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,929
I have been told many things
about my behavior... but not so!

88
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:14,946
My God! Look Sunny! Very
posh. As you are in paradise!

89
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:50,894
Well are you serious? Not
see that anyone sitting here?

90
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:52,845
Excuse me.

91
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:56,846
Hi! What are you doing? What
brings you to the A position?

92
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:02,164
The ticket is closed!

93
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:03,850
I was in tourism,

94
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:06,855
but the seat belt was broken,
and brought him to the A position.

95
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:07,807
Do not tell me...

96
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:10,108
I was lucky. Nice to see you!

97
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:20,497
You know what? I think I
accidentally took the bag before you.

98
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,156
I know.

99
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:26,157
The bag I was seized, along
with a pipe for marijuana had.

100
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:30,668
What I had for medical
purposes... I have glaucoma.

101
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,930
Yes convinced us...

102
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,928
Ladies and gentlemen we
are ready for takeoff.

103
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,047
Please turn off all
electronic devices,

104
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,411
if you have laptop, place
it in the cupboard above.

105
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:41,131
Thank you very
much. Good flight.

106
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:42,557
Dude? -Yes?

107
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:44,676
They notice. We
need to hang it.

108
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:47,282
We need to hang up. -I'll go.

109
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,489
Know why you should hang up?

110
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,298
Because terrorists often
use the time off their mobile

111
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,759
to activate a bomb located
in the luggage down.

112
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,353
Be not say this word? -What
for? Terrorist or bomb?

113
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:57,839
Just said together the two words
you should never say on board.

114
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,256
I understand but we
must understand that...

115
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:02,519
Stop talking and just listen.

116
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,489
You should not say words
that make others to scare.

117
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,725
Just trying to...

118
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:08,156
This is not right...

119
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:11,179
You and your friend can
get in front of the plane?

120
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,735
My friend?

121
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:14,736
Excuse me...

122
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:16,765
Listen.

123
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,075
This Karagiozi I have
not ever seen in my life.

124
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:21,524
This is not true, we exchanged
our bags at the airport.

125
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:23,525
This was accidental!

126
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,179
Lord! I'm Federal Agent.

127
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,039
Please come to the
front of the airplane.

128
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,096
What Why?

129
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:31,096
Let down your
device. -Is my phone.

130
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:32,774
Throw down the
device eh asshole!

131
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:35,608
What you gonna do shoot
me in front of everyone?

132
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:41,254
Do not worry. It hurt.
It is a rubber ball.

133
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:50,849
I have good news Mr Hyman. They
found your luggage on board.

134
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,719
Good.

135
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,082
Unfortunately, the aircraft
travels over the Kansas now.

136
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,280
But I have your mobile phone.

137
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:02,104
You can now sign
here. Is your release.

138
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:03,925
Yes... for you will not sue?

139
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:06,032
He says he did so according
to the laws of the state.

140
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,963
Yes. Sure.

141
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,763
If you write your address
to send you your luggage.

142
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:12,940
No. Leave to go to LA Airport,

143
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:14,928
and will I get when
I get there myself.

144
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,005
When is the next flight?

145
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:17,838
In no time, but
you can not get it.

146
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,906
Why?

147
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:21,926
Because you're on the
blacklist of airlines.

148
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:22,916
Why?

149
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:26,183
This explains here.
Both you and your friend.

150
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:26,961
Who?

151
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:28,163
The gentleman who
just interrogated.

152
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,704
I've never seen this
asshole in my life.

153
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:33,646
Really? He again had only
good things to say about you.

154
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:36,946
This is ridiculous!
-No matter...

155
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:39,713
My wife is pregnant!
Need to go back to LA

156
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:43,112
This is a big misunderstanding.
What do I do now?

157
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:45,418
Have you seen the
movie Forrest Gump?

158
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,945
Yes.

159
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:50,124
He crossed our country
running, and it was stupid!

160
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,816
So I think it
will succeed too.

161
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,886
You are free to leave.

162
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,149
What exactly happens?

163
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,792
Probably the paraleo...
We can handle it.

164
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:04,793
But unfortunately I
can not fly to come.

165
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:09,026
What did you do? Beat someone?

166
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:13,027
No! I was calm and logical...

167
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,547
Sometimes drifting!

168
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:19,189
How are you coming home?

169
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,723
I plan...

170
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:23,396
And my plan unfolded slowly
as my wallet travels to LA

171
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:24,439
What?

172
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Yes, and I try to exhaust
all means available to it...

173
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,097
In looking everywhere!

174
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:37,787
Stay away from me!
All causes me trouble.

175
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:39,778
I found something
that belongs to you.

176
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,510
Honey may have found a
solution... I'll call you later.

177
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Peter?

178
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,653
You have my stuff?

179
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,774
'Rpaxa this before
I put handcuffs.

180
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:51,048
The monkey? Got my wallet?

181
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,407
I saw no wallet?

182
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:53,697
Where is my bag?

183
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:55,010
I saw your bag,

184
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:59,011
but I could not get it because my
hands were full with the monkey...

185
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:00,548
What car did you?

186
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:04,549
I did not get the car because I am
not driving, because it is my bag...

187
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:08,989
Shit...

188
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,333
Yes... Thanks for your doll.

189
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,505
Want to come with us?

190
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,441
No! Well I'm... Not
crazy for the dogs...

191
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,344
I know I did not start well...

192
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:26,183
But I see that I have
great character when I know.

193
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,667
Yes I'm sure...

194
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,040
I have 90 friends on facebook.

195
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,337
12 of them are outstanding,
but I have 90 friends!

196
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,483
Cover the costs of your

197
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:36,988
and I will pay back
when we get to Hollywood.

198
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,106
In LA!

199
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:38,998
What?

200
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,417
It is called Hollywood,
but Los Angeles!

201
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:44,811
I once again go to Hollywood.

202
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,120
What is your name?

203
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:48,627
Peter.

204
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:51,248
I am Ethan Tremblay.

205
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:55,249
And this little
guy here is Sunny.

206
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,684
It was a great honor to come
with us. Come on! It is fun!

207
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:19,703
The screwed! Plakitsa
did! Come inside!

208
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,663
Strange is the life, eh?

209
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,087
Do you have siblings? -No.

210
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:36,698
Got dog? -No.

211
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,597
Let me ask you... What
is your favorite color?

212
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:42,796
Blue.

213
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:45,369
What's good... Mine is green!

214
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:50,065
Do you like hotdogs? -Yes.

215
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,559
I like the sausages
with a crust outside.

216
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,953
One time I ate a huge
sausage at a nudist beach,

217
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:56,954
and will not do it again.

218
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:58,971
At what age were you when
you lost your virginity?.

219
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:00,982
We will not discuss
this with you!

220
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:03,015
I was 9. -My God!

221
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:07,016
Very good girl! Good girl...
He had freckles remember.

222
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,451
I have a headache. Not your
fault, but that the press too long.

223
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:14,810
My wife and I will
get a baby. Friday.

224
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:16,062
That's why I
bought the monkey.

225
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:16,980
Seriously?

226
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:19,316
Yes... We do caesarean...

227
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:20,843
So you see...

228
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:24,844
I understand! I would meet
a manager in Holllywood,

229
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:28,889
and my good luck
canceled our appointment.

230
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,063
Are you an actor?

231
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:34,064
Yes... And you know... I
would like to took a look at...

232
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,995
Watch out!

233
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,563
Sorry.

234
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:42,564
Look at this.

235
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,910
Ok, But you having
the eyes to the street.

236
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,558
It's pictures.

237
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,559
Here I look hard, but I have a
gun just for peacekeeping purposes.

238
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,288
Interesting

239
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,026
This one is a
favorite of my father.

240
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:58,517
He says it shows my real self.

241
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:00,660
I agree with him.

242
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:02,189
What are these?

243
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,170
Here I sit in a gang,
construction worker, and...

244
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:10,156
...and Professor nerd?
-No! I make Malcolm X!

245
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,188
He thinks he is a
man! The chazoulis!

246
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:25,737
Peter, what a bore in
Atlanta? Job or wellbeing?

247
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:27,468
Job...

248
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:29,398
What kind of job?

249
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,258
Architecture.

250
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:33,086
And how did you and dealt
with the work of architecture?

251
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:33,958
I went to college.

252
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,662
You have nothing else
to ask why I try to...

253
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:38,689
Well because it will travel
together for a few days

254
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,988
and was not bad to
know each other better.

255
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:45,502
Well... Ethan. What brought on
in Atlanta? Business or pleasure?

256
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:49,897
My dad died. I went to
Atlanta for his funeral.

257
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:52,659
Oh, my God. Sorry.

258
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,477
It was a very nice
man. So I go and west...

259
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,553
He gave me the motivation
to go on television.

260
00:14:58,554 --> 00:15:00,729
On TV? -Yes.

261
00:15:01,352 --> 00:15:04,354
It is very hard space of
television. Very competitive.

262
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,639
I have a friend who
works in this area...

263
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,750
Do you work for the
serial: Two and a half man?

264
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:13,721
Because of this serial because
I wanted to become an actress.

265
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:16,616
Especially because
of the second season.

266
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:21,244
Listen to the project. We are
located outside of Birmingham.

267
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:25,245
Because we started late morning
we get out of Louisiana...

268
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:30,809
after 16 hours we will be
near Phoenix, Arizona...

269
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,779
and then we are
8 hours from LA

270
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,517
It would be nice if we
stop at the Grand Canyon.

271
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,136
I will not go to the Grand
Canyon! And I'll tell you why.

272
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:41,515
Because you will get
120 miles off course

273
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:45,516
Too bad. My dad would love
to go to the Grand Canyon.

274
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:47,847
Why is this?

275
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:51,848
This is my dad. The ashes.

276
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:56,772
Why is your father's ashes
in a box of coffee, Ethan?

277
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:58,560
Since Peter is dead!

278
00:15:58,561 --> 00:15:59,484
I know that.

279
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:01,481
Oh well, do not watch
each other when speaking?

280
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:05,339
Just know that we put
the ashes in a urn.

281
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,110
This is tightly closed.

282
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:11,111
Ethan took the lid when you threw the
coffee and put your father through...

283
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:14,366
Now it is vacuum sealed box.

284
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:17,084
This is the most stupid
thing I've heard in my life!

285
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:27,426
It had to come here.
I'm allergic to waffles.

286
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,088
Come Sunny. Thanks.

287
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:38,794
We will make a brief
stop in Birmingham.

288
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,989
Basically, our next stop
will be much farther away.

289
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,751
It is 10 minutes away and
stop-pull for a few seconds...

290
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,185
But why stop in
Birmingham, Alabama;

291
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:47,571
We must not procrastinate.

292
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,870
Why I left my medication
in the treatment plane.

293
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:52,749
Wait! What I mean your grass?

294
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,961
Peter is a medical marijuana.

295
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:55,831
No is grass.

296
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,132
Why should you
bring disaster ever?

297
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,624
Not to bring, and is grass!

298
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,873
Just say that we do not want to
stop and buy drugs! Does it matter?

299
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:05,533
Look... I will not say
this now, but it forced me!

300
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:08,062
Guess who rented the car? Me!

301
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:10,008
Guess who has the money? Me!

302
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:12,425
Guess who has a
pleasant personality? Me!

303
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:13,912
How about you?

304
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:15,913
You have nice hair
and chin voluntarily,

305
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:17,913
but allowed me to tell you...

306
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:23,127
need to build your character!

307
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,842
So you want to go
to California or not?

308
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:29,122
Yes I do. -Great! Keep Dad!

309
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:31,915
I got him.

310
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:38,503
Opening hours are like
traveling with a toddler!

311
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:39,683
Did you go the toilet?

312
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,021
Well to tell!
Tsisakia'm going to do!

313
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:44,966
Peter?

314
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,650
You will not believe
this, but I'm on the road!

315
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:48,648
How is it possible? -He
left me to talk to her.

316
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:50,561
With a guy... please stop...

317
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:53,050
With a guy I met in
the office rental cab.

318
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,404
I drive 2000 miles with
a guy who just met me?

319
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:56,443
Say hello to...

320
00:17:56,444 --> 00:18:00,255
Sarah? I'm Ethan Trimble, and travel
with Peter. What are you doing?

321
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:02,358
Well I am, you?,

322
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,102
Well well... Just wanted to
inform you that I pack your

323
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:08,578
to be in perfect condition, and
how will I deliver as Thursday.

324
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:10,721
Thank you.

325
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,854
Sarah would like to ask you one more
thing. Do you know any good hairdresser

326
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:17,195
because I do perm and I would
like to soulouposo just my hair.

327
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,446
Sorry, you said
that you do perms?

328
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:22,175
Yes, perm, I do
my hair curly...

329
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,105
It sucks!

330
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:25,258
Can I talk to my husband?

331
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,542
Yes of course. Wait.

332
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:28,349
He wants to talk
to you. -I know.

333
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,091
You know what I have to do?

334
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:30,812
Oh my God...

335
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:33,742
Yes like you say...

336
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,974
Do not worry. -Do not worry.

337
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:40,097
It is a legal practitioner.
I found on the internet.

338
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:42,098
Who is it?

339
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:43,253
Fantastic...

340
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:46,518
Hi, I'm Ethan,
I phoned earlier.

341
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:50,431
Ends in two minutes to go.

342
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:51,594
Hello.

343
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:52,689
You came very quickly.

344
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,004
Yes we were close. I am
Ethan from here Peter.

345
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:57,572
Are you a cop?

346
00:18:57,573 --> 00:19:00,117
Why not licensed pharmacist?

347
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:01,878
Just look a caretaker.

348
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,736
And so you know
you're a cop and ask

349
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:06,872
You have to admit it.

350
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:10,039
This in fact is a myth.
But I'm not anyway.

351
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,148
It is an architect.

352
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,708
I am an architect when...

353
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:16,709
Wait a minute... It is a myth?
You kidding me? I did not know it.

354
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:22,201
You're too scary.

355
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,206
Come on in Ethan. The
pharmacy is in the kitchen.

356
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:29,207
Peter, you can watch my
kids as we... You know...

357
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:32,546
Hurry up. -Yes.

358
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:45,727
Who are you?

359
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:47,362
I'm Peter.

360
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:49,655
I'm Alex, and here Patrick.

361
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,656
Good. Alex? Your mother
gave you boyish name.

362
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,927
What do you mean?

363
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,133
The Alex is boyish name...

364
00:19:58,134 --> 00:20:01,653
As you know your
mom have screwed up.

365
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,859
Sorry, my hand slipped.

366
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:18,989
Once I got it. It's a mixture
that comes from Afghanistan.

367
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:23,602
Not crazy about mixing. I feel
they lose something in the taste.

368
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:29,106
Go crazy with this variety.

369
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:33,107
She has perfect body,
and smells like a dream!

370
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:38,699
This is Barry. I rent a room.

371
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,051
Hey Barry, what are
you doing? I'm Ethan.

372
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:45,097
Let me tell you... In the
room I see something on TV.

373
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:48,235
It is open. You just have
to press the menu button.

374
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:51,521
Nice perm has a bar.
You did a great job.

375
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:54,662
Thank you very much, but it
is not perm it is natural.

376
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:58,663
Nobody do perms anymore. Do
not tell me that you've done?

377
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:02,624
Yes I did.

378
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,247
My God. Kidding.

379
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:08,767
Who did?

380
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:14,704
Just Kidding. There is perm.

381
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:15,490
Excuse me?

382
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:18,519
It is not perm it.
I was joking before.

383
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:22,627
Deceive them both.

384
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:26,628
It was. Very funny!

385
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:35,272
From where are you?

386
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:36,589
From LA

387
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,130
There you go now?

388
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:41,944
Could you take with you?

389
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:46,232
No, but there is a body called
the Protection of Children...

390
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:49,266
What is it? -This is a tie?

391
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,600
You have never seen
in your life tie?

392
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,036
Why did you wear? -Why do so.

393
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:54,333
Shows stupid.

394
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:57,591
It is not, and
under your hands!

395
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:01,608
Stop to do this.

396
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,855
Please stop.

397
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:06,184
I do not. The blame Reggie.

398
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:09,671
Then maybe it would be
better to get Reggie a nap.

399
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:14,694
Stop! No kidding!

400
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:22,646
Well are you buddy?

401
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:31,226
What?

402
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:33,227
Nothing!

403
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:35,462
So bravo...

404
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:40,354
Now come to me and say,

405
00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:44,355
Don Corleone
awarded me justice...

406
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:51,133
...but you do not have the
decency to call me Godfather...

407
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:57,107
and come to my house the day of
the marriage of my daughter...

408
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:03,283
and ask me to kill
someone for a fee...

409
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,237
But this is not justice!

410
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,944
That was incredible!
I shudder.

411
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:18,236
Especially in the second paragraph
you say that the murder...

412
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:19,706
You are very good Ethan.

413
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:23,119
I worked very much hand movement
to accomplish this result.

414
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,143
You wrote the text?

415
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:28,057
No. One of the mafia wrote.

416
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:32,064
I was glad to meet you...

417
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:34,547
Do as if nothing was wrong.
Otherwise I will hit you again!

418
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,975
Ready? -Yes! Let's go!

419
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:39,446
How was it? Your
well-behaved?

420
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:41,767
More or less yes.

421
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:45,177
Good. They are good guys.

422
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,549
We're okay?

423
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:53,685
See you. Good luck
with your acting career!

424
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,009
...The first thing to
do with any actor...

425
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,401
preparing for the
role, is to read the...

426
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:35,108
scene many times before
pretend. To read the full...

427
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:38,562
material, if possible throughout
the script. And then...

428
00:24:38,563 --> 00:24:40,913
Hey. Hollywood.

429
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:43,856
What did you say?

430
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,950
Your card is not valid.

431
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,256
Oh, my God. -Never mind...

432
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:50,818
You know what? Have to pass the
threshold when I rented this car.

433
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:53,279
Never mind... We will
pay cash. How are you?

434
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,890
About $ 60.

435
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:58,891
You are left only $ 60?

436
00:24:59,071 --> 00:24:59,879
Yes.

437
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,066
How much spend on
marijuana? In your medicine?

438
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,184
I'm not sure. About $ 200.

439
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:08,106
$ 200?. And left only 60
for petrol food and housing?

440
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,411
It is the only dealer in the
area. It has its own prices.

441
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:12,785
What was going through
your mind when you wasted...

442
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:14,789
almost all our money on drugs.

443
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,249
I do not think I would
have trouble following.

444
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,219
What were you thinking?

445
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,906
Peter I am not an
accountant nor a Jew.

446
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:21,152
Are you an adult?

447
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,745
Obviously I'm an adult.
I am 23 years old.

448
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:26,268
You're the most irresponsible
23 year old I've ever met.

449
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:27,354
How do you live so long?

450
00:25:27,355 --> 00:25:30,093
How and did not throw yourself
in front of a car so far?

451
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:31,138
I did that.

452
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:34,074
How to survive?
Here is my question.

453
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,488
I guess I was lucky.

454
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:38,984
Yes... The imagined.
Get off the waist.

455
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:41,636
For God's sake Peter.
-The paint we have Ethan.

456
00:25:41,637 --> 00:25:42,700
Why do you say that?

457
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:44,473
Why spend all our
money on marijuana.

458
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:45,748
A small barrier is...

459
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:48,167
You know what? Would
call the woman...

460
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:50,585
send me my money.
That will do.

461
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:53,036
I can not send you because
you have no identity.

462
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:55,884
You're right. We will
send to you. You see...?

463
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:58,196
So an adult solves a problem.

464
00:25:58,197 --> 00:25:59,619
I said I was lucky.

465
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,970
Get in the car.

466
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:08,411
In a leptaki. I want to
get an ad for my album.

467
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:14,007
How do you write your name?

468
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:17,547
T-r-e-m-p-l-e-j.

469
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:21,625
Ready. $ 500 to Ethan Tremblay.

470
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:24,666
I just want to
see an identity.

471
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:28,384
Here you are.

472
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:35,595
You told me that you say Tremblay.
Here he writes Ethan Chase.

473
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,794
He is right...

474
00:26:38,795 --> 00:26:41,030
What do you mean?

475
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:42,985
Ethan Tremblay is
my artistic name.

476
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:44,617
I am an actress.
-The art you?

477
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:46,100
What is your real name?

478
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:47,729
Ethan Chase. But it
sounds very artistic.

479
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,951
The Ethan Chase
sounds very artistic.

480
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:51,911
The Tremblay is miserable.
In a confusing,

481
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:53,871
it appears that
someone invented.

482
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:55,220
Yes, I invented it.

483
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:58,112
Ethan know that you invented.
It's your artistic name.

484
00:26:58,113 --> 00:27:01,725
Why did you give my wife to
send money to your artistic name?

485
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:05,109
I did not think. Trying
to connect to my new name.

486
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,636
Guys, want to talk it out.

487
00:27:08,637 --> 00:27:12,637
Got something else on you
to write your real name?

488
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,926
Yes yes. I have my mind?

489
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:19,208
It has two names...

490
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:21,559
Fantastic.

491
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:26,603
What the hell is this?

492
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:27,296
It...

493
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:28,402
It's identity.

494
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:30,049
Is photo ID.

495
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,531
I can not accept.

496
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:32,881
Why?

497
00:27:32,882 --> 00:27:34,925
Why is a photo of yourself.

498
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:38,926
Anyone can make one and
write on it the name it wants.

499
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:41,843
Yes, but why get into all
this trouble for $ 500 only?

500
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:43,916
I do not know why. But I know
that it is likely that he did.

501
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:47,766
So now we have to call
my wife to mother to go...

502
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:51,767
back to the bank and send
money to send the correct name.

503
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:53,466
Exactly.

504
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:57,467
Only you have to do tomorrow,
they will finish in 5 minutes.

505
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,035
It is still 6.35, sir.

506
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:02,263
You're going to play my boss?
With checks what time I leave?

507
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,538
I say close to 5 minutes.

508
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,954
I booked the Tsilis
to be with my friends.

509
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:08,378
Have you booked?

510
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:13,615
If you think about it,
very smart thing to do.

511
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:16,909
What? I think if you
look at me so I fear?

512
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,443
Why not do your job eh Vlahos?

513
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:21,269
Do dreams palioaderfara.

514
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,425
Wait a minute.
Excuse me. Peter.

515
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:29,996
I apologize for my friend,
but we need the money...

516
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:33,393
go to Avenue A is present at
the birth of his firstborn child.

517
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:36,947
What a sweet story. You know who
I was when my daughter was born?

518
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:37,800
In Tsilis?

519
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:41,357
In Iraq. Call the
sergeant to tell me and...

520
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:43,973
dakryvrechti to your story?
will certainly upset...

521
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,434
Now in closing?
Will not be late too?

522
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:49,405
It is sarcastic,
Ethan. And shows us...

523
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:52,445
To understand that
is tough veteran.

524
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:55,070
Rather it is and half after
a bombing that took place...

525
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:56,986
How dare you?

526
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:58,548
Well you did.

527
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:00,396
Not going well...

528
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,962
Now you did for the good.

529
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:06,407
The fucked her?
I fucked her on?

530
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:08,883
Spit on your window.

531
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,255
Let go? -Yes.

532
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:13,052
Hey, buddy.

533
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:16,068
What you said to me just now?

534
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:18,191
Sorry I did not know...

535
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:21,135
Did not you know that I am
paralyzed? -That you are paralyzed.

536
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,340
But how can you know?

537
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:25,348
Indeed, how to know?
Sorry... You know?

538
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,944
That's my fault. I
had a very bad day.

539
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:29,410
The day you were ugly?

540
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:31,875
Just going to
deteriorate even further.

541
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:34,946
Better to hide it.

542
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:37,875
This must hurt.

543
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:40,045
Did I have good moves?

544
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,521
I'll fuck her for good.

545
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:47,076
This move I call cart

546
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:55,119
Wait a minute.

547
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,404
Where are you going?

548
00:29:57,405 --> 00:29:58,631
He called the police.

549
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:02,632
Fuck the police. Look.
Here comes the train.

550
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:09,932
It's time to finish... Tsilis
to go to and find my friends...

551
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:35,395
Are you okay my friend?

552
00:30:35,396 --> 00:30:37,530
Do not call me
that... A friend helps

553
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:39,228
his friend when the attack.

554
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:41,394
Peter man was paralyzed.

555
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:45,395
Please call me or Mr Peter Hyman,
and I'll call you Mr. Chase.

556
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:51,213
Unless, and this
identity card is fake.

557
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:54,744
Let's leave it better...
Neither actor you're not normal.

558
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:57,480
What does this mean?
What is a regular actor?

559
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:00,182
A true actor can
pretend a role.

560
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:02,355
Set... Give you a
scene to play... Hello.

561
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:03,727
No. I do not want...

562
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,264
Should...

563
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:08,217
Ok, I'm Julia Roberts

564
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:11,098
we're engaged and
you have cancer.

565
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,999
Notify me of what
happens to you.

566
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,613
Julia Roberts, as you know...

567
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:21,614
we are engaged...
I have cancer.

568
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:25,337
Terrible.

569
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:26,051
What?

570
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,630
Sorry, but this
is my criticism.

571
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:29,607
I thought it went very well.

572
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:31,741
No. I'll give you
another chance.

573
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:35,385
It's Sunday, a league, and
you're a career coach...

574
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:39,386
The group you are losing a lot
of points, storm the locker room,

575
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:43,076
and the way you dismiss the
world. It's all or nothing. Go.

576
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:45,417
I will not never
shot such a film.

577
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:49,418
Yet such a film is shot every
two years... Every two years.

578
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:58,255
Ok kids... We must go
out there and try too.

579
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:03,201
Pol. You do like chick out
there. Are you really f chick?

580
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:10,094
Jackson... Concentrate. Do
you sometimes bitch and you?

581
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:11,789
Let the little sabotage.

582
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,297
Your wife calling
and asks you to break.

583
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:16,417
The wife of a coach?

584
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:20,418
Yes, calling and
called divorce.

585
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:23,528
Drina Drina.

586
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,230
Yes?

587
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Children will take a while,
got my wife. He wants a divorce.

588
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:40,482
Love me... What
did you say? Not...

589
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:46,182
This is not a good time...

590
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:05,085
Once I lost my father. Do
not leave me and you now.

591
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:15,051
I do not want to be alone.
I miss you very much.

592
00:33:22,178 --> 00:33:24,810
I can not do that.

593
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,300
I got coke, and water...

594
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:58,651
All right. Thanks.

595
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:08,917
What is rain. -Do
not say anything...

596
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:12,647
I drove enough for
today. I sleep in the car.

597
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:18,809
And tomorrow we...

598
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,963
Tell me about your
father. What job did he do?

599
00:34:29,964 --> 00:34:32,910
Was the official
toll. -Seriously?

600
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:36,817
He had to do then with
people. He loved his job.

601
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:38,437
Every night he returned home,

602
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:41,944
and laughed at how long
was the tail of the chamber,

603
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:45,945
because he liked to talk
to anyone passing by.

604
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:50,579
You, your dad? Where is it?

605
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:54,721
I have no idea.

606
00:34:56,112 --> 00:34:57,934
When you saw him last time?

607
00:34:57,935 --> 00:35:00,285
1977.

608
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,155
Yes... I remember, came
to my room and said,

609
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:09,465
Peter I have a very
important job for you.

610
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:12,074
I want you to wake up
tomorrow morning at 5.30.

611
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:16,424
And I enjoyed so much,
why do not I ever asked...

612
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,900
do nothing. I did not
know if there even for him.

613
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:25,795
I was so happy.
I put the alarm

614
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:29,796
and almost did not sleep all night,
because then I looked at the time.

615
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:34,575
It's time I went in
his room, wake him up...

616
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,610
and I... smiled
for the first time.

617
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,256
But I saw that he packs his
bags were on the front door.

618
00:35:52,257 --> 00:35:56,257
The got put in
the car and left...

619
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,610
It was the last
time I saw him.

620
00:36:09,974 --> 00:36:12,702
It's so funny.

621
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:21,753
My dad would I ever
did that. With Lover.

622
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:41,644
What is that noise?

623
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:44,048
What noise?

624
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:48,398
He stopped now.

625
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,807
Please. Resumed.

626
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:54,502
Oh, that's me. Masturbate.

627
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,001
What Why?

628
00:36:56,002 --> 00:36:57,734
To catch a sleep.

629
00:36:57,735 --> 00:37:01,696
Stop it please...
I'm just beside you.

630
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:03,865
Close your eyes, Peter.

631
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:06,787
Is closed, but the noise...

632
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:09,138
Do a little patience.

633
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:13,374
How long does it take you?

634
00:37:14,008 --> 00:37:18,008
I do not know for now, but it
usually takes me 35 minutes.

635
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:21,408
So only?

636
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:34,318
Until your dog does.

637
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,793
Sunny. Stop.

638
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:42,358
Sunny, no. Stop it. Happy dog.

639
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:37,248
Come here. Aschimomoutro.

640
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:07,915
Try not to think
about. I had to do.

641
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:11,916
Please... It was
unbearable. Unbearable.

642
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,021
Shit. Damn.

643
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:49,485
Ok... Gathered here before
the Lord to kidepsoume...

644
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:54,781
someone who does not
even remember his name.

645
00:39:55,324 --> 00:39:58,679
In Chase, or some Tremblay.

646
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,680
Let rest in peace. Amen.

647
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:12,119
I would like to
tell you sir, how...

648
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,244
were you on the
edge of that highway.

649
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:18,589
You do not fault
anything. But your son...

650
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,934
is very difficult man
to traveling with him.

651
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,879
In fact I can not
understand why...

652
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,765
not the throttle while
he was a baby yet.

653
00:41:01,806 --> 00:41:04,866
Net. Have you
forgotten something?

654
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:09,124
No. I went to get
coffee and donuts.

655
00:41:11,197 --> 00:41:12,401
I thought you left me.

656
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:14,376
Not just went to get
breakfast to eat...

657
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:16,183
the road to save time.

658
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:17,635
And why did you let
the things I here?

659
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:20,281
Why is your property.

660
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,247
What you say makes sense.

661
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:27,942
Want to ride me?
-Yes. It's your turn.

662
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,175
Very good.

663
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:32,444
I'll put the thing behind you.

664
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:35,254
Come Sunny.

665
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:40,339
And I thought that there was
no way to let Peter here...

666
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,959
I know we had our disagreements,
but they will never leave me.

667
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,796
Of course not. Nor is my car.

668
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:48,340
Right.

669
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:50,524
Get in Sunny.

670
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:53,998
You know spent
a lot of my mind.

671
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,549
Why do you want
to travel alone?

672
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,684
Did you shower?

673
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,100
Yes.

674
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,101
You know, these places have very
good facilities with showers.

675
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:14,988
This coffee is hot.

676
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:17,379
Yes. It is hot coffee.

677
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,580
We passed the
Mississippi River?

678
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,954
We are in Texas...
The Mississippi was...

679
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:25,539
river that we had when
we were in Mississippi.

680
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,540
Too bad. It was a good
place to rest my father.

681
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:34,989
To throw the ashes in the
river... and to get to New Orleans.

682
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:39,205
I sleep a bit, okay?

683
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:43,069
My father loved jazz music,

684
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,519
and women's breasts.

685
00:42:47,363 --> 00:42:48,880
Snoring last night?

686
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:50,014
Yes.

687
00:42:50,015 --> 00:42:53,529
Sorry, I sleep deeply.
It is a condition...

688
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,170
You have heard that saying, he either
did not wake up with an earthquake?

689
00:42:57,171 --> 00:42:59,535
Happened to me once again to be
an earthquake and not wake up.

690
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,056
Also once slept at the time...

691
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:02,577
I took an interview for a job.

692
00:43:02,578 --> 00:43:05,518
I did not sleep at all last
night. I'll try to sleep now.

693
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,822
Then I had to masturbate,
because I and I...

694
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:12,170
a tremendous orgasm,
and slept like a baby.

695
00:44:12,645 --> 00:44:14,995
Get up.

696
00:44:15,214 --> 00:44:16,730
Ethan. Wake up.

697
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:19,081
Damn.

698
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:48,528
I do not feel my legs. My God.

699
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:57,392
What happened?

700
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:03,842
Please take a look
at the contract...

701
00:45:06,509 --> 00:45:09,579
How well, covered
by insurance.

702
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:19,213
Stay away from
me. -Are you okay?

703
00:45:19,214 --> 00:45:22,036
I'm okay? You look good?

704
00:45:22,037 --> 00:45:23,214
I have a broken hand

705
00:45:23,215 --> 00:45:26,681
Three cracked ribs and
7 stitches in my arm.

706
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,163
I made this for an
answer? No, I'm not well.

707
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:32,809
Peter, I am very sorry.
-This tells me nothing.

708
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,700
I ended ruin you, nor scratch.

709
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:37,268
Yes, but doctors
said that due to...

710
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:38,860
that was cool because
I slept deeply.

711
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:39,932
I told you sleep deeply...

712
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:42,273
Yes, tell me... But I
told you that doctors...

713
00:45:42,274 --> 00:45:44,481
that there is a catch
to sleep at the wheel?

714
00:45:44,482 --> 00:45:46,986
I tried to rest
my eyes for me.

715
00:45:46,987 --> 00:45:50,987
But the next time and
you, being more relaxed.

716
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,288
Who is he?

717
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:56,819
This is a true friend, came
to pick me up from Dallas.

718
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,109
Well, you sit in front.

719
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,039
No, no. It came to get
U.S., but with company.

720
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,415
Incidentally, I
was very pleased.

721
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:07,101
And I have my own
conscience, allow me...

722
00:46:07,102 --> 00:46:10,523
tell you why I
will not get us.

723
00:46:10,524 --> 00:46:12,752
It is because of you because
I was kicked out of...

724
00:46:12,753 --> 00:46:14,937
the plane and shot a cop...

725
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,291
It is because
as passive and...

726
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:20,094
I looked as a break in
the wood a paralyzed...

727
00:46:20,095 --> 00:46:22,914
And it is because
nearly kill me,

728
00:46:22,915 --> 00:46:25,432
the most important
week of my life...

729
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:28,979
I leave here, for a much
more important reason.

730
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,157
I hate what you
with all my soul.

731
00:46:32,158 --> 00:46:34,917
I've heard it,
and try to fix it.

732
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:38,300
Good. Now listen, too.
Do not go to Hollywood.

733
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:41,275
The streets are made of gold,

734
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:44,816
but from the corpses as
stupid as you think...

735
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:47,633
to go there and
catch the good...

736
00:46:47,634 --> 00:46:48,909
Try to avoid it.

737
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,099
That said Shakespeare.
Have you heard?

738
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,846
Yes I have heard. He
was a famous pirate.

739
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:56,207
Which incidentally
named Saixpirogeni.

740
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:59,611
'To give you a
friendly advice...

741
00:46:59,612 --> 00:47:03,612
Nobody calls it that Hollywood
did not make it there.

742
00:47:06,515 --> 00:47:08,371
This is news to me.

743
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:12,372
Sunny... Sure I will miss
you, old aschimomouriko shit.

744
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,550
In my 23 years never...

745
00:47:25,248 --> 00:47:28,299
Let's go apo'do...
-What the hell?

746
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,861
Thank you very
much for coming.

747
00:47:31,862 --> 00:47:33,532
It does nothing...
Who is he yelling?

748
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:36,119
None. Never a concern.
-Are you sure...

749
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,919
It is pure trouble.
-Shows very sad.

750
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:42,734
And spat and his dog.

751
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:46,735
The spat it out... I did
this because it irritated...

752
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:48,806
I'm good. Let's go. -What?
Will leave him there?

753
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:49,792
Trust me... I know what I do.

754
00:47:49,793 --> 00:47:51,492
Peter, I know how many years?

755
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,817
20 years.

756
00:47:52,818 --> 00:47:55,540
20 years... and believe me,
you do not want to play...

757
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:58,211
the karma when you
wait and child...

758
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:02,212
Do what it takes to solve the
misunderstanding that got him.

759
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:05,571
Trust me.

760
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:17,033
Hollywood, come here.

761
00:48:22,784 --> 00:48:25,506
You see what I can do?

762
00:48:27,612 --> 00:48:29,186
Relax a little.

763
00:48:29,187 --> 00:48:30,828
Are you ready to apologize?

764
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:32,436
What? 'De fuck. Let go.

765
00:48:32,437 --> 00:48:35,000
Pete. Relax.

766
00:48:36,364 --> 00:48:39,081
First of all I regret
that I spat the Sunny.

767
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,729
I did not understand
how to channel it.

768
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:45,730
If you come with me to LA
needs to put some rules.

769
00:48:45,828 --> 00:48:48,744
1st, if I make
even a question,

770
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:52,745
will skylovriso, so
do not do that. Got it?

771
00:48:53,072 --> 00:48:54,181
Yes

772
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:57,439
2nd, if you catch a
sleep for some reason

773
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,252
unless of course it is
night and you're in a bed

774
00:49:01,253 --> 00:49:03,434
I will eviscerate. Got it?

775
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:04,661
Yes...

776
00:49:04,662 --> 00:49:07,647
3rd, if you are allergic to
waffles, then do not eat waffles!

777
00:49:07,648 --> 00:49:10,598
Then, do not you go and a
restaurant that makes waffles!

778
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:12,310
Shut up! -Calm...

779
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:14,153
Take the things you,
Mr climb in the back!

780
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:15,003
Keep the Sunny.

781
00:49:15,004 --> 00:49:18,165
No! So grasp my hands
the dog would tear in two!

782
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:22,157
Make sure to go to a doctor
did it before worse...

783
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:41,846
...and due to the excluded
and the two fly from LA to

784
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:45,556
Are you serious? -Yes!
and then worsened...

785
00:49:45,557 --> 00:49:49,557
I think he has a problem!
It went soft in front of me?

786
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:53,944
What? Kidding me? -No,
really I say, he did!

787
00:49:56,856 --> 00:49:59,642
This ditch is in front of us?

788
00:50:00,596 --> 00:50:01,737
Yes!

789
00:50:01,738 --> 00:50:03,659
Would you...? -Absolutely!

790
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,660
Sanidose it!

791
00:50:13,034 --> 00:50:15,499
Ethan you are well?

792
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,624
Yes, what happened?

793
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,939
The next time you're
more relaxed...

794
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:27,315
He and the other way!
-Seriously? Come again.

795
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:39,648
We can get your car...

796
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:42,134
No problem... Anyway
I will have my truck.

797
00:50:42,135 --> 00:50:43,768
It will bring back the post...

798
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:46,375
There is no reason...
I'll be in LA Friday.

799
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,856
What would you do
in LA on Friday?

800
00:50:47,857 --> 00:50:50,546
We will not lose anything with
the birth of your baby man...

801
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,292
Too bad it does
cesarean Sarah.

802
00:50:54,293 --> 00:50:57,632
It was so perfect
body. Flawless!

803
00:50:57,633 --> 00:50:59,738
Who do you know
that we do caesarean?

804
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:02,432
He said the same! Want coffee?

805
00:51:02,433 --> 00:51:04,433
Yes!

806
00:51:09,552 --> 00:51:13,056
What happens?
-What do you mean?

807
00:51:13,057 --> 00:51:15,781
How has so many stories
to tell about your wife?

808
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:18,931
It was the old couple in college?
-Yes, but that was 20 years ago.

809
00:51:18,932 --> 00:51:20,968
Yes, but do not you see?

810
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:24,251
This guy is like podos-fairistis,
handsome, charming...

811
00:51:24,252 --> 00:51:25,195
They do not understand.

812
00:51:25,196 --> 00:51:28,010
He has beautiful hands!
You see his hands?

813
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:30,986
I think that something
is going on here...

814
00:51:31,115 --> 00:51:33,046
Darryl, we took this photo?

815
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:33,871
What?

816
00:51:33,872 --> 00:51:35,761
The photograph of Sarah.

817
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:39,762
When you remove it in
February. Not that we were told?

818
00:51:40,566 --> 00:51:43,389
Yes... He said that at
a meeting but did not...

819
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:47,390
...yes we were and started
to drink and methame...

820
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,458
...like the good old
days... Got a good woman...

821
00:51:51,643 --> 00:51:53,761
In February...

822
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:56,160
That is, before 9 months?

823
00:51:56,161 --> 00:51:57,859
There I told you
not to ask questions?

824
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,680
About 9 months...

825
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:05,423
Finally came to a name? Told
me you're just pushing it.

826
00:52:05,424 --> 00:52:08,036
She told you that? -Yes,
we talked via email.

827
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:10,685
You and the wife
You exchange email;

828
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:12,865
You exchange What else?

829
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:13,682
Ethan...

830
00:52:13,683 --> 00:52:15,424
Body fluids?

831
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:16,645
What say?

832
00:52:16,646 --> 00:52:20,492
I do not think...
-No... no...

833
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:23,409
Did you ejaculate? -What?

834
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,974
This happens when the
urine you are white.

835
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:29,975
Ok, I have a new rule...
Not allowed to say a word!

836
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,851
This coffee is terrible.
It has taste like cat feces.

837
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:35,557
I think it is very delicious.

838
00:52:35,558 --> 00:52:36,355
And you should!

839
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:40,180
Ended my own coffee,
used by your own.

840
00:52:43,486 --> 00:52:45,486
This was not the
coffee! It was the

841
00:52:45,487 --> 00:52:47,486
ashes of the dead
father who had put in!

842
00:52:50,427 --> 00:52:53,982
Throw him out! In mousato
and his dog... Throw them out!

843
00:52:53,983 --> 00:52:55,105
I understood...

844
00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:57,106
Take out.

845
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:05,707
My God! I'm so stupid!

846
00:53:11,717 --> 00:53:12,805
Where are the ashes?

847
00:53:12,806 --> 00:53:15,409
Calm down.

848
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,678
Where are the
ashes of my father?

849
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:18,558
Where?

850
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,510
They are there to show you.
Look there in the coffee maker.

851
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:25,511
Set the box, coffee maker...
Sit down to empty and it...

852
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:27,680
Chill...

853
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:36,159
You can relax?

854
00:53:45,015 --> 00:53:49,015
Never mind...
I'll gather myself.

855
00:54:34,684 --> 00:54:37,451
Sorry your father drank.

856
00:54:38,627 --> 00:54:40,824
Never mind...

857
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,818
Are you okay, surely?

858
00:54:43,819 --> 00:54:47,180
Yes, it's pretty crowded box.

859
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:49,074
The Darryl had
three cups of coffee

860
00:54:49,075 --> 00:54:53,057
thus should have left about
8 cups of my father here.

861
00:54:53,058 --> 00:54:55,058
Well...

862
00:54:58,986 --> 00:55:00,832
Fortunately he had good taste.

863
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:04,833
There was also bad...
Could full flavor...

864
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,619
He liked the coffee...

865
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:18,049
...and turned out
to be coffee...

866
00:55:18,995 --> 00:55:22,995
Circles that makes
life... -Do not discuss...

867
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:29,892
Restore your right
to ask questions.

868
00:55:29,933 --> 00:55:31,021
Yes?

869
00:55:31,022 --> 00:55:33,218
Start it!

870
00:55:35,283 --> 00:55:37,286
How is your arm?
-Not too bad...

871
00:55:37,287 --> 00:55:39,888
Do you think that Darryl
slept with your wife?

872
00:55:39,889 --> 00:55:41,102
No.

873
00:55:41,103 --> 00:55:42,433
I think so.

874
00:55:42,434 --> 00:55:46,434
Then why would you lend this
beautiful car and so much money...

875
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:52,112
Why is my friend. So!

876
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:55,197
Have you ever been
to a zoo in San Diego?

877
00:55:55,198 --> 00:55:57,221
I also have a
question for you...

878
00:55:57,222 --> 00:56:00,669
How I came to do
the last 3 questions?

879
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,610
I thought your
wife and Darryl,

880
00:56:02,611 --> 00:56:05,058
and that may have
left the pregnant...

881
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:07,482
If so would like
their child as zebra...

882
00:56:07,483 --> 00:56:10,046
Then I thought that I have
ever seen in my life... zebra

883
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:12,826
and that it might be a
good idea to go to the zoo

884
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,112
San Diego when we
come to California.

885
00:56:15,113 --> 00:56:16,887
No! I've never
been to the zoo.

886
00:56:16,888 --> 00:56:19,027
Next question please.

887
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:23,166
Honey, are you a
faithful husband.

888
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:26,266
I call the West Texas...

889
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:30,267
Did the other line
talking with Darryl?

890
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:33,580
Or rather...

891
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:35,581
Tell me more
about the wonderful

892
00:56:35,582 --> 00:56:37,581
tokyriako Savva, who
spent in San Diego...

893
00:56:38,234 --> 00:56:40,058
It must be very well spent...

894
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:44,059
So now all the email
go to mend things...

895
00:56:47,396 --> 00:56:51,067
If there is something you want
to tell me before it's too late

896
00:56:51,068 --> 00:56:54,043
and find myself surprised
at the room of confinement

897
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:56,950
would greatly appreciate
it if you erased all...

898
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:58,951
Call me!

899
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:03,592
I was right or
wrong? -For what?

900
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:07,519
For Darryl, your wife and
the mysterious baby...?

901
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,243
Asleep and left a message...

902
00:57:10,269 --> 00:57:14,269
Fret when you
mention this issue,

903
00:57:14,592 --> 00:57:18,592
and would greatly
appreciate it if you did...

904
00:57:19,153 --> 00:57:21,331
I bought something to snack
on foods... -Yes I saw it.

905
00:57:21,332 --> 00:57:23,945
I want to drive
because I can not...

906
00:57:23,946 --> 00:57:27,863
I took vicodin and does not
make drivers under the influence.

907
00:57:27,868 --> 00:57:31,868
But so hang on just your
eyes or make it sleep,

908
00:57:33,278 --> 00:57:36,872
I will strangle
you with your scarf.

909
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,037
I wrap the scarf around
your neck and strangle you.

910
00:57:40,038 --> 00:57:42,038
I promise.

911
00:57:43,362 --> 00:57:46,499
It is not too extreme?
-Take off your glasses.

912
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,888
Once I bought! I want
to wear it for awhile.

913
00:57:48,889 --> 00:57:50,575
It's night and a driver.

914
00:57:50,576 --> 00:57:53,056
You do not like you ever
crash into your life!

915
00:57:53,057 --> 00:57:55,869
Take off! -Well!

916
00:57:57,346 --> 00:57:58,993
Soda is this?

917
00:57:58,994 --> 00:58:00,020
Drink up!

918
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:01,984
You're not my boss!

919
00:58:01,985 --> 00:58:03,985
Drink up!

920
00:58:11,422 --> 00:58:13,422
Well done... nice guy!

921
00:58:18,743 --> 00:58:22,743
Incidentally, only
once slept at the wheel!

922
00:58:23,178 --> 00:58:25,913
I'm a big guy, I'm an adult!

923
00:58:25,914 --> 00:58:28,693
I remembered to go to the
bathroom before we leave?

924
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:32,243
These are nice.

925
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:38,032
The windows do not work!

926
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:42,033
Block them to stay in
the air to mastouroso...

927
00:59:48,432 --> 00:59:50,712
I mastourosei too?

928
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:53,274
Do you feel stoned?

929
01:00:54,598 --> 01:00:57,128
And then what happened?
How to find a solution?

930
01:00:57,129 --> 01:01:01,129
It turned out that the cheese
grater was under the mattress.

931
01:01:03,795 --> 01:01:06,735
It's so refined and
so full of meaning...

932
01:01:06,736 --> 01:01:08,005
Yes... It is very meaningful.

933
01:01:08,006 --> 01:01:10,360
How do you know this
for the serial...

934
01:01:10,361 --> 01:01:14,234
I manage an unofficial site for
the series made the last 6 years.

935
01:01:14,235 --> 01:01:18,235
It all started from an internet
cafe I went to wash my feet.

936
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:20,916
What is the name of the site;

937
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:24,574
It srainingtwoandahalfmen.com

938
01:01:25,889 --> 01:01:27,259
This is exquisite.

939
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,316
I want to revoke the honorary
sub-reviews I did for you.

940
01:01:30,317 --> 01:01:32,659
I thank you very much Peter.

941
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:33,942
Give me a prawn.

942
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:35,943
Yes.

943
01:01:36,707 --> 01:01:38,446
Thank you.

944
01:01:38,447 --> 01:01:40,511
Give one and Sunny.

945
01:01:45,114 --> 01:01:48,041
We continue to be a freeway?

946
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:50,134
Peter Relax, and let me!

947
01:01:50,135 --> 01:01:51,593
Are you sure?

948
01:01:51,594 --> 01:01:55,539
You become paranoid. In
affected more grass...

949
01:01:55,724 --> 01:01:59,724
Just see a sign that
says Mexico border.

950
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,043
Oh my God...

951
01:02:03,044 --> 01:02:03,921
What?

952
01:02:03,922 --> 01:02:07,780
I thought that it wrote Texaco!
I wanted to stop for petrol!

953
01:02:07,781 --> 01:02:11,332
Do not worry, no
problem. We're fine.

954
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:12,841
What would you do?
What would you say?

955
01:02:12,842 --> 01:02:14,955
I'll go there and tell
them that we made a mistake

956
01:02:14,956 --> 01:02:17,533
and would ask that we
reverse and go back.

957
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:18,436
Perfect.

958
01:02:18,437 --> 01:02:22,437
I can not talk,
sit straight...

959
01:02:22,664 --> 01:02:25,349
We will not be suspect if you
ask something and not respond?

960
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,674
'At all on me...

961
01:02:26,675 --> 01:02:28,362
Leave them all over you...

962
01:02:28,363 --> 01:02:30,527
The policeman looks.

963
01:02:30,528 --> 01:02:32,973
Peter please, hush.

964
01:02:36,636 --> 01:02:39,991
Hello. Something
strange happened... go...

965
01:02:39,992 --> 01:02:43,432
Are you a U.S.
citizen? -Yes we are.

966
01:02:43,433 --> 01:02:45,761
Both of you? -Yes, of course!

967
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,762
Can I see your passports? -We
do not have passports on us.

968
01:02:50,247 --> 01:02:53,651
Something strange happened...
did not want to rthoume here...

969
01:02:53,652 --> 01:02:57,157
We got to a wrong
turn at some point...

970
01:02:57,158 --> 01:03:00,322
I can do a reversal
and go back to the U.S.?

971
01:03:00,323 --> 01:03:02,044
Want to Flip?

972
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:05,506
Yes, as I said, I made a
mistake... We try to go...

973
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:08,263
What is your friend?

974
01:03:08,871 --> 01:03:10,282
Peter stop...

975
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:13,715
Why shine your
eyes? You did drugs?

976
01:03:13,716 --> 01:03:15,662
No. I have glaucoma.

977
01:03:15,663 --> 01:03:19,384
And your friend is glaucoma?

978
01:03:20,334 --> 01:03:22,335
You have glaucoma?

979
01:03:22,336 --> 01:03:24,319
No, not glaucoma.

980
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,320
And the dog? This also
has, why his eyes shine.

981
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:33,871
Turn off the car
and give me the keys.

982
01:03:36,953 --> 01:03:39,338
Wait here.

983
01:03:42,678 --> 01:03:45,824
We have a problem? -No.
Everything will be okay.

984
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:50,658
Give me please the Sunny.

985
01:03:51,944 --> 01:03:55,350
If you ask me
something, I'll wet!

986
01:03:55,351 --> 01:03:58,043
Can you give me and the box
with the ashes of my father?

987
01:03:58,044 --> 01:04:01,977
What are you doing?

988
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,703
I said I took a wrong exit
and ended up here accidentally.

989
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:22,057
Many times to ask me,
this will tell you.

990
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,127
Reminds me of Jason Vourne.

991
01:04:24,128 --> 01:04:27,678
You know you go...
You have no identity...

992
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:30,000
I would like to talk to
the American consulate.

993
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:31,748
I am American
and I have rights.

994
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:32,889
Immediately. -Thanks...

995
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:36,359
Pedro wants to speak
with the consulate.

996
01:04:40,534 --> 01:04:43,065
Hello! Here,
American Consulate,

997
01:04:43,066 --> 01:04:44,964
What can I do for you?

998
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:47,147
This is unacceptable.

999
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:52,527
Why laugh? The issue is
serious. I have rights.

1000
01:04:52,528 --> 01:04:55,131
You Americans come
illegally in our country

1001
01:04:55,132 --> 01:04:58,125
buying drugs and having
fun with our women.

1002
01:04:58,126 --> 01:05:01,073
I have never heard of American
entering illegally into Mexico.

1003
01:05:01,074 --> 01:05:04,095
Usually the opposite.

1004
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:08,411
I'm tired of
listening to bullshit.

1005
01:05:09,102 --> 01:05:13,102
Attempted to pass drugs
across international borders.

1006
01:05:14,567 --> 01:05:17,386
Things are very serious.

1007
01:05:56,597 --> 01:05:59,953
Ok... Sunny Sit there.

1008
01:06:20,304 --> 01:06:22,304
Shit!

1009
01:06:42,803 --> 01:06:44,803
Stop!

1010
01:06:48,632 --> 01:06:50,632
Help!

1011
01:07:15,671 --> 01:07:16,946
Step aside.

1012
01:07:16,947 --> 01:07:18,947
What the hell?

1013
01:07:20,024 --> 01:07:21,621
Take your car to the edge!

1014
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,833
I do not speak English!

1015
01:07:27,072 --> 01:07:29,949
Sunny Hang! It
difficult things!

1016
01:08:04,388 --> 01:08:06,388
Ethan?

1017
01:08:07,011 --> 01:08:09,011
Wait!

1018
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,776
Oh my God! Peter!

1019
01:08:32,777 --> 01:08:34,777
Peter are you okay?

1020
01:08:42,377 --> 01:08:44,607
With what speed you go?

1021
01:08:44,608 --> 01:08:47,220
I'm not sure... In
60 miles I guess.

1022
01:08:47,246 --> 01:08:51,141
I had no idea I was
going... And then I see you.

1023
01:08:51,178 --> 01:08:53,505
But again did not
look very familiar...

1024
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:55,022
I know... In
recognition of his eyes?

1025
01:08:55,023 --> 01:08:56,063
It looked totally insane!

1026
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:59,209
I know! So I put the
scarf on and my hair...

1027
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:02,320
You were like a commando!
As an Indian warrior!

1028
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:04,321
Thanks.

1029
01:09:10,538 --> 01:09:13,313
This will be your
new photography.

1030
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,415
I fit perfectly!

1031
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,863
It hurts too much!

1032
01:09:18,959 --> 01:09:21,703
I then give them to me? -Yes

1033
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,981
Take it easy. Do not overdo.

1034
01:09:26,982 --> 01:09:30,764
Rescue! A daring rescue!

1035
01:09:31,059 --> 01:09:33,638
Came back to me! -Yes I did!

1036
01:09:33,639 --> 01:09:34,746
That was perfect!

1037
01:09:34,747 --> 01:09:36,312
Yes... After I
told! In promised.

1038
01:09:36,313 --> 01:09:40,313
I told you that I will
return home safe and I will.

1039
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:42,903
I'll kiss you. -What?

1040
01:09:42,904 --> 01:09:45,582
I'll give you a kiss. -No...

1041
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:48,542
Without saying
anything... Stop Peter.

1042
01:09:49,313 --> 01:09:51,313
Aidiaaa!

1043
01:09:51,998 --> 01:09:54,797
You have many variations
at your disposal.

1044
01:09:54,798 --> 01:09:55,878
I owe you buddy.

1045
01:09:55,879 --> 01:09:59,879
There was no way to have seen
my child if you do not save.

1046
01:09:59,979 --> 01:10:02,250
I love you man...

1047
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:06,738
And I love you Peter.

1048
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:21,625
My God...

1049
01:10:22,443 --> 01:10:26,088
Honey, I ask forgiveness.

1050
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:29,665
You know when I get jealous.

1051
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:32,566
But I told you that
I had met down there.

1052
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:36,567
I know. It has nothing to
do with you. But with me.

1053
01:10:36,881 --> 01:10:40,424
'Köse me. Do not say anything,
just listened for awhile.

1054
01:10:40,425 --> 01:10:44,099
There will never betray
Peter. You know that.

1055
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,130
We are a family.

1056
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:49,939
Nothing else
matters. The right?

1057
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:51,443
You're right.

1058
01:10:51,444 --> 01:10:53,938
Come back home please.

1059
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:56,759
I love you baby.
-And I love you.

1060
01:11:21,116 --> 01:11:24,584
Ethan wake up.

1061
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:46,046
I wanted to rectify.

1062
01:11:46,161 --> 01:11:48,182
I was sure that
the people dug that.

1063
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:52,043
No! It is very old,
and became over time.

1064
01:11:52,044 --> 01:11:54,163
So is the Grand Canyon. Sure.

1065
01:11:54,164 --> 01:11:56,602
Peter I have photographic
memory, and I remember that...

1066
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:59,876
Ethan, please be outdated.
Is the Grand Canyon.

1067
01:11:59,877 --> 01:12:02,213
It is the Hoover Dam...

1068
01:12:02,214 --> 01:12:05,955
I know that the Hoover
Dam built by the pilgrims.

1069
01:12:05,956 --> 01:12:07,927
And here you are wrong.

1070
01:12:07,928 --> 01:12:10,950
It is a magnificent time.

1071
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,580
There was no need to stop.

1072
01:12:12,581 --> 01:12:15,452
Never mind. It is a
perfect place anyway...

1073
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:19,393
Better to go... Can I
do this one another time.

1074
01:12:19,394 --> 01:12:22,207
We have a long time. We anticipate
to get to LA in the morning.

1075
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:23,521
Relax.

1076
01:12:23,522 --> 01:12:25,969
I think we should
follow the plan...

1077
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:29,125
I thought it was
part of the plan...

1078
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:32,034
What I do not understand?

1079
01:12:32,035 --> 01:12:34,550
Ethan, what happens?

1080
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:38,230
Because when I said that it will
stop at the Grand Canyon, you said,

1081
01:12:38,231 --> 01:12:39,887
Too bad it would be perfect...

1082
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,241
And when I said that we had
already passed in Mississippi, said

1083
01:12:42,242 --> 01:12:45,622
Too bad, my dad loved jazz
music and the female breasts.

1084
01:12:45,927 --> 01:12:48,917
We have many things to do,
and do not want to delay.

1085
01:12:48,918 --> 01:12:51,009
I know it's hard
to say goodbye...

1086
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:54,058
I did not know your father,
but from what I said,

1087
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:57,092
must have been very good man.

1088
01:12:58,377 --> 01:13:02,377
Just say you and I suggest...

1089
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:07,179
If you have the power to do
this great act... He deserves it.

1090
01:13:26,097 --> 01:13:28,097
Come here Sunny.

1091
01:13:50,195 --> 01:13:52,923
Dad, I stood like a father.

1092
01:13:56,174 --> 01:14:00,174
And I do not know how
to handle it without you.

1093
01:14:05,295 --> 01:14:09,295
But I know I'll
watch from up there.

1094
01:14:14,767 --> 01:14:17,646
Dad will make you proud.

1095
01:14:20,448 --> 01:14:22,602
I promise.

1096
01:14:24,741 --> 01:14:28,741
I love you. Hello to my mom.

1097
01:14:49,332 --> 01:14:51,332
Goodbye Dad.

1098
01:15:01,739 --> 01:15:05,739
It was fishy man. I
adored him. It was like me.

1099
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:15,621
I would like to tell you something
that I did feel very bad about it.

1100
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:20,601
I have weight on my chest.

1101
01:15:24,141 --> 01:15:26,986
In walked the attitude
we had in Louisiana.

1102
01:15:26,987 --> 01:15:27,798
What?

1103
01:15:27,799 --> 01:15:31,799
I did not intend to
go... It was my mistake.

1104
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:35,059
Why did you do that?

1105
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:39,060
Why am I a pig and an
asshole, but I try to fix it.

1106
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:43,548
You know something? But
returned with donuts.

1107
01:15:43,549 --> 01:15:47,549
That says a lot more about you
than the fact that he left us.

1108
01:15:49,643 --> 01:15:52,613
You're something
else! Thank you.

1109
01:15:56,508 --> 01:15:59,355
He left a weight off me.

1110
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,845
Is there anything I
can draw from me too.

1111
01:16:02,846 --> 01:16:04,846
Tell me.

1112
01:16:05,866 --> 01:16:09,094
I'm not actually 23 years old.

1113
01:16:09,771 --> 01:16:13,771
I know. Never mind.

1114
01:16:14,546 --> 01:16:17,132
And the other is...

1115
01:16:18,983 --> 01:16:22,983
Peter, I have your wallet, and
then I had from the beginning.

1116
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:28,585
What? What do you mean?

1117
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:34,544
Peter listen.

1118
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:37,864
Why did you do that?

1119
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:41,262
I saw the plane, and did
not want to be myself.

1120
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:44,942
I was very sensitive because
of the death of my father.

1121
01:16:44,962 --> 01:16:48,940
I did not want to
cross the country alone.

1122
01:16:49,868 --> 01:16:51,818
Is all here. -Yes.

1123
01:16:51,819 --> 01:16:54,927
All the money
and all my cards.

1124
01:16:56,073 --> 01:17:00,073
Everything I
needed those days.

1125
01:17:05,402 --> 01:17:09,402
Are you okay? -Go
past... What to do?

1126
01:17:13,751 --> 01:17:17,751
All right. Thank you
Peter. Let's start then.

1127
01:17:21,769 --> 01:17:25,497
Get you in Sunny, and lead me.

1128
01:17:25,498 --> 01:17:27,620
I'll kill you.

1129
01:17:33,644 --> 01:17:35,644
Peter!

1130
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:42,707
Ringing your phone.

1131
01:17:48,358 --> 01:17:50,282
Hello, darling.
-Peter came hours.

1132
01:17:50,283 --> 01:17:54,010
What? -You will not
believe it, my water broke.

1133
01:17:54,011 --> 01:17:56,567
How? -Who are you?

1134
01:17:56,568 --> 01:18:00,568
At the Grand Canyon, come.
-What? Told the Grand Canyon?

1135
01:18:05,757 --> 01:18:09,757
Mom, is in the
Grand Canyon. -Oh...

1136
01:18:10,003 --> 01:18:12,491
Who was it? -My
wife gives birth.

1137
01:18:12,492 --> 01:18:15,253
I thought I would do a
caesarean! -Get in the car.

1138
01:18:17,404 --> 01:18:21,284
I speak as if...
Well well... Let's go.

1139
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:40,266
You will not succeed.

1140
01:18:40,267 --> 01:18:42,936
Perfect, will miss
the birth of my child.

1141
01:18:42,937 --> 01:18:46,937
I manage to get! -Do not say
we get, we're not together.

1142
01:18:50,446 --> 01:18:52,477
First, in the future...
-No, I am first.

1143
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,612
Can I speak? -No you can not.

1144
01:18:54,613 --> 01:18:56,384
I told you I will break out...

1145
01:18:56,385 --> 01:19:00,385
I admit that I have a problem,
and I regret that I broke on you.

1146
01:19:00,671 --> 01:19:02,671
But I warned you.

1147
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,139
Sorry. -Okay.

1148
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:10,140
But in the future, if you go
out as friends and quarrel...

1149
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:15,120
Do not hit in the face, do
you know what I make my bread.

1150
01:19:16,646 --> 01:19:20,646
Even bleed. -Look in the
glove box for pharmacy.

1151
01:19:22,307 --> 01:19:25,044
Clean up a little yourself.

1152
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:28,993
What is that thing?

1153
01:19:37,783 --> 01:19:39,977
He threw...

1154
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:50,090
I can not believe I did
that! Sorry Peter. Sorry.

1155
01:19:51,215 --> 01:19:54,068
I did not know that it is full.
I am ashamed so much. Stop.

1156
01:19:54,069 --> 01:19:58,069
No. I will continue, not
stop. -Peter step aside.

1157
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:02,890
Why? -I am in shock!

1158
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:14,647
Do not panic!

1159
01:20:27,872 --> 01:20:29,622
Oh no... -Yes.

1160
01:20:29,623 --> 01:20:32,322
Here it is. -I am very sorry.

1161
01:20:32,323 --> 01:20:34,208
Do not worry, we must
stop the bleeding.

1162
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:35,687
Come a little,
you get the scarf.

1163
01:20:35,688 --> 01:20:39,688
To get back? -What the hell
are you? Come I told you!

1164
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:42,026
Come, do not move.

1165
01:20:42,027 --> 01:20:46,027
Okay, I have. I want to
tie, I have only one hand...

1166
01:20:47,533 --> 01:20:51,533
Peter, I have to go to hospital.
-No hospital will get well.

1167
01:20:52,383 --> 01:20:56,383
My God, what have
I done! -Stop.

1168
01:20:56,694 --> 01:20:57,176
Listen a bit!

1169
01:20:57,177 --> 01:21:00,705
Let's do an exercise in
acting as we do in the toilet.

1170
01:21:00,706 --> 01:21:04,422
You're a sergeant and a
soldier I got my promised...

1171
01:21:04,423 --> 01:21:07,656
that you will come
back soo to my beloved.

1172
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:14,554
Perfect.

1173
01:21:17,901 --> 01:21:21,750
Peter vomit...
-It's OK buddy...

1174
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:24,541
But to drive.

1175
01:21:31,188 --> 01:21:34,975
Soldier! Sit in the back seat!

1176
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:38,213
Do you like
gkomenoula! -Perfect!

1177
01:21:38,214 --> 01:21:40,775
Do you like? -Yes, go.

1178
01:22:18,963 --> 01:22:21,292
Finally decided?
-How to decide?

1179
01:22:21,293 --> 01:22:23,763
Your son will be born,
how would you name him?

1180
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:26,055
I know just to see him. -What
do you think about Sunny?

1181
01:22:26,056 --> 01:22:29,290
We will not give my child
a name my dog masturbates!

1182
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:32,082
Do not listen to
Sunny. Depths loves you!

1183
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:34,083
Sunny, no!

1184
01:22:34,194 --> 01:22:36,813
Sunny... Sorry!

1185
01:22:36,814 --> 01:22:39,164
Return home!

1186
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:56,682
I did it!

1187
01:23:00,295 --> 01:23:02,551
The monkey!

1188
01:23:04,578 --> 01:23:06,829
Sunny, we return immediately.

1189
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:08,830
I got it.

1190
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,732
I have a future
father! Where do we go?

1191
01:23:23,637 --> 01:23:27,418
Shit! I forgot to leave the
window open to get air by Sunny.

1192
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,518
The car has no door, Ethan!

1193
01:23:29,519 --> 01:23:32,744
See? When working,
it gets us nothing!

1194
01:23:36,771 --> 01:23:38,940
Okay, go here.

1195
01:23:41,907 --> 01:23:44,502
Let soulouposoume
a bit. -Good.

1196
01:23:44,503 --> 01:23:47,053
Sit draw the eye.

1197
01:23:50,911 --> 01:23:54,340
Wear the vest to
hide the blood...

1198
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:03,006
I told you how much
I like your perm?

1199
01:24:03,007 --> 01:24:06,761
Thanks Peter!
Look who came back?

1200
01:24:07,223 --> 01:24:09,544
Sarah!

1201
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:14,252
Come here. Hello ma'am.

1202
01:24:14,658 --> 01:24:17,704
Hide handcuffs! Put the
handcuffs in your pocket!

1203
01:24:17,705 --> 01:24:19,705
Take the monkey.

1204
01:24:20,672 --> 01:24:22,017
Keep pushing.

1205
01:24:22,018 --> 01:24:24,843
Sarah? -Peter?

1206
01:24:24,844 --> 01:24:26,696
I hear? -Go!

1207
01:24:26,697 --> 01:24:29,375
Peter! -Sarah?

1208
01:24:32,659 --> 01:24:35,799
Darryl? What the hell?

1209
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,750
Who is he?

1210
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:39,607
I do not know! We must go out!

1211
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:41,179
Peter!

1212
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,180
From here.

1213
01:24:45,792 --> 01:24:47,596
Baby, you came.

1214
01:24:47,597 --> 01:24:49,563
Jeez, Peter, are you okay?

1215
01:24:49,564 --> 01:24:51,812
Yes, you just
lost some blood...

1216
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:56,974
Calm down everyone please!
We need to find a hospital.

1217
01:24:56,975 --> 01:24:58,051
Who are you?

1218
01:24:58,052 --> 01:25:00,749
My name is Ethan Tremblay and I'm
the best friend of your husband.

1219
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:01,855
Nice to meet you.

1220
01:25:01,856 --> 01:25:05,197
Also! Now! Let's pull
this baby from your vagina!

1221
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:07,198
All right.

1222
01:25:07,848 --> 01:25:10,350
Get away!

1223
01:25:13,838 --> 01:25:17,838
Look at the babies!
Look at this baby!

1224
01:25:22,714 --> 01:25:24,669
Look at your baby!

1225
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:26,780
Show me, show me!

1226
01:25:28,136 --> 01:25:30,486
It's very cute!

1227
01:25:30,487 --> 01:25:32,255
It's very nice boy!

1228
01:25:32,256 --> 01:25:33,844
It girl.

1229
01:25:33,845 --> 01:25:34,792
No.

1230
01:25:34,793 --> 01:25:37,976
Yes. Dr. Greene
says it has happened.

1231
01:25:37,977 --> 01:25:41,496
The ultrasounds are
not 100% reliable.

1232
01:25:41,497 --> 01:25:43,258
Our little Rosie!

1233
01:25:43,259 --> 01:25:44,942
Rosie?

1234
01:25:44,943 --> 01:25:48,705
Rosie Hyman... Do
not you hear strange?

1235
01:25:48,706 --> 01:25:50,357
No. It's a beautiful name!

1236
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:52,805
Sarah said that you liked you.

1237
01:25:52,806 --> 01:25:54,113
When you talked to Sarah?

1238
01:25:54,114 --> 01:25:56,199
We talked after I cut
the umbilical cord.

1239
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,502
You cut him?

1240
01:25:57,503 --> 01:26:01,503
The living link between
mother and child.

1241
01:26:01,746 --> 01:26:02,899
I cut him.

1242
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,898
No.

1243
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:04,821
Yes.

1244
01:26:04,822 --> 01:26:05,674
You?

1245
01:26:05,675 --> 01:26:08,746
I kept a little and
put it in my wallet.

1246
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:12,549
It's good if you
hurt your ankles.

1247
01:26:14,398 --> 01:26:16,447
My God!

1248
01:26:18,109 --> 01:26:19,783
Ethan, I had dreamed it!

1249
01:26:19,784 --> 01:26:21,005
It's crazy...

1250
01:26:21,006 --> 01:26:25,006
I saw a strange dream about the
current day, where there was a bear...

1251
01:26:26,761 --> 01:26:27,778
What?

1252
01:26:27,779 --> 01:26:31,765
And the bear was cut with the
teeth of the umbilical cord.

1253
01:26:31,766 --> 01:26:33,779
If you think the
dream came true...

1254
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:35,899
You understand what I mean?
-I do not got it... What.?

1255
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:39,900
Forget it... Must
be a good sign.

1256
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:50,371
Better to leave you
with your family.

1257
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:53,374
I go to meet an agent.

1258
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,498
Oh, yes! It's Friday.

1259
01:26:55,499 --> 01:26:59,499
I wanted to give you that. Do
you have any information for me.

1260
01:27:03,187 --> 01:27:07,187
If you ever need
someone to babysitting...

1261
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:10,411
You will have an opportunity.

1262
01:27:14,941 --> 01:27:17,600
The last days were
completely crazy!

1263
01:27:17,601 --> 01:27:19,119
Yes, crazy!

1264
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:22,366
We must do it again.
Xanadiaschisoume To America.

1265
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:24,239
Okay...

1266
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,522
Call me tomorrow to say.

1267
01:27:26,523 --> 01:27:27,515
If I can not...

1268
01:27:27,516 --> 01:27:29,302
Call me tomorrow to say.

1269
01:27:29,303 --> 01:27:31,890
Can I send email. Do
not get it wrong...

1270
01:27:31,891 --> 01:27:35,171
No, no! A playground
is the email.

1271
01:27:36,161 --> 01:27:37,505
Say hi, Sunny.

1272
01:27:37,506 --> 01:27:39,662
Would you mind if me and
Sunny were taking the van?

1273
01:27:39,663 --> 01:27:41,705
No, free.

1274
01:27:42,268 --> 01:27:44,163
I was very happy Peter.

1275
01:27:44,164 --> 01:27:46,341
...And not only...

1276
01:27:51,768 --> 01:27:53,768
Thanks.

1277
01:28:01,913 --> 01:28:05,913
Ethan? Welcome to Hollywood.

1278
01:28:06,926 --> 01:28:09,168
What? You want to
come back to talk?

1279
01:28:09,169 --> 01:28:13,169
No, just a welcome
from the city!

1280
01:28:14,824 --> 01:28:17,401
Make sure you
call me tomorrow.

1281
01:28:18,618 --> 01:28:20,787
I'll call you.

1282
01:28:29,932 --> 01:28:31,932
I come!

1283
01:28:35,654 --> 01:28:37,654
Please?

1284
01:28:38,472 --> 01:28:40,974
Hello, I'm Stu professor.

1285
01:28:40,975 --> 01:28:42,026
Are you Jake?

1286
01:28:42,027 --> 01:28:44,625
No, I'm the father.

1287
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:48,973
A... Stu I am a teacher.

1288
01:28:48,974 --> 01:28:52,223
Indeed... Do you smoke grass?

1289
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:56,224
No Sir! You smell of my cat.

1290
01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:00,182
Your cat?

1291
01:29:00,183 --> 01:29:01,687
Yes...

1292
01:29:01,688 --> 01:29:04,318
You're right.
It is very funny!

1293
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:07,488
Do not go mad. I told you
that the series made it funny.

1294
01:29:07,489 --> 01:29:09,649
Come after the worship!

1295
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:13,650
Survived the hands
of... a big difference.

1296
01:29:14,055 --> 01:29:16,977
Charlie, here the
professor Jake, Stu.

1297
01:29:17,209 --> 01:29:19,752
I'm not stoned man...
My cat is to blame.

1298
01:29:20,450 --> 01:29:22,943
Stu Relax, we're
not policemen.

1299
01:29:24,336 --> 01:29:25,739
As the clock.

1300
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:28,248
I told him to call after
seeing the whole episode.

1301
01:29:28,249 --> 01:29:30,323
It revolutionized!

1302
01:29:30,477 --> 01:29:33,553
If you tell our daughter
the name, you freak!

1303
01:29:35,844 --> 01:29:39,757
...Again no thanks.

1304
01:29:41,296 --> 01:29:43,474
Do you have a
little more grass?

1305
01:29:43,497 --> 01:29:47,118
If you pay me $ 9
an hour, I have not!

1306
01:29:47,143 --> 01:29:50,176
E... I wanted to say that I have
no idea what you talking about!

1307
