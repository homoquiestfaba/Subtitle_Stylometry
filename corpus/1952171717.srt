1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,780
You'll pay me $10,000 up front

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,599
and another ten grand
when the job's done.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,790
On the day
I finish our contract,

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,690
a dozen white roses will be sent
to your office.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,989
 <i>Don't attempt to contact me.</i>

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,179
 <i>If you need to communicate,</i>
 <i>go to the steps</i>

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,600
 <i>at the main entrance</i>
 <i>of the Central Post Office.</i>

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,960
3:00 in the afternoon,
I'll find you.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,330
This meeting will be
the last time you'll see me.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,380
Once you pay me,
changing your mind is

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,710
 <i>a complication</i>
 <i>that's going to cost you.</i>

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,850
 <i>So I got to ask you</i>
 <i>one more time.</i>

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,220
 <i>Are you sure you want him dead?</i>

14
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,290
All right, let's go.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,460
Come on, keep it moving.

16
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,430
Buy you a cup of
coffee, Mr. Neville?

17
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,340
Do I know you?

18
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,010
Detective Mac Taylor.

19
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,290
I was called to the
scene of the accident.

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,860
I don't remember.

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,020
I've tried to contact you
several times since then.

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,299
You refused my calls,
wouldn't allow me to visit,

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,400
so you left me no choice
but to be here today.

24
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,550
And now you're here?

25
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,940
I was wondering
if we could talk.

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,990
Why?

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,690
Because you just spent 18 months in prison
for a crime you didn't commit.

28

31
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,450
Adam,have you seen Danny?

32
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,190
He left about 20 minutes ago with Doc to 
a crime scene on the Upper West Side.

33
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,059
What about, uh,
Stella or Mac?

34
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,259
Stella's in court
and the boss took a day off.

35
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,720
Yeah, can you believe it?

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,799
Mac never takes
a day off.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,839
I don't think
there's been one day

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,189
since I've worked here
that he hasn't showed up.

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,000
He's like,
"Hey, I'm not coming in,"

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,659
you know,although he did go to London 
that one time, but I don't...

41
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,370
-Adam, okay, enough.
-What?

42
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,780
I just got back
from Montana.

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,460
I-I'm not ready
to deal with you.

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,099
-Okay.
-This is not how I imagined it.

45
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,950
What?

46
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,200
-I need you to focus, Adam.
-Okay.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,770
Go get a set of keys
to a car, any car.

48
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,590
Meet me in the garage
in five minutes.

49
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,230
My water just broke.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,070
I'm about to go into labor
and you are taking me to the hospital.

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,620
Go!
-Okay.

52
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,520
Adam...

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
Yeah, wrong way,
sorry, j-just relax.

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,630
Everything's
going to be okay.

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,070
Here you go.
Thanks very much.

56
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,960
So it was your fault?

57
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,120
What do you mean?

58
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,980
I just spent 18 months
in Riker

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,190
You show up
on the day I get out

60
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,300
and tell me I shouldn't have
been there in the first place?

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,750
Two years ago your vehicle struck
and killed Maris Donovan.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,700
You claimed
that you were behind the wheel,

63
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,600
but I believe someone
else was driving.

64
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,560
So, I'm just curious,

65
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,210
why would you take responsibility
for something you didn't do?

66
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,939
You think that's what happened?

67
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,460
Yes, I do.

68
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,730
Unfortunately, all I've got is circumstantial forensic evidence
and a gut feeling.

69
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,650
None of which the DA will pay any attention to without
the truth from you.

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
Why would I lie about something
like that?

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,570
Why would I sentence myself
to prison?

72
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,120
Because you didn't think you'd
go to prison, Talmadge.

73
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,949
Or if you did go to prison,
you'd get three months, tops.

74
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,230
Or maybe you'd just get slapped
with a fine.

75
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,940
But instead, a very unsympathetic judge
made an example of you,

76
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,230
and there was no way
you could have predicted that would happen.

77
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,190
And there was no way
you could get out of it once you took the blame.

78
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,860
A detective
chasing theories,

79
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
What I'm chasing is the truth.

80
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,050
Someone committed a crime
and got away with it.

81
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,480
There was no one else
in that car.

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,660
Well, that's what we believed that night
because that's what you told us,

83
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,930
but I have evidence that
suggests otherwise.

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,290
Circumstantial evidence?

85
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,940
Thanks for the coffee.

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,280
Oh, no! No! No! Oh, no!

87
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,240
No, I-I can't... I can't tell
if she's breathing!

88
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,370
I don't know if she's alive!
Somebody help!

89
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,780
I'm a doctor. 
I might be able to help.

90
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,300
Somebody call 911.

91
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,080
Please be okay.
Call an ambulance!

92
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,550
It's a terrible accident.

93
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,700
It's just awful, Mac.
She's so young.

94
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,740
Her name is Maris Donovan.

95
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,840
The deli ownerays
she comes in occasionally.

96
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,650
Thinks she lives
around the block.

97
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,970
Was he the one driving the car?

98
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,500
Talmadge Neville.

99
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,519
Said he didn't see her
until it was too late

100
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,030
and did everything he could
to avoid the collision.

101
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,100
He swerved, and his car
slammed into the lamppost.

102
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,820
Is he okay?

103
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,570
Paramedics
checked him out.

104
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,890
Despite the damage
to the car,

105
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,190
he appears to be
physically fine.

106
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,540
Emotionally,
he's struggling to hold it together.

107
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,420
-Intoxicated?
-No. Passed the sobriety.

108
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,100
This is a bad one.

109
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,030
Any witnesses?

110
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,079
No one that can help.

111
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,780
Most of these folks
just heard the noise.

112
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,550
A passerby tried to revive her
before ESU got here, but...

113
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,270
Was there anyone else
in the car?

114
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,940
No, he was alone.

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,220
What'd you find?

116
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,000
********

117
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,690
Looks like he was
texting while driving.

118
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,700
Maris! Where's my daughter?

119
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,060
Maris!

120
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,140
Ma'am, I'm sorry, you
can't toh the body.

121
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,020
Oh, no!

122
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,870
Mrs. Donovan.

123
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,800
No, no!

124
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,440
Listen, listen, listen, I'm...

125
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,299
-Did you do this?
-I am so sorry. It was an accident.

126
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,830
Look what you've done
to my daughter!

127
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,099
Look what you did to her!

128
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,860
Give her back...
-Mrs. Donovan, please! Mrs. Donovan!

129
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,580
Oh, no!

130
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,170
Oh, no!

131
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,690
Why isn't she answering her phone?

132
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,580
Doc, take 57th right there.
It'll be faster.

133
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,919
Danny, I got this, I got this.
l right.

134
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,430
Voicemail again.

135
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,349
Baby, it's me.

136
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,119
We're close, okay?
Hold on till I get there, okay?

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't want to miss this.
I love you. I love you, okay?

138
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,030
Hey! Watch out, man!

139
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,619
Okay, right here, Doc, Doc,
Doc, okay, right there.

140
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,990
Make a right, go around the
corner and pull into Emergency.

141
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,340
Hey, Danny,
congrats, brother.

142
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,860
Thanks, Doc.

143
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,520
Hi.

144
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,700
Okay, here's what
you're looking for.

145
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,970
Talmadge Neville's parole
officer is Jerome Addison.

146
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,429
Condition of his parole is that he check in 
within four hours of his release.

147
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,190
I've got an address
up on East 59th Street.

148
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,030
Hey, I thought you were
taking the day off.

149
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,649
Just looking into some
unfinished business.

150
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,280
Neville. It's the, uh,
car accident, right?

151
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,670
He was texting?

152
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,849
thought that case was
pretty cutnd dry.

153
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,849
He did 18 months.
Got out this morning.

154
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,919
Hey, Mac, most people on their
days off take in a museum,

155
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,740
a matinee,
catch up on some sleep.

156
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,750
Here you are digging up
a closed case.

157
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,710
Our lab didn't analyze the
evidence collected at the scene

158
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,490
because at the time Neville took
full responsibility.

159
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,839
Well, makes sense.
He was driving the car.

160
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,759
Maybe not.

161
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,560
Okay.

162
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,010
So you've processed
that evidence.

163
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,600
And now you have
a different theory?

164
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,100
Nothing definitive,
but certainly enough to have reasonable doubt.

165
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,119
You were that kid
in school

166
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,360
who did all the extra credit
projects, weren't you?

167
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,430
You made all the rest
of us look bad.

168
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,930
Three months ago
I slammed on the brakes
in my car

169
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,090
to avoid a collision with the
vehicle in front of me.

170
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,869
 <i>My shoulder restraint jolted</i>
 <i>back.</i>

171
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,960
 <i>And I was, I was sore within an hour</i>
and for a few days afterwards.

172
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,830
My left shoulder was bruised
from where the restraint tightened.

173
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,670
That moment triggered a memory.

174
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,579
The night of Talmadge
Neville's accident,

175
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,400
I remember quite clearly he was
rubbing his right shoulder.

176
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,960
Which would put him
in the passenger seat.

177
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,150
And suggests someone else
was driving.

178
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,460
I suppose I could
just let this go.

179
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,669
But Don, I can't forget the look
 <i>on Katherine Donovan's face</i>

180
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,070
 <i>when she saw her daughter</i>
 <i>lying lifeless in that street.</i>

181
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,610
I remember thinking,

182
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,949
"I'm so glad this
isn't a hit and run."

183
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,829
That this man took
full responsibility for what he'd done.

184
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,489
He didn't claim
the brakes didn't work,

185
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,810
he didn't point the
finger at the victim.

186
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:41,840
There was something so tragic
yet decent about it all.

187
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,430
And now I believe
someone else is involved.

188
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,490
And that someone
thinks they got away with it?

189
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,570
No.

190
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,220
That's not how
this is going to end.

191
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,570
Thanks for this.

192
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,090
Mr. Neville, get in.

193
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,590
What the hell do you
want, Detective?

194
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,200
The truth, a name.

195
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,360
I have nothing to say.

196
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,180
All right, then I'll dothe talking. come on.

197
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,120
I heard it already.

198
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,970
Look, Talmadge,
I'm not going away.

199
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,900
I could call your
parole officer.

200
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,740
He might wonder why a detective
from the crime lab is asking so many questions.

201
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,910
That would definitely
complicate things for you.

202
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,280
Come on, get in.

203
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,670
Start telling your story.

204
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,380
My lab recovered your vehicle
from the impound yard.

205
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,920
I recreated the reported
speed of the car

206
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,479
and simulated the
object of impact

207
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,740
and placement of the phone
and not once did the cell land

208
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,040
on the front passenger side
floor where u recovered it.

209
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,080
And in Neville's vehicle,

210
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,320
the power adjustment
gears under the seat

211
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,439
are too bulky for an object
just to slide forward.

212
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,060
But that doesn't definitively eliminate the possibility
that the driver was holding the phone.

213
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,979
But it makes it more plausible
Which brings us to the prints.

214
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,549
passenger seat was
Now, Neville's left thumb print
was on both the driver

215
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,060
and passenger seat belt
release button.

216
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,810
Well, he certainly could've been
a passenger in his own car

217
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,269
at another time
other than the accident.

218
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,960
Yes, he could and I thought
about that but...

219
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,070
This is Talmadge Neville's thumb print
lifted from the driver's side release button.

220
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,249
Now, based on the position of the apex
and the delta points,

221
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,360
it appears that Neville released the belt
from the passenger seat.

222
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,410
But there is another
possibility.

223
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,939
He could have used his left
hand from the driver's seat.

224
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,679
Doc, I thought about that,
too. But why would he reach

225
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,570
all the way across his body and turn his thumb
180 degrees to release the button?

226
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
I mean, it's an
unnatural action.

227
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,330
But easily accomplished
from the passenger seat.

228
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,619
Leads me to conclude
that Neville released

229
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,860
that belt to let
someone else out.

230
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,469
There was no one else
in that car.

231
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,240
I struggled with
my seat belt.

232
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,730
I panicked, couldn't get out.

233
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,580
The evidence doesn't
suggest that.

234
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,899
Your thumb pressed that
button once and lifted.

235
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,350
You had no problem
releasing the belt.

236
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,180
And the direction of the print implies that you weren't
in the driver's seat.

237
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,899
Why would I lie?

238
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,610
What would I gain?

239
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,010
I am now and forever an ex-con.

240
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,099
Unemployable,
unreliable, unworthy.

241
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:26,070
It doesn't sound like something a man
chooses if he's got an ounce of common sense.

242
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,200
You see that vendor there?

243
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,510
That was my life before
all this happened.

244
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,810
I was a single father,

245
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,359
working 10, 12 hours a day,
seven days a week,

246
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,220
peddling dogs and pretzels,

247
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,430
earning an honest
living for my kids.

248
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,950
My son, Joe, is now a professor.

249
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:54,090
And my daughter, Karita,
she's a surgeon.

250
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,140
And wouldn't you like
them to know the truth?

251
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,070
Were you in the car with someone you
shouldn't have been?

252
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,500
Were you or your family threatened
if you didn't keep this secret, Talmadge?

253
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,760
When you were in Rikers,

254
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,250
you refused to have any
other visitors except one.

255
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,240
Nick Donley.

256
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,120
He's head of the Local 515,

257
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,760
the City Sidewalk Cart Union.

258
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,989
I wanted to know what would
happen to my business.

259
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,710
He's also a pretty tough guy
who shakes down vendors for a cut.

260
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,939
Haven't seen you in
a while, Talmadge.

261
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,010
I been busy.

262
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,010
What do you say
we take a ride?

263
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,789
Hey, look, Nick,
I'm really tired, now.

264
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,320
You know, I've had a long day.

265
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,860
I'll tell you what.

266
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,139
I'll drive.

267
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,240
You listen.

268
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,040
Nick was not in the car.

269
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,550
Then who was?

270
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,100
You weren't behind the wheel of the car that hit
Maris Donovan.

271
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,500
The right person should
be punished for the crime.

272
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,180
The debt has been paid.

273
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,820
Unfortunately, Talmadge,
that's not a decision you get to make.

274
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,920
Yeah, I need to order
a dozen roses.

275
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,670
Delivered tonight after 5:00.

276
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,700
White.

277
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,910
Do they really think that I'm just going to
walk this baby right out of me?

278
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,670
Why can't I be one of those women
who just sneezes and before you can say,

279
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,340
"God bless you,"
she's had the baby?

280
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,700
Think of what
you'd miss out on.

281
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,810
Reminding your
child of all those long, 

282
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,770
painful hours of labor 
that you endured to bring them into this world.

283
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,200
I guess I could get
some mileage out of that.

284
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,950
I'm kinda scared, Stella.

285
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,290
That's normal, Lindsay.

286
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,779
Just remember, you're
healthy and strong.

287
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,429
You and Danny went
through all the courses.

288
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,500
Yeah, no, I don't mean
about having the baby.

289
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,290
About being a mom.

290
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,220
I mean, what if
I stink at it?

291
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,190
And the worse part is I won't
know until it's too late.

292
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,150
She'll come home, she'll
scream that she hates me,

293
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,000
then in rebellion she'll get some part
of her body pierced that's inappropriate.

294
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,130
And she'll get
an infection,

295
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,630
and she'll wind up
on antibiotics

296
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,010
which we find out 12 years later
they cause an eating disorder

297
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,630
and pretty soon
I'm in therapy trying to save my whole family.

298
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,550
I mean, what if some people just
aren't cut out to be parents?

299
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,300
Well, the fact that you already
thought about all this,

300
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,220
tells me that you're gonna
do just fine, Linds.

301
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,310
I'm losing it, huh?

302
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,760
Yeah.

303
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,790
Oh, contraction.

304
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,219
What if she has twins, Adam?

305
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,700
I mean, you hear stories about people
being completely surprised.

306
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,789
And you've seen Lindsay, right?

307
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,210
I mean, she's huge.

308
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,950
She knows it.

309
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,690
Relax, you got the ultrasound.
It's not twins, all right?

310
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,670
You gonna be okay?

311
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,249
No, no, I'm not.

312
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,480
Feel like I might go into cardiac arrest
while she's giving birth.

313
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,700
Mac, you're here.

314
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,520
No, no, she hasn't yet.

315
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,740
Oh, we're on
the fourth floor.

316
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,530
All right, I'll be right there.

317
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,330
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.): Dr. Karita Neville, please report
to the second floor nurses station, Tower Two.

318
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,680
My daughter, Karita,
she's a surgeon.

319
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,010
Dr. Karita Neville, please report
to the second floor nurses station, Tower Two.

320
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,170
 Is that a picture
for your grandma?

321
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,760
Beautiful,
I like that.

322
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,880
Okay, well, I'll
see you later.

323
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,190
she was driving in the car.

324
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,720
You're sure
it was Dr. Neville?

325
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,760
Positive,
I remember her face.

326
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,320
She was at the accident scene.

327
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,080
That's who Talmadge Neville
was protecting, his daughter.

328
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,950
She had to be the one dring
the car, not him.

329
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,510
And then she just
blended into the crowd

330
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,290
and watched  he
took the fall?

331
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,100
Why would she do that?

332
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,330
It's possible that
they traded places

333
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,060
because she had more to lose
if she was behind the wheel of the car.

334
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,750
I remember Flack saying
that someone tried to revive the victim

335
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,250
before the paramedics arrived.

336
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,619
Is it possible that it
was Karita Neville?

337
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,710
I mean, she is a doctor.

338
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,350
Maybe there's something in Sid'autopsy report
of Maris Donovan that can confirm that.

339
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,830
Well, we know she was there.
You can ID her.

340
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,929
Yeah, but we need something
that puts her at the scene

341
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,700
very close to the
time of the accident.

342
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,200
Something that says
there was no other place

343
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,390
she could have been
except in that car.

344
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,480
We should go, Mrs. Donovan.

345
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,570
How much time will he get?

346
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,970
Talmadge Neville.

347
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,940
Most likely he'll be charged
with second degree manslaughter.

348
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,009
Time he serves will be
up to the judge.

349
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,570
Meaning he could simply get
probation and his license revoked?

350
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,400
Mr. Neville's been
very cooperative.

351
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,920
He's remorseful.

352
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,579
This whole thing--

353
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,619
Yes, I know, it was an accident.

354
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,570
Everybody keeps saying
it was an accident.

355
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,370
Just doesn't feel like that
on this side of the glass.

356
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,900
Oh, that man was stupid
and reckless.

357
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,630
In one split second,
he took my daughter's life.

358
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,970
And he has to live with that.

359
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,340
Unfortunately, so do I.

360
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,930
Mac.

361
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,110
Did you need something?

362
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,330
Uh, I was wondering
if you could pull an old autopsy file.

363
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,340
Maris Donovan.

364
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,940
Came in here
about two years ago.

365
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,870
You working
on your day off?

366
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,870
Why is it that everyone is so concerned
with what I do on my day off?

367
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,859
Are you kidding?

368
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,150
I mean, come on,
you never take a day off.

369
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,959
Yes, all right.

370
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,919
The file?

371
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,700
It's taking a minute to come up.

372
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,810
You looking
for something specific?

373
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,199
Maris Donovan.

374
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,499
Car accident victim,
16 years old.

375
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,760
Two years ago.

376
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,810
Was there anything to suggest that she was alive
for even a few minutes at the scene of the car accident?

377
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,179
I don't recall.

378
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,389
However...

379
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,490
different monitor,
different equipment.

380
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,250
I have a database
of CT scans...

381
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,520
and I'm quite sure I have one
for Maris Donovan.

382
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,120
Yeah, it's coming back
to me now.

383
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,690
I believe I noted that the bruises here
were inconsistent with the accident injuries.

384
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,060
But...

385
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,790
because they are red
in color, I can conclude

386
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,569
that they occurred
very close to death.

387
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,940
Placement on the body and the size
are consistent with compression marks?

388
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,060
Yes, someone could have
attempted CPR,

389
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,130
but they must have been there
right after impact,

390
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,710
because, based on these other injuries,

391
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,500
Maris Donovan didn't live very long
after the accident.

392
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,930
Karita Neville is a doctor.

393
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,630
She may be the one
who assisted the victim at the crime scene,

394
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,110
and your time line
just might put her in the car.

395
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,640
All right, autopsy report.

396
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,499
Strange.

397
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,820
Yours is the second request
for this particular case this week.

398
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,760
That rarely happens
for one this old.

399
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,290
Who made the first request?

400
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,639
Usually, it includes a name,

401
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,490
but this says "Confidential."

402
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,430
 <i>My father was in that accident.</i>

403
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,060
And so were you,
Dr. Neville.

404
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,390
You switched places.

405
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,580
There was much more risk
for you to be behind the wheel than your father,

406
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,970
because eight years ago,

407
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,730
you were charged with a DWI.

408
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,810
With one more conviction,
you could face 15 years.

409
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,790
Detective, I'm going
to say this one last time.

410
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,440
I wasn't in that car.

411
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,280
Now, I have patients.

412
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,180
I'm in awe of your unwavering
commitment to the lie.

413
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,260
Can't imagine what it was like
to watch your father cuffed and later locked up,

414
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,879
knowing the whole time
that it should have been you.

415
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,520
15 months were added to his sentence
for being accused of texting while driving,

416
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,520
only he was texting
from the passenger seat.

417
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,690
I'm just curious.

418
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,950
Was there a moment
that you ever felt guilty?

419
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,200
The debt has been paid.

420
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,870
No, Dr. Neville.

421
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,250
No debt is paid when
the wrong person is convicted.

422
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,590
I don't want you
to forget my name.

423
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,030
You're going
to be seeing me again.

424
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,490
Mrs. Donovan, we believe
it was Karita Neville

425
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,859
who was behind the wheel of the
car that killed your daughter

426
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,690
and not her father
Talmadge Neville.

427
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,310
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

428
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,360
How do you explain this?

429
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,900
And why didn't
you know this then?

430
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,939
Well, I'd like to discuss the details
of our investigation, but I'm...

431
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,569
You're starting
a new investigation?

432
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,439
Yes, yes.

433
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,490
That's why I'm
here.

434
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,350
 I wanted totell you personally.
-It's been two years.

435
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,579
That man spent
18 months in prison.

436
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,490
I know that none of this
is easy to hear,

437
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,739
and revisiting what happened
all over again...

438
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,950
I won't do it.

439
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,190
I can't do it, Detective.

440
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,429
I'm still waiting for the morning when
I no longer believe I hear Maris

441
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,660
singing in the shower
down the hall.

442
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,620
Well, thanks for
the information.

443
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,610
I would prefer that you involve me
as little as possible.

444
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,140
I'm sorry to rush you out,
but I have a meeting.

445
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,120
Of course.

446
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,170
Flack, see if you can
track down Neville.

447
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,680
I think he'd be interested
in what we know.

448
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:59,640
Talmadge Neville, NYPD! go ahead.
-We're clear.ead.

449
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,140
We're clear over here.

450
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,920
Hey.

451
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,800
Hey, how's Lindsay?
7 hours counting.

452
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,950
She dilated past
one centimeter yet?

453
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,099
That's kind of a
personal question, Adam.

454
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,149
Oh, sorry.

455
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,600
I-I just have 18 hours and 15 minutes in the
hours of labor office pool.

456
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,770
600 bucks on the line, yo.

457
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,970
What's up with the bike pedal?

458
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,030
Flack found it
at Neville's apartment.

459
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,260
What was strange, though,
is that

460
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,119
 <i>it was wrapped in copies of</i>
 <i>Maris Donovan's autopsy report,</i>

461
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,590
and it was painted
completely white.

462
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,080
Analysis of the paint
says it's pretty heavy duty.

463
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,140
Yeah, it's something you would use to paint
the exterior of a house.

464
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,499
There's a void on the spindle threads.

465
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,140
Suggests that it was still
attached when it was painted.

466
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,939
But if that's the case,

467
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,270
there should be some kind of
wear pattern from a shoe.

468
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,279
But there's barely a scratch.

469
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,690
Means nobody rode it.

470
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,199
You said that Flack found this
at Talmadge Neville's apartment?

471
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,990
Yep.

472
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,030
Just the pedal, no bike.

473
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,310
Ghost riders.

474
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,879
Ghost riders.

475
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,150
Follow me.

476
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,260
Those bikes are
all over the city.

477
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,599
They're in memory of people
who lost their lives in bike accidents.

478
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,990
They're called
ghost riders.

479
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,789
Somebody died in
a bike accident down there?

480
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,720
Yeah.

481
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,170
And I'd be willing to be that t pedal in our lab
is from a bike in memory of Maris Donovan.

482
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,080
Somebody didn't want
Talmadge Neville to forget

483
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,760
why hepent the last
18 months in prison.

484
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,920
You asked to see us,
and we're here, so...?

485
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,550
You know this guy?

486
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:55,980
What about him?

487
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,020
He should be lying in an alley right now
with a blet between his eyes.

488
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,150
Excuse me?

489
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,830
And how do you
know that?

490
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,050
You were gonna do him,
weren't you?

491
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,070
So what's your beef
with Talmadge Neville?

492
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,060
Let's just say I'm a guy
with a specific skill set.

493
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,120
And I got the constitution to commit acts
that other people don't have the courage to.

494
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,300
You're a hit man.

495
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm not familiar with that term.

496
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,980
Sorry, contract killer. 
Is that what you prefer to put on your business cards?

497
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,109
I'm not interested in playing games,
Mr. Desoto.

498
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,249
What are you doing here?

499
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,340
-My client had a change of heart.
-Who's your client?

500
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,600
An hour ago, I received word
that the new beneficiary of my services

501
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,970
is supposed to be this girl right here.

502
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,470
Something tells me your client wasn't
the only one that had a change of heart.

503
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,999
No women, no children.

504
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,490
A hit man with a code of ethics.

505
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,420
How noble.

506
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,030
Who hired you, Mr. Desoto?

507
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,060
Don't know her name.

508
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,210
How about a description?

509
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,900
Female, late 40s.

510
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,000
 <i>I had a meeting with her once.</i>

511
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,250
 <i>She was wearing sunglasses</i>
 <i>and a wig.</i>

512
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,960
 <i>If you find her,</i>

513
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,300
don't go asking me to come
pick her out of a lineup,

514
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,190
'cause I pretty mh got
"I don't recall" down pat.

515
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,360
Thank you.

516
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,509
You've done
the right thing here.

517
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,480
Hey, look, I didn't come in here
for a pat on the back, Detective.

518
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,740
This woman's desperate.

519
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,999
I get the feeling,
with or without me,

520
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,680
she's gonna get this done.

521
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,960
Just checked with
the hospital.

522
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,019
Karita Neville finished
her shift two hours ago.

523
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,529
I left a message with
the swering service.

524
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,900
We've tried her cell
and home phone,

525
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,260
haven't gotten an answer.
-Just keep calling.

526
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,130
Flack has uniforms
at Neville's apartment.

527
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,660
We checked in
with his parole officer,

528
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,860
and Neville never indicated
what he had planned for the day

529
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,340
except to say
he would look for a job.

530
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,639
He used to be a
street vendor.

531
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,570
See if he's tried to contact
any of those companies or Nick Donley about work.

532
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,249
Let's also try to contact
his cell mate at Rikers.

533
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,600
See if Neville mentioned
any special plans.

534
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,089
Mac, female prints I lifted
on the photo of Karita Neville

535
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,200
didn't get any hits
in AFIS so no ID.

536
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,800
But they were a match
to the prints

537
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,840
I found on the autopsy report
recovered in Neville's apartment.

538
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,089
Easy to put
two and two together.

539
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,950
Only this time,
it adds up to one.

540
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,490
Are Talmadge and Karita Neville
alive, Mrs. Donovan?

541
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,950
That's an odd
question to ask me.

542
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,100
Are they safe?

543
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,840
Those flowers are from a friend.

544
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,750
He was supposed
to do me a favor.

545
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,210
But he couldn't.

546
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,290
Turns out, I didn't
need it done anyway.

547
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,160
I know about grief,
Katherine.

548
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,450
About losing someone
you care about.

549
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,120
I lost everything
when I lost her.

550
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,300
Make sure to get brown
and white rice in the bag.

551
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,179
And don't stop for any junk
food, Maris.

552
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,530
I got it, Mom.

553
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,110
Okay. Be careful. I love you.

554
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,710
Mom, I'm just going
around the corner.

555
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,270
It's been two years.

556
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,570
It still hurts so badly!

557
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,950
I lost my wife on 9/11.

558
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,030
Some days...

559
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,280
it seems like it
was so long ago.

560
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,260
Others...
like it was just yesterday.

561
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,680
I wish I could promise
that you'd stop missing Maris,

562
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,829
hearing her voice or imagining 
she'll be there

563
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,710
when you get home, but...

564
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,739
I can't.

565
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,499
I'm so ashamed that I let
this consume me.

566
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,940
I'm so afraid that if I stop
thinking about it,

567
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,400
it'll be like I forgot her.

568
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,950
But you came here
for another reason.

569
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,480
So what now,
Detective?

570
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,410
Compassion.

571
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,800
Grief is an emotion that 

572
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:42,300
can force a good and decent person
to make a very, very bad decision.

573
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,160
And knowing that,
I have a choice to make.

574
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,400
I can do everything I can to prove that 

575
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,100
you were involved
in a conspiracy to commit murder.

576
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:06,310
Right now, I have no witness,
no paper trail, no confession.

577
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,960
Or...

578
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,700
I can show a little compassion.

579
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,680
Are you sure I deserve that
courtesy, Detective?

580
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,210
I believe Maris' mother
deserves it.

581
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,630
However, I want
to be clear.

582
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,100
If you violate the law
in any way,

583
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
I will, without hesitation,

584
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,600
gather all the proof I need to prosecute you for this offense

585
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,780
to the full letter of the law,
you understand?

586
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,990
That, Katherine, I <i>can</i> promise.

587
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,810
Thank you.

588
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,870
Still no Talmadge
Neville.

589
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,140
I was about to report the same thing
about his daughter, but...

590
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,520
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

591
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,060
I'll tell you the truth.

592
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,450
 <i>Your brother even whines</i>
 <i>in his text messages.</i>

593
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,889
He says, "It was not fair."

594
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,139
Is he crazy?

595
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,700
You tell him I don't care
how much more money I make. He owes me.

596
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,740
He lost that Super Bowl bet.

597
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,419
-K, you good?
-Yeah, I think so.

598
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,720
We gotta get out of the car.

599
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,619
Dad, there's a girl in the street. 
I think she's hurt.

600
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,799
Come on. Get out. Get out.
Come on. Get out of here.

601
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,020
Get out of here.
You gotta leave.

602
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,099
Oh, but Dad, she's hurt.

603
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,320
This is an accident that can
ruin everything you worked for!

604
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,679
Get out of here!
Get out of here now!

605
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,090
Go, go, go, now, now!

606
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,850
No, no! I-I can't, I can't tell
if she's breathing!

607
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,740
I don't know if she's alive!

608
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,140
It was so stupid,
I know.

609
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,300
But I was just doing
what my father asked.

610
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,770
I was scared. We both were.

611
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,100
But you were at the scene
when we arrived.

612
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,850
I just couldn't leave her there.

613
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,690
Your instincts
as a doctor took over.

614
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,870
Yeah.

615
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,240
Somebody help!

616
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,570
 <i>So I returned as if I hadn't</i>
 <i>been there at all.</i>

617
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,699
 <i>And I offered my help before</i>
 <i>the paramedics arrived.</i>

618
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,500
Somebody call 911.

619
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,770
 <i>And my father and I</i>
 <i>just pretended</i>
 <i>we didn't know each other.</i>

620
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,300
Why? Why lie?
Why trade places, Karita?

621
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,770
We had spent the evening at this reaurant celebrating
the end of my residency.

622
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,529
You'd had a couple of drinks?

623
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,970
One glass of wine.

624
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,740
I swear to you, I wasn't drunk.

625
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,540
My father would never
have let me drive.

626
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,470
Despite that,
he just couldn't take the chance.

627
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,380
He was afraid your prior DWI
would influence the judge

628
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,260
and ultimately your conviction.

629
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,560
So he claimed to be driving the car.

630
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,400
He didn't have much
faith in the truth.

631
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:29,410
I begged him for days after just
let me take responsibility for what I'd done.

632
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,050
But he said we were in too deep.

633
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,790
He still believes to this day
that it was the right thing to do.

634
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,200
"Greater good, Karita," he says.

635
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,030
Greater good!

636
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,730
Dano, Dano, how's Lindsay doing?

637
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,840
You gotta be kidding me.

638
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,470
Is that her I hear screaming
in the background?

639
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,169
Yeah, yeah, all right.
All right, daddy.

640
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,930
I'll talk to you later.
Take care, bud, bye.

641
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,190
Detective Flack?

642
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,390
Mr. Neville.

643
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,280
I understand you have something
that belongs to me,

644
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,540
and I was wondering
if I could get it back.

645
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,610
Need some help?

646
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,510
I thought I was rid of you.

647
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,640
I wanted to say
I'm sorry.

648
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,900
For what?

649
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,110
That I can't give you back those
18 months you spent in jail.

650
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,930
I would have done it again
all the same if I had to.

651
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,500
Your daughter means
the world to you.

652
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,970
Oh, yeah.

653
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:04,050
And I'm sure Ms. Donovan felt
that way about Maris.

654
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,780
Karita told us
everything.

655
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,380
What was it about the
truth that scared you?

656
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,860
The odds.

657
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,880
My daughter made
a mistake.

658
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,280
DWI. One mistake.

659
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,330
No question she was wrong,

660
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,960
but sometimes
we're not too forgiving.

661
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,750
You can't tell me
that taking responsibility for that accident

662
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,120
wouldn't have changed things for her.

663
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,200
I wanted to preserve
what I had worked for all those years.

664
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,980
I wanted her to succeed.

665
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,100
And she's doing it.

666
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,110
Only one regret...

667
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,720
That this little girl lost
her life that night.

668
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,790
So what happens to Karita now?

669
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,900
It was an accident, Neville.

670
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,120
Now that we know
what really happened,

671
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,930
no DA with an ounce of common
sense will prosecute that case.

672
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,410
Greater good.

673
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,429
 <i>That's okay. </i>

674
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,530
That's okay.
You're doing great.

675
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,590
-You can do it, baby. Good!
-Breath breathe.

676
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,500
-Good!
-There we go!

677
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,610
There we go!
-Come on. Come on. You're doing great.

678
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,440
You're doing great!
-Good job, Lindsay.

679
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,500
Good job.
keep it up.

680
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,239
Keep it up!
-Hey, that's it, baby!

681
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,649
That's it, sweetheart!
Go ahead! Come on!

682
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,280
-Breathe.
-Come on! Push one more. Push!

683
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,730
Here we go!
Come on!

684
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,140
-Good job, good job.
-There she is! There she is!

685
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,960
Way to push, Lindsay.
There she is!

686
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,790
Keep it going. Come on.
She's beautiful.

687
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,700
Here we go...
She's beautiful.

688
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,390
Oh, babe...

689
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,960
All right, you did it.
You did it.

690
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,680
 <i>Oh, hello.</i>

691
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,050
Oh, hello, sweetheart.

692
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,940
Ah... Hi. Hello.

693
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,800
Oh, Danny,
I hate to admit it,

694
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,159
but she looks just
like you.

695
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,430
Yes, that's right,
she's a knockout.

696
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,799
How you holding up?

697
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,009
I'm great.

698
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,960
But she's gonna be an only child
'cause I am never doing that again.

699
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,489
Do you guys have a name?

700
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,150
-Lydia.
-Lucy.

701
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,920
Guess that's a no.

702
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,840
Mac, we did agree
on one thing.

703
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:31,150
We were hoping that you would
consider being the godfather.

704
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,430
Absolutely, yes.

705
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,350
Made him an offer
he can't refuse.

706
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,130
You know, "Godfather," that's
code word for diaper change,

707
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,100
you know that?

708
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,780
Whoa, whoa.
Do I get to spoil her?

709
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,830
I think Danny's got that
covered.

710
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,200
Oh, we forgot
about the oohs and ahs.

711
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,640
Okay, yes, yes,
ready, everybody?

712
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,850
And...

713
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,220
That's nice.
So cute.

714
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:12,860
