1
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,925
There 's this psychiatrist...

2
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,428
...a lady named
Dr. Frances Cress Welsing.

3
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,057
She has a theory
about the black man in America.

4
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,602
She says that because
of the system of racism...

5
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:05,065
...he's been made
to think of himself as a baby...

6
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:10,821
...a not-yet fully formed being who
hasn't realized his full potential.

7
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,783
To support her claim,
she offers the following:

8
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,121
First off...

9
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,084
...what does a black man
call his woman?

10
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,130
Mama.

11
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,635
Second, what does a black man
call his closest acquaintances?

12
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,638
His boys.

13
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:42,936
And finally, what does a black man
call his place of residence?

14
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,647
The crib.

15
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,167
No!

16
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,170
I don 't want to lose my baby!

17
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,362
Baby!

18
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,036
Come on, babe.

19
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,040
You all right?

20
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,546
We'll go straight home, okay?

21
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,218
Jody!

22
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,391
Baby, come on.

23
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,479
Just take it easy, okay?
Just get in.

24
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,733
Take it easy, baby.

25
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,746
Baby?

26
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,249
Yvette?

27
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,586
You going to sleep?

28
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,257
Are you hungry?

29
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:41,555
I'll go to Lucy's and get you a cheese
enchilada and a strawberry shake.

30
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,099
That'd make you feel better.

31
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,227
I'm fine, Jody.

32
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,608
You don't need Daddy
to be here for you?

33
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,445
I'm just trying to take care of you.

34
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,448
Seems like you already done that.

35
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,578
Leave me alone, Jody.
Just get out of my face.

36
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,840
Then I guess you don't mind
if I use your car, huh?

37
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,801
Since you're going to sleep.

38
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,392
What's up, little homie?

39
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,978
What's going down with you?

40
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,147
Get the hell home.

41
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,451
Peanut?

42
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,832
Why are you screaming?
I'm hungry. Fix me some food.

43
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,278
You gonna give me some love?

44
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:23,866
Hey, Ms. Herron.
How's Daddy's little girl doing?

45
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:29,872
Look at you. Suckie-suckie, now.
Come on.

46
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,375
How's Daddy's little baby?

47
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,588
-Jody, you're parked in the driveway.
-Sorry. I'll move it.

48
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,674
Least you can do
is wash mine before you leave.

49
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,719
I got it.
Say, "Daddy got it, Grandma.

50
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,346
Daddy got it all under control."

51
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,473
Look at my pretty baby.

52
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,561
One thing I know how to do
is make some pretty babies.

53
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,898
That's my baby.
That's my little girl.

54
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,194
When will you say "Daddy"?
You want to go to Disneyland?

55
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,073
That's my baby.

56
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,411
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

57
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,230
Go on and pull the damage out.

58
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,093
What you doing to the backyard, Mama?

59
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,637
I told you I was starting a garden.

60
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,599
You've said that for the longest.

61
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,437
I must be getting old. I'm doing the
same things I seen my mama do.

62
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm planting collards,
mustard greens...

63
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,819
...and all this over here
will be my corn.

64
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:28,031
Tomatoes. Then I'll get
a lace awning at Home Depot...

65
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,161
...so I can sit here, tune you out and
sip my wine while my tomatoes grow.

66
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:38,166
My cabbage is over there.
My beans, onions and sage.

67
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,837
How's Yvette?

68
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,839
She's all right. Sleeping.

69
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,301
I can't give you money
every time you get a girl pregnant.

70
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,511
I know, Mama.

71
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:02,691
This is Melvin.
He's helping me with my new garden.

72
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,319
He owns a landscaping business.

73
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,530
Maybe you can work for him
and make some money.

74
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,284
Your mama told me you got a problem
finding a job.

75
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,536
I know how that is.

76
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,373
I had that problem too,
before I got my own business.

77
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,710
I'll take these back to the truck.

78
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,050
I'm gonna see you later?

79
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,677
I hope so.

80
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,400
So you got a new boyfriend now?

81
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,238
Mama gotta have a life too.

82
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,997
I'm trying to get money.

83
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,042
That's all I'm about. I desire sleep.

84
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,921
-Hey, homie. Want some weed?
-No, man. I'm cool.

85
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:12,594
I ain't gonna make no money here.
There's too many weed mans.

86
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,597
Let's go holler at these hos.

87
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,940
How's moms doing?

88
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:29,611
She cool.
I think she got a new boyfriend.

89
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,447
Some old thug-ass nigga.

90
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,117
I know she'll want to kick me out.

91
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:41,123
He'll want to lay up in the house,
move me out so he can get at Mama.

92
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,504
Next thing you know,
he'll be goin' upside her head.

93
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,966
Ain't that the way it go?

94
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,262
Why are you still with him?
You're always at the clinic.

95
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,141
It ain't Jody's fault.
It take two.

96
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,393
I stopped taking my pills.

97
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,104
There you go blaming yourself again.

98
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:08,108
How many times do you call on
the phone about his ass?

99
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:13,155
Cut him loose. I don 't care
if you got a baby. He don 't own you.

100
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,910
Look, Jody don't put his hands on me,
no matter how mad he get.

101
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,453
He ain't crazy.

102
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:23,123
Bitch, how long you been with Chris?
Three years?

103
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:27,336
How many times has that nigga gone
upside your head?

104
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,254
How's your eye feel?

105
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,341
It's all right. It's all right.

106
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,511
Shit. At least we living together.

107
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,473
He just want to play with your life
and string you along.

108
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,143
He with his other baby's mama
when he ain't with you.

109
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,188
Please believe. He don't love that ho.

110
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:50,817
Oh, but he love you, though.
You need to check him.

111
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,861
What's he say about moving in?

112
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,698
Jody wants to live with his mama,
not with me.

113
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,035
Jody, my Jody.

114
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:04,039
He's a mama's boy.
He'll never leave his mama.

115
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:09,878
Then let him fuck his mama.
Have her ass up at the clinic. Shit!

116
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,274
I love you, Jody.

117
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,483
I love you too.

118
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,861
I want you to have my baby.

119
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,905
I want to have your baby.

120
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,448
I want to have your baby.

121
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:21,909
I love you, Jody.

122
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,118
I love you.

123
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,745
I love you too.

124
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,247
I love you, Jody, but you scare me.

125
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,749
You scare me.

126
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,149
No, that's my baby.

127
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,820
Oh, my baby.

128
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,447
Don't cry, Mama.

129
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:04,660
Give him back!
God, please, give him back!

130
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,165
Jody!

131
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,012
Can I have my car
so I can get to work?

132
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,264
Your car?

133
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,515
My car!

134
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,935
Go on with all that, girl.
I'm here asleep.

135
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,271
It's Monday. I can't be late.

136
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,858
Monday? What's that supposed to mean?

137
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,526
Get up!

138
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,779
Please be on time.

139
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,490
I'm always on time, Yvette.

140
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,826
Don't have me waiting.

141
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,995
Give me some sugar.

142
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,297
-Love you.
-I love you too.

143
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,591
You gonna have a good day?

144
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:04,178
Be good. Listen to Daddy.
I love you.

145
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,138
Love you too, Mommy.

146
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,098
Thumbs up. My man.

147
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,184
You be good too.

148
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,353
-I'm always good, baby.
-Yeah, right.

149
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,692
Come in front, little man.

150
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,820
Young baller, future shot caller.

151
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,947
5:05, Jody. Don't be late.

152
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,005
You want to nod your head too?
That's my boy.

153
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,385
Wait a minute, Jody!
Hold it! Shit!

154
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,347
You got a man out here waiting.

155
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,559
How do I look?

156
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,020
Okay. Where you going?

157
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,815
I don't know. I'm just going.
He asked and I'm going.

158
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,527
Necklace or no necklace?
You don't know.

159
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,988
Why don't you know
where he's taking you?

160
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,742
How'd you know to wear
that tight-ass dress?

161
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:13,705
This is an all-purpose dress. I am
prepared for anything in this dress.

162
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:17,835
He likes music, so we're probably
gonna hear music.

163
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,880
You know where he live?
Been to his house yet?

164
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,885
What you know besides him
smiling at you? He could be crazy.

165
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,137
Is he a killer like Henry?

166
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,891
Why don't you get an L-7 boyfriend?

167
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,228
A white-collar brother
with a briefcase.

168
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,941
You like them thugs.
I don't know why.

169
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:45,529
Your daddy was a thug. I need a man
who can handle a woman like me.

170
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,407
He's got to be a thug to handle you?

171
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,743
Melvin's not a thug. He's a nice guy.

172
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:56,874
I'm going out, that's all I know.
That's all I need to know.

173
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:01,086
I got a date. I look "okay"?
I look good.

174
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,266
What's up, man?

175
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,148
Them's some nice shoes.

176
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,608
Stacey Adams.

177
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,735
Stacey Adams, huh?

178
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,486
OG style.

179
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,283
So where y'all going?

180
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:35,704
I'm taking her to a club on Crenshaw,
listen to some music.

181
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,581
My partner's in a band there.

182
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:42,461
That's good. That's real good.
My mama likes to dance.

183
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,130
I asked 'cause I just met you...

184
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,884
...and I didn't want to
chaperon you old folks.

185
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,601
That's my brother, Ray.

186
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,272
He lived here until Mama kicked
him out over her last boyfriend.

187
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:05,776
He dead now.

188
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,987
My brother, I mean.

189
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,158
So where you live, man?

190
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,661
I live in Inglewood.

191
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:21,375
I grew up on 101st and Vermont.
The Hoovers.

192
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,046
That was a long time ago.

193
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,173
I was young...

194
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,300
...and dumb.

195
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,180
Jody, are you messin' with my date?

196
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:39,017
No, I'm keeping him company.
Playing the host.

197
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:43,230
Nobody likes sitting up here,
waiting alone.

198
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:47,317
Why can't women be ready on time?
They always make us wait.

199
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,236
Whatever, Jody.

200
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,457
All right, y'all have a good time.

201
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,210
Mama, remember your curfew.

202
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,133
You need money?
I got some change for you.

203
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,385
Jody, you ain't got no money.

204
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:17,723
Bring me back a Fatburger,
on the real, little cheese.

205
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,725
Go in the house!

206
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,604
You be careful with my mama, man.

207
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,739
Got that pure cake.
No butter, no sugar.

208
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,451
Straight, like my brother's soul.
We got pound cake.

209
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,746
-Give me some pound cake.
-Here you go, brother.

210
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,582
Thank you, brother.
Have a good day.

211
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,132
Today I begin a new life.

212
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,135
I am the master of my abilities...

213
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,805
...and today will be a great
and beautiful day.

214
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,265
What?

215
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,062
I said, today I begin a new life.

216
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,606
I am the master of my abilities...

217
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,943
...and today will be a great
and beautiful day.

218
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,279
Pillows, pillows. Goose down, $35.

219
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,119
Pea, are you a buyer or a seller?

220
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,454
What?

221
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,790
Videos, homie. Videos.

222
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,502
DVD, CDs, Master P,
Charlie's Angels.

223
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,801
Look at yourself.

224
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,429
How many millionaires you got on?

225
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,140
I count at least three.

226
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,143
What are you talking about?

227
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,355
Pea! Look around, man.

228
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,360
You see what I see? I see money.

229
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,406
Look at my man there selling T-shirts.

230
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:02,035
A brother selling pies and papers.
Cake Man over there.

231
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,873
Everybody moving, making money, right?

232
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,209
While we standing still, being broke.

233
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,047
I figured all this shit out, man.
All this.

234
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,885
The world moves forward
through transactions.

235
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,845
Commerce, nigga.

236
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,890
The exchange of goods and services.

237
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:27,352
All the real ballin',
successful folks are sellers.

238
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:31,356
All the broke people playing
catch-up are buyers.

239
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:37,362
I ain't trying to go out like that.
I'm gonna be a seller.

240
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,575
I'm gonna get my own business.

241
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,536
Change the game.

242
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,914
You want to sell clothes?

243
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:51,835
Like the man who came to the phone
company selling dresses. Remember?

244
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,045
Cute ass.

245
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:56,507
-Women's or men's clothes?
-Women's.

246
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,134
Women buy clothes every other day.

247
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,762
But you need to know about women.

248
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,847
I know all about females.

249
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,432
You hear your son?

250
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,726
-You're a bad boy.
-Believe me.

251
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,438
Are you trying to be a salesman
or a shyster?

252
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,858
You buy from a shyster,
you feel like you got took.

253
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,070
You buy from a good salesman
and you feel lucky.

254
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,864
A good salesman makes you
feel so good...

255
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,576
...you'll go back again to give
more and more money.

256
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,411
That sounds like sex.

257
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,248
-What else should I know?
-Sizes.

258
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,292
You gotta know a woman's size
on sight.

259
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,420
Don't wait for her to tell you.
Just know.

260
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:39,675
-Compliment them, even if they ugly.
-Especially if they are.

261
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,885
-Like Bernice.
-She's big.

262
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,096
They'll be your regulars.

263
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:48,058
You need to know her favorite
color, what's in season....

264
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,061
And fabrics.
How it feels on our skin.

265
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,605
What's an average size?

266
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,358
I'm a size 5-6. That's average.

267
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,986
For who? A white girl?

268
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,156
Jody, I'm a size 1 6
and that's average too.

269
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:07,077
-Remember that, you'll make money.
-It's best on payday.

270
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,004
Rachel?

271
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,633
My name is Joseph Summers.
My friends call me Jody.

272
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,344
You want to be my friend?

273
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,140
I wonder if I could
talk to your customers...

274
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,767
...show them my merchandise.

275
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:35,856
I didn't want to come in and talk
to people without your blessing.

276
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,191
What you selling?

277
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:41,320
You see this? That's your color.

278
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,866
You're an earth-tone woman.
It match your hair.

279
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,745
Feel how soft that is right there.
See that?

280
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,664
See? See how soft that is?

281
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,167
This is from Paris, France.

282
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,295
You'll change the game with this.
It's couture.

283
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:03,884
Girl, that's polyester blend.
You pop it in the dryer and go.

284
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,178
This dress is perfect for you.

285
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:10,015
It's an all-purpose style.
All-purpose dress.

286
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,226
You know what that means?

287
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,646
You can wear it to work,
go straight to happy hour.

288
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,233
Them pants got happy hour
written all over them.

289
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,529
Baby, I ain't gonna lie to you.

290
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:27,407
Them is one of a kind. Explosive!

291
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:31,537
You see anyone with them pants on,
you can come bite me.

292
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,497
It ain't happening.

293
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:36,917
How much?

294
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,670
I'll let it go for $40.

295
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,547
Forty dollars?!

296
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:47,219
Look, $35. That's the lowest I can go.
You're killing me.

297
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,222
Okay, 35.

298
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,396
Thank you.
I'll squeeze my tiny ass in this...

299
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:01,608
...and upstage these bitches in here.
You like it? Cute.

300
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,778
One...

301
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,947
...two hundred, three....

302
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,241
That's four hundred dollars!

303
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,952
That is crazy!

304
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:23,255
Lord, that's crazy.
That is crazy. Okay.

305
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,489
Come on, dog.

306
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,626
I like!

307
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:06,798
It look good.
Your mama look fly, don't she?

308
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:08,967
Your mama look good?

309
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,804
-I got another surprise.
-What?

310
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:17,976
That beautiful dress, my son looking
nice.... We're doing big things!

311
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,978
What'd you do to my car?

312
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,814
I got them tinted windows done.

313
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,151
I got some 1 0s from my Mexican homies.

314
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,372
I told you she'd like that.
Daddy got taste.

315
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,269
Want some breakfast?

316
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,726
--I learned so many
incredible secrets.

317
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,228
When placing ads in newspapers...

318
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:47,941
...just one secret I can show you
can make you a fortune.

319
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:51,236
Nice, huh? State of the art.

320
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,573
Yeah. This is the bomb.

321
00:26:55,532 --> 00:27:00,204
-Mama didn't say she got a new TV.
-She didn't know. It's a surprise.

322
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:01,788
Oh, yeah?

323
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,126
I have to hook up the VCR
and set the timer...

324
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,086
...so she can see--

325
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:13,133
I hooked it up and set it already.
Pass the remote, youngster.

326
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,302
Let me show you how it works.

327
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:20,265
I got this bad boy
from my man for free.

328
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:25,479
You know how much it costs
in one of them electronic stores?

329
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,649
-It cost a grip.
-You got that right.

330
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,611
But we black folks
live by the barter system.

331
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,072
You know about that?

332
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,576
When black folks had no money,
we traded for things.

333
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:44,289
My man give me this TV 'cause I did
some work for him back in the day.

334
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:49,461
You know, shot a couple niggas,
cut up some folk. Dumb shit.

335
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:54,508
I was like you, Jody.
Young, dumb and out of control.

336
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,969
I did a dime.

337
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:00,681
Ten years straight
in San Quentin and Folsom.

338
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:04,476
All over some dumb shit. But you?

339
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,563
You're smarter than I was at your age.

340
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,983
I gotta hand it to you.
You're smart.

341
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,819
You're no killer like me. That's good.

342
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:17,030
I was bad.
I ain't had my dome straight.

343
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:20,576
But, Jody, peep this. On the real.

344
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:25,247
Me and your mama
are getting real serious...

345
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:29,418
...so I'm gonna be
around here for a while.

346
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:35,090
I ain't trying to be your daddy
or nothing, but if you need advice...

347
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,177
...feel free to talk to me.

348
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,929
'Cause I seen it all...

349
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,765
...and I done it all to the full.

350
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,270
You may think you see new shit
out here, but it's just...

351
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,272
...a rerun to me.

352
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:55,235
You know what I'm saying?

353
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:22,804
Mama?

354
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:28,143
Mama, have you got this nigga
living up in here now?

355
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:31,063
-Can't I have a life?
-You got a life!

356
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:36,318
Them days are over. I ain't
like Big Mama. I got to have fun.

357
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,987
You have fun. Why can't I?

358
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:42,324
But why does the man
have to live here?

359
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:46,578
He a killer,
and you got him in the kitchen...

360
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,790
...scrambling eggs
and drinking the Kool-Aid?

361
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,834
He was making me breakfast!

362
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,335
All right.

363
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:59,633
What am I supposed to do?
Roll over and die?

364
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,301
You gonna kick me out?

365
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,304
You gonna kick me out?

366
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:08,141
Let me know now.
I don't need no surprises.

367
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,811
I do. Surprise me and move out.

368
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,982
You could learn from Melvin.

369
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:20,320
He's done well for himself.
He's turned his life around.

370
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:25,617
He has his own business. I don't have
to force him to get a job!

371
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:35,335
You're not a baby no more, Jody.
You need to grow up.

372
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:40,883
You got your own family. Why don't you
and Yvette get a place together?

373
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:49,224
Why are you so afraid to grow up
and be a man? Leave the nest.

374
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:51,393
I am a man.

375
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,150
So you're kicking me out?

376
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:03,739
What for? To be with this nigga?
You don't even know him.

377
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,870
What do you mean, "leave the nest"?
You didn't! This is Grandma's house!

378
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,915
I don't have to leave
if you never did!

379
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,834
What are you talking about?

380
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,670
Mama needs a life too.

381
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,589
Fuck you, bro.

382
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:23,550
Can you tell your son something?

383
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,969
No, I'm not in it.

384
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,183
But why he do the things he do,
Miss Juanita? You must know.

385
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:36,021
I don 't know what to do.
I love him, but how much can I take?

386
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,940
I can't believe this!

387
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:41,276
I told you, I won't be
in y'all's business.

388
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:45,489
What's between you and Jody
is you and Jody.

389
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,492
What do I do with his selfish ass?

390
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:52,621
He got me and his son walking
while he rolling in my car.

391
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:57,668
The car I'm paying the note on.
Man, I feel so stupid.

392
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,838
You ain't stupid, Yvette.

393
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,342
You're just in love with a man.

394
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:15,310
When you in love with a man,
he can make you feel high.

395
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,689
So high you just be in outer space.

396
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:24,152
But he can also make you feel low.

397
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:28,031
Real low. And he can keep you there.

398
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,700
Keep you down.

399
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,869
If you let him.

400
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:36,874
But don't even worry about feeling
used. It's just temporary.

401
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:40,335
We all get used.
Men use women, women use men.

402
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:43,005
Just accept that you'll be used.

403
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,675
But if you feel so used
that you got nothing left...

404
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:51,221
...if the man ain't giving you
the energy you need to love him...

405
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:55,517
...even when he's acting
like a bastard, you need to let go.

406
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:59,730
If you ain't got nothing to give
yourself or your baby...

407
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,900
...you won't have it to give to him.

408
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,073
Good boy. Now the corn.

409
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:13,327
Did you finish the tomatoes?
There you go.

410
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:16,580
Thattaboy. A little more water
on the greens.

411
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:19,583
Hi, Juanita. Where's my baby?

412
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,757
Hey, Mama.

413
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:42,648
Bring my grandbaby here
so I can kiss her goodbye.

414
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,609
Bye, sweetness.

415
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,611
Be a good girl.

416
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,619
Ooh, Melvin!

417
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,956
Oh, baby.

418
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:03,794
-You gonna give me a cavity.
-Oh, yes, baby. Melvin!

419
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,630
Okay, circles. Around and around.

420
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:09,299
Take it, take it. You ride.

421
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,051
I love to ride!

422
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,682
It's the African squat fuck.
The old nigger squat fuck.

423
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,313
Squat, baby. Squat, baby.

424
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:27,317
Can y'all keep it down?
People are trying to sleep!

425
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:28,986
Let me down, baby.

426
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:30,404
Fuck!

427
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:34,324
--and that she was impressed.
Broke her off.

428
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:36,660
Made her feel good.

429
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,663
Now I got myself a regular customer.

430
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:49,339
What the hell is he looking at?

431
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:55,971
Trying to psych me out, talking about
being a killer. Old-school nigga.

432
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,184
He don't want us to have
to put heat on his ass, do he?

433
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,269
Want me to take him out?

434
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:05,856
Let the nigga breathe.

435
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:11,862
He make my mama unhappy, we make
his ass bleed. On the real.

436
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:17,492
Make him feel the steel.
Long as she happy, he got his life.

437
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,369
Won't be no strife.

438
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:23,207
And I hope his ass hear me too.

439
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:26,543
I hear you.

440
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,465
You know your problem?

441
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:36,762
You think you know everything,
but you don't know shit.

442
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:41,892
I see you got a little business
going. Well, that's good.

443
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,228
You make that paper.

444
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:48,190
But when you making paper,
there's rules that go with it.

445
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:52,736
You gotta learn the difference
between guns and butter.

446
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:59,243
There are two types of niggas. Those
with guns, and those with butter.

447
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:04,248
What are the guns?
That's the real estate.

448
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:07,584
The stocks and bonds. Art work.

449
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,754
Shit that appreciates in value.

450
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,756
What's the butter?

451
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:18,720
Cars, clothes, all the other bullshit
that don't mean shit later.

452
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:22,516
That's what it's all about.
Guns and butter.

453
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:25,269
You little dumb motherfuckers.

454
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:33,318
See what I'm sayin', cuz?

455
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:37,114
This nigga doing this shit
every night.

456
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:38,866
What?

457
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:45,372
Why can't you just
sit still and relax?

458
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:47,457
Don't complain.
You left me here all weekend!

459
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:48,667
Don't complain.
You left me here all weekend!

460
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,794
Why can't you sit still?

461
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:54,089
That's what divides us
as a people. No focus.

462
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:59,052
Why don't you sit down and focus?
Watch some PBS or something.

463
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:03,182
You so full of shit.
So fucking selfish.

464
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,892
What's this old pizza?

465
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:09,980
Since you're starting shit,
where you been since yesterday?

466
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,984
Slinging dresses, making money.

467
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:17,613
Got the brakes fixed.
What you been doing?

468
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,990
-You been fucking around?
-Nope.

469
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,034
Let me smell your dick.

470
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:23,911
Go on with that.

471
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:28,999
If you ain't been whoring around,
let me smell your dick. I can tell.

472
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,250
Go on.

473
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:35,005
I ain't playing with you. Move!
I'll knock your ass out.

474
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:41,678
See? My shit smells good, don't it?

475
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:45,557
See what? You probably washed it off.

476
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:51,063
I'm tired of you messing around on me.

477
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:55,275
I know you and Sweetpea was out
doing me wrong.

478
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:56,985
I didn't do nothing.

479
00:37:57,194 --> 00:38:01,949
You gonna sit there with
a straight face and say that?

480
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:07,204
I didn't do nothing.
I was over at Kim's, playing spades.

481
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:11,375
You're a liar!
You went to that after-hours spot.

482
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:15,712
Some nasty heifer was
shaking her ass in your face...

483
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:19,299
...then you went to a private room
with the bitch...

484
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:21,343
...and did I don't know what!

485
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:26,473
I know 'cause Chris was there.
Sharika's Chris? He saw you.

486
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,894
You busted.
It's all on your grill, stupid.

487
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:33,647
All right.

488
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:37,401
I was there. But I didn't fuck.

489
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,821
She just danced for me, that's all.

490
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:45,325
-Did you touch her?
-Hell, no. That nasty girl?

491
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:50,080
We can't touch them anyway.
It's against the rules.

492
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:55,460
Private dance, that's all.
Just a quick lap dance.

493
00:38:57,087 --> 00:39:00,757
You don't believe me?
It's the truth. I didn't fuck!

494
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:05,304
It was a private dance, in the corner.
I didn't do shit.

495
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:08,473
You must take me
for some kind of fool.

496
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:12,436
You foul. I smell
your dirty ass from here.

497
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:15,564
Why you got to be around
them nasty girls?

498
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:18,775
They do that shit every night, dummy.

499
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,987
You know how many dicks
they suck every night?

500
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:26,491
And you go down there like
the rest of them fools!

501
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:30,579
You better not bring me nothing
from them bitches.

502
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,998
Fuck it then! Don't believe me.

503
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:37,503
I said I didn't fuck that girl.
Stop putting your hands on me.

504
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:38,921
Where you going?!

505
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:43,217
I hate you!
You're selfish, arrogant and stupid!

506
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,011
-Whatever.
-I don't need you!

507
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,474
I'm tired of sitting here,
not having a man with me.

508
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:54,686
Being lonely. I'm gonna do
what the fuck I wanna do.

509
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,855
What are you gonna do?

510
00:39:57,231 --> 00:40:01,193
I said I'm tired of waiting
for your ass. I hate you.

511
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,028
I'm gonna have me a man.

512
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:06,532
A man who wants to be with me
and my baby...

513
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,868
...and have a family.
A real man, Jody.

514
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:13,872
Not some little boy, still living
at home with his mama.

515
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,041
Fuck you! Kiss my ass!

516
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:21,547
Go out on the streets and be a trick.
I should knock you the fuck out.

517
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:25,217
You better not, or I'll call your
probation officer...

518
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:29,263
...and they'll put you
back in jail! Now....

519
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,557
Kiss my ass, nigga!

520
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,061
You better walk away. I hate you!
You so stupid!

521
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,231
You hate me? Keep on saying that shit.

522
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,568
That's right. I hate your ass.

523
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:46,405
You make me sick.
I can't stand your black ass!

524
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:50,617
You act like a little boy
instead of a grown man.

525
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:52,119
I hate you!

526
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:56,290
You know what? I hate your ass too.
Do something.

527
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:02,045
Give me my keys. You ain't going--

528
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:05,632
Get off me! There you go,
coming downstairs...

529
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:08,802
...showing off before the neighbors.

530
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:12,181
-Fuck them! I hate you!
-I hate you too!

531
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:15,058
I love you! I love you so much!

532
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:18,103
I love you too. I ain't going nowhere.

533
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,816
-You feel him?
-Yes, I feel him.

534
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,234
You feel him?

535
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:26,987
Oh, my God, I feel him! He big!

536
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:29,239
-What do you feel?
-Daddy Dick.

537
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,700
-You love Daddy Dick?
-I love him.

538
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,203
-You say it.
-I love Daddy Dick.

539
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:36,830
You gonna clean all that mess up?

540
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:40,209
-I'll clean up!
-You gonna cook some tacos?

541
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:43,587
My God! I'm about to come.
I'm gonna come!

542
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:45,964
Yes, I'll make the tacos!

543
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,763
Oh, my God....

544
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,849
I could bite you right now.

545
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,268
Damn, boy. Shit!

546
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,270
Now what?

547
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:04,233
That's the beat-it-up-white dance.

548
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:06,777
You are so stupid.

549
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:11,365
I was over there to the right.
Did you feel me?

550
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:15,702
-I see you ain't going nowhere.
-That's 'cause I'm sprung.

551
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:19,873
So you're gonna clean up that mess
and make tacos, right?

552
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,252
I'm gonna cook and clean.
You put it down.

553
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,464
I'll feed you, you big old monster.
I love you, boy.

554
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:29,132
I love you too.

555
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:32,469
-Bring that chocolate here.
-I'm on my way.

556
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,306
Come here. Just make sure
you can handle me.

557
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,184
You trying to go for round two?

558
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:50,112
Jody, when I say I hate you, what
I really mean is that I love you.

559
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,157
But you scare me. It's like
we ain't gonna be together.

560
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:57,494
I'm trying to sleep.

561
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:02,624
We'll always be together.
Unless I get killed or something.

562
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:07,838
Don't talk like that.
Don't even play around like that.

563
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:11,675
I'd go crazy if something happened.

564
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:16,013
On the real, you know why
I made you have Joe-Joe?

565
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:21,310
I thought I was gonna get shot
out in these streets.

566
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:26,190
I wanted a piece of me to still
be here, even if I was gone.

567
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:32,487
When he was born, I was like, "Cool.
No matter what happens to me...

568
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:35,532
...I'll still be here in some way."

569
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:39,411
So if something happened to you,
what about me?

570
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:42,706
You'd be all right.

571
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,542
Go to sleep.

572
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,396
You don't want me here? Kick me out!

573
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:50,524
Shut up, Pea! Nobody said that!

574
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:54,069
Y'all in there-- What?
Sinuating? lnsinuating?

575
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:56,363
Fuck it. I'll leave.

576
00:44:56,572 --> 00:44:59,616
-You need to shut up.
-No, you do.

577
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:03,078
You're the one talking
loud and making noise.

578
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:05,122
Are you back-talking me?

579
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,709
Huh? You don't know how
to act towards your man?

580
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:12,504
I'll put my foot so far up your--
Come on in, Jody.

581
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:18,093
A houseful of women!
Houseful of sensitive females...

582
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:22,347
...dealing with they damn hormones!
Y'all unstable creatures!

583
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:27,352
I won't say the "B" word. "Unstable
creatures." That's my new word.

584
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:29,646
Mama, don't say nothing.

585
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:32,816
You'll make it worse.
He's leaving anyway.

586
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:37,905
I'm trying to concentrate.
They won't let me be. Want a drink?

587
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:41,658
-No, I'm cool.
-Why are you acting all shy?

588
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:45,329
My house is your house
Mi casa es su casa!

589
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:48,165
I got milk, water, Kool-Aid...

590
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:52,127
...strawberry soda. I'll get you
a strawberry soda.

591
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:59,218
I'm sorry, Mrs. Daniels.

592
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,220
I'm so sorry. I love you.

593
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:05,140
And Kim. In fact, I love you more,
'cause without you...

594
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:06,892
...Kim wouldn't be here.

595
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,938
Y'all said you love me!
You told me I could stay here!

596
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:14,399
Bought me new clothes
and the video game!

597
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:17,694
I thought we had a family!
I got no family!

598
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:20,906
I'm trying to make that happen
with y'all.

599
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:24,076
-What, nigga?
-Come here.

600
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:26,662
I'm talking to my family here.

601
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:31,124
I love y'all. Both of you.

602
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:34,169
Come on. I need you to roll with me.

603
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,422
All right, then. I'm leaving.

604
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:41,510
Let's go get some liquor.
Strippers ain't at work yet.

605
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:45,264
You don't need liquor.
You're already too fired up.

606
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:48,183
Who the fuck are you calling fired up?

607
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:51,603
You're responsible for the shit
they give me.

608
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:56,525
You still ain't found me no job!
Hook me up with your business!

609
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,861
When you gonna find me a job?

610
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:02,531
-Why I gotta find you a job?
-'Cause you my man!

611
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,909
Okay. Step to my office.

612
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:07,911
All right.

613
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:13,417
You have a mission. I'm gonna give
you one piece of merchandise.

614
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,753
If you can sell it,
we can talk business.

615
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:21,091
-Sell one thing.
-One thing.

616
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:23,302
Check it out.

617
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:28,098
I got dresses, shoes, baby clothes.
Take your pick.

618
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:32,102
I'll sell this dress.

619
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:34,855
-Not that.
-I know what I want to sell!

620
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:39,109
Yes, the original cake.
The original man.

621
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:41,612
Salaam. Break bread, brother.

622
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,119
Hey, take a look at this dress.
Want to buy it?

623
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:52,956
-Not my color.
-No, no, hold on. Stand still.

624
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,292
Look at that. That looks good.

625
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:58,629
I don't want it.
It don't even look in season.

626
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:01,465
It is. They're wearing this in Paris.

627
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:05,260
I saw Tyra Banks in this
and you finer than her.

628
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:13,310
What's the material?

629
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:16,563
Goddamn! You want to buy
the dress or not?

630
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:19,733
You treat me like I'm some
fucker asking for change.

631
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,402
I'm doing something constructive.

632
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:27,074
I could be out knocking folks over,
but I'm trying to live right.

633
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:30,786
You call that living right?
Selling a stolen dress?

634
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:35,832
I ain't stole nothing in my life!
I got this from my homeboy.

635
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,669
That's what y'all do? Boost?

636
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:44,091
Sell stolen stuff? Like that man
there trying to sell that camera?

637
00:48:56,019 --> 00:49:01,024
-You don't want me answering it?
-Go ahead. It's probably for me.

638
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:04,820
Collect call from
California Correctional Facility.

639
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:08,574
Correctional Facility?
Do you accept the charges?

640
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:10,367
Hell, no!

641
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,663
Who's calling you from jail?
That nigga Rodney?

642
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:17,583
Oh, you don't hear me now? Hello!

643
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:22,045
Rodney's lonely. He just want
someone to talk to. Don't trip.

644
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:25,424
That why the phone bill
was an extra $1 00?

645
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:30,470
I'm paying you to talk to him?
You putting my money on his books too?

646
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:33,974
Didn't I tell you
to put a block on the phone?

647
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,560
You don't listen to nobody.

648
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:39,396
Don't even trip.

649
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,400
Collect call from
California Correctional Facility.

650
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:44,610
I accept.

651
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:48,947
-Hello, Yvette?
-This ain't no motherfucking Yvette.

652
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:50,616
Put her on the phone!

653
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:54,661
This is my house!
Don't ask to speak to my woman!

654
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:57,831
Your house, nigga?
You don 't even live there.

655
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:01,877
Is this Jody? The Jody
that got my boo pregnant?

656
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:05,130
Who won't take his
responsibilities as a man?

657
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:08,842
Living at your mama's house?
Running around...

658
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:11,678
...like a little boy? You's a bitch!

659
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:15,724
Look at you! What you got?
Your ass in jail!

660
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:18,560
Don't tell me how to handle mine.

661
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:21,522
Don't call my fucking house no more!

662
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,107
My girl ain't feeling you, cuz!

663
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:27,736
Nigga, concentrate on
not dropping the soap...

664
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:29,404
...bitch-ass nigga!

665
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:31,448
Fuck you, cuz.

666
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:36,078
I want a block on the fucking phone!

667
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:37,871
All right, Jody! Damn!

668
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,835
What are you doing, sitting on the
phone, telling him my business?

669
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:44,378
He's saying :

670
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:48,507
"You still live with your mama!"
I don't want to hear that!

671
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,804
She's so suspicious.
She always think I'm fucking someone.

672
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:57,474
I go to the bathroom,
"You got a bitch in there?"

673
00:50:57,683 --> 00:51:01,687
I'm going to the store,
"There a bitch at the store?"

674
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:08,318
Then I got to come home to Melvin
and his bullshit.

675
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:11,989
I want to get saved.

676
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:14,992
Say what, bruh?

677
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,705
Get the fuck out of here!
We're talking.

678
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:25,335
Poncho! I'll be done with your bike
in an hour. Come back.

679
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:29,840
I want to be saved, Jody.

680
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,969
I need to be baptized,
so I can go to heaven.

681
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:36,972
Wash my sins away,
so them gates open up.

682
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:40,601
I don't want Jesus to say,
"Turn your ass around."

683
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:44,855
You should do it too.
Get baptized with me.

684
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:50,903
What did you do, man? You did
something bad to be saying this.

685
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:55,532
No, I'm trying to keep
from doing something. I need money.

686
00:51:55,741 --> 00:51:57,701
A job to keep me busy.

687
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:01,330
Something besides
playing Madden all day.

688
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:06,210
I don't even stay at Kim's house
during the day. I leave at 9 :00.

689
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:10,506
Come back at 6, acting like
I did something constructive.

690
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:12,382
Like I'm working.

691
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:15,969
I ain't did that shit
since continuation school.

692
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,349
Sneaking around Kim and her mama
like I'm a child.

693
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:25,604
Like I'm a scared little boy. I gotta
ask my woman and her mama for money.

694
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:30,234
How do you think that makes me feel?
Like a man?

695
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:36,573
This shit is tearing me up, cuz.
It's eating me alive.

696
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:40,452
I don't want to end up killing nobody.

697
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,997
What am I gonna do, Jody?

698
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:51,421
Shit, I was in the same boat too.

699
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:57,719
You gotta find something you like
to do. Something you're interested in.

700
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:00,597
Like I did.

701
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:03,809
What you good at?

702
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:06,103
Robbing.

703
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:13,277
-Hey, Jody.
-What's going on?

704
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:16,947
-What's up, Jody?
-What's going on with you?

705
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:21,285
-I need some new boots.
-I got you covered with gator, girl!

706
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:24,496
They might be bootleg,
but I got you, girl!

707
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:30,252
Dresses! I got some business suits
coming in! You'll love those!

708
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:34,590
Why are you yakking and talking shit?

709
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:39,219
I'm trying to make money. When
money come in, you never complain.

710
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:40,429
Don't be cute.

711
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,028
Nice and quiet. My own little spot.

712
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:59,698
Watch my tomatoes. Got some wine.

713
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:09,875
Over there. I think I see
some weeds by the peppers.

714
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:13,253
Why don't you use Weed-B-Gon?

715
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:17,424
I'm a natural gardener.
That's how it was done way back.

716
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:20,511
You get on your knees
and pull them up.

717
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,056
It's what my mom and daddy did.
It's what I do.

718
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:27,392
Remember to put the weeds
in the compost pile.

719
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:30,395
You doing nothing
but bossing me around.

720
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:34,274
I think I'll plant
some summer squash next year.

721
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:39,738
-Jody, we got to stop this.
-What?

722
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:42,950
Every time I come out,
you go in the house.

723
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:45,702
Nobody's thinking about you, bruh.

724
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:50,040
This is where I relax.
Take that noise somewhere else.

725
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:54,878
Every time I come out to work
in the garden, he goes in the house.

726
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:00,759
Give me some wine.

727
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:13,438
Seven, winner.

728
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:15,524
Baby, be sweet.

729
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:19,278
Eleven, winner. Seven, eleven.
That's all I'm rolling.

730
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:42,467
How come you ain't
brought your kids around?

731
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:47,431
Don't you got a son, 1 7,
named Duquan?

732
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,059
And a little girl about 5 named Maya?

733
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:54,813
-You tell my mama about them?
-She know.

734
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,482
Why ain't you brought them around?

735
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:00,152
You ashamed of them?

736
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:02,487
They ugly like you?

737
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:12,497
I don't get along too well
with my babies' mamas.

738
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:15,834
-I'm sure you understand.
-No, I don't.

739
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:18,670
I'm cool with both my babies' mamas.

740
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:22,591
-We'll see how long that lasts.
-Long as I want it to.

741
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:26,136
But we're talking about you, not me.

742
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:28,931
I talked to your son the other day.

743
00:56:29,723 --> 00:56:33,644
I heard you say his name
when y'all old niggas was here...

744
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:35,229
...playing cards.

745
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:38,690
He live five minutes from here,
in Inglewood.

746
00:56:38,899 --> 00:56:42,945
I drove to Morningside High School
and asked him about you.

747
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:48,700
He didn't have shit to say about you
'cause you whipped his mama's ass.

748
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:51,203
What do you think about that?

749
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,747
You gonna beat my mama?

750
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:59,086
No. I think you know better
than that, don't you?

751
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:04,591
You want to walk around here with your
chest out, saying you a real man.

752
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:07,845
Know why I don't like you
around my mama?

753
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:10,597
'Cause you foul.

754
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:15,143
You're a dirty motherfucker, Melvin.

755
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:19,273
Don't think I'll let you
get it in her head...

756
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:23,235
...to kick me out like
the last nigga did my brother.

757
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:26,613
'Cause I ain't having it, bruh.

758
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:30,492
No way, no how.

759
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:32,786
Ah, youngster.

760
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:39,251
You get your ass out of here.

761
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:43,463
Mama!

762
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:47,092
Yeah, that's right.
Call for your mama.

763
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:50,679
I stayed off you
out of respect for her.

764
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:55,601
If not for your mama, I'd have broke
your little ass down long ago.

765
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,312
"Jody? Little Jody?"

766
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:03,525
Know what I see when I look in your
eyes? A scared little bitch.

767
00:58:03,984 --> 00:58:05,569
That's what I see.

768
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:09,698
If we was on lock-down,
I'd make you get on your knees.

769
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:13,994
Twenty years. Let's see
where you be 20 years from now.

770
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:15,662
Melvin?

771
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:22,669
What y'all doing?

772
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,005
Nothing.

773
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:27,758
Can you go get me some cigarettes?

774
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:31,845
-Maybe some beer. What you doing?
-You're so sweet.

775
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,307
Watch your hands.

776
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:37,017
Hurry back, okay?

777
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:44,483
Want anything from the store?

778
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:48,987
What's up, Jody?

779
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:51,323
The candles smell good.

780
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:54,493
Aromatherapy.

781
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:56,537
You smoke?

782
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:59,164
No. I don't mess with that.

783
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:03,919
So you and Yvette got a baby?
Where y'all stay at?

784
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:06,296
We don't live together.

785
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,133
You ain't gotta lie.
I know y'all live together.

786
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:13,011
You drop her off
and pick her up every day.

787
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:17,224
That's just what we do.
I don't want to discuss 'Vette.

788
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:20,894
We don't need to talk.
I just want some dick.

789
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:30,696
Why you want to fuck me?
To make my girl mad?

790
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,699
-That what you want to do?
-No!

791
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:36,535
It ain't like that.

792
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:41,373
I just think you're cute.
I mean, I see you all the time.

793
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:44,877
When we was in the parking lot...

794
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:48,547
...l thought we was feeling
each other.

795
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:50,883
Was I wrong?

796
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,555
Yeah, I was feeling you.

797
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:00,058
But I ain't feeling this. I'm out.

798
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,396
Jody, come on. Don't be like that.

799
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:08,567
This is just between us.

800
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:12,404
I see how you look
when you come around.

801
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:15,407
You saying you don't want to hit this?

802
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:18,827
Come over here and get this pussy.

803
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:22,289
I don't need to go there with you.

804
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:25,292
Yvette.

805
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:28,754
Besides, I ain't got no condoms.

806
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:30,464
No way.

807
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:39,431
Somebody don't want to leave.

808
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,152
Oh, fuck!

809
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:54,613
What are you doing, girl?

810
01:00:57,866 --> 01:00:59,618
I can't do this.

811
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:09,503
Oh, shit.

812
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:23,684
I know you want this.

813
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,686
I can't do this.

814
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,189
I promise it'll be good.

815
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:33,527
No, this shit is foul.
It's foul. This shit's wrong!

816
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:38,156
Get off me. I can't fuck you.
My girl finds out...

817
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:40,951
...she'll kill me.
I love her too much.

818
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:45,038
So you a little bitch?
Your girl tells you what to do?

819
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:47,207
I told you it was a trick.

820
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,543
Hood rat.

821
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:56,508
I don't need you! I can get
dick any time I want! You want this!

822
01:01:56,717 --> 01:02:00,012
No, you want this.
You lucky I let you taste it.

823
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,723
This Daddy Dick belongs to Yvette.

824
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:05,517
Not from what I hear, you ho!

825
01:02:06,018 --> 01:02:07,019
Fuck you!

826
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:10,147
You don't know how
to suck dick anyway.

827
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:34,880
Why is that bitch staring?

828
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:38,008
I don't know,
but she about to get slapped.

829
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:41,053
Fuck you.

830
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,096
No.

831
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:01,406
How come you ain't waving
at her today?

832
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:03,742
I ain't thinking about her.

833
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:08,956
She was staring at me today.
She was about to catch a beat-down.

834
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:09,700
I think she's a lesbian for real.
