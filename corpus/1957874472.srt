00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:09,134
[gentle music playing]

2
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,657
[audience applauding]

3
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,038
[audience cheering]

4
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,331
All right, let me explain.

5
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,333
Friend of mine...

6
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,521
- "Former friend," we'll call her.
- [audience laughter]

7
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,921
...is an artist, right?

8
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,717
And the theme of our friendship
is kind of feeling alone in the world.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,845
Right? So I wrote this show,
which is about that feeling.

10
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,639
And I sent her the script and I was like,

11
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,850
"Hey, can you make a backdrop for me?"

12
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,310
She's like, "I got you."

13
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,230
And then two days ago, she sends me this.

14
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,566
[audience laughter]

15
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,568
Which feels less like alienation

16
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,863
and more like a second grade
speech therapist's office.

17
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,615
[audience laughter]

18
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,201
I'm like, "How am I supposed
to arrange these things?"

19
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,203
She's like, "Oh, you'll figure it out."

20
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,746
[audience laughter]

21
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,372
So, I'm going to be

22
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,000
talking to you guys...

23
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,170
all night, but,

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,009
I'm going to be preoccupied
with trying to satisfy her.

25
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,636
None of this should surprise me.

26
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,430
Is your life going smoothly?

27
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,933
[audience laughter]

28
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,727
Are you just floating from event to event,

29
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,480
feeling good about yourself?
'Cause I'm not.

30
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:50,527
Most interactions I have feel like
when you go to throw something away

31
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,530
and it's in one of those garbage cans
that's got a garbage hole,

32
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,615
a recycling hole, and a compost hole.

33
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,369
You do your best, but after you're like,
"I don't think I did that right."

34
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,870
[audience laughter]

35
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,916
That's how I feel most of the time.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,129
Going through life
feeling like I fucked up,

37
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,131
and I'm going to get in trouble.

38
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:15,760
I worry that my final thought on Earth,
on my deathbed, is going to be,

39
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,303
"Is that nurse mad at me?"

40
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,265
- [imitates flatline beep]
- [audience laughter]

41
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,606
These are technically the areas of my life

42
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,942
that make me feel like
something's wrong with me.

43
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,528
Some of them
are more important than others.

44
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,197
We can start small.
We'll start with dogs. Right?

45
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,951
So, I never had pets growing up, right?

46
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,538
But I watch videos of dogs
and they're so funny and loving,

47
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,665
and soldiers come back from overseas,

48
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,748
the dog's freaking out,
the soldier's freaking out,

49
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,378
the dog's fucking his face.
I'm like, you know what?

50
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,005
I should get a dog.

51
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,631
[audience laughter]

52
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,843
So I get a pit bull named Keith.

53
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,890
And um, everybody told me,
"Keith's going to be your best friend."

54
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,558
And I gotta say,

55
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,435
maybe my ninth-best friend.

56
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,687
[audience laughter]

57
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,439
Like, we're cool,

58
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,484
but whatever that thing is that opens up
between humans and animals

59
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,278
just never opened up.

60
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,779
And then I go,

61
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,200
"Do I not understand
human-dog relationships

62
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,828
or am I the <i>only </i>person
who understands human-dog relationships?"

63
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,165
'Cause everybody asks the same question,
"Is he a rescue?"

64
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,293
Yeah, they're all rescues.

65
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,378
[audience laughter]

66
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,173
None of these dogs
are thriving on their own.

67
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,258
[audience laughter]

68
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,678
Never heard a story like,
"Where'd you get your Labradoodle?"

69
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,431
"Went into Bank of America.
She was the manager."

70
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,808
[audience laughter]

71
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,897
"Now she's our full-time Labradoodle."

72
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,442
I shouldn't even say I rescued it.

73
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,486
People love patting
themselves on the back.

74
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,030
"We rescued it, saved it, adopted it."
No, you didn't.

75
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,199
Here's what happened
to your dog, my dog, every dog.

76
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,327
The dog was born into a litter,
kidnapped, given to you.

77
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,954
[audience laughter]

78
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,665
"No, Neal. You don't understand.
I'm a dog mom."

79
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,918
Really? You know who else was a dog mom?
That dog's mom.

80
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,003
[audience laughter]

81
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,838
[applause]

82
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,133
We think because we talk to dogs
like they're babies, they're babies.

83
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,344
They're not. They're our captives. Right?

84
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,097
But we think because we go,
"Are you a pretty girl?"

85
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,432
Pitch your voice down.
See what a monster you are.

86
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,892
"Are you a pretty girl?"

87
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,561
[audience laughter]

88
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,525
"We can go outside.
I have to put a chain around your neck."

89
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,235
[audience laughter]

90
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,029
"Do a trick for me.
I'll give you a tiny morsel of food."

91
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,489
[audience laughter]

92
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,991
"You're my best friend."

93
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,617
[audience laughter]

94
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,620
We try to make movies about it
romanticizing the relationship,

95
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,621
like <i>Marley & Me.</i>

96
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,581
You know what a dog sees in <i>Marley & Me</i>?

97
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,543
He sees <i>Taken,</i>
but Liam Neeson never shows up.

98
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,003
[audience laughter]

99
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,256
[sighs]

100
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,426
And, by the way, I think it's my fault.
Something's wrong with me.

101
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,679
Uh... So I'd read books
about loving dogs... Just...

102
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,685
Like, okay, so is this thing...
Is this for my LGBT joke?

103
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,062
Or is she trying to tell me
I'm on the spectrum?

104
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,606
[audience laughter]

105
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,237
Even groups you'd think
I'd feel like I'm a part of,

106
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,990
I don't feel like I'm a part of. Like...

107
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,241
liberals.

108
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,994
Clearly liberal.

109
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,913
Look at me. Bone-thin.

110
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,374
[audience laughter]

111
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,173
I look like Rachel Maddow with a beard.

112
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,425
[audience laughter]

113
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,344
But I don't feel like part of the group,

114
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,305
'cause liberals are
the least-welcoming people on the planet.

115
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,639
Republicans are having a blast.

116
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,017
Grabbing pussy,
shooting guns like <i>Westworld</i>.

117
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,478
[audience laughter]

118
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,356
Republicans get to be greedy.

119
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,234
Republicans care about themselves,
their families, rich people, that's it.

120
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,320
Liberals got to care about everybody.

121
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,697
Not fetuses. But everybody else.

122
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,032
Am I right, liberals?

123
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,200
[exclaiming]

124
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,535
Fuck a fetus. Who's with me, liberals?

125
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,704
[audience exclaiming]

126
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,916
I will punt a fetus
down Wilshire if I see one.

127
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,502
[audience laughter]

128
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,212
The problem being liberal

129
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,714
is there's no amount of liberal
that's liberal enough.

130
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,217
If there's a bunch of Republicans
and someone goes,

131
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,219
"I'm a Republican." They go, "Come on in."

132
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,430
If there's a bunch of liberals
and a liberal goes, "Hey, I'm liberal,"

133
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,140
they're like, "We'll see."

134
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,476
[audience laughter]

135
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,896
You can believe
the right shit as a liberal,

136
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,483
but if you express it incorrectly,
you're fucked. It's terrifying.

137
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,069
Ever try to talk about
transgender issues in public?

138
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,881
Even right now you're like,
"We don't gotta do this."

139
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,157
[audience laughter]

140
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,411
"Don't go out like your boy.
Just move on."

141
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,496
[audience laughter]

142
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,999
[audience cheering]

143
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,504
But that's exactly my point.
It's terrifying.

144
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,757
I'm sure we all believe the right shit,
but you ever...

145
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,218
Trying to talk about
transgender issues in public

146
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,387
is like playing conversational Jenga.

147
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,638
You're like...

148
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,183
"Pronouns..."

149
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,227
"He... They..."

150
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,395
Then Republicans are like,

151
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,289
- "Trannies? We'll call 'em trannies?"
- [thud]

152
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,023
[audience laughter]

153
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,905
"What happened here?
You guys playing Jenga?"

154
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,699
[audience laughter]

155
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,201
"I fucking love Jenga. Rack 'em up."

156
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,959
There's a lot of little
conundrums as a liberal, right?

157
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,920
Like, I live in Venice, California, in LA.

158
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:43,838
- [man whoops]
- Yeah.

159
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,882
And there's a lot of
homeless people in Venice.

160
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,302
But I'm from New York, so it's hard
to take LA homeless people seriously.

161
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,387
[audience laughter]

162
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,268
It's like once you work
with the best, you know?

163
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,395
[audience laughter]

164
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,940
So... So one day I get home,

165
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,902
and I got an... email.

166
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,111
Paper email.

167
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,738
A letter, we'll call it.

168
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,698
[audience laughter]

169
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,821
The letter says,
"We're opening a homeless shelter."

170
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,994
As a liberal, that's great.
I keep reading.

171
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,372
It says, "Across the street
from your house." I was like, "Oh shit."

172
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,332
[audience laughter]

173
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,044
It was like being on a game show
like <i>How Liberal Are You?</i>

174
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,546
- Like, "Uh..."
- [audience laughter]

175
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,674
"I wrote a Black TV show."

176
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,135
[audience laughter]

177
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,055
Yeah. My neighbors
want to protest and shit.

178
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,473
I'm not going to protest.

179
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,475
I'm going to move. But I'm not going to...

180
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,602
[audience laughter]

181
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,772
No, I didn't move.

182
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,358
They opened the shelter.
It's not bad. It's fine.

183
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,653
<i>How Liberal Are You? </i>would be
a funny game show, wouldn't it?

184
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,781
"You're at an airport
and a Muslim-looking man

185
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,450
asks you to watch
his luggage while he prays."

186
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,078
<i>How Liberal Are You?</i>

187
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,747
[audience laughter]

188
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,167
"Pass!"

189
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,253
[audience laughter]

190
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,592
You know who's a liberal conundrum,
as a person?

191
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,511
Kanye.

192
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,723
Yeah, 'cause when Kanye
first started, he said,

193
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,017
"George Bush doesn't care
about Black people."

194
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,287
Conservatives were like,
"He needs to shut the fuck up."

195
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,063
Liberals were like, "Let him speak."

196
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,023
Then he started saying
how much he liked Trump

197
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,609
and liberals were like,
"He does need to shut the fuck up."

198
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,444
[audience laughter]

199
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,281
People at this point
are just exhausted by Kanye.

200
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,700
People are like,
"That guy's fucking crazy."

201
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,702
Yeah. No kidding.

202
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,495
He's a rapper.

203
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,999
Since when do you rely on rappers
for their emotional stability?

204
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:43,958
[audience laughter]

205
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,628
What's your argument? "Back in my day,
there was a guy named Flavor Flav."

206
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,547
[audience laughter]

207
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,258
"And he'd walk around and say,
'You know what time it is!'"

208
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,511
"And we did know. He had
a fucking giant clock on his chest."

209
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,888
[audience laughter]

210
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,852
"There was another fella named DMX
who'd smoke crack and bark at people."

211
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,936
[audience laughter]

212
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,062
"He'd go..." [barks]

213
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,731
"And we knew where he stood."

214
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,816
[audience laughter]

215
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,988
"His bark was as good as his word."

216
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,406
[audience laughter]

217
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,033
"There was another named Eminem

218
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,993
who'd make albums
about murdering his wife."

219
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,412
"These are normal people
we are talking about."

220
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,834
This. Maybe she'll like this.

221
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,793
Yeah, guns.

222
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,171
I lose liberals on guns.

223
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:35,926
I would like to, before I talk about this,
say that I am afraid of guns,

224
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,512
but it turns out the cops are too.
[chuckles]

225
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,060
[audience cheering and applauding]

226
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,480
What's the lesson we're supposed
to learn from Uvalde? Right?

227
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,066
From Uvalde, Texas.
Are we supposed to just...

228
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,151
It's always got to be
a good guy with a gun?

229
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,028
That's the only way to stop it? Right?

230
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,406
Everyone... The whole country's
going to be good guys with guns.

231
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,617
Everywhere you go, "Freeze!" "You freeze!"

232
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,577
"I'm already frozen!" Just fucking...

233
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,663
[audience laughter]

234
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,875
Also, if it's up to us to stop guns,

235
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,920
you know, speeding kills
thousands of people every year.

236
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,838
Are we supposed to stop that too?

237
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,132
We're supposed to run them off the road?

238
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,802
If we see a speeder coming up,
"You know what they say,

239
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,525
the only thing that stops bad guy in a car
is a good guy in a car."

240
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,515
- Neew!
- [audience laughter]

241
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:32,191
Yeah, my problem with guns is I don't buy
either side's arguments completely.

242
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,319
So the conservative argument
is that guns are in the Constitution

243
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,197
because the Founding Fathers thought
if the citizens have guns

244
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,865
the government will do what they say

245
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,952
or else the people will rise up
and fight the government.

246
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,831
Which is a legitimately
great idea in the 1700s, but...

247
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,335
problem is, there's still people now
hoarding weapons

248
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,586
thinking that, at some point,

249
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,131
they may need to take on
the American military,

250
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,258
and they think they have a shot, right?

251
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,551
[audience laughter]

252
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,469
And look, maybe they're right,

253
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,472
which is why I'm proposing
we test their theory,

254
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,392
and once a year
have a head-to-head showdown.

255
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,770
[audience laughing, cheering]

256
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,274
Say 100 members of the NRA

257
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,609
versus, I don't know,
two members of the military.

258
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,027
[audience laughter]

259
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,572
Broadcast it on Fox, Christmas Day.

260
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,823
[audience laughter]

261
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:25,369
"Merry Christmas and welcome to
the 2022 NRA-Military Showdown."

262
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,956
"Let's go down to the field of battle,
meet one of our NRA combatants."

263
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,417
"What's your name? What kind of weapon?"

264
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,835
"My name's Andy Baker,

265
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,755
and I got an AR-15,
wearing Kevlar head-to-toe."

266
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,923
"How confident are you
on a scale of 1 to 10?"

267
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,633
"Fuckin' a million."

268
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,303
[audience laughter]

269
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,266
"We're going to check in
with the military."

270
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,977
They cut to one guy by himself,
in a bunker, and he's like,

271
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,313
"My name is Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Walker."

272
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,315
"What kind of weapon
are you working with?"

273
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:58,068
"I don't know if this is fair,
but I'm working with a drone."

274
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,613
[audience laughter]

275
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,411
"It's equipped with eight
Hellfire missiles

276
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,538
and a high-power camera."

277
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,667
"As you can see on this monitor,
the NRA fellas are in one big cluster."

278
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,086
[audience laughter]

279
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,131
"So, I'm going to..."

280
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,883
"We started? All right."

281
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,177
[audience laughter]

282
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,263
"Yeah, so I'm going to hit
this button right here."

283
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,973
[audience laughter]

284
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,643
"Yeah, now they're all dead."

285
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,602
[audience laughter]

286
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,272
"That'll do it for this year's
NRA-Military Showdown."

287
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,858
[audience cheering and clapping]

288
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,237
"Brought to you by

289
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,363
Whole Foods."

290
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,115
[audience laughter]

291
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,410
You know the NRA guys would be like,

292
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,955
"We can take 'em next year.
Just got to split up."

293
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,207
[audience laughter]

294
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,379
That's the conservative argument,
and the liberal argument is that,

295
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,383
uh, the gun stats in America
are just horrifying, right?

296
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:08,055
And they are on their face, right?
40,000 gun deaths a year. Which is awful.

297
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,851
But, you know what they never tell you?
You know how many of those are suicides?

298
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,938
Two-thirds are suicides.
No one ever knows that.

299
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,774
So whenever there's
a mass shooting on television,

300
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,986
which are legitimately tragic,
liberals always run on TV and say,

301
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,447
"We don't need mental health care.
We need common-sense gun control." No.

302
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,199
How about both? Right?

303
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,368
How about one question
at the point of sale?

304
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,537
Find out who's depressed, who isn't,

305
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,081
and two-thirds of gun deaths right there.

306
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,209
Guy comes in and they go,
"Before we sell you this weapon,

307
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,628
can we just look
at your browser history real quick?"

308
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,047
[audience laughter]

309
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,800
He goes, "Sir, you've been
listening to Lana Del Rey."

310
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,552
[audience laughter]

311
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:51,015
"And staring at pictures of your ex.
We're not going to give you a gun today,

312
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,225
but we are going to give you
a bag of mushrooms

313
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,895
and a copy of <i>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.</i>"

314
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,980
[audience laughter]

315
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,316
[audience clapping and cheering]

316
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,902
"You're gonna be back on your feet

317
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,237
and talking with your butt cheeks
in no time."

318
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,739
[audience laughter]

319
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:11,160
So now we're down to about
13,000 gun deaths a year,

320
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,620
which is atrocious.

321
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,829
But, by the way,

322
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,249
you know how many people the flu
kills in the average year? 50,000.

323
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,251
If you're worried
you'll be murdered by a gun,

324
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,545
think about how scared you are
of dying from the flu...

325
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,713
You're not.

326
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,424
...divide it by three,
and I'll meet you there.

327
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,179
By the way, do you see how I think myself
into isolated, asshole-y positions?

328
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,223
About everything
for as long as I can remember.

329
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,393
Even I hear myself sometimes
and I'm like, "Just shut the fuck up."

330
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,313
I got to be the only person
who was ever asked,

331
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,982
"Would you rather be right or happy?"
And I was like...

332
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:42,983
"Ugh..."

333
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,402
[audience laughter]

334
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,531
Something's wrong with me.

335
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,743
And, by the way, I work
against all my instincts with this.

336
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,163
You know, I give to every
liberal group you can think of.

337
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,289
I give to so many...

338
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,460
I give to an anti-capitalist group.
How fucking dumb is that?

339
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,088
And they have the balls
to hit me up for donations.

340
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,508
"Can we get another 100 bucks
for our anti-capitalism group?"

341
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,928
I'm like, "But you know how
I'm getting this money, don't you?"

342
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,681
[audience laughter]

343
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,686
Oh yeah.

344
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,983
Maybe you're thinking like,
"Neal, why don't you smoke some weed?"

345
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,111
"Chill the fuck out."
That's not up there 'cause I love weed.

346
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:32,032
That's up there 'cause I don't think
recreational drugs work on me right.

347
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,367
Like MDMA.

348
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,536
Molly, ecstasy, depending how old you are.

349
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,788
- [audience laughter]
- Uh...

350
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:42,084
I... I've done it seven or eight times.
Never worked on me once.

351
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,546
There's people whose brains don't respond
to MDMA. Guess I have one of those brains.

352
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,465
My friends do <i>not</i>
have one of those brains.

353
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,550
That was pretty awkward.

354
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,720
They're all rubbing each other's nipples,
and I'm just like... [fake laughter]

355
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,556
[audience laughter]

356
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,148
Yeah, and I don't think
weed works on me either.

357
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,401
Unless, is weed supposed to make
you violently paranoid for five minutes,

358
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,445
then you got to go to sleep? Is that weed?

359
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
[audience laughter]

360
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,531
'Cause in that case, bull's-eye.

361
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,952
I feel bad too because
we're living in the golden age of weed.

362
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:21,165
Weed is legal in so many places.
It's legal out here. Uh...

363
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,792
They sponsor comedy shows,

364
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,837
so I get bags and vapes and pipes.

365
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,590
I have so much weed
at my house that I cannot use,

366
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,634
I've become like an old lady
with a lemon tree in her backyard.

367
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm like, "Take some weed."

368
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,014
[audience laughter]

369
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,309
So weed's legal.

370
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,605
Shrooms just got legalized
in Denver, Oakland, all of Oregon.

371
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,440
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [audience cheering]

372
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,860
So there's going to be shroom stores.

373
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,780
You ready? You'll go to a shroom store
and go, "You open?"

374
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,698
"I don't know, are you open?"

375
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,576
[audience laughter]

376
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,663
I'm not mad at these drugs.

377
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,876
MDMA, psilocybin, weed
all passed the FDA hurdles for safety.

378
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,297
Uh, but you know what wouldn't pass
the FDA hurdles for safety?

379
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,217
Alcohol. For safety?

380
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,888
Like, if they tested out whiskey in a lab.

381
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,099
100 men, 100 women,
scientists dispensing it,

382
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,810
marking down the results,
they go to their boss.

383
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,937
"Sir, we did the whiskey test."

384
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,774
"Uh, first one or two drinks,
people seemed warm and happy."

385
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,985
"Then around the third drink,
a lot of the men became belligerent."

386
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,279
"The women were upset,

387
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,615
but they said
they didn't want to talk about it."

388
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,534
[audience laughter]

389
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,120
"And then a lot of people
vomited and passed out,

390
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,664
and everyone who drove home
crashed their car."

391
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,747
[audience laughter]

392
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,417
"That sounds awful."
"I know, here's the crazy part."

393
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,003
"They all want to
come back again on Saturday."

394
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,088
[audience laughter]

395
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,423
"They're wondering if we can hire a DJ."

396
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,511
"And two Israeli guys want to promote it.
Does that...?"

397
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,721
[audience laughter]

398
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,473
So clearly I'm not a big drinker.

399
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,686
The fucked-up thing about alcohol
is it gets so much good PR.

400
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,896
Ever since I was a kid, I've always heard,

401
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,898
"When you drink,
your real self comes out."

402
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,401
Which is true to a point.
Maybe one or two drinks.

403
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,736
But I've never looked
at one of my sloshed friends

404
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,363
and been, "There's the real Tony."

405
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,992
And they're, "Ugh!" [grunting]

406
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,827
"Fuck you guys!"

407
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,413
"That is his God-given essence,
right there."

408
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,999
[exclaims]

409
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,670
The real Tony has to piss on the street.

410
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,755
[audience laughter]

411
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,137
Yeah, not a big drinker. Not a big smoker.

412
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,430
People don't like it.

413
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,683
It is good for me.
Not drinking and smoking.

414
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,978
I know it's good for me
because when I tell people at parties,

415
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,606
they say, "Good for you,"
right before they walk away.

416
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,691
[audience laughter]

417
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,277
But alcohol is hard.

418
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,948
It's a tough issue for me 'cause I grew up
with an alcoholic dad, right?

419
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:04,828
Uh... and, you know, people love alcohol,
and women are people.

420
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,913
So...

421
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,165
[audience laughter]

422
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,958
Admit it.

423
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,168
Um...

424
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,921
And so dating is tough

425
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,798
because I don't want to be a drink cop,

426
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,344
but at the same time,
it can be a little triggering.

427
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,181
Sometimes it's fine.
Other times it's like, "Mmm, trauma."

428
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,434
- Um...
- [audience laughing and clapping]

429
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,896
Yeah, but I don't know
what I can ask for within this, right?

430
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,315
Like, I just don't know what's...

431
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,235
I go, "Who am I to tell her not to drink?"

432
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,779
"As someone who's
trying to protect themselves?"

433
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,862
"From what?"

434
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,408
"I don't know, a negative emotional
experience? The smell of alcohol?"

435
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,828
"Are you not fucking over that?
How are you not fucking over that?"

436
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,667
So I've just got this negative tape
running in my head

437
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,544
about that and pretty much
most things in my life.

438
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,548
I have a very...
I got a bad inner monologue.

439
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,968
I wrote it down one time,
and as soon as I saw it,

440
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,719
I was like, I got to erase this.

441
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,932
Because if any of my friends know
that someone's talking to me like this,

442
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,308
they're going to be pissed.

443
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,645
But meanwhile,
it was an inside job, you know?

444
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:17,484
You ever look back on your life
and think the way you are is inevitable?

445
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,572
If you don't know much about me,
I'm the youngest of ten kids,

446
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,950
which is... too many.

447
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,034
Right?

448
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,579
Both my parents were born
during the Great Depression,

449
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,915
and they were nice enough
to bring it with them.

450
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,835
[audience laughter]

451
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,383
Yeah, so both my parents
brought that energy to their union,

452
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:45,762
and it was just a lot of chaos and alcohol

453
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,514
and law and order.

454
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:51,101
Like, a lot of violence. My earliest...

455
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:55,772
One of my earliest memories of life
is watching my teenage brother

456
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,733
fistfight my dad on the front lawn.

457
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,402
It's like, "Okay, so this is life."

458
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,737
Um...

459
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,114
Yeah, just so many rules.
Just constant rules.

460
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,410
There were so many rules that eventually
my mother wrote the important ones down

461
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:13,081
and stuck them on the wall of the kitchen,
like you'd see at a steel factory.

462
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,459
My friend actually put them on here.

463
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,711
I'll tell you about some of them.

464
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,632
Bunch of TV rules,
which I guess makes sense.

465
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,219
A lot of laundry rules.
My mother was laundry-room crazy.

466
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,639
Um, if you left your clothes
in the laundry room for too long,

467
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,808
my mother would confiscate your clothes.

468
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,895
Disappeared, Khmer Rouge-style.

469
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:35,979
[audience chuckling]

470
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,522
Never to be seen again.

471
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,441
Although one year for Christmas,

472
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,694
my sister Anne
did get a keychain, a candle,

473
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,030
and a box of her old clothes back, so...

474
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,908
Merry Christmas, Anne. Why are you crying?

475
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,618
[audience laughter]

476
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,869
A lot of sandwich rules.

477
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,330
You guys probably
all had sandwich rules, right?

478
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,791
[audience laughter]

479
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,337
We had to make all of...
There were too many of us.

480
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,298
We couldn't all make sandwiches
every morning before school,

481
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,343
so we'd have to make them
in bulk on the weekend

482
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,261
and then stick them in the freezer.

483
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,556
And then on the way to school,
we grabbed one of our sandwiches.

484
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,601
You're thinking that must not have
made for very fresh sandwiches,

485
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,229
but you're forgetting
a more important piece of information.

486
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,607
Sandwiches don't always thaw
between 8:00 a.m. and lunchtime.

487
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,942
[audience laughter]

488
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,695
In those cases, we'd eat around the edges
like rats on a pirate ship.

489
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,781
[audience laughter]

490
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,828
So, pretty much the <i>Gilmore Girls</i>
is what I'm saying.

491
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,998
Yeah, so I grew up Catholic. Anybody else?

492
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,126
[cheering]

493
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,378
Yeah, I did all the Catholic milestones.

494
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,463
Baptism, First Holy Communion,

495
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,090
Confirmation, atheism.

496
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,007
Right?

497
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,802
[audience laughter]

498
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,596
[applause]

499
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,350
I shouldn't even say I'm an atheist.

500
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,645
Let's say I'm agnostic
about my atheism, right?

501
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,149
Atheists are such
smug hypocrites, by the way.

502
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,027
Atheists will be like,
"You pray to a god? That's so silly."

503
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,238
"Can I show you
my vision board real quick?"

504
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,323
[audience laughter]

505
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,246
I know a lot of white atheists.
I don't know many Black atheists.

506
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,831
Not none, just not many.

507
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,667
I got a theory about why
there's not many Black atheists.

508
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,751
Here goes.

509
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,799
Atheism is really like
the height of white privilege.

510
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,137
It really is. Religion says,
"Can we interest you in an afterlife?"

511
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,556
And white people
are like, "No, thank you." [chuckles]

512
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,267
[audience laughter]

513
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,272
"How much better could it be?"

514
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,357
[audience laughter]

515
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,278
"I'll just take my supplements
and see what happens."

516
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,658
White privilege has had
a big couple years, huh?

517
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,659
Yeah.

518
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,079
The Cauckies, the Caucasians.

519
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,248
[audience laughter]

520
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,876
Cauckies were blindsided in 2020.

521
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,462
They were just caught unawares, right?

522
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,339
I was talking to a white lady.

523
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:11,426
She says, "I had no idea things were so
bad between Black people and the police."

524
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,013
I was like, "There's no way you could've,
unless you listen to any song

525
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,848
by a Black person, ever."

526
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,058
[audience laughter]

527
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,603
Like, what do you think
"Fuck tha Police" was about, lady?

528
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,525
"I didn't think it was <i>all</i> police.
I thought it was one precinct."

529
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,070
How about Bob Marley's
"I Shot the Sheriff"?

530
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,532
"I know, but he didn't
shoot the deputy, so..."

531
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,408
[audience laughter]

532
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,872
I like the white privilege
that's hiding in plain sight.

533
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,625
You know what's
a white privilege thing that's hiding?

534
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,503
A lot of American city names
are white privilege.

535
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,422
Like Chicago, Milwaukee,
those are Native American words.

536
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,674
West Coast is wild.

537
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,218
San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego.

538
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,513
Spanish names. Ever think about
why they're Spanish? Well...

539
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,684
'Cause we jacked
the motherfuckers from Mexico,

540
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,103
didn't even bother changing the names.

541
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,354
[audience laughter]

542
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,023
That is some ice-cold
white privilege shit.

543
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,193
That'd be like if your boy Pete
had a girlfriend for years.

544
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,194
"Pete's girl."

545
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,655
Then you steal her,
take her to a party, you're like,

546
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,699
"You know my girl Pete's girl, don't you?"

547
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,243
[audience laughter]

548
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,540
"You thirsty, baby?
Get Pete's girl a drink, would you?"

549
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,587
"I got you a necklace with
your initials on it. PG. Pete's girl."

550
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,926
You know what's white privilege?
Joking about race. That's white privilege.

551
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,847
'Cause as a white person,
it just bounces right off. Right?

552
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,057
I know the funniest,
meanest Black dudes in the world.

553
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,810
They'll be like,
"White people can't dance. No rhythm."

554
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,771
I'll be like, "Who needs rhythm
when you own the record label?"

555
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,108
[audience laughter]

556
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,077
[audience continues laughing]

557
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,708
Am I TikToking? Be honest. Is this TikTok?

558
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,335
[audience laughter]

559
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,465
A lot of Cauckies ask me, they go, "Neal..."

560
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,178
"Neal, I'm a good Cauckie. What can I do?"

561
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:24,100
"How can I combat white privilege?"
Acknowledge it as it's happening to you.

562
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,727
This happened to me recently.

563
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,772
I got pulled over doing 73 in a 35.

564
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,856
So it was tight.

565
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,275
[audience laughter]

566
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,778
And white cop.
I get my license and registration.

567
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,490
He's back running my plates,
and I'm sitting there going,

568
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,784
"I deserve whatever. A fine or a ticket."

569
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,079
"Whatever I'm going to get,
I totally deserve." He comes back.

570
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,498
He's like,
"I'll let you off with a warning."

571
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,041
I'm like, no, that's fucked up.

572
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,503
'Cause I know my Black or brown friends
would at least be getting a ticket.

573
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,506
I gotta say something. I was like,
"Don't be stupid. He's a cop."

574
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,633
I was like, "No, now's the time."
And I said,

575
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,635
"Thanks, officer.
It's been a white privilege."

576
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,137
[audience laughter]

577
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,769
He said, "The privilege is all white."
What the fuck?

578
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,854
[audience laughter]

579
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,699
Race is another one of these issues
that's a weird one for me,

580
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,868
'cause it's had
an oddly big effect on my life.

581
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,747
Not anywhere near a person of color,
but 50 times the average Cauckie.

582
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,249
- Uh...
- [audience chuckles]

583
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:34,170
And I'm good at writing racial jokes,
and I'm like, is it my place to tell them?

584
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,798
Like, if they fall into the wrong hands...

585
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,441
Like, that "who needs rhythm
when you own the record label" joke,

586
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,177
that would crush at a Klan rally.

587
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,261
Crush.

588
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,848
[audience laughter]

589
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,558
You can hear it.

590
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,602
"So I said, 'Who needs rhythm
when you own the record label?'"

591
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,396
"Good night. My name's Jedediah."

592
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,732
[audience laughter]

593
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,609
So it's like,
should I not tell the jokes in public?

594
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,863
Like, I know what
my intentions are, but, like,

595
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:04,159
who gives a shit what my intentions are
if they're... misinterpreted?

596
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,705
Pretty accessible comedy show, huh, folks?

597
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,789
[audience laughter]

598
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,751
I'm in a tiny theater,
moralizing about race.

599
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,586
Meanwhile, Kevin Hart's in an arena,

600
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,756
"I tell you about the time I went
to Egypt and a camel bit me in the dick?"

601
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,508
[audience laughter]

602
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,139
Something...

603
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,391
Something's wrong with me.

604
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,438
Oh, you know what?

605
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,398
I think this is a woman's shoe.

606
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,151
You might be thinking like,

607
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:43,323
"Neal, if you got married and had kids
some of your... alienation might dissipate."

608
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,992
Maybe. I don't know.

609
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,538
Never been married.
Don't have kids. 48 years old.

610
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,040
People don't like it.

611
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,459
[audience laughter]

612
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,795
It's worse for women
if you're over a certain age.

613
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,464
Not married, no kids, people pity you.

614
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,632
But as a guy,

615
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,634
people are suspicious.

616
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,219
[audience laughter]

617
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:08,723
I would get more trust from women
if I'd been married and murdered my wife.

618
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,267
[audience laughter]

619
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,479
They'd be like, "He's capable of love.
He gets too passionate."

620
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,815
[audience laughter]

621
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,067
"Also, he's not
going to murder two people."

622
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,485
[audience laughter]

623
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,569
Cute.

624
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,950
Yeah, it's not... I've...
I've been in long-term relationships.

625
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,701
Been in love a few times.

626
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,954
It just never got to marriage.

627
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,330
It just never got there.

628
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:37,877
These are big risks,
these relationships, 'cause... 'cause...

629
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,257
You're basically just doing
a daily trust fall with somebody, right?

630
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,385
Every day you'd be like,
"Okay. Your turn. Okay, here we go."

631
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,262
Aah!

632
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,098
"Oh my God, this is so fun. Do me."

633
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,685
"Okay, here we go. I got you."

634
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,478
Aah!

635
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,273
"Oh my God, I feel so connected to you.
We're so lucky."

636
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,692
"Do me again." Aah!

637
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,775
[thud]

638
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,783
I've hurt people as the catcher,
and I've been hurt as the faller.

639
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,536
They both suck for different reasons.

640
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,705
The thing with these relationships is,

641
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:17,959
you just have to believe in each other
and assure one another, like,

642
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,335
"We both feel the same way."

643
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,131
"I feel the same about you as you do me.
We're connected, we're connected."

644
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,466
And then a certain point,
they look at you and go,

645
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,343
"Oh, I've been pretending."

646
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,763
"We're... we're... we're not connected."

647
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,100
And then you have to
parse the relationship

648
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,020
to try to figure out
when they started pretending.

649
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,188
And then eventually accept the fact that

650
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:43,401
some of the most cherished memories
of your life may have been a grift.

651
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,031
Shit's breathtaking.

652
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,700
I judge myself a lot for this.

653
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,620
This is where I'm like,
"Something really is wrong with you."

654
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,081
You know, other comedians judge me for it.
I was talking to a comedian friend.

655
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,084
He's like, "You'd be more popular
if you were married with kids."

656
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,669
I said, "Why?" And he's like,

657
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,463
"The audience trusts you more

658
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,965
if you're married with kids
'cause you're moral."

659
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,217
"You put other people ahead of you."

660
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,803
Uh, which I've legally never done.

661
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,349
I have a dog.

662
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,101
You're like, "Which one?
The one you don't love?" Fuck you guys.

663
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,187
[audience laughter]

664
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,023
I'm not telling you shit anymore.

665
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,444
But I get how, as an audience member,
you trust comedians more

666
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,572
if they're married with kids.
I do have one follow-up question.

667
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,158
How is Bill Cosby's marriage? Any word?

668
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,494
[audience cheering]

669
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,747
Is Louis C.K. still happily married?

670
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,375
He's fucking hilarious.
He must be married.

671
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,545
I had one more, and I need
you guys to give it to me straight.

672
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,297
John Mulaney?

673
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,050
[audience exclaiming]

674
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,263
Don't fucking "oh" me.
I went to the goddamn wedding.

675
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,140
[audience laughter]

676
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,266
Yeah.

677
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,354
I don't know what you spent.
I had to fly across country, rent a car.

678
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,189
They're like, "Wanna upgrade for $30?"

679
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,025
I'm like, "It's Mulaney's wedding.
Let's blow it out."

680
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,362
Cut to me in a PT Cruiser
going, "<i>Was</i> this an upgrade?"

681
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,698
[audience laughter]

682
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,912
Well, at least Woody Allen's
marriage is still flourishing, huh?

683
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,039
[audience clapping]

684
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,793
Did you see that documentary?

685
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,087
<i>Allen v. Farrow?</i>

686
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,464
Uh, they lay out the case
pretty conclusively

687
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,010
that before he married
his stepdaughter Soon-Yi,

688
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,053
he molested his other stepdaughter.

689
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,890
And I got to say, it's probably
my least favorite Woody Allen movie.

690
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,143
[audience laughter]

691
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:46,524
My failure in relationships
is not for lack of trying, I swear to God.

692
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:50,236
Like, I've done different approaches,

693
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,780
love language, attachment style.

694
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,075
Age, race, weight, job.

695
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,952
I dated a model. Thank you.

696
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,663
[audience laughter]

697
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,752
Guys, dating a model
is like owning a dune buggy.

698
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,800
Dating a model's like owning a dune buggy
'cause at the beach, it's great.

699
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,803
But everywhere else, you're like,
"I shouldn't have brought you here."

700
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,514
[audience laughter]

701
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,185
[audience cheering]

702
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,443
By the way, this is all
going to be heterosexual.

703
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:34,072
Like, I don't have any gay insights.
Never been gay.

704
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,573
I check once a year.

705
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,575
[audience laughter]

706
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,452
I do. If you're honest, check once a year.

707
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,914
I go on Pornhub, I click the "gay" button,
and I go, "Anything?"

708
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,373
"All right, back to women."

709
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,875
[audience laughter]

710
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,546
While I haven't been gay,
I have experienced a ton of homophobia

711
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,048
'cause I have a bidet.

712
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,426
[audience laughter]

713
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,013
My straight guy friends will be like,
"Can't do it, bro."

714
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,809
"Can't have water shooting up my ass."
Are you worried about...

715
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:07,105
Look, if the only thing keeping you
from being gay is water hitting your ass...

716
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,357
[audience laughter]

717
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,817
...you are gay.

718
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,986
[audience laughter]

719
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,533
Just be gay.

720
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,410
Come on over, take a ride on the pony,
start your new life.

721
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,625
That's how rudimentary guys'
understanding of our sexuality is.

722
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,086
We're like,
"I just got to protect the flag."

723
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,132
"And everything's the same."

724
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:38,302
Fellas, no, you don't. I'm 48.
The flag's been violated or whatever.

725
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,304
I've had a couple fingers in the butt.

726
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,932
From women. Nothing happened.

727
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,352
Nothing changed.
I wasn't like, "My identity!"

728
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,813
[audience laughter]

729
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,816
"Everything I thought I was!"

730
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,901
[audience laughter]

731
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,946
"Turn off <i>Rogan</i>, turn on <i>Drag Race</i>."

732
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,990
[audience laughter]

733
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,218
You know what the first thing
that always left in my relationships?

734
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:10,334
Uh, appreciation for one another. Right?
It happens in most relationships.

735
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,212
We stop appreciating each other.
Women start thinking,

736
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,506
"Men are so thoughtless and stupid."

737
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,634
And men think, "Women are so fussy
and high-maintenance."

738
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,802
And we're both right.

739
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,514
Women, you are fussy and high-maintenance.
You know what else?

740
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,433
They're sophisticated and elegant,

741
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,269
and can make emotional
connections including, get this,

742
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,854
direct eye contact.

743
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,815
Women's spirit is just elevating.

744
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,235
They can transform a room
with their presence and energy.

745
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,154
I'm thankful there's women here tonight.

746
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,198
If there were no women
here tonight, fellas,

747
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,910
with just all dudes
in a dark room staring at me...

748
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,620
[audience laughter]

749
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,246
...you know what the energy would be?

750
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,040
Proud Boys, and you know it.

751
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,042
[audience laughter]

752
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,503
Just a bunch of guys
in cut-off leather gloves

753
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:58,382
and wearing their horrible sunglasses
like this for some reason.

754
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,010
[audience laughter]

755
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,644
And women,

756
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,355
you think men
are thoughtless and stupid, and we are.

757
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,149
But you know what else we are?

758
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,651
Fucking hilarious.

759
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,446
[audience laughing and applauding]

760
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,323
We are. We're very funny.

761
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,078
Women are beautifully constructive,
and men are hilariously destructive.

762
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,204
Right?

763
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,041
If you ever go to an all-women's event,
it's just a bunch of women

764
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,293
making eye contact
and drinking white wine.

765
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,045
[makes high-pitched sound]

766
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,839
Eventually you're like,
"I gotta get the fuck out of here." Right?

767
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,842
But usually guys show up
to kind of ground the energy,

768
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,137
and we're there, we're trying to...
We're always trying to impress.

769
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,640
We're buying you shit,
we're break dancing...

770
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,808
[audience laughter]

771
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,644
...doing magic tricks, backflips.

772
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,105
We're telling stories with sound effects.

773
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,376
"Then I punched him in the stomach." Pssh!
Then he took out a machine gun." Trrrr!

774
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,778
I've never heard a woman
do a sound effect in my entire life.

775
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,948
[audience applauds]

776
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:13,082
Noises... Like birds' chirps, meows,
shit you could do.

777
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,669
We're always trying to make you laugh.

778
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,422
We got funny mean
nicknames for our friends.

779
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,258
"This is Mike, aka Boner Mike."

780
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,509
[audience laughter]

781
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,803
"Aka Illiterate Mike."

782
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,933
I never heard a woman be like,
"This is Sarah, aka Barren Sarah."

783
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,686
[audience laughter]

784
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,942
"She's so dry down there,
we call her Sahara."

785
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,028
[audience laughter]

786
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,282
[audience laughing and whopping]

787
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,411
- [audience laughter]
- [sniffles]

788
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:56,542
I just don't have any like,
real innate skill for being a boyfriend.

789
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,129
Like, I'm thankful that
there's not an entrance exam

790
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,007
to become a boyfriend
'cause I would fail that shit miserably.

791
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,593
The woman would
come with the results. "All right."

792
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,179
"We're not going to pass you.
I think you knew that."

793
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,847
[audience laughter]

794
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,808
"Couple areas in which you didn't do well,
one of them was listening."

795
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,478
"Um, question was,
'If you're watching basketball on TV

796
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,248
and your girlfriend needed
to speak to you, how would you handle it?'

797
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,857
We were looking for, 'Turn the TV off,

798
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,984
and ask what was going on, '
but you wrote down,

799
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,986
'I'd turn the TV up.'

800
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,529
[audience laughter]

801
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,908
'And say, "I can't talk right now, babe.
It's the first quarter,

802
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,410
which is one of
the most important quarters."'

803
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,496
[audience laughter]

804
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,583
"You also did poorly
in conflict resolution."

805
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,669
"The question was, 'If she had
an issue with something you did,

806
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,880
how would you deal with it?'
And you wrote down,

807
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,674
'I'd think of a time
she did something similar,

808
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,553
and say, "See, bitch? Now we're even."'

809
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,264
[audience laughter]

810
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,771
Back to the apps for you, my friend.

811
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,023
Yeah, something's wrong with me, like...

812
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,152
The other thing I'm not dying
to get into with relationships

813
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,612
is the power dynamic.

814
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:11,534
'Cause I feel like men had all the power
for 400,000 years, give or take.

815
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,079
And about six years ago,
women were like, "May we?"

816
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,206
[audience laughter]

817
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,709
I shouldn't say men have no power.
I should be more specific.

818
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,462
Liberal white men
have no power in relationships.

819
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,341
At this period in history,
as a liberal white man,

820
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,761
you now have to go to protests
against myself. Understand?

821
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,847
[audience laughter]

822
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,685
I...

823
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,728
[applause]

824
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,440
When the George Floyd protests
broke out, I was like,

825
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,650
"I'll get my sign
from the Women's March. Here."

826
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,485
"I am the problem!"

827
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,696
[audience laughter]

828
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,743
I went to the Women's March.
It was inspiring on the one hand,

829
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,288
and I also saw
the funniest thing I've ever seen, right?

830
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,249
So, inspiring, 400,000 women,

831
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:04,920
their husbands, boyfriends, sons, dads,
all together, marching for a cause.

832
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,130
That was incredible.

833
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,841
And then I also saw
the funniest shit ever, uh...

834
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,260
We all had signs that we made, right?

835
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,263
And there was another guy there,
and he had a sign that said,

836
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,850
"This is what a feminist looks like,"
with an arrow pointing at him.

837
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,144
He and I are walking along,
we make eye contact,

838
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,104
the guy looks up at his sign and goes...

839
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:28,027
[audience laughter]

840
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,699
So we'll see what happens.

841
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,162
- [audience chuckling]
- [man] Oh, my God.

842
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,413
[chuckling]

843
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,833
Yeah, I've dated a lot of women
that were correctors.

844
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,920
I had two different girlfriends
in my life say in front of me,

845
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,296
"I trained him."

846
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,423
[audience muttering]

847
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,383
"I taught him." Yeah.

848
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,678
Ever hear a guy say that?
No, 'cause you don't know any pimps.

849
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,306
[audience laughter]

850
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,891
[chuckling] Yeah.

851
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:02,353
And you do teach us shit, women,
but it's never shit we want to know.

852
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,604
Shit you want us to know.

853
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,524
Never had a girlfriend be like,
"Let me show you how to choke a wolf."

854
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,151
[audience laughter]

855
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,407
It's always girly shit
that you want us to know,

856
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,368
and then we go,
[in squeaky voice] "Oh yeah."

857
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,161
[audience laughter]

858
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,499
That's the sound of a guy learning shit
he does not care about in the slightest.

859
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,959
"Oh yeah."

860
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,753
[audience laughter]

861
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,296
"Duvet cover, yeah."

862
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,174
[audience laughter]

863
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,428
"Yeah, a blanket
should have its own pouch."

864
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,598
[audience laughter]

865
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,435
"Thank you, babe."

866
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:50,568
Happens to all guys, all over the world.
Age, race, class. Doesn't matter.

867
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,487
We all know what happened
with Meghan Markle and Harry Potter.

868
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,905
Right? Is that his name?

869
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,115
[audience laughter]

870
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,198
We know what happened.

871
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,451
She came home and was like,
"I know we're in England,

872
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,095
you're a prince, but your family sucks,

873
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,247
so let's go to America
and you're a fucking nobody."

874
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,373
And he was like...

875
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,499
"Oh yeah."

876
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,876
[audience laughter]

877
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,966
"Fuck a thousand years of tradition.
Thanks, babe."

878
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,930
So much in relationships is luck.

879
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,349
That's the thing
nobody talks about. It's luck.

880
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,101
So this is the thing I looked up.

881
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,186
So there's a one-in-eight chance

882
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,439
that you will marry somebody
you're dating.

883
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,317
There's a 50-50 chance
the marriage will work.

884
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,610
So, in essence,

885
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,614
there is a 6% chance that you'll be
in an everlasting loving relationship

886
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:40,034
with someone you're dating,
even if they're great and you're great.

887
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,202
6%. That's luck.

888
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,205
And I know I need
to pause the show right now

889
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,416
and let all the guys
that are here on dates

890
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,461
look at your lady and let her know
that you guys are the exception.

891
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,047
- [audience laughter]
- [man] Whoo!

892
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,508
You're going all the way. I get it.

893
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,094
But 6%. It's luck, right?

894
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,555
Even if I'm wrong it's 9, but it's 6.

895
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,058
It's luck. We're all...

896
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,645
We all judge each other
for our failures at relationships.

897
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,688
We judge ourselves.
We should have empathy.

898
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,776
We're all basically just fans
at an NBA game taking a half-court shot.

899
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,029
When those fans miss the shot,
everyone goes, "Aww!"

900
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,781
They don't go, "Fuck you!"

901
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,865
[audience laughter]

902
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,326
"Think about why you missed that shot."

903
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,454
"Start with your relationship with
your mother and go forward from there."

904
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,539
[audience laughter]

905
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,044
And then, babies.

906
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,255
I'm not anti-baby.

907
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,883
[audience chuckles]

908
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,218
I'm anti-fetus.

909
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,928
Y'all know I'm anti-fetus.

910
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,013
[audience laughter]

911
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,935
I fucking hate fetuses.
I fucking hate them.

912
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,062
I wish a fetus would step to me.

913
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,980
[audience laughter]

914
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:57,569
Yeah, so, I gotta... I've just never
looked down and been like,

915
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,154
"I should reproduce this."

916
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,990
"Run it back. Let's go."

917
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,828
You know what TV show
made me wary of having kids?

918
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,914
You guys ever see
that show, the nightly news?

919
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,458
[audience laughter]

920
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,211
Alright, climate change is a nightmare.

921
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,454
We're already double
what Earth's population should be.

922
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,383
I can't remember
this much anger or division in my life.

923
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,177
Having a kid right now would be like
being at a house party,

924
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,847
it's packed with people,
you can't move, roof's on fire,

925
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,266
basement's flooding, cops are coming,

926
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,977
you look at your friend and you're like,
"We should invite Brian."

927
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,564
[audience laughter]

928
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,694
The problem is I gotta tell women
on first dates I won't have babies.

929
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,320
I guess I don't have to.

930
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,156
It just seems nicer, right?

931
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,244
Because women have
weird timing with that shit.

932
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,747
I was on a date with a girl
and she's like, "I am 40."

933
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,390
"I need to start thinking about
who I'm going to have kids with."

934
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,042
I was like, "<i>Start</i> thinking?"

935
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,712
[audience laughter]

936
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,797
"Miss, we may be down to minutes."

937
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,925
[audience laughter]

938
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:09,558
Yeah, I got to tell women on first dates
that I don't want to have kids.

939
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,518
People don't like it.

940
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,147
Telling a woman on a first date
is like going to a job interview

941
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,857
and being like, "Just so you know,

942
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,776
I don't fuck with computers."

943
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,696
[audience laughter]

944
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,452
"How do you want to do this?"

945
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,042
Maybe it's luck. Maybe it's timing.

946
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:39,505
Or, you know, could be both.
Or maybe it's <i>me.</i>

947
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,465
Maybe something's wrong with me.

948
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:45,928
Maybe I'm too cranky, or wounded,
or misogynistic.

949
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,138
Or something I don't even know I am.

950
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,681
You know what I realized?

951
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,849
[woman] It's not you.

952
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:51,934
It's not me?

953
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,063
Well, good. Let's end the show.
Good night, everybody.

954
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,941
- [audience laughter]
- [chuckles]

955
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,195
Women, do you see
the kind of belief I'm looking for?

956
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,279
Just a little?

957
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:10,035
Yeah, like, I had
the thought recently that

958
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:14,206
I don't think I can guarantee
a woman's emotional safety.

959
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,460
And I'm not sure she could guarantee mine.

960
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,964
I wish that were not the case,
but that's just how I feel.

961
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,759
And people go,
"Well, don't you get lonely?"

962
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,718
Yeah.

963
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:30,514
But also, I've never been lonelier
than in a relationship

964
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,057
I didn't want to be in.

965
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,935
[audience applauds]

966
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,022
And then with kids...

967
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,652
You know, I say it's climate change...

968
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,196
It's not. Secret, it's not.

969
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,782
[audience laughter]

970
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:53,161
I say it's all that stuff,
but it's about the emotional connection

971
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:57,207
'cause I don't want the kid
to come out, and I don't feel it.

972
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,418
We all know what happened with Keith.

973
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,628
[audience laughter]

974
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,381
And more importantly, my dad had ten kids,

975
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,300
didn't love any of us, right?

976
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:11,763
So I don't want to... I'm half him,
so I could repeat that all over again.

977
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,016
And people are like,
"You'd be such a good dad."

978
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,894
I'd be a good Marine too.
I don't want to be a Marine.

979
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:25,027
Like, people go, "Well, try." It's not...

980
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,111
"Take the leap."

981
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,530
It's not my risk, it's their risk.

982
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,824
They bear all the risk, right?

983
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,578
'Cause if you're born
with a parent who doesn't love you,

984
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,539
you spend your whole life
thinking something's wrong with you.

985
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,752
I...

986
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:45,797
I also got to say, I really resent
the pressure we're all under to do it.

987
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,633
I really resent it. Right?

988
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,552
There's dozens of new gender
and sexual orientations.

989
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,846
There's still only one
relationship orientation.

990
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,598
Toward marriage.

991
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,016
"What about polyamory?"

992
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,435
There's no tax cuts
for polyamory. Stop it.

993
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,275
But people are really impressed with like,

994
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,486
"We got married and signed a license."

995
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,821
"A marriage license? How'd you do it?"

996
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,282
[audience laughter]

997
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,453
A legal yoke isn't that impressive to me.

998
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,414
You know what I mean?
What's more meaningful?

999
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,707
A bird in a cage?

1000
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,544
Or a bird that flies away every day
and comes back

1001
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,172
just 'cause they like
being birds with you?

1002
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,007
Isn't that better?

1003
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,928
[audience applauds]

1004
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,430
People say stuff like, "Well..."

1005
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,517
Just the dumb shit.
"If you don't marry her,

1006
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,311
you won't be able to visit her
in the hospital after hours."

1007
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,064
[audience laughter]

1008
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,736
I will if I give security 40 bucks.

1009
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,698
[audience laughter]

1010
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,291
There you go, bird.

1011
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:09,089
Also, you ever ask
married people how it is?

1012
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,426
[audience laughter]

1013
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,345
The answers may shock you.

1014
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,056
By the way, it's not just men.

1015
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,933
Ask a woman how marriage is,

1016
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,228
women sound like a politician
ducking a hot-button issue.

1017
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,148
"Lisa, how are things with you and Mike?"

1018
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,899
And she's like, "Kids are great."

1019
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,194
[audience laughter]

1020
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,073
And you ask guys how the marriage is,

1021
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,701
guys sound like
they're reading a hostage letter.

1022
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,621
"Mike, how are things
with you and Lisa?" And he's like,

1023
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,456
"Hello."

1024
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,251
[audience laughter]

1025
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,628
"I am happy."

1026
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,840
[audience laughter]

1027
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,718
"Do not worry about me."

1028
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,220
[audience laughter]

1029
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,847
"Worry about yourself...

1030
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,515
[audience laughter]

1031
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,392
...and your heathen lifestyle."

1032
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,853
[audience laughter]

1033
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,855
"She has taught me so much...

1034
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,440
[audience laughter]

1035
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,650
...and made me a better man."

1036
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,570
And she's in the corner like ISIS like,

1037
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,530
"Tell him about the duvet cover."

1038
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:19,534
[audience laughing and applauding]

1039
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,501
"Oh yeah."

1040
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,753
[audience laughter]

1041
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,547
This is fun.

1042
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,175
It's just fun to be out, right?

1043
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:39,262
Do you know what one of the upsides
of COVID might be, I hope,

1044
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,808
is uh, empathy
for mental health stuff, right?

1045
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,268
'Cause everybody was isolated.

1046
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,271
And human beings
don't do well with isolation.

1047
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,232
We've still got cave brains.

1048
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,150
So we think if we're isolated

1049
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,820
that the tribe is rejecting us,

1050
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,281
and then we start
picking away at ourselves

1051
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,076
and finding faults that aren't there and...

1052
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,246
Basically, our mental health declines.

1053
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:07,457
So I hope in the future that people
have empathy when someone says,

1054
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:11,461
"I'm depressed or anxious,"
they'll go, "Yeah, I remember that."

1055
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,673
Because for a lot of us,
we've felt isolated our whole lives.

1056
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,843
And the other thing I'll say,
one of the things

1057
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:23,056
I didn't mind about COVID was that
we could all just chill a bit with work.

1058
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,100
We could put the sword down a little bit.

1059
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,561
If you achieved something
during COVID, cool.

1060
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,979
If not, also cool.

1061
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:33,775
The only people who accomplished
anything during COVID to me were

1062
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,235
Bo Burnham...

1063
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,821
[audience laughter]

1064
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,491
Amazon.com,

1065
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,787
and the 1998 Chicago Bulls. Somehow.

1066
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,291
[applause]

1067
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,126
They, like, won again, right?

1068
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:56,006
But it was nice to chill out,
but as soon as the world opened up,

1069
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,216
I was back comparing myself
to other comedians,

1070
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,469
and seeing who was doing whose podcast,
and who did what venue,

1071
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,138
and how many tickets they sold.

1072
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,140
And am I too old to be on TikTok?

1073
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,894
Can a person do lip-sync videos
<i>and</i> be on cholesterol medication?

1074
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,979
[audience laughter]

1075
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,608
Yeah, like I said, comedy is so public,

1076
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:18,195
and it can be sort of...
you know, it's exposing.

1077
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,741
And, like I said, there's a lot of ways
in which I feel like I don't

1078
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,869
fit into the world,
and I'm not doing it especially good,

1079
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,205
but comedy's one of these things
where I feel like

1080
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,290
I know what I'm doing,
I'm part of something,

1081
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,626
but there's always a reminder
like, "You don't."

1082
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,670
Right before the start of COVID,
Netflix had a party.

1083
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,925
By the way, this story's so name-droppy,
I apologize in advance.

1084
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,510
This story's so name-droppy,
DiCaprio was there,

1085
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,012
I don't even mention it.

1086
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,932
[audience laughter]

1087
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,268
So, uh...

1088
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,980
Netflix has a party,
and it's at the head of Netflix's house.

1089
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,523
A guy named Ted Sarandos.

1090
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,192
A great man.

1091
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:01,112
[audience laughter]

1092
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,739
[woman cheers]

1093
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,035
A great man.

1094
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,578
[audience laughter]

1095
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:16,503
So it's at Ted Sarandos' house,
and I walk in,

1096
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,755
and it's the biggest
comedians in the world, right?

1097
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,590
I look over, it's Burr,

1098
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,802
Aziz, Mulaney, Ali Wong,

1099
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,973
Sarah Silverman, Wanda Sykes, Trevor Noah,

1100
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,057
Borat.

1101
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,185
[audience laughter]

1102
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,438
And you're like, "Pretty good.
Pretty big, Neal. All right."

1103
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,982
Dave Chappelle,

1104
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,484
Chris Rock, Kevin Hart.

1105
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,403
And then I look over here,

1106
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,321
Ellen DeGeneres, Eddie Murphy.

1107
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:48,118
I was like, "God damn. I've never seen
all these people together, ever." Right?

1108
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:51,913
And I remember thinking,
"Buddy, I don't know what you did

1109
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,833
to get invited to this party,
but it must've been pretty good,

1110
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,543
and I'm proud of you."

1111
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,963
And I'm just looking around
at all these heroes of mine, right?

1112
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,923
Uh, all icons.

1113
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:06,094
And Ted Sarandos, who is a great man...

1114
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,179
[audience laughter]

1115
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,474
...gives a toast, and he goes,

1116
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:15,103
"It's such a thrill
for me to be in the same room

1117
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,772
with all of my comedy heroes."

1118
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,816
And Chris Rock yells out,

1119
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,192
"And Neal Brennan!"

1120
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:24,487
[audience laughter]

1121
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,205
I just thought, "Man, I hope someday

1122
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,750
Chris gets humiliated
in front of all of his peers."

1123
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,086
[audience laughing and applauding]

1124
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,099
And a great joke, by the way.

1125
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,352
Like, the right joke to make.

1126
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,855
I wish I could've been somebody else
so I could have enjoyed it more.

1127
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:01,149
I was like,
"Oh fuck, I am Neal Brennan. Shit."

1128
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,068
[audience laughter]

1129
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,197
You know in a movie
when someone gets embarrassed

1130
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,074
and they cut to slo-mo shots of...

1131
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,492
"Ha, ha, ha."

1132
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,660
My slo-mo shots were Ellen going...

1133
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,871
[distorted] "Ha, ha, ha."

1134
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,290
And Borat was like, "My wife!"

1135
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,376
[audience laughter]

1136
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,466
But, yeah, it just made me, like,
second-guess myself, as usual.

1137
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,593
'Cause all these people are such naturals.

1138
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:32,222
Dave started doing comedy at 14.
He was good then.

1139
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,891
Eddie knew he was
going to be on TV when he was five.

1140
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,770
Ellen called being on <i>The Tonight Show</i>
before she did stand-up.

1141
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,606
Like, just all these stories, right?

1142
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,858
And meanwhile,
I did it completely backwards.

1143
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:47,070
I was a writer,
then I became a comedian in my thirties,

1144
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,447
and I had to... I'm not a natural.

1145
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:54,035
I had to grind and take vocal lessons
and movement classes.

1146
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,663
I listened to multiple audiobooks
about charisma.

1147
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,289
Multiple.

1148
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,375
[audience laughter]

1149
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,878
I act like this is all past tense.

1150
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,839
I'm doing it now. See this thing?

1151
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,882
"It's not a watch."
You're right. It's not.

1152
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,259
It's called a Pavlok.

1153
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,761
This thing gives me a small electric shock

1154
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,597
every three minutes on stage
to remind me to smile more.

1155
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,558
It's been happening the entire show.

1156
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,643
[audience laughter]

1157
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,482
[audience laughter]

1158
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,736
[audience applauds]

1159
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,199
Yeah, when I'm around people like that,

1160
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,077
I'm like, "Am I not
supposed to be doing this?"

1161
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,955
By the way, what even is this?

1162
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,208
Why can't I just do regular stand-up?

1163
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,376
Last time I was like,

1164
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:47,130
"I'm going to need three different
microphones set up equidistant."

1165
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,591
This one is... And this one... "Ugh..."

1166
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:53,011
- "Ha, ha, ha, ha."
- [audience laughter]

1167
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:56,931
And then this show I'm like,
"Hey, everybody, I brought blocks!"

1168
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,017
[audience laughter]

1169
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,521
I've spent the last...

1170
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:08,443
15 years of my life being a comedian.

1171
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:13,198
And every comedian I met was like,
"You seem like more of a writer."

1172
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,496
Which is comedians' way of saying,
"Give me your jokes."

1173
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,957
Before that I was a writer,
and every writer was like,

1174
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,834
"You seem like more of a comedian."

1175
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,295
Which is writers' way of saying,
"You're annoying."

1176
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,380
[audience laughter]

1177
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:33,426
If just feels like comedians over here,
writers over here.

1178
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,887
Neal, you can just stay
in this middle area,

1179
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,765
with your little stand-up traumedy shows.

1180
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,559
[audience laughter]

1181
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,356
Did I mention I paid her for this?

1182
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,694
Individually...

1183
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,949
these things are all manageable, you know?

1184
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,032
But it's...

1185
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:03,456
In totality, that's the hard part.
That's where the depression comes.

1186
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,543
And I've tried so much stuff.

1187
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,877
Like, so much.

1188
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,964
Therapy, medication.

1189
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,383
Ketamine.

1190
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,928
I tried transcranial magnetic stimulation.

1191
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,763
- [click]
- Ooh, okay...

1192
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:21,182
[loud clicking]

1193
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,476
That was good, but it kind of wore off.

1194
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,397
So then I went to China
to get a stronger version of TMS

1195
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,458
- which isn't legal in the States.
- [loud clicking]

1196
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,943
It may not even be legal in China,
for all I know.

1197
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,320
And then,

1198
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:39,409
I did 5-MeO-DMT.

1199
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,160
Like <i>Bufo alvarius.</i>

1200
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,997
It's like the nuclear bomb
of psychedelics.

1201
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,293
I think I went too far... with that one.

1202
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,502
Like, I think...

1203
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,422
I think I hurt myself a little bit.

1204
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,010
Yeah, but I guess it makes sense if you're

1205
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,470
looking for a magic bullet,

1206
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,181
occasionally you're going to get shot.

1207
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,101
But I just kept thinking,

1208
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,229
"Dude, how did you turn
self-help into self-harm?"

1209
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,650
I've been saying all night

1210
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,194
that something's wrong with me.

1211
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,075
And something is wrong with me.

1212
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,911
[gentle music playing]

1213
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,247
I won't show myself any kindness.

1214
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,044
I won't give myself any grace.

1215
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,796
Like, I just grind

1216
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:38,426
and attack myself relentlessly
like it's my job.

1217
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,387
I would love to stop.

1218
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,392
I like to believe that my ways of being,

1219
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:50,355
like my thoughts, my habits,

1220
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,441
my emotions,

1221
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,693
my beliefs...

1222
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,531
I'd like to believe
that they're not defects.

1223
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,079
I'd like to believe that
alchemy of a personality...

1224
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,666
my spirit...

1225
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,169
it's got to be enough.

1226
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:17,840
Please.

1227
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,051
Let that be enough.

1228
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:27,975
[audience applauding and cheering]

1229
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,915
[audience continues applauding]

1230
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:54,377
[closing music playing]
