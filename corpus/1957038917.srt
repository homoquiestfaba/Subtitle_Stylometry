I should be thinking.

anti social...

how many cousins I had

- German is very interesting.

they eat a lot of sauerkraut

Vietnamese.

169
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:59,433
No, that sounds too much
like Vietnamese, I mean that 
sounds

170
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,833
too much like Japanese.
It's going to sound the same.

171
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,700
Okay, what about Russian?

172
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:14,267
Oh, Russian is very good.
You drink enough vodka to make 
sure

173
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,200
that when you go to Siberia
that you don't get cold.

174
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,667
[Both laugh]

175
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,300
This is very good,
okay what about Iraq?

176
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:33,667
In Iraq, it is.

177
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,100
I don't think I've ever heard
an Iraqi person say anything.

178
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,500
I don't know if I can do that.

179
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,333
[Rising music]

180
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,300
[Moaning]

181
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,367
[Heavy breathing]

182
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:08,033
[Shower water]

183
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,267
[Key in lock]
[Door opening]

184
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:58,667
[Door shutting]

185
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,933
[Laughs]

186
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:36,100
[Cameraman] So,
twenty-five points?

187
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:37,200
Yeah.

188
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:39,933
Sounds, like you've really
got out of your slump.

189
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:44,367
- That's exciting.
- Triple double. 25, 10 and 10.

190
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:46,100
What you get,
ten rebounds and ten steals.

191
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:48,667
- First time in two years.
- Ten reebs?

192
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,767
Yeah, ten boards.
Thirteen assists. Twenty five 
points.

193
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:59,167
And I was hitting from all over.
Three point land. Fifteen 
footers.

194
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:05,033
- Drive, dunks, reverse lay-ups.
Hooks.
- You can't dunk, can you?

195
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,967
I can dunk. Sure boy, you 
kidding me.

196
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:15,300
Try that again with...
what accent is that?

197
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,700
What's up? What accent is that?
I don't know, just a general.

198
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:24,100
I don't know trying to do kind 
of
a Larry Bird kind of thing.

199
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:28,967
Let me hear your stats. Just you
know,
straight forward how you would 
say them.

200
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:33,133
You have some enthusiasm but let
me
just hear your...

201
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,600
- Just my stats.
- It's exciting you got out of 
your slump.

202
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,267
- I didn't sound excited.
- You sounded a little goofy.

203
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,200
Sounded like what?
You sounded a little playful and
goofy.

204
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:50,100
- This is dead serious.
- This is dead serious.

205
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,633
- Alright.
- Just play it...

206
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:58,300
You know, a quiet composure
you have about you.

207
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:03,000
Like I'm a warrior.
Like I'm that kind of player.

208
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:05,933
You broke out of you slump, but 
geez,
you know, like what do you 
expect.

209
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,367
- I'm going to break out of my 
slump.
- So, I'm a little pissed at the
question.

210
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:35,300
[Violin music]

211
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,867
[Kissing]

212
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,667
[Man] Alright, that's it. That's
the end
of the cut as it stands right 
now.

213
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:16,500
[Laughing]

214
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,633
What was that sigh?

215
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,033
[Blinds going up]

216
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:24,833
I'm nervous to give my notes.
Cause, I'm in my head about it.

217
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,033
That's all.

218
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,933
Do you want notes?

219
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,433
I don't know. I have my own 
notes.
My own thoughts.

220
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,700
I think that...
I really like it actually.

221
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:40,267
I think it's good. I think it's 
good
that he's mysterious.

222
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:42,800
Maybe we could know a little 
more
of whom he is.

223
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,033
I think that the sex passages
are unbalanced.

224
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,333
And,

225
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,600
this is why I'm nervous about 
saying it.

226
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,467
I don't want to sound
like a selfish actor

227
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,033
who wants more screen time.

228
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,033
I also don't want to seem like

229
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,700
like a dude who wants to have
a sex scene with Kentucker

230
00:30:57,867 --> 00:31:00,533
who clearly doesn't enjoy them
with me at least.

231
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,533
- Or me, but with Kate.
- Or with me. No don't worry.

232
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,533
I think that they are 
unbalanced.
Like Kate's in really long and 
great.

233
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:13,433
Sophia's is really great too
and slightly shorter than 
Kate's.

234
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,767
- And mine is really brief.
- Yeah.

235
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:20,100
You might be running the risk
of showing your into girls.

236
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,867
So, obviously you're more erotic
with that.

237
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:27,800
- And then like...
- What are we trying to say?

238
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:31,467
I may just be a selfish person
that may just want more screen 
time.

239
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:33,633
I think that's totally valid
cause what are we trying to say

240
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,133
when we have two invisible guys
basically. It's almost like

241
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,033
we're scared to have them
touch each other.

242
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:43,033
I'm not dying to do
more sex scenes with him

243
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,333
but and it's probably too late 
anyway.

244
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:48,667
It's too late in some sense.

245
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,333
The only devise we have left is
the iPhone.

246
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:55,267
[Joe Swanberg] So, I'm
just going to use my voice

247
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:57,600
and we'll just replace it
with Kentucker's.

248
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,100
Wait, why does it go negative?

249
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,800
Ok, I think we're good now.p

250
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,533
So, I'm going to prompt you
and whatever things I say

251
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,967
we can just replace it
with Kentucker's voice, okay?

252
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:17,433
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah, if it can be anybody, 
why, why?

253
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:21,167
Wouldn't make more sense to be 
my fiancé

254
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,333
than you who probably
don't want to see this?

255
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:28,500
- I don't know, maybe you do.
- Oh right, I didn't think about
that.

256
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,767
- I would just feel more.
- Hey Sophia, come here !

257
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:36,300
- What do you want me to do?
- Touch your balls.

258
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:39,367
Touch my balls?
Just like that.

259
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:40,767
Yeah, cup them.

260
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:43,533
I don't know
it doesn't make your cock big.

261
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,500
You have to think about what 
Kentucker.

262
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,833
You have to think director wise
what Kentucker would have done.

263
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:48,967
Do you know what I mean?

264
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,367
Yeah, he would have
been like [mumbles]

265
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,833
I definitely know
what he would do visually.

266
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:59,867
Yeah, also you can't talk
more than he would talk.

267
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:03,867
I'm going to go, I'll be back 
guys.

268
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,300
- You want to wait until he's 
out.
- Yeah.

269
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:18,167
[Door closes]

270
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,633
[Door locks]

271
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,667
- So go. [Whispers]

272
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:36,467
- Much better with you in here.
- Than with Joe?

273
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,167
[Whispers] I don't
know what to do.

274
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:45,167
What would you like to see,
I forget the note.

275
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:50,433
I am saying like for for the sex
scenes,
he doesn't really talk.

276
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,200
- You're getting hard.
- Yeah.

277
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,633
That's cool.

278
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,133
- I mean if we're [mumbles]

279
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,200
Stop, do what I say, just wait.

280
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:14,367
He can come in at any time.
Yes, spread your legs out.

281
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't know.

282
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,467
And now I guess.

283
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
I like it when you...

284
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:26,100
sometimes
when you do not a long stroke.

285
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,833
Not slower... just less...

286
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:32,967
[Laughs]

287
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,500
Forget that it's a movie.
What would you want to see?

288
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:41,967
Ok. [Laughs]

289
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,500
You know, who knows what
Kentucker was thinking.

290
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,967
Alright, so.

291
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,100
Should I move over here?
More room.

292
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:01,300
Look at me, look at the camera,
and stroke your cock.

293
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:09,100
What are you thinking about
when you do it?

294
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:10,667
I'm looking at you.

295
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:20,533
This stupid movie has been going
on.
We haven't had time to have sex.

296
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,633
Do you think he would ask you
turn around and like show your 
ass.

297
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,867
If he was gay probably.
Would you like to see that?

298
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,200
- Yeah I'd like to see it.
- Like this?

299
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,000
I don't know.

300
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,300
Yeah.

301
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:47,133
Want to see it from the side?

302
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:50,533
Yeah, I can see how big your 
penis is.

303
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:58,333
[Cameraman] Okay, will you clap
for me in front of your face.

304
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,133
[Coughs]

305
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,633
All right.

306
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:09,867
There's this sort of...

307
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:14,267
It's just like it was
a little bit stupid.

308
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:18,333
The shot of you and Kentucker 
laughing,
it was a bad idea I had.

309
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:25,533
So I just want to cut into this
and this will cut into the 
iPhone stuff.

310
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,867
So, just stare right into the 
camera.

311
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
- And then what?
[Laughs]

312
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,967
Wait. Wait. Make a serious face.

313
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,933
Sorry, how serious?
Angry serious?

314
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:02,533
Be a little afraid of him.

315
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,500
- If he were the camera.
- Okay.

316
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,933
Let me see a little more smile
in your eyes.

317
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,267
Afraid but excited a bit.

318
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,800
This is hard.

319
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,933
Laugh.

320
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,467
[Laughs]

321
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,700
Now be serious.

322
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,467
Be suspicious.

323
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,600
I think it looks great.

324
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:28,600
- We're going to have a 
threesome.
[Woman] Are we still doing that?

325
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,200
I don't even know if we're doing
that.

326
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:31,967
I have no idea if we're doing 
that
or not.

327
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,633
- My mom had a dream that...
- Your going to kiss my lips.

328
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,000
we were going to have a 
threesome.

329
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:37,500
- Remember that Sophia?
- That was a while ago yeah.

330
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,033
[Laughs]

331
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:43,000
- Do you remember that?
- That's practice.

332
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,600
Remember that dream.
My mom had a dream.

333
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,667
She's like don't have a 
threesome,
it was going to ruin your 
relationship.

334
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,267
I had a dream that you were 
going
to have a threesome

335
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,800
and it was going ruin
your relationship.

336
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:51,267
- And your mom's psychic.
- For a movie.

337
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:53,633
- And my mom's psychic.
- It was for a movie in the 
dream right?

338
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,833
- I don't remember. Was it for a
movie?
- I don't remember.

339
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
- It was the three of us wasn't 
it?
- It was, yeah, the three of us.

340
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,033
- Oh, that's so weird.
[Woman] Your mom's been psychic 
before.

341
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:04,967
She's been psychic before.
She's had episodes.

342
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:06,633
What was she psychic about 
before?

343
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,167
She came home one day from work
and was really really really 
tired

344
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:12,600
and the cleaning lady was there.

345
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,700
So, my mom came home from work,
really really tired, fell asleep

346
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:19,633
and had a dream that a car came 
driving
through our front yard,

347
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,933
and went into our back yard
which was a jungle.

348
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,167
Then hit a tree in the jungle.

349
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:28,533
And then a grownup
fell out of the front seat of 
the car,

350
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,833
then four children came
running out of the back seat.

351
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,133
The first one got eaten by a 
lion.
The next one got eaten by a 
snake.

352
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,167
And the next one got eaten by 
whatever,
some other jungle animal

353
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:42,767
and the forth one ran up a tree
and survived by eating bananas

354
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,700
in the tree and while
all the animals tried to get...

355
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:49,000
and then it turned out
while my mom was asleep,

356
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,667
that the cleaning lady had 
gotten
a phone call that her child

357
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:58,300
- was lost in the jungle,
- Whoa.

358
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,667
on a field trip and then...

359
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:03,267
[Woman] People had died.
- They didn't know.

360
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:04,967
They didn't know where anyone 
was.

361
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:06,667
Well my mom said,
that I just had a dream

362
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,867
and if that's the case
then your son is alive

363
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:12,267
and about a week later she found
out
that indeed he was alive and he 
survived

364
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:14,467
by climbing up a tree
and eating bananas.

365
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:16,433
- Seriously?
- Isn't that crazy?

366
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,200
That's the most insane thing
I've ever heard.

367
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:20,367
It almost makes me
not want to have a threesome.

368
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:23,767
Yeah, it does make me... I'm 
serious,
I don't want to do it anymore.

369
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,633
[Knock at the door]

370
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,167
Come in.

371
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:20,300
[Laughs]

372
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:22,500
[Swanberg] What are
you laughing at?

373
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:26,433
Sorry.
[Laughs]

374
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:29,933
That was Kate, and I was like
they are going to blame me.

375
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,767
[Swanberg] What was Kate?
- That was not my stomach.

376
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:32,967
That was my stomach.

377
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:34,200
Someone else's stomach growled
and I was like

378
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,800
they are going to blame me.

379
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,767
[Swanberg] Alright, I got enough
of it,
it's fine. We'll move on to the 
next thing.

380
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:39,267
We'll kill the audio.

381
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:18,800
[Laughs]

382
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,433
You guys can kiss if you want.

383
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:25,867
You guys can kiss too, even 
though
I like all of the attention.

384
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,167
[Laughing]

385
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,200
Alright.

386
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:31,200
I thought it said something
in the script

387
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:33,100
about who's supposed to kiss 
who.

388
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:35,800
- Yeah, but...
- I start kissing you first too.

389
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:37,167
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

390
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,633
- In the outline.
- Okay.

391
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,033
[Swanberg] You guys want
to keep going or stop?

392
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,633
No, I want to keep going.

393
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,367
- I thought that worked really 
well.
- Don't worry about... scrap the
outline.

394
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:48,100
- Just make out.
- When if feels right, yeah.

395
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:49,533
Then I'll cut it.

396
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,533
Okay.

397
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,200
Starting from where?

398
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:57,833
- From the top.
- It's unclear when what feels 
right?

399
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:01,367
[Swanberg] For you
and Kate to engage.

400
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:05,333
Oh, man. I think maybe
it's best if you just...

401
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,133
[Swanberg] Prompt you from 
behind?
I'm totally happy to do that 
Larry.

402
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:13,300
Alright.

403
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,667
Do what ever you want.

404
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:19,600
[Swanberg] You guys want to 
stop.
- No.

405
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,000
I just feel that if you gave
somebody the agency to do it

406
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:30,700
then it would take a lot
of pressure off us.

407
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:32,867
You know what I mean?

408
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,767
Like if I decide to kiss Kate
that's going to effect Sophia...

409
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:37,467
[Swanberg] Kate you kiss Larry.
- ...in real life.

410
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,433
- Kate's going to kiss you, all 
right?
- Thank you.

411
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,533
The camera can't see
your pretty face.

412
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:48,033
[Swanberg] I'm still rolling.

413
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,333
You want me to roll back over
or is this position okay?

414
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,267
That was good
when you were up on your 
shoulder.

415
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:53,967
So start down and get up.

416
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,433
Go head guys.

417
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:35,167
[Laughs]

418
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,833
No camera, no more cameras.

419
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
[Woman] Oh no, I just want to 
have this
to remember as a memento.

420
00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:46,633
We've been shooting all day.

421
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,333
I feel like enough with the 
cameras
already, you know?

422
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,000
Is anything sacred, can anything
exist
that is not on screen?

423
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:01,833
No, okay apparently not.

424
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,433
Did you like watching me kiss 
Kate?

425
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:09,667
Did it really turn you on?

426
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,867
[Laughs]

427
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,500
Okay, okay. Interview over.
Dude, I'm tired.

428
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:23,700
I know but I just really want to
know
if all of your fantasies were 
fulfilled.

429
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:24,667
[Laughs]

430
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:25,767
No.

431
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,633
When I was in the same bed
with you and a woman.

432
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,500
No that wasn't my fantasy
and it wasn't fulfilled.

433
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:32,200
- None of my fantasies were 
fulfilled.
- And our tongues were touching.

434
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,200
- I didn't like it.
- You didn't like it?

435
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:36,133
No, I didn't find
particularly interesting.

436
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,333
Did you not even get a boner?

437
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,200
At what point?
Which point are you talking 
about?

438
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:44,467
At the point where Kate and I 
were
making out with each other and 
not you.

439
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,500
But I was in the room?

440
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,200
You were just a
bystander watching us.

441
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,000
- A voyeur.
- I was in this position.

442
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,600
Like I'm in right now looking at
you
like that.

443
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,833
At that point, did I have a 
boner?

444
00:45:55,967 --> 00:46:00,100
Did you enjoy watching it?
In a sexual way?

445
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:07,167
I couldn't really see it.
I couldn't.

446
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:09,600
I had a boner.

447
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,467
Yeah?

448
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,167
[Laughs]

449
00:46:13,267 --> 00:46:14,700
Such a dumb word.

450
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:19,700
Yeah, I had one. You know that.
Don't you remember?

451
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,667
- Was it from watching me and 
Kate?
- It was from the whole 
zeitgeist.

452
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:29,000
Do you think it's from watching 
me
kiss Kate and Kate kiss me?

453
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,367
[Laughs]

454
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:32,767
I don't know.

455
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,700
I feel like...
I'm being snared gently into 
a...

456
00:46:38,367 --> 00:46:40,333
- Trap?
- Right.

457
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:42,433
They feel really nice.

458
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,100
They're soft and they taste 
really sweet

459
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:51,033
and you keep kissing them.

460
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,200
She's petting your head.
She's holding your hair.

461
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,700
You start to unbutton her pants
but you don't but you just

462
00:46:57,767 --> 00:46:59,467
leave her pants unbuttoned.

463
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,000
Then I walk in and you're really
scared
and you try to act

464
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:06,500
like nothing is happened.

465
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,433
She's sitting with her shirt 
off.
You don't know how I'm going to 
react.

466
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:13,467
But I sort of stand up for a 
second
and you are really nervous.

467
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,133
And then I walk over to Kate
and I start to kiss her

468
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:21,667
and since her pants
are already unbuttoned,

469
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:26,100
I stick my hand down her pants,
I can feel how wet her pussy 
already is.

470
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:32,300
I start to finger her while you 
watch
and you start to take my shirt 
off

471
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,700
and you start to my pants off.

472
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:42,333
You start kissing my back and my
ass
and you start to finger my pussy

473
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:44,767
while stroking your own cock.

474
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:51,767
Kate's sitting there playing
with her tits. Kate and I are 
kissing.

475
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:58,867
I'm kissing. You start to come
and you start to...

476
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:02,533
I move my fingers away
from Kate's vagina and you start

477
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,433
to lick her pussy.

478
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,133
It tastes really sweet,
tastes like a ball of sugar

479
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:13,700
and Kate and I are kissing
while your licking her pussy...

480
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:16,767
she's like groaning
and moaning with pleasure.

481
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:25,267
And then, you and I start to 
kiss
while Kate starts to suck your 
cock.

482
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:30,500
She's sucking your cock
and taking it deep into her 
throat,

483
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,867
really really deep,
just like you like it.

484
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:39,467
[Laughter on laptop]

485
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:42,767
Shit, come on man.

486
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:45,133
[Laughter]

487
00:48:45,267 --> 00:48:47,867
[On laptop] Come on, pull it
together, it's still rolling.

488
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,500
[On laptop] Kate are you
trying not to kiss him?

489
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,500
[Laughing]

490
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,300
[On laptop] Do you not want to?

491
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,700
- Do you want a break.
- No.

492
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,100
Let's do that.

493
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:22,367
I thought I was supposed to kiss
her eyelids,

494
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:24,000
then she was supposed to kiss me
on the mouth.

495
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:25,167
Yeah, I'm sorry.

496
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:27,500
That's totally supposed to 
happen,
you said that.

497
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,667
- Okay.
- I'm being a moron.

498
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,333
Your doing all the work.

499
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:32,333
[Laughter]

500
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,867
No, I've...

501
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:41,133
I was ignoring the outline.
I didn't want to push. I mean, 
sorry.

502
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:44,800
[Swanberg sighs, coughs]

503
00:50:09,367 --> 00:50:12,033
[Woman] Just force us to have 
fun,
and then we will have fun

504
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,500
and then it will be safe
that we had fun. Does that make 
sense?

505
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:18,467
I fell as as long as your there

506
00:50:18,633 --> 00:50:21,533
guiding it and guiding the...
not like the way Larry was...

507
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,600
I can't make you have fun.
I can't make you have fun 
though.

508
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:26,767
I don't thing that's something
I can force you to do.

509
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:28,300
I think you can. Like...

510
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:31,000
What Larry was asking for last 
time,
just like tell us when to kiss 
when,

511
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:33,000
like that's what made it stick.

512
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,933
But if...

513
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,500
Right, that's what made Larry 
feel safe.

514
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:40,367
But that's because he's
scared of me, not because...

515
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:44,600
I know but by making this movie,

516
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:49,000
I've put the two of you's 
relationship
into any sort of jeopardy.

517
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:51,500
It's awful, I don't want to do 
it.

518
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,833
But why do you think you have
that much power over us?

519
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,267
I don't. I don't because
in the past people have 
expressed...

520
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:02,633
This is the future. This is the 
present.

521
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:06,267
I know... I never thought I had
that much power until people...

522
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:08,633
got hurt and blamed me.

523
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,267
- You know.
- Right.

524
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,267
People did things...

525
00:51:15,633 --> 00:51:18,967
and then felt hurt
or taken advantage of by me.

526
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:21,033
You know.

527
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:23,800
I mean, I improvise.

528
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:26,867
It's not like I've ever made 
anyone
do anything or say anything

529
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:29,200
but that doesn't change
the fact that they got hurt.

530
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:31,467
Doesn't that make them just like
babies?

531
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,100
No, it doesn't make them babies,

532
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:36,533
it just makes me understand
how loaded and complex the 
situation is.

533
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:38,300
- You know?
- Right.

534
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:42,333
By creating the movie
and creating the situation,

535
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:47,333
I need to consider how much
power I do or do not have.

536
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,333
I'm not trying to make it seem
like I have a bunch of power 
over you.

537
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:53,433
Right.

538
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,700
Or that I have the ability
to ruin your lives by making a 
movie

539
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,700
but if by making a movie
your lives get ruined

540
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:04,333
I'm certainly implicated in 
that,
you know.

541
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:05,300
Yeah.

542
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:09,200
And also, weather you blame me
afterwards or not,

543
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:11,333
I still feel shitty about it.

544
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:15,433
I want the work that I make

545
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,533
to be helpful to people
and useful to people.

546
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:22,033
I don't want it to be hurtful.
I don't want the movies

547
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,133
to make the world a worse place.

548
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,533
I want the movies to make people

549
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,333
feel less alone and like they 
live
in a better place

550
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,167
with other like minded people.

551
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:37,200
- Right.
- You know...

552
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,433
Yeah.

553
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,600
But I also think that

554
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:52,767
the stuff that we shot doesn't 
work
and it is because it's too 
controlled.

555
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:56,033
- It's too safe.
- Right.

556
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:59,967
I don't know how to make
the threesome...

557
00:53:00,633 --> 00:53:07,800
It's not up to you.
It can be fun and safe, if 
afterwards...

558
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,967
If the three of you
agree for it to be...

559
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:11,633
Fun and safe.

560
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,600
And then if afterwards Larry
makes a real concerted effort

561
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:16,933
to be really nice to me
and not pay attention to Kate

562
00:53:16,967 --> 00:53:19,033
then it will be fine.
[Both laugh]

563
00:53:19,367 --> 00:53:24,333
It can exist in the moment and 
that's it
as long as afterwards people...

564
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:29,500
And like I think it's totally 
okay
to ask for that. You know what I
mean?

565
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,767
Like if I ask Larry after we do 
this,

566
00:53:33,867 --> 00:53:35,600
you can do whatever you want to 
Kate
but afterwards

567
00:53:35,633 --> 00:53:37,800
I need you to pay only attention
to me.

568
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,433
Like just to negotiate it
and establish different kinds 
of...

569
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,700
Do you want to do that?

570
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:53,000
Or would you rather we just
not delve into that territory?

571
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:56,000
I'd rather make a good movie.

572
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:02,867
But I don't know that this
will make it a good movie.

573
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,533
That's subjective.

574
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,500
But you know that it will make 
it better

575
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:08,267
than if the threesome that's in 
there
now is in it.

576
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:10,200
Then that's what I want to do.

577
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:21,367
God dammit.

578
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:43,267
It's just, do you want us
to end feeling empty

579
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:48,033
or do you want us to find a 
solution?
I guess is my question.

580
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,967
Do you want us
to find something in each other

581
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:56,300
and ourselves that makes us move
beyond his absence

582
00:54:56,367 --> 00:55:04,100
and his having left or do you 
want us
to end in confusion and..

583
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:06,133
longing?

584
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:10,800
What are you more interested in?

585
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:11,933
[Sighs]

586
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,267
Um...

587
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,367
I'm sorry, what were the 
options?
Confusion and longing what?

588
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:24,467
Confusion and longing versus
self realization

589
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:32,667
or fulfillment without him.

590
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:45,000
I think, well how do
you feel about God?

591
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:49,933
Confusion and longing
or fulfillment without him?

592
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:51,033
[Laugh]

593
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:56,200
A little bit of both.
That's the trouble.

594
00:55:58,033 --> 00:56:01,333
I want the scene to be at the 
beginning
of the movie and I want to re 
shoot it.

595
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,033
But I want you guys to think

596
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,800
about what you sincerely want
to pray for,

597
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:08,033
that's bigger than yourselves.

598
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,767
[Woman] I already know what
I'm going to pray for.

599
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:12,367
Not things that.
You know what I mean.

600
00:56:12,533 --> 00:56:18,633
Like you all three of you prayed
for personal things and stuff 
like that.

601
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:21,933
I have a really good idea.

602
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,500
Okay good and we'll do it
without any irony.

603
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:29,000
It's important to me
that it's in the film without 
irony.

604
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:30,433
Okay.

605
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:33,167
Alright.

606
00:56:33,467 --> 00:56:35,533
- Are you guys ready to do it 
now?
- Yeah.

607
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,367
Just give me the camera
and stay where you are.

608
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,367
Who would go first?

609
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,933
I have something to pray for.
Can I go first guys?

610
00:56:49,533 --> 00:56:50,700
Uh huh.

611
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:55,033
- And you guys remember 
afterwards.
- We pray to the Lord.

612
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,267
We pray to the Lord.
As a group we say that.

613
00:56:57,433 --> 00:56:58,867
- That's it.
- Yeah.

614
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,200
I'd like to pray for all the 
people

615
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:06,667
in all these countries
that are fighting hard to...

616
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,033
I don't want to say be free

617
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,033
but that's the only thing
I can think of.

618
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,867
To change the situation
of where they are.

619
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:19,167
- I want you to think about it 
first.
- But I did think about it.

620
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:21,433
No I know, that's a great thing
to pray for

621
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,933
but think about how you want
to phrase it.

622
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,667
What are they doing?

623
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:36,300
They are fighting oppression,
political oppression, tyranny.

624
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,033
So, I would like to pray
for all the people around the 
world

625
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,500
who are fighting against
political oppression.

626
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,967
[In unison] We pray to the Lord.
- Lord hear our prayer, right.

627
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,100
You say, we pray to the Lord

628
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:54,533
than as a group we say
Lord hear our prayer.

629
00:57:58,133 --> 00:58:00,633
Yeah, but don't make jokes.

630
00:58:01,967 --> 00:58:03,700
I can't make jokes
in-between the prayers?

631
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:06,833
I don't... this is what I'm 
saying.
I want the tone of the 
prayers...

632
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:11,267
I don't want it to be for the 
movie.
Does it make sense?

633
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,633
- Yes.
- I want the four of us to do 
this.

634
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,200
- Together.
- A sincere prayer.

635
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,933
- Yeah.
- But it is a sincere prayer.

636
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,267
- I know.
- I know, I believe you too.

637
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,133
You can actually let God fall 
off.

638
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:26,600
[Whispers]

639
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,367
[Laughs]

640
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,300
Sorry.

641
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:31,633
[Sighs]

642
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:36,867
I'd like to pray for all the 
people

643
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:40,867
who are fighting against
political oppression around the 
world.

644
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,100
- I pray to the Lord.
[In unison] Lord hear our 
prayer.

645
00:58:48,867 --> 00:58:53,033
I'd like to pray for people
who don't have anyone

646
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,200
or know that they have people
in their lives who care about 
them.

647
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:01,200
So I'd like to pray for the 
people
who feel alone

648
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:05,000
in particularly people
that are homeless.

649
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,167
- I pray to the Lord.
[In unison] Lord hear our 
prayer.

650
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:22,500
I'd like to pray for all
of the women in the world

651
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:28,367
who are in abusive relationships
and being physically abused

652
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:31,300
by the men in their lives.

653
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:36,133
I'd like to pray to the Lord
that he gives them strength

654
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:41,867
to help them find a way
out of the situation and get 
help.

655
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:47,433
- We pray to the Lord.
[In unison] Lord hear our 
prayer.

656
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,833
[Knock at the door]

657
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:54,300
Come in.

658
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:02,700
[Slapping]

659
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:04,133
What the fuck!
Jesus Christ.

660
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,100
[Swanber] Hold up,
whoa, whoa!

661
01:02:05,633 --> 01:02:07,633
Sophia!
Stop it!

662
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,800
[Shouting] Hey, cut it out.

663
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,600
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you fucking crazy?

664
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:17,633
No, just excuse me.

665
01:02:20,367 --> 01:02:21,467
[Sophia sighs]

666
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:22,767
You okay?

667
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,500
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.

668
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,767
[Laughs]

669
01:02:27,033 --> 01:02:31,767
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

670
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,967
[Shouts] Sophia.

671
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,000
What the fuck?

672
01:02:40,933 --> 01:02:43,667
- Do you want me to go talk with
her?
- I guess I should do it.

673
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:46,867
[Coughs]

674
01:02:57,833 --> 01:02:59,267
[Door shuts]

675
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:01,167
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

676
01:03:02,767 --> 01:03:04,800
I guess we're not doing the 
threesome.

677
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,433
[Laughs]

678
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,200
[Swanberg sighs]

679
01:03:15,267 --> 01:03:16,367
Fuck.

680
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,800
I just don't want to be in the 
middle
of this bullshit.

681
01:03:21,933 --> 01:03:23,367
[Door opens]

682
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,667
[Sophia sighs]

683
01:03:29,933 --> 01:03:31,100
[Door closes]

684
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:36,533
- You okay?
- I'm really sorry.

685
01:03:39,467 --> 01:03:43,033
- You're sorry to her.
- Technically.

686
01:03:45,433 --> 01:03:47,800
- Are you okay though?
- I'm ready to do it again.

687
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,433
[Swanberg] What?

688
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,333
- That's not happening.
- No, I don't want to do it 
again.

689
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:57,933
[Swanberg] Don't be ridiculous.
Where are you coming from with 
that?

690
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,267
We're not going to do it again.

691
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,200
I just wasn't prepared and now I
am.

692
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:05,867
[Laughter]

693
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:09,700
[Larry] You just fucking 
attacked me.
[Swanberg] I'm sorry I don't 
mean to laugh.

694
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:13,700
[Swanberg] I don't want to shoot
it again.
[Larry] Yeah, we're not shooting
it again.

695
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:15,000
I'm not doing it again.

696
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,200
[Larry] I mean no, we're not
doing it again. That's it.

697
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,333
Alright?

698
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:36,867
- What?
[Sophia] I just feel like...

699
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:39,700
I put in all this time
and now your like tired

700
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:41,800
so you don't want to finish the 
movie.

701
01:04:41,967 --> 01:04:46,800
It's more... I'm physically 
tired
and I'm also emotionally 
exhausted

702
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,767
with dealing with these kinds of
issues.

703
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:53,000
- Well you created them.
- I know, that's what I feel 
shitty about.

704
01:04:53,267 --> 01:04:57,133
Don't feel shitty. Just be like 
I did it
and I don't want to do it any 
more.

705
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,033
No, I can't be in the middle
of this shit any more.

706
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,467
I don't why I create it.

707
01:05:01,633 --> 01:05:03,467
You can't decide it
when there is just one scene 
left.

708
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,800
I don't even want to finish this
movie,
I want to fucking walk away from
it

709
01:05:05,967 --> 01:05:08,367
and never again
put myself in the position.

710
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:10,800
Fine walk away from it
by not making any more movies.

711
01:05:10,967 --> 01:05:12,667
I know. That's what I'm talking 
about.

712
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:17,100
I already put in a lot of time,
like I want to finish the movie.

713
01:05:17,267 --> 01:05:18,933
So, what? It's worth it to you 
to risk

714
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,600
your relationship to fucking 
finish
this movie?

715
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,367
I'm positive it's not going to 
affect
my relationship.

716
01:05:24,533 --> 01:05:26,267
- Yes, it is worth it to her.
[Larry] It is worth it to her.

717
01:05:26,433 --> 01:05:27,967
Apparently to her.

718
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,933
No, I just don't think it will 
affect
my relationship.

719
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,500
It is affecting your 
relationship.

720
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:33,100
I just watched it
affect your relationship.

721
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,967
It affected my relationship with
you.
It was just a momentary thing.

722
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,367
No, I'm not going to...
I don't believe you.

723
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:48,033
I can't do in anymore.

724
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:54,867
I can't feel responsible
for this stuff and I do.

725
01:06:09,867 --> 01:06:11,700
I'm going to walk you out.

726
01:06:23,133 --> 01:06:24,333
[Cameraman laughs]

727
01:06:32,433 --> 01:06:35,333
[Mumbling]

728
01:06:47,267 --> 01:06:49,300
[Whispering] Do you want
to go to sleep? [Laughs]

729
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,700
[Swanberg] It's just that thing.

730
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:54,033
[Video stopping]

731
01:06:54,433 --> 01:06:55,800
It just becomes about you.

732
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:57,100
[Baby gurgles]

733
01:06:58,133 --> 01:06:59,767
It just becomes another movie

734
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,100
about you complaining
about making movies.

735
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:05,133
Where as in like the beginning
it's exciting, your doing 
something new.

736
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:07,867
Even when you pull out
and it's a movie within a movie.

737
01:07:08,033 --> 01:07:10,333
It's still something
you haven't done before but then
it,

738
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:12,933
you know, by the end
it's just another movie

739
01:07:12,967 --> 01:07:16,967
where your complaining
about directing movies.

740
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,300
Right.

741
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,133
[Baby whines and gurgles]

742
01:07:23,367 --> 01:07:25,867
So, I guess that's my
main problem with it.

743
01:07:31,867 --> 01:07:33,833
It also seems a little thrown 
together,

744
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:39,967
I'm not sure, I'm not sure I 
believe it
when Sophia hits him.

745
01:07:40,033 --> 01:07:41,600
- Right.
- During the threesome.

746
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:43,500
- Right.
- It also makes,

747
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:48,633
it seems just like the same 
thing
you did in Art History.

748
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Uh huh.

749
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,167
[Laughs]

750
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,133
I don't disagree with you... I 
know.

751
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:07,933
And because your past few movies
have just been about

752
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,533
basically about you complaining
about you making movies.

753
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:16,700
It's sort of like another one is
just
you complaining about making 
movies

754
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,867
about complaining
about making movies...

755
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:21,033
it's a little bit too much.

756
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,267
Right.

757
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:32,300
Do you? Do you feel like it's 
good?

758
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,167
The second half?

759
01:08:34,867 --> 01:08:36,033
Uh, well...

760
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,300
I definitely feel that
it runs out of steam

761
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:43,767
but I almost kind of felt like 
that
or that became the point.

762
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:51,300
It's like I just didn't have
the energy or enthusiasm

763
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:54,633
to finish the movie.
So it just doesn't get finished.

764
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,500
You know what I mean? It just 
kind of...

765
01:08:59,867 --> 01:09:02,633
Is that the point
or is that just what happened?

766
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:03,867
[Laughs]

767
01:09:07,467 --> 01:09:09,533
I don't think anyone will watch 
that
and come away with

768
01:09:09,633 --> 01:09:12,767
"Oh, I get it, he ran out of 
steam
and that's why

769
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,167
the movie isn't you know..."

770
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,333
Right.

771
01:09:16,633 --> 01:09:19,433
I think people will watch that 
movie and say "Aw man,

772
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,967
"that the beginning was really 
awesome but then the second half

773
01:09:22,133 --> 01:09:23,833
"just seemed like he didn't 
know what he was doing

774
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:25,600
"and he threw it together."

775
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:28,000
What your saying is
that is what happened.

776
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:33,000
But that doesn't mean, I don't 
know...

777
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:34,300
Right...

778
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:36,433
Hold on.

779
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,000
Alright, we have to put him to 
bed. Soon.

780
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:47,467
[Singing] Oh, my sweet boy.
Oh, my big boy.

781
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,200
Oh, my humcle bunkle boy.

782
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:58,667
Oh my sweetie, little cutie,
oh my sweetie baby boy.

783
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:01,967
[Shushes]

784
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,700
[Baby cries]

785
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:37,033
[Recording of a heartbeat]

786
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:38,700
[Shushes]
