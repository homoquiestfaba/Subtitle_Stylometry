1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:15,988
At the height of it's glory, the French Foreign Legion
consisted of men considered, common ... the dregs of society.
--    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --
It was an army of mercenaries in the northern colonies
of Africa and Southeast Asia.

6
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:48,074
However, it's soldiers did not swear allegiance to France, 
but only to the Legion and their peers.
--    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --
The Legion was not interested in the past of it's men.
Neither did it offer many hopes for the future.
--    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --
The legionnaires fought to the last man standing.
Whatever the conflict. Whatever the cause.
--    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --    --
It was a hard way of getting a second chance in life.

16
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:18,005
MARSEILLE 1925

17
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:08,592
- Maxim?
-Rene, oh would you like a drink?

18
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,968
No, no, no let's have a talk. Heh?

19
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:16,635
You said midnight.
Not to worry, he'll be here.

20
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,926
My brother does not like
to be kept waiting.

21
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,301
It's disrespectful!

22
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,052
I promise you! Ten minutes.

23
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:29,469
That's all you get, huh?

24
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,678
Ladies.

25
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:44,011
Alan, what the hell do you think
you're doing?

26
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,220
-Meeting you.
-Aren't you supposed to be an hour ago.

27
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:49,847
Jeez, Alan, can't you just for once
help me out?

28
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:52,971
- Why do you have to make everything so difficult?
- Oh, Maxim you love it.

29
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,846
You don't get off the hook that easy.

30
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,972
Especially after what I've been
thru setting this up.

31
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,638
Galgani has sunk a lot of cash
into this deal.

32
00:04:59,804 --> 00:05:01,680
We have an opportunity to make
some real money ...

33
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,556
... and maybe even hold onto it
for a change.

34
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,432
Hey Julot, how's the glass jaw?

35
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:17,932
Monsieur Galgani, this is
Alan Lefevre.

36
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:21,307
- You are late.
- Better late than never.

37
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:24,891
Who's this comedian? I thought
you managed a fighter.

38
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,891
Excuse me, Mr. Lefevre, ...

39
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:29,225
I never do business ...
in the presence of ...

40
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:32,516
... the female gender.

41
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:36,934
Ladies.

42
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:39,683
Let's go to the bar.

43
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:47,101
Julot tells me you are someone
that can be trusted.

44
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:50,767
Please bear with my bluntness
if I get straight to the point.

45
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,560
It's ok by me.

46
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,060
The gates have been good.
You are a big draw.

47
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:57,852
I'll give you a shot at Julot for ...

48
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:00,310
twice ... your normal purse.

49
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:03,144
Not bad!

50
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,810
There is just one minor stipulation.

51
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:09,061
Which is?

52
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:12,895
You take a dive in the second round.

53
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,688
I don't crash the canvas for anyone.

54
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:24,312
You're over your head.
Don't push your luck.

55
00:06:25,438 --> 00:06:28,605
My brother, I love him dearly,
but he tends to jump the gun.

56
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:32,147
Let me help you comprehend
the situation.

57
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:34,813
You fight for me ...

58
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:36,689
... or you never fight again.

59
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:41,522
René.

60
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,356
Hey Katrina.

61
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:01,815
Lucien.

62
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,066
You know I hate keeping people waiting.

63
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,358
Not now, Katrina. This is business.

64
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,733
Either you come now, or I leave by myself.

65
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,360
I think it would be a very wise decision
to accept my offer ...

66
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,276
... Mr. Comedian.

67
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,277
You, come with me.

68
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,527
So, what's your answer, Big Shot?

69
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,112
I'll do it.

70
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:46,694
What was that all about?

71
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:49,862
How could you embarass me like that?

72
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,487
So that was the Romeo who
left you standing at the altar.

73
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,572
That shallow two-bit clown.

74
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:57,988
Why did you do this to me?

75
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:01,071
Especially after everything
I've done for you.

76
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:04,612
If it wasn't for me, ...

77
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:08,780
you'd still be just an immigrant ...
threading needles in that filthy shop.

78
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,823
You make me do these things
that hurt you.

79
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:16,905
Please.

80
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,656
Don't do this to us.

81
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,574
You know I love.

82
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:32,532
Half before the fight. The rest after.

83
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:35,033
Maxim.

84
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:37,408
Arrange it.

85
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,534
Hey, Lucien.

86
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,034
We have a deal.

87
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,493
What made him change his mind?

88
00:08:58,826 --> 00:08:59,993
What can I tell you?

89
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:02,952
You're not the only Galgani 
who's got the goods, heh?

90
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,827
It's a pitty everyone doesn't learn
as quickly as you do.

91
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:40,663
May I help you?

92
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:42,955
No.

93
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:52,290
Is it me? Or are you just stubborn?

94
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:54,873
No.

95
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,622
It's just that I always take care of myself.

96
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,540
That's it.

97
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:17,125
You came. I knew you would.

98
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:18,333
Really?

99
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,584
Is that the way to welcome an old friend?

100
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,000
Friends?

101
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,293
Is that what we were?

102
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,001
Katrina.

103
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:29,834
I've changed.

104
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,168
I'm different now.

105
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:35,543
Alan, what do you want?

106
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,211
Did you forget about our dream?

107
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:40,627
- Going to America?
- Don't!

108
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,461
That dream is dead.

109
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:49,211
I've been sitting in my room all day
with your note.

110
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:52,128
Considering whether to see you or not.

111
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:57,086
When you didn't show up that day, ...

112
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,713
... everything around me ...

113
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:03,379
- ... began to fall apart.
- Katrina, please.

114
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,255
Let me explain.

115
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:08,588
This is not easy for me, Alan.

116
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,130
But, I'm in trouble.

117
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:16,298
I've gotta get away from Lucien.

118
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:20,922
If I don't, I know he'll
hurt me.

119
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,881
The ships to America sail from Toulon.

120
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:27,297
We can catch the midnight train.

121
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,965
Tonight.

122
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:36,965
Ladies and gentlemen, ...

123
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:39,883
... the main contest
this evening ...

124
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,133
... is between, in the blue corner ...

125
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:46,091
... weighing in at 88 and a half kilos,
Alan Lefevre.

126
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:49,508
And his opponent this evening, 
in the red corner ...

127
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:53,883
... weighing in at 88 kilos,
Julot Gaultier.

128
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:55,175
Thank you.

129
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:04,593
Julot, Julot, Julot!

130
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:15,177
Where is Katrina?

131
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:19,844
You know how she hates the fights.
She always comes late.

132
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,346
Alan, Alan. Let me through.

133
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:33,178
- You okay?
- Yeh.

134
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,429
- You've got it?
- In here.

135
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,804
Great. In the pocket.

136
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,472
- What is this?
- I'll explain later.

137
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:53,555
I want a clean fight,
gentlemen. No dirty tricks.

138
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:57,098
Let's go.

139
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,432
Come out fighting when the bell rings.

140
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:00,889
Round one.

141
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:02,932
Now.

142
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:15,807
Do make it so easy.

143
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,390
Julot, Julot, Julot!

144
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:24,225
Good!

145
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:40,060
The last time we fought Champ
I was paid to take a dive.

146
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:52,102
Two, three...

147
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:54,645
Go back to your corner.

148
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:59,645
One, two, three ...

149
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:07,563
Six, ...

150
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:10,854
Come on, get up, get up.
There's another round. Get up!

151
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,730
Time.

152
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:29,023
Okay, this is it.

153
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:30,689
This is the round.

154
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:33,357
All you gotta do is make it look good.
Okay?

155
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:35,856
Alan, Alan, look at me!

156
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,565
Stay focused!

157
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:41,524
Just hit the canvas. You got it?

158
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,650
- You got it?
- I've got it!

159
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,525
Good.

160
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:46,191
Round two.

161
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:47,773
Think about the money.

162
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,317
Galgani is your world.

163
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,567
And now he owns you.

164
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:26,944
Any last words, champ?

165
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,612
I changed my mind.

166
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:33,195
No!

167
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:36,862
No!

168
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,529
No! No! No!

169
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,739
You killed us!

170
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:53,572
Get them!

171
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:56,364
- I knew it.
- The knife.
- I knew it.
- The knife.
- Okay! Okay!

172
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:59,739
Too proud to lose a fight, 
so we lose everything!

173
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,907
We're dead!

174
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:04,156
Everything is arranged.

175
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:07,364
Excuse me. Come on!

176
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,739
You and me and Katrina, we're
leaving for America. Tonight!

177
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:13,907
Tonight! America? We'll be lucky to get
out of here alive!

178
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:19,033
- You got the tickets.
- In the envelope, hey?

179
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:25,866
- Rene, get in the car.
- Go! Go!

180
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:29,449
Come on, let's go! Go!

181
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,826
How 'bout first class tickets ...
... on an oceanliner?

182
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:38,409
Great! A month vomiting over
a railing.

183
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:40,284
What are you complaining about?

184
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:43,201
- We're finally going to America.
- What else do you want?

185
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,660
What else do I want?
Daah.

186
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,702
Slow down, we lost them.

187
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:56,744
- I'm not taking any chances.
- Hey.

188
00:16:57,743 --> 00:16:59,453
- Give me the cross.
- What? The cross?

189
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:05,912
They're gone. Trust me.

190
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,579
Maxim!

191
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:11,995
- Go back, Alan! Go back!
- Maxim!

192
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:18,787
I'm sorry.

193
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:45,124
Hold on!

194
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,249
What's your hurry, champ?

195
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,874
Rober, tell Galgani we have him.

196
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,458
Hold him!

197
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:06,875
Ouy.

198
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:08,959
There! There he is.

199
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:15,168
Rene!

200
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:39,837
Oh No!

201
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:41,961
No!

202
00:18:47,004 --> 00:18:48,045
Get him!

203
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,296
Kill him!

204
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:09,672
This way! I'm sure he went this way.

205
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,964
Lefevre, you're a dead man!

206
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:21,173
FOREIGN LEGlON

207
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,383
You'll never see him again.

208
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:42,425
If you try running away once more, ...

209
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,134
... you're dead.

210
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,470
So? You come with a mission? ...

211
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:21,221
... or you come by mistake?

212
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:26,096
Please ... be seated!

213
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:28,596
Sit!

214
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,972
Soissons, 1918.

215
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:36,722
Morocco, 1922.

216
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:40,513
So! How can we help you, Monsieur?

217
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:43,431
- I want to join the Legion.
- Aah!

218
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:46,139
But of course, you have come to
the right place.

219
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:48,640
Name, please!

220
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:00,474
But understand one thing,
Monsieur ...

221
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:03,099
... Duchamp.

222
00:21:03,474 --> 00:21:05,933
Once you sign, there is no backing out.

223
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,433
There are only three ways to return
to la Belle France.

224
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:11,933
One, fulfill your contract.

225
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:14,892
Two, disability.

226
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:16,475
And three, ...

227
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:19,642
... in a box.

228
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:46,937
MOROCCO, NORTH AFRlCA

229
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:48,395
Make room!

230
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:50,729
Out of the way!

231
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:53,812
Come on! Move you pigs!

232
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,604
"From little towns in a far
land we came ...

233
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:00,062
to save our honor ...
from a world of flames.

234
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:04,313
"In little towns in far lands
we seek ...

235
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:10,897
Whooh! Oh boy.
Go!

236
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:16,439
"And I hope that this world
we conquer for you."

237
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:24,440
March!

238
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:28,358
One, two. One, two. One, two.

239
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:31,149
One, two. Move those legs!

240
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:33,232
Sir!

241
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,817
Dismissed!

242
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:13,362
Oh! Can I have a cigarette? Heh?

243
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:19,445
Gracias!

244
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,780
It's a very good cigarette.

245
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:42,155
Look at these men. All these men who left
their homes so they could be heroes.

246
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:44,656
That is why I left.

247
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:47,364
Know why I want to be hero?

248
00:23:48,614 --> 00:23:50,281
So I can marry my Anna.

249
00:23:50,656 --> 00:23:52,823
She is my aah... fiance.

250
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:55,906
But don't tell anyone, huh?
It's a secret. Between you and me.

251
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:57,822
Because we're friends.

252
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,324
Anna's mother and father, they don't like me.

253
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,323
They say I'm a bum.

254
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:07,490
But I will show them. One day Guido will 
go home to town ...

255
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:10,908
I will have medals on my chest, maybe
even a band playing ...

256
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:15,283
Then they will say, "Guido Rosetti
is good for Anna".

257
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,825
Hey. Want to see a picture?

258
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,867
Look at that. Que bella, heh?

259
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,077
I am the luckiest man in
the world.

260
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:29,867
Allez! Move!

261
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,744
Move!

262
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,118
Move! Move!

263
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:39,243
Hey, come on! Come on! Move!

264
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:41,744
Get in line!

265
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:45,452
Put your back straight!
You are men, not dogs.

266
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:48,870
You, get into line! Tighten it up!

267
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:52,161
I thought I left this crap back in the States.

268
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,828
Where do you think you are, negro?

269
00:24:58,036 --> 00:25:01,079
You only speak when you
are spoken to. Understand?

270
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:03,579
Yes, sir.

271
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:07,788
- Come on!
- I understands all too well.

272
00:25:07,996 --> 00:25:09,454
Keep quiet!

273
00:25:10,747 --> 00:25:11,955
What the hell you lookin at?

274
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:13,788
I said keep quiet!

275
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:18,747
Eyes front! Arms at your side!

276
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,875
A Rif tribesman can gallop
like the wind.

277
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:53,833
Decapitate a man's head ...

278
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,584
... and, without stopping impale it 
on the tip of his sword ...

279
00:25:57,834 --> 00:26:00,542
... like an olive on a toothpick.

280
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,334
They exist solely for the honor of 
dying in battle.

281
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:09,085
Abd-El Krim, their leader, 
very cunning, very clever ...

282
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:12,961
... has unified the Berber tribes
into one fighting force ...

283
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:16,585
... the like of which you have never seen.

284
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:19,794
With such dreams they have wiped out ...

285
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:22,335
... over 15,000 troops.

286
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,672
Are you going to kill some camel humpers, boy?

287
00:26:35,046 --> 00:26:37,962
Yes, Sergeant Schiff! I'd like to kill thousands.

288
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:39,463
Thousands?

289
00:26:39,837 --> 00:26:41,547
If you kill one it will be a miracle.

290
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,587
They say God made man in his own image.

291
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:46,339
- He must have been drunk when He made you.
- Yes, Sergeant Schiff!

292
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:59,923
Hmmf! And what brings your lordship to
this cesspool of humanity?

293
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:03,715
Sergeant Schiff! I believe it's the
legionnaire's prerogative ...

294
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:06,340
... to withold those particulars.

295
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,090
Don't spit your prerogatives at
me English!

296
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:13,967
Your prerogative is to listen, ...

297
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,425
... learn! ... and obey.

298
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:21,133
I will break you!

299
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:23,466
Then remake you!

300
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:28,634
You will all become Legionnaires ...

301
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:32,218
... or you will surely die.

302
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,343
Do you comprehend my words?

303
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:48,427
I see that you don't!

304
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:50,928
There is a fog over your eyes ...

305
00:27:51,177 --> 00:27:53,844
... in which you can see only
your own arrogance.

306
00:27:55,678 --> 00:27:57,386
But they will clear.

307
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:09,220
You will all love the Legion ...

308
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,554
... with one body ...

309
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:13,513
... with one heart ...

310
00:28:13,804 --> 00:28:15,930
... and with one soul.

311
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:21,347
You will be legionnaires.
Cut away!

312
00:28:21,556 --> 00:28:23,472
You, take that hat off now!

313
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:28,764
You, chop this negro's hair!

314
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:32,765
Come on. Hurry, cut it off!
We don't have all day.

315
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:46,474
- Keep straight!
- Great.

316
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:50,225
Line up ladies, it's time 
for your bidet (delouse)!

317
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,559
You smell like camel shit!

318
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:12,810
They feed better slop to the pigs
back home!

319
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,726
Better get used to it.

320
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:23,644
Danke schön! (Thank you very much).
Yah!

321
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:26,811
Yah!
Bruner does not have enough to eat.

322
00:29:32,644 --> 00:29:33,686
Heeey! Enough!

323
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,312
That's enough! Sit down!

324
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:38,853
- Sit down!
- Hey!

325
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:53,855
You don't want to push that jackass
too far.

326
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:55,980
You're not exactly his favorite.

327
00:29:56,856 --> 00:29:58,897
I know what it's like to be
an underdog.

328
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:03,190
Who doesn't?

329
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:09,398
What the hell do you know? White boy!

330
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:13,940
Shiiit!

331
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:23,191
Ooh friend, have you got cigarette?

332
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:27,274
Have I shown you photo of my Anna?

333
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:35,735
Sorry about what happened earlier.

334
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:38,775
I just ain't used to being treated as human.

335
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:40,109
That's okay.

336
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:43,193
You don't know what it's like for
us back in the States.

337
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:45,651
Them white folks is crazy.

338
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:50,527
Always some white gal blaming rape
on an innocent Black man.

339
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,653
You?

340
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:55,527
Not that time.

341
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:59,153
I was fingered for committing murder.

342
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,278
You ever been accused of
something you never did?

343
00:31:09,113 --> 00:31:10,112
Yah.

344
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:14,445
The old folks used to talk about Africa.

345
00:31:15,863 --> 00:31:19,070
Sounded like a place I could get
a shot at being a man.

346
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:27,197
Hitch? This hitch was my quickest route.

347
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,530
I figured after five years ...

348
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:38,906
I'd have me some money ... keep
heading down south ...

349
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:41,989
... chasing my dream.

350
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:46,532
The only thing that keeps a man living.

351
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,991
Got to have a dream.

352
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:58,616
- I think this wins, gentlemen.
- Shit!

353
00:31:59,324 --> 00:32:02,366
Oh, don't get upset. It's only a game.

354
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:11,576
Come, join us for a couple of hands!

355
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,201
No! No, thank you.

356
00:32:14,784 --> 00:32:16,283
Are you insulting me boy?

357
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,618
No, I do not know how to play.

358
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,701
No, I'm the one who's going to play.

359
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:25,535
You lend me some money and
we split it 50-50.

360
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:29,078
- I have no money.
- Don't make me look for it boy!

361
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:31,369
Maybe tomorrow.

362
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:36,578
- I don't want to fight you.
- Yah? Well, I do.

363
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:44,871
What's wrong with you?
I don't want to fight.

364
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:53,330
Let him go!

365
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:54,954
Who asked you?

366
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,247
I said ... let him go!

367
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:06,621
Leave him!

368
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:18,457
Gentlemen, I bet one pound
the Frenchman will win.

369
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:22,832
Any denomination.
German marks, liras ...

370
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:48,876
Thank you, gentlemen.

371
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:54,127
Anyone more bets?

372
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:16,296
Let's keep it sporting, shall we?

373
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:17,420
Well done!

374
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:21,337
Gentlemen, I'm so sorry.

375
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:27,004
That was the best ruff house
I've seen this side of the war ferry.

376
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:29,296
Name's Mackintosh.

377
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:31,338
- Alan.
- Alan?

378
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:32,588
Alan Duchamp.

379
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:34,297
This business with the elbow ...

380
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:41,255
Get out of your beds, you filthy bastards!

381
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,881
You can shit, you can shave, but ...

382
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:46,089
... you must move!

383
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:49,548
Get out! Pee in your pants if you need to, but move!

384
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:51,548
Get out you scum!

385
00:34:58,298 --> 00:34:59,883
Move! Alez! (Come on!)

386
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,549
Quick! Quick! Quick!

387
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,383
Come on, you'll never overcome the
Rif at that pace.

388
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:42,385
Sit down and rest.

389
00:35:43,596 --> 00:35:44,595
Fantastic.

390
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:48,262
Some of you are making a
reasonable impersonation of ...

391
00:35:48,803 --> 00:35:50,137
... being men.

392
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:54,220
And since I'm in a particularly 
good mood, ...

393
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:56,804
I'm going to offer you a treat.

394
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:01,971
Rocks.

395
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,930
Yes, rocks.

396
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:13,514
Come on! Move!

397
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,432
Lift your legs up!

398
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,307
In line you dog!

399
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:29,516
Get your legs up!

400
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:33,474
Leave him, he came for himself.

401
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:37,558
This is the Legion.
You march or you die.

402
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:40,516
What is it? What is this "march
or die"?

403
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:43,058
Precisely that.

404
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:45,143
Loyalty is a virtue.

405
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,892
But in the desert nothing
interferes with survival.

406
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,351
You cut your losses ...

407
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:53,018
... and you move on.

408
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:15,144
Stay with me. Come on,
keep your elbows going.

409
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:26,812
It'll be over before you know it!

410
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:30,063
Guido move! Come on!

411
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:32,396
Come on Guido! Move!

412
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,357
You!

413
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:17,317
Come with me!

414
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:19,275
At least you look the part.

415
00:38:26,942 --> 00:38:29,318
These men are from the International News Association.

416
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:31,860
Your ugly mugs will be seem all
over the world.

417
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:34,944
Do us proud!

418
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:36,984
- Sir, I would like to be excused!

419
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:39,736
You will uphold the honor of the Legion.

420
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:03,196
Mom is not here to do it for you.

421
00:39:04,362 --> 00:39:05,280
Hey Mac is that soap?

422
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:08,613
The first thing the Colonel taught me.

423
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:11,405
Always carry a bar of soap.

424
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:14,071
Never rely on the military for
personal needs.

425
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:17,197
And you certainly can't expect 
this kind of luxury in the Legion.

426
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,364
- Use it sparingly!
- Got any soap?

427
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:31,157
See now.

428
00:39:31,656 --> 00:39:33,449
Hey, how you doing. This is soap.

429
00:39:34,157 --> 00:39:37,448
Throw it down. Lather it up real good.

430
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:39,491
No, no, no, no, your wasting it!

431
00:39:40,283 --> 00:39:43,241
All you need to do is just a few 
short firm strokes.

432
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:46,158
No! No! It's in the dunking.

433
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,283
Anna always say you dunk.

434
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:50,326
My dear fellow ... what good is it soaking it?

435
00:39:50,783 --> 00:39:52,908
Soak it! Soak it!

436
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:55,660
Stop! Stop!

437
00:39:56,617 --> 00:39:58,451
I get it. I get it.

438
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:00,326
Alright! Alright, you got it.

439
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:02,285
Do mine too?

440
00:40:03,826 --> 00:40:04,826
Who's Anna?

441
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,327
- I don't tell you about Anna?
- Nah.

442
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:10,743
Let me tell you about the most 
beautiful Angel in the world.

443
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:13,160
Oh she's lovely. Is she a relation of you?

444
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,911
- No, she's my fiance.
- No! ...

445
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:23,870
It's amazing, this is crazier than
Burbon street in New Orleans.

446
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:26,078
Legionnaire, come with me?

447
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:29,704
I'll come anywhere you want to take me, girl.
We're on leave.

448
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:36,246
- Alright, show me the door.
- Hey, what is this place? Heh?

449
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:38,704
We really should go to a 
European establishment.

450
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:53,705
This is the place.

451
00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:57,373
If you all don't like the merchandise don't 
buy it. But, this store is alright by me.

452
00:40:57,623 --> 00:41:00,414
Two seconds, my friends they need me very much.

453
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:01,790
Come on girl.

454
00:41:03,957 --> 00:41:06,707
Desertion of one's comrades in the face of the enemy ...

455
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,165
... is punishable by firing squad if
I'm not mistaken.

456
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,041
Not tonight my dear.

457
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,583
What's wrong? You don't like girls?

458
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,208
Of course not. I'm British.

459
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,708
Later, yes? Later.

460
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:26,917
How much?

461
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,250
- Twenty.
- For both of us?

462
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,458
- For both of us?

463
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:33,667
Wooh! Wooh! Wooh! 
This is not such a good idea.

464
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:35,917
You no understand.

465
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:38,418
My Anna she may not like this. Okay?

466
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,460
Just think of it as training ...

467
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:44,918
... for the army.

468
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,544
Training?

469
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:52,002
Ah, like hitting the bullseye.

470
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:55,670
Practice makes perfect.

471
00:41:55,878 --> 00:41:58,044
- Okay! Okay, I'll do it.
- Yes, come on now.

472
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:16,130
Scotts' Guards.

473
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:19,338
We marched into Damascus
with General Allenby.

474
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:21,797
We freed Arabia from the Turks.

475
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,130
So I picked up a few
phrases down the years.

476
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,464
Most of them are pretty
useless outside of brothels, frankly.

477
00:43:20,385 --> 00:43:22,427
Every Saturday night ...

478
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:24,303
We sneak out to be ...
together.

479
00:43:25,053 --> 00:43:28,637
We spend hours just walking, 
and talking ...

480
00:43:29,554 --> 00:43:31,594
... and sometimes, only sometimes, ...

481
00:43:32,095 --> 00:43:33,886
... after a glass of wine ...

482
00:43:35,221 --> 00:43:37,053
... we even kiss.

483
00:43:57,889 --> 00:43:59,347
What about a drink?

484
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:09,182
Honor was my lot.

485
00:44:10,974 --> 00:44:15,140
My father, the Colonel, drummed
it into me from the time I was a boy.

486
00:44:16,432 --> 00:44:17,641
He was ...

487
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:19,849
Well, he was my hero.

488
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:25,141
But I never quite managed to live up
to the standard that he set.

489
00:44:26,516 --> 00:44:29,266
You know, It always struck me as 
rather odd that a man ...

490
00:44:29,474 --> 00:44:32,434
... can be glorified for
pillage and murder.

491
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:35,643
But, ostracized for dishonor.

492
00:44:37,434 --> 00:44:40,809
That is something I wouldn't wish
on anyone.

493
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:43,685
Is that why you left the military?

494
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:49,310
Dishonorably discharged, to be
precise.

495
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,936
What was the problem?

496
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:54,477
I like to gamble ...

497
00:44:54,686 --> 00:44:55,769
... Alan.

498
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,643
I can't help myself.

499
00:44:58,936 --> 00:45:01,603
Is the devil and it's the love of my life.

500
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:04,312
And there's nothing else I ...

501
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:07,020
Well ...

502
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:10,228
Nothing else will do.

503
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:13,520
And the higher the stakes ...

504
00:45:14,353 --> 00:45:15,771
... the more I like it.

505
00:45:17,687 --> 00:45:20,564
Of course, it doesn't really become
a problem ...

506
00:45:21,313 --> 00:45:22,855
... until I lose.

507
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,772
Then I have to do sordid things like ...

508
00:45:27,022 --> 00:45:29,063
... write bad checks.

509
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:36,814
They stripped me of my command 
in front of my men.

510
00:45:38,898 --> 00:45:42,273
Some of them had been with me
nearly 15 years.

511
00:45:45,856 --> 00:45:47,440
But that was the easy part.

512
00:45:49,982 --> 00:45:52,648
See the disappointment in the old
man's eyes ...

513
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:57,858
... was a wound that doesn't heal.

514
00:46:02,566 --> 00:46:03,899
I know that feeling.

515
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:08,067
And the first time I saw it ...

516
00:46:08,734 --> 00:46:10,150
... in Katrina's eyes.

517
00:46:12,526 --> 00:46:13,776
What went wrong?

518
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:18,026
When I first met her I thought I changed.

519
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,193
We had a dream. Get married.

520
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,485
Go to America.

521
00:46:24,777 --> 00:46:26,694
But I couldn't do it.

522
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:28,695
You ran.

523
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,027
Well we've all run old man.

524
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:35,570
That's why we're here, isn't it?

525
00:46:41,945 --> 00:46:43,487
I have to find her.

526
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:45,237
Listen.

527
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:49,529
When we're thru with this stint,
I'll help you to find her.

528
00:46:50,738 --> 00:46:52,029
Your Katrina.

529
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:54,946
You have my word.

530
00:47:02,947 --> 00:47:03,781
Thanks.

531
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,405
But, why me?

532
00:47:07,906 --> 00:47:09,323
My brother was murdered.

533
00:47:10,114 --> 00:47:12,698
You were the one who suggested Lefevre
in the first place.

534
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:14,907
I hold you just as responsible.

535
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:17,822
That's crazy! Who knows when that
photograph was taken?

536
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:19,948
The guy could be anywhere.

537
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:22,865
I don't give a damn what it takes.

538
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,158
I want that bastard dead.

539
00:47:26,282 --> 00:47:29,325
Viktor will be along to watch your back.

540
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,700
Set your guard to boot!

541
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:39,116
I'm Captain Charlier, your
new commanding officer.

542
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,034
We are being sent to Fort Bernelle, ...

543
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,617
... the last French stronghold
between us and Abd-El Krim.

544
00:47:46,077 --> 00:47:49,868
This self-proclaimed Arab leader has 
taken his forces deep ...

545
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,701
... into French territory destroying 
9 of our outposts.

546
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,702
The Legionnaires defending these positions 
were all brutally slaughtered ...

547
00:47:58,452 --> 00:48:02,618
... and those who did not die immediately,
were tortured in a despicable manner.

548
00:48:03,411 --> 00:48:04,786
We leave at dawn.

549
00:48:05,203 --> 00:48:06,286
Sgt. Schiff.

550
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,286
A word of advice.

551
00:48:09,828 --> 00:48:13,328
I suggest that you keep one
last bullet in your pocket ...

552
00:48:13,996 --> 00:48:17,203
... not for your enemy, but
for yourselves.

553
00:48:43,956 --> 00:48:47,039
Hey Alan, how far you think this Fort is?

554
00:48:48,373 --> 00:48:49,498
I don't know, Guido.

555
00:48:51,332 --> 00:48:52,498
What do you think, Mac?

556
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:55,749
About a mile closer than the
last time you asked.

557
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:19,750
I have a bad feeling in the stomach.

558
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,626
It's hunger.

559
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:23,376
Don't joke with me.

560
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:26,626
I don't think I'm going to make it.

561
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,377
What are you saying?

562
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:30,585
You're going to make it.

563
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:32,461
I'm not so sure.

564
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:36,210
Look, the fort is not so far.

565
00:49:36,752 --> 00:49:39,128
Just concentrate on getting there, okay?

566
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:45,420
Will you promise me if I don't make it
you will tell Anna.

567
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:48,670
Promise me, heh?

568
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,796
I promise. I'll will tell your Anna.

569
00:49:51,629 --> 00:49:52,920
But you gonna make it.

570
00:49:53,503 --> 00:49:55,171
- Yeh.
- Okay?

571
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,712
- You're gonna make it.
- Yes.

572
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:38,049
Guido, we've only been marching three days.

573
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:39,925
Who knows how long we got.

574
00:50:40,759 --> 00:50:43,550
Out here your whole life is
in your canteen.

575
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,343
Every drop is precious.
Right?

576
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:49,884
So when you do drink, do so wisely.

577
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:51,176
Quiet!

578
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,677
Come on! Move!

579
00:50:57,802 --> 00:50:58,885
Let's go!

580
00:51:04,176 --> 00:51:05,176
Guido.

581
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:08,302
- You should have told us.
- I'm a Legionnaire.

582
00:51:08,635 --> 00:51:10,011
Legionnaires march or die, okay?

583
00:51:10,261 --> 00:51:12,469
Don't buy in to that Legionnaire crap.

584
00:51:12,968 --> 00:51:14,928
It don't mean nothing out here.

585
00:51:15,512 --> 00:51:17,720
It's about surviving. All we got
is each other.

586
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,595
- I'm not a baby!
- Luther is right.
- Give him your foot lad!

587
00:51:21,637 --> 00:51:23,136
We won't think any less of you.

588
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:25,804
This has nothing to do
with your manhood.

589
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:30,346
If we stick together we'll make it back home.

590
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:33,096
Listen, you'll make it.

591
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:34,971
Trust me.

592
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,597
One big empty country.

593
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,848
Big it is. But I promise you empty
it is not.

594
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:51,222
They're out there waiting,
watching, ...

595
00:51:52,388 --> 00:51:55,140
... planning when and how they're 
going to kill us.

596
00:51:56,764 --> 00:51:58,307
We're the intruders, Luther.

597
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:00,557
It's their country.

598
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:03,891
And every man, woman and child ...

599
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:07,266
will give up their lives ... before
they'll give it up to us.

600
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,976
Guido, don't let it get to you.

601
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:16,850
Come on.

602
00:52:31,727 --> 00:52:33,809
Stay in line! Move it!

603
00:53:05,522 --> 00:53:07,271
- Guido!
- Leave him alone!
- Get up!

604
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,938
- I no can go on.
- Come on Guido, get up!

605
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,064
- I no can go on.
- Get back!

606
00:53:13,105 --> 00:53:14,189
- March!

607
00:53:15,314 --> 00:53:16,396
Back in line!

608
00:53:16,606 --> 00:53:18,731
Get up! On your feet!

609
00:53:24,356 --> 00:53:26,981
He needs some time to rest.
He's weak.

610
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,148
The man is mentally weak.

611
00:53:29,648 --> 00:53:32,232
Physical weakness is nothing a 
night's sleep can't cure.

612
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:35,398
This man is incurable.

613
00:53:36,315 --> 00:53:37,691
You always tell us ...

614
00:53:38,523 --> 00:53:40,857
... the Legion ... is a family!

615
00:53:41,066 --> 00:53:45,191
Don't tell me about the Legion!

616
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:47,775
Now. Leave him!

617
00:53:48,649 --> 00:53:49,649
No!

618
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:53,316
I left a friend to die once before.

619
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:57,484
Then carry your friend.
Give him your water.

620
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,401
Give him your blood for all I care.

621
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:02,485
But I will not sap the strength ...

622
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:05,234
... of sixty men to save two!

623
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,110
Corporal!

624
00:54:07,901 --> 00:54:10,319
Pick up those rifles!
On the march. Move!

625
00:54:11,026 --> 00:54:12,276
- He's finished.
- Let's go! March!

626
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:14,111
- March! 

627
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,528
We'll never make it. Leave me!

628
00:54:21,403 --> 00:54:22,694
We've got this far.

629
00:54:23,569 --> 00:54:25,778
We'll make it. We will.

630
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:28,944
Move it!

631
00:55:40,285 --> 00:55:41,826
Water! Water!

632
00:56:09,162 --> 00:56:10,829
It's a bloody circus!

633
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,580
Someone's gotta talk some sense into these idiots.

634
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:16,247
Shit!

635
00:56:16,955 --> 00:56:19,746
Sir, with the greatest possible respect, ...

636
00:56:19,996 --> 00:56:21,914
... might I suggest sentries on 
the high ground?

637
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,955
At the moment we're nothing more
than a flock of sitting ducks.

638
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:28,289
- Ah, a military expert.
- He is right, Sergeant Schiff.

639
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:31,205
See to it!

640
00:56:33,998 --> 00:56:35,081
Very well, English.

641
00:56:35,581 --> 00:56:38,291
Unpack the heavy machine gun.
Take it to your high ground.

642
00:56:38,915 --> 00:56:42,624
By the way, you and your comrad
will be the last to drink water.

643
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:48,499
Thanks, Mac.

644
00:56:48,707 --> 00:56:51,249
I don't mind drinking mud
for the next couple days.

645
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:53,916
Better mud than blood my friend.

646
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:09,834
Good.

647
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:12,252
We can cover most of the ground from here.

648
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:44,087
- Take cover!
- Take cover!

649
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,588
Get down! Take cover!

650
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,963
Down! Down! Down!

651
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,922
Return fire!

652
00:58:02,005 --> 00:58:04,548
Get down! Return fire!

653
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,923
You're safe here.

654
00:58:13,674 --> 00:58:15,757
- Keep down!
- I want to fight.

655
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:18,715
Just stay here.

656
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:20,091
Guido.

657
00:58:44,592 --> 00:58:47,052
Sergeant, get your men behind those rocks!

658
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:48,510
Luther, behind you!

659
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:02,678
Fall back!

660
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:04,553
Form two lines!

661
00:59:25,846 --> 00:59:27,472
Protect the ammo!

662
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:31,848
What the hell's going on!

663
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:36,223
The ammo.

664
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,598
They're after the ammo.

665
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:00,433
Guido!

666
01:00:27,978 --> 01:00:28,895
It's over.

667
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:45,187
Just beginning.

668
01:01:12,355 --> 01:01:13,982
At least he died ...

669
01:01:14,606 --> 01:01:15,898
... a Legionnaire.

670
01:01:16,356 --> 01:01:17,315
Yes.

671
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,148
He proved himself a Legionnaire.

672
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:23,356
And so did 19 other brave Legionnaires  
who died for us today.

673
01:01:24,274 --> 01:01:28,357
So,when I give an order it's not because
I like the sound of my own voice, ...

674
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:32,108
... I do it for the benefit of the whole 
company, not just the individual.

675
01:01:32,524 --> 01:01:36,234
I hope at last you understand that.

676
01:01:37,608 --> 01:01:38,941
Corporal Metz.

677
01:01:39,274 --> 01:01:40,358
Move out!

678
01:01:40,526 --> 01:01:43,109
You heard. Move it!

679
01:01:50,984 --> 01:01:52,485
Move! Allez! (Come on!)

680
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,198
I was expecting a full company.

681
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:53,114
- Where's your commanding officer?
- Lost in an ambush.

682
01:02:53,408 --> 01:02:55,782
Along with the ammo and supplies
so it seems.

683
01:02:56,115 --> 01:02:57,824
- Come on! This way!
- Deserters?

684
01:02:58,448 --> 01:02:59,408
lnsubordination.

685
01:02:59,782 --> 01:03:02,032
Put them on work detail, immediately!

686
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:06,033
We have much work. Pick up
your tools and move out!

687
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:13,117
You did all you could for Guido.

688
01:03:13,908 --> 01:03:15,574
You gave him a second chance.

689
01:03:15,868 --> 01:03:17,910
And what did Guido do with it?

690
01:03:19,492 --> 01:03:21,200
He saved Steinkampf.

691
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:31,035
Insubordination my ass!

692
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:33,119
What kind of crazy army is this anyway?

693
01:03:33,327 --> 01:03:34,327
A French one.

694
01:03:34,535 --> 01:03:36,868
Yeh, we saved their asses
and they punish us for it.

695
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:39,411
I should have shot that fool when
I had the chance.

696
01:03:39,578 --> 01:03:42,286
- With your aim?
- What are you complaining about?

697
01:03:43,077 --> 01:03:45,203
- At least we've got water.
- Yes, and without mud.

698
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:47,495
Steinkampf must be getting a soft 
spot for us.

699
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:49,579
Get back to work, now!

700
01:03:50,203 --> 01:03:51,204
Move!

701
01:03:54,955 --> 01:03:57,288
- Come on, gang of vagrants,
keep working.
- Okay, Seargent.

702
01:04:08,872 --> 01:04:10,413
How fortunate for us.

703
01:04:10,622 --> 01:04:12,915
At least this Platoon got through
the Rifs.

704
01:04:13,581 --> 01:04:15,414
Have them unload the supplies.

705
01:04:16,705 --> 01:04:18,956
You three, unpack the ammo.

706
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,123
What there is of it.

707
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,417
So, you don't always win, English.

708
01:04:51,709 --> 01:04:53,084
Mind if I join you?

709
01:04:54,626 --> 01:04:56,250
It's good to see an old face ...

710
01:04:56,835 --> 01:04:58,335
... even as ugly as your's.

711
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,418
Still the comedian.

712
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:04,085
We've been close, but never introduced.

713
01:05:04,627 --> 01:05:05,960
Screw you!

714
01:05:08,003 --> 01:05:11,669
My friends I would like to introduce 
you to Julot and ...

715
01:05:12,043 --> 01:05:13,295
... aah "Screw you!".

716
01:05:14,086 --> 01:05:15,628
Laugh while you still can.

717
01:05:17,961 --> 01:05:21,254
You know, until today I thought I
was the biggest idiot on earth.

718
01:05:22,045 --> 01:05:23,045
But you guys ...

719
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,295
You want to know what happened to
your little bitch?

720
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,129
I want to thank you ...

721
01:05:34,254 --> 01:05:36,297
... because when I joined the 
Foreign Legion ...

722
01:05:36,463 --> 01:05:38,297
... I didn't care if I lived or died.

723
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:41,004
Now that you're here ...

724
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,548
... I think that I'll stick around.

725
01:05:51,922 --> 01:05:54,048
Company, guard to boot!

726
01:05:55,007 --> 01:05:58,590
Starting today we'll be sending out
reconnaisance patrols ...

727
01:05:58,965 --> 01:06:00,632
... on a daily basis.

728
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,090
Sargent Schiff.

729
01:06:04,591 --> 01:06:07,715
The following Legionnaires will
step forward for the day's patrol.

730
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:09,758
Bruner.

731
01:06:11,383 --> 01:06:12,466
Desparbes.

732
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:14,216
Duchamp.

733
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:16,467
Ehrhardt.

734
01:06:17,091 --> 01:06:18,091
Glock.

735
01:06:19,467 --> 01:06:20,466
Junger.

736
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,509
Klems.

737
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,134
Mackintosh.

738
01:06:28,593 --> 01:06:31,301
Legionnaires, dismissed!

739
01:06:41,052 --> 01:06:42,094
Halt!

740
01:06:43,178 --> 01:06:44,594
You, come with me!

741
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:40,391
Mac?

742
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,308
The rifle, Alan.

743
01:07:45,642 --> 01:07:48,724
Sorry old chap, but this appears 
to be my second chance.

744
01:07:50,892 --> 01:07:51,892
Why?

745
01:07:54,308 --> 01:07:55,433
Money!

746
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:59,184
What happened about looking
after your friends?

747
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,601
My father paid off all my debts.

748
01:08:04,976 --> 01:08:07,768
The disgrace nearly killed him.

749
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:11,435
Now, I have a chance ...

750
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:14,894
... to make my peace with him.

751
01:08:16,727 --> 01:08:18,270
Are you the one ...

752
01:08:19,312 --> 01:08:20,853
... who gets to pull the trigger?

753
01:08:24,478 --> 01:08:25,853
I deliver you.

754
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,395
I lead them out of the desert.

755
01:08:28,978 --> 01:08:30,937
You took the word of Galgani?

756
01:08:31,771 --> 01:08:32,771
And these two?

757
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:36,063
He gets half the money now.

758
01:08:36,438 --> 01:08:38,438
Monsier Galgani will honor the rest.

759
01:08:42,355 --> 01:08:43,521
Honor?

760
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:50,647
On your feet! Shoot!

761
01:08:58,106 --> 01:08:59,189
On your feet!

762
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:01,564
Julot, my rifle!

763
01:09:02,982 --> 01:09:04,232
Keep moving!

764
01:09:05,898 --> 01:09:07,273
Towards the dune.

765
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,899
Take cover!

766
01:09:24,858 --> 01:09:27,234
Go! I will cover you!

767
01:09:27,568 --> 01:09:29,234
- Go!
- Come on!

768
01:09:49,194 --> 01:09:50,486
Don't look back!

769
01:10:46,324 --> 01:10:49,115
I can't always be around to
save your asses, friends?

770
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:56,242
What is wrong with Mac?

771
01:10:59,867 --> 01:11:01,367
What the hell's wrong with you?

772
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,078
Wear this.

773
01:11:39,578 --> 01:11:41,787
So you'll know I'm always with you.

774
01:12:04,415 --> 01:12:06,081
They attack us. Fast.
On the double! Move quickly!

775
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:13,247
Everyone on the wall!

776
01:12:17,415 --> 01:12:19,832
Make every bullet count!

777
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:29,749
Guess we didn't do such a good job
on the barbed wire, heh?

778
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:49,793
Take cover, they're throwing grenades.

779
01:12:55,127 --> 01:12:56,502
Where the hell did they get it?

780
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:58,711
They don't stand a chance against us.

781
01:12:59,337 --> 01:13:00,628
Don't underestimate them.

782
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:02,670
Or anyone else, heh?

783
01:13:34,006 --> 01:13:35,839
Mac! Mac!
- Damn it!

784
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,548
- Shit!
- I have no ...Alan!

785
01:13:38,798 --> 01:13:39,757
Help me.

786
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:42,756
Come on, man! Come on!

787
01:13:52,798 --> 01:13:53,757
Come on!

788
01:14:29,136 --> 01:14:30,261
The ammo!

789
01:14:47,845 --> 01:14:48,928
We didn't do too bad.

790
01:14:49,887 --> 01:14:51,263
We're finished ...

791
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:53,680
We have no ammunition.

792
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,432
How are you doing, English?

793
01:15:20,306 --> 01:15:22,306
Oh, I think I'll pull thru Sir.

794
01:15:23,473 --> 01:15:26,266
What rank were you in your 
British Army?

795
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:30,016
Julot! Major of Infantry.

796
01:15:30,975 --> 01:15:33,391
Well, as of now you're a Sargent
of the Legion.

797
01:15:37,808 --> 01:15:38,767
Sargent.

798
01:15:39,892 --> 01:15:41,768
Be spare with compliments but ...

799
01:15:42,309 --> 01:15:45,684
... the men have done well.
Would you tell them that?

800
01:15:50,517 --> 01:15:52,726
Perhaps they would like to hear it from you, Sir.

801
01:15:58,435 --> 01:16:00,019
I expect they would.

802
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:08,185
Major of the Infantry, heh?

803
01:16:09,853 --> 01:16:11,895
It fits him like a brand new suit.

804
01:16:12,686 --> 01:16:14,812
It's what's inside a man that counts.

805
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:18,228
I feel a lot better now that he's
running the show.

806
01:16:18,478 --> 01:16:21,063
Hell, he probably already figured
a way out of here.

807
01:16:22,146 --> 01:16:23,646
Hey, Major Mac.

808
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:26,396
We need to talk.

809
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:28,396
Now!

810
01:16:30,895 --> 01:16:33,813
Without ammo we won't last another day.

811
01:16:35,772 --> 01:16:38,605
Between two of the Rif encampments
there's some open ground.

812
01:16:38,814 --> 01:16:41,730
Our only hope is to get a message thru
to Fort Corbiere ...

813
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:43,898
... to send reinforcements.

814
01:16:45,898 --> 01:16:47,356
Let me guess.

815
01:16:48,107 --> 01:16:49,815
We're the volunteers.

816
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:53,358
No, the private here, ...

817
01:16:54,649 --> 01:16:56,232
... he can pass as a native.

818
01:17:01,441 --> 01:17:02,649
It's suicide.

819
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:06,108
Luther.

820
01:17:07,566 --> 01:17:09,774
If I could go with you I would.

821
01:17:14,525 --> 01:17:15,860
Then I'm going with him.

822
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,025
No.

823
01:17:22,151 --> 01:17:23,693
He goes alone!

824
01:17:39,069 --> 01:17:41,111
Came out here to find a life.

825
01:17:41,277 --> 01:17:43,569
But I realize I've been looking
in the wrong place.

826
01:17:44,195 --> 01:17:46,070
It ain't out here.

827
01:17:47,154 --> 01:17:48,570
In here.

828
01:17:49,945 --> 01:17:53,154
It's like you said, we all brothers
out here, ...

829
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:54,861
... whether we like it or not.

830
01:17:55,946 --> 01:17:57,529
Whatever Mac's done ...

831
01:17:58,363 --> 01:17:59,613
... let it go.

832
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:01,697
When the time comes ...

833
01:18:03,529 --> 01:18:05,197
... he'll be there for you.

834
01:18:12,447 --> 01:18:13,780
One for the pocket.

835
01:18:20,489 --> 01:18:21,948
Why don't you hold on to this for me?

836
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:24,615
No.

837
01:18:24,865 --> 01:18:28,156
Come on. I can't chance losing it
out there.

838
01:18:28,824 --> 01:18:30,032
Play a tune.

839
01:18:30,574 --> 01:18:31,865
"Voilà du boudin".

840
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:33,615
"Voilà du boudin".

841
01:18:44,741 --> 01:18:45,867
Good luck.

842
01:18:48,408 --> 01:18:49,658
I don't need it.

843
01:19:05,202 --> 01:19:06,702
This is aah ...

844
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,494
... this is the part I never had the
stomach for.

845
01:19:13,243 --> 01:19:16,619
Sending them out there when you know 
damn well what their chances are.

846
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,208
This your life?

847
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:13,916
We're going to die here today.

848
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:25,590
No, no!

849
01:22:38,471 --> 01:22:39,721
Make it quick, brother.

850
01:23:24,558 --> 01:23:25,892
Hold your fire.

851
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:37,643
Look. They're on all sides.

852
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:39,226
Come on, cover!

853
01:23:55,061 --> 01:23:56,269
Protect the entrance.

854
01:23:57,436 --> 01:23:58,979
Come, come with me.

855
01:24:06,312 --> 01:24:07,395
Hold your fire!

856
01:24:07,562 --> 01:24:09,895
Wait until they're in range.

857
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:22,480
Push!

858
01:24:38,357 --> 01:24:39,649
Fire!

859
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:11,484
Protect the gate!
Ready to fire.

860
01:25:56,906 --> 01:25:58,281
Julot, come on!

861
01:26:11,365 --> 01:26:12,365
Let's go!

862
01:26:13,657 --> 01:26:17,573
If I were a gambling man, I'd have 
my money on the Rifs.

863
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:48,785
I'll finish with you man!

864
01:27:04,037 --> 01:27:05,162
Alan.

865
01:27:06,037 --> 01:27:08,078
I was never paid to take a dive.

866
01:28:57,671 --> 01:28:59,046
Just tell me ...

867
01:28:59,921 --> 01:29:01,296
... Is she safe.

868
01:29:01,922 --> 01:29:03,172
You'll never know.

869
01:29:08,506 --> 01:29:10,589
What he forgot to say ...

870
01:29:12,006 --> 01:29:14,340
... is that she ran away from Galgani.

871
01:29:21,965 --> 01:29:23,800
She went to America.

872
01:29:24,716 --> 01:29:26,799
Something about a dream.

873
01:29:34,424 --> 01:29:36,925
Couldn't let it happen that way old man.

874
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,009
They'll be back again soon.

875
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:00,302
Listen ...

876
01:30:01,052 --> 01:30:02,926
If by some miracle, ...

877
01:30:03,886 --> 01:30:05,636
... you get out of this, ...

878
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:08,385
... would you do me a favor?

879
01:30:11,844 --> 01:30:14,762
Give a kiss to your Katrina
for me, will you?

880
01:31:46,353 --> 01:31:49,646
"From little towns in a far land
we came ...

881
01:31:50,062 --> 01:31:53,270
to save our honor ...
and a world in flames.

882
01:31:54,104 --> 01:31:57,145
In little towns of a far land we sleep.

883
01:31:57,521 --> 01:32:00,062
And trust that world we won ...

884
01:32:00,647 --> 01:32:02,355
... for you to keep".

885
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:57,819
For centuries, my people have
roamed across this land.

886
01:32:58,443 --> 01:33:00,901
It has always been our home.

887
01:33:01,984 --> 01:33:03,777
In our culture, ...

888
01:33:03,944 --> 01:33:07,277
... a man who has courage is 
valued above all.

889
01:33:07,903 --> 01:33:11,361
For this reason I will allow you to live.

890
01:33:13,986 --> 01:33:16,028
Take a message to your leader.

891
01:33:19,029 --> 01:33:21,153
This is what awaits them ...

892
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:24,904
... if they continue invading our country.
