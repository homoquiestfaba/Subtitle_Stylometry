1
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,188
Yeah!

2
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,357
On the 15th of May, in the jungle of Nool,

3
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,736
in the heat of the day,
in the cool of the pool,

4
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:43,239
he was splashing,
enjoying the jungle's great joys,

5
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:50,079
When Horton the Elephant
heard a small noise.

6
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,883
- Horton!
- Horton!

7
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:04,969
Good morning, class. Are you ready?

8
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:07,096
- Yeah!
- Jump on board!

9
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,808
Look out below!

10
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,727
Tommy's on board. Katie, you there?

11
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,107
Okay.

12
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,528
There it is.

13
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:25,824
This is one of the jungle's most
amazing creatures, the leaf bug.

14
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,578
In order to protect itself from predators,
it disguises itself as a leaf.

15
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,712
This one's got quite a grip.
Come on, little buddy.

16
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:41,297
Don't be shy.

17
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,344
I guess I was mistaken, kids.

18
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,973
There are obviously no leaf bugs
in this area. Even if...

19
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:51,766
No, they're on me!

20
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,898
I think I swallowed one!

21
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,109
Tommy! Pull it out!

22
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,861
Uh, okay.

23
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,869
Then humpfing a "humpf"
was a sour Kangaroo,

24
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:13,997
the type who's convinced
she knows better than you.

25
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:17,250
She made every law
and enforced every rule

26
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,587
as self-proclaimed
head of the jungle of Nool.

27
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,882
Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?

28
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,467
How many times have I told you that

29
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,803
the jungle is no place
to act like a wild animal.

30
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:42,108
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric.

31
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:45,069
And the children are learning
so much from him.

32
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:48,364
Learning to be a bunch
of harebrained half-wits!

33
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,534
And that's why my Rudy
is pouch-schooled.

34
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,662
So while Kangaroo
stood there, sneering a sneer...

35
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,247
Horton, that was the best time
I've ever had in my life!

36
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,373
What are you gonna show us next?

37
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:02,378
...once again, the speck floated
right by Horton's ear.

38
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:06,716
Then he heard it again,
just a very faint yelp,

39
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:09,260
as if some tiny person
were calling for help.

40
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:14,390
And you know what he thought?

41
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:16,309
Why, he thought that
there must be someone

42
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,270
on top of that small speck of dust!

43
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:21,689
Or even a family, it just might be so,

44
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,526
a family with children
just starting to grow.

45
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,613
I want to live!

46
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:34,077
I gotta go. Katie, you're in charge!

47
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:39,624
Wait!

48
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:41,793
- Come back!
- Watch it!

49
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:10,238
One more! One more! One more!

50
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:19,205
- I hear someone coming!
- Give me those!

51
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:22,459
- Wait!
- Sound the alarm!

52
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:28,631
Excuse me. Pardon my stampede!

53
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,927
Sorry, Wickershams! I promise
I'm gonna clean all this up later!

54
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,596
Bring the ammo!

55
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,191
I love the smell of bananas in the morning.

56
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,402
Banana in the hole!

57
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,697
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!

58
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:59,037
I feel the diplomatic process
is beginning to break down.

59
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,374
There you are! I got you!

60
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:09,339
Hi, kids!

61
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:19,474
Wow.

62
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:24,646
There.

63
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,190
Now you're safe.

64
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,736
I know I heard you say something.
I just know it.

65
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,115
Where are you?

66
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,082
Horton!

67
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:45,416
Sorry!

68
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:51,464
I just... There was this speck,
and it called out for help.

69
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,175
- And I was...
- The speck called out for help?

70
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,637
Well, not the speck.
I mean, that's ridiculous.

71
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:02,767
Is that what you thought I meant?
No, the speck can't call out for help.

72
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:05,061
Come on, get real.

73
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:10,400
No, there's a tiny person on that speck
that needs my help.

74
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,571
Absurd. There aren't people that small!

75
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:17,157
Well, maybe they aren't small.

76
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:19,909
- Maybe we're big.
- Horton.

77
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:24,456
No, really, think about it.
What if there was someone way out there

78
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,417
looking down on our world right now?

79
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,794
And to them, we're the specks.

80
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,796
And then, maybe someone else
will come along and say,

81
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,299
'Oh, there can't be people that small',
and the first guy would say,

82
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:35,467
'Are you calling me a liar?'

83
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:38,261
And the second guy would say,
'If the shoe fits, wear it!'

84
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:40,805
And now the fists are flying,
and the first guy picks up a brick,

85
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,600
and you might want to zip up the pouch
for this next part.

86
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,518
'All right, fat boy,
you want some of this... '

87
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:46,811
- Horton!
- What?

88
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:49,272
There is nothing on that speck.

89
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:52,609
- But I heard.
- Did you?

90
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:55,028
Really? Oh, my.

91
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,114
Then how come I don't hear anything?

92
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,366
Well...

93
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:05,747
If you can't see, hear or feel something,

94
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,540
it doesn't exist.

95
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:10,710
And believing in tiny, imaginary people

96
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:15,006
is just not something we do or tolerate,

97
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:17,091
here in the jungle of Nool.

98
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:21,638
Really? Because I bet if I really tried,
I could find somebody who'd believe

99
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:23,431
- what I've been saying.
- You will do nothing of the sort.

100
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:28,603
You will not breathe a word of this lie
to anyone else, especially the children.

101
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,524
I do not want you poisoning their minds
with this nonsense.

102
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:36,027
Our community has standards, Horton.

103
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:40,240
If you want to remain a part of it,
I recommend you follow them.

104
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:43,493
Have a nice day.

105
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:50,542
All right, then,
I'll take that under advisement.

106
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,168
Certainly appreciate your input.

107
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:58,299
I don't understand. I know I heard you.

108
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,344
It was as plain as the nose on my face.

109
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:04,764
That's it. Maybe you can't hear me.

110
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:09,894
Of course! Your ears must be tiny.
I need to speak up.

111
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:15,608
Hello!

112
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,361
Now some people out there,
I think I know who,

113
00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:21,489
may find they agree
with that sour Kangaroo.

114
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:25,452
"There can't really be people
as small as a mite. "

115
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:30,331
Well, there can, and there are,
because Horton was right.

116
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,719
Hello!

117
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,349
That single "hello" traveled
all the way down

118
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:52,645
to the speck, through the clouds,
until it found a small town.

119
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:56,483
A town known as Whoville,
for there lived the Whos,

120
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:59,903
feeling happy and safe,
knowing only good news,

121
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:03,531
unaware that their world
was a speck on a clover,

122
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,659
unaware that the sweet life
they knew might be over.

123
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,244
- Over!
- Under!

124
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,083
The Mayor of Whoville,
a man named McDodd,

125
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,796
was devoted and fair and a little bit odd.

126
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:38,399
The Mayor and his wife,
they had children to spare,

127
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,903
96 daughters, some here and some there.

128
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,658
96 girls to love, 96 girls to teach,

129
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:51,037
but the Mayor had only
a few seconds for each.

130
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,958
Daddy, I got better than best
on my Who-story test.

131
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,168
Who-story. I remember it well.

132
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:58,795
That's one of my girls.

133
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,090
- Hildy's been using my hairbrush!
- Holly's been using my hairbrush!

134
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,842
Look! Over there!

135
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:06,469
There. All better.

136
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:10,306
Can I please have a Who-phone, Dad?
Everyone else in my class has one.

137
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:12,267
Oh, really? Everyone?

138
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,938
I will think about it.

139
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,149
Daddy, look! Daddy, look!

140
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,071
Toof.

141
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:27,031
It's a 'T-H', sweetheart. It's 'tooth. '

142
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:30,160
In Whoville tradition, unlike yours or mine,

143
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:32,954
the Mayor's oldest is next
in the Mayoral line.

144
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,457
And who was the oldest?
To lead and stand tall?

145
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,710
It was JoJo, his son,
the smallest Who of all.

146
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:43,923
So, JoJo, what's shaking?
What's happening? What's the word?

147
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:47,469
Now, to you or to me,
it's abundantly clear

148
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:50,638
that JoJo did not want his father's career.

149
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:54,309
But the Mayor pressed forward,
completely deluded,

150
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:59,063
While JoJo just sat there in silence
and brooded.

151
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:04,360
Oh, JoJo!

152
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,781
- Hey, why does he get more time?
- That's not fair.

153
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:10,283
Son! Hey!

154
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:11,868
And why didn't he speak?

155
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:16,706
Well, I think that the lad was afraid
if he did, he might let down his dad.

156
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:19,000
You know what's awesome?

157
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,960
This is awesome.

158
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:25,590
Just look at the men and women
hanging on these walls.

159
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:31,596
You, my boy, are part of a family legacy
that spans centuries.

160
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:36,851
You know what?
Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville,

161
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:42,524
and your great-grandmother, that's right,

162
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:45,568
all the way down to your

163
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:51,282
great-great-great-great-not-so-great-

164
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:55,703
great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-

165
00:14:57,872 --> 00:14:59,290
grandfather.

166
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,920
Someday I hope to join them.

167
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,631
Be one of the greats.

168
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:11,177
I tell you, JoJo, there is nothing
like being Mayor.

169
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:15,140
I get to sign resolutions,
approve ordinances, submit budgets,

170
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:19,978
and in the Edible Parade, I'm the one
sitting on top of the giant meatball.

171
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,483
Someday, that can be you, too, JoJo.

172
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:30,697
Someday you'll be the one wearing
the Mayoral Crest.

173
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:34,617
You just... You just need to...

174
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,955
You know what I mean?

175
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:41,916
Okay. Good chat.

176
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,296
I'm glad that we had this talk

177
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,509
that I'm continuing now by myself. Good.

178
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,144
There. That ought to be comfy.

179
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:09,486
Nothing wrong with this, Morton.
Nothing wrong with this.

180
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,449
Just you, me and the speck,
shooting the breeze.

181
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:19,162
We're a club. We're a group.
We can take a vote on the issues.

182
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:23,291
We can be a secret society that controls
the balance of power in the world.

183
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,834
- Horton.
- And no one else can join,

184
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,170
unless they wear funny hats.

185
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:31,132
Listen, Horton!

186
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,760
The Chair recognizes Brother Morton.

187
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:37,388
I am really happy you found
this speck and all,

188
00:16:38,723 --> 00:16:42,435
but you might want to think
about keeping it to yourself.

189
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:44,395
What? Why?

190
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,067
Well, you're talking to a clover.
That doesn't look good.

191
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,613
You know what doesn't look good?

192
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:56,908
You talking about the speck
like the speck isn't even there.

193
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,953
The speck never said anything bad
about you.

194
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,123
But, hey! Good luck
with your illusion of superiority.

195
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:07,377
You know, the speck can think anything
it wants about me. It's a speck.

196
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:11,005
I see what's going on here.

197
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,718
Morton, no matter how tight
the speck and I get,

198
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,680
the speck could never replace you.

199
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:22,267
I'm only sad that I would have
to explain that, at this point.

200
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:26,104
Well, that's awesome, Horton.
That really helps.

201
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:29,566
Just try to keep this to yourself.

202
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,068
I'll see you later. Try.

203
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:39,617
Hey, Horton! What you got there?

204
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,244
What? Nothing!

205
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:43,788
We're not doing anything.

206
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,167
- We're totally alone.
- Who's 'we'?

207
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,627
'We'? What? 'We'? Did I say that?
I just... Oh.

208
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,421
No, I would never say that,
because that would imply that

209
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:54,048
I was with someone, and not alone.

210
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:03,099
Okay, seriously, you can't tell anybody.
I mean it.

211
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:07,103
If anybody finds out about this,
it could be very, very bad.

212
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,731
I'm not sure why.

213
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,858
We won't tell anyone.

214
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:15,653
And if we do,
we'll tell them not to tell anyone.

215
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,530
Perfect!

216
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,324
Okay, I'm taking a bath, right,

217
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,493
'cause my skin gets kind of dry
and a little bit ashy.

218
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:24,329
While Horton came clean
about the speck that he'd found

219
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:26,623
and how he had saved it
when it nearly drowned,

220
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:28,500
the Mayor set off on his morning commute

221
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,836
and noticed things weren't quite
the same on his route.

222
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:36,341
But please don't blame Horton, for he
didn't know that a small bump above...

223
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,426
...and I dove in the water like this!

224
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,180
...was a big bump below.

225
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,892
Hey, Joe, don't work too hard.

226
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:49,229
These luxury condos,
they don't build themselves.

227
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:56,361
Hey, look at that!
I guess they do build themselves.

228
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:58,863
Okay, that happened.

229
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,870
Now, the Mayor knew
it was his job to convey the unusual things

230
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:09,499
that he'd noticed that day,
but there was one problem.

231
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:11,417
Though his will was strong...

232
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:13,419
- You're late.
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.

233
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:17,048
...nothing in Whoville
had ever gone wrong.

234
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:20,468
We have all that we need.
We need all that we've got.

235
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:24,722
We like it in Whoville. We like it a lot!

236
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:28,685
We're all very busy with
the Who-Centennial coming up,

237
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,479
so let's bring this meeting to order.

238
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,608
Mr. Mayor, I presume you
have some good news for us.

239
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:38,695
Well, it's news.

240
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,324
I don't know if we need to go labeling it
'good' or 'bad' or anything like that.

241
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,621
The thing is, I have noticed
some odd goings-on in Whoville lately.

242
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:50,498
Good 'odd goings-on'?

243
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:54,502
Well, you know, tremors,
clouds swirling in the sky.

244
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,379
And it seems to me, just to be safe,

245
00:19:56,504 --> 00:19:59,382
we might want to consider
postponing the Who-Centennial.

246
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:01,009
Consider what?

247
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:02,886
Postponing the Who-Centennial.

248
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:06,222
What? Speak up, man!

249
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:10,435
Postponing the Who-Centennial! All right?

250
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:36,085
We are about to celebrate 100 years
of Whoville happiness and harmony,

251
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,379
and you want to postpone the celebration?

252
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,048
Well, what if Whoville's not safe?

253
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,134
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville,

254
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:47,722
never has and never will,
you blathering boob!

255
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,314
The Who-Centennial will proceed
as planned!

256
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:59,651
The Mayor was merely being an idiot.

257
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:02,821
It will be all smiles from now on.

258
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:07,617
That hurt!

259
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:12,080
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.

260
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,040
What? What do you mean,
it don't look like me?

261
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:18,753
That looks just like me 10 years ago.
Wait a minute. Hold on for a second.

262
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:26,094
Treats me like an idiot. I am not an idiot.

263
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,515
Do I look like an idiot?

264
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:35,061
- You don't want me to answer that.
- I am not an idiot.

265
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:39,315
Has the nerve to call me a boob?
I would never call somebody a boob.

266
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:41,484
He's a boob! Look at you.

267
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,236
Yuck!

268
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:45,363
Look at your face.

269
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:49,701
And I bet you don't look so good
with a stapler in your head!

270
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,588
Whoa! Whoa.

271
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,052
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.
- You're welcome.

272
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,722
Hello?

273
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:14,601
Who said that? Back off! I'll punch you!

274
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:25,445
Hello?

275
00:22:28,698 --> 00:22:29,824
Hello.

276
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,541
Who's there?

277
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,168
This is the Mayor.

278
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,004
The Mayor? The Mayor!

279
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:45,924
I'm talking to the Mayor!

280
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:51,221
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
I knew there was life on this speck.

281
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:53,556
'This speck'? What speck?

282
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:58,394
Well, I don't exactly know
how to tell you this, but...

283
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,940
You're living on a speck.

284
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:06,653
Well, I hate to disagree with you,
O voice from the drainpipe,

285
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:08,738
but I live in Whoville.

286
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,324
Well, then, Whoville's a speck.

287
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:12,450
Right.

288
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:15,370
Okay, seriously, who is this?

289
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,288
Is this Burt from accounting?

290
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:21,334
No. This is Horton. I'm an elephant.

291
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:24,754
Okay, 'Horton. '

292
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:27,132
Fake name. Where are you?

293
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:32,554
Well, from where you're standing,
I guess I'm in the sky.

294
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,722
Compared to you, I'm enormous.

295
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:37,392
Which is saying something,
because I've slimmed down quite a bit.

296
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:38,726
I swim.

297
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,481
Your whole world fits on a flower
in my world.

298
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:46,526
Oh, man, this is even pushing it
for you, Burt.

299
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:49,737
Don't believe me? Watch what happens
when I put you in the shade.

300
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,073
This is absolutely impossible...

301
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,324
Dark.

302
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:55,410
Light.

303
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:57,078
Dark.

304
00:23:57,662 --> 00:24:01,082
Light. Dark, light, dark, light,
dark, light, dark.

305
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,460
Light!

306
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:05,378
Don't you see?

307
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:10,216
We're in the middle of some kind of
amazing cosmic convergence.

308
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:15,096
Two vastly different worlds,
miraculously crossing paths!

309
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,891
Mine, colossal! Yours, miniscule.

310
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:20,769
Yet somehow we've managed
to make contact.

311
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:23,980
If you think about it, it's pretty amazing.

312
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:28,943
Is everything okay down there?

313
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:35,492
I don't know. You tell me.
You're the one holding the speck.

314
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:37,994
I'm the one holding the speck.

315
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:40,747
I'm the one holding the speck.

316
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:43,500
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.

317
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:46,169
Hold, please!

318
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:52,092
What did all of this mean?
The Mayor hadn't a clue.

319
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:57,555
So he ran to the office of Dr. Larue,
the brainiest brain on the staff at Who U.

320
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,973
Dr. Larue!

321
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,602
This is crazy.

322
00:25:02,727 --> 00:25:04,229
Mr. Mayor.

323
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:07,148
How may I be of assistance?

324
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,734
I don't know. Hey, you know,
I was just wondering

325
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:14,572
if our world were, say, a tiny speck
floating through space,

326
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:15,698
how would we know?

327
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:17,534
Well, why would you ask
something like that?

328
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:20,829
No reason. No reason at all.
I don't even remember.

329
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,997
Yes, I do. You know what?

330
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:25,041
Some guy was talking to me.

331
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,919
Not an elephant in the sky.
A guy on the ground.

332
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:30,380
There would be several ramifications.

333
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:32,298
Good ramifications?

334
00:25:33,174 --> 00:25:34,717
A tiny speck?

335
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:37,345
Yeah. Tiny speck.

336
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,139
Floating around.

337
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:45,562
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors,
dramatic changes in the weather,

338
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:50,066
and if we didn't eventually achieve
some sort of stability,

339
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:53,653
our world would be destroyed!

340
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:57,532
Destroyed? Destroyed. Oh, destroyed.

341
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:04,539
Horton!

342
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,167
No, this is Benny.

343
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,378
Horton is busy right now.

344
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:12,380
No. I'm joking.

345
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,965
That's me.

346
00:26:14,716 --> 00:26:16,134
We're doomed.

347
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:20,346
Listen, Horton, turns out
I need your help a little bit.

348
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:22,724
Apparently, if that speck
keeps moving around,

349
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,518
our whole world could be obliterated.

350
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,232
So I need you to find us Whos
a safer, more stable home,

351
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,400
and fast.

352
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:35,612
No problem, Mr. Mayor. Let's see...

353
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,658
Wow, that's a nice view.

354
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:45,288
Hello. Is everything okay?

355
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:56,216
What's going on up there?

356
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:14,150
This entire jungle is a house of death!

357
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,403
Oh, wait. There's a good spot.

358
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:20,990
And it's then Horton saw
at the top of Mount Nool,

359
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:24,327
a small cave that looked peaceful
and quiet and cool,

360
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:27,497
where a sunflower grew proud and tall
from the ground.

361
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:31,751
There, he knew every Who would be safe,
would be sound.

362
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:35,213
I found it, Mayor. The perfect place.

363
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:37,424
Right up there,

364
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:40,802
- on the top of Mount Nool.
- Mr. Mayor?

365
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:42,804
I wish you could...

366
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:44,764
Shiny.

367
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,768
The Who-Centennial Committee
is waiting for you

368
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:52,021
to look over the giant meatball
for the Edible Parade.

369
00:27:52,147 --> 00:27:54,941
And then you're due at the dentist
for your Who-root canal.

370
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:59,237
You know, sticking 'Who' in front
of everything doesn't make it hurt less.

371
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:01,239
Just wastes time!

372
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:03,158
I don't want to go.

373
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,286
Listen, Horton, I've gotta go.

374
00:28:06,411 --> 00:28:08,580
Apparently, there's a problem
with the giant meatball.

375
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:14,461
You just take care of that meatball, sir,
and leave the freaking out to me.

376
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:17,464
So then Horton began
his long, perilous trek,

377
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:20,842
determined to save the small world
on the speck.

378
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,345
Horton was faithful and stalwart and kind.

379
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:25,889
I got you.

380
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:27,891
He was a brave hero...

381
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,017
I'll protect you!

382
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:30,477
...at least in his mind.

383
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:33,188
We must become invisible. Travel silently.

384
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:36,107
For there are forces
that would seek to destroy us.

385
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:45,533
So you think you can sneak up
on me, huh?

386
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:50,663
It is clear that you are no match
for my technique.

387
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:57,504
I see you have mastered the way of the
snapping branch. Watch me tumble!

388
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:00,507
Morton Mouse, go!

389
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:03,551
You are fast, Horton,
but the Kangaroo has monkeys.

390
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:07,430
 I will make monkeys
of these monkeys. It is their destiny.

391
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,140
More clover!

392
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:13,853
Horton is the greatest hero of them all!

393
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:15,021
- Horton!
- Morton!

394
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:16,147
Go!

395
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:20,777
But Mount Nool is that way.

396
00:29:21,903 --> 00:29:25,198
To the top of Mount Nool!
As fast as lightning! Away, I go.

397
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,327
Sorry, little fellow.

398
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:32,997
You'll be fine. Just think healing thoughts.

399
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:39,629
- Horton! Look!
- Horton! Look, look, look!

400
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:43,716
We've all got our own clovers
with worlds on them!

401
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:45,009
Yeah.

402
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:49,764
In my world, everyone's a pony,

403
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:53,101
and they all eat rainbows
and poop butterflies.

404
00:29:54,978 --> 00:29:57,147
That's beautiful, Katie.

405
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:03,403
In a really weird way.

406
00:30:03,528 --> 00:30:06,364
My world is called Jessica-land,
and everyone worships Queen Jessica

407
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:08,199
because Jessica is so beautiful.

408
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:11,119
Jessica, that was awesome.

409
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,333
- Rudy!
- Mom, be careful!

410
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:18,793
My best friend Thidwick lives on that.

411
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:22,922
Rudy, no one lives on this.
It's not possible.

412
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:25,008
That Horton is a menace.

413
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,302
Mom, Mom! Please, you're so weird.
Don't do this to me.

414
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:28,928
Honey, go to your room.

415
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:30,305
Horton!

416
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:35,143
It's good!

417
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,061
What do you think you're doing?

418
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:38,688
You guys with worlds are in trouble!

419
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:42,984
- Have you forgotten what we discussed?
- Oh, no. I'm an elephant,

420
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,403
and elephants never forget.
It's a curse, really.

421
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:47,363
I remember I was on my head,
and you said 'Humpf,'

422
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:49,073
and I looked up, and you said,
'What are you doing?'

423
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,408
And I said the thing about the speck.

424
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:52,577
Then you pulled my ears
and you poked me in the forehead...

425
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:54,662
- Horton!
- Well, you did.

426
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:57,832
Give me that clover, Horton. Now!

427
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:00,418
No.

428
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,048
No?

429
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:07,550
Yeah.

430
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:10,845
Are you sure you want to fight
this fight, Horton?

431
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:15,600
Because I promise you
it will get very ugly, very fast.

432
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:18,103
And you need to ask yourself,

433
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:21,606
'Do I really want
to put myself through all this?

434
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:23,733
'For a clover?'

435
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:25,693
Take it from me, Horton.

436
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,195
You don't.

437
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:29,280
So hand it over!

438
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:34,619
No! I can't give it to you.

439
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,247
There are people on this speck.

440
00:31:37,372 --> 00:31:39,082
Granted, they're very small people,

441
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:42,043
but a person's a person,
no matter how small.

442
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:51,469
You just crossed the line, Horton,
and I'm gonna make you pay.

443
00:31:57,976 --> 00:31:59,602
That Horton is a menace.

444
00:31:59,727 --> 00:32:02,105
He has those kids using
their imaginations.

445
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,273
It's sick.

446
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:08,153
All right, I gotta get this speck
up to the top of Mount Nool, ASAP,

447
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,949
whatever that means. Probably,
'Act Swiftly, Awesome Pachyderm. '

448
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:15,285
I mean, how hard can that be?

449
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:24,711
It's just a straight plummet
to certain death.

450
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:29,632
This looks kind of precarious.

451
00:32:30,675 --> 00:32:32,844
Well, no need to worry.

452
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:35,096
Obviously, when they build a bridge
like this,

453
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:39,058
they take into account
that elephants will be crossing here.

454
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:44,856
All right. Feels good.
I'll just get the feel of it!

455
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:05,960
That's true.

456
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,677
Oh, God.

457
00:33:14,803 --> 00:33:17,764
Hello. And how are we today, Mr. Mayor?

458
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:21,309
Say, 'Ah. '

459
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:23,978
Ah!

460
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:34,239
Rinse, please.

461
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:41,830
I think a few of these boards could
stand to be replaced.

462
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:55,510
I just need to think light.
I'm light as a feather.

463
00:33:56,177 --> 00:33:58,471
I'm light as a feather!

464
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:07,063
Heavy feather.

465
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:11,401
Okay, this will just pinch a little.

466
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:16,573
I'm lighter than a feather.
What's lighter than a feather?

467
00:34:18,283 --> 00:34:23,037
Air! There's nothing lighter.
So it stands to reason

468
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:27,000
that the more air I have,

469
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,046
the lighter I'll be.

470
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,382
Next, please.

471
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:19,427
All right, that was absolutely terrifying.

472
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:21,596
If I just pull myself up!

473
00:35:23,765 --> 00:35:26,017
Try not to panic.

474
00:35:45,995 --> 00:35:48,414
That could've been a disaster.

475
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:56,548
Wow. I feel really good right now.
Maybe it's my new sense of purpose.

476
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:22,449
All right.

477
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:27,245
Hey, JoJo! I need your help.
Can you help me?

478
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,291
Okay, great. Okay.
First, I need you to go to the girls' room.

479
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:33,752
Take down Hanna's china doll collection
and then...

480
00:36:33,877 --> 00:36:34,961
Stop looking at my arm.

481
00:36:35,086 --> 00:36:36,588
Put away Holly's light bulb collection,
and then...

482
00:36:36,713 --> 00:36:40,967
You know what? Just take care of
anything that might break or shatter.

483
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,970
Okay, take a good long look.

484
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:46,389
Got it? Thanks, JoJo!

485
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:59,110
Here. And... Take that. And...

486
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:08,286
Hi. You're home late.

487
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:14,042
Sorry, hon. I was just having some
dental work done on my arm.

488
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:15,210
So, what was...

489
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:16,461
Ned!

490
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:20,006
What are you doing?

491
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,591
What do you mean?

492
00:37:21,716 --> 00:37:24,844
Well, I'm no detective, Ned,
but you are hanging from the chandelier.

493
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:26,012
I just thought it might look better

494
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:29,474
somewhere it can't fall on us
and crush us in our sleep.

495
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:33,895
What is going on?

496
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:38,817
Hey, hon,

497
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:45,156
Did you ever get the feeling
that you were being watched?

498
00:37:46,616 --> 00:37:50,078
Yeah, sure. I suppose.

499
00:37:50,203 --> 00:37:54,374
And then you get the feeling that
maybe that thing watching you is

500
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,585
a giant elephant?

501
00:37:58,503 --> 00:38:01,423
And you know how
you get that weird feeling

502
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:04,509
that your world is actually a tiny speck?

503
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:10,849
And that the elephant that I talked about
earlier is carrying it around on a flower.

504
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:15,186
And you realize that if you tell anybody,
they'd think you were crazy.

505
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:19,941
But you still feel a responsibility
to keep everyone safe.

506
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:22,444
You know that feeling?

507
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:26,281
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.

508
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:28,491
Do you know that feeling?

509
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:32,829
No.

510
00:38:34,456 --> 00:38:38,877
Yawn. Wow. I am beat.
Time to hit the hay, I guess.

511
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,505
Sweetheart, I know
you're under a lot of stress,

512
00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:47,469
and if you're seeing elephants
and flowers, then fine.

513
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:50,638
Just don't tell anyone else
that story, okay?

514
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:53,725
And remember,
it's not the end of the world.

515
00:38:56,102 --> 00:38:57,896
'The end of the world. '

516
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:02,150
Horton to Mayor. Horton to Mayor.
Come in, Mayor. Over.

517
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:05,737
Horton?

518
00:39:07,363 --> 00:39:09,115
I get terrible reception here.

519
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:13,119
How about this?
If I get up real close, can you read me?

520
00:39:16,372 --> 00:39:18,416
Yep! Roger that.

521
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,668
Are we at that safe place yet?

522
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,422
Almost. I'm pretty sure
the worst part's over.

523
00:39:24,547 --> 00:39:26,299
This is your elephant speaking.

524
00:39:26,424 --> 00:39:29,928
Just sit back, enjoy the ride, and
we'll have you to Mount Nool in no time.

525
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:31,971
No, you can't have ice cream for breakfast.

526
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:33,098
Please.

527
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:34,390
Who's that?

528
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:35,975
Is there someone else there?

529
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:38,269
Well, that's my wife and kids.

530
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:39,896
You have a family.

531
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:46,277
I do, indeed. A beautiful wife,
96 daughters, and one son.

532
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:48,071
Oh, busy guy.

533
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:51,032
And we all share one bathroom.
You know how that is.

534
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,576
Yeah. Don't I know it.

535
00:39:54,577 --> 00:39:55,870
Bathroom?

536
00:39:56,246 --> 00:39:57,455
-  Ned!
- What?

537
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,167
Sweetheart, you know
you're on the roof, right?

538
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:02,335
- Please, Mom.
- What's that?

539
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,796
No, you need to go to bed.
Daddy's having a breakdown.

540
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:07,048
Ned, what are you up to now?

541
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:10,468
I was just about to put the kids to bed
when I got off the roof.

542
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:13,388
And that's what happened. Right.

543
00:40:29,904 --> 00:40:31,781
- Daddy?
- Yes.

544
00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:34,576
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Of course.

545
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:36,244
- Me, too.
- Me, three.

546
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:40,081
Me, 28.

547
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:41,332
Okay.

548
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,173
Hey, JoJo!

549
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:53,511
A lot of liquid. A lot of liquid.
Just the person I wanted to see.

550
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:58,475
Yeah, I realize that we have not
been seeing eye-to-eye lately,

551
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,518
and most of it is my fault.

552
00:41:00,643 --> 00:41:01,644
It's true.

553
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,521
You know what I've been trying to do?

554
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:07,650
I have been trying to impose
my vision of your future on you.

555
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:10,653
Let me make this perfectly clear.

556
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:15,283
JoJo, you can be whatever
kind of Mayor you want to be.

557
00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:19,078
Hands-on, strong and silent,
outspoken, it's up to you.

558
00:41:19,204 --> 00:41:22,290
Well, good. I feel so much better.

559
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:26,377
I am expecting big things from you,
young man. Big things.

560
00:41:26,503 --> 00:41:28,296
All right. Good night.

561
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:29,798
Good stuff. Good talk.

562
00:41:44,938 --> 00:41:48,274
Then JoJo snuck out,
feeling lonely and sad,

563
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:51,236
and tragically misunderstood by his dad.

564
00:42:07,544 --> 00:42:10,463
And where was he going
at such a late hour?

565
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:16,136
Up to Whoville's abandoned
Star-Studying Tower,

566
00:42:17,595 --> 00:42:20,807
a place where the boy felt contented, free.

567
00:42:20,932 --> 00:42:23,852
A place he could be what he wanted to be.

568
00:42:25,895 --> 00:42:29,107
And what was inside there,
I'd say if I could.

569
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:32,610
But up above, the Kangaroo
was up to no good.

570
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:41,995
Can I come out now, Mom?

571
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,122
No, Rudy. Stay in your room.

572
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:46,374
- But, Mom...
- Stay inside.

573
00:42:58,094 --> 00:42:59,929
Mr. Vladikoff?

574
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:14,235
Eating. Go.

575
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,531
Yes, I realize you're busy,
but I need your help.

576
00:43:19,073 --> 00:43:20,366
It's Horton.

577
00:43:20,492 --> 00:43:23,203
He's become obsessed with a clover.

578
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:26,831
And he actually thinks
there are little people on it.

579
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:31,377
I want that clover destroyed.

580
00:43:31,503 --> 00:43:34,631
Sure. What a big deal this is for you, bro.

581
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:41,054
I'd do it myself, but being a lady,
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

582
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:44,599
But I hear you have no problem with that.

583
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:47,102
No.

584
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:50,396
No problem. Easy peazy.

585
00:43:50,939 --> 00:43:54,442
But I will only do this for a price.

586
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:57,320
In exchange for a brand new pair of...

587
00:43:58,029 --> 00:43:59,197
No.

588
00:43:59,948 --> 00:44:02,909
This little kangaroo.

589
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:06,746
- Mom!
- Quiet, Rudy. Mommy's thinking it over.

590
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:11,584
Well, thanks, but on second thought,

591
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:15,130
I think I'm going to have
the Wickersham brothers

592
00:44:15,255 --> 00:44:16,464
take care of this for me.

593
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:19,467
Yeah, of course, Wickersham.
I mean, they're a classy operation.

594
00:44:19,592 --> 00:44:22,554
You know, they do... Wait! No!
You can't go with Wickersham!

595
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:26,850
No, no, no, the Wickershams would
be perfect for this job.

596
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:30,478
But they're monkeys! Is not scary!

597
00:44:30,603 --> 00:44:34,357
Thanks, anyway. Maybe next time.

598
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:35,567
Wait!

599
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:39,112
Here is what I will do to precious clover.

600
00:44:39,237 --> 00:44:42,532
I will take it, I will crush it,

601
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:45,410
and I will devour it.

602
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:54,043
Bigger than it look.

603
00:44:54,169 --> 00:44:55,545
One second.

604
00:44:57,547 --> 00:44:58,840
Holy moly.

605
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:01,384
Hang on.

606
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:06,431
Then I regurgitate it.

607
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:10,268
Then I'm going to devour it second time!

608
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,520
So, two times devoured.

609
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:17,400
Sounds nice, but I think
I'll talk to the Wickershams.

610
00:45:17,734 --> 00:45:18,860
Wait!

611
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:21,780
Here is best part.

612
00:45:21,905 --> 00:45:26,159
I do all gratis.

613
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,828
That's free, bro.

614
00:45:29,746 --> 00:45:31,414
What do you think?

615
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:35,293
Deal.

616
00:45:35,418 --> 00:45:39,297
Yes! Score. Thanking you.
You won't regret.

617
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:16,459
Mayor!

618
00:46:16,918 --> 00:46:18,169
Mayor!

619
00:46:18,294 --> 00:46:21,631
Open up, Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

620
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:25,802
It's snowing! In the summer!

621
00:46:30,932 --> 00:46:33,101
Yes. Yes, it is.

622
00:46:33,226 --> 00:46:35,353
It's a dramatic change in the weather,

623
00:46:35,478 --> 00:46:38,022
as if we were a speck,
floating through space.

624
00:46:38,148 --> 00:46:41,818
I don't know how you knew,
but somehow you did,

625
00:46:41,943 --> 00:46:46,948
and Whoville is headed for disaster.

626
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,159
Horton.

627
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:50,326
What?

628
00:46:50,452 --> 00:46:52,287
Nothing. I'm on it.

629
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:55,457
It's up to us to save
the people of Whoville.

630
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:02,297
You're small, but there are a lot of you!

631
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:04,507
That's it.

632
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:07,969
Okay, anybody else?

633
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:09,888
Good.

634
00:47:11,473 --> 00:47:15,477
No, no. No enjoyment. This is not fun.
It is a sign of doom!

635
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:19,022
Aw, sweetie, that's...

636
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:21,691
No, no, no! Danger! Danger!

637
00:47:24,152 --> 00:47:26,738
Stop having fun immediately!

638
00:47:26,863 --> 00:47:29,199
This is dangerous! Okay!

639
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:33,077
Stop it!

640
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:41,920
Horton!

641
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,596
Hey, Mayor.

642
00:47:52,514 --> 00:47:53,807
We're in big trouble down here.

643
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:56,684
It's happening!
It's snowing in the middle of summer.

644
00:47:56,851 --> 00:47:58,353
It's the end of the world!

645
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:05,276
Hold on, Mayor.
I think I know what your problem is.

646
00:48:16,246 --> 00:48:17,997
There. That better?

647
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,377
That seems to have worked.

648
00:48:24,003 --> 00:48:25,004
Do I smell peanuts?

649
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,008
Yeah, they're my favorite snack,
but they tend to linger.

650
00:48:34,806 --> 00:48:35,849
Finwick, no!

651
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:40,520
Hang on, Mr. Mayor.
I may have to put up a fight.

652
00:48:40,645 --> 00:48:42,897
A frightened elephant can be
very dangerous!

653
00:48:43,022 --> 00:48:46,818
All right!
You've called down the thunder, buddy!

654
00:48:46,943 --> 00:48:51,489
You hungry for trouble? I'm an
'All you can eat' salad bar! Take a bite!

655
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:56,077
I hate running.

656
00:48:56,202 --> 00:48:57,537
Morton!

657
00:48:57,662 --> 00:48:59,914
Don't do that.

658
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:01,249
Horton!

659
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:04,836
Horton! There you are!

660
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:07,464
We got trouble! Wait, stay, wait!
Did you hear that?

661
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:12,761
No, I'm here, okay. Listen. No! Go!
Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.

662
00:49:12,886 --> 00:49:15,680
She's telling everyone that
you should be kicked out of Nool.

663
00:49:15,805 --> 00:49:18,516
She said that?
I thought we were her friends.

664
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:20,727
Word is she's gone to Vlad!

665
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:24,147
Vlad? Vlad? I know two Vlads.

666
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:28,234
Is it the bad Vlad
or the bunny Vlad that makes the cookies?

667
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:31,863
Yeah, Horton, she's sending you
a bunny with cookies.

668
00:49:31,988 --> 00:49:34,866
I think we can assume it's the bad Vlad.

669
00:49:35,158 --> 00:49:36,409
Yeah, that's a good call.

670
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:41,581
So unless you're cool
with giant, razor-sharp claws

671
00:49:41,706 --> 00:49:45,376
ripping the flesh off your body,
I'd get rid of the clover!

672
00:49:45,502 --> 00:49:48,463
I can't! I promised the Mayor.

673
00:49:49,047 --> 00:49:51,466
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant,

674
00:49:51,591 --> 00:49:54,135
and an elephant's faithful, 100%.

675
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,432
Please. For me, just this once.
Be faithful 99% of the time.

676
00:49:59,557 --> 00:50:03,937
I've never gotten 99% on anything,
and I think I'm awesome! So, come on!

677
00:50:04,062 --> 00:50:07,774
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant.

678
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:10,485
I'm not gonna say it.

679
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:13,571
You can do that all day,
it's not happening.

680
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,573
An elephant's faithful, 100%.

681
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:20,328
That's right. That's my code, my motto.
But thanks for the warning.

682
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:22,705
Motto. Okay.

683
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:24,666
But watch the skies.

684
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:27,961
Keep watching the skies!

685
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,759
Mayor, you need to get
everyone underground.

686
00:50:34,884 --> 00:50:35,885
Now!

687
00:50:36,803 --> 00:50:38,513
I don't want to sound the alarm,

688
00:50:38,638 --> 00:50:40,640
but there's a good possibility
we may be attacked

689
00:50:40,765 --> 00:50:43,685
- by a giant carnivorous bird.
- What?

690
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:47,105
There's a small chance it could be a bunny
with cookies, but I wouldn't count on it.

691
00:50:49,315 --> 00:50:50,733
They are formidable.

692
00:50:50,859 --> 00:50:52,819
Mayor? Are you there?

693
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:56,281
Yeah. No. That's a great idea. It's just...

694
00:50:56,406 --> 00:51:00,577
In order to get everyone mobilized,
I'd need the okay of the City Council,

695
00:51:00,702 --> 00:51:03,246
and they never listen to me.

696
00:51:03,371 --> 00:51:05,373
I've been called a boob,

697
00:51:05,498 --> 00:51:07,333
several times. I can't do it!

698
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:10,295
You have to talk to them, Mayor!
Okay. Listen.

699
00:51:12,797 --> 00:51:14,257
 Bad Vlad!

700
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:15,633
Bad Vlad!

701
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:17,844
Bad Vlad!

702
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:27,437
That is definitely not a bunny.

703
00:51:35,278 --> 00:51:39,491
Lost him. Meant to lose him,
and I lost him. Good.

704
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,539
Is this tree for real? Come on!

705
00:51:46,664 --> 00:51:49,626
Hang on, Whoville!
This is gonna get rough!

706
00:52:00,678 --> 00:52:02,889
Now you're going to get it!

707
00:52:04,015 --> 00:52:05,975
Get ready for the best!

708
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:10,271
Leave me alone!

709
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:16,694
Horton!

710
00:52:28,498 --> 00:52:30,208
I just know he's gonna
jump out somewhere.

711
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:31,501
Hello.

712
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:53,398
Chess mate.

713
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,526
Now it's time for me to take clover

714
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:59,362
and crush all the little people on it,
who are saying...

715
00:52:59,529 --> 00:53:02,866
Sorry. This is where we get off.

716
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:08,079
Right in the beak!

717
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:13,168
Cool line. Usually I can't think
of those things till later.

718
00:53:13,918 --> 00:53:15,628
- Mayor?
- Horton.

719
00:53:16,087 --> 00:53:17,088
Are you okay?

720
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:26,431
Well, more or less. What happened?
The bird?

721
00:53:26,931 --> 00:53:30,727
Yeah, it attacked me.
Mayor, your people are in danger.

722
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:34,189
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

723
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:37,567
I'm going to go out there
and tell them what is going on.

724
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:39,819
Perfect. Now, quick. Get going.

725
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:47,994
Hey! Mr. Mayor!
Something's wrong!

726
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:49,496
My basement's in the attic.

727
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:51,331
The Science Museum is history.

728
00:53:51,456 --> 00:53:52,874
The lost and found is missing.

729
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:55,251
What's going on, Mr. Mayor?

730
00:53:55,376 --> 00:53:57,670
I'm declaring a state of emergency!

731
00:53:57,796 --> 00:54:00,757
Don't worry! Don't worry!

732
00:54:00,882 --> 00:54:03,426
The Mayor is just being a moron.

733
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:06,888
No, wait! Whoville is in terrible danger!

734
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:10,892
Everyone needs to get down to the
underground storage area immediately.

735
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:12,894
Fine! Fine!

736
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:15,605
Let's do this democratically.

737
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:19,984
Who wants the joy and glory and festivity

738
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:23,780
of the Who-Centennial
to proceed as planned?

739
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:25,990
Yeah!

740
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:29,661
And who, like the Mayor,

741
00:54:29,786 --> 00:54:33,456
thinks it would be better
to spend the Who-Centennial

742
00:54:33,581 --> 00:54:36,918
in an underground storage area?

743
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:39,087
Yeah!

744
00:54:40,713 --> 00:54:42,632
Wait! You've gotta listen to me!

745
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:45,718
Our whole world could explode!

746
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:52,183
Much more quickly!

747
00:54:52,851 --> 00:54:55,562
And our world wouldn't make that noise.

748
00:54:57,021 --> 00:54:59,899
The people have spoken, Mr. Mayor.

749
00:55:00,692 --> 00:55:04,320
You're finished. No one believes you.

750
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:06,531
No one supports you.

751
00:55:08,366 --> 00:55:10,410
Horton believes me.

752
00:55:10,535 --> 00:55:11,745
Horton?

753
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,873
Who's Horton?

754
00:55:15,206 --> 00:55:20,879
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky!

755
00:55:21,796 --> 00:55:22,797
Don't bother looking, he's invisible.

756
00:55:22,922 --> 00:55:26,760
And he's the one risking his life
to get Whoville,

757
00:55:26,885 --> 00:55:31,556
which, by the way,
is a speck on a clover, to safety!

758
00:55:43,151 --> 00:55:44,569
I can prove it!

759
00:55:44,694 --> 00:55:47,655
Horton's voice comes out of this horn.

760
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:53,286
Horton!

761
00:55:54,537 --> 00:55:57,749
I have all the Whos
gathered in town square!

762
00:55:57,874 --> 00:55:59,751
Let them know you're there!

763
00:56:00,794 --> 00:56:04,339
Gee. This is kind of
a high-pressure situation, then.

764
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:10,136
Wow. I am really drawing a blank here.

765
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:11,513
I know!

766
00:56:15,725 --> 00:56:16,935
Horton!

767
00:56:17,644 --> 00:56:19,562
Horton, we're waiting!

768
00:56:20,313 --> 00:56:22,565
Time to show everyone that you exist,

769
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:26,945
and by extension, what a non-boob I am.

770
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:35,161
Wait!

771
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:40,166
Everyone, look at the wind.
What do you think that that means?

772
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:42,585
It means...

773
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,422
It means, obviously...

774
00:56:46,297 --> 00:56:49,426
Let the kite-flying race begin!

775
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:09,571
What a burn on you, Horton!

776
00:58:07,087 --> 00:58:08,505
Brain freeze.

777
00:58:15,595 --> 00:58:19,516
Give me back my speck!

778
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:21,392
Not this time, guy.

779
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:33,613
I am so sorry that I let you down,
but this... This is bigger than me.

780
00:58:33,738 --> 00:58:36,866
Get the family together
and get somewhere safe.

781
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:40,286
I will! I believe you.

782
00:58:46,334 --> 00:58:48,628
I've got you now, elephant.

783
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,006
No, no, no!

784
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,228
Oh, no!

785
00:59:33,089 --> 00:59:34,215
Mayor?

786
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:36,426
Anybody there?

787
00:59:37,677 --> 00:59:38,803
Hello?

788
00:59:39,971 --> 00:59:41,181
Anyone?

789
00:59:42,056 --> 00:59:45,101
But clover by clover by clover, he found

790
00:59:45,226 --> 00:59:48,605
that the one he sought for
was just not around.

791
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:50,815
Mayor?

792
00:59:52,984 --> 00:59:53,985
Hello?

793
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:57,655
And by noon, poor Horton,
more dead than alive,

794
00:59:57,781 --> 01:00:02,035
had picked, searched and piled up 9,005.

795
01:00:03,078 --> 01:00:04,370
Hello?

796
01:00:05,246 --> 01:00:07,040
Sorry to bother you,

797
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,583
nobody.

798
01:00:12,128 --> 01:00:13,588
Knock, knock.

799
01:00:15,048 --> 01:00:18,510
This is where you'd say,'Who's there?'

800
01:00:18,635 --> 01:00:21,805
If there were any Whos there.

801
01:00:23,473 --> 01:00:25,892
Get it? 'Whos there. '

802
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:33,483
All day he looked,
looked on and on,

803
01:00:34,776 --> 01:00:37,278
until his hope was almost gone.

804
01:00:37,779 --> 01:00:40,740
No, no, no! Please, no!

805
01:00:42,033 --> 01:00:43,660
This isn't fair!

806
01:00:48,164 --> 01:00:50,792
But, wait, could this one be the one?

807
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:53,628
Was all his searching finally done?

808
01:00:53,753 --> 01:00:56,464
Ah, yes, for this was the hour.

809
01:00:56,589 --> 01:00:59,801
Horton had found them
on the three millionth flower.

810
01:00:59,926 --> 01:01:02,303
Mayor! Mayor!

811
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:04,264
I found you!

812
01:01:07,142 --> 01:01:08,435
Mayor?

813
01:01:08,852 --> 01:01:10,311
Are you there?

814
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,729
Mayor?

815
01:01:16,693 --> 01:01:17,735
Mayor.

816
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:26,077
Mayor, are you there?

817
01:01:29,164 --> 01:01:30,540
Mayor!

818
01:01:36,504 --> 01:01:37,547
Mayor?

819
01:01:40,383 --> 01:01:41,509
Mayor?

820
01:01:43,887 --> 01:01:46,806
Mayor!

821
01:01:54,856 --> 01:01:56,983
No, this is Floyd.

822
01:01:58,359 --> 01:02:00,153
Can I take a message?

823
01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:07,160
Mayor! You're okay!

824
01:02:09,704 --> 01:02:12,624
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!

825
01:02:16,294 --> 01:02:17,378
Sorry.

826
01:02:17,504 --> 01:02:21,216
It must have been rough down there.
I can't believe I found you.

827
01:02:21,341 --> 01:02:23,426
You really had me worried.

828
01:02:24,469 --> 01:02:26,763
Say! The Mayor was right!

829
01:02:26,888 --> 01:02:29,140
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

830
01:02:29,265 --> 01:02:32,310
Okay, I'm all right, and so are you.

831
01:02:37,857 --> 01:02:39,901
Citizens of Whoville!

832
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:46,241
I'd like you to meet our friend Horton.

833
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:52,330
He's going to help us!

834
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:56,042
I've got this.

835
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:58,378
This is the Chairman...

836
01:02:58,503 --> 01:02:59,546
Idiot!

837
01:02:59,671 --> 01:03:02,590
You're finished in this town!
Is that understood? Finished.

838
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:04,259
You boob!

839
01:03:05,844 --> 01:03:07,720
I'm just joking.

840
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:13,393
Good one.

841
01:03:13,518 --> 01:03:15,562
Horton, this is my wife Sally.

842
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:16,938
You exist!

843
01:03:17,063 --> 01:03:19,441
This means my husband isn't crazy.

844
01:03:19,566 --> 01:03:21,109
Hooray!

845
01:03:21,234 --> 01:03:25,447
And a few of my daughters,
Haley, Holly, Hooly, Hilda and Hedy.

846
01:03:25,572 --> 01:03:26,698
- Hi!
- Hi!

847
01:03:26,823 --> 01:03:30,326
And here is Miss Yelp, my loyal assistant.

848
01:03:30,452 --> 01:03:33,037
- And here's Dr. Larue.
- You saved us!

849
01:03:33,163 --> 01:03:34,581
And Burt from accounting,

850
01:03:34,706 --> 01:03:37,375
and Mrs. McGillicuddy, and Mr. Farfoogan

851
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,377
from the Clugan Farfoogans,

852
01:03:39,502 --> 01:03:41,212
and the old man in the bathtub.

853
01:03:41,337 --> 01:03:43,047
Let's not overwhelm the poor fellow.

854
01:03:43,173 --> 01:03:44,883
He's never gonna remember
all these names.

855
01:03:45,008 --> 01:03:47,886
Well, I'll try my best.

856
01:03:48,887 --> 01:03:51,139
Sally, Chairman,

857
01:03:51,264 --> 01:03:53,433
Haley, Hooly, Holly, Hilda,
Hedy, Miss Yelp,

858
01:03:53,558 --> 01:03:56,436
Dr. Larue, Burt from accounting,
Mrs. McGillicuddy, Mr. Farfoogan

859
01:03:56,561 --> 01:04:00,690
of the Clugan Farfoogans,
and wasn't there an old guy in a shower?

860
01:04:00,815 --> 01:04:02,066
Bathtub.

861
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:04,235
- Yeah!
- We're all here, Horton,

862
01:04:05,028 --> 01:04:08,615
and we all believe in you.

863
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:11,451
Wow. That's awesome.

864
01:04:11,576 --> 01:04:14,370
And it's a responsibility
I do not take lightly.

865
01:04:14,496 --> 01:04:18,625
I promise you a future
that is safe, sound and stable.

866
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:24,005
We will create a world where every Who
is endowed with three inalienable rights,

867
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,673
to be determined at a later date.

868
01:04:27,175 --> 01:04:32,013
And we will put a speck on
Mount Nool before the end of this decade.

869
01:04:39,104 --> 01:04:42,023
This elephant is crazy! Oh, my goodness.

870
01:04:42,148 --> 01:04:45,819
I gotta tell everybody.
I need to get to the Kangaroo.

871
01:04:46,402 --> 01:04:48,780
Wait till they find out about...

872
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:52,617
You should have been seeing me.
I really let elephant have it.

873
01:04:52,742 --> 01:04:57,455
I chase him, I torment him, I break him
into million little elephant pieces.

874
01:04:58,081 --> 01:05:01,918
It was thing of beauty, really.
My best work. Classic Vlad.

875
01:05:02,043 --> 01:05:03,128
And the clover?

876
01:05:03,253 --> 01:05:07,048
Clover is finished!
No way in million years Horton find it.

877
01:05:07,173 --> 01:05:10,885
Read my beak. Clover is gone forever.

878
01:05:16,433 --> 01:05:20,145
I just saw Horton,
and he is still talking to that clover!

879
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,275
Idiot!

880
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:30,071
Whoa! Come on, I'm your bro!
It's me you're talking to. We have history!

881
01:05:30,864 --> 01:05:33,908
Come on, let's not forget,
I did this for free!

882
01:05:34,909 --> 01:05:38,037
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?

883
01:05:38,621 --> 01:05:41,791
There once was a time
when people were people

884
01:05:41,916 --> 01:05:43,877
and specks were specks.

885
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:48,715
Well, I say, 'If you can't see it,
hear it or feel it,

886
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,592
'it doesn't exist!'

887
01:05:51,509 --> 01:05:54,387
Our way of life is under attack!

888
01:05:54,512 --> 01:05:57,974
And who is leading that attack? Horton!

889
01:05:58,099 --> 01:06:00,685
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

890
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:03,146
Wait a minute!
This is Horton we're talking about.

891
01:06:03,271 --> 01:06:06,191
You all know him, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

892
01:06:06,316 --> 01:06:10,528
Except for that fly city he sat on.
But he didn't do that on purpose.

893
01:06:10,653 --> 01:06:12,197
Shut up, mouse!

894
01:06:13,156 --> 01:06:16,951
That's weird. My brownies are burning.
I gotta go!

895
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:23,583
Are we going to let troublemakers like
Horton poison the minds of our children?

896
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:25,460
Not the children!

897
01:06:26,127 --> 01:06:30,799
When Horton tells our children
about worlds beyond the jungle,

898
01:06:30,924 --> 01:06:33,134
he makes them question authority!

899
01:06:33,259 --> 01:06:37,263
Which leads to defiance!
Which leads to anarchy!

900
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:39,849
Yeah! Horton must pay!

901
01:06:39,974 --> 01:06:41,392
It's that speck!

902
01:06:41,518 --> 01:06:43,353
We have to do something!

903
01:06:43,478 --> 01:06:44,771
For the children!

904
01:06:44,896 --> 01:06:46,231
For the children!

905
01:06:46,356 --> 01:06:51,236
Are we going to let him
get away with this?

906
01:06:51,361 --> 01:06:53,363
No!

907
01:06:53,613 --> 01:06:55,323
Let's go!

908
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:22,392
 Morton! I told you! 100%!

909
01:07:23,101 --> 01:07:24,185
Horton!

910
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:26,688
Morton, pick up your feet! Jeez.

911
01:07:26,813 --> 01:07:28,314
It's not me!

912
01:07:30,316 --> 01:07:34,070
I see. It's an angry mob. Sorry, Morton.

913
01:07:34,195 --> 01:07:36,573
I thought it was you
that was making all the...

914
01:07:36,698 --> 01:07:38,074
But it's...

915
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:39,784
Oh, darn.

916
01:07:41,327 --> 01:07:42,787
Run, Horton!

917
01:07:43,747 --> 01:07:45,206
There he is!

918
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:47,792
Let's rope him!

919
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:49,502
Let's cage him!

920
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,923
 No! No! No!

921
01:07:57,469 --> 01:07:59,053
Stop!

922
01:08:00,513 --> 01:08:02,640
Hey, fellas. Good to see you,

923
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:04,142
all at once.

924
01:08:04,476 --> 01:08:05,894
You look really great as a horde.

925
01:08:06,019 --> 01:08:07,979
Horton, Horton, Horton,

926
01:08:08,104 --> 01:08:11,775
look at the mess
you've created for yourself.

927
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,612
All this hullabaloo over a silly little flower.

928
01:08:16,196 --> 01:08:17,697
It's a speck.

929
01:08:18,198 --> 01:08:22,952
Right. I mean, it's silly, really,
all this talk of roping you,

930
01:08:23,078 --> 01:08:27,415
and caging you, and, well,
we don't need to go into the details.

931
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:32,629
The point is, this angry mob,
all the trouble you're in,

932
01:08:32,754 --> 01:08:34,756
it can all go away.

933
01:08:37,133 --> 01:08:39,928
- Really?
- Of course.

934
01:08:40,428 --> 01:08:45,517
All you have to do is admit to everyone
that there are no little people

935
01:08:45,642 --> 01:08:47,435
living on that speck.

936
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,980
That you were wrong and I was right.

937
01:08:52,148 --> 01:08:57,320
You do that and things can go right back
to the way they were.

938
01:08:57,987 --> 01:09:04,244
But if you don't, you're going to
have to pay the price.

939
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,587
So, I just have to say it isn't true?

940
01:09:19,801 --> 01:09:23,888
Go ahead. Rope me, cage me.
Do whatever you want.

941
01:09:24,389 --> 01:09:26,349
But there are people on this speck.

942
01:09:26,474 --> 01:09:30,937
And they have a Mayor, who has
96 daughters and one son named JoJo,

943
01:09:31,062 --> 01:09:34,065
who all share a bathroom,
whatever that is,

944
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:38,945
And even though you can't hear
or see them at all,

945
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:42,365
a person's a person, no matter how small.

946
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:52,208
That was beautiful, Horton.

947
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:54,544
Rope him! Cage him!

948
01:09:54,669 --> 01:09:58,882
And burn that speck
in a pot of boiling Beezlenut oil!

949
01:10:03,303 --> 01:10:05,305
They don't believe we're here.

950
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:07,557
We've got to make some noise!

951
01:10:07,682 --> 01:10:09,893
We are here! We are here! We are here!

952
01:10:10,018 --> 01:10:12,103
We are here! We are here! We are here!

953
01:10:12,228 --> 01:10:13,813
We are here! We are here! We are here!

954
01:10:13,938 --> 01:10:15,315
Come on!

955
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:18,401
- Everybody!
- We are here! We are here! We are here!

956
01:10:18,526 --> 01:10:20,695
We are here! We are here! We are here!

957
01:10:29,245 --> 01:10:33,208
This will teach you not to make up stories
about people on specks!

958
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,668
Listen! There they are!

959
01:10:39,631 --> 01:10:41,424
- Rope him.
- Cage him!

960
01:10:42,008 --> 01:10:43,635
It's not working.

961
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,429
I can hear you,
but their ears aren't strong enough.

962
01:10:46,554 --> 01:10:48,181
We need to be louder!

963
01:10:48,306 --> 01:10:51,392
Get every Who to make noise! Everyone!

964
01:10:51,518 --> 01:10:55,105
We are here! We are here! We are here!

965
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:57,315
JoJo! Where are you going?

966
01:10:57,524 --> 01:11:00,610
We need every voice! JoJo!

967
01:11:04,155 --> 01:11:08,451
You need to make some noise down there,
or we'll all be destroyed!

968
01:11:09,327 --> 01:11:12,705
The Mayor grabbed a tom-tom
and started to smack it,

969
01:11:13,998 --> 01:11:17,252
and all over Whoville,
they whooped up a racket.

970
01:11:19,462 --> 01:11:22,090
They rattled tin kettles!
They beat on brass pans!

971
01:11:22,215 --> 01:11:24,676
On garbage pail tops
and old cranberry cans!

972
01:11:24,801 --> 01:11:27,720
They blew on bazookas
and blasted great toots.

973
01:11:27,846 --> 01:11:31,224
On clarinets, oompahs,
and boompahs, and flutes!

974
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,228
There!

975
01:11:37,313 --> 01:11:38,690
Can they hear us now?

976
01:11:39,274 --> 01:11:43,361
Listen, please.
It's the most beautiful thing ever.

977
01:11:43,486 --> 01:11:45,321
I don't hear nothing!

978
01:11:45,822 --> 01:11:48,366
I don't think so. But keep trying.

979
01:11:49,617 --> 01:11:51,411
I'll never give in!

980
01:11:55,582 --> 01:11:59,669
Are you sure that every Who down
in Whoville is trying?

981
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:08,136
We are here! We are here!

982
01:12:08,261 --> 01:12:09,763
Where's JoJo?

983
01:12:09,888 --> 01:12:12,223
Probably at the old observatory.

984
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,614
Hey! There's a limit!

985
01:12:34,954 --> 01:12:37,791
That's not supposed to stretch that far!

986
01:12:47,342 --> 01:12:48,635
JoJo!

987
01:12:49,177 --> 01:12:50,678
You built this?

988
01:13:41,187 --> 01:13:44,649
We are here! We are here! We are here!

989
01:13:44,774 --> 01:13:47,861
We are here! We are here! We are here!

990
01:13:49,446 --> 01:13:52,991
We are here! We are here! We are here!

991
01:13:59,497 --> 01:14:01,916
You're making a mistake.

992
01:14:04,252 --> 01:14:05,295
But, Mom!

993
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:08,214
This doesn't concern you, sweetie.
Back in your pouch!

994
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,764
Everybody! Don't stop!

995
01:14:18,558 --> 01:14:20,935
Keep going! This is gonna do it!

996
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:25,356
We are here! We are here! We are here!

997
01:14:25,482 --> 01:14:26,608
Can they hear?

998
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:27,817
No!

999
01:14:36,493 --> 01:14:40,080
No matter what happens,
I couldn't ask for a better son.

1000
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:45,418
Hey, JoJo!

1001
01:14:46,086 --> 01:14:48,213
Come on! Keep going!

1002
01:14:53,134 --> 01:14:54,761
No!

1003
01:14:59,766 --> 01:15:03,353
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1004
01:15:07,065 --> 01:15:08,108
No!

1005
01:15:14,614 --> 01:15:16,991
Yopp!

1006
01:15:22,872 --> 01:15:28,294
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1007
01:15:29,504 --> 01:15:31,339
I hear it! I hear it!

1008
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,007
They are there!

1009
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:37,846
And that Yopp,
that one small extra Yopp put it over,

1010
01:15:37,971 --> 01:15:40,765
and all the Who noises
burst out of the clover.

1011
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:42,642
- I hear it!
- Me, too!

1012
01:15:44,727 --> 01:15:47,188
Rudy. Give me that! Come...

1013
01:15:49,732 --> 01:15:53,027
Rudy. Get back in the pouch. Now!

1014
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:57,073
No, Mom.

1015
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,411
Wickershams! Get that clover!

1016
01:16:04,539 --> 01:16:07,167
Anybody! Take it from him!

1017
01:16:18,762 --> 01:16:21,347
You did it, Mayor. You did it.

1018
01:16:22,807 --> 01:16:24,100
We did it!

1019
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:28,772
Yeah!

1020
01:16:33,526 --> 01:16:35,028
Well done, son.

1021
01:16:36,446 --> 01:16:38,114
All right, Mayor!

1022
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:41,201
Dad, you're one of the greats!

1023
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:47,999
Whoa. Easy, everyone! Easy!

1024
01:16:49,626 --> 01:16:51,044
Hi, Vlad.

1025
01:16:55,006 --> 01:16:57,050
Well, I shouldn't, but...

1026
01:17:25,787 --> 01:17:27,997
Oh, man, that is nice touch.

1027
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:33,336
I am a mess with this, right?
Emotional! Here come the waterslide.

1028
01:17:35,046 --> 01:17:37,215
There's so many people to thank.

1029
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:39,050
The good people of Nool,

1030
01:17:39,175 --> 01:17:41,261
who put me in a cage
and poked me with sticks.

1031
01:17:41,386 --> 01:17:42,512
That was me!

1032
01:17:42,637 --> 01:17:45,765
My buddy Morton, for being the only one
who stood by me.

1033
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:47,016
Well, not right by me.

1034
01:17:47,142 --> 01:17:50,770
He hid in the bushes,
sending me good thoughts. He's small.

1035
01:17:50,895 --> 01:17:53,106
Dude, you are a warrior poet.

1036
01:17:53,565 --> 01:17:57,277
And most of all, I'd like to thank
the Mayor of Whoville,

1037
01:17:57,402 --> 01:17:58,862
who believed in me from the beginning.

1038
01:17:58,987 --> 01:18:02,532
Horton, we're going to miss you.

1039
01:18:04,868 --> 01:18:06,536
What are we gonna do
without you, Horton?

1040
01:18:06,953 --> 01:18:09,831
Don't worry. I'll always be around.

1041
01:18:10,957 --> 01:18:13,960
And even as I wander

1042
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:16,504
I'm keeping you in sight

1043
01:18:16,629 --> 01:18:19,048
You're a candle in the window

1044
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:21,176
On a cold, dark winter's night

1045
01:18:21,301 --> 01:18:22,594
Beautiful metaphor.

1046
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,971
And I'm getting closer

1047
01:18:25,096 --> 01:18:29,809
Than I ever thought I might

1048
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:32,562
That's a little high for me.

1049
01:18:32,687 --> 01:18:37,776
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1050
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:43,573
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1051
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:46,993
And if I have to crawl upon your floor

1052
01:18:47,118 --> 01:18:48,369
Crawl upon the floor

1053
01:18:48,495 --> 01:18:49,871
Come crashing through your door

1054
01:18:49,996 --> 01:18:51,206
Crashing through your door

1055
01:18:51,331 --> 01:18:54,626
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1056
01:18:54,751 --> 01:19:01,424
I can't fight this feeling anymore

1057
01:19:05,345 --> 01:19:09,891
And so all ended well,
for both Horton and Whos,

1058
01:19:10,016 --> 01:19:13,353
and for all in the jungle, even kangaroos.

1059
01:19:13,478 --> 01:19:16,689
So let that be a lesson, to one and to all.

1060
01:19:16,815 --> 01:19:21,361
A person's a person,
no matter how small.

1061
01:19:38,962 --> 01:19:41,548
And I can't fight this feeling anymore

1062
01:19:41,673 --> 01:19:43,591
Yeah, I like this. Faster, more up-tempo.

1063
01:19:43,716 --> 01:19:46,719
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1064
01:19:46,845 --> 01:19:48,805
I can't fight this feeling

1065
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:52,058
It's time to bring my ship into your shore

1066
01:19:52,183 --> 01:19:53,184
That's a metaphor!

1067
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:54,394
And throw away the oar

1068
01:19:54,519 --> 01:19:55,562
Another metaphor!

1069
01:19:55,687 --> 01:19:57,480
And buy an engine

1070
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:02,527
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore

1071
01:20:02,652 --> 01:20:04,529
From the weight of my trunk to my toes

1072
01:20:04,654 --> 01:20:07,490
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1073
01:20:07,615 --> 01:20:10,076
Well, you shouldn't be fighting anything.
Enjoy yourself.

1074
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:13,329
If I have to crawl across the floor

1075
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:16,082
- Now, break down your stupid door
- Crashing through your door

1076
01:20:16,207 --> 01:20:19,002
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1077
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:20,378
On an empty stomach

1078
01:20:20,503 --> 01:20:22,046
I can't fight this feeling

1079
01:20:22,172 --> 01:20:23,173
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Eee, eee, eee

1080
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:25,008
I can't fight this feeling

1081
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:26,259
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Eee, eee, eee

1082
01:20:28,887 --> 01:20:30,805
I'm just saying words.

1083
01:20:32,807 --> 01:20:35,226
That felt so good. Cathartic!

1084
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,228
What?
