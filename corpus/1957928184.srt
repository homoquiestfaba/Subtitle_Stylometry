You're probably the rightful king
of some distant country

who looked like you and did a swap!

to him, or them,

Why would rats and a cat be friends?

an arrangement. No, don't tell me!

00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,720
She's got us bang to rights, boss.

348
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
You won't tell on us, will you?
Ha!

349
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,840
A talking cat
and a talking, tap-dancing rat?

350
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
They'll think I'm making up stories
again

351
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,720
and I'll be locked out of my room
as punishment. Locked out?

352
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,960
So I can't get to my books. It might
not be obvious, but I read a lot.

353
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,120
My father says "Too much!"

354
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,360
(ALL) Ah!

355
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,840
So, here's the question -
how did you learn to talk?

356
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,120
In a real story,
this is where we'd get a flashback.

357
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,280
Flashback? What's that?
It's where you get the backstory.

358
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,440
Go ahead, tell me what happened.

359
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,720
There doesn't seem to be a way
to tell her no.

360
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,720
What happened? Er...

361
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,920
No-one knows for sure, you know,
but, erm...

362
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,240
Rats eat rubbish. That's what we do!

363
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,280
That was back when we were just
normal, everyday rats,

364
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,920
squeaking and squabbling.

365
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,200
We ate whatever we could find.
The stubs of candles, for example!

366
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,040
We love candle stubs!

367
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
And a weather-beaten broomstick.

368
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,920
That can be good to get your teeth
into. And powders and potions.

369
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,320
We drank green bubbly stuff
from the bottoms of cauldrons

370
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,880
and gnawed our way
through worn-out spell books.

371
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,480
Ha! Doesn't sound like an ordinary
rubbish heap!

372
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,120
We eventually figured that out.

373
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,160
The dump belonged to
Unseen University of Ankh-Morpork...

374
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,840
..the establishment of learning,
where magic is studied.

375
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
All the mixed-up magic leftovers
from the men in pointy hats!

376
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,560
I like it.

377
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,520
Once we got smart,
we learned to read

378
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,000
and gave ourselves names from
the things we found in the dump.

379
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,760
"Sardines."

380
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,640
"Peaches."

381
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,760
(TRIO) "In-Brine!"

382
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,600
What of the cat?
Cats don't eat any old rubbish.

383
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,000
Decidedly not!
He never ate anything off the dump,

384
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,080
but he did get intelligent
around the same time.

385
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,040
As an intelligent cat, I do vow,
and it is a point of pride,

386
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,400
to not eat anything that can speak.

387
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,080
I know just what we must do next
to solve the mystery of our town!

388
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,840
Huh? What mystery?
The missing food! The rats are gone!

389
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,920
Why else would you be in this story,
if not to solve the mystery?

390
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,720
We need to sneak into
the Rat-Catcher's Guild

391
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,280
and find out what they're up to.

392
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,560
Ah. I am oddly compelled to follow.

393
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,040
It's a gift.
I'm off to get my adventure bag.

394
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,120
Yah! Ready?

395
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,160
Let's go!

396
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,320
I think I love her.

397
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,760
(GOBBLES GREEDILY)

398
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,000
Er, sir?

399
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
You, er, you wanted to see us,

400
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,400
sir.

401
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,880
There are new rats in town.

402
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,320
Are you sure, sir?
(CHOMPS NOISILY)

403
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,040
The traps are empty. We...
I can feel it!

404
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,160
Catch them and bring them to me.

405
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,880
Yes, sir! Right off, sir!

406
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,120
You know I have a thing...

407
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,560
..for rats.

408
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,360
(SIGHS) Important safety tip.

409
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,920
Don't eat a dead rat
that just ate something,

410
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,600
that just ate something,
that made it dead.

411
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,880
Dangerous Beans says
we shouldn't eat rats at all.

412
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,880
True. Very true.
Unless you're hungry.

413
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,440
But rats are always hungry.
My point exactly.

414
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,280
Strange.

415
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,760
Reminds me of, erm,

416
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,320
a Prattle and Johnson
Little Snapper,

417
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,680
but those are not round
like this one.

418
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,040
Mm...

419
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,400
Ah...
And there's no extra safety catch.

420
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,720
I think we need... Mr Clicky.

421
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,240
(HUSHED WHISPERS) Mr Clicky!
Come on, Mr Clicky.

422
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,000
(ALL MURMUR)

423
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,000
Mr Clicky!

424
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,280
Oy, good luck, buddy!

425
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,280
It's showtime, Mr Clicky!

426
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,080
Go, Mr Clicky, you can do it!

427
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
On the double, soldier.

428
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,760
What are you waiting for?

429
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,320
(MR CLICKY SQUEAKS)
Time to do your duty.

430
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,080
Mr Clicky?
Hey!

431
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,240
Where do you think you're going?!
Come on, lad!

432
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,320
You're made of metal. This...

433
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,040
can't... hurt.

434
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,440
Ugh!

435
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
Darktan?!

What is this?

440
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,440
Ingenious. Never seen this before.

441
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,280
It's a cage.
A cage.

442
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,920
(GASPS) A cage!

443
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,000
What's a cage?

444
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,320
It's used to capture a rat.

445
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,760
Who would want to keep a rat?

446
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,400
(CACKLES)

447
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,320
"And because of Olly the Snake's
trick with the road sign,

448
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,240
Mr Bunnsy did not know
that he had lost his way."

449
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,360
"He wasn't going
to Howard the Stoat's tea party."

450
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,760

(BELLOWS DRAMATICALLY)

452
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,480
She seems to think that it's no good
looking inconspicuous

453
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,160
unless people can tell
that you are being inconspicuous.

454
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,120
The trouble is, your lady friend
thinks life works like a fairy tale.

455
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,840
Mm. That's harmless, though,
isn't it?

456
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,320
Maybe. But in fairy tales,

457
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,680
when someone gets hurt...

458
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,880
..it's just a word.

459
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,440
Hm?

460
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,920
Luckily,
I'm prepared for every eventuality.

461
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,520
The grapnel and the rope ladder
take up a lot of room.

462
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,720
And then there's the medicine kit
and the kettle, the back-up kettle,

463
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,720
the sewing kit...(GASPS)
..and the mirror for sending signals

464
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,840
and these!

465
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,760
Hair pins? You just push it
into the keyhole and twiddle.

466

Malicia, those things work
in stories, not... That's right!

Oh, dear me. So,
we're back in your story, are we?

468
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,880
And what am I in your story?

469
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,000
Mm, not sure. You're not handsome
enough for a love interest

470
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,480
and you're not funny enough
for comic relief.

471
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,040
Maybe you're just
the sympathetic friend

472
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,040
who serves as a sounding board to
help me resolve my ethical dilemmas.

H-How is it you know
how to pick locks?

474
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,040
I told you, they lock me
out of my room to punish me.

475
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,560
I've seen thieves at work,
"cat burglars" they call them

476
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,920
because they are nearly as clever
as cats.

477
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,120
They have complicated little tools

478
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,480
which are used with great care
and precision.

479
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,360
They don't ever just...

Oh, no! I didn't expect this!

Well, it's a dirty room full of junk,
what did you expect?

485
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,720
I was expecting something horrible,
yet interesting.

486
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,160
Some ghastly clue
that would advance the plot.

487
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,840
The world doesn't have a plot. Things
just happen, one after another.

488
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,160
Pfft! There's always a plot.
You just have to know where to look.

489
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,760
Ha! That's it!
A secret passage, of course!

490
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,360
Everyone, look for the entrance
to the secret passage!

491
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,360
What does a secret passage
look like?

492
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,120
Well, it won't look like one,
of course!

493
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,240
Oh, well, in that case,
I can see dozens of secret passages.

494
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,000
Er, I don't know
how to look for something

495
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,800
that doesn't look like
the thing I'm looking for.

496
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,080
Agh!
I know it's a rather daring idea,

497
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,840
but suppose there might not be
a secret passage?

498
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,840
There has to be!
But they're hard to find.

499
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,040
And then you give up,

500
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,120
and it's when you give up and lean
against... that wall,

501
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,720
that you inadvertently operate
the secret switch!

502
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,040
Huh...

503
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,760
I'll just rest my arm innocently
on this coat hook.

504
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,680
And look! A sudden door in the wall
miraculously...

505
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,040
..fails to appear!

506
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,200
Clearly, certain villains
totally fail to know

how to design
a proper secret passage.

Hey! Why is there a rat hole
in a rat-catchers' building?

I wouldn't come near this place
if I were a rat.

Yes! That often happens in stories!

The stupid person comes up
with the good idea by accident!

513
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,640
There's a sort of little lever
in there.

514
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,800
I'll give it a... push.

A collection of rats, their tails
knotted together, and then...

We didn't mean to.
We put a handful of rats in a bucket

..there it was!

The rats, together, their minds merge
to form one creature.

760
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,320
It gains consciousness, power,
mind power.

761
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,680
It can dominate and control others.
