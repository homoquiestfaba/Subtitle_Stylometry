00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:28,939
PRESENTED BY  CENTRAL ANIME

22
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:28,939
NOT FOR SALE OR RENT

23
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,598
...and that's the Second 
Kisarazu Artificial lsland.

24
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:43,209
450,000 square 
meters in total area.

25
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:47,810
That and the artificial island off the coast 
of Kawasaki are the key points of this project.

26
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,000
When it's done,
 the project will be in its final stage.

27
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,209
Then we'll construct a 15 km long dike 
to connect both islands to each other...

28
00:05:56,209 --> 00:06:00,019
...and to Kawasaki and 
Kisarazu on the mainland.

29
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:05,019
When the project is complete it will not only 
provide a highway that circumvents the metropolis...

30
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:09,329
...but it'll use tidal height differences 
to drain the water from the area.

31
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:15,629
In ten years it'll have created 45,
000 hectares of new land.

32
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:21,939
Enough to eliminate our land 
problems for the rest of the century.

33
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:28,639
Like Babylon,
 Tokyo will be an eternal paradise.

34
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,038
Project Babylon...
 the biggest project of the century.

35
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,750
Given the difficulty of the 
adjustments facing the participants...

36
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,949
...it might not've been completed in this century.
 But Labor systems made it possible.

37
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,348
The basic research was 
completed in the late 80's.

38
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:46,658
But if it weren't for the massive 
demand for this project...

39
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:51,259
...it would never have 
developed this quickly.

40
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:57,468
As a matter of fact, we have a total of 
3600 Labors working here, large and small.

41
00:06:57,468 --> 00:07:02,670
That's about 40% of the Labors 
working in the entire country.

42
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:07,968
A Labor is a machine that can do 
the work of ten men in less time...

43
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:11,180
...and this ocean project is only practical 
because of an intensive use of them.

44
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,778
An old fairytale 
is now coming true.

45
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:20,879
Mind you... we're now getting 
things like Labor-crimes...

46
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,189
...which we couldn't 
have imagined either.

47
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,490
Aaahh, that's your 
specialty isn't it ?

48
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:36,399
Oh,
 there it is at 5 o'clock.

49
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,098
It's 500 meters in length,
  and 150 meters high.

50
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:44,399
The platform handles maintenance for 
all the Labors working on the project.

51
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,699
We call it the Ark

52
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,408
Tell me...
 why's it called the Ark ?

53
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:52,939
How the hell should l know ?

54
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:01,120
Deactivating systems 1 to 5.

55
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,920
Display functioning normally...

56
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,620
See ?
 It's working perfectly.

57
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,718
There don't seem to 
be any problems yet.

58
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:10,620
Come on !
 There won't be any problems !

59
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,228
To begin with, we checked thoroughly 
before we even brought it in here.

60
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,228
Was it Shige,
 from your place ?

61
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:18,930
It's good to be careful,
 but he's too careful.

62
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,028
Anyway, there haven't been any 
problems with them, right ?

63
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,639
The guys from Hachiouji have 
been pushing me to get the OK...

64
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,338
...to roll out Unit #2 and 
start production of the others.

65
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:31,639
...I'll start it up with 
the backup this time...

66
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,839
Oh, wait.

67
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,150
Two people from the second 
unit are here to pick you up.

68
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,450
The Second Unit ?

69
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,950
...ALRIGHT !!!

70
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,060
Whaddya think Noa ?
 Wasn't it worth coming over ?

71
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,450
I don't like this kid...

72
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,060
WHAT ?!

73
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,160
You said you wanted to see it,
 so l made all the excuses to get here.

74
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,259
And this's the thanks l get ?!

75
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,060
Sorry,
 it just slipped out...

76
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,869
Okay,
 let's call it a day.

77
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:03,270
Roger

78
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,579
Officers Shinohara 
and Izumi reporting.

79
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,879
Here to pick up Chief Nagumo.

80
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,180
Well,
 that was pretty quick.

81
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,070
I didn't know you 
two were coming.

82
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,190
We hitched a ride on a civilian chopper 
that happened to drop by SV2, Ma'am.

83
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,890
The maintenance squad's 
ferry is on the way.

84
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,989
But if possible, while we wait for it.
..I was wondering...

85
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,089
You're Goto's men alright.

86
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:38,099
I don't know how you 
sniffed it out...

87
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,489
...but you can 
test it if you like.

88
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:43,599
Though, Officer lzumi 
doesn't seem to like it...

89
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,800
Looks like she heard us...

90
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,190
That's 'cause you didn't 
watch what you were saying.

91
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,300
Now she'll have it in for you.

92
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,109
But what l said was true.

93
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:53,609
He looks a bit villainous.

94
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,609
That's a matter of opinion.

95
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,609
Once it's officially registered 
it'll be called a Type-0...

96
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,540
...the final version 
of the Type-98.

97
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,520
It's also the first designed 
to be run entirely by HOS.

98
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,719
What's HOS ?

99
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:11,520
You don't know a thing 
about software do you ?

100
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,930
It's a system program that makes 
Labors run more efficiently.

101
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,829
Oh, it's just the 
Operating System...

102
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:22,629
HOS is the revolutionary OS that 
Shinohara released two months ago.

103
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:28,339
Even when installed in a conventional 
Labor it increases performance by 30%.

104
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,640
Hyper Operating System,
 ``HOS''.

105
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,940
Most Labors now have their 
mainframes re-written to HOS.

106
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,239
But no matter how good the vehicle is,
 it all comes down to the pilot's...

107
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,550
...
brains and guts !

108
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,450
Good !

109
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,650
Chief Nagumo of SV2,
 your ferry has arrived.

110
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,749
Please go to deck A-12.

111
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:47,749
WHAT ?!

112
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:49,249
It's here already ?

113
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,259
Come on,
 let's go.

114
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:05,060
Wow !

115
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,060
Just like a world for giants !

116
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,060
It's all Labor sized...

117
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,060
I'm gonna leave you two 
behind if you don't hurry !

118
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,869
Okay...!

119
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,379
Chief Nagumo,
 can l ask you a question ?

120
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,379
If it's about this place,
 l doubt l know any more than you...

121
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:30,390
No,
 it's about the Type-0...

122
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,089
Why is it here ?

123
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,790
You know that three 
of them were issued...

124
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,190
...to the New York 
police as an experiment...

125
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,339
You mean that crazy 
story about Kanuka...

126
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:44,800
...becoming chief of the 
first Labor unit over there ?

127
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,489
Shige, who went over there to 
give technical assistance...

128
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:53,109
...phoned me and asked if we could have it 
checked inside and out by someone from SV2.

129
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:55,499
Well, here we have access to 
Shinohara's Labor facilities...

130
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,499
...and we're close to the 
second command station.

131
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,700
It's the perfect place 
to keep it secret.

132
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,410
Is there a problem then ?

133
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,700
Certainly not.

134
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,520
If there was, it would've 
caused big trouble already.

135
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,719
It's just that it was Shige who asked,
 so l couldn't ignore it.

136
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,030
Extension of the 
training period ?

137
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,930
But l had your word that we'd 
have everybody back this week !

138
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,640
Yes,
 but things have changed.

139
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:38,140
The First unit's training on the Type-0 
is being extended for another week.

140
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,739
I demand a complete explanation.

141
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:44,550
We're already overworking the Second Unit,
 and they have problems to begin with.

142
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,349
If we have to work them even harder,
 there's no telling what kind of disaster we could have.

143
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:53,650
And I'm sure if we brought back the 
First Unit now they'd do just fine.

144
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,759
Nagumo, this decision came 
from the main department.

145
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,959
There's nothing l can do.

146
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,759
Then I'll report to the 
main department myself...

147
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,160
...and l will personally ask the Guard 
Division Chief to return the First Unit.

148
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,060
Wait !

149
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:11,670
Look, this goes against 
my better judgement...

150
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,869
...
so try to keep it a secret.

151
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,869
In the early morning,
 the day before yesterday...

152
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:21,479
...the JSDF 7th Sector's prototype heavy Labor 
suddenly ran away during a wind tunnel test.

153
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:25,180
It escaped from the base, and it actually 
took the paratroop Labor unit to stop it.

154
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,070
They don't know what caused 
the prototype to run away...

155
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,290
...and it was so heavily damaged 
that examinations haven't helped.

156
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,890
They must've been really panicked to have 
trashed it instead of taking it in one piece.

157
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,489
But what does that 
have to do with this ?

158
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:42,190
The Labor in question was built 
by Shinohara Heavy Industries...

159
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,300
...and it had the 
same OS as the Type-0.

160
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,489
I should also mention that they're 
trying to cover up the fact...

161
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:54,489
...that, at the time it ran away,
 he Labor was unmanned.

162
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:58,209
You get the picture ?
 This could become a real problem.

163
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,499
We'll have to practice self-restraint,
 as of right now.

164
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:04,700
You're joking,
 right ?

165
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,609
Seriously ?

166
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:10,920
Darn it.
 I hope this'll be over soon.

167
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,209
That's a rotten attitude !

168
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:15,619
Until the First 
Unit comes back...

169
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:19,420
...we're the only ones who can 
protect this city from criminals !

170
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,530
And who's gonna protect 
our human rights ?

171
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,829
We don't have any !!

172
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,729
Shocking,
 isn't it Shinshi ?

173
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:28,629
Yeah...I've only been home 
three times this month.

174
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:31,329
It's a certified 
marriage crisis.

175
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,040
That's why you shouldn't 
have gotten married !

176
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,540
Stationed in the middle of the reclaimed lands,
 far away from your family...

177
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,040
But hey, aren't we getting 
more dispatches these days ?

178
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,440
Call from sector 7,
 205 at Shimoya, Taitoh Ward !

179
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,839
Second Unit report to the site !

180
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,650
Repeat, 205 at Shimoya,
 Taitoh Ward...

181
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,650
As soon as you said it.
 Damn...

182
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,450
Let's Go !!

183
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,950
Roll out the trailer !

184
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,349
Hurry up with that 
revolver cannon !

185
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:59,359
I'll personally murder any 
slow-pokes, so move it !

186
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,759
A dangerous Labor is out of 
control and moving this way !

187
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,770
Please evacuate the area !

188
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,670
Run !!

189
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:20,770
Didn't you hear me ? I said run !
 Oh, here it comes !!

190
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,579
This is Sakura Fubuki 12 to 
Chief Goto of SV2, Second Unit.

191
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:35,589
The target's a Yotsubishi Tyrant 2000,
 from a construction site on Kokusai Street.

192
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:41,190
It's moving at 4km an hour and 
destroying civilian buildings.

193
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:46,190
Shinohara, keep going along the 
river; try to get ahead of the Labor.

194
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:46,999
Yes, sir !

195
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:49,900
Unit #2, start up immediately 
and pursue the target.

196
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,300
Roger !

197
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,489
Beginning start-up.

198
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:57,300
Ohta, remember ! Think of the driver's 
safety first ! You know what l mean ! !

199
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,609
Shut Up ! Quick response !
 Believe in your judgement at the scene !

200
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:04,609
Wouldn't it be better if you just 
said it out loud ? `DON'T USE THE GUN.'

201
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:06,700
Raise him...

202
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:30,129
The Yotsuboshi Tyrant is 
one of those heavy classes.

203
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,729
It's not very fast, but it's guaranteed 
to have a lot of power. Watch it.

204
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:37,140
I don't like these...

205
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,540
Hey !

206
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,739
He went that way !

207
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,940
That bastard crushed 
my squad car !

208
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,239
Make him pay !

209
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,940
Leave it to me !

210
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:52,749
YOU MORON !
 I HOPE YOU DROP DEAD !

211
00:16:56,349 --> 00:17:00,450
Somebody !
 Help me !

212
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,259
You !
 Driving the Labor !

213
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:07,959
This is the SV2, Second Unit !
 Hang on, l'm here to rescue you !

214
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,558
SECOND UNlT ?
 I'm dead !

215
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:11,558
What the...?!

216
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:14,670
I was being nice to you,
 just because you're a tax payer !

217
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,269
Well, no more Mr.
 Nice guy !

218
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,058
You bastard !

219
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,479
This is Sakura Fubuki 12,
 observing for Chief Goto.

220
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,278
102 is pummeling the runaway Labor 
in the middle of a residential area.

221
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:34,680
Oh,
 now it's kicking...

222
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,380
...
a drop kick now...

223
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,989
Can't you do 
something about him ?

224
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:44,190
Target and Unit #2 closing in.

225
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,989
It's coming Noa !

226
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:49,690
Hey, do something 
about the driver !

227
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,190
This thing's too strong !

228
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,298
Ohta !
 Use the stun stick !

229
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,308
Hit the S-RAM unit in the left chest 
area; you can finish it with one shot !

230
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:07,308
Alright, done !

231
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,700
Let's go grab some lunch.

232
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,209
WHAT ?!

233
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:17,719
What the hell !?

234
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,729
Ohta, don't !

235
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:36,430
All trailers,
 prepare to move out.

236
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,038
You just bought the farm !

237
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,640
Mission complete.

238
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,048
Target has been completely destroyed,
 damage to surrounding area extensive.

239
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:01,749
Give it a careful washing,
 then dry it !

240
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:02,450
Okay.

241
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,058
And where's the twit who dropped 
the Labor into the river ?!

242
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:06,759
He's taking a bath out back.

243
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,759
Okay, tell him to report 
to me when he's done.

244
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,759
Yes sir.

245
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,660
Reactivated ?

246
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,860
You mean to tell me that a 
deactivated Labor started up again...

247
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,370
...
without a driver ?

248
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,058
I couldn't believe it myself,
 even though l saw it with my own eyes.

249
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:25,568
And that idiot filled it with so many 
holes there's nothing left to examine.

250
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:27,269
Could you have made a mistake ?

251
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:30,278
You guys are tired,
 you've had a lot of dispatches...

252
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:32,580
What caused the 
original problem ?

253
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,979
What did the 
driver have to say ?

254
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:35,479
The usual sort of thing.

255
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:38,580
It just started-up all 
of a sudden during work...

256
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,180
Sure,
 of course he said that.

257
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,090
After all,
 he caused one hell of a mess.

258
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,090
But don't you think 
it's kind of unnatural ?

259
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,288
Until two months ago nothing 
like this ever happened.

260
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:48,890
We have 22 cases 
so far this month.

261
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,390
I wish we could run away.

262
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,100
What do we do with this report ?

263
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,900
What do YOU do ?

264
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,190
Do you think the brass 
would accept this ?

265
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,190
As far as they're concerned,
 today's Labors can't possibly run away.

266
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,110
Program malfunctions couldn't 
cause this kind of accident.

267
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,110
We'll just have to 
settle for driver error.

268
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,410
There won't be any 
legal action...

269
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,700
...not when all they have is 
the testimony of the driver...

270
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,420
...and a black-listed 
Labor unit member.

271
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,209
Noa !

272
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:26,519
What is it ?

273
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,920
Im not giving you any !
 This is my last bag !

274
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,830
Can you dig out the dispatch 
records for this month...

275
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,729
...
and copies of the reports ?

276
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,930
What do you want those for ?

277
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,028
Just do it.

278
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,630
Hey Pops !!

279
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,330
Can l use the fridge ?!

280
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,140
The computer room ?

281
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,340
Alright.
 Go ahead.

282
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,739
Thank-you !

283
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:51,940
You're so good at using people.

284
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,640
This isn't any of 
your business is it ?

285
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,249
What's it got to 
do with the Type-0 ?

286
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:59,048
Chief ! There's a call for you from 
Matsui of the lnvestigation division !

287
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:01,450
Fine !
 I'll take it in my office.

288
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,950
What have you started ?

289
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,950
Why ?
 Interested ?

290
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,930
``Yes. Shige Shiba from 
Tokyo City Police.''

291
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,729
``Special Vehicle,
 Section #2.''

292
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:42,028
``Absent ?''

293
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,130
``Oh yeah,
 Kanuka Clancy.''

294
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,630
Yes...

295
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,739
Are you still at it ?

296
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:58,749
Is that you Noa ? Don't stay in here,
 you might catch a cold.

297
00:22:58,749 --> 00:23:00,249
Go get some sleep.

298
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:03,350
You never know when 
you'll get a dispatch.

299
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,850
Right...

300
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,048
You too, Asuma.

301
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,670
Wow !

302
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,568
They're smaller than usual.

303
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:30,269
I wasn't able to give them 
all the attention they needed.

304
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:32,370
You're good at this,
 Hiromi.

305
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,058
Everyone'll be so pleased.

306
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:36,068
Well then, lzumi,
 please pick some.

307
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:39,068
We aren't sending them to market,
 so just take the red, ripe ones.

308
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:40,278
Okay...

309
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:42,580
By the way,
 where's Asuma ?

310
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,880
I thought he said he'd help,
 too.

311
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,278
He said he was on his way 
to the chief's office.

312
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,590
Looked like he'd pulled an all-nighter.
 It may have something to do with that...

313
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,288
Hmmm.

314
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:59,989
Hey, why don't we go share 
these with the chief ?

315
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:05,600
Taking into consideration each 
Labor's manufacturer, condition...

316
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,400
...and the background of each driver,
 l've found only one common factor among the runaways.

317
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,999
All of them, regardless of manufacturer,
 have a Shinohara HOS mainframe.

318
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:21,700
But 80% of registered 
Labors carry HOS...

319
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,410
Maybe, but it was in 
100% of the runaways.

320
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,420
And another thing; the increase in 
runaway cases began two months ago...

321
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,019
...coinciding with the 
date HOS was released.

322
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:36,019
It can't be a coincidence.
 ``HOS'' has some fatal defect.

323
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,830
I think we should submit this 
data to the department chiefs...

324
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:44,130
...and press Shinohara to 
release the HOS program !

325
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,229
Chief ?!

326
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:52,440
HOS is a revolutionary OS,
 and it has monopolized the field.

327
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,940
If there should be any defect,
 it would ruin Shinohara.

328
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,548
Besides, the officials who approve 
Labor OS's aren't total fools either.

329
00:25:03,548 --> 00:25:08,048
If there was any defect in HOS,
 it should have been detected during de-bug.

330
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:08,850
But...!

331
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,650
Listen.

332
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,259
Let's say there is some relationship 
between the runaways and HOS.

333
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:20,558
But what if ``HOS'' 
isn't defective ?

334
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:22,160
Wha...?

335
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,769
I mean, what if the runaways 
aren't caused by some bug...

336
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,670
...but something 
intentionally programmed ?

337
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,479
Would you read this for us ?
 This's the first report from Matsui.

338
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:51,390
Report on Hoba Eiichi...

339
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,390
Hoba ?...

340
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,890
You mean Hoba Eiichi,
 the programmer ?

341
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,590
Hoba Eiichi, the ace of Shinohara's 
software development division.

342
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,700
He's the genius who 
single-handedly developed HOS.

343
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Or rather,
 he was...

344
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,298
Estimated age: 30.

345
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:09,999
Returned from MlT in '97...

346
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,999
...and was immediately hired 
by Shinohara Heavy lndustries.

347
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:15,100
Address unknown. Profile unknown.
 Criminal record unknown.

348
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:20,999
Approximately 170cm. Physical character,
 including major illnesses unknown...

349
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:22,308
What lS this ?

350
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:27,410
Not only Shinohara's personnel computer,
 but school, city hall...

351
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,719
...and all of his personal 
records have been erased.

352
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,318
He's far past the 
point of suspiscion...

353
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:35,719
Then it's a piece of cake.

354
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,719
Just bust him and bring 
him in for questioning.

355
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:39,120
We can't.

356
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,318
Can't ?

357
00:26:40,318 --> 00:26:41,028
Why ?

358
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:47,130
Five days ago he was sent to 
the Shinohara line at the Ark...

359
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,729
...
and jumped into the sea.

360
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:51,538
His body was never found.

361
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
We certainly started 
a bit late on this.

362
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Just when we started 
sniffing around HOS...

363
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,150
If we'd only done 
something earlier...Dammit.

364
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,650
Oh, well.

365
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:14,150
Bug...program...Either way it 
looks like HOS is the culprit.

366
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,959
Now we have to figure out the big picture,
 and how Hoba fits in.

367
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:21,860
We'll leave the investigation 
of Hoba to Matsui, and...

368
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,360
Shinohara,
 why are you making a face ?

369
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,450
Then you knew it 
was HOS all along.

370
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,568
Boy, do l look like a fool,
 working all night...

371
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,058
If nothing turns up,
 you WlLL.

372
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:36,058
We still don't know what 
triggers the runaway.

373
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:38,670
I want you to continue with your analysis,
 assuming of course you still want to ?

374
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,870
YES !!!

375
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,880
Oh, and this matter should just be 
between those of us in this room.

376
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,940
Why's that ?

377
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,180
Don't you remember ?

378
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,989
Following last month's orders from above,
 Shige installed HOS in the Type 98's.

379
00:27:55,989 --> 00:28:00,390
If there's a relation between 
HOS and the runaways...

380
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,590
...then the 98's 
are also at risk.

381
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,090
Despite that, if there's a 
dispatch order, we have to go.

382
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,900
Revealing this information would 
only serve to worry the men.

383
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,999
I'm going over to Hachioji.

384
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,298
Pops...

385
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:15,190
I've got things l wanna check.

386
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,798
I'm not gonna interfere 
with your investigation.

387
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:19,308
I'd like to go too,
 Chief !

388
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:20,999
Please, can l ?

389
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,610
I probably don't have 
to tell you this, but...

390
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,499
I'll behave myself !!!

391
00:28:35,318 --> 00:28:37,420
Wha'cha doing ?
 Move it !

392
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,209
All right !

393
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:43,420
Are you sure about this ?

394
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,930
They'll be back by tonight. If we get a 
dispatch order l'll take over the command car.

395
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,528
I don't get it.

396
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:55,528
He's trying to prove that Shinohara 
lndustries is involved in this case.

397
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:57,038
It's so ironic.

398
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,840
The father's the president of 
a major Labor manufacturer...

399
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,239
...and the son's in 
the police Labor unit.

400
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:05,538
On top of that they're constantly fighting,
 like cats and dogs.

401
00:29:05,538 --> 00:29:08,749
But it's up to Shinohara 
to make the decision.

402
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:12,450
I don't like forcing people to make decisions,
 or ordering them to do so...

403
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:29,959
Now that production for project 
Babylon is done for awhile...

404
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,160
...we're concentrating 
on export.

405
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,568
We just recently increased 
production on this line by 20%.

406
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:39,269
I see.

407
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:43,870
You know, even though l see this view every day,
 l still feel like l'm dreaming.

408
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,778
Fifty years ago, we started a small parts 
factory for the US occupational force.

409
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:50,278
Then we grew from vehicle 
parts to machine manufacturing.

410
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:56,479
We started on industrial robot 
development the year Asuma was born.

411
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:59,890
And now the monsters called 
Labors are flowing down the line.

412
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,190
But l'm lost...

413
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,690
I studied a lot, but fifth generation 
computer or system engineering...

414
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,999
I just can't handle them. As a mechanic.
.. I really feel lonely...

415
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:17,100
I'm just about the same.

416
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,600
Everybody was constantly kicking me 
upstairs as a ``Vehicle God'' or something,

417
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,610
but when it comes to software 
l'm basically a beginner...

418
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,499
There's no way l can compete with 
Shige or any of the younger guys...

419
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:29,110
But Sakaki...

420
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,209
There's no point in fossil engineers 
sitting around comforting each other.

421
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:36,719
No matter how technology develops,
 there's one thing that holds true.

422
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:39,620
As long as the human side,
 those who make the machines...

423
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,209
...those who maintain the machines,
 and those who handle the machines...

424
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:48,830
...don't do anything bad,
 the machines won't play foul.

425
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:55,028
But Jitsuyama, l didn't come here as 
the SV2 maintenance squad leader...

426
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:59,229
...meeting the manager of Shinohara 
lndustries' Hachiouji factory.

427
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:03,239
I came to speak openly, as men who spend 
more time with machines than with their wives.

428
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:07,340
Your company's HOS,
 is it safe ?

429
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,140
That sure wasn't what l 
expected you to say...

430
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,850
This company's 
future depends on HOS.

431
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,850
It's been well 
received everywhere.

432
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:21,048
As a matter of fact, Project Babylon's 
construction time has been reduced by 30%.

433
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,749
That's not what l'm asking.

434
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,860
How is it ?

435
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,360
It's safe.

436
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,959
You have my guarantee.

437
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,269
Okay,
 got the copy is finished.

438
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,278
The master copy of HOS...

439
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,298
E...H...O..
.B...A......

440
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:25,239
E.Hoba ?

441
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:10,840
It's spreading rapidly !

442
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
No, l don't know 
the exact rate !

443
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,440
What ?
 We can't do that !

444
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,150
Just do it !
 Shut down the main computer !

445
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:22,450
Did you forget we're connected to the 
computers at other factories, too ? !

446
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,850
That little twit !

447
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:32,360
Damn !
 Did that surprise me or what ?

448
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,058
Did you leave anything behind 
that they could trace back to you ?

449
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:36,360
No way.

450
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,058
But the only people who know the room's 
lock's combination me and Jitsuyama...

451
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:41,670
...so they'll figure 
it out sooner or later.

452
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,170
Guess we can't go back 
there for a while...

453
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,870
But we did get the 
data we needed.

454
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,170
If something that risky 
is in the master copy...

455
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,778
...then even Shinohara lndustries 
hasn't broken the protection on HOS.

456
00:33:52,778 --> 00:33:57,479
We have eight thousand Labors lurking 
around Tokyo with a suspicious OS...

457
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:59,778
...and God only 
knows what's in it.

458
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:01,180
It's bad news alright...

459
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:05,489
...and sooner or later some of the 
sharper folks'll start to notice.

460
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:08,488
Eventually Noa 
will find out too.

461
00:34:08,488 --> 00:34:10,989
We'd better deal 
with this quickly.

462
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,289
Yes, sir !

463
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:52,318
We can see that again...

464
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:54,119
Oh ?

465
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,128
We saw it from every room...

466
00:36:57,128 --> 00:37:00,230
...but that's pretty 
common in today's Tokyo...

467
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,028
...
must be a coincidence.

468
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,429
I still don't get this Hoba guy.

469
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:10,338
I mean Labor related jobs have 
really high salaries, right ?

470
00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:15,438
So why did he choose all these battered 
apartments; 26 of them in three years ?

471
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:20,139
Don't you think it might be the 
best way to keep from being traced,

472
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:25,349
Buildings about to be demolished to make way for 
redevelopment are just as good as battered ones.

473
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:27,750
No neighbors to be interrogated.

474
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,750
If he was that cautious, then why'd he leave 
behind a change-of-address at city hall ?

475
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,159
And this after breaking 
into the files...

476
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:40,759
...and not only erasing his 
personal data at work...

477
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,159
...
but at his school over-seas.

478
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,659
As if he were showing off,
 eh ?

479
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:48,468
Hey, Officers.

480
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,968
You through yet ?

481
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,369
Oh, thank-you.
 Sorry about that.

482
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:14,188
Maybe he wanted to 
show us something.

483
00:38:14,188 --> 00:38:15,489
Show us what ?

484
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:18,188
What for ?

485
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:22,688
To find that out, l guess l'll 
have to follow our man Hoba's trail.

486
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:29,599
Matsui, are you sure we can 
screw around like this ?

487
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,000
The chief won't say 
anything for a while.

488
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,898
That's the way 
things always work.

489
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:35,699
That's what l don't understand !

490
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:39,309
Us, in the Crime lnvestigation Division,
 working at the request of the Guard Division !

491
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:42,210
That man, Goto,
 what is he ?

492
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,699
``Razor'' Goto.
 He's notorious at headquarters.

493
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:49,619
Then how come he's stuck out in 
the middle of the reclaimed land ?

494
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,318
Cause he was TOO sharp.

495
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:56,718
Let's go.

496
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,718
Wait !

497
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:10,628
This shows the geographical 
distribution of the runaways.

498
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:12,539
They're pretty 
concentrated alright.

499
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:16,338
Riverside Redevelopment...
 Shinjuku Subdowntown Development...

500
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:19,039
Ariake Harbor City...

501
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,338
But Shinohara, aren't they the areas that have 
the greatest numbers of Labors to begin with ?

502
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:25,548
I thought so too.

503
00:39:25,548 --> 00:39:28,349
This is the distribution 
of Labors in Tokyo.

504
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:32,148
I see.
 Interesting.

505
00:39:32,148 --> 00:39:35,349
There are other areas 
of concentration...

506
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:39,358
...but the incidents only 
occurred in these limited areas.

507
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,559
So there's something in those 
areas that triggers the runaways.

508
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:45,358
But what is it ?

509
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,059
I've been inputting anything and 
everything that comes to mind...

510
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:52,668
...and searching for a common factor,
 but the conditions are vague...

511
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:54,668
It's just no good...

512
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:57,059
I wish Shige was here...

513
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,968
Shinohara,
 why don't you take a break ?

514
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,679
You didn't get any sleep 
again last night, did you ?

515
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,278
I can't.

516
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:07,480
We don't know when our own Type 
98's might start doing something...

517
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,639
Look, just go out and 
get some fresh air !

518
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:16,789
Yesterday's dream is today's hope,
 and tomorrow's reality.

519
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:23,588
Making a step towards the realization of 
a fulfilled tomorrow...Project Babylon.

520
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,789
A challenge for 
the 21st century !

521
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,599
Sorry to keep you waiting !

522
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,699
ALL RlGHT !!!!

523
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,398
One each !

524
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:37,798
Hey, Asuma.

525
00:40:37,798 --> 00:40:40,108
Why don't you have one ?

526
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:40,699
Oh.

527
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:41,699
A tomato ?

528
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:46,500
Come on. You look like you 
need the most vitamins.

529
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,000
Why couldn't you get 
something more gutsy...!

530
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,418
What's wrong ?

531
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:57,418
I washed them.

532
00:40:58,718 --> 00:40:59,718
Noa...

533
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:01,418
...did you...

534
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,628
Come with me !

535
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,128
What is it ?

536
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:07,028
Just come !

537
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:10,429
Say l've got a date with you !

538
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,329
What the hell's this about ?

539
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:14,829
DROP DEAD !
 THAT ASSHOLE !

540
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:22,338
Did you actually get 
permission to leave ?

541
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:26,039
The chief said get 
some fresh air !

542
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,438
That's close enough,
 right ?

543
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:30,938
But we're both still in uniform,
 riding double on a scooter, without helmets...

544
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:33,548
...and l still think 
it's too risky.

545
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:35,750
Someone might see us together.

546
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,349
Don't worry about it !

547
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:40,759
I already checked the patrol 
schedules for the squad cars.

548
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:42,659
I'm not talking about that !

549
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:43,659
What ?

550
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:46,449
I said l'm not 
talking about that !

551
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:48,259
Then what are you 
talking about ?

552
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:49,960
Dammit !
 Just forget it !

553
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Okay !

554
00:41:55,568 --> 00:41:57,568
Thank you for waiting.

555
00:41:57,568 --> 00:42:01,369
20 inch slop pizza,
 ethnic style.

556
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:04,269
Great...

557
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:08,378
Are you sure about this ?
 Looks like we're attracting attention.

558
00:42:08,378 --> 00:42:09,579
Relax.

559
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:11,679
Just act natural and there 
won't be any problem.

560
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,980
Right.

561
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,179
Cheers !

562
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:21,188
But really, why'd you 
suddenly decide to treat me ?

563
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,789
Well,
 you see...

564
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:26,188
By the way,
 Noa...

565
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:28,188
Yes ?

566
00:42:28,188 --> 00:42:31,898
How's Alphonse 
been doing lately ?

567
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:35,298
He's doing great,
 of course....

568
00:42:35,298 --> 00:42:37,099
Why do you ask ?

569
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,599
Just wanted to know...

570
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,500
Alphonse is always 
doing great...

571
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Sakaki and everyone in the maintenance 
squad take good care of him...

572
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,500
He's been a good boy,
 and...

573
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,000
...
and he's doing just great !

574
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,718
He's not gonna run away !

575
00:43:10,028 --> 00:43:12,730
You did hear us,
 after all...

576
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:16,028
Tell me...

577
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:19,139
....Alphonse won't run away,
 right ?

578
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:20,338
I don't know.

579
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:22,938
I still don't know what 
triggers the runaway...

580
00:43:22,938 --> 00:43:26,039
The only man who 
did know is dead...

581
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:28,539
...and we haven't 
figured it out yet.

582
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,039
Then we can just 
rewrite the OS !

583
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:33,048
If HOS isn't online anymore...

584
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:35,648
Rewriting the OS would have to 
be done at the manufacturer...

585
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:37,750
...and to do that we'd have 
to fill out the paperwork.

586
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,048
Unless we come up with 
some proof of what...

587
00:43:41,048 --> 00:43:44,059
...causes the runaways,
 the brass'll never approve it.

588
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:48,159
But if we leave them like this 
and Alphonse runs away, then...

589
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,659
...he'll be destroyed,
 right ?

590
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:55,659
Like the Labors Ohta 
and l destroyed...

591
00:43:55,659 --> 00:44:00,468
Noa, just give me 
a little more time.

592
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:03,059
I'll find the solution.

593
00:44:05,468 --> 00:44:09,278
``Forward and backup 
are two-in-one.''

594
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:12,278
``The pilot shall follow 
the order of command.''

595
00:44:12,278 --> 00:44:15,179
Come on...

596
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:16,878
Let's eat.

597
00:44:16,878 --> 00:44:18,778
It's gonna get cold.

598
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:28,688
Look,
 just like Alphonse.

599
00:44:28,688 --> 00:44:33,099
Alphonse 1,
 the dog l had when l was little.

600
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:34,188
Oh ?

601
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:35,898
Then the present 
one is the second ?

602
00:44:35,898 --> 00:44:37,798
Nope, number 3.

603
00:44:37,798 --> 00:44:40,798
The second was a cat.

604
00:44:40,798 --> 00:44:41,699
Hunh ?

605
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:43,188
What's he doing ?

606
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:44,898
He must've heard something.

607
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:49,210
Dogs can hear some 
sounds that humans can't.

608
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,000
The wind must be 
whistling somewhere...

609
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:55,699
Wind whistling...

610
00:44:55,699 --> 00:45:00,210
What's wrong ?
 You look funny...

611
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,718
Wind...

612
00:45:02,718 --> 00:45:04,918
Sound...

613
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:07,918
Sounds inaudible to humans...

614
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:12,528
Noa,
 l've got to borrow this !

615
00:45:12,528 --> 00:45:14,429
There's something l 
have to check out, fast !

616
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:17,829
Borrow ? Then how am 
supposed to get back ?

617
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:22,338
And when you get back,
 tell the the chief to wait for my phone call !

618
00:45:22,338 --> 00:45:24,239
See ya !

619
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:25,438
Wait !

620
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:26,838
Idiot !

621
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:30,938
I HATE YOU !

622
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:41,849
I couldn't get 
hold of my old man.

623
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:44,548
The main office wouldn't 
tell me anything...

624
00:45:44,548 --> 00:45:48,449
...and when l phoned home they said 
he hasn't been back for a while.

625
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,759
He's a busy man.

626
00:45:50,759 --> 00:45:52,659
Sorry the place is a mess...

627
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:55,559
...my daughter and her 
children came over.

628
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:56,759
Your grandchildren ?

629
00:45:56,759 --> 00:45:59,059
I guess beer is out if 
you're still on duty...

630
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:00,968
I'll make you some coffee.

631
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:08,059
Before you do that, l want to know what 
sound frequency triggers the Labor runaways.

632
00:46:13,378 --> 00:46:15,878
The Sumitomo Building 
at Shinjuku Subdowntown.

633
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:19,068
The Twin Building 
at Riverside Park 21.

634
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:27,378
Both are high rises with a structure that 
acts like a giant whistle when the wind blows.

635
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:30,188
The Ariake harp bridge that 
connects Daiba and Chiba...

636
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:34,088
...its wire should vibrate,
 also making a whistle...

637
00:46:34,088 --> 00:46:38,898
Inaudible sounds to humans,
 but quite audible to a Labor's sensitive receptors.

638
00:46:38,898 --> 00:46:42,699
That's what triggered all 
these recent runaways.

639
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:47,210
Labor work places are concentrated 
in areas of the city...

640
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:51,309
...or in construction sites where 
such sounds are easily produced.

641
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,608
Hoba was quite a genius, choosing low 
frequency sounds to trigger the runaway.

642
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:58,210
It's no coincidence that he joined Shinohara,
 which was behind in the field.

643
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:01,718
My old man was trying to go up 
against the major corporations...

644
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,718
...and if possible,
 monopolize the market...

645
00:47:04,718 --> 00:47:07,519
...so he was easily 
hooked by HOS - the bait.

646
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:14,519
Just like he wanted,
 Labor OS is now dominated by HOS...

647
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:18,628
...and that's what's gonna 
kill Shinohara lndustries.

648
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:22,628
That's why l can't reach him. He realized 
what HOS is and he's running all over town.

649
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:23,628
Asuma...

650
00:47:23,628 --> 00:47:25,938
If that's made public now.
.. Shinohara will be...

651
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:34,239
If it isn't me, it'll be somebody else; sooner 
or later somebody'll reach the same conclusions.

652
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:39,250
I want you to make an 
announcement about the matter.

653
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,250
You don't want to turn 
Labors into villains, do you ?

654
00:48:04,059 --> 00:48:06,968
Asuma !

655
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,968
Hey, l'm back !

656
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:12,369
Asuma !

657
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:14,269
Rejoice Noa !

658
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:17,980
Your noble sacrifice 
has been rewarded !

659
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:23,480
Asuma ! Asuma !

660
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:29,989
Officer Asuma Shinohara.

661
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:34,989
You're being suspended for two weeks.
 I assume you know the reasons.

662
00:48:34,989 --> 00:48:36,389
No, l don't !

663
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:37,739
I'll spell it out for you:

664
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:40,398
Leaving base without 
permission while on standby.

665
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:42,838
Nearly using blackmail to elicit testimony,
 by invading an ordinary citizen's home.

666
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:44,599
Unauthorized use of 
a private computer.

667
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:47,898
Riding double with a colleague,
 and without a helmet.

668
00:48:47,898 --> 00:48:49,798
Drinking and driving,
 as well as other various traffic violations.

669
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:51,489
And more to come !

670
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:54,489
Under normal circumstances you would 
be put before a disciplinary comittee...

671
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:56,699
...for such intolerable 
violations of the regulations.

672
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:59,699
But this is not the time, and since Chief 
Goto so strongly petitioned your case...

673
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:01,699
...we'll quietly 
settle this matter.

674
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:05,639
You should be grateful to him, since he's 
willing to sacrifice himself to save his men.

675
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:06,619
I have a question !

676
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:08,019
What's happened to the Shinohara 
Heavy lndustries case ?

677
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:10,718
That isn't really any 
of your concern...

678
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:14,019
...but if we just left it 
at that you'd be a wreck.

679
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:18,028
Generally this is not something an 
officer would have anything to do with.

680
00:49:18,028 --> 00:49:21,028
Late last night, the president of Shinohara 
lndustries himself filed a report...

681
00:49:21,028 --> 00:49:25,730
...to the Ministry of lnternational Trade and lndustry,
 stating that HOS has a major flaw.

682
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,438
Taking the matter 
quite seriously...

683
00:49:27,438 --> 00:49:30,239
...the cabinet held an emergency 
meeting early this morning.

684
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:33,239
They accepted Shinohara's case and settled 
on rewriting HOS back to conventional OS.

685
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:37,338
To prevent any unnecessary panic 
this process will be carried out...

686
00:49:37,338 --> 00:49:45,548
...and described as a rewrite to a 
new version of HOS, free of charge.

687
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:48,548
You're kidding ! What about Shinohara 
lndustries' responsibility !

688
00:49:48,548 --> 00:49:51,048
I'm being punished,
 and he's getting away !

689
00:49:51,048 --> 00:49:53,759
Isn't it more fair to punish 
both sides in a fight ?!

690
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:56,559
What the hell do you 
think police are for ?!

691
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,858
Police investigations aren't 
used to support family feuds !

692
00:49:59,438 --> 00:50:01,438
Well,
 how about that.

693
00:50:01,438 --> 00:50:05,449
You guys knew the 
truth and were...

694
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:07,968
...dealing under the 
table the whole time !

695
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:01,449
Well, having someone 
in the Guard division...

696
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:04,559
...who doesn't even have the 
authority to investigate...

697
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,438
...snooping around without the permission 
of his superior, is lMPERMlSSABLE ! !

698
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:17,269
He must have figured that it's better 
to have admitted the fault himself...

699
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:20,278
...than to have it pointed 
out by someone else.

700
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:24,679
The government's more concerned about 
the public turning against Labors

701
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:26,878
...than about Shinohara's 
responsibility...

702
00:50:26,878 --> 00:50:29,579
Project Babylon is involved,
 and if that sinks, so will they.

703
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,789
So they stay silent 
about Shinohara.

704
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:37,188
They keep it quiet 
and cover it up...

705
00:50:37,188 --> 00:50:43,099
That's about it; don't get depressed,
 you did a great job...

706
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:47,398
We may have all had the data,
 but you reached the conclusion by yourself.

707
00:50:47,398 --> 00:50:49,398
Though that last 
move wasn't so good.

708
00:50:49,398 --> 00:50:53,898
But how did the captain find 
out about the scooter ride ?

709
00:50:53,898 --> 00:50:58,108
Oh, that ? I forced lzumi to spit it out,
 and then l informed him.

710
00:50:58,108 --> 00:51:00,000
....CHlEF ?!

711
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,608
You're tired aren't you ?

712
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:05,108
Well, now you can stop working and 
concentrate on the investigation.

713
00:51:05,108 --> 00:51:08,019
Investigation...Are you still 
thinking of continuing that ?

714
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:11,019
You're so pessimistic 
for your age.

715
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:15,918
Even Shinohara itself doesn't have 
a complete grasp on the matter.

716
00:51:15,918 --> 00:51:19,210
If the solution was as 
simple as a rewrite...

717
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,028
...Hoba wouldn't have 
killed himself so early on.

718
00:51:22,028 --> 00:51:23,628
Don't you agree ?

719
00:51:23,628 --> 00:51:27,929
Then...you still believe in the 
``Hoba's intentional crime'' hypothesis.

720
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:30,628
What do you think,
 Shinohara ?

721
00:51:30,628 --> 00:51:33,239
I think so too...

722
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:35,539
Asuma !

723
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:38,539
He's back !

724
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:40,338
SHlGE !

725
00:51:40,338 --> 00:51:42,338
HELLO !

726
00:51:43,438 --> 00:51:44,648
What's that costume ?
...

727
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:47,750
I could ask you the same thing.
 What're you doing in street clothes ?

728
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:51,449
Well, this and that happened and 
l got suspended for two weeks.

729
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:54,849
If you'd talked to us beforehand 
that may not have happened.

730
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:58,059
It's the price you pay for 
not thinking about teamwork.

731
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:01,659
Oh ? Which button do l have to 
push to make you say ``teamwork'' ?

732
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:03,059
WHAT ?!

733
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:04,858
Please, calm down,
 both of you...

734
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:09,769
...try to honor 
my safe return...

735
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:13,568
Oh, Shige, please fill out the 
form for program re-writing.

736
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:16,568
Right ! Sorry to put you to work as 
soon you get back, but could you ?

737
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:17,568
Do a rewrite ?

738
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:18,468
Yeah !

739
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,168
For the 98 ?

740
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:21,059
Of the OS !

741
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:26,378
What's the problem ?!
 We can't have HOS aboard !

742
00:52:26,378 --> 00:52:30,278
It's the reason l was killing myself working.
..and got suspended...

743
00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:32,480
I never did the rewrite to HOS.

744
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,889
What ?! But we got the 
order from headquarters...

745
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:38,789
So, l just pretended to rewrite.
 I threw in a dummy activation display...

746
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:41,389
...
and sent back the diskette.

747
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:46,699
Inside is the same old OS.
 You didn't have any problems, did you ?

748
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:50,798
Well, l sure was glad when l got the news 
over there that HOS was a chancy thing.

749
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:53,489
But it's all thanks 
to Sakaki's training.

750
00:52:53,489 --> 00:52:58,099
Even if it was good, l didn't feel 
like putting in some suspicious new HOS.

751
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:00,809
If anything happened l'd 
take full responsibility.

752
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:05,699
So off l went, secret in my heart.
 Well, it sure was a success !

753
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:07,409
Right ?

754
00:53:07,409 --> 00:53:09,909
But nobody ever heard about it ?

755
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:15,418
Funny...I told Goto when he called 
me international long-distance...

756
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:17,019
You told the Chief ?

757
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:18,619
In other words,
 he knew that if he didn't tell you..

758
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:22,918
...you'd work hard 
enough to kill yourself.

759
00:53:22,918 --> 00:53:25,929
He's at it again...

760
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:28,329
Now l know how Noa 
was feeling earlier...

761
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:33,128
He's been playing me like a puppet.
..That middle-aged weasel...

762
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:34,929
Poor Asuma...

763
00:53:34,929 --> 00:53:37,739
A CURSE ON HlM !

764
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:48,389
1-3 Eiichi Hoba...

765
00:54:59,188 --> 00:55:00,099
Hey !

766
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:02,000
It's in English...

767
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:11,909
``He bound the heavens also, and came down,
 and darkness was under his feet''

768
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:15,619
...It's one of the psalms 
in the Old Testament.

769
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:19,210
It must've been written 
there by Hoba himself.

770
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:23,210
But l still can't believe you 
found the house where he was born.

771
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:27,329
It was nothing. All l did was trace address 
changes and that's where l ended up.

772
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:32,429
But that's it,
 l can't go any further...dead end.

773
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,829
That area of town was 
deserted during the 80s...

774
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:38,730
...when there was that sharp 
increase in land prices.

775
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:42,039
After the National Land 
Act it was forgotten.

776
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:47,438
But how strange this city is...

777
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:56,548
As l traced his path l started to feel 
as though time were leaving me behind...

778
00:55:56,548 --> 00:56:03,659
What you think of as a familiar sight 
starts to rot away here and there...

779
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:06,759
...you look away for a moment 
and when you turn back it's gone.

780
00:56:06,759 --> 00:56:11,159
Gone before you even 
know what it meant.

781
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,938
In this town,
 the past is a worthless thing...

782
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,468
Look at it this way.

783
00:56:18,468 --> 00:56:20,869
The place where we're talking now 
was sea until a little while ago.

784
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:25,568
And in a few years there'll 
be a huge city in front of us.

785
00:56:25,568 --> 00:56:30,778
And then, someday,
 that will become the worthless past.

786
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:34,480
It's like a continual bad joke.

787
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,480
That's probably what 
Hoba was trying to say...

788
00:56:42,088 --> 00:56:45,938
``Where do we go..
.? What are we ?''

789
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:47,389
What's that ?

790
00:56:47,389 --> 00:56:48,889
An inscription.

791
00:56:48,889 --> 00:56:55,099
It was left on a wall by a 
Viking captain in ancient Europe.

792
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:00,188
You bozo !
 Snap it harder !

793
00:57:00,188 --> 00:57:02,298
Well...
Sorry about all this...

794
00:57:02,298 --> 00:57:04,699
Before you go...

795
00:57:11,409 --> 00:57:15,608
What's your opinion ?

796
00:57:15,608 --> 00:57:19,718
He's it, Goto,
 no mistake.

797
00:57:19,718 --> 00:57:25,619
But if he's a goner, then l guess there's 
not much more an inspector can do...

798
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:30,028
Well, l owe you for this one.
 I'll make it up to you some day...

799
00:57:30,028 --> 00:57:35,929
A tomato patch, a chicken house,
 and the maintenance crews are all out fishing...

800
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:39,628
...do they really call 
themselves police ?

801
00:57:39,628 --> 00:57:42,438
Not police...

802
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:45,438
More like defenders of justice.

803
00:57:46,699 --> 00:57:48,563
Tell me, do you think I'm 
still over-analyzing ?

804
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,398
What ?

805
00:57:50,398 --> 00:57:52,398
I can't say really...

806
00:57:52,398 --> 00:57:57,398
...but I am grateful that the defect was 
found before we actually got the Type 0.

807
00:57:57,398 --> 00:58:01,798
I asked Kanuka to do research 
on Hoba's stay at MIT.

808
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:04,699
While he was there 
he was called Jehovah.

809
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:05,898
Jehovah ?

810
00:58:05,898 --> 00:58:08,710
That's what they call 
God in the Old Testament.

811
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:12,309
It sounds alot like his real name,
 and he was probably smart enough to earn it.

812
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:15,108
Well, actually there's a 
follow-up story to that.

813
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:19,809
The proper pronunciation is 
``Yah-weh'' or ``Yah-ha-weh''.

814
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:24,608
``Je-ho-va'' is an incorrect 
one that spread by accident.

815
00:58:24,608 --> 00:58:28,710
When he found that out 
he was insanely happy.

816
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:33,318
You know, Shinobu, I'm starting to feel I 
understand the way this Hoba guy thinks.

817
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:35,718
Looking at those high-rises...

818
00:58:35,718 --> 00:58:40,218
...day after day,
 wondering what kind of crime to commit.

819
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:50,218
``And the Lord came down to 
see the city and the tower...

820
00:58:50,218 --> 00:58:52,028
...which the children of men builded.
  (Genesis 11-5)

821
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,429
Therefore is the name 
of it called Babel;

822
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:59,730
...because there did the Lord 
confound the language of the earth;

823
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:03,128
...and from thence did the Lord scatter 
them abroad upon the face of the earth.

824
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:08,218
Well,
 it could be coincidence...

825
00:59:08,218 --> 00:59:11,829
Do you think it's a coincidence that he 
chose the Ark as the place to kill himself ?

826
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:15,639
If this plan centers on a 
code based on the Bible...

827
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:19,039
...there's no way he's going to pass 
over a target like Project Babylon.

828
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:21,539
There's more to come.

829
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:24,838
These are clues 
left by Hoba himself.

830
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:31,438
Another example.
 He made it a point to leave messages.

831
00:59:31,438 --> 00:59:35,039
All 23 of the places 
Hoba lived in...

832
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,148
...overlap with the three Labor 
runaway zones that Asuma pointed out.

833
00:59:38,148 --> 00:59:40,349
Matsui was really puzzled.

834
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:43,349
He said it was as though Hoba was 
asking us to solve the mystery.

835
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:44,349
A challenge ?

836
00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:47,048
He's not that sort of romantic.

837
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:50,048
He wasn't going up 
against the police at all.

838
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:53,750
He had great confidence 
in his program...

839
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:58,048
...or else he wouldn't have 
died before seeing the result.

840
00:59:58,048 --> 00:59:59,648
When he jumped off he was 
probably laughing at us...

841
00:59:59,648 --> 01:00:05,960
No, everybody who 
lives in this city...

842
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:13,460
You know, you look so happy 
when you talk about Hoba.

843
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,559
Eh...?

844
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,059
...
that's dangerous...

845
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:17,460
Really ?

846
01:00:19,759 --> 01:00:23,968
Anyway, if it's that big a plot,
 are you sure those two can handle it ?

847
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:25,099
I think they'll be okay...

848
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:38,068
I'm sleepy...hungry .
..and worn out.

849
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:40,858
Okay,
 input's complete...

850
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:46,179
Here we go...

851
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:53,679
Okay...what's the parameter 
for the simulation program ?

852
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:57,778
Well, if 10.21Hz is the right number,
 then this is correct...

853
01:00:57,778 --> 01:01:01,079
That's all the 
damage there'd be ?

854
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:03,489
...I feel like 
I'm dealing blind.

855
01:01:07,188 --> 01:01:09,588
I don't get it...

856
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:16,889
I know it couldn't end 
with this little...

857
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:19,088
What data could be missing ?

858
01:01:19,088 --> 01:01:23,188
That inaccessible file in HOS...

859
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:28,088
If that could be taken apart we could 
prove Goto's theory about Hoba's crime.

860
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:31,699
Then we could spend more 
resources and personnel...

861
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:33,099
Then it's a Trojan 
Horse program ?

862
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:35,000
Probably...

863
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,398
That rewrite must've worsened the contamination,
 spread it even further...

864
01:01:38,398 --> 01:01:40,500
Such a stupid decision...

865
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,699
Shige !
 You have a guest !

866
01:01:45,398 --> 01:01:46,699
I've brought provisions !

867
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:48,599
How's it going ?

868
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,309
It just proved how 
powerless we are...

869
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:53,210
That's it ?

870
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,309
Here,
 I got a newspaper

871
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:55,909
Thanks.

872
01:01:55,909 --> 01:01:58,210
Let's see how our international 
affairs are doing...

873
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:03,710
Compared to ``God'' I feel like 
a computer-loving little kid...

874
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:06,108
Noa, coulld you get 
me some coffee ?

875
01:02:06,108 --> 01:02:08,210
Oooooo, sounds good.
 I only have instant; sorry.

876
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,608
Sure thing.

877
01:02:20,608 --> 01:02:21,918
Noa,
 turn on the gas again !

878
01:02:21,918 --> 01:02:22,918
Huh ?!

879
01:02:22,918 --> 01:02:23,918
Just do it !

880
01:02:23,918 --> 01:02:25,818
What's this all about ?

881
01:02:29,418 --> 01:02:31,019
So what ?....

882
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:41,829
What the... ?

883
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:43,218
The resonance !

884
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:48,028
There was no point in simulating 
the components individually...

885
01:02:48,028 --> 01:02:50,218
...if objects vibrate at 
the same fixed frequency...

886
01:02:50,218 --> 01:02:54,218
...frequency they reinforce 
each other's vibrations !

887
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,938
Not much of a difference.

888
01:03:00,938 --> 01:03:04,838
The low frequency that initiates 
the first resonance is too weak.

889
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:07,938
It has to kick off with 
something more powerful !

890
01:03:07,938 --> 01:03:10,639
Blow-through structure buildings,
 the harp bridge...

891
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:12,539
...iron pipes in construction sites,
 air ducts for underground facilities...

892
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,539
There's gotta be 
something else...

893
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:20,048
Let's see...it should be located in some 
big open space...with no outer walls...

894
01:03:20,048 --> 01:03:22,449
...say some multi-level 
structure...

895
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:24,849
How could something like that 
exist in crowded Tokyo...!!

896
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,849
The Ark ?!

897
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:42,858
How could we have 
been so blind ?!

898
01:03:42,858 --> 01:03:45,759
I forgot that I made a copy 
at the Hachiouji factory...

899
01:03:45,759 --> 01:03:48,559
Put the Ark into the 
wind tunnel simulation...

900
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,159
...raise the windspeed parameter to infinity,
 and throw the lot into our first simulation...

901
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,059
Hang on ! This computer doesn't 
have the processing capacity.

902
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,759
Okay,
 we've got the Fridge online !

903
01:04:08,369 --> 01:04:10,068
The data's not coming back,
 is it ?

904
01:04:10,068 --> 01:04:11,769
Here it is !

905
01:04:18,269 --> 01:04:19,659
Wow....

906
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:23,068
What's the lowest wind velocity 
that can set off the reaction ?

907
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:26,468
...
40 m/second ?!!

908
01:04:26,468 --> 01:04:30,179
Damn...You only get that sort 
of wind when a Typhoon hits...

909
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:39,579
 ...and so this rather 
powerful Typhoon, #19,

910
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:41,480
 ...is now at the south 
west tip of Kei Peninsula...

911
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,179
 ...heading north east 
at a speed of 25 kmph.

912
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:47,878
 It will hit Tokyo 
early tomorrow morning.

913
01:04:47,878 --> 01:04:49,688
 The typhoon's air 
pressure is 950 bar...

914
01:04:49,688 --> 01:04:55,699
 ...and within 25 km of its center 
wind speeds are over 40 m/second...

915
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:58,588
That's it !
 We've heard enough !

916
01:04:58,588 --> 01:05:01,588
This is all just a theory !

917
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:05,099
And I heard that this 
simulation was programmed by...

918
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:08,188
...a suspended officer 
and the maintenance crew.

919
01:05:08,188 --> 01:05:12,599
Do you really expect us 
to take it seriously ?

920
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:14,699
According to the 
Meteorological Agency...

921
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:18,699
...Typhoon #19 will strike the 
city early the next morning.

922
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:21,398
We don't have time for 
additional testing of the program.

923
01:05:21,398 --> 01:05:24,099
You say it's only 
an unproven theory...

924
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:29,199
...but it's a fact that we have 
no evidence to deny it either.

925
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:33,398
When the Typhoon reaches Tokyo its heavy 
winds will cause the Ark to vibrate...

926
01:05:33,398 --> 01:05:37,409
That will stimulate the low-frequency howling 
of the numerous high-rises at the water front,

927
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:39,409
...which will itself induce the whirring 
of the buildings in downtown Tokyo.

928
01:05:39,409 --> 01:05:42,608
And 8000 Labors situated all over the 
metropolis will become runaways....

929
01:05:42,608 --> 01:05:46,710
What will result 
need not be mentioned.

930
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:51,009
Labors aren't just located in the 
redevelopments around the bay, but also...

931
01:05:51,009 --> 01:05:54,909
...in the city center, and in the Geo-front 
construction site 100 meters underground.

932
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:58,218
Also Labors are operating 
inside some nuclear reactors.

933
01:05:58,218 --> 01:06:01,318
If the simulation 
results become reality...

934
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:04,818
...I'd like to know who 
would take responsibility...

935
01:06:04,818 --> 01:06:09,019
...and how, for not preventing 
the crime beforehand.

936
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:11,608
Goto.

937
01:06:11,608 --> 01:06:15,818
The city-wide OS rewite 
has been completed.

938
01:06:15,818 --> 01:06:23,528
Even if Eiichi Hoba's crime existed,
 it is now quite irrelevent, don't you think ?

939
01:06:23,528 --> 01:06:27,429
HOS is still being analyzed,
 with the assisstance of MIT...

940
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:32,028
...but it's true nature has 
not yet been determined.

941
01:06:32,028 --> 01:06:35,028
The experts agree that it may still 
be hiding in the Labors' memories...

942
01:06:35,028 --> 01:06:38,528
...in that case it is reasonable 
to assume that any Labors...

943
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:41,639
...that came in contact with 
HOS are still contaminated.

944
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:43,639
Wait for the Typhoon to hit ?

945
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:48,039
Chop down the high-rises ?
 Dismantle all 8000 Labors ?

946
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:49,539
Or...

947
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,539
You have only four choices.

948
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:54,639
Your decision please.

949
01:06:55,739 --> 01:06:59,438
From early tomorrow until 
the typhoon has passed...

950
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:02,438
...activation of all Labors within 
city limits will be prohibited.

951
01:07:02,438 --> 01:07:06,349
Labor production lines and repair 
facilities will be shut down.

952
01:07:06,349 --> 01:07:10,750
We will request aid from the fire 
department and the defence ministry...

953
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,949
...as well as 
neighboring prefectures.

954
01:07:12,949 --> 01:07:13,949
That is all.

955
01:07:15,548 --> 01:07:19,750
Chief, there's a possibility that deactivated 
Labors may start up by themselves...

956
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,750
...due to the effects of 
the low frequency noise.

957
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:25,159
Did you forget about the episode 
with the JSDF prototype Labor...

958
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:26,159
Goto !

959
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:27,259
What was that ?

960
01:07:27,259 --> 01:07:31,648
 I never received such a report.

961
01:07:29,648 --> 01:07:31,648
 Then I have one more question.

962
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:34,349
Will you knock it off ?!

963
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:41,159
If it's caused by a Typhoon, I don't really 
see how anyone should be held responsible...

964
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:43,349
I mean it's done by a Typhoon...

965
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,369
Of course. If it's an act of God,
 it can't be helped...

966
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:50,659
Chief !!!

967
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:55,159
Assistant Inspector Goto,
 returning to the station.

968
01:07:56,659 --> 01:07:57,659
What did he mean ?

969
01:07:57,659 --> 01:08:01,159
As he said, it can't be 
helped if it's an act of God.

970
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:04,659
Afterwards, if Hoba's 
crime can be proven, fine.

971
01:08:04,659 --> 01:08:08,159
If not, let it go as 
the Typhoon's fault.

972
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:12,579
If the cat gets let out of the bag,
 the Captain'll take the fall.

973
01:08:12,579 --> 01:08:14,369
The old snake.

974
01:08:14,369 --> 01:08:15,679
Poor Captain...

975
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:17,778
We're the poor ones.

976
01:08:17,778 --> 01:08:20,979
If Hoba's crime can't be proved,
 we'll be criminals.

977
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:22,778
Want out ?

978
01:08:22,778 --> 01:08:26,880
No. If I'm gonna regret it anyway,
 better something done than left undone.

979
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,880
Well then.

980
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:34,688
No turning back now.

981
01:08:34,688 --> 01:08:36,789
I won't be back for awhile.
 Follow Shinobu's orders until then will you ?

982
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:38,789
Roger !

983
01:08:39,988 --> 01:08:42,688
What's gonna happen ?

984
01:08:42,688 --> 01:08:44,789
We're gonna destroy the Ark !

985
01:08:50,188 --> 01:08:53,789
After insulating the memory bank and the cockpit,
 get on with the water-proofing.

986
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:55,000
We don't have much time !

987
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,199
Boss !
 The floats are here !

988
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:01,199
Okay, let group 3 handle it ! As the crews 
finish their current jobs I'll send them down !

989
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:04,699
I got the okay !
 Bring out the riot gun too !

990
01:09:04,699 --> 01:09:07,000
We got the experimental 
explosive shells, right ?!

991
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,398
Load 'em into cartridges !

992
01:09:09,398 --> 01:09:11,699
What ?
 But that's too risky...

993
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:13,099
DO IT !!!

994
01:09:13,099 --> 01:09:14,898
 Typhoon #19 is 
continuing on course.

995
01:09:14,898 --> 01:09:20,309
 It is still heading north east,
 and will hit the Kanto area in...

996
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:23,010
YES ! THE STORM IS COMING !
 THE STORM IS COMING !

997
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:29,809
We'll have to purge the platforms with 
the emergency fire systems after all...

998
01:09:29,809 --> 01:09:33,608
Then the occupation of the 
control center is the key...

999
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:35,510
Give me the file on 
the security robots...

1000
01:09:55,608 --> 01:10:00,608
Labors are set up...Attaching the floats to 
the trailers'll be done in a couple hours...

1001
01:10:00,608 --> 01:10:03,829
By the way, how did you get hold 
of that monster anti-Labor rifle ?

1002
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:06,929
I begged for one from the 
paratroop unit in Kasumigaura.

1003
01:10:06,929 --> 01:10:12,000
When I mentioned the prototype Labor 
incident they rented me one immediately.

1004
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I'm going over to 
Narita airport now.

1005
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,220
We may have to fight every Labor on 
the Ark so I called in a secret weapon.

1006
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:20,528
Yes,
 I mean HER.

1007
01:10:30,938 --> 01:10:32,639
``Sight seeing ?''

1008
01:10:32,639 --> 01:10:34,539
``No...''

1009
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:37,938
``Combat.''

1010
01:10:54,648 --> 01:10:56,148
Let the air in !

1011
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,750
There's nothing 
more for me to say.

1012
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:11,648
The Ark should be totally empty 
after the evacuation order...

1013
01:11:11,648 --> 01:11:13,349
...so fight as 
much as you like !

1014
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:34,769
ALRIGHT !
 GIVE IT ALL YOU'VE GOT !

1015
01:11:45,269 --> 01:11:48,769
Are you sure ?
 You can still call them back !

1016
01:11:48,769 --> 01:11:52,769
What if the operation is successful but 
you still can't prove Hoba's crime ?

1017
01:11:52,769 --> 01:11:55,278
Then we're criminals.

1018
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:59,979
But if we don't do anything,
 and there's a disaster ?

1019
01:11:59,979 --> 01:12:01,579
Then we're criminals again.

1020
01:12:01,579 --> 01:12:02,679
Which do you prefer ?

1021
01:12:04,369 --> 01:12:09,179
And besides,
 there was no choice to begin with.

1022
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:15,988
If they fail,
 the bay area will be devastated.

1023
01:12:15,988 --> 01:12:22,289
If they succeed, then project Babylon 
will be crippled by the loss of the Ark.

1024
01:12:22,289 --> 01:12:25,289
Either way we lose.

1025
01:12:25,289 --> 01:12:30,688
Probably the real fight 
ended when Hoba jumped.

1026
01:12:30,688 --> 01:12:32,188
Don't you agree ?

1027
01:12:32,188 --> 01:12:33,889
And you still want to do this ?

1028
01:12:33,889 --> 01:12:36,188
You really don't have the right 
character to be in the police...

1029
01:12:36,188 --> 01:12:39,398
I really feel sorry that you always end 
up getting the short end of the stick.

1030
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:41,300
Where are you going ?

1031
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,599
We did get silent approval 
from headquarters...

1032
01:12:43,599 --> 01:12:46,898
...but if they raise 
hell on the Ark...

1033
01:12:46,898 --> 01:12:51,199
...the Maritime Safety Agency and the 
Ports and Harbors Bureau won't keep quiet.

1034
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,599
I'll go over there 
and buy some time.

1035
01:12:54,599 --> 01:12:57,300
This's a job for the chief.

1036
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,099
Goto...

1037
01:12:58,099 --> 01:12:59,099
Yes ?

1038
01:12:59,099 --> 01:13:00,809
...No,
 nothing...

1039
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,010
Then, please take care of 
the rescue arrangements.

1040
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:24,220
There it is !
 500 meters ahead !

1041
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,420
The Ark !

1042
01:14:06,099 --> 01:14:08,539
Doesn't the 
atmosphere feel Evil ?

1043
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:11,438
Just like a shrine of Idols.

1044
01:14:11,438 --> 01:14:14,639
An appropriate grave for a man 
who assumed the name of the Lord.

1045
01:14:14,639 --> 01:14:18,639
Listen, as long as they don't get too close,
 guard robots aren't much of a concern.

1046
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:24,139
But there's far too many of them,
 so avoid combat as much as possible !

1047
01:14:24,139 --> 01:14:27,938
Ohta, take the point !
 Noa, bring up the rear !

1048
01:14:27,938 --> 01:14:29,648
We'll run all the way !

1049
01:14:29,648 --> 01:14:31,648
CHAAAAAARGE !!!

1050
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,449
Come on you worthless 
hunks of junk !

1051
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:43,050
I'll rip you apart !

1052
01:15:09,349 --> 01:15:11,159
Five to the rear...

1053
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:14,159
Eight...
They keep coming !

1054
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:19,470
Wait up !

1055
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:20,769
Move it !

1056
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:30,568
I told you to avoid combat !

1057
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:33,970
We did,
 as much as possible.

1058
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,858
Quick response based 
on the situation !

1059
01:15:35,858 --> 01:15:39,479
The situation is 
changing all the time !

1060
01:15:39,479 --> 01:15:41,369
At any rate,
 conserve ammo !

1061
01:15:41,369 --> 01:15:43,369
We don't know what's up there !

1062
01:15:43,369 --> 01:15:44,778
Roger !

1063
01:16:04,988 --> 01:16:06,289
There it is !

1064
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:18,488
Move it !

1065
01:16:18,488 --> 01:16:21,199
He's so rough,
 dammit...

1066
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:24,300
If we don't hurry this place is gonna 
be flooded with security robots !

1067
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,398
Start up the 
emergency routines !

1068
01:16:26,398 --> 01:16:28,699
That'll shut off the 
security automatically !

1069
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,099
Okay,
 here we go...

1070
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,800
This will've sounded 
the alarm back on land.

1071
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,898
Well then let's see if we'll 
be dangerous criminals...

1072
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:45,710
...or heroes by the time the 
Maritime Safety people get here.

1073
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,210
We have until the 
weather clears.

1074
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:53,409
Can you hear me ?
 I've deactivated the security systems.

1075
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:54,608
 Roger !

1076
01:16:54,608 --> 01:16:56,210
 Will stand guard !

1077
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:00,309
Okay,
 let's take this thing apart !

1078
01:17:01,309 --> 01:17:02,108
W...wait !

1079
01:17:02,108 --> 01:17:02,608
What ?

1080
01:17:02,608 --> 01:17:04,108
A person !

1081
01:17:04,108 --> 01:17:06,608
There's somebody in 
subcontrol on the top level !

1082
01:17:06,608 --> 01:17:07,519
WHAT ?!

1083
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,608
It's no mistake.

1084
01:17:11,608 --> 01:17:13,119
See ?
 It's moving...

1085
01:17:20,608 --> 01:17:23,519
It can't be...

1086
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:26,119
But he's supposed to be dead,
 isn't he ?

1087
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:27,729
Hoba's ghost ?!

1088
01:17:27,729 --> 01:17:31,220
Or some sort of trap. Can you get me 
into communication with the subcontrol ?

1089
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:35,130
Can't.
 The subcontrol isn't in use...

1090
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:36,929
It has to be powered 
up from there.

1091
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:38,829
Someone has to 
go up and check...

1092
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:40,429
But the time !

1093
01:17:40,429 --> 01:17:43,028
The Typhoon's about to hit !

1094
01:17:50,028 --> 01:17:51,840
 Noa !
 Listen up !

1095
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,938
What is it ?

1096
01:17:52,938 --> 01:17:54,229
 We've got a problem.

1097
01:17:54,229 --> 01:17:57,229
 There's a possibility that someone's still here,
 in the top floor subcontrol.

1098
01:17:57,229 --> 01:18:01,340
 A file cross-check 
says it's Eiichi Hoba.

1099
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:03,438
 It's a trap for sure !

1100
01:18:03,438 --> 01:18:05,738
 But somebody's still up there.

1101
01:18:05,738 --> 01:18:07,438
 Noa,
 will you go ?

1102
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:09,139
Why Me ?!

1103
01:18:09,139 --> 01:18:10,539
 It's too dangerous 
without a Labor...

1104
01:18:10,539 --> 01:18:12,449
 ...and DELICATE 
decision-making might be needed.

1105
01:18:12,449 --> 01:18:13,750
 Ohta CAN'T handle it !

1106
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,349
 WHAT ?!

1107
01:18:15,349 --> 01:18:16,349
 Go !

1108
01:18:16,349 --> 01:18:18,148
 I'll support you from here...

1109
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:25,349
Forward and backup are 
two-in-one, right ?

1110
01:18:25,349 --> 01:18:26,449
And one more thing !

1111
01:18:26,449 --> 01:18:29,349
We don't have much time, so we'll proceed 
with the original plan at the same time !

1112
01:18:29,349 --> 01:18:30,648
 WHAT ?!

1113
01:18:38,648 --> 01:18:40,559
I heard HOS's true 
nature was confirmed.

1114
01:18:40,559 --> 01:18:43,159
Oh,
 Chief Nagumo...

1115
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:49,349
Yeah, we got a call from MIT saying 
that they'd finally dissected the file.

1116
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:51,760
 So what's the verdict ?

1117
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:51,760
 We hit the jackpot.

1118
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,349
A virus was planted in HOS.

1119
01:18:54,349 --> 01:18:57,858
It invades the backup 
memory to start off...

1120
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:02,769
...then it changes its name and gets 
into every available space possible.

1121
01:19:02,769 --> 01:19:07,568
There's no doubt that any computer that comes 
in contact with HOS will be contaminated.

1122
01:19:07,568 --> 01:19:10,068
By morning there's gonna 
be one hell of a mess...

1123
01:19:10,068 --> 01:19:15,068
MIT has already started programming a vaccine,
 but I wonder if it'll do the trick...

1124
01:19:15,068 --> 01:19:19,079
If only we'd known this half a day earlier,
 they wouldn't have had to go by themselves...

1125
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:21,880
We can't even send 
in reinforcements...

1126
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,479
But this did prove 
Goto's theory...

1127
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:27,479
At least now we can 
arrange the rescue.

1128
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:29,278
Wait a sec !

1129
01:19:29,278 --> 01:19:32,679
You said HOS or any computers that 
came in contact with it, right ?

1130
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:37,699
What about the Ark's main computer?
 They're using it for the purge !!

1131
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:47,988
 D level, block 5,
 30 seconds until purge.

1132
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:57,099
 All personnel working in this 
block evacuate immediately.

1133
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,099
D-5 block is purged.
 Alphonse is moving from D-7 to 9.

1134
01:20:15,099 --> 01:20:17,699
Get ready for the next one.
 Code for D-7 ?

1135
01:20:17,699 --> 01:20:20,300
FPD-00207.

1136
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,699
Why can't we wait until she goes up to the next level,
 and then drop the entire floor ?

1137
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:29,210
If the Ark loses too much weight at 
once it'll become dangerously unstable.

1138
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:35,210
It's ok. If we drop the open blocks first,
 it should eliminate much of the resonance effect.

1139
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,608
What's it like outside ?

1140
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:39,309
Wind velocity 35...

1141
01:20:39,309 --> 01:20:41,108
...
now it's up to 36 !

1142
01:20:41,108 --> 01:20:42,809
D-7,
 here we go !

1143
01:20:42,809 --> 01:20:47,909
 D level,
 block 7 is purged.

1144
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:49,229
Next !
 Code for E-2 !

1145
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,539
As...Asuma !
 Look !

1146
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:56,349
Blocks 3, 5 and 7 of D level,
 and all of C level !

1147
01:21:56,349 --> 01:21:59,449
They're flooded 
with runaway Labors !

1148
01:21:59,449 --> 01:22:00,550
What ?!

1149
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:02,949
But the wind isn't over 
40m per second yet !

1150
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:05,050
Either the simulation 
overlooked something...

1151
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:08,449
...or the purging has 
worsened the effect !

1152
01:22:10,449 --> 01:22:15,050
Come on, you scrapheaps !
 I'll waste all of you !

1153
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,050
 Hiromi !
 What's going on ?!

1154
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:19,159
Runaway Labors are piling up 
at the other end of the bridge.

1155
01:22:19,159 --> 01:22:21,559
Ohta charged in just now.

1156
01:22:21,559 --> 01:22:22,648
What about Kanuka ?!

1157
01:22:22,648 --> 01:22:25,159
She left. She said she was 
gonna look for a weapon.

1158
01:22:25,159 --> 01:22:26,349
What do we do ?

1159
01:22:26,349 --> 01:22:30,349
Could it be that she's...

1160
01:22:39,559 --> 01:22:41,568
 Kanuka, don't !
 The Type-0 is too risky !

1161
01:22:41,568 --> 01:22:44,159
Don't worry, I'm using a system disk 
where the virus has been isolated.

1162
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,068
Assuming all goes well I 
should be able to control it.

1163
01:22:47,068 --> 01:22:48,769
 But what if the virus 
has hidden somewhere...

1164
01:22:48,769 --> 01:22:51,159
Then this Labor will be a 
threat whether I use it or not !

1165
01:22:51,159 --> 01:22:54,369
Besides, Ohta won't be able to 
hold them all off on his own.

1166
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,369
I'm willing to take the gamble.
 Clancy out !

1167
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:17,579
 Noa ! Can you hear me ?!
 The situation's changed !

1168
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:20,579
 The runaways have started 
earlier than estimated !

1169
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,778
 We don't have much time left,
 so proceed at full speed !

1170
01:23:22,778 --> 01:23:23,579
 That's all !

1171
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:25,188
Thanks for telling me...

1172
01:24:53,608 --> 01:24:54,630
Birds ?

1173
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:24,340
The wind velocity outside 
is now over 40m per second !

1174
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:25,438
We can't wait any longer !

1175
01:25:25,438 --> 01:25:27,738
Noa ! Answer me !
 Noa !

1176
01:25:27,738 --> 01:25:30,639
 The ID's around 
a raven's leg...

1177
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,639
Just report your conclusions !

1178
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:34,039
Is there anybody up there ?!

1179
01:25:34,039 --> 01:25:37,840
 No !
 Nobody's here !

1180
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:46,949
It's not accepting any input...

1181
01:25:46,949 --> 01:25:50,148
The main computer was 
contaminated too ?!

1182
01:25:50,148 --> 01:25:54,648
 Control room,
 please respond !

1183
01:25:54,648 --> 01:25:57,148
 Runaway Labors are increasing !

1184
01:25:57,148 --> 01:25:59,250
There's so many of them...

1185
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:01,760
I can't hold them off if they 
start crossing the bridge !

1186
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,648
Please hurry up 
with that purge !

1187
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,559
 There's gotta be something...

1188
01:26:09,559 --> 01:26:11,559
 ...some way...

1189
01:26:14,858 --> 01:26:16,648
There should be a backup 
manual ignition system...

1190
01:26:16,648 --> 01:26:21,760
...something that blows away all the 
block joints without the computer relay !

1191
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,970
But how do we get to the ignition 
point while we're stuck in this mess ?!

1192
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,269
Just deal with it !

1193
01:26:34,269 --> 01:26:38,659
The top level of the main shaft,
 right under subcontrol...

1194
01:26:38,659 --> 01:26:41,568
Good thing the police stress 
the value of human life.

1195
01:26:41,568 --> 01:26:44,159
Bingo,
 and just in time !

1196
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,880
It's right under Noa's feet !

1197
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:50,679
Take that !

1198
01:27:19,188 --> 01:27:20,590
The Type-0 ?!

1199
01:27:33,398 --> 01:27:34,398
My God...!

1200
01:27:44,599 --> 01:27:46,699
 Ohta !
 Kanuka !

1201
01:27:46,699 --> 01:27:49,099
 We're gonna start 
purging the entire floor !

1202
01:27:49,099 --> 01:27:50,898
 Get back to the 
command center !

1203
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:53,210
 Ohta !

1204
01:28:03,809 --> 01:28:07,809
 30 seconds after ignition,
 the entire floor should purge !

1205
01:28:07,809 --> 01:28:10,909
 I don't know what'll happen when the 
Ark loses that much weight at once !

1206
01:28:10,909 --> 01:28:14,409
 Listen Noa, don't move away from 
there after you ignite it, alright ?!

1207
01:28:17,318 --> 01:28:18,920
 Answer me Noa !

1208
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,220
Roger !

1209
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:24,318
Ignition !

1210
01:28:27,608 --> 01:28:29,119
Ignition confirmed !

1211
01:28:48,329 --> 01:28:50,528
Kanuka...

1212
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:11,488
Asuma !

1213
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,699
Shinshi !

1214
01:31:13,699 --> 01:31:15,000
Kanuka !

1215
01:31:16,699 --> 01:31:18,800
Hiromi !

1216
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,099
Ohta !

1217
01:31:23,699 --> 01:31:26,199
Somebody answer me !

1218
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:34,800
Ohta...!

1219
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:52,409
Ow...
Hell of an experie....

1220
01:32:00,318 --> 01:32:02,920
Noa, don't !
 Kanuka is aboard that thing !

1221
01:32:24,429 --> 01:32:27,028
Answer me Kanuka !

1222
01:32:29,028 --> 01:32:30,729
Get out of your 
vehicle and run Noa !

1223
01:32:30,729 --> 01:32:33,429
There's no way you can beat this 
thing in hand-to-hand combat !

1224
01:32:33,429 --> 01:32:35,130
 But can't you stop it ?!

1225
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:36,429
What about the 
activation disk ?!

1226
01:32:36,429 --> 01:32:39,130
I used it. AND reset the computer,
 and it's still moving !

1227
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:42,130
Probably the virus entered 
the S-RAM for pattern study,

1228
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:44,639
...and that must be 
adjusting the program !

1229
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:45,738
Where's the S-RAM ?!

1230
01:32:45,738 --> 01:32:48,539
Behind the neck,
 same as in the Type-98 !

1231
01:32:54,539 --> 01:32:55,438
Gotcha !

1232
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:13,550
Noa ! Run !
 You can't win with a Type-98 !

1233
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,079
DAMMIT !

1234
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,778
STOP !

1235
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:55,188
...I did it...

1236
01:34:56,699 --> 01:34:59,398
I did it...!
