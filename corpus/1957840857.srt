move back into town,

Bunyan competition!

The only joy she has in life

2088

you took the 40 minutes

2091

She has, like, two:

2094

isn't friendship.

Your memory's sick, bro!

2403
01:23:24,493 --> 01:23:25,627
- Please.

2404
01:23:25,628 --> 01:23:27,028
You used to play
that album so much,

2405
01:23:27,029 --> 01:23:28,797
you practically beat me
over the head with it.

2406
01:23:28,798 --> 01:23:32,100
[all laugh]
- 'Cause... 'cause you...

2407
01:23:32,101 --> 01:23:33,535
- Only figuratively, though.

2408
01:23:33,536 --> 01:23:35,103
- [laughs] Huh?

2409
01:23:35,104 --> 01:23:36,671
- Happy Halloween!

2410
01:23:36,672 --> 01:23:38,406
- Uh...

2411
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:42,077
- [deeply] The all-in-one
Theranos blood test.

2412
01:23:42,078 --> 01:23:44,079
[normally] But in all
seriousness, you guys,

2413
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,449
I actually do have
some pretty big news.

2414
01:23:48,884 --> 01:23:51,052
- It's-a me, Mario!

2415
01:23:51,053 --> 01:23:52,587
What's wrong?

2416
01:23:52,588 --> 01:23:53,889
<i>Her cousin?</i>

2417
01:23:56,092 --> 01:24:00,362
Jesus. Really?

2418
01:24:00,363 --> 01:24:03,099
Well, who knows?

2419
01:24:03,933 --> 01:24:06,334
Maybe he deserved it.

2420
01:24:06,335 --> 01:24:08,336
- Wait, what?

2421
01:24:08,337 --> 01:24:11,439
You're not supposed to say that.

2422
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,308
Are you on Raya?

2423
01:24:13,309 --> 01:24:14,309
- Uh...

2424
01:24:15,711 --> 01:24:17,712
Whoa, whoa, whoa, babe!

2425
01:24:17,713 --> 01:24:20,015
Don't get all psycho.

2426
01:24:20,016 --> 01:24:21,449
- Have fun with
Candace, shithead.

2427
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:23,118
She's, like, 18

2428
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:25,053
and is gonna leave your
ass for an MMA fighter.

2429
01:24:25,054 --> 01:24:27,856
Oh, and by the way,
I got that job,

2430
01:24:27,857 --> 01:24:29,257
and it pays great,

2431
01:24:29,258 --> 01:24:31,559
so when I move back
to LA without you,

2432
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,095
I'm not gonna have to live
in a rickety-ass shack.

2433
01:24:34,096 --> 01:24:36,098
Bye, Brooklyn!

2434
01:24:38,668 --> 01:24:41,670
- So her name's Claire,
and she's a doctor.

2435
01:24:41,671 --> 01:24:43,571
- Ooh!
- Ooh, Claire!

2436
01:24:43,572 --> 01:24:44,639
- Dr. Claire.

2437
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,007
- It's only been our first sesh,

2438
01:24:46,008 --> 01:24:49,411
but I gotta tell you
guys, Talkspace nailed it.

2439
01:24:49,412 --> 01:24:52,280
She, uh, said I have
some pretty severe issues

2440
01:24:52,281 --> 01:24:54,049
and I'm pretty
mentally disturbed,

2441
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,784
so... she gets me.

2442
01:24:55,785 --> 01:24:57,952
- [laughs]
- Wow.

2443
01:24:57,953 --> 01:25:00,321
Look at you,
working on yourself.

2444
01:25:00,322 --> 01:25:02,891
- Thank you.
- Where can I find a guy like...

2445
01:25:02,892 --> 01:25:04,025
That does that?

2446
01:25:04,026 --> 01:25:05,226
- Listen, it takes time.

2447
01:25:05,227 --> 01:25:06,628
The dudes will come.

2448
01:25:06,629 --> 01:25:09,197
Listen, my dude went a
little cuckoo last night,

2449
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:11,332
but I'm not worried.
Okay, watch this.

2450
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:13,368
Hey, Joey Fatone,
send me a dick pic.

2451
01:25:13,369 --> 01:25:15,136
- Mm.
[message whoosh]

2452
01:25:15,137 --> 01:25:16,971
- Ooh, instantaneous.

2453
01:25:16,972 --> 01:25:18,239
Ooh!
- And huge.

2454
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,808
- Oh, yes.
- Can I see?

2455
01:25:19,809 --> 01:25:21,609
Can I see? Can I see?

2456
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:23,078
- God did spend a
little more time on him.

2457
01:25:23,079 --> 01:25:24,479
Ooh!
- Oh, my God.

2458
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,581
All: Hey!

2459
01:25:26,582 --> 01:25:27,982
- Which house do you
wanna go to next?

2460
01:25:27,983 --> 01:25:30,186
- That one!
- Yes!

2461
01:25:34,023 --> 01:25:35,824
- Trick or treat!

2462
01:25:35,825 --> 01:25:37,959
- Oh, hey.
- Here you go.

2463
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,794
- Thanks.
- Wait.

2464
01:25:39,795 --> 01:25:41,963
Is that...
- Wow.

2465
01:25:41,964 --> 01:25:43,698
A full-size candy bar.

2466
01:25:43,699 --> 01:25:46,668
I knew this place was cool.

2467
01:25:46,669 --> 01:25:47,936
- Hon.
- Yeah.

2468
01:25:47,937 --> 01:25:49,972
Hey.

2469
01:25:53,743 --> 01:25:55,110
- Are those randoms,
or do we know them?

2470
01:25:55,111 --> 01:25:56,644
- I don't know.

2471
01:25:56,645 --> 01:25:58,913
Oh, they were out of blood,
so I just got us red.

2472
01:25:58,914 --> 01:26:00,148
- Good idea.

2473
01:26:00,149 --> 01:26:01,549
- I gotta get more candy.

2474
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:02,851
- Well, go get it, girl!

2475
01:26:02,852 --> 01:26:04,285
- Okay, I'm off. Wish me luck.

2476
01:26:04,286 --> 01:26:05,487
- You don't need luck.

2477
01:26:05,488 --> 01:26:07,288
I rubbed my romance
stone before I left.

2478
01:26:07,289 --> 01:26:08,490
- Oh, no, is that...
- Yes, that is what

2479
01:26:08,491 --> 01:26:10,558
I call my vagina.
- Yeah, no, I figured.

2480
01:26:10,559 --> 01:26:13,094
- Yeah.
- Well, thanks, Mikayla.

2481
