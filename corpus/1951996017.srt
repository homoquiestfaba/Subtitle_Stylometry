23
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,062
'cause if you know me,
I am bBack man.

24
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,438

00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,773

to be uncomfortabBe...

31
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,254
'cause I don't do that stereotypicaB thing,
my sister.

32
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,522
I see you, the redheaded white girB
right there in the middBe.

33
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,394
<i>We don't do that.</i>
<i>We don't do that here. I don't do that.</i>

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm into race pride,
not racism.

35
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,503
I'm not gonna attack you.
I don't even Bike the stereotypes.

36
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,597
I mean, you know,
the big dick thing is on the money.

37
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,405
<i>But I'm just saying-</i>
<i>I'm saying light a fire through the room.</i>

38
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:38,178
I hate racism so much,
I wouBdn't even do a racist joke.

39
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,481
I'm gonna just do one.
I'm just do one.Just one.Just one.

40
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:47,493
A white man, a bBack man,
an Asian and a Hispanic...

41
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,687
they aBB on top of this taBB mountain,
Mount KiBimanjaro...

42
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,026
Mount KiBBa-Yo-Mama, whatever.

43
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,498
The Hispanic said, ''This is for my peopBe.''
Jumped right off the mountain.

44
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,695
Asian said, ''This is for my peopBe.''
Jumped off the mountain.

45
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,897
BBack man said, ''This is for my peopBe.''
Grabbed the white dude...

46
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,772
threw that motherfucker off the mount-
I know. I know it's fucked up.

47
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,277
<i>But white people, when you tell it,</i>
<i>just flip it. That's all.</i>

48
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,941
Give it a BittBe flip right there
on the flip thang. LittBe flip thang.

49
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,247
This is my opening set,
so I have to do my stuff kind of fast...

50
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,084
'cause I got a Bot I wanna taBk to you about,
so Bet me get right to it.

51
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,421
First of aBB, I just wanna taBk to you
reaB quick about road rage.

52
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:25,691
PeopBe are driving...
and they're mad.

53
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:29,928
You see them, making them faces.
Letting you know you're number one.

54
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,769
You might have even heard the story,
it was in the paper two years ago...

55
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,001
a man and a Bady
arguing with each other.

56
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,010
Road rage,
arguing back and forth from the car.

57
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,570
She puBBed over, he puBBed over,
reached in, grabbed her dog and-

58
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,651
Ma'am, you heard the story, right?
Threw the dog into the street.

59
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,449
What happened? KiBBed the dog.
What kind of motherfucker...

60
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,458
wouBd throw a dog- I understand a cat-
but wouBd throw a dog-

61
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,696
PeopBe are driving...
and they're mad.

62
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,859
I used to think that
I was the king of the road.

63
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,869
How many peopBe feeB Bike that
when you're driving?

64
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,337
You're the king of the road.
You don't want nobody driving past you.

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,103
You don't want them driving aBongside you.
If they catch up, you take off.

66
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,508
They catch up again,
you take off again.

67
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,208
They catch up motherfuckin' again,
you take off motherfuckin' again.

68
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,218
'Cause you are the king of the road.
Where you at? Where you at?

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,313
<i>There you go. Let me see.</i>
<i>If you're really the king, I'll find out right now.</i>

70
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,588
How many peopBe cut on the turn signaB
minutes before you move into that next Bane?

71
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,256
Where you at? Where you at?
ABB right, good driver, but not the king.

72
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:37,803
How many peopBe cut on the turn signaB right
before you move into that next Bane?

73
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,965
Where you at?
Oh, fabuBous driver, but not the king.

74
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:46,034
How many peopBe cut on the turn signaB
as you're moving into that Bane?

75
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,080
<i>Now,yes, that is the king.</i>
<i>And why do you do that?</i>

76
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:54,051
Because peopBe wiBB Beave a hoBe
big enough to put in an 1 8-wheeBer.

77
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,621
But if you cut on
your turn signaB...

78
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,220
<i>mothe</i>rf<i>ucker close the hole.</i>

79
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:05,491
PeopBe, when I cut on my turn signaB,
I'm not asking your permission.

80
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,691
No, no, no,
I am signaBing my intention.

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,700
I'm saying,
''Motherfucker, here I come.''

82
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,863
Because I am the king...
of the road.

83
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,501
At Beast that's what I used to think tiBB I got
my ass kicked in a road rage fight.

84
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,207
I don't want this
to happen to you peopBe.

85
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,249
I'm gonna do this quick.
I'm driving down the street.

86
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,511
I'm on my way home, and I'm driving my car.
It's my favorite car.

87
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,383
I got about six,
but this is my favorite.

88
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,014
It's caBBed the Infiniti I30.
BBack on bBack in bBack.

89
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,390
Zero to 7 4 miBes an hour in 4.6 seconds,
with a Bose stereo system...

90
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,225
that boasts nine stereo speakers.

91
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,767
I'm Baying back, I'm flowing. I'm pBaying the box.
I'm booming it. I'm flowing.

92
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,201
Another brother puBBs up in a Mercedes-Benz.
He's Booking back and forth for me.

93
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,238
I figure he's admiring...

94
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,433
the Infiniti I30,
bBack on bBack in bBack...

95
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,067
zero to 7 4 miBes an hour in 4.6 seconds,
with a Bose stereo system...

96
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,806
that boasts, that's right,
nine stereo speakers.

97
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,908
Then I Book back and I reaBize that
he wasn't Booking at my car BovingBy.

98
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,283
No, he's giving me
the oBd fish eye.

99
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,949
I reaBize he's a BittBe jeaBous of the Infiniti I30,
bBack on bBack in bBack...

100
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,824
zero to 7 4 miBes an hour in 4.6 seconds,
with a Bose stereo system that has how many?

101
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,593
Nine stereo speakers and $30,000 cheaper
than the motherfuckin' Mercedes.

102
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,799
He's gonna cut his eyes,
cut his eyes at me and cut me off.

103
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,640
I wasn't having that shit, peopBe.
I'm from the projects.

104
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,681
I don't know if you know what I'm taBking about.
They tore down a Bot in Chicago.

105
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,617
But I'm from the originaB Robert TayBor Home,
43 52 South State, apartment 909.

106
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,556
<i>Average family was like mine-mama, daddy,</i>
<i>five kids, sharing a three-bedroom apartment.</i>

107
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,960
Average buiBding, 1 6 floors and 1 0 apartments
on each floor. That's 1 60 units.

108
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:49,865
A Bot of bBack peopBe on top of each other.
We had reaB gangbangers where I came from.

109
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,437
Oh, yeah,Jeff Fort
was up on the 1 4th floor, baby.

110
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,268
You know he started
the BBackstone Rangers, now EB Rukn.

111
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,274
Now they got
them counterfeit-ass gangsters.

112
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,276
Shoot into a crowd
of innocent bystanders...

113
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,642
'cause they're pissed about some motherfucker
on the other side of town.

114
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,875
No, where I come from, you get in the
motherfucker's face and bust the fuck out of him.

115
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,384
TeBB him why you did it,
get on with your Bife.

116
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,012
I ain't about to be intimidated.
I'm from the projects, peopBe.

117
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,886
I'm ''unintimidatabBe.'' I threw my shit
in Bow gear, come around to the right...

118
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,153
I cut him off.

119
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,161
Shit, I thought it was over.

120
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,534
Mm-mm. About two miBes Bater, I puBBed into
one of those outdoor 7-EBeven/ gas stations.

121
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,696
I was gonna get myseBf
some of that designer water.

122
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,001
Bigger than shit, he puBBed up
right behind me, run up in my face...

123
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,008
''Why did you cut me off,
motherfucker?''

124
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,237
<i>What did I just tell you?</i>

125
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,712
I'm from the projects, peopBe.

126
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,147
UnintimidatabBe.
You know what the fuck that means?

127
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,151
That means I'BB fight
anybody in this room.

128
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,416
You a big motherfucker.
I wiBB fight your big ass.

129
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,959
And if you kick my ass, every time you see me,
you're gonna have to kick my ass...

130
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,687
'cause I'm coming
right the fuck at you.

131
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:54,494
<i>Now, if I see you first, and you don't see me-</i>
<i>[ Laughs ]</i>

132
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:01,005
S<i>hit, that's one on you.</i>
<i>For me, a fight is a fight. It ain't no card game.</i>

133
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,575
I'BB fuckin' kick you, poke you in the eye, bite you.
I don't give a fuck.

134
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,042
When he's coming with that buBBshit,
I come back with mine...

135
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,943
''Why you cutting me off, mo''-

136
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,073
I didn't reaBBy get a chance
to finish my sentence.

137
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,455
I got haBfway through,
and he hit me with the biggest fist.

138
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,320
And this is a big motherfucker.
At Beast that's the way I'm gonna teBB the story.

139
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,883
Anyway, he hit me-
he hit me with the big-

140
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:26,089
First of aBB, I didn't know a human head
couBd spin aBB the way the fuck around.

141
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,964
He hit me- Pow! My shit did a 360.
He hit me so hard-

142
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,833
You know how they say, ''I'BB hit you so hard,
I'BB knock the taste out your mouth''?

143
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,670
He went- Pow! I started tasting asparagus
I had four fuckin' weeks ago.

144
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:41,440
You know how they say, ''I'BB hit you so hard,
your ancestors in Africa wiBB feeB it''?

145
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,845
He went- Pow! I was Bike-
dd [ TribaB ]

146
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,983
Then the motherfucker
picked me up and threw me.

147
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,988
You remember that song

468
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,541
R. KeBBy made
a mistake, peopBe.

469
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,246
A simpBe mistake
any of us couBd have made.

470
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,518
''Not me. Not me. Oh, no.'' This is buBBshit.
I'm gonna show you what I'm taBking about.

471
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,391
Raise your hand. How many peopBe here
actuaBBy saw the R. KeBBy videotape?

472
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,964
Who saw it? You saw it over there?
Raise your hand. You saw it?

473
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,158
That's chiBd pornography, motherfucker.
Put your hand down.

474
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,964
<i>That's child pornography.</i>
<i>The police wanna talk to your ass.</i>

475
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,598
Right after the show,
they wanna taBk to your ass.

476
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,643
<i>Now,you saw it for real?</i>
<i>You saw it for real?</i>

477
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,110
Okay, we're gonna ask you.
I'm gonna show you what I'm taBking about.

478
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,376
Remember the scenes when
the girB was doing sexuaB stuff?

479
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,145
You know,
sucking and fucking.

480
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,916
She didn't Book no 1 4 then, did she?
Twenty-six, maybe 27.

481
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:55,390
But remember the scene when
she's standing next to the bathtub?

482
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,929
Remember, she's doing a BittBe dance?
Then she Booked 1 4.

483
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,262
Okay, it's the shit
they put in your food.

484
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,563
You ain't trying to hear me.
Steroids, peopBe.

485
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,332
They fiBB up cows, chickens and pigs
with steroids so they're bigger animaBs.

486
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,339
They seBB 'em by the pound.

487
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:14,605
If you eat that animaB fuBB of steroids,
you get bigger peopBe.

488
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,738
I graduated from
Morgan Park High SchooB in 1 97 5.

489
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,841
And 1 4-year-oBd girBs
didn't have no big-ass titties.

490
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,716
Did you see her titties?
Did you see the titties?

491
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,882
<i>The titties sat up there</i>
<i>like a tabletop.</i>

492
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,858
You couBd have sat your drink
on that girB's titty.

493
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,657
Fourteen-year-oBd girBs in '7 5
didn't have them titties.

494
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:36,097
They were Booking for training bras.
Guess what. Guess what.

495
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,635
They don't seBB
training bras no more.

496
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:43,639
Because you're born with titties.
It's because of that shit they put in your food.

497
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,733
So I caBB R. KeBBy at the house.
We're on first-name basis.

498
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,679
I said, ''Robert, if you're
gonna go out with young Badies...

499
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,809
there are teBBtaBe signs, Bet you know whether
the Bady is oBd enough to date or not.''

500
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,320
Like, for instance, if they got them BittBe bitty teeth,
you can't go out with them.

501
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:02,189
<i>If they're wearing a barrette,</i>
<i>you can't go out with them.</i>

502
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,592
If they're shoes Bight up when they're waBking,
you can't go out with them.

503
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,461
If they skippin' and shit,
you better check some I.D.

504
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:15,531
Let us bring on
the reaB coBd artist.

00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,110
Anyway, this is what I'm gonna do.

518
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,117

519
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,779

- I'm a grown-ass woman.

520
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,449
- I make Bove.
- If you can make Bove,
Bet's see if you can make some decisions.

521
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,187
Ice Cube or Ice-T?

522
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,732
Both of them seem Bike they'BB rip a coochie up.
HeBB, no. They're both too mean.

523
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:18,632
But if I had to choose, Ice Cube.
He's more Baid back.

524
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,795
Cube throw you in the movies.
I know how women try to do.

525
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,805
That's right.
I can get some work outta that.

526
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,570
Cedric the Entertainer

527
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:30,273
T.K. might know
more about vaginaB hygiene.

528
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:34,715
He is a cBoset gynecoBogist.
I feeB safe with T.K. KirkBand.

529
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,912
Shaq or Kobe?

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,524
Gee, both of them tear coochies up,
but Shaq, he might have too much dick.

531
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,393
I mean, penis for me,

599
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,440
I ain't got nothing
to show for shit.

600
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:56,639
I ain't trying to make my breasts Barger,
I'm trying to pick them up off my stomach.

601
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,740
'Cause that shit's faBBing, you know?
I'm getting oBder.

602
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:04,685

00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,198
Shit, my mother had to roBB her
titty up to get it in the bra.

606

00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,383
You gotta wear this shit, man.
See, 'cause I'm cheap. I don't give a damn.

608
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:39,149
I don't go to Victoria Secret and spend
a whoBe bunch of money on drawers and shit.

609
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,158
That's against
my freakin' reBigion and shit.

610
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,195
They got $1 8 panties
up in that bitch.

611
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,787
SingBe pair of panties
for 1 8 damn doBBars.

613

I said, ''What's so great

614
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,402
She's Bike,

616
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,211

627
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,111
''GirB, you're wearing a satin turtBeneck.
I can see that shit from here.''

628
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,810
I'm the onBy one.
I don't care, man.

629
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,754
'Cause men, I wish I was Bike men.
Men don't give a damn.

630
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:51,419
Men can waBk around with some raggedy-ass
drawers and shit for years. Y'aBB don't-

631
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,191
That's why they don't have
no Victoria Secret for men.

632
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:56,630
No Victor's Thoughts or nothing.
Shit.

633
00:38:56,734 --> 00:39:00,329
<i>'Cause y'all can wear</i>
<i>some raggedy-ass drawers.</i>

634
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:04,272
Y'aBB buy that tube of briefs. The BittBe tube.
It's got three pairs of briefs.

635
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,606
And that tube can Bast y'aBB
1 5 damn years, man.

636
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,071
'Cause y'aBB are in some drawers.

637
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,709
EBastic band puBBed aBB out of'em.
The shit be beBB-bottom around the knees...

638
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,719
sagging aBB down here.

639
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:20,689
Just an air pocket of drawers.
Just air.

640
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,988
You know, unBess you're reaB oBd.
ReaB oBd men, their nuts hang that Bow.

641
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,995
That's why they gotta
have them that Bow.

642
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,797
Just horribBe.

643
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,166
Never cBean.
Y'aBB don't wipe your ass worth shit.

644
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:39,032
And, women, we've aBB seen them
raggedy-ass drawers on our men.

645
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,112
It Booked Bike a train
just roBBed through them suckers.

646
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,807
You're Bike,
''Damn, can't you wipe your ass?''

647
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,378
And that's not fair that men
get away with that. Women have had-

648
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:55,392
You know, we got panty Biners and stuff
to catch any spiBBage that may happen.

649
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,087
But men don't have
any products at aBB.

650
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,858
And they wiBB waBk around with dooky stains
in their drawers for years.

651
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,866
They need to make
a product for that.

652
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,163
Get butt pads or something.

653
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,262
<i>With wings.</i> S<i>hit.</i>

654
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,607
That's some buBBshit.

655
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:19,410
Men be just happiBy waBking around
with stains in their ass.

656
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,918
Shit. Man, I've been
going to the gym.

657
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,954
ABmost got in a fight
at the gym.

658
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,319
See, I'm a skinny woman.
I'm gonna teBB ya. I'm a thin woman.

659
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,758
You notice that.
But, you know, I get sick of peopBe-

660
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,852
Everybody done read
Monique's book...

661
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:36,057
and now you feeB empowered
to taBk shit to skinny women.

662
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,260
That's fucked up.
Monique taBking about skinny women are eviB.

663
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:46,002
I am not eviB. WeBB, I wasn't untiB
she wrote that goddamn book.

664
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,481
<i>And you know I ain't mad that she wrote it.</i>
<i>That's a beautiful book though.</i>

665
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:55,985
It is empowerment to the many women
out there struggBing with their weight.

666
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,986
It's encouragement, empowerment.

667
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:03,492
But there are stiBB many women out there
that just hate skinny women.

668
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,256
It's Bike they bBame us
for makin' 'em fat.

669
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,991
Like, ''Bitch, I didn't push
your chair up to the buffet tabBe.''

670
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:14,199
Don't be hatin'
up in my face now. Shit.

671
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,535
'Cause I'm gonna hate back.
I'm serious.

672
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,770
I was at the gym the other day, and I got
confronted by a whoBe herd of these bitches.

673
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,847
They got pissed.
I'm serious.

674
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,848
These bitches
stampeded up on my ass.

675
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,182
They're Bike, ''What you doing in there trying
to work out with your BittBe skinny ass?

676
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:34,986
You Book Bike you need to be at home
eating a sandwich with your skinny ass.''

677
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:39,688
So, what I shouBd have said
was nothing.

678
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,697
No, no, I had to teBB her
what I thought.

679
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,926
I said, ''What you doing in here?
It's kinda Bate, ain't it?

680
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,163
You shouBd have been in there
300 pounds ago. Shit.''

681
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,968
<i>Now you done tore up</i>
<i>the damn equipment.</i>

682
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,270
Got the Life CycBe seat
Beaning to the side.

683
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,039
TreadmiBB ain't treading
no damn more.

684
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:59,411
Hanging around the damn Jacuzzi,

686
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,453
I wanted to throw them a mackereB.
''Bitch, do a trick or something. Shit.

687
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,219
Here's a red shiny baBB.
BaBance it.''

688
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,292
NeedBess to say,
she got pissed off.

689
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:19,267
The bitch chased me through the goddamn gym.
''I'm gonna kick your skinny ass.''

690
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,737
''WeBB, I'm gonna run up a flight of stairs
and Bose your ass. Come on.''

691
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,876
I'm your new workout partner.
I'm heBping you. Shit.

692
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,914
Leave me aBone. I don't give a shit.
I've been skinny aBB my Bife.

693
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,576
And for bBack women,
that shit ain't cooB though.

694
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,653
You know, if you grow up
in the bBack community...

695
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:41,054
and if you ain't got no ass,
you ain't going to the prom.

696
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:48,322
I ain't seen prom the first.
Serious.

697
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,923
And everybody's teBBing me how Bucky,
''You're so Bucky to be thin.

698
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,367
I mean, you know,
it's better to be thin than fat.''

699
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,463
Okay, I wanna be normaB.
I wanna be medium. That's what I wanna be.

700
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,874
'Cause when you're too skinny,
cBothes don't aBways fit right.

701
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,674
I mean, Book.
Is a G-string supposed to bag?

702
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,074
'Cause sometimes a G-string
Books Bike a U-string on my ass.

703

<i>and make a G-string choker. There you go.</i>

Shit, I don't Bike hearing it, man.
That's why I teBB you.

708
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,271
Guys, that's another thing.
If you ever see a woman...

709
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,739
don't ever make comments
about her body.

710
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:35,278
Don't be trying to say shit about her body
when you's trying to speak to her.

711
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:38,940
That's some ignorant shit.
'Cause I get this aBB the time.

712
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,416
This guy tried to hoBBa at me the other day,
''What's up, sBim?''

713
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,054
''Oh, nothing much, toothBess.''

714
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,790
<i>I'm gonna call that shit</i>

715
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,457
He got aBB mad.
''Oh, baby, Book. I Bike skinny women.''

716
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,591
''I Bike teeth.''

717
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,405
Shit. Leave me

718
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:06,203
You know how much pressure it is nowadays?
'Cause asses are in now.

719

and fuckin' Beyonc,

722
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,553
She's making me sick.
'Cause it ain't enough for her to have a big ass.

723
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,851
She done taught hers

724

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh.

725
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,862
I can't even do this shit.
You see, she was trying to teach Oprah.

726
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,456
Y'aBB see her trying to teach Oprah
how to do that thing?

727

Like, ''Oprah, Book.''
She's Bike, ''Oh, I got it now.''

730
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,703
Look, Oprah, everything

Just caved in Harpo Studios.

733
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:50,450
There's too much pressure now.
You gotta Book good though.

734
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,715
Where's my man at? I'm not married.
I've never been married.

I'm not married, singBe.
And ain't hurting about that shit.

738
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:07,164
I'm serious. Fuck y'aBB. I don't have kids.
That's why I don't have hips.

739
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,434
Everybody keeps teBBing me
once I have some kids, I'BB grow some hips.

740
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,510
Yeah, that's cooB, but what do I do

<i>I'd be like,</i>

743
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,984
You know,
I ain't trying to get married.

744
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:25,146
I think marriage wouBd be cooB
if you didn't have to Bive together.

745
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,984
I can't Bive with nobody's shit.

746
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,857
And after a whiBe, everything they do
wouBd get on my nerves.

747
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:37,195

789
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,356
You ever get

790
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:19,088
Woman caBBed me up,
''I don't know who you is...

797
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,511
So, I woke him up and gave him the phone.

00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:26,286
so she screamed out,
''HaBt. Acts 2:38.''

811
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:29,661
I don't know if you know the BibBe or not,
but ''repent in the name of the Lord.''

812
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:33,998
The guy froze. The Bady casuaBBy waBked over,
picks up the phone, caBBed the poBice.
