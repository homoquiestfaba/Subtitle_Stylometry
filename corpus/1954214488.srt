1
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,548
- Baby, I put it right over there.
- No, you did not.

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,015
Baby, ifs right there.

3
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,890
You know I take care of you.

4
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,526
- Yeah.
- I give you everything.

5
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,922
I'm okay.

6
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,095
I can do this.

7
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,995
I'm not scared.

8
00:00:58,926 --> 00:00:59,996
I can do this.

9
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,101
Ifs okay. I'm not scared.

10
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,263
I can do this.

11
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,401
I can do this.

12
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,411
I'm not scared.

13
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,042
I'm okay. I'm not scared.

14
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,112
I can do this.

15
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,016
I'm okay.

16
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,622
I'm okay. I'm okay.

17
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,953
Where you going, baby?

18
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,444
I'm at 14811 Jefferson.

19
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,751
I want to go to...

20
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,680
77 Oak Ridge Road

21
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,415
in Saddle Ridge, New Jersey.

22
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,320
Yeah, New Jersey.

23
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,808
Have you seen my daughter?

24
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,339
What you do to your hair, sweetie?

25
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,989
Agnes, open HP-

26
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,824
I ain't got time for your crap!

27
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,332
I'm getting out of here.

28
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,194
What?

29
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,563
I said I'm out.

30
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,069
You ain't going nowhere,
you little bitch!

31
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,968
Open up!

32
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,018
You going to Jersey?

33
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,693
You got the money?

34
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,661
Yeah.

35
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,034
- Slut!
- Back off the car!

36
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,041
You slut! You useless slut!

37
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,371
You owe me!

38
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,081
- Back off the cab!
- You ain't going nowhere!

39
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,580
You're going to give me my money,
you little bitch!

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,841
Honey?

41
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,544
I'm sorry, okay?

42
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,747
Mommy loves you, okay?

43
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,914
Back off the car!

44
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,618
You're nothing
but a dumb, useless whore!

45
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,895
You'll be back! You hear me?

46
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,234
You need me!

47
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,225
Where's the money?

48
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,589
Show it to me now.

49
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,094
That's not enough.

50
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,430
Get out of my cab.

51
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,428
Get out of the cab!

52
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,335
- No!
- Get out of the cab right now!

53
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:05,140
Get out of here,
you little piece of trash!

54
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,750
Back away from the house!

55
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,653
Get down on the ground.

56
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,121
Down!

57
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,829
- Get off me!
- Easy!

58
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,903
This is a girl, not a boy.

59
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,440
All right, let's get her up.

60
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,345
What is this?

61
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,013
Do you know the people
that live here?

62
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,321
What's going on?

63
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,263
We're sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Fitzpatrick,

64
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,629
but we received a call
from your housekeeper.

65
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,429
- Who the hell is that?
- We don't know.

66
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,628
We found this on her.

67
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,603
She says she knows you.

68
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,674
- She said she knows me?
- That's what she said.

69
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,832
- Where was she?
- In the back, trying to break in.

70
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,036
She was trying
to break into the house?

71
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,648
That's right.

72
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,306
Did you pat her down?
Did she say anything?

73
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,781
She has nothing on her.

74
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,045
Nothing else. No ID.

75
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,484
- Inside, guys.
- A police car.

76
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,317
I know.
Let's just go in the house.

77
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,788
- But who is it?
- I don't know.

78
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,154
Show me.

79
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,191
Do you know her?

80
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,002
YES-.

81
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,474
Let her out.

82
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,180
Come on.

83
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,251
How old are you now? Fourteen?

84
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,356
Fifteen?

85
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,658
Sixteen.

86
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:22,998
It's a nice place.

87
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,710
You work
in real estate or something?

88
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,375
No. Wall Street.

89
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,756
Hows your mother, Agnes?

90
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,893
It's Apple,

91
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,958
remember?

92
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,969
You gave the name to me.

93
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,310
He re's what's up.

94
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,208
I need a place to stay
for a little bit.

95
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,472
That's why I'm here.

96
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,281
I ain't asking you to feel guilty
and stuff like that,

97
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,747
so let's not even go there.

98
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,048
I just need a place to stay
for a little bit.

99
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,812
I'll get a job.

100
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:13,980
I'll get my own place,

101
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,455
and then I'll be gone.

102
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,661
Here.

103
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,674
I knew I couldn't count on you.

104
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,807
Have a nice life.
Nice to finally meet you.

105
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,647
Wait. Where you going?

106
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,251
You just showed up.

107
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,151
The police said you tried
to break in.

108
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,020
I didn't try and break in.
They're lying.

109
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,620
Maybe there's something
we can work out.

110
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,264
I'm going to have a word
with my wife.

111
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,832
Were you in jail?

112
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,369
No, Dusty, she wasn't in jail.

113
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,736
Ifs just a misunderstanding.

114
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,172
We figured it out.

115
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,835
What kind of misunderstanding?

116
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,742
Alex, it's not a problem.

117
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,041
It's all better now.

118
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,245
Agnes, where are you from?

119
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,083
A lot of places.

120
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,689
And it's Apple, not Agnes.

121
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,924
You can call me Apple,
not Agnes.

122
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,336
I thought you said it was Agnes,

123
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,370
but Apple is a beautiful name.

124
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,540
Apple? That's a funny name.

125
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,699
And Alex is a boy's name.

126
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,710
No, it's not. Yours is stupid.

127
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,609
She smells,
and she's weird, Mom.

128
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,408
Why does she have to stay with us?

129
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,010
Tom?

130
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,421
All right, you guys,
time for bed.

131
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,956
Cece? Bath time.

132
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,927
Good night.

133
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,136
Honey, can you please wait?

134
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,705
I think now
would be a good time

135
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,035
for us to have a little talk together.

136
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,802
Why don't you stop calling me honey?

137
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,411
Hey, Apple.

138
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,237
You're in my house.

139
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,646
Look, we want to help you,

140
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,252
but we don't know how to.

141
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,322
We're going to have to get in touch
with your social worker

142
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,981
or someone assigned to your case

143
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,149
and let them know that you're here.

144
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,895
When I was eight,
I was taken away from my mother

145
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,593
when she was arrested for drugs.

146
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,270
I was dropped off
at a mental hospital,

147
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,104
where they kept me
in a steel room all by myself

148
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,246
because I didn't fit in
with the other kids.

149
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,179
From there, I was put
into another temporary shelter.

150
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,317
Apple.

151
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,478
Every few months, I'd be assigned
some new case worker,

152
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,783
and we'd start all over again-.

153
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,758
By the time I was twelve,
I was in my tenth foster home.

154
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,090
Seemed like good people
this time,

155
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:43,132
until the husband would come
into my room at night

156
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,031
and start touching me
and feeling all up on me.

157
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,970
I told my case worker,
and she got the police involved.

158
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,502
He told them
that I was making it all up,

159
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,143
because
that's what troubled kids do,

160
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,279
and they believed him.

161
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,847
I was too scared to even open up
my own mouth.

162
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,375
I ran away

163
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,611
and went to find my mother

164
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,482
and tried to stay
with her for a while.

165
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,856
Things got real bad,
and I had to go.

166
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,290
In all that time,

167
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:16,157
that letter was the only thing
I ever got from you,

168
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,696
I'm just asking you for a little time,

169
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:25,703
because I <i>am</i> done being passed off
as someone's case number.

170
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,742
I want out of the system!

171
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,349
So are you going to help me out

172
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,213
so I can get back on my feet?

173
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,020
Or do you and Joanna
still have to talk about it?

174
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,188
- You happy with this?
- Yeah.

175
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,133
You sleep all right?

176
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,500
You need some help there?

177
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,438
- No.
- You sure'?

178
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,445
Yeah, I'm fine just by myself.

179
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,946
Damn it!

180
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,193
Where you going?

181
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,393
Come here! Wait!

182
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,669
I'm talking to you!

183
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,462
Wait!

184
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,630
Where you going?

185
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,639
It was a stupid idea
for me to come here.

186
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,343
It's never going to work
between us!

187
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,708
Never!
So why don't you just turn around

188
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,543
and go back to your life.
And leave me and mine alone!

189
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,979
Where you going to go?

190
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,175
Look at you.

191
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,702
You don't even have your shoes on.

192
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,489
Who cares?

193
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,334
Here.

194
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,042
Come inside.

195
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,893
Are you pregnant?

196
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,622
What?

197
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,870
What are you talking about?

198
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,028
- What am I talking about?
- She's just not feeling well.

199
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,569
Why don't you let her answer that?

200
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,127
She's not going to answer anything.

201
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,467
I'm going to ask you again.

202
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,202
Are you pregnant?

203
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,278
- I knew it.
- You knew what?

204
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,079
I don't know.

205
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,312
See? She doesn't know anything.

206
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,751
- I know.
- You don't know.

207
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,789
- I know.
- Calm down, will you?

208
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,790
We are not having
this baby in our house.

209
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,121
What baby?

210
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:40,924
Where's the dad?

211
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,225
Is he in jail?

212
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,557
I don't know.

213
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,769
We only did it once-.

214
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,503
I need to talk
to you right now alone, please.

215
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,077
You want her in our life?

216
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,279
I don't know what you're thinking.

217
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,288
I will take care of it,
and we need to find...

218
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,757
I want her out!

219
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,033
Please, no-.

220
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,205
Come on, no.

221
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,187
We're here to check in.

222
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,588
Apple Bailey.

223
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,558
Thank you.

224
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:11,875
Hear that?

225
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,949
That's the heartbeat.

226
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,819
We almost done here?

227
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,050
Just a few more images.

228
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,464
Here you go. These are for you.

229
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,806
Good luck.

230
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,533
You see the woman I came in with?

231
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,030
Where have you been?

232
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,192
You're all wet.

233
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,804
Where you going?
Where were you'?

234
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,531
Wait!
Where did you disappear to?

235
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,074
I didn't disappear anywhere!

236
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,370
She left me there!

237
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,534
She left me!

238
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,408
Nobody left you anywhere! Stop!

239
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,707
I left you there?

240
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,179
You're a liar!

241
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,985
I waited for her.

242
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,052
She's trying to get in between us.

243
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,085
Do you see what I mean? A liar!

244
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,727
Cool it! Maybe you should
give us a minute... now!

245
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,191
Look at me.

246
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,428
Look at me!

247
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,416
Well, it's about time.

248
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,885
How are you feeling today?

249
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,918
Hungry'-

250
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,284
Shouldn't you be at work
or something?

251
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,019
I took the morning off.

252
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,755
I had a few things to do
with the construction,

253
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,594
and I wanted to check in with you.

254
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,928
I'm fine,
so I guess you can go.

255
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,596
You know...

256
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:54,539
today is an important day
for my firm,

257
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,875
and especially for me.

258
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,540
One of our biggest clients

259
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:02,276
asked to meet
with me personally to sign a deal.

260
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,542
Do you know why?

261
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,616
Mutual respect, trust,
and confidence.

262
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,220
This is what I've earned
from my peers.

263
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,556
Ifs taken me years to build this.

264
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,728
These are the same words
that I want to speak about with you.

265
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:21,931
Mutual respect,

266
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:26,133
such as I respect you,
you respect me.

267
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,811
That means
when I tell you something,

268
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,573
you stop ignoring me.

269
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,946
Trust, such as
when this conversation is over,

270
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,315
I'm going to leave here,
and I'm going to trust

271
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,118
that you are not going to get
into a street brawl with my wife.

272
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:44,951
And confidence.

273
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,491
These are the positive results
of our relationship

274
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,292
that can begin to happen

275
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,595
once the first two things
start to happen.

276
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,806
Joanna and I had
a long talk last night, and...

277
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,546
it's clear that you are not ready

278
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,445
to assume the responsibility
of motherhood.

279
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,846
Think about it.

280
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,649
You have no means of support

281
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,290
you have nowhere to live,

282
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:20,053
and you have no one
willing to help you except me.

283
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,833
It's time
that you turn the page on this.

284
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,202
Put it all behind you

285
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,042
so that you can move forward.

286
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,212
Just turn the page,

287
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,351
and before you know it,

288
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,588
you'll have forgotten
that it ever happened.

289
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,229
Just turn the page.

290
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,489
YES-.

291
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,697
And forget about it.

292
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:58,994
That's right.

293
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,734
Like you did with me.

294
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,104
Thank you, Cece.

295
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,025
I know that you must hate me,

296
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,033
and I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

297
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,432
about the misunderstandings.

298
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,277
No one's perfect, right?

299
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,945
How did your talk go
with your father?

300
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,216
Did he tell you?

301
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,452
Tell me what?

302
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,060
I made an appointment
for you tomorrow morning

303
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,232
at a clinic.

304
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,596
Wait, what?

305
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,637
You're not going to be able
to take care of this child by yourself.

306
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,964
We're not going to deal with this,

307
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,212
and if you don't cooperate,

308
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,006
we're going to have
no choice but to ask you to leave.

309
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,076
I don't want to do that.

310
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,743
Ifs not about what you want, honey,

311
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,185
unless you want to end up
just like your mother.

312
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,589
You don't have to worry
about anything.

313
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,093
I will be with you
to hold your hand.

314
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:44,866
Hi, Tom.

315
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,335
Not yet.

316
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,037
I'm sorry.
No cell phones, please.

317
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,142
I have to hang up.

318
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:11,224
Honey, I think I'm going
to wait in the waiting room.

319
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:31,977
Can you hurry up, please?

320
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,384
The doctor's on his way.

321
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,268
You got a man with you?

322
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,077
I'm okay.

323
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,354
I'm not scared.

324
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,290
Please, God.

325
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,790
Protect me.

326
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,349
Yo, Shorty.

327
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,717
Shorty, we got some business
we need to discuss.

328
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,260
Yo, Shorty,
let me holler at you.

329
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,006
You going to
make me come over there?

330
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,614
I said get in the car. Come on.

331
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,439
Don't you hear me?
I said get in the car.

332
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,076
We got some business to discuss.

333
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,250
Get your ass in the car.

334
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,684
That's what I'm talking about.

335
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,625
I'm going to kill you,
you little bitch!

336
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,830
Rest easy.

337
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,303
You're in the security ward,

338
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,601
Newark City Hospital.

339
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,099
I'm Father Frank McCarthy,

340
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,139
chaplain here at the hospital.

341
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,355
Do I have your permission to be
in this room with you?

342
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,851
I'm not here about that.

343
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,153
Your baby's all right.

344
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,848
The doctors had this taken

345
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,320
when they found
the one in your shoe.

346
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,364
Can you try talking?

347
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,968
I don't need a priest.

348
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,835
God don't care about me.

349
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,377
Don't waste your time.

350
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,271
You're mistaken.

351
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:15,349
God is ever near
and with us always.

352
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,716
Last time I asked for his help,
he put me here.

353
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:25,453
He's a tough C.O. at times,
but maybe...

354
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,897
you're exactly
where you were meant to be.

355
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,639
“Lord, make me
an instrument of Thy peace;

356
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,002
"Where there's hatred,
let me sow lave;"

357
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,841
“Where there's injury, pardon;

358
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,481
"Where there's doubt, faith.“."

359
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,397
You still here?

360
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,606
This is still here,

361
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,105
I'm still here.

362
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,277
You were sleeping, so I didn't think
you'd mind if I used your john.

363
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,876
I found out that

364
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,620
the authorities will probably drop
all charges against you,

365
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,047
but they're
going to keep you here

366
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,727
until they can get
in touch with your family

367
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,590
or find you a temporary home.

368
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,732
I didn't ask you to talk
to anyone for me.

369
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,460
Why do you want to help me?

370
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,365
It's my job.

371
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:41,765
You're a priest.

372
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,296
If you were a good one,

373
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,442
you'd be at your own church
right now, not here.

374
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,078
This is my church.

375
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,743
And I'm
not just thinking about you.

376
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,917
What will happen
if you leave here by yourself?

377
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,649
Where will you go?

378
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,626
Here.

379
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:13,063
I want you to have this.

380
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,434
Being young and pregnant
is like being a pinwheel.

381
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,636
Whenever the weather changes,

382
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,905
you have no idea
what way your life is going to go.

383
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,651
The pinwheel is supposed
to bring good fortune.

384
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,510
Go ahead.

385
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,954
Blow it.

386
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,992
I did some research for you.

387
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:48,294
It led me to a special shelter
for teens

388
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,802
who want to have their babies,

389
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,462
like your baby.

390
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,174
Don't try and tell me this.

391
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,703
Do you think I'm stupid?

392
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,980
I've been in shelters and foster cares
my whole life.

393
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,643
I ain't going back to no shelter!

394
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,482
Don't make your child suffer
because you're suffering.

395
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,681
God put you here for a reason.

396
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,690
Leave! Now!

397
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,629
You talk about suffering!

398
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,629
Where was God
when I was getting abused

399
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:19,029
and suffering all these years, huh?

400
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,235
You can't help me!

401
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,862
You think you know me.

402
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,673
You don't know anything!

403
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:28,842
Now get out!

404
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,208
Leave!

405
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,873
Just press the nurse's station
on the phone

406
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,711
when you want me
to come and get you, okay?

407
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,840
Agnes, I was so worried
about you, baby.

408
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,209
What are you doing here?

409
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,876
Agnes, I'm Marie Abeanni,
your social worker.

410
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,921
I will be handling your discharge
when the time comes.

411
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,424
I had a long talk with your mother.

412
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,055
She's very concerned
about your well-being

413
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:23,563
and assured me
that this was an isolated incident,

414
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,361
that things at home
are okay between you and her.

415
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,764
Is this true?

416
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,405
I already told you we good.
Why you asking again?

417
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,561
Excuse me.

418
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,872
I need to talk with Agnes now
and hear it from her.

419
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,741
Agnes, look at me.

420
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,146
Your mother has custody,

421
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,717
so it is better
if we work this out together.

422
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,214
If you run away again,

423
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,913
we may have to place you
back in foster care.

424
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,753
Going home
is the best solution for you.

425
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,327
Your mother wants
to talk with you now

426
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,129
to settle your differences.

427
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,068
Do you think you can do this?

428
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:06,231
Yeah, whatever.

429
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:07,935
Good.

430
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,603
I'll be sitting right outside the room
if you have any other questions.

431
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,115
You got people asking
all types of questions,

432
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,417
coming around my place
looking around.

433
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,752
You crazy?

434
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,287
She said you carrying a baby?

435
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,666
And I got to hear
about it from a stranger.

436
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,134
That's nice. That's real nice.

437
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,000
Humiliate me like that!

438
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,265
What's wrong with you?

439
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,000
No, come on.

440
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,506
Why you think I'm here, huh?

441
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,280
State's going to take care of us.

442
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,545
You, me, and baby,
that makes three.

443
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,188
That means
when that baby comes out,

444
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,948
they're going to be paying us
more money.

445
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,189
We got another chance, all right?

446
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,962
We're going to be a real family now,
sweetie, for real.

447
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,699
Come on.

448
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,503
Look at you.

449
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,347
Taking me back.

450
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,912
You know,
I wasn't that much older than you.

451
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:28,486
Seventeen.

452
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,755
Don't look at me like that,

453
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,259
like you all high and mighty.

454
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,825
I didn't have no social worker
caring about me.

455
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,195
Nobody wanted me to have you!

456
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,999
Wait.

457
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,444
You think I always looked
like this, huh?

458
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,746
Like I born in the streets?

459
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,185
You don't know
what I wanted out of life.

460
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,961
You don't know who I was,

461
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,857
who I could have been.

462
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,697
You're so stuck up.

463
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,730
You think you're
so much better than me.

464
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,404
Like you're so different.

465
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,116
Baby, you are me.

466
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,385
You'll see.

467
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:34,546
When you're fighting for your baby,

468
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,923
and you're so young,

469
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,328
and you ain't got nobody
to take care of it,

470
00:43:41,486 --> 00:43:43,090
you can't even
take care of yourself.

471
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,167
And all you want to do
is protect your baby.

472
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,900
That's all I wanted to do.

473
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,335
Hold my baby.

474
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,337
My little baby girl.

475
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:58,744
You don't know.

476
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,174
But I did.

477
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,644
I did everything that I could, Agnes.

478
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,320
I did.

479
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:14,322
And I messed up, okay?

480
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,260
That's right, I messed up.

481
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,763
And then when they took you
away from me,

482
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,370
that was the worst day of my life.

483
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,773
I hurt so much right here.

484
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,515
I just wanted
the pain to go away, baby.

485
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,851
I didn't want to feel nothing.

486
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,489
I didn't want to feel anything.

487
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,453
Look at me.

488
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,131
Look at me now.

489
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,695
Look at me now.

490
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,862
I deserve a second chance.

491
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,840
A second chance.

492
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,711
Please, baby?

493
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,678
Please just give me
one more chance.

494
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:12,685
I don't know.

495
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,379
<i>Baby, I'm your mother.</i>

496
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:18,521
I just can't do this anymore.

497
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:20,321
- Just one more chance.
- I can't do this anymore.

498
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,020
Please, baby.

499
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,494
You got to let me go.

500
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,667
- You ready?
- Yeah. We're done here.

501
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,043
"But we will build"

502
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:45,083
"with hewn stones."

503
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,952
"“The sycamores"

504
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:05,064
"...as men rejoice
when they divide the spoil."

505
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:10,269
“For thou hast broken
the yoke of thy burden...“

506
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,706
Father?

507
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:17,782
I just wanted to...

508
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,418
to come here...

509
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,554
to tell you that...

510
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,429
I probably
shouldn't have yelled at you.

511
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,493
I mean, I know why I did.

512
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,597
I didn't think that...

513
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,471
that you would...

514
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,775
Are you apologizing to me?

515
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,681
Not really.

516
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,078
Seems like it to me.

517
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:54,484
Never apologize
for your true feelings.

518
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,335
Now that you're here,
grab a book.

519
00:46:58,449 --> 00:46:59,951
Make yourself useful.

520
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,118
Page seventy-two.

521
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,628
We'll talk later.

522
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:07,659
Go on.

523
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:15,940
And?

524
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:23,114
"For I know the plans I have for you,"

525
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,549
"declares the Lord,"

526
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:33,628
"plans for your welfare
and not for evil,"

527
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,962
"to give you..."

528
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,661
"give you a future"

529
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,866
"and hope."

530
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,967
"Then you will call upon me,"

531
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:52,580
"and come and pray to me,"

532
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:56,044
"and I will hear you.“."

533
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,782
Father McCarthy.

534
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,758
Hi, I'm Afra,
one of the housemothers here.

535
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,086
Welcome to our shelter.

536
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,802
I'll let Kathy know you're here.

537
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,973
That's Kathy right there
with Mother Teresa.

538
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,877
And that's her in that one

539
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,382
at the White House
with Ronald Reagan.

540
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,452
Hello, Father. Good to see you.

541
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,610
Please bear with me.

542
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,484
We were having a little incident.

543
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:09,647
Everything okay?

544
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:11,760
Yeah, everything
worked out just fine.

545
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,918
Thank you for meeting
my friend, Apple.

546
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:16,761
Hello, Apple.

547
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,801
Kathy's the founder.

548
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:25,472
She started this shelter
twenty years ago,

549
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,609
taking young mothers
into her own home.

550
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,977
This is your home?

551
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,944
Well, ifs grown quite a bit.

552
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:35,643
Afra will give you a tour.

553
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,841
I'm going to wrap some things up,

554
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,281
and then you and I
will meet in the morning

555
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,353
and we'll have a chat
about the rules, okay?

556
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:42,985
- Yeah.
- Okay.

557
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,455
See you suddenly, Apple.

558
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:49,290
Hey, everybody, this is Apple-.

559
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,155
She's staying with us.

560
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,357
Her name is really Apple?

561
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:55,333
You will all get
to know her better later.

562
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,131
You'll be sharing a room
with Tawana.

563
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:00,536
And she'll show you to your room.

564
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,109
And I'll be on duty
if you need something.

565
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:03,336
Apple, huh'?

566
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:05,470
Goes well with caramel.

567
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,445
Carmel, caramel.

568
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,009
I'm just saying.
We just playing"!!-

569
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,853
She can't take a joke?

570
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,835
You can put your stuff in here.

571
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,346
I don't have any stuff.

572
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,712
Well, don't worry. You will.

573
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,745
Would you mind holding her
for a second?

574
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,694
Thanks.

575
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,304
Okay, Isaiah.

576
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,413
I hear you.

577
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,015
I hear you.

578
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,825
- What's your name?
- What the...?

579
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,996
- Where you from?
- Get that out of my face!

580
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,907
What is going on in here?

581
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,239
I like your PJ's.

582
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,644
Cassandra,
you missed curfew again tonight,

583
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:31,013
and you didn't tell anybody
where you were going.

584
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:33,477
I'm writing you up,

585
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,146
and it's not going
to be good for you.

586
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:38,225
Who is responsible for letting her
in here after curfew'!

587
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:42,195
Was it you, Apple?

588
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,559
I don't even know her.
She's crazy.

589
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,326
This is not going to look good
for your first night.

590
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,530
That's a really nice name.

591
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,170
We will deal with this tomorrow.

592
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,772
But you shouldn't call
people crazy around here.

593
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,908
I actually prefer Cassie.

594
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,066
It's five a.m.

595
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,770
I want everybody
back in their rooms now.

596
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:08,853
What happened
with you two last night?

597
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:15,786
Cassie, why were you late for curfew?

598
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:18,229
I went for a walk.
I got locked out.

599
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,526
I'm sorry? You got...

600
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,397
I went for a walk.
I got locked out.

601
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,064
It was nothing, really.

602
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,866
Good, because
I'm going to put you both

603
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,477
in the same room temporarily.

604
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:31,908
You're going to be roommates.

605
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:35,475
With her?

606
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:36,640
Why?

607
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:39,117
It'll to give you a chance
to work out your differences.

608
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,586
We have a twenty-four-hour rule
in this house.

609
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,088
Whenever two girls
are disputing,

610
00:54:43,247 --> 00:54:44,954
they need to work it out
right away.

611
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,029
Do you have a problem with that?

612
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:51,926
Ifs exciting.

613
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:54,964
Good.

614
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,798
Cassie, would you
excuse us, please?

615
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,521
I have something
to talk to Apple about.

616
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:11,344
Apple, we have a serious problem.

617
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:15,253
Your mother will not give her consent
for you to be here.

618
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,119
I'm very sorry.
I tried everything I could.

619
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,521
How could you call her?

620
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,860
She will never let me go.

621
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:23,089
Not as long as welfare
keeps sending her money.

622
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,755
Why would you do this to me?

623
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:26,595
Because she threatened
to call the police

624
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:28,202
and charge us with kidnapping.

625
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,162
What do you have
against your mother?

626
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,830
Did she ever abuse you?

627
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,309
I don't want to talk about it.

628
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,938
You can tell me what it is.

629
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:45,185
I can't.

630
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,852
Then I can't help you.

631
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,992
As much as I like you
and care about you and your baby,

632
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,392
I won't go to jail for you.

633
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:57,525
Because you're a minor,
I need the support of the state

634
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,031
or consent from your family...

635
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,793
And I'm supposed to believe that'?

636
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,733
Stop talking and listen to me.

637
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:05,669
Or some legal reason
why you have to stay here.

638
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,331
You said you
was going to help me out.

639
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,208
You're a liar.

640
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,472
Apple, here you become a mother,

641
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,706
and that means
you take responsibility.

642
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,012
Don't cast your immaturity on me,

643
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,010
and then ask me to risk
everything,

644
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:23,249
including the future of this shelter,
on your foolishness.

645
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:26,087
Stop dancing with your demons!

646
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:27,887
Look at me.

647
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,555
Learn to cooperate.

648
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:38,382
Shine the light on the lock.

649
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:39,600
It won't open.

650
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,071
Get lotion.

651
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,456
This is like the shopping mall.

652
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,860
Shut up!

653
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:06,962
Check this out.

654
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:11,132
I don't think he's going to be able
to fit in that any time soon.

655
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:12,603
You calling my son fat?

656
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,572
You're a huge jerk.

657
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,426
Sh ll, 9 "Vs-".

658
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,135
Wow, Kathy needs
to clean up her office.

659
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:15,668
There's a lot in here.

660
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,828
- I know.
- Gosh.

661
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,531
Hurry up. Close the door.

662
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:27,204
Look. What's that?

663
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:28,645
Who's that?

664
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,480
Is that Kathy?

665
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,675
Let me see-.

666
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:32,877
No, ifs not.

667
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:34,716
Yeah, it's Kathy as a little girl.

668
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,452
<i>Wow, she's nuke.</i>

669
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:37,956
- She ain't all that, Jazzie.
- She's pretty.

670
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:39,890
<i>She fight.</i>

671
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,392
Don't open it. Who said that?

672
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:48,795
What is this?

673
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,575
Oh, wow.

674
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,044
"Carmel Nickerson.“."

675
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:01,909
What's that?

676
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,845
U N ice '3 ﬂ'

677
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,079
Yep.

678
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,092
“Destiny Morell.“

679
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:14,887
it's Princess.

680
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:16,887
Thank you.

681
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,727
“Danisha Dormer.“

682
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,096
Don't put my government out like that.

683
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,267
"Apple Bailey.“."

684
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:31,003
"Jasmine Colon.“."

685
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,176
It's Colon-n.

686
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:34,337
All right, check this.

687
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:38,577
This says "compulsive, anxiety,
and personality disorders."

688
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:40,448
What's “compulsive”?

689
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,112
It means you ask
too many questions.

690
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,584
What about you, Pink Friday?

691
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,956
Don't call me Pink Friday.

692
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:55,397
"Drugs, prostitution,
criminal record,"

693
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,470
"personality disorder."

694
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,231
"No family on record.“."

695
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,235
Prostitution?

696
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,376
Are you serious
with the prostitution?

697
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,034
Damn, girl.

698
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,044
You got a record!

699
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:10,549
“Rape victim, runaway.

700
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,448
“Family does not want her back.“

701
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,652
It's all right.
We're your family.

702
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,918
Ifs okay, Jazzie. We want you.

703
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:23,155
Mine says, "Mental
and physical abuse as a child."

704
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:27,462
"Chronic depression
and must overcome fear."

705
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,625
What the what?

706
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:30,066
No fear?

707
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:31,433
What about you, Apple?

708
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:40,081
It says,
"Severe physical abuse, runaway,"

709
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:44,009
“parental drug£alcohol abuse,

710
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:46,780
"multiple shelters and foster care,"

711
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,616
"aggressive behavior,"

712
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,121
"lack of trust.“."

713
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:52,955
Don't worry.
You can trust us, though.

714
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,289
Yeah, you're not aggressive.

715
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:57,796
That's what it says.

716
01:01:10,934 --> 01:01:12,641
Hi. Can I help you?

717
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,543
- You must be Kathy, right?
- Yes.

718
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,115
I'm Agnes' mother.

719
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:17,377
Where is she? Agnes!

720
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,282
Oh, yes. Why don't you come in.

721
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,217
Where's my daughter at? Agnes?

722
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,483
I'm taking her home.

723
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,856
I missed you.

724
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,196
Yo, little Agnes?

725
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,811
Can I get you something
to eat or drink?

726
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:45,742
You must be very tired from the drive.

727
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:48,579
Nah.

728
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:49,842
We're leaving.

729
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,343
Grab your stuff. We're going.

730
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,653
I ain't going anywhere with you.

731
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,856
What?

732
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,893
Shut up, all right? You coming!

733
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:06,364
I'm just texting my associate
to have her things brought down.

734
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:07,763
Nah, you know what?

735
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:11,361
We don't need anything
from you, all right?

736
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:13,397
Come on.

737
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,941
No, no! I'm sorry.

738
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,442
NO! <i>I</i> cannot.

739
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:19,012
- You may not take her!
- What?

740
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:21,513
I am required by law
to report any abuse.

741
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:22,706
I'm sorry.

742
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:24,579
- Mind your own business!
- No, I'm sorry.

743
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,741
You don't come with me right now,
I'm calling DYFS,

744
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,378
and I'm putting you in a home!

745
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:31,906
You think for one second
they're going to let you keep that baby?

746
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:34,685
It's your choice-.

747
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:35,955
I have called the police.

748
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,479
If you don't want to be arrested,
you need to leave right...

749
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,531
- Nobody cares about us!
- I'm sorry.

750
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,560
You have to leave now.

751
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:44,728
Don't you know that?

752
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:45,964
You have to leave now.

753
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,038
I hate you.

754
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,753
Listen to me.
You need to leave.

755
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,819
You need to leave right now.

756
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:04,216
You don't even know what you did.

757
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:16,664
June?

758
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:22,302
Is that you?

759
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,311
What the hell is he doing here?

760
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,076
You have got to go.

761
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:32,652
What the hell is he doing here?

762
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:40,489
Honey, you have got to go now.

763
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,687
I don't want to be around him.

764
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,798
Agnes, how could you
do that to me?

765
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:48,128
- I'm her mother!
- Stop.

766
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,212
I'm Tom.

767
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:09,823
Hi, Tom, I'm so sorry.

768
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,187
It'll have to be another time.

769
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,850
I made a mistake.

770
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,894
I'm so sorry.
It's not a good time.

771
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,160
- But I need to talk to Apple.
- I know you do.

772
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:20,028
I'm so sorry,
but it'll have to be another time.

773
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,794
- Can I help?
- No, we're good.

774
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,567
Another time, please.

775
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:29,410
- Can I just have a word...
- I'm so sorry.

776
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,178
Okay, honey.

777
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,316
Ifs okay now. Come on.

778
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,720
Let's go inside.

779
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,054
I've got you.

780
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:51,864
I don't know, but I know
I'm craving some red velvet cake.

781
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,000
How many more of these
do we have to do?

782
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,003
Kathy says
the more envelopes we send out,

783
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:01,075
the more donations we can get.

784
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:03,270
<i>'So: M</i>

785
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,205
<i>'so: M.</i>

786
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,876
It's going to be four black babies

787
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:09,914
and four white babies now.

788
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,714
Carmel, you can't count.

789
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:14,878
You forgot yourself.

790
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,284
<i>Just s“ dum, dumdum.</i>

791
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:19,188
And Tina and Jaz are Hispanic,
not white,

792
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:20,692
so that's another category.

793
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,955
Besides, you don't even know
what Apple's baby is.

794
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,430
For all you know,
it may be a caramel color like you.

795
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,227
Yet another category.

796
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,065
Okay, well, I tried.

797
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:34,402
My baby's father's black.

798
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:37,811
I bet he's fine.

799
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:38,968
See? I told you.

800
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:41,081
I bet you guys were getting it on.

801
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:29,588
Everybody grab a box
or something.

802
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,365
Take a box in.

803
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:36,462
Very good.

804
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:38,105
Can you get the door?

805
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:39,501
Need help?

806
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:18,007
I would like to call up
Kathy Defiore,

807
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,544
<i>who many of us know,</i>

808
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:23,377
to talk about her very special work
that she is doing.

809
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,579
Thank you, Father Marks.

810
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:32,226
Good morning, everybody.

811
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,827
Or should I say good afternoon?

812
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,429
- Good afternoon.
- I have been... thank you...

813
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:40,261
here eight or nine times
at Our Lady of Sorrows,

814
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:41,766
and I thought to myself,

815
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,996
"What can I say to you all"

816
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:46,397
"that I haven't said before?“."

817
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:50,040
Twenty years ago,
I was homeless.

818
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,870
And I'm not sure
I can really explain

819
01:07:54,037 --> 01:07:55,744
what it was like
being without a home,

820
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,250
frightened and alone,

821
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:04,123
and all the while trying to hold
onto my dignity as a woman.

822
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,092
And then my life
began to turn around.

823
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:10,894
I found a job

824
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:13,631
and a home.

825
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:18,137
And then I had
the most wonderful inspiration.

826
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:25,038
I opened my home as a shelter
for teenage pregnant girls,

827
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:27,709
because, you see, I understand

828
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:31,283
that this may be
the only chance they have.

829
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:35,253
So please open your hearts;.

830
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,482
Take a look at your envelopes,

831
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,251
so that
we can give them shelter,

832
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:40,455
we can give them guidance,

833
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:43,120
we can give them an education.

834
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,232
So that we can give them a future.

835
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,802
Thank you, and God bless.

836
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,097
Thank you so much.

837
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,263
What a beautiful sermon.

838
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:22,869
Now you're not only a whore,

839
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:25,006
but you're a frickin' beggar too?

840
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,006
Let's see how much they give
an ugly beggar!

841
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,166
Give me a kiss!

842
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,471
Slop!

843
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:37,281
Get off me!

844
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,222
Why don't you come inside?

845
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,526
It is freezing out here.

846
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:30,237
You can come and help
with the decorations.

847
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:32,900
We're having a party.

848
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:34,937
A party for what?

849
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:38,045
Destiny went to the hospital
to have Leticia.

850
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:39,941
We're going to surprise her.

851
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,576
She's going to be back
in a few days.

852
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,555
Ifs going to be okay.

853
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,143
Aren't you sick of this?

854
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:18,378
Of what?

855
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:20,986
What? Being exploited?

856
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,432
The way we're marched
around here.

857
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,320
The way
we're told what to wear,

858
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:26,960
when to smile,

859
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,721
who to be nice to?

860
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,997
It all makes me sick.

861
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,795
I'm tired of it, aren't you?

862
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,972
We ain't got much of a choice.

863
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,471
I know I don't want anyone
feeling any pity for me

864
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,768
except for me.

865
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,839
Do you want me
to feel bad for you, Apple?

866
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:47,910
Because you know that
you're not the only girl around here

867
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,640
who never really had a mom.

868
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,478
Why can't she
just leave me alone?

869
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:57,922
I suffered my whole life
because of my mother,

870
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,321
and now that she's gone,
I suffer even more.

871
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,521
You hate her
for what she's done to you,

872
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,463
but deep down, you love her,

873
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:09,830
and that hurts you even more.

874
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,432
So what about it?

875
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:17,509
I'm getting my own place.

876
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,342
You should come with me.
Think about it.

877
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,881
And what about your baby?

878
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,054
My baby's all right.

879
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:31,556
Ain't nothing happening to my baby.

880
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,495
You sound like them.

881
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:37,959
I'm just saying that maybe...

882
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,031
Everything's set up
for after Christmas.

883
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,628
We're going
to go make our own money.

884
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,331
No more of this begging stuff.

885
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,303
Are you coming with me
or not, Apple?

886
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:07,358
My beautiful, healthy baby.

887
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,414
You're probably going to need
a little more than that.

888
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,888
Father McCarthy.

889
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,029
Thought I'd drop by
and see how you're managing.

890
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,026
I'm okay.

891
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:53,935
I heard about your mother.

892
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,244
I'm very sorry that happened.

893
01:13:58,534 --> 01:13:59,877
She needs help.

894
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,712
But you have to think
about yourself now

895
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:03,976
and your child.

896
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,788
I caused all this.

897
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:13,252
It's my fault.

898
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,493
There's a saying in the Bible...

899
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:27,167
"All of us, like sheep,
have gone astray."

900
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:31,175
"Each of us has turned
to his own way.“."

901
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:34,745
And that's her way, not yours.

902
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:37,416
Look, I'm leaving here.

903
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,114
One of the girls found a place.

904
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,153
She wants me to come with her.

905
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,291
Does Kathy know about this?

906
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,688
No, she wouldn't understand.

907
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,490
Not until there's an empty bed to fill.

908
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,593
If you leave
the safety of the shelter,

909
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:59,331
you put yourself
and your child in jeopardy.

910
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:08,775
I got to go.

911
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:10,843
I'll pray for you.

912
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,145
Don't bother.

913
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:36,634
Why are you putting
a binky on the tree?

914
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:38,073
It looks stupid.

915
01:15:40,136 --> 01:15:41,342
I kind of like it.

916
01:15:41,504 --> 01:15:42,983
Yeah.

917
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:44,174
See that?

918
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,377
- I like it, too.
- Thank you.

919
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,577
Yeah, me, too.

920
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,347
We should
all put baby stuff on the tree.

921
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:50,923
I think that's a good idea.

922
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,760
Hey, Apple?

923
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,329
You want to add stuff to the tree?

924
01:15:58,654 --> 01:15:59,724
Yeah.

925
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:03,828
I'll be right back.

926
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:05,097
All right.

927
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:25,722
Sorry. Excuse me.

928
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:26,916
Watch out.

929
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:41,037
Good one, Apple!

930
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:42,471
Way to go!

931
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:54,314
All right, loves.

932
01:16:55,578 --> 01:16:57,580
We're going to say
"Merry Christmas", okay?

933
01:16:57,746 --> 01:16:59,157
Everybody ready?

934
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:01,761
One, two, three.

935
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,587
Merry Christmas!

936
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,163
Come on now.

937
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:10,804
What you trying to do?

938
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,462
The baby needs to turn over.

939
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:15,007
They can be very stubborn.

940
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,400
You hear that?

941
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:21,578
Wonder where she gets that,
or he gets that, huh?

942
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:26,581
There it goes.

943
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:28,180
What?

944
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:32,083
See the baby moving around?

945
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:35,186
Do you want to know
the sex of the baby?

946
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,123
Yeah.

947
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:40,429
You're having a girl.

948
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:50,599
What are you doing?

949
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:51,836
Get your stuff. Let's go.

950
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,105
She kicked me.

951
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:54,304
What?

952
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:56,277
We don't have time for this.
Let's go.

953
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:57,940
No, she kicked me.

954
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:01,049
Cassie, I'm not going.

955
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:07,452
Fine. Don't go.

956
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,556
Cassie, don't go.

957
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:16,394
If you leave,
I'll never see you again.

958
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:17,537
I know it.

959
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,736
Don't you get it, Apple?

960
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,342
I'm no good here.

961
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:29,343
Ifs time to go.

962
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:32,543
Good-bye, Apple.

963
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:46,562
Go ahead, loves.

964
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,497
What's the matter, honey?
Is he hungry?

965
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:52,199
Here's Dino, everybody.

966
01:18:52,361 --> 01:18:53,431
Hi, girls.

967
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:59,737
Dino has generously donated
this very special meal for us.

968
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,781
Come on,
it's nothing for you girls.

969
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,380
He's letting us eat here for free?

970
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,522
That's nothing.

971
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:09,678
Enjoy it, girls.

972
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,085
Just enjoy it.

973
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:15,687
All right, everyone, let's eat.

974
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,528
- What is that?
- Salad... onions.

975
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,408
- This looks delicious.
- I don't want that.

976
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:24,065
Who needs a plate?

977
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:25,261
Passing down.

978
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:40,547
Ladies, I have
a special announcement to make.

979
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:42,586
In just a few weeks,

980
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:45,783
it's going to be
a unique anniversary for all of us.

981
01:19:46,415 --> 01:19:48,053
It was twenty years ago

982
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:51,494
that I first opened my home
to start our shelter,

983
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,497
and it's because
of the courage of all of you

984
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:58,131
and all the young mothers
that we have survived.

985
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:01,930
And I would like to say
thank you to you.

986
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:04,136
And the way
I'm going to do that is

987
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:08,476
I'm planning an amazing trip
to the Jersey Shore

988
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:12,783
for all of us
to celebrate together.

989
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:16,522
Can we bring our babies?

990
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,352
Of course,
you can bring your babies.

991
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,259
- Oh, my God.
- What?

992
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:23,954
I think my water just broke.

993
01:20:26,622 --> 01:20:28,431
There you are.

994
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,001
That-a-girl.

995
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,603
That's it.

996
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:34,767
Good, good, good.

997
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:37,871
Yes, there it is!

998
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:42,376
And relax.
Now we need you to relax-.

999
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:43,846
Keep your eyes closed, okay?

1000
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,485
Ifs being contracted.

1001
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,357
That's it. Now stop pushing.

1002
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:57,854
Look down, look down.

1003
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,055
Here's your baby.

1004
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:02,634
My baby.

1005
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:05,200
What's her name?

1006
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,034
- Her name is Hope.
- That's beautiful.

1007
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,573
It's Hope.

1008
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:09,801
That's my baby.

1009
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,219
You did it, sweetheart.

1010
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,115
We'll take her right there.

1011
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,424
Apple, your dad is
in the waiting room,

1012
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:06,589
and he needs
to be part of this moment.

1013
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:09,696
Can you do this?

1014
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:13,267
He can come see the baby,

1015
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,067
but I don't want to talk to him.

1016
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:51,608
"I'm sorry it worked out this way."

1017
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,312
"I never really meant
for this to happen."

1018
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,009
"My name is Tom."

1019
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,488
"I'm your father, but we'll
probably never know each other."

1020
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:08,822
“L just found out
you're going to be a girl.

1021
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,522
"June and I barely know each other."

1022
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,097
"We just went out a few times."

1023
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:18,463
“It's not like we planned this.

1024
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:20,933
"You just happened."

1025
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:23,367
"You showed up unexpectedly."

1026
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:27,870
"I'm living at home
with my parents."

1027
01:23:28,637 --> 01:23:30,344
“I'm about to start college-.

1028
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:33,219
"I can't disappoint them."

1029
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,877
"I have no choice."

1030
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,654
"June is stubborn."

1031
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:42,022
"I can't talk to her."

1032
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,964
“I'll never see her again,

1033
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,793
“so I guess I'll never see you.

1034
01:23:48,156 --> 01:23:49,328
"That hurts."

1035
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:57,684
"I would have liked
to be your father,"

1036
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,076
“but I'm just not ready.

1037
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,581
"I guess I'm hoping
that you may someday understand"

1038
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:04,877
"and forgive me..."

1039
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:10,917
"and that maybe"

1040
01:24:11,914 --> 01:24:15,327
"you would be apple of my eye."

1041
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:20,659
"“Fm sorry. Tom."

1042
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,224
Thanks so much for coming.

1043
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:51,420
Apple.

1044
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:54,767
Congratulations.

1045
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:57,398
You look good, too.

1046
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:00,865
Good feet.

1047
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:03,941
Good foundation.

1048
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,544
We got some presents for you.

1049
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,474
And flowers.

1050
01:25:07,636 --> 01:25:09,115
And I spelled your name right.

1051
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:16,086
Julian, go ahead
and say hi to Hope.

1052
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:18,085
You go right ahead
and walk right over to them.

1053
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,920
Julian, hi.

1054
01:25:20,082 --> 01:25:21,152
Play date.

1055
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,457
Let's have a play date here.

1056
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:29,160
I just love you guys.

1057
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,464
Look at her stretch.

1058
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:39,137
- She's out.
- Yeah.

1059
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:41,577
I'm going to feed her
before she really passes out.

1060
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,279
It's okay.

1061
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:56,523
She's out like the light.

1062
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,130
Want me to take that?

1063
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:18,846
I'm going to go
to the restroom,

1064
01:26:18,874 --> 01:26:21,445
and you two can
have some quality time.

1065
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:57,147
You want to hold her?

1066
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:58,347
YES-.

1067
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:00,319
Here.

1068
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,374
Sweet little baby.

1069
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,420
I never got to do this with you.

1070
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:35,018
I didn't understand.

1071
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,266
I'll take her.

1072
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,036
There you go.

1073
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,110
You know something?

1074
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,646
She was born one day before I was.

1075
01:28:06,915 --> 01:28:08,952
Which reminds me.
We're having...

1076
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:12,924
a little party tomorrow afternoon.

1077
01:28:13,088 --> 01:28:14,226
Joanna's put it together.

1078
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:15,959
It's at the house, and...

1079
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,431
if you're not doing anything,

1080
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:21,665
we were hoping
that maybe you two would come by.

1081
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:39,017
Come on.

1082
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:43,585
I'll show you the new place-.

1083
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:50,765
She's so cute.

1084
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,164
It's a baby!

1085
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:35,674
What do you think?

1086
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:38,343
Nice?

1087
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,813
Ifs all for you and for Hope.

1088
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:44,521
- For us?
- Yes.

1089
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:46,317
We want you to come
and live with us.

1090
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:53,260
- Can I blow out...
- I want to!

1091
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:54,764
One, two, three.

1092
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,769
Is that how you cut the cake?

1093
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:10,213
Who's going
to butter daddy's nose?

1094
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:16,720
Who's got a napkin for me?

1095
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:19,848
Keep it on there
as a midnight snack.

1096
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,400
You're really leaving us?

1097
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:08,903
What about the Jersey Shore
next week?

1098
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:11,442
Yeah. We can't go without you.

1099
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:12,634
It won't be the same.

1100
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:22,321
It's real hard for me
to tell you guys how I feel.

1101
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:28,016
Thank you guys
so much for caring

1102
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:29,628
and being there for me.

1103
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:34,495
You've all been
like sisters to me.

1104
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,461
I'm never
really going to leave you guys.

1105
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:42,973
Friends for life.

1106
01:31:43,131 --> 01:31:44,269
We're going to miss you.

1107
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:11,462
See you suddenly.

1108
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,591
Stop the car.

1109
01:32:45,093 --> 01:32:46,538
Tom, stop the car.

1110
01:32:53,001 --> 01:32:54,105
What's wrong?

1111
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:57,906
Just the people there.

1112
01:32:59,274 --> 01:33:02,448
I mean, the girls
and the housemothers,

1113
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,292
they make you feel like you're family.

1114
01:33:09,851 --> 01:33:11,262
Like you're loved.

1115
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:15,531
Like you're worth something,

1116
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,969
and you can achieve
a lot of things.

1117
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:29,313
It's crazy how you can
go and live with strangers

1118
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:33,651
and feel so much joy

1119
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:39,748
and not feel
like you're any different.

1120
01:33:43,251 --> 01:33:46,596
And not feel unwanted.

1121
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:54,265
And feeling
you can go places in your life

1122
01:33:57,332 --> 01:34:01,144
and succeed in life.

1123
01:34:17,919 --> 01:34:19,364
Apple

1124
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:22,199
ifs okay.

1125
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,697
It's all right.

1126
01:34:32,534 --> 01:34:33,877
Come here.

1127
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:38,109
All right.

1128
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:41,551
I understand.

1129
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:44,881
I understand.

1130
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:51,526
I know I could be
your daughter someday,

1131
01:34:53,488 --> 01:34:55,331
but I just need some time.

1132
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:00,970
Can you give me that?

1133
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,979
Yep, I can do that.

1134
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:40,768
Oh, my God! Apple!
