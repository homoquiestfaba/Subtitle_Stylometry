- Morning, sir.
- Hey, Sarge.

540
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:05,967
Officer Wilkins, could we
speak with Bishop alone, please?

541
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,934
Yes, sir.

542
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:12,605
This is Mr. Smith. He's
the department lawyer.

543
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:13,974
- Morning.
- Will.

544
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:14,607
Morning.

545
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,110
Okay. Please.

546
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:24,485
Bishop, are you all right?

547
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,387
I didn't expect any of this.

548
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,390

- You responded to

549
00:28:30,423 --> 00:28:33,527
a distress call about
a violent situation

550
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,495
and you acted with bravery.

551
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:41,769
Not many people realize the
burdens we volunteer for

552
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:45,205
when we take on
this job every day.

553
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:49,344
It's a heroic responsibility
just to put on a badge.

554
00:28:50,477 --> 00:28:55,483
Now, we received some disturbing
information this morning

555
00:28:56,717 --> 00:29:00,321
and we're still
investigating its legitimacy.

556
00:29:00,354 --> 00:29:02,155
But I wanted to
sit down with you,

557
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:03,758
give you the news first,

558
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,461
so that I can answer any
questions you may have.

559
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:11,332
An email came in.

560
00:29:11,365 --> 00:29:16,170
It contained a recording of
some people playing video games

561
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:18,605

pages of arguments

565
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:28,215
At first, it made no sense,

566
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:31,585
but then one of the players

567
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:34,588
threatened to send a SWAT
team to someone's house.

568
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:39,593
That address was 14
Independence Square.

angry that night

580

when he came through
the door at you.

581
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:15,161
You and Officer
Wilkins both reported

582
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:17,564
hearing the shattering
of glass inside the house

583
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:19,866

holding a broken
bottle in his hand.

587

as a police officer

on the ground, correct?

Yes.

disobeyed those orders

592
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:45,192
and threw the bottle at you,

593
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:48,495
causing you to fire
at the suspect.

594

1248
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,965
Counsel, what's going on here

1249
01:14:13,997 --> 01:14:17,034
Your honor, may I have a
moment to speak with my client?

1250
01:14:17,068 --> 01:14:18,869
JUDGE: Yes.

1251
01:14:18,903 --> 01:14:20,137
You can't do this.

1252
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:22,273
You need to plead not guilty.

1253
01:14:22,305 --> 01:14:24,475
Do you understand the risk
you're putting on the department?

1254
01:14:25,408 --> 01:14:27,177
This is a complicated case.

1255
01:14:27,211 --> 01:14:28,780
No jury will find you guilty.

1256
01:14:28,813 --> 01:14:30,148
- I made up my mind.
- Your honor,

1257
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,381
if we could have a short recess?

1258
01:14:31,414 --> 01:14:33,083
I would like to
speak with my client.

1259
01:14:33,117 --> 01:14:36,454
Your honor, I'm guilty
of the charges against me.

1260
01:14:38,389 --> 01:14:41,226
Mr. Bishop, sir, this
is your arraignment.

1261
01:14:41,259 --> 01:14:43,895
It's unheard of to enter into
a guilty plea at this time.

1262
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:46,765
Are you sure that's what
you want to do, sir?

1263
01:14:46,797 --> 01:14:47,998
Yes, Your Honor.

1264
01:14:52,336 --> 01:14:53,805
Mr. Bishop, do you
waive and give up

1265
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:56,240
your right to a jury trial,

1266
01:14:56,274 --> 01:14:59,043
the right to confront and
cross-examine witnesses,

1267
01:14:59,076 --> 01:15:02,346
and to present evidence and
testimony on your own behalf?

1268
01:15:05,082 --> 01:15:07,152
Yes, I give up my
right, Your Honor.

1269
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:10,388
Let the record reflect
that the defendant willingly,

1270
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:12,289
knowingly, and
understandably has entered

1271
01:15:12,323 --> 01:15:16,394
into a plea of guilty to
the charge of manslaughter.

1272
01:15:18,296 --> 01:15:21,298
The clerk will have
him initial and sign

1273
01:15:21,332 --> 01:15:23,201
a formal plea agreement.

1274
01:15:24,368 --> 01:15:26,137
Counsel, do you waive
time for sentencing?

1275
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,439
MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.

1276
01:15:29,073 --> 01:15:32,077
Formal sentencing will be
held one week from today.

1277
01:15:34,212 --> 01:15:37,515
Mr. Bishop, your OR
status is hereby revoked.

1278
01:15:37,547 --> 01:15:40,918
Bailiff, he is to be remanded
into custody forthwith.

1279
01:15:43,154 --> 01:15:44,322
We're done here.

1280
01:15:45,256 --> 01:15:47,258
Court's adjourned.
