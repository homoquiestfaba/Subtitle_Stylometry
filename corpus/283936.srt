1
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,611
Hurry up...

2
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,344
We're not playing chess here

3
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,318
Exactly

4
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,946
Alright, what's the rush?

5
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,252
Got any flower?

6
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,691
Of course

7
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,364
Hurry

8
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,456
Fine... I won't play next time

9
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,164
Come on

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,999
Having fun here

11
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,496
Four East

12
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,438
Hold on...

13
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,604
Four East?

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:46,268
Yes

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,313
Thirteen Orphans

16
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,382
Look, the 4 different winds,
the 3 different dragons

17
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,246
three different singles

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,909
three different nines

19
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,222
128 dollars each, please

20
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,984
Thirteen Orphans

21
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,417
Pay up...

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,255
So strange... I had a good hand! Look

23
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,625
Just pay up, no excuse

24
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,227
Look, it's a good hand

25
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,459
I want one, four and seven dots

26
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,068
Guess, it's one dot

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,262
I can't believe it

28
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,234
Another one

29
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,170
Eight, seven...

30
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,511
You'll win for sure

31
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,209
Six pairs and a half

32
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,048
Same here

33
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:01,585
Alright

34
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,620
You too?

35
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,647
Can't believe it

36
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,653
So?

37
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,393
You'll see

38
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,091
What's the big deal?

39
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,062
Open

40
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,430
Look closely

41
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,166
Seven, eight, nine, ten, jack,
a straight flush

42
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,030
So unlucky

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,281
Don't believe it!

44
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,185
It's strange

45
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,054
Better than mine

46
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,962
Come on

47
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,329
Hurry up...

48
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,456
Discard one card

49
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,004
Hurry

50
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,262
It's your turn

51
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,036
Not 4, it's 3

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,674
Leave one if you pass

53
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,050
Pass

54
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,277
Me too

55
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,320
Pass, three

56
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,615
Three again? So many of three

57
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,516
No? Pass

58
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,626
Pass

59
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,492
Three, one, one, three

60
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,027
Pass

61
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,152
Three, six

62
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:18,662
Six, two

63
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,489
Pass

64
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,930
Two, five

65
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,131
Five, five

66
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,462
Five, three

67
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,195
Pass again

68
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,532
Don't keep passing

69
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,435
Yes, look at him

70
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,007
Pass

71
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,471
Pass

72
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,941
Me too

73
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,010
What's the big deal?

74
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,670
I've passed the fifth one

75
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,342
Three, two

76
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,915
Two, two

77
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:39,643
Two, four

78
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,318
Four, six

79
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,245
Then...

80
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,355
Six, one

81
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,478
One

82
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,286
One, two

83
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,018
Open

84
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:48,991
Fine, eight for me

85
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,619
Eight, double

86
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,932
Twenty, thirty, forty eight, ninety six

87
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,503
Thanks

88
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,029
This is bad news for you

89
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,472
One hundred and ninety two dollars

90
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,413
That's all, split it

91
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,178
Check this out

92
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,950
How much would this be worth?

93
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,385
I don't run a pawn shop here

94
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,353
Fine, I'll go to one

95
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,423
Hurry

96
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,560
Fifty dollars, I'll gamble again

97
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,288
Hey, watch it

98
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,921
It's you. Where are you going?

99
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:27,930
What's the rush?

100
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,364
Where're you going?

101
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,135
I've been very unlucky

102
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,296
I'm going to gamble again

103
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,066
Just can't believe I won't win

104
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,576
Believe it

105
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,406
Your forehead is dark, a sign of bad luck

106
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,206
Take a break

107
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,605
I don't believe I'm that unlucky

108
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,677
I've got fifty dollars

109
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,314
You want to bet?

110
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,413
Alright

111
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,419
What should we bet on here?

112
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,424
I've got an idea

113
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,489
I'm listening

114
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,492
It's easy

115
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,290
Just answer 'yes' to whatever I ask

116
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,161
You must be quick though

117
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,928
You'll lose if you say 'no'

118
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:03,467
That's it?

119
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,661
Yes

120
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,505
Fine, let's have a trial

121
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,909
Listen up

122
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,509
Has your wife gone off with another man?

123
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,137
What kind of question is that?

124
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,208
Yes or no?

125
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,483
Yes

126
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,114
Take it, can't believe you

127
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,484
For money's sake

128
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,614
Another 10 dollars

129
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,953
10 dollars

130
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,365
Are those men your fathers?

131
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,894
I've got so many fathers?

132
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,331
Yes or no?

133
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,201
Yes

134
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,168
Good boy

135
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,072
Buy a milk bottle with it

136
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,076
I'm telling you

137
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,543
If all my fathers are as nice as you...

138
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,204
I'll be rich; another ten

139
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,646
No, I've lost twenty dollars

140
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,645
Wait. One more time

141
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,285
Fine, but the stakes will be higher

142
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,880
Fine

143
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,515
Seventy dollars

144
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,259
Seventy dollars

145
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,291
Clean your ear wax

146
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,032
Is all this money mine?

147
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,897
No, I've got some too

148
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,234
You lose, you said 'no'

149
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,608
I'm so stupid. Should have said 'yes'

150
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,244
Come on

151
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,244
Place your bets

152
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,876
One, two, five, total eight, small

153
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,549
All small win

154
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,021
How come you win every time?

155
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,955
Of course.
I've offered my respects to the Gods

156
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:34,957
Is it working?

157
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,926
I get what I ask for

158
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,589
Just follow my lead

159
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,867
Excuse me

160
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,064
So many notes

161
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,911
Can I borrow a hundred?

162
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,211
No way, you still haven't paid your debts

163
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,409
Get lost, I'm trying to gamble here

164
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,881
Place your bets

165
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,919
Mister, please place my 200
on the upper gate

166
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,492
Upper gate

167
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,492
Two hundred on upper gate

168
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,960
Fine

169
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,927
Two hundred dollars? Are you sure?

170
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:19,935
Yes

171
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,061
I'll take my chances

172
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,435
You'll lose

173
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,440
Come on

174
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,669
Hold on

175
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,039
Place your bets

176
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,411
Ten again

177
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,157
Look

178
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:43,990
So?

179
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,188
You'll see

180
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,969
Oh, shit

181
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:06,176
Seven

182
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,082
I must be unlucky

183
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,887
Banker opens

184
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,060
Three, four, all win

185
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,368
You've it

186
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,893
So do you

187
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,630
You're unlucky

188
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,469
What have you got?

189
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,206
Nine, win

190
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,910
I knew I would win

191
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,340
Here you go

192
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,581
Hey, I placed two hundred dollars,
how come?

193
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,445
I'm doing this according to
the money on the table

194
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,054
You placed one hundred,
I'll give you another 100

195
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,850
I told him to place two hundred

196
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,582
Crazy

197
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,658
What's wrong with you?

198
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,119
I gave you two hundred

199
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,251
Two hundred? One hundred only

200
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,852
Give me back the money

201
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:51,986
You crook

202
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,258
You took my money
& wish to pocket it, huh?

203
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,891
Give me back my money

204
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,598
Give me the money back

205
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,099
What's going on?

206
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,207
The woman says
he has siphoned off her 100 quid

207
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,273
I told him to place two hundred

208
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,501
Fine, shut up

209
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,101
Give her two hundred, and send her away

210
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,508
Why would I take your money?

211
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,081
You, come over

212
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,450
Come here

213
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,312
Brother Nine, give me a chance

214
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,646
Kid, you've got some nerve

215
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,917
Look at all these IOU notes

216
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,458
What do you want here?

217
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,989
You want me to break your ribs?

218
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,997
Or have your legs amputed?

219
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,964
Tell me

220
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,468
I've been very unlucky

221
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,038
I've pawned everything

222
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,164
...except my wife

223
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:39,172
I've seen her before.
Quite a figure she's got

224
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,214
That's what everyone says

225
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,083
Get your wife to sleep with me
tomorrow night

226
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,345
Then I'll let you off

227
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,320
No way

228
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,946
I'd say no even if she agrees

229
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,082
Beat him up

230
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,191
Brother Nine, you should know

231
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,201
Women always ask for a show

232
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,634
I've got to give her some incentive

233
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,006
Lend me two hundred
to get her some trinkets

234
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,641
Don't try anything funny

235
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,209
Relax, I'll make sure she sleeps with you

236
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,542
Thanks, Brother

237
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,456
Two hundred dollars, that's a good deal

238
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,552
Cheers

239
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,492
Happy birthday to you

240
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,364
Happy birthday to my wife

241
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,597
Happy birthday to you

242
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,170
This beer is the best, dear

243
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,438
Drink some more

244
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,879
I thought the only thing
you remember is gambling

245
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,279
You still remember my birthday?

246
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,544
I've come to my senses

247
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,111
You, my wife, are most dear to me

248
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,589
Let's have another drink

249
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,558
No

250
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,989
It's your birthday

251
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,396
You must drink some more

252
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,299
Good

253
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,535
Stop it

254
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,445
Darling

255
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,411
We are in public

256
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,345
Let's not go home tonight

257
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,441
Where are we going then?

258
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,248
To a love motel

259
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,085
How much?

260
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,222
Interesting? So pretty

261
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,068
So many mirrors

262
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:53,941
Come here

263
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,210
So?

264
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,477
Don't worry, it's all set

265
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,416
Come over when I turn off the light

266
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,581
So pretty

267
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:18,628
Strip

268
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,235
Let me help you

269
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,308
Wait a minute

270
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,886
It's fun

271
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,051
Come here, darling

272
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,624
I want to take a bath first

273
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,153
Come on

274
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,561
You look gorgeous, darling

275
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,536
OK

276
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,476
Wow! You're amazing

277
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,344
Smells weird

278
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,112
Damn you

279
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,136
Get in

280
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,143
Sit down

281
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,922
Damn it

282
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,585
Turn your head

283
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,959
Let me teach you a lesson

284
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,587
You piece of shit

285
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,559
I've met a hot babe lately

286
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,265
And look what happened

287
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,131
I can't do anything now

288
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,433
Brother Nine, it could have worked out

289
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,905
You should have told me
about your body odor

290
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:10,531
Then I could have done...

291
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,075
No excuses

292
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,008
You've got two choices

293
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,514
First, you kill yourself

294
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,276
Second, let my staff to kill you

295
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,514
However that'd be a terrible death

296
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,521
So?

297
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,353
Is there a third option?

298
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,128
Yes, cut it off

299
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,091
Brother Nine, if you cut it

300
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,997
Then I'll become an eunuch

301
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:37,966
I'd rather kill myself

302
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,402
Fine, within 24 hours...

303
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,530
I want to read about your suicide
in the headlines

304
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,405
Or you'll be torn into pieces
within 48 hours

305
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,909
Think it over

306
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,954
Where are you going, honey?

307
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,950
You heartless fellow

308
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,527
You set up a trap for me
to sleep with some guy

309
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,186
I will divorce you

310
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,294
Honey, I had no choice

311
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,923
ltjust happened

312
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,194
Please forgive me

313
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,304
Cry all you want

314
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,268
Even if you cry yourself to death

315
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,169
I won't fall for your tricks

316
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,401
Crocodile tears

317
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,536
Leave me your number

318
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,614
Then I can call you sometime

319
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,075
...for tea

320
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,979
Call 999 or 110, you shit

321
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,012
999 or 110?

322
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,453
Easy to remember

323
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,456
Wait, honey

324
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,598
Kramer vs. Kramer

325
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,026
Me against the Jaws this time

326
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:53,076
Good bye Mahjong, pai gow, solitaire

327
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,212
Bye, honey

328
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,120
When unluckly even a tree
tends to bully you

329
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,232
Discard it

330
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:18,960
I'll pick another tree

331
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,238
My friend...

332
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,104
Be careful...

333
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,912
Please, don't do it

334
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,871
Don't try to save me

335
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:30,413
Sit down

336
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,607
I must die

337
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,509
I'll pick another tree

338
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,246
I must die

339
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,821
Thank God

340
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,423
You thought I care about you?

341
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,325
I just want to save the tree

342
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,127
This is government property

343
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,499
If you break it, then I'll be in trouble

344
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,162
Did you break this?

345
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,136
Yes or no?

346
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,936
Let's go to the police station

347
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,841
I've already charged you...

348
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,378
for destroying trees in the park

349
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,243
Do you have money for bail?

350
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,113
No, I'm broke

351
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,181
How about this?

352
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,619
Call your relatives to bail you out

353
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,948
I've got none. Even my wife has left me

354
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,588
I'll trust you for now

355
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,920
You can bail yourself out;
report to court on time

356
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,126
Sign here

357
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:28,597
Go

358
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,509
This is the most powerful type
of rat poison

359
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,140
Careful, one could die

360
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,277
Really?

361
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,045
How much?

362
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,307
Three dollars

363
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,815
Hey, what about my ecstasy pills?
I've paid you

364
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,474
Lower your voice

365
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,179
I sell these items secretly

366
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:42,844
Quiet

367
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,387
Hurry

368
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,580
Pay up

369
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,991
Ah Mei, where are you going?

370
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,184
For dinner

371
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,419
Your boyfriend's nice

372
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,084
Yes

373
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,423
I think so too

374
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,326
Let's call him

375
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,488
Go on then

376
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,929
Alright

377
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:55,294
For you

378
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:55,866
Go

379
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,298
Let's go

380
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,267
It's me

381
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,235
Pay up

382
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,200
Fine, talk to you later

383
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,238
Here you go

384
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,272
So many coins!

385
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,603
This is the wrong one

386
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,176
What's wrong with you?

387
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,575
Yes

388
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:09,813
Let's return it

389
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,511
What's this?

390
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,284
He must have taken the wrong packet

391
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,412
Such a drag, we're in a rush

392
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,252
Fine, take this

393
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,090
Goodbye, Hong Kong

394
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:08,003
My eyes to donate to
the Japanese blind man

395
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,940
My kidney for a friend who needs it badly

396
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,980
My blood for the vampire

397
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,309
So stupid

398
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,044
My teeth for a toothless guy

399
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,053
Signed, Cai Tou

400
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,893
You...

401
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,167
A flasher... nuts

402
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,080
Salute

403
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:54,049
Left, right, left, right

404
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,612
What are you doing?

405
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,787
Maybe I should cut it off

406
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,091
Cut it into pieces

407
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,823
Cut up your clothes

408
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,930
You want to flash again?

409
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,469
Left, right, left, right

410
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,044
Attention

411
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,475
Turn to the left

412
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,138
Right turn

413
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,108
Turn to the back

414
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,080
Stand still

415
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,614
Get set, ready

416
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,825
Don't run, stop

417
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,122
I'll shoot

418
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:46,332
Go... go... go

419
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,210
Thanks

420
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,378
Thanks everyone

421
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,083
Thanks

422
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,928
Stand still

423
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,126
Let me borrow this

424
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:24,864
Try again

425
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:27,970
Let me borrow this

426
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,049
Crazy

427
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,885
Got you

428
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:36,976
Sir

429
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,249
Sir, this guy is a streaker

430
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,256
You again? What's your problem?

431
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,030
Sir, look at my thigh

432
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,496
Am I Miss Hong Kong material?

433
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,462
Put it down

434
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,300
Do you have any idea

435
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,270
...what day is it today?

436
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,904
Your god mother's birthday?

437
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,903
My god father's birthday?

438
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,535
Wedding anniversary of them both?

439
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,314
No

440
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:06,316
Today is my unlucky day

441
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,251
You've been here twice,
what's the matter with you?

442
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:11,820
Nothing, sir

443
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,891
Sir, why isn't he...

444
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,425
wearing any pants?

445
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,189
PC1331

446
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:20,889
Yes, sir?

447
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,593
Get a piece a cloth for him

448
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,596
Yes, sir

449
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:25,970
Thanks

450
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,969
Listen, now I must charge you...

451
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,098
for indecent behavior in public

452
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,436
You have no money

453
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,511
And you said you have no relatives

454
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,307
Put him in the cell for a night

455
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,403
Go to court in the morning

456
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,572
Go

457
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,777
Sir

458
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,179
What?

459
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,774
Just speak up

460
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,150
I have no relatives

461
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,916
But I have a friend

462
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,081
I'll call him to bail me

463
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:50,160
Go on then, don't try anything funny

464
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,795
Brother Nine, you are so mean

465
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,398
If you want to collect my debt

466
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,500
See me in hell

467
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,804
Here I go

468
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,438
Damn it, I stepped out
for less than a minute

469
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,072
And someone broke my wind shield

470
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,276
LPG Gas can? Asshole

471
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,217
I will kill you if I see you

472
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:36,300
What now? I'm still alive?

473
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,053
Must be the robbers who dropped it

474
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,928
Hey, whaddya know!

475
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,892
Reckon it ain't my time to die yet

476
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:28,350
I struck gold

477
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,054
Spiritual tablet of my beloved daughter
Liu Ah Cui

478
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,593
Born on 7th Feb., 1958

479
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,386
Died on 2nd May, 1980

480
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,932
She's only 20 something

481
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,505
I thought it's made of gold

482
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,172
Such an unlucky thing

483
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,426
Who are you looking for?

484
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,087
You

485
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,893
Me? Do I know you?

486
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,529
I know you

487
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,765
Did you pick up...

488
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,895
a bag in the alley earlier?

489
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,236
No

490
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,935
What about this picture? Is this you?

491
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,513
Come in

492
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,848
So what?

493
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,222
What are you going to do?

494
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,190
I picked it on the street

495
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,962
Don't worry

496
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,938
I'm not here to collect the jewelry

497
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,067
And I've got more to offer

498
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,278
There's no free lunch in this world

499
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,808
That's for sure

500
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,184
Listen, my name is Liu San

501
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,311
This belongs to my daughter, Ah Cui

502
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,590
She was captured by the gangs
while entering...

503
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,418
Hong Kong illegally;
got tied up, raped and killed

504
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,427
Her body was dumped in the wild

505
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,394
I've watched that in the news

506
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,300
Listen well

507
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:02,065
She's my only daughter

508
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,936
After she's dead

509
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,009
I don't want her to be alone

510
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,476
Don't want her to be a wandering ghost

511
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,980
I must help her to find a husband

512
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,017
So that she won't be lonely

513
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:20,257
And what's that got to do with me?

514
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,855
Go advertise in the classifieds

515
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,760
It concerns you now that
you've picked up the bag

516
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,864
If you promise to marry her

517
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,830
I'll give everything to you

518
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,834
You haven't got a lot in here

519
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,038
I deserve more
for marrying a piece of wood

520
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,580
If you marry my daughter

521
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,214
...I'll be very generous

522
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,053
I'll give you a flat

523
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,348
which is already worth a few hundred grand

524
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,549
Below the peak,
across the Governor's house

525
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,348
Right of Queen Mary Hospital;
left of funeral home

526
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,121
Left, right, above, below

527
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,230
Where exactly is it?

528
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:03,994
Next to Kowloon Funeral parlor,
No. 2 Maple street

529
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,467
Has good vibes.
All in the neighborhood became rich

530
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:11,564
999 sq. Feet including the parking space

531
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,043
Let me think about it

532
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:19,874
999 sq. Feet including the parking space

533
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,851
That will be around a million

534
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,249
Old man, don't trick me

535
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,119
If you agree, we can go to a lawyer now

536
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,784
Deal

537
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,151
Master, your son-in-law

538
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,955
Please

539
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,571
The groom & bride, bow to heaven and earth

540
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,438
First bow, second bow

541
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,478
Please take a seat, bride's father

542
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,447
Please drink this, from the groom

543
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,316
Dad, please have some tea

544
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,916
Please

545
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,856
Have some tea, dear

546
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,458
Groom, please serve the tea
to your mother-in-law

547
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,260
Mom, please have some tea

548
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,127
Please

549
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,840
This is from my wife

550
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:50,804
Thanks

551
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:51,840
This is from me

552
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,136
Thanks, master

553
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:00,078
Groom, go have a drink
with the bridesmaids

554
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,051
Ladies

555
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,495
I'm here to raise a toast to you

556
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,760
Ladies, we don't have a big feast

557
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,368
I'm not a good host

558
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,027
Please help yourselves

559
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,105
Groom, bride,
please go to the bridal chamber

560
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,527
Good night

561
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,764
Good night

562
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,063
Thanks

563
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,262
Good night, master

564
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,936
From this day on

565
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,106
You are Ah Cui's husband now

566
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,920
In order for you to get along well

567
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,855
I must tell you about her habits

568
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,087
She's hot-tempered, knows Judo

569
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,823
You must treat her well

570
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,434
She likes to eat instant noodles
with fried eggs

571
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,270
You must cook for her every day

572
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,433
She likes a San Miguel before dinner

573
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,841
And a Guinness stout afterwards

574
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,345
That's good for health

575
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,883
She's lazy

576
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,886
She reads in bed and often leaves

577
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,512
...the light on at night

578
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,812
Electricity is expensive

579
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,483
Here's a switch

580
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,563
Clap once and the lights will turn off

581
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,427
Clap twice and it's on

582
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,238
Interesting. Where did you get it?

583
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,237
Lane Crawford

584
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,274
Well then, I won't bother you two

585
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,736
I'll drop by to see you sometime

586
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:09,904
Good night

587
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,915
You must be nuts

588
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,485
Made me marry a ghost!

589
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,113
Made me toast with a ghost. This is crazy

590
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,423
I am only in this for the money

591
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,062
Sick of your sight

592
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,332
Stay in here

593
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,176
Better turn in soon

594
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,559
Is this place haunted?

595
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,128
So it's you

596
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,496
You stupid dog

597
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:05,220
Didn't expect a dog here

598
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,122
Fine, since you're here before me...

599
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,352
You can live here

600
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,786
You just scared me a while back

601
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:20,225
Silly me. There are no ghosts on earth

602
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,162
Scared myself

603
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:30,311
Romeo and Juliet,
a pair of star crossed lovers

604
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,006
Hey, what's that terrible singing?

605
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:40,014
They won't be separated...

606
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:44,491
Won't be separated

607
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,096
Fine, stop it

608
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,226
You sound terrible

609
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,361
Sorry?

610
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,736
I told you to stop

611
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,005
What? This is Hong Kong

612
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,942
I can do whatever I like

613
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,310
Sing whatever I like

614
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,509
Listen

615
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,713
I come from the hills, carrying an orchid

616
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,985
I can dance too, look

617
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,416
A ball on the left, a ball on the right

618
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,052
I'm playing ping pong

619
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,829
Damn it

620
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,402
I'll show you

621
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,431
Go on, sing

622
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,411
You threw a tennis ball at me

623
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:36,535
See if you'll keep singing

624
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:48,450
Shake! From head to toes

625
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:55,431
Shake! Johnson's Baby Powder

626
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,057
Shake, shake, shake

627
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:02,538
Use Johnson's Baby Powder

628
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:04,940
Shake

629
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,509
You will feel like a baby
all through the day

630
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,041
It's great

631
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,302
Shake

632
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,353
Hey, Doggie?

633
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,822
What? I'm busy tonight

634
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:24,924
I've a date

635
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,257
I'm going to the disco with Ah Zhu

636
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,942
Hello

637
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,207
Miss Air Hostess

638
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,077
You must be busy
flying all around the places

639
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,882
Mister

640
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,016
You still haven't paid
the cleaning charges

641
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,991
Fine... 30 dollars, is it?

642
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:02,731
Thank you

643
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,032
Who is it?

644
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,538
It's me, Cai Tou

645
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,072
Hello, darling

646
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,415
Oh, Ah Zhu, look at you

647
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,079
You are sexy

648
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,323
...and hot

649
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,725
Let's go out for dancing, huh?

650
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,053
My daddy might lecture me

651
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,095
We'll play at home

652
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,491
Tell me whether you love me or not

653
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,134
Don't lie to me

654
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,104
I'm happy besides you

655
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,700
You have great legs

656
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,780
Let's go to the disco

657
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,849
Ah Zhu, let's go

658
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:53,915
Let's go

659
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:55,910
Why did you hit me?

660
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:57,752
Why?

661
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,714
You! We were married yesterday

662
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,848
And you're cheating on me

663
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,357
Listen, I'm here for you

664
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,825
That means you are looking for me

665
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,020
I...

666
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,321
She is she, I'm me

667
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,400
She's a slut, I'm Joan of Arc

668
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,728
We're not the same

669
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:12,934
What happened to your voice, who are you?

670
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,095
Your wife

671
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,797
Get back home now

672
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:17,800
Beat you up

673
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,139
Ah Zhu, it's me, Cai Tou

674
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,439
Get out, go home

675
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,446
Damn it

676
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,027
I don't believe this

677
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,293
It's only instant noodles...

678
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:11,827
not Shark's fin soup; big deal

679
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,995
Romeo and Juliet

680
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,161
Star Crossed lovers

681
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,000
Wishing to be in love forever

682
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,164
Stop it

683
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,732
Never will be apart

684
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:27,833
We...

685
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,745
I'm prepared

686
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,816
I've got a racket to block you

687
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,084
What do you say now?

688
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,919
I...

689
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,233
Are you serious, Cai Tou?

690
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:51,392
The ghost is so powerful?

691
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:52,767
I'm not kidding

692
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,996
It's scary

693
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,797
If that ghost...

694
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,501
really died a terrible death

695
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,267
like on the news

696
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,312
I'm sure she will haunt you forever

697
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,241
So unlucky

698
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,246
I'd have divorced her

699
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,317
...but I'm in it for the money

700
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,282
Don't worry

701
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,287
I'll think of something

702
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,717
It's simple

703
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:15,449
What?

704
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,220
Give me a thousand

705
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,988
I'll find you a psychic

706
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,155
And she can talk to the ghost

707
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,025
Are you kidding?

708
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,829
She can talk to the ghost?

709
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,868
I'm serious

710
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,302
Just pay up

711
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,339
Fine

712
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,744
Only one?

713
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:38,745
How much do you need?

714
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,340
An extra one, at least

715
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:47,215
The gods, the guards of hell

716
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,055
Liu Ah Cui, the illegal immigrant

717
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,129
who died earlier

718
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:56,289
Her husband Cai Tou

719
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,426
would like to have a chat with her

720
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:04,970
Come up here now

721
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,139
What's she doing?

722
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:12,711
Shut up

723
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,050
What's happening?

724
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,449
She's got possessed

725
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:17,721
Possessed?

726
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:25,992
Give me back my life

727
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,965
Where are you from, woman ghost?

728
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,805
I was an illegal immigrant

729
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:47,281
Why can't you rest in peace?

730
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:51,218
I've had a tough life

731
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:55,257
While I was trying to sneak
over the border

732
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,125
I got captured by a gang

733
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,790
They robbed my money

734
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:06,699
Raped me and then killed me

735
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:14,005
Barbwired my hands
and put my body in a carton

736
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,405
I died terribly

737
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:25,420
Why did you try to sneak over the border?

738
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:29,288
I wanted to look for Teresa Tang

739
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,492
Is she crazy?

740
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,992
For a pop singer?

741
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,170
Teresa Tang has lots of fans

742
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:45,332
You've come to the wrong place

743
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:49,902
Teresa Tang is not in Hong Kong

744
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,481
Go look for her elsewhere

745
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:58,380
Please leave my client alone

746
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:04,189
No, I can't

747
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:09,231
I must get my
Hong Kong identity card first

748
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,434
The decree of special pardon
doesn't apply now

749
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:14,203
You can't get the HKID card

750
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:15,702
Where can I go then?

751
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,172
No. 1 Pine Street

752
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,374
Give her some money and it might work

753
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,140
Go ask her

754
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:27,250
Ask her if she'll leave if we pay...

755
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:36,986
My friend, he said...

756
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,960
Would you leave if I pay you?

757
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,894
Yes

758
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:46,765
Open a bank account for me

759
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,061
Fixed savings or current account?

760
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,935
Even ghost asks for money

761
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:51,802
Exactly

762
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:55,036
I'll kill you if you won't pay

763
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:04,011
Let go of me...

764
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,994
You stepped on my toes

765
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,703
Who switched on the light? It's over

766
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:23,000
What now?

767
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:23,697
Turn it off...

768
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,069
You lied?

769
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:28,240
Asshole, you lied to me

770
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,313
Give me back my money

771
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,778
It's only a thousand

772
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,382
Think of it as helping a friend

773
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,042
Who's your friend? Pay up

774
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,252
I've spent it already

775
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,448
I've hired a crew, go

776
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:42,486
Listen

777
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,954
Don't trust anyone, idiot

778
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:46,252
Damn it

779
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,887
I don't want to see you again

780
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,871
My friend...

781
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,441
I ain't called
the Great Spiritual Master for nothing

782
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,209
Sit down

783
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,210
I'm the Great Spiritual Master

784
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,442
If there's something wrong...

785
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,882
Also...

786
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,782
Family problems

787
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:14,015
Possessed by ghosts, come to me

788
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,754
How do you know that?

789
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,226
Have a seat, my friend

790
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:33,841
You don't look so good

791
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,412
You're being haunted

792
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,410
A series of love problems

793
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,480
If I don't help...

794
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:46,119
You'll die tonight

795
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,986
Don't bluff

796
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,792
My friend

797
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:58,995
You didn't heed good advice.
Your time is up

798
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:03,198
What a shame!

799
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,096
I'll really die?

800
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:09,338
Yes, for sure

801
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,344
You can help?

802
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:14,042
Certainly

803
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,382
Are you for real?

804
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,713
I got duped yesterday

805
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,789
Don't worry, you can pay after the job

806
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,789
I won't take your money if it doesn't work

807
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:23,791
Don't bluff

808
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,795
I'll show you

809
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,896
Fine

810
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:33,161
The incense goes to the underworld

811
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,238
Here I'm calling the great exorcists

812
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,707
The Four Heavenly Kings

813
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:41,834
Assist me to expel the ghost

814
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,345
I'm here to capture the spirit

815
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,244
Only the spirit

816
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:50,820
The spirit of Ah Cui

817
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,121
Bless this rice

818
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,955
Bless this rice

819
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:03,260
I'm here to capture the spirit

820
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:04,859
Heavenly gods

821
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:09,905
This is urgent

822
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,446
One, two, three, four

823
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:58,346
Five, six, seven, eight

824
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:01,753
Liu Ah Cui, I must capture you

825
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:23,812
Ding, ding, ding

826
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:41,996
Ding, ding, ding

827
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,090
I must capture Liu Ah Cui

828
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,097
You can turn on the lights now

829
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,813
I've caught the ghost

830
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,991
Miss Liu, please forgive my rudeness

831
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,062
Mister, the ghost you told me to catch

832
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,963
...isn't a wandering ghost

833
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,963
She's the master of the house here

834
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,767
I can't catch her

835
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,439
She's kicking me out

836
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,370
Sorry, I'm off now

837
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,107
Master

838
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,964
You rotten man

839
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,003
Piece of shit

840
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:09,847
Lowlife

841
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:10,452
What?

842
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:14,019
You found an exorcist?

843
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:16,125
You think it's that simple?

844
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,689
You are possessed

845
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,296
Shut up

846
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:23,230
Sit down

847
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:28,200
You know who I am?

848
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,464
I'm your wife

849
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,874
Trying to dump me so soon?

850
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,069
You wish

851
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,406
Even if you're a ghost...

852
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,771
you should be reasonable

853
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,281
Reasonable?

854
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,908
We got married

855
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,351
You take me...

856
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,012
for a promiscuous woman?

857
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:50,092
Do you know what you're doing?

858
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:54,220
I married you

859
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,665
Good that you know

860
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,927
You eat and spend my money

861
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:02,004
You heartless man

862
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,165
You found an exorcist?

863
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:08,243
Dear, do you know that...

864
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,074
I've got to tend to my physical needs

865
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,245
You're like smoke

866
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,783
You have nothing for me

867
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,851
I sleep with the pillow every night

868
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,819
You want me to be a monk?

869
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,755
Not exactly

870
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:26,829
What then?

871
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,328
Don't you worry

872
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,865
You'll get lucky tonight

873
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,801
It's 1 a. M

874
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,962
Is she coming or not?

875
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,209
The exorcist lied

876
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:42,878
Time to sleep

877
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:02,965
Miss Air Hostess

878
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,794
You're back?

879
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,738
I'm here to serve you

880
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:14,969
My dear husband

881
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,077
You got possessed

882
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,145
Good, you're welcome here every night

883
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,637
Open

884
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,970
Open

885
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:42,241
Open

886
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,825
Come scrub my back, dear

887
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,055
Let me do it

888
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:02,821
The world of a real man full of vigour

889
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,328
Macho

890
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:11,099
Ladies and gentlemen

891
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,971
The plane has entered the eye
of the typhoon

892
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:16,807
We'll experience some turbulence

893
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:20,212
Please fasten your seat belts, thanks

894
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,078
Serious turbulence

895
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,420
There he goes again

896
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:39,934
Freeze

897
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,237
Don't worry, I'll take care of it

898
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,420
You've been my companion for so many years

899
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,247
Who would thought that you'd leave me

900
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:05,225
Now I'm all alone

901
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,830
Poor thing

902
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,007
The beautiful Shangri-La

903
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:28,845
Lovely Shangri-La

904
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,148
I'm deeply in love

905
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,721
Deeply in love

906
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,158
The beautiful Shangri-La

907
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,789
Lovely Shangri-La

908
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,764
I'm deeply in love

909
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:53,138
The women of Alishan are pretty

910
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:56,973
The men of Alishan are strong

911
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:03,815
Ah... ah...

912
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:07,320
The women of Alishan are pretty

913
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:11,291
The men of Alishan are strong

914
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:21,797
The women of Alishan are pretty

915
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,280
Let's see what
Freddy's weather forecast is

916
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,761
Sorry

917
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,964
Sorry? Should have said something

918
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,199
I'm all soaked

919
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,144
Miss Air Hostess

920
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,209
Oh, it's you

921
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,684
No garbage today

922
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,016
Bye

923
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:15,947
Don't you recognize me?

924
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,957
We've just met

925
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,823
I'm your wife

926
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,260
What? She's on you? You...

927
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,697
Get in

928
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,132
Let's begin

929
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:28,927
Please leave me alone, dear

930
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:29,696
Please leave me alone...

931
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,033
We haven't started yet

932
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,108
No, I want you now

933
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,708
Help...

934
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:39,144
Stop it, dear

935
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:42,940
Lie down...

936
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,041
No...

937
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:45,119
I want you

938
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:46,380
Dear

939
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,824
Please leave me alone this time

940
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:52,791
Strip

941
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,423
Let me help you

942
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:03,203
No, dear

943
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,235
Don't go

944
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:09,036
What are you doing?

945
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,305
Strip, hurry

946
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:12,642
Let go of me...

947
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,251
Stop it

948
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:21,018
I'll knock you out

949
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,181
Stop it

950
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:22,780
I'll knock you out

951
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:23,789
Don't worry

952
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:29,389
Let me show you some colors

953
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:45,779
It's all over

954
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:53,617
It's spring time

955
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:59,058
The flowers are blossoming

956
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,925
Careful, the paint is still wet

957
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:02,826
I know

958
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:05,893
The daffodils are blooming

959
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:10,336
So are the peonies

960
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:11,906
Here again

961
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:24,012
You've been walking in and out
of the toilet

962
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:25,142
Is your kidney alright?

963
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,357
So what if it isn't?

964
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,390
None of your business

965
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,084
I'm concerned

966
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:34,353
I'm more concerned about you

967
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,158
Are you a squint since birth?

968
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,665
Peeped at my sister in the shower
when I was little

969
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,063
That's what happened

970
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:42,101
Lucky you didn't go blind!

971
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:42,898
Quit the chit-chat

972
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:44,097
Get back to work

973
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,605
Why are you blocking the way?

974
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,640
Don't worry

975
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,802
If you think my eyes aren't working

976
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,811
...you're wrong

977
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,609
Look at the yellow...

978
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:56,810
the red and the black

979
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,285
The stains have ruined the wall

980
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:02,050
With my eyes

981
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,284
...and one brush

982
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:08,221
The yellow's gone

983
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:13,800
The red's gone, and the black's gone

984
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:16,234
All gone

985
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:19,001
Now the wall's clean

986
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:22,133
That's the power I wield

987
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:23,404
You know?

988
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,647
Fine, get back to work

989
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:27,182
I'm done talking to you

990
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:30,818
Don't look down on me

991
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,767
Let me get dolled up a bit

992
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,031
The nails, too

993
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,119
Who is it?

994
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,752
Me

995
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:15,694
What now?

996
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:19,325
I'm hot, open up

997
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:20,659
Who's hot?

998
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:24,237
I want you

999
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:29,105
Oh no, she's on him

1000
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,270
Not again

1001
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,642
What now?

1002
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,148
I can't take this anymore

1003
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,014
Hurry, I can't wait

1004
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,609
I'm doing a number one

1005
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:40,216
I'm in a hurry

1006
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,052
Come on

1007
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,023
It's over

1008
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,321
Hurry

1009
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:50,729
I want you

1010
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:51,855
Here you go

1011
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,265
I don't want this, I want yours

1012
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,169
Help

1013
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:56,396
Give it to me

1014
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:57,639
Help

1015
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:58,865
Don't you run away

1016
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,139
Wait, I want you

1017
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,711
Let me kiss you

1018
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:07,977
Kiss me, dear

1019
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,713
I want you, come back

1020
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:16,884
Stinks

1021
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:21,395
Are you sick of me now?

1022
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:22,891
You're a man

1023
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,732
I'm your wife, what are you talking about?

1024
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,700
No, you got possessed, that's all

1025
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,896
I'm not, I'm your wife

1026
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,370
No, you're not

1027
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:32,899
I'm serious

1028
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:34,839
I'm your legal wife

1029
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:36,205
Legal? Wait

1030
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:37,403
What do you want?

1031
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:38,407
I want to take a leak

1032
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:56,993
Hey, don't try to sneak away

1033
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,288
Come here

1034
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:02,036
Don't come down here

1035
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,231
Don't come down here

1036
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,143
No, I can't catch you

1037
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:09,403
It's dangerous

1038
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,336
It will break

1039
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:15,809
It will break

1040
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:19,046
Don't worry. It won't

1041
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:23,316
Sorry

1042
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,756
It's over

1043
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,038
If you want to visit tonight, dear

1044
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,670
...you better possess the air hostess

1045
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,011
Not the garbage woman, or the painter

1046
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,011
Then it will be a bitch next

1047
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,046
I won't be able to take it

1048
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,347
Please be considerate

1049
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:55,851
...or I'll die

1050
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,356
Click the chopsticks twice if you agree

1051
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:00,720
Yes?

1052
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,389
Great, you're so cute

1053
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:06,965
Here she comes

1054
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:08,796
It's open

1055
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:11,265
I'm going to have a good time tonight

1056
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:13,232
Let me fix the room first

1057
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:23,045
The hen marries to the pig

1058
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,119
He's no good

1059
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,121
If you've eaten something bad

1060
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,021
...you'll go to the toilet

1061
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:30,989
Toilet paper

1062
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:37,825
Brother Nine, it's you

1063
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:42,233
You sure have guts.
I told you to kill yourself

1064
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,135
And you're living a good life here

1065
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,641
I'm now an eunuch because of you

1066
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:50,768
How can you make it up to me?

1067
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,374
I'll fix it for you

1068
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,282
Fix it? I won't be here if I can fix it

1069
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,580
I'll pay you then

1070
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,247
That's easy for you to say

1071
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:03,881
Tell him what he owes me

1072
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:05,855
Asshole

1073
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:15,227
He owes $2,400,000

1074
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:17,667
You heard him

1075
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,239
I owe you a thousand

1076
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,036
How come? $2,400,000?

1077
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,269
What currency is that? Japanese Yen?

1078
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,303
I still haven't charged you
for my operation fees

1079
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,740
You think I'm the Hong Kong Bank?

1080
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:33,854
Brother

1081
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:34,978
Please don't

1082
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:39,321
It's not funny, don't

1083
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:40,258
That will kill me

1084
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,660
I want you to be like me

1085
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:45,359
Not a complete man
for the rest of your life

1086
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:47,625
Help

1087
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,897
Don't move

1088
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,639
Help

1089
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:52,297
Take it out

1090
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:53,305
Sure

1091
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,342
Help

1092
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:59,636
Please don't

1093
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,345
Don't move

1094
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:18,261
Why do you sound so strange?

1095
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,300
It's me, what?

1096
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:28,206
Take it out and I'll cut it off

1097
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,005
Cut it

1098
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:34,047
Let me cut it

1099
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,207
Let go of me...

1100
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:36,940
Cut it

1101
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:39,277
What are you doing?

1102
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,150
What? Let go of me

1103
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,296
Cut it

1104
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:00,734
Don't come near me

1105
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:01,737
I'll cut off yours

1106
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:02,571
Take away the knife

1107
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,942
You'll know what it's like

1108
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:07,179
Come on

1109
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,854
Your turn

1110
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,361
What are you doing?

1111
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,857
I got you

1112
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,759
Come on

1113
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,937
Are you alright, boss?

1114
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:29,901
Got you

1115
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:30,869
Help me, boss

1116
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:33,066
Don't worry, don't let go of him

1117
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:35,708
Pass it

1118
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:39,105
Trying to scare, huh!

1119
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:44,311
Bloody freak, you played a trick on me

1120
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,944
Trying to get yourself killed?

1121
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:00,934
Hello, let's fight

1122
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:07,734
Thank you

1123
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,007
What are you doing?

1124
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,578
Judo, karate

1125
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,853
Thanks, two more moves

1126
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:28,720
Power toss

1127
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,065
I'll do it myself

1128
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,569
Not enough?

1129
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:38,837
That's it

1130
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,640
This place is haunted

1131
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,369
Don't ever come back here

1132
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,077
Yes

1133
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:45,146
Go...

1134
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,178
Thank you

1135
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,878
Thank you

1136
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,057
Did you just move in?

1137
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:02,254
You want to check my ID card?

1138
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:03,696
Merciful Buddha

1139
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:25,343
Place your bets

1140
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:33,187
One, three, four, total eight, small

1141
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,818
I win

1142
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:38,028
Look, I told you it's gonna be small

1143
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,565
Seven times in a row, strange

1144
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,900
Play another round

1145
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:46,940
I've used up all my money

1146
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,135
Two hundred dollars

1147
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:50,669
There's a seat

1148
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:51,574
Whose is this?

1149
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,079
Mine. C'mon, pay up

1150
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:07,228
I'll win for sure this time

1151
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:09,564
Here I go

1152
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:18,367
What are you doing? Robbing?

1153
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,231
Give it to me

1154
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:23,710
Help, robbery

1155
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,837
Robbery... Help!

1156
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,381
Got some nerve!

1157
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:29,582
Return it

1158
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,352
I'll kill you

1159
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:35,054
Help

1160
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,715
Robbery

1161
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:40,952
Give it back to me

1162
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,655
I'll kill you

1163
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,190
You loser

1164
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,796
You steal from an old lady

1165
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:53,900
Don't let me see you again

1166
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:55,769
Are you alright, old lady?

1167
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:56,969
I'm fine

1168
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:00,110
Scared me

1169
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,307
You are a good man

1170
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,314
Robs an old lady? That's too much

1171
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,747
Let me help you up

1172
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,254
Don't move

1173
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:09,822
So you're a robber too

1174
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,051
Don't move, or I'll kill you

1175
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,161
You are broke

1176
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,196
What have we got here?

1177
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:25,366
Don't try anything funny

1178
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,871
...or I'll shoot

1179
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,069
Unzip now

1180
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,273
I'm not wearing any underwear

1181
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:34,006
I'll count to three

1182
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,777
Then I'll shoot

1183
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:38,180
One...

1184
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,550
Two...

1185
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,796
Great! I'm rich

1186
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:52,232
Stop nagging, kid

1187
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,596
Or you're dead

1188
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:54,900
Give me back my gold

1189
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,306
Let's go

1190
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:07,309
Sure

1191
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:33,037
Dear, I'm on a losing streak

1192
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:35,371
Got robbed by an old lady

1193
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,008
If you don't help me...

1194
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,078
this flat will soon be gone

1195
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,613
Then you won't have a place to live

1196
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:49,654
We're a married couple

1197
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,315
Help me to win, okay?

1198
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,161
There's no point to keep talking

1199
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:12,602
Click the chopsticks twice if you agree

1200
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,079
Thanks, dear

1201
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,048
Place your bets

1202
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,656
Place your bets

1203
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,919
I'm going to start, dear

1204
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,221
Shit

1205
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:30,831
Are you sure?

1206
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,331
Yes, I'm

1207
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:33,291
Look at this fool

1208
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,967
He bet on three sixes

1209
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,934
So stupid

1210
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,336
You are the fools
if you don't follow my lead

1211
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:40,801
No thanks

1212
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,269
Open

1213
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:47,678
Double sixes, one five,
seventeen total, big

1214
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,113
Only two sixes?

1215
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,692
My wife is lying again

1216
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:08,068
Damn it

1217
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:09,864
How could you do this to me?

1218
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,201
You said you'd help

1219
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,841
Darling. Calm down

1220
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,005
Don't you 'darling' me

1221
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:23,344
I want a divorce

1222
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:31,784
I want a separation

1223
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,660
I want to... sleep with you

1224
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,079
I don't get it, dear

1225
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:01,587
Sometimes you're a shrewd

1226
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,650
Now you're sweet as honey

1227
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,555
Of course. That's how women are

1228
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:11,191
Listen

1229
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,233
I went with you to the casino today

1230
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,893
But I couldn't go inside

1231
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:16,799
Why not?

1232
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,270
There's a Bodhisattva statue at the door

1233
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:20,905
A statue?

1234
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,533
It protects the place

1235
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:26,613
Then how can you get in?

1236
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:28,306
Get a oilpaper umbrella

1237
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,016
Put my spiritual tablet
inside the umbrella

1238
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:32,711
Then I can go in

1239
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:33,286
Is that so?

1240
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:34,577
Just do it

1241
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:48,367
What's with the umbrella? It's not raining

1242
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:49,695
I just bought this

1243
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:50,770
Got anything you shouldn't have?

1244
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,032
No, look

1245
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:53,840
Put it over there

1246
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:03,910
Dear Gods

1247
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:05,849
Please help me win

1248
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,186
You...

1249
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:18,697
Darling, I'm here

1250
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:22,325
Remember to bet on 3- sixes every time

1251
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:23,764
Got it

1252
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:25,934
Three sixes?

1253
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:26,904
Yes

1254
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:28,998
You're cute

1255
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,838
Why did you pinch me? Are you nuts?

1256
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:34,914
Never mind...

1257
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:43,321
Place your bets

1258
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,826
200 dollars on three sixes;
you'll lose for sure

1259
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,905
Did you see the banker?

1260
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:03,238
His face is green

1261
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,039
Shut up

1262
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:05,840
I've lost so much I'm turning green

1263
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:07,546
Big

1264
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,783
Open

1265
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,548
Three sixes

1266
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,818
Neither big nor small

1267
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:19,859
What happened to your voice?

1268
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,156
Nothing. Caught a cold last night

1269
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:23,690
This is unbelievable

1270
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:24,662
You should have followed me

1271
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:25,925
I don't believe it

1272
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:29,828
You're very lucky

1273
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,742
You're blushing...
you're about to win a lot

1274
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:41,609
Helps us out with a good tip

1275
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:46,320
Be generous

1276
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,953
I haven't seen three sixes for a long time

1277
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:50,781
Here's 10,000

1278
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:52,758
Here's 20,000

1279
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:54,817
Thanks...

1280
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,694
Thanks

1281
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,059
Thanks

1282
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:07,908
Place your bets

1283
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:11,977
The same

1284
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,247
Three sixes still?

1285
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:19,218
Fine, I'll follow. A dollar

1286
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:22,882
Open

1287
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,628
Three sixes

1288
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,533
He bets four hundred

1289
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:44,544
Struck gold

1290
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:46,876
Should have followed him

1291
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:48,946
So unbelievable

1292
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:52,347
He's won a lot

1293
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,050
Zhang, change the banker

1294
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:00,822
Move away, Cai

1295
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:02,255
Ming, come here

1296
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:13,330
Boss, the chair's wet

1297
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:15,075
It's something wicked

1298
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:19,945
Wait

1299
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,210
This table is closed temporarily

1300
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:25,877
Please move to another table

1301
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,555
That's not fair

1302
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:37,028
Darling, you've 90,000 dollars now.
Enough?

1303
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:39,926
Are you nuts? I'm on a roll

1304
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:41,634
It's difficult to bring you in

1305
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:45,864
Honey, what are they doing?

1306
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:49,003
I don't know, just go with the flow

1307
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:53,740
Darling

1308
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:56,908
What? Darling?

1309
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:58,645
I'm a man

1310
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:01,687
Who are you calling 'darling'?

1311
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:05,159
I'll try to win some more

1312
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:14,628
Sister, there's a gambler outside

1313
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:19,704
...who's on a winning streak

1314
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:23,537
Two rounds of three sixes

1315
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,669
He's won 90,000 already

1316
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:27,644
Go take a look

1317
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,715
Don't worry

1318
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:51,539
Cinnabar

1319
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:24,032
Kill

1320
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,531
Place your bets

1321
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:29,199
Place your bets

1322
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:43,876
Honey, this woman is powerful

1323
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:45,583
Try to possess her

1324
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:48,019
Hurry... place your bets

1325
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:52,189
Go on

1326
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,564
This is blocked

1327
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,064
Place your bets on other combinations

1328
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,690
That's the rule

1329
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:01,166
Let us bet on it

1330
01:29:01,269 --> 01:29:03,669
No

1331
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:04,738
Open

1332
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:18,747
I'm not scared of anything,
leave me alone!

1333
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,221
Fine

1334
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,297
Open

1335
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:42,008
So strange!

1336
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,578
That didn't count

1337
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:45,610
Take the money

1338
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:47,044
Another round

1339
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,574
You're good, bitch

1340
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:51,878
You could handle me

1341
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:55,679
Paper money for the dead

1342
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:09,999
It's been very evil today

1343
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:11,867
That's right

1344
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:13,564
What's next?

1345
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:14,675
The dice will pile up again

1346
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:16,140
No way

1347
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:17,711
I bet you five hundred dollars

1348
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:19,745
Fine

1349
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:21,611
Kill

1350
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:43,926
Place your bets

1351
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:45,895
Three sixes

1352
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,600
Open

1353
01:30:56,784 --> 01:31:00,720
Oh, piled up again. Take the money back

1354
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:01,117
So wicked

1355
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,085
Pay up

1356
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:03,914
Never guessed!

1357
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:05,582
Well?

1358
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:07,155
I'll stop now

1359
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,857
The bitch is good

1360
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:15,724
The guy is so wicked

1361
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,270
Be careful

1362
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:19,164
OK?

1363
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,303
Don't worry, boss

1364
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:25,136
I'll put up a good fight

1365
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:27,812
Fine, again

1366
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:44,222
Amazing

1367
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,163
There will be a good show

1368
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:48,859
Hex versus witchcraft

1369
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:27,031
Place your bets

1370
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:36,878
Three sixes

1371
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:39,845
Open

1372
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:46,159
One

1373
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:47,818
Six...

1374
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:48,257
One

1375
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:50,759
Six...

1376
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:55,267
Six...

1377
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:02,873
One

1378
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:16,086
Six...

1379
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,731
You don't need to work tomorrow

1380
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:38,042
The money

1381
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:46,680
My friend, I'm impressed

1382
01:33:46,787 --> 01:33:48,254
You're on a roll

1383
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:50,183
I've lost so much to you

1384
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:53,158
I hope you won't come here again

1385
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,090
Take the money

1386
01:33:54,929 --> 01:33:55,896
Thanks

1387
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:59,959
Close the table for today

1388
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:03,160
Boss, it's been very evil today

1389
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,772
Look, something's wrong with your mouth

1390
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:07,665
Wicked

1391
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:11,837
I smile when I see you

1392
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:14,909
You're gorgeous

1393
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:19,884
So happy to be with you

1394
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:25,185
It's late

1395
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:28,921
Where's my wife?

1396
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:45,303
What's this? Let me take a look

1397
01:34:49,884 --> 01:34:50,873
I struck gold

1398
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,713
How come?

1399
01:35:02,663 --> 01:35:03,960
It's late, dad. What are you doing here?

1400
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:06,727
I'm not here for you

1401
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,926
My daughter has changed her mind

1402
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:11,561
She likes the muscular type

1403
01:35:14,341 --> 01:35:15,308
Then I don't have a wife anymore?

1404
01:35:15,576 --> 01:35:18,807
Don't worry, my daughter
has taken care of that

1405
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:19,675
Look

1406
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,282
You

1407
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:27,052
I'm so in love with you

1408
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:34,286
Can you believe my luck?
