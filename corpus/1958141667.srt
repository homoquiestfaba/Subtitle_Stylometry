1
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,519
Being hungry all the time

2
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,600
is humanity's worst tragedy.

3
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,640
The first time I ate a mouse,

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,719
I thought,
I need to eat this to survive.

5
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,439
We had nothing to eat and
we certainly couldn't buy medicine.

6
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,360
So they laid me to one side,
waiting for me to die.

7
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,719
I was hung upside down

8
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,119
and beaten for 14 hours.

9
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,159
We never knew when we'd get beaten.

10
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,600
There was constant fear.

11
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,599
We never imagined anyone

12
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,480
could sell and buy people.

13
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,959
I'm filled with hatred of North Korea

14
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,880
that murdered my family.

15
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,879
My family has believed in God
for generations.

16
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,840
They were all arrested.

17
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,920
From my early years in the military,

18
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,439
what I remember most
is robbing people

19
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,039
in the villages when we got hungry.

20
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,599
I saw my friends
fighting for their breath,

21
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,080
and right in front of my eyes,
they'd die.

22
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,799
If the person who created
such a place isn't a criminal,

23
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
I don't know who is.

24
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,680
North Korea is the most isolated
country in the world.

25
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,760
Famine and food shortages
have killed millions since 1994.

26
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,040
Repression is total.

27
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,480
The government operates a
system of concentration camps.

28
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Prison Camp Locations

29
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,080
Escape is punishable by death.

30
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,519
I escaped on February 1st, 2001.

31
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,760
I went through China, Vietnam,
Cambodia and Thailand.

32
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,799
You had to bribe the police for
a pass to travel toward the border.

33
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,520
I sold everything I owned. I bought
the travel pass with the money.

34
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,480
I crossed the border at night.

35
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,479
If you didn't bribe,

36
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,519
you would get caught.

37
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,439
If you got caught,

38
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,640
you were shot to death.

39
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,679
These are the stories of
people who fled North Korea

40
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,920
between 1992 and 2006.

41
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,960
Such events
are still happening today.

42
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,319
MRS. KIM

43
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,439
She was a dancer in North Korea.

44
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,520
Her best friend became
Kim Jong-Il's lover.

45
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,560
The friendship cost her everything.

46
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,439
You could say I was sent to prison

47
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,319
for knowing the private lives
of powerful men.

48
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,719
One guy was imprisoned

49
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,559
for saying
Kim Il-Sung had a lump in his neck.

50
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,560
One had spread a newspaper with
Kim Il-Sung's picture on the floor.

51
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,960
One was in for listening
to South Korean radio.

52
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,959
We were all deported,

53
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,079
my parents and my four kids,

54
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,720
2 years old, 4 years old,
7 years old, and 9 years old.

55
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,719
I was released from Yodok prison camp
after 8 and 1/2 years.

56
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,080
One of my sons had died,

57
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,799
and I gave up my daughter
for adoption after leaving the camp.

58
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,080
Otherwise, she would have been
stigmatized and unable to marry.

59
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,159
I don't know what happened
to my husband.

60
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,320
For the last 35 years,
I've wondered if he's still alive.

61
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,040
I don't even know what his crime was.

62
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,119
One of my sons tried to escape in '89

63
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,120
but was caught
at the border and shot.

64
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,159
I had such mental trauma.

65
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,079
My mother and father
died of starvation

66
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,479
in Yodok prison camp.

67
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,359
My first son drowned in a river,

68
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,120
on the way back from camp school.

69
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,480
I'm so filled with hatred and anger.

70
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,999
My last son was captured twice

71
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,159
and tortured so much
his lungs filled with blood.

72
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,759
He was released
because he was nothing but a shell.

73
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,199
He's still hospitalized,
handicap level-2.

74
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,879
He can't breathe.

75
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,999
How can anyone praise Kim Jong-il?

76
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,759
I'm filled with hatred
for North Korea.

77
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,279
They murdered my family.

78
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,519
I can't live without tears.

79
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,719
My heart aches.
He left me alone in the world.

80
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,640
Cursed Kim Jong-il.

81
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,440
The Kim dynasty has ruled
North Korea for 60 years.

82
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,719
The Great Leader Kim Il Sung

83
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,760
President for Life

84
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,920
They had us all worship him as a god.

85
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,079
Christians say grace
before their meals.

86
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,639
We said grace to Kim Il Sung.

87
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,479
He was like a supreme being

88
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,520
so we thought he didn't even pee.

89
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,520
He was our father's father
and our mother's father.

90
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,600
The most revered one.

91
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,439
On April 15th, 1912,
Kim Il-Sung was born.

92
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,240
The Almighty Sun hath risen.

93
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,400
We were so lucky to worship
the 21st Century's Sun.

94
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,319
In one generation, he defeated
two great imperial powers.

95
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,759
In our 5000 year history,
he was the first to do that.

96
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,519
He's our nation's hero.

97
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,880
That's what we were taught.

98
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,359
He can travel miles
while sitting down.

99
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,679
Kim Il-Sung has superhuman powers.

100
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,679
He'd appear simultaneously
in the east and the west.

101
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,959
Kim Il-Sung can fly north,

102
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,039
south, east and west.

103
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,079
He appeared like a star

104
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,599
and we worship him like the Sun.

105
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,800
So April 15th
became the Day of the Sun.

106
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,999
In 1994, Kim Il Sung died.

107
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,919
His son Kim Jong Il took power.

108
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,919
I thought the world was ending.

109
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,719
What would we do?

110
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,599
Without him, nothing could be right.

111
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,439
I absolutely thought he was divine.

112
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,359
Just replace Kim Il-Sung with God.

113
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,920
That's our religion.

114
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,720
We were totally brainwashed.

115
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,040
If I were still there,
I would still worship him.

116
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,240
I'd also worship his son,
Kim Jong-il.

117
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,039
The Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il

118
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,199
The General

119
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,359
I thought of the Great Leader
as a father,

120
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,080
so how could he let his people
live like this?

121
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,239
I jumped off the train.

122
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,240
I had boarded the train to Hae-San.
It was winter.

123
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,760
The train was going uphill,
so it was slow.

124
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,959
There was a lot of snow
on the ground,

125
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,959
so we didn't get hurt.

126
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,639
I didn't know where we were,
but everyone was jumping off,

127
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,360
so I jumped with the others.

128
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,599
My childhood was happy.

129
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,199
I had five or six aquariums
with all kinds of fish.

130
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,599
We kids all competed to see

131
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,479
who had the best fish.

132
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,999
One fish had bulging eyes.

133
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,640
That was the most prized,

134
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,240
and I looked all over for it.

135
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,079
KANG CHOL-HWAN

136
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,960
His grandfather was arrested
for an unnamed crime.

137
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,480
North Korean practice
is to purge three generations.

138
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,679
Kang, his grandmother,
father, uncle,

139
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,920
and little sister
were taken to Yodok prison camp.

140
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,879
The soldiers' tone was so harsh.

141
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,319
I was getting frightened.

142
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,719
Kang screamed so much,

143
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,920
the soldiers let him take one
of his beloved aquariums.

144
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
He was 9 years old.

145
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,879
The iron gates opened.

146
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,160
The soldiers were armed.

147
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,919
I began to feel real fear.

148
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,199
Everyone was so skinny.

149
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,719
The children were so weak
and fragile.

150
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,600
They were in rags.

151
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
At first, I dried bugs for my fish.

152
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,399
That's how I fed them.

153
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,439
But when I started forced labour,

154
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't have time for them.

155
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,600
I had no time to cry.

156
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,040
Every day was so tiring.

157
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,080
We worked so hard.
I was so cold.

158
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,559
You don't care about your pet fish

159
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,720
when you're dying.

160
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,159
I was bitter.

161
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,800
Everything I treasured was gone.

162
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,319
The worst job was mining.

163
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,199
In my ten years in the gulag,

164
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,639
the best job I ever had
was taking care

165
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,719
of the beehives
for the high officials.

166
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,239
The only bad part
was that we were isolated.

167
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,359
At night we were lonely,
but we found some books.

168
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,199
There were smuggled books
circulating in the camp.

169
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,079
"The Count of Monte Cristo".

170
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,599
"Anna Karenina", "Resurrection".

171
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,479
I think "The Count of Monte Cristo"
touched me the most.

172
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,399
- He looks dead.
- He is dead.

173
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,519
We'll get the undertakers.

174
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,439
Reading "Monte Cristo"
gave me the idea

175
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,720
to escape North Korea.

176
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,120
If I ever got out,
I'd take revenge like him.

177
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,479
Holding to his duty
to be loyal to the leader,

178
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,039
Kim Jong-Il said,

179
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,359
"Nobody in the world
has ever dedicated all his life

180
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,280
to the people's cause
for so many years

181
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,520
and undergone so many hardships
as our leader has done.

182
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,679
Whenever I think of the leader
working restlessly

183
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,559
for the People's happiness,
I feel my eyes moisten.

184
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,760
I wrack my brains to take the load
from his mind and make him happy.

185
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,320
SHIN DONG-HYUK

186
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,880
He was born
in Total Control Prison Camp 14.

187
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,360
He never knew
why his parents were there.

188
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,919
They had fenced off a large area

189
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,079
with barbed wire
and built housing and factories.

190
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,159
You don't live behind bars in cells.

191
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Within a confined area,
you'd do the work you were assigned.

192
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,919
There were coal mines and farmlands,

193
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,119
and jobs where you cut down trees.

194
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Or we were assigned
to sweat shops and other factories.

195
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,520
Camp school was simple.

196
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,960
They taught us how to dig for coal

197
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,999
and how to transport it.

198
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,959
During Korean class,

199
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,799
we learned how to read and write.

200
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,800
In math,
we only learned to add and subtract.

201
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,399
After roll call,

202
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,720
you'd recite the rules of the sector.

203
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,400
RULES OF THE SECTOR

204
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,959
Any prisoner who does not do his best
to complete the assigned work,

205
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,200
will be presumed
to have an attitude...

206
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,920
and will be executed
by firing squad immediately.

207
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,959
Any prisoner who steals
or hides food will be executed

208
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,040
by firing squad immediately.

209
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,599
Any prisoner who disobeys...

210
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,159
or does not obey diligently...

211
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,480
will be executed
by firing squad immediately.

212
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,319
Any prisoner who tries to run away,

213
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,640
or fails to report someone
else's attempted escape...

214
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,880
will be executed immediately.

215
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,599
On November 29th, 1996,

216
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,999
after my mother and brother died,

217
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,280
only me and my father were left.

218
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,119
SHIN was forced to watch

219
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,040
his mother and brother
publicly executed.

220
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,279
Older people or intellectuals

221
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,999
committed suicide.

222
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,040
But almost none of the kids did.

223
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,039
We never knew when we'd get beaten.

224
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,120
There was constant fear.

225
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,999
If you didn't work hard enough,

226
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,599
you got punished by the guards.

227
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,119
They cut your food ration.

228
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,919
Sometimes they'd cut it in half.

229
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Sometimes they'd make you
completely starve.

230
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,160
North Korean Film

231
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,840
North Korea's economy depends
partly on forced labor.

232
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,160
Some products made in prison camps:

233
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,880
army uniforms

234
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,200
bricks

235
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,080
leather shoes

236
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,440
snake liquor.

237
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,760
Some forced-labor products
have been exported:

238
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,880
doilies to Poland

239
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,720
paper flowers to France

240
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,720
bras to Russia.

241
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,919
A guy from Pyongyang
came to the camp.

242
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,839
Usually, we didn't talk to outsiders.

243
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,559
He was afraid too.
But we worked together.

244
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,560
We started trusting each other.

245
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,039
He told me
what his life had been like.

246
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,360
His life in Pyongyang.

247
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,999
The best stories were about eating.

248
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,839
After I heard his stories,

249
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,759
the camp became totally unbearable.

250
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I asked him to tell me the stories
over and over.

251
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,839
I came up with the idea of escaping.

252
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,079
"Let's try to escape."

253
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,440
So we planned it together.

254
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,679
On January 2nd, 2005,

255
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,599
we said we were going
to collect firewood.

256
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,679
I knew we could get shot
or electrocuted,

257
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,559
but right then,
I was full of confidence.

258
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,599
When January 2nd came,
we climbed the mountains.

259
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,999
I saw the guards
and the barbed wire gates.

260
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,520
All of a sudden I was afraid.

261
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,479
I was shaking, losing my nerve.

262
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,919
And then my friend said,

263
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,319
"I don't think we can do it.
You're scared and I'm scared."

264
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,159
But I couldn't give up.
I had to escape.

265
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,559
We were about 20 meters

266
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,760
from the gates.

267
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,359
It had been 15 minutes
since the guard passed.

268
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,919
We had to run.

269
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,199
I practically dragged him.

270
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,839
I was one step ahead of him

271
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,279
as we approached the gates.

272
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,119
He was following,

273
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,279
and then I slipped in the snow,

274
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,640
so he ran ahead of me.

275
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,839
When I saw the wired gates,

276
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,079
I figured he was squeezing

277
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,480
through the electric wires.

278
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,119
So I followed his lead

279
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,479
and squeezed through too.

280
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,359
When I got up and looked behind me,

281
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,519
I realized
I was on the other side of the gates.

282
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,919
Then I saw my friend was stuck

283
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,159
and didn't move.

284
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,679
He was still stuck in the wires.

285
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,359
Right then,

286
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,519
all I could think was I had to run.

287
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,839
Run down the mountain away
from the gates.

288
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,399
I was all the way down
when I realized

289
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,159
maybe he was electrocuted.

290
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,520
If I hadn't fallen,

291
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,839
I would have been the first
to squeeze through the electric wire.

292
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,440
I would have been
the one electrocuted.

293
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,599
SHIN DONG-HYUK

294
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,439
Born in Total Control Camp 14

295
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,520
Escaped in 2005 at age 24

296
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,399
The whole nation
is run by Kim Jong-il

297
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,119
and his gang.

298
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,080
The camps,
the starvation, everything.

299
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,679
And the North Korean people

300
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,279
continue to suffer.

301
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,439
There will be more and more victims

302
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,760
until you change the system.

303
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,199
KANG CHOL-HWAN

304
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,919
10 years in Yodok,
released in 1987

305
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,079
fled North Korea in 1992

306
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,520
first to expose
the existence of camps

307
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,079
1910

308
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,920
Japan colonized Korea

309
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,199
1913

310
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,079
Kim Il Sung is born
to a Christian Family.

311
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,120
His grandfather
is a Protestant minister.

312
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,799
1919-1940

313
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,199
Korean freedom fighters,
aided by the Church,

314
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,680
resist the Japanese.

315
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,719
1932

316
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,520
Kim Il Sung joins the resistance
and adopts communism.

317
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,319
1935

318
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,519
The Japanese put a price
on Kim Il Sung's head.

319
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,679
1941
He flees to the Soviet Union.

320
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,439
1945

321
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,439
The Allies defeat Japan
in World War II.

322
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,080
The Soviets and Allies
divide Korea along the 38th parallel.

323
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,719
1948

324
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,759
Kim Il Sung founds the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea

325
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,640
as a Marxist state.

326
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,519
1950

327
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,759
North Korea attacks South Korea.

328
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,559
1950-1953

329
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,720
The Korean War brings
widespread destruction and death.

330
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,960
Kim Il Sung blames Americans.

331
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,519
1953

332
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,200
Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
established along the 38th parallel.

333
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
No peace treaty is signed.

334
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,359
1950's-1970's

335
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,839
Kim Il Sung and the Korean
Workers Party rebuild

336
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,079
North Korea and establish
a Worker's Paradise.

337
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,520
Free from Oppression and Hunger.

338
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,760
In North Korea, an artist
is an instrument of the Party.

339
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,560
He's a mouthpiece for the system.

340
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,200
KIM CHEOL-WOONG
CONCERT PIANIST

341
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,760
If your head's not Red,
you can't proclaim the Red.

342
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,719
The children of the upper class,
those loyal to Kim Jong-il

343
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,360
are the only ones admitted
to the music conservatory.

344
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,679
Your family background is everything.

345
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,200
As a kid, I didn't know
my class background was bad.

346
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,199
If there's a political prisoner
in your family

347
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,679
and you make even a tiny mistake,

348
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,680
it gets blown way out of proportion.

349
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,920
LEE SHIN
SINGER

350
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,119
In North Korea,
no matter how talented you are,

351
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,920
if your class background is bad,
you're stuck.

352
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,159
They said my voice

353
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,159
was like a South Korean pop singer's.

354
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,319
My voice was unacceptable

355
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,439
in North Korea,

356
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,400
because it sounded capitalist.

357
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,439
We thought ours was the only kind
of music in the world.

358
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,199
When I was sent to Russia to study,

359
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,799
I was stunned to find out

360
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,800
how restricted we were.

361
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,759
Everything I thought
I knew was a lie.

362
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,799
It was a rude awakening.

363
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,879
Our country knowingly taught us lies.

364
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,079
The turning point was when I played

365
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,320
a piece by Richard Clayderman.

366
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,039
Someone heard and reported me.

367
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,799
Even if you just listened to music

368
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,839
from capitalist countries,

369
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,080
you'd get arrested.

370
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,079
My whole life

371
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,519
was dedicated to the piano,

372
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,559
but I couldn't play what I wanted.

373
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,880
I decided to escape.

374
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,719
I was starving

375
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,199
and tightening my belt
around my belly.

376
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,799
We pretended we were pretty
and our stomachs were full.

377
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,479
We sang, "How shall we spread
this bountiful rice?"

378
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,319
We sang a lot of songs like that,
with a smile.

379
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,320
I don't understand even now.

380
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,080
Early on, the government
dictated agricultural policies.

381
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,040
Food shortages began
in the 1980's.

382
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,279
1989: demise of the Soviet Union

383
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,279
1994: famine declared

384
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,240
1995: devastating floods

385
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,360
By the mid-90's,
starvation was widespread.

386
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,840
Nevertheless, the Party
ordered farmers to grow opium.

387
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,199
Because of The Great Famine in 1994,

388
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,999
we were having a very hard time.

389
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,839
We'd go to the mountains

390
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,079
to pick roots.

391
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,080
We ate grass from the fields
and bark from the trees.

392
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,639
BYEON OK-SUN

393
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,559
She lived with her parents,
3 brothers,

394
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,239
and sister in a northern town.

395
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,000
The only source of food was
the state-run distribution system.

396
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,360
By the time she was 17,
that system had collapsed.

397
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,479
One day, I was with
my father in the mountains.

398
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,879
I got soaked with rain

399
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,120
while we were foraging.

400
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,319
After we finished, I went home.

401
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,359
My body started
to burn and I fainted.

402
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,239
We had nothing to eat

403
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,039
and we certainly
couldn't buy medicine.

404
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,080
So they laid me to one side,
waiting for me to die.

405
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,079
I had typhoid fever

406
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,720
and was in a coma.

407
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,839
When the food rations stopped
in the late 1980's,

408
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,840
people's lives completely changed.

409
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,199
People started selling
household items,

410
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,079
like TVs, electronics, and furniture.

411
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,599
People would sell
anything to buy food.

412
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,719
When everything was gone,

413
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,239
they'd sell their homes.

414
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,719
They didn't think of stealing.

415
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,439
There was nothing to steal.

416
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,440
They were the first to die.

417
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,639
They say man is selfish by nature.
Do you think so, too, Si Nae?

418
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,160
No, that's a lie. Babies are not.

419
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,159
My brother-in-law's
written from abroad

420
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,760
about the sad state there.

421
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,039
How ugly things are turning there!

422
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,720
What would the revolutionary martyrs
say if they were alive?

423
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,920
NORTH KOREAN FILM
GIRLS IN MY HOMETOWN

424
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,839
My home is in Anbyon,

425
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,479
Kangwon Province.

426
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,119
A nice place to live in

427
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,679
with its abundant fruit.

428
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,159
Rich crops sway in breeze.

429
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,999
Persimmon trees bear
plentiful fruits in every house.

430
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,439
Come to see our village.

431
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,520
You can meet pretty girls here.

432
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,640
1991: "Let's Eat Two Meals a Day"
campaign

433
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,919
1995: North Korea
asks for international aid

434
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,279
$2.5 billion sent -
North Korea demands control

435
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,519
30% to 70% diverted to the elite

436
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,319
Humanitarian organizations
withdraw in frustration

437
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,320
Estimated number of dead:
600,000 to 3,500,000

438
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,839
Taking care of corpses
was the biggest problem

439
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,799
towards the end of '95.

440
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,639
This problem was even reported
to Kim Jong-il,

441
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,399
so he stationed military units

442
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,039
in each town.

443
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,199
They weren't armed.

444
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,879
The soldiers loaded corpses
into their military trucks

445
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,559
around the clock.

446
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,399
The bodies were rotting.

447
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,439
We didn't escape
because we wanted to.

448
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,840
We had to.

449
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,320
I crossed over
to get medical treatment.

450
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,640
My brother carried me on his back.

451
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,880
I'd been in China for a month
when I came out of the coma.

452
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,639
I woke up in an empty room,
alone except for an old woman.

453
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,639
I was scared.

454
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,720
She said, "You're in China."

455
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,559
"How did I get here?"

456
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,759
She told me my brothers
carried me on their backs.

457
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,439
My brothers had gone to find work

458
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,559
to pay for the treatment.

459
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,200
They left me with her.

460
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,159
Most Chinese were afraid. Very few
were willing to hide defectors.

461
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,919
The woman said she'd protect
the weakest of us four,

462
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,279
so I stayed.

463
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,439
My older sister and 2 brothers
scattered to make their own ways.

464
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,679
It was my oldest brother's duty

465
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,039
to take care
of his parents and siblings.

466
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,399
His sense of duty toward our parents
was very strong.

467
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,159
No matter where he was,

468
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,639
in North Korea or China,

469
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,160
he felt that responsibility.

470
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,839
He took me on his back to save me.

471
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,039
After he saved me in China,

472
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,319
with our parents back in North Korea,
he felt very tortured.

473
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,839
He'd get food
and take it back to our parents.

474
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,039
He was constantly
sneaking back and forth.

475
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,999
Then somehow,

476
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
the National Intelligence Service,

477
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,599
caught him making trips to China.

478
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,679
When he realized they were on to him,

479
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,639
he decided to give himself up.

480
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,439
If you give yourself up,

481
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,959
you expect to receive
a lighter sentence.

482
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,719
That's what he thought.

483
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,279
Instead, he was taken

484
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,520
and publicly executed.

485
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,919
The fact that they killed a person
like him, it's hard to deal with.

486
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,160
Even now. He's my brother...

487
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,319
I feel so guilty.
My big brother's death was...

488
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,840
I feel he died because of me.

489
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,079
I live with a guilty conscience

490
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,360
all the time.

491
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,919
They kill people without mercy.

492
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,879
They don't even feel any guilt.

493
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,319
I know it's the country of my birth,

494
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,440
but I really hate it.

495
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,320
I don't want
to live there ever again.

496
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,880
Those feelings are strong.

497
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,079
The kimjongilia,
or flower of Kim Jong Il,

498
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,880
was created for the Dear Leader's
46th birthday.

499
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,800
They say it represents love,
peace, wisdom, and justice.

500
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,720
LOVE PEACE
WISDOM JUSTICE

501
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,359
The military suffered too.

502
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,679
The state only supplied us
with rice and salt.

503
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,119
We had to get
everything else ourselves.

504
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,679
We started to grow beans
on our basketball courts

505
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,239
and soccer fields.

506
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,159
The soldiers learned to
survive without eating fat.

507
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,519
On Kim Jong-il's birthday,

508
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,319
they'd give the ghastly-looking
skinny soldiers a piece of pork.

509
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,639
They'd eat it and get diarrhea.

510
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,079
They said soldiers died
of uncontrollable diarrhoea.

511
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,240
That's nonsense. It was malnutrition.

512
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,519
When I was serving in the military,

513
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,519
the malnourished soldiers

514
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,320
were admitted to the infirmaries.

515
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,559
The infirmaries

516
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,120
held 200 to 300 patients.

517
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,799
They'd shave everyone's heads
with razors.

518
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,320
You couldn't distinguish men
from women.

519
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,239
Women's periods stopped
due to malnutrition.

520
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,760
These days, many officers desert.

521
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,040
Even if you want to work,
there are always supplies missing.

522
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,119
Making it impossible to do the job.

523
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,959
But commanders go on

524
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,439
issuing orders every day.

525
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,599
You have to steal
the supplies you need.

526
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,639
This is the current situation
in North Korea.

527
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,959
If you care at all, it is impossible

528
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,999
not to express your frustration.

529
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,480
Consequently, many are arrested.

530
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,639
PARK MYUNG-HO

531
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,799
He was a captain
in the Korean People's Army.

532
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,960
He served for 20 years.

533
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,120
His father was a soldier too.

534
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,159
Ever since I became an officer,

535
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,799
I have felt this so-called "country"

536
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,319
has been made so tragic and horrific.

537
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,279
I held so much resentment
toward the government.

538
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,399
Really.
For about 10 years, I brooded.

539
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,520
That's what drove me to escape.

540
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,239
If we went through China,

541
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,399
the whole family
would have had to separate,

542
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,959
so we decided to cross

543
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,840
the 38th parallel by boat.

544
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,999
On the evening of May 23rd, 2006,
I saw a thick fog rolling in.

545
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,880
I could tell it would last
two or three days.

546
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,839
At around 10 that night,

547
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,960
we sailed for the 38th parallel.

548
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,759
We evaded Navy ships twice.

549
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,800
Because our boat was small
and theirs were big,

550
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,359
we could see them first

551
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,240
and get away.

552
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,639
Actually, the North Korean ships
had no fuel.

553
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,040
They couldn't start their engines
and were under sail.

554
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,320
I covered all the metal on our boat

555
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,240
with blankets to block their radar.

556
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,999
We landed in Incheon City,
Ong-jin province.

557
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,919
When I saw all the trees
on the mountains,

558
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,880
I knew we were in South Korea.

559
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,559
PARK MYUNG-HO

560
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,079
TOOK HIS FAMILY OVER 200 MILES
THROUGH DANGEROUS WATERS

561
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,080
REACHED SOUTH KOREA IN 2006

562
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,520
Tumen River border between
North Korea and China

563
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,200
300,000 people have fled
North Korea in the last 10 years.

564
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,880
Because the DMZ is impassable,
most go to China.

565
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,040
There are approximately 2,000,000
ethnic Koreans living in China.

566
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,759
I heard rumours

567
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,319
that people escaped to China.

568
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,039
I went with money

569
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,760
I brought from home.

570
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,920
I had about $2000 that I...

571
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,479
I guess you'd have to say I stole it.
I stole it and took off.

572
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,239
I used the money
to bribe the National Border Control.

573
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,840
They guided me
across the river to China.

574
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,679
I just recklessly went
to the first ethnic Korean village

575
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,479
across the border.

576
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,159
I proudly announced I was
a concert pianist from Pyongyang.

577
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,559
They didn't care
about my piano playing,

578
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,719
they wanted my physical strength.

579
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,639
From that day on,

580
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:14,240
I became their servant.

581
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,039
I went to find my older sister.

582
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,879
She had escaped to China,
so it was too dangerous for me

583
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,839
to continue appearing on stage.

584
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,319
We found out

585
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,480
she had been sold to traffickers.

586
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,279
So we went to find her
but couldn't,

587
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,439
and wound up stuck there.

588
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,559
We had a "guide"

589
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,839
who claimed
he was looking for her.

590
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,719
In fact, he was selling us

591
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,879
to traffickers too.

592
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,039
We didn't know

593
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,040
we were being sold.

594
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,079
They said the police were after
us and we had to flee.

595
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,359
But it was a lie to trap us.

596
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,520
They were going to sell us.

597
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,879
In the taxi, I cried and pleaded,

598
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,080
but no one saved us.

599
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,440
In China, I gave up being human.

600
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,559
Because we were North Koreans,
we were defenceless.

601
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,359
All kinds of women

602
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,159
from 16 to 40 years old

603
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,120
were sold.

604
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,439
We were beaten for no reason

605
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,080
and couldn't defend ourselves.

606
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,399
The men would get drunk

607
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,359
and violent.

608
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,160
The girls

609
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,639
would try to escape

610
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,840
and get caught.

611
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,639
I was desperate.

612
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,919
I decided to risk crashing

613
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,519
the South Korean Embassy in Beijing.

614
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,879
I faced down the police.

615
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,079
My mom, my sisters and I

616
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,759
made it inside safely.

617
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,560
I don't know
where I got the strength.

618
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,399
LEE SHIN

619
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,999
5 YEARS IN SEXUAL SLAVERY

620
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,280
REACHED SOUTH KOREA IN 2003

621
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,719
We were constantly
in danger in China.

622
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,959
You can't walk around openly.

623
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,919
If you're caught, you're sent back.

624
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,119
I slept in a storage room
like this one.

625
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,759
The police even patrolled there.

626
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,279
They were uniformly brutal,

627
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,199
demanding ID or family papers.

628
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,519
Ethnic Koreans who protected us

629
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,439
were fined

630
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,479
if they were caught by the police.

631
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,399
There's a detention centre in China

632
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,600
for defectors.

633
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,239
I was held there
for about four months.

634
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,879
They torture you until you admit
you're a defector.

635
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,959
I was hung upside down

636
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,399
and beaten for 14 hours.

637
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,319
I was so worried about my hands

638
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,799
I tucked them tightly in my armpits.

639
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,760
I thought, I can't ruin my hands.

640
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,039
Small groups
of South Korean Christian activists

641
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,720
attempt to spirit defectors
out of China.

642
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,000
Shenyang, China
500 miles from North Korean border

643
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,720
an actual mission

644
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,840
rescue mission office -
February, 2008

645
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,560
going to meet NK defectors

646
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,160
Back. Back

647
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,920
Over there.

648
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,199
Defector pick-up point

649
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,560
Can you see us? We're here.

650
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:46,200
Look at that guy over there.

651
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,680
Suspected Chinese agent

652
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,839
Not there. Turn around.

653
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,079
Turn around.

654
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,879
They were supposed to be
at the glass door.

655
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,880
Get out of there.

656
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,520
Mission aborted

657
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,479
CHOI YOUNG-HUN

658
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,520
A SOUTH KOREAN ACTIVIST WHO
TRIED TO RESCUE NORTH KOREANS,

659
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,840
HE SPENT FOUR YEARS
JAILED IN CHINA

660
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,079
Come here quick.
I need to hold your hands.

661
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,000
I'm shaking.

662
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,599
You were more distressed.

663
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,840
She's the hero.
It's my wife who's the hero.

664
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,319
Chinese prison is simply hell.

665
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,920
10 days after his release

666
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,399
Chinese prisoners

667
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,039
work 18 hours a day.

668
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,519
You know
the Korean wedding bouquets?

669
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:11,559
You make the flowers

670
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,400
out of paper,

671
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,439
tie them with wires.

672
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,760
You make

673
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,239
the flower shapes like this,

674
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,359
then cover them with asbestos powder,

675
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,080
which causes lung disease.

676
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,999
Asbestos,

677
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,479
it's very irritating.

678
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,399
So we make these artificial flowers,

679
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,159
and the irony is that they
are exported

680
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,400
to South Korea.

681
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,599
I thought everything
would be back to normal

682
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,160
once he came back.

683
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,999
But he is broken,

684
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,879
mentally unstable.

685
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,400
I don't know what
the future holds for our family.

686
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,800
It's nerve-wracking.

687
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,400
In North Korea
they say there is no God,

688
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,439
but my family has been religious
for generations.

689
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,040
They were all arrested.

690
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,719
I just thought, that's how life is.

691
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,320
I had to hide my faith.

692
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,360
There was a Korean-Chinese pastor

693
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,359
who urged us

694
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,240
to come to China.

695
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,280
I stayed with a missionary for a year
who taught me the Bible.

696
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,159
Then he wanted me
to go back to North Korea

697
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,839
and spread the gospel.

698
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,719
I said no.

699
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,800
I left because life there
was too hard.

700
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,360
I was determined
to go to South Korea.

701
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:24,319
With the missionary's help,

702
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,960
I made it there safely.

703
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,919
In China, a fellow defector told me

704
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,439
there was a piano in the church.

705
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,359
So I went to the church
at the foot of the mountain.

706
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,919
And that's how
I got to play the piano.

707
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,519
They liked my playing.

708
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,359
They asked me to stay
and play the piano.

709
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,920
From then on, I lived in the church.

710
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,559
Through them,

711
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,560
I met South Korean missionaries
who helped me get to South Korea.

712
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:10,240
Unlike China, Mongolia does not
repatriate North Korean refugees.

713
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,359
So for North Koreans,
it is one of the few routes

714
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,960
out of China, to freedom.

715
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,119
The guide was leading

716
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,399
a group of defectors.

717
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,079
My sister and I had to meet them
at the border of China and Mongolia.

718
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,480
Someone suddenly appeared in front
on us. Everyone scattered.

719
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,599
It all happened so suddenly

720
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,439
Our guide ran away.

721
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,599
I didn't know what to do.

722
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,559
I wanted to go back

723
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,880
but I couldn't speak Chinese.

724
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,120
I couldn't think at all.
And the future seemed pitch black.

725
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,119
Only me and a teenage boy

726
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,759
made it into Mongolia.

727
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,400
Everyone else was arrested.

728
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,079
They've all been released.

729
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,320
Except my sister. I have no news.

730
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,599
I think I won't see her again

731
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,800
in this life.

732
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,640
Don't worry about us, sister.
Our father is still with us.

733
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,840
We open our hearts.

734
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,480
Without reserve full of hope.

735
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:42,480
We live relying on General
as our god.

736
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:55,040
Only on our General forever.

737
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,840
The future?

738
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,920
Well, I don't know.

739
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,239
Kim Jong-il
only talks about reunification.

740
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,200
It won't happen while he's alive.

741
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,000
For over 20 years,

742
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,039
the entire North Korean population

743
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,280
has stopped working.

744
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,039
If that turns into 30 years,

745
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,800
I think it will be over.

746
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,239
We refugees don't actively
go out and fight

747
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,719
because of the danger to ourselves
and our families still in the North.

748
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,720
We still fear North Korea.

749
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,359
If outside countries
stop helping Kim Jong-il,

750
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:22,319
North Koreans will end this tyranny
with their bare hands.

751
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,520
I am certain.

752
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,399
If they fight for democracy,

753
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,559
no matter how many laws there are
against "political" crimes,

754
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:37,199
there won't be enough prisons
for a million political prisoners.

755
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,000
They can't execute a million people.

756
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,919
We know when Kim Jong-il dies,

757
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,199
there will be chaos.

758
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,519
But whatever chaos comes

759
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,199
couldn't be worse

760
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,879
than the chaos under Kim Jong-il.

761
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,839
When the leader changes

762
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,559
and I can go back,

763
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:12,639
I want to do all I can to change it
as fast as possible.

764
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,000
I want to make that land prosperous.

765
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,999
In North Korea,

766
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,399
it's the dictatorship that's evil.

767
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,239
If you look at the individual,

768
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:44,000
many are so good
and innocent and kind.

769
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,919
If Kim Jong-il's dictatorship
collapsed now,

770
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,600
I'd be in North Korea tomorrow.

771
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,559
Camps existed in the past,

772
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,879
like in the Hitler,

773
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,839
Mao and Stalin eras,

774
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,719
but I think it's a disgrace
to the human race

775
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,359
that such camps exist today.

776
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,399
I want Kim Jong-il to fear.

777
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,039
I want to make him stand
in the International Court.

778
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,679
He killed and imprisoned

779
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,239
tens of thousands of people.

780
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:41,039
He forces young children
to watch public executions

781
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,839
and terrorizes the population.

782
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:49,159
That in itself is a crime.

783
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,479
We have no freedom of speech.

784
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,639
We have no freedom of movement.

785
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,840
If the person
who created such a place

786
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:03,439
isn't a criminal,
I don't know who is.

787
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,719
I'm grateful for South Korea

788
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,599
and the world

789
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,319
and peace.

790
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,759
I love the people
who love peace and liberty.

791
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,879
Since I've tasted freedom,

792
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,679
I need to share it with my people.

793
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:26,680
We have to free the North Koreans.

794
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,679
I wonder if anyone's listening

795
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,439
to our pleas.

796
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,120
North Koreans can't speak,

797
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,999
can't see, can't listen,

798
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,559
can't eat, can't smell, can't speak.

799
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,719
They're bound by wires, like plants.

800
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,599
I feel such compassion for them.

801
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,480
The world has to save North Korea.

802
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,960
We have to speak of it.

803
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,639
We wish to thank all of the people
who participated in this film.

804
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,239
We hope their courageous testimony
will help save the millions of people

805
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,240
still at risk in North Korea.
