1
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,407
We're near the exit.
We'll survive.

2
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,979
Dad!

3
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,356
Kamkong! Come back here!

4
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,699
Get Naso out of here.

5
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,078
Then come back and pick me up.

6
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,245
I'm not going!

7
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,874
I'll stay with my dad. Dad!

8
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:37,639
Get off me! Get off me!
I'll go and help my Dad. Get off me!

9
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,602
Stay here!

10
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,612
Dad! Dad!

11
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,283
Dad!

12
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,911
- Go! Run!
- Get off me! Dad!

13
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,292
Dad! Dad!

14
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,005
Get off me!

15
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,520
Why did you kill him?

16
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,398
I didn't do it.

17
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,525
I didn't kill your father.

18
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,529
That's my stuff.

19
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,535
If you want to end up like him,
go ahead and help him, then.

20
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,880
Dad!

21
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,199
Who's there?

22
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,575
It's me.

23
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,287
What's up?

24
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,456
Well, I came for the rent.

25
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,836
You're behind several months.

26
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,847
Only a few months.

27
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,850
Once I get the money,
I'll pay you what I owe.

28
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,064
Fine. It's fine with me.

29
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,695
l’m just warning you.

30
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,406
Shit! Run!

31
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,617
He's outside!

32
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,620
Don't come in here!

33
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,933
Sir!

34
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,904
Shit!

35
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,774
He shot at us first!

36
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,900
Look!

37
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,864
- Don't cry, honey.
- Dad!

38
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:09,202
Shh... I'm here.

39
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:22,215
Don't hurt my dad. Please!

40
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,637
I'm begging you!
Don't hurt my dad.

41
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,138
I'm begging you!

42
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,810
Hey, girl! No one will shoot him.

43
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,354
I promise.

44
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,733
Dad! Dad!

45
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,822
Dad!

46
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,259
That rookie cop!

47
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,719
We were almost dismissed, weren't we?

48
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,221
Damn! You're foul-mouthed!

49
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:14,559
What? I'm telling the truth.

50
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,854
Hey! Are you free now?

51
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,065
Go block those people.
I guess they came from the market.

52
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,233
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,657
Would you die
if you couldn't drink? Huh?

54
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,580
Chet, call an ambulance.

55
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,664
Yes, sir.

56
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,006
Call an ambulance.

57
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:51,137
Where are the rest of the jail breakers?

58
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,686
Hey! Are you deaf?

59
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,024
Don't you hear me?

60
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,277
Answer the question, man.

61
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,614
Please don't make us hurt you.

62
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,910
I was separated from them.

63
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,119
Liar!

64
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,418
It's true. I missed my daughter.

65
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,711
I missed my wife.

66
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:28,424
Bastard! How dare you talk like this!

67
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,761
Your daughter was here,
you shot me?

68
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,846
Hey! Come on!

69
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,980
So, where will the rest of them go?

70
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,317
I... I heard them say

71
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,864
that they'll escape through
the Payamek Mountains

72
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,576
and cross the border into Myanmar
until the heat dies down.

73
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:02,833
They might pass that temple, sir.

74
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,962
Are you willing to go
on a journey, Father?

75
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:56,137
Until all of my sins are paid for.

76
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,688
Are you going into that jungle?

77
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,358
Are you crazy, Kratae?
Nobody would go in there.

78
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,445
Father prohibited it.

79
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,863
Is it true?

80
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,427
Can you tell me about
the Kinnorn creature, please?

81
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,970
I want to hear about it.

82
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,597
Hey, Kratae!

83
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,641
Don't bother Father.

84
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,351
Bullshit!

85
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,858
If you want to tell me something,

86
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:56,113
tell me about the fruit tree maiden.

87
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,768
How are you?

88
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,604
Why have you come so far?

89
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,024
We're here on official business, Father,

90
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,654
so we dropped in to pay our respects.

91
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,698
- Chet!
- Yes, sir.

92
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:46,038
Four or five days ago,
some prisoners broke out of jail.

93
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:51,168
We heard they came this way.

94
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:55,798
They're very dangerous.

95
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:02,930
They're thieves and murderers,
as well as drug dealers.

96
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,561
If necessary,
we would kill them to stop them.

97
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,607
Take it easy, son.

98
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,365
I live in the temple.

99
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:25,202
I haven't seen these criminals.

100
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,497
You'd better ask the villagers.

101
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,083
You may get something from them.

102
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,168
Yes, Father.

103
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,836
Well, oldie.

104
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,920
Yes?

105
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,384
Take them to the chief of the village.

106
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,303
Yes. Let's go.

107
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,055
So, we'll...

108
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,100
It's getting dark now.

109
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,103
Stay here tonight.

110
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,022
Replenish your strength.

111
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,652
Yes, Father.

112
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,993
How are you, new cop?

113
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,538
I'm fine.

114
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,626
Don't work too hard.

115
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,170
You should have some rest.

116
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,881
You should relax sometimes.

117
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,597
Our ego always
brings us difficulties.

118
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,060
It's not my ego...

119
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,689
It's my past,
that's why I'm like this.

120
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,486
You know them, don't you?

121
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,322
Whoever they are.

122
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,616
If they do wrong, I won't let them go.

123
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,038
If you have nothing else, I'll go now.

124
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,401
A bit late for a bath, isn't it?

125
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,695
Hey, Chet!

126
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,117
God! It's you!

127
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,620
You scared me.
I thought you were a ghost.

128
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,459
You have to wait for your bosses
to bathe first, right?

129
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,754
Yeah, it's all about rank, sir.

130
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,681
Well, sir...

131
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,852
Did Captain Wut have
any problems with Father?

132
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,438
Why do you want to know?

133
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,441
Just wondering.

134
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,074
Have those people slept yet?

135
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,746
They were all asleep
when I went for a bath.

136
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,389
I beg you, please.

137
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,308
Please leave my wife and I alive.

138
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,941
Twenty years ago,
there was a big group of thieves

139
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,861
who cruelly robbed
the villagers and merchants

140
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,950
traveling around
the Payamek Mountains.

141
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,665
These thieves were so confident
of their black magic

142
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,584
that they dared to enter the magic jungle

143
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,213
to search for an ancient treasure
which was believed

144
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,549
to have been protected
by a mysterious hill tribe.

145
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,721
It is a carved stone,
the size of your palm.

146
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:18,185
It would give its holder magic powers.

147
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:26,860
But it turns out that
they all disappeared in the jungle.

148
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:33,450
It's said that those
not killed by wild animals

149
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,371
became greedy
and murdered each other.

150
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:54,847
The police arrested him

151
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,226
when he came back
to see his family.

152
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:06,108
Now, that robber became the monk

153
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:10,279
whom you and I
paid our respects to this afternoon.

154
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,996
Kratae is an eager girl.

155
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:27,087
Something must be
with the one who knows its value.

156
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,185
Keep this one for Captain Wut.

157
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,022
It'll come in handy
when the time comes.

158
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,073
Please take care of my son, oldie.

159
00:17:55,616 --> 00:18:01,872
A hunter like you
must not be careless.

160
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,541
You earn your life in the jungle,

161
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,962
so you must be aware of it
and respect it.

162
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:14,343
There are millions
of dangerous things in there.

163
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,220
While he was in jail,

164
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,722
all he talked about
was the magic in the jungle.

165
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:25,020
When his family visited him,
he only talked nonsense.

166
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,482
Captain Wut was...

167
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,612
only four or five years old back then.

168
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:39,451
Finally, his mother
couldn't take it anymore.

169
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,578
She committed suicide.

170
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,831
Mom!

171
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,585
He's so pathetic, isn't he?

172
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,007
Captain Wut moved in
with his relatives in Bangkok.

173
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:58,095
When he graduated
from the academy, he came here.

174
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,849
If I were him...

175
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,519
I would have asked
to be somewhere else.

176
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:13,819
His boss may have thought
he was a local.

177
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,626
Let me ask you...

178
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,799
how do you know so much about this, sir?

179
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,221
The cop that arrested his father...

180
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,683
was me.

181
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,565
What are you doing, Father?

182
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,028
You think you can
escape from me, huh?

183
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,155
Naso!

184
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,911
Are you thinking of taking
the treasure in the jungle?

185
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:10,250
It only brings chaos and mayhem!

186
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,797
It's cursed.

187
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,841
When you saw that damn light,

188
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,761
you scrambled
to take that stuff, didn't you?

189
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,014
Here's the evidence.

190
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,725
You think you can trick me?

191
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:32,439
I'll go away from here
so you won't sin anymore.

192
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,488
What about what you've done to my dad?

193
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,700
It was all fate.

194
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,287
Leeso has committed many sins.

195
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,123
But you still have time.

196
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,627
You should stop sinning now.

197
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,714
Fate or karma,

198
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,926
it's too late for me now.

199
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,743
Hey! Keep them away.

200
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,578
Hunter! Hunter!

201
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,332
Father... is in the temple.

202
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,367
Captain!

203
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,660
Captain!

204
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,540
The villagers saw the criminals
escaping behind the temple

205
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,959
and heading towards
the Payamek Mountains.

206
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,888
Sir... I'll lead you, sir.

207
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,307
You're wounded. You can't go on.

208
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,059
I can, sir.

209
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,810
I told you not to go.

210
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,812
Sir!

211
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,689
Believe him, please.

212
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,817
It's all right.
I'll ask a Karen hunter to lead us.

213
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,069
Let's go.

214
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,443
Hey! Get up! Go!

215
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,569
Come on!

216
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,530
I can't make it!

217
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,198
Give me a break. I'm so tired.

218
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,534
- Hey! Get up!
- I'm so tired.

219
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,037
No! We must go!

220
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,040
Damn you!
We ran the whole night. I'm so tired.

221
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,751
Let's have a rest, please.

222
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,546
Bullshit!

223
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,131
Who do you mean?

224
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,507
I mean you!

225
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,266
Brother! Are you all right?

226
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,435
Yes, sir.

227
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,923
Run!

228
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,815
Shit! You go first.

229
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,611
Come on! Hold me.

230
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,317
Hey! You're a diehard, man.

231
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,288
Hey, where's the captain?

232
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,090
This way, sir. This way.

233
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,270
What's wrong with you?

234
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,773
If I got shot like this,

235
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,650
I would have gone to the hospital

236
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:37,697
to let a beautiful nurse
take care of me, for sure.

237
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,783
You want to try? Huh?
I'll shoot you now.

238
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,494
Hey! Shit! No!
I don't want to get hurt.

239
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,578
Yeah.

240
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:57,092
Sir! This way, sir. This way.

241
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,855
Hey, Naso! Let's take a rest.

242
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,076
Naso, I'll get you some water.

243
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,625
Go with him
and don't let him escape.

244
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,961
Go with him!

245
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,970
You all right?

246
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,598
I'm talking to you!

247
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,486
Sir... please, don't follow them.

248
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,155
What do you think, sir?

249
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,700
Let's follow them, hunter.
Don't waste any time.

250
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,412
Well, if that's what you want,
I can't help you anymore.

251
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:53,458
No one would dare go
into that damn jungle, sir.

252
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,629
Don't be an idiot.
There's nothing in that jungle.

253
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,964
I beg you, please, sir.

254
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:04,093
I'd rather be imprisoned than go into it.

255
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:10,183
Without him, we'll get lost for sure.

256
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,936
What would you like me to do,
let those criminals escape?

257
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,438
But this jungle, everyone's scared.
Even Father...

258
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,941
I don't care about the bullshit legend.

259
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,151
We should stay here for a while,
shouldn't we?

260
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,612
Who's leading this team, you or me?

261
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,370
No matter what happens,

262
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,039
I'm bringing back those bastards.

263
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,708
You, go home.

264
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,793
Sir!

265
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,173
Hey! Chet! Chet!

266
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,383
Damn it!

267
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,805
Goddamn it!

268
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,307
You let the police go inside that jungle?

269
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,148
What are you doing?

270
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,359
I'm going to help them.

271
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,820
But that's the forbidden jungle.

272
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,030
Anybody who enters
won't ever come out.

273
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,241
Father said we can't go in there.

274
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,994
Father asked me to do something.

275
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,715
What's that?

276
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,429
What's that bug?

277
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,812
Let's go!

278
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,621
Tiger wasps! Damn! Get up!

279
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,123
- Run!
- Get up!

280
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,627
Leave him, boss.

281
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,711
Go!

282
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,122
Boss!

283
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,879
Come on!

284
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:07,920
Sir, Chet looks really bad.

285
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,465
Let's take a rest, shouldn't we?

286
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,940
Hey! Be patient, brother.

287
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,192
Yeah.

288
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,651
- Vee!
- Yes, sir.

289
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,070
Take care of him, please.

290
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,196
Certainly, sir.

291
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,949
Hey, brother.

292
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,035
It hurts so damn much.

293
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,162
Hey, let's clean the wound.

294
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,288
Yeah.

295
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,334
Hey! Don't stand like that.
Come and help me.

296
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,132
Nanmueng! Nanmueng!

297
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,342
We're taking the right path.

298
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,761
Just pass the fruit tree maidens
and we're there.

299
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,393
Hey! Did you hear a woman's voice?

300
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,105
I'm sure I heard it.

301
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,775
Akong, you heard it too, right?

302
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,819
Hey, let's stay here tonight.

303
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,196
Yeah!

304
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,366
Idiot!

305
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:28,079
If you can't stay in control,
you'll end up dead for sure.

306
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,083
We have to get out of here before sunset.

307
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,308
We'll stay in this cave tonight.

308
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:07,034
Hey, what's up out there?

309
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,208
Vee, you feel anything?

310
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,877
The pathway looks strange.

311
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,839
How strange? I don't feel anything.

312
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,340
You think too much, huh?

313
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:28,180
Hey! You're drinking too much.

314
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,522
Sir, don't yell at me!

315
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,691
If you want to drink, just tell me.

316
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,443
My stuff is very strong.

317
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,210
Chet is getting worse, sir.

318
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,338
Well...

319
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,968
If we let them go,

320
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,555
they'll cross the Payamek Mountains into Myanmar.

321
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,895
Hey!

322
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,648
If your father is a robber,

323
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,194
a cold-blooded murderer
who could even kill his best friend,

324
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,030
and you're a cop,
what are you going to do?

325
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,878
My boss didn't send me here.

326
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,422
I requested it myself.

327
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,931
I'm sorry, sir.

328
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,293
Sir! Sir!

329
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,427
Who's there?

330
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,845
Sir, it's me.

331
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,857
Sergeant Vee!

332
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,235
Why is he like this?

333
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,863
He was sucked
by the fruit tree maiden, sir.

334
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,658
Fruit tree maiden?

335
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,745
The ones that chased Muek last night.

336
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,541
What a bullshit story!

337
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,668
- It's right here!
- Shut up!

338
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:10,225
Kratae, your mouth will get us in trouble.

339
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:14,104
Can't you keep your mouth shut?

340
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,399
No more words, huh?

341
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,360
You should go say you're sorry...

342
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,905
Hey! What's up?

343
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,324
Stop!

344
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,244
What's next, sir?

345
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,998
This jungle is dangerous.

346
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,418
But if we go back,
we'll lose everything.

347
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,504
Sir! Sir!

348
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,175
Put down the guns.

349
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,263
Put them down!

350
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,168
Who are you?

351
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,796
We are policemen.
We're here to catch the prisoners.

352
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:24,550
The guys who built a fire last night?

353
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,595
You saw them, right?

354
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,558
We saw a bonfire, just put out,
not far from here.

355
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,528
I'm Wut. What's your name?

356
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,491
- My sister's name is Si-on.
- Kampang!

357
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,626
What's up?

358
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,381
Nothing.

359
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,300
I just have my doubts.

360
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,776
Be careful, Kampang.

361
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,946
There's a fierce animal following us.

362
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,625
They stayed here last night.

363
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,752
Just under our nose?

364
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,423
The bonfire is still warm,
so they might not have gone far.

365
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,875
Well... their footprints
are lost in the jungle.

366
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,086
- But I think...
- I'll lead you.

367
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,213
I know this jungle well.

368
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,968
But now, we must get out of here.

369
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,353
Are you okay?

370
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,646
Yes, sir.

371
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:54,241
Muek, bury Vee's corpse.

372
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,537
We will keep going.

373
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,261
Put down your guns.

374
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,350
Naso!

375
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,645
I told you to put the gun down!

376
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,690
I should be the one giving orders.

377
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,775
Go!

378
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,995
Will you put your guns down?

379
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,080
Throw it here.

380
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,260
Hey, what's next?

381
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,928
Kill them all.

382
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,014
But I want her.

383
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,225
Suit yourself.

384
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,862
You old dog!

385
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,240
Grandpa!

386
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,201
- Kratae, help me.
- Come here.

387
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,953
- Get off me!
- Come here!

388
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,416
- Get off me!
- Don't!

389
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,962
Son of a bitch!

390
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,172
Will you fight me?

391
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,514
Bastard!

392
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,151
- Go!
- Go! Go!

393
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,946
- This way!
- Grandpa!

394
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,869
- Grandpa!
- Go!

395
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,164
Duck!

396
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,208
Look out!

397
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:21,633
Die!

398
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,230
What should we do?
There's too many of them.

399
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,065
Kill them all.

400
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,824
What should we do?

401
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,576
If you ask me again, I'll kick you.

402
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,249
Run!

403
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,275
Kratae!

404
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,046
Let's have a rest.

405
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,519
Grandpa!

406
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,033
Thanks for your help.

407
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,005
Muek!

408
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,383
You can't follow him.

409
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,186
We'd better stay here.

410
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,160
You're lucky you only got
a little bit of the poison.

411
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,204
If you got the Silver Scale's poison

412
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:22,373
and didn't find the antidote in time,
you'd be dead for sure.

413
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,083
Silver Scale!

414
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,087
That giant serpent.

415
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,923
It's said to be a demon.

416
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,382
Nonsense!

417
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,806
But thank you, anyway.

418
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,726
Without you, we'd be in trouble.

419
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,853
Do you trust those two women?

420
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,527
Shut up or I'll kick you.

421
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,154
You've never heard about
the Karen's tale,

422
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,949
the mysterious people
who hide themselves in the jungle?

423
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,992
I don't care
about such a bullshit story,

424
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,661
but I know that
if you don't shut up...

425
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,497
Why? I've shot a lot of people too.

426
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,040
Not just you.

427
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,752
He's killed a monk already.

428
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,297
What did you say?

429
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,507
Don't, sir!

430
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,179
What did you say?

431
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,181
Don't, sir!

432
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,766
We're policemen.

433
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,550
I shouldn't have been so stubborn.

434
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,097
Everyone might have lived.

435
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,727
No. It's our duty.

436
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:19,407
It's not personal, is it, sir?

437
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,339
I'll take everybody out of here.

438
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,763
Your name is Si-on, right?

439
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,931
Yeah, her name is Si-on.

440
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:47,101
If your sister is Si-on,
then you're Si-kem.

441
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,652
- Son of a bitch! Damn!
- Bitch!

442
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:59,697
Enough, Kampang, enough.
Calm down!

443
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,115
Bitch! Don't let me go.

444
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,784
Calm down! Calm down!

445
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:05,036
Who are you?

446
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,831
I asked you who you are.

447
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,833
We are wanderers.

448
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,835
We look for herbs in the forest.

449
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,295
Liar!

450
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,632
You know this jungle is cursed.

451
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,802
Only demons can wander around.

452
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,680
Hey! They're coming to help us.

453
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,807
Shouldn't you try to trust someone else?

454
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:29,018
No! I won't trust anyone.

455
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,145
Stop being so pessimistic!

456
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,564
You see, they're humans just like us.

457
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,822
Kampang, enough. Calm down!

458
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,198
Kratae!

459
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,449
Grandpa!

460
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,911
How are you?

461
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,417
I have to find more herbs.

462
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,837
They don't help for very long.

463
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,881
Just so you can go to my village.

464
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,133
Where is it?

465
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,467
At a water source over there.

466
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,179
You don't know it.

467
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,514
I'll go with my sister.

468
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:08,891
Let's go, Kampang.

469
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,575
If they don't help,
who else will do it?

470
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:28,286
They're foresters,
so they must know about herbs.

471
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,163
So why did you doubt them?

472
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,623
Herbs? I know about them too.

473
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,795
Here they are!

474
01:02:57,231 --> 01:03:00,234
Sir! Sir!

475
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:06,491
It'll come in handy
when the time comes.

476
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,935
We don't have to help
all of them, Si-on.

477
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:36,437
This is enough.

478
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:40,024
You don't want to carry them, do you?

479
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:44,153
Leave the injured man
and take the good one instead.

480
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:49,283
Between the injured man and the bad man,
which one will you take?

481
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:53,454
Well... I'll take the bad man
'cause he can walk

482
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,957
while the injured man can't.

483
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,917
Oh my God!

484
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:10,221
But if I were you,
I'd help only one person.

485
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,308
Which one?

486
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,062
The one who asked your name.

487
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,487
Hurry up! It's getting dark.

488
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:31,742
Taking so many of them to the village
will make Grandma happy.

489
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,078
Kampang!

490
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,373
Listen carefully.

491
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,250
No matter what happens,

492
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,335
you must take those guys
to the village.

493
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:42,587
Understand?

494
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,882
There's no more time! Go!

495
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,679
Si-on!

496
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:53,574
Got you!

497
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,201
Help me!

498
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,289
Si-on!

499
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,541
Help me!

500
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,432
I'm cold.

501
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,437
The Silver Scale bit me.

502
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,036
Chew it well...

503
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:24,415
and apply it to the wound.

504
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,618
You're okay, right?

505
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,579
I'm fine.

506
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,166
You're holding me too tight.

507
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,711
I'm sorry.

508
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,176
You didn't do anything wrong.

509
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,911
You like it? Firefly.

510
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,248
Firefly.

511
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:38,966
Someone once said
that it's the spirit of a lover

512
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,926
waiting to be reunited.

513
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,480
What's this?

514
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:01,906
It's the symbol of my village.

515
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,325
It's the promise that I must protect

516
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:07,077
The Time Travel Coin
as long as I live.

517
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,414
The Time Travel Coin?

518
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,045
You don't understand.

519
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:24,929
The Time Travel Coin controls time.

520
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,682
Nobody can fight it.

521
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,317
Someone has stolen it from my village.

522
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:41,737
Since then...

523
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,374
Now it's getting close to dawn.

524
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:54,959
Let's get going.

525
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,317
Are you okay, Grandpa?

526
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,650
Si-on!

527
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,033
Sir!

528
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,081
Sir! Sir!

529
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,084
Hunter!

530
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,878
God bless you.

531
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:24,214
If something bad
happened to you, I would die.

532
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,549
That bad, huh?

533
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,885
Yeah! Of course.

534
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:30,346
I've committed myself to Father.

535
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,016
Thanks. But I'm fine, okay?

536
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:35,225
Yeah!

537
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,730
Hey! What's up now?

538
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:41,440
Who pissed you off?

539
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,150
You promised me.

540
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:44,693
This way, Grandpa.

541
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:56,246
You're all right?

542
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,414
Yeah!

543
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,417
You're so thick-skinned.

544
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:02,753
Don't, sir!

545
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,383
I've got a lot of shit
to clear up with you.

546
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:15,516
Kampang, I won't take
those guys to the village.

547
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,476
- Why?
- Quiet!

548
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,228
Someone might hear us.

549
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:30,155
I'll take them to the jungle’s edge.

550
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:33,867
But... it's nearly full moon.

551
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,328
If we don't take them
to the village...

552
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,122
What if Grandma finds out?

553
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,503
Si-on!

554
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:47,214
Who is it?

555
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,179
What's up?

556
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,142
Nothing.

557
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:29,608
Kampang said that
you've traveled very far.

558
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:34,321
Yeah. We came from town
to catch the criminals.

559
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:38,116
So, go take a bath and rest.

560
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,412
Tonight, we'll arrange dinner for you.

561
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:46,583
Don't worry. We won't stay long.

562
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:51,088
It's all right, isn't it, Grandma?

563
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:54,841
Si-on, take care of them please.

564
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,301
Yeah.

565
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,269
- Go!
- Hey!

566
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:07,187
Don't push me that hard.

567
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:09,439
What kind of a cop are you?

568
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,607
Sit down!

569
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,944
What the hell are you looking at?

570
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,655
You too, what the hell?

571
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,450
You don't shut up, huh?

572
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:28,041
Sir!

573
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:30,502
Shoot!

574
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:33,338
Shoot me!

575
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:43,473
You failed, boy.

576
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:45,809
You failed.

577
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:48,020
Bastard!

578
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,398
Shit! It's mine.

579
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,831
Father's coin, sir.

580
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:15,589
You have heard about the legend
of the Karen's magic coin, haven't you?

581
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,383
Yeah.

582
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,677
Father used to tell me about it.

583
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:24,598
Do you believe it?

584
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:32,022
Well, hunter!

585
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:35,692
What's this for?

586
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:40,530
I don't know, sir.

587
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,949
Kratae may know, though.

588
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,911
Hey, where's Kratae?

589
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,540
Don't you see her?

590
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,571
Clear these bodies.

591
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:25,784
Grandma, I feel that Si-on has changed.

592
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,161
Maybe she and that guy...

593
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:34,918
Nonsense! Si-on knows well enough
those people made us like this.

594
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:41,758
I know that you love her,

595
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:50,308
but if the time comes
and she betrays you for that guy,

596
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:54,020
you'll know how to cope, right?

597
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:59,818
But now, take these bodies away.

598
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:09,953
I've got something for you to handle.

599
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,339
Hi, baby!

600
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,782
Kratae's book.

601
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:30,951
What book?

602
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:32,494
That one.

603
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,957
Father gave it to her.

604
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,292
It's really special to her.

605
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:42,629
Not now, hunter.

606
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:45,215
They're doing the ceremony.

607
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:14,870
You must come with me!

608
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:22,669
Back of the forest.

609
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:42,689
What's the matter?

610
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:49,988
You guys must leave here now!

611
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:53,783
To where? I don't understand.

612
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,712
Do you remember the story I told you?

613
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:10,133
After the Time Travel Coin
was taken from the village...

614
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:15,555
our people were cursed.

615
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:19,059
Animals became abnormal...

616
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,812
and every full moon...

617
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,108
I will change.

618
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:30,445
Change what? How will it be?

619
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:37,869
Si-on!

620
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:57,013
If you help me,
I'll give you something.

621
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:31,835
Hey! Look at that!

622
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,630
Cut it, quick!

623
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:46,599
Shoot its heart.

624
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:22,468
You...

625
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:26,681
- Si-on!
- Die!

626
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:51,915
No!

627
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:57,814
Bitch! Where're you going?

628
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,007
Father's coin, sir.

629
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:40,017
At the middle of the village,
there's a mark for the coin.

630
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,729
Whoever turns it anticlockwise

631
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:46,732
will be able to travel
to any time in history.

632
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:48,693
I'll get you out of here.

633
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:55,283
They make sure
no one can travel in time.

634
01:30:56,701 --> 01:31:02,331
If the coin is used,
they'll be destroyed.

635
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:44,373
Come on! Come to me!

636
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,043
Come!

637
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:12,248
The Time Travel Coin!

638
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:19,380
I'll go back and undo all this madness.

639
01:35:19,463 --> 01:35:21,090
It's useless.

640
01:35:21,173 --> 01:35:23,759
No one can change things
that have already happened.

641
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,556
Go! And leave the coin here.

642
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:31,642
It has to be changed!

643
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,144
Go!

644
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:50,327
You still remember that firefly, don't you?

645
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:33,370
- Dad!
- Go!

646
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,080
He'll come back to help me!

647
01:36:35,164 --> 01:36:36,332
Dad!

648
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:53,849
Who are you?

649
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:01,941
Give it back!

650
01:37:02,024 --> 01:37:03,192
Is this yours?

651
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:05,736
This damned coin ruined my life.

652
01:37:06,737 --> 01:37:09,114
Did you know it killed everyone?

653
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:11,283
What the hell are you talking about?

654
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:12,660
I don't understand.

655
01:38:12,094 --> 01:38:15,097
Dad. I'm sorry!

656
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:47,379
Dad! Dad!

657
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:50,758
- Run! Run!
- Dad! Get off me!

658
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:54,386
Dad! Dad!

659
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:57,514
- Get off me!
- Run!

660
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:02,144
Get off me! Get off me!

661
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:33,968
If your father is a robber,

662
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:37,596
a cold-blooded murderer
who would kill even his best friend,

663
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,431
and you're a cop,

664
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:41,350
what would you do?

665
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:51,443
It's not ego, Father.

666
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:56,281
It's the past that made me like this.
