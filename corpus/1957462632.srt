If not now, then when?
And, you know,

25
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:41,579
Halloween would
make a great anniversary

26
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,104
considering how much Malcolm
loves my candy corn cupcakes.

27
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:46,062
Look, you just need to follow
through with it.

28
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,735
We've been friends for years.
What am I supposed to do?

29
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,500
- Just grab him and kiss him?
- Yes.

30
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:51,435
Do it all while you're
setting up for the party.

31
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,156
But the problem is
Mal has to work late.

32
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,940
So even if I wanted
to kiss him...

33
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,309
Then do it right
when he gets there.

34
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,552
Hi, Malcolm.

35
00:01:57,682 --> 00:02:01,077
Yeah. No, I don't think so.

36
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,645
Then you say something like,
"I've loved you since... " Oh,

37
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:05,777
Henry, it's the New Zealand job
on the other line.

38
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,518
- I've got to run.
- Okay. Yeah.

39
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:08,649
I'll see you tonight.

40
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,349

- Hey.

51
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:44,592
- You finally made it.
- Trick or treat.

52
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:45,948
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

53
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:53,912
Hello, trick or treat!

54
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:56,959
Hey, you! It's about time
you got here.

55
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:58,482
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,173
Uh, but I think
that Henry filled me in.

57
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:03,139
So, the Ouija board
just spelled "cake."

58
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,012
And you brought an actual orb
from the spirit world?

59
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,711
Uh, and Gina also brought Carl.
Carl, Malcolm. Mal, Carl.

60
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:12,627
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Carl just moved to L.A.

61
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:14,585
I couldn't leave him
alone on Halloween.

62
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:18,415
- Mm, yeah, you really could.
- No, I could not have.

63
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:20,939
Besides, we need an even number
for the Ouija board to work.

64
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,507
I'm gonna have to object
to any sentence that includes

65
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,292
both the words "Ouija board"
and "work."

66
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:27,729
- Carl's skeptic.
- Help me out here.

67
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,471
What's not working about Ouija
board that announces dessert?

68
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,601
Speaking of dessert.

69
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,911
Yes. Oh, thank you, Henry,
and baby Jesus.

70
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,175
I thought I would be here too late
for your epic candy corn cupcakes.

71
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,221
So you two have been
together for...

72
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,135
Oh, oh. We're not together.

73
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,747
No, God, no. Uh, we're friends.

74
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,186
And... But yeah, we've been
friends for more than 12 years.

75
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:52,971
- It's a long time.
- It is.

76
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,930
They have the most amazing
meet cute.

77
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,063
Malcolm was the R. A.
In Henry's freshman dorm.

78
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:00,065
Meet cute? Are you kidding me?

79
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:02,218
We met in the bathroom after
my first ever college party.

80
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,636
I was throwing up.
I'm still so sorry.

81
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,290
Oh, no, you've long
since paid me back.

82
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:09,945
It's that Mal stayed in there
with you all night long

83
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:13,209
- that makes it so damn cute.
- Just doing my job, ma'am.

84
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,081
Oh, hey, Henry,
I've been meaning to ask you.

85
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:18,432
Any recent sightings
of hot neighbor guy?

86
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:20,912
Uh...

87
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:25,177
I may have seen him again
this morning.

88
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:29,573
I don't believe I've heard
about hot neighbor guy.

89
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,009
You're gonna make a move on him?

90
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,577
Kiss him passionately,
throw him to the ground,

91
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,057
fuck his brains out?

92
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:36,276
God, who raised you?

93
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:39,453
He's just a new neighbor
who's... hot.

94
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,630
I saw him last week.
His real name should be

95
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,110
- "Red hot neighbor guy."
- Red?

96
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:49,027
Red is the color
of the recently deceased.

97
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:54,119
Okay, are you gonna...

98
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,252
explain that or just
private joke me to death?

99
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,994
- They went to a seance last week.
- Oh, really?

100
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:01,866
It was research for
a segment I'm producing.

101
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,303
That's where I got the orb.

102
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,521
It was fun. Right, Carl?

103
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,088
So much fun.

104
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,220
There was a spirit guide
named Pat.

105
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,397
And every other word
out of her mouth was

106
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,096
"Red is the color
of the recently deceased."

107
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,142
She was a little over the top.

108
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:18,927
Did anything red show up?

109
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,929
Uh, you are adorable.

110
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,888
Sadly, no. We didn't make
contact with the spirit world

111
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,692
because the dimensional portal
failed to open.

112
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:26,978
Mm, you didn't make contact

113
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,806
because there's no such thing
as ghosts.

114
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:32,506
That we know of. And they prefer
to be called spirits.

115
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:34,637
Oh.

116
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,771
Oh.

117
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,990
Boom. The orb.

118
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,994
Oh. Whoa!

119
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,519
Oh, it's like a giant mood ring.

120
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,303
That's exactly what I said.

121
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,653
"Orb from the spirit world,"
my Black ass.

122
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:53,527
It reacts to the heat
from your hands, case closed.

123
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,703
Malcolm, show a little respect.

124
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,833
It's not a snow globe.

125
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,358
My mood ring never did that.

126
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,621
God, maybe I'm dead.

127
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,071
Oh, I guess
I shouldn't be worried

128
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,188
unless it turns red, right?

129
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,974
Oh, kind of like
red hot neighbor guy.

130
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,822
- Maybe he's dead.
- Only if you kill him in a jealous rage.

131
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,675
- What?
- Will you look at the time?

132
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,329
It is the bewitching hour, Carl.

133
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,201
- We must go.
- Oh.

134
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,514
Oh, no, no, Henry.

135
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:28,388
Don't walk us out.
You have things to do.

136
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:29,519
Okay, bye.

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,349
You don't have to do that.

138
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:39,573
Well, the orb still isn't red, so I guess
the ghost maid isn't gonna make it tonight.

139
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,357
Okay, here, here, give it to me.

140
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Thank you.

141
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:48,103
So tell me more
about hot neighbor guy.

142
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,411
Oh... there's not much to...

143
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,325
He just moved in
across the street.

144
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,067
Are you going to, uh...

145
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:57,851
How did Gina put it?

146
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,029
"Throw him down and, uh,
kiss him passionately?"

147
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:05,163
Or, maybe slightly more
reasonably, ask him out on a date?

148
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,601
And break
my forever alone streak?

149
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,254
I don't think so.

150
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,412
- Do you want to...
- Do you mind if I crash on your couch tonight?

151
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,556
I have an early appointment
with a new client tomorrow

152
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,570
and all of that sugar is, uh,

153
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:22,398
about to make my eyes
roll back in my head.

154
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,400
Of course,
I have to get up early too

155
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:27,969
to finish up the photo edits for
the Succulent and Plant Society.

156
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,318
What kind of a name is that?

157
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,451
- Be nice.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy.

158
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
Oh.

159
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,455
- Listen...
- Malcolm, I...

160
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,021
Sorry, go ahead.

161
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:40,155
- You go first.
- No, no, you.

162
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:46,727
Gina thinks my forever alone
streak would magically disappear

163
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:47,857
if I just...

164
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,369
What the hell?

165
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,521
I think the shenanigans part
of Halloween has begun,

166
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:44,480
although I'm not sure why it
suddenly started thundering.

167
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:47,701
Malcolm?

168
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:55,273
Oh, God, okay. You don't have
to pretend to be asleep.

169
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,798
We don't have to talk,
I shouldn't have kissed you.

170
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,627
I'm sorry if
I made you uncomfortable.

171
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:43,452
Hey, Mal, it's me.

172
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,063
Uh, your car is gone, so
you must have left pretty early.

173
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:49,153
And I know that you're at that
meeting, so no worries, um...

174
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,679
I just wanted to let you know
that your bag's here

175
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,853
in case that you need it.

176
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,855
Today's a running day
for me, so...

177
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,596
I'll be out
for about an hour.

178
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,383
Look, I'm really sorry if
I made things weird last night.

179
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,170
Okay. Bye.

180
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,030
Where's my phone?

181
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,300
What time is it?

182
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,825
Whoa.

183
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,653
Okay.

184
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,136
Ooh.

185
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:07,942
Henry, what was
in those cupcakes?

186
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,016
Oh.

187
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,417
Shit!

188
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:24,596
Henry, I was supposed to be out
of here two hours ago.

189
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:25,767
Why didn't you wake me up?

190
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,472
Whoa, that was weird.

191
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,738
Hey, Henry, are you home?

192
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:40,742
Whoa.

193
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,835
Man, something is not right.

194
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,732
Are you kidding me?

195
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,213
What the hell?

196
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:28,877
Am I high?

197
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,145
Hello, marathon man.

198
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,494
Thanks for waking me up.

199
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,366
Also what the hell was
in those cupcakes?

200
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:40,518
- Because there's something really wrong with me.
- Uh-huh.

201
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:41,804
Total disaster.

202
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,588
Yeah, I... I did it,
I kissed him.

203
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,354
But then some kid prank knocked
on the front door and...

204
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,376
when I came back,
he was asleep,

205
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:49,986
or pretending to be asleep.

206
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,877
- I'm not sure which is worse.
- Wait, you kissed

207
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,163
who? When?

208
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,949
Oh, no.

209
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,781
Remember when I took
that dark room workshop

210
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:04,194
and you're like, "Why don't you make
prints of that cute guy you told me"

211
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,587
you're still crushing on?" Only I
wouldn't tell you who it was and...

212
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,484
- What do you want me
to say, Gina?

213
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:11,834
Yes, I've had a crush
on Mal since forever.

214
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,488
Wait. What?

215
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:14,968
No, they're not creepy.

216
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:16,534
Anyway, I forgot about them.

217
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,338
But it looks like Malcolm
found them before he left.

218
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:19,470
You're damn right I found them.

219
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,104
But, hello, I am over here.

220
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:24,020
Because he dumped them all over
the floor and then took off.

221
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:27,023
Took off? I am right here!

222
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:29,678
Yeah, Mal was out of here
before I woke up.

223
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,550
What's kind of weird though
is that he didn't take his bag.

224
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:36,816
No, what's weird is that
I am standing right here

225
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,731
and you're pretending
not to see me! Hey...

226
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,998
Wow. Windy out.

227
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,479
Hey.

228
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,483
What is happening?

229
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,268
Of course, I left him a message.

230
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,941
I'm starting
to get really worried.

231
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,575
He usually calls back
right away.

232
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,278
That's strange.
One of Malcolm's photos...

233
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,760
Never mind.
What were you saying?

234
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,938
Okay, that's fine.

235
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,290
I can play this
I-can't-see-you game all day.

236
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,729
Hmm, try not to see this.

237
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,601
Oh, God,
this shit is really heavy.

238
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,266
This weird thing
keeps happening.

239
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:39,791
I just picked up
one of Malcolm's photos and...

240
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:42,577
all of a sudden
it's on the floor again.

241
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,930
Unless you really
can't see or hear me.

242
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,417
It's probably nothing.

243
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,942
Yeah, I have to take a shower
and clear my head.

244
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,337
Oh, yeah, great.
Yeah, come on over.

245
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:06,862
Okay, sure. Alright.

246
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,256
Oh, will you let me know
if he calls you?

247
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:11,822
Thanks.

248
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,305
Okay, okay.

249
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,266
You win, okay? Just stop.

250
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:23,270
I really don't
remember kissing you

251
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:26,490
and I didn't have a clue
you had a crush on me.

252
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:32,061
Okay, I had a clue but I didn't
want to lose you as a friend,

253
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,237
which is how it happens
for me I...

254
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,457
I get involved, I fuck it up,
I lose a friend.

255
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,943
Um, excuse me.

256
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:56,825
You really can't see...

257
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,618
- Henry?
- I'm in the kitchen, I'll be right there.

258
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,925
Gina, Carl, please tell me
you can see me

259
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:13,320
-because Henry can't, and I think it has something to do...
- How are you doing?

260
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,757
Not too fucking well,
if I'm being honest

261
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,193
because you can't see me either.

262
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:20,544
Uh, that's the one that
kept ending up on the floor.

263
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:24,592
And you said the windows were
shut so there wasn't a breeze?

264
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,898
- Hmm.
- Wait for it.

265
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,162
- It sounds like
you have a ghost.

266
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:31,642
Well, I guess that means
I'm really in trouble

267
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,253
because I know
you've seen the movies,

268
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,124
I'm Black and I'm gay.

269
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,375
He's going to kill me twice.

270
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:37,605
Do you want me to call Pat,

271
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:38,998
- that spirit guide?
- No, God.

272
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,695
I'm pretty sure
she does exorcisms.

273
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:43,263
Nobody ever wants
you to call Pat.

274
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:46,005
Listen, Malcolm's
drama is human drama.

275
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,833
You move throughout a room,
you create your own breeze.

276
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:52,141
It happens. Look at me
in my eyes and repeat after me.

277
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:55,362
This train does not stop
at crazy town.

278
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:57,494
- Holy shit.
- He's right.

279
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:01,498
I was pacing
and this drama is very human.

280
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,066
I kissed Mal,
he freaked and he ran,

281
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:08,157
I'm gonna call him again
and apologize again,

282
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,680
and then
he's gonna call me back,

283
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,378
and everything
will go back to normal.

284
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:16,470
- "Red is the color
of the recently deceased."

285
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,254
Holy shit.

286
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,865
Hey, Mal, it's me again.

287
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:25,044
Look, I... I'm really sorry
I overstepped.

288
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:28,221
Just please call me
or... or Gina.

289
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:31,659
Just call anyone,
so I know you're okay.

290
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:32,964
But I'm not, I'm not okay.

291
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,010
I'm dead.

292
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,055
The...

293
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:41,190
- orb, the orb turned...
- turned red.

294
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,321
The orb turned red.

295
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:43,888
I'm a motherfucking ghost.

296
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,816
Does anyone want
anything to drink?

297
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:49,546
I wouldn't say no
to some coffee.

298
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,071
How did I die though?

299
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,041
There must have been
a car accident, but then...

300
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,422
Oh, my God, where's my body?

301
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:56,945
Am I lying in a ditch?

302
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,470
I am lying in a ditch
and coyotes are eating my face

303
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,733
or, God, my balls,
and you're serving cupcakes?

304
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:04,779
Oh, God, you don't know
that I'm dead.

305
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,782
Oh, God, I'm dea...

306
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:09,784
Wow, it's getting windy again.

307
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:15,442
But if I'm lying in a ditch...

308
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,271
being fought over
by face-eating coyotes,

309
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:19,576
then why am I here?

310
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,099
Huh?

311
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:25,104
Why did ghost me
come to your house, Henry,

312
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:27,454
to... to haunt you, huh?

313
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,762
Is it because you know I'm dead?

314
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,983
Was it murder? Huh?

315
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,203
Huh.

316
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:39,683
The photos.

317
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,512
Were you stalking me?

318
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:43,643
Oh, my God.

319
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:46,951
What if I'm not in a ditch?

320
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:49,084
What if instead of in a ditch

321
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:53,262
I'm buried in your backyard
and instead of coyotes

322
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,441
eating my face, it's... it's worms
and snakes, and... and slug...

323
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,835
- When did it get so windy?

324
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,403
It's been a really weird day.

325
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,144
I just wish Malcolm would call.

326
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:07,058
Except you're so worried.

327
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,368
You didn't murder me. Oh, you
could never murder me. I...

328
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:14,939
I mean, I love you, but you're
just not that good of an actor.

329
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:19,070
Oh, God, you're going to be
so upset when they find my body.

330
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,337
Henry, I'm so sorry that I died.

331
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:25,686
Try to get some sleep.

332
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,818
I'm sure Mal
will show up in the morning.

333
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:29,516
Meanwhile,
I think it's safe to say

334
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:32,780
-that you are not being haunted by ghosts.
- Ha!

335
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,390
Bye.

336
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:38,438
So, I'm dead...

337
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,180
and you don't
believe I exist.

338
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:45,651
On the bright side though, I think
I figured out how to walk again.

339
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:58,545
How am I supposed to think
with the television on, huh?

340
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,692
No, no, no.

341
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,957
I may be dead, but I am here.

342
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:29,488
Fine.

343
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,187
You win.
It's a shitty day anyway.

344
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:43,981
Well, I'm not sleepy.

345
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,854
There's something
that nobody talks about,

346
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:47,984
about being a ghost.

347
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,692
Well, obviously,
this is really bothering you.

348
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:01,389
Whoa, I...

349
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,699
I just touched you.
I thought I couldn't touch you.

350
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,443
Huh.

351
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,053
Holy shit.

352
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,287
- Is someone there?
- God.

353
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,303
So windy.

354
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:46,174
Oh, God.

355
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,093
Well, let's see
you ignore this, hmm?

356
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:15,464
Huh, perfect timing.

357
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:23,994
Well, no, I did not call or
text, but if you look right here.

358
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,874
Okay, you want to put
a robe on or no? Nothing?

359
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:36,137
No, no. Motherfucker!

360
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,666
Good, you're only mostly naked.

361
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:47,975
Listen. I am here
and you have to deal with me.

362
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:01,596
Wow.

363
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,383
Weird.

364
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:08,343
No, not weird. Scary.

365
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,519
Be scared.

366
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,870
I'm haunting you
and it's fucking hard to do!

367
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:18,092
- Malcolm?
- Henry?

368
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:30,277
How did you see me?

369
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,454
Uh, see me again.

370
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:38,285
Great.

371
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,593
Now I'm hallucinating.

372
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,690
Okay, I know.
I'm sorry, you're working,

373
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,257
but you have
to pay attention to me.

374
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:03,397
Huh.

375
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:08,447
- Really?
- Yes, let's play our game.

376
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,321
It's fine.
I can do this all day.

377
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:15,323
I can do this forever.

378
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,454
Wait.

379
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:22,765
That's fine.

380
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:23,984
I can press other stuff.

381
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,861
Okay.

382
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:47,877
Okay, all right.

383
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,248
Now that I have your attention,

384
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,858
let me try to bring up some kind
of word, doc or something.

385
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:54,057
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

386
00:24:58,453 --> 00:24:59,976
Fine, fine!

387
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:02,457
Don't tell me
where you're going,

388
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:03,763
or when you'll be back.

389
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,417
I'll just be here.

390
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:09,638
For eternity.

391
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:13,599
Just kind of dead.

392
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:17,123
Very dead.

393
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:23,391
Very much regretting I did not
kiss you when I had the chance.

394
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:30,050
♪ Love is exhausted
and cannot rise ♪

395
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:36,186
♪ With aching bones
and blood shot eyes ♪

396
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:42,932
♪ Let's put away
this score we keep ♪

397
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:46,545
♪ Love is exhausted

398
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,025
♪ Let it sleep

399
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:54,901
♪ Heaven is waiting

400
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,600
What you been up to?

401
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:00,688
Ooh.

402
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:07,783
Oh, Thai food.

403
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:11,439
I miss Thai food.

404
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:15,269
Gina, hey, any word from...

405
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:19,708
No, me neither.

406
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:22,929
Yeah, I did.

407
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:26,149
In fact, I spent
the entire day checking out

408
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:28,108
hospitals and...

409
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,155
and morgues.

410
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:33,940
Christ, I'm sorry.

411
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,942
No, no, I didn't find him,
thank God.

412
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,422
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:42,078
There's no record of his car being
towed or impounded either, so...

414
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:45,604
Yeah, Malcolm has vanished
off the face of the earth.

415
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:47,780
I'm right here.

416
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:50,783
Yeah, I'm gonna
be up late tonight

417
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:52,785
didn't get any work
done today, so...

418
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,831
In fact, I probably better
get to it.

419
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,225
Okay.

420
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,053
All right.

421
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,269
Henry, it's Malcolm.

422
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:46,926
And I think you can only
hear me when you're asleep,

423
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:49,580
- so stay...
- Holy shit!

424
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,495
Malcolm, are you really there?

425
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:55,717
Wow, could I sound any crazier?

426
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:01,591
I have to pee.

427
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,734
Wow, what the hell?

428
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,910
Ta-da.

429
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,614
Stand in front of the mirror,

430
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,835
- maybe I can see you there.
- No need to shout.

431
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:28,881
I'm dead, not deaf.

432
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:32,275
But you're talking to me,
that's an improvement.

433
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,498
But you still can't see me.

434
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:47,987
This is insane.

435
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,172
I'm definitely losing it.

436
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,267
- Hello.
- Gina.

437
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:08,853
Remember that time
you and Malcolm played

438
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:10,749
that hilarious
April fool's joke on me?

439
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:13,012
Oh, God, you think
we're pranking you? Christ.

440
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:14,511
So, if this is
some kind of zany plan

441
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:16,450
to get me to call that
crazy ghost hunter lady,

442
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,061
and then Malcolm will jump out
and everyone will laugh,

443
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:20,454
let's get this over with.

444
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:46,872
- Definitely sensing
a presence over there.

445
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,940
Pat, this is why people don't take you
seriously, because of stuff like this.

446
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:54,044
Henry, how much are you
paying her? Because honestly,

447
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,340
whatever it is, it's too much.

448
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,929
The fact that you saw Malcolm in your
mirror this morning is significant.

449
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,715
Mirrors are windows
to the spirit world.

450
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,937
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

451
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:11,461
It's obvious,
you're hosting a spirit,

452
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,855
who senses your concern
for your missing friend.

453
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,816
May have taken on Malcolm's form
to catch your attention.

454
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:21,863
Or maybe it's me.

455
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:24,561
Are you sure it wasn't
actually Malcolm?

456
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:28,348
Not picking up
much of a male energy.

457
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:29,958
Wrong again, Pat.

458
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,004
It's definitely a female spirit,

459
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,049
or a childish one.

460
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:38,314
Yes, it seems to me
like a very sad, little girl.

461
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,621
Are you ever right,
like, about anything?

462
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,405
Whoever it was,
moving those photos,

463
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:45,234
that would have taken
tremendous, impressive effort.

464
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:46,365
Oh, thank you.

465
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:47,846
This spirit is trying very hard

466
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:48,976
to communicate with you.

467
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:52,067
Let's begin. Please take a seat.

468
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:04,688
Does that help somehow?

469
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:11,130
Are there any spirits out there
willing to speak to us tonight?

470
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,002
Yes, please.

471
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:16,483
I am here. I need your help.

472
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:27,624
- Anything?
- Yes, please.

473
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:29,496
I'm here. I need your help.

474
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:30,975
Nothing yet.

475
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:33,787
I don't know
why I thought this would work.

476
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,894
- Shit!
- Did you hear that?

477
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:39,332
- That was just the wind.
- The wind? No, no, fuck you!

478
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,725
Does the wind sound like that?
I'll give you a hint. No!

479
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:46,078
Wind... huh. But is it
actually windy outside?

480
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,340
Thank you.

481
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,081
I didn't notice
any significant wind

482
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:50,865
when I was driving here tonight.

483
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,085
I think this might be something.

484
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:55,783
I love you, you crunchy Goddess.

485
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,914
Yes!

486
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:58,960
There it is again!

487
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:01,484
She's trying to speak to us.

488
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,574
Still not a she. Yeah, but
you know, you're getting warmer.

489
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:10,232
- So you believe that the ghost...
- Um, wandering spirit.

490
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,977
The wandering spirit is trying
to communicate with us

491
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,371
through the wind?

492
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,809
- Through a wind like sound? Yes.
- Yeah.

493
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:25,160
But we should test this to be
sure it isn't some kind of

494
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:27,771
- strange feature of your house.
- What?

495
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:29,469
Okay, no, it's not the house.

496
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,079
I've lived here for years. Look,

497
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,473
if this really
is some kind of spirit,

498
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,692
we should try asking it
some yes or no questions

499
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:39,218
like one wind sound is yes,
two wind sounds is no.

500
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:41,785
- Sure.
- Do you understand that, sweetie?

501
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,614
- Yes!
- That appears to be a yes.

502
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,486
- Yes, it was.
- Great.

503
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:49,750
Now how about "Are you Malcolm?"

504
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,969
Yes.

505
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:55,147
Oh my goodness, I was
certain the spirit was female.

506
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,062
Let that go, Pat.

507
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,738
We should ask an obvious "no" question.
Otherwise we can't be certain.

508
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:04,025
- Sure, sure.
- Okay.

509
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:07,376
What's a good "no" question
for spirit Mal?

510
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:16,995
Oh, come on, that's not hard is
two plus two five. Am I a donkey?

511
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,998
Will Glenn Close
ever win an academy award?

512
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:24,002
I've got it. Are you straight?

513
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:29,703
- Oh. No.
- Well, that's a yes...

514
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,314
- I'm sorry, my bad. No!
- so... Oh, there it is.

515
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:33,794
- That's a no.
- Yeah.

516
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:36,057
Okay, Mal. Game over.

517
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:37,232
You can come out now.

518
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:38,886
- What?
- Oh.

519
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:42,411
You're a nonbeliever.

520
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,935
With all due respect, Pat,

521
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,026
pretty sure my friends
are using you to set me up.

522
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,244
Sadly, I encounter more of you

523
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,117
than I do wandering spirits
like Malcolm.

524
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:55,555
I hope you don't mind
if I continue my conversation.

525
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:58,210
Go crazy. I still don't know
how he's doing the whole

526
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,472
wind thing though.

527
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:00,821
- Malcolm.
- Mm-hmm.

528
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:02,388
Are you still there?

529
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:03,953
Yes.

530
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,914
I imagine this is very
upsetting for you.

531
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,046
Are you upset, dear?

532
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:10,700
- Yes.
- Oh, he's upset?

533
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:11,919
I'm the one being punked.

534
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,313
Do you know when
or how you died, dear?

535
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:17,620
No! Although, "Henry murdered
me" is back on the table.

536
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,535
- No.
- Do you know why you're here?

537
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,276
Why you haven't moved on?

538
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:23,713
No, no.

539
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:27,195
Do you remember attending
a party here on Halloween night?

540
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:30,938
- Yes.
- But you died shortly after.

541
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,071
- Yes.
- That's enough.

542
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:36,335
- This isn't funny.
- No shit!

543
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:37,858
Malcolm agrees.

544
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,774
I know you're struggling, Henry,

545
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:44,952
but you need to understand that
Malcolm came here for a reason.

546
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,867
You may not know yet
what that is, but...

547
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:50,349
No, I'm sorry,
Malcolm is not dead.

548
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,655
That's not possible.
I... I think...

549
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:57,268
I think you should go.

550
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:08,845
I must warn you. My schedule
is extremely heavy this week.

551
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,847
The fact that I had
this current time slot

552
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:13,589
free on such short notice
was sheer luck.

553
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,243
Or perhaps not.

554
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:17,245
Perhaps it was fate.

555
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:21,467
You've still got 15 minutes left
on your session, already paid for.

556
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:23,817
Why not let me use
that time to help you?

557
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:27,908
- Or more accurately, to help Malcolm?
- Mm-mm.

558
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:32,521
I feel certain you're not going to
be able to handle this on your own.

559
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:37,352
And the earliest I can squeeze you into my
schedule is a week from Thursday at four a.m.

560
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:40,138
No, thanks. I'm good.

561
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:41,878
You are going to call me.

562
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:46,492
But between now and then, when
you find yourself floundering,

563
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:51,279
The Crimson Bookis a useful
resource. It's pricey.

564
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,803
I know, but the e-book
is more economical.

565
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,892
You can download it
from my website.

566
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:58,678
Yeah, sure. Right.

567
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:00,984
If I need any help,
I'll buy your e-book.

568
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:02,115
Pat!

569
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:04,249
Please don't leave me.

570
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,381
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

571
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,296
Yeah, I'm over here, but thanks.

572
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:10,994
I must respect Henry's wishes.

573
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,214
You'll have to gather up
your strength

574
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:16,043
and convince him that you're
here through your own means.

575
00:36:16,565 --> 00:36:21,396
I wish you peace and safe
passage to the next dimension.

576
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:23,268
Back at you, babe.

577
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:24,660
All right, let's go. Come on.

578
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:33,060
My own means. My own means.

579
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:35,976
My own... My...

580
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,763
Gina, please tell Malcolm
that that was bullshit.

581
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,394
That was bullshit. She could have
helped me and you let her leave!

582
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,072
Okay, this game is over.

583
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:48,641
This game is not over
because it's not a game!

584
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,512
Where did you put
the speakers, Gina?

585
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:54,037
The speakers,
the speakers that sound windy

586
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:56,015
which is supposedly
the dead voice of dead Malcolm.

587
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,737
And let me tell
you right now, I am done.

588
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,652
Oh, you're done? You're done?

589
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:01,784
Oh, you can't hang up on me.
I'm hanging up on you!

590
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:04,222
Hang up on him, Gina,
definitely hang up on him!

591
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,432
Yeah, maybe I've known
you forever. But the fact that

592
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:09,096
you'd go along with this awful,
stupid, hurtful prank

593
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,553
just because I made the mistake
of kissing my best friend, well,

594
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,231
- that's just cruel!
- Cruel?

595
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,450
Cruel is thinking
that I would ever do

596
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,539
something to you
that stupidly cruel!

597
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:21,543
Cruel is not knowing
you wanted to kiss me

598
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:24,894
until after I was dead!

599
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:35,253
Please, don't be dead, Mal.

600
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:37,603
Oh, God.

601
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:42,869
Is it really you?

602
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:49,178
Yes.

603
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:53,706
I'm so sorry.

604
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:12,202
♪ I tried to find a way

605
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,989
♪ Out, out

606
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,295
Don't wake up, okay?

607
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:23,997
I have a lot of questions too.

608
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:27,348
I don't remember dying.

609
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,307
I don't remember you kissing me.

610
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:33,267
Which sucks
because I'm pretty sure

611
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:34,558
I would have kissed you back.

612
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:40,230
The orb is red now by the way.

613
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:45,671
This is a stupid dream.

614
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,152
Yeah.

615
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,026
It is a very stupid dream...

616
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:59,337
but let's see how much you
remember when you wake up, okay?

617
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:02,078
I don't want you
to be dead, Malcolm.

618
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,999
Mal? Malcolm?

619
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:29,367
Oh, my God.

620
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:44,947
Pat, it's Henry.

621
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:48,492
You were right and I apologize,
I'm really, really sorry.

622
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,170
Malcolm and I need you badly.

623
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,020
So if you can fit us in
before next Thursday

624
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:54,261
please do, and if not,
I'll see you then.

625
00:39:58,308 --> 00:40:02,225
Okay, this is where,
if this was a prank,

626
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:05,412
you would jump out at me and
mock me for the rest of my life

627
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,143
because this is where...

628
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,888
I am going to spend...

629
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:20,287
Holy fuck, $700 for an e-book?

630
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,463
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Oh.

631
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:25,118
And this is where
I'm hitting enter

632
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:28,208
and my credit card is going to
be charged 700 fucking dollars

633
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,698
because you've convinced me
that you're dead and haunting me

634
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:33,866
and I will live gladly with your
mockage till my own dying day.

635
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:36,172
Just please jump out
at me now, Mal. Please.

636
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,958
I... I wish I could.

637
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,798
I just bought a $700 e-book.

638
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:56,018
- Thank you.
- Let's see what this can tell us.

639
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,285
Whoa. This book has
infinity pages?

640
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:05,288
Oh, you can...
You can do search terms.

641
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:11,643
Spirit communications.

642
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:17,300
- Jesus!
- 17,430,000 pages of info

643
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:18,824
for spirit communication.

644
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:21,479
Spirit communication, comma,

645
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,830
spells? Whoa, really?

646
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,050
This book has spells,
like... spells?

647
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:35,536
Okay, uh, let's do this.

648
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:37,625
Uh...

649
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:46,242
While the night is dark
and the sun is bright.

650
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:55,513
Uh, I bid you a dance
unto my sight.

651
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:04,434
- That's okay. Not everyth...
Wait a minute.

652
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,828
What is this? Wha...
What is this?

653
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:09,614
No, no, no.

654
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:17,317
It didn't work.

655
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,275
The fuck, it didn't.
Make it stop.

656
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,277

Oh, God, thank God I'm dead,

I release you.

00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,470
What am I doing wrong?

669
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:27,430
That one. Bring you to me.

670
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:38,397
Binding spell.

671
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:43,098
- Yes.
- We need salt.

672
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:58,157
Okay, let's try this.

673
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,815
I bring you to my consciousness.

674
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:07,514
Whoa! That's new.

675
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,647
I bring you to me.

676
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:15,565
I bind you to me
and I bind myself to you.

677
00:44:22,355 --> 00:44:23,748
- Mal?
- Henry?

678
00:44:23,878 --> 00:44:25,663
- Henry?
- Malcolm. Malcolm!

679
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:30,406
The force-field thing is gone!

680
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,297
You couldn't touch me
and I couldn't touch you

681
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:33,995
- unless you were sleeping.
- Are you really dead

682
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:36,084
or were you just, I don't
know, temporarily invisible?

683
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:38,153
- Temporarily... I don't know.
- I mean,

684
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:40,765
you're back. Maybe you're really
back? Like, not dead back.

685
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:41,895
Y... Maybe.

686
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,680
Oh.

687
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:47,293
Oof...

688
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,079
Henry, whoa-whoa-whoa.

689
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,778
Pants. Pants.

690
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,258
- Oh, my God, I'm naked.
- Yes.

691
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:57,564
And as usual.

692
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:08,227
Fine!

693
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:12,144
Henry, don't get your hopes up

694
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:15,190
that I was temporarily
invisible or anything.

695
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,584
Things are still really hard
for me to move,

696
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,760
so I'm pretty sure I'm dead.

697
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:24,809
And you're still naked.

698
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:28,073
It's really me.

699
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:30,249
Ow. Don't do that.

700
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:31,467
- Ow.
- Ow.

701
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:34,122
Why did you say, "Ow,"
you pinched me?

702
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,515
Yeah, well, it hurt me too.

703
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:37,754
How can you be dead
and still get hurt?

704
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,693
I don't know. Ow, stop it.

705
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:41,086
- Ow.
- Ow.

706
00:45:41,216 --> 00:45:43,001
Well, that's a fun new rule.

707
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:45,220
You get hurt and I feel it too.

708
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:54,969
- You're actually here.
- And you're actually naked.

709
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:58,407
And you're still wearing
your green monster costume.

710
00:45:58,538 --> 00:46:01,517
Well, believe it or not, they didn't
offer me a change of clothes when I died.

711
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:04,022
- They? Who are they?
- No, I was making a joke.

712
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:08,113
I don't know what's going on.
I don't remember dying.

713
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:10,942
I just woke up here
and you couldn't see me.

714
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:15,773
- Oh, Mal.
- No, please, please don't.

715
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:18,296
So what do we do now?

716
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:26,914
I think you're gonna want to
start by putting on some pants.

717
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:28,307
Shit. Right.

718
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:33,051
Oh, hey.

719
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:35,618
Let's see if he can see you.

720
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:36,750
- Okay.
- Yeah.

721
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,013
- Yeah.
- Okay.

722
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:42,147
Uh, excuse me. Hi. Hello.

723
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:44,802
Hi, sorry to bother you.

724
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:46,455
I had some friends over
on Halloween,

725
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:48,806
and one of them never got home.
And I was wondering

726
00:46:48,936 --> 00:46:50,609
if you happened to see him
get into his car.

727
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:52,374
It was parked right here
in the driveway.

728
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:54,855
We're trying to put a timeline
together so we can find him.

729
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:56,422
Wow, that's intense.

730
00:46:56,552 --> 00:46:59,381
He was wearing
a green T-shirt and jeans,

731
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,035
uh, a little taller than me.

732
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:02,820
Very handsome. Uh, brown hair.

733
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,101
I wouldn't say very,
but thank you.

734
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,300
You can't see me, can you?

735
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:06,800
I definitely would
have remembered him.

736
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,912
Sorry, but no.

737
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,435
Can you hear me?

738
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:10,565
Is it windy?

739
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:13,482
Uh, okay.

740
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:14,744
Thanks, anyway.

741
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:28,671
Uh, would you...

742
00:47:30,195 --> 00:47:31,544
Thank you.

743
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:42,163
When Pat was doing her thing...

744
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,037
she asked me why I was here.

745
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,082
Well, the book says
you're probably here

746
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:50,868
because of some powerful
unfinished business.

747
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:51,998
Yeah.

748
00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:55,175
But what?

749
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:59,398
I didn't have a ton
going on in my life.

750
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:00,573
I am an only child.

751
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:01,835
Both my parents are gone.

752
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:03,271
I wasn't seeing anybody...

753
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:07,754
and honestly, I don't think I
was sticking around to copy edit

754
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,932
the thrilling follow up to
America's Favorite Serial Killer.

755
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:14,739
Do you think you were murdered?

756
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:16,217
Maybe we have
to find your killer

757
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:17,459
and bring them to justice?

758
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:18,678
I don't feel murdered.

759
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:20,114
What does murdered feel like?

760
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:22,203
I don't know. Maybe I'd remember

761
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:25,163
being scared or pissed off
or something.

762
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:26,860
But I'm just here.

763
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:31,909
I think the question
that we need to answer is

764
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:34,389
why am I specifically here...

765
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:36,739
at your house...

766
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:38,392
with you?

767
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:42,615
I think my unfinished
business is you.

768
00:48:46,662 --> 00:48:48,316
- Me?
- Yeah.

769
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,017
I think I'm still here...

770
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:56,934
to help you win
your happily ever after

771
00:48:57,064 --> 00:48:59,240
with hot neighbor guy.

772
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:04,723
Help me?

773
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:07,857
Yeah, you know, um, coach you,

774
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:11,252
help you break
the early relationship ice

775
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:12,514
because you suck at that.

776
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:18,520
You're serious...

777
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:23,743
You've always been
a hopeless romantic.

778
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:28,313
I think I'm still here
to help you find true love...

779
00:49:31,098 --> 00:49:32,186
And, you know,

780
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,755
hot neighbor guy
is the complete package,

781
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:39,977
and he has a... a pulse,
which is a plus.

782
00:49:41,065 --> 00:49:44,198
God, Mal, no. I... I don't want...
I'm not ready for it.

783
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:47,114
- That's... no. I...
- Well, you're never gonna be ready.

784
00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:51,466
So, if you're fine with me
being in purgatory for eternity

785
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:55,166
or wherever the fuck I am
with no sleeping and no cake,

786
00:49:55,296 --> 00:49:57,907
and not being able
to pick up things.

787
00:50:01,737 --> 00:50:02,897
Of course, I don't want that.

788
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:06,654
Well, good.

789
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:14,054
Uh, it's late. Those of us
who need to sleep need to sleep.

790
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:16,796
So, we will start
planning project

791
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:18,754
"Hot Neighbor Guy"
first thing tomorrow, yes?

792
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:22,019
Why am I standing up? You have
to go to bed.

793
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:26,153
Leave me the book, okay?

794
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,723
And could you put the screen
on "never sleep," please?

795
00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:42,952
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

796
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,365
Running?
No, I didn't like running

797
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:45,477
when I was alive.

798
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:46,695
I'll see you later.

799
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:48,131
Yeah. For your...

800
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,482
hot neighbor guy makeover.

801
00:50:51,874 --> 00:50:52,962
Yeah, great.

802
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:10,675
Whoa!

803
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:13,418
What the fuck?

804
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:31,566
Henry, Henry!

805
00:51:32,698 --> 00:51:34,395
Henry, stop it. Hey.

806
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:36,744
Stop.

807
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:41,750
♪ Too many empty days

808
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:44,536
♪ Too many nights by the TV

809
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:47,321
♪ When there is nothing to say

810
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:55,242
Henry...

811
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:56,722
Why are you sneaking up on me?

812
00:51:56,852 --> 00:51:59,116
I wasn't sneaking,
I was screaming

813
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:02,945
the whole time,
the whole 2.5 miles!

814
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:06,123
All of Sherman Oaks
thinks it's a windy day!

815
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:07,863
But why did you follow me?

816
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:09,343
You said you didn't want to run.

817
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:12,868
Well, it's not like I had
a choice, marathon man.

818
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:16,220
As soon as you ran,
I got dragged along behind.

819
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,351
You were dragged?

820
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,006
I think that binding spell did

821
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,097
more than make it just
possible for you to see me.

822
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:25,011
I... I think that
after 2.5 miles of that hell

823
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,101
that there is maybe
a 50-foot tether between us.

824
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:32,149
So, you know, do me a huge large
and don't drive off in your car

825
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:34,127
because I don't know
what would happen to me.

826
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,804
I... I had no idea.

827
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:37,415
Yeah, there's another thing.

828
00:52:37,545 --> 00:52:40,374
It's possible I'm bound
to your house too.

829
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:44,683
The farther away we got,
the more I felt like I was gonna

830
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:48,252
- dissolve or evaporate.
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

831
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:51,080
I'm much better
now that we're back.

832
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:53,474
But we should
probably check the book.

833
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:07,096
Goals and Desires
of the Wandering Spirit.

834
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:11,797
I never really
appreciated clouds.

835
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,062
Or how blue the sky was...

836
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,109
back when I was alive.

837
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:23,722
- But you always did.
- Photographer.

838
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,117
You always saw the beauty
in everything.

839
00:53:32,861 --> 00:53:35,342
Yeah. Remembering
all those times you tried

840
00:53:35,473 --> 00:53:39,172
to talk me into walking up
that fire escape to the roof

841
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:41,218
to watch the sunset
back in school?

842
00:53:41,348 --> 00:53:43,437
And I really regret not going.

843
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,441
Gina was right about our...

844
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:49,574
What is it? "Meet cute."

845
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:53,968
I mean...

846
00:53:55,623 --> 00:53:56,711
you were puking a lot,

847
00:53:57,843 --> 00:53:58,843
but in between...

848
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:03,675
you were so beautiful
and funny...

849
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:08,680
and you scared
the hell out of me.

850
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,901
So, I made up excuses.

851
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:14,816
I was a senior,
you were too young.

852
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:17,027
And then we were friends.
Don't want to fuck that up.

853
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:25,479
And I pissed it all away.

854
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:30,092
And now I'm dead.

855
00:54:30,658 --> 00:54:32,443
- Mal...
- Just listen, okay?

856
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:41,278
I fucked this up
because I was too afraid.

857
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:44,498
But you still have a chance.

858
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:46,283
You have this...

859
00:54:47,632 --> 00:54:50,199
golden shining chance

860
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,941
with a beautiful guy
who is completely into you.

861
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:55,466
So, let's go get him.

862
00:54:58,382 --> 00:54:59,818
That's what I want for you.

863
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:03,125
- Press "Play."
- "Play?"

864
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:07,391
Yeah. For 700 bucks, apparently,
you also get bonus videos.

865
00:55:08,696 --> 00:55:11,003
Pat has a lot to say about
wandering spirits, which,

866
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:12,874
apparently, is what I am, so...

867
00:55:16,051 --> 00:55:20,447
Wandering spirits, also known
as wanderers or haunters...

868
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:24,277
will be restless and in pain

869
00:55:25,191 --> 00:55:27,367
until their unfinished business
is complete.

870
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:29,761
- Are you in pain?
- Just watch.

871
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:32,894
Some wanderers have been
in agony for centuries.

872
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:36,811
Their pain has turned,
understandably, to anger.

873
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:38,422
The gentle approach?

874
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:41,642
Some kindness
will work in your favor

875
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:45,907
as you consult with the experts
who will help your spirit guests

876
00:55:46,038 --> 00:55:51,348
to find the closure they need and move
on to a place of pleasure and peace.

877
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:58,355
So that's what I want for me.

878
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:06,363
To move on to that place
of pleasure and peace.

879
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:10,497
ASAP, skip the centuries
of agony, you know.

880
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:18,462
I'll help you find closure.

881
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:21,725
Thank you.

882
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,992
Uh...

883
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:30,299
Go, uh, grab some clothes, okay?
We'll pick out your outfit.

884
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,437
I'm sorry. No, no, too slutty.

885
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:38,688
Uh, try the other one again.

886
00:56:45,271 --> 00:56:46,577
Henry?

887
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:50,102
Henry, you can't leave a message

888
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:52,432
like "Malcolm's a ghost"
and then not answer your phone.

889
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:55,281
Gina, so good to see you
respecting boundaries.

890
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,196
Uh, sorry,
I went for a run and...

891
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:59,348
-and then I had to take a shower...
- And then you're avoiding me.

892
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:02,114
- Don't deny it. No!
- Why don't we all sit, we can talk about...

893
00:57:02,244 --> 00:57:05,465
Remember that job in New Zealand
I was so excited about?

894
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:07,728
Carl's my first A.D.,
we have to get to LAX.

895
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:09,295
Oh, yeah.

896
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,426
Bad time for drama.

897
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:13,647
I'm so sorry
my dying inconvenienced you.

898
00:57:13,778 --> 00:57:15,954
Malcolm says
he's sorry that he died.

899
00:57:16,694 --> 00:57:18,870
You see him? Right now?

900
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:21,350
Oh, my God,
this is worse than I thought.

901
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:23,657
We took a Lyft over here.

902
00:57:23,788 --> 00:57:25,659
You need to put some clothes on

903
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:28,096
and drive us to the airport
while we talk about this.

904
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:30,751
Yeah, I'm not so sure that I'm
eager to get into a motor vehicle,

905
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:32,797
driven by a man
who has an invisible friend.

906
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,929
He's not insane,
he's having a mental breakdown.

907
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,365
And that's better how?

908
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:37,856
I'm sorry.
I can't leave the house.

909
00:57:37,932 --> 00:57:39,064
Malcolm might dissolve.

910
00:57:39,194 --> 00:57:41,414
You've got to admit that sounds

911
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:42,589
slightly less than sane.

912
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,720
But it's true.

913
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:45,113
Are you talking to him?

914
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:47,115
And we are getting another Lyft

915
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:49,466
to L.A.X. right now.

916
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:51,250
Good, there's one nearby.

917
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,036
Henry, sweetie,
Malcolm's not dead.

918
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:59,476
He's just a fucking coward who
ran away after you kissed him,

919
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:01,521
and now you're freaking out.

920
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:05,786
You really wanted this badly
and now you're hallucinating.

921
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:08,354
- Obviously.
- Obviously.

922
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:12,532
- Gina...
- I'm not surprised that Malcolm might dissolve

923
00:58:12,663 --> 00:58:13,968
if you leave the house.

924
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:15,819
You've always been
a little bit agoraphobic.

925
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:16,927
I'm not a...

926
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:19,823
- When do you get back?
- Late on Wednesday.

927
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:23,012
Oh, good. Pat's coming over
at four a.m. on Thursday.

928
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:25,365
- If I haven't helped Mal...
- Pat? The spirit guide?

929
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:28,374
The one who came over and then
you screamed at me over the phone

930
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,376
because this was all just
a mean joke

931
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,813
that I was supposedly
helping Malcolm play on you?

932
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:36,425
Is that the Pat that's coming over
on Thursday at four fucking a.m.?

933
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:39,516
Sorry, that... that was before Malcolm
convinced me that he was really here,

934
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:42,519
- and we did the binding spell...
- Oh, my God, binding spell?

935
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:45,019
- This is why we're getting a Lyft.
- It shouldn't be that hard

936
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:46,683
- to prove that you're really here.
- -Oh!

937
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,308
I once read a story
where there was a ghost

938
00:58:49,438 --> 00:58:51,223
and there was one person,
his grandson,

939
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,355
- who could see him, okay?
- Henry?

940
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,140
Hang on, Malcolm's telling
me something.

941
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,968
And so the grandson
used a book...

942
00:58:57,098 --> 00:59:00,841
Lyft's here. Uh, Henry,
it was so nice to see you.

943
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:03,844
Although I didn't expect to see
quite this much.

944
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:06,586
Henry, we have to go.

945
00:59:07,326 --> 00:59:09,371
If you really can't drive us
to the airport?

946
00:59:10,198 --> 00:59:11,722
I'm sorry, I... I really can't.

947
00:59:13,724 --> 00:59:15,595
I'll email you from New Zealand.

948
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:18,337
And listen, I know
that Mal is not dead,

949
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:20,905
because he just blocked me
from texting him.

950
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:23,342
- Someone's using your phone.
- Oh, my God.

951
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:25,692
Gina, tick tock.

952
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:28,956
Answer me when I email you.

953
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:31,611
Promise? Say it!

954
00:59:31,742 --> 00:59:33,308
I promise,
I'll answer your emails.

955
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:34,745
Thank you.

956
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:37,138
You're going
to get through this.

957
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:39,140
We'll get you the help you need.

958
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,808
Okay, I will be
hot neighbor guy.

959
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:56,549
I'm going to work,
getting in my car.

960
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,030
You are doing squats
in your front yard.

961
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,160
Do squats.

962
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:06,907
Okay, I would
definitely notice that.

963
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:09,562
But if I don't...
Keep squat... Keep...

964
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:13,610
If I don't notice,
then the next time you come up,

965
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,046
give me a wave, do it.

966
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:20,201
Is that how you're gonna wave?

967
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:21,748
Is there a better way?

968
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:24,316
You're hotter
than hot neighbor guy, okay?

969
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:26,144
So just wave like you know that.

970
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:28,973
Like, um, like, uh, like this.

971
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:33,324
Do that.

972
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:41,725
It's not, you know,
"Mrs. Tremblay, uh,

973
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,051
could I have the pass for
the little boy's room, please?"

974
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:45,661
- That is not what I did.
- That's exactly what you did.

975
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:47,774
It... it should be like,

976
01:00:47,905 --> 01:00:50,516
"Hey, hot neighbor guy.

977
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,607
You're looking good. And yes,
I am also looking good."

978
01:00:56,348 --> 01:00:57,479
Do that.

979
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,660
I mean, better.

980
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:08,577
Okay, so, okay,
so I'm heading to my car, right?

981
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,145
But don't wait for him
to come up to you.

982
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:12,886
You walk up to him

983
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,715
with that
king-of-the-world attitude

984
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,065
and you go, "Hey..."

985
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:21,241
I'm Henry.

986
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,381
Sorry, I didn't introduce
myself the other night.

987
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:27,858
Oh, by the way,
my missing friend turned up.

988
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:30,948
- "So he's okay."
- But you're not okay.

989
01:01:31,078 --> 01:01:33,298
But I will be
if you get this right.

990
01:01:34,168 --> 01:01:37,215
So he says,
"I'm glad to hear it.

991
01:01:37,824 --> 01:01:39,913
Hi, I'm Jizzy McMasturbator."

992
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:42,176
You want me
to spend the rest of my life

993
01:01:42,307 --> 01:01:44,004
with someone named
Jizzy McMasturbator?

994
01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:46,354
I really do. And by the way,
you're welcome

995
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:48,661
because now,
whatever his name actually is,

996
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,490
Irving Fartington or Bob Knob,

997
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,101
it still won't be as terrible
as Jizzy McMasturbator.

998
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:56,713
- Thanks.
- Yes, so moving on.

999
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:59,063
You say,
"Nice to meet you, Jizzy."

1000
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:01,456
Hey, I was wondering if you
wanted to go out sometime?

1001
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:03,110
"Maybe tonight,
grab some dinner?"

1002
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,330
But I can't go out.
You'll dissolve.

1003
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,375
Right. No going out.

1004
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,118
Uh, so you say, "Hey, Jizzy",

1005
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:15,296
I was wondering if you wanted
to come over to my house tonight

1006
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:20,824
"for dinner?" And that is way
too intimate for a first date.

1007
01:02:20,954 --> 01:02:23,130
So we'll work with that. Uh...

1008
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:26,655
Ah, you can say, "I make
a mean pasta arrabbiata,"

1009
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,005
which is true.

1010
01:02:28,614 --> 01:02:30,137
Are... are you getting all this?

1011
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:31,428
Do you want to write it down?

1012
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:35,118
Hey, Jizzy, my best friend's a
ghost who wants us to fall in love.

1013
01:02:35,142 --> 01:02:36,685
Want to come over
to my place for dinner?

1014
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:38,450
Hashtag, "Pasta."

1015
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:41,758
Fine. Make fun of the dead guy.
Just do it right.

1016
01:02:41,888 --> 01:02:43,063
Take it from the top.

1017
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:45,543
Walk toward me.

1018
01:02:47,328 --> 01:02:50,375
- Like you just did?
- No, walk like a duck.

1019
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:52,377
Yes. Walk like I just did.

1020
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:02,387
Okay, so try actually
walking like a duck,

1021
01:03:02,517 --> 01:03:04,258
because that's...
I don't know what that was.

1022
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:05,825
That was what you just did.

1023
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:07,803
- That wasn't what I just did.
- You did a spin.

1024
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:10,308
- It was... I...
- I did a spin because I was turning around

1025
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:12,136
to go a place.
You're just walking forward.

1026
01:03:12,266 --> 01:03:15,226
Do you think he's gonna be on
some kind of fucking lazy Susan?

01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,204
Did your friend ever turn up?

- Whoa.
- Sorry, I, um...

1067
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:23,441
I tried a new protein drink
this morning, and I guess

1068
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:26,009
it wasn't quite enough
before a heavy duty workout.

1069
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:30,056
Good. Good job.
What a save, my God.

01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:36,236
Oh, he is really into you.

1073
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:39,500
Hey, listen,
I gotta get to work,

1074
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:41,502
but do you want to have
dinner sometime?

01:05:42,155 --> 01:05:45,071
Yes, pasta here, tonight.

1076
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:47,508
Yes. How about you
come over tonight?

1077
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:50,294
I make a mean pasta.
Want to say seven?

1078
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,166
That sounds great.
I'll see you then.

1079

This is gonna be good.

1080
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:04,047
Rick seems terrific.

1081
01:06:04,177 --> 01:06:07,876
He is not afraid of jumping
head-first into a relationship

1082
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,748
with a total stranger.

1083
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:15,580
- Are you nervous?
- About Rick?

1084
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:18,496
No, about moving on.

1085
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:22,587
Oh, I don't know
what to feel about it.

1086
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:23,849
Um...

1087
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:28,593
I don't know how it will happen.
Like, maybe when you kiss him.

1088
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:31,378
Or maybe when you...

1089
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:34,641
you know?

1090
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,776
Do you want me
to sleep with him?

1091
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:41,519
Well, probably not tonight.

1092
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:45,088
Because you're you,
but, yeah, that's...

1093
01:06:46,698 --> 01:06:48,526
you know, part of
falling in love, so...

1094
01:06:49,483 --> 01:06:51,833
It's what I've always
wanted for you, to find your...

1095
01:06:52,617 --> 01:06:53,879
your Mr. Right, you know?

1096
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:57,056
But, hell, I don't know
how any of this works.

1097
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,973
You know, in order for me
to cross over it,

1098
01:07:01,756 --> 01:07:03,584
it might have to be glorious.

1099
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:10,026
Look, I'll do
whatever you need me to do.

1100
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:11,156
I just...

1101
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:13,638
I'm not sure
I can make it glorious.

1102
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:20,775
In case it happens fast and I
don't get a chance to say goodbye.

1103
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,302
Um, I need you to know
how grateful I am, truly.

1104
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:29,610
Not just for being my best
friend for years, but...

1105
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,187
Everything you've done
for me since.

1106
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:36,747
I do know.

1107
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,751
And... and I want you
to find peace. I...

1108
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:41,801
- I really do. I just wish that...
- Just don't...

1109
01:07:42,406 --> 01:07:43,276
say it.

1110
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:45,452
No, if... if this is goodbye,

1111
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,845
I get to say what I want.

1112
01:07:48,281 --> 01:07:49,630
I also get to do this.

short to drink shitty wine," but...

1134
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:25,770
tonight the excellent company
more than makes up for it.

Wow, that was...

1136
01:09:28,468 --> 01:09:29,643
douchey and charming.

1137
01:09:29,774 --> 01:09:31,515
I don't know
how a person does that.

1138
01:09:31,645 --> 01:09:33,430
Oh, he's a wine guy.
So that's the douchey.

1139
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,171
You know what?
And nobody's perfect.

1140
01:09:35,301 --> 01:09:37,825
If he was perfect,
that would be unsettling.

1141
01:09:43,004 --> 01:09:46,269
For the love of God, if you are going to
insist on listening to shitty pop music,

1142
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,899
the least you could do is listen
to something with a horn section.

1143
01:09:48,923 --> 01:09:49,923
You know what I mean?

1144
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:55,147
I, uh, I have to confess, um,

1145
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:57,628
this time,
I'm on your sister's side.

1146
01:09:57,758 --> 01:09:59,934
No. Really?

1147
01:10:00,674 --> 01:10:03,590
Well, I mean, I get it. My
sister also likes photography.

1148
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:06,245
You two must have similarly
faulty wiring in your brains.

1149
01:10:06,376 --> 01:10:08,204
Sorry, what did he say?

1150
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:10,597
- That's funny.
- No, it isn't.

1151
01:10:10,945 --> 01:10:11,945
I'm kidding.

1152
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,708
I appreciate the art
you have on your walls, I do.

1153
01:10:14,732 --> 01:10:16,429
It's just not my thing.

1154
01:10:17,082 --> 01:10:19,040
What is your thing?
Ask him what his thing is.

1155
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:21,173
I prefer my visual art
to be abstract.

1156
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:23,585
Or just wait half a second
for him to start talking again.

1157
01:10:23,654 --> 01:10:27,092
Jesus, does he ever stop? You know,
he hasn't even asked you what you do.

1158
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,573
Photos are just too basic.

1159
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:32,415
They're simple. I mean, I like
to think of them as windows,

1160
01:10:32,445 --> 01:10:33,664
you know what I mean?

1161
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:36,144
It's the ultimate in realism.

1162
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:37,711
Cut another window in your wall

1163
01:10:37,842 --> 01:10:39,496
instead of hanging
some stupid photograph.

1164
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:41,759
He said to the professional
photographer.

1165
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:45,241
There's nothing wrong with a,
uh, strong opinion.

1166
01:10:45,371 --> 01:10:48,809
There is when an idiot tells
the best photographer

1167
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,508
I've ever known
that his brilliant art is basic.

1168
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:54,859
At last, someone
who sees me for me.

1169
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:56,445
- You know what I mean?
- You know what I mean?

1170
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:58,602
You have a great laugh.

1171
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:02,388
And your eyes are majestic.

1172
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:03,781
Majestic? No.

1173
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:08,089
No, FYI, I have changed
my mind about his hat.

1174
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,527
- It's a stupid hat.
- He likes me.

1175
01:11:10,657 --> 01:11:13,443
He does. Very much, in fact.

1176
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:17,273
So much so that he's hoping
he'll stay for breakfast too.

1177
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:19,840
Nope, nope. Now it's time
to laugh in his face

1178
01:11:19,971 --> 01:11:20,971
and tell him to go.

1179
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:28,240
- I have a friend who recently passed who told me...
- I'm sorry.

1180
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:32,375
Well, he basically
agreed with you

1181
01:11:32,505 --> 01:11:34,855
that life's too short
to drink shitty wine.

1182
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:37,902
He was right. Here's to
only drinking the good wine.

1183
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:40,339
However, I would argue and...

1184
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,689
And as opinionated as you are,
Rick, I think you'd agree

1185
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:46,040
that 100 years of agony is way
worse than drinking shitty wine.

1186
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:50,218
Oh, fuck. No, Henry, no.

1187
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:51,437
I'm not sure I'm following

1188
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:55,702
but your eyes are like two tiny
universes pulling me in.

1189
01:11:56,224 --> 01:11:58,618
Tiny majestic universes.

1190
01:11:58,749 --> 01:12:01,404
Come on, this is
not what I want for you.

1191
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:06,147
What I mean is even shitty wine
can taste better over time,

1192
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:10,108
or at least
after your third drink.

1193
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:12,328
That's very profound.

1194
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:13,546
No, it isn't.

1195
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,465
Henry.

1196
01:12:20,248 --> 01:12:21,248
He... He...

1197
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,700
You want to take this
back to my room?

1198
01:12:37,178 --> 01:12:38,310
Absolutely.

1199
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:41,269
Mm-mm. No.
Oh, I've changed my mind.

1200
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,619
I don't want you to do this,

1201
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:44,553
and you don't want
to do this either.

1202
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:46,231
When you kissed me,
you felt everything.

1203
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,731
I know it because of the binding
spell. I feel what you feel.

1204
01:12:48,755 --> 01:12:50,931
And with him
you feel nothing. Henry?

1205
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,129
I'll be damned
if I don't put a stop to this!

1206
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:58,393
- I guess technically
I'll be damned if I do.

1207
01:12:58,765 --> 01:12:59,897
I don't give a damn!

1208
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:09,646
♪ Is it danger
drawing me closer? ♪

1209
01:13:10,255 --> 01:13:12,562
♪ Is it fear leading me back?

1210
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,130
It's kind of windy, huh?

1211
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:18,437
♪ I got nothing to hide

1212
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:21,353
I think it's just sounds windy.
It's a...

1213
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:23,921
- A feature of the house.
- What?

1214
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:26,880
You think maybe we can turn
the music down a little bit?

1215
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:28,882
Henry, you cut it out.

1216
01:13:29,013 --> 01:13:30,556
We don't have to do it
like this, all right?

1217
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,669
There's other ways.
We can do other stuff.

1218
01:13:32,799 --> 01:13:35,236
I'm sure... there's lots
of spells we can try.

1219
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:36,976
Other spells.

1220
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:43,897
Wow.

1221
01:13:44,028 --> 01:13:45,421
I want your dick in my mouth.

1222
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:49,512
That sounds glorious.

1223
01:13:59,783 --> 01:14:00,783
Shy, are we?

1224
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:03,439
I'm about to blow your mind!

1225
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:09,270
Oh.

1226
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:11,576
Ow!

1227
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:15,712
- Damn.
- Sorry.

1228
01:14:16,626 --> 01:14:18,149
I'm... I'm so, so sorry.

1229
01:14:20,194 --> 01:14:21,194
Whoa.

1230
01:14:24,938 --> 01:14:26,592
What the hell

1231
01:14:26,723 --> 01:14:28,681
are you doing? Get off of me.

1232
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:30,509
- I really can't.
- Why can't you?

1233
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,033
I'm stuck.

1234
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:34,905
Look, we need a safe-word

1235
01:14:35,035 --> 01:14:37,473
if you want to role-play,
or whatever this is.

1236
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:38,735
Malcolm.

1237
01:14:38,865 --> 01:14:39,997
That's a weird safe-word,

1238
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:41,172
but okay. Malcolm!

1239
01:14:41,302 --> 01:14:42,739
- Malcolm.
- No, I don't...

1240
01:14:42,869 --> 01:14:45,263
- Malcolm!
- Please get off.

1241
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:46,699
Will you stop?

1242
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,832
Yes.

1243
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:54,794
- Ow, I think I broke something.
- Oh, my...

1244
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:02,802
I am so sorry.

1245
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:07,372
I'm gonna go.

1246
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,069
That's probably best.

1247
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,897
Shit!

1248
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:21,691
♪ Is there an answer for me?

1249
01:15:25,129 --> 01:15:27,610
What is wrong with you?

1250

Friends don't let friends
fuck douchebags!

1251
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:32,003
Friends don't let friends
suffer centuries of pain.

1252
01:15:32,049 --> 01:15:34,791
- Yeah, well, this was worse.
- Than centuries of pain?

1253
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:38,142
- Yes. All right? Yes.
- Mal, I was trying to help you.

1254
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:40,579
- You said this was what you wanted.
- I was lying!

1255
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:44,888
And you were lying too.

1256
01:15:45,889 --> 01:15:47,717
When you kissed him,
I could feel it.

1257
01:15:48,326 --> 01:15:49,849
You don't even like the guy.

1258
01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:52,548
You could never love him.

1259
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:56,191
Because when you kissed him,
it didn't feel like this.

1260
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:09,869
You love me.

1261
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,567
I feel it.

1262
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:16,876
And I love you too.

1263
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:32,935
The book...

1264
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:37,767
says that
all spirits disconnect,

1265
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:42,423
that we stop worrying
about the people we left behind,

1266
01:16:42,554 --> 01:16:46,863
so I've been waiting to stop
caring about you and...

1267
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:52,912
But every minute that goes by,
it just gets worse.

1268
01:16:55,698 --> 01:16:57,221

Oh, the binding spell.

1276
01:17:47,488 --> 01:17:49,186
I feel everything you feel.

1277
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:51,753
- Everything?
- Yeah.

1278
01:17:52,842 --> 01:17:55,148
Holy fuck.

1279
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:57,934
I found the one perk
of being dead.

1280
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:13,863
That was glorious.

1281
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:16,256
It was.

1282
01:18:17,344 --> 01:18:19,259
But I guess it means
that shagging you

1283
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:21,653
was not my powerful
unfinished business.

1284
01:18:24,221 --> 01:18:28,747
I'm glad. I'm not ready
for you to go anywhere.

1285
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:35,145
Henry, I don't think
you've thought this through.

1286
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:37,189
What's the big deal?

1287
01:18:38,235 --> 01:18:40,237
So, you're a ghost. Who cares?

1288
01:18:40,585 --> 01:18:41,585
"Who cares"?

1289
01:18:41,978 --> 01:18:43,327
Okay, well, there's the fact

1290
01:18:43,457 --> 01:18:44,720
that I'm tethered to you,

1291
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:46,678
and when I leave the house,

1292
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:48,288
I feel like I'm gonna dissolve.

1293
01:18:48,854 --> 01:18:50,813
So, how are you
going to go to work?

1294
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:52,162
How are you gonna go anywhere?

1295
01:18:53,554 --> 01:18:55,513
I'll make the garage
into a studio.

1296
01:18:55,643 --> 01:18:59,430
- Clients will come to me.
- To get married in your garage?

1297
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:02,476
Talk about
a destination wedding.

1298
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:04,740
Okay.

1299
01:19:06,524 --> 01:19:09,005
I'll specialize in engagement
photos then.

1300
01:19:09,135 --> 01:19:10,310
You know, babe...

1301
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:15,228
people want to work with you because
of your beautiful outdoor shots.

1302
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:17,753
On the beach, in the mountains,
in the desert.

1303
01:19:20,059 --> 01:19:22,453
Okay, so I'll take
some time off.

1304
01:19:22,932 --> 01:19:25,761
- I have money saved.
- Enough for forever?

1305
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:28,024
Because that's maybe
how long I'll be here.

1306
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:30,243
Plus, you know, you eat.

1307
01:19:30,853 --> 01:19:32,768
- I'll get food delivered.
- Henry.

1308
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:34,507
Mal.

1309
01:19:37,555 --> 01:19:40,950
Can we maybe bask in the glow of
the glory for a few more minutes?

1310
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,134
I've been
wanting this for so long.

1311
01:20:17,595 --> 01:20:18,639
How...

1312
01:20:23,514 --> 01:20:24,732
To...

1313
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:25,863
Malcolm?

1314
01:20:34,307 --> 01:20:35,787
Now you wear clothes.

1315
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:37,962
What are you doing?

1316
01:20:39,704 --> 01:20:42,838
Well, I remembered
that you left the house

1317
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:44,796
back before
we did the binding spell.

1318
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:46,276
- You drove.
- Yeah.

1319
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:48,060
So, I was checking
the book to see

1320
01:20:48,191 --> 01:20:50,454
if we could break
the binding spell,

1321
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,325
just temporarily.

1322
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:54,893
Like, turn it off,

1323
01:20:56,808 --> 01:20:58,220
so you could go to work and then
when you come home, turn it on again.

1324
01:20:58,244 --> 01:21:00,986
- That's brilliant.
- In theory, yes.

1325
01:21:01,117 --> 01:21:02,335
In practice, no.

1326
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:04,860
The book says
that it's one and done.

1327
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:07,688
- That it's forever.
- Then we better not break the spell.

1328
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:16,045
Babe, I'm dead.

1329
01:21:17,437 --> 01:21:18,437
I don't care.

1330
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:21,130
We'll figure it out.
We'll make it work.

1331
01:21:22,355 --> 01:21:25,532
Uh, except, you know what?
I was, um...

1332
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:28,795
I was wrong...

1333
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:34,324
about you not being
my unfinished business,

1334
01:21:35,107 --> 01:21:37,153
because, um, the, uh...

1335
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:43,072
portal to
the spirit world is opening.

1336
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:50,209
Yes, the portal
to the spirit world...

1337
01:21:50,993 --> 01:21:51,993
is open.

1338
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:54,692
And the light...

1339
01:21:55,345 --> 01:21:56,824
The light is so beautiful.

1340
01:21:59,088 --> 01:22:00,350
Wait, are you serious?

1341
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:05,529
I'm being pulled toward
the light but I'm resisting.

1342
01:22:05,659 --> 01:22:07,009
I don't want to leave you, babe.

1343
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:10,185
Then don't.

1344
01:22:11,622 --> 01:22:13,493
Tell whatever is behind that
door to close it,

1345
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:15,452
your business is not done here.

1346
01:22:16,844 --> 01:22:18,672
But it is, I...

1347
01:22:19,412 --> 01:22:20,718
You know now that I love you,

1348
01:22:21,284 --> 01:22:22,415
and we had...

1349
01:22:23,112 --> 01:22:24,765
We had last night which was...

1350
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:27,724
everything to me.

1351
01:22:31,903 --> 01:22:32,948
I do have to go...

1352
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:36,952
because I'm dead
and you're not.

1353
01:22:38,823 --> 01:22:42,609
Just promise me
that you will not give up,

1354
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,960
that you will find somebody
who loves you...

1355
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,352
Mal.

1356
01:22:47,788 --> 01:22:48,876
As much as I...

1357
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:51,879
did.

1358
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:54,708
Please, I want more time.

1359
01:22:55,927 --> 01:22:56,972
I know this is hard.

1360
01:22:57,929 --> 01:22:59,539
I know it. It's hard for me too.

1361
01:23:01,802 --> 01:23:04,805
But I need your help
to get through the portal.

1362
01:23:04,936 --> 01:23:09,071
I need you to say
these words in Latin.

1363
01:23:09,723 --> 01:23:11,203
I can't say them. You have to.

1364
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:18,470
I love you.

1365
01:23:19,951 --> 01:23:21,039
Be happy.

1366
01:23:29,526 --> 01:23:32,529
Te amo. Es laetus.

1367
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:34,704
No.

1368
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,491
It was me saying that to you,
not what I need you...

1369
01:23:40,972 --> 01:23:42,278
Wait, you know Latin?

1370
01:23:42,408 --> 01:23:44,106
Yeah, I took it in high school.

1371
01:23:45,498 --> 01:23:46,586
Fuck.

1372
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:01,297
What exactly is the Latin
you want me to say?

1373
01:24:02,602 --> 01:24:04,126
Oh, you know, just...

1374
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:07,303
Vinculum abrumperes.

1375
01:24:08,826 --> 01:24:11,089
Terminus est fabula.

1376
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:15,050
Terminus est nunc...? Yeah.

1377
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:20,055
Fucking sever the fucking bond?

1378
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:22,709
I'm pretty sure the fucking part
is not in there.

1379
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,930
Fucking end the fucking story.

1380
01:24:26,713 --> 01:24:28,865
Sounds an awful lot like
something you'd say to break a,

1381
01:24:28,889 --> 01:24:30,282
oh, I don't know, binding spell.

1382
01:24:30,413 --> 01:24:31,675
Yes. Well.

1383
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:33,328
Yes.

1384
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:37,302
There's not really a portal
with beautiful light, is there?

1385
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:41,598
- No.
- Wow.

1386
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:46,211
You must really
not want to be with me.

1387
01:24:46,342 --> 01:24:48,735
No, that's not it at all.

1388
01:24:49,475 --> 01:24:51,216
Henry, I love you. I do.

1389
01:24:51,347 --> 01:24:53,000
I want to stay so bad.

1390
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:55,829
It's just that you deserve

1391
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,702
to be with somebody who's alive.

1392
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:00,920
Fuck you, Malcolm.

1393
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:04,099
Why do you get
to decide what I deserve?

1394
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:07,904
You couldn't take ten minutes to have
a conversation with me about this?

1395
01:25:07,928 --> 01:25:09,843
You just made up your mind to...

1396
01:25:09,974 --> 01:25:13,282
To... to trick me
into breaking the binding spell.

1397
01:25:13,412 --> 01:25:15,153
And then what?
You'd still be here,

1398
01:25:15,284 --> 01:25:16,459
but I wouldn't know it.

1399
01:25:16,589 --> 01:25:18,156
Someday, probably very soon,

1400
01:25:18,287 --> 01:25:19,967
because living here
without you would suck,

1401
01:25:20,071 --> 01:25:22,378
I'd move out thinking
you've gone on to Pat's place

1402
01:25:22,508 --> 01:25:24,858
of fucking peace.
But you'd still be here,

1403
01:25:24,989 --> 01:25:26,599
at the start of
centuries of agony.

1404
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,297
How could you do that to me?

1405
01:25:28,427 --> 01:25:30,690
I didn't think about that.

1406
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:32,518
Because you didn't talk to me!

1407
01:25:32,649 --> 01:25:35,086
I couldn't think about anything!

1408
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:37,915
But I can't let you
ruin your life...

1409
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:41,440
by being tied to a dead man.

1410
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:43,877
And I just want better for you.

1411
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:45,531
I've always wanted
better for you...

1412
01:25:47,881 --> 01:25:48,881
than me.

1413
01:25:50,754 --> 01:25:51,754
And there it is.

1414
01:25:55,237 --> 01:25:57,717
The reason we've only
had one night together

1415
01:25:57,848 --> 01:25:59,371
instead of 12 years of nights.

1416
01:26:01,939 --> 01:26:03,114
And you know what, Malcolm?

1417
01:26:03,462 --> 01:26:04,898
You're right.

1418
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,335
I do deserve better.

1419
01:26:07,988 --> 01:26:10,991
I deserve someone who loves me
enough to fucking fight for me.

1420
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,733
You're right. You're right.

1421
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:16,562
Okay, forgive me.

1422
01:26:16,693 --> 01:26:18,216
I'm sorry. I thought I was,

1423
01:26:19,086 --> 01:26:20,523
I thought
I was fighting for you.

1424
01:26:24,527 --> 01:26:25,832
You want to fight for me?

1425
01:26:28,008 --> 01:26:30,750
Fight for yourself,
fight for us.

1426
01:26:31,316 --> 01:26:33,840
Let's not give up until
we've read every fucking page

1427
01:26:33,971 --> 01:26:36,016
of Pat's $700 e-book.

1428
01:26:39,063 --> 01:26:42,153
- Babe, it has infinity pages.
- Exactly.

1429
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:04,828
Good morning.

1430
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:07,004
Hi. Good morning.

1431
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:09,833
Sleep okay?

1432
01:27:09,963 --> 01:27:10,964
- Yeah.
- Good.

1433
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:15,708
I'm pretty sure it's Gina.

1434
01:27:15,839 --> 01:27:17,710
Who else would call
three times in a row

1435
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:18,881
this early in the morning?

1436
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,236
What?

1437
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,151
No, that's not possible.

1438
01:27:24,282 --> 01:27:25,631
Ok... Okay. Okay.

1439
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,350
Gina says she emailed me photos
that you posted to Facebook.

1440
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:31,115
But I haven't
posted there in forever.

1441
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,857
Well, she says you posted last
night that you're in Las Vegas.

1442
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:37,164
Trying to remember the last time
I was in Vegas.

1443
01:27:37,295 --> 01:27:39,384
- Mayb...
- What the fuck?

1444
01:27:39,515 --> 01:27:42,082
- Who the hell is that?
- -It's clearly his new boyfriend.

1445
01:27:42,213 --> 01:27:44,607
- Uh, no, it is not.
- You really don't recognize him?

1446
01:27:44,737 --> 01:27:48,175
- No, neither does Malcolm.
- Henry, oh, my God, what kind of proof do you need?

1447
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:50,265
What the fuck am I wearing?

1448
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:52,330
Just 'cause it was posted
last night it doesn't mean...

1449
01:27:52,354 --> 01:27:53,594
That you're not in deep denial?

1450
01:27:53,703 --> 01:27:55,357
Actually, yes, it does.

1451
01:27:55,792 --> 01:27:58,708
Look closer at the one where
Mal's holding those VIP tickets.

1452
01:27:58,838 --> 01:27:59,838
Look at the date.

1453
01:28:01,711 --> 01:28:03,278
- November 3rd.
- Two nights ago.

1454
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:05,323
- Or a year and two nights ago.
- Nope.

1455
01:28:05,454 --> 01:28:07,020
That show just opened last week.

1456
01:28:07,151 --> 01:28:09,414
Those tickets cost around three
grand each, by the way.

1457
01:28:09,545 --> 01:28:10,807
Are you fucking kidding me?

1458
01:28:10,937 --> 01:28:13,200
Mal is not a ghost
because he's not dead.

1459
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:16,203
He's in Vegas, the little shit,
maxing out his credit cards.

1460
01:28:16,595 --> 01:28:18,467
It's time to step back
into reality.

1461
01:28:18,597 --> 01:28:20,904
Stop hallucinating
and move on already.

1462
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:22,122
Gina, I have to go.

1463
01:28:22,253 --> 01:28:24,168
Henry, wait, no, no, no. Wait.

1464
01:28:25,474 --> 01:28:27,780
Gina is right, you're not dead.

1465
01:28:28,912 --> 01:28:31,393
- I'm not?
- I don't know how your body got to Vegas,

1466
01:28:31,523 --> 01:28:34,047
but if your body is in Vegas,
then you're definitely not dead.

1467
01:28:39,749 --> 01:28:41,446
Pat! Just the person
I need to talk to.

1468
01:28:41,577 --> 01:28:43,057
You're on speaker
with me and Malcolm.

1469
01:28:43,143 --> 01:28:44,319
Gina asked me to call you.

1470
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:46,233
I've only got
a few minutes to talk,

1471
01:28:46,364 --> 01:28:48,845
- but she's very concerned.
- I think we may have been wrong

1472
01:28:48,975 --> 01:28:51,214
about Malcolm being dead,
because his body is in Las Vegas

1473
01:28:51,238 --> 01:28:52,651
while his spirit's
still here with me.

1474
01:28:52,675 --> 01:28:53,676
Is that even possible?

1475
01:28:53,806 --> 01:28:55,765
Well, it might be the result

1476
01:28:55,895 --> 01:28:57,723
of a demonic possession.

1477
01:28:57,854 --> 01:28:59,029
Demonic possession?

1478
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:00,485
Oh, my God, Mal.
Did you hear that?

1479
01:29:00,509 --> 01:29:02,859
Yes, I'm not dead!

1480
01:29:02,989 --> 01:29:05,122
I'm possessed by a demon.

1481
01:29:05,252 --> 01:29:07,298
Wait a second,
that sounds really bad.

1482
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:10,345
It's very rare.
And really only happens

1483
01:29:10,475 --> 01:29:14,218
when the vessel imprisoning
a demon is somehow unlocked.

1484
01:29:14,784 --> 01:29:16,307
Wait, whoa, slow down.

1485
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:18,807
How do you unlock a vessel?
And what do you mean vessel?

1486
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:21,138
- You mean like a boat?
- No, no, no, a vessel is...

1487
01:29:21,965 --> 01:29:24,402
Well, I'm sure you're familiar
with the legend

1488
01:29:24,533 --> 01:29:26,361
of the genie in the lantern.

1489
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:27,691
Yeah, we've seen Aladdin, Pat.

1490
01:29:27,797 --> 01:29:30,016
The genie is a type of demon

1491
01:29:30,147 --> 01:29:33,193
and the Lantern is the vessel
in which he's trapped.

1492
01:29:33,324 --> 01:29:35,370
- Okay.
- In that specific case,

1493
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:38,416
the vessel is unlocked,
at least temporarily,

1494
01:29:38,547 --> 01:29:40,375
when the Lantern
is polished or rubbed,

1495
01:29:41,027 --> 01:29:42,638
there are many vessels with

1496
01:29:43,203 --> 01:29:45,554
different individual ways
to unlock them.

1497
01:29:45,684 --> 01:29:47,207
Anything from say,

1498
01:29:47,338 --> 01:29:50,863
shaking the vessel,
to reciting a simple spell

1499
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,256
Open sesame.

1500
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:53,997
Shaking the vessel on Halloween?

1501
01:29:54,127 --> 01:29:55,302
Malcolm shook the orb.

1502
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:56,956
Well, there it is.

1503
01:29:57,087 --> 01:29:59,524
A crystal orb
is the most common vessel

1504
01:29:59,655 --> 01:30:01,396
- used to contain a demon.
- Priestess Pat?

1505
01:30:01,526 --> 01:30:03,006
Oh, is it time?

1506
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,312
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

1507
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,227
It's time, I've got to go.

1508
01:30:07,358 --> 01:30:10,056
The ceremony is about
to start. Peace.

1509
01:30:10,187 --> 01:30:12,581
Pat, no. How do we get
the demon back into the orb?

1510
01:30:12,711 --> 01:30:14,539
Check the book!
Check the crimson book!

1511
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:19,370
- Uh, okay, demonic possession, comma, orb.
- Good, good, good, good.

1512
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:21,416
Let's learn how this
motherfucker works.

1513
01:30:21,807 --> 01:30:23,461
- "First, never shake the orb."
- Too late.

1514
01:30:23,592 --> 01:30:25,376
- When the orb is red...
- The orb is red.

1515
01:30:25,507 --> 01:30:27,398
The demon has escaped,
and the hostage body's spirit

1516
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,946
- "must linger nearby."
- Hostage body's spirit,

1517
01:30:30,076 --> 01:30:31,750
you're really not dead.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

1518
01:30:31,774 --> 01:30:33,273
- You're not dead, you're not dead.
- Oh, my God!

1519
01:30:33,297 --> 01:30:34,690
I'm alive!

1520
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:38,345
How to rescue
the hostage body, comma,

1521
01:30:38,476 --> 01:30:41,087
demonic possession, comma, orb.

1522
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,612
We need to break the orb.

1523
01:30:44,874 --> 01:30:46,136
Let's break the fucking thing.

1524
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:47,746
First, we need to lure the demon

1525
01:30:47,877 --> 01:30:49,531
and the hostage body back here.

1526
01:30:49,661 --> 01:30:50,749
How do we do that?

1527
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,229
I know exactly
how to lure someone

1528
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:54,013
who spends $3,000
on tickets, but...

1529
01:30:55,188 --> 01:30:58,235
Jesus, we're gonna need
a shit ton of salt.

1530
01:31:00,759 --> 01:31:01,934
Thanks, Pauletta.

1531
01:31:03,283 --> 01:31:05,242
Well, I was going
to the store, so...

1532
01:31:05,372 --> 01:31:07,331
as long as
you're not cooking meth.

1533
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:09,551
You're not cooking meth,
are you?

1534
01:31:09,681 --> 01:31:12,379
Oh, God, no, I... I'm using it
to get rid of a...

1535
01:31:13,511 --> 01:31:14,511
a pest.

1536
01:31:15,165 --> 01:31:16,165
Oh.

1537
01:31:17,559 --> 01:31:18,603
Well, good luck with that.

1538
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:22,738
- She 100% thinks
you're cooking meth.

1539
01:31:51,462 --> 01:31:52,811
Okay, we're ready.

1540
01:31:54,378 --> 01:31:57,642
So, I'm gonna call the demon,
get him here.

1541
01:31:57,773 --> 01:31:59,209
He's gonna step
into a salt circle.

1542
01:31:59,339 --> 01:32:01,777
I'll break the orb
and you'll have your body back.

1543
01:32:03,082 --> 01:32:04,519
God, I hope this works.

1544
01:32:04,649 --> 01:32:06,956
It will.

1545
01:32:11,134 --> 01:32:13,440
It's going to voicemail,
I'm gonna leave a message.

1546
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:16,660
Hey, Malcolm.

1547
01:32:16,705 --> 01:32:18,794
It's Henry. How are you?

1548
01:32:19,142 --> 01:32:20,665
Haven't seen you
since Halloween.

1549
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,644
Uh, I just wanted to let you know
that the money finally came through

1550
01:32:23,668 --> 01:32:27,150
the, uh, $20,000
for the Gorfney project.

1551
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,022
And I'm gonna stop you
before you call me back,

1552
01:32:30,153 --> 01:32:31,826
because I know you're gonna
ask me to wire it to you

1553
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:34,200
and I'm sorry this time I can't.

1554
01:32:34,331 --> 01:32:36,420
I need your signature
for the tax forms

1555
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,291
and none of that
electronic bullshit.

1556
01:32:38,422 --> 01:32:40,903
You gotta come, give me
your old fashioned John Hancock

1557
01:32:41,033 --> 01:32:42,339
before I can release the check.

1558
01:32:43,732 --> 01:32:46,648
All right, that's it.
See you soon.

1559
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,042
That's brilliant.
All we have to do

1560
01:32:50,173 --> 01:32:54,481
is lure him into a salt circle,
break the orb and I'm free.

1561
01:32:55,874 --> 01:32:57,397
That sounds too easy.

1562
01:32:57,528 --> 01:32:59,574
You need it to be harder?

1563
01:32:59,704 --> 01:33:03,316
No, no. I just feel
like I'm missing something.

1564
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:05,623
We're ready... right?

1565
01:33:06,668 --> 01:33:08,017
And since we're in wait mode,

1566
01:33:08,887 --> 01:33:10,933
I'm gonna do a quick workout
out front, all right?

1567
01:33:11,063 --> 01:33:12,108
- Will you be okay?
- Yeah.

1568
01:33:13,762 --> 01:33:15,827
Oh, you know what? I'm gonna put
the rest of salt in the garage,

1569
01:33:15,851 --> 01:33:18,046
so that demon Malcolm doesn't
see it, get spooked and run.

1570
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:19,070
Good idea.

1571
01:33:23,554 --> 01:33:24,816
What are you not telling me?

1572
01:33:29,691 --> 01:33:32,737
Okay, this is new,
at least to me.

1573
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:38,482
"If you say...
' In hac oscula, meus es tu, '

1574
01:33:39,091 --> 01:33:42,486
you can force the demon
to possess you with a kiss."

1575
01:33:43,879 --> 01:33:45,968
Ew. Why would
anybody want to do that?

1576
01:33:46,577 --> 01:33:48,753
And here is something else
you didn't tell me.

1577
01:33:48,884 --> 01:33:51,538
"Do not risk breaking the orb
until the hostage body"

1578
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:54,933
is safely within the confines
of the salt circle.

1579
01:33:55,586 --> 01:33:57,283
"Doing so will... " What?

1580
01:33:57,675 --> 01:34:01,418
"Allow the demon to steal
the hostage body's soul

1581
01:34:01,548 --> 01:34:03,681
and take it back with him
to the beyond."

1582
01:34:05,814 --> 01:34:06,814
Fuck.

1583
01:34:10,122 --> 01:34:13,822
Jesus, demon me texts
like a teenager from 1995.

1584
01:34:30,969 --> 01:34:32,449
Well, that's a new exercise.

1585
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:41,676
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, did the demon call back?

1586
01:34:41,806 --> 01:34:44,983
Uh, he texted.
He'll be here around six.

1587
01:34:45,114 --> 01:34:48,334
Oh, great.
Okay, I'm almost done.

1588
01:34:48,465 --> 01:34:50,905
Once more around. Then I'm gonna
walk it a few times mindfully

1589
01:34:51,033 --> 01:34:52,164
to lower my heart rate.

1590
01:34:52,295 --> 01:34:53,295
- Okay.
- Okay.

1591
01:34:58,083 --> 01:35:01,130
Okay. Six is fine.

1592
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:04,176
I'll be home all day.

1593
01:35:04,655 --> 01:35:07,049
See you soon.

1594
01:35:13,925 --> 01:35:16,014
- It's him.
- It's too early.

1595
01:35:16,145 --> 01:35:19,025
It's probably just Pauletta. Joey's
doing this wrapping paper fundraiser...

1596
01:35:19,104 --> 01:35:21,063
It's not Pauletta,
it's him. I feel it.

1597
01:35:21,193 --> 01:35:25,154
Oh, okay. Well, just...
just stay here.

1598
01:35:25,284 --> 01:35:26,372
Okay?

1599
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:30,899
Why do I feel it?
I mean, I know it.

1600
01:35:33,249 --> 01:35:36,774
The orb, the orb.
Take the orb! Shit.

1601
01:35:40,822 --> 01:35:41,822
What's up?

1602
01:35:43,172 --> 01:35:45,237
My four o'clock canceled
and I was in your hood already,

1603
01:35:45,261 --> 01:35:46,523
so here I am.

1604
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:49,047
- Shit.
- Problem?

1605
01:35:49,482 --> 01:35:53,051
No, no problem. I just hadn't
printed out the tax forms yet.

1606
01:35:53,182 --> 01:35:55,382
Uh, why don't we go on back
and I'll print them for you?

1607
01:35:57,795 --> 01:35:58,795
Okay.

1608
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,804
So, how have you been?

1609
01:36:06,935 --> 01:36:08,215
Gina told me
you went up to Vegas

1610
01:36:08,284 --> 01:36:09,764
with some hot new guy.

1611
01:36:09,894 --> 01:36:11,722
- That's intriguing.
- Yeah.

1612
01:36:11,853 --> 01:36:13,071
No, that didn't end well.

1613
01:36:13,593 --> 01:36:15,595
Uh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1614
01:36:44,146 --> 01:36:45,887
There's no 20 grand, is there?

1615
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:49,325
- Fuck.
- Henry, smash the orb. Do it now!

1616
01:36:51,936 --> 01:36:54,025
I can see your invisible friend.

1617
01:36:54,852 --> 01:36:57,159
In fact,
now that we're reunited,

1618
01:36:57,289 --> 01:36:59,161
I know everything he's thinking.

1619
01:36:59,901 --> 01:37:01,206
Salt circle under the tarp?

1620
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:03,818
Nice try, but not gonna happen.

1621
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,825
I'm out of here but I think this
time I'll take the orb with me

1622
01:37:10,955 --> 01:37:11,955
just to be safe.

1623
01:37:13,653 --> 01:37:14,698
Stay back.

1624
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,830
Or what?

1625
01:37:20,922 --> 01:37:22,575
You gonna kill your boyfriend?

1626
01:37:23,185 --> 01:37:25,840
Because that's what will happen
when the orb breaks.

1627
01:37:26,144 --> 01:37:27,144
I'll be gone...

1628
01:37:28,233 --> 01:37:29,539
but I'll take him with me.

1629
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:31,846
Do it, Henry. Do it!

1630
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:33,890
Aw.

1631
01:37:36,024 --> 01:37:38,243
Malcolm is willing
to die for you.

1632
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,071
How romantic.

1633
01:37:41,507 --> 01:37:42,900
But he can't break
the orb himself,

1634
01:37:43,031 --> 01:37:44,162
you're gonna have to do it.

1635
01:37:45,598 --> 01:37:47,296
Stay back.

1636
01:37:48,688 --> 01:37:49,776
This is getting boring.

1637
01:37:50,299 --> 01:37:52,344
I think I'll just
break your neck.

1638
01:37:52,997 --> 01:37:54,912
I don't think so. In hac oscula,

1639
01:37:55,043 --> 01:37:56,871
- meus es tu!
- No, Henry. What? No.

1640
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:00,352
The demon will possess you.

1641
01:38:09,187 --> 01:38:10,493
Oh, my God, I'm back.

1642
01:38:11,624 --> 01:38:13,191
But, God, Henry,
what did you do?

1643
01:38:13,322 --> 01:38:15,498
No, no, no, you can't be dead.

1644
01:38:15,933 --> 01:38:16,933
Henry!

1645
01:38:20,982 --> 01:38:21,852
- Mal?
- Yeah?

1646
01:38:21,983 --> 01:38:23,506
- Are you back?
- Yeah.

1647
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,987
Yeah, yeah. It's really me.

1648
01:38:29,773 --> 01:38:32,732
Oh, oh, oh! God.

1649
01:38:32,863 --> 01:38:35,126
That's okay, let it out.

1650
01:38:35,257 --> 01:38:37,476
Let it out. You're doing great.

1651
01:38:41,785 --> 01:38:45,441
- I'm okay.
- How are you not dead?

1652
01:38:46,137 --> 01:38:48,923
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm really glad you're not dead,

1653
01:38:49,053 --> 01:38:51,838
but when the orb broke,
you weren't in a salt circle.

1654
01:38:53,362 --> 01:38:56,365
But I was. I made one outside.

1655
01:38:56,495 --> 01:38:58,933
Once more around, then I'm gonna
walk it a few times mindfully

1656

to lower my heart rate.

1657
01:39:04,895 --> 01:39:06,288
Oh, my God.

1658
01:39:07,289 --> 01:39:09,334
Your mindful cool down
was really

1659
01:39:09,465 --> 01:39:11,510
mindful salt circle making?

1660
01:39:12,772 --> 01:39:15,688
And you couldn't tell me
about it because...

1661
01:39:15,819 --> 01:39:17,362
Because the book said
that the demon would know

1662
01:39:17,386 --> 01:39:19,692
everything that you knew
when it got close to you, and...

1663
01:39:20,171 --> 01:39:22,565
Oh, no. Demon breath.

1664
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:24,740
I don't care.

1665
01:39:25,611 --> 01:39:28,049
I... I feel like
the demon smoked,
