1
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,178
Only time can teach us what
is truth and what is legend.

2
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,118
Some truths do not survive the ages.

3
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:32,899
But the legend of the child with
the blue eyes will live forever

4
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:36,539
and be whispered in all four
winds of the great white mountains.

5
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:41,137
We, the Yagahl, were hunters
of the mightiest of all beasts,

6
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:45,655
the manak. But our world began to change.

7
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:49,443
The manaks came later
and later to our valley

8
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:52,493
and there were times when
they did not come at all.

9
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,909
Our hunters grew restless,

10
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,437
and our people grew hungry.

11
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:05,403
Only one amongst us, the
one we called Old Mother,

12
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:10,224
the last of her kind, only she could
speak to the spirits of the earth

13
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:16,684
and ask the wisdom of the
Fathers to save our people.

14
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,890
Many times she asked.

15
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:28,123
Until one night, they answered
her call and sent us a sign.

16
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:35,538
A sign of the beginning of the end.

17
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:40,562
We found her in the mountains.
She was holding onto a dead woman.

18
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,139
The Fathers have sent her.

19
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,642
She came to tell us

20
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:37,419
of four-legged demons that
will put an end to our world.

21
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:45,707
They will come to our
valley at the time when

22
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:48,912
we go on our last hunt.

23
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:53,076
But do not fear.

24
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:59,215
From this hunt, a warrior will arise.

25
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,039
And this one will be his woman.

26
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,612
They will lead us into a new life

27
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:12,334
where the Yagahl will
know hunger no more.

28
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:20,478
That night, Old Mother did not see
the face of the warrior which spoke,

29
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:24,565
but she knew that the
child with the blue eyes

30
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,583
was a blessing that she must protect.

31
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:33,453
To our people, she was Evolet,
the promise of life.

32
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:39,302
To a boy named D'Leh,
she was much more than that.

33
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:56,565
Only one of the Yagahl did not
believe in Old Mother's prophecy:

34
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,503
The young boy's father,

35
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:04,690
the one who carried the White Spear
and blew the whistle for the hunt.

36
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:09,056
I will watch over your
son as if he were my own.

37
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:12,024
I know you will.

38
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:15,824
But promise me you will
tell no one why I left.

39
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,793
We cannot wait for the last hunt.

40
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,091
Throw again! Good throw!

41
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,883
Ka'Ren.

42
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:42,974
Ka'Ren.

43
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:46,015
No, not you.

44
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,578
Your father abandoned our people.
Go away.

45
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,883
Leave him!
Ka'Ren, I said, leave him!

46
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:05,099
- D'Leh...
- He's the son of a coward.

47
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:07,588
You never say that again.

48
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:10,492
Any of you.

49
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,304
You are alone. Like me.

50
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:37,353
What happened to your people?

51
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:39,493
They were killed.

52
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:42,407
By four-legged demons.

53
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:55,740
You will never be alone, Evolet.

54
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:05,297
Do you see that light?
That one?

55
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,373
It does not move across the
sky like all the others do.

56
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:13,643
That light is like you, in my heart.

57
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:16,132
It will never go away.

58
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:18,475
It will never go away?

59
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,353
No. Never.

60
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:25,450
Evolet, come here.

61
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:28,632
Don't stray from the
hut without telling me.

62
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:38,054
And for many moons Evolet and
D'Leh looked at each other,

63
00:07:38,344 --> 00:07:42,924
and the love in their
hearts grew stronger.

64
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:54,727
Until finally, after many years,

65
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:59,278
the day of the last hunt arrived.

66
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,967
D'Leh, how long do we
have to keep watching?

67
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:04,846
Until the manaks come.

68
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:09,668
- And when will they come?
- I don't know.

69
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:14,751
- D'Leh, when will I become a hunter?
- When you stop asking so many questions.

70
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:24,851
Great hunter Tic'Tic
came to Old Mother's hut.

71
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:27,668
She thinks the time of prophecy has come.

72
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:30,108
She told him not to
kill the manak this hunt.

73
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:33,449
She thinks Ka'Ren
will win the White Spear

74
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,810
and claim Evolet.

75
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,680
Baku, look what I found for you.

76
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,336
You know what a good hunter Ka'Ren is.

77
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:47,930
We must run away.

78
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:50,481
Together we can cross
the Great Mountains.

79
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:53,898
Abandon our people?
Like my father?

80
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,649
I cannot do that.

81
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:01,509
I've waited for this so many moons.

82
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:05,691
The only way to be together is,

83
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:08,694
I must kill the manak.

84
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,998
They are here! They are here!
Look!

85
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,339
Look how many they are!

86
00:09:56,408 --> 00:10:00,776
Today, I will not pierce
the heart of the manak.

87
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:02,871
It will be one of you.

88
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:06,082
One of you will claim the White Spear.

89
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:11,284
May the Fathers of the Yagahr
and the spirit of the mighty manak

90
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:12,717
choose the best of you.

91
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:19,591
- Ka'Ren, you have the first throw.
- Ka'Ren, the manak is yours.

92
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:20,557
You will be our leader.

93
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,531
D'Leh, what about you?

94
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:30,918
I want to win Evolet.

95
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:36,467
All together, at once!

96
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:11,818
Tic'Tic found the lead bull.

97
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,826
Slow down! D'Leh!

98
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:16,616
They're breaking away!
Hold him back!

99
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:42,738
Baku, they are coming!

100
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,255
They are coming! They are coming!

101
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:48,173
They are...

102
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:03,199
The last one is coming!
It is a big bull!

103
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,758
D'Leh is coming!
Ka'Ren, make your throw!

104
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:42,056
Keep him low!
Hold him back!

105
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:56,386
He's too strong.
Let go, Ka'Ren.

106
00:13:57,133 --> 00:14:01,597
- D'Leh, we have to let go.
- I can't. My hand is caught.

107
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,689
Look, look!
It's D'Leh!

108
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:43,856
You killed him!
All alone!

109
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:46,044
No one has ever done that.

110
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:50,652
That was brave.

111
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:56,704
D'Leh killed the manak.
He did not let go of the net.

112
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,196
He was the only one.

113
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,947
What are you waiting for?

114
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,969
Wise Spirit, I killed the manak.

115
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:15,383
I claim the White Spear.
And with it my woman.

116
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:30,033
From that day on,
D'Leh was no longer the son of a coward.

117
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:34,336
Now the Yagahl would honor his name

118
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:40,170
for bringing to them the blessings
of the manak for one last time.

119
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:44,761
And though Old Mother
was pleased in her heart

120
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,810
to see Evolet so happy,

121
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:52,361
she feared in her soul that the
one who had slain the mighty beast

122
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:57,028
did not have the courage
for what was to come.

123
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,874
Why does Tic'Tic not celebrate with us?

124
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:18,486
- D'Leh?
- There's something I must do.

125
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:36,272
What do you want?

126
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:45,481
I was not brave.
And I did not hunt as one.

127
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,776
The Fathers of the Yagahl
played with us today.

128
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:54,147
What should I do?
If I give up the White Spear, I give up Evolet.

129
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:55,518
What should I do?
If I give up the White Spear, I give up Evolet.

130
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,506
Is she yours to give up?

131
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:06,463
It is not the way of the Yagahl to
claim the White Spear with a lie.

132
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:32,306
- I gave the White Spear back to Tic'Tic.
- Why would you do such a thing?

133
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:36,911
- I did not kill the manak, Evolet.
- Yes you did. You held on to the net.

134
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,606
No, I lied!

135
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:45,971
I tried to let go with all the others.
My hand was caught in it.

136
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:50,567
Then the manak ran into my spear.

137
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:54,107
I did nothing!

138
00:18:57,994 --> 00:19:01,907
Evolet, remember what I
told you about our light?

139
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:06,417
I still feel the same.

140
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:10,201
You will always be in my heart.

141
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,683
That will never go away.

142
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:17,415
But still...

143
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,560
you're giving me up.

144
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,741
That night the great white rain
came to the valley of the Yagahl.

145
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:45,524
And like an icy rain, sadness
fell over D'Leh's heart.

146
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,882
And with the white rain
came the four-legged demons.

147
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,675
Stay here.

148
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,195
Moha!
Watch out!

149
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,944
Baku, hide you!
Yes mother.

150
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:56,342
We cannot help them.

151
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,748
Let me...

152
00:22:22,864 --> 00:22:24,439
Let me go!

153
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,764
- What are you doing?
- I'm going after them.

154
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,734
Over the Great Mountains?
That is not possible.

155
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:09,185
They came over the Great Mountains,
did they not?

156
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,986
- They are demons. Maybe they can fly.
- I did not see wings on them, did you?

157
00:23:13,286 --> 00:23:16,110
You think you can bring a God down alone?
Who are you?

158
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,576
He is not alone.

159
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:21,716
I go with him.

160
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:24,677
Without the other hunters,
we all will die.

161
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,843
- I will go too.

162
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,826
- No, Baku, you will stay here.

163
00:23:30,214 --> 00:23:32,714
But you, Ka'Ren, you must go with him.

164
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:46,034
Don't touch me!

165
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:03,372
And as they bade farewell to the
elders and the children of our people,

166
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,629
the Wise Spirit of the Yagahl

167
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:10,324
blessed them and the
spears by their sides.

168
00:24:11,297 --> 00:24:15,790
Old Mother knew they would
never be hunters again

169
00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:18,790
but warriors since then.

170
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:35,479
It will be night, so we stay here.

171
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:36,396
No, we go on. We are getting closer.

172
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:40,614
I cannot see in the dark, can you?
We stay here.

173
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:44,382
We stay here, we eat and sleep.

174
00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:55,081
Why do you not carry the White Spear?

175
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:01,193
Are you afraid?

176
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:04,081
- Answer!
- Ka'Ren, go to sleep.

177
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:22,541
Baku? Baku!
What are you doing here?

178
00:25:22,576 --> 00:25:24,497
- Go home!
- I can help you.

179
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:28,479
- I can carry the water bag.
- Go home!

180
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:31,354
They killed my mother!

181
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,269
He's alone.

182
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:38,617
He will only slow us down.

183
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,004
D'Leh, I'm thirsty.

184
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:12,048
- The fire still lives in these stones.
- D'Leh!

185
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,709
She is alive.
We must hurry!

186
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:43,945
Why is Old Mother freezing?

187
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:02,650
White rain is not a friend of the hunter.

188
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:06,731
It swallowed all the marks of
the stolen brothers and sisters.

189
00:27:10,186 --> 00:27:15,947
It was now to the Fathers of
the Yagahl to guide their way.

190
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:24,819
And they walked for many days
and night to a faraway land

191
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:24,943
where the Great Mountains ended

192
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:30,748
and where the story of the
child with the blue eyes began.

193
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:37,604
The place where the four-legged
demons killed Evolet's people.

194
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:48,401
We've walked for days now.
And still no marks!

195
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:51,275
- Maybe they do have wings.
- Maybe they do.

196
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:53,352
But our brothers and sisters do not.

197
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:07,913
Don't forget to chew.

198
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,610
Maybe she only lost it.

199
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:40,310
- It is hot here.
- Baku, stay close.

200
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:28,709
What was that?

201
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:21,027
- We must free them tonight.
- Not tonight.

202
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:22,352
This is not a good place.

203
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:26,595
They know there is danger out there,
and they keep a good watch.

204
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,144
We do the same.

205
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:31,048
I will go first,
then Ka'Ren, then you.

206
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,707
D'Leh! Come!

207
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:56,184
I understand your pain.

208
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:59,030
But you must be patient.

209
00:32:58,484 --> 00:32:59,330
D'Leh!

210
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:05,270
I will never give you up again.

211
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:11,950
This way!

212
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:14,045
Go!

213
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:46,960
D'Leh!

214
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:49,627
Run!

215
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:10,810
Over here! This way!

216
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:21,134
Ka'Ren!

217
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:01,351
Run! Run!

218
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,230
Tic'Tic! Go!
Tic'Tic!

219
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,411
D'Leh, Evolet, up here!

220
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,356
- D'Leh!
- I'll get the boy!

221
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,249
- No, do not go!
- I will come back for you. I promise.

222
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,262
Baku!

223
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:29,970
You should not be here.

224
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:52,644
I think he speaks of D'Leh.

225
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:16,193
D'Leh will come back.
He promised it to me.

226
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:58,927
- Ka'Ren, do you think he's still alive?
- Does not matter now.

227
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,952
He tried to save us!

228
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,695
Forgive me, Tic'Tic.
I should have listened to you.

229
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:59,410
Tonight, I'll bring you food.

230
00:40:40,264 --> 00:40:43,979
<i>Old Mother was watching over
their journey with all her strength</i>

231
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:47,241
<i>and her spirit stayed
always by their side.</i>

232
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,698
<i>But that night she could not
rule over the forces of the earth</i>

233
00:40:55,932 --> 00:40:59,180
<i>and could not stop the
waters of the heavens.</i>

234
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:07,609
D'Leh would have to face alone the
mighty beast who rules these lands.

235
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:16,337
Do not eat me when I set you free!

236
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:20,296
- I feared you were dead.
- Do not fear for me.

237
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:22,827
Look, over there.

238
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:26,540
There was an attack.
I heard them screaming.

239
00:43:27,292 --> 00:43:30,270
This is where they went.

240
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:44,340
Tic'Tic, move away.
Come!

241
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:50,427
D'Leh, come back.

242
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,095
Move away!

243
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:12,230
You must remember me. I gave you life.

244
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:57,545
Speak to the Spear Tooth?

245
00:46:01,808 --> 00:46:03,515
How do you come to speak our words?

246
00:46:33,134 --> 00:46:34,530
Do not like Naku food?

247
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:38,639
It's different, but good.

248
00:46:48,447 --> 00:46:51,327
- We come from over the mountains.
- We know where you come from.

249
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:53,763
How do you know?
How do you come to speak our words?

250
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:56,435
A man come from the mountain before.

251
00:46:56,899 --> 00:47:01,003
He was looking for a new land.
Our wise man told me to learn his words.

252
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:03,568
You, you have his face.

253
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:15,780
What happened to him?

254
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:18,494
He was taken a long time ago.

255
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:20,665
Taken where?

256
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:24,232
Come.

257
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:27,682
When your father came to us,
he became my friend.

258
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:31,752
Then the evil spirits stole your father,

259
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,614
like many of our people.

260
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:36,676
They bring them to the
nest of the great birds

261
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:39,662
and fly away over the sand.

262
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:42,763
Where do they take them?

263
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,369
To the Mountain of the Gods.

264
00:47:47,804 --> 00:47:50,169
No one has ever returned.

265
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:55,286
Our wise man says you will lead us there.

266
00:47:57,419 --> 00:47:59,628
Me?

267
00:48:00,596 --> 00:48:02,303
We have a telling that

268
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:04,978
one day the one will come

269
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,738
who will free our people.

270
00:48:12,925 --> 00:48:15,717
The one who speaks to the Spear Tooth.

271
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:21,378
And as the brave people of
the Naku buried their dead,

272
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,216
they sent word to all
the tribes of the land

273
00:48:26,456 --> 00:48:29,363
that the one who speaks
to Spear Tooth had come.

274
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:35,296
Their call was a call for war.

275
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:40,722
Why do they think I
can free their people?

276
00:48:47,585 --> 00:48:49,523
There's something you must
know about your father.

277
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:55,712
When your mother died bringing you life,

278
00:48:58,595 --> 00:49:02,301
your father took upon himself
not only the weight of you,

279
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:04,488
but all our people.

280
00:49:05,031 --> 00:49:06,350
We were starving.

281
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,412
He could not wait for Old
Mother's prophecy to come true.

282
00:49:12,591 --> 00:49:14,180
Your father did not run away.

283
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:17,592
He left to save our people.

284
00:49:17,902 --> 00:49:19,685
How could you let me
believe all this time

285
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:21,895
that my father betrayed us?

286
00:49:22,245 --> 00:49:24,531
Because he wanted you to be that way.

287
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:28,098
Your father carried the White Spear.

288
00:49:28,952 --> 00:49:31,200
He feared that when he left,
others would follow him

289
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:34,223
and abandon our people.

290
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,101
And why do you tell me this now?

291
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:41,806
A good man...

292
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:45,344
draws a circle around himself
and cares for those within.

293
00:49:48,475 --> 00:49:49,778
His woman, his children.

294
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:55,352
Other men draw a larger circle and
bring within their brothers and sisters.

295
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:58,765
Some men

296
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:00,586
have a great destiny.

297
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,727
They must draw around themselves

298
00:50:04,153 --> 00:50:07,368
a circle that encloses many, many more.

299
00:50:09,387 --> 00:50:12,993
Your father... was one of those men.

300
00:50:17,102 --> 00:50:18,770
You must decide for yourself

301
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,519
whether you are as well.

302
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:38,876
This is Kawu, our fastest runner.

303
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:43,825
He bring voice from the
people who live that way.

304
00:50:45,191 --> 00:50:46,798
They stole many more men.

305
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:49,949
And now they are moving
to the great birds, fast.

306
00:50:50,223 --> 00:50:52,674
We must find them before
they reach these birds.

307
00:51:09,384 --> 00:51:10,970
You have no woman?

308
00:51:12,671 --> 00:51:14,296
The day before you came,

309
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:17,079
they took her life.

310
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:20,685
And they stole our son.

311
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,358
I am Baku.

312
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:46,479
- Tudu.
- No, I am Baku.

313
00:51:47,925 --> 00:51:51,233
Baku, Tudu.
Baku, Tudu.

314
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:17,557
He's killing him! You must help!

315
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:52,045
<i>The word of the Naku traveled fast
and from all winds came many warriors.</i>

316
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:57,538
<i>The TukTuk, who move like big running
birds and hide their eyes behind trees.</i>

317
00:52:52,047 --> 00:53:06,893
<i>And from the valley without sun came
the ones with blood on their heads.</i>

318
00:53:08,236 --> 00:53:10,746
<i>But the strongest of
them all were the Huta.</i>

319
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,846
<i>Their leader spoke for all
the warriors of the land.</i>

320
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:32,088
Tell him if his people walk with us,
we will bring them down.

321
00:53:39,604 --> 00:53:42,012
He says you are only a boy.

322
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,747
Tell him I am older than I look.

323
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:53,368
Quina is a Hoda. Hoda do not laugh.

324
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:29,261
<i>They walked faster and faster and
did not slow down to eat or to rest.</i>

325
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:33,240
<i>And more spears joined
them with each passing day.</i>

326
00:54:41,973 --> 00:54:44,396
This word "yahala", what does it mean?

327
00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:47,690
They are your words:
"We must bring them down."

328
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:06,674
The great birds have arrived.

329
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,167
Evolet!

330
00:55:28,427 --> 00:55:29,533
Evolet!

331
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:31,924
Baku, D'Leh's here!

332
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:13,440
Tudu, that man with the spear,
he will not give up.

333
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,581
Him and her.

334
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:19,617
Maybe the boy is right.

335
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,517
D'Leh cannot fly over
the water like they can.

336
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:24,450
But who the fuck could
fight so many spears?

337
00:56:31,244 --> 00:56:33,150
This river moves like a snake in the sun.

338
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:37,984
He says the eye of the
snake rest under the sun

339
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:42,810
and under the moon does not move.

340
00:56:42,845 --> 00:56:44,268
Is there a shorter way
to the head of the snake?

341
00:56:49,612 --> 00:56:53,059
We must look beyond the Great Sand.
But no one can walk that far.

342
00:56:53,672 --> 00:56:57,752
The mountains and the sand,
they all look the same.

343
00:56:58,506 --> 00:57:00,701
And we will lose our way.

344
00:57:01,406 --> 00:57:03,602
We will all day.

345
00:57:07,205 --> 00:57:09,402
We will find the head of the snake.

346
00:57:11,073 --> 00:57:13,269
And we will free our people!

347
00:57:35,235 --> 00:57:36,057
We must rest.

348
00:57:38,196 --> 00:57:41,006
<i>The man from the river
had spoken the truth.</i>

349
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,966
<i>They had walked in circles for
many days and lost their way.</i>

350
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:51,217
<i>And the eye of the snake
was nowhere to be found.</i>

351
00:58:46,654 --> 00:58:49,884
Tic'Tic, Tic'Tic...
I found the eye of the snake!

352
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:51,760
You see that light? That one?

353
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,694
Remember what the river people said?

354
00:58:54,729 --> 00:58:57,713
It rests under the sun,
but under the moon it does not move.

355
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:00,816
Nakudu, tell them what I said.

356
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:03,008
It will guide us to
the head of the snake.

357
00:59:21,336 --> 00:59:24,665
<i>And as the last moon had come
to the valley of the Yagahl,</i>

358
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,257
<i>it seemed that all spirits
had left Old Mother.</i>

359
00:59:29,075 --> 00:59:32,462
<i>She did not eat or speak for many moons</i>

360
00:59:33,212 --> 00:59:38,157
<i>because she knew there was
one last destiny to fulfill.</i>

361
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:39,296
Wise Spirit...

362
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:41,850
It's me, Katan.

363
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,328
The mountains of the gods

364
01:00:26,271 --> 01:00:27,429
and the head of the snake.

365
01:01:43,754 --> 01:01:45,966
- Evolet, you are well?
- Ssh, don't speak.

366
01:01:59,074 --> 01:02:00,154
Baku, over here!

367
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:08,429
How can a man do such a
thing to a father manak?

368
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,683
They are not men like us, Baku.

369
01:02:10,908 --> 01:02:12,834
Then what are they?

370
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:14,747
Some say they came from the stars.

371
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:18,582
Others believe that they
flew across the Great Water

372
01:02:18,617 --> 01:02:19,836
when their land sank into the sea.

373
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:38,823
The ones they force to do their work,

374
01:03:49,836 --> 01:03:50,887
They are even more.

375
01:03:52,593 --> 01:03:54,343
You think they will fight with us?

376
01:03:55,629 --> 01:03:57,499
That is for you to find out.

377
01:04:52,631 --> 01:04:54,497
D'Leh! D'Leh!

378
01:04:58,149 --> 01:05:00,305
Do not be afraid, Baku.
I'll bring you home.

379
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:07,427
- Where is Evolet?
- The women sleep in different huts.

380
01:05:07,461 --> 01:05:09,927
But I saw her today.

381
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:15,409
Tic'Tic is waiting with
many spears by the sand.

382
01:05:15,443 --> 01:05:19,735
They killed Moha today.
He was sacrificed.

383
01:05:19,769 --> 01:05:23,960
It is my mistake that they
are in this terrible mess.

384
01:05:24,023 --> 01:05:25,217
I need your forgiveness.

385
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:31,111
The Fathers chose you to lead us.

386
01:05:31,145 --> 01:05:34,243
And we will stand by your side.

387
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:43,253
Tell them how many spears we have.

388
01:05:49,215 --> 01:05:53,411
The number of spears does not matter.
Men cannot bring down Gods.

389
01:06:18,492 --> 01:06:20,740
He says the blind man
knows much about the Gods.

390
01:06:22,606 --> 01:06:24,166
He was once their servant, but ran away.

391
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:26,856
They have hidden him here ever since.

392
01:06:26,891 --> 01:06:28,097
Wise man..

393
01:06:30,232 --> 01:06:32,336
Tell us more of these Gods.

394
01:06:42,071 --> 01:06:45,330
They were three,
but now there's only one left.

395
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:46,673
There must be a way to defeat him.

396
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:54,936
He said, once, only once he heard the God

397
01:06:55,357 --> 01:06:57,811
speak of one he fears.

398
01:06:57,845 --> 01:07:01,493
They have a telling of
one who wears the mark

399
01:07:01,527 --> 01:07:04,552
that you can see in the sky at night.

400
01:07:04,586 --> 01:07:08,221
They call it Uruana,
"the Mark of the Hunter".

401
01:07:10,398 --> 01:07:13,517
The brightest star of all heaven.

402
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,291
He asks if you wear
the Mark of the Hunter.

403
01:07:32,143 --> 01:07:34,611
Without the mark,
you cannot bring down the God.

404
01:07:47,343 --> 01:07:49,201
Wait, wait. The band on your arm.

405
01:07:50,513 --> 01:07:54,190
Where did you get it?

406
01:07:54,224 --> 01:07:57,966
- The man who saved his life.
- Where is he?

407
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,438
His bones are buried in the
sand with all the others.

408
01:08:05,126 --> 01:08:06,701
He wants to know why you ask of this man.

409
01:08:06,884 --> 01:08:09,478
He was my father.

410
01:08:38,685 --> 01:08:40,468
Ask him where Tic'Tic is.

411
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:45,061
They got on us!

412
01:09:47,771 --> 01:09:50,221
I am full of days.

413
01:09:50,852 --> 01:09:52,223
Please, great hunter, do not say that.

414
01:09:52,863 --> 01:09:55,074
We need you.

415
01:09:57,606 --> 01:09:59,713
They will not fight with us.

416
01:10:00,502 --> 01:10:03,999
They have their own prophecy.

417
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:11,941
A prophecy has many faces,
many ways to come true.

418
01:10:11,976 --> 01:10:13,912
Your father, he gave this to me.

419
01:10:14,534 --> 01:10:18,917
- No, great hunter, this is yours--
- Take it.

420
01:10:24,197 --> 01:10:25,002
Be as your father.

421
01:10:35,588 --> 01:10:36,726
Be as your father.

422
01:14:27,037 --> 01:14:29,701
I know how it feels
to lose a good friend.

423
01:14:32,128 --> 01:14:34,624
Your father was mine.

424
01:14:35,396 --> 01:14:37,479
I barely remember him.

425
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:39,932
He remembered you.

426
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:46,685
His heart hurt when he spoke about
a boy beyond the Great Mountains.

427
01:14:46,968 --> 01:14:49,982
He was preparing to
leave to go back to you.

428
01:14:50,499 --> 01:14:53,694
That is when he was taken.

429
01:14:59,098 --> 01:15:00,960
D'Leh,

430
01:15:00,994 --> 01:15:02,828
the men are waiting.

431
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:03,762
We, the people of the Yagahl,

432
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:08,146
hunt the mightiest of beasts, the manak.

433
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:14,939
He is great and we are small,
and still we bring him down.

434
01:16:20,556 --> 01:16:23,700
Because we hunt together. As one.

435
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:27,814
When the sun arises,

436
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:32,923
we will join our brothers and
sisters on the Mountain of the God

437
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:35,960
and convince them to fight with us

438
01:16:35,965 --> 01:16:38,302
together, as one!

439
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:09,143
What just happened?

440
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:14,658
Listen, Baku, today you
must become a hunter.

441
01:17:14,693 --> 01:17:15,708
Me?

442
01:17:21,819 --> 01:17:23,789
"Yahala."

443
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:14,301
Look. That one.

444
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,312
Baku, we found the real bull. Go.

445
01:19:23,937 --> 01:19:25,567
Ka'Ren, look!

446
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:31,271
We must go everybody up the ramp! Go, go!

447
01:19:31,272 --> 01:19:35,705
Ka'Ren! No!

448
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:16,950
Stop!

449
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:03,206
He says the one who follows
this woman should turn back,

450
01:23:03,441 --> 01:23:05,212
or she will die.

451
01:23:09,481 --> 01:23:11,710
Like this traitor.

452
01:23:16,046 --> 01:23:20,324
Turn back to your mountains.
You can take your woman.

453
01:23:29,127 --> 01:23:32,241
Tell him I'll take his offer.

454
01:23:35,415 --> 01:23:38,489
Tell him I accept.

455
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:41,623
Tell him!

456
01:23:46,928 --> 01:23:49,426
But I will take all my people with me.

457
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:55,281
Each and every Yagahl.

458
01:23:56,994 --> 01:23:58,410
Tell him!

459
01:24:14,608 --> 01:24:15,592
They are yours!

460
01:24:17,672 --> 01:24:19,872
Ask him what will happen to the others!

461
01:24:39,286 --> 01:24:40,336
They belong to the God, he says.

462
01:24:41,457 --> 01:24:43,317
They will do his work. Forever.

463
01:24:48,599 --> 01:24:50,217
No..

464
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:54,463
I will not!

465
01:25:18,033 --> 01:25:20,190
He is not a God!

466
01:25:48,908 --> 01:25:51,710
D'Leh!

467
01:26:14,059 --> 01:26:15,702
No!

468
01:27:22,783 --> 01:27:24,123
Nooo!

469
01:27:45,389 --> 01:27:48,081
Help! Help!
She is bleeding!

470
01:28:33,817 --> 01:28:35,957
You came for me.

471
01:28:50,217 --> 01:28:53,206
Please, no. Please.

472
01:29:52,492 --> 01:29:54,429
<i>To have journeyed so far,</i>

473
01:29:55,032 --> 01:29:58,047
<i>to have walked till the end of the world</i>

474
01:29:58,051 --> 01:30:00,544
<i>to bring down the one
they call the Almighty</i>

475
01:30:00,579 --> 01:30:03,817
<i>only to return without Evolet,</i>

476
01:30:04,818 --> 01:30:08,075
<i>this was not what Old
Mother had foretold.</i>

477
01:30:16,859 --> 01:30:18,752
<i>But just as she was lost to him forever,</i>

478
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:23,496
<i>the legend of the child
with the blue eyes began</i>

479
01:31:44,519 --> 01:31:48,147
<i>Evolet had brought the
promise of life to our people.</i>

480
01:31:49,493 --> 01:31:52,051
<i>And now, with her last breath,</i>

481
01:31:52,783 --> 01:31:55,452
<i>Old Mother had given it back.</i>

482
01:32:01,186 --> 01:32:03,691
Your father wanted to
bring these back to you.

483
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:06,880
They will feed your people.

484
01:32:06,914 --> 01:32:10,303
Tell them the people of the
Yagahl thank the Naku people.

485
01:32:21,684 --> 01:32:23,044
Thank you, brother Nakudu.

486
01:32:27,395 --> 01:32:29,669
My heart walks with you, brother D'Leh.

487
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:45,366
<i>That was the last time they
saw their friends the Naku.</i>

488
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:53,589
<i>And then the long journey home began.</i>

489
01:33:08,775 --> 01:33:10,550
They're back! They're back!

490
01:33:17,434 --> 01:33:20,299
<i>And as the ones who
walked with the Fathers</i>

491
01:33:20,336 --> 01:33:21,750
<i>looked down on them and guided their way,</i>

492
01:33:22,752 --> 01:33:25,492
<i>so the Yagahl looked to Evolet and D'Leh</i>

493
01:33:25,527 --> 01:33:28,575
<i>to guide their people.</i>

494
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:34,637
<i>And when the first moon was
born again to their valley,</i>

495
01:33:34,671 --> 01:33:38,824
<i>it brought with it the
first fruits of their land.</i>

496
01:33:38,858 --> 01:33:41,487
Look how fast it is growing.

497
01:33:51,347 --> 01:33:55,717
<i>And so it came to pass
that the promise of life</i>

498
01:33:55,751 --> 01:33:58,636
<i>was fulfilled.</i>
