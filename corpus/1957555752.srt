Okay, on the count of three,
say "lobster!"

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,734
One, two, three...

12
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:29,367
Lobster!

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,400
♪ ...I will be there for you ♪

14
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,900
- Aw.
- But that made me hungry.

15
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,900
And we are in Maine...

16
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,443
Do you guys want
to get some lobster?

17
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:37,800
Yeah, sounds good to me.

18
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:41,600
There is supposed to be a place
around here that's really good...

19
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:43,476
- I knew you would know.
- On the next block.

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,567
Yes!

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,066
- Great.
- Let's go.

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Do you guys realize

23
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,967
this is our first get-together
since Italy?

24
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,567
Oh, we really can't count that
as a "get-together."

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,700
It was Emma's wedding.

26
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,543
Oh, technically,
that was still a get-together...

27
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,567
There just wasn't any antiquing.

28
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,876
Well, I made up for that
this time.

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,460
Yeah, no kidding!
We did so good, but...

30
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,633
Eh, "but..."

31
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,076
It's not as good
as San Francisco,

32
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,500
is that what
you were about to say?

33
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:05,500
No. That's it.

34
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,500
Because we found the veil
in San Francisco?

35
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,500
Well, you know...

36
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:12,100
I know you both feel
connection to the veil

37
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:13,300
because you think

38
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:14,676
it brought you together
with your significant others.

39
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,433
- Well...
- But Finn and I were together

40
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:18,300
before we found the veil.

41
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,567
Yeah, speaking of Finn,

42
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,333
you haven't mentioned him much
this weekend.

43
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:23,700
Is everything okay?

44
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,433
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

45
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:27,934
In fact, he has a job audition

46
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:30,500
for the Los Angeles Symphony.

47
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,934
Oh. That's a detail
you managed to skip.

48
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't really like
thinking about it.

49
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:37,333
What happens
if he gets this job?

50
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:39,242
He's hoping that
I'll move out there with him.

51
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,500
Well, what are you hoping?

52
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:43,266
I want him to get the job,
you know?

53
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,066
I mean, it's what he wants,
it's what he deserves.

54
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,233
Yeah.

55
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:49,500
But moving to Los Angeles
is not exactly what I want.

56
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:52,200
Well, if ever there was
a quintessential New Yorker,

57
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,333
it's you.

58
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,700
And seriously, what would
the Yankees do without me?

59
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,166
I mean, I really worry
about that.

60
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,300
Okay, I'm just saying,

61
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,934
since you are the one
to have the veil next,

62
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:04,433
and you never know
what might happen,

63
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,287
you might just want
to make sure it's ready,

64
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,367
you know, just in case.

65
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,200
Your faith in the veil is...

66
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,333
Inspiring?

67
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,533
I was gonna say scary.

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,276
- Can we go with sweet?
- Thank you.

69
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,800
I think she's right.

70
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,609
I think you... you should just
get it fixed.

71
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,900
It had that little snag in it
when I gave it to you.

72
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:22,333
All right.
I will take it in.

73
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,533
Okay.

74
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:24,976
But it's not like I'm gonna
need it anytime too soon.

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,834
Yes, that is exactly
what I said...

76
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:28,367
Right before I met Paolo.

77
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,333
Oh! Look! Lobster!

78
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,367
Of course.

79
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,000
Leland! Good morning.

80
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,667
Ah, good morning.
How was your weekend?

81
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,667
Wonderful.

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,834
On the last day, I found

83
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:57,533
the most incredible
19th-century map of Manhattan.

84
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,233
Impressive.

85
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,776
And I think
you're going to be impressed

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,376
with a document
that's coming in tomorrow.

87
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,266
What is it?

88
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,133
It's a surprise.

89
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:05,367
But I will say

90
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
it means a lot to me,

91
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:08,767
as I suspect it will
for you, too.

92
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,567
Well, I'm dying of suspense,
wondering what it is.

93
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,767
Well, I'm sure you have

94
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,467
more pressing things
to get on with, mm?

95
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,042
Yes, I'm still working on
the guest list for the party.

96
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:17,066
It's hard to narrow down.

97
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,967
I'll leave it
in your capable hands.

98
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,333
Thank you.

99
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,567
- Good morning.
- Morning.

100
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,066
What do we have here?

101
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Uh-huh.

102
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:30,100
Beautiful.

103
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,300
Aren't they?

104
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,266
Yes, spectacular.

105
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,266
You know, these are gonna
be at the auction

106
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,266
and they're not that expensive.

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
As tempting as that sounds,

108
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,433
I spent the weekend antiquing
with Avery and Emma.

109
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,087
So you'll be
brown-bagging it all week?

110
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:41,934
'Fraid so.

111
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,066
Ah.

112
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,433
Oh! I almost forgot.

113
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,800
They just dropped off
the invitations.

114
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,834
Oh, fantastic.
Yeah, I need to get those out.

115
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,133
Yeah.

116
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,276
- Oh, it looks so nice.
- Yeah, they're nice, right?

117
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,300
Great.

118
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,100
You bringing Finn?

119
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,367
If he's in town.

120
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,900
I guess
that's a 50/50 proposition.

121
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,266
Always is.

122
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,133
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,066
I know this is all
a little bit rushed.

124
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,734
And you have to get
to the airport.

125
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,367
I have a little time
before my flight,

126
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,860
and I thought
we should probably...

127
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,533
talk about this whole
L.A. thing in person.

128
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:23,633
It did happen all of a sudden,
didn't it?

129
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:24,834
It did.

130
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,242
But, you know,
if I get this job,

131
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,133
it means that

132
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,576
I wouldn't have to move
into your place,

133
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,160
and whatever place
that we find in L.A.,

134
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:32,166
that would be... ours.

135
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,800
You know,
this place was hard to find.

136
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:37,166
Ten blocks from my job,
two blocks from the park.

137
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Think of it this way...

138
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,467
If I get the job,

139
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,834
we won't have to suffer
through another New York winter.

140
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,834
- "Suffer"?
- Yeah.

141
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,333
Please. It's not that bad.

142
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:48,000
And I like the snow.

143
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,373
A little sunshine would be nice.

144
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,133
But I still have to audition.

145
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,033
This is the L.A. Symphony.

146
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,433
This is Principal Trumpet,

147
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,200
and there is gonna be
a lot of competition.

148
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,333
They would be lucky to have you.

149
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,900
Thanks.

150
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,166
Would I still have you, though?

151
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,066
I know I'm asking you
to give up a lot.

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,233
And you're asking me to live
in all that sunshine...

153
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,934
Just think how I'd get burned!

154
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,633
Come on, you look great in red.

155
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:26,600
But there is the possibility
that I won't even get the job,

156
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:27,867
- so...
- Oh, come on.

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,367
You're gonna get it.

158
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,867
You're that good.

159
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,533
I guess we'll find out
in a couple of days.

160
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,934
Yeah.

161
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:38,467
And you know, I just think
we should talk about it

162
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,467
some other time,
when we have more time.

163
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,643
I mean, you... You have to go!
I hate how you're always...

164
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,476
- Yeah. I know, I know.
- Late for the airport.

165
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,533
I should get going.

166
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,567
Okay.

167
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,533
Good luck.

168
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,834
I really mean it.

169
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,433
I know you do.

170
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,166
Okay.

171
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,266
Knock 'em dead!

172
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,900
All right!

173
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:21,867
- Oh, hey, Stanley...
- Hey.

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,467
Did the appraisal come in
on the George Washington letter?

175
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,876
Oh, you're on the money,
as usual.

176
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,300
Well, I've worked for Leland
for ten years,

177
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:29,576
I should be good at this by now.

178
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Yeah, well,

179
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,109
after a few more years,
you'll be the new Leland.

180
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,767
Whoa! Easy on
the promotion, there.

181
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,967
I'm happy where I am.

182
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,000
Well, I won't be happy
if you move to L.A.

183
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,667
Aw, 'cause you'd miss me?

184
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,734
Yeah, no,
but I'd miss the drama.

185
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,233
You're very entertaining.

186
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,807
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

187
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,033
It's Finn.
The audition must be over.

188
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,100
Well, are you gonna
answer it, or...?

189
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,800
I...

190
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:52,767
Okay.

191
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,900
Yeah, yeah. Go.

192
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,166
Finn, hi! How did it go?

193
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,000
Better than I could've
possibly imagined.

194
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,700
They offered me the job
on the spot.

195
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,100
Wow! That's incredible.

196
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,834
Yeah, I keep pinching myself,

197
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,734
but, I mean,
this seems to be real.

198
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,907
Hey, listen, I'm gonna spend
an extra couple of days

199
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:12,934
down here with my family

200
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,367
before I head back.

201
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,000
They're so excited.

202
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,400
Of course they are.
They must be thrilled.

203
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,400
Send them my best.

204
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:22,567
I'm really happy for you,
Finn. Congratulations.

205
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,633
Thanks.

206
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,467
'Kay, well, there's good news
and bad news.

207
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:29,867
He got the job.

208
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
Is that the good news
or the bad news?

209
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:34,934
I don't know.

210
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,033
My family is so excited
about having me local again.

211
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sure they are.

212
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,613
My brother even took me
house-hunting.

213
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:47,967
Look, I know
this all happened really fast,

214
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,367
but you understand I had
to take this opportunity, right?

215
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,700
Yes, of course, I understand.

216
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:54,874
But you have to understand

217
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,867
you're not the only one
who loves their job.

218
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,433
Right?

219
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:02,934
Well... there are
auction houses in Los Angeles.

220
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,226
They're not the Metropolitan.

221
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,633
I love New York.

222
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,667
It's... It's who I am.

223
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,200
Yeah.

224
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,934
And I would never
want to change that.

225
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:26,333
Okay, so what are we saying?

226
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,867
Um...

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,266
maybe this is...

228
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,633
more than just geography,

229
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:38,433
maybe it's about
who we both are...

230
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,367
what we want.

231
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:45,066
And that maybe we want...

232
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,133
different things.

233
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,700
Yeah, I think so.

234
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,467
Yeah.

235
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,567
Look, I know
I have some things here, uh...

236
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:00,800
I was just getting
used to having them around.

237
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,033
The only thing
I'm gonna miss about New York

238
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,300
is you.

239
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,233
I'm gonna miss you, too.

240
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:21,633
Hey, come here.

241
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:25,066
Come on, come here.

242
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,567
Hi, Avery.

243
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:44,667
I did some research

244
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,834
and I found the perfect guy
to repair the veil.

245
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:49,166
He's a master tailor
and he's Italian.

246
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,834
He only sees people
by appointment,

247
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,207
but I did manage to get you one.

248
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,810
Well, you're not gonna need
that appointment,

249
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,166
because Finn and I broke up.

250
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,367
What?

251
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,200
You know, we should
get Emma on the phone.

252
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,500
Oh, wait, we can't.
She's teaching.

253
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,400
Tracy, what happened?

254
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,633
He got the job in L.A.

255
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,967
and I wasn't willing
to uproot my life.

256
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,166
I'm sorry.

257
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Yeah, it's okay.

258
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,166
And I'm surprised...

259
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,166
I mean, especially
since you have the veil.

260
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,333
Listen, Avery,

261
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,276
I don't want to burst
your bubble about that veil,

262
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,000
but I hung it up in my closet
and then my relationship ended.

263
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,800
Maybe Finn
just wasn't your soulmate.

264
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,333
I don't think
we have to go there.

265
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:23,976
Do you mind still getting
the veil fixed?

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,700
Yeah, you know. Just in case.

267
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,166
See? That's right.
Hang on to that. "Just in case."

268
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,600
Avery, I'm kidding.

269
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:30,734
Well, I'm not.

270
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,633
Your appointment
is Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.

271
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:33,834
I'll text you the address.

272
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,433
Got it.

273
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,367
Hi, Stanley.
Will you please let Leland know

274
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,600
that I'm running
a little bit behind?

275
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:47,843
Yeah, I have one stop to make

276
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:49,667
and then I'll be on my way in.

277
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,967
Ah, so you're a Giants fan, huh?

278
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Oh, yeah, forever.

279
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,467
You're not?

280
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,667
Not really.

281
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,200
You like the Jets?

282
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,600
I do.

283
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:01,767
Yeah.

284
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,710
I think Zach Wilson's got
a great future with them

285
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:04,800
as a quarterback... boom!

286
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:06,600
Maybe, but the Jets
aren't the Giants.

287
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:07,834
Never will be.

288
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,367
Yeah. Exactly.

289
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:11,533
Oh, come on, Luigi.

290
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,142
You're still gonna pin my pants,
though, right?

291
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,367
Oh, excuse me.

292
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,433
Hi. Sorry. I'm Tracy Goodwyn.

293
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,643
I'm the 9:00 appointment,
I'm so sorry that I'm late,

294
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,500
but the subway
broke down at Lex,

295
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,667
so I had to run all the way
across to 5th and 53rd,

296
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,900
and I grabbed it there...

297
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,543
I mean, I almost missed it,
but I didn't, so here I am.

298
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,266
Sorry. This gentleman
was a little early

299
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,800
for his appointment,

300
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:31,567
so I'm afraid
you'll have to wait.

301
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey. I'm the 9:30.

302
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,133
I'm only 17 minutes late
for my appointment,

303
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:37,266
and he's, like, what,
15, 16 minutes early,

304
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,876
so he's had three minutes
of my time already.

305
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,309
I'll tell you what...
We'll just split the difference,

306
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,343
because it's only gonna take me
two minutes to explain to you

307
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,066
what I need to have done.

308
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,400
You lost me.

309
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,609
Just like the Giants are gonna
lose to the Jets this year.

310
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,567
The Jets will never beat them!

311
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,000
The Giants
are just a better team.

312
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,033
Well, we can agree to disagree
on that one.

313
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,646
Tell us, signorina.
What do you think?

314
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:57,233
I'm with you.
Giants all the way.

315
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,460
Your pants will have to wait.

316
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,100
Ah, I see how it is.

317
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:02,800
Now, then...
what have you brought me?

318
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:07,767
Oh, uh, this is a wedding veil
that has a snag in it.

319
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,033
It's right, uh... there.

320
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,667
The workmanship is exquisite.

321
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,567
Gotta be Italian.

322
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,543
You're right, it's from Burano.
Late-19th century.

323
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,133
A piece this beautiful

324
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,810
must've been in your family
for a very long time.

325
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,300
Unfortunately, not my family.

326
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,233
It belonged
to the Contessa de Marco.

327
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:29,867
She wore it in a portrait
by Claudio Amici.

328
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's quite a pedigree.

329
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,900
Oh, sounds
a little made up to me.

330
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,633
Did you just say
that I made up that story?

331
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:37,800
Well, not necessarily.

332
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:40,000
You know, maybe somebody else
did along the way.

333
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,100
Actually, this veil has
a very storied history.

334
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,266
If you say so.

335
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,700
Excuse me.

336
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,333
It is a very beautiful veil.

337
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm glad you approve.

338
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
Nice tux.

339
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,033
Thank you.

340
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,900
So, when is the wedding?

341
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,033
Oh, there's not... not a wedding.

342
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,333
And yet you have a veil.

343
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:08,467
It's not my...

344
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,142
Well, I mean, I guess
a third of it is mine.

345
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,033
Sort of.

346
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,967
Oh, uh...
what, this third?

347
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,233
No, the third
that doesn't believe in it.

348
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:17,967
See, there's, like, a legend
about the veil,

349
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,133
that it...

350
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,633
never mind.

351
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,066
Ahem. When is your wedding?

352
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,500
Oh, I'm not getting married.

353
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,033
And yet you're in a tuxedo.

354
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,500
I am the best man.

355
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,133
If you say so.

356
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,033
I can have this ready for you
next Tuesday.

357
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,000
Great. Thank you so much.

358
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:36,333
I left my pins back there.
Be right with you.

359
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,467
Grazie.

360
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,533
Also?

361
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,533
Go, Dolphins.

362
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,567
Dolph... Luigi!
Dolphins? Come on.

363
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,333
I can't believe it!

364
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:47,033
Oliver's father
was a client and friend.

365
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,800
He's brought us
a very special document.

366
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:51,467
It's a piece
I inherited from him,

367
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,280
but, unlike my father,
I'm not a collector.

368
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,433
This is Emma Lazarus's
handwritten first draft...

369
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,633
of The New Colossus.

370
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:03,066
I mean, I knew
there was an earlier draft.

371
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,960
I never thought
it would come up for auction.

372
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,767
"Give me your tired,

373
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,333
your poor, your huddled masses,
yearning to breathe free..."

374
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,233
We see it
on the Statue of Liberty,

375
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,576
but to see it in her own hand...

376
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Her poem made
such a profound effect

377
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,767
on so many immigrant families.

378
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,166
My own included.

379
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,800
We'll send you a contract
this afternoon, Oliver.

380
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:23,800
Sounds good.

381
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:25,567
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you both.

382
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Leland.

383
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,509
A lot of collectors
will be interested in that,

384
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,934
especially Carter Wainwright.

385
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:32,600
He's been looking for a piece
of Americana just like that.

386
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:34,300
And my fear
is he'll stick it in a vault

387
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:35,509
and no one will ever see it.

388
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,013
That is exactly
what he's going to do.

389
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:38,734
But, you know what,

390
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:41,266
I could probably
reach out to some museums,

391
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
maybe get someone

392
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,967
to agree to pay
the appraisal price?

393
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,740
I'm not sure
Oliver would agree with that.

394
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,066
But I have your permission
to ask him, right?

395
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,567
- Well...
- I'll take that as a yes!

396
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,300
Ah.

397
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,066
Go ahead. Go ahead!

398
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,667
Oh! Mr. Wykoff!

399
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,700
Sorry, Mr. Wykoff,
just one second, please!

400
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,834
Yes. Is there a problem?

401
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,667
- I have a proposal for you.
- Okay.

402
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,433
So, what I was thinking was...

403
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,767
Here you go.

404
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,700
Thank you, honey.

405
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:09,633
How was the wedding?

406
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,166
Oh, it was amazing.

407
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,667
I don't think I've ever seen
Bobby look so happy.

408
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,033
- Oh!
- Did it give you any ideas?

409
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,233
What, about the new restaurant?

410
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:19,576
You know that's not what I mean.

411
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,643
Yeah, I know
that's not what you mean,

412
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,934
which is why I'm not answering.

413
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,367
Thank you so much for helping
with the dinner prep.

414
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,633
Well, it turns out
we really didn't need to.

415
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,266
Carly's got
everything under control.

416
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,300
Okay, it may seem like that now,

417
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,967
but once Nick opens
his new restaurant,

418
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,934
I may need to call on
you and Nonna a lot.

419
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,543
I think I'm gonna agree
with Mom on this one.

420
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,200
You're gonna do just fine.

421
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,867
But you might need us.

422
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,266
I'm still not convinced

423
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,233
your idea of mixing Italian
and Asian food together

424
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:46,367
is gonna work.

425
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,934
It's called fusion.
Nonna, "fusion."

426
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:52,266
All I know is, it's not
authentically Italian.

427
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay, it may not be traditional,

428
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,600
but it is awfully good.

429
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:58,633
You hear that?
You hear that?

430
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,066
Molto bene.

431
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,333
"Molto bene." Ohh...

432
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,100
Mom. Lunch is here.

433
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:13,433
So, how are you doing?

434
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,200
Oh, you know.

435
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,367
I miss Finn.

436
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,533
Yeah.

437
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:23,367
But, um, well, I am happy
that I'm still a New Yorker

438
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,900
and don't have to get
on an airplane

439
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,533
to share lunch with my mother.

440
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,834
Aww.

441
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,934
And Zabar's pastrami
would be hard to replace.

442
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,200
A hundred percent.

443
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,367
You know, honey,

444
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,400
when your dad and I
got divorced,

445
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,000
it took me a while
to get my bearings.

446
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,200
Mom, you were married
for 15 years.

447
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,066
Yeah.

448
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,567
Finn and I were together
for two,

449
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,400
and if you count
all his touring,

450
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,333
we were only together
for a year and a half.

451
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,166
And that's
my longest relationship.

452
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,200
Well, all relationships
have their complications,

453
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,333
but you can't let our divorce
influence your relationship.

454
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:58,507
That's not what I'm doing.

455
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,734
Is this all new?

456
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:06,700
They're by a new artist
I'm featuring from Taos.

457
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,100
I really like it.

458
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,800
Yeah.

459
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:13,000
Now, getting back to you.

460
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,800
Have you thought about
what's next?

461
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,800
I have the party coming up
that I'm planning.

462
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,633
I have to get
the auction together,

463
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:21,100
and I have to find a museum
that's willing to buy

464
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,100
the Lazarus poem.

465
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,333
I'm busy!

466
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,900
Well, just make sure you leave
some time for yourself.

467
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:30,633
I have decided to buy
one of those mini trampolines.

468
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,867
Okay...

469
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,533
Stanley says
they're great for destressing,

470
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:36,843
and they're highly recommended

471
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:40,100
for high-stress, high-achieving,
busy New Yorkers.

472
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,233
Sounds like
it's right up your alley.

473
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,934
I get the pickle.

474
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,900
You take it.

475
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,667
I think the Lazarus poem

476
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,166
would be perfect
for your special collections.

477
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,266
I know that museums have been
struggling for funding,

478
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,500
and to have an important,

479
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,667
and special, timely piece
like this

480
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,200
could really...

481
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,467
No, of course.

482
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,700
I understand.

483
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:04,734
Well, I appreciate your time.

484
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:08,700
Oh, no. This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

485
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:09,843
I have good news, bad news.

486
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,033
Hit me.

487
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,109
The bad news is the caterers
that we wanted for the party

488
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,333
just bowed out.

489
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:15,587
So, for those keeping score,

490
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,967
we can no longer count on
caterers or trumpet players.

491
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,500
Correct, but the good news is,

492
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,767
I have a solution.

493
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,400
Twirl?

494
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,300
- Let's get your coat.
- Okay.

495
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:31,300
Oh! My phone.

496
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,667
Phone. Grab your phone. Coat.
Adventure!

497
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,433
Everything is so delicious!

498
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,567
Really, though.

499
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,910
The only problem is,
how do we narrow it down?

500
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:44,009
I don't know, because this
was as good as the carbonara,

501
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:45,667
which was as good
as the risotto.

502
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,520
- Exactly. I don't know.
- How do we choose?

503
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,776
We have to save
some room for dessert,

504
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,476
because I hear the cannolis
are incredible.

505
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,834
We have to get these people
to cater the party.

506
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,142
See, I knew
you were gonna say that,

507
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,009
so I asked the waiter
if we could talk to the owner.

508
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,667
What if I hadn't liked the food?

509
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,500
I hadn't gotten there...

510
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,400
But the food is fantastic.

511
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:05,233
- Tuxedo.
- Wedding veil.

512
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,734
- Is this some sort of code?
- You're the owner?

513
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:10,066
I am.
The owner and the chef.

514
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,233
Nick Serchio.

515
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:12,066
Tracy Goodwyn.

516
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,233
And I'm Stanley.

517
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:14,727
But I'm guessing,
by this greeting,

518
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,300
you two have already met.

519
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Yes, we have.

520
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,300
Yeah, very briefly.

521
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:20,433
Mm-hmm.

522
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,967
So I understand
you wanted to see me?

523
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,543
Oh, yeah, but that was before
I knew you were you.

524
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:26,233
Now that we've got
that out of the way...

525
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,967
uh, what'd you want
to see me about?

526
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,133
About the food.

527
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,900
I-I... we wanted
to compliment you

528
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,343
on how delicious
all of this food is.

529
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:34,934
- It's very good.
- Thank you.

530
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:38,233
Yes, and-and we wanted to see
if you could cater a party

531
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,687
at our auction house
on the 17th...

532
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,767
Catering... the 17th?
Uh...

533
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,800
Well, I would have to check
with my sister.

534
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,233
Um, I work with her,

535
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,300
so I'll go do that.

536
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,033
Okay,
yeah, yeah, check with her.

537
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,467
In the meantime, we should
probably order some dessert.

538
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,800
'Kay. I'll send somebody over.

539
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:55,176
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

540
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,743
Yeah, fantastic. I hear
the cannolis are really the...

541
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:57,900
What's going on with you?

542
00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:00,000
Nothing. Nothing at all.

543
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,773
I just realized
that this place is so busy

544
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,066
they probably won't
be able to fit us in.

545
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,066
Well, let's hope they will.

546
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,433
I'm definitely
not doing that job.

547
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:08,367
What is wrong with you?

548
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,233
What are you talking about?
Nothing.

549
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,400
Just...

550
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,573
Just it feels like she'd be
a very difficult client.

551
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,700
You've had
difficult clients before.

552
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,400
Just think of the exposure
a party like this would give us,

553
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,433
especially since we are about
to open a new restaurant!

554
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,300
You're just like Mom.

555
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:25,934
And what's with

556
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,343
the wedding veil
and the tuxedo thing?

557
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,533
- It's a long story.
- How long?

558
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,433
- Not that kind of time.
- All right.

559
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,900
So... Looks like I will be
available to cater.

560
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,333
Oh. Great.

561
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,000
Good. Yeah. Fantastic.

562
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:46,400
Why am I the only one
who's excited about this?

563
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,209
I'll get the door for you,
all right?

564
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,833
- All right. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

565
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,734
We've gotten so many RSVPs
for the party

566
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,267
and I just sent out
the invitations.

567
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,533
Our little party's turning out
to be quite the social event.

568
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,367
Yeah. I have to talk
to the florist,

569
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,200
I have to confirm
with the valet.

570
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,300
Oh, I have to get ex...
some extra displays...

571
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,476
You know what? I have to get
those earrings to the catalog

572
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,667
before the catalog
goes to the printer.

573
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,120
The sapphire earrings
that I like?

574
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,309
- Yeah.
- What's the provenance on those?

575
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,776
Because I feel like
I've seen them before.

576
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,710
No provenance. Estate jewelry.
Actually, you know what?

577
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:23,810
I'm gonna go
to the printers now.

578
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:24,667
I'll see you later.

579
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,910
What? No, no, no!
You can't go anywhere!

580
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:26,943
We have an appointment
with the caterer

581
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:27,834
to go over the menu.

582
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,600
Oh, right!
Well, can't you go without me?

583
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:31,209
You can have
some alone time with Tuxedo.

584
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,233
I don't want alone time!

585
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,576
I think he's gonna
be hard to work with,

586
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,810
and I don't need
that kinda stress!

587
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:36,834
The trampoline would help.
Did it come yet?

588
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,667
- Yes.
- And?

589
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,667
I haven't taken it
out of the box.

590
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
So, the way it works is,

591
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,376
you actually have to take it
out of the box,

592
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,166
and then you hit it.

593
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,567
Okay, so say "hi" to Tuxedo
for me!

594
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:53,367
Oh...

595
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,633
Swivel or no swivel?

596
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:56,934
How much does it cost?

597
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,209
Well, this new catering gig
will pay for the swivel stools.

598
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,473
That's one way of looking at it.

599
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:01,400
Oh, come on, Nick.

600
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:02,876
This party
is exactly what we need.

601
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,543
The auction house
is on the Upper West Side,

602
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:07,333
and that is exactly the type
of clientele we want to attract.

603
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:09,467
You're right.

604
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,700
I guess I'll just focus
on what's important...

605
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:13,142
The food
and getting the restaurant open.

606
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,333
And choosing
the right bar stools.

607
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:18,693
- You're having way too much fun.
- Yep.

608
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,233
Fine. The swivel.

609
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:21,166
Yes!

610
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,166
Just 'cause
you're making me dizzy.

611
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Right? Cool.

612
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,333
Usually, we don't
make a big deal

613
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:26,500
out of auction previews,

614
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:28,900
but we're combining it
with our 25th anniversary.

615
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:31,834
25? Wow. B-But you haven't
been there that long.

616
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,400
No. I've been there ten years.

617
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:34,733
I started off as an assistant,

618
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,400
and now I am the Director
of Books and Documents.

619
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:40,166
Ooh. "Director
of Books and Documents."

620
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,367
That is a fancy title.

621
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
It is not "fancy".

622
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:44,300
And I didn't make it up.

623
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:45,900
Ah. Touche.

624
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,934
Uh, I owe you an apology.

625
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,000
I was a little bit out of line
the other day.

626
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,433
Thank you.

627
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:52,667
Me too.

628
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Nah!

629
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:55,900
Oh, um...

630
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:57,266
Excuse me. Sorry.

631
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Okay.

632
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,467
So the Morgan Library
turned me down.

633
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,976
How do you get turned down
by a library?

634
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,600
Too many overdue books?

635
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:05,967
No.

636
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,066
I'm trying to have
a historical document

637
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,433
placed in a museum.

638
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:12,009
Which one?
I'm a pretty big history buff.

639
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:14,533
It's an early draft of a poem
by Emma Lazarus.

640
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,600
The one that's on
the Statue of Liberty?

641
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:18,767
"Give me your tired, your poor,

642
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,042
your huddled masses... " That one?

643
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,266
Wow. Okay,
I underestimated you.

644
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,767
Good for you.

645
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,934
No, I know it,

646
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,986
because my grandmother
immigrated here from Italy

647
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,066
when she was a child,

648
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,543
and the Statue of Liberty
is one of the very first

649
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,166
things she saw
when she came to America.

650
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,734
It's one of the most important
days of her entire life.

651
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:35,509
It's stories like that
that make me realize

652
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,266
just how important
this is that I'm trying to do.

653
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,266
You want stories?

654
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,300
My nonna's got some stories.

655
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:44,076
Let's focus
on the menu here, huh?

656
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
Okay.

657
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,743
I've thrown a couple new things
at you here.

658
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,233
I'm opening a restaurant
called Tesoro Mio,

659
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:52,333
and it's
an Asian-Italian fusion...

660
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:54,800
That's really interesting,
and different...

661
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,100
Something I strive for.

662
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,967
Yeah, me too.

663
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,934
So, check this out...

664
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,667
- Oh!
- Fantastic.

665
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Yeah, look at that.

666
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,166
So? What do you think?

667
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:14,500
It's a very nice sign.

668
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,667
I thought so, too.
It's a good start, right?

669
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,242
Let's go inside. I want
to show you the rest of it.

670
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,734
Okay, now, you gotta use
your imagination.

671
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,567
Wait until you see the kitchen.

672
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,142
It does everything
but make the sauce.

673
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,533
When we started Da Nonna,

674
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,000
my mother and I
had to make sauce

675
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,667
in a tiny, little apartment.

676
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,100
Ma.

677
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,367
I think the place is very nice

678
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,060
and I think
Nick is onto something here.

679
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:37,033
You know, he got a lot
of very important investors

680
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:39,600
based on his menu
and his cooking.

681
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:40,734
Eh?

682
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:41,867
What do you think?

683
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
We were just saying

684
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,713
how impressed we are
with the place, honey.

685
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,233
Oh, thanks, Ma.

686
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:48,066
And proud.
Of both of you.

687
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,200
But are you sure you will be
finished with everything

688
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,400
by the opening?

689
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,200
Yeah, we've got, like,
a month, right?

690
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,533
Uh, which reminds me...

691
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,776
I need some artwork
for the walls.

692
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,200
We got plenty of family photos
you could have!

693
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,533
Well, that's, um,
very sweet, Nonna,

694
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,700
but we're going for

695
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,734
a little bit different vibe here
than Da Nonna,

696
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:07,100
but I'll keep it in mind, huh?
Grazie.

697
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:08,834
Espresso?

698
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,133
Leland?
I have some good news.

699
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:14,467
I called every museum
I could think of, as you know,

700
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,767
with no luck.

701
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,200
But I just had a meeting with
the New York History Museum,

702
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,800
and they want to make
the Lazarus poem

703
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:22,214
part of their permanent exhibit.

704
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,800
Well, that is
wonderful news, Tracy.

705
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:25,066
Congratulations.

706
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,367
There is a catch.

707
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,260
They can only afford
half the purchase price.

708
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,033
Which means
you have to find someone

709
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,276
who can cover the other half,

710
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,600
and is also willing
to donate it.

711
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,900
Guess it's only
half the money, right?

712
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:39,700
Unfortunately, it doesn't
make it half as easy.

713
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:41,934
Indeed. Well...

714
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:44,266
back to work.

715
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,533
You can do it.

716
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,734
Yeah. Of course.
No, I understand.

717
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:49,467
But thank you for your time.

718
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,567
What's wrong?

719
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,767
I'm just about through
my donor list

720
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,300
and I haven't found anyone.

721
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,567
I'm getting nowhere fast

722
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,133
and I am running out of time.

723
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:02,376
You want to come out with me,

724
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,509
have a drink,
cry on my shoulder?

725
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't have time to cry
because I'm not giving up.

726
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,300
Maybe I'll just
jump on my trampoline.

727
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,776
You finally took it
out of the box?

728
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,467
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

729
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,533
Okay, well, I'll be out.
Happy jumping!

730
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:18,734
I'll be at the restaurant.

731
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:26,533
Hello.

732
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,500
It's, uh, Nick Serchio,
from Da Nonna's.

733
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:31,033
Yeah. Hi. I...

734
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,533
I know who you are.

735
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,767
Is everything okay?

736
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,443
You sound like you're
a little bit out of breath.

737
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:39,467
No. I mean,
I was just a little up and down.

738
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,333
I was jumping on a trampoline.

739
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,800
That's all.

740
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,133
Well, I didn't know
the circus was in town.

741
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:47,800
I didn't know chefs were funny.

742
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:49,300
Well, we have our moments. Thanks.

743
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,834
A little kitchen humor?

744
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:52,700
What, you don't have
auction house humor?

745
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:56,000
No. No, no.
All that art and antiquity?

746
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:58,100
It's very serious.
Sacred, in fact.

747
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,533
Well, sorry. I didn't know.

748
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:00,967
Stanley is the funny one.

749
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
The sidekick, right?

750
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:03,500
The guy that I met
at the restaurant with you?

751
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm Abbott to his Costello.

752
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:07,033
Hey. Who's on first?

753
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,867
What's on second.

754
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,476
I didn't know
you'd know that routine.

755
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,033
I'm surprised you do.

756
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,543
People aren't always
who you think they are.

757
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,100
Well, I think
you're still the chef

758
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,676
that's going to be
catering our party.

759
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,834
I am.

760
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:20,509
That's actually why I called...
I've narrowed it down

761
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:21,543
to a few recipes
I want you to try.

762
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,834
- When?
- How is Thursday morning?

763
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,667
Yeah, that... Yeah,
that should be fine for me.

764
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,033
All right.

765
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,343
You're sure you're not bouncing
on the trampoline that morning?

766
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:30,767
Well, if I am,

767
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,567
it's, uh, you know,
just to build up an appetite.

768
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,843
All right. I'll see you then.

769
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,300
Great.

770
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,066
And here we have

771
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,266
a little shitake mushroom
and umami ravioli.

772
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,000
Wow.

773
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,400
Smells good.

774
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:50,400
Ah, it's one of my favorites.

775
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:52,066
You know, I noticed
all the memorabilia

776
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
you have back there.

777
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,309
Wow, you weren't kidding
when you said

778
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,734
you were
a major New York history buff.

779
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:57,734
Oh, yeah.

780
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:59,333
It all started
when my nonna gave me

781
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,266
this little replica
of the Statue of Liberty.

782
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,066
Mm?

783
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,133
- Well?
- Wow.

784
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,333
Wow!

785
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:08,776
If all your food
tastes like this,

786
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,667
I'm never getting a reservation
at Tesoro Mio.

787
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,880
Oh, you know, I may know
somebody that knows somebody

788
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:14,000
that can get you in.

789
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,133
Oh, this is my sister, Carly.
Carly, Tracy.

790
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,133
- Hi!
- Hi.

791
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:19,600
Hi. Nice to meet you.

792
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:22,000
Same here. We are very excited
to be catering your event.

793
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,767
Oh, well, if the food
is this good,

794
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,266
the crowd is gonna be
really happy.

795
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,109
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying
Nick's new menu,

796
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,609
but I should get these
into the kitchen.

797
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:29,673
It was lovely to meet you.

798
00:28:29,734 --> 00:28:32,567
See ya. Carly's the eldest
of my three sisters.

799
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,376
Where are the other two?
Locked in the kitchen?

800
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,166
Yes. And we threw away the key.

801
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,600
No, uh, they're in Italy, actually.

802
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,100
Giuliana is doing some research
for a new cookbook,

803
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:43,600
and my sister, Monica,
is on a farm,

804
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:45,367
learning how to make
her own olive oil.

805
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,900
Wow. You have
quite a family.

806
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:49,100
Yeah, I got pretty lucky
in that department.

807
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:50,633
How about you?

808
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,433
Oh, I'm an only child,

809
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,166
and my parents are divorced,

810
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,734
and, uh, I just had a break-up
myself, recently.

811
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,166
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

812
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,166
- Mm.
- Uh, divorce?

813
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,567
No, no, we never made it
down the aisle.

814
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,734
But you still have
the wedding veil.

815
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,834
Only by default.

816
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:06,967
Yeah, but wasn't there

817
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,967
some sort of legend
attached to it?

818
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,967
It's silly.
The legend is,

819
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,700
whoever has possession
of the veil

820
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,066
is going to fall in love.

821
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,533
That's not silly at all.
That's totally legit.

822
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,133
Totally!
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

823
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:18,266
Totally legit.

824
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,233
Um...

825
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:21,333
why don't we have some dessert?

826
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:22,700
What's this one called again?

827
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:23,867
"Sfogliatella."

828
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,867
How do you say it?

829
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,734
Sif-foge-lia...

830
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:26,734
Sof-fog-lee-at-ella.

831
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:27,867
"Sfogliatella."

832
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,633
I can't put it all together.

833
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,567
I know I like it,
but I just can't say it.

834
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,567
That's all that matters.

835
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,710
I'd like to have this
on the menu, too.

836
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,142
- All right, done.
- And the cannolis.

837
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:35,967
Cannolis are on every menu.
Come on.

838
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,066
Perfect! I love it.

839
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,433
That doesn't look so hard.

840
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:40,676
You want to try filling
one of these?

841
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Seems easy, right?

842
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:42,943
Grab that chocolate
right there...

843
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,807
Grab it by the top,
otherwise it all comes out.

844
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,367
Oh, yeah, you don't want that.

845
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,643
- All right, and just a...
- Oh!

846
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:49,066
Sorry!

847
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,467
I didn't mean to sp...

848
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,066
Not so... Not so much filling.

849
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,176
- Here, let's get that off.
- Wait, can I taste it first?

850
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,066
Yes.

851
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
- Mm!
- That's good, right?

852
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:57,800
That's really good!

853
00:29:57,934 --> 00:29:59,500
Mm. So delicious.

854
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:00,967
That's a lot of chocolate.

855
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,467
Okay, so, we've got
the cannolis,

856
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,066
we've got the "s fogliatella."

857
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Um, other than that...

858
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,700
everything else good
with the menu?

859
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:10,333
I really think
the menu's perfect.

860
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:13,333
I'm really happy to check that
off my to-do list.

861
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:19,900
Um... I... have to get going.

862
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,900
You going to work?

863
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:24,033
No, no. I took the morning
off from work,

864
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,286
because I'm buying a new rug

865
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,000
and maybe even
a new coffee table

866
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:28,333
and some new art.

867
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:30,133
Ooh. Redecorating?

868
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:32,009
Didn't start out that way,
but then the break-up...

869
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,266
I guess I just wanted
something new.

870
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,033
Is that this building
that we're in right now?

871
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,133
This, right here,
is the very first day

872
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:40,100
that Da Nonna's was opened.

873
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:41,233
Wow.

874
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:42,586
That's
my great-great grandmother,

875
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:43,876
great-grandfather,
in the hat right there...

876
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,100
Look at that hat!

877
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:47,533
And that's my grandmother, Gia.

878
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:50,633
The one who gave you
the miniature Statue of Liberty?

879
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,600
- That's the one.
- That's really cool.

880
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,400
Uh, are you still looking
for a buyer for the poem?

881
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:58,834
I haven't found anyone yet.

882
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,800
It dawned on me earlier

883
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:02,454
that one of the investors
in Tesoro Mio

884
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,900
is also a very big collector.

885
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,767
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

886
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,242
Do you think
he might be interested?

887
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,567
Yeah, I mean, we can call him
and find out.

888
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,980
Here, let me help you with that.

889
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,133
Oh, thank you.

890
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:14,100
You would be willing
to call him for me?

891
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:15,266
Of course!

892
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,467
To save a very important piece
of New York history?

893
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
I can't promise anything.

894
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:21,100
No! I mean, of course not.

895
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:22,467
I'm not expecting anything,

896
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
but thank you.

897
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,343
Also, if you need help
lugging stuff around,

898
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:26,400
I've got an SUV.

899
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:27,867
I could help you.

900
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:36,800
Ohh...

901
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:37,934
Okay.

902
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,433
Oh. What floor are we on?

903
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,400
Uh, the top floor.

904
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,233
I mean...

905
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,633
There's an elevator!

906
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,433
I wouldn't do that to you!

907
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:49,300
You taught me to make cannolis
this morning.

908
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:51,300
I thought
I was in for a workout.

909
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:53,527
Where do you want this thing?

910
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:54,900
Yeah.
Right here in the middle.

911
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:56,367
All right.

912
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,133
Oh. Nice place.

913
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,133
Thanks. I like it.

914
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,700
All right. One, two, three...

915
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,834
Perfect. Hey, can I get you
something to drink?

916
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,900
Yeah, water would be great.

917
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:09,033
Perfect.

918
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:15,000
Um... so are you
collecting rugs?

919
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,600
No, why?

920
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,967
'Cause you got, like,
50 of them over here.

921
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,500
That.

922
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:22,333
Well...

923
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,567
sometimes, you think
something's gonna work

924
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,867
and then it doesn't.

925
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,100
Mm. You have to just move on.

926
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,473
Are we still talking about rugs?

927
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,000
No.

928
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:34,200
Now we're talking about my ex.

929
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,133
Finn was going to move in
with me,

930
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:40,033
and, um, so we started shopping
for stuff for my place,

931
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,533
you know, for both of us,

932
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,467
and he picked out this rug...

933
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,567
and I gave in.

934
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,409
Well, at least we know
you're willing to compromise.

935
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,834
Right.

936
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,533
Just not all the way to L.A.

937
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:53,467
That's where he moved.

938
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,266
Well, I don't
know you very well,

939
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,480
but I can't really see you
breaking up with New York.

940
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:07,266
Hey, this is great.
I love this artwork right here.

941
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,680
That's from
my mom's art gallery.

942
00:33:08,734 --> 00:33:09,854
Your mom has an art gallery?

943
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,166
Mm-hmm.

944
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,934
I just so happen to be looking
for some artwork for Tesoro Mio.

945
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:17,033
Unless she's charging
Warhol prices, and then...

946
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,934
I know someone who knows someone

947
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,567
who might be able
to get you a deal.

948
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,133
Sounds interesting.
And cryptic.

949
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,667
So what's the verdict?

950
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,734
Just doesn't work, does it?

951
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,033
Bah!

952
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,300
Two thumbs down!

953
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:32,166
How's it getting
back downstairs, though?

954
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,033
Oh, good afternoon.

955
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:35,209
Wait, didn't you get my text

956
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:37,233
saying I wasn't coming in
until later?

957
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:38,367
I did.

958
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,433
What, were you just
up late working?

959
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:43,200
Yeah. I was, um, you know,
just going over

960
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,443
all the paperwork for the party,

961
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:46,834
making sure that the vendors
had their contracts

962
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:47,800
and everything.

963
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:48,943
Mm. Everything's set.
What...

964
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:51,433
Is that the catalog?

965
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:52,867
It is.
How does it look?

966
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,667
Terrific.
I noticed at that back

967
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,100
that you put a thank-you
to Tesoro Mio there.

968
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:58,633
Of course I did.

969
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:00,633
You know,
they're catering the party

970
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:02,633
and they need the publicity.

971
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:03,500
Wow.
That's awfully nice of you.

972
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:05,100
I'm a nice person.

973
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:07,500
Most of the time.

974
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:09,133
I'm just making an observation.

975
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:11,500
Sounds more like
an exaggeration, to me.

976
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,193
Look, don't get me wrong.
I like Tuxedo.

977
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:14,346
He's charming, he can cook,

978
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,100
he can keep up with you.

979
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:17,910
What does that even mean?
You keep up with me.

980
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:18,800
All I'm saying is

981
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,600
that Finn, you know,
he was nice...

982
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:22,300
really talented,

983
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:24,066
but he was always
a few steps behind you.

984
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,533
You need somebody who's more
of a speed-walker...

985
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:27,834
like Tuxedo.

986
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,800
First of all, Tuxedo is just...

987
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:30,800
Nick...

988
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:32,100
- "Nick."
- "Nick."

989
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:33,967
- Nick.
- Nick...

990
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,576
is just
a business acquaintance, okay?

991
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
He's sor...

992
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:40,533
It's him.

993
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:42,787
Well, he's probably just
calling about business stuff.

994
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,333
Hello?

995
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,667
I've got good news.

996
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,934
So my investor said
he's willing to meet with you.

997
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,400
Really? Wow.

998
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:52,710
Yeah, he's got a house
out on Long Island,

999
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:53,600
out by the beach.

1000
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:54,976
He wanted us
to come by on Sunday.

1001
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
Sunday's perfect.

1002
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:57,900
Why don't I pick you up around...

1003
00:34:58,033 --> 00:34:59,433
tch, I don't know, nine?

1004
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,233
Nine. Okay. Great.

1005
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:02,967
Ah, thank you so much.

1006
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
These look great.

1007
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,066
Tuxedo found a potential buyer
for the poem.

1008
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,066
Just a business acquaintance,
huh?

1009
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,533
He's just a stand-up guy.

1010
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,734
Nick. Nick is just
a stand-up guy...

1011
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:14,767
Would you stop
getting ideas? Please.

1012
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,300
No, no. No. I mean,
I can't help it, it's in my DNA.

1013
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,700
I'll try to have no ideas.

1014
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:21,533
Oh, look... me
not having any ideas

1015
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,266
about you and Tuxedo...

1016
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,100
walking down a beach.

1017
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:26,433
I need my own office.

1018
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:28,567
Seriously,
I-I can't live like this.

1019
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
"Nick."

1020
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,867
Whoa... oh! Okay.

1021
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:38,834
Oh!

1022
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:40,066
- Hello.
- Hey!

1023
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,967
Just checking in on you.

1024
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,367
Well, don't worry.

1025
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,166
It's been three weeks
and I am still standing.

1026
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,166
What are you doing?

1027
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,266
Why do I see paint cans
behind you?

1028
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,576
I'm making some changes,
you know?

1029
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,066
Out with the old,
in with the new?

1030
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,000
Maybe something blue?

1031
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,609
Wait, you didn't get rid of
that cute little table

1032
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:58,667
you bought on our Vermont
weekend, did you?

1033
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,367
Wasn't it
right next to your couch?

1034
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,109
Yes! You have a good memory.
It was right there.

1035
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:04,367
But now I've put it
in the bedroom.

1036
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,266
Looks like you're making
some changes, too.

1037
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,133
Yes. I, uh...

1038
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:10,967
I'm just getting
started on the packing.

1039
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,533
Paolo and I are moving
to our new place soon.

1040
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,633
Oh. Well, I can't wait
to see it.

1041
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:16,900
Is that what time it is?

1042
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:19,900
I have to go, I'm so sorry,
but Nick is picking me up.

1043
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:20,900
We're gonna go meet Bruce.

1044
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:22,033
Who's Nick?

1045
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,367
I don't have time to explain!

1046
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,734
Okay. Coat... scarf.

1047
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,400
I just got off
the phone with Tracy...

1048
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:31,533
How is she doing?

1049
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,734
She's redecorating.

1050
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:36,367
Oh, no. Do you remember
her last break-up?

1051
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,467
I know. I even saw paint cans
in her living room.

1052
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,967
I just hope we can get there

1053
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,009
before she paints her walls
a color she's gonna regret.

1054
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,700
What's your schedule like
this week?

1055
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,233
- Good morning.
- Hey, good morning.

1056
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:57,734
So, slight change of plans.

1057
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,147
- Oh...
- No, no, no. Don't worry.

1058
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,443
We're still gonna go meet Bruce,

1059
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:02,066
we're just not
going to his house.

1060
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,100
Oh, okay.
Well, that sounds fine, right?

1061
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:06,000
- Yeah.
- Okay. Thank you.

1062
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,200
Oh, what's this?

1063
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,266
Ah, it's a little surprise
for the road.

1064
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,433
- Okay.
- Some cannolis...

1065
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,233
Cannolis for breakfast?

1066
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,266
I love it.

1067
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:21,600
So just keep in mind,

1068
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:24,100
you'd only be paying
half the asking price.

1069
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:26,467
The museum
will match the other half.

1070
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
They're looking forward

1071
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,233
to displaying the poem
full-time.

1072
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:30,367
Bruce.

1073
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:33,133
These words meant so much
to so many immigrants,

1074
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:34,834
including my grandmother.

1075
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:37,400
Well, I really admire
what you're trying to do,

1076
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:39,600
but I collect to invest...

1077
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:41,967
and I resell
when the market's right.

1078
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,433
Oh, come on, Bruce.

1079
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:47,333
What about considering this
a charitable donation?

1080
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:49,347
I've already exceeded
my donations for the year.

1081
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:52,109
Look, I'm very sorry,
but I'm a businessman.

1082
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm not a philanthropist.

1083
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:54,600
Of course.

1084
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:55,976
I'm sure
you'll find the right person.

1085
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,300
You have someone in mind?

1086
00:37:57,433 --> 00:38:00,333
I don't, but you two
should definitely keep at it.

1087
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:02,000
You're pretty good together.

1088
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:07,200
I am interested

1089
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,300
in this George Washington
letter, though,

1090
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:11,667
so maybe your trip out here
wasn't for nothing.

1091
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,033
Hey, I mean, we knew
it was a long shot, right?

1092
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:17,100
Yeah, long shots are always
worth a try, though.

1093
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:18,400
- I should know.
- Meaning?

1094
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:19,400
Well, my grandmother thinks

1095
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,166
my new restaurant
is a total long shot.

1096
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,700
- What?
- Yeah.

1097
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,700
Why?

1098
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:24,900
Ah, she's old-school.

1099
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:27,200
She doesn't understand
the idea of anybody wanting

1100
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,667
to blend Italian cooking
with any other kind of cuisine.

1101
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,400
Well, come on,
"old-school" doesn't mean

1102
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:33,166
that she might not come around.

1103
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,367
Yeah, right.

1104
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,700
There's old-school,
then there's Italian old-school.

1105
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:39,600
- Got it.
- Yeah.

1106
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,133
Well, what made you decide
to go with fusion anyway?

1107
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,667
Uh, ex-fiancée.

1108
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,166
- "Ex"?
- Ex.

1109
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,367
I've been there.

1110
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,967
Yeah, we were together
four years.

1111
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,166
She's a chef also,
Asian cuisine.

1112
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,467
And we decided to blend
our lives together,

1113
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,333
uh, we also wanted to blend
our food passions together,

1114
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,700
and boom... "Tesoro Mio."

1115
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,066
Well, it does sound delicious.

1116
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,934
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1117
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:05,767
But, uh, I'm moving on
with her blessing.

1118
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,233
So things ended well?

1119
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:09,467
Yeah. Yeah, especially for her.

1120
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,700
She's now married
to a Brazilian chef,

1121
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:13,800
and they have
two restaurants in Rio.

1122
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,300
- Oh. Great.
- Mm-hmm.

1123
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:16,967
And what about you?

1124
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,934
Ah, taking a little...
a little break.

1125
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,666
You know,
focusing on the new restaurant.

1126
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,266
Mm-hmm.

1127
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,009
You know, my best friend, Avery,
always says

1128
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:26,934
that everything happens
for a reason.

1129
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:28,100
- Mm.
- I don't know.

1130
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,867
Maybe I'm starting
to believe her.

1131
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:32,300
Speaking of...

1132
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:34,042
Sorry things didn't work out
so well with Bruce.

1133
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:36,200
You know what?
We gave it our best shot, right?

1134
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,834
- That, we did.
- Yeah.

1135
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,266
So, Trace,

1136
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,680
what's the attire
for this party?

1137
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,700
[÷Tracy] The usual... upscale
New York cocktail party.

1138
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:45,934
Ah.

1139
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:49,433
So, in other words,
a little black dress?

1140
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,567
Or...

1141
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,400
Whoa.

1142
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:55,900
That is your dress.

1143
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:57,133
I don't know.

1144
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:58,467
You think?

1145
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I-I don't know.

1146
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:01,934
What about this one?
This one's sort of more...

1147
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,266
I don't know.

1148
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,900
This one's a little more...

1149
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:09,867
Trace, I've never seen you

1150
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,834
so in doubt
about a dress before,

1151
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:14,200
especially one that looks
like it was made for you.

1152
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,533
What's going on?

1153
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:16,667
Nothing!

1154
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,900
It's 'cause I'm not sure
which one is right.

1155
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,834
For what?

1156
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,066
Or should I say, for who?

1157
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,934
Have you met someone?

1158
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,066
Sort of.

1159
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,743
But I don't know!
I mean, maybe it's something.

1160
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:28,934
Or maybe it's nothing!

1161
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:31,266
Or maybe I'm just not ready
to be in a relationship yet.

1162
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,400
You know?

1163
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:34,242
Well, it's given you pause
about buying a new dress,

1164
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,667
so maybe it is something.

1165
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,233
Either way,
you have to buy that dress.

1166
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:42,333
Thanks, Mom.

1167
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:45,900
You want to grab
an early dinner after this?

1168
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:47,066
Oh, Mom, I would love to,

1169
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,433
but Avery and Emma
are coming into town tonight.

1170
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:50,734
Ah, what's the occasion?

1171
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:51,734
No occasion,

1172
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,900
they're just being good friends.

1173
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:54,867
Mm.

1174
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,376
You know you guys
didn't have to come.

1175
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,266
Yes, we did,

1176
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,934
given the state
of your apartment.

1177
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:02,934
I know how it seems,
but I'm fine, really.

1178
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:04,667
We were just
a little worried about you.

1179
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,667
Especially when
I saw all those paint cans...

1180
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,300
It just reminded me of the time

1181
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,200
you painted
your apartment purple, and...

1182
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,333
Okay, okay. It was lilac!

1183
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:14,133
- It was bad.
- It was

1184
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:16,042
These paint cans have
a very pretty light green

1185
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:16,834
- in them.
- Oh!

1186
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:18,042
I think it's gonna be great,

1187
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:19,066
and since you're here,

1188
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,934
maybe you two could
help me paint.

1189
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:23,109
If that's what you want to do,
of course, we'll do that.

1190
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:24,867
- You are the sweetest.
- Avery!

1191
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,200
But I love you.

1192
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,367
You're the nicest person
I know, seriously.

1193
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Okay, where are
we going to dinner?

1194
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:32,700
Oh, I discovered
this new Italian place,

1195
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:34,576
and I thought we could,
you know, just check it out.

1196
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Okay.

1197
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:38,433
Well, look who it is!

1198
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:39,767
Oh, you're becoming a regular.

1199
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,967
These are my friends,
Emma and Avery.

1200
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

1201
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:44,476
The other two-thirds
of the veil?

1202
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,367
Nice to meet you.

1203
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,967
Oh! You know about the veil?

1204
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,200
Well, he was at Luigi's

1205
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,000
when I had to take it in
to get repaired.

1206
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,200
Oh. You didn't tell us that.

1207
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:56,433
This is Nick
and he is a very talented chef.

1208
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:57,567
Meh...

1209
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,276
Is this the same Nick
who took you Long Island?

1210
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,400
Well, unfortunately,

1211
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:03,033
that turned out to be a bust,
but yes.

1212
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:06,033
But I did
get to see the Oheka Castle...

1213
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:10,000
One of the architects
who also designed Central Park.

1214
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:11,773
I can't believe
you never know about that.

1215
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:13,433
Tracy knows New York
better than I do.

1216
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,400
But that is my favorite part
about the city,

1217
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,209
that there's always something
new to discover.

1218
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:18,400
Always.

1219
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:25,533
Oh!

1220
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:26,667
Hey, thank you.

1221
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,000
I hope you don't mind.
I took the liberty.

1222
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:29,900
- Oh!
- She does not mind,

1223
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:31,734
and neither do we!
Thank you.

1224
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,009
I could tell you the specials,

1225
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:36,166
or you could just
put yourselves in my hands.

1226
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,734
Oh, no, we... we will
put ourselves in your hands.

1227
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:39,867
Okay.

1228
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,367
All right. Perfect.
I'll be right back.

1229
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,509
I didn't mean it like that.

1230
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:44,233
We didn't say anything.

1231
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:45,767
No. What do you...
What do you...

1232
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,000
Nothing.

1233
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,367
Cheers.

1234
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,743
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1235
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:51,900
Aw, thank you.

1236
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:56,066
Scusami, cameriere.
Vorremmo ordinare il dessert.

1237
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,266
What a find this place is.

1238
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,100
I mean, not to mention Nick.

1239
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:06,600
What? I was talking
about his cooking.

1240
00:43:06,734 --> 00:43:08,000
Uh-huh.

1241
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:09,400
I just ordered us some dessert.

1242
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:12,500
Yes. I noticed you were
practicing your Italian.

1243
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,133
I was trying.
Every chance I get.

1244
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:15,867
Paolo's trying to improve
his English,

1245
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,109
so we're not speaking Italian
too much at home right now.

1246
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:19,509
So when are you
going back to Italy?

1247
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:21,800
Probably the start
of spring semester?

1248
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:23,100
It's just not official yet.

1249
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,967
And then you'll continue
tracing the veil?

1250
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:27,676
- That's the plan. Yeah.
- Okay.

1251
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,343
I'm still wondering
how it got to the States.

1252
00:43:29,367 --> 00:43:31,000
- And so am I.
- So is Avery.

not as good as I thought!

This is amazing.

1265
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:57,700
Let me cut that
into some smaller pieces.

1266
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:59,274
- We'll take care of it.
- Thank you!

1267
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:03,033
Thank you, Nick.
Everything was wonderful.

1268
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,166
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1269
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,633
So, if you find yourselves
in New York on the 30th,

1270
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:09,834
I'm doing the grand opening
of our new restaurant,

1271
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:11,407
and I would love
for you all to come.

1272
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:12,667
Oh, that's so nice of you.

1273
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,700
I think Tracy will probably have
to represent the three of us.

1274
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:17,066
Well, I won't say no to that.

1275
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,667
That's good to hear.

1276
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,300
Okay, I should probably
get back to the kitchen.

1277
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:26,400
Is there anything else
I can get for you ladies?

1278
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:27,900
No, everything was perfect.

1279
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:29,367
It really was.

1280
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,800
All right. Wonderful.
Very nice to meet both of you.

1281
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:34,000
You too.

1282
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:40,567
What?

1283
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,500
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1284
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:44,066
Stop looking at me like that.

1285
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,343
The cheesecake's really good.

1286
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:46,367
Really good.

1287
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,500
It is good.

1288
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:57,643
I just can't believe that Nick
wouldn't let us pay for dinner.

1289
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,934
He is quite a guy.

1290
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:02,033
No! Do not go all Avery on me.

1291
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,033
I'm just saying,

1292
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,033
it's obvious he likes you,

1293
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:05,409
and from what I can tell,
he is a keeper.

1294
00:45:05,433 --> 00:45:06,967
Definitely a keeper.

1295
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,967
Not you, too!

1296
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,242
But you have to admit, come on,

1297
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:11,100
this is the veil
working its magic.

1298
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:13,000
Really?
Are we back to that?

1299
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:15,233
Yes! But, Tracy, the veil
can only do so much.

1300
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:16,647
You do have to meet it half-way.

1301
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,567
I am not asking the veil
to do anything.

1302
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,900
I think what we're saying is,

1303
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:23,967
you just really need to think
about what it is that you want.

1304
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,543
You know, actually,
what I want right now

1305
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:26,567
is some space.

1306
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:30,734
So I'm... I'm just
gonna say goodnight.

1307
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:32,233
Tracy, I didn't...

1308
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,433
Wow.

1309
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,967
She's really good
with that whistle.

1310
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,360
I think it's a New York thing.

1311
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:45,367
Hi.

1312
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,100
Wow. This is great.

1313
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:48,467
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1314
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,967
You know,
I am a native New Yorker,

1315
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,967
and this is the first time

1316
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,460
I've ever been
to an auction house.

1317
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:55,367
No, actually,
I can't even imagine that.

1318
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,710
Can I show you around a little?

1319
00:45:56,734 --> 00:45:58,600
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

1320
00:45:58,734 --> 00:46:00,433
So how'd you get into all this?

1321
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:03,367
I always loved history,
ever since I was little.

1322
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,500
I didn't even want to go
to summer camp,

1323
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:09,166
I just wanted to visit every
historical site in the city.

1324
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,467
That sounds so nerdy
when I say it out loud.

1325
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,467
Not at all.
Bet you give one heck of a tour.

1326
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,834
Oh, yeah. All the way
from the Bronx to the Bowery.

1327
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,033
So, what do you think?

1328
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,333
Well, I mean, it's a lot,

1329
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:26,600
and I think it would be

1330
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:28,334
a great place
to come and work every day.

1331
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:29,433
You know, you've got

1332
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:33,100
all of this amazing history
coming through.

1333
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:35,033
Oh, there's just so much history

1334
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,367
and beautiful art,

1335
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,033
and amazing jewelry.

1336
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,467
It...

1337
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,467
It's everything.

1338
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:46,767
But you're here to see
the kitchen, aren't you?

1339
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,940
- Uh, yeah.
- I'll show you

1340
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,800
where you're gonna set up.

1341
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,133
So I think you have
everything we need here,

1342
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:54,133
except for a couple things,

1343
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:55,443
which I can bring
from the restaurant.

1344
00:46:55,467 --> 00:46:57,100
- Yeah, and I'll make a list.
- Perfect.

1345
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,533
Um... and I gotta tell you,

1346
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,867
seeing all
this fantastic art here

1347
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,066
has reminded me

1348
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,200
that I need to fill up the walls
at my new restaurant.

1349
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,834
So if your offer to go see
your mom's gallery

1350
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:10,000
is still on the table...

1351
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:11,333
Absolutely.

1352
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:12,700
Professionally speaking,

1353
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:15,600
I should probably
see your new restaurant first.

1354
00:47:15,734 --> 00:47:18,200
Hmm. Yeah, you might be
on to something there.

1355
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,166
Yeah.

1356
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,400
Why don't you come by
today after work?

1357
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:24,567
Sure. Sure. I'm free.
I would love to.

1358
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,700
Okay.

1359
00:47:25,734 --> 00:47:27,467
- See you there.
- Okay.

1360
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:31,914
Wow. This is a great space.

1361
00:47:32,033 --> 00:47:34,266
So have you thought about
what kind of art?

1362
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,433
Well, I like paintings.

1363
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,433
Right. That's a little vague.

1364
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:40,500
I like paintings of landscapes,
you know?

1365
00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:42,900
And when you look at them,
you kind of want to go there,

1366
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:44,266
type of landscapes.

1367
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,000
Yeah, I know exactly
what you mean.

1368
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:49,834
Okay, well, any other thoughts?

1369
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:50,967
No.

1370
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:54,000
Just nothing that makes you
lose your appetite.

1371
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:56,367
Right! Good call.

1372
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,867
Uh, you know,
art is subjective, right?

1373
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,433
I get that, and that's
really why I need your help.

1374
00:48:01,567 --> 00:48:04,800
Like, I am very confident
with my calamari,

1375
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:08,367
but I have no idea what to put
on the walls, you know?

1376
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:10,986
Have you thought about
fine art photography?

1377
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,433
Yes, and that is a great idea,

1378
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:14,100
but if I put
a photo on these walls

1379
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:15,333
that is not of my family,

1380
00:48:15,467 --> 00:48:17,633
my grandmother, she is never
gonna let me live it down.

1381
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:19,607
Well, I don't know
if I can help you with that,

1382
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:20,633
but...

1383
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:23,333
Oh, um, that was just Luigi
texting me

1384
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,176
to remind me that I need
to pick up the veil.

1385
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,640
I thought
you picked that up already?

1386
00:48:26,767 --> 00:48:28,767
No. No, I haven't
had a chance yet.

1387
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,900
It's no rush.

1388
00:48:29,934 --> 00:48:32,000
I thought
your friends needed it?

1389
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:34,900
They... no. They, uh,
are already married.

1390
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:37,734
In fact, they both wore the veil
at their weddings.

1391
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:39,100
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1392
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:41,276
Hmm. So that means you're
the only one of your friends

1393
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,166
that's still single?

1394
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,500
Yep, but I'm not
complaining about it.

1395
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:46,767
No, I totally get it.

1396
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,076
I'm not complaining about being

1397
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,000
the only one of my friends
who's still single,

1398
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:52,900
but if you ask my nonna
and my mother...

1399
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:54,333
ooh!

1400
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:56,066
I think I should
just pick up the veil

1401
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,233
and stop making a thing
out of it, you know?

1402
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,500
Hey, Avery,
can you hold on a second,

1403
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:04,700
so I can get Emma on, too?

1404
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:06,066
Great.

1405
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,867
Okay, now that you're both
here, I, um...

1406
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,633
I want to apologize.

1407
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:16,100
We're sorry, too.

1408
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:19,233
Yeah, we realized we came on
a little strong about Nick.

1409
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:20,700
And the veil.

1410
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:22,567
We just want you
to find the right person.

1411
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,233
Whoever it is.

1412
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:26,533
Ohh! I can't stand it
when we fight.

1413
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,667
Wait a second. I don't
remember us ever being

1414
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,700
in a big blow-out fight before.

1415
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,266
That's not true.

1416
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,710
Remember when we were
studying for finals

1417
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:35,533
and we accused the others

1418
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:37,267
of eating the last
chocolate-chip cookie?

1419
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,533
Yeah, that's 'cause you did.

1420
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:40,900
I totally forgot about that.

1421
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:43,500
In our defense,
we were super-sleep-deprived.

1422
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:44,900
I was so tired!

1423
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:49,166
So... are we good?

1424
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,967
Aw, you don't even have to ask.

1425
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,500
'Course we're good.

1426
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:53,900
I love you, girls.

1427
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:58,400
All right. Avery, you first.
Tell me about your day.

1428
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,967
Oh, that's interesting.

1429
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,333
It's a bit intense.

1430
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:08,333
Well, clearly,

1431
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:10,200
you haven't tried
my spicy ramen arrabbiata.

1432
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,800
Oh, I love that.

1433
00:50:14,967 --> 00:50:16,467
For the restaurant?

1434
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,333
No. It's for my apartment.

1435
00:50:18,467 --> 00:50:20,233
It's gonna go perfect
with my new rug.

1436
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:21,367
Which one?

1437
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,540
As I recall, you have quite
the collection going on.

1438
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,333
I'll narrow it down, okay?

1439
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,200
Find anything you like?

1440
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:31,600
Uh, I don't think so. Sorry.

1441
00:50:31,734 --> 00:50:32,734
Oh, don't be sorry.

1442
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:34,443
I've got some new pieces
coming in a few days...

1443
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:35,500
Hmm.

1444
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:36,776
If you'd like to come back.

1445
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,109
Well, let me check
with my designer.

1446
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:40,500
Would you like to come back
in a couple days?

1447
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:42,367
I think we can make that work.

1448
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,533
You don't mind
being stuck with me again?

1449
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:47,200
You're not so bad
to be stuck with.

1450
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,000
Did you hear that?

1451
00:50:58,066 --> 00:51:00,200
May I have a moment?

1452
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,633
Yes. Yes, of course, Leland.

1453
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:06,133
Tracy, I know how hard
you've worked on the party,

1454
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:07,800
and I just wanted to say
thank you

1455
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:09,667
for making it so special.

1456
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,367
Well, I am honored.

1457
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,533
I mean, Metropolitan is like
a second home to me,

1458
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:17,500
so I really wanted this party
to be perfect.

1459
00:51:17,633 --> 00:51:19,543
Well, the place wouldn't
be the same without you.

1460
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:20,333
Am I going somewhere?

1461
00:51:20,467 --> 00:51:21,467
Not if I can help it.

1462
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,600
Are you going somewhere?

1463
00:51:22,734 --> 00:51:25,133
Well, I have to retire, eventually,

1464
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:28,200
and I was hoping I could
leave it in capable hands.

1465
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:29,834
Maybe those hands
might be yours.

1466
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:33,767
Shall we go over
and join our guests?

1467
00:51:39,467 --> 00:51:40,633
Good news, bad news?

1468
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:41,834
Good news.

1469
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:44,200
The good news is you look
fantastic. Love the dress.

1470
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,700
Thank you.

1471
00:51:45,834 --> 00:51:47,633
There's no bad news.

1472
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:56,200
Hey, are you okay handling
things on your own for a while?

1473
00:51:57,767 --> 00:52:00,700
Yeah, take as long as you want.

1474
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:01,867
What?

1475
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,581
You got your eyes on something
a little special over here?

1476
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,033
Oh, uh, I'm just
appreciating the earrings.

1477
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:10,676
Which? These, uh,
blue ones right here?

1478
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,233
Mm-hmm. They're sapphires.

1479
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:13,687
There's just
something about them.

1480
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,266
Wow. Those are beautiful.

1481
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,000
Have you heard the big buzz
of the party?

1482
00:52:18,066 --> 00:52:19,367
- No.
- Everyone's raving

1483
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,500
about your food.

1484
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:21,600
- What? Wow!
- Mm-hmm.

1485
00:52:21,734 --> 00:52:24,166
Wow. That is, uh,
that is music to my ears.

1486
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,000
Well, I have to thank you,

1487
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:28,533
because this party
is really important to me.

1488
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,233
Of course. Of course.

1489
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:33,734
And it was a pleasure
to, you know, watch you

1490
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:35,600
and kind of get a glimpse
into your world.

1491
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:36,734
So thank you.

1492
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:38,934
Have you had a chance
to see the Lazarus poem?

1493
00:52:39,066 --> 00:52:39,867
No, I haven't.

1494
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,834
Can you come see it now?

1495
00:52:40,967 --> 00:52:41,976
Are you kidding me?
Absolutely.

1496
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1497
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:48,266
Wow. Look at that.
That is special.

1498
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,266
Yeah.

1499
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,367
To see this poem
in her actual handwriting?

1500
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,934
- I know.
- Wow.

1501
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:55,033
Now I understand why
you've been fighting so hard.

1502
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,266
And mostly failing.

1503
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,900
But that's okay.
I am not giving up.

1504
00:52:58,033 --> 00:52:59,500
I am not throwing in the towel.

1505
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:05,333
Who is that guy?

1506
00:53:05,467 --> 00:53:06,834
Carter Wainwright.

1507
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,166
He has a vast collection

1508
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,667
of incredibly important
historical artifacts

1509
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,360
and he keeps them all
locked in a vault.

1510
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,533
I hate the idea
of a guy like that

1511
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:18,066
getting his hands on the poem.

1512
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,600
It deserves to be seen

1513
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:21,567
by the immigrants
that it was written for.

1514
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,600
Nick! That's it.

1515
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,266
You just gave me a great idea.

1516
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,200
So, remember,

1517
00:53:29,266 --> 00:53:30,743
in our conversation
at the party, you said,

1518
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:33,633
how much that poem meant
to immigrants, right?

1519
00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:35,000
- Yeah.
- I should find someone

1520
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:36,333
who it means something to,

1521
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:38,633
you know, someone who lived it.

1522
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:41,633
Yeah, someone who emigrated
to the U.S. themselves.

1523
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:42,967
Yes! Exactly.

1524
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,066
So I researched
all day and all night

1525
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,834
and I finally found
the perfect person.

1526
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:49,133
Rangan Narula.

1527
00:53:49,266 --> 00:53:50,100
The tech guy?

1528
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:52,133
Exactly. He came from nothing

1529
00:53:52,266 --> 00:53:54,133
and he went the distance.

1530
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:56,467
Yeah, I'm not doing that again.

1531
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,567
He is an incredibly inspiring
rags-to-riches story.

1532
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,000
And he lives in Manhattan.

1533
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:03,633
No way.
So, you called him?

1534
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:05,600
Well, it's Sunday,
so his office is closed.

1535
00:54:05,734 --> 00:54:08,500
I emailed him
and all five of his assistants.

1536
00:54:08,633 --> 00:54:09,667
Well, there you go.

1537
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,734
Thank you.

1538
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:21,667
This is it. This is the one.

1539
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,867
You sure?

1540
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,767
Yes, I am sure, it's perfect.
It fits right in.

1541
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,540
Well, I guess you do
have to try a few out

1542
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,667
before you find the right one.

1543
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,000
Are you still talking
about rugs?

1544
00:54:33,133 --> 00:54:34,700
Ahh... maybe.

1545
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:35,700
Maybe not.

1546
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:37,409
'Kay, well, I'm still
talking about rugs,

1547
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:39,300
so don't confuse me.

1548
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:41,166
Well, I guess
you'll figure it out.

1549
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,100
Eventually.

1550
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:46,233
- What?
- Nothing.

1551
00:54:48,533 --> 00:54:49,893
Morning, sunshine.
What's going on?

1552
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:51,467
- Why don't you tell me?
- What?

1553
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,667
You got a call
from Rangan Narula's office.

1554
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,734
What's that all about?

1555
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,800
Ms. Goodwyn?

1556
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,033
Oh, yes. Hi.

1557
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:16,533
- I'm ready.
- I am so sorry.

1558
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:18,743
Mr. Narula has to reschedule
his appointment with you.

1559
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:20,247
He was called away
on urgent business.

1560
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:21,867
Perhaps next month sometime?

1561
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,934
No. Next month is too late.

1562
00:55:24,066 --> 00:55:26,600
Apologies.

1563
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:36,700
Hi.

1564
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:37,934
How did it go with Narula?

1565
00:55:38,066 --> 00:55:38,767
Oh...

1566
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,367
he had to go out of town

1567
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,242
and he's not gonna be able
to reschedule the meeting

1568
00:55:42,266 --> 00:55:43,467
until after the auction.

1569
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,500
Oh, that's a bummer.
I'm sorry.

1570
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,100
But hey, you pushed to get
one meeting with him.

1571
00:55:48,233 --> 00:55:49,543
Chances are,
you push to get another one,

1572
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:50,927
you can get one
before the auction.

1573
00:55:51,033 --> 00:55:52,153
Yeah, I guess.
It's just that

1574
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:55,266
Pushy Tracy is a little tired
from being so pushy.

1575
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,910
Sounds like you need
a little cheering up,

1576
00:55:56,934 --> 00:55:58,100
and I could use a break.

1577
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:00,266
I guess I just thought
you never slowed down.

1578
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,033
Juggling two restaurants,
even temporarily,

1579
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:05,400
is a lot more difficult
than I thought.

1580
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:07,800
So this is
a no-work night, then.

1581
00:56:07,934 --> 00:56:08,700
Mm-hmm.

1582
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:10,200
No talking about food
or auctions.

1583
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,667
Those are some strict rules.

1584
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,800
I guess we're gonna find out
if our jobs define us.

1585
00:56:13,934 --> 00:56:16,834
Yeah, we could talk about
how your re-decorating is going,

1586
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:18,667
or your rug-collecting.

1587
00:56:19,934 --> 00:56:23,000
Okay, that whole situation
is winding down, okay?

1588
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,533
But we have to figure out
another subject to discuss.

1589
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:26,700
Oh, I know.

1590
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:29,133
How about places in New York
that we haven't visited?

1591
00:56:29,266 --> 00:56:31,100
In fact, I'll bet
you've never been to see

1592
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:33,567
the last remaining piece
of the Ziegfeld Theatre.

1593
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:36,367
What?
Where has that been hiding?

1594
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,367
That's a secret.
I'm not tellin' you.

1595
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,643
- What?
- I'll show it to you, though.

1596
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:40,747
- If you want to go.
- Okay.

1597
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,867
Or... we could get
another piece of pizza.

1598
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,900
Ooh... uh...

1599
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,166
I don't know.
This is really good pizza.

1600
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,533
- Mm-hmm.
- But...

1601
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,810
I want to go see the theater.

1602
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:51,834
Aww...

1603
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,200
All right, fine.

1604
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,266
Okay, so, I think we ended
in a tie, right?

1605
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,266
Because we both stuck
to the rules the whole time.

1606
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,033
But you almost blew it

1607
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:04,066
when you first saw
that Ziegfeld statue.

1608
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,376
You weren't supposed
to notice that?

1609
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,333
- I notice everything.
- Well, I can't help it!

1610
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,187
Ohh, now that it's over,
I have to tell you,

1611
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,400
ooh, that statue would kill
at auction.

1612
00:57:11,533 --> 00:57:12,934
Should we go back and get it?

1613
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,166
Thank you so much
for such a nice evening.

1614
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,100
I had a great time.

1615
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:23,533
Yeah, me too.

1616
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:26,333
Let me know if you need
any more rugs carried up.

1617
00:57:26,467 --> 00:57:29,066
No, I think I'm good,
'cause that one's a keeper.

1618
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,834
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
We'll see about that.

1619
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,233
Goodnight.

1620
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,100
Goodnight!

1621
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:50,700
Hey! How are you?

1622
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:51,934
I think I'm in love.

1623
00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:54,433
Tracy! That's wonderful.

1624
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:55,934
It's the perfect fit.

1625
00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:57,767
That's so hard to find.

1626
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,934
Tell me about it.
I searched high and low.

1627
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:01,533
That's what it takes sometimes.

1628
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:03,266
I'm just so glad
the search is over...

1629
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,967
and that I got such a bargain.

1630
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:06,934
Nick?

1631
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,967
No, I'm talking about
my new rug.

1632
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,540
I thought
we were talking about Nick.

1633
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,867
You can't ask me to choose

1634
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,080
between Nick and my new rug.

1635
00:58:13,133 --> 00:58:14,000
Okay.

1636
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:15,867
What about you and Nick?

1637
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,600
I haven't decided
about that yet.

1638
00:58:17,734 --> 00:58:19,266
You're interested, right?

1639
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,467
Yes.

1640
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
That's something.

1641
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,367
I'm just not sure what yet...

1642
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,100
Oh, I have to get
back to the office.

1643
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:26,100
All right.

1644
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:27,100
I'll talk to you soon.

1645
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:28,800
Love you.

1646
00:58:28,934 --> 00:58:30,500
She's in love with her rug?

1647
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:31,500
Yeah.

1648
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,743
But your instincts were right.

1649
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:34,900
She's been spending
more time with Nick.

1650
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:36,800
That's the veil
working its magic.

1651
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:38,467
I wouldn't mention that
to Tracy.

1652
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,200
Oh, right, no. Of course not.

1653
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,333
But I'm just telling you,

1654
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:43,267
I cannot wait to see her
in that wedding veil.

1655
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,500
I know, but I wouldn't
mention that, either.

1656
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:47,300
'Course not. Okay, bye.

1657
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:50,934
That is definitely a piece
of Broadway history.

1658
00:58:51,066 --> 00:58:53,533
I'll have to check out
this Ziegfeld statue for myself.

1659
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:54,976
I have other photos.
You can scroll back.

1660
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,367
Okay. Oh, yeah!

1661
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,300
Oh...

1662
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:58,553
That's from Avery's wedding.

1663
00:58:58,667 --> 00:58:59,967
Oh! That's a cute picture.

1664
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:02,266
We took that in the gallery
at the Stanbridge Museum.

1665
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,266
Oh, this infamous painting...

1666
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Oh...

1667
00:59:04,533 --> 00:59:06,233
Tuxedo texting.

1668
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,910
- Let me text him back. Uh...
- No. No, no, no, no!

1669
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:09,134
Do not text him.
Give it to me!

1670
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,033
No...

1671
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,500
Oh, he's just
asking me to lunch.

1672
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:12,710
Oh, that's fun.
Where will you go?

1673
00:59:12,734 --> 00:59:15,233
I don't know.
I'm gonna let him decide.

1674
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:16,500
- I'll just...
- Okay, yeah.

1675
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,433
That's cool. See. Uh...
"I raise you, your move." Yeah?

1676
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:20,433
What about...

1677
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:21,567
Well, go somewhere new.

1678
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,734
Okay. Okay, okay. Yeah.
That's what he wrote back!

1679
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:24,943
- He said "somewhere new"?
- Yes.

1680
00:59:24,967 --> 00:59:26,367
Pickin' up
what you're puttin' down!

1681
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,567
- Wow.
- Let's go.

1682
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,567
You two are in sync.

1683
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,934
So we do this every month.

1684
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,200
It was my nonna's idea.

1685
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,533
She loves giving back, so...

1686
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:36,266
Oh. I like her even more.

1687
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,700
Welcome to our little
family tradition.

1688
00:59:38,834 --> 00:59:40,810
This is awesome. I would love
to help out, if I can.

1689
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:41,834
You don't have to.

1690
00:59:41,867 --> 00:59:43,900
I want to.

1691
00:59:44,033 --> 00:59:45,509
You know, I bussed tables
when I was in college.

1692
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:46,676
I can get four plates
on one arm.

1693
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,810
Wow, that's a lot of plates.

1694
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,367
Mama.

1695
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,033
Sorry to interrupt.
This is Isabella.

1696
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,667
- Tracy.
- Hi.

1697
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,433
It's a pleasure
to meet you, honey.

1698
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:55,433
It's really nice
to meet you, too.

1699
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:56,433
This is my nonna, Gia.

1700
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:58,266
Oh, I've heard
so much about you.

1701
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,734
And I've heard about you.

1702
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:01,100
Nick says

1703
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:04,700
you're trying to put the poem
Emma Lazarus wrote in a museum

1704
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:05,834
for everyone to see.

1705
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:07,567
Well, I am hoping
to make that happen.

1706
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,166
And Tracy wants to help out,

1707
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,033
she wants to help serve.

1708
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:12,033
I'll get you an apron!

1709
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:12,934
Oh, thank you.

1710
01:00:13,066 --> 01:00:14,533
- Oh...
- Don't make me laugh.

1711
01:00:14,667 --> 01:00:15,787
You can use your other hand!

1712
01:00:15,834 --> 01:00:17,376
- No, no. It's a point of pride.
- All right.

1713
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,000
Don't.
Don't say anything.

1714
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:21,333
She's not Italian.

1715
01:00:22,467 --> 01:00:24,700
Here I come. Okay.

1716
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:25,934
That's for you.

1717
01:00:26,066 --> 01:00:27,200
And that's for you, sir.

1718
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,200
Yeah, but, Ma,
she seems to really like

1719
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:32,600
one particular Italian
we both love, so...

1720
01:00:32,734 --> 01:00:35,000
Nice! Whoo!

1721
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,600
Thank you.
Best tip I ever got.

1722
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,066
And he looks very happy.

1723
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,266
And that's all
that really matters, right?

1724
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,834
Yeah.

1725
01:00:43,967 --> 01:00:45,066
You know what,

1726
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,734
Nick, I just want
to say thank you

1727
01:00:46,867 --> 01:00:48,600
for including me here today.

1728
01:00:48,734 --> 01:00:49,867
I had a great time.

1729
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,867
I had a great time watching you
juggle all those plates.

1730
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,867
Yeah, it's good to know

1731
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,509
I still have a skill
I can fall back on.

1732
01:00:55,533 --> 01:00:57,266
I'm sure you've got
more than one.

1733
01:00:58,967 --> 01:01:01,667
I know it's not like
being a professional chef,

1734
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,266
but I was a short-order cook.

1735
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,467
Seriously?

1736
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,443
Yeah, seriously. Why
are you looking so surprised?

1737
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:08,433
What can I say?
You're full of surprises.

1738
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:09,943
You're welcome to come over
for dinner tonight.

1739
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:11,934
I'd like to prove it to you.

1740
01:01:12,066 --> 01:01:14,133
Huh. I do have the night off.

1741
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:15,834
Are you sure?
Most people are afraid

1742
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:17,767
to have a chef
over to their house for dinner,

1743
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,443
they're afraid their cooking
is not gonna measure up.

1744
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,800
Well, I'm not afraid.

1745
01:01:20,934 --> 01:01:21,934
I like a challenge.

1746
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:23,900
Game on.

1747
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:30,633
Come on, in, Nick.

1748
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:31,800
Door's open.

1749
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,600
So, I wasn't sure
what you were cooking tonight,

1750
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:37,834
so I brought
a little rosso e bianco.

1751
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:39,667
Thank you so much. Perfect.

1752
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,767
Mm. It smells good.

1753
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,340
It's not Italian,
but it smells good.

1754
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:45,176
Well, I thought we could have
something different.

1755
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,967
Went with an American classic.

1756
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:47,934
Sloppy Joes.

1757
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:49,667
- Sloppy Joes?
- Comfort food.

1758
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,433
Oh, that's why
I didn't recognize it.

1759
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:53,100
You've had it before, right?

1760
01:01:53,233 --> 01:01:54,100
No, I have not.

1761
01:01:54,233 --> 01:01:55,600
How is that even possible?

1762
01:01:55,734 --> 01:01:56,734
Hey, I'm Italian.

1763
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,834
You know? We do
the meat-ah-ball-ah sub-ah.

1764
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:02,700
You need to know
that I survived on this recipe

1765
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:03,900
when I was in college,

1766
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:06,400
so I like to think

1767
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:08,266
that I perfected it.

1768
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,700
Mm-hmm.

1769
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:16,734
Very good.

1770
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:17,967
Mm. Mwah.

1771
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,100
But it needs something?

1772
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:20,467
What? No. No, no, no.

1773
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,109
I-I am the guest tonight,
you are the cook,

1774
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:23,166
so whatever you think.

1775
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,333
Right, but you're
a professional chef.

1776
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:26,533
You would know.

1777
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:28,233
I-I can take it,
I can handle the truth.

1778
01:02:28,367 --> 01:02:30,734
Okay. Maybe
it could use a little cumin.

1779
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:33,633
Cumin? Okay. Cumin.

1780
01:02:34,867 --> 01:02:35,867
Um...

1781
01:02:35,967 --> 01:02:36,967
Okay, garlic powder...

1782
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,676
Wow, you've got
a lot of seasonings there.

1783
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,633
Let me check...
I'm gonna reach over here.

1784
01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:45,100
Okay, what's... Oh!

1785
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:48,033
There we go.

1786
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,300
Yeah, you found it.

1787
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:50,800
I found it. You mind? Yeah?

1788
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,066
Oh, no. Please.
Here. Go ahead.

1789
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,567
All right.

1790
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,433
Okay.

1791
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:01,867
We mix this up a little...

1792
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,309
see that wrist movement
back there?

1793
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:04,567
There's a flair to it.

1794
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,200
This is just cooking.

1795
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:08,567
Bring your tastebuds over here.

1796
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,242
I don't want to get this
on your pretty dress,

1797
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:11,266
- so, careful.
- 'Kay.

1798
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,767
That's amazing! Oh, my gosh.

1799
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,800
It's so much better.

1800
01:03:19,934 --> 01:03:21,734
You'd think
I do this for a living.

1801
01:03:21,867 --> 01:03:22,987
Yeah! Well, dinner is ready.

1802
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:24,409
You know, sometimes,
it's just the simplest things

1803
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,433
that surprise you.

1804
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,367
Yeah.

1805
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,800
Okay.

1806
01:03:27,934 --> 01:03:29,367
I will set the table.

1807
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,967
Oh. Oh, thank you.

1808
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,800
Yeah, you can just
move my stuff anywhere.

1809
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:35,767
What,
are you researching Narula?

1810
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,533
I want to get to him

1811
01:03:37,667 --> 01:03:40,200
without having to wait
for another meeting.

1812
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:42,300
I've just been doing
a lot of research on him.

1813
01:03:42,433 --> 01:03:43,300
I even found out

1814
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:45,266
what neighborhood he's from
in Queens,

1815
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,667
and where he eats breakfast
there every Sunday.

1816
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,000
Wow.

1817
01:03:49,133 --> 01:03:52,433
So which wine should I open...
The red or the white with this?

1818
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:54,233
Mm, good question.

1819
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,687
You know,
we're doing sloppy Joes,

1820
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:57,367
so maybe I have a better option.

1821
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Beer.

1822
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:00,834
Are you reading my mind?

1823
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,333
Great minds think alike.

1824
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:06,734
Cheers.

1825
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Oh, this is it.

1826
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:12,433
Oh, there he is,
he's in that back booth.

1827
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:13,433
Oh, yeah.

1828
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,834
Okay. Uh, you got this, okay?

1829
01:04:15,967 --> 01:04:17,333
Don't forget to breathe.

1830
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,033
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

1831
01:04:22,033 --> 01:04:23,433
Well, here goes nothing.

1832
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:25,533
Go get 'em, tiger.

1833
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,033
Mr. Narula?

1834
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:32,500
- Yes?
- I am is Tracy Goodwyn,

1835
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:34,900
I work at
the Metropolitan Auction House.

1836
01:04:35,033 --> 01:04:38,266
We were meant to have
a meeting last week

1837
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,443
and you were unable to attend.

1838
01:04:39,467 --> 01:04:41,600
Anyway, I'm really sorry
for intruding like this.

1839
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:43,333
It's not the kind of thing
I usually do.

1840
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:46,433
I usually eat my breakfast
alone without interruptions.

1841
01:04:46,567 --> 01:04:48,166
I know. Yeah. I read that.

1842
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,667
I'm sorry... about this,

1843
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,967
but I really need
a moment of your time.

1844
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,367
My eggs are getting cold.

1845
01:04:54,567 --> 01:04:56,367
Of course. Right. Sorry.

1846
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,467
That's the third time
you're apologizing.

1847
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,800
Are you done?

1848
01:04:59,934 --> 01:05:02,333
Apologizing?
Yes, actually.

1849
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:03,767
Pretty sure I am.

1850
01:05:05,066 --> 01:05:07,934
Then let me apologize to you
for canceling our meeting.

1851
01:05:08,066 --> 01:05:09,567
Please, sit down,

1852
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,767
so I can at least eat my food
while it's still warm.

1853
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,467
Great. Okay.

1854
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,000
Ah! Yes.

1855
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,567
- Well?
- Yeah, uh...

1856
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,820
I think it went really well.

1857
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,100
He said that he wasn't sure yet,

1858
01:05:25,233 --> 01:05:26,734
but he told me
to write up a proposal

1859
01:05:26,867 --> 01:05:27,943
and he said he would
show it to his lawyers.

1860
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:29,007
Sounds like a "yes" to me.

1861
01:05:29,066 --> 01:05:30,734
I did express urgency to him,
you know,

1862
01:05:30,867 --> 01:05:32,700
that the auction
was only a few days away.

1863
01:05:32,834 --> 01:05:34,509
What do you have to do?
Just write a proposal, right?

1864
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:37,200
Only the best proposal
of my entire life.

1865
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,367
You got this!

1866
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,209
Let's go back to Da Nonna,
I'll cook you breakfast,

1867
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:41,543
and you can write
this amazing proposal.

1868
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:42,867
No, I-I probably...

1869
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,033
Well...

1870
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:45,567
there gonna be cannolis?

1871
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,667
Of course! Cannolis, yes.
You earned it. Come on.

1872
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,500
Okay.

1873
01:05:48,633 --> 01:05:50,000
- Just one.
- Yes. Maybe five.

1874
01:05:57,233 --> 01:05:58,100
What was that?

1875
01:05:58,233 --> 01:05:59,734
Those are the sapphire earrings.

1876
01:05:59,867 --> 01:06:02,200
Someone put
a pre-emptive offer on 'em.

1877
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,409
I never got to try them on.

1878
01:06:03,433 --> 01:06:04,667
Yeah. Okay...

1879
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,276
- Can we go over the checklist?
- Yeah.

1880
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,600
Only thing that's left to do
is tag the auction items.

1881
01:06:09,734 --> 01:06:11,109
Okay, but don't tag
the Lazarus poem just yet.

1882
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,367
Still nothing from Narula?

1883
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,367
No.

1884
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,667
But I think it's just him
and his lawyers

1885
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,810
going over all the paperwork.
It's complicated, you know?

1886
01:06:17,834 --> 01:06:18,967
It's not just a purchase,

1887
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,266
it's a purchase,
and then a donation.

1888
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,400
Right.

1889
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:24,433
Okay, well,
should we go to lunch?

1890
01:06:24,567 --> 01:06:26,667
I have to work through it
because I'm leaving early

1891
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,080
to meet Nick
at my mom's gallery.

1892
01:06:28,133 --> 01:06:29,813
You two are becoming
quite a regular thing.

1893
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,734
Should I be jealous?

1894
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:32,266
Of course not.

1895
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,333
You'll always be
my work husband.

1896
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:35,500
- Mwah!
- I'll take it.

1897
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:37,467
The new paintings
I want to show you

1898
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,600
are right over here.

1899
01:06:38,734 --> 01:06:41,266
Ah, fantastic.

1900
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,633
More of what
we were looking for.

1901
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:44,633
Good.

1902
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:45,633
See, this reminds me of Verona.

1903
01:06:45,767 --> 01:06:46,776
That's where my grandmother
was born.

1904
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,000
Ah.

1905
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:50,700
That makes sense.
The painter's Italian.

1906
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:54,333
Hmm. I don't think it's quite
what we're looking for,

1907
01:06:54,467 --> 01:06:55,533
for Tesoro Mio.

1908
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:56,667
What... What do you think?

1909
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:57,767
Probably not.

1910
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,767
Okay.

1911
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,233
Let me see.
What else do we have?

1912
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:04,166
This speaks to me.

1913
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,667
Reminds me of that day
down by the water.

1914
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,800
Yeah.

1915
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:09,200
I know what you mean.

1916
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,240
The day we were at the water,
it was very cold.

1917
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,867
Well, maybe
it was cold this day, too,

1918
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,066
and the artist decided to paint
blue skies instead of clouds.

1919
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,767
I hadn't realized
you were an optimist.

1920
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,140
It's one of my better qualities.

1921
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,633
You have a few.

1922
01:07:25,133 --> 01:07:27,433
I see you found one you like.

1923
01:07:27,567 --> 01:07:29,767
It's called "Cielo Blu".

1924
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,600
Mm. "Blue Sky." Weird.

1925
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,433
The artist is Italian.

1926
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:36,934
So's the guy buying it.

1927
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:38,133
Sold!

1928
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:51,667
You did good.

1929
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,767
In fact, the whole restaurant
looks good.

1930
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,900
Ah, well, thanks to you.
You had a lot to do with it.

1931
01:07:57,033 --> 01:07:59,113
I'm not just talking about
picking out the barstools.

1932
01:07:59,233 --> 01:08:02,600
Ah, it's gonna be so weird
running my own kitchen

1933
01:08:02,734 --> 01:08:03,900
when you move over here.

1934
01:08:04,033 --> 01:08:05,876
You know something? I think
we're both gonna be just fine.

1935
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,300
Where did you find it?

1936
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:10,166
That? Uh...
from the Sarah Goodwyn Gallery.

1937
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,433
As in... Tracy Goodwyn?

1938
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:15,133
Yes. That's her mother.

1939
01:08:15,266 --> 01:08:17,266
Then I wouldn't say
I'm the only one

1940
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,667
around here who's been helpful.

1941
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,066
Huh.

1942
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,066
Have you asked her out yet,
on a real date?

1943
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,800
Yeah, does pizza count?

1944
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:25,367
Yeah, if you're in college.

1945
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:29,367
Thank you, oh, wise sage.

1946
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,300
They have me on hold again.

1947
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:35,300
Well, what'd they say?

1948
01:08:35,433 --> 01:08:36,934
Just that they can't find Narula

1949
01:08:37,066 --> 01:08:38,934
so they're gonna try
to track down his lawyer.

1950
01:08:40,066 --> 01:08:41,100
When?

1951
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:42,734
Okay, okay.

1952
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:44,000
But please just make sure

1953
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:46,667
that he knows that the auction's
meant to start any moment.

1954
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,233
Thank you.

1955
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,834
Anything?

1956
01:08:50,967 --> 01:08:53,133
I can't wait any longer.
I have to start.

1957
01:08:55,266 --> 01:08:57,567
- Good morning, everyone!
- Sorry.

1958
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,233
Thank you for coming.

1959
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:02,567
We've got some very nice items
for you today.

1960
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,734
Lot number 843...

1961
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:05,343
A handwritten letter
from George Washington.

1962
01:09:05,367 --> 01:09:07,533
Bidding begins at $220,000.

1963
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:08,967
So... ah!

1964
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,867
225.

1965
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,867
300, on the phone!

1966
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
325...

1967
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:15,133
350 over here.

1968
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,233
And 375 on the phone.

1969
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:20,166
Do I hear 400?
Last chance.

1970
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,500
All right, then.
It is...

1971
01:09:22,633 --> 01:09:23,633
sold!

1972
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:26,767
For $375,000
to the bidder on the phone.

1973
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:29,233
Well, we're moving along now.

1974
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:31,800
Our next item, lot number 844,

1975
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,133
is a handwritten draft
of the poem

1976
01:09:34,266 --> 01:09:35,400
by Emma Lazarus,

1977
01:09:35,533 --> 01:09:36,533
"The New Colossus."

1978
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,433
Written in 1883...

1979
01:09:38,567 --> 01:09:39,767
this early draft
of the poem

1980
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,367
was engraved
on the Statue of Liberty.

1981
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,700
Ahem.

1982
01:09:43,834 --> 01:09:44,834
Excuse me a moment.

1983
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,100
I've just been informed

1984
01:09:50,233 --> 01:09:52,533
that this item has, in fact,
been withdrawn,

1985
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,066
so we shall move straightaway
onto our next one,

1986
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,166
lot number 845.

1987
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,367
It is a first edition...

1988
01:10:00,533 --> 01:10:02,266
Here you go.
You did it!

1989
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,400
Oh, we did it.

1990
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,934
- Okay,
- I'll buy that.

1991
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:06,500
Cheers.

1992
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:08,066
If I may,

1993
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,976
I would like to thank
each and every one of you

1994
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,233
for making today's auction
an amazing success,

1995
01:10:13,367 --> 01:10:14,900
and I especially want
to thank Tracy,

1996
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:16,133
who went out on a limb

1997
01:10:16,266 --> 01:10:18,367
to save a very important part
of American history.

1998
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,700
Cheers!

1999
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:21,767
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

2000
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,200
That was definitely
a day to remember.

2001
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:27,900
Oh, best day ever.

2002
01:10:28,033 --> 01:10:30,900
And the look
on Carter Wainwright's face...

2003
01:10:31,033 --> 01:10:32,834
- So good!
- When Leland just

2004
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:34,633
pulled the poem
away from him! Oh!

2005
01:10:34,767 --> 01:10:38,133
That alone was worth
at least a million dollars.

2006
01:10:38,266 --> 01:10:39,400
Oh, and I am so glad

2007
01:10:39,533 --> 01:10:41,133
that you were there
to share it with me.

2008
01:10:41,266 --> 01:10:42,266
- Oh!
- Me too.

2009
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,000
I wouldn't have missed it
for anything.

2010
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,066
Ah, well, uh... here we are.

2011
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,967
Thanks again.

2012
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,166
Thank you.

2013
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:17,834
I'm sorry.

2014
01:11:17,934 --> 01:11:20,400
We just got caught up
in the moment, you know?

2015
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:23,600
Well, it's a moment
I was hoping would happen.

2016
01:11:23,734 --> 01:11:26,066
I just wasn't sure
you felt the same.

2017
01:11:27,233 --> 01:11:30,667
I'm not sure I'm ready
to feel that way.

2018
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:33,233
I get it.

2019
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:34,633
We can take it slow.

2020
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:35,900
Slow feels...

2021
01:11:36,033 --> 01:11:37,300
too fast

2022
01:11:37,433 --> 01:11:40,233
for me, right now.

2023
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:41,567
I'm sorry.

2024
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,300
Have I been misreading things?

2025
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:46,133
No. It's me.

2026
01:11:46,266 --> 01:11:51,066
I-I think I've been
sending you mixed messages.

2027
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,934
Or maybe I've just
been reading them wrong.

2028
01:11:53,066 --> 01:11:54,576
Now, if you're not ready,
you're not ready.

2029
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,600
I totally understand.

2030
01:11:55,734 --> 01:11:57,800
I'm sorry.

2031
01:11:57,934 --> 01:11:59,100
Don't be.

2032
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:00,633
You're being honest with me,

2033
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,266
and that is totally admirable
and I appreciate it.

2034
01:12:05,467 --> 01:12:08,300
Maybe we should just, uh,
call it a night?

2035
01:12:11,567 --> 01:12:13,300
Thank you.

2036
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:17,233
Thank you.

2037
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,533
This is a good home for it.

2038
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:49,667
I think Emma Lazarus
would feel the same way.

2039
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,800
Thank you so much, Mr. Narula.

2040
01:12:53,133 --> 01:12:55,266
It's a pleasure.

2041
01:12:57,066 --> 01:12:59,033
- Congratulations, Tracy.
- Leland, thank you.

2042
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,200
Thank you.

2043
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:03,567
I still can't believe it's here.

2044
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,767
Stanley.
Mwah. We did it together.

2045
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,042
- No, no, no.
- We made it happen.

2046
01:13:07,066 --> 01:13:08,376
- This was all you.
- It was a team.

2047
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,960
It was a team. Okay.
I'll see you later.

2048
01:13:11,734 --> 01:13:12,533
- Mom!
- All finished?

2049
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:14,266
Thank you for waiting.

2050
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,533
Oh, honey.

2051
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:18,333
I am so proud
of all that you've done here.

2052
01:13:18,467 --> 01:13:19,467
Thank you so much.

2053
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,600
I'm a little surprised

2054
01:13:20,633 --> 01:13:22,273
you wanted
to have dinner with me tonight.

2055
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,400
- What?
- I would've thought

2056
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:26,667
you'd want to celebrate
this special moment with Nick.

2057
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,233
No. Well, things just got
a little complicated.

2058
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:35,033
Ah. Sounds like
a romantic complication.

2059
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,600
Honey, I'm your mom, remember?

2060
01:13:40,734 --> 01:13:42,533
I'd have to be blind not to see

2061
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:44,834
there was something
going on with you two.

2062
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,266
The truth is,
I'm the one who was blind.

2063
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,633
I didn't realize how close
Nick and I had gotten

2064
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:52,200
until he told me how he felt,
and I...

2065
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:53,333
and I got scared.

2066
01:13:53,467 --> 01:13:54,834
Scared of what?

2067
01:13:54,967 --> 01:13:56,333
Scared of...

2068
01:13:56,467 --> 01:13:58,100
how I feel about him.

2069
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,734
Oh, honey.

2070
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:02,934
Nick is a "forever" kind of guy,

2071
01:14:03,066 --> 01:14:06,066
and you can't confuse that
with Finn,

2072
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,000
or even your father and I.

2073
01:14:08,133 --> 01:14:09,800
All these years, I've watched

2074
01:14:09,934 --> 01:14:13,333
as you let our divorce
color your relationships,

2075
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:15,266
and the fact of the matter is,

2076
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,934
your dad and I just weren't
right for each other.

2077
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,867
But you and Nick are.

2078
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:28,734
Yeah.

2079
01:14:33,233 --> 01:14:34,100
Hello?

2080
01:14:34,233 --> 01:14:35,834
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

2081
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:37,467
Did Stanley call you?

2082
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,834
We promised we wouldn't say.

2083
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:42,233
So you know about Nick and me?

2084
01:14:42,367 --> 01:14:43,443
And since
you're on your trampoline,

2085
01:14:43,467 --> 01:14:45,000
I'm guessing you're not okay.

2086
01:14:45,133 --> 01:14:46,467
Trampolines are great
for stress.

2087
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,967
Your problem isn't stress,
it's matters of the heart.

2088
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,133
So you should probably
get off the trampoline

2089
01:14:51,266 --> 01:14:52,900
and get over
to Nick's restaurant.

2090
01:14:53,033 --> 01:14:54,567
It's the 30th.
His opening.

2091
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,800
I don't think
that I am welcome there.

2092
01:14:56,934 --> 01:14:58,667
That didn't stop you
with Rangan Narula.

2093
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,800
Get over there!

2094
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:04,767
Ladies.

2095
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,467
Hi...

2096
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,100
Hi.

2097
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,300
I-I-I was hoping

2098
01:15:22,433 --> 01:15:24,567
that the shitake mushroom
ravioli would...

2099
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,066
be on the menu tonight.

2100
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,633
Hoping that's not the reason
that you came by.

2101
01:15:29,767 --> 01:15:33,066
No. The man who made it
is why I'm here.

2102
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,000
Well, hate to break it to you,
but technically,

2103
01:15:36,133 --> 01:15:37,734
my nonna made it tonight.
She tried it,

2104
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,433
and then when she did,
she went all in,

2105
01:15:39,567 --> 01:15:40,900
but I get where you're going.

2106
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:46,507
I should've come up
with a better opening line.

2107
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,300
No, you're doing just fine.

2108
01:15:49,433 --> 01:15:52,166
Good, 'cause...

2109
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,467
that's my best material.

2110
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:57,800
So I'm sorry.

2111
01:15:57,934 --> 01:16:00,166
And the... And the truth is...

2112
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,300
the truth is,

2113
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:04,100
you're not misreading anything.

2114
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,967
So what you're saying is
that if I was to kiss you,

2115
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,300
you won't push me away?

2116
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,800
Well, it better be a good kiss.

2117
01:16:14,934 --> 01:16:17,300
But what constitutes
a good kiss?

2118
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,867
Who cares if she's not Italian?

2119
01:16:31,934 --> 01:16:34,033
That was a great kiss.

2120
01:16:37,734 --> 01:16:39,100
They make a wonderful couple!

2121
01:16:39,233 --> 01:16:40,867
Eh?

2122
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,300
You look so beautiful.

2123
01:16:53,433 --> 01:16:54,467
Oh, thank you.

2124
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,800
Have you heard from Emma?

2125
01:16:55,934 --> 01:16:57,654
Yes, she landed.
She's on her way right now.

2126
01:16:57,734 --> 01:16:58,967
Okay. Okay, great.

2127
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,176
Look at our beautiful bride.

2128
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,200
- Bellissima!
- Aw!

2129
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:02,800
Oh, thank you.

2130
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:04,033
Did Tracy tell you

2131
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,700
that's the same veil
that was worn

2132
01:17:05,834 --> 01:17:08,333
by a contessa
in a 19th-century painting?

2133
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:09,710
She told us all about
the painting

2134
01:17:09,734 --> 01:17:10,934
and the veil and the legend.

2135
01:17:11,066 --> 01:17:14,467
Seems like it's coming true
for all three of you.

2136
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,633
Hi!

2137
01:17:15,767 --> 01:17:16,867
Yay!

2138
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,867
Sorry I'm so late!

2139
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,367
After my flight got canceled,

2140
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,609
we were able
to find another one,

2141
01:17:20,633 --> 01:17:21,776
but then there was
only one seat,

2142
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,133
so Paolo
is on the next flight out.

2143
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:26,767
You look so stunning. Oh!

2144
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,800
I have so much to tell you both.

2145
01:17:28,934 --> 01:17:30,533
- Okay, but you...
- Hi!

2146
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:32,227
But you need to take
a very deep breath.

2147
01:17:32,266 --> 01:17:33,500
And you need to get dressed.

2148
01:17:33,633 --> 01:17:35,800
Okay. So.

2149
01:17:35,934 --> 01:17:38,934
I managed to track down
how the veil got to America.

2150
01:17:39,066 --> 01:17:40,834
It took me a while,
but I was able

2151
01:17:40,967 --> 01:17:41,967
to get in touch Hilda...

2152
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:43,176
She's the woman
we bought the veil from.

2153
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,200
Okay.

2154
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,810
She was able to find
her mother's bill of sale

2155
01:17:45,834 --> 01:17:46,700
for the veil and some jewelry...

2156
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:48,367
She bought it in New York

2157
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,767
in 1948,

2158
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:52,367
and you are never gonna guess
who she bought it from.

2159
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,867
Angela Diconcini.

2160
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,834
What?

2161
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:56,109
- Yeah.
- That's Arianna's granddaughter.

2162
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:58,266
Angela Diconcini was my mother.

2163
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,600
What?

2164
01:17:59,734 --> 01:18:01,900
Unbelievable.

2165
01:18:02,033 --> 01:18:04,166
Not when it comes to our veil,
it isn't.

2166
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,166
No, no. Wait a second.

2167
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,300
So you're saying

2168
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:07,843
Angela was your mother?
Claudia's daughter?

2169
01:18:07,867 --> 01:18:08,867
Yes!

2170
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:11,233
I've gotta get dressed.

2171
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:12,687
Do you know
why she sold the veil?

2172
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:16,200
Well, I-I know my mother
sold some family heirlooms

2173
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:17,200
when we got to America,

2174
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:19,266
for money
to open our restaurant...

2175
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,400
Yeah.

2176
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:21,600
But, until today,

2177
01:18:21,734 --> 01:18:24,333
I had no idea
what those heirlooms were.

2178
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:27,333
Can someone please explain
what this all means?

2179
01:18:27,467 --> 01:18:29,533
What I think it means
is that Nick's family

2180
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:32,033
are direct descendants
of Arianna and Amici.

2181
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,233
Oh!

2182
01:18:33,367 --> 01:18:35,400
And that Paolo
has even more cousins!

2183
01:18:36,867 --> 01:18:38,009
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

2184
01:18:38,033 --> 01:18:40,700
Now, I get that this Arianna
was in the painting,

2185
01:18:40,834 --> 01:18:43,266
but how exactly
is she related to us?

2186
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,400
I got this.

2187
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,500
And I got her.

2188
01:18:45,533 --> 01:18:47,200
Okay, so, Arianna and Amici...

2189
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:50,166
Amici was the artist
who painted the portrait...

2190
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,467
They fell in love,

2191
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,567
and they had
a baby named Claudia,

2192
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:57,100
but she was adopted
by Arianna's chambermaid,

2193
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:58,233
Carmela.

2194
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,033
Carmela was
my great-grandmother!

2195
01:19:01,166 --> 01:19:03,266
At least,
I thought so before today.

2196
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,000
Which also means...

2197
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:08,066
you two are cousins,
by marriage.

2198
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,033
Oh!

2199
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:10,433
And I'm so jealous!

2200
01:19:10,567 --> 01:19:11,700
No, no, no.

2201
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:13,109
No, we're all three
still sisters.

2202
01:19:13,133 --> 01:19:14,667
Yes, yes, forever!

2203
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,300
We should take our seats.

2204
01:19:16,433 --> 01:19:17,600
Come on, Mom.

2205
01:19:17,734 --> 01:19:18,934
See you out there.

2206
01:19:19,066 --> 01:19:20,567
Bye.

2207
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,266
Thank you.

2208
01:19:27,066 --> 01:19:28,467
It's your turn, Tracy.

2209
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,600
Are you nervous?

2210
01:19:30,734 --> 01:19:31,734
No.

2211
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,300
I'm not
'cause you both are by my side.

2212
01:19:34,433 --> 01:19:36,900
We have been through
quite a lot together,

2213
01:19:37,033 --> 01:19:37,900
haven't we?

2214
01:19:38,033 --> 01:19:39,200
We certainly have.

2215
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:40,667
Good and bad...

2216
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,000
mostly good.

2217
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:43,767
Ups and downs...
but mostly ups.

2218
01:19:46,266 --> 01:19:48,100
And no matter where we are...

2219
01:19:48,233 --> 01:19:50,834
we are always there
for each other.

2220
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,400
Okay.

2221
01:19:53,533 --> 01:19:54,533
Let's get you married!

2222
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,266
That's a good idea.

2223
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,300
Okay.

2224
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,200
Well...

2225
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,800
if you're gonna
make me admit it,

2226
01:20:06,934 --> 01:20:09,133
I am very glad
that we bought the veil.

2227
01:20:09,266 --> 01:20:12,133
Because you finally
believe in the legend?

2228
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:14,633
No.
Because it matches my dress.

2229
01:20:14,767 --> 01:20:16,800

So I got you a little something.

2239

- A little wedding gift.

2240

Oh...

2241
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,100
Nick!

2242
01:20:57,233 --> 01:20:59,200
You were the anonymous buyer
at the auction house?

2243
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:00,533
As soon as I saw these,

2244
01:21:00,667 --> 01:21:01,776
I knew that
they were meant for you.

2245
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,567
They are perfect.
I love them.

2246
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,433
I hope so.

2247
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,533

I have never seen Tracy happier.

01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,900
That's because she found
what we have.

2252
01:21:20,033 --> 01:21:21,934

Hilda's bill of sale
included sapphire earrings?

2257
01:21:32,033 --> 01:21:34,633
These have to be the earrings
from Arianna's portrait.

2258
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:36,867
I see the painting
every single day in the museum.

2259
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,500
I can positively tell you
those are her earrings.

2260
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:42,000
That's amazing.

2261
01:21:42,133 --> 01:21:43,767
Does you believe
in the legend now?

2262
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,633
I don't know.

2263
01:21:49,066 --> 01:21:52,333
I do feel that Arianna's spirit
is looking out for us.

2264
01:21:52,467 --> 01:21:53,676
Can you just say
you believe in the veil?

2265
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,940
'Cause I can't take it anymore.

2266
01:21:55,834 --> 01:21:57,800
It's a definite "maybe".

2267
01:21:57,934 --> 01:21:58,934
I'll take it!

2268
01:22:00,867 --> 01:22:03,033
But, ladies, we do have
one thing left to do.

2269
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,033
What? Toss the bouquet?

2270
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:05,367
None of us needs it anymore.

2271
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,266
No. Actually, I was, um,
thinking about something else.

2272
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,266
Congratulations.

2273
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,200
You are now officially

2274
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:12,934
a member of
the Wedding Veil Club.

2275
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,867
You don't believe
in that legend, do you?

2276
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,967
Yeah. I'm married to Avery.

2277
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:21,266
- What, you don't believe in it?
- Oh...

2278
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,700
Tracy did have the veil
with her when we met, but, uh...

2279
01:22:24,834 --> 01:22:26,209
I don't know,
maybe there's something to it.

2280
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:27,367
Yeah.

2281
01:22:29,734 --> 01:22:30,734
We all agreed

2282
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:33,900
that we wanted to return
this veil to your family.

2283
01:22:38,066 --> 01:22:38,767
Oh...

2284
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:39,934
Thank you.

2285
01:22:40,066 --> 01:22:44,133
So... it comes back
from my mother, Angela, to me...

2286
01:22:45,433 --> 01:22:49,400
and from me to my daughter
and granddaughters.

2287
01:22:49,533 --> 01:22:50,600
Oh!

2288
01:22:50,734 --> 01:22:52,700
Thank you, Mom.

2289
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,767
Well, if the legend
is really true,

2290
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:01,033
then we'll all be dancing
at three more weddings.

2291
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,500
Oh...

2292
01:23:08,133 --> 01:23:10,000
Ladies. Hey, hey.

2293
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:11,000
I was just thinking.

2294
01:23:11,133 --> 01:23:12,967
We never talked about
where we want to go

2295
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:14,467
on our spring reunion weekend.

2296
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,433
What about going back
to San Francisco?

2297
01:23:17,567 --> 01:23:19,533
Full circle. It's perfect!

2298
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:20,667
I love that.

2299
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:22,900
We can see what other treasures
we can find.

2300
01:23:23,033 --> 01:23:25,266
We don't need
any more treasures.

2301
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,500
You know what?
You're right.

2302
01:23:26,633 --> 01:23:28,567
We have each other.

2303
01:23:29,767 --> 01:23:31,934
- To us.
- To us.

2304
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
To us.
