close, he'll run and hide.

The ambassador to Spain,
Senor Caldero.

00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:27,566
What?

88
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,006
Senor Calderon.

89
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:31,163
Yes, all right. Not now.

90
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:34,205
- It is a matter of importance, sir.
- God bless you all!

91
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:46,162
I'm trying to drink my brandy
after a very long day.

92
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,278
I simply wasn't certain

93
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:52,764
whether this was something you wanted
to take care of personally.

94
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:56,766
Leder, there are what, four million
Negroes in this country?

95
00:19:56,847 --> 00:20:01,284
Why on earth should I concern
myself with these forty-four? Hmm?

96
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:03,124
Well, there are reasons.

97
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:06,239
I don't care how.
You just take care of it.

98
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:11,723
The ship is Amistad.

99
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:16,157
It's too small to be
a transatlantic slaver.

100
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:19,284
They're plantation slaves, then?
West Indians?

101
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,238
Not necessarily.

102
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,165
At least they certainly
don't look it.

103
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:28,246
Not from the glimpse I caught of them
on their way to jail.

104
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,596
They have these...scars.

105
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,524
- Scars?
- Yeah.

106
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,883
(Church bell strikes)

107
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,681
They were first detained by officers
of a brig off Long Island.

108
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:56,005
They were conveyed to New Haven -
under what authority, I don't know -

109
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,117
and given over to
the local constabulary.

110
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:02,001
About forty of them,
including four or five children.

111
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:11,765
The arraignment
is day after tomorrow.

112
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,605
I can only assume that
the charge is murder.

113
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:17,161
I'll see what I can do about that.

114
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:22,882
Perhaps a writ for illegal arrest
and detainment to stall things.

115
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:26,761
At the very least,
make sure they have good counsel.

116
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,955
(Native language) Chief! Chief!

117
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:13,878
He's not a chief!

118
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,478
Brother! Brother!

119
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,003
He's not your brother.

120
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:25,321
- What is he then?
- He's a white man.

00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:06,680
The bench recognises
District Attorney Holabird.

126
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:10,158
I would like to present
the court, Your Honour,

127
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,880
with the charges
of piracy and murder...

128
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:15,680
I have a petition for
a writ of habeas corpus.

129
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,638
I was speaking.

130
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,919
Mr Holabird, your charges, whatever
they might be, will be rendered moot.

131
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,482
That petition, Mr Tappan
- if that's what it is - is moot,

132
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:30,806
until an actual writ by some higher
court, by some miracle, is granted.

133
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:34,237
- Mr Holabird is correct.
- And if you would, sir,

134
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:38,286
please kindly refrain from
impersonating a lawyer,

135
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,477
which you patently are not.

136
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:43,121
- As I was saying, Your Honour...
- Your Honour.

137
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:47,438
Mr Secretary.

138
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:52,242
Your Honour, I am here on behalf of
the President of the United States,

139
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:55,996
representing the claims of
Queen Isabella of Spain,

140
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:59,960
as concerns our mutual treaty
on the high seas of 1795.

141
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,322
- You have my attention.
- Thank you.

142
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:05,165
These slaves, Your Honour,
are the property of Spain,

143
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:10,565
and as such, under Article 9 of said
treaty, are to be returned posthaste.

144
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:13,758
Said treaty taking precedence
over all other claims...

145
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:16,640
Them slaves belong to me
and my mate, Your Majesty.

146
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:19,759
- Your Honour, I...
- Who be you two gentlemen?

- Your Honour...

153
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:43,599
You wish to make this claim above
that of the Queen of Spain?

154
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:45,524
Where was she, pray,

155
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,003
when we was fightin' the winds,
Your Excellen...uh, Honour.

156

Her Majesty, the Queen of Spain,
was busy ruling a country.

claims are just...

00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:58,958
Your Honour!

159
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:04,681
Here are the true owners
of these slaves.

161

- Order!
- On their behalf...

162
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:12,997
I am in possession of
a receipt for purchase

163

executed in Havana, Cuba,
June 26, 1839,

I do hereby call upon this court
to immediately surrender...

- ..these goods!

Pedro Montes.

00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:46,242
Ah, Mr Tappan. How do you do, sir?

171
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:49,882
My name is Roger S Baldwin,
attorney-at-law.

172
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,878
Real estate?

173
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:54,487
Real estate, inventories
and other assets.

174
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:58,440
- Can I help you with something?
- What is it that you do?

175
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,684
Well, I own various business...
and banks.

176
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:07,517
As a matter of fact, you probably
could help me, Mr Tappan. (Chuckles)

177
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,764
But that's not why I'm here.
I'd like to help you.

- Yes. I deal with property.

00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:16,235
Sometimes I get people's
property back,

180
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:18,960
other times I get it taken away,
as in this case.

181
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:22,397
Every one of the claims speaks
to the issue of ownership.

182
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:26,235
- Thank you, Mr...Mr Baldwin.
- Baldwin, Roger S, attorney-at-law.

183
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:31,077
(Chuckles) But I'm afraid what's
needed here is a criminal attorney.

184
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:33,925
A trial lawyer.
But thanks for your interest.

185
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,276
Yes. Well...

186
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:41,282
intending no disrespect, Mr Tappan,
but if that were the way to go,

187
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,198
well, then...

188
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:46,279
Well, I wouldn't have bothered
coming down here.

189
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:48,238
(Tappan laughs)

190
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:54,245
Goodbye. I bid you gentlemen
a good afternoon.

191
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:57,485
In closing,...

192
00:26:57,527 --> 00:27:01,122
I call upon our distinguished
colleague from Massachusetts,

193
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:04,165
Representative John Quincy Adams

194
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:07,722
to reweigh his unmeet
and unprecedented attempt

195
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:12,204
to convert this eccentric
bequest of - let's be frank -

196
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:15,080
a bunch of junk of
one James Smithson,

197
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:19,006
into a so-called institute
of national treasure!

198
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:20,998
(Man coughs)

199
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:25,637
Perhaps Mr Adams is meditating
on his response.

200
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,598
(Laughter)

201
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:42,361
Had I thought your remarks worthy
of riposte, Representative Pinckney,

202
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:46,798
be assured you'd have heard
from me...hours ago!

203
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:52,045
- Who?
- Mr Tappan. Lewis Tappan.

204
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,998
Yeah?

205
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:56,965
I must see him?
I'm required to see him?

206
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,963
No, sir. He requests an audience.

207
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:00,918
Give me your hand.

208
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:03,197
Oh, he requests, does he?

209
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:06,956
Yeah. I don't know
anyone called Tappan.

210
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:10,636
- Sir, you do. You've met him often.
- Where?

211
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:13,155
- Where is he?
- He's right over there, sir.

212
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:15,038
Oh.

213
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,322
- What is that?
- (Coin clinking)

214
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:19,278
- Where?
- Right there, sir.

215
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:22,040
Lewis! Good to see you again!

216
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,078
- And you, sir.
- (Laughs)

217
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,960
- This is Theodore Joadson.
- How do you do, sir?

218
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:30,676
- An honour to meet you, sir.
- Yeah.

219
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:33,958
- Sir? Is there somewhere...
- Let's stroll in the garden...

220
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,322
- Yes.
- What?

221
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,517
Let go of my arm. Over here.

222
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,361
(Tappan) This case has
great significance.

223
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:49,205
Our secretary of state
is paying it his attention.

224
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:51,721
(Adams) You don't have to shout!

225
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:56,198
(Tappan) He supports the Queen's
claim that she owns the Africans.

226
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:59,922
- Two sailors are making claims.
- (Adams) What season is it?

227
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:02,686
- Pardon?
- I said, what season is it?

228
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,803
I don't understand what you mean.

229
00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:08,920
There are two ways of knowing
without consulting a calendar.

230
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:11,362
The leaves on the maple trees
have all gone,

231
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:16,162
and the fact that the President is
not at home on Pennsylvania Avenue.

232
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:18,163
Tell me, sir...

233
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:21,404
Do you really think Van Buren
cares about the whims

234
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:24,405
of an 11-year-old girl
who wears a tiara?

235
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:29,237
I assure you, only one thing occupies
his thoughts this time of the year,

236
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:34,077
being all things to all people,
which means nothing to no one.

237
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:37,637
In other words,
gettin' himself re-elected.

238
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:39,798
Give me a hand.

239
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,478
Huh?

240
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:49,160
- Will you help us, sir?
- Let go of my arm.

241
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,238
Take my stick.

242
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:55,965
- Mr Adams?
- Yeah, what?

243
00:29:56,047 --> 00:30:00,563
As an advocate for the abolition
of slavery, will you help us?

244
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:05,317
I'm neither friend nor foe to the
abolitionist cause. I won't help you.

245
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:07,039
(Joadson) Sir...

246
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:10,875
- What?
- I know you, Mr President.

247
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:15,205
I know you and your presidency as
well as any man, and your father's.

248
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,762
You were a child at his side
when he helped invent America.

249
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:23,085
You, in turn, have devoted your life
to refining that noble invention.

250
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:25,357
There remains but one task undone.

251
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,444
One vital task the Founding
Fathers left to their sons,

252
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:32,958
before their 13 colonies could
precisely be called United States.

253
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:37,762
And that task, sir, as you
well know, is crushing slavery.

254
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:42,437
Your record confirms you're an
abolitionist, sir, even if you won't.

255
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:45,360
- And whether or not you admit it...
- Mr Joadson.

256
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:47,363
..you belong with us.

257
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,998
(Sniffs)

258
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:54,244
You're quite the scholar,
Mr Joadson, aren't ya?

259
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,482
Quite the historian.

260
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:03,600
Let me tell you about
that quality, if I might.

261
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:08,522
Without an accompanying mastery of at
least one-tenth its measure of grace,

262
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:11,519
such erudition is worthless, sir.

263
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:14,766
Now, you take it from one who knows.

264
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,040
If you gentlemen will excuse me.

265
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,964
(Sniffs)

266
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:26,801
- We know we aimed high asking you...
- Well, aim lower!

267
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:31,281
Find yourselves someone
whose inspiration blossoms

268
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,238
the more you lose.

269
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:39,682
(Joadson) If the court
awards them to Spain,

270
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:42,161
they'll be taken to Cuba
and executed.

271
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:46,758
If the two lieutenants prevail,
they'll likely to sell them to Spain,

272
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:48,684
and they'll be executed.

273
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:51,287
If Montes and Ruiz are successful...

274
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:55,036
I'm a little confused.
What are they worth to you?

275
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:58,443
We're discussing the case,
not its expense.

276
00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:03,959
Of course. Well, the case is much
simpler than you think, Mr Tappan.

277
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,795
It's like anything - land,
livestock, heirlooms, what have you.

278
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:10,318
Livestock.

279
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,878
Yes. Consider -

280
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:18,443
the only way one may sell or purchase
slaves is if they are born slaves,

281
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:20,398
as on the plantation.

282
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:24,201
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Yes.

283
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:26,636
- So, are they?
- "Are they?"

284
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:30,236
Yes. Born slaves,
as on a plantation.

285
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:33,120
We're not certain,
but we very much doubt it.

286
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:36,045
Let's say they are.
Then they are possessions,

287
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,397
and no more deserving of
a criminal trial than a bookcase.

288
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:42,484
On the other hand,
let's say they aren't slaves,

289
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,439
in which case they were
illegally acquired.

290
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:48,638
Forget mutiny, forget piracy,
forget murder.

291
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:50,996
Those are irrelevant occurrences.

292
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:54,198
Ignore everything but
the pre-eminent issue at hand.

293
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:57,324
The wrongful transfer
of stolen goods.

294
00:32:57,407 --> 00:32:59,477
Either way, we win.

295
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:03,645
Sir, this war must be waged on
the battlefield of righteousness.

296
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:06,121
The what?

297
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:09,324
It would be against
everything I stand for

298
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:13,599
to let this deteriorate into
an exercise in legal minutia.

299
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:17,356
Mr Tappan, I'm talking about
the heart of the matter.

300
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,920
As am I.

301
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:23,722
It is our destiny,
as abolitionists and as Christians,

302
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,644
to save these people.

303
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:28,918
These are people, Mr Baldwin,
not livestock.

304
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,880
Did Christ hire a lawyer
to get him off on technicalities?

305
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,761
He went to the cross, nobly.
You know why?

306
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,598
To make a statement.

307
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,967
To make a statement, as must we.

308
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,678
But Christ lost.

309
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,597
- You, I think...
- No, sir, he did not.

310
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:54,401
- You want to win, don't you?
- Yes.

311
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:58,998
I certainly do. Hell, sometimes
I don't get paid unless I do.

312
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:02,523
Which brings us back to
the question of worth.

313
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:06,037
In order to do a better job
than the Son of God's attorney

314
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:09,762
I'll require two and a
half dollars a day.

315
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,841
(Mende) Who are they, do you think?

316
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,845
Looks like they're going to be sick.

317
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:38,046
(All) # Amazing grace

318
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:40,516
# How sweet the sound... #

319
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,842
(Mende) They're entertainers!

320
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:48,117
- # That saved a wretch like me... #
- But why do they look so miserable?

321
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:53,561
# I once was lost

322
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:58,203
# But now am found... #

323
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:10,163
(Mende) You don't belong here.

324
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:13,085
Your table doesn't belong here.

325
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:23,319
(Mende) This is Temne land.

326
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:30,796
How do you do, sir? How do you do?

327
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:34,044
(Mende) You want to sit?
Sit here in Mendeland.

328
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:36,443
What are you doing, Temne?

329
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:41,045
You want trouble?
Cross into our territory again.

330
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:44,637
What is this?
Get this table out of here!

331
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:47,645
Let me show you to Sherbroland.

332
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,598
(Arguing)

333
00:35:58,327 --> 00:36:00,238
There?

334
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,843
(Speaks menacingly in Mende)

335
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:28,081
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

336
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,083
Excuse me. I...
My name is Roger Baldwin.

337
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:35,437
This is Theodore Joadson
of the Anti-slavery Society

338
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:38,445
and owner of the Forten
Shipping Service.

339
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:42,082
And this is Professor Gibbs,
a linguist.

340
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:45,038
(Mende) What do you want?

341
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:47,760
Keep talking. Get them to talk.

342
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:51,037
Have you seen this before?

343
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:55,399
(Mende) I could kill you with my bare
hands before you raise that sword.

344
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:58,519
- This belongs to you?
- (Makes slashing sounds)

345
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,996
(Gibbs makes slashing sound)

346
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,998
No.

347
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:07,399
Umm...

348
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:10,280
I need to know where you're from.

349
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,682
(Gibbs) Uh...
(Speaks African dialect)

350
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:19,278
(Mende) What did he say?

351
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:23,123
(Mende) I didn't understand a word.
It's gibberish.

352
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,635
He said, I think, "Show me the map."

353
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:28,155
(Mende) Do you think
he's here to help us?

354
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,686
I don't know.

355
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:32,366
He reminds me of that Fula of Baoma.

356
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:37,720
The one who hires himself out to
scrape elephant dung from the crops.

357
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:43,320
A dung-scraper might be just the kind
of man we need right now.

358
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:46,759
(Baldwin) Here, Africa...
Is this where you're from?

359
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,957
A-fri-ca.

360
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:52,361
(Mende) What does he want?

361
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:56,362
- (Mende) He's an idiot.
- Were you born in the West Indies?

362
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,285
(Spanish)
Were you born in the West Indies?

363
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:04,766
(Mende) All three of them are idiots.

364
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:06,923
What did he say?

365
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:11,763
Oh, he said, er...
They have to go away.

366
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:18,963
- (Shouting)
- Emancipation! It's God's way!

367
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,925
You cannot own another human being!

368
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,800
- Killers of white men!
- Slavery is tyranny!

369
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,481
(Mende) It's those miserable-looking
people again.

370
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:35,756
God's blessing on you this morning.

371
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:38,765
(Mende) I'm not afraid of you,
or your medicine!

372
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:43,881
Yes. You place your hand on
this book and I'll pray for you.

373
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:48,757
(Woman in crowd) They're
human beings, not animals!

374
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:51,082
(Man) Slavery will kill this country!

375
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:53,038
(Slaves chatter)

376
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:58,195
(Holabird) ..in the
quietude of the night

377
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:03,367
after the Spaniards attended their
vespers and were in virtuous sleep,

378
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:08,363
the savages broke loose
their collars,

379
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:12,320
and stole onto the deck
like creatures of prey.

380
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:16,440
They fell upon the unsuspecting crew
with these sabres and cane knives...

381
00:39:16,527 --> 00:39:20,839
- (Gasps from gallery)
- I cannot overstate...

382
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:23,276
(Mende) Have you
figured out who he is?

383
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:29,005
(Mende) An advisor of some kind.
Perhaps theirs.

384
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:30,275
..they mutilated at least one...

385
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:34,115
- (Mende) What about him?
- The simple cook, a Creole...

386
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:37,159
- Their own kind.
- (Mende) Theirs maybe.

387
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,437
But for Senors Ruiz and Montes,

388
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,160
who steered the Amistad
to these shores

389
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:44,880
under constant threat of like fate,

390
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:48,761
we might never have heard of
this massacre, this bloodbath.

391
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:53,483
But for their bravery, these villains
would have escaped justice.

392
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:56,405
But they've not. They've not.

393
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:02,996
(Mende) And Dung-Scraper?

394
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:07,363
I have a horrible feeling
he talks for us.

395
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:10,003
(Whispering)

396
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:25,160
Do you know the difference
between a cow and a cabbage?

397
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,443
A brick and a bear?

398
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:33,843
Or how about...
a polecat and a president?

399
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:40,598
The Spanish government hopes you
don't have much more sense than that.

400
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,719
This case isn't about murder,
mayhem or massacres.

401
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:46,162
It's not about anything
that dramatic.

402
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:51,565
This case is about knowing the
difference between here and there.

403
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:57,396
I want to show you something.

404
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,323
(Prisoners protest)

405
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:09,119
Open your mouth.

406
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,204
He doesn't understand.
He doesn't speak English.

407
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:14,124
Abra su boca.

408
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,044
(Replies in Mende)

409
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:20,842
Doesn't he understand? I thought
he was born on a Cuban plantation?

410
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:23,082
Perhaps he simply doesn't like you.

411
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:26,005
He wouldn't be the first,
Mr Holabird.

412
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:37,196
(Laughs) Yes.

413
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:43,121
What, did he learn this on some Cuban
plantation, this decorative effect?

414
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,678
(Muttering) Cuban plantation!

415
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:53,839
Stand up. Stand up!

416
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:56,879
Hey. Levantate.

417
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:00,278
Levantate.

418
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:03,165
- (Protests)
- Levantate.

419
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:06,038
(Sighs)

420
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:16,485
- Stand up.
- (All) Ahh!

421
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:19,678
Thank you.

422
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:23,601
Your Honour, I speak more Spanish,
and I was born in Philadelphia.

423
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:26,719
On Spanish plantations,
slaves choose to live

424
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:29,918
surrounded by their own ways
and simple languages.

425
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:34,518
Pray tell, what need they know
of Spanish? "Fetch? Carry? Stop?"

426
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:38,606
Gestures suffice for slaves,
as for any other beast of burden.

427
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,278
Your Honour...

428
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:45,718
I represent the interests
of Senors Ruiz and Montes.

429
00:42:45,767 --> 00:42:48,235
- I remember.
- I have a bill of sale,

430
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:51,165
issued in Havana
for the purchase of slaves.

431
00:42:51,207 --> 00:42:53,118
I remember that too.

432
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:57,479
On it, in addition to the amounts
paid for each, are their names.

433
00:42:57,527 --> 00:43:02,157
Jose, Bernardo...
Paco and so on.

434
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:06,678
On behalf of my clients, I submit
this document to the court.

435
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:19,005
Mr Baldwin, you've proffered
a good deal of - I'll be kind -

436
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:21,163
circumstantial evidence.

437
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:25,678
Have you, in addition, anything, in
the order of actual documentation,

438
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:27,558
that might refute this one,

439
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:30,485
and so more compellingly
support your claims?

440
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:35,123
I'm sure I could manufacture some
as easily as they have, Your Honour.

441
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:37,442
What you're saying is,
then, you don't.

442
00:43:37,487 --> 00:43:39,398
Is that correct?

443
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,678
I have them.

444
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:52,675
I'm afraid that does not impress me.

445
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,717
I thought you did quite well.

446
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:06,638
You do?

447
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,402
Much better than I expected,
to be honest.

448
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:12,557
Well, thank you, I think.

449
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:15,599
Although, I was concerned that
you might have forgotten

450
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:19,805
- this is just a case like any other.
- You needn't worry about that.

451
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:21,798
That's good.

452
00:44:21,847 --> 00:44:24,122
(Prisoner speaks menacingly)

453
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:43,403
Hello, Cinque.
My name is Roger Baldwin.

454
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,358
I'll be your attorney.

455
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:02,486
Yes. (Clears throat) Thank you.

456
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:06,039
(Clears throat)

457
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:13,678
All right.

458
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:20,680
I need to prove where you're from.

459
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:23,844
(Cinque, in Mende) You want
to show them where we're from.

460
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,526
How are you supposed to tell me?

461
00:45:31,927 --> 00:45:35,761
(Mende) How can I explain
to you where we're from?

462
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:41,400
(Both talk at once)

463
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:46,601
- (Baldwin) You go.
- (Cinque) I'm sorry, you talk first.

464
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:03,075
Here. This is where I'm from.

465
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,004
Here. This.

466
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:09,245
All of this. All of this is...

467
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:11,795
- is...my home.
- (Mende) That's here.

468
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,438
Here.

469
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:23,482
Cuba. Cuba's an island.

470
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,481
The Amistad. This is where...
where you...

471
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,446
where everyone...was killed.

472
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:43,802
Here. Cuba, the Amistad.

473
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:47,237
Now, Cuba...Is this your home?
I don't think so.

474
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:49,198
But...Excuse me.

475
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:54,958
Now...

476
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,318
Africa.

477
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:05,285
This is your home, isn't it?

478
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:08,842
This...is...your home.

479
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,758
Yes?

480
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,156
You came...

481
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:15,084
all the way...

482
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:17,038
from...here.

483
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:48,637
(Cinque, in Mende)
This...is how far I've come.

484
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:03,523
(Arguing in Spanish)

485
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:14,805
(Man) Secure the ballast, transport!

486
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:22,163
Put your backs into it, boys.

487
00:48:22,207 --> 00:48:26,678
This is a court order granting us
permission to search this vessel.

488
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:29,082
- What did they want?
- To come aboard.

489
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:33,166
I informed them they needed to obtain
one of these...an authentic one.

490
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:43,438
Aren't you coming?

491
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,398
(Arguing continues)

492
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,443
(Man, distant) Heave-ho!

493
00:50:56,607 --> 00:50:59,075
(Gasping) My light! Light...?

494
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:01,796
Light the lamp, Mr Baldwin.

495
00:51:01,887 --> 00:51:03,798
I'm trying.

496
00:51:07,007 --> 00:51:08,918
(Grunts)

497
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,118
Mr Joadson!

498
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:14,158
Here.

499
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:20,358
Are you all right?

500
00:51:24,087 --> 00:51:25,998
(Panting) Yes.

501
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:34,998
(Grunts)

502
00:52:04,007 --> 00:52:07,158
These papers - and I shall
ask you to examine them -

503
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:12,440
are portions of a ship's manifest I
retrieved from the Amistad yesterday.

504
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:16,799
At first glance, they may appear
to bolster the prosecution's case.

505
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,963
You see, they list cargo.

506
00:52:20,407 --> 00:52:24,366
Cargo bearing the very Spanish names
Messrs Ruiz and Montes

507
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,762
insist represent my clients,

508
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:30,275
hand-scrawled in the margins.

509
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:35,682
But no, this is not the manifest
of the Amistad at all. Look.

510
00:52:35,727 --> 00:52:40,482
This is part of the cargo manifest
of a Portuguese vessel,

511
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:44,281
the notorious transatlantic
slave ship the Tecora.

512
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:46,164
The Tecora.

513
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,118
(Disgruntled murmuring)

514
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:52,240
I can bring you as many witnesses
as you wish, Mr Holabird...

515
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:53,959
Tecora!

516
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:57,795
Their clients trade primarily off
the coast of West Africa.

517
00:52:57,847 --> 00:52:59,838
The Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone.

518
00:52:59,887 --> 00:53:02,003
I know what you're thinking.

519
00:53:02,047 --> 00:53:05,357
Sierra Leone is a protectorate
of the British Crown.

520
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,318
Slavery is outlawed there.

521
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:10,803
Its principal port, in fact,
has been re-christened "Freetown".

522
00:53:10,847 --> 00:53:13,566
How, then, can the
Portuguese Tecora...

523
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,565
engage in the slave trades
in these waters?

524
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:20,083
I'll tell you how. In a word...

525
00:53:22,087 --> 00:53:23,805
Illegally.

526
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:28,679
Whatever these men say
clearly matters not

527
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:31,195
because this proves them liars.

528
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:33,841
My clients' journey
did not begin in Havana,

529
00:53:33,887 --> 00:53:37,163
as they keep claiming more
and more emphatically.

530
00:53:37,207 --> 00:53:38,720
No, my clients' journey...

531
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,882
began much, much further away.

532
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,245
I underestimated you, sir! (Laughs)

533
00:54:00,607 --> 00:54:02,518
I really did!

534
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:06,401
- I should take that as a compliment.
- Oh, you should indeed, sir.

535
00:54:06,447 --> 00:54:10,838
I can't imagine there's no not
reaching a favourable conclusion...

536
00:54:11,487 --> 00:54:13,364
Hey! Hey!

537
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:16,878
A-Am I bleeding?

538
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:20,443
There's nothing there.

539
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:24,363
What did I do to deserve this?

540
00:54:24,447 --> 00:54:27,120
You took the case, Mr Baldwin.

541
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:29,842
You took the case, sir.

542
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:32,880
I should take that as a compliment.

543
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:35,683
"As you may perceive,

544
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:37,718
"I wish you to act promptly

545
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:41,919
"before this matter becomes
a weight on our two countries."

546
00:54:42,007 --> 00:54:43,918
Uh, "great countries."

547
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:46,077
"Our great countries.

548
00:54:46,127 --> 00:54:49,802
"After all, the business of
great countries is to do business."

549
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:51,758
Excelente, Su Alteza.

550
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:54,879
"Slavery is our pillar of
commerce in the New World.

551
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:59,443
"Without it, our goodwill
and excellent trade relations sh..."

552
00:54:59,487 --> 00:55:02,604
- Uh, "should be imperilled."
- "Should be imperilled.

553
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:05,844
"Without it, we might
have been denied the glory

554
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:09,084
"of aiding you in your rebellion
against the British.

555
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:13,245
"As slave-owning nations,
we must together stand firm.

556
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:18,321
"Speak the words of humaneness
for the masses of your citizens,

557
00:55:18,367 --> 00:55:21,996
"but hold tightly to the power
that protects them.

558
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:24,726
"That power, of course,
is their wealth.

559
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:28,123
"The Africans must never go free.

560
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:30,681
"With sincerest admiration,

561
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:34,276
"Isabella the Second,
Queen of all of Spain."

562
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:39,196
I am not about to bend to the will
of some pubescent queen.

563
00:55:39,247 --> 00:55:42,319
Forget about them.
They're unimportant.

564
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:44,927
- Prepubescent.
- You need to concern yourself

565
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:47,840
with what this matter means here,
not an ocean away.

566
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,764
Someone would tell me what it means!

567
00:55:49,807 --> 00:55:52,958
Leder, you yourself
said it was meaningless.

568
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:55,123
Well, not any more.

569
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,558
(Sighs)

570
00:55:57,607 --> 00:56:01,043
- John Calhoun paid me a visit.
- Oh, God.

571
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:05,040
To explain to me why this case
is of much greater import...

572
00:56:05,127 --> 00:56:09,279
- much greater symbolism, to use his
word - to the South than the North.

573
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:11,602
If the Africans are executed,

574
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:14,719
the abolitionists will
make good use of it.

575
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:17,201
And yes, they will make
some converts.

576
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:19,522
If, on the other hand,
they are freed,

577
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:24,004
Calhoun says the Southern states
will so ally themselves against you

578
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,356
that you can forget
about re-election.

579
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:30,639
- (Tuts) Over this?
- It's worse than that.

580
00:56:30,727 --> 00:56:32,957
Worse? What could be
worse than that?

581
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:36,397
Calhoun believes, and I am not sure
I can disagree with him,

582
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:40,838
that this could take us all
one long step closer to civil war.

583
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:44,283
- This?
- Yes, Mr President.

584
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:47,046
But all is not lost.

585
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:50,841
The jury appears likely to free them,
but juries can be dismissed.

586
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:55,762
They can?

587
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:59,601
But I believe we must go further
and remove the judge.

588
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,558
(Van Buren) We can do that?

589
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:06,598
(Leder) He could be prevailed upon to
recuse himself for various reasons.

590
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:08,365
With that in mind,

591
00:57:08,407 --> 00:57:11,444
I've taken the liberty of
exploring possible replacements.

592
00:57:11,487 --> 00:57:15,002
I've found one I strongly
believe to be better.

593
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:20,159
He's young, which means he has a
career before him rather than behind,

594
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:22,323
he has yet to feel the hankering

595
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:25,677
for magnanimous last gestures
for the sake of posterity.

596
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:28,201
And he is monumentally insecure,

597
00:57:28,247 --> 00:57:31,717
particularly about
his Catholic heritage.

598
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:34,884
- He's Catholic?
- His grandfather was Catholic,

599
00:57:34,927 --> 00:57:39,079
which young Mr Coglin has striven
all his days to keep quiet.

600
00:57:39,127 --> 00:57:41,038
(Man) Mr President, Judge Coglin.

601
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:44,159
(Van Buren) Judge Coglin,
we are so pleased to meet you.

602
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:45,799
Thank you so much for coming.

603
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:09,117
I've been reading in the papers

604
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:13,877
the continuing saga
of the, uh, Amistad.

605
00:58:13,967 --> 00:58:15,798
Real papers.

606
00:58:15,887 --> 00:58:18,765
(Chuckles) Real papers. Yes, sir.

607
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:24,997
(Tuts) Yes. Bad luck,
this last unfolding chapter.

608
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:27,402
What to do now, eh?

609
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:30,723
Which is why I came here
and imposed on you, sir.

610
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:33,645
No imposition...really.

611
00:58:34,727 --> 00:58:36,638
(Sighs) Yeah.

612
00:58:39,207 --> 00:58:41,767
How did that, uh...

613
00:58:41,847 --> 00:58:45,157
How did that young lawyer
take the news?

614
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:47,966
Oh, in stride, sir. In stride.

615
00:58:48,047 --> 00:58:52,165
The thing is, sir,
he did everything right.

616
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:54,442
- He proved the case.
- Did he?

617
00:58:54,527 --> 00:58:57,041
Oh, yes, sir. Surprisingly, he did.

618
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:59,920
Hmm. Good.

619
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:02,760
Well, he'll just have
to do it again, then.

620
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:06,436
But like most things, it should
be easier second time around.

621
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:10,446
Well, I'm afraid it doesn't matter
what he does now, sir.

622
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:14,440
Rumour has it our next judge
was hand-picked by Van Buren himself.

623
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:16,398
No!

624
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:22,360
I'm embarrassed to admit that
I was under the misconception

625
00:59:22,407 --> 00:59:25,877
that our executive
and judicial branches were separate.

626
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:28,680
No more so than these, Mr Joadson.

627
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:31,558
No more so than these.

628
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:37,280
- So now you know.
- Yes.

629
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:39,204
- Sir?
- Yeah?

630
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:42,284
Mr President, if it was you
handling the case...

631
00:59:42,327 --> 00:59:45,000
Well, it isn't me.
And thank God for that.

632
00:59:45,047 --> 00:59:46,958
(Rings bell)

633
00:59:47,807 --> 00:59:50,719
- But if it was, sir,
- Huh?

634
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:52,678
What would you do?

635
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:03,358
Well, when I was an attorney,

636
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:06,757
a long time ago, young man,

637
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:11,079
I, er, I realised
after much trial and error,

638
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:13,761
that in a courtroom,

639
01:00:13,807 --> 01:00:17,482
whoever tells
the best story wins.

640
01:00:19,087 --> 01:00:24,366
In unlawyer-like fashion, I give you
that scrap of wisdom free of charge.

641
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,562
I'm much obliged
for your time, sir.

642
01:00:33,007 --> 01:00:36,044
What is their story,
by the way?

643
01:00:37,807 --> 01:00:41,561
- Sir?
- What is their story?

644
01:00:43,247 --> 01:00:45,807
Why, they're, um,...

645
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:50,398
from West Africa.

646
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:54,122
No. What is their story?

647
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:06,405
Mr Joadson, you're
from where originally?

648
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:09,126
Why, Georgia, sir.

649
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,277
- Georgia.
- Yes, sir.

650
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,403
Does that sum up what you are?

651
01:01:13,487 --> 01:01:17,036
A Georgian? Is that your story?

652
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:20,557
No. You're an ex-slave,

653
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:23,440
who's devoted his life
to the abolition of slavery,

654
01:01:23,487 --> 01:01:28,242
and overcoming great hardships
along the way, I should imagine.

655
01:01:28,287 --> 01:01:31,085
That's your story, isn't it?

656
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:40,165
(Laughs)

657
01:01:40,207 --> 01:01:42,846
You and this young so-called lawyer

658
01:01:42,887 --> 01:01:45,082
have proven you know what they are.

659
01:01:45,127 --> 01:01:47,925
They're Africans. Congratulations.

660
01:01:48,007 --> 01:01:53,206
What you don't know, and haven't
bothered in the least to discover,

661
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:55,078
is who they are.

662
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,798
Right?

663
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:16,039
Seven. (Translates into Mende)

664
01:02:16,127 --> 01:02:18,925
Eight. (Continues translating)

665
01:02:20,287 --> 01:02:22,403
Number nine...

666
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,324
and ten.

667
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:27,518
Now, how about you, Mr Baldwin?

668
01:02:27,607 --> 01:02:30,075
Would you like to count
from one to ten?

669
01:02:30,127 --> 01:02:32,402
One to ten in Mende.

670
01:02:33,567 --> 01:02:35,876
- One.
- Ta.

671
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:37,804
- Two.
- Fele.

672
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,957
- Three.
- Sawa.

673
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:43,039
- Four.
- Nanee.

674
01:02:43,207 --> 01:02:45,038
Right. Five.

675
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:46,998
Lorlu.

676
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:50,801
(Joadson speaks in Mende)

677
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:53,718
(Laughs)

678
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:57,838
(Counts in Mende)

679
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:05,476
(Trader) Fresh fruit!
Straight from the Caribbean!

680
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:07,643
(Attempts to speak Mende)

681
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:16,245
(Counts in Mende)

682
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:23,157
- (Baldwin) Sawa, nanee, lorlu...
- (Soldiers laugh)

683
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:25,323
(Continues to count in Mende)

684
01:03:48,647 --> 01:03:50,763
(Mournful groaning)

685
01:03:56,327 --> 01:03:58,557
(Mende)

686
01:04:04,247 --> 01:04:07,080
(Chanting)

687
01:04:28,207 --> 01:04:31,995
- What's happened here?
- One of them died last night.

688
01:04:32,047 --> 01:04:34,880
We tried to take the body
away to bury it.

689
01:04:34,927 --> 01:04:37,441
What do they want?
They want to live with it?

690
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:41,317
(Chanting intensifies)

691
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:55,044
They want to bury him.

692
01:04:55,087 --> 01:04:58,284
They have to bury him
according to their poro beliefs.

693
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,557
Otherwise, his soul
will haunt them.

694
01:05:09,527 --> 01:05:13,679
# The house of Thine abode

695
01:05:13,767 --> 01:05:18,477
# With His own precious son... #

696
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:21,365
(Singing and chanting)

697
01:05:25,127 --> 01:05:28,005
# The house of Thine abode

698
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:31,124
# The church of
blessed redeemers... #

699
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:33,721
If I were you, if I ran this place,

700
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:37,965
I'd set protocol aside just
this once and let them bury him.

701
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:41,926
# I love Thy kingdom, Lord... #

702
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:44,805
I was thinking the same thing.

703
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:03,038
(Prisoners shout)

704
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:39,917
(Mende) My name is Kai Nyagua...
and James Covey.

705
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:44,166
I speak Mende and English,
his language.

706
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:49,236
You and he will talk
to each other through me.

707
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:54,956
- The clothes?
- And the names.

708
01:06:55,007 --> 01:06:57,919
I was rescued off a slave ship
by the British Navy.

709
01:06:57,967 --> 01:07:00,356
I never went back.

710
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:08,281
- (Baldwin) A problem has arisen.
- (Translates)

711
01:07:08,367 --> 01:07:10,961
The judge we had,
who believed, I believe,

712
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:14,795
that you should be freed,
has been dismissed.

713
01:07:14,847 --> 01:07:18,317
A new judge has been called upon
to hear the case,

714
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,164
this time without a jury.

715
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:22,243
(Translates)

716
01:07:29,727 --> 01:07:33,003
How is that possible?
A chief cannot be replaced.

717
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:36,403
I can't explain it in any way
that you would understand, Cinque.

718
01:07:36,447 --> 01:07:40,360
Or me, for that matter.
Only that, well, it has happened.

719
01:07:40,407 --> 01:07:42,796
(Translates)

720
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:51,477
I am not a great orator
or advisor, Cinque.

721
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,127
I'm not a big man in my profession.

722
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:59,161
I don't know if I alone can convince
this next judge to set you free.

723
01:08:00,087 --> 01:08:02,203
I need your help.

724
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:07,045
When we go to court,
I need you to speak.

725
01:08:11,207 --> 01:08:13,038
(Speaks Mende)

726
01:08:14,087 --> 01:08:17,204
(Covey) I'm not
an advisor of any kind.

727
01:08:17,247 --> 01:08:19,556
I cannot speak for the others.

728
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:21,916
Cinque, the others, they say you can.

729
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:25,277
They say you're the big man here.

730
01:08:25,327 --> 01:08:29,081
- (Whispers reply)
- (Covey) I am not.

731
01:08:34,807 --> 01:08:36,923
What's this I hear about a lion?

732
01:08:36,967 --> 01:08:39,925
(Covey translates)

733
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:43,363
They say you alone - alone, Cinque -

734
01:08:43,407 --> 01:08:46,877
slew the most terrifying beast
anyone has ever seen.

735
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:48,997
Is it not true?

736
01:09:31,247 --> 01:09:34,000
(Covey)
It had killed several people.

737
01:09:36,367 --> 01:09:39,040
Even hunters among us.

738
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:41,847
Everyone including me was afraid.

739
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:46,686
I was lying down with my family,

740
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:49,201
when out of nowhere it appeared.

741
01:09:49,287 --> 01:09:51,278
As it came for me

742
01:09:52,207 --> 01:09:55,563
I picked up this big rock
and I threw it.

743
01:09:59,527 --> 01:10:04,078
And by some miracle,
you see, I hit it.

744
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:10,080
He don't know how
that killed it, but it did.

745
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:16,480
(Chuckles) A rock.

746
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,918
A rock.

747
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:38,723
(Speaks Mende)

748
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:45,917
(Covey) I received the gratitude
of everyone in the village.

749
01:10:50,047 --> 01:10:52,356
I was given respect.

750
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:57,925
They treated me
as if I was a prince.

751
01:11:01,847 --> 01:11:04,680
They gave me
the fine country cloth.

752
01:11:14,207 --> 01:11:17,165
All these things they gave me,
I took them all.

753
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:24,201
But I knew
I didn't deserve it.

754
01:11:29,887 --> 01:11:34,563
For when I threw that rock at
that beast...if I had missed him...

755
01:11:34,607 --> 01:11:38,236
He said he wouldn't be here
trying to explain these things.

756
01:11:38,287 --> 01:11:39,879
He'd just be dead.

757
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,798
Understand?

758
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:54,238
Understand?

759
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:10,118
I'm not a big man.

760
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,838
Just a lucky one.

761
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:26,845
I might agree with you, Cinque,
except you're forgetting something.

762
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:29,361
(Covey translates)

763
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,398
The other lion.

764
01:12:36,567 --> 01:12:39,001
The Amistad, Cinque.
The insurrection.

765
01:12:39,047 --> 01:12:41,607
That too was an accident?
I hardly think so.

766
01:12:41,647 --> 01:12:43,558
(Translates)

767
01:12:47,607 --> 01:12:49,518
That wasn't bravery.

768
01:12:56,087 --> 01:12:59,443
Any man would do the same
to get back to his family.

769
01:12:59,527 --> 01:13:01,597
You yourself would do it.

770
01:13:12,407 --> 01:13:14,716
Someone said that might be yours.

771
01:13:15,287 --> 01:13:16,879
(Covey translates)

772
01:13:19,887 --> 01:13:22,162
'(Covey translates)
My wife gave it to me.'

773
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:32,923
'To keep me safe.'

774
01:13:33,687 --> 01:13:35,996
Cinque...

775
01:13:36,087 --> 01:13:38,999
I need you to tell me
how you got here.

776
01:13:39,087 --> 01:13:40,998
(Covey translates)

777
01:13:50,327 --> 01:13:52,443
(Chattering)

778
01:13:56,927 --> 01:13:58,838
(Cinque shouts)

779
01:14:10,687 --> 01:14:12,962
I'll hit you in the head again
if you talk.

780
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:15,646
I'll share the profit
of my harvest. I'll...

781
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:07,558
(Shouting in Spanish)

782
01:15:12,447 --> 01:15:14,836
(Speaking Spanish)

783
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:42,798
(Shouting in Spanish)

784
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:56,483
(Screaming and yelling)

785
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:06,923
(Sobbing)

786
01:16:09,967 --> 01:16:11,878
(Thunder)

787
01:16:34,447 --> 01:16:36,358
(Baby cries)

788
01:17:12,167 --> 01:17:14,078
(Anguished cries)

789
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:25,718
(Sailors chatter)

790
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:53,478
(Whip cracking)

791
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:07,318
(Whip cracks)

792
01:18:37,807 --> 01:18:39,718
(Shouting)

793
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:55,395
(Spanish) This one's sick,
don't give him any!

794
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:05,278
(Spanish) Her!

795
01:19:05,327 --> 01:19:07,238
Not her!

796
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:09,478
Her!

797
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:36,800
Abrala.

798
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:49,918
(Screaming)

799
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:14,205
(Woman Screams)

800
01:20:32,247 --> 01:20:34,158
(Shouting in Spanish)

801
01:20:46,447 --> 01:20:48,324
(Speaking Spanish)

802
01:21:33,007 --> 01:21:35,521
(Chattering in Spanish)

803
01:21:57,407 --> 01:21:59,967
Negro Bernardo.

804
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:01,998
Bernardo.

805
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:05,158
Abajo! Todos abajo!

806
01:22:32,887 --> 01:22:34,923
(Speaks Mende)

807
01:22:37,316 --> 01:22:39,830
(Covey) I wanted to kill them too.

808
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:41,912
(Cinque, in Mende)

809
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:46,472
For they convinced some of us
that they would take us back home.

810
01:22:52,236 --> 01:22:54,147
Thank you, sir.

811
01:23:01,396 --> 01:23:02,829
Mr Holabird.

812
01:23:08,356 --> 01:23:10,267
Quite a tale.

813
01:23:10,316 --> 01:23:12,546
Intrigue, abduction,

814
01:23:12,596 --> 01:23:15,668
courage in the face
of unspeakable suffering.

815
01:23:15,716 --> 01:23:19,152
And all true. All right.
Now tell me if this is true.

816
01:23:19,196 --> 01:23:23,587
Some tribes in Africa, for hundreds
of years - thousands, perhaps -

817
01:23:23,636 --> 01:23:25,547
have owned slaves.

818
01:23:28,716 --> 01:23:30,627
Translate.

819
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:32,872
(Covey translates)

820
01:23:37,796 --> 01:23:38,945
Yes.

821
01:23:38,996 --> 01:23:43,069
Under what circumstances might one
become a slave among the Mende,

822
01:23:43,116 --> 01:23:45,266
of which you claim to belong?

823
01:23:46,596 --> 01:23:48,507
Translate.

824
01:23:48,716 --> 01:23:50,786
(Covey translates)

825
01:23:56,556 --> 01:23:58,706
Wars, debts.

826
01:23:58,756 --> 01:24:02,908
Oh, I see. And how many men
are indebted to you ?

827
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:05,072
(Covey) I don't think you do see.

828
01:24:05,116 --> 01:24:07,949
Mr Holabird is trying
to intimidate my colleague.

829
01:24:07,996 --> 01:24:10,715
The Mende word for "slave"
is closer to "worker".

830
01:24:10,756 --> 01:24:14,988
Do these workers own the land
they work on? Do they receive wages?

831
01:24:15,036 --> 01:24:18,585
Are these workers free to not work
for you, if they so choose?

832
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:20,547
He's questioning the translator!

833
01:24:20,596 --> 01:24:23,235
The translator is answering
for the witness.

834
01:24:23,276 --> 01:24:26,348
- The witness isn't getting a chance!
- Mr Baldwin!

835
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:31,072
Fine, Mr Baldwin! Slavery,
indentured servitude.

836
01:24:31,116 --> 01:24:34,904
Whatever they want to call it,
the concept is the same.

837
01:24:34,956 --> 01:24:37,789
Now, he is familiar with the concept.

838
01:24:37,836 --> 01:24:41,988
When you come down to it,
it's all about money, isn't it?

839
01:24:42,036 --> 01:24:45,233
Slaves, production, money.
I mean, that's the idea of it.

840
01:24:45,276 --> 01:24:48,154
Whether it's here or there.
I'm confused.

841
01:24:50,356 --> 01:24:55,066
Do your people routinely
slaughter their slaves

842
01:24:55,116 --> 01:24:58,631
in the manner that you just
so vividly described to us?

843
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,826
(Covey translates)

844
01:25:00,876 --> 01:25:05,074
Of course they don't.
What would be the point of that?

845
01:25:05,116 --> 01:25:10,236
Killing your own slaves is like
burning down your own house or hut,

846
01:25:10,276 --> 01:25:12,187
isn't it?

847
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:15,671
How do you explain that paradox?

848
01:25:15,716 --> 01:25:17,627
(Translates)

849
01:25:21,036 --> 01:25:23,834
I don't understand what you mean.

850
01:25:23,876 --> 01:25:26,868
Sure you do.
As does everyone here.

851
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:31,706
The behaviour you attribute to
your tormentors - your victims -

852
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:35,192
and therefore every other
aspect of your testimony,

853
01:25:35,236 --> 01:25:38,308
makes no sense.

854
01:25:39,636 --> 01:25:42,150
- Not even to you.
- (Covey translates)

855
01:25:42,196 --> 01:25:46,474
But thank you. Like all good works
of fiction, it was entertaining.

856
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:48,427
Nothing more.

857
01:25:48,596 --> 01:25:51,508
(Speaks Mende, angrily)

858
01:25:58,556 --> 01:26:00,467
(Baldwin) Captain Fitzgerald,

859
01:26:00,516 --> 01:26:03,314
please explain your duties
in Her Majesty's navy.

860
01:26:03,356 --> 01:26:06,154
To patrol the Ivory Coast
for slave ships.

861
01:26:06,236 --> 01:26:08,067
Because?

862
01:26:08,116 --> 01:26:11,631
Because slavery is banned
in British law, sir.

863
01:26:11,676 --> 01:26:15,715
Yet the abduction of men from the
British protectorate of Sierra Leone

864
01:26:15,756 --> 01:26:19,305
and their illegal transportation
as described by Cinque,

865
01:26:19,356 --> 01:26:23,065
- is not unheard of, is it?
- Not even unusual, regrettably.

866
01:26:23,116 --> 01:26:28,236
What, if anything, in his account of
his ordeal, do you find believable?

867
01:26:29,196 --> 01:26:33,348
His description of the slave
fortress, for one thing.

868
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:35,352
There is such a place.

869
01:26:35,396 --> 01:26:37,785
You've seen it?

870
01:26:37,836 --> 01:26:40,111
No, sir. We've not
managed to locate it,

871
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:43,108
but there is overwhelming
evidence that it is real.

872
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:46,034
What evidence, exactly? Rumour?

873
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:48,827
Reports.

874
01:26:49,236 --> 01:26:53,514
By "reports" you mean of the variety
Cinque shared with us today?

875
01:26:53,556 --> 01:26:57,947
Its existence, sir,
has been reported.

876
01:26:57,996 --> 01:27:00,635
Cinque describes
the cold-blooded murder

877
01:27:00,676 --> 01:27:03,270
of many of the people
on board the Tecora.

878
01:27:03,316 --> 01:27:06,592
Mr Holabird sees this as a paradox.
Do you, sir?

879
01:27:06,636 --> 01:27:11,187
Often when slavers are intercepted,
or believe they may be,

880
01:27:11,236 --> 01:27:14,034
they simply throw all
their prisoners overboard

881
01:27:14,116 --> 01:27:17,188
and thereby rid themselves
of the evidence of their crime.

882
01:27:17,236 --> 01:27:21,707
- Drown hundreds of people?
- Yes.

883
01:27:21,756 --> 01:27:24,828
It hardly seems a lucrative
business to me,

884
01:27:24,876 --> 01:27:29,552
going to all that trouble rounding
men up only to throw them overboard.

885
01:27:29,596 --> 01:27:31,587
No, it's very lucrative.

886
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:36,395
If only we could corroborate
Cinque's story somehow with...

887
01:27:38,316 --> 01:27:40,466
with evidence of some kind.

888
01:27:40,556 --> 01:27:42,512
The inventory.

889
01:27:46,956 --> 01:27:49,868
This? From the Tecora?

890
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:53,352
If you look, there's
a notation made on May 10,

891
01:27:53,396 --> 01:27:57,548
correcting the number of slaves on
board, reducing their number by 50.

892
01:27:57,636 --> 01:27:59,706
(Baldwin) What does that mean?

893
01:27:59,756 --> 01:28:03,226
If you look at it in conjunction
with Cinque's testimony,

894
01:28:03,276 --> 01:28:05,232
I would say that it means this:

895
01:28:05,316 --> 01:28:07,591
The crew greatly underestimated

896
01:28:07,636 --> 01:28:10,833
the amount of provisions
required for their journey,

897
01:28:10,876 --> 01:28:13,834
and solved the problem
by throwing 50 people overboard.

898
01:29:00,516 --> 01:29:02,984
I'm looking at
the inventory, Captain,

899
01:29:03,036 --> 01:29:06,187
and I'm sorry, I don't
see where it says,

900
01:29:06,236 --> 01:29:08,875
"This morning, we threw
50 slaves overboard."

901
01:29:08,956 --> 01:29:10,912
On May 10 or any other day.

902
01:29:10,996 --> 01:29:13,351
As of course you would not.

903
01:29:25,836 --> 01:29:29,112
I do see that
the cargo weight changed.

904
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:32,466
They reduced the poundage,
I see, but that is all.

905
01:29:47,436 --> 01:29:50,473
It's simple, ghastly arithmetic.

906
01:29:50,516 --> 01:29:53,553
Well, for you, perhaps.

907
01:29:53,636 --> 01:29:57,595
I may need a quill and parchment
and a better imagination.

908
01:29:57,636 --> 01:30:02,312
And what poundage do you imagine
the entry may refer to, sir?

909
01:30:03,076 --> 01:30:05,192
A mast and sails, perhaps?

910
01:30:06,476 --> 01:30:09,673
(Cinque) Give us...us...free.

911
01:30:13,596 --> 01:30:16,429
Give...us...

912
01:30:16,516 --> 01:30:18,507
free.

913
01:30:20,236 --> 01:30:21,464
Give us, us free.

914
01:30:26,316 --> 01:30:30,548
Give...us...free.

915
01:30:31,716 --> 01:30:34,230
Your Honour, please
instruct the defendant

916
01:30:34,316 --> 01:30:36,876
not to disrupt proceedings
with such outbursts.

917
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:39,589
Give us, us free!

918
01:30:40,316 --> 01:30:43,467
If we are to have any semblance
of order in court...

919
01:30:43,516 --> 01:30:47,225
Give us, us free! Give us, us free!

920
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:50,228
He cannot keep crying out
"Give us free"...

921
01:30:50,276 --> 01:30:52,028
Give us, us free!

922
01:30:52,116 --> 01:30:54,505
..while I am questioning
this witness!

923
01:30:54,596 --> 01:30:56,871
GIVE US, US FREE!

924
01:30:58,956 --> 01:31:01,595
GIVE US, US FREE!

925
01:31:59,636 --> 01:32:04,426
(Mende) You don't have to pretend
to be interested in that.

926
01:32:04,916 --> 01:32:07,111
Nobody's watching but me.

927
01:32:08,076 --> 01:32:12,866
I'm not pretending.
I'm beginning to understand it.

928
01:32:26,876 --> 01:32:29,344
Their people have suffered
more than ours.

929
01:32:29,436 --> 01:32:32,314
Their lives were full of suffering.

930
01:32:33,956 --> 01:32:39,314
Then he was born
and everything changed.

931
01:32:46,476 --> 01:32:48,353
Who is he?

932
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:53,345
I don't know, but everywhere he goes
he is followed by the sun.

933
01:33:01,716 --> 01:33:05,231
Here he is healing people
with his hands.

934
01:33:10,716 --> 01:33:12,627
Protecting them...

935
01:33:18,076 --> 01:33:20,067
Being given children...

936
01:33:29,276 --> 01:33:31,187
What's this?

937
01:33:31,596 --> 01:33:34,588
He could also walk across the sea.

938
01:33:40,396 --> 01:33:43,035
But then something happened.

939
01:33:44,476 --> 01:33:48,628
He was captured.
Accused of some crime.

940
01:33:48,996 --> 01:33:51,874
Here he is with his hands tied.

941
01:33:55,876 --> 01:34:00,825
- He must have done something.
- Why? What did we do?

942
01:34:01,356 --> 01:34:03,267
Whatever it was,

943
01:34:05,036 --> 01:34:08,153
it was serious enough
to kill him for it.

944
01:34:08,196 --> 01:34:11,711
Do you want to see how
they killed him?

945
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:21,306
This is just a story, Yamba.

946
01:34:21,516 --> 01:34:24,394
But look. That's not the end of it.

947
01:34:28,476 --> 01:34:33,027
His people took his body down
from this...thing...this...

948
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:40,667
(Prays in Latin)

949
01:34:42,596 --> 01:34:48,353
(Mende) They took him into a cave.
They wrapped him in a cloth, like us.

950
01:34:49,356 --> 01:34:53,952
They thought he was dead, but
he appeared before his people again

951
01:34:53,996 --> 01:34:55,634
and spoke to them.

952
01:34:57,836 --> 01:35:03,433
Then, finally...
he rose into the sky.

953
01:35:04,796 --> 01:35:07,105
(Judge continues Latin prayer)

954
01:35:15,356 --> 01:35:19,190
This is where the soul goes
when you die.

955
01:35:23,436 --> 01:35:27,827
This is where we're going
when they kill us.

956
01:35:32,236 --> 01:35:34,147
It doesn't look so bad.

957
01:36:16,636 --> 01:36:19,708
(Mende) Baukei...
Hold your head up.

958
01:36:52,436 --> 01:36:53,915
(Bailiff) All rise.

959
01:37:04,556 --> 01:37:06,467
(Door opens)

960
01:37:51,756 --> 01:37:55,590
After careful review
and thorough reflection,

961
01:37:56,956 --> 01:38:01,427
I find it impossible to deny the
power of the government's position.

962
01:38:03,636 --> 01:38:08,027
There is no doubt in my mind
that District Attorney Holabird,

963
01:38:08,076 --> 01:38:12,035
Her Catholic Majesty,
Isabella of Spain,

964
01:38:12,076 --> 01:38:15,591
and her trusted minister,
Senor Calderon,

965
01:38:15,636 --> 01:38:18,594
have all proceeded
with the utmost faith

966
01:38:18,636 --> 01:38:21,469
in the soundness of their case.

967
01:38:24,476 --> 01:38:29,231
I also believe
that Senors Ruiz and Montes

968
01:38:29,276 --> 01:38:35,749
may have...misrepresented
the origin of the prisoners,

969
01:38:36,916 --> 01:38:40,670
an issue which weighs
crucially upon their fate,

970
01:38:40,716 --> 01:38:43,310
and that of the Spaniards as well.

971
01:38:49,036 --> 01:38:51,994
Were they born in Africa?

972
01:38:58,836 --> 01:39:01,270
Since the answer to that question

973
01:39:01,316 --> 01:39:05,707
shall govern every determination
of this court, I ask it again.

974
01:39:08,356 --> 01:39:10,870
Were they born in Africa?

975
01:39:24,236 --> 01:39:26,147
I believe they were.

976
01:39:26,196 --> 01:39:28,107
(Murmuring)

977
01:39:32,556 --> 01:39:37,789
As such, Her Catholic Majesty's
claims of ownership have no merit.

978
01:39:37,836 --> 01:39:39,713
(Murmuring)

979
01:39:39,756 --> 01:39:43,954
Neither do those for salvage
made by Lieutenants Mead and Gedney.

980
01:39:45,716 --> 01:39:48,867
I hereby order the arrest
and detention

981
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:51,066
of Senors Ruiz and Montes..

982
01:39:51,156 --> 01:39:53,624
- (Cheering)
- (Shouts in Spanish)

983
01:39:53,676 --> 01:39:55,428
..by federal mar...

984
01:39:55,476 --> 01:39:59,867
By federal marshals...on
the charge of slave-trading!

985
01:40:01,316 --> 01:40:03,227
(Cheering and applause)

986
01:40:06,116 --> 01:40:08,630
The release of the Africans

987
01:40:08,756 --> 01:40:11,793
and their conveyance,
by this government,

988
01:40:11,836 --> 01:40:14,145
at her earliest
convenience and expense,

989
01:40:14,196 --> 01:40:16,756
back to their homes in Africa!

990
01:40:16,796 --> 01:40:18,707
Yes!

991
01:40:26,556 --> 01:40:30,185
We've done it, Joadson!
We've done it! Yes!

992
01:40:30,276 --> 01:40:32,949
Covey, tell them! Tell them now!

993
01:40:32,996 --> 01:40:36,193
(Sobbing and chanting)

994
01:40:36,236 --> 01:40:38,147
(All chant)

995
01:40:39,756 --> 01:40:41,667
Look at 'em!

996
01:41:34,876 --> 01:41:37,834
What's most bewildering
to Her Majesty

997
01:41:37,876 --> 01:41:41,915
is this arrogant independence
of the American courts.

998
01:41:41,956 --> 01:41:45,710
After all, if you cannot
rule the courts, you cannot rule.

999
01:41:45,756 --> 01:41:48,668
Senor Calderon, as any
true American will tell you,

1000
01:41:48,716 --> 01:41:52,504
its the independence of our courts
that keeps us free.

1001
01:42:00,396 --> 01:42:03,194
(Forsyth) John...I'm glad you came.

1002
01:42:05,756 --> 01:42:08,634
Mr President?
Senator Calhoun is here.

1003
01:42:08,716 --> 01:42:14,029
John! I was afraid you weren't
going to be able to join us.

1004
01:42:14,076 --> 01:42:17,671
- You may put that fear to rest, sir.
- Oh, thank you! Please.

1005
01:42:17,756 --> 01:42:21,112
I'd like you to meet Senor Calderon,
ambassador from Spain.

1006
01:42:21,196 --> 01:42:24,393
Buenas noches, Senor Ambassador.

1007
01:42:26,196 --> 01:42:29,984
- Thought you said he wasn't coming.
- He said he wasn't.

1008
01:42:30,036 --> 01:42:32,869
You see, Senor Calderon,

1009
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:37,114
there's a growing number of people
in this part of the country

1010
01:42:37,196 --> 01:42:39,949
that regard us in the South

1011
01:42:40,476 --> 01:42:43,991
as not only geographically
beneath them.

1012
01:42:44,036 --> 01:42:46,596
(Exhales) They ignore the fact

1013
01:42:46,636 --> 01:42:51,107
that slavery is so interwoven
into the fabric of this society,

1014
01:42:51,156 --> 01:42:55,434
that to destroy it would be
to destroy us as a people.

1015
01:42:55,516 --> 01:42:59,031
It's immoral. That's all they know.

1016
01:43:00,076 --> 01:43:02,954
Therefore, so are we.

1017
01:43:03,676 --> 01:43:06,713
Immoral and inferior.

1018
01:43:09,236 --> 01:43:12,228
We are inferior in one area.

1019
01:43:12,756 --> 01:43:16,465
We're not as proficient
in the art of gain.

1020
01:43:16,516 --> 01:43:20,225
We're not as wealthy
as our northern neighbors.

1021
01:43:20,316 --> 01:43:22,671
We're still struggling.

1022
01:43:23,836 --> 01:43:26,589
Take away our life's blood now...

1023
01:43:28,036 --> 01:43:32,393
Well, we all know
what happens then.

1024
01:43:32,436 --> 01:43:34,472
North and South.

1025
01:43:36,556 --> 01:43:40,435
They become the masters,
and we the slaves.

1026
01:43:41,996 --> 01:43:44,066
But not without a fight.

1027
01:43:47,796 --> 01:43:50,310
Senator Calhoun is being modest.

1028
01:43:50,356 --> 01:43:54,315
He's not inferior in another area -
the art of exaggeration.

1029
01:43:54,356 --> 01:43:56,267
(Laughter)

1030
01:43:58,516 --> 01:44:01,235
Ask yourself, Senor Calderon...

1031
01:44:01,796 --> 01:44:04,071
What court wants to be responsible

1032
01:44:04,116 --> 01:44:07,074
for the spark that ignites
the firestorm?

1033
01:44:08,156 --> 01:44:11,705
What president
wants to be in office...

1034
01:44:11,756 --> 01:44:14,873
when it comes crashing
down around him?

1035
01:44:16,356 --> 01:44:19,154
Certainly no court before this one.

1036
01:44:20,996 --> 01:44:25,512
Certainly no president
before this one.

1037
01:44:26,996 --> 01:44:28,349
So...

1038
01:44:28,396 --> 01:44:30,956
Judge us not too harshly, sir,

1039
01:44:32,836 --> 01:44:35,111
and bid Her Majesty like.

1040
01:44:35,996 --> 01:44:40,831
Because the real determination our
courts and our president must make

1041
01:44:40,876 --> 01:44:44,346
is not whether this
ragtag group of Africans

1042
01:44:44,396 --> 01:44:47,149
raised swords against their enemy,

1043
01:44:47,236 --> 01:44:50,467
but rather...must we?

1044
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:14,467
Whoa!

1045
01:45:17,476 --> 01:45:19,865
(Baldwin) Come along, Mr Joadson.

1046
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:22,669
This news...

1047
01:45:22,756 --> 01:45:25,793
Well, of course,
it's bad news, but...

1048
01:45:25,876 --> 01:45:30,586
They may be more valuable to our
struggle in death than in life.

1049
01:45:35,316 --> 01:45:37,432
Martyrdom, Mr Joadson.

1050
01:45:38,196 --> 01:45:40,152
From the dawn of Christianity,

1051
01:45:40,196 --> 01:45:43,268
we have seen no stronger
power for change.

1052
01:45:44,276 --> 01:45:46,187
You know it's true.

1053
01:45:48,996 --> 01:45:51,590
What is true, Mr Tappan -

1054
01:45:51,676 --> 01:45:55,385
and believe me when I tell you,
I've seen this -

1055
01:45:55,436 --> 01:46:00,226
is that there are men whose hatred of
slavery is stronger than anything,

1056
01:46:02,156 --> 01:46:04,386
except for the slave himself.

1057
01:46:07,236 --> 01:46:11,707
If you wish to inspire such hatred
in a man, Mr Joadson,

1058
01:46:11,756 --> 01:46:15,192
speak to him in that fashion
and it may come true.

1059
01:46:23,956 --> 01:46:25,912
(Slams door)

1060
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:30,946
(Shouting and chanting)

1061
01:46:45,276 --> 01:46:49,474
Our president,
our big, big man,

1062
01:46:49,556 --> 01:46:52,593
has appealed the decision
to our Supreme Court.

1063
01:46:52,636 --> 01:46:54,945
(Covey translates)

1064
01:46:57,756 --> 01:46:59,951
What does that mean?

1065
01:47:03,716 --> 01:47:06,469
We have to try the case again.

1066
01:47:11,276 --> 01:47:13,153
(Translates)

1067
01:47:13,196 --> 01:47:16,268
Now, I-I know it's hard
to understand, Cinque.

1068
01:47:16,356 --> 01:47:18,790
I don't understand, for that matter.

1069
01:47:18,876 --> 01:47:21,231
(Replies in Mende)

1070
01:47:21,276 --> 01:47:24,666
(Covey) You said there would be
a judgment, and we would go free.

1071
01:47:24,716 --> 01:47:28,470
No, no. What I said is that we won
it at the state level.

1072
01:47:28,516 --> 01:47:30,472
(All shout at once)

1073
01:47:30,556 --> 01:47:34,390
I said if we won it at the
state level, we then go on.

1074
01:47:34,476 --> 01:47:36,706
- (Cinque shouts)
- (Covey) That's what you said!

1075
01:47:36,836 --> 01:47:40,033
- That's what you said!
- All right! Yes, I said it!

1076
01:47:40,076 --> 01:47:44,115
I said it, but I shouldn't have.
What I should have said...

1077
01:47:44,156 --> 01:47:46,750
- I can't translate that.
- You can't translate what?

1078
01:47:46,796 --> 01:47:49,708
- I can't translate "should".
- There's no Mende word for "should"?

1079
01:47:49,756 --> 01:47:52,509
No. Either you do something,
or you don't do it.

1080
01:47:52,556 --> 01:47:55,389
What I meant to say, what I MEANT...

1081
01:47:55,436 --> 01:47:57,996
- Not in the way you mean it.
- (Groans)

1082
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:02,116
- (Cinque shouts)
- Try and understand me.

1083
01:48:02,156 --> 01:48:06,752
"Meant" is the same as "should".
You're misunderstanding the language.

1084
01:48:06,796 --> 01:48:10,584
Cinque! Listen to me.
Understand what I'm saying.

1085
01:48:10,636 --> 01:48:14,185
What I said to you
before the judgment

1086
01:48:14,276 --> 01:48:17,552
is almost how it works here.

1087
01:48:17,636 --> 01:48:20,389
- Almost!
- (Covey translates)

1088
01:48:22,316 --> 01:48:24,466
(Covey) Almost?

1089
01:48:24,516 --> 01:48:26,632
Yes, Cinque. But not always.

1090
01:48:26,676 --> 01:48:29,144
(Covey translates)

1091
01:48:29,516 --> 01:48:32,633
Yes. And that's what's happened here.

1092
01:48:42,596 --> 01:48:45,315
(Mende) What kind of place is this?

1093
01:48:49,756 --> 01:48:53,590
Where you almost mean what you say?
Where laws almost work?

1094
01:48:53,636 --> 01:48:55,911
How can you live like that?

1095
01:48:57,116 --> 01:48:59,994

1096

1120
01:51:44,836 --> 01:51:48,112
Mr Tippings, excuse me
a moment, please.

1121
01:51:53,556 --> 01:51:57,151
- Any word from...?
- What did Cinque say?

1122
01:51:57,236 --> 01:51:59,511
He won't talk to you.

1123
01:51:59,916 --> 01:52:01,872
He won't talk to me?

1124
01:52:01,956 --> 01:52:03,867
No.

1125
01:52:07,916 --> 01:52:10,225
(Baldwin) How's your English coming?

1126
01:52:10,316 --> 01:52:12,750
No better than my Mende, I suppose.

1127
01:52:13,916 --> 01:52:18,706
Cinque, I know this isn't something
you necessarily want to think about,

1128
01:52:18,756 --> 01:52:22,271
but has it occurred to you
that I'm all you've got?

1129
01:52:22,316 --> 01:52:27,709
Because, since my practice has
now completely deteriorated,

1130
01:52:27,756 --> 01:52:29,667
you're all I've got.

1131
01:52:38,916 --> 01:52:41,384
See, this is me. You see?

1132
01:52:41,436 --> 01:52:43,870
You see? You see how this works?

1133
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:50,151
And-And-And this, this here,
Cinque, is for me. Hmm?

1134
01:52:51,036 --> 01:52:52,947
More death threats.

1135
01:52:52,996 --> 01:52:57,274
Some have been signed.
By my own clients, no less.

1136
01:52:57,356 --> 01:53:00,712
I should say, should say...
former clients, shouldn't I?

1137
01:53:06,116 --> 01:53:10,906
There is one more consequence
to having no clientele to speak of.

1138
01:53:14,076 --> 01:53:17,955
I am now free to sit here
as long as it takes

1139
01:53:17,996 --> 01:53:19,588
for you to acknowledge me.

1140
01:53:19,676 --> 01:53:22,713
Yes, you understood that word,
didn't you?

1141
01:53:22,756 --> 01:53:23,745
Free.

1142
01:53:25,156 --> 01:53:27,067
All right.

1143
01:53:30,756 --> 01:53:32,986
Then we'll just sit.

1144
01:53:35,316 --> 01:53:37,193
Caesar.

1145
01:53:39,796 --> 01:53:42,913
Cicero's appeal was to
Julius Caesar, not Claudius.

1146
01:53:42,956 --> 01:53:45,834
Claudius would not be born
for another hundred years.

1147
01:53:45,876 --> 01:53:49,073
You were right,
there was one of them.

1148
01:53:49,396 --> 01:53:52,706
- Is that him?
- (Guard) Yes, Mr President.

1149
01:53:53,596 --> 01:53:55,507
Please unlock this door.

1150
01:53:55,556 --> 01:53:58,275
Adams has flirted with abolitionists
for 15 years,

1151
01:53:58,316 --> 01:54:00,546
but has yet to take one home.

1152
01:54:00,636 --> 01:54:04,026
- How old is he?
- Too old to take anyone home!

1153
01:54:04,076 --> 01:54:07,591
He sleeps through three quarters
of the sessions on the Hill.

1154
01:54:07,636 --> 01:54:10,753
Let's see. President,
slumbering congressman,

1155
01:54:10,796 --> 01:54:15,267
jailhouse lawyer - one waits with
great anticipation for what's next!

1156
01:54:15,316 --> 01:54:18,035
- What must that be like?
- What?

1157
01:54:18,076 --> 01:54:21,273
Knowing all your life,
whatever your accomplishments,

1158
01:54:21,316 --> 01:54:24,194
you'll only be remembered
as the son of a great father.

1159
01:54:24,236 --> 01:54:29,026
The only thing John Quincy Adams will
remembered for is his middle name!

1160
01:54:31,156 --> 01:54:35,672
I wonder, is there anything
as pathetic as an ex-president?

1161
01:54:40,556 --> 01:54:42,990
I was talking about John...

1162
01:54:44,756 --> 01:54:46,667
(Door closes)

1163
01:54:47,316 --> 01:54:49,034
(Hushed conversation in Mende)

1164
01:55:10,876 --> 01:55:13,151
- Sir.
- Yes?

1165
01:55:13,196 --> 01:55:16,268
Cinque has asked me t-t-to ask you...

1166
01:55:16,316 --> 01:55:20,195
whether you have thought about
the question of jurisdiction.

1167
01:55:20,236 --> 01:55:21,749
What?

1168
01:55:21,796 --> 01:55:26,028
That since they took over
the ship far out to sea,

1169
01:55:26,076 --> 01:55:29,751
and since neither Spain
nor America owns the sea,

1170
01:55:29,796 --> 01:55:32,390
how is it that the treaty applies?

1171
01:55:34,316 --> 01:55:39,106
Tell him the treaty recognises
no jurisdictional limitations.

1172
01:55:40,076 --> 01:55:42,829
- He will ask me why.

1173
01:55:42,876 --> 01:55:44,867
Because I said so.

1174
01:55:57,396 --> 01:56:00,991
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

1175
01:56:01,036 --> 01:56:05,951
Cinque would like to know that if he
is the property of Ruiz and Montes,

1176
01:56:05,996 --> 01:56:10,387
then how does the treaty apply,
as it is between America and Spain?

1177
01:56:10,476 --> 01:56:12,706
Or their citizens.

1178
01:56:13,356 --> 01:56:17,474
"Or their citizens" is included
in the language, if he must know.

1179
01:56:17,516 --> 01:56:19,427
Thank you, sir.

1180
01:56:23,036 --> 01:56:25,186
It's a good point, though.

1181
01:56:32,596 --> 01:56:35,827
Does Britain have any treaties with
West Africa which may override

1182
01:56:35,876 --> 01:56:38,754
- those between Spain and America?
- No.

1183
01:56:38,796 --> 01:56:41,469
Does Britain have any
treaties with America

1184
01:56:41,516 --> 01:56:44,155
- which might override those...
- No.

1185
01:56:44,196 --> 01:56:47,233
Does America have treaties
with West Africa?

1186
01:56:47,276 --> 01:56:48,311
No!

1187
01:56:48,356 --> 01:56:50,267
- Does Spain?
- No!

1188
01:56:50,356 --> 01:56:52,267
Does the Commonwealth of Connecticut

1189
01:56:52,316 --> 01:56:56,229
- have any treaties with West Africa?
- No, no, no, no! Now stop this!

1190
01:57:01,916 --> 01:57:03,827
Unshackle him.

1191
01:57:03,996 --> 01:57:05,907
I'm sorry, sir.

1192
01:57:05,956 --> 01:57:09,392
- I'm under strict orders...
- Unshackle him, please.

1193
01:57:11,716 --> 01:57:13,627
Yes, Mr President.

1194
01:57:21,956 --> 01:57:24,834
This is a phalaenopsis, moth orchid,

1195
01:57:24,876 --> 01:57:26,832
I brought over from China.

1196
01:57:27,596 --> 01:57:31,225
And this is a primrose
from an English garden.

1197
01:57:31,276 --> 01:57:35,713
(Chuckles) And, uh, this spear lily,

1198
01:57:35,796 --> 01:57:37,991
from the south of France.

1199
01:57:40,636 --> 01:57:42,991
This is my rose Blush Noisette.

1200
01:57:43,036 --> 01:57:46,665
This came all the way from,
uh, Washington, DC,

1201
01:57:46,716 --> 01:57:48,832
but don't tell anyone.

1202
01:57:50,916 --> 01:57:52,747
Hmm.

1203
01:58:02,276 --> 01:58:04,187
Go on, go on.

1204
01:58:12,036 --> 01:58:13,947
(Speaks Mende)

1205
01:58:18,516 --> 01:58:23,306
African violet. I can't tell you
how difficult that was to come by.

1206
01:58:36,316 --> 01:58:40,355
Now, you understand you're going
to the Supreme Court.

1207
01:58:41,516 --> 01:58:43,507
Do you know why?

1208
01:58:43,556 --> 01:58:45,672
(Covey translates)

1209
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:52,993
It is the place where
they finally kill us.

1210
01:58:53,036 --> 01:58:56,506
(Chuckles) No. Well, yes,
that may be true too.

1211
01:58:57,236 --> 01:58:59,830
(Laughs) That's not what I meant.

1212
01:58:59,876 --> 01:59:03,266
No, there is another reason
and a more important reason.

1213
01:59:03,316 --> 01:59:08,026
Although I'll admit that, uh,
perhaps more so to us than you.

1214
01:59:08,116 --> 01:59:10,755
All right, don't...

1215
01:59:10,836 --> 01:59:12,747
(Coughs) Cinque...

1216
01:59:16,116 --> 01:59:21,349
Do you know who I am?
Has anyone told you about me?

1217
01:59:21,436 --> 01:59:24,234
(Translates)

1218
01:59:26,516 --> 01:59:29,633
- What have they told you?
- (Translates)

1219
01:59:31,916 --> 01:59:33,986
That you are a chief.

1220
01:59:34,036 --> 01:59:36,106
I was a chief, yes.

1221
01:59:42,116 --> 01:59:45,950
A chief cannot become anything less
than a chief, even in death.

1222
01:59:47,836 --> 01:59:51,272
Oh, how I wish such
were true here, Cinque.

1223
01:59:51,316 --> 01:59:53,352
You've no idea.

1224
01:59:54,916 --> 01:59:58,113
One tries to govern
wisely, strongly, but...

1225
01:59:58,156 --> 02:00:03,276
One tries to govern in a way that
betters the lives of one's villagers.

1226
02:00:04,276 --> 02:00:08,030
One tries to...kill the lion.

1227
02:00:10,236 --> 02:00:15,594
Unfortunately, one isn't always
wise enough or strong enough.

1228
02:00:18,596 --> 02:00:20,507
Time passes...

1229
02:00:22,076 --> 02:00:24,146
and the moment is gone.

1230
02:00:25,316 --> 02:00:29,753
Now, listen, Cinque. Listen.

1231
02:00:29,836 --> 02:00:34,546
We're about...We're about
to bring your case

1232
02:00:34,636 --> 02:00:37,787
before the highest court
in our land.

1233
02:00:37,876 --> 02:00:40,629
Were about to do battle with a lion

1234
02:00:40,676 --> 02:00:44,305
that is threatening
to rip our country in two.

1235
02:00:44,396 --> 02:00:48,514
Huh? And all we have on our side

1236
02:00:48,596 --> 02:00:50,905
is a rock.

1237
02:00:53,476 --> 02:00:56,786
Of course, you didn't ask
to be at the centre

1238
02:00:56,836 --> 02:00:59,555
of this historic conflagration
any more than I did,

1239
02:00:59,636 --> 02:01:01,991
but we find ourselves here,
nonetheless,

1240
02:01:02,076 --> 02:01:05,113
by some mysterious mix
of circumstances

1241
02:01:05,196 --> 02:01:07,994
and the whole world watching.

1242
02:01:08,076 --> 02:01:11,591
So, uh, what are we to do? Huh?

1243
02:01:15,116 --> 02:01:20,986
(Mende) Is he going to help? He has
far many more questions than answers.

1244
02:01:21,516 --> 02:01:24,394
- What did he just say?
- I-I...Sorry, I didn't catch it.

1245
02:01:24,436 --> 02:01:29,112
Cinque, look.
I'm being honest with you.

1246
02:01:29,196 --> 02:01:32,108
Anything less would be
disrespectful.

1247
02:01:34,036 --> 02:01:37,187
I'm telling you, I'm preparing you,

1248
02:01:37,276 --> 02:01:40,427
I suppose I'm explaining to you,

1249
02:01:40,516 --> 02:01:44,748
that the test ahead of us is
an exceptionally difficult one.

1250
02:01:47,356 --> 02:01:52,066
- (Speaks Mende)
- We won't be going in there alone.

1251
02:01:52,116 --> 02:01:54,869
Alone? Indeed not.
We have right at our side.

1252
02:01:54,956 --> 02:01:57,026
We have righteousness at our side.

1253
02:01:57,076 --> 02:01:59,067
We have Mr Baldwin over there.

1254
02:02:06,276 --> 02:02:10,110
(Covey, translating)
I meant my ancestors.

1255
02:02:12,836 --> 02:02:15,225
I will call into the past,

1256
02:02:16,516 --> 02:02:18,711
far back to the beginning of time,

1257
02:02:18,756 --> 02:02:21,793
and beg them to come and help me

1258
02:02:23,956 --> 02:02:25,867
at the judgment.

1259
02:02:26,156 --> 02:02:29,751
I will reach back
and draw them into me.

1260
02:02:31,916 --> 02:02:33,827
And they must come,

1261
02:02:34,276 --> 02:02:38,747
for at this moment, I am the whole
reason they have existed at all.

1262
02:03:19,396 --> 02:03:21,307
Your Honours...

1263
02:03:22,916 --> 02:03:25,794
(Clears throat)
I derive much consolation

1264
02:03:25,876 --> 02:03:30,074
from the fact that my colleague,
Mr Baldwin here,

1265
02:03:31,716 --> 02:03:34,628
has argued the case

1266
02:03:34,716 --> 02:03:38,265
in so able, and so complete a manner

1267
02:03:39,956 --> 02:03:43,505
as to leave me scarcely
anything to say.

1268
02:03:44,996 --> 02:03:46,907
However...

1269
02:03:48,596 --> 02:03:50,507
Why are we here?

1270
02:03:52,196 --> 02:03:55,632
How is it that a simple,
plain property issue

1271
02:03:55,716 --> 02:03:59,152
should now find itself
so ennobled as to be argued

1272
02:03:59,196 --> 02:04:02,313
before the Supreme Court of
the United States of America?

1273
02:04:02,396 --> 02:04:07,072
Do we fear the lower courts, which
found for us, missed the truth?

1274
02:04:07,156 --> 02:04:11,195
Or is it, rather, our great
and consuming fear of civil war,

1275
02:04:11,276 --> 02:04:13,744
that has allowed us to heap symbolism

1276
02:04:13,796 --> 02:04:16,435
upon a simple case
that never asked for it?

1277
02:04:16,476 --> 02:04:19,354
And now would have us disregard truth

1278
02:04:19,436 --> 02:04:23,395
even as it stands before us,
tall and proud as a mountain.

1279
02:04:24,276 --> 02:04:31,227
The truth...in truth, has been driven
from this case like a slave.

1280
02:04:31,996 --> 02:04:36,865
Flogged from court to court,
wretched and destitute.

1281
02:04:36,956 --> 02:04:41,347
And not by any great legal acumen

1282
02:04:41,396 --> 02:04:44,229
on the part of the opposition,
I might add.

1283
02:04:45,476 --> 02:04:50,186
But through the long, powerful arm
of the executive office.

1284
02:04:50,236 --> 02:04:53,034
This is no mere property
case, gentlemen.

1285
02:04:53,076 --> 02:04:56,193
This is the most important case
ever to come before this court.

1286
02:04:56,276 --> 02:05:00,315
Because what it in fact concerns

1287
02:05:02,156 --> 02:05:04,272
is the very nature of man.

1288
02:05:08,156 --> 02:05:10,226
Uh, these are, um...

1289
02:05:13,716 --> 02:05:16,150
These are transcriptions of letters

1290
02:05:16,196 --> 02:05:20,951
written between our
secretary of state, John Forsyth,

1291
02:05:20,996 --> 02:05:24,193
and the Queen of Spain,
Isabella the Second.

1292
02:05:25,636 --> 02:05:29,265
Now, I ask that you accept
their perusal

1293
02:05:29,356 --> 02:05:32,075
as part of your deliberations.

1294
02:05:32,156 --> 02:05:34,386
Thank you, sir.

1295
02:05:34,436 --> 02:05:37,792
I would not touch on them now
except to notice

1296
02:05:37,836 --> 02:05:40,987
a curious phrase
which is much repeated.

1297
02:05:42,476 --> 02:05:46,867
The Queen again and again refers
to our incompetent courts.

1298
02:05:48,276 --> 02:05:52,064
Now what, I wonder, would be
more to her liking? Huh?

1299
02:05:53,396 --> 02:05:56,513
A court that finds against
the Africans?

1300
02:05:56,556 --> 02:05:58,467
Well, I think not.

1301
02:06:00,196 --> 02:06:03,074
And here is the fine point of it.

1302
02:06:03,236 --> 02:06:07,468
What Her Majesty wants is a court
that behaves just like her courts.

1303
02:06:07,556 --> 02:06:10,354
The courts this 11-year-old child

1304
02:06:10,396 --> 02:06:14,275
plays with in her magical kingdom
called Spain.

1305
02:06:14,356 --> 02:06:16,711
A court that will do what it is told.

1306
02:06:16,796 --> 02:06:20,425
A court that can be toyed with
like a doll.

1307
02:06:20,516 --> 02:06:22,984
(Chuckles) A court, as it happens,

1308
02:06:23,076 --> 02:06:26,432
of which our own president,

1309
02:06:26,516 --> 02:06:29,633
Martin Van Buren,
would be most proud.

1310
02:06:29,716 --> 02:06:31,991
Thank you.

1311
02:06:32,036 --> 02:06:35,506
This is a publication
of the office of the President.

1312
02:06:35,556 --> 02:06:38,434
It's called "The Executive Review",

1313
02:06:38,476 --> 02:06:40,910
and I'm sure you all read it.

1314
02:06:40,956 --> 02:06:44,631
At least I'm sure the President
hopes you all read it.

1315
02:06:44,676 --> 02:06:49,272
This is a recent issue, and there's,
uh, an article in here,

1316
02:06:49,316 --> 02:06:53,753
written by "a keen mind
of the South", who...

1317
02:06:53,836 --> 02:06:57,465
My former vice-president,
John Calhoun, perhaps.

1318
02:06:57,516 --> 02:06:59,472
Could it be?

1319
02:06:59,516 --> 02:07:03,031
Who asserts that "there has never
existed a civilized society

1320
02:07:03,116 --> 02:07:07,906
"in which one segment did not
thrive upon the labour of another.

1321
02:07:07,956 --> 02:07:10,754
"As far back as one chooses to look,

1322
02:07:10,836 --> 02:07:13,634
"to ancient times, to Biblical times,

1323
02:07:13,716 --> 02:07:16,150
"history bears this out.

1324
02:07:16,196 --> 02:07:19,984
"In Eden, where only two
were created.

1325
02:07:20,036 --> 02:07:24,109
"Even there, one was pronounced
subordinate to the other.

1326
02:07:25,636 --> 02:07:27,991
"Slavery has always been with us,

1327
02:07:28,036 --> 02:07:31,028
"and is neither sinful nor immoral.

1328
02:07:32,956 --> 02:07:37,507
"Rather, as war and antagonism
are the natural states of man,

1329
02:07:37,596 --> 02:07:42,386
"so, too, slavery, as natural
as it is inevitable."

1330
02:07:45,036 --> 02:07:48,392
Well, gentlemen, I differ with
the keen minds of the South,

1331
02:07:48,436 --> 02:07:51,826
and with our president,
who apparently shares their views,

1332
02:07:51,916 --> 02:07:55,272
offering that the natural state
of mankind is instead -

1333
02:07:55,316 --> 02:07:57,876
and I know this is
a controversial idea -

1334
02:07:57,956 --> 02:07:59,867
is freedom.

1335
02:08:02,836 --> 02:08:04,747
Is freedom.

1336
02:08:06,116 --> 02:08:09,153
The proof is the length to which
a man, woman or child will go

1337
02:08:09,196 --> 02:08:10,948
to regain it, once taken.

1338
02:08:10,996 --> 02:08:14,352
He will break loose his chains.

1339
02:08:14,436 --> 02:08:17,269
He will...decimate his enemies.

1340
02:08:17,316 --> 02:08:20,467
He will try and try and try,

1341
02:08:20,516 --> 02:08:24,304
against all odds,
against all prejudices,

1342
02:08:24,356 --> 02:08:26,267
to get home.

1343
02:08:30,196 --> 02:08:33,950
Cinque, would you stand up,
if you would,

1344
02:08:35,316 --> 02:08:37,750
so everyone can see you.

1345
02:08:40,356 --> 02:08:44,474
This man is black.
We can all see that.

1346
02:08:44,516 --> 02:08:49,271
But can we also see as easily
that which is equally true?

1347
02:08:49,316 --> 02:08:53,912
That he is the only
true hero in this room.

1348
02:08:53,956 --> 02:08:56,629
If he were white,
he wouldn't be in this court,

1349
02:08:56,676 --> 02:08:58,871
fighting for his life.

1350
02:08:58,916 --> 02:09:01,749
If he were white
and his enslavers British,

1351
02:09:01,796 --> 02:09:06,950
he'd be weighed down by the medals
and honours we would bestow upon him.

1352
02:09:06,996 --> 02:09:09,464
Songs would be written about him.

1353
02:09:10,516 --> 02:09:13,952
The great authors of our times
would fill books about him.

1354
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:16,146
His story would be told

1355
02:09:16,196 --> 02:09:19,825
and retold, in our classrooms.

1356
02:09:20,996 --> 02:09:25,706
Our children, because we would
make sure of it,

1357
02:09:25,756 --> 02:09:29,795
would know his name as well as
they know Patrick Henry's.

1358
02:09:31,036 --> 02:09:33,391
Yet, if the South is right,

1359
02:09:33,436 --> 02:09:37,395
what are we to do with that
embarrassing, annoying document,

1360
02:09:37,476 --> 02:09:40,548
"The Declaration of Independence"?

1361
02:09:40,636 --> 02:09:43,309
What of its conceits?

1362
02:09:44,956 --> 02:09:50,155
"All men created equal," "inalienable
rights," "life, liberty," and so on.

1363
02:09:51,796 --> 02:09:54,674
What on Earth are we
to do with this?

1364
02:09:54,716 --> 02:09:57,310
I have a modest suggestion.

1365
02:10:16,356 --> 02:10:20,634
The other night I was talking
with my friend Cinque.

1366
02:10:20,676 --> 02:10:24,589
He was over at my place, and we were
out in the greenhouse together.

1367
02:10:24,636 --> 02:10:30,472
He explained to me how when a member
of the Mende - that's his people...

1368
02:10:31,556 --> 02:10:34,673
How when a member of the Mende
encounters a situation

1369
02:10:34,756 --> 02:10:37,907
where there appears
no hope at all,

1370
02:10:37,996 --> 02:10:40,669
he invokes his ancestors.

1371
02:10:41,116 --> 02:10:43,471
Tradition.

1372
02:10:47,196 --> 02:10:51,189
The Mende believe that if one can
summon the spirit of one's ancestors,

1373
02:10:51,236 --> 02:10:53,306
then they have never left.

1374
02:10:54,236 --> 02:10:58,275
And the wisdom and strength
they fathered and inspired

1375
02:10:58,316 --> 02:11:00,546
will come to his aid.

1376
02:11:08,596 --> 02:11:12,350
James Madison,
Alexander Hamilton,

1377
02:11:12,396 --> 02:11:15,069
Benjamin Franklin,

1378
02:11:15,156 --> 02:11:17,112
Thomas Jefferson,

1379
02:11:19,036 --> 02:11:20,947
George Washington,

1380
02:11:23,996 --> 02:11:25,907
John Adams.

1381
02:11:33,716 --> 02:11:37,265
We have long resisted
asking your for guidance.

1382
02:11:37,316 --> 02:11:40,149
Perhaps we have feared
in doing so,

1383
02:11:40,196 --> 02:11:42,664
we might acknowledge
that our individuality,

1384
02:11:42,716 --> 02:11:46,914
which we so, so revere,
is not entirely our own.

1385
02:11:48,796 --> 02:11:53,586
Perhaps were feared an...an appeal
to you might be taken for weakness.

1386
02:11:55,316 --> 02:12:00,344
But we have come to understand,
finally, that this is not so.

1387
02:12:02,276 --> 02:12:04,392
We understand now...

1388
02:12:05,436 --> 02:12:07,996
We've been made to understand,

1389
02:12:08,996 --> 02:12:12,033
and to embrace the understanding

1390
02:12:14,716 --> 02:12:16,946
that who we are

1391
02:12:17,036 --> 02:12:20,346
is who we were.

1392
02:12:28,796 --> 02:12:31,868
We desperately need
your strength and wisdom

1393
02:12:31,916 --> 02:12:36,546
to triumph over our fears,
our prejudices, ourselves.

1394
02:12:37,716 --> 02:12:40,674
Give us the courage
to do what is right.

1395
02:12:40,716 --> 02:12:45,107
And if it means civil war,
then let it come.

1396
02:12:46,396 --> 02:12:48,466
And when it does,

1397
02:12:48,556 --> 02:12:50,945
may it be, finally,

1398
02:12:51,036 --> 02:12:54,312
the last battle of
the American Revolution.

1399
02:13:02,396 --> 02:13:04,626
That's all I have to say.

1400
02:13:40,876 --> 02:13:42,787
(Snoring)

1401
02:13:47,956 --> 02:13:51,187
In the case of the United
States of America

1402
02:13:51,236 --> 02:13:53,511
versus the Amistad Africans,

1403
02:13:54,196 --> 02:13:56,994
it is the opinion of this court

1404
02:13:57,036 --> 02:14:01,268
that our treaty of 1795 with Spain,

1405
02:14:01,316 --> 02:14:05,628
on which the prosecution has
primarily based its arguments,

1406
02:14:05,676 --> 02:14:07,951
is inapplicable.

1407
02:14:08,156 --> 02:14:13,753
While it is clearly stipulated
in Article 9 that - and I quote -

1408
02:14:13,796 --> 02:14:15,912
"Seized ships and cargo

1409
02:14:15,956 --> 02:14:19,744
"are to be returned entirely
to their proprietary."

1410
02:14:19,796 --> 02:14:21,866
The end of quote.

1411
02:14:21,956 --> 02:14:25,551
It has not been shown
to the court's satisfaction

1412
02:14:25,596 --> 02:14:29,509
that these particular Africans
fit that description.

1413
02:14:29,556 --> 02:14:32,946
We are then left with the alternative

1414
02:14:32,996 --> 02:14:35,715
that they are not slaves,

1415
02:14:35,796 --> 02:14:38,947
and therefore cannot
be considered merchandise,

1416
02:14:38,996 --> 02:14:43,228
but are, rather, free individuals

1417
02:14:43,316 --> 02:14:47,070
with certain legal and moral rights,

1418
02:14:47,196 --> 02:14:50,632
including the right
to engage in insurrection

1419
02:14:50,676 --> 02:14:54,874
against those who would deny them
their freedom.

1420
02:14:54,956 --> 02:14:57,868
And therefore, over one dissent,

1421
02:14:57,916 --> 02:15:00,191
it is the court's judgment

1422
02:15:00,236 --> 02:15:05,151
that the defendants are to be
released from custody at once,

1423
02:15:05,236 --> 02:15:07,875
and, if they so choose,

1424
02:15:07,916 --> 02:15:12,512
to be returned
to their homes in Africa.

1425
02:15:30,396 --> 02:15:32,307
Thank you.

1426
02:15:38,396 --> 02:15:40,307
Well...

1427
02:15:43,036 --> 02:15:44,947
(Speaks Mende)

1428
02:15:44,996 --> 02:15:47,874
- (Covey) What did you say to them?
- Huh?

1429
02:15:50,756 --> 02:15:55,034
(Covey) What words did you use
to persuade them?

1430
02:15:56,036 --> 02:15:59,028
- Yours.
- (Covey translates)

1431
02:16:33,996 --> 02:16:36,464
(Speaks Mende)

1432
02:16:38,516 --> 02:16:40,632
To keep you safe.

1433
02:17:15,236 --> 02:17:20,310
Thank you...Baldwin.

1434
02:17:38,676 --> 02:17:40,587
(Speaks Mende)

1435
02:18:11,276 --> 02:18:13,187
(Officer) Fire!

1436
02:18:19,996 --> 02:18:21,907
(Shouting)

1437
02:18:45,996 --> 02:18:47,827
All clear, sir.

1438
02:18:47,916 --> 02:18:50,032
- Fire.
- Fire!

1439
02:18:54,156 --> 02:18:56,033
- Fire.
- Fire!

1440
02:19:00,516 --> 02:19:02,427
Fire.

1441
02:19:05,116 --> 02:19:06,151
Fire.

1442
02:19:07,596 --> 02:19:09,348
Fire.

1443
02:19:26,596 --> 02:19:28,587
(Fitzgerald) Take a letter, Ensign.

1444
02:19:28,636 --> 02:19:34,188
"To His Honour, the United States
secretary of state, Mr John Forsyth.

1445
02:19:34,276 --> 02:19:36,392
"My dear Mr Forsyth,

1446
02:19:36,476 --> 02:19:40,833
"it is my great pleasure to inform
you that you are, in fact, correct.

1447
02:19:40,876 --> 02:19:45,996
"The slave fortress in Sierra Leone
does not exist."

1448
02:20:43,916 --> 02:20:45,907
Que bonita!
