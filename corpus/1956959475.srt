00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,792
[Sighs]

543
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:52,883
I can't just turn
the preacher off and on.

544
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:55,408
You can with me.

545
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:58,106
That's different.

546
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:05,809
Maybe we should
consider having her
see a psychiatrist.

547
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,726
Ha ha! They are nothing
but drug-pushers

548
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:12,555
with prescription pads.

549
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:16,429
They'll convince her
that it's our fault that
she's so messed up.

550
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,866
That'll make her
hate US even more.

551
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,696
You know she
doesn't hate US.

552
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:28,049
She just needs
some time to adjust.

553
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,182
And willingness.

554
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:41,280
Baptism is
a symbol of rebirth.

555
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,630
It's the purification
of our souls

556
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,720
through the cleansing blood
of Jesus Christ.

557
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:52,334
But more than a symbol, it is
a real commitment to Christ,

558
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:55,990
witnessed by god
and this community.

559
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,995
[Piano playing]

560
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,742
So...you play the
piano, too, huh?

561
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,222
[Chuckles]

562
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,267
No. Not really.

563
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,096
I took lessons
when I was a kid,

564
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:18,447
but I only learned one song
before I got tired of playing.

565
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:21,363
That's too bad.

566
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:24,062
Could have been
quite the musician.

567
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:29,806
Well...maybe you
could teach me again.

00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,417
[Chuckles]

569
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:37,684
Hannah, there's
something we need
to talk about. Um...

570
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:42,776
I think we should
perhaps take a break

571
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:45,344
from music lessons
for a while.

572
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:49,696
Why?

573
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,918
Is it because of what
happened the other night?

574
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,618
I told you
I wouldn't tell anyone.

575
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:02,883
It never should have
happened to begin with.

576
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:05,277
It's not your fault.

577
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:08,193
Ok? I take full
responsibility

578
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,412
for what happened.

579
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:15,374
Lilly and I, we're
just...We're having
some issues right now,

580
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:22,250
and it just...
it's got nothing to do
with you, just stuff.

581
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,557
And we...

582
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:27,908
I just...I...

583
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:31,259
Got caught up
in a moment of weakness.

584
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,347
No.

585
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:34,480
No, not just a moment.

586
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,005
Every time I'm with you,
I forget who I am

587
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,225
and who i'm
supposed to be.

588
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,669
Maybe I want to forget.

589
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,687
I'm sorry.

590
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,645

00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:11,430
No.

592
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,043

done for tomorrow?

heading up to finish them.

lesson with Neal?

627

Uh...fine.

628
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,991
Did you work
on anything new?

629
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:47,733
Yeah, uh, a duet.

to tell you

it makes me,

for the lord.

634
00:39:56,306 --> 00:40:00,006
She's not a little
girl anymore, daddy.

635
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:03,052
She will always be
my little girl,

an old granny.

worst thing I could
possibly ever do!

you got here?

645
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,246
You know what I mean.

646
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:24,944
What, because he's married?

647
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:33,648
You know what
he told me?

648
00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:37,957
He said that he
and Lilly haven't...

00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:39,654
You know...

650

Since before
the twins were born.

651
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:45,791
They don't even
share a bed anymore.

652
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,620
If I popped out
4 of his pups,

653
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,709
I wouldn't let him
near me, either.

You've got to be
kidding me.

659
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:07,943
Hasn't anyone told you
anything about sex?

660
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:11,730
Just that it's
a sin to do it before
you're married.

661
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:18,301
Maybe you
should ask Neal.

662
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:19,564
What?

663
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:20,695
No! No way.

664
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:21,957
Why not?

665
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:24,569
Because...I'd be
too embarrassed.

666
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,396
Embarrassed?

667
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:29,008
You...you wouldn't
understand.

668
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:31,576
I'm not as experienced
as you are, ok?

669
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:36,624
Technically, you are
more experienced than me.

670
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:38,931
Wait.

671
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:42,108
You're saying
that you've never...

672
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:45,503
Then how do you know
so much about it?

673
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:49,289
Just because I know about sex
doesn't mean I've done it.

674
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:55,164
I guess sex ed wasn't part of
your home-school curriculum.

675
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:56,731
Are you kidding?

676
00:41:56,862 --> 00:41:58,820
That's why
I'm home-schooled.

677
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:01,475
Wait. You are telling
me that your parents
home-schooled you

678
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:03,738
all this time
to keep you out of sex ed

679
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,740
and then you end up
learning about it

680
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:07,960
on the sunday
schoolroom floor?

It's not.

some breakfast.

to come to church with US?

There's a lot of people
who'd love to see you.

00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:57,357
I'm sure.

691
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:36,178

Hardly been out of her
room since she got here.

699

I don't know what's
wrong with her.

700
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:56,372
Whatever it is, she's
not telling me about it.

Hmm.

702
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,203
Well, you let me know

703
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:04,076
if there's anything
I can do to help.

704
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:06,121
I appreciate that.

705
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:18,220

recognize you.

Um, I heard
you were back home.

715
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:45,508
You did. How?

716
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:47,946
Same way I hear all
the town's gossip...
the prayer chain.

717

Ha ha ha!

718
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,992
Great. Why doesn't
he just announce it

from the pulpit

720
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,605
I'll tell Rachel
that I ran into you.

721
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:57,303
You know, she's back at
school in New York now.

722
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:58,434
She's about to
graduate...

723
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:00,436
I got to go. It was
good seeing you.

724
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,656
Take care. Don't be
a stranger.

725
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:10,359
Wow, rache,
these are amazing.

726
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,361
You'll definitely
be able to get

727
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:14,407
into a good art
school with these.

728
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:16,583
Well, that'd be cool.

Who's this?

730
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:22,981
My mom.

731

How come you don't
live with her anymore?

734
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:36,429
She decided to
move in with this guy,

735
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,519
and I guess he didn't think
it was too cool having
a teenager around.

736
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,307
But...you're
her daughter.

737
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:47,614
How could she just
leave you like that?

738
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,486

their kids all the time.

739
00:45:50,617 --> 00:45:52,532
Not all the time.

740
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:58,233
So what are you
going to major in?

741
00:45:58,364 --> 00:46:01,280
Music, probably.

742
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:04,762
Neal thinks
I'll make a good
choir teacher

743
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:06,807
or something
like that.

744
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:09,418
Is that what you want?

745
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,291
It'll make
my parents happy.

746
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:15,990
I think Neal is
worried about me

747
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:17,470
going off to college
and meeting some guy

748
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,602
and forgetting
all about him.

749
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:22,736
Well, at least
you'll be able to go
out in public together.

750

Neal and I go out.

751
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:27,262
The other night,
he took me down
to the lake.

752
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:29,003
It was really nice.

753
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:32,224
I'll bet you didn't
even get out of the car.

754
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:34,879
We didn't need to.

755
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:37,882
Oh!

756
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:39,405
We could
see the sunset

757
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:41,233
over the lake through
the windshield.

758
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:43,757
You have
such a dirty mind.

759
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:51,547
Who's this?

760
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:53,811
Oh, that's some girl
from our old apartments.

761
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:56,552
She asked me to take
some photos of her

762
00:46:56,683 --> 00:47:00,774
so she could send them to some
modeling agency or some...

763
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:25,973
There are two types of
christians in the world.

764
00:47:26,104 --> 00:47:28,236
There are
spiritual christians,

765
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:31,936
and there are
carnal christians.

766
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:34,895
Now, spiritual christians,
they seek to please god,

767
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:38,725
to bring honor and glory to him
in their everyday lives.

Amen.

769
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:47,168
But carnal christians...
they seek to please themselves.

770
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:52,782
They yield to earthly pleasures
and, well, carnality.

771
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:57,265
Now, carnal christians may
seem to be spiritual christians.

772
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:00,573
They come to church.
They sing the hymns.

773
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:05,708

to all the church fellowships.

No. What. Why?

Because of

795

Because it's wrong.

Yes, I did.
