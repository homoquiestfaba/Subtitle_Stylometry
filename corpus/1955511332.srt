00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:05,005
*

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,584
*

3
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:35,569
(all shouting)

4
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,116
Who the hell are you
to tell me

5
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,451
that we're not
qualified at The Hive?!

6
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,353
I may have too many aches
rolling off my tongue,

7
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,654
but I can tell you this...

8
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,257
I know that these boys
are only in danger of...

9
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,592
(all shouting)

10
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,231
And I know that
they'll be extinct

11
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,798
if we leave it
up to you!

12
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,600
Now, you
check the stats!

13
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,203
(all shouting)

14
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,782
I'm trying my best
to wrestle them away

15
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,619
from the jailhouse guard
and the graveyard dog,

16
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,688
because those are
the only two options

17
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,689
y'all are giving them.

18
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,292
(all shouting)

19
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,267
I'm up at 5:30
in the morning,

20
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,334
cooking for 'em

21
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:42,270
and here I am on
a Friday night

22
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,304
fighting for 'em!

23
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,807
(all shouting)

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,476
Why don't y'all go
and take some money

25
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,843
from some of them
white programs

26
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,879
and leave us
the hell alone!

27
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,548
We trying to make
a difference.

28
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,151
What the hell kind of
difference are y'all making?!

29
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,387
Leave my school alone!

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,555
Enough, enough!

31
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,224
(man) Yeah, nigger, do
something. (Man) That's
how you do it.

32
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,492
(woman)
That's it!

33
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,294
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

34
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,464
Y'all straight?

35
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,732
Yeah.
We're straight.

36
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,301
Go on, partner.

37
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,673
6-8.

38
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,179
Y'all know the 6-8,
right?

39
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,747
(man)
6-8 for life,
for life.

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,682
Making real niggas out here
in these streets, right?

41
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,184
Yeah.
(woman)
That's right.

42
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:31,685
That's what we do.

43
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,221
Go to the ground
for you.

44
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:39,327
(children shouting
in distance)

45
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:47,668
*

46
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,908
(woman)
I said, if you ain't got
a school or a job to go to,

47
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,845
you need to get your asses up
out of here.

48
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,381
Every last
one of you, trifling.

49
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,649
Don't make me have to
get up.

50
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:07,788
Move out of the way!

51
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,457
No, you move
out the way.

52
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,226
(boy)
Come on, Gem,
wake your ass up.

53
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,328
Shit, X.

54
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,465
Do what you wanna do,
but I'm still gonna be asleep.

55
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,199
Just turn your
ass over.

56
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,237
(girl)
Ooh!

57
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,572
What y'all doing?

58
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:25,739
Y'all nasty...

59
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:30,244
Stop it, X, why you
always starting stuff with me?

60
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:32,313
Move.

61
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,483
I got to beat y'all asses
day in and day out, huh?

62
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,985
Y'all know I had to wipe 100
old wrinkled asses last night?

63
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,588
The least y'all could do
is let me sleep.

64
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,257
(X)
I live by a few simple rules.

65
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,993
First one: Live in confusion

66
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,629
and never with
a confused mind.

67
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,431
Yeah, uh-huh.

68
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,965
Told you, partner.

69
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,567
That's your
probation officer.

70
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,536
You don't want to go to
school and be somebody?

71
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,937
Okay!

72
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,972
I'm gonna have him
take you down to jail

73
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,574
and put you with your
daddy

74
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,676
so y'all can be
stupid asses together!

75
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,278
You and baby mama ain't
gonna lay up on me

76
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:05,746
like I'm
the hotel keeper.

77
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,681
(baby crying)

78
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,617
Now this baby's up.

79
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,919
Mama, that ain't
his probation officer.

80
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,487
It's some other
white man.

81
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:17,391
*

82
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,525
Now, the way
this thing works is,

83
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,026
I'm the head of all the
schools in the county

84
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,829
and there's not
a one who will let you enroll,

85
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,931
but you four are lucky.

86
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,367
Your probation officers
believe in second chances,

87
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,537
so now consider me
and The Hive

88
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,772
your last chance, fellas.

89
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,841
You can either go to
117 County Farm Road

90
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,843
and learn from the books,

91
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,645
or you can go down to 119
and learn from the crooks.

92
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,115
Trust me.

93
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,817
I'd bet on 117
if I were you.

94
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,709
So are you boys helping us
out or you in trouble?

95
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,747
Now, over there is
the technology room.

96
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,415
We got boys designing their
own video games,

97
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,850
taking computers apart.

98
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,585
State of the art.

99
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,487
They've earned all
the big-screen TVs in there

100
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,155
and the PlayStations,
everything you see.

101
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,090
We partnered
with a DC company.

102
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,059
And then some of the boys take
what they've learned here

103
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,461
and they go back
to Birdie High

104
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,962
and they are
placed in advanced...

105
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,730
(man)
This is neutral ground,
young man.

106
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,966
You don't rep Crip, Blood,

107
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,002
C-Block,
Cherry Lane, 6-8s

108
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,771
or any other gang.

109
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:44,905
It's all Hive
up in here.

110
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,474
Ah, Mr. Hawk.

111
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,108
These four were just telling
me how sorry they were

112
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,943
that they missed
the first week of classes,

113
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,745
but they are happy
to be here now.

114
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,514
Aren't you, gentlemen?

115
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,083
All Hive boys call me
Mr. Hollis.

116
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,751
Any of you
boys have jobs?

117
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,660
Okay, well, in a class that
we like to call Wise Guy,

118
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:10,498
we're gonna be learning how
to fill out job applications.

119
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,599
Your name, sir?

120
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,136
Que.

121
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,671
Que what?

122
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,807
Always introduce yourself
with your entire name.

123
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,176
Que "Kick Your Ass"
Patterson.

124
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,113
Good to meet you,
Mr. Patterson.

125
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,648
Let me tell you something.

126
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,851
You're big, but it
would take you, your mama,

127
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,687
your daddy and his daddy
to kick my ass.

128
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,659
I'm Rack Robinson.

129
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,127
Middle initial "R."

130
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,495
Wow, man.

131
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:44,197
How tall is you?
6-6 and some change.

132
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,733
What kind of
business you in

133
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,868
to pay for all this
razzle-dazzle?

134
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,837
Oh, you know,
it's all legit.

135
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,171
I'm a businessman of
the highest order.

136
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,906
Some people call me C-note

137
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,175
'cause I know about 100 ways
to make them dollar signs.

138
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,578
Well, I'll be
calling you Mr. Robinson.

139
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,648
Wasn't there a Rack Robinson
used to play football?

140
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,015
Yeah, he's supposed
to be my father,

141
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,184
but I ain't
never met him.
His loss.

142
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,218
I'm glad you're here,
Mr. Robinson.

143
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,160
I can come back to you.

144
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,840
Man, why you keep
looking at me like that?

145
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,241
Shaking hands is gay.

146
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,711
And you would know
all about that now, huh?

147
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,746
(Rack laughing)

148
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,548
Consider this, gentlemen.

149
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,183
A real man is one
who is never afraid

150
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,619
to look another man
straight in the eye

151
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,087
and shake his hand,

152
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,055
unless he's hiding
something

153
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,758
or he's
scared of something.

154
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,093
Everybody sign in.

155
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,561
Assembly in five minutes.

156
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:51,999
Hey, big man.

157
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,237
I ain't scared of
nothing.

158
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,740
Especially you.

159
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,208
Oh, really?

160
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,577
Well, the day is still young,
Mr. Whoever You Are.

161
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,916
Gentlemen, please.

162
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:09,917
This way.

163
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,055
*

164
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,228
(woman)
I'm sure you've heard of
Whitmore Investment.

165
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,763
My family
is richer than dirt

166
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,598
but I want more for my life

167
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,000
than identifying
the next investment.

168
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,570
I'd rather invest in kids,
do you know what I mean?

169
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,107
Oh...

170
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,375
Did I tell you that
I got a flat tire in Jersey

171
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,010
and then when I finally
got here,

172
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,712
I couldn't find
the teacher's house?

173
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,651
Here it is.

174
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,819
This is the address
that I had.

175
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,354
Oh, that course is wrong.

176
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,190
You have to get off
at 17, not seven.

177
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,760
Oh, but that's okay,
don't you feel bad about it,

178
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,863
I got a little
ADHD myself.

179
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,631
I'll excuse
your lateness this time,

180
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,933
but just don't make it
a habit.

181
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,802
Excuse me, but I am
an experienced teacher.

182
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,638
Folks are late in these
boys' life all the time.

183
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:08,008
We here at The Hive,
we show up on time.

184
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,677
Sorry.

185
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,211
Did you say that there's
a teacher's supervisor

186
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,013
or a principal
that I could speak to?

187
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,948
I didn't say.

188
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,950
You know, Teachers for America
usually send me

189
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,952
some good people,

190
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,855
so if you come, you gonna
have to come correct.

191
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,157
And if you stay...

192
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,625
you better be sure
and pray.

193
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,898
So... the teacher supervisor
is where?

194
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,199
(chuckling)

195
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,134
Honey, you looking at her.

196
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,738
I am executive director
of The Hive.

197
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,840
Family Resource Center.

198
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,343
Now, there's a washroom
right down that hallway.

199
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,845
I know you may want to
freshen up

200
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,180
because assembly
starts in a few minutes.

201
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,349
You being such an
experienced teacher,

202
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,185
you're gonna want to wash off
that New York face

203
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:55,088
and put on a fresh Hive face.

204
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,957
Now go on, sweetheart,
it's right down there.

205
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,769
(man)
Morning.

206
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,171
Oh!

207
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,906
Some new boys for
The Hive.

208
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,307
Y'all come
on in, fellas.

209
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,809
(man)
I'm late for a meeting,

210
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,745
so I'm gonna leave these
four here with you,

211
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,848
but I'll probably
come back here for a plate.

212
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,716
On second thought...

213
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,384
And don't forget about the
school board meeting tonight.

214
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,286
All right, let me
look at you fellas.

215
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,921
Good-looking young men.

216
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,389
Every last
one of you.

217
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,892
You hungry?
Yes, ma'am, I am,
I'm...

218
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,060
(laughing)

219
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,427
Would be,
the littlest one.

220
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,096
Yeah, but I eats big.

221
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,965
My sister said it
goes straight to my feet.

222
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,099
My feet big.

223
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,433
Oh, I'm in love with you
already.

224
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,369
What's your name?
Courvoisier Carter.

225
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,071
Oh...

226
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,239
I swear on it, it's my
birth significant name.

227
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:50,210
Well, Mr. Courvoisier,
"everything go to my feet,"

228
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,411
you like technology?

229
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,781
Maybe,
but what is that?

230
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,916
Well, you're
gonna find out.

231
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,384
Okay, now, everybody
give me a hug.

232
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,452
We gotta go to assembly
and then tell me your name.

233
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,256
Okay.
I don't
like to be touched.

234
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,826
Well, honey, you're just gonna
have to humor me, young man,

235
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,762
'cause I plan to
love the hell out of you.

236
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,798
They call me Ms. Inez.

237
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,932
And, um...

238
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,934
Oh, yes,
and this is your new

239
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,069
English teacher, Ms. Whitmore.

240
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,404
She's here
all the way from.

241
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,073
Upper East Side Manhattan,
New York.

242
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,776
Did I quote you right,
Ms. Whitmore?
Yeah.

243
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,511
Hi, I'm Parker.

244
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,847
No, no, no.

245
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,982
Please call me
Ms. Whitmore.

246
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:31,384
And I have a lot of fun
things planned for us this year.

247
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,088
Why don't you plan on
sucking my...

248
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,523
(Mrs. Inez)
Oh, no, no!

249
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,291
Don't bring that
kind of hell up in here.

250
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,127
You can get on your
knees too, bitch.

251
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,529
Oh, you done bucked up
to the wrong person!

252
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,431
(clattering)

253
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,969
Now who's the bitch?

254
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,138
Now, you apologize to me
and Ms. Whitmore.

255
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,342
Today, I will listen.

256
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,110
(all)
Today, I will listen.

257
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,046
I will speak.
(all)
I will speak.

258
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,981
I will see.
(all)
I will see.

259
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,816
I will think.
(all)
I will think.

260
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,818
I will feel.
(all)
I will feel.

261
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,954
And I will reason.
(all)
And I will reason.

262
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,056
I am not a no-name
statistic.

263
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,224
(all)
I am not
a no-name statistic.

264
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:14,327
I am a man who is
too smart to waste today.

265
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,830
(all)
I am a man who is
too smart to waste today.

266
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,439
(banging)

267
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,983
Second rule:

268
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,551
Never let disrespect
go without being addressed.

269
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,155
Revenge is like the air.

270
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,426
Always necessary.

271
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,896
(clattering)

272
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,009
(spray paint hissing)

273
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,878
*

274
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,440
*

275
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,090
Look, I already
know the answer.

276
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,658
Please just let me call
the sheriff.

277
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:52,892
(sighing)

278
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,934
Yeah, well, he's typical.

279
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,937
Numerous suspensions
since kindergarten.

280
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:06,573
Stabbed a boy with
a pencil in third grade.

281
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:10,243
Fourth grade, he brought
a BB gun to school,

282
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,345
expelled for kicking
a teacher in the seventh,

283
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,081
was shot in the eighth.

284
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,950
Broke into a neighbor's
trailer last year.

285
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,251
His father's in jail,
awaiting trial

286
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,087
on armed robbery
and manslaughter.

287
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,421
Shall I continue?

288
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,926
Oh, baby, use the coffee pot
in my office.

289
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,031
New kid?

290
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,699
Mm-hmm.

291
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,002
What's the atypical
on him?

292
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,603
Uh...

293
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,039
His reading level's
not bad, fifth grade.

294
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:42,009
Well, he can't spell
worth a damn.

295
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,710
It says here he should
be in his junior year.

296
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,679
He'll be 17
in a couple months

297
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,982
and he's got zero
high school credit.

298
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,317
Oh...

299
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,686
But it does say he has
an aptitude for math.

300
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,490
I knew that boy had
something on the ball.

301
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,193
Look, don't read me
no more.

302
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,162
Baby...

303
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,997
now you go on
out of here.

304
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,666
Have yourself a nice day
at The Hive, all right.

305
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,170
Oh, bless her heart.

306
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,139
She going somewhere
and pray behind this.

307
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,008
You know what?

308
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,044
I gotta give it to
Ms. Christa.

309
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:20,713
She may look terrified,
but at least she's committed.

310
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,083
Now, Ms. Parker
punk rocker?

311
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,384
We may have to
take the hook out of her

312
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,486
and throw her back in
the creek.

313
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,488
Does she ever
even comb her hair?

314
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,524
Ms. Parker,
she got all style.

315
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,992
She just like
these kids.

316
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,530
Just needs somebody
to believe in her.

317
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,366
Well, come on,
drive me over there.

318
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,402
I'm gonna have to lasso in
this crazy mother for ya.

319
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,783
X, there ain't
nothing to eat

320
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,186
and Mama didn't
come home again last night.

321
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,268
Ain't no food stamps
coming for another week.

322
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,379
How many times I gotta tell
y'all to seal this shit up?

323
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,581
Don't you have any money?
Do I look like
I got any damn money?

324
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,218
You know what,
you always crying.

325
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,153
(all shouting)

326
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,587
No, X, don't, don't!

327
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,256
What you gonna do
now, punk, huh?
Stop it, X!

328
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,457
Cryin' little bitch!

329
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,326
(baby crying)

330
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,228
Remember me?

331
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,629
Your worst nightmare.

332
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,564
The black cunt you
can't even spell right.

333
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,107
(girl)
Thank you again,
Mrs. Inez.

334
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,775
I'm sure Mama's at
the grocery store right now.

335
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,278
She usually makes sure
we don't get this low.

336
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,780
Oh, that's
all right, baby.

337
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,350
At The Hive Research Center,
we have a food pantry.

338
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,452
You tell your mama that
nobody in this county

339
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,786
has to go hungry

340
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,156
as long as Mrs. Inez has
something to do with it.

341
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,592
Oh, look at this
little rascal.

342
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,861
He is smart just
like his daddy, ain't he?

343
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,130
Xtra's not smart.

344
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,765
I'm the one doing good
in school.

345
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,833
Oh, I can
see you're smart.

346
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:24,204
What you wanna be
when you grow up?

347
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,838
I don't know.

348
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,740
Just somebody going
somewhere out of here.

349
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,214
Shit, rest in prison
or rest in peace!

350
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,383
We all in the express lane
going towards one of 'em!

351
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,218
You a knucklehead,
you know that?

352
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,321
If it were up to me, you'd
be up under somebody's jail.

353
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:44,291
But Mrs. Inez,
she sees something in you,

354
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,725
and once you root
in her heart,

355
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,161
she ain't
giving up on you.

356
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,362
Even after
what I've done?

357
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:50,897
Even after
what you've done.

358
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,233
But you will make
restitution.

359
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,302
Man, you using
too many big-ass words.

360
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:58,471
Whatever you've done wrong,
you gotta make it right.

361
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,273
Whatever it takes.

362
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,674
You got a son.

363
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,543
You want him fighting
everybody he loves like you?

364
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,346
Man, Deuce
ain't gonna be like me,

365
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,516
'cause I'm the one
raising him.

366
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,750
Yeah, you are.

367
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,352
And kids repeat
what they know

368
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,654
and they do what they see.

369
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,590
So one day he gonna beat
his son and his chest,

370
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,760
the same way
somebody did you.

371
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,329
Is that what you want?

372
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:35,208
Look, we got a punching bag
down at The Hive gym.

373
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,676
It does
wonders for anger.

374
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,183
I ain't no dummy.

375
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:46,586
Remember that.

376
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,358
First time somebody treats
me like a dummy, I'm out.

377
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,403
(Mrs. Inez)
I always keep this around

378
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,706
in case we get a creative
sort, like you.

379
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,916
You see the outside
of The Hive?

380
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,585
All the paint's the same

381
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,820
because we've
never been tagged.

382
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,589
Every OG knows...

383
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,594
Oh... oh, yeah.

384
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:31,731
I got a PhD in your
little gang slang.

385
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,966
(sighing)

386
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,937
The Hive
is neutral territory.

387
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,909
Anybody knows to mess with it
is to ask for STS.

388
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,812
Street takes care of street,

389
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:49,849
and I know you know what kind
of justice I'm talking about.

390
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:54,954
See, you may be a Blood
or a Crip or a 6-8 for life,

391
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,957
but bangin' is always
a choice, boy.

392
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,793
You already
been shot twice.

393
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,595
I know you've heard about
three strikes.

394
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,033
Look, I ain't
afraid to die.
No.

395
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,936
Your type
is afraid to live.

396
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,710
I'll heat you up something
to eat for when you're done.

397
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,612
Oh, just for the record.

398
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,451
"Cunt" is spelled with
a "C," not a "K."

399
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,285
And "pussy"
has two "S"s in it.

400
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,394
So, yesterday, I took
Polaroid pictures

401
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,730
which I scanned to create
your individual stationery.

402
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,900
Now, you should see your picture
in the top right-hand corner.

403
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:44,837
So today, we will continue
to work on your bios, okay?

404
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:48,307
So who completed
the "Who Am I?" survey?

405
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,579
Come on.

406
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,680
"Who are you?"

407
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,382
How hard
can that be?

408
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,517
Age, name, hobbies.

409
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,652
We ain't never seen
a white woman like you.

410
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:00,853
Except on TV.

411
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,655
Is you related to
Lady Gaga or...

412
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:04,391
Do all white women
where you're from

413
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,393
switch up their
style like you do?

414
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,094
Uh... no.

415
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,996
And that's what
this assignment

416
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,831
is about today, gentlemen.

417
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,766
You know, what makes
you unique?

418
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,968
Different from others?

419
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,038
I never wanted to be
like everyone else.

420
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,840
So you in a white woman gang
or something?

421
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,009
(all laughing)

422
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,777
(Que)
Nigga, they don't got
no white woman gangs.

423
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,880
Too busy getting
9-1-1 on speed dial.

424
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,716
And how you know,
fat ass?

425
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,918
You ain't never been
nowhere to see no white women!

426
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,720
Okay.
No women, period!

427
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:34,887
Okay, shh!

428
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:35,888
Just sit down.

429
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,023
Oh, I guess you
getting up.

430
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,092
(Ms. Whitmore)
Stop it!

431
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,561
Guys, stop it!

432
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:42,862
(Mrs. Inez)
Good afternoon!
Stop.

433
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,402
You miss me?

434
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,592
(Ms. Whitmore)
How am I supposed to
teach someone who's...

435
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,761
The harder the child,
the greater the need

436
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,430
to find
a soft place in him.

437
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:20,467
And that ridiculous platitude
is supposed to do what?

438
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,602
Certainly
not reassure me.

439
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,737
Look, there is no way that
I can teach some...

440
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,105
All right.

441
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,774
You're right.

442
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,109
You can't teach
what you don't respect

443
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,845
or what you're
afraid of.

444
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,413
So don't teach him.

445
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:40,152
First, start off
by caring for him.

446
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:43,122
Until these boys know
you care for them,

447
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,791
they won't
care to learn.

448
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,174
(crickets chirping)

449
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,492
Look at you.

450
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,995
You up waiting on
your mama, hmm?

451
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,513
This used to be our
favorite time of the day

452
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:41,981
when you was
a little boy.

453
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,152
Remember?

454
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,488
Yeah.

455
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:54,493
So tell me
all about your dreams.

456
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:01,000
You still dreaming?

457
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,902
Not really.
What you mean?!

458
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,739
Dang, Mama, why you
always gotta hit me?

459
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,176
You're still not going to
that school?

460
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:12,945
Yeah, most times.

461
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:14,881
Well, make it
all the time.

462
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,885
Shit.

463
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,923
I'm thinking about
going back to nursing school

464
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,224
my damn self.

465
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,734
(sighing)

466
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,935
You know, X...

467
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,841
sometimes...

468
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,878
sometimes I don't even
wanna greet the morning.

469
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,248
You know that
ain't me.

470
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,586
Yeah, otherwise you get
backed in the corner

471
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,553
before you know it.

472
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,226
Back me in
the corner?

473
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,761
You know me.

474
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,098
I just come out
fighting.

475
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,201
Yeah.

476
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,106
Mama, don't you ever get
tired of fighting?

477
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,237
*

478
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,644
(humming)

479
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:52,945
(clattering)

480
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,886
(humming)

481
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,153
(clattering)

482
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,129
Who that out there?

483
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:16,669
(Courvoisier)
Mrs. Inez, that thing had to
be about ten feet long.

484
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,337
You should have seen me
get up from under there,

485
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,873
that's what
you should have seen.

486
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:22,675
Now, why would your mother

487
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:25,678
make you sleep
under the porch?

488
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:27,246
She didn't.

489
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,848
You know, my mama,
she lives in

490
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,350
some city named Connecticut.

491
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,086
It's in New York,
I think.

492
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,688
But, you know,
she coming to get me

493
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:39,225
so I can live with her and my
new twin brothers.

494
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,694
See, my stepdaddy
played for the Seahawks,

495
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,429
some name like that.

496
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,898
You know, I got pictures of
him in a magazine he sent me.

497
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:49,869
Come on, I do,
Mrs. Inez.

498
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,138
You know, we got the same
last name and everything.

499
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,076
When the last time
you saw your mother?

500
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:00,212
You know, my sister said
she saw me when I was a baby.

501
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:01,280
Hmm...

502
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,982
What about your
father?

503
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,752
Man, he in the wind.

504
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,388
Half the time,
he think he a helicopter.

505
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,359
You know, he mostly leave
me and my sister

506
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,927
to get along
the best we can,

507
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:17,930
but it's like every day
she yelling about

508
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:19,398
sending me away somewhere.

509
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,102
My mama better hurry up
and come get me, I know that.

510
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:28,274
Did your mama tell you she
was gonna come and get you?

511
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,942
Not exactly, Mrs. Inez,

512
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,244
but you know a mother always
come back for her baby

513
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,312
sooner or later.

514
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,182
Yeah.

515
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,190
Mrs. Inez?
Yeah, baby?

516
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,127
Look, I don't care
what nobody say.

517
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,097
I don't never want
you to put me out of here.

518
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,431
You know, I can tell you
kind of care about me

519
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,100
like my mama would.

520
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,335
You know, real
tender-hearted like.

521
00:28:56,368 --> 00:29:00,039
That's why I'm watching you
so I could learn to cook.

522
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,507
Maybe if I learn to cook,

523
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,111
it wouldn't matter that
I didn't read so good.

524
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,879
How well
do you read now?

525
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,982
Like in the first grade.

526
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:13,786
You know, kids always
laughing at me

527
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,087
for being
little and stupid.

528
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:20,359
Why I'm always fighting.

529
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,861
I mean, I can't help it
when I read,

530
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,362
my letters do jumping jack.

531
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,764
Boy, when the last time
you had your eyes examined?

532
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,201
Never.

533
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,270
'Cause you think in my eyes
they'll be able to tell me

534
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,839
why my brain's so bad?

535
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:35,174
Oh, stop talking
about yourself like that.

536
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,809
You are not dumb

537
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:38,477
and there's nothing wrong
with your brain.

538
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,279
Now go ahead and wash up

539
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,548
and we'll fix you something
real special to eat

540
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,283
and don't you tell nobody

541
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,118
'cause these folks around here
get very jealous

542
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,121
when they found out
I made someone my favorite.

543
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,864
*

544
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,971
(Ms. Whitmore)
How are they ever
gonna catch up?

545
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:10,176
They have...
no critical thinking,

546
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,510
no impulse control.

547
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:18,017
Everything is a joke
or a cause for a fight.

548
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:23,155
Their vocabulary is rudimentary
at best.

549
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,995
They have
no interest or respect

550
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:32,264
for anything
other than...

551
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:35,034
smoking weed...

552
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,903
waving their gang flags

553
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,071
or banging bitches.

554
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:48,114
You know, I'm drinking
right now,

555
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:52,118
so I'm probably not being
very PC at the moment,

556
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,053
but frankly...

557
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,159
they scare me.

558
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,233
You know...

559
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:10,202
I'm starting to believe
that black boys...

560
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,006
really are
innately more violent.

561
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:20,479
How are you
gonna learn anything

562
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:23,082
if you can't even control
yourself?

563
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:28,454
You learn that in
kindergarten, for Christ sakes.

564
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35,361
My hero is my son, Deuce.

565
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:44,270
You're Daddy's hero,
little man.

566
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,408
(man laughing)

567
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:54,513
See, it was that
last rib.

568
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,616
That last rib,
I've got to tell you.

569
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,019
Hey.

570
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,421
How's my little man,
huh?

571
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,256
I thought
you went to work tonight.

572
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,258
They didn't need me.

573
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:10,096
Jake, this here
my oldest boy.

574
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:11,130
How you doing?

575
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,304
Don't he look
just like me?

576
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:19,538
'Cept he ain't as
friendly.

577
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,240
(laughing)

578
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,977
That's his baby boy,
Deuce.

579
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:27,113
Can you believe
I'm a grandma?

580
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,648
Working with all of this?

581
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,384
Girl, this beer running
straight through me.

582
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,186
Daddy gotta
relieve his self.

583
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,022
All right, big Daddy.

584
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,689
Bathroom's straight
back there.
Right back there?

585
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:39,491
Right back there, Daddy.

586
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,327
I'm gonna be with you
in a minute.
All right.

587
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,628
Go, make
yourself at home.

588
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,330
You coming?
Oh no.

589
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,065
(laughing)

590
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,367
We gonna go round for round,
round for round.

591
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,668
Don't you
keep me waiting!

592
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,341
(door closing)

593
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,709
Here, go to the store
and buy some milk,

594
00:32:57,743 --> 00:33:00,412
cereal, eggs,
lunchmeat and bread.

595
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,148
That ought to hold us
for a minute.

596
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:10,489
I got fired tonight.

597
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,191
Patient
said I was stealing.

598
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,193
He crazy.

599
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,062
But that damn supervisor
believed him over me.

600
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:18,497
(Jake)
Billie!

601
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:24,370
Be there in a minute!

602
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,205
Hold on!

603
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,375
Mama, you know I been going
to that Hive school all week.

604
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,543
You have?

605
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,179
You like it?
Yeah, it's straight.

606
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,047
Long.

607
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:36,715
I don't get out of
there 'til 6:00!
Billie!

608
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,218
But they got computers there
and they're gonna teach me

609
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,252
how to take one apart.

610
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,057
You even earn points
for showing up.

611
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,092
See, look.

612
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,427
It's called an incentive.

613
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,062
They gonna take us
to some Bobcat games

614
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:52,198
if we earn enough points.

615
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,432
Take us on some
other trips, too.

616
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,407
They got you
reading this?
Billie!

617
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,143
Yeah, some slavery book
for social studies.

618
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:06,645
Billie, bring that
ass on in here, baby.

619
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:10,249
Be there in a minute,
Daddy.

620
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,718
Hold on now,
get ready for me now.

621
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,125
I know you ain't
judging me.

622
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,695
How else am I gonna
feed your asses, huh?

623
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:27,299
That's my slavery.

624
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,500
Billie!

625
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,602
Baby, please!

626
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,471
Baby, I'm coming, baby.

627
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,140
Come on, baby.

628
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,144
Hold on, big Daddy!

629
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,411
Ha-ha-ha!

630
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,614
Got my live-and-die-by rules,

631
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:45,217
but ain't never came up with
one that works for Mama.

632
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,388
Women, period.

633
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,658
That's why I don't
like to feel nothing.

634
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,128
Way too much work to
love somebody

635
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,297
and hate 'em
at the same time.

636
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,499
*

637
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,142
(giggling)

638
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:24,156
Extra points will be given for
the best invitation design.

639
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,658
Now you can go
online and get some ideas.

640
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:29,461
But I want the focus to be on
The Hive invitation dinner

641
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,463
for your families.

642
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,665
The dinner's gonna be here
at The Hive,

643
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,368
so to give you a chance
to show what you've learned

644
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:37,736
and also get you prepared

645
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,506
for the big school board banquet
in November

646
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,774
in which you will be
the student hosts and servers.

647
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,775
Mr. Hollis?

648
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,411
Yes.

649
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:48,580
I just wanna say, if you need
an emcee of ceremonies,

650
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:51,183
I'm your man.

651
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:52,484
Are you ready to
write a speech?

652
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:53,852
Already written.

653
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,487
Oscar, Grammy.

654
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,223
MTV, BET.

655
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,258
I'm ready to
orate on any day.

656
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,659
Anytime on your dime.

657
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,194
(all laughing)

658
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:05,797
Ladies and gentlemen,
holla back at Mr. Rack!

659
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,536
I'll keep you in mind,
Mr. Robinson.

660
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,671
(yawning)

661
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,607
Oh, my God.

662
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,343
I'm sorry but
it's after 4:00,

663
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:20,779
and my body says that school's
supposed to be over.

664
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,714
If you plan to
achieve grade level for all

665
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:23,949
your subjects,
Mr. Keys,

666
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,451
you will need to
fully participate in

667
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,885
the afterschool program.

668
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,355
I'm already at my
grade level, bitch.

669
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,822
(all)
Ooh...

670
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,597
Please refrain from using
profanity in my class,

671
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,467
because
I can assure you...

672
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,901
I am not your bitch.

673
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,537
(all)
Ooh...

674
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:48,707
And now since you've
disturbed everyone,

675
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,410
why don't you come up here and
read your grade level for us.

676
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,711
Wow.
Shh!

677
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:13,299
(clearing throat)

678
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:21,707
"Even as a..."

679
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,813
"you..."

680
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,981
Youth.
Youth.

681
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,883
"Youth..."

682
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,355
"Tupac...

683
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,624
die..."

684
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,526
"Tupac discerned."

685
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,294
"discerned..."

686
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:50,602
"the price paid
for..."

687
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,773
"revo..."

688
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,480
Revolutionary.

689
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:02,981
"Revolutionary."

690
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:09,688
"And then
the people say

691
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:14,493
"I'm trying to make
a dollar out of

692
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,328
(school bell ringing)
15 cents."

693
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:19,698
Oh, look at my boys,
all working hard!

694
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,067
Well, if y'all hungry, I got
some collard greens heated

695
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,802
and some hot corn bread

696
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:27,473
and some fresh baked cookies,
so come on with me.

697
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,059
You can take
your break now.

698
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,541
*

699
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,098
Why you do that for?

700
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:28,900
You knew I wasn't
reading the right words.

701
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:39,878
Yes.

702
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,050
But I respected your
resourcefulness.

703
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,789
Why you lying?

704
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,560
Look, every boy at
The Hive looks up to you.

705
00:39:57,596 --> 00:40:00,932
And one day,

706
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:03,769
I'm hoping that you will
channel

707
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:06,472
your considerable
gifts for their good

708
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:07,739
as well as your own.

709
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:11,743
You have chutzpah.

710
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:15,080
I'll give you that.

711
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:18,149
That ain't foreign for
calling me a "nigger"

712
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:20,185
on the sly, is it?

713
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,587
No.

714
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,757
Look it up.

715
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:31,597
C-H-U-T-Z-P-A-H.

716
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,500
It's a Yiddish word.

717
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,168
Describes you perfectly.

718
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,529
(Que)
Mrs. Inez,
I'm trying a diet,

719
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,497
so how many calories
you think be in

720
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:07,666
corn bread and greens?

721
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,501
Boy, I don't know.

722
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:11,770
But try eating
with your mouth closed

723
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,171
and take smaller portions.

724
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,240
Every time I see you going
through the line,

725
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,908
you heaping up
food on your plate

726
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:20,178
like you can eat three times
Mr. Hollis.

727
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,213
I heard that.

728
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:25,884
I'm cutting hair out back
for the next hour or so.

729
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:29,054
Some of you guys' naps
look like they need tending.

730
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,022
So if you're caught up
with your schoolwork,

731
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,157
meet me out back.

732
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,161
Oh, Lord.

733
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:38,930
That was yummy.

734
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:41,199
I've never had
stewed greens before.

735
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,201
Que?

736
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,170
Hi, could I see you
outside for a minute?

737
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,105
(boy 1) Mm-mm.
(boy 2) Uh-oh.

738
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,775
Oh, hush, y'all,
now go on, finish eating.

739
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:51,677
Stay out of other
folks' business.

740
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,213
Ahh!

741
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,514
What'd I tell you?

742
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:19,104
"I am...

743
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,707
"am a...

744
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,076
"multi...

745
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,978
"ti...

746
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:28,947
ti..."

747
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,116
The word is
"multitalented."

748
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,986
You plagiarized it.

749
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,221
I know you
didn't write it, Que,

750
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,924
and I do not tolerate
cheaters.

751
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:40,091
Do you understand?

752
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:46,264
I only did it because I don't
have that many points earned,

753
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:49,000
but I really
want to go on the trip.

754
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,937
Ms. Whitmore, I've never
been anywhere

755
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,906
except two miles
each way from here.

756
00:42:56,975 --> 00:43:00,612
I don't want to go to
another foster home.

757
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:02,147
Please.

758
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,750
I'm asking you.

759
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,251
Don't tell on me.

760
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,320
Please.

761
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:18,630
(Xtra)
Chutz...

762
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,902
Chutz... chutz...

763
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,008
Chutzpah.

764
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,278
Chutzpah.

765
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:36,114
"Shameless...

766
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:39,317
audacity..."

767
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,652
Audacity?

768
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:45,824
Audacity.

769
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,933
"The willingness to take
bold risk."

770
00:43:57,836 --> 00:43:59,838
Yeah, that's me.

771
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,639
Bold like a motherfucker.

772
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,176
(man)
I'll never disparage books,

773
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,346
but, y'know, I've had some of
my most meaningful connection

774
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,816
with the boys
on the basketball court.

775
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:13,218
I'm a teacher,
Aden, not a jock,

776
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:16,955
and basketball worship is
part of their problem.

777
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,158
Their only aspiration is
to be in the NBA or the NFL

778
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:22,728
and probably none of them
will make it.

779
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:29,134
*

780
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,853
You know, you the only one to
ever see what Daddy created.

781
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,355
Check it out.

782
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:56,027
You like it?

783
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,262
Now I'm gonna take it
and get it printed out

784
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:58,296
so your granddaddy
can see it.

785
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,031
(Deuce cooing)
Yeah.

786
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:06,772
(cell door rattling)

787
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:17,415
You ain't got no love
for your daddy?

788
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:19,117
You ain't seen
your daddy in two months

789
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,752
and you ain't got no love
for your daddy?

790
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:21,753
Come here, boy.

791
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:25,924
Boy... huh?

792
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:30,261
Your mama must get mad
every time she see you.

793
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:32,730
She carry you, I sure enough
spit you out, though, huh?

794
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,167
True that.

795
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,436
She says I'm you
inside out.

796
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,839
Yeah, yeah?
Yeah?

797
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:42,273
Yeah.

798
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:43,741
How come you
going soft?

799
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:48,246
I'm not.

800
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:52,483
Just been kind of
going to this new school.

801
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:54,119
I was gonna show
you this.

802
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,923
See, at the school
that I'm going to,

803
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:59,290
they're
teaching me technology,

804
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:03,128
and how to live in the world
like a man.

805
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,462
Mm-hmm.

806
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,131
Ain't no school
can do you that.

807
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:07,765
That's my job.

808
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:10,802
How's your leg?

809
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:15,140
It's okay.

810
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,142
Doctor said
I lucked out.

811
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:19,978
Just missed my artery.
Yeah?

812
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,280
Luck ain't got
nothing to do with it.

813
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:24,449
You got my blood running
all through you.

814
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:27,318
Bullet can't do
nothing but ricochet on you.

815
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:30,521
(laughing)

816
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:32,357
Keep on laughing through
this thing I'm gonna tell ya.

817
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,458
I'm gonna tell you a little

818
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:34,893
something-something,
all right?

819
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:37,528
I heard you
been messing up, huh?

820
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:39,998
You're not handling your
business out on the street.

821
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:42,100
You been breaking the rules
and shit, huh?

822
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,401
Maybe it's
this so-called school

823
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,470
that you've been going to,
huh?

824
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,338
Keep on smiling
through this thing.

825
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:48,974
Smile through it.

826
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:49,975
Yes.

827
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:51,509
That's it.

828
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,244
Now, what'd I tell you about
these peckerwoods out here,

829
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:54,880
white people?

830
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:57,548
Huh, playing puppet games
on your head, turn you soft.

831
00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:59,350
The folks that are running
The Hive are black.

832
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:00,886
Oh, yeah.

833
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:03,021
Well, you know, niggas,
they good with delusion.

834
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:04,122
Huh?

835
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,192
Look at this.

836
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:08,459
See?

837
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:13,031
She drew that
for you.

838
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:14,199
You see that?

839
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:16,935
Look at that,
look at that.

840
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:20,105
Creek, pond,
they got a dead tree on it.

841
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,107
(laughing)

842
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,909
That's nice.

843
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:25,276
Uh-huh.

844
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,445
So when you take
the shovel out there, son,

845
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:32,217
stick it in, for yourself,
not for nobody else.

846
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,885
I need some
money up in here.

847
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,425
Anything else?

848
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,193
What, I thought you were
gonna show me something?

849
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,098
Nah.

850
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:48,099
It's nothing.

851
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:56,341
All right.

852
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:06,551
Careful, Mr. Hollis.

853
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,486
Messing with my
glad rags!

854
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,055
I worked hard
to look this good.

855
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:11,422
Boy, what kind of weed
are you smoking

856
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:14,225
where it makes you can
never shut your damn mouth?

857
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:16,061
That sheriff only needed half
an excuse to charge you

858
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:17,495
with possession.

859
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,297
The only reason he didn't
because you part of The Hive

860
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,499
and Mrs. Inez went to
bat for you.
What?

861
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:23,268
Possession, me?

862
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:26,104
I don't smoke
no marijuana.

863
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:29,007
But I do engage in
a little bit of commerce.

864
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,608
You like my compound word?
Get out of here.

865
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:45,290
*

866
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,368
Oh, man, Xtra.

867
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:59,137
This is good.

868
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,107
You know, you got a real
knack for design.

869
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,011
I took it
to show my father,

870
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:08,146
but...

871
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,248
he had other things
on his mind.

872
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:15,053
I guess
I should tell you now

873
00:49:15,086 --> 00:49:17,422
I ain't coming back to
The Hive no more.
Why?

874
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,291
You've been
doing so well.

875
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:23,028
You cool people,
Mr. Hollis,

876
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:26,397
but where I come from,
stink still lives on shit.

877
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:29,467
Xtra, you know why
I like your name?

878
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,669
Because you got
a whole lot of extra.

879
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,472
Extra smarts, extra talent.

880
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:37,475
And extra capacity
to lead others.

881
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:40,311
It only takes one bright
light to lead out of darkness,

882
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:42,547
and that's what you can be
for the other boys.

883
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,350
And with you
and only you,

884
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,018
I definitely see college.

885
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,355
I took one of
the laptops.

886
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:51,489
Oh, I know.

887
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:55,593
I got eyes all over
The Hive.

888
00:49:57,262 --> 00:50:01,232
You broke the honor code,
but I'm proud of you.

889
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:03,368
Not for the stealing part,

890
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,303
but because you told
the truth like a man.

891
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:10,241
I'll make you a deal.

892
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:13,078
You come in Monday early
with that computer,

893
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:15,213
and we'll consider
you had a special permission

894
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:17,048
for a weekend loan-out.

895
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:20,518
You gonna
use my design?

896
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:23,221
I doubt if one comes in
any better.

897
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:27,558
But you will also
write me a letter of apology

898
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:30,228
with a signed promise that you
won't steal from The Hive

899
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,063
ever again.

900
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:33,798
So don't let me down.

901
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:37,202
'Cause, boy, if you don't
show up with that computer,

902
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,536
I will hunt you down

903
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:40,738
and deliver you to
the jailhouse myself.

904
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:50,548
(crying)

905
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:00,391
Xtra, you okay?

906
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:02,727
Why don't you just stop
playing puppet with my head?!

907
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,195
I ain't never gonna
be nothing!

908
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:16,407
(frogs croaking)

909
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:19,244
*

910
00:51:30,355 --> 00:51:32,423
(car approaching)

911
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:34,292
(police radio chatter)

912
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,353
(zipper unzipping)

913
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:26,844
*

914
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,480
*

915
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:05,550
(Rack)
Hey!

916
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:08,853
What you up to?

917
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:16,961
Life's been good.

918
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:19,264
And business
even better!

919
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:20,531
Got a little extra.

920
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,902
Hey, let's go
find us a party.

921
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,571
Nah, man.

922
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:28,205
I got something else
I gotta do.

923
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:33,944
What, man,
I gotta do my laundry.

924
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:36,447
So you're at
the gas station?

925
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:38,716
Come on, man.

926
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:41,919
You gotta think about what
Mr. Hollis call it.

927
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,921
You know,
the repercussions.

928
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,623
Shit, nigga, when you ever
start talking about

929
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:47,292
some repercussions?

930
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:50,495
Nigga, just now.

931
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:51,629
Here.

932
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,566
Here, take this.

933
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,001
Man, take it,
'cause I don't want you to

934
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:59,337
have to shoot me tonight.
Stop, I'm good, man.

935
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,438
You will, nigga,
'cause I ain't gonna

936
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:02,407
let you mess yourself up.

937
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:06,411
Shit, if I had half the brains
that you got,

938
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:08,913
I wouldn't be out here
selling this shit every night.

939
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:11,616
I'd be an astronaut,

940
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:12,750
or like that California doctor
Miss Christa

941
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,419
be telling us about.

942
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:15,953
You know, the one that
drill holes in your brain.

943
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,955
Yeah, Dr. Benjamin Carson.

944
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,491
He's a neurosurgeon, man.

945
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:21,792
See, that's what
I'm saying.

946
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:23,594
You don't forget shit.

947
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:28,599
I'm gonna keep it 100.

948
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:29,834
I ain't never
seen a nigga

949
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,303
that got a computer mind
like you do.

950
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,042
So you gonna have to
step over me tonight,

951
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:41,346
'cause I'm gonna be laid out
in that gas station doorway

952
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:43,748
if you insist on
doing your laundry.

953
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:50,621
Don't aim for
my face, though,

954
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:51,989
'cause I'm gonna need all
kinds of women

955
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,625
crying over my
casket, like, "Rack!"

956
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,427
Rack!"

957
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:06,471
(Gem)
Your new friend sure
got plenty of money.

958
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,808
We could have us
a car like that.

959
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,513
Maybe I need to go to
a Hive school for girls.

960
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,019
Why you looking at me
like that?

961
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:27,358
I used to be
good in school.

962
00:55:27,392 --> 00:55:28,993
I'll try again if
you wanted me to.

963
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,863
If I wanted you to?

964
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:34,732
Damn, Gem.

965
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:37,702
You got a mind, why don't
you think for yourself?

966
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,005
Ever since you been
going to that school,

967
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:42,573
it's like I ain't
good enough.

968
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:46,877
You don't want me
no more, do you?

969
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:52,116
I'm letting you
live here, ain't I?

970
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:53,518
You?

971
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:55,453
Since when you
paying the rent?

972
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:57,688
(Rack)
Hey, I'm gonna take a little of
this pizza with me,

973
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:59,957
but I left most of
it in there for y'all.

974
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,026
I can order more for y'all
if y'all want before I go.

975
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,035
All right.

976
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:15,773
No.

977
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:19,109
*

978
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:35,726
Hey, I gotta
go chase that paper.

979
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:38,729
Hey, this was
a good time, man.

980
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:46,403
*

981
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,741
If we still alive,
see you at The Hive.

982
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,612
Rack!

983
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:55,780
Baby, come dance
with me.

984
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,590
Go ahead, man.

985
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,167
(Rack)
You know,
I really gotta go.

986
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:19,670
Come on, give me a quick
little two-step, come on.

987
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:23,440
Come on, you got...

988
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,912
(laughing)

989
00:57:32,517 --> 00:57:35,152
That's why I hate the weekend.

990
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,454
No good ever comes to me
on the weekend.

991
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:41,659
I'm trying to remember
what Mr. Hollis said

992
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,728
about believing in me

993
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:45,863
and me going to
college

994
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:49,133
and what my dad said
about me playing the game,

995
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:51,969
and Mama, who I know
loves me,

996
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,671
but...

997
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:56,541
She got a whole
lotta "but" s.

998
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:59,844
And Rack with his crazy ass
talking about repercussions

999
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:02,246
and Gem...

1000
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:04,148
needing everything
I can't give her.

1001
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:15,893
During the week
at The Hive, life has order.

1002
00:58:17,562 --> 00:58:18,529
It makes sense.

1003
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:29,006
(cupboard creaking)

1004
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:36,180
On the weekends,
nothing ever does.

1005
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:39,083
*

1006
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:51,028
(zipper unzipping)

1007
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,939
*

1008
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:36,006
*

1009
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,274
(bell ringing)

1010
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,309
Sounds like somebody's
pies are ready.

1011
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:01,165
In Jesus' name!

1012
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:03,133
Amen.

1013
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:04,268
Boy.

1014
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:11,608
Oh, my goodness.

1015
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,362
Mm-hmm.

1016
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:37,968
Your release hand
is bad.

1017
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:41,171
Use your other
hand as your guide hand.

1018
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:42,306
Okay.

1019
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,321
Whoop.

1020
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:01,191
That's why you're
the teacher.

1021
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:03,828
Ms. Whitmore,
can I ask you a question?

1022
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:06,063
How come you changed
how you looked to

1023
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:07,998
look like
everybody else?

1024
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:11,235
I mean, I liked the way
you were different

1025
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:12,703
and unique in yourself.

1026
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:18,108
I didn't copy that.

1027
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:19,877
And I worked on it
all weekend.

1028
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,786
(Que)
My grandfather
always telling me

1029
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:32,122
to trust my gut...

1030
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:34,358
but he don't know my gut
sometimes lies.

1031
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,828
Like a double-headed snake.

1032
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:42,733
Even though I ain't never seen
one of them.

1033
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:44,902
I want to be good

1034
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:48,739
and not lie or cheat

1035
01:01:48,773 --> 01:01:52,142
or do any of
the bad things I do,

1036
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:53,978
'cause I like The Hive.

1037
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:58,248
And the teachers
who teach me to think

1038
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:01,085
and talk like people on TV

1039
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:03,921
and Mrs. Inez

1040
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:06,924
and Mr. Hollis,

1041
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:09,994
they like a mama
and a daddy

1042
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:11,762
to us who ain't got that.

1043
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,266
See...

1044
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,036
I ain't never been able to
hold on to no family.

1045
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,907
They always
leaving me behind.

1046
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,308
But, Ms. Whitmore,

1047
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:27,444
please don't let it
happen to me again.

1048
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:32,950
I need you to teach me
how to express myself better

1049
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:34,952
so people don't always
leave me behind.

1050
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:40,324
I know you somebody
I can learn from

1051
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:43,127
'cause you're unique

1052
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,761
and different in
yourself.

1053
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:49,433
P.S.

1054
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:53,403
This took me 11 hours
and 37 minutes to write...

1055
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,942
and then check all
the spelling.

1056
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:02,112
The end.

1057
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:06,516
Que.

1058
01:03:27,371 --> 01:03:28,472
Man, what you
looking at?

1059
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:32,309
Can you... help me
with my homework?

1060
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:36,981
Kids at school,

1061
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:38,348
they laugh at
how I read

1062
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:41,518
and... I want
to quit school.

1063
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,021
Listen, first off, you don't
ever quit something

1064
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:45,489
because of somebody else.

1065
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,091
You hear me?

1066
01:03:47,124 --> 01:03:48,926
It takes chutzpah
to keep going at something

1067
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,028
when it's easier
to quit.

1068
01:03:52,897 --> 01:03:54,098
Yeah, look it up.

1069
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:55,332
Here.

1070
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:57,601
Here's a dictionary.

1071
01:03:57,634 --> 01:04:00,204
Now, go get
your books.

1072
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:03,407
You read, I'll listen.

1073
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,342
Now hurry up, come on,
'cause we gotta get to school.

1074
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,484
(Mr. Hollis)
All right.

1075
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,053
Good morning.

1076
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:18,222
I got some more awards points
to give out.

1077
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:21,225
I'd like to tell you

1078
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:23,928
we've reached the halfway
semester point

1079
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:26,363
and we've almost earned our
overnight stay to Charlotte

1080
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:27,998
to see the Bobcats.

1081
01:04:33,938 --> 01:04:35,539
All right, all right.

1082
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:37,942
Okay, okay.

1083
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:41,611
For perfect attendance...

1084
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:44,014
Courvoisier Carter,
50 points.

1085
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:50,287
(boy)
That's right,
little bro.

1086
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,956
Congratulations,
Mr. Carter.

1087
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,192
(all clapping)

1088
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,429
All right,
just two more.

1089
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:03,433
For always being meticulously
pressed and dressed.

1090
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:05,970
(all)
Rack Robinson!

1091
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:14,144
Congratulations,
Mr. Robinson.
Thank you, Mr. Hollis.

1092
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:15,612
Yeah.

1093
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:20,150
And our last award goes to

1094
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:22,619
someone who has
demonstrated

1095
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,622
not only competence
in math and technology,

1096
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:28,292
but has also exceeded his own
personal goals.

1097
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:33,097
Xtra Keys, 100 points.

1098
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,432
(applauding)

1099
01:05:44,408 --> 01:05:46,310
Good job, Mr. Keys.

1100
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:48,078
*

1101
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,583
You the man, Xtra Keys!

1102
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,990
(Mr. Hollis)
All right, settle down.

1103
01:06:00,024 --> 01:06:01,491
I was watching
a weekend special,

1104
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:04,394
talking about the state of
African-American boys.

1105
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:05,996
Talk about depressing.

1106
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:07,664
That's why I don't
watch the news.

1107
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,500
(all laughing)

1108
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:11,668
I don't need nobody
broadcasting

1109
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,437
how messed up
my life is.

1110
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:17,107
Like I don't know.

1111
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:18,508
Come on, man.

1112
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:22,012
What was alarming was them
saying that white boys

1113
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:25,615
your same age are twice as
likely to graduate than you.

1114
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:29,553
So you know what
that means.

1115
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:32,589
What it means is,
Mr. Hollis,

1116
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:34,258
it means we don't count.

1117
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,493
(all laughing)

1118
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:45,402
Gentlemen!

1119
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,742
Teachers, will you
excuse us, please?

1120
01:06:52,776 --> 01:06:55,345
We're about to have a special
Wise Guy.

1121
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:07,391
All right.

1122
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:10,394
Half of you over here
and half right here, come on.

1123
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:11,695
Move.

1124
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:22,539
Okay now,
where I put these chairs,

1125
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,675
we're gonna call it, to use
Courvoisier's words,

1126
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,311
"The No-count Corner."

1127
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:30,080
So this half of the room,
the laughing 50% of you

1128
01:07:30,114 --> 01:07:31,581
that won't graduate school,

1129
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:33,750
get to stepping to
"The No-count Corner."

1130
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:36,253
Come on, dropouts, step in
the corner where you belong.

1131
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:37,621
Come on, let's go.

1132
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:39,289
Come on, move,
y'all moving too slow.

1133
01:07:39,323 --> 01:07:40,724
Move!

1134
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:42,359
Get in there, get in there.

1135
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:49,766
Not so funny now,
is it?

1136
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52,169
Don't you
dare move an inch.

1137
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:53,603
Don't sit.

1138
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:55,272
Don't lean.

1139
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,441
Don't move a chair.

1140
01:07:57,474 --> 01:08:00,744
You made the choice,
so stand there and represent.

1141
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:02,612
Come on, no-counts!

1142
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:04,681
And get used to
that label,

1143
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,616
'cause somebody's
gonna be calling you that

1144
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:10,354
and telling you what to do for
the rest of your lives!

1145
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:12,122
Hey, Mr. Hollis,
there ain't enough room!

1146
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,591
And what do you want me to
do about that?!

1147
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:16,126
You made that choice,

1148
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,562
so stand there
and deal with it!

1149
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,770
Okay, those of you who
are left standing,

1150
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,772
5% are gonna go to college.

1151
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:30,207
There's only
ten of us left.

1152
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,475
That's a half a person

1153
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:32,542
unless you base it on
the percentage

1154
01:08:32,576 --> 01:08:33,610
of everybody in here.

1155
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:35,179
You come over here.

1156
01:08:35,212 --> 01:08:37,814
Since you so smart,
you stand right there

1157
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,783
as our one and only
college-bound.

1158
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:41,451
Okay, now those
of you still standing,

1159
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:43,153
half of y'all going to prison,

1160
01:08:43,187 --> 01:08:45,689
so you five, get to
stepping to the no-count corner

1161
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,891
and assume the position.

1162
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:49,659
That's right, raise your hands
in the air

1163
01:08:49,693 --> 01:08:51,595
'cause you about to
spend the rest of your life

1164
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,163
being friends.

1165
01:08:53,197 --> 01:08:54,731
Get to the corner,
come on, all y'all.

1166
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:58,802
I said, crowd in the corner,
gentlemen!

1167
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:01,171
'Cause that's what
it's gonna be like in prison.

1168
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:03,173
Overcrowded.

1169
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:05,409
And that's what your families
are gonna feel,

1170
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:08,912
'cause they couldn't count on
you to do something different,

1171
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:11,215
to be something other than
a statistic.

1172
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,520
Now don't you
dare move an inch!

1173
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:18,188
And if you feel like fighting,

1174
01:09:18,222 --> 01:09:19,389
you're gonna have to
fight me first

1175
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:21,157
and I mean that.

1176
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:25,362
Okay.

1177
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:27,764
So there's four of you left and
our one college man over there.

1178
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,799
Since you two will likely
kill the other two

1179
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,401
or die by some violence,

1180
01:09:31,435 --> 01:09:33,770
let's just do this as random
as your choices.

1181
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:36,206
All four of you join
your comrades in the corner.

1182
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,507
Come on, go.

1183
01:09:40,244 --> 01:09:42,746
You want me
to play "D"?

1184
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:43,847
Okay.

1185
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:49,886
So how does it feel to be

1186
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:51,688
the only one
destined to make it?

1187
01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:55,259
I don't know
how I feel.

1188
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:57,627
'Cause I don't
feel for nobody.

1189
01:09:57,661 --> 01:09:59,696
I just know it ain't fair
for me to be over here

1190
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:02,732
and for all of them to be
over there in the corner.

1191
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:04,968
I mean, part of
me wants to make it,

1192
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,470
the other part wants to
be over there

1193
01:10:06,503 --> 01:10:07,871
with who I know
and what I know.

1194
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,708
Really?

1195
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,545
How many of you want to
take Xtra's place?

1196
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:20,384
You just a lot.

1197
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:22,986
Put your
damn hands down!

1198
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:24,921
'Cause even if given
the opportunity,

1199
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:28,258
you gonna crawl right
back to what you know!

1200
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:30,494
To what feels familiar,

1201
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,228
and that's being
a bottom-feeder!

1202
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:35,932
Laughing at yourselves,

1203
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,834
perpetrating you
in charge of something

1204
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,636
and you ain't in charge
of one damn thing.

1205
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:41,371
Not even yourself!

1206
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,675
Anybody still laughing?
(all)
No sir.

1207
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:46,743
I can't hear you!

1208
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:48,412
(all)
No sir!

1209
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:53,283
All right, now take your
behinds back to your seats.

1210
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:58,422
You definitely don't give a damn
about your past, gentlemen.

1211
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:01,291
It only cares about the choices
you are making right now,

1212
01:11:01,325 --> 01:11:03,927
all of which
add up to your future.

1213
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,997
Now let's see if we can't get
this day started correctly.

1214
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,966
It didn't get wrong overnight

1215
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:13,036
and you certainly ain't
gonna get it right overnight.

1216
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:15,839
So let's start the day
over with a purpose.

1217
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:18,942
I believe in myself and my
ability to do my best.

1218
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:21,645
(all)
I believe in myself
and my ability to do my best.

1219
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:23,647
Louder!

1220
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,649
(all)
I believe in myself and my
ability to do my best!

1221
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:27,617
Louder!

1222
01:11:27,651 --> 01:11:29,819
(all)
I believe in myself and my
ability to do my best!

1223
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:52,609
(clearing throat)

1224
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,715
I wasn't trying to
scare you,

1225
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:00,417
I just wanted to
know if you had any books

1226
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,553
for really little kids?

1227
01:12:03,587 --> 01:12:05,088
But it's okay, I can just
go ask Ms. Christa.

1228
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:07,557
No!

1229
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:08,825
Come in.

1230
01:12:22,406 --> 01:12:24,574
I'm in school almost
nine hours a day.

1231
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:27,511
And it's paying off.

1232
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:30,113
Your reading has
vastly improved.

1233
01:12:30,146 --> 01:12:31,748
You're almost at
an eighth-grade level.

1234
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,554
First I was just trying to
read to my son,

1235
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:39,355
but now
I got this brother...

1236
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:42,392
He's struggling, too.

1237
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,862
He's kind of
nervous-like.

1238
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:47,964
Cries all the time.

1239
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:49,065
I don't really
want him to know that

1240
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:50,767
I can't read that good.

1241
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,069
Okay, wait here.

1242
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:54,604
I got something
in the car.

1243
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:10,119
*

1244
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,761
Only way to
get better at reading

1245
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:19,829
is to read all the time,

1246
01:13:19,863 --> 01:13:21,097
all kinds of books,

1247
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:24,067
not just the ones
assigned here at The Hive.

1248
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:31,140
When do I have to
give them back?

1249
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,109
You don't.

1250
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:35,445
Not for a while,
anyway.

1251
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:38,482
I bought them
with my own money.

1252
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:41,618
You're the first boy...

1253
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:43,753
Young man...

1254
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:45,955
who might
really read them.

1255
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:54,798
Why you doing all
this for me?

1256
01:13:54,831 --> 01:13:57,033
I thought
you hated me.

1257
01:13:57,066 --> 01:13:58,902
I never hated you.

1258
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:06,810
Don't take this
the wrong way.

1259
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:09,813
I kind of like the way that
you got your hair right now,

1260
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:12,682
all crazy-like.

1261
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:13,917
You look fresh.

1262
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:20,490
Uh... so,
speaking of fresh,

1263
01:14:20,524 --> 01:14:22,659
I have a proposition
for you.

1264
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:26,663
What would you think about
starting a school newspaper?

1265
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,498
It would help you boys
with reading and writing

1266
01:14:28,532 --> 01:14:31,635
as well as show the community
how we do it at The Hive.

1267
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:38,808
Okay.
Okay.

1268
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:40,243
Yeah.

1269
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:41,811
Call it "The Buzz."

1270
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:49,953
Excuse me.

1271
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:56,860
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

1272
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,995
only one "horse" d'oeurve
a piece, fellas.

1273
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:00,530
You ain't
gotta be so greedy.

1274
01:15:00,564 --> 01:15:03,232
Excuse me, you all have
as many as you want.

1275
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:05,068
Courvoisier...

1276
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:06,603
the food is here
for them.

1277
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:08,872
It's not just
to sit and look pretty.

1278
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:11,107
And the word is
"hors d'oeuvres."

1279
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,141
There's no "horse" in it.

1280
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:18,882
Mrs. Inez, my sister
ain't coming.

1281
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:21,618
I don't
think she coming.

1282
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:22,819
You think she coming?

1283
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:28,792
*

1284
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:30,560
Aw, shit.

1285
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:33,062
Excuse...
Shoot.

1286
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:35,064
I forgot something in
the kitchen, I'm...

1287
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:37,901
Boy, you better go
and greet your father.

1288
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:39,202
Do you know how
many boys here

1289
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:41,971
wish that their
father had shown up?

1290
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:43,573
Now, he may look
a little torn up,

1291
01:15:43,607 --> 01:15:46,710
but he is still
your father.

1292
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:48,211
Take him to that closet
and get him some clothes,

1293
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:49,779
a clean shirt,

1294
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:51,080
but first, you're gonna
go over there

1295
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:52,916
and tell him how
happy you are he came.

1296
01:15:58,622 --> 01:15:59,923
I said go.

1297
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,257
Use your feet to
pray the way.

1298
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:06,262
Yo, Pops.

1299
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:15,905
Pops.

1300
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:26,916
*

1301
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:44,100
When you get glasses?

1302
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:46,736
Mrs. Inez took me to
the eye doctor.

1303
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:53,276
Sorry I ain't get
all dressed up for you.

1304
01:16:58,081 --> 01:16:59,949
I hope I didn't
embarrass you, man.

1305
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:03,019
I'll wait for you
outside.

1306
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:04,788
No, no.

1307
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:08,291
No, I'm glad you came.

1308
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:13,830
You too, Tina.

1309
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,335
Come on.

1310
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,337
I got something
I want to show you.

1311
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:26,910
(Rack)
Looks like you and me the only
ones that ain't got nobody.

1312
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:28,912
Yeah, my mama's supposed
to be coming.

1313
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:30,013
Hey, how you doing?

1314
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:31,681
All right, thank you.

1315
01:17:31,715 --> 01:17:32,882
Welcome, welcome.

1316
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:34,150
Gem, too.

1317
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:37,053
Her ass better
be bringing my son.

1318
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:40,189
They probably waiting
on a ride, though.

1319
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,191
Don't think
I'm hanging around.
Why?

1320
01:17:42,225 --> 01:17:43,860
You supposed to be
giving the opening speech.

1321
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,394
For who?

1322
01:17:45,428 --> 01:17:48,031
You don't see nobody
wearing my nametag.

1323
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:51,300
My mama, she want to come,
but, you know, she thick.

1324
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:52,836
(laughing)

1325
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:53,870
And she worried about
everybody laughing at her.

1326
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:55,204
I'm sorry.

1327
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:56,239
All she do is sit around
all day watching stories

1328
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:57,774
pretending she in one.

1329
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:59,108
How you doing?
(woman)
Hi, good.

1330
01:17:59,142 --> 01:18:00,209
How are you guys?
All right.

1331
01:18:05,749 --> 01:18:07,050
Come on, Rack, man,
that's your mama, man.

1332
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:08,785
I know, and for real.

1333
01:18:08,818 --> 01:18:11,120
I love every ounce of her
400 pounds,

1334
01:18:11,154 --> 01:18:13,022
but...

1335
01:18:13,056 --> 01:18:14,791
sometimes I just wish she'd
get up and do something

1336
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:17,894
instead of expecting
me to do everything.

1337
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:20,029
At some point, you gotta get
over what some man did to you

1338
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:21,064
and get on with it.

1339
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:25,101
Man, sometimes I gotta even
help her wash her own butt.

1340
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:26,970
You know that ain't right.

1341
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:28,071
How you doing?

1342
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:29,405
Welcome, welcome.

1343
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:31,474
Thank you.
Have a good time.

1344
01:18:31,507 --> 01:18:32,842
There they are.

1345
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:41,050
You lucky, X.

1346
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:43,820
You have a mom that takes
such good care of herself.

1347
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:45,254
Hey.

1348
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:48,224
How you doing,
what's up?

1349
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:54,197
Hey, son.

1350
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,000
I told you
I was coming.

1351
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:58,267
What?

1352
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:02,738
(cheers and applause)

1353
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:13,082
Remember, here at The Hive,

1354
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,351
we just don't
measure test scores.

1355
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:17,921
The true measure of a man,
we believe,

1356
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:19,923
is in the total
of his character.

1357
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,201
Where's my mama at?

1358
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:33,937
She left.
What you mean
she left?

1359
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,439
Where'd she go?
Who knows?

1360
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,842
She got in the car
with your boy Rack.

1361
01:19:40,844 --> 01:19:43,512
Mr. Xtra Keys.

1362
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:45,448
X, get up there,
everyone's waiting.

1363
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:01,164
Good evening.

1364
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:03,499
Mrs. Inez is always saying
that there's always

1365
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:07,003
a savior in every group.

1366
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:10,173
You just have to know
which one is meant for you

1367
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:13,076
or meant for somebody else.

1368
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:14,477
Or not meant
at all.

1369
01:20:16,212 --> 01:20:20,416
See, we got real
saviors here at The Hive.

1370
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:21,550
Mrs. Inez.

1371
01:20:23,386 --> 01:20:24,820
Mr. Hollis.

1372
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:28,324
And our teachers.

1373
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:31,160
And we have
each other.

1374
01:20:33,129 --> 01:20:35,932
But most important...

1375
01:20:35,965 --> 01:20:38,234
we have you guys,

1376
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:39,368
our families.

1377
01:20:42,205 --> 01:20:43,339
Thank you.

1378
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:00,089
(door opening)

1379
01:21:01,925 --> 01:21:03,626
What you doing
sitting here in the dark?

1380
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:05,394
Waiting for somebody
to come home.

1381
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:06,395
It's just me and Deuce.

1382
01:21:06,429 --> 01:21:07,863
Shay ain't here yet.

1383
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,071
X, where'd
you get a gun?

1384
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:16,973
Can I hold it?
Hey!

1385
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:19,976
Don't you ever ask nobody
to see no gun!

1386
01:21:20,009 --> 01:21:21,377
Do you hear me?!

1387
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,280
Do you understand me?!

1388
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:26,249
Don't you start
that crying.

1389
01:21:26,282 --> 01:21:28,051
I ain't crying, X,
I ain't.

1390
01:21:42,165 --> 01:21:45,268
*

1391
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:51,941
Oh, shit.

1392
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:55,378
Look who it is.

1393
01:21:58,314 --> 01:22:00,984
Where the fuck you
been hiding, nigga?

1394
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:03,987
I been here, there,
you know.

1395
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,121
You been here?

1396
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:11,961
No, the truth is,

1397
01:22:11,995 --> 01:22:13,562
you been everywhere
but where you need.

1398
01:22:15,498 --> 01:22:17,967
Just say the word, X.

1399
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:19,435
I can keep you busy.

1400
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:22,538
Yeah, I know you can.

1401
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:23,706
You know,
I promised your daddy

1402
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:27,110
I'd look out
for you.

1403
01:22:27,143 --> 01:22:28,277
I kind of owe him.

1404
01:22:51,034 --> 01:22:53,669
See, X...

1405
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:56,239
one hand
washes the other,

1406
01:22:56,272 --> 01:22:57,506
but don't nobody tell
the left

1407
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,508
what the right is doing,

1408
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:03,712
but then again,
some of us...

1409
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:07,016
don't always know
which is our left

1410
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:08,451
and which is always
right.

1411
01:23:10,286 --> 01:23:13,022
You understand me?

1412
01:23:13,056 --> 01:23:15,491
Yeah, I got you.

1413
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:17,193
Look, man, I'm just looking
for Gem, man.

1414
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:19,528
Oh, Gem.

1415
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:21,564
Man, you better
take care of your woman.

1416
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,568
'Cause these bitches
will stray on you.

1417
01:23:27,403 --> 01:23:28,671
You feel me?

1418
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:34,243
Man, go home.

1419
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:36,011
These streets ain't
for you tonight, playa.

1420
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,548
Hey, yo, X!

1421
01:23:39,582 --> 01:23:40,683
One more thing.

1422
01:23:44,087 --> 01:23:45,421
You better
check your sister.

1423
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:49,125
She out here trying to
get loose

1424
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:50,759
a little too soon.

1425
01:23:52,328 --> 01:23:53,496
You feel me?

1426
01:24:07,643 --> 01:24:09,044
Bad night?

1427
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,249
You want some cereal?

1428
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:15,084
X, Mama come home yet?

1429
01:24:15,118 --> 01:24:17,353
Boy, why are you
talking so loud?

1430
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:20,623
That's your bowl of cereal
right there.

1431
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:21,790
You made me cereal.

1432
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:24,260
Shay, come on,
so we can eat!

1433
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:26,429
Goddamn, X!

1434
01:24:26,462 --> 01:24:28,063
Why you gotta
be so loud?

1435
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:32,301
Go wash that
shit off your face.

1436
01:24:32,335 --> 01:24:34,069
And change your
clothes, too.

1437
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:39,308
Tony, take Deuce
in the back for me.

1438
01:24:45,514 --> 01:24:47,850
Listen, I'm trying not
to hit you,

1439
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:50,353
but you're moving
a little too fast.

1440
01:24:50,386 --> 01:24:52,155
And just because your mama
hangs out all night

1441
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:53,522
doesn't mean
you supposed to.

1442
01:24:53,556 --> 01:24:54,557
It wasn't all night.

1443
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:55,858
I was home by 2:00.

1444
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:57,560
Yeah, that's five hours
too late.

1445
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,295
What?
You playing daddy now?

1446
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,430
You trying to play
ho now?
Who you calling a ho?

1447
01:25:01,464 --> 01:25:04,633
Look, I need you to
stay on track, Shay!

1448
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:06,302
I don't need you out there
trying to hang,

1449
01:25:06,335 --> 01:25:08,871
bang, or none
of that shit!

1450
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:11,240
You leave that for them girls
who wanna play skank.

1451
01:25:15,178 --> 01:25:17,446
Yeah, 'cause he talking
about skanks like me.

1452
01:25:19,182 --> 01:25:22,551
You so full of shit, X.

1453
01:25:22,585 --> 01:25:23,819
I liked you
a lot better before

1454
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,789
you started going to that
punk-ass school,

1455
01:25:26,822 --> 01:25:29,458
perpetrating
like you something.

1456
01:25:29,492 --> 01:25:32,361
Like you some Obama
and shit?

1457
01:25:32,395 --> 01:25:33,796
Doing damn
speeches and shit?

1458
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:35,298
Well, you ain't
no Obama.

1459
01:25:35,331 --> 01:25:36,665
You ain't shit.

1460
01:25:44,607 --> 01:25:47,910
You know, you lucky
I'm going that school.

1461
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:49,878
They teach me how to
control my temper.

1462
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:55,384
Otherwise I'd be choking the
shit out your ass right now.

1463
01:26:11,234 --> 01:26:12,435
Yeah.

1464
01:26:12,468 --> 01:26:14,370
I'm really
proud of 'em.

1465
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:15,738
Mmm...

1466
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:17,373
Now next is the banquet

1467
01:26:17,406 --> 01:26:18,674
and then I have to deal
with those

1468
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:20,309
school board members.

1469
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:23,879
Oh, don't worry about them,
they'll be all right.

1470
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:26,215
But you know who
I am worried about, though?

1471
01:26:26,249 --> 01:26:27,683
Rack and Xtra.

1472
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:29,285
You know, something just
ain't right with them.

1473
01:26:29,318 --> 01:26:30,553
Good morning.

1474
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:33,722
Oh, I am so jazzed
about last night.

1475
01:26:33,756 --> 01:26:37,426
Honestly, wasn't it, like,
every shade of wonderful?

1476
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:38,894
Oh.

1477
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:41,564
Hey, I'm not sure
if I mentioned it before,

1478
01:26:41,597 --> 01:26:43,799
but some of the boys are
wanting to help me start

1479
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,468
a Hive newsletter.

1480
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:47,903
They would write the articles,
take the pictures.

1481
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,705
Xtra's agreed to
design the layout

1482
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:52,741
and Que's going to be
my assistant editor.

1483
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:54,477
Aden and Christa
would help the boys

1484
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:56,612
fashion articles from their
respective disciplines.

1485
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:58,914
You know, maybe
a monthly math problem

1486
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:02,251
to solve or a social studies
winning essay.

1487
01:27:02,285 --> 01:27:03,386
What do you think?

1488
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:04,820
You think
it'll work?

1489
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:08,257
Great, 'cause we've
already started.

1490
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:09,825
I am so jazzed.

1491
01:27:09,858 --> 01:27:11,760
Okay, have
a blessed day.

1492
01:27:11,794 --> 01:27:12,895
Okay.
Okay.

1493
01:27:12,928 --> 01:27:13,896
Bye.

1494
01:27:15,364 --> 01:27:16,999
Hollis, have I ever
told you

1495
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:18,934
how much
I love The Hive?

1496
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,770
I mean, every day,
a new adventure.

1497
01:27:21,804 --> 01:27:22,805
Ain't that the truth.

1498
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:27,410
(car approaching)

1499
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:34,783
Ooh...

1500
01:27:34,817 --> 01:27:36,819
(giggling)

1501
01:27:42,391 --> 01:27:43,759
(Xtra)
Where you been
for two days?

1502
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:49,798
You been
waiting up for your mama?

1503
01:27:49,832 --> 01:27:51,767
Again?

1504
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,402
Thank you.

1505
01:27:54,737 --> 01:27:55,704
Lord.

1506
01:27:57,406 --> 01:28:00,343
Sorry I had to cut out early
on your little shindig, X.

1507
01:28:00,376 --> 01:28:01,644
It was nice, though.

1508
01:28:01,677 --> 01:28:03,512
What I saw of it.

1509
01:28:03,546 --> 01:28:06,815
Seem like they teaching
y'all a lot over there.

1510
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:09,284
So what kind of things
Rack been teaching you?

1511
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:14,357
Who?

1512
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,458
Rack.

1513
01:28:15,491 --> 01:28:17,560
My friend Rack.

1514
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:19,762
Mama, please
don't do this.

1515
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:24,066
He's my age and I gotta see
him every day at The Hive.

1516
01:28:24,099 --> 01:28:26,034
He ain't nothing
but a two-bit hustler.

1517
01:28:26,068 --> 01:28:27,503
Why don't you just
let him be?

1518
01:28:27,536 --> 01:28:30,339
You don't
run my life.

1519
01:28:30,373 --> 01:28:31,974
I'm the mama.

1520
01:28:32,007 --> 01:28:33,809
And if I want to
see him,

1521
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:35,478
or anybody else,

1522
01:28:35,511 --> 01:28:36,979
ain't nothing
you can do about it!

1523
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:38,447
You understand that?!

1524
01:28:40,549 --> 01:28:41,984
Ain't shit
you can do about it,

1525
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:43,419
you understand what
I'm saying?!

1526
01:28:43,452 --> 01:28:44,487
Dammit!

1527
01:28:50,493 --> 01:28:52,094
(Shay)
It looks a little better,

1528
01:28:52,127 --> 01:28:54,997
but it's gonna take more than
just two days to heal.

1529
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:56,365
It'll be all right.

1530
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:59,535
Maybe if she hadn't
lost her job.

1531
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:01,870
I thought Mama liked
working at the nursing home.

1532
01:29:01,904 --> 01:29:04,740
Mama always like something
in the beginning.

1533
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:06,742
Pretty sure she
used to even like us.

1534
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:08,110
When?

1535
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:09,144
I must have
missed that.

1536
01:29:12,981 --> 01:29:15,384
I can't believe Mama left
out of here last night

1537
01:29:15,418 --> 01:29:18,053
after she did
this and got arrested.

1538
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:22,425
I want a mama, X.

1539
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:23,859
Somebody I can
count on

1540
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:27,563
instead of somebody trying
to act like she my age.

1541
01:29:27,596 --> 01:29:28,897
I hate her.

1542
01:29:30,766 --> 01:29:31,867
No, you don't.

1543
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,069
It's embarrassing.

1544
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:36,572
How many times you gonna go
to jail for something stupid

1545
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:38,073
following behind some man

1546
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:41,143
or in this case,
some boy?

1547
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:44,480
As soon as anybody find out,
we gonna get evicted again,

1548
01:29:44,513 --> 01:29:47,816
they gonna split us up,
put us in some foster home.

1549
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:50,052
You and me,
we'll be all right.

1550
01:29:50,085 --> 01:29:53,922
Tony, you know he
can't survive.

1551
01:29:53,956 --> 01:29:57,092
He won't have to.

1552
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,494
I promise.

1553
01:29:58,527 --> 01:30:01,096
Your promises
aren't worth shit.

1554
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:02,498
She wouldn't be sitting
in jail

1555
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:04,099
if it hadn't
have been for you,

1556
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:07,603
that damn school and your
little friend.

1557
01:30:07,636 --> 01:30:09,772
Can't your
father do something?

1558
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:11,907
Call in a favor to get
the money to get Mama out

1559
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,909
or maybe I could talk to Shoot,
somebody told me...

1560
01:30:16,645 --> 01:30:18,947
You stay your fast ass
away from him!

1561
01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:20,616
You hear me?!

1562
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:22,951
Or you'll end up
right where your mama is.

1563
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:25,087
That's if I don't kill
your ass first.

1564
01:30:45,874 --> 01:30:49,011
In the meantime,
what am I supposed to do?

1565
01:30:49,044 --> 01:30:50,513
Look, you got a sister,
don't you?

1566
01:30:50,546 --> 01:30:51,847
You got a brother.

1567
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,149
Billie had two kids with
some other fool, right?

1568
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:56,151
So you get your family
in business.

1569
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:57,953
You get that boy,
you get that...

1570
01:30:57,986 --> 01:30:59,121
You get
that little girl

1571
01:30:59,154 --> 01:31:00,556
and you get...

1572
01:31:00,589 --> 01:31:02,525
What do you call it, huh?

1573
01:31:02,558 --> 01:31:03,826
A website.

1574
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:05,961
Get you a little sexy
website going on

1575
01:31:05,994 --> 01:31:07,563
with these
kids, get paid.

1576
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:09,131
That's my brother
and my sister.

1577
01:31:11,867 --> 01:31:13,569
I can't even believe that
you would even say that.

1578
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:16,505
I can't believe that
I have a son that I raised

1579
01:31:16,539 --> 01:31:18,240
who don't know how to
get paid.

1580
01:31:18,273 --> 01:31:19,808
You see,
that's the thing.

1581
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:21,610
You didn't raise me.

1582
01:31:22,878 --> 01:31:24,813
I can remember
every beating.

1583
01:31:26,615 --> 01:31:28,684
The ones you gave mama

1584
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:30,185
and the ones
you gave me.

1585
01:31:32,755 --> 01:31:35,524
Throwing us
into walls and shit?

1586
01:31:35,558 --> 01:31:37,860
I guess I didn't throw you
hard enough, did I?

1587
01:31:39,895 --> 01:31:41,697
I really
wanted to love you.

1588
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:43,732
You know I still have
very long reach.

1589
01:31:43,766 --> 01:31:44,967
So?!

1590
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,241
You brought me in
this fucked-up world,

1591
01:31:53,275 --> 01:31:55,510
it might as well be you
to take me out!

1592
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:21,269
They turned it
off today.

1593
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:22,738
Electricity's next.

1594
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,041
You go by
the jail yesterday?

1595
01:32:32,781 --> 01:32:34,282
Gem, this ain't
easy for me to say,

1596
01:32:34,316 --> 01:32:36,652
but...

1597
01:32:36,685 --> 01:32:38,821
I need you to stay
here with me.

1598
01:32:38,854 --> 01:32:40,255
For what, X?

1599
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:41,624
To wrap my legs around you

1600
01:32:41,657 --> 01:32:43,926
whenever you need to
relieve yourself?

1601
01:32:43,959 --> 01:32:45,961
That ain't love.

1602
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:47,129
Love would be me
trying to wrap

1603
01:32:47,162 --> 01:32:48,330
my heart around you,

1604
01:32:48,363 --> 01:32:50,165
but that ain't never
gonna happen.

1605
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:51,767
You don't
even give a shit.

1606
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,069
Those are our pots,
you stupid ass bitch!

1607
01:32:59,141 --> 01:33:00,776
You know,
living with you, X,

1608
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:02,310
has been worse than
living at home.

1609
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:08,784
At least at home,
I knew nobody loved me

1610
01:33:08,817 --> 01:33:12,120
and I didn't care.

1611
01:33:12,154 --> 01:33:15,223
But here...
you made me care, X.

1612
01:33:17,793 --> 01:33:19,995
I ain't never forgiving
you for that shit.

1613
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:32,107
Gem.

1614
01:33:34,677 --> 01:33:35,778
I'm trying to change.

1615
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:40,315
I'm not.

1616
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:42,050
I don't want
to stay at home,

1617
01:33:42,084 --> 01:33:45,821
watch you do homework,
playing patty-cake.

1618
01:33:45,854 --> 01:33:47,122
You don't like
the streets no more?

1619
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:48,957
Well, I still do.

1620
01:33:48,991 --> 01:33:51,660
It's in my blood,
6-8 'til I die.

1621
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:58,901
You think 'cause
your mama's in jail

1622
01:33:58,934 --> 01:34:00,402
so now you expect me
to play mama

1623
01:34:00,435 --> 01:34:02,805
to everybody
up in this piece?

1624
01:34:02,838 --> 01:34:04,006
You better call
dial-a-mama,

1625
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:06,208
'cause that
ain't me, X.

1626
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:08,043
You got somebody else?

1627
01:34:08,076 --> 01:34:09,678
What does it matter?

1628
01:34:09,712 --> 01:34:12,247
Bottom line, I stay here,
we kill each other.

1629
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,648
What about my son?

1630
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,852
Our son.

1631
01:34:16,885 --> 01:34:18,854
You're not taking him
away from me, Gem.

1632
01:34:18,887 --> 01:34:20,322
I'll beat
the shit out of you.

1633
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,732
Shit, do it, then, X.

1634
01:34:33,268 --> 01:34:36,739
Beat the shit out of me
and get it over with,

1635
01:34:36,772 --> 01:34:39,107
'cause I'm still leaving,

1636
01:34:39,141 --> 01:34:42,044
now or when
you asleep,

1637
01:34:42,077 --> 01:34:43,411
but I'd rather do it now

1638
01:34:43,445 --> 01:34:45,113
before I have to
play out this scene again

1639
01:34:45,147 --> 01:34:46,882
in front of Tony and Shay.

1640
01:34:51,887 --> 01:34:54,222
Please.

1641
01:34:54,256 --> 01:34:55,991
Don't take him
away from me, Gem.

1642
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:02,397
You can't go to school
and take care of him, too, X.

1643
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:05,267
I'll quit school.

1644
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,102
Don't do that.

1645
01:35:10,138 --> 01:35:11,874
I see how
it's changed you.

1646
01:35:13,508 --> 01:35:15,043
And I hate it.

1647
01:35:17,813 --> 01:35:19,247
Maybe Deuce needs
at least one parent

1648
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:21,283
to be an example for
him one day.

1649
01:35:26,154 --> 01:35:28,290
Come back and get him
when I get straight.

1650
01:35:28,323 --> 01:35:32,060
*

1651
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:45,273
I think we should print

1652
01:35:45,307 --> 01:35:46,975
a couple of hundred more,
though.

1653
01:35:47,009 --> 01:35:49,077
My roadie
brothers can hand them out.

1654
01:35:49,111 --> 01:35:51,146
It'll do wonders for
our PR.

1655
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:53,782
You really think
it's that good?

1656
01:35:53,816 --> 01:35:56,351
Are you fishing for a
compliment? (Courvoisier)
Mr. Hollis!

1657
01:35:56,384 --> 01:35:59,021
Mr. Hollis, Mrs. Inez
needs you right now!

1658
01:35:59,054 --> 01:36:00,188
Now what's wrong?

1659
01:36:00,222 --> 01:36:01,790
Everybody come
right now!

1660
01:36:01,824 --> 01:36:03,491
*

1661
01:36:07,529 --> 01:36:09,397
(all)
Happy birthday!

1662
01:36:11,233 --> 01:36:12,968
(Mrs. Inez)
Surprise!

1663
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:14,369
Surprise!

1664
01:36:14,402 --> 01:36:16,471
(laughing)

1665
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:19,341
*

1666
01:36:23,478 --> 01:36:24,847
Make a wish.

1667
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,281
Come on,
make a wish!

1668
01:36:39,094 --> 01:36:40,795
(yelling)

1669
01:36:44,232 --> 01:36:45,533
I got you!

1670
01:36:45,567 --> 01:36:47,903
(panting)

1671
01:36:47,936 --> 01:36:50,372
Oh, my goodness,
you okay?

1672
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:52,007
Oh, the last
time I tackled you,

1673
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,541
you wasn't too happy
about it, was you?

1674
01:36:53,575 --> 01:36:55,177
No.

1675
01:36:55,210 --> 01:36:58,313
Ooh... ooh...

1676
01:36:58,346 --> 01:37:01,984
So... here's how
it's gonna go.

1677
01:37:02,017 --> 01:37:05,087
I want you, Shay,
Tony and little Deuce

1678
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,354
to come on and stay

1679
01:37:06,388 --> 01:37:08,523
with me and my husband
for a few days

1680
01:37:08,556 --> 01:37:11,960
'til we can figure out how
to get your mama out of jail.

1681
01:37:11,994 --> 01:37:13,195
I don't know, Mrs. Inez.

1682
01:37:13,228 --> 01:37:14,863
I mean, I need to be back
at that trailer.

1683
01:37:14,897 --> 01:37:16,331
Oh now.

1684
01:37:16,364 --> 01:37:18,533
You can go by that trailer
every day if you want,

1685
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:20,035
do check on it.

1686
01:37:20,068 --> 01:37:21,569
I'll come up with a plan

1687
01:37:21,603 --> 01:37:24,372
to get your mama out of
jail sooner than later.

1688
01:37:24,406 --> 01:37:26,041
This is how it's gonna go.

1689
01:37:26,074 --> 01:37:28,043
You gonna go home,
pack up some

1690
01:37:28,076 --> 01:37:29,477
of your brother's
and sister's things

1691
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:30,913
just for a few days

1692
01:37:30,946 --> 01:37:32,280
and then I'm gonna
come over

1693
01:37:32,314 --> 01:37:35,417
and pick you up
this evening, all right?

1694
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:37,419
It's a deal?

1695
01:37:37,452 --> 01:37:39,021
Thank you.

1696
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:40,355
Oh.

1697
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:48,030
X, the door's open,
somebody broke in.

1698
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:53,268
*

1699
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:58,040
Y'all stay here.

1700
01:37:58,073 --> 01:37:59,207
Let me go in
with you.

1701
01:37:59,241 --> 01:38:00,875
I said stay here.

1702
01:38:20,628 --> 01:38:21,896
(gun cocking)

1703
01:39:19,554 --> 01:39:21,289
(grunting)

1704
01:39:40,375 --> 01:39:41,643
Tony.

1705
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,716
That gun is loaded.

1706
01:39:54,422 --> 01:39:59,261
I want you...

1707
01:39:59,294 --> 01:40:00,995
to slowly...

1708
01:40:03,565 --> 01:40:04,999
put it down.

1709
01:40:17,412 --> 01:40:19,747
Boy, didn't I tell you never
to touch one of these?

1710
01:40:19,781 --> 01:40:21,383
Never!

1711
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:22,550
Man, you could've...

1712
01:40:25,587 --> 01:40:27,589
You know what, I'm taking these
out of here tonight.

1713
01:40:27,622 --> 01:40:29,391
I should have done
that in the first place.

1714
01:40:29,424 --> 01:40:31,259
What were you thinking?!

1715
01:40:31,293 --> 01:40:33,695
(car approaching)

1716
01:40:33,728 --> 01:40:35,463
*

1717
01:40:35,497 --> 01:40:36,731
That sounds like Rack.

1718
01:40:39,267 --> 01:40:40,668
(car doors closing)

1719
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:50,645
X, are they the ones
that broke in?

1720
01:40:50,678 --> 01:40:52,447
Your brother in there?

1721
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,082
Yeah, he in there.

1722
01:40:54,116 --> 01:40:56,751
His daddy want us to come
have a little talk with him.

1723
01:40:56,784 --> 01:40:58,586
You know.

1724
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,255
Look at this
little dude, huh?

1725
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,489
Give 'em to me.

1726
01:41:01,523 --> 01:41:03,125
Come on, come on
to papa, baby.

1727
01:41:03,158 --> 01:41:04,592
Yeah, give him to me.

1728
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:10,232
Yeah, look at you,
boy, how you doing?

1729
01:41:10,265 --> 01:41:11,299
Yeah.

1730
01:41:13,435 --> 01:41:15,437
Little boy, huh?

1731
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:16,804
You're big, hey.

1732
01:41:26,648 --> 01:41:28,283
Lookee here.

1733
01:41:34,389 --> 01:41:35,723
There's your daddy.

1734
01:41:41,663 --> 01:41:42,830
Give me my son.

1735
01:41:47,202 --> 01:41:50,805
We all 6-8 family
out here.

1736
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:52,274
You know that, X.

1737
01:41:54,842 --> 01:41:58,380
The 6-8 don't tolerate
no disrespect, do we?

1738
01:41:58,413 --> 01:42:00,782
Yeah, I know.

1739
01:42:00,815 --> 01:42:02,317
True that.

1740
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:09,291
So when we got a message
from 1-1-9

1741
01:42:09,324 --> 01:42:11,826
saying that you had been
a little disrespectful...

1742
01:42:15,397 --> 01:42:17,265
we thought we'd come
have a little talk with you.

1743
01:42:18,533 --> 01:42:20,202
I said give me my son!

1744
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:25,540
*

1745
01:42:47,295 --> 01:42:48,930
Come on, Shoot.

1746
01:42:48,963 --> 01:42:52,200
You already know I'm gonna
be 6-8 'til I die.

1747
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:57,939
I delivered your message.

1748
01:42:59,407 --> 01:43:00,475
Now here's mine.

1749
01:43:13,488 --> 01:43:14,822
I ain't
scared of dying.

1750
01:43:17,559 --> 01:43:20,262
What I am scared of

1751
01:43:20,295 --> 01:43:22,430
is dying on him,

1752
01:43:22,464 --> 01:43:24,232
'cause he don't
deserve that.

1753
01:43:36,344 --> 01:43:38,780
There's rules
to this shit, X.

1754
01:43:38,813 --> 01:43:41,716
You ought to
know that.

1755
01:43:41,749 --> 01:43:42,950
Yeah, I hear you.

1756
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,256
Now I'm just trying to make
a few new ones for myself.

1757
01:43:50,625 --> 01:43:52,394
So if you
gonna shoot me...

1758
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:59,267
you gonna have to do
it through my back,

1759
01:43:59,301 --> 01:44:00,535
'cause I'm out.

1760
01:44:08,676 --> 01:44:11,579
(Xtra)
As I said...

1761
01:44:11,613 --> 01:44:14,949
I always live by a few
simple rules,

1762
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:18,286
but I've learned
a real man realizes

1763
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,523
his rules have to work
not just for him...

1764
01:44:21,556 --> 01:44:24,426
but for all the people
who count on him.

1765
01:44:24,459 --> 01:44:27,295
All you gotta do
is stay alive...

1766
01:44:27,329 --> 01:44:28,663
just one more day.

1767
01:44:30,632 --> 01:44:34,836
