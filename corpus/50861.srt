00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:15,573
- That's it. You !
- Moi ?

164
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:19,515
Yeah, you. You are marching
back across the street with me,

165
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:22,280
and we're gonna pick up
a shitload of Archie books.

166
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:25,255
And I'm going to prove to you
beyond the shadow of a doubt...

167
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:27,848
that Archie
is all about pussy.

168
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,826
- Come on !
- [ Laughs ]

169
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:32,158
This boy is conflicted.

170
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:36,122
I shall play
mother therapist for him.

171
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:39,432
You two sit tight.
We shall return promptly.

172
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:45,174
Is he always like that ?

173
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:48,508
Who, him ? Yeah.
Ever since the third grade.

174
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,572
This, uh, this nun was teaching us
about the Blessed Trinity, you know ?

175
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,675
She was going on and on about
the three persons in one God thing.

176
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,778
Father, Son,
the Holy Spirit.

177
00:12:56,855 --> 00:13:00,518
Banky just goes ballistic on her.
They got in this huge fight.

178
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:04,187
An eight-year-old kid ?
How bad could it have been ?

179
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:07,288
Well, have you ever seen a nun call
a small child a "fucking cunt-rag" ?

180
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:10,357
It wasn't pretty.
Shit like that's bound to happen...

181
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:13,404
when you make a kid wear
a matching tie and slacks every day.

182
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:17,840
Right. And your parochial
school misadventures ?

183
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:21,675
Oh, mostly limited to
wine-tasting prior to mass.

184
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:24,271
Turned me into a grade school
alcoholic altar boy though.

185
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,476
Can't tell you how many mornings
after serious benders...

186
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:28,917
I'd wake up next
to strange priests.

187
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,820
- Aren't you the sharp wit ?
- Sharp ? No.

188
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,882
I'm just a fan of
clergy-molestation humor.

189
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,987
Probably why the extended family quit
inviting me to first communion parties.

190
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,793
Tsk. You play darts ?

191
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:49,465
Uh, not professionally.
You know, only in bars.

192
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,736
[Alyssa]
I don't know.

193
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,803
Maybe I should just sign one of those
exclusive deals like you guys.

194
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,814
Your new book seems
to be selling like mad.

195
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:02,615
Well, it all goes back to somethin'
my grandmother told me when I was a kid.

196
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:06,987
" Holden," she said, "the big bucks
are in dick and fart jokes."

197
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:09,390
- She was a churchgoer.
- Oh !

198
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:13,454
The cry from the heart of a real artist
trapped in commercial hell,

199
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:15,965
pitying his good fortune.

200
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:19,401
I'm sure you can dry your eyes
on all those fat checks you rake in.

201
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:23,567
Oh, I'm sorry. What was that ? Did I
detect a note of bitter envy in there ?

202
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:26,508
No, I'm happy my stuff
gets read at all.

203
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:28,773
There's very little market
for hearts and flowers...

204
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:32,977
in this spandex-clad, big pecs,
big tits, big guns field.

205
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:36,145
If I sell two issues,
I feel like John Grisham.

206
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:38,189
Well, it's all
about marketing.

207
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:43,284
Over- or underweight guys that don't
get laid. They're our bread and butter.

208
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,592
People like those two outside
should be yours.

209
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:49,599
And sadly, there are more
of our core audience.

210
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:53,262
Kind of gives you a charge though.
See two people like that in love.

211
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:55,636
And all over
Banky's car, no less.

212
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:58,403
You know, that car's seeing more action
right now than it's seen in years.

213
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:03,140
- Bubbly guy. It's hard to figure out.
- Yeah.

214
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:06,342
You gotta respect that kind of display
of affection. You know what I mean ?

215
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,977
Sure, it's crazy.
It's rude. It's self-absorbed.

216
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:12,284
But, uh, you know,
it's love.

217
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:15,326
- It's not love.
- Oh, says you.

218
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:18,385
That out there ?
That's fleeting.

219
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:21,591
- Fleeting ?
- Mm-hmm. Well, l gotta split.

220
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,295
It was really nice meeting you.
Good luck with your book.

221
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,205
Tell Hooper I'll call him later.
And... tell your friend to calm down.

222
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,314
[Hooper]
Shut up already.

223
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:41,113
You shut up !
You're insane.

224
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:43,949
Archie is not fucking
Mr. Weatherbee !

225
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:47,480
Deny, deny, deny.

226
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,552
- Where's Alyssa ?
- She left, said she'd call you later.

227
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,291
Look, he's just offering to help Archie
with his fuckin' homework !

228
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:56,663
Read between
the lines, bitch.

229
00:15:56,734 --> 00:16:00,033
Fuck this. Let's go.
Traffic.

230
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:02,664
- Holden !
- What ?

231
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,836
- Let's go !
- See that dent in the hood of your car?

232
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,708
Son of a bitch !

233
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:16,211
Let me guess.
You like her.

234
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,687
- Who ?
- Miss Alyssa Jones.

235
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,256
- She's all right.
- As long as that's all.

236
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:27,694
 [Rap, Indistinct]

237
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:52,689
This is one of the best streetlights
you've ever drawn.

238
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,884
It's the one from across the street
from the post office.

239
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,723
- Looks just like it.
- Thanks.

240
00:16:57,795 --> 00:17:01,231
So, uh, what do you want
to do tonight ?

241
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:04,700
I don't know. Get a pizza.
Watch Degrassi Junior High.

242
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:07,499
You got a weird thing
for Canadian melodrama.

243
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,200
I got a weird thing
for girls who say "a boot."

244
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:14,506
- [ Phone Rings, Beeps ]
- Bank Holdup.

245
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,778
Hooper here. Listen, I know how
you 'burb fiends hate the city,

246
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:23,252
but there's a club shindig goin' down
tonight I think you'd really get into.

247
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:27,155
- Where is it ?
- Meow Mix. I'm temping as barkeep.

248
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:30,388
Oh, I don't know, Hoop.

249
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:33,294
We're prepping the next issue. We got
that stupid meeting in the morning.

250
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:36,299
- I told her you wouldn't be interested.
- Told who ?

251
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:39,331
Alyssa.

252
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,372
Alyssa from last night Alyssa ?

253
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,771
How do you begin and end a question
with the same word like that ?

254
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:46,776
You got skill.
Yes, that one !

255
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:49,278
She asked me to invite you.
Now, here's the part where you say--

256
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:54,717
- I'll be there.
- Thought so. 1 0:00. Later.

257
00:17:54,786 --> 00:18:00,019
- Who was that ?
- Hooper. He invited me to a club.

258
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:03,720
Man, when's that faggot gonna learn ?
You like chicks.

259
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,855
- Not that kind of club.
- So when we leavin' ?

260
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:11,061
We ? You can't go.
He's hookin' me up with Alyssa.

261
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:14,536
- And ?
- And I don't want you messing it up.

262
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:17,972
I care about your shit.
Maybe I'll hook up myself.

263
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:20,340
I told you. It's not
that kind of club.

264
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,506
How does one man
get to be so funny ?

265
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:28,985
Look, how you gonna get
home when I hook up, huh ?

266
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:33,456
- Like that'll happen.
- Let me explain, my witless chum.

267
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:35,856
The other night, we two,
Alyssa and I,

268
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:38,361
we, uh, well,
we shared a moment.

269
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,694
- Oh, you had a moment.
- No.

270
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:44,496
We shared a moment,
all right ?

271
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:50,007
And in that moment, one thing
was made abundantly clear.

272
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:53,510
This girl loves me,
my friend.

273
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:57,309
Loves me. You know
what I'm sayin' ?

274

 [ Humming ]
 Ah, who's your daddy now

275
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,215
Come on. Mmm.

00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,220
-  Ah
- Shut up !

Go, Sheila, It's your birthday

00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:15,928
All right.
Bring on the free hootch.

280
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,595
Free? I didn't invite your tired ass.
So, where's your better half?

281
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,764
Takin' a piss. The guy's got
a bladder like an infant.

282
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,638
That's funny. He says
you're hung like an infant.

283
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,406
Does his mother
tell him everything ?

284
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:31,209
- Hey !
- What'd you do, fall in love ?

285
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,302
- Where is she ?
- Over there.

286
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:38,463
Look at her in her net shirt. Been
dancin' for an hour. Hasn't stopped yet.

287
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,532
She ain't no Deney Terrio,
I'll say that.

288
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,546
Listen, if I'm not back by Tuesday,
call my mother. All right ?

289
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:49,277
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's somethin' you should know.

290
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:52,013
- She got a boyfriend ?
- Well, no.

291
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:56,387
Then what's to know, my friend ?
[ Grunts ] What's to know ?

292
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,188
 [Rap, Indistinct]

293
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:08,635
Hey, lady ! You fucked up
my cabbage patch !

00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:13,232
Well, well, well, if it isn't Bluntman
himself, or should I call you Chronic ?

295
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:17,438
Call me flattered. I heard you sent me
the invite to this little soiree.

296
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:21,176
From a former hometown girl
to Mr. Hometown himself.

297
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,878
- You're saying you're from the 'burbs ?
-  Middletown, New Jersey

298
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:27,251
- Get outta here ! I'm from Highlands !
- I know. Hooper told me.

299
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:29,256
How is it that we never
ran into one another ?

300
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:31,258
- Did you graduate from Hudson ?
- Yeah, '88.

00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:34,386
- I went to North.
- What a small fuckin' world.

302
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:36,761
- So you know the tri-town area ?
- Quiz me.

303
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:38,823
- Miller Hill ?
- I wrote my name on the wall.

304
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:41,563
- Sandy Hook ?
- Lost my virginity there.

305
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:44,970
- This is so cool. The mall ?
- Eton preppy or Menlo Park ?

306
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,305
Oh, no. Here's the big test.
Quick Stop ?

307
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:51,278
My best friend fucked
a dead guy in the bathroom.

308
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:54,440
- You know that girl ?
- I did, before she was committed.

There's a lot of chicks
in this place.

This is fate.

No, this is "The Rog."

00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:14,527
I'm talking about us meeting.
What are the chances ?

314
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:18,300
Pretty slim. I haven't been back
to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.

315
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:21,274
- The Quick Stop girl died ?
- Uh-uh. Another girl.

- Julie Dwyer. She died in the--
- The YMCA pool ! Damn !

- You knew her too ?
- So well.

Wow ! One friend in the asylum,
the other friend in the grave.

- You're a dangerous person to know.

00:32:30,153 --> 00:32:34,419
[Laughing Continues]

487
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:44,133
Whoa ! Hey !
Look at the time.

488
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:46,135
We gotta-- We gotta
beat that traffic, huh ?

489
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:48,433
What traffic ?
It's 1 :30 in the morning.

490
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:52,032
And rush hour
starts in six hours. Let's go.

491
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:56,409
Uh, thanks for inviting us out.
It was educational.

492
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,414
Come on.

493
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:05,521
Since you like
chicks, right,

494
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:08,251
you just look at yourself naked
in the mirror all the time ?

495
00:33:17,534 --> 00:33:19,468
[Holden]
Look, here's the deal.

496
00:33:19,536 --> 00:33:21,936
When we getin there, don't be a
complete Potzer, like last night.

497
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:23,973
This is business now, okay ?

498
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,374
Oh, why are you in such a bad mood ?
Still dwelling on that dyke ?

499
00:33:28,445 --> 00:33:30,572
- Hey, knock it off, will you ?
- What'd I tell you ?

500
00:33:30,647 --> 00:33:33,172
She just needs
the right guy.

501
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,085
All every woman really wants
is some serious deep-dicking.

502
00:33:38,155 --> 00:33:41,682
- [Phone Ringing]
- Sorry.

503
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,195
See, that's why
I can't buy lesbians.

504
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:48,458
Everyone needs dick.

505
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:51,160
See, I can buy fags,
a bunch of guys that need dick.

506
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:54,101
You know, just plain need it.
That I get.

507
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:58,005
Dykes ?
Bullshit posturing.

508
00:33:58,074 --> 00:34:00,440
But, live and let live,
I guess.

509
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,343
I'm sure the gay community
appreciates your support.

510
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:07,349
We'd like to start off by saying that it
is a real pleasure to finally meet you.

511
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:09,681
Absolute pleasure.

512
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:12,620
One of the reasons we started this whole
thing was to finally meet the guys...

513
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:15,055
that do Bluntman & Chronic.

514
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,059
- [ Together ] Snootchie bootchies !
- Huh ?

515
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:20,494
Which now brings us
to our proposal.

516
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:23,260
Look, fellas, the days
of Butt-Head are over.

517
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:27,997
We're interested in doing 1 2 half-hour
Bluntman & Chronic cartoons.

518
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:30,638
What do you say ?

519
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:33,239
Are we in business ?

520
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:38,938
-[ Knocking Gently ]
-[TV] The boy wonder.

521
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:43,746
[TV] Batman and Robin, the dynamic
duo against crime and corruption.

522
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:46,719
Yeah, hi. Somebody told me
they make comic books here,

523
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:50,416
which is so weird, because I have
this great idea for a story.

524
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:53,688
It's about a guy who comes
to this club and-- [ Whistles ]

525
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:55,854
hightails it
when he finds out--

526
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,522
Ready for this ?

527
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:02,565
This girl is gay.

528
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:08,766
Any interest
in a story like that ?

529
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:10,970
- An animated series ?
- Twelve episodes.

530
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:14,446
- Well, that's great, isn't it ?
- Banky seems to think so.

531
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:17,040
- But you don't.
- Well, l--

532
00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:20,110
I don't know if that's the perception
I want people to have of our work.

533
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:22,280
I know this sounds pretentious
as hell, but...

534
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:24,483
I'd like to think of us
as artists, you know ?

535
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:27,584
I'd like to get back to doing something
more personal, like our first book.

536
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:31,097
Well, when are you
gonna do that ?

537
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:34,566
When we have something
personal to say.

538
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:37,126
I weirder you out
the other night.

539
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,968
Uh, no, not really.

540
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,032
- Oh, come on !
- Well, it's just--

541
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,340
I'd never seen that kind of thing
up close and personal before.

542
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:47,381
It just took a while
to process.

543
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:49,473
You wanna talk about it ?

544
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,643
If you want to.

545
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,517
I like you, Holden.

546
00:35:54,588 --> 00:35:56,886
I haven't liked a man
in a long time.

547
00:35:56,957 --> 00:36:01,621
And it's not because I'm a man-hater
or something like that.

548
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:05,324
It's just been some time since I've
been exposed to a man that didn't...

549
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:08,926
immediately live into
a stereotype of some sort.

550
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,631
And I want you to feel
comfortable with me,

551
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:14,697
because I'd really like us
to be friends.

552
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:18,176
So if there's anything you
wanna know, it's okay to ask me.

553
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:21,476
- Okay.
- Okay.

554
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:24,848
Okay. Why girls ?

555
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:29,751
- Why men ?
- Well, because that's the standard.

556
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,850
If that's the only reason
you're attracted to women--

557
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,986
No, it's more than that.

558
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:37,189
So you've never been
curious about men ?

559
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:41,701
Curious ? Well, I always wondered
why my father watched Hee Haw, but--

560
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,999
- [ Laughs ] You know what I mean.
- No.

561
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,005
- Why not ?
- No interest.

562
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:48,837
- Because ?
- Girls feel right.

563
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:53,209
Well, that's how I feel. You know,
I've never really been attracted to men.

564
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,841
- Well, so, you're still a virgin then ?
- No.

565
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:58,851
But you've only
been with girls.

566
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,853
So you're saying
a person is a virgin...

567
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:03,890
until they've had intercourse
with a member of the opposite sex.

568
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,290
Isn't that
the standard definition ?

569
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,487
Again with your standards.

570
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:11,963
I think virginity is lost
when you make love for the first time.

571
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:14,830
- With a member of the opposite sex.
- Why ? Why only then ?

572
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,837
Because that's the standard.
What do you want me to tell ya ?

573
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:22,171
So if a virgin is raped,
then she's still a virgin ?

574
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:24,734
- No, of course not.
- But rape is not the standard.

575
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:28,077
So she's had sex, but not
the standard idea of sex.

576
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:30,981
Hence, according to your definition,
she'd still be a virgin.

577
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:33,849
- Okay, fine, I'll revise.
- Uh-huh.

578
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:37,015
[ Clears Throat ] Virginity is
lost when the hymen is broken.

579
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:40,322
- Then I lost my virginity at ten.
- Really ?

580
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:43,989
'Cause, see, I fell on a fence post
when I was ten, and it broke my hymen.

581
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,124
Okay. Second revision.

582
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:49,829
Virginity is lost
through penetration.

583
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:52,270
Physical penetration
or emotional.

584
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:54,273
- Emotional penetration ?
- Mmm.

585
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:57,435
I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree
when we were in high school.

586
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:58,603
Physical penetration.

587
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,341
- We had sex.
- Yeah, but not real sex.

588
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:06,444
I move to have that remark
stricken from the record,

589
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,616
on account of it makes you come off
as completely naive and infantile.

590
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:13,888
Well, where's the penetration
in lesbian sex ? l--

591
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:18,523
A finger ? I've had my finger up my
ass. I wouldn't say I've had anal sex.

592
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,535
Observe.

593
00:38:25,606 --> 00:38:30,373
You're kidding me !
How ?

594
00:38:30,444 --> 00:38:33,140
Our bodies are built to pass
a child, for Christ's sake.

595
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:35,704
Yeah, but I mean-- Jesus !
Doesn't that hurt ?

596
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:39,082
- Sure, but in that good way.
- Oh.

597
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:43,214
And it's only a once-in-a-while thing
reserved for really special occasions.

598
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,386
- How about not-so-special occasions ?
- Tongue only.

599
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:50,726
Well, but see-- Come on.
That's what I'm sayin'.

600
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:54,063
It's like, how can that be enough ?
How big can a tongue really get ?

601
00:38:58,038 --> 00:38:59,972
My God.

602
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,807
[ Laughs ]
Let's go.

Come on. Come on.

00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,074
You're really gonna have
to give me a minute, I think.

Oh, my God. Who are you ?

609
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,959
- What are you gonna do with all those ?
- Read the articles.

610
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:30,902
What do you think I'm gonna do
with 'em ? They're stroke books, stupid.

611
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:33,963
You got, like, 30 books in there.
We're only gonna be gone for two days.

612
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,874
Variety is the spice of life.
I like a wide selection.

613
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:39,208
Sometimes I'm in the mood
for nasty close-ups.

614
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:41,577
Sometimes I like 'em
arty and airbrushed.

615
00:39:41,649 --> 00:39:43,913
Sometimes it's a spread
brown-eye kind of night.

616
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:46,384
- Sometimes it's girl-on-girl time.
-[Beeping]

617
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:48,387
Sometimes
a steamy letter will do.

618

Sometimes, not often,
but sometimes...

619
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:55,724
I like the idea
of a chick with a horse.

620

Go get our tickets.
I gotta call Alyssa.

- Put that stuff away !

[ Alyssa ] One minute, five seconds.
Ah, you are such my bitch.

00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,068
What's up ?
I'm about to get on a train.

626
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:39,333
- Oh ! Why ?
- Last-minute invite to the Boston Con.

627
00:40:39,406 --> 00:40:43,240
- Shit.
- What ?

628
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,972
Well, my sister's at my parents',
and I was gonna go see her.

629
00:40:46,046 --> 00:40:47,980
- The one that wrote the book ?
- Yeah.

630
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:52,610
But I was stayin' all weekend. I
wanted to hang out with you. This sucks.

631
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:56,918
You know, um, both of us
don't have to go.

632
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,958
- Really ?
- Yeah. Banky can do this by himself.

633
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:02,223
I mean, you know, it's not like we're on
a panel. It's just a signing appearance.

If you come pick me up,
I'll be your best friend.

gonna have to do this one by yourself.

- Alyssa's comin' down for the weekend.

You don't need me for this.

808
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,994
Why are we stopping ?

809
00:51:33,062 --> 00:51:36,293
- Because I can't take this.
- Can't take what ?

810
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:38,993
I love you.

811
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:41,662
[Thunder clap]

812
00:51:46,142 --> 00:51:48,303
You love me ?

813
00:51:48,377 --> 00:51:52,143
I love you and not,
not in a friendly way.

814
00:51:52,215 --> 00:51:54,376
Although, I think
we're great friends.

815
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:57,817
And not in a misplaced
affection, puppy dog way.

816
00:51:57,887 --> 00:51:59,980
Although, I'm sure
that's what you'll call it.

817
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:03,514
I love you. Very--

818
00:52:03,593 --> 00:52:06,926
Very simple.
Very truly.

819
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:11,797
You are the epitome of everything I have
ever looked for in another human being.

820
00:52:11,868 --> 00:52:13,859
And I know that you think of me
as just a friend,

821
00:52:13,936 --> 00:52:16,404
and crossing that line is the furthest
thing from an option...

822
00:52:16,472 --> 00:52:18,337
you would ever consider,

823
00:52:18,407 --> 00:52:23,310
but-- [ Sighs ]
I had to say it.

824
00:52:23,379 --> 00:52:25,370
I just--
I can't take this anymore.

825
00:52:25,448 --> 00:52:28,474
I can't stand next to you
without wanting to hold you.

826
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:30,917
I can't-- I can't look into
your eyes without feeling that--

827
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:34,047
that longing you only read about
in trashy romance novels.

828
00:52:34,123 --> 00:52:39,823
I can't talk to you without wanting to
express my love for everything you are.

829
00:52:39,896 --> 00:52:45,357
And I know this will probably queer
our friendship-- no pun intended--

830
00:52:45,434 --> 00:52:51,066
[Sighs]
but I had to say it.

831
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,576
'Cause I've never
felt this way before.

832
00:52:54,644 --> 00:53:00,048
And I don't care.
I like who I am because of it.

833
00:53:00,116 --> 00:53:03,517
And if bringing this to light
means we can't hang out anymore,

834
00:53:03,586 --> 00:53:06,749
then that hurts me.

835
00:53:06,822 --> 00:53:09,290
But, God, I just-- I couldn't
allow another day to go by...

836
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,260
without just getting it out there,
regardless of the outcome,

837
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:18,858
which, by the look on your face,
is to be the inevitable....

838
00:53:18,935 --> 00:53:21,665
shoot down.

839
00:53:21,737 --> 00:53:27,004
And, you know,
I'll accept that.

840
00:53:27,076 --> 00:53:30,910
But I know-- I know that some part
of you is hesitating for a moment.

841
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,643
And if there's a moment of hesitation,
then that means you feel something too.

842
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:36,651
And all I ask, please,
is that you just--

843
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:42,157
you just not dismiss that and try
to dwell in it for just ten seconds.

844
00:53:43,526 --> 00:53:45,460
Ah.

845
00:53:46,762 --> 00:53:49,060
[Sighs]
Alyssa.

846
00:53:49,131 --> 00:53:54,660
There isn't another soul
on this fucking planet...

847
00:53:54,737 --> 00:53:59,106
who has ever made me half the person
I am when I'm with you.

848
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:03,271
And I would risk this friendship for the
chance to take it to the next plateau,

849
00:54:03,346 --> 00:54:05,405
because it is there
between you and me.

850
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:09,281
You can't deny that.

851
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:20,855
Even if, you know--

852
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:28,392
Even if we never talk again
after tonight,

853
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:32,931
please know that
I am forever changed...

854
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:37,412
because of who you are
and what you've meant to me,

855
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,576
which, while I do
appreciate it,

856
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:47,180
I'd never need a painting of birds
bought at a diner to remind me of.

857
00:55:02,038 --> 00:55:05,098
[ Whispers ]
Oh, God.

858
00:55:05,174 --> 00:55:08,610
Was it something I said ?

859
00:55:08,678 --> 00:55:11,579
[ Whispers ]
Fuck.

860
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:16,450
[Thunder Rumbling]

861
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:19,215
- What are you doing ?
- Get in the car and get outta here !

862
00:55:19,288 --> 00:55:21,518
- You're gonna hitch to New York ?
- Yep !

863
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:24,787
- Aren't you at least gonna comment ?
- Here's my comment: Fuck you !

864
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,828
- Why ?
- That was so unfair.

865
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:28,261
You know how unfair that was.

866
00:55:28,331 --> 00:55:30,265
What ? It's unfair
that I'm in love with you ?

867
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:32,801
No, it's unfortunate
that you're in love with me.

868
00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:36,304
It's unfair you felt the fuckin' need
to unburden your soul about it.

869
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:39,637
Do you remember for
one fucking second who I am ?

870
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:42,041
So ? I mean, you know,
people change.

871
00:55:42,111 --> 00:55:44,045
Oh ! Oh !
It's that simple !

872
00:55:44,113 --> 00:55:46,911
You fall in love with me and
want a romantic relationship.

873
00:55:46,982 --> 00:55:48,916
Nothing changes for you...

874
00:55:48,984 --> 00:55:51,475
with the exception of feeling
hunky-dory all the time.

875
00:55:51,554 --> 00:55:55,490
But what about me, Holden ?
It's not that simple !

876
00:55:55,558 --> 00:55:57,958
I just can't get into
a relationship with you...

877
00:55:58,027 --> 00:56:01,155
without throwing my whole
fucking world into upheaval.

878
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:05,462
That's every relationship. There's
always gonna be a period of adjustment.

879
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:08,094
Period of adjustment ?

880
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:12,504
There's no period of adjustment,
Holden ! I am fucking gay !

881
00:56:12,575 --> 00:56:14,600
That's who I am !

882
00:56:14,677 --> 00:56:20,582
You assume I can turn all that around
because you've got a fucking crush ?

883
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:24,585
If this is a crush,

884
00:56:24,653 --> 00:56:28,350
I don't think I could take it
if the real thing ever happened.

885
00:56:28,424 --> 00:56:30,892
Go home, Holden.

886
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,690

[Radio Announcer] You're back with
Chazand Stuand the New Zoo Review.

[Door Slams]

892
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,440
I take it
that's not good.

893
00:58:25,512 --> 00:58:29,039
[ Sighs ]
Stay here.

894
00:58:29,116 --> 00:58:32,711
Be right back.

Catholic schoolgirls.

896
00:58:55,075 --> 00:59:00,138
The uniform's
what does it for me.

897
00:59:00,214 --> 00:59:04,048
I wish I'd went with more
Catholic school girls when I was a kid.

898
00:59:04,118 --> 00:59:09,647
As it stands, I have no "And then she
unzipped her jumper" stories.

899
00:59:10,724 --> 00:59:14,023
You seemed
weirded-out back there.

900
00:59:14,094 --> 00:59:18,656
- That's my couch you were fucking on.
- Sorry.

901
00:59:18,732 --> 00:59:22,031
I wanted to watch some TV.
Hard to do when your best friend is...

902
00:59:22,102 --> 00:59:26,198
wrapped around a naked
rug-muncher on your couch.

903
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:28,798
She had boxers on.

904
00:59:32,346 --> 00:59:36,783
- [ Sighs ] This is all gonna end badly.
- You don't know that.

905
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:40,513
I know you. You're way
too conservative for that girl.

906
00:59:40,587 --> 00:59:45,115
She's been around and seen things
we've only read about in books.

907
00:59:45,192 --> 00:59:48,958
We have read about them,
so we're prepared.

908
00:59:49,029 --> 00:59:52,294
There's no "we" here.

909
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:56,559
You're gonna have to
go through this alone.

910
00:59:56,637 --> 00:59:58,605
It's one thing
to read about shit,

911
00:59:58,672 --> 01:00:02,802
something different when you're forced
to deal with it on a regular basis.

912
01:00:02,876 --> 01:00:06,676
When you are walking in a mall and your
heads turn at a nice-looking chick,

913
01:00:06,747 --> 01:00:09,807
it's gonna eat you up
inside.

914
01:00:09,883 --> 01:00:14,445
You'll spend most of your time wondering
when the other shoe's gonna drop.

915
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:18,548
'Cause for you this isn't
about cool, weird sex stuff.

916
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:20,889
It's about love.

917
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:24,089
Maybe it is
for her as well.

918
01:00:24,164 --> 01:00:27,395
Somehow I doubt it.

919
01:00:27,468 --> 01:00:30,301
Everybody's not out
to get someone in life, Bank.

920
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:34,238
Everybody has an agenda,
all right ? Everyone.

921
01:00:34,308 --> 01:00:35,935

922
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:38,944
- My agenda is to watch your back.
- To what end ?

923
01:00:39,012 --> 01:00:41,947
To insure that all this time we've
spent together, building something,

924
01:00:42,015 --> 01:00:43,107
wasn't wasted.

925
01:00:43,183 --> 01:00:47,244
Oh, she's not gonna
ruin the comic.

926
01:00:49,723 --> 01:00:52,351
I wasn't talkin'
about the comic.

[ Sighing ]
I'm gonna go get a bagel.

928

Clean off my fucking couch
so I can watch TV.

929

[ Sighs ]

930
01:01:11,845 --> 01:01:14,006
From what I understand,
when you sign with a publisher...

931
01:01:14,081 --> 01:01:16,879
someone else does all this work for you,
and you just sit back and collect.

932
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:20,317
And miss these late-night cram sessions
with my nearest and dearest ?

-Never.
-I don't know what she's bitching about.

934

All she's done since
we got here is pound Merlot.

Yeah, you're a real help.

936
01:01:26,693 --> 01:01:29,355
I'd like to know
why we're here at all...

but I can't help it.

- Who is it ?

For your information, they don't have
big hair or wear acid-wash.

01:02:07,668 --> 01:02:09,659
They're from my hometown.

Why are you playing
the pronoun game ?

- What are you talking about ? I'm not.
- You are.

I met "someone." "We" have a great
time. "They're" from my hometown.

Doesn't this tube
of wonderful have a name ?

Can I ask you a question ?

960
01:03:16,503 --> 01:03:20,234
Don't even tell me
you want to do it again.

961
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:26,946
Why me ?
You know ? Why now ?

962
01:03:27,014 --> 01:03:30,506
Well, because you were givin' me
that look and I got all wet.

Now that I'm being ostracized
by my friends,

within your own gender--

Bitch, don't even start, all right ?
We stopped that shit years ago.

1288
01:24:05,795 --> 01:24:07,729

[ Groans ]

1290
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:16,729
Damn, this likeness rights shit
is more profitable than sellin' smoke.

1291
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:20,809
How did a dirt merchant like you
ever learn about likeness rights ?

1292
01:24:20,877 --> 01:24:24,369
We deal to a lot of lawyers.
You know what I'm sayin' ?

1293
01:24:24,447 --> 01:24:28,110
Speaking of which--
A little signin' bonus and shit ?

1294
01:24:28,184 --> 01:24:33,986
No, I'll pass.
Did you guys take a look at the issue ?

1295
01:24:34,056 --> 01:24:36,616
Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1297

You need to throw some pussy
in that book, man.

1298
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:46,032
Like, throw some supervillain
with big fuckin' tits...

and I'll just, like, suck her dry...

1300
01:24:49,038 --> 01:24:51,666
and bust some moves
on her.

1301
01:24:55,611 --> 01:24:58,978
Then she has to fuck me.
I mean, fuck us.

1302
01:24:59,048 --> 01:25:01,608
I'll see what I can do.

1303
01:25:03,586 --> 01:25:07,522
- All right, boys. What'll it be ?
- I'm all set, thanks.

1304
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:11,754
Yo, Flo. Tell Mel to whip me up
a toasted bagel with cream cheese.

and kiss my grits. Nooch.

Nah, there ain't no such thing. You
got to boil it down to the essentials.

nothin' but bitches and money

01:29:03,592 --> 01:29:06,425

you're talkin' about a couple years ago.

1369
01:29:06,495 --> 01:29:08,793
- This chick named Amy.
- When ?

1370
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:12,429

know about me...

I could just about squeeze
in the Grand-fucking-Canyon.

1374
01:29:18,808 --> 01:29:23,211
Did you know I always wanted to be
a dancer in Vegas ? Huh ?

1375
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:27,010
Bet you didn't even know
that shit, did you ?

1376
01:29:27,082 --> 01:29:29,915
Just tell your fuckin' story so
we can get out of here and smoke this.

1377
01:29:31,687 --> 01:29:36,556
So there's me and Amy. And we're
inseparable. Just big-time in love.

1378
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:39,560
Then four months down the road
the idiot gear kicks in,

1379
01:29:39,628 --> 01:29:43,086
and I ask about the ex-boyfriend which,
as we all know, is a really dumb move.

1380
01:29:43,165 --> 01:29:46,566
But you know how it is: You don't want
to know, but you just have to know.

1381
01:29:46,635 --> 01:29:48,569
Stupid guy bullshit.

1382
01:29:48,637 --> 01:29:51,128
So, anyway, she starts
tellin' me about him.

1383
01:29:51,207 --> 01:29:55,507
They fell in love, went out for
a couple of years, lived together.

1384
01:29:55,578 --> 01:29:59,480
Her mother likes me better,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm okay.

1385
01:29:59,548 --> 01:30:02,574
But then she drops the bomb on me,
and the bomb is this:

1386
01:30:02,651 --> 01:30:05,950
It seems that a couple of times,
while they were goin' out,

1387
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:08,319
he brought some people
to bed with them.

1388
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:10,756
Menage a trois,
I believe it's called.

1389
01:30:10,826 --> 01:30:14,318
Now this just blows my mind, right ?
I'm not used to this sort of thing.

1390
01:30:14,396 --> 01:30:18,765
-I was raised Catholic, for God's sakes.
-Saint Shithead.

1391
01:30:18,834 --> 01:30:20,768
Do somethin'.

1392
01:30:20,836 --> 01:30:24,101
So I'm totally weirded out by this,
right ? And I just start blastin' her.

1393
01:30:24,173 --> 01:30:26,937
I don't know how to deal with what I'm
feelin', so I figure the best way is...

1394
01:30:27,009 --> 01:30:30,001
if call her "slut," right,
and tell her she was used.

1395
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:33,139
I'm out for blood.
I really want to hurt this girl.

1396
01:30:33,215 --> 01:30:37,083
"What the fuck is your problem ?"
And she's just calmly trying to tell me,

1397
01:30:37,152 --> 01:30:41,088
" It was that time, that place," and she
doesn't think she should apologize...

1398
01:30:41,156 --> 01:30:43,249
because she doesn't feel
that she's done anything wrong.

1399
01:30:43,325 --> 01:30:48,126
I'm like, "Oh, really ?" I look her in
the eye and tell her it's over. I walk.

1400
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,013
Fuckin' A.

1401
01:30:52,089 --> 01:30:54,819
No, idiot.
It was a mistake.

1402
01:30:54,892 --> 01:30:56,951
I wasn't disgusted with her,
I was afraid.

1403
01:30:57,028 --> 01:31:00,794
You know, at that moment I felt small,
like I'd lacked experience,

1404
01:31:00,865 --> 01:31:05,393
Like I'd never be on her level, never be
enough for her or something like that.

1405
01:31:05,469 --> 01:31:08,905
But what I did not get,
she didn't care.

1406
01:31:08,973 --> 01:31:13,535
She wasn't lookin' for that guy anymore,
she was lookin' for me, for the Bob.

1407
01:31:13,611 --> 01:31:18,810
But by the time I figured this all
out, it's too late, man. She moved on.

1408
01:31:18,883 --> 01:31:22,717
All had to show for it was foolish
pride which then gave way to regret.

1409
01:31:24,321 --> 01:31:28,655
She was the girl.
I know that now.

1410
01:31:28,726 --> 01:31:31,524
But...

1411
01:31:33,097 --> 01:31:35,622
I pushed her away.

1412
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:45,939
So I've spent every day
since then chasing Amy.

1413
01:31:48,012 --> 01:31:49,980

1420
01:32:14,472 --> 01:32:16,940
I don't know how much longer
the book's gonna be around.

1421
01:32:17,007 --> 01:32:20,101
Yeah, good.
I'll be glad as shit when it's gone.

01:45:42,724 --> 01:45:44,658
Yeah.

1599
01:45:46,962 --> 01:45:48,896
Bye.

1600
01:46:00,642 --> 01:46:02,837
Okay. Who's next ?

1601
01:46:04,613 --> 01:46:06,547
Hi.

1602
01:46:12,754 --> 01:46:15,655
Thanks for readin' it.

1603
01:46:15,724 --> 01:46:18,716
I can't believe this place.
These people are so weird.

1604
01:46:18,793 --> 01:46:20,727
You wanted to come.

1605
01:46:20,795 --> 01:46:23,127
God, I can't believe you call
these people contemporaries.

1606
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:25,758
Look at this guy over here
with the pointy ears ? What's that ?

1607
01:46:25,834 --> 01:46:27,768
- He's a Vulcan.
- A what ?

1608
01:46:27,836 --> 01:46:30,202
- A Vulcan. Jesus, potzer.
- [ Laughs ]

1609
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:32,763
Why don't you take a walk
and get us something to drink ?

1610
01:46:32,841 --> 01:46:34,274
Okay, I will.

1611
01:46:53,132 --> 01:46:55,157
Um, this isn't
one of mine.

1612
01:46:55,234 --> 01:46:57,168
It's mine.

1613
01:46:58,804 --> 01:47:00,999
I saved you a copy.

1614
01:47:04,276 --> 01:47:06,210
Hi.

1615
01:47:06,278 --> 01:47:08,212
Hi.

1616
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,612
How've you been ?

1617
01:47:10,683 --> 01:47:15,120
Uh, good. Really good.
Yourself ?

1618
01:47:15,187 --> 01:47:17,121
Good.

1619
01:47:23,829 --> 01:47:27,424
The new issue's selling
like crazy, for some reason.

1620
01:47:27,499 --> 01:47:31,230
Yeah, well, it's because it's
really good. I liked it a lot.

1621
01:47:31,303 --> 01:47:33,237
Thank you.

1622
01:47:35,841 --> 01:47:38,537
I haven't even seen this yet.
Did it just come out ?

1623
01:47:38,611 --> 01:47:42,138
Uh, oh, about a month ago.
I did a really small run.

1624
01:47:42,214 --> 01:47:44,307
Self-financed,
only about 500 issues.

1625
01:47:44,383 --> 01:47:47,045
Will I enjoy it ?

1626
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:50,744
You might.
It's familiar subject matter.

1627
01:48:08,273 --> 01:48:12,073
Looks like
a very personal story.

1628
01:48:15,214 --> 01:48:19,310
[ Sighs ] I finally had
something personal to say.

1629
01:48:24,323 --> 01:48:27,850
Well, I'm gonna go.
I don't wanna hold up your line here.

1630
01:48:27,926 --> 01:48:30,486
Yeah.

1631
01:48:30,562 --> 01:48:34,498
I mean, it can get ugly. I just saw
this nun call a small child a cunt-rag.

1632
01:48:34,566 --> 01:48:36,500
[ Chuckles ]

1633
01:48:42,941 --> 01:48:45,341
You know, read that,
if you have a minute.

1634
01:48:45,411 --> 01:48:47,879
I will.

1635
01:48:51,617 --> 01:48:56,520
If you get the chance, call me. I'd like
to hear your thoughts, or... whatever.

1636
01:48:56,588 --> 01:48:59,352
Okay.

1637
01:49:00,926 --> 01:49:02,860
Okay.

1638
01:49:05,197 --> 01:49:07,324
It was really nice
seeing you again.

1639
01:49:07,399 --> 01:49:10,630
It was really nice
to see you too.

1640
01:49:24,149 --> 01:49:27,448
- Who was that ?
- Huh ?

1641
01:49:27,519 --> 01:49:29,384
Who was that ?

1642
01:49:39,298 --> 01:49:43,394
Oh, just some guy I knew.

1643
01:49:56,715 --> 01:50:00,515
Next. So, what do you want
to do tonight ?

1644
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:07,315
 I was tappin' my foot
on a Friday night

1645
01:50:07,392 --> 01:50:12,352
 To my favorite band
I was pushed aside

1646
01:50:12,431 --> 01:50:17,368
 I said hey, don't push me
No, no, no one pushes me

1647
01:50:17,436 --> 01:50:22,373
 When I was face to face
with a woman I admired

1648
01:50:22,441 --> 01:50:24,864
And she gave me this look

1649
01:50:24,997 --> 01:50:27,329
I could not believe

1650
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:32,531
And the cold stare remained
I wanted to leave

1651
01:50:34,941 --> 01:50:40,208
 Yeah, I do believe anger
is offset by sorrow

1652
01:50:40,279 --> 01:50:45,080
 But you destroy today
you might regret tomorrow

1653
01:50:45,151 --> 01:50:47,779
 When you're young
and defensive

1654
01:50:47,854 --> 01:50:50,186
 It comes off offensive

1655
01:50:50,256 --> 01:50:55,159
And it's hard to repay the
tolerance that you borrowed

1656
01:50:55,228 --> 01:51:00,393
 The lasting relationship
sinks right off the pier
