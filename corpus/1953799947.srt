[MALE INTERVIEWER]
YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?

2
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,763
I'M 63 YEARS OLD.

3
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:26,265
I'M LIKELY TO SKATE MY WAY
TO THE GRAVE,

4
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:29,644
BUT I HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN
WHO ARE ALL ENGINEERS,

5
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:32,647
AND I WORRY ABOUT
THEIR ABILITY TO WORK

6
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:35,537
IN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING
DOWN THE ROAD...

[MACHINERY CHUGGING]

8
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,529
[MAN]
I THINK THAT THE WATER'S
GOING TO GET HOTTER AND HOTTER,

9
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:25,616
AND IF THERE IS NO EVENT
TO WAKE PEOPLE UP,

10
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:27,910
I THINK CHINA CAN JUST OWN

11
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,496
MORE AND MORE AND MORE
AND MORE OF OUR DEBT,

12
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:32,622
AND EVERYTHING'S FINE

13
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:35,625
UNTIL THAT MAGICAL MOMENT
WHEN IT'S NOT,

14
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,753
AND ALL THE SORRIES
IN THE WORLD

15
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:39,885

ANY DIFFERENT.

[MALE NARRATOR]
THE FILM YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE

17
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:52,101
ADDRESSES ONE OF
THE MOST URGENT PROBLEMS
FACING AMERICA--

18
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:55,229
IT'S INCREASINGLY DESTRUCTIVE

19

WITH A RAPIDLY RISING CHINA.

20
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:00,651
AS YOU WATCH THIS FILM,

21
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:03,446
IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS
DISTINGUISH CLEARLY

22
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:06,741
BETWEEN THE GOOD AND
HARDWORKING PEOPLE OF CHINA

23

AND THEIR REPRESSIVE
COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT

24

NOW VICTIMIZING BOTH AMERICAN
AND CHINESE CITIZENS ALIKE.

I'M HERE TO BUY ME
A BIG-SCREEN TV,

WHERE'S THAT PRODUCT MADE?

29
00:02:54,747 --> 00:02:56,040
PROBABLY IN CHINA.

00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,166
CHINA.
CHINA.

31
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,708
THIS IS MADE IN CHINA.

32
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,671
[INTERVIEWER]
DO YOU KNOW HERE THAT BIKE
WAS MADE?

33
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:04,506
NO, BUT I KNOW IT'S HUFFY.

34
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:06,217
WHERE WERE THESE PRODUCTS MADE?
DO YOU KNOW?

35
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:10,137
PROBABLY FROM CHINA WHERE
EVERYTHING ELSE IS MADE.

36
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:12,475
OH, THIS [BLEEP]
IS MADE IN AMERICA.

37

WELL, AMERICAN IS BETTER.

38
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,687
SO IS THIS AMERICAN?

39
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,147
I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS AMERICAN,

40
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,940
BUT HOPEFULLY IT IS.

41
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,359
[MAN #2] YEAH,
I THINK I GOT A GREAT DEAL.

42
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,404
YOU CAN'T BEAT 300 BUCKS
FOR A 46-INCH TV.

43
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:27,946
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

44
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,949
I DIDN'T EVEN COME HERE
EXACTLY FOR THIS,

45
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,243
BUT I SEEN IT AND COULDN'T
PASS UP THE DEAL, MAN.

46
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:35,246
FOR, YOU KNOW, $200, YOU CAN'T
REALLY, YOU KNOW, BEAT THAT,

47
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:37,331
SO THEY TOLD ME IT WAS 200,

48
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,791
AND NOW THAT'S IN MY--
IT'S IN MY CART NOW.

49
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,042
DID YOU SEE WHERE IT WAS MADE?

50
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,420
OH, YEAH,
IT WAS MADE IN CHINA.

51
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,213
HEY, I'M FINE WITH IT,
YOU KNOW.

52
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:46,799
IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN'T
PROVIDE ME WITH WHAT I NEED,

53
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,092
I GOTTA GET IT FROM CHINA.

54
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,886

DON'T HATE ME.

57
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:37,141
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
WHEN AMERICANS BUY
CHINESE PRODUCTS?

58
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:39,434
I FEEL REALLY BAD BECAUSE
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IS

59
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:42,437
IT'S NOT JUST AMERICA
IS BUYING UP CHINESE PRODUCTS.

60
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:44,482
IT'S THAT AMERICAN PEOPLE
ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS.

61
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:48,235
I WAS LAID OFF THREE TIMES
WITHIN SIX MONTHS

62
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:50,071
UNTIL I WAS PERMANENTLY
LAID OFF.

63
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:53,740
I GRADUATED
WITH MY BACHELOR'S IN 2004.

64
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,454
I'VE BEEN OUT TRYING
TO USE THAT OF COURSE

65
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:00,456
BECAUSE I SPENT
A LOT OF MONEY GOING TO SCHOOL,

66
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:03,042
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO FIND ANYTHING.

67
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:03,836
CHINA, I THINK, IS RESPONSIBLE

68
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:08,297
FOR WIPING OUT A GOOD DEAL
OF THE MANUFACTURING

69
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:11,759
THAT WE HAVE, OR HAD,
IN NORTHEAST OHIO.

70
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,511
AND I THINK THAT IS CONTINUING

71
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,805
AS THEY CONTINUE TO MANIPULATE
THEIR CURRENCY,

72
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:20,184
AS THEY CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE
THE LEVEL OF WORKPLACE SAFETY

73
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:23,103
OR ENVIRONMENTAL
OR HEALTH STANDARDS

74
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,771
THAT WE HAVE HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES.

75
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:28,901
SO WE'VE SEEN OUR WHOLE
MANUFACTURING BASE

76
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:32,196
UPROOT AND REPLANT

77
00:05:32,196 --> 00:05:38,285
IN A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN COMMIT
CRIMES AGAINST WORKERS

78
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:41,204
AND JUST GO OUT
TO DINNER THAT NIGHT.

79
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:42,456
SO WHEN A LARGE COMPANY

80
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,958
DECIDES TO MOVE ITS PRODUCTION
OFF SHORE

81
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,251
AND IT CLOSES A FACTORY

82
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:47,252
IN A CITY OR A
TOWN IN THE UNITED STATES,

83
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:50,131
THAT BASICALLY LEAVES--
IT'S LIKE A BLACK HOLE.

84
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:52,049
SUDDENLY THAT FACTORY
JUST DISAPPEARS,

85
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:54,009
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
GOES DOWN WITH IT.

86
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:55,636
JOBS DISAPPEAR,

87
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:57,013
AND THE WAY THE ECONOMY'S
GOING RIGHT NOW,

88
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,347
IT'S TOUGH TO FIND A JOB.

89
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,475
I JUST RECENTLY FINISHED
GRADUATE SCHOOL,

90
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:03,895
AND EVEN COMING OUT WITH THAT,
IT'S STILL HARD TO FIND ONE.

91
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,105
SOME OF THE WORKERS
AT COMPANIES,

92
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:09,317
LITERALLY THEIR LAST ACT
AT THE FACTORY

93
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:11,110
WAS TO UNBOLT THE MACHINE

94
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,403
AND LOAD IT UP
TO BE SHIPPED OFF TO CHINA.

95
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:15,239
I EVEN TALKED
TO A FELLA DOWN THERE.

96
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,699
THEY WANTED TO SEND HIM

97
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,619
OVER TO CHINA
TO TEACH THE PEOPLE

98
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:24,331
HOW TO RUN THE MACHINES THAT
THEY WERE SHIPPING OVER THERE.

99
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:26,292
HE WAS 63 YEARS OLD.

100
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,169
HE SAID, "I ONLY GOT
TWO MORE YEARS TO GO,

101
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,379
AND I CAN RETIRE,
SO I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER
DOING IT."

102
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,340
HE SAID,
"BAD ENOUGH THEY TOOK MY JOB.

103
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,509
NOW THEY WANT ME TO SHOW THEM
HOW TO DO IT, TOO."

104
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,136
PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPLYING
THAT PLANT WITH MATERIALS,

105
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:39,472
EQUIPMENT,
MAINTENANCE SERVICES,

106
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:41,057
EVEN THE ACCOUNTING FIRMS,

107
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:43,350
DESIGN FIRMS, R&D FIRMS,

108
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,062
AND THEN ALL THE OTHER SERVICES
AROUND IT, LIKE RESTAURANTS,

109
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,105
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM?

110
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:50,273
THEY'RE DOOMED.
THEY GO DOWN WITH IT.

111
00:06:50,273 --> 00:06:52,944
THEY CAN'T FOLLOW THAT COMPANY
OFFSHORE TO SHANGHAI.

112
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,444
IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE UNEMPLOYED

113
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:55,862
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MORTGAGE

114
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:57,657
AND YOU HAVE YOUR REGULAR BILLS
YOU HAVE TO PAY.

115
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:58,865
YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR A CAR,

116
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,242
AND YOU HAVE TO PUT FOOD
ON THE TABLE,

117
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:02,619
AND WHEN YOU HAVE
JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY

118
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:03,871
FROM THE STATE COMING IN,

119
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:04,831
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO MAKE IT.

120
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:08,960
I'M TRYING TO GET FOOD.

121
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,336
LIKE, THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

122
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:14,090
I MEAN, THIS IS NOT JUST
AN UNEMPLOYMENT LINE.

123
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,927
THIS IS FOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE HUNGRY,
AND I'M HUNGRY.

124
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,679
AND IT JUST REALLY IS UNFAIR

125
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:22,557
THAT BEING IN A COUNTRY
AS GREAT AS THE UNITED STATES

126
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:24,975
TO HAVE OUR PEOPLE STRUGGLING
THE WAY THEY ARE

127
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:28,980
TO NOT FIND WHAT IS JUST
COMMON-- YOU WORK.

128
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,814
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

129
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:33,151
AND FOR THEM NOT TO FIND THAT
MONTH AFTER MONTH AND MONTH,

130
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,651
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
TO ME.

131
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:38,405
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S THE PRESIDENT.

132
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:41,742
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE--

133
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:44,119
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHO TO POINT THE BLAME TO.

134
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,746
IF WE TALK ABOUT WHO'S TO BLAME,

135
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:47,122
I THINK PARTIALLY
OUR OWN GOVERNMENT.

136
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:48,999
OUR GOVERNMENT
SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING.

137
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:51,169
THEY COULD HAVE STEPPED IN,
I THINK, A LONG TIME AGO.

138
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,047
PLEASE HEAR US,
AND PLEASE UNDERSTAND

139
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,550
THAT COMPANIES
LIKE THIS ARE SPECIAL.

140
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,177
SMALL COMPANIES
ARE WHAT MAKES AMERICA,

141
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:02,388
AND UNLESS SOMEBODY
DOES SOMETHING

142
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:06,309
ABOUT UNRESTRICTED IMPORTING,

143
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:07,999
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE
THE REST OF US, TOO.

144
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:37,715
WE'VE NEVER HAD A REALLY BIG
AND HOSTILE COUNTRY

145
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:39,425
COME INTO OUR MARKETS.

146
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:42,093
MOST OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMPETITION WE HAVE FACED,

147
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:45,555
FROM JAPAN, FROM GERMANY,
FROM THE REST OF EUROPE,

148
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:47,057
HAS COME WITHOUT A SENSE

149
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:49,643
THAT BEHIND IT WAS A GOVERNMENT

150
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:52,438
THAT HAS SOUGHT CONFRONTATIONS
WITH THE UNITED STATES

151
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:53,564
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

152
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:56,567
THE WTO-- IT'S NOT BASED HERE.

153
00:08:56,567 --> 00:09:00,947
WHO IN THE UNITED STATES
IS ON THE WTO?

154
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:02,906
DOES ANYBODY KNOW?

155
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:08,663
IN 2001 CHINA JOINED THE WTO--
THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION--

156
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,998
WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT
OF A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT

157
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:15,002
AND A REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED
CONGRESS.

158
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:18,588
BEFORE THE INK WAS DRY
ON THIS FREE TRADE AGREEMENT,

159
00:09:18,588 --> 00:09:21,217
CHINA BEGAN FLOODING
AMERICAN MARKETS

160
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:21,801
WITH ITS ILLEGALLY SUBSIDIZED

161
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,636
AND VERY DANGEROUS EXPORTS

162
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:27,055
WHILE THE BIG
MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES

163
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:29,599
THAT HAD LOBBIED
HEAVILY FOR THE AGREEMENT

164
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,563
RAPIDLY ACCELERATED
THE OFF SHORING
OF AMERICAN FACTORIES

165
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:36,732
AND AMERICAN JOBS TO CHINA.

166
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:40,277
TODAY, AS A RESULT OF THE
BIGGEST POLITICAL SHELL GAME

167
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:42,155
IN AMERICAN ECONOMIC HISTORY,

168
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:45,199
CHINA HAS STOLEN THOUSANDS
OF OUR FACTORIES

169
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,535
AND MILLIONS OF OUR JOBS,

170
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:50,413
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION
PROFITS ARE SOARING,

171
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:53,540
AND WE NOW OWE
OVER $3 TRILLION

172
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,627
TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST
COMMUNIST NATION.

173
00:09:56,627 --> 00:10:00,088
THIS WAS NOT HOW IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO TURN OUT--

174
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:01,464
[MAN]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

175
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:03,092
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

176
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:04,886
...WHEN WILLIAM
JEFFERSON CLINTON

177
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:06,471
WAS SELLING CHINA'S ENTRY

178
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,514
INTO THE WORLD TRADE
ORGANIZATION

179
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:10,974
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

180
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:13,685
IF YOU BELIEVE IN A FUTURE
OF GREATER OPENNESS AND FREEDOM

181
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:15,271
FOR THE PEOPLE OF CHINA,

182
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,899
YOU OUTTA BE
FOR THIS AGREEMENT.

183
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:20,108
IF YOU BELIEVE IN A FUTURE
OF GREATER PROSPERITY

184
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,569
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

185
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:24,655
YOU CERTAINLY SHOULD BE
FOR THIS AGREEMENT.

186
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:27,241
IF YOU BELIEVE IN A FUTURE
OF PEACE AND SECURITY

187
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,202
FOR ASIA AND THE WORLD,

188
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,746
YOU SHOULD BE
FOR THIS AGREEMENT.

189
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:33,789
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

190
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:36,083
IT'S AN HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY

191
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:40,295
AND A PROFOUND AMERICAN
RESPONSIBILITY.

192
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:44,175
IN PUSHING FOR CHINA'S ENTRY
INTO THE WTO,

193
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:46,676
PRESIDENT CLINTON EMBRACED
A DOCTRINE DATING BACK

194
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:48,512
TO PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON,

195
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:52,309
KNOWN IN WASHINGTON CIRCLES
AS THE "POLICY OF ENGAGEMENT."

196
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:56,145
[FILMSTRIP NARRATOR]
PEKING-- HISTORIC SITE

197
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:58,772
FOR AN UNPRECEDENTED MEETING
BETWEEN EAST AND WEST.

198
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:00,482
PRESIDENT AND MRS. NIXON
ARRIVE

199
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,609
AND PREMIER CHOU EN LAI
IS ON HAND

200
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:03,944
TO EXTEND AN OFFICIAL WELCOME

201
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:05,530
TO THE PRESIDENTIAL COUPLE.

202
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,824
IT'S MR. NIXON'S INITIAL MOVE

203
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:11,288
TOWARDS HIS SELF-PROCLAIMED
GOAL-- A GENERATION OF PEACE.

204
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:17,083
[NARRATOR]
HERE, PRESIDENT CLINTON
OFFERS HIS OWN VISION

205
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:17,834
OF THE GOAL OF ENGAGING CHINA.

206
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,627
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S RIGHT

207
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:23,046
TO CRACK DOWN ON PEOPLE

208
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,842
FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS
OR THEIR POLITICAL EXPRESSION

209
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:27,676
OR BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE

210
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:29,679
IN AN ASSOCIATION
LIKE THE FALUN GONG.

211
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,430
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT,

212
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,808
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE

213
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:36,727
THAT WE WILL HAVE
MORE INFLUENCE ON CHINA

214
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,313
BY GIVING THEM
THE BACK OF OUR HAND.

215
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:41,232
IN MASTERFULLY ARGUING

216
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:44,484
FOR CHINA'S ENTRY INTO
THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION,

217
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,902
PRESIDENT CLINTON

218
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:47,863
PROMISED THE BRIGHTEST
OF FUTURES

219
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:51,784
FOR BOTH AMERICAN WORKERS
AND AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS.

220
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:54,286
ECONOMICALLY, THIS AGREEMENT

221
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:57,622
IS THE EQUIVALENT
OF A ONE-WAY STREET.

222
00:11:57,622 --> 00:12:00,876
IT REQUIRES CHINA
TO OPEN ITS MARKETS

223
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:03,128
WITH A FIFTH
OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION,

224
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:04,881
POTENTIALLY THE BIGGEST
MARKETS IN THE WORLD.

225
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:06,966
FOR THE FIRST TIME
CHINA WILL AGREE TO PLAY

226
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,426
BY THE SAME OPEN
TRADING RULES WE DO.

227
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:10,678
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

228
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:12,387
FOR THE FIRST TIME
OUR COMPANIES

229
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:14,681
WILL BE ABLE TO SELL AND
DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS IN CHINA

230
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,060
MADE BY WORKERS
HERE IN AMERICA.

231
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,231
AND BY ECONOMICALLY
ENGAGING CHINA,

232
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:23,817
BOTH DEMOCRATS
AND REPUBLICANS ARGUED,

233
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:28,695
THIS WOULD ULTIMATELY
DEMOCRATIZE THE CHINESE DRAGON

234
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:31,324
AND FREE THE CHINESE PEOPLE.

235
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:33,992
WE HAVE WAGED
AN INTENSE BATTLE

236
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:38,164
IN SUPPORT
OF AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE,
AND THAT IS FREEDOM.

237
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:41,083
AND THE PEOPLE OF CHINA
AND THE CITIZENS
OF THE UNITED STATES

238
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,543
WILL BENEFIT ENORMOUSLY.

239
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:44,545
AFTER THE VICTORY VOTE,

240
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:46,796
THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE
MAJORITY LEADERS

241
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:49,007
WOULD CELEBRATE
THE BI-PARTISAN VICTORY

242
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:52,469
WITH THE CRACKING OPEN
OF A CEREMONIAL
FORTUNE COOKIE.

243
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:53,679
I'M NOT VERY GOOD
AT THESE THINGS.

244
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,930
WHOA.

245
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,602
[SPECTATORS LAUGHING]

246
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:02,479
IT'S GOT A LOTTERY NUMBER.
NO.

247
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,482
IT SAYS NEW AMERICAN PROVERB--

248
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,483
NEW PROSPERITY AWAITS YOU

249
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:08,069
BECAUSE NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS.

250
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:09,529
YEA.

251
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,823
IT'S A CONFRONTATION
OF WORLD VIEWS

252
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,115
THAT WE WILL WIN,

253
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:13,911
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE FUTURE.

254
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:21,122
SO JUST WHAT HAS AMERICA'S
FUTURE LOOKED LIKE

255
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:25,294
SINCE CHINA JOINED THE WORLD
TRADE ORGANIZATION IN 2001?

256
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:27,295
WE ARE IN A TRADE WAR

257
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:29,214
AND STEALING, LYING,
AND CHEATING

258
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:31,175
ON THE PART OF THE CHINESE
IS ALL PART OF IT.

259
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:31,801
FREE TRADE'S GREAT STUFF
IF YOU CAN GET IT,

260
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,679
BUT WHAT WE HAVE WITH CHINA
IS NOT FREE TRADE.

261
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,430
FOR CHINA TO SELL SOMETHING
AT 1/10th THE PRICE

262
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,142
OF WHAT IT WOULD COST
IN THE UNITED STATES TO PRODUCE,

263
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:43,271
THEY ARE CHEATING MONUMENTALLY,

264
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:45,522
IN A MAJOR,
MASSIVE SORT OF WAY.

265
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:46,109
ON EVERYTHING.

266
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:53,155
WHEN CHINA JOINED THE WORLD
TRADE ORGANIZATION IN 2001,

267
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,866
IT PROMISED TO STOP CHEATING

268
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:57,742
AND PLAY BY FAIR TRADE RULES.

269
00:13:57,742 --> 00:14:01,038
THAT MEANT ABANDONING UNFAIR
TRADE PRACTICES

270
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:04,375
LIKE CURRENCY MANIPULATION,

271
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,296
ILLEGAL EXPORT SUBSIDIES...

272
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:12,300
AND ABUSING ITS WORKERS.

273
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,801
INSTEAD,
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

274
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,762
HAS USED THESE WEAPONS
OF JOB DESTRUCTION

275
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:20,766
TO LAUNCH A SUSTAINED
AND DEVASTATING ATTACK

276
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:23,019
ON AMERICA'S FACTORIES
AND JOBS

277
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:23,811
WHILE FLOODING OUR MARKETS

278
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:26,068
WITH DANGEROUS PRODUCTS.

279
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:32,862
THERE'S NO QUESTION

280
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:34,905
THAT A LARGE PART OF CHINA'S
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

281
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:37,366
HAS COME FROM
ENVIRONMENTAL NEGLECT.

282
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:40,953
BUT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S
WILLINGNESS TO USE POLLUTION

283
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:42,246
AS A COMPETITIVE EDGE

284
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:44,247
HAS COME AT A VERY HEAVY PRICE.

285
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:47,168
[MAN]
CHINA HAS THE MOST DEGRADED
ENVIRONMENT IN THE WORLD.

286
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,628
SIXTEEN OF THE WORLD'S
20 DIRTIEST CITIES

287
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:51,255
ARE LOCATED
IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC.

288
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:54,300
LESS THAN ONE PERCENT
OF THEIR URBAN AIR

289
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,675
MEETS THE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS

290
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:57,219
SET BY THE EUROPEAN UNION.

291
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:59,889
IT'S DIFFICULT TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING,

292
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,099
PARTICULARLY TO THE LUNGS
OF CHILDREN BREATHING AIR
LIKE THAT.

293
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:04,352
[McCORMACK]
IN ONE FELL SWOOP,

294
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,978
YOU CAN MOVE YOUR PRODUCTION
TO CHINA

295
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:08,189
AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL
WITH A HUNDRED YEARS
OF REGULATIONS

296
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:10,232
THAT WE'VE PUT INTO PLACE TO
PROTECT OUR WORKERS,

297
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:11,608
TO PROTECT OUR SOCIETY,

298
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,194
JUST BY MOVING
YOUR PRODUCTION TO CHINA

299
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:15,404
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY.

300
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:18,324
THEY HAVE WHAT WE HAD
PROBABLY IN 1910.

301
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:22,245
THE MOST TRAGIC STORY
IS THE "CANCER VILLAGES"

302
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:25,247
BECAUSE OF TOXIC METALS
IN THE SOIL,

303
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:26,915
BECAUSE OF THE POLLUTION,

304
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:28,959
BECAUSE MANUFACTURERS

305
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,338
HAVE NOT BEEN FORCED
TO CLEAN UP THEIR PLANTS,

306
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:33,881
AND SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE HAVE

307
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:36,550
IS THE WORLD'S
MOST DEGRADED ENVIRONMENT.

308
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,219
WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
HEAVY METALS POLLUTION,

309
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:40,972
AIR POLLUTION,
WATER POLLUTION,

310
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:42,640
CHINA'S GOT IT ALL.

311
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,142
AND PARTICULARLY
FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES

312
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:47,060
LIKE CHEMICALS OR STEEL,

313
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,564
THE ABILITY TO WANTONLY
POLLUTE IN CHINA

314
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:51,940
ADDS UP TO
A HUGE COST ADVANTAGE

315
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,943
IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE.

316
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,487
[MAN] IF A COMPANY
LIKE BAO STEEL IN CHINA

317
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:59,240
IS ALLOWED TO DUMP POLLUTION
INTO THE YANGTZE RIVER

318
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,575
WHEN, SAY,
A UNITED STATES STEEL COMPANY

319
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:04,035
IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO THE SAME
IN THE OHIO RIVER,

320
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:06,122
THAT'S GOING TO BE A SOURCE
OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

321
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:07,540
FOR THE CHINESE

322
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,001
BECAUSE POLLUTION CONTROL
COSTS MONEY.

323
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,252
IT PROVIDES THEM
AN ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE

324
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:17,007
IN ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OF
APPROXIMATELY $40 A STEEL TON,

325
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:21,053
OR REPRESENTS ABOUT
5% OF THE COST OF PRODUCING
THAT STEEL.

326
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:23,973
[INTERVIEWER]
IS A 5% COST ADVANTAGE
SIGNIFICANT?

327
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:25,558
IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY

328
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:29,478
A 5% COST ADVANTAGE IS GREATER
THAN OUR PROFITABILITY.

329
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:31,521
AND HERE'S THE ULTIMATE IRONY--

330
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,567
THE MORE WE ALLOW
OUR AMERICAN MULTINATIONALS

331
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,651
TO OFFSHORE PRODUCTION
TO CHINA,

332
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:39,112
THE MORE TOTAL
GLOBAL POLLUTION WE CREATE

333
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:41,031
AND A GOOD BIT OF THAT

334
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:44,242
COMES RIGHT BACK TO AMERICA
BY WAY OF THE JET STREAM.

335
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:48,915
CARBON EMISSIONS IN CHINA
PER THOUSAND DOLLARS OF GNP

336
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:51,791
ARE SEVEN TIMES WHAT THEY ARE
IN THE UNITED STATES.

337
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,713
THAT LEADS TO CARBON EMISSIONS
AND PARTICULATE MATTER

338
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:59,050
FALLING ALL ALONG THE COAST
OF THE UNITED STATES.

339
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,804
25% OF THE PARTICULATE EMISSIONS

340
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,597
FALLING IN CALIFORNIA

341
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:09,021
ARE FROM ASIA IN GENERAL
AND CHINA IN PARTICULAR.

342
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:13,647
[WOMAN]
THEY'RE GOOD AND BAD REASONS

343
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:16,067
WHY GOODS ARE CHEAP
IN THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY.

344
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,151
THE GOOD REASON IS THAT
SOMEBODY IS A GOOD PRODUCER,

345
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:20,279
THAT THEY'RE QUICK,
THAT THEY GET THE PRODUCT
TO MARKET,

346
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,948
THEY HAVE GOOD TECHNOLOGY,

347
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:23,616
THAT THEIR WORKERS ARE
EFFICIENT AND WELL-TRAINED.

348
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:27,787
THE BAD REASON IS THAT
THE WORKERS ARE TREATED
LIKE DIRT.

349
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:30,915
WHEN THE WORKERS IN CHINA
ARE BEING ABUSED,

350
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:34,292
THEN WORKERS IN AMERICA
HAVE A TOUGHER TIME COMPETING
AGAINST THEM.

351
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:36,378
[McCORMACK]
AS AN EMPLOYER IN CHINA,

352
00:17:36,378 --> 00:17:37,839
DO YOU HAVE ANY REGULATIONS YOU
HAVE TO DEAL WITH,

353
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,384
LIKE OSHA, LABOR REGULATIONS?

354
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:44,636
DO YOU HAVE TO PAY EVEN SOCIAL
SECURITY OR MEDICARE?

355
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:48,890
DO YOU HAVE TO PROTECT
YOUR WORKERS IN DIFFICULT
OR UNSAFE CONDITIONS?

356
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,393
NO.

357
00:17:50,393 --> 00:17:52,185
NO, NO, NO, NO.

358
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,062
NO, YOU DON'T.

359
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:57,692
YOU GO TO PRISON IF YOU TRY
TO FORM A LABOR UNION.

360
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:59,277
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION,

361
00:17:59,277 --> 00:17:59,819
THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE
AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY,

362
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,989
ARE COMPLETELY ABSENT
IN CHINA TODAY.

363
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:07,534
THERE'S NO EQUIVALENT TO OSHA,
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
REGULATIONS--

364
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:11,289
AND THEY LOSE ABOUT 130,000
MEN AND WOMEN TO--

365
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:12,790
AND THAT'S THE ONES
THEY REPORT ON--

366
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,126
TO ACCIDENTS PER YEAR

367
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:18,378
THAT MANY OF WHICH
COULD BE PREVENTED
WITH GOOD PROTECTION.

368
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:21,048
THEY DON'T COMPLY WITH
THEIR OWN CHILD LABOR LAWS,

369
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:23,134
PRISON LABOR LAWS,
HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS,

370
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:24,635
MINIMUM WAGE LAWS.

371
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,095
WELL, THERE'S A DR. LEE,

372
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:27,512
WHO LIVES IN NEW JERSEY,

373
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,514
WHO WAS ACTUALLY
AN AMERICAN CITIZEN,

374
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:31,224
AND HE WAS IN CHINA,
AND HE WAS ARRESTED

375
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:33,853
AND KEPT IN ONE OF THEIR WORK
CAMPS FOR THREE YEARS.

376
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:35,354
WHEN HE WAS FINALLY RELEASED,

377
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:37,147
THANKS TO PRESSURE
FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

378
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:39,442
HE CAME BACK TO NEW JERSEY,
AND HE WAS IN A STORE,

379
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:42,800
AND HE SAW THESE BIG SLIPPERS
THAT HE'D MADE
IN THE WORK CAMP.

380
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,094
HOW CAN WAL-MART,
OR ANYONE ELSE
IN THE UNITED STATES,

381
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:09,262
ALLOW PRODUCTION FACILITIES
IN CHINA

382
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:11,682
TO SELL GARMENTS, CHOPSTICKS,

383
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,225
CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS

384
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:15,019
THAT ARE MADE
IN FORCED LABOR CAMPS?

385
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,480
[WU] YOU CAN GO TO CHINA,
GO TO EVERY PRISON CAMP.

386
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,607
YOU CAN SEE WHAT
ARE THE PRISONERS DOING.

387
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,755
EVERYBODY VERY BUSY.

388
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:47,135
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT CHINA
CURRENCY MANIPULATION,

389
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,886
BUT A LOT OF IT IS.

390
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,138
CHINA MANIPULATES ITS CURRENCY

391
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:54,767
BY ILLEGALLY PEGGING
THE VALUE OF THE CHINESE YUAN

392
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,394
TO THAT OF THE U.S. DOLLAR

393
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,980
AT A RATE FAR BELOW
MARKET VALUE.

394
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,940
MOST ECONOMISTS WOULD SAY

395
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,484
THAT CHINA GETS ANYWHERE
FROM A 25 TO 40 CENT ADVANTAGE

396
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:06,486
FOR EVERY DOLLAR.

397
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:08,947
SO IT'S LIKE HAVING
A TARIFF ON GOODS COMING

398
00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:10,826
FROM THE UNITED STATES
OF 40 OR 50%

399
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:14,537
BY THE AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE
UNDERPRICING THEIR CURRENCY.

400
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,746
IT ALSO GIVES THEIR EXPORTS

401
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:18,124
TO THE UNITED STATES

402
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:20,960
A SUBSIDY OF 40 OR 50%

403
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,253
TO CAPTURE OUR MARKET

404
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,463
AND KNOCK OUT
DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES

405
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:27,591
THAT MIGHT BE COMPETING
WITH THEM.

406
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:29,551
SIMPLY, AN UNDERVALUED CURRENCY

407
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:31,846
MAKES CHINESE COFFEEMAKERS
$10 A PIECE

408
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,723
INSTEAD OF 15 OR 20.

409
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:39,311
AND IT MAKES AMERICAN CARS
IN CHINA $30,000 INSTEAD OF 25.

410
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:40,771
IN OTHER WORDS,

411
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,772
CHINA'S MANIPULATED CURRENCY

412
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:44,942
ACTS AS A HUGE SUBSIDY

413
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,153
TO CHINESE EXPORTS TO AMERICA

414
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:50,114
AND AN EQUALLY
BIG TARIFF BARRIER

415
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:54,367
BLOCKING AMERICAN EXPORTS
TO CHINA.

416
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,869
THE RESULT--

417
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:57,329
MORE JOBS IN CHINA,

418
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:59,290
FEWER JOBS IN AMERICA,

419
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:04,544
AND A HUGE AND CHRONIC
AMERICAN TRADE DEFICIT
WITH CHINA.

420
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:08,465
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
DOES NOT DENY THIS.

421
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,717
CHINESE OFFICIALS THEMSELVES

422
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:13,930
SAY THAT THEY FIX THE VALUE
OF THEIR CURRENCIES

423
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,807
TO HELP CHINESE WORKERS.

424
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,934
WHEN PREMIER WEN JIABAO WAS IN
THIS COUNTRY RECENTLY,

425
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:21,729
HE SAID, "IF WE ALLOW
THE CURRENCY TO FLOAT,

426
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,647
CHINESE COMPANIES
ARE GONNA GO BANKRUPT."

427
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:26,697
OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT
AMERICAN WORKERS?

428
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:35,283
[REP. RYAN]
THEY'RE CHEATING
ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

429
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:39,329
BY JUST FLAT OUT PIRATING
STUFF FROM THE UNITED STATES.

430
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:43,041
YOU DON'T WANT CHINA TO GET
THEIR HANDS ON YOUR LATEST PIECE
OF TECHNOLOGY, WHATEVER,

431
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,585
BECAUSE THEY WILL COPY IT,

432
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:47,003
AND THEY WILL TURN AROUND
AND PRODUCE IT.

433
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:51,550
MOST FAMOUSLY,
COPYRIGHT PIRATES IN CHINA
ARE STAMPING OUT DISNEY DVDS.

434
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,386
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS OF.

435
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:57,181
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
IS THE THEFT OF THE BLUEPRINTS,

436
00:21:57,181 --> 00:21:59,224
FOR EXAMPLE,
FOR HIGH TECHNOLOGIES.

437
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:01,935
I MEAN, I HEAR ALL THE TIME
ABOUT AMERICAN COMPANIES

438
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:05,356
WHO FIND THEMSELVES COMPETING
IN THE MARKETPLACE
WITH A CHINESE PRODUCT,

439
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,732
AND THEY TAKE IT APART,

440
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:08,943
AND THEY FIND THEMSELVES
LOOKING IN THE MIRROR

441
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:11,945
BECAUSE THE CHINESE
HAVE JUST STOLEN THE PLANS
OF THEIR OWN PRODUCT.

442
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:14,866
AND ONE OF AMERICA'S
HIGHEST TECH COMPANIES

443
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:19,119
HAS CERTAINLY EXPERIENCED
THIS KIND OF PIRACY FIRSTHAND

444
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:23,456
AND A SCHOOL OF VERY HARD
KNOCKS AT THE HANDS
OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.

445
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:25,501
[CHANG] GOOGLE CAME
INTO THE CHINESE MARKET

446
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:28,128
AND OF COURSE, IT ENDED UP
WITH A DOMINANT MARKET SHARE.

447
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:31,382
BUT BEIJING WANTED BAIDU,
A LOCAL COMPANY,

448
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:33,967
TO BE ABLE TO OUTPACE GOOGLE.

449
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,261
WHAT BEIJING DID

450
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:37,346
WAS IT HACKED GOOGLE'S NETWORK,

451
00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:39,098
IT STOLE ITS SOURCE CODE,

452
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:43,978
AND NOW BAIDU HAS MORE THAN 75%
OF THE CHINA SEARCH MARKET.

453
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:48,691
THIS SHOWS THAT BASICALLY
BEIJING WANTS THE LOCAL
COMPANIES

454
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:50,568
TO BE THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS.

455
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:52,904
BUT SOMETIMES CHINESE PIRATES

456
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,822
AREN'T CONTENT JUST TO STEAL
THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

457
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:57,657
OF AN AMERICAN CORPORATION.

458
00:22:57,657 --> 00:23:00,619
SOMETIMES THEY JUST TAKE
THE WHOLE COMPANY.

459
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:03,915
SO FELLOWES IS A COMPANY
THAT MAKES SHREDDERS--
PAPER SHREDDERS--

460
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,415
AND THEY MOVED--
LIKE EVERYBODY--

461
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:07,001
THEY MOVED THEIR PRODUCTION
TO CHINA.

462
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:11,213
THEY HIRED A COMPANY TO RUN
THEIR PRODUCTION FOR THEM,

463
00:23:11,213 --> 00:23:12,714
AND SUDDENLY, ONE DAY,

464
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,716
THEIR EMPLOYEES WERE LOCKED OUT
OF THEIR OWN PLANT.

465
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:19,222
SO FELLOWES WENT FROM HAVING
A LARGE PRODUCTION BASE
IN CHINA ONE DAY

466
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:22,474
TO THE NEXT DAY, THEIR PARTNER
SUDDENLY SHUT THEM OFF,

467
00:23:22,474 --> 00:23:22,809
SHUT THEM DOWN.

468
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:26,395
THE MORAL
OF THE FELLOWES STORY IS,

469
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:29,445
YOU BETTER BE VERY CAREFUL
WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR PRODUCTION
TO A COMMUNIST COUNTRY.

470
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:37,781
IT MAKES NO SENSE THAT CHINA,

471
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:40,534
WHO PRODUCES 45%
OF THE STEEL IN THE WORLD,

472
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:43,538
HAS HIGH MANUFACTURING COSTS

473
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:47,290
YET SELLS STEEL
AT THE LOWEST COST IN THE WORLD

474
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,127
AND IS GROWING
AT A RATE OF 7 OR 8%.

475
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,839
THIS GROWTH
FROM A HUNDRED MILLION TONS

476
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,508
TO 700 MILLION TONS,

477
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,926
GROWING BY 50 MILLION TONS
PER YEAR,

478
00:23:57,926 --> 00:24:01,347
IS ALL DUE TO STATE SUBSIDIES.

479
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:03,723
THE PROBLEM
IS THAT AMERICAN COMPANIES

480
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:05,559
CANNOT COMPETE

481
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,728
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT COMPETING
WITH CHINESE COMPANIES.

482
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:10,731
THEY ARE COMPETING
WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.

483
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:12,774
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

484
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:16,695
IT MOST CERTAINLY WILL RESULT
IN MORE UNEMPLOYMENT
IN THE U.S.

485
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:18,865
AND TO THE ADVANTAGE OF CHINA.

486
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:21,409
WE'RE CHUMPS.

487
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:24,537
SO JUST HOW BIG OF A CHUMP

488
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:27,498
HAS AMERICA BEEN
FOR SUPPORTING CHINA'S ENTRY

489
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:31,042
INTO THE WORLD TRADE
ORGANIZATION IN 2001?

490
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,546
IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN THE
SUPER BOWL OF GLOBALIZATION,

491
00:24:33,546 --> 00:24:35,380
AND IN FACT
WE'RE BEING TAKEN APART.

492
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,467
AND IN THIS SUPER BOWL
OF GLOBALIZATION,

493
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:42,096
WHEN YOU TALLY UP THE SCORE
ON HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

494
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:44,056
AND CONSIDER
THE PLIGHT OF TIBET,

495
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:46,642
THE TORTURE OF THE FALUN GONG,

496
00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:49,186
AND THE CRUSHING OF RELIGION
AND DEMOCRACY,

497
00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:51,146
THIS MUCH IS CLEAR.

498
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:54,274
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
IS THE WORLD'S WORST HUMAN
RIGHTS ABUSER

499
00:24:54,274 --> 00:24:55,526
ON THE PLANET TODAY.

500
00:24:55,526 --> 00:24:57,736
AND WHEN YOU TALLY UP THE SCORE

501
00:24:57,736 --> 00:25:00,197
ON CHINA'S RAPID MILITARY
BUILDUP,

502
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:02,032
THIS, TOO, IS CLEAR...

503
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:04,618
[CHANG]
CHINA IS THE ONLY MAJOR NATION
IN THE WORLD

504
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:06,329
THAT IS PREPARING
TO KILL AMERICANS.

505
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:07,621
AND OF COURSE,

506
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:09,331
WHEN YOU COUNT THE JOBS LOST

507
00:25:09,331 --> 00:25:10,957
AND FACTORIES GONE

508
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:13,543
AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
OUT OF WORK--

509
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:15,713
AMERICAN MANUFACTURING
HAS BEEN IN AN ABSOLUTE CRISIS

510
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:16,963
OVER THE LAST DECADE.

511
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:20,050
51/2 MILLION
MANUFACTURING JOBS GONE.

512
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,553
57,000 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
CLOSED IN THIS NATION.

513
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:26,139
SO YOU'RE IN A MASSIVE
JOBLESS RECOVERY.

514
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:28,350
YOU'VE GOT 28 MILLION
WOMEN AND MEN

515
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,269
WHO ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES
OF UNEMPLOYMENT,

516
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:30,812
TWICE THE OFFICIAL NUMBER.

517
00:25:31,812 --> 00:25:33,856
WHEN YOU TALLY UP
ALL THESE SCORES,

518
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:36,067
IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR

519
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,444
THAT CHINA'S ENTRY
INTO THE WORLD TRADE
ORGANIZATION

520
00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:43,616
HAS BEEN BOTH A LOSING,
AND A VERY DANGEROUS,
PROPOSITION--

521
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:47,161
EVEN AS AMERICA HAS ALL
BUT COMPLETELY SURRENDERED

522
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:50,039
ITS MANUFACTURING BASE
TO CHINA.

523
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,665
WE DON'T MAKE A SINGLE CELL
PHONE IN THE UNITED STATES,

524
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,667
NOT ONE IS MADE
IN THE UNITED STATES.

525
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,212
[MAN]
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MODERN
FLAT PANEL DISPLAY FACTORY

526
00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:57,463
IN THE UNITED STATES.

527
00:25:57,463 --> 00:25:59,257
DOES THAT MATTER?

528
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:02,425
ARE FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS
IMPORTANT FOR MILITARY
APPLICATIONS?

529
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:04,302
I THINK SO.
THEY'RE WIDELY USED.

530
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:06,430
EVERY AIRPLANE,
EVERY HELICOPTER HAS THEM.

531
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,307
THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW

532
00:26:08,307 --> 00:26:11,726
IS UNABLE TO PUT A SINGLE
MILITARY AIRCRAFT INTO THE SKY

533
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:14,981
WITHOUT USING COMPONENTS
BUILT BY POTENTIAL ADVERSARIES.

534
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:17,942
WE PRODUCE ABOUT $3 BILLION
WORTH OF PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS

535
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:19,193
IN THE UNITED STATES.

536
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:21,736
CHINA PRODUCES
ALMOST $20 BILLION.

537
00:26:21,736 --> 00:26:26,617
MACHINE TOOLS,
WE PRODUCE $2.7 BILLION.

538
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:29,870
CHINA'S CONSUMPTION
WAS 10 TIMES THAT AMOUNT.

539
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,539
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A MACHINE TOOL INDUSTRY,

540
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,499
DO YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRY?

541
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:37,127
IT'S, YOU KNOW, A BASIC
COMPONENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL
ECONOMY.

542
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:39,963
BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE
GREEN INDUSTRIES

543
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:42,175
THAT SOME OF OUR POLITICIANS
SAY WILL CREATE

544
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:43,885
THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE?

545
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:44,802
[PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA]
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

546
00:26:45,802 --> 00:26:47,262
WHY WE'RE ACCELERATING
THE TRANSITION

547
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:49,014
TO A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY

548
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:51,767
AND DOUBLING OUR USE OF
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES

549
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,185
LIKE WIND AND SOLAR POWER,

550
00:26:53,185 --> 00:26:54,854
STEPS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL

551
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:56,521
TO CREATE WHOLE NEW INDUSTRIES

552
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:59,567
AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF NEW JOBS IN AMERICA.

553
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,694
BUT HERE'S THE GRIM REALITY.

554
00:27:01,694 --> 00:27:04,989
WE PRODUCE 4% OF THE WORLD'S
GLOBAL OUTPUT OF SOLAR.

555
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:07,532
ONE OF THE THINGS HAPPENING
IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW

556
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:10,077
IS IT'S BEING SWAMPED
BY LOW-COST MULTI-CRYSTALLINE

557
00:27:10,077 --> 00:27:13,498
AND POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICONE
SOLAR CELLS FROM CHINA.

558
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,167
WE DON'T MAKE COMPUTERS.

559
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,547
WE DON'T MAKE PRINTERS.

560
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:24,763
WE IMPORT 99% OF OUR SHOES.

561
00:27:29,763 --> 00:27:31,348
MASS-PRODUCED
CONSUMER PRODUCTS--

562
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:33,434
WE BASICALLY
DON'T MAKE THEM ANYMORE.

563
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:36,521
BUT IT'S NOT JUST MASS-PRODUCED
CONSUMER GOODS

564
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,271
WE ARE LOSING TO CHINA.

565
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:41,858
SOME OF OUR VERY BEST PAYING
MANUFACTURING JOBS

566
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:45,445
ARE ALSO NOW QUITE LITERALLY
BEING SHANGHAIED.

567
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:47,948
[MAN]
BOEING, AT ITS PEAK IN
THE SEATTLE-EVERETT AREA,

568
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:48,826
HAD ABOUT 50,000 EMPLOYEES.

569
00:27:49,826 --> 00:27:51,536
THAT WAS NO MORE THAN
FIVE YEARS AGO.

570
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,204
20,000 OF THOSE JOBS

571
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,748
HAVE NOW MOVED TO CHINA
IN JUST THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

572
00:27:55,748 --> 00:27:59,668
[McCORMACK]
APPLE EMPLOYS 26,000 PEOPLE

573
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:02,254
IN ITS DESIGN
OF MAKING NEW PRODUCTS.

574
00:28:02,254 --> 00:28:04,549
IT EMPLOYS, THROUGH FOXCONN,

575
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:08,426
700,000 MANUFACTURING WORKERS
IN CHINA.

576
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:09,805
THEY'RE AN AMERICAN COMPANY.
THEY'RE HEADQUARTERED HERE.

577
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:11,807
ALL THEIR JOBS
ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

578
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:14,015
AMERICANS NEED THOSE JOBS,

579
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:15,851
BUT THEY ALL EXIST IN CHINA.

580
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:18,646
EVERY ONE OF THOSE
MANUFACTURING JOBS
EXISTS IN CHINA.

581
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:21,607
THESE ARE JOBS THAT COULD VERY
EASILY BE IN SILICON VALLEY,

582
00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:23,984
IN OREGON, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA,

583
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:25,903
IN GENERAL ALONG THE COAST

584
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:29,365
FOR WHICH THERE ARE
WELL-TRAINED AND VERY
INTERESTED WOMEN AND MEN

585
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:30,616
WHO WOULD TAKE THEM
IN A HEARTBEAT.

586
00:28:30,616 --> 00:28:32,409
AND EVEN WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS

587
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:34,579
ARE NOW IN CHINA'S CROSS-HAIRS.

588
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,204
[MAN]
THE WHITE COLLAR WORKER
UNDERSTANDS

589
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:41,127
THAT CHINA IS NOW MOVING UP
IN THE FEEDING FRENZY TO,

590
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:44,046
FOR EXAMPLE, SOFTWARE
AND OTHER KINDS OF PRODUCTION.

591
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:46,924
THEY'RE MOVING AWAY
FROM JUST PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

592
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:49,635
UP TO MORE REALLY
INTELLECTUAL TECHNOLOGY.

593
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:51,636
NOW, IT'S NOT A VERY BIG PART
OF THEIR ECONOMY,

594
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:53,431
BUT YOU CAN LOOK
IN THE UNITED STATES.

595
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,973
IT'S HAVING
A DEVASTATING EFFECT.

596
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:57,976
IF THE JOBS FOR PRODUCTION
MOVE TO CHINA,

597
00:28:57,976 --> 00:29:00,646
THE SUPPORT JOBS
FOR WHITE COLLAR,

598
00:29:00,646 --> 00:29:02,440
TO A BIG DEGREE,
WILL MOVE TO CHINA.

599
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,694
MEANWHILE, OUR RAPIDLY
ACCUMULATING CHINESE DEBT

600
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:09,030
HAS BECOME A NATIONAL JOKE,
LITERALLY.

601
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,866
...AND TO ALLOW THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT TO DEFAULT.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

602
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:14,117
I'D SAY CHINA IS MAD
AT PRESIDENT OBAMA

603
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:15,411
FOR MEETING
WITH THE DALAI LAMA.

604
00:29:15,411 --> 00:29:15,828
I MEAN, COME ON.

605
00:29:16,828 --> 00:29:18,580
OBAMA DOESN'T
OWE THEM ANYTHING.

606
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,541
EXCEPT LIKE $14 TRILLION.

607
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:24,544
AND THAT DEBT REPRESENTS
A VERY REAL CLAIM

608
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:26,297
ON AMERICAN ASSETS.

609
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,759
...AND THEN CHINA WOULD BACK
A TOW TRUCK UP TO KANSAS

610
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,886
AND DRAG IT OFF
TO GUANGDONG PROVINCE.

611
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:35,514
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

612
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:38,099
I FIND IT IRONIC
THAT THE CORNER OF CAPITALISM,

613
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:40,019
THE J.P. MORGAN BUILDING
DOWN ON WALL STREET,

614
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:42,021
IS NOW OWNED
BY A CHINESE COMPANY.

615
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:43,522
AS FOR THAT HOPE

616
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:45,273
THAT ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT

617
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:48,485
WOULD LEAD TO A MORE FREE
AND DEMOCRATIC CHINA,

618
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:48,820
GEORGE BUSH, SENIOR.

619
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,321
REMEMBER HIM.

620
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:55,117
HE WAS THE AMBASSADOR
TO CHINA WAY BACK WHEN.

621
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:56,786
AND SO HE LIKED CHINA.

622
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:58,538
HE LIKED THOSE GUYS OVER THERE.

623
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:00,164
THINGS ARE GOOD IN CHINA.

624
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:01,874
ECONOMIC GROWTH IN CHINA

625
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:04,710
HAS NOT LED TO ITS
BECOMING MORE DEMOCRATIC.

626
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,712
IT HAS LED TO
A MORE SOPHISTICATED,

627
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:09,298
BETTER-FINANCED FORM
OF AUTHORITARIANISM.

628
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:13,344
AND IRONICALLY ONE OF THOSE
MEASURES OF REPRESSION

629
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,637
HAS BEEN THE INTERNET ITSELF,

630
00:30:15,637 --> 00:30:17,973
WHICH WAS SUPPOSED
TO SET CHINA FREE.

631
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:19,433
[McCORMACK]
CHINA IS LESS FREE TODAY

632
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,476
THAN IT WAS WHEN THEY
ENTERED THE WTO.

633
00:30:21,476 --> 00:30:24,355
CHINA HAS 50,000 INTERNET POLICE

634
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,607
WHO ARE TRACKING EVERY DAY
THEIR CAPABILITIES,

635
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,401
WHO'S SAYING WHAT,

636
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:31,236
TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND KEEP
THINGS LIKE TIANANMEN SQUARE,

637
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:32,696
DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM,
AND THOSE TERMS

638
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:34,197
OFF THE INTERNET.

639
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:35,950
AND THESE CYBER COPS

640
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,703
HAVE HAD PLENTY OF HELP
FROM AMERICAN COMPANIES

ESPECIALLY
FOR ITS SECRET POLICE,

645
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:51,089
HAS ENABLED THEM TO SEARCH,

THE WHEREABOUTS,

PARTICULARLY ONLINE

WHERE IF YOU SEND YOUR EMAILS
TO OTHER PEOPLE,

650
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:02,601
THEIR IP ADDRESSES QUICKLY
YIELD TO WHAT THEIR
PHYSICAL ADDRESSES ARE,

651

AND THEY'RE THEN
APPREHENDED AND ARRESTED.

652

PERHAPS THE MOST SHAMEFUL
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION

653
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,684
MAY BE FOUND IN YAHOO'S ROLE

654
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:47,521
IN THE JAILING OF A CHINESE
CITIZEN NAMED SHI TAO.

655
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:49,565
HERE'S A GUY, A JOURNALIST,

656
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:51,483

657
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:53,903
ABOUT WHAT THEY
COULDN'T SAY OR DO

658
00:31:53,903 --> 00:31:57,365
AS THE TIANANMEN SQUARE
REMEMBRANCE DAY WAS COMING UP

659
00:31:57,365 --> 00:32:00,367
OR DAYS AND HE SENT IT
TO A NEW YORK NGO.

660
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:03,287

ON THE DOOR OF THE YAHOO PEOPLE,

661
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:04,789
ASKED FOR THE INFORMATION,

662
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,290
THEY JUST COUGHED IT RIGHT UP,

663
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,585
AND SHI TAO GOT TEN YEARS
FOR THAT.

664
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:12,547
AS FOR THOSE FALUN GONG
PRACTITIONERS

665
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:15,758
AND OTHER DISSIDENTS SINGLED
OUT BY PRESIDENT CLINTON...

666
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:17,717
I HAD A HEARING
ON THE FALUN GONG,

667
00:32:17,717 --> 00:32:20,680
AND HOW THEY'RE THROWING
THESE PEOPLE IN JAIL
BY THE THOUSANDS,

668
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,848
AND THEY'RE HARVESTING ORGANS.

669
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:25,934
THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT IF
SOMEBODY GOES-- WANTS A LIVER,
SAY,

670
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:28,436
THEY FLY TO SHANGHAI,

671
00:32:28,436 --> 00:32:31,523
AND THEY PROBABLY GO CHECK
INTO THE NUMBER ONE PEOPLE'S
HOSPITAL IN SHANGHAI.

A MILITARY SURGEON,
PROBABLY IN UNIFORM,
ONE I'M THINKING OF,

673
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:36,821
COMES UP AND DOES
THE [UNINTELLIGIBLE] TESTS

674
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:40,073
AND THE BLOOD TEST AND SO ON.

675
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:41,867
THEN HE-- HE OR SHE--

676
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,452
LOOKS ON THE COMPUTER LIST
AND SAYS,

677
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:46,246
"OH, THERE'S A MATCH OUT
IN WORK CAMP 400."

678

THE POOR VICTIM,

679
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,376
WHO MATCHES
WHAT YOUR ORGANS NEED,

680
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:52,211
IS DRAGGED
INTO A SORT OF HOSPITAL,

681
00:32:52,211 --> 00:32:54,172
GIVEN A LIGHT ANESTHETIC
IN MOST CASES,

682
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,630
AND NEVER WAKES UP

683
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,800
BECAUSE THEY TAKE
NOT JUST ONE KIDNEY.

684
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,969
THEY TAKE BOTH KIDNEYS,
THE LIVER, HEART, EVERYTHING,

685
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:01,636
AND THEIR BODY IS THEN BURNED,

686
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:03,513
AND THE PEOPLE'S
LIBERATION ARMY

687
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,015
FLIES THE ORGAN TO SHANGHAI

688
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:07,601
FROM WHEREVER
THE CAMP HAPPENS TO BE,

689
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:09,353
AND YOU'RE TOLD
YOU'RE GETTING THE ORGAN

690
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:11,021
FROM A CONVICTED
MURDERER OR SOMETHING.

691
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:13,899
I MEAN, THIS IS
A GROTESQUE TALE

692
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:17,278
OF THE WORST KIND
OF OPPRESSION AND GHOULISHNESS

693
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,323
ON THE PART OF RULERS
OF A COUNTRY.

694
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:24,493
AND HERE IS WHAT
TOO MANY AMERICAN POLITICIANS

695
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:28,121
SEEM TO HAVE SUCH
A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING.

696
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:32,210
WEI JINGSHENG TOLD ME,
IN BEIJING RIGHT BEFORE
HE GOT RE-ARRESTED,

697
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,462
"YOU AMERICANS
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

698
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:36,630
"WHEN YOU CODDLE DICTATORSHIP,

699
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:40,300
"WHEN YOU KOWTOW
AND YOU CARRY THE DICTATORSHIP
AROUND ON A PILLOW,

700
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,136
"THEY BEAT US MORE
IN THE LAOGAI.

701
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:45,306
"WHEN YOU'RE TOUGH,
PREDICTABLE,

702
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:47,974
TRANSPARENT ON HUMAN RIGHTS,
THEY BEAT US LESS."

703
00:33:47,974 --> 00:33:52,021
BUT AT LEAST ENGAGING
CHINA ECONOMICALLY

704
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:56,399
HAS MADE THE RULING COMMUNIST
PARTY MORE PEACEFUL, RIGHT?

705
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,946
CHINA'S MILITARY POWER
IS STRENGTHENING
VERY, VERY RAPIDLY.

706
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:03,741
THEY ARE BUILDING UP THEIR
MILITARY CAPABILITIES

707
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,953
IN HARD WEAPONS
AS WELL AS IN CYBER SECURITY.

708
00:34:06,953 --> 00:34:11,999
CHINA HAS A POPULATION
WHICH IS ABOUT FIVE TIMES
THE SIZE OF THE UNITED STATES,

709
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:16,212
AND THAT MEANS THAT
IF THEY HAVE A COMPARABLE
LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT,

710
00:34:16,212 --> 00:34:19,507
THEY PROBABLY WILL END UP
WITH A MILITARY
FIVE TIMES LARGER.

711
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:22,844
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND
OF TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE WE HAVE.

712
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:25,011
IT WOULD BE
VERY DIFFICULT TO PREVAIL

713
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:27,932
OVER AN ADVERSARY
THAT IS FIVE TIMES LARGER.

714
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,642
[REP. ROHRABACHER]
WHAT CHINA IS BUILDING

715
00:34:29,642 --> 00:34:31,269
IS JUST NOT A MASSIVE FLEET

716
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,854
OR A MASSIVE GROUND ARMY,

717
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:37,607
BUT IT'S DEVELOPING A MODERN,
WELL-EQUIPPED,

718
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:40,528
TECHNOLOGICALLY
CAPABLE MILITARY.

719
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:42,571
AND IN SOME CASES,

720
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:45,115
IT NEED NOT BE CHINA
PULLING THE TRIGGER...

721
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:48,747
[MAN SPEAKING FARSI]
...MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD!

722
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:54,506
...OR LAUNCHING THE MISSILES,
AS THE CASE MAY BE.

723
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:02,801
[RICHARD FISHER]
WE ARE ON THE ONSET
OF AN AGE OF NUCLEAR TERRORISM.

724
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,136
WE SEE PAKISTAN CRUMBLING

725
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:08,180
WHILE IT BUILDS MORE AND MORE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

726
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,807
WHY DOES PAKISTAN
HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS?

727
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:12,602
WHY DOES IT HAVE THE MISSILES
TO DELIVER THEM?

728
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:14,854
BECAUSE OF CHINA.

729
00:35:14,854 --> 00:35:16,689
WE'VE BEEN IN A NEAR
30-YEAR DIALOGUE

730
00:35:16,689 --> 00:35:18,024
WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

731
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:19,941
TRYING TO ARREST THIS BEHAVIOR

732
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:23,321
THAT IS SUPPORTING NOT
ONLY PAKISTAN'S,

733
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,698
BUT NORTH KOREA'S AND IRAN'S
FUTURE NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES.

734
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:31,245
CHINA REFUSES
TO LISTEN AND RESPOND.

735
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:36,042
WHEN A NUCLEAR BOMB
GOES OFF ON SOME HIGHWAY

736
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:38,961
EITHER INSIDE
OR OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY,

737
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:42,881
CHANCES ARE A LOT OF THOSE
COMPONENTS ON THAT BOMB

738
00:35:42,881 --> 00:35:43,861
ARE GOING TO SAY
MADE IN CHINA.

739
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:08,950
I HAD MY CHILDREN'S THOMAS
THE TRAIN SETS RECALLED

740
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,912
BECAUSE OF THE INK ON
THE RED ONES WAS LEAD POISONED.

741
00:36:13,912 --> 00:36:16,999
THEY'RE NOT ONLY RUINING
OUR ECONOMY.

742
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:20,002
THEY'RE POISONING
OUR CHILDREN WITH THE TOYS
THAT WE GIVE THEM.

743
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:22,421
I WANT TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT WHAT PRODUCTS I BUY

744
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:25,091
BECAUSE I WANNA KNOW THAT
THEY'RE SAFE AND THEY'RE GOOD.

745
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:27,843
I WANT TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT WHAT PRODUCTS I BUY

746
00:36:27,843 --> 00:36:29,805
BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRODUCING
THOSE

747
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:32,640
ARE BEING TREATED PROPERLY.

748
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,225
AND I WANT TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT THE PRODUCTS I BUY

749
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,894
BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE

750
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,729
THAT THE PEOPLE
IN MY COMMUNITY

751
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,982
ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE
TO HAVE JOBS AT A DECENT WAGE.

752
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:45,736
AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS
ARE TIED TOGETHER.

753
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,615
[PETER NAVARRO]
EVERY TIME A CONSUMER
WALKS INTO A WAL-MART,

754
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:51,158
THE FIRST THING
THEY HAVE TO DO

755
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:54,662
IS TO BE AWARE ENOUGH
TO LOOK FOR THE LABEL.

756
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:57,289
THEN, WHEN THEY PICK UP
THAT GOOD AND IT SAYS
"MADE IN CHINA,"

757
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,417
I WANT THEM TO THINK,

758
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:03,004
HMPH. IT MIGHT EITHER
BREAK DOWN OR IT COULD
KILL ME, NUMBER ONE.

759
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:05,089
THIS THING, IF I BUY IT,

760
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:10,428
MIGHT COST ME OR SOMEONE
IN MY FAMILY OR MY FRIENDS
THEIR JOB.

761
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,680
LASTLY, HEY, IF I BUY THIS,

762
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,350
THAT MONEY IS GOING TO GO OVER
TO HELP FINANCE

763
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,479
WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE MOST
RAPID MILITARY BUILDUP

764
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,772
OF A TOTALITARIAN REGIME
SINCE WHEN?

765
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,274
THE '30s.

766
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:26,611
I MEAN, MAKE NO MISTAKE
ABOUT THAT.

767
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,323
91% OF EVERY PRODUCT
IN A WAL-MART STORE

768
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:32,033
IS MANUFACTURED IN CHINA.

769
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:37,412
WAL-MART SPENT $50 BILLION
IN CHINA TWO YEARS AGO.

770
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:39,207
IF WAL-MART WERE A COUNTRY,

771
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:41,374
THEY WOULD BE CHINA'S FOURTH
LARGEST TRADING PARTNER.

772
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:44,127
WHEN AN AMERICAN GOES
INTO A WAL-MART

773
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:46,421
AND BUYS A PRODUCT
MADE IN CHINA,

774
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:49,175
THAT PERSON
IS THINKING JUST PRICE.

775
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:51,010
IF YOU'RE A PERSON ON A PENSION

776
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,470
SHOPPING AT WAL-MART,

777
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,013
YOU KINDA LIKE
THE GREAT WALL OF MART.

778
00:37:55,013 --> 00:37:56,973
BUT WHAT THEY REALLY NEED
TO THINK ABOUT

779
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:58,935
IS HOW THAT PRODUCT GOT THERE.

780
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:02,187
IT GOT THERE BECAUSE
YOU HAVE A PREDATORY SYSTEM

781
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:06,191
WHICH IS REALLY TRYING TO
UNDERCUT AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS

782
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:07,859
AND THEREFORE AMERICAN WORKERS.

783
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,780
[INTERVIEWER]
AND WHEN CONSUMER
GOES INTO WAL-MART

784
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,573
AND PICKS UP
A GOOD MADE IN CHINA,

785
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:15,700
WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM
TO THINK ABOUT

786
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,537
BEFORE THEY GET
TO THE CASH REGISTER?

787
00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:19,997
THINK ABOUT YOUR RELATIVE
THAT JUST GOT LAID OFF

788
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,874
OR THE FACTORY
THAT JUST GOT SHUT DOWN.

789
00:38:21,874 --> 00:38:24,417
THINK ABOUT THE SCHOOL

790
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,127
THAT IS DOING WITH LESS

791
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:28,004
BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURING BASE

792
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:29,800
HAS GONE
AND THE TAX BASE HAS LEFT.

793
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,760
THINK ABOUT THE LOWER INCOME
THAT YOU'RE RECEIVING NOW

794
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,930
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MAKING
PRODUCTS,

795
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,848
AND WE'RE NOT BUYING
OUR OWN PRODUCTS.

796
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:43,729
WHEN AMERICANS BUY A PRODUCT
FROM WAL-MART,

797
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:49,234
I WANT THEM TO REMEMBER
THE CHILDREN, THE FAMILY,

798
00:38:49,234 --> 00:38:53,238
THE WORKERS WHO HAS EARNED
VERY, VERY LITTLE

799
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:54,656
FROM THOSE PRODUCTS.

800
00:38:54,656 --> 00:38:56,575
THIS IS NOT JUST
AN ECONOMIC MATTER.

801
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:58,452
THIS IS A SECURITY MATTER

802
00:38:58,452 --> 00:39:00,997
BECAUSE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
HAS MADE IT CLEAR

803
00:39:00,997 --> 00:39:03,624
THAT IT WANTS TO UNDERMINE
AMERICA'S ROLE IN THE WORLD.

804
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:05,877
SO, YEAH,
THINGS ARE CHEAP AT WAL-MART,

805
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,796
BUT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THE CONSEQUENCES.

806
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:10,798
BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO CONSIDER

807
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,258
THE BROADER ECONOMIC

808
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:14,301
OR NATIONAL SECURITY
CONSEQUENCES

809
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,970
OF CONSUMING GOODS
MADE IN CHINA,

810
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,015
YOU MAY AT LEAST WANT TO THINK
ABOUT YOUR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY

811
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:22,059
AND THAT OF YOUR FAMILY.

812
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,269
[MORICI]
IF YOU PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH
OR THE HANDS OF A CHILD,

813
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:25,437
DON'T BUY IT FROM CHINA.

814
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:27,397
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS,

815
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:29,941
WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF SCANDALS
INVOLVING CHINESE PRODUCTS.

816
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:33,778
AND THESE PRODUCTS HAVE KILLED
PEOPLE NOT ONLY IN CHINA,

817
00:39:33,778 --> 00:39:35,406
BUT ALSO IN THE UNITED STATES.

818
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,825
DO YOU WANT TO BUY PIPE
FOR YOUR RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY

819
00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:42,120
THAT'S GOING TO PUT ALL
THE WATER INTO EVERYBODY'S
HOUSES

820
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,332
THAT IS TAINTED
WITH ARSENIC AND MERCURY

821
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:47,709
SO THAT IT'LL LEACH OUT
INTO YOUR WATER

822
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:49,544
SO THAT WHEN YOU TURN
ON YOUR SPIGOT IN YOUR HOUSE,

823
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:51,964
YOU'RE SUDDENLY, YOU KNOW,
CONTAMINATING YOURSELF

824
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:53,633
BECAUSE THAT PIPE WAS MADE
CHEAPER IN CHINA?

825
00:39:53,633 --> 00:39:55,718
GOODYEAR TIRE
OUTSIDE OF MONTREAL,

826
00:39:55,718 --> 00:39:57,385
IT CLOSED ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO

827
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:58,805
AND PUT 850 PEOPLE OUT OF WORK,

828
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:01,973
MOVED THE PRODUCTION TO CHINA

829
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:06,062
BECAUSE THEY COULD MAKE TIRES,
I THINK, IT WAS
FOR $4 A TIRE CHEAPER

830
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:10,149
AND NOT LONG AFTER
THEY STARTED UP IN CHINA,

831
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:12,318
THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY
IN THE U.S.

832
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,111
SAID THE TIRES BEING
PRODUCED THERE WERE UNSAFE.

833
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:18,031
I MEAN, IS THIS WHAT CORPORATE
AMERICA OR CORPORATE CANADA

834
00:40:18,031 --> 00:40:20,283
THINKS IS THE WAY THEY SHOULD
BE CONDUCTING THEMSELVES?

835
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:21,618
I DON'T THINK SO.

836
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:24,330
WE'RE IMPORTING
A LOT OF THEIR APPLES.

837
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,832
THEY SPRAY THEM WITH ALAR,
YOU KNOW.

838
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:28,334
THAT'S ILLEGAL
IN THE UNITED STATES.

839
00:40:28,334 --> 00:40:29,417
YOU WANT DDT ON YOUR APPLE?

840
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:30,919
BUY IT FROM CHINA,

841
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,379
AND WE'RE BUYING
A LOT OF APPLES FROM CHINA.

842
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:33,964
WE'RE BUYING EVERYTHING
FROM CHINA,

843
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,263
AND THEY'RE NO ENVIRONMENTAL
CONTROLS.

844
00:40:41,263 --> 00:40:43,265
[WOMAN]
THERE IS A RISK OF SUFFOCATION,

845
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:45,600
THAT KIDS CAN GET TRAPPED
AND DIE.

846
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,437
[WOMAN #2]
THEY TOOK HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
WHERE THEY PRONOUNCED HIM DEAD.

847
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:52,316
[WOMAN #3]
...MASSIVE RECALL OF A MILLION
OF MATTEL'S FISHER-PRICE TOYS.

848
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,109
A RECENT BATCH MADE IN CHINA

849
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:56,361
CONTAINS TOXIC LEVELS
OF LEAD PAINT.

850
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:58,446
[MAN]
THE EYES OF THOSE TEDDY BEARS
CAN LOOSEN AND FALL OUT,

851
00:40:58,446 --> 00:40:59,948
IMPOSING A CHOKING HAZARD
TO YOUNG CHILDREN.

852
00:40:59,948 --> 00:41:01,700
[MAN #2]
ACCORDING TO THE STATE MEDIA,

853
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,037
DOZENS OF BABIES HAVE DEVELOPED
KIDNEY STONES IN RECENT DAYS.

854
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:05,830
[MAN]
THOUSANDS OF PETS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

855
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,374
DIED AFTER EATING
TAINTED PET FOOD.

856
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:12,669
THAT LED TO
A MASSIVE PET FOOD RECALL.

857
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:13,839
[MAN #3]
MY WIFE BONNIE DIED
IN DECEMBER

858
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,260
AFTER RECEIVING HEPARIN
THAT WAS LATER RECALLED BY
BAXTER.

859
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,845
MY SON RANDY
DIED A MONTH LATER

860
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:23,722
UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES.

861
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:25,475
[WOMAN #4]
SOME BRANDS HAVE BEEN FOUND

862
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:29,269
TO CONTAIN A TOXIC CHEMICAL
USED IN ANTIFREEZE.

863
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:31,522
[MAN #4]
PORK FROM PIGS
FORCE-FED WASTEWATER.

864
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:31,814
[MAN #5]
IF IT COMES FROM CHINA,

865
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:35,066
AND THE PRICE
IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,

866
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:37,321
THEN IT PROBABLY IS.

867
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:40,031
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT

868
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,698
FOR ANY COUNTRY

869
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:46,454
TO PROTECT THEIR CITIZENS
FROM CHINESE PRODUCTS.

870
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:48,039
THE REAL PROBLEM HERE

871
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,957
IS THAT YOU HAVE A POLITICAL
SYSTEM

872
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:54,127
THAT DOES NOT PUNISH
MANUFACTURERS
FOR BAD PRODUCTS.

873
00:41:54,127 --> 00:41:57,006
AND IT'S BECAUSE
IT'S THE NATURE
OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM.

874
00:41:57,006 --> 00:42:00,176
THE COMMUNIST PARTY DOES NOT
ALLOW INDEPENDENT PROSECUTORS,

875
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:02,010
DOESN'T ALLOW A FREE PRESS,

876
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,513
DOESN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO
COMPLAIN ABOUT BAD PRODUCTS.

877
00:42:04,513 --> 00:42:06,015
LET'S TAKE FISH.

878
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:10,769
THERE ARE 3.5 MILLION
FISH FARMS IN CHINA.

879
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:13,689
THE FISH ARE RAISED
IN CONTAMINATED PONDS.

880
00:42:13,689 --> 00:42:14,816
THEY ARE FED
ALL KINDS OF HORMONES,

881
00:42:15,816 --> 00:42:18,568
AND THE BIGGEST MARKET
FOR THAT FISH

882
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:20,071
IS THE UNITED STATES.

883
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:23,198
85% OF THE TILAPIA
COMES FROM CHINA.

884
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:25,493
MOST OF OUR SHRIMP
COMES FROM CHINA.

885
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:28,955
U.S. FDA ONLY HAS THE ABILITY

886
00:42:28,955 --> 00:42:32,792
TO INSPECT ONE PERCENT
OF THE FISH COMING
INTO THE UNITED STATES.

887
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:36,419
65% PERCENT
OF THE ONE PERCENT THEY REJECT.

888
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:39,464
THEY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY
TO CONFISCATE THE FISH,

889
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:42,676
SO IF THE SHIP COMES
INTO CHARLESTON
AND GETS REJECTED,

890
00:42:42,676 --> 00:42:44,428
THEN IT GOES TO MIAMI
OR NEW ORLEANS

891
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,720
OR SOME OTHER PORT

892
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,055
AND EVENTUALLY
THE FISH GETS IN.

893
00:42:47,055 --> 00:42:49,767
AND BECAUSE OF SUCH DANGERS,

894
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,477
AMERICANS ARE BECOMING
MORE AND MORE AWARE

895
00:42:52,477 --> 00:42:54,564
OF THE MADE-IN-CHINA LABEL

896
00:42:54,564 --> 00:42:57,441
BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS
GUARANTEE ONE'S SAFETY,

897
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,484
OR CONVENIENCE.

898
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:03,531
I PERSONALLY DO LOOK
AT THE LABELS OF
WHERE THINGS ARE MADE,

899
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,073
BUT SOMETIMES
I GO TO BUY THINGS,

900
00:43:05,073 --> 00:43:06,700
AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIND SOMETHING

901
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,577
THAT ISN'T MADE IN CHINA.

902
00:43:08,577 --> 00:43:11,914
WELL, MY WIFE'S A GOOD
CARD-CARRYING LIBERAL.

903
00:43:11,914 --> 00:43:13,915
SHE BELIEVES IN ALL
THE WORTHY CAUSES IN THE WORLD

904
00:43:13,915 --> 00:43:15,459
AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING,

905
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,169
AND SHE'S AN INTELLIGENT
WOMAN I WANT TO SAY

906
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:18,421
FOR THE RECORD.

907
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:20,381
LITTLE BY LITTLE I REALIZED

908
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:21,800
THAT CHINA WAS GETTING
TO WHERE IT WAS

909
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,010
AND THE UNITED STATES
WAS GETTING TO WHERE IT WAS

910
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,680
BECAUSE THERE WAS ALL THIS
CURRENCY MANIPULATION,

911
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,890
AND IT JUST SEEMED LIKE
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

912
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:31,684
WAS NOT DOING A WHOLE LOT

913
00:43:31,684 --> 00:43:33,727
IN THE NAME
OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE

914
00:43:33,727 --> 00:43:36,439
TO TRY TO STOP
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN CHINA,

915
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:38,231
WHICH WAS ABLE
TO LURE A LOT OF JOBS.

916
00:43:38,231 --> 00:43:39,524
SOME MONTHS AGO,

917
00:43:39,524 --> 00:43:41,986
SHE DECIDED TO THE BEST
OF HER ABILITY,

918
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,778
SHE WASN'T GOING TO BUY
ANYTHING MADE IN CHINA.

919
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:46,156
SO OUR MICROWAVE OVEN FAILED.

920
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,867
WE DON'T HAVE
A NEW MICROWAVE OVEN

921
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:50,368
BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT FIND ONE
THAT WAS NOT MADE IN CHINA.

922
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:53,372
WHEN I WENT TO LOOK
FOR A MICROWAVE
OR FREE-STANDING MICROWAVE,

923
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:55,124
THERE WAS NOTHING
THAT WASN'T MADE IN CHINA.

924
00:43:55,124 --> 00:43:56,751
I WENT TO FIVE DIFFERENT STORES

925
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:59,838
FROM HIGH-END HARDWARE STORES
TO LOW-END DISCOUNT PLACES.

926
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,256
NOTHING WAS AVAILABLE
THAT WASN'T MADE IN CHINA,

927
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:05,301
AND MY EXPERIENCE
WITH THINGS MADE IN CHINA

928
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:07,636
WAS THAT THEY WEREN'T HEALTHY,

929
00:44:07,636 --> 00:44:10,138
YOU NEVER KNEW
WHAT WAS IN THEM,

930
00:44:10,138 --> 00:44:12,934
THEY DIDN'T WORK FOR VERY LONG,

931
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:15,937
AND THEY BROKE DOWN
IF THEY WORKED
IN THE BEGINNING.

932
00:44:15,937 --> 00:44:18,231
SO I THEN DECIDED

933
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:21,901
I JUST WASN'T GOING TO BUY
ANYTHING THAT WAS MADE
IN CHINA.

934
00:44:21,901 --> 00:44:27,698
SO WE JUST DO NOT HAVE
A MICROWAVE ANYMORE.

935
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,367
RIGHT AROUND THE SAME TIME,

936
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:34,664
WE HAD AN UNDER-A-COUNTER
ELECTRIC UNIT FOR HEATING

937
00:44:34,664 --> 00:44:36,207
IN ONE OF THE ROOMS

938
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:37,874
AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED.

939
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:39,544
YOU COULDN'T GET
ANY ELECTRIC BASEBOARD

940
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:41,044
THAT WASN'T MADE IN CHINA.

941
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:43,714
AND I THOUGHT WELL MY LAST ONE
WAS MADE IN AMERICA.

942
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,341
I HAD IT FOR 23 YEARS.
IT WORKED GREAT.

943
00:44:46,341 --> 00:44:47,926
NOW I COULDN'T FIND IT.

944
00:44:47,926 --> 00:44:49,970
AND I JUST GOT
COMPLETELY DISCOURAGED

945
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,265
THAT NO AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS

946
00:44:52,265 --> 00:44:55,600
WERE COMING IN TO PRODUCE
QUALITY PRODUCTS OVER HERE.

947
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,937
AND THAT'S THE DILEMMA
WE NOW FIND OURSELVES IN.

948
00:44:58,937 --> 00:45:02,316
AS CHINA HAS USED ITS WEAPONS
OF JOB DESTRUCTION

949
00:45:02,316 --> 00:45:04,526
TO SO THOROUGHLY CAPTURE
OUR MARKETS,

950
00:45:04,526 --> 00:45:08,113
WE ARE LEFT WITH FEW
CHOICES OTHER THAN
TO BUY FROM CHINA.

951
00:45:08,113 --> 00:45:10,950
BUT THE MORE WE BUY FROM CHINA,

952
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,160
THE MORE RISKS
OUR FAMILIES FACE

953
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,289
FROM DANGEROUS
CHINESE PRODUCTS.

954
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:19,749
AND THE MORE JOBS WE LOSE.

955
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:21,711
AND BECAUSE THIS IS TRUE,

956
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:25,673
WE NOW MUST ALSO CONFRONT
THIS MUCH BIGGER TRUTH.

957
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:27,425
[MAN]
WE IMPORT A LOT OF STUFF
FROM CHINA,

958
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:29,385
BUT A LOT OF IT
WE DON'T PAY FOR.

959
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:32,345
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT NO GOODS TO
SHIP IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION,

960
00:45:32,345 --> 00:45:34,182
SO WE JUST SHIP
BUNDLES OF DOLLAR BILLS,

961
00:45:34,182 --> 00:45:35,809
BETWEEN TWO AND THREE TRILLION
DOLLARS IS AVAILABLE

962
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:38,560
TO BUY UP PIECES OF AMERICA.

963
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,562
IN OTHER WORDS,
WE'RE LIVING BEYOND OUR MEANS.

964
00:45:40,562 --> 00:45:44,859
WE HAVE AN ARTIFICIALLY HIGH
STANDARD OF LIVING.

965
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:47,653
WE'RE CONSUMING
MORE THAN WE CREATE.

966
00:45:47,653 --> 00:45:50,448
THAT'S
A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION,

967
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,742
AND ESPECIALLY IF
YOUR PRINCIPLE CREDITOR

968
00:45:52,742 --> 00:45:54,747
IS A NATION LIKE CHINA.

969
00:45:57,747 --> 00:46:01,209
SO JUST EXACTLY HOW
DID WE IN AMERICA

970
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:05,338
ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE BACKED
INTO SUCH A DANGEROUS
CHINESE CORNER?

971
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:07,214
WHEN YOU LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY,

972
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:10,426
IT'S ALWAYS SUBJECTED
TO BEING HIJACKED,

973
00:46:10,426 --> 00:46:13,136
AND OUR DEMOCRACY
HAS BEEN HIJACKED

974
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:15,180
BY THE MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATIONS.

975
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,142
THE CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
IS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS,

976
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,852
AND IT OFTEN HAS A LEGAL
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY

977
00:46:20,852 --> 00:46:21,979
TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS.

978
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,522
THE GOVERNMENT
HAS A RESPONSIBILITY

979
00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:25,399
TO THE PEOPLE
AND THE NATIONAL INTEREST.

980
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:27,276
THOSE ARE NOT NECESSARILY
THE SAME.

981
00:46:27,276 --> 00:46:29,361
U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS

982
00:46:29,361 --> 00:46:31,446
KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

983
00:46:31,446 --> 00:46:32,948
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
ANY PLANS

984
00:46:32,948 --> 00:46:34,700
TO INCREASE EXPORTS
TO CHINA

985
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,327
AFTER CHINA JOINED THE WTO.

986
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:38,412
THEY HAD PLANS TO MOVE
PRODUCTION TO CHINA,

987
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:42,792
BUT THEY WERE, I'D SAY,
DISHONEST OR DISINGENUOUS

988
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:46,504
BECAUSE THE WHOLE RHETORIC
AROUND CHINA JOINING THE WTO

989
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:48,841
WAS ABOUT FREE TRADE
AND OPENING MARKETS
AND ENGAGING WITH CHINA.

990
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,508
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
OUR COMPANIES

991
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:54,095
WILL BE ABLE TO SELL AND
DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS IN CHINA

992
00:46:54,095 --> 00:46:56,388
MADE BY WORKERS
HERE IN AMERICA.

993
00:46:56,388 --> 00:46:59,392
WHEN IN FACT IT WAS REALLY
SELF-INTEREST AND PROFIT MOTIVE

994
00:46:59,392 --> 00:47:00,767
ON THE PART OF U.S.
MULTINATIONALS

995
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:02,644
THAT DROVE THAT DEBATE.

996
00:47:02,644 --> 00:47:06,439
AND U.S. CHINA COMMISSIONER
AND BUSINESSMAN DAN SLANE

997
00:47:06,439 --> 00:47:08,441
KNOWS FIRSTHAND

998
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:11,736
JUST HOW THIS OFFSHORING
SHELL GAME IS WORKING,

999
00:47:11,736 --> 00:47:15,740
SINCE CHINA JOINED THE WORLD
TRADE ORGANIZATION IN 2001

1000
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,952
AND BEGAN FLOODING
AMERICAN MARKETS

1001
00:47:17,952 --> 00:47:22,914
WITH ILLEGALLY
SUBSIDIZED EXPORTS.

1002
00:47:22,914 --> 00:47:27,544
I HAD A PLYWOOD MANUFACTURING
FACILITY IN BOWLING GREEN,
KENTUCKY,

1003
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:31,716
SELLING PLYWOOD
TO FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS
IN THE UNITED STATES.

1004
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:34,968
IN 2002, ALL OF MY COMPETITORS
WERE MOVING TO CHINA.

1005
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:36,845
ESSENTIALLY,
I HAD TWO CHOICES--

1006
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:39,473
I SHUT THE COMPANY DOWN,
OR I MOVED IT TO CHINA.

1007
00:47:39,473 --> 00:47:41,850
AND I OPENED UP
THREE FACTORIES IN CHINA

1008
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:45,937
AND DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER
IN THE UNITED STATES
50% CHEAPER

1009
00:47:45,937 --> 00:47:47,856
THAN I COULD MAKE IT
IN BOWLING GREEN.

1010
00:47:47,856 --> 00:47:51,234
AND SLANE'S NEW FOUND
COMPETITIVE EDGE

1011
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:55,740
WAS ALL DUE TO CHINA'S
ILLEGAL WEAPONS
OF JOB DESTRUCTION.

1012
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,200
MANIPULATING THE CURRENCY

1013
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,658
WAS A HUGE HELP FOR ME,

1014
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:00,660
BECAUSE IT KEPT
OUR PRICES DOWN.

1015
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,580
I HAD NO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES;

1016
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,414
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

1017
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,792
WAS THAT I COULD SELL
MY PRODUCT AT COST

1018
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:09,961
AND EVERY MONTH THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT

1019
00:48:09,961 --> 00:48:13,925
WOULD SEND ME A CHECK
FOR 17% OF MY EXPORTS,

1020
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:17,428
AND THAT WAS MY NET MARGIN
AND MY PROFIT.

1021
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:20,472
SO WAS SLANE WRONG TO OFFSHORE
HIS FACTORIES TO CHINA?

1022
00:48:20,472 --> 00:48:23,225
THIS INTERCHANGE

1023
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:27,647
WITH U.S. CHINA COMMISSIONER
AND MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION
LOBBYIST WILLIAM REINSCH

1024
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,189
OFFERS SOME PERSPECTIVE:

1025
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:30,982
IT'S NOT GENERALLY REGARDED

1026
00:48:30,982 --> 00:48:36,446
AS THE JOB OF A LARGE AMERICAN
COMPANY TO SUBSTITUTE ITSELF

1027
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,115
FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

1028
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,200
WHAT MOST OF THE COMPANIES
WANT TO DO

1029
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,287
IS TO--
THEY WANT TO BE CONSISTENT
WITH GOVERNMENT--

1030
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:46,374
WITH U.S. LAW
AND U.S. PRACTICE.

1031
00:48:46,374 --> 00:48:49,126
IF THE GOVERNMENT TELLS THEM
THAT THEY WOULD LIKE THEM
TO DO SOMETHING,

1032
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,211
THEY GENERALLY DO IT.

1033
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:53,548
[INTERVIEWER]
SO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY
RESPONSIBILITY PER SE

1034
00:48:53,548 --> 00:48:55,258
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

1035
00:48:55,258 --> 00:48:57,926
OTHER THAN OBEYING THE EXISTING
LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

1036
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:00,011
IS THAT FAIR?

1037
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:03,765
WELL, WHAT RESPONSIBILITY
WOULD YOU LIKE THEM TO HAVE
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

1038
00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:06,017
OTHER THAN TRYING TO BE
GOOD CORPORATE CITIZENS

1039
00:49:06,017 --> 00:49:06,812
AND TO BE PROFITABLE?

1040
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:09,981
WOULD YOU DEFINE
A GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN

1041
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:14,401
AS A COMPANY THAT MOVES
ITS FACTORIES OVER TO CHINA

1042
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:17,863
AND CREATES MASSIVE
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE MIDWEST?

1043
00:49:17,863 --> 00:49:21,742
IS THAT GOOD CORPORATE
CITIZENRY?

1044
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:23,870
WELL, I THINK THAT
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK--

1045
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,455
YOU'D HAVE TO LOOK AT--
YOU'D HAVE TO GO CASE BY CASE.

1046
00:49:26,455 --> 00:49:28,957
AND IN DAN SLANE'S CASE?

1047
00:49:28,957 --> 00:49:31,252
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MYSELF
AND GENERAL ELECTRIC

1048
00:49:31,252 --> 00:49:32,919
IS THAT I HAD NO CHOICE.

1049
00:49:32,919 --> 00:49:35,589
I EITHER MOVE TO CHINA,
OR I SHUT THE COMPANY DOWN.

1050
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:36,883
I COULDN'T COMPETE.

1051
00:49:36,883 --> 00:49:38,758
JEFF IMMELT
AT GENERAL ELECTRIC

1052
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:39,926
DOES HAVE A CHOICE.

1053
00:49:39,926 --> 00:49:42,888
HE CAN SACRIFICE SOME PROFITS,

1054
00:49:42,888 --> 00:49:45,557
KEEP HIS TECHNOLOGY,
AND IN THE LONG TERM

1055
00:49:45,557 --> 00:49:49,144
BE MUCH BETTER OFF
MANUFACTURING
IN THE UNITED STATES.

1056
00:49:49,144 --> 00:49:51,606
CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN

1057
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:53,399
UNDERSTANDS THIS DISTINCTION

1058
00:49:53,399 --> 00:49:55,901
BETWEEN SMALL DOMESTIC
MANUFACTURERS

1059
00:49:55,901 --> 00:49:58,613
AND THE BIG, WELL-HEELED
MULTINATIONALS

1060
00:49:58,613 --> 00:49:59,780
BETTER THAN MOST.

1061
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,573
THERE'S A HUGE DIVIDE HERE

1062
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:05,620
BETWEEN THE MOM AND POP
TOOL AND DIE MAKER

1063
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,747
THAT HAS BEEN
IN YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO

1064
00:50:07,747 --> 00:50:08,997
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS

1065
00:50:08,997 --> 00:50:09,832
AND THE GLOBAL CORPORATION

1066
00:50:10,832 --> 00:50:13,794
THAT'S INVOLVED IN THE GLOBAL
FINANCING OF ALL OF THIS STUFF,

1067
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:15,254
THE GLOBAL MANUFACTURING,

1068
00:50:15,254 --> 00:50:19,216
AND NOT REALLY CONCERNED
WITH ANY ONE COUNTRY.

1069
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,718
THEY'RE CONCERNED WITH
HOW THEY CAN BEST DO BUSINESS.

1070
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,763
AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST
OBSTACLES

1071
00:50:24,763 --> 00:50:26,515
TO PASSING TOUGH LEGISLATION

1072
00:50:26,515 --> 00:50:30,060
THAT WOULD STOP CHINA'S
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES

1073
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,104
IS THE LACK OF POLITICAL CLOUT

1074
00:50:32,104 --> 00:50:34,774
OF AMERICA'S
DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS.

1075
00:50:34,774 --> 00:50:39,611
AND TO GO CHASING DOWN AFTER
ALL OF THE POLITICAL RHETORIC

1076
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:42,031
OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE
AND THAT ISSUE

1077
00:50:42,031 --> 00:50:45,368
AND RUNNING TO ALBANY
OR RUNNING TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

1078
00:50:45,368 --> 00:50:49,037
AND SETTING UP MEETINGS
AND STUFF,

1079
00:50:49,037 --> 00:50:50,832
IT'S TOO COSTLY,
IT'S TOO TIME-CONSUMING,

1080
00:50:51,832 --> 00:50:56,671
AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BUILDING DRUM-AND
BARREL-HANDLING EQUIPMENT

1081
00:50:56,671 --> 00:51:00,550
AND HELPING THIS COMPANY
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

1082
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,968
AND THAT'S THE ISSUE HERE.

1083
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:03,510
THEY DON'T HAVE LOBBYISTS
DOWN HERE.

1084
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,305
THERE'S VERY FEW ORGANIZATIONS

1085
00:51:06,305 --> 00:51:08,057
THAT REALLY REPRESENT

1086
00:51:08,057 --> 00:51:10,852
THE SMALL AND MID-SIZED
MANUFACTURERS.

1087
00:51:10,852 --> 00:51:11,852
I CAN THINK OF ONE OR TWO

1088
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:14,647
THAT REALLY DO A GREAT JOB,

1089
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:17,232
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE IMPACT,

1090
00:51:17,232 --> 00:51:18,734
THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS,

1091
00:51:18,734 --> 00:51:19,986
THE CORPORATE INFLUENCE

1092
00:51:19,986 --> 00:51:21,528
THAT SOME OF THE BIG DOGS HAVE.

1093
00:51:21,528 --> 00:51:24,115
AND JUST WHO
IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DOGS

1094
00:51:24,115 --> 00:51:26,242
ON THE CAPITOL HILL
LOBBYING BLOCK?

1095
00:51:26,242 --> 00:51:28,118
BEHIND ME IS THE HEADQUARTERS

1096
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,204
OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF MANUFACTURERS,

1097
00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:34,040
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY
HAS BECOME A MAJOR MISNOMER
IN RECENT YEARS,

1098
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,002
BECAUSE THE NAME
REALLY SHOULD BE

1099
00:51:36,002 --> 00:51:38,839
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF MANUFACTURING THINGS
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

1100
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,673
IF YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK

1101
00:51:41,673 --> 00:51:44,718
AT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF MANUFACTURERS' MEETINGS

1102
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:45,803
IN WHICH THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT

1103
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:51,517
ENDORSING OR
NOT ENDORSING THE RYAN-MURPHY
CHINA CURRENCY BILL,

1104
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:54,019
YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE
WAS A HUGE SPLIT

1105
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:57,689
WHERE THE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED
MANUFACTURERS ENDORSED THE BILL.

1106
00:51:57,689 --> 00:51:58,816
BUT THE 20% OF THE MEMBERSHIP

1107
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,236
THAT GIVES 80% OF THE DUES

1108
00:52:02,236 --> 00:52:05,035
DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE RYAN-MURPHY
CHINA CURRENCY BILL.

1109
00:52:09,035 --> 00:52:09,827
BRIAN O'SHAUGHNESSY

1110
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,662
IS THE CHAIRMAN
OF REVERE COPPER,

1111
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:16,042
A COMPANY FOUNDED
BY NONE OTHER THAN PAUL REVERE

1112
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:17,836
AND THE OLDEST MANUFACTURER
IN AMERICA.

1113
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:21,296
AND O'SHAUGHNESSY HAS BEEN
ON THE INSIDE

1114
00:52:21,296 --> 00:52:23,841
OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF MANUFACTURERS

1115
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:27,720
WHEN IT HAS OPPOSED BILLS LIKE
THOSE OFFERED UP BY TIM RYAN

1116
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,430
TO STOP CHINA'S
CURRENCY MANIPULATION.

1117
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,225
I STOOD UP BEFORE A GROUP

1118
00:52:32,225 --> 00:52:34,769
OF 300 OF THE MOST POWERFUL CEOs

1119
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:35,937
IN THIS COUNTRY,

1120
00:52:35,937 --> 00:52:38,272
AND I TOLD THEM,

1121
00:52:38,272 --> 00:52:42,734
AS WE CONSIDER N-A-M SUPPORT
OF THIS BILL,

1122
00:52:42,734 --> 00:52:47,240
I THINK THOSE OF YOU
WHO HAVE FACILITIES IN CHINA,

1123
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,033
I THINK YOU SHOULD RECUSE
YOURSELF FROM VOTING.

1124
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,077
YOU'RE CONFLICTED.

1125
00:52:52,077 --> 00:52:56,915
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN YOUR COMPANY
AND YOUR COUNTRY,

1126
00:52:56,915 --> 00:52:58,417
AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

1127
00:52:58,417 --> 00:53:01,879
WELL, I WAS SHOT DOWN
IN FLAMES.

1128
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:03,631
BY ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES,

1129
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:06,758
A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES
ARE NOT AMERICAN COMPANIES
ANYMORE.

1130
00:53:06,758 --> 00:53:08,928
[SLANE]
GENERAL MOTORS TAKES TARP MONEY

1131
00:53:08,928 --> 00:53:10,930
AND OPENS UP FACTORIES
IN CHINA.

1132
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,265
CATERPILLAR TRACTOR

1133
00:53:12,265 --> 00:53:14,432
SHUTS DOWN PLANTS IN PEORIA

1134
00:53:14,432 --> 00:53:16,894
AND OPENS UP THREE FACTORIES
IN CHINA.

1135
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:19,147
GENERAL ELECTRIC AND BOEING

1136
00:53:19,147 --> 00:53:20,816
ARE ESSENTIALLY TRYING
TO BECOME CHINESE COMPANIES.

1137
00:53:21,816 --> 00:53:24,776
LOOK AT COCA-COLA.

1138
00:53:24,776 --> 00:53:26,611
AMERICAN-SOUNDING COMPANY,
ISN'T IT?

1139
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:31,658
HOW AMERICAN CAN YOU GET
OTHER THAN REVERE OR COCA-COLA?

1140
00:53:31,658 --> 00:53:35,537
THE PRESIDENT OF COCA-COLA
IS FROM SOUTH AFRICA.

1141
00:53:35,537 --> 00:53:37,080
THE CHAIRMAN IS FROM TURKEY.

1142
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,751
NOW, YOU WANNA ASK THEM

1143
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:45,089
WHAT AMERICA'S INTERNATIONAL
TRADE POLICY SHOULD BE?

1144
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:47,591
YOU SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO THEM.

1145
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:51,805
WHILE COCA COLA'S EXECUTIVE
SUITE MAY LOOK LIKE
THE UNITED NATIONS,

1146
00:53:52,805 --> 00:53:55,515
IT IS PURE BRED AMERICAN
CEOs

1147
00:53:55,515 --> 00:53:59,729
FROM COMPANIES LIKE CISCO,
FORD, IBM,

1148
00:53:59,729 --> 00:54:03,566
HONEYWELL, MOTOROLA, INTEL,

1149
00:54:03,566 --> 00:54:05,318
AND APPLE

1150
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:08,403
THAT KEEP SENDING
SO MANY OF OUR JOBS TO CHINA.

1151
00:54:08,403 --> 00:54:10,865
[MCCORMACK]
WE DESIGN THE iPAD. GREAT.

1152
00:54:10,865 --> 00:54:13,283
WE GET THE PROFITS
FROM THE iPAD. FINE.

1153
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,660
WE DON'T GET THE JOBS.

1154
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:17,330
PROFITS VERSUS JOBS.

1155
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:20,124
THAT'S A CONFLICT
RALPH GOMORY SEES

1156
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:23,127
AS THE ROOT OF AMERICA'S
OFFSHORING PROBLEM.

1157
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:27,881
THEY ARE PURSUING
MAXIMIZING PROFIT.
THAT'S THEIR GOAL.

1158
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:30,218
THE COUNTRY IS LOSING
THE WAGE BILL.

1159
00:54:30,218 --> 00:54:32,678
AND ITS GOAL IS TO HAVE WAGES.

1160
00:54:32,678 --> 00:54:35,055
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS RIGHT
FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS

1161
00:54:35,055 --> 00:54:36,723
AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS,

1162
00:54:36,723 --> 00:54:39,894
BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT
FOR THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA

1163
00:54:39,894 --> 00:54:42,437
WHO ARE UNABLE TO FIND WORK
TODAY.

1164
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:44,731
THE PROBLEM WITH OUR SYSTEM

1165
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:46,901
IS THAT IT IS EVERYTHING IS
SHORT TERM

1166
00:54:46,901 --> 00:54:48,528
SO WHEN YOU TALK TO A CEO

1167
00:54:48,528 --> 00:54:50,988
AND YOU SAY TO A CEO,
AN AMERICAN CEO,

1168
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:53,198
"DO YOU REALIZE THAT THEY'RE
GOING TO TAKE YOUR TECHNOLOGY

1169
00:54:53,198 --> 00:54:54,450
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE
YOUR COMPETITOR?"

1170
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,285
THE CEO SAYS,

1171
00:54:56,285 --> 00:54:59,747
"YES, BUT I ONLY HAVE THREE OR
FOUR YEARS TO GET MY STOCK UP

1172
00:54:59,747 --> 00:55:01,207
SO I CAN GET MY BONUS,"

1173
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:01,834
AND THEY KICK THE CAN
DOWN THE ROAD,

1174
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:04,209
AND IT'S THE NEXT GUY'S PROBLEM.

1175
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:07,463
THIS WILL END BADLY
FOR ALL OF US,

1176
00:55:07,463 --> 00:55:09,756
BUT EVERYBODY
IS SO SHORT TERM IN THINKING

1177
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:11,216
AND IN THEIR TENURE

1178
00:55:11,216 --> 00:55:13,135
THAT THEY'RE WILLING
TO TAKE CHANCES

1179
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:14,511
THAT ARE RIGHT FOR TODAY

1180
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,472
THAT THEY PROBABLY KNOW
IN THEIR MINDS

1181
00:55:16,472 --> 00:55:19,600
IS LONG TERM BAD
FOR AMERICA TOMORROW.

1182
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,144
IRONICALLY,

1183
00:55:21,144 --> 00:55:22,812
NOBODY UNDERSTOOD THIS GROWING
DIVERGENCE

1184
00:55:23,812 --> 00:55:26,857
BETWEEN CORPORATE INTERESTS
AND THE COMMON GOOD

1185
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:29,068
BETTER THAN CANDIDATE
BILL CLINTON

1186
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:31,319
DURING THE 1992 ELECTIONS.

1187
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:34,031
YOU MUST DO YOUR PART.

1188
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,158
YOU MUST BE RESPONSIBLE.

1189
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:40,454
AMERICAN COMPANIES MUST ACT
LIKE AMERICAN COMPANIES AGAIN,

1190
00:55:40,454 --> 00:55:43,417
EXPORTING PRODUCTS NOT JOBS.

1191
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:48,086
BUT SUCH CORPORATE
IRRESPONSIBILITY

1192
00:55:48,086 --> 00:55:50,756
WASN'T ALWAYS THE AMERICAN WAY.

1193
00:55:50,756 --> 00:55:54,093
CORPORATIONS
USED TO THINK THEY HAD
A STAKEHOLDER THEORY.

1194
00:55:54,093 --> 00:55:56,636
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY HAD A
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE NATION,

1195
00:55:56,636 --> 00:55:59,182
TO THEIR COMMUNITY,
TO THEIR WORKERS,

1196
00:55:59,182 --> 00:56:01,475
AND TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS.

1197
00:56:01,475 --> 00:56:05,562
SOMETHING MORPHED IN OUR OWN
SYSTEM ABOUT 20, 25 YEARS AGO

1198
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:09,274
WHERE SHAREHOLDER VALUE
BECAME THE END-ALL AND BE-ALL,

1199
00:56:09,274 --> 00:56:11,986
AND THEN THE CEOs TIED
THEIR OWN COMPENSATION

1200
00:56:11,986 --> 00:56:14,113
TO SHAREHOLDER VALUE,

1201
00:56:14,113 --> 00:56:15,490
AND THEN OTHER COUNTRIES

1202
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,867
FIGURED OUT
HOW TO INCENTIVIZE THEM

1203
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:20,285
TO INCREASE SHORT-TERM
SHAREHOLDER VALUE

1204
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:24,957
BY TRANSFERRING PRODUCTION,
MANUFACTURING, R&D THERE.

1205
00:56:24,957 --> 00:56:25,834
AND WE CAN NEVER FORGET

1206
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:29,002
THAT WHEN CHINA MANIPULATES
CURRENCY,

1207
00:56:29,002 --> 00:56:31,714
WHEN CHINA PROVIDES ILLEGAL
SUBSIDIES OF ALL SORTS

1208
00:56:31,714 --> 00:56:33,633
FOR MANUFACTURING,

1209
00:56:33,633 --> 00:56:35,718
FOR THE ACT
OF EXPORTING ITSELF,

1210
00:56:35,718 --> 00:56:38,095
THESE U.S.-OWNED COMPANIES
BENEFIT.

1211
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:39,513
THEY LIKE THE STATUS QUO,

1212
00:56:39,513 --> 00:56:40,972
THEY WANT TO PROTECT IT,

1213
00:56:40,972 --> 00:56:43,017
AND THEY HAVE PAID
A LOT OF MONEY FOR IT.

1214
00:56:43,017 --> 00:56:47,479
MONEY AND THE POWER OF
AMERICA'S MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATIONS

1215
00:56:47,479 --> 00:56:50,066
IN INFLUENCING
CHINA TRADE POLICY--

1216
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:54,486
THAT'S SOMETHING TWO MEN
FROM TWO DISTINCTLY
DIFFERENT WORLDS

1217
00:56:54,486 --> 00:56:55,530
CAN AGREE ON.

1218
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:56,948
I LIVE IN THAT WORLD.

1219
00:56:56,948 --> 00:56:58,740
I'VE WATCHED THOSE DOLLARS GO.

1220
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,117
CAMPAIGN LAWS ALLOW THEM

1221
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:02,370
TO SPEND UNLIMITLESS
AMOUNTS OF MONEY.

1222
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,247
IT'S A TSUNAMI.

1223
00:57:04,247 --> 00:57:07,082
BUT TO FORMER WHITE HOUSE
ADVISOR JARED BERNSTEIN,

1224
00:57:07,082 --> 00:57:11,504
IT'S MORE THAN JUST MONEY
AND POLITICS DRIVING
OUR JOBS OFFSHORE.

1225
00:57:11,504 --> 00:57:14,381
IT'S ALSO THE PREVAILING
FREE MARKET VIEW

1226
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:15,633
IN THE OVAL OFFICE,

1227
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:18,093
REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL PARTY.

1228
00:57:18,093 --> 00:57:20,555
I THINK THAT THERE IS
A DEEPLY EMBEDDED VIEW

1229
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:22,515
THAT I DO NOT THINK
IS WHOLLY WRONG,

1230
00:57:22,515 --> 00:57:24,642
THAT CAPITAL MUST BE HAPPY

1231
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:27,352
IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY.

1232
00:57:27,352 --> 00:57:29,062
AND NO MULTINATIONAL COMPANY

1233
00:57:29,062 --> 00:57:32,566
HAS BEEN HAPPIER
TO MOVE ITS CAPITAL OFFSHORE

1234
00:57:32,566 --> 00:57:34,359
THAN GENERAL ELECTRIC,

1235
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:37,113
BUT THIS IS TRULY
A FOOL'S GAME.

1236
00:57:37,113 --> 00:57:40,240
[SLANE]
THE CHINESE HAVE NO INTENTION

1237
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,993
OF TURNING OVER
THEIR DOMESTIC MARKET

1238
00:57:41,993 --> 00:57:43,618
TO FOREIGN COMPANIES.

1239
00:57:43,618 --> 00:57:46,914
ONCE THEY'RE ABLE
TO MASTER THE TECHNOLOGY,

1240
00:57:46,914 --> 00:57:49,959
THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE IT
VERY DIFFICULT

1241
00:57:49,959 --> 00:57:52,294
FOR FOREIGN CORPORATIONS
TO MAKE A PROFIT.

1242
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:54,714
WHEN I GO OUT AND DO SPEECHES
TO CORPORATE AUDIENCES ON CHINA

1243
00:57:54,714 --> 00:57:57,258
AND THEY WANT ME TO TALK
ABOUT STRATEGY,

1244
00:57:57,258 --> 00:57:59,343
IT'S LIKE.
"HEY, YOU'RE GOING OVER
TO CHINA.

1245
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:01,470
"YOU'RE GIVING
THEM YOUR AVIONICS

1246
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,890
"SO YOU CAN PARTICIPATE
IN A REGIONAL JET GAME IN CHINA,

1247
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:07,852
"AND TWO OR THREE
OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW,

1248
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:10,521
"YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO SELL
YOUR REGIONAL JETS IN EUROPE,

1249
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:13,316
"AND YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITOR
IS GOING TO BE THAT CHINA GUY.

1250
00:58:13,316 --> 00:58:15,026
HOW STUPID IS THAT?"

1251
00:58:15,026 --> 00:58:17,111
WHAT'S HAPPENING UNFORTUNATELY
IN THE UNITED STATES

1252
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:20,448
IS WAY TOO MANY OF OUR
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS,

1253
00:58:20,448 --> 00:58:23,242
NOT ONLY THEY'RE SHIFTING
THEIR MANUFACTURING OVERSEAS,

1254
00:58:23,242 --> 00:58:25,660
BUT ALONG WITH IT
GOES THEIR TECHNOLOGY,

1255
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,622
THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

1256
00:58:27,622 --> 00:58:29,749
AND WHILE MANY OF US ARE
CONCERNED, DEEPLY CONCERNED,

1257
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:31,709
ABOUT THE LOSS OF JOBS,

1258
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:34,504
WE'RE JUST AS CONCERNED
ABOUT THE LOSS OF
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

1259
00:58:34,504 --> 00:58:36,129
THAT'S SORT OF THE FUTURE
OF AMERICA.

1260
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:37,964
THE THING IS
NOBODY HAS REALLY LOOKED

1261
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:41,426
AT ALL THE INDUSTRIES
THAT HAVE BEEN LOST.

1262
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:44,555
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET
INFORMATION ON THE INDUSTRIES
THAT ARE GONE,

1263
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:46,307
OR THAT ARE JUST ABOUT GONE,

1264
00:58:46,307 --> 00:58:48,810
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT
DOESN'T KEEP TRACK OF ANY DATA.

1265
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,269
THEY DON'T FOLLOW INDUSTRIES.

1266
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:52,854
THEY HAVE NO MARKET ANALYSTS

1267
00:58:52,854 --> 00:58:54,564
WHO FOLLOW SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES,

1268
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:57,151
SO NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENED

1269
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,278
WITH ALL OF OUR INDUSTRIAL
CAPACITY THAT'S VANISHED,

1270
00:58:59,278 --> 00:59:01,613
OR IS IN THE PROCESS
OF VANISHING.

1271
00:59:01,613 --> 00:59:04,950
THE NEXT THING YOU SEE
IS YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY WORK
OVER THERE YOURSELF.

1272
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,993
THE CHINESE ARE DOING IT
FOR YOU ENTIRELY.

1273
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:08,370
AND WE SEE THAT.

1274
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,539
THE TWO MID-RANGE AIRCRAFT
IN THE WORLD

1275
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:14,459
ARE THE AIRBUS 319
AND THE BOEING 737.

1276
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:16,044
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW,

1277
00:59:16,044 --> 00:59:17,964
THE CHINESE HAVE ALREADY TOLD
BOTH COMPANIES,

1278
00:59:17,964 --> 00:59:20,466
THEY WILL NO LONGER BUY
EITHER AIRCRAFT.

1279
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:24,553
THAT MID-RANGE AIRCRAFT,
THE ONE THAT IS DOMINATE
THROUGHOUT ASIA,

1280
00:59:24,553 --> 00:59:26,972
WILL BE ENTIRELY
MANUFACTURED IN CHINA

1281
00:59:26,972 --> 00:59:29,350
UNDER A CHINESE MARK OR NAME

1282
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,310
USING TECHNOLOGY
THAT THEY TOOK

1283
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,314
FROM AIRBUS ON THE ONE HAND
AND BOEING ON THE OTHER.

1284
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:38,484
? LOOK AROUND ?

1285
00:59:38,484 --> 00:59:43,363
? TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE ?

1286
00:59:43,363 --> 00:59:48,580
? EVERY DAY MORE PEOPLE
IN THE STREET ?

1287
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,622
? TOO BAD ?

1288
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:57,544
? THEY SENT OUR JOBS AWAY ?

1289
00:59:57,544 --> 01:00:02,385
? IN CHINA
THEY'RE NOT WORKERS,
THEY'RE JUST SLAVES ?

1290
01:00:04,385 --> 01:00:06,178
? PEOPLE, WAKE ?

1291
01:00:06,178 --> 01:00:11,434
? IT'S A WORLD
OF TRADE AND GREED ?

1292
01:00:11,434 --> 01:00:15,312
? AND THE CEOs GET RICHER ?

1293
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:18,482
? AND OUR JOBS ALL MOVE
OFF SHORE ?

1294
01:00:18,482 --> 00:00:21,412
? OH-OH-OH-OH ?

1295
01:00:31,412 --> 01:00:33,455
THE SOVIET UNION

1296
01:00:33,455 --> 01:00:36,667
COULD MAKE AN UNBELIEVABLE
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC
MISSILE,

1297
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:38,919
BUT THEY COULDN'T MAKE
A LOAF OF BREAD.

1298
01:00:38,919 --> 01:00:41,714
NOW, WE CAN MAKE
A STEALTH FIGHTER,

1299
01:00:41,714 --> 01:00:43,925
BUT WE CAN'T MAKE
A PAIR OF SHOES.

1300
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:45,468
YOU CAN'T BE A WORLD POWER

1301
01:00:45,468 --> 01:00:47,553
IF YOU DON'T MAKE ANYTHING
BUT HOT AIR,

1302
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:49,555
AND WE'RE
WELL ON OUR WAY TO THAT.

1303
01:00:49,555 --> 01:00:52,725
YOU CAN'T HAVE SUSTAINABLE,
LONG-RUN ECONOMIC GROWTH

1304
01:00:52,725 --> 01:00:54,685
AT ROBUST LEVELS

1305
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:57,062
IN THE ABSENCE
OF A MANUFACTURING BASE.

1306
01:00:57,062 --> 01:00:59,314
LESS THAN NINE PERCENT
OF AMERICAN WORKERS

1307
01:00:59,314 --> 01:01:01,526
ARE NOW IN
THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR.

1308
01:01:01,526 --> 01:01:03,568
WE AS A COUNTRY CAN'T SURVIVE

1309
01:01:03,568 --> 01:01:06,155
INTO THE LONG TERM
WITH UNDER 25%

1310
01:01:06,155 --> 01:01:07,656
OF OUR WOMEN AND MEN
MAKING THINGS.

1311
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:09,325
MANUFACTURING JOBS

1312
01:01:09,325 --> 01:01:12,787
HAVE A HIGHER MULTIPLIER
THAN SERVICE INDUSTRY JOBS.

1313
01:01:12,787 --> 01:01:16,665
THAT IS TO SAY,
EVERY ONE MANUFACTURING JOB
THAT YOU BRING INTO A COMMUNITY

1314
01:01:16,665 --> 01:01:19,752
ULTIMATELY SUPPORTS
HALF A DOZEN OTHER JOBS.

1315
01:01:19,752 --> 01:01:23,296
IF YOU ARE HONEST
ABOUT HOW JOBS HAVE EVOLVED
IN THE UNITED STATES,

1316
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:25,173
SMALL BUSINESSES AROSE

1317
01:01:25,173 --> 01:01:28,385
ONLY WHEN THERE
WAS A STABLE MANUFACTURING BASE
PUT UNDER THEM.

1318
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:31,347
MY MOTHER, AND MANY MOTHERS
OF YOURS, I'M SURE,

1319
01:01:31,347 --> 01:01:32,848
UP ON THE COMMISSION,

1320
01:01:32,848 --> 01:01:35,517
THEY GAVE THEMSELVES
HOME PERMANENTS.

1321
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:38,437
IT WAS ONLY WHEN THERE WAS
A STABILITY OF MIDDLE-CLASS
INCOMES

1322
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:40,647
THAT YOU HAD BEAUTY PARLORS
AND NAIL SALONS

1323
01:01:40,647 --> 01:01:42,399
AND PIZZA PARLORS
AND MCDONALDS

1324
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:44,776
AND ALL OF THE THINGS WE THINK
OF AS SMALL BUSINESS.

1325
01:01:44,776 --> 01:01:48,196
EVERY ONE MANUFACTURING JOB
THAT YOU BRING INTO A COMMUNITY

1326
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:51,033
ULTIMATELY SUPPORTS
HALF A DOZEN OTHER JOBS.

1327
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:52,868
THOSE MANUFACTURERS

1328
01:01:52,868 --> 01:01:55,162
PROVIDE THE GOOD-PAYING JOBS
IN OUR COMMUNITY,

1329
01:01:55,162 --> 01:01:59,040
AND IT'S THE JOBS THAT
A FATHER OR MOTHER CAN
WORK AT THE FACTORY,

1330
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,542
RAISE THEIR FAMILY,

1331
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:02,627
HAVE SOME HEALTH CARE,
HAVE A SAFE PENSION,

1332
01:02:02,627 --> 01:02:06,966
DONATE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY
INTO THE BASKET IN CHURCH ON
SUNDAY,

1333
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:08,301
VOTE FOR THE SCHOOL LEVY,

1334
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:09,635
VOTE FOR THE POLICE
AND FIRE LEVY,

1335
01:02:09,635 --> 01:02:12,095
TO HELP BUILD
STRONG COMMUNITIES,

1336
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:15,265
AND WHEN THOSE FACTORIES
GOT WIPED OUT

1337
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:17,642
AND THEY WENT FROM
200 TO 30 PEOPLE,

1338
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:19,187
IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT

1339
01:02:19,187 --> 01:02:21,062
FOR THESE COMMUNITIES
TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES.

1340
01:02:21,062 --> 01:02:23,857
ULTIMATELY
THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON

1341
01:02:23,857 --> 01:02:27,444
WHY AMERICA MUST RESTORE
ITS MANUFACTURING BASE

1342
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:30,823
IS TO HOLD ON TO THE
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,
THE R&D.

1343
01:02:31,823 --> 01:02:35,785
THAT IS THE TAP ROOT OF ALL OF
THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS

1344
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:39,624
WE WILL NEED TO CREATE
NEW JOBS IN NEW INDUSTRIES.

1345
01:02:39,624 --> 01:02:44,461
MANUFACTURING IS THE ORIGIN
OF 70% OF U.S. R&D.

1346
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:46,379
THAT'S TRUE EVEN TODAY.

1347
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:49,050
YOU CAN'T DO YOUR R&D HERE AND
DO YOUR MANUFACTURING THERE.

1348
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:51,843
YOU CAN'T MOVE YOUR
MANUFACTURING OVERSEAS

1349
01:02:51,843 --> 01:02:54,638
AND NOT MOVE YOUR TECHNOLOGY
AND ALL YOUR ENGINEERING.

1350
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:57,475
IT'S NICE TO DO R&D AND COME UP
WITH A SUPER-DUPER DESIGN

1351
01:02:57,475 --> 01:02:59,894
OR A NEW PRODUCT,
BUT IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT,

1352
01:02:59,894 --> 01:03:01,604
WHAT'S THE SENSE OF DOING
THE R&D?

1353
01:03:01,604 --> 01:03:04,022
WHEN WE SAY WE'VE KEPT OUR
TECHNOLOGY OR OUR I.P.

1354
01:03:04,022 --> 01:03:05,857
BUT WE'VE MOVED
OUR MANUFACTURING,

1355
01:03:05,857 --> 01:03:07,234
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

1356
01:03:07,234 --> 01:03:08,486
IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE FEAT.

1357
01:03:08,486 --> 01:03:09,946
THEY'RE TOTALLY COUPLED.

1358
01:03:09,946 --> 01:03:12,365
SO AS MANUFACTURING
HAS MOVED OFF SHORE,

1359
01:03:12,365 --> 01:03:13,990
R&D HAS GONE RIGHT WITH IT.

1360
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,120
SO AS WE MOVE MORE AND MORE
MANUFACTURING OVER TO CHINA,

1361
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,455
AND PEOPLE CAN RE-ENGINEER

1362
01:03:19,455 --> 01:03:20,957
AND UNDERSTAND HOW
THINGS ARE MADE,

1363
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:22,582
WE ARE TEACHING THE COUNTRY

1364
01:03:22,582 --> 01:03:22,834
HOW TO COMPETE WITH US,

1365
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:25,211
AND ULTIMATELY THEY ARE.

1366
01:03:25,211 --> 01:03:27,088
SO THAT THE NEW PRODUCTS,

1367
01:03:27,088 --> 01:03:27,839
THE NEXT CUTTING EDGE PRODUCT,

1368
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:29,800
IS BEING DEVELOPED THERE

1369
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,468
WHERE THE MANUFACTURING'S
GOING ON IN CHINA

1370
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:36,055
RATHER THAN HERE WHERE
THE MANUFACTURING WAS

1371
01:03:36,055 --> 01:03:37,530
AND NOW IS NO LONGER.

1372
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:58,910
? THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
AROUND IT ?

1373
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:05,126
? WE CAN'T MAKE IT
ON OUR OWN ?

1374
01:04:05,126 --> 01:04:11,631
? ALL THE JOBS WENT TO CHINA ?

1375
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:15,899
? NOW I'M LOSING MY OWN HOME ?

1376
01:04:27,899 --> 01:04:29,441
WE NEED TO CHANGE COURSE.

1377
01:04:29,441 --> 01:04:32,694
WE NEED DEFINITIVE U.S. ACTION.

1378
01:04:32,694 --> 01:04:35,698
WE NEED TO SHOW THE CHINESE
THAT THERE ARE LIMITS,

1379
01:04:35,698 --> 01:04:36,825
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE
RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS,

1380
01:04:37,825 --> 01:04:40,410
AND THAT IF THEY'RE NOT
RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS,

1381
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,995
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.

1382
01:04:41,995 --> 01:04:46,459
I LIKE THE IDEA OF DOING
BUSINESS WITH CHINA.

1383
01:04:46,459 --> 01:04:48,419
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE
OVER THERE.

1384
01:04:48,419 --> 01:04:52,964
BUT, IT SHOULD BE,
IT MUST BE ON OUR TERMS.

1385
01:04:52,964 --> 01:04:55,468
IF IT'S NOT ON OUR TERMS,

1386
01:04:55,468 --> 01:04:56,968
THEN IT'S ON THEIR TERMS,

1387
01:04:56,968 --> 01:04:58,428
AND IF IT'S ON THEIR TERMS,

1388
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:00,430
THEY DON'T HAVE OUR BEST
INTERESTS IN MIND.

1389
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,642
PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY

1390
01:05:02,642 --> 01:05:05,937
THAT WE CAN'T STAND UP TO THE
CHINESE ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES

1391
01:05:05,937 --> 01:05:08,856
BECAUSE WE RISK STARTING
A, QUOTE, "TRADE WAR."

1392
01:05:08,856 --> 01:05:10,857
MY MESSAGE
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

1393
01:05:10,857 --> 01:05:13,568
IS THAT WE ARE ALREADY
IN A TRADE WAR.

1394
01:05:13,568 --> 01:05:15,988
WHAT'S WRONG WITH TAKING
CHINA TO TASK?

1395
01:05:15,988 --> 01:05:18,240
THEY PIRATE OUR TECHNOLOGY.

1396
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,660
THEY PIRATE OUR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

1397
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,787
THEY COUNTERFEIT
OUR GOODS AND SERVICES,

1398
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:26,499
AND NO ADMINISTRATION
HAS THE BACKBONE
TO STAND UP TO THEM.

1399
01:05:26,499 --> 01:05:28,459
IT'S BEEN DISMAYING
FOR ME TO SEE

1400
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:30,461
A SUCCESSION
OF ADMINISTRATIONS,

1401
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:32,254
BOTH REPUBLICAN
AND DEMOCRATIC,

1402
01:05:32,254 --> 01:05:33,923
UNABLE OR UNWILLING

1403
01:05:33,923 --> 01:05:36,216
TO TAKE ON
THE CHINA TRADE IMBALANCE,

1404
01:05:36,216 --> 01:05:39,511
AND I WOULD SAY PART
OF THAT IS THE VERY COZY
RELATIONSHIP

1405
01:05:39,511 --> 01:05:43,015
THAT ANY WHITE HOUSE HAS
WITH THE BIG MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATIONS

1406
01:05:43,015 --> 01:05:44,642
AND WITH
THE INTELLECTUAL ELITE

1407
01:05:44,642 --> 01:05:47,727
THAT HAVE TAKEN
A VERY SOFT VIEW
ON THIS ISSUE,

1408
01:05:47,727 --> 01:05:50,231
SO I THINK BOTH DEMOCRATIC
AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS

1409
01:05:50,231 --> 01:05:52,191
HAVE FAILED US IN THE SAME WAY.

1410
01:05:52,191 --> 01:05:53,901
SO HOW DO WE THE PEOPLE

1411
01:05:53,901 --> 01:05:55,903
OVERCOME THE POWER
AND INFLUENCE

1412
01:05:55,903 --> 01:05:58,698
OF THE BIG MULTINATIONAL
COMPANIES

1413
01:05:58,698 --> 01:06:00,240
AND THE DEADLY INERTIA

1414
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,410
OF OUR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP

1415
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,120
TO BRING ABOUT
LONG OVERDUE CHANGES

1416
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,414
IN THE U.S.-CHINA
TRADE RELATIONSHIP?

1417
01:06:07,414 --> 01:06:09,292
IT ALMOST TAKES A MOVEMENT,

1418
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:13,171
A TEA PARTY
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN--

1419
01:06:13,171 --> 01:06:16,548
THAT'S COMPLETELY DIVORCED
OF LEFT OR RIGHT.

1420
01:06:16,548 --> 01:06:18,758
IT'S VIRTUALLY A TEA PARTY

1421
01:06:18,758 --> 01:06:21,345
THAT DIFFERENTIATES
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG,

1422
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:23,930
WHICH IS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN LEFT OR RIGHT.

1423
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:25,390
I THINK THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN

1424
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,100
WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
REALLY UNDERSTAND

1425
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,312
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO US

1426
01:06:29,312 --> 01:06:31,814
AND BEGIN TO DEMAND
THAT THEIR CONGRESSMEN
AND SENATORS REALLY--

1427
01:06:32,814 --> 01:06:34,274
AND THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT--

1428
01:06:34,274 --> 01:06:35,901
TAKE ACTION IN THESE AREAS.

1429
01:06:35,901 --> 01:06:37,861
I THINK THAT AT EVERY LEVEL,

1430
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:39,738
PEOPLE COULD BOYCOTT
TO SOME EXTENT,

1431
01:06:39,738 --> 01:06:42,033
AND THERE WOULD BE A SHOT
HEARD AROUND THE WORLD.

1432
01:06:42,033 --> 01:06:45,410
IT'S GOT TO BE A WHOLE
COMMUNITY EFFORT
BY THE CITIZENRY,

1433
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:48,289
BUT WE DO NEED TO CREATE JOBS.

1434
01:06:48,289 --> 01:06:50,040
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN
ACCIDENTALLY.

1435
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,084
HERE'S THE MESSAGE
THAT NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED.

1436
01:06:53,084 --> 01:06:57,173
YOU KNOW, LOOK.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.

1437
01:06:57,173 --> 01:06:59,841
THIS IS AN ECONOMY
AND A GLOBAL ECONOMY

1438
01:06:59,841 --> 01:07:02,178
THAT HAS BEEN MADE
BY POLICY CHOICES,

1439
01:07:02,178 --> 01:07:07,265
POLICY CHOICES
THAT REALLY DO BENEFIT THE RICH

1440
01:07:07,265 --> 01:07:09,352
AND THE MULTINATIONALS.

1441
01:07:09,352 --> 01:07:11,729
THEIR INTERESTS
NO LONGER COINCIDE

1442
01:07:11,729 --> 01:07:13,397
WITH THE INTERESTS
OF THIS COUNTRY,

1443
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:16,901
SO WE HAVE TO DO WHAT'S BEST
FOR THIS COUNTRY.

1444
01:07:16,901 --> 01:07:18,903
THEY'LL DO WHAT'S BEST
FOR THEIR COMPANY,

1445
01:07:18,903 --> 01:07:22,113
BUT WE HAVE TO DO WHAT'S
BEST FOR THIS COUNTRY.

1446
01:07:22,113 --> 01:07:24,033
AND THAT MEANS
ALL OF US COMING TOGETHER,

1447
01:07:24,033 --> 01:07:28,120
BUILDING AN ECONOMY
THAT REALLY DOES WORK
FOR EVERYBODY.

1448
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,914
SO HOW DO WE BUILD
SUCH AN ECONOMY?

1449
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:32,542
WE HAVE TO DECIDE AS A NATION

1450
01:07:32,542 --> 01:07:33,792
THAT WE WANT MANUFACTURING,

1451
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:35,627
THAT WE WANT PROSPERITY

1452
01:07:35,627 --> 01:07:38,171
AND THE GOOD JOBS AND INCOME
THAT COME WITH MANUFACTURING.

1453
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:40,841
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
TO ME IS FLINT, MICHIGAN,

1454
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:43,260
DAYTON, OHIO,
AND BUFFALO, NEW YORK.

1455
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,138
IF YOU DON'T REESTABLISH
THE MANUFACTURING BASE

1456
01:07:46,138 --> 01:07:48,348
OF THIS COUNTRY

1457
01:07:48,348 --> 01:07:50,892
ROUGHLY AT THE LEVEL
OF 20 TO 25% OF WORKERS,

1458
01:07:50,892 --> 01:07:54,981
AND THE MOST IMMEDIATE WAY
TO DO THAT IS TRADE REFORM
WITH CHINA.

1459
01:07:54,981 --> 01:07:57,191
THE BEST JOBS PROGRAM

1460
01:07:57,191 --> 01:07:59,359
IS TRADE REFORM WITH CHINA,

1461
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,530
AND THE ARGUMENT
IS PRETTY SIMPLE.

1462
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,575
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
GROWS WITH ONLY FOUR THINGS--

1463
01:08:05,575 --> 01:08:07,618
CONSUMPTION, INVESTMENT,

1464
01:08:07,618 --> 01:08:10,079
GOVERNMENT SPENDING,
AND NET EXPORTS.

1465
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,999
AND WHEN YOU RUN
A TRADE DEFICIT,

1466
01:08:12,999 --> 01:08:14,876
THE SIMPLE MATH OF THAT

1467
01:08:14,876 --> 01:08:17,669
IS THAT'S A NEGATIVE
IN TERMS OF GROWTH.

1468
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:19,379
I THINK THE NUMBER ONE THING

1469
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:22,091
THAT THE UNITED STATES
HAS TO DO

1470
01:08:22,091 --> 01:08:25,385
IS TO MOVE TO SAY WE ARE
GOING TO BALANCE OUR TRADE.

1471
01:08:25,385 --> 01:08:27,430
LOOK, IF WE HAD
HAD BALANCED TRADE,

1472
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:31,434
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
A DECADE OF A DRAG ON GDP

1473
01:08:31,434 --> 01:08:33,269
THAT AMOUNTED TO ALMOST
A POINT PER YEAR,

1474
01:08:33,269 --> 01:08:35,104
SO OF COURSE
WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF.

1475
01:08:35,104 --> 01:08:37,690
NOW, PEOPLE SAY,
"HOW DO YOU DO THAT?"

1476
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:41,735
I'M A YOUNG GUY
WHEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID,
"WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON."

1477
01:08:41,735 --> 01:08:43,988
HE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE
HOW TO GET TO THE MOON,

1478
01:08:43,988 --> 01:08:45,864
BUT WE SET IT
AS A NATIONAL GOAL

1479
01:08:45,864 --> 01:08:47,408
AND WE FIGURED OUT
HOW TO DO IT

1480
01:08:47,408 --> 01:08:49,075
BECAUSE WE'RE A SMART,
CREATIVE PEOPLE.

1481
01:08:49,075 --> 01:08:52,245
AND IF WE ARE TO TRULY
BALANCE OUR TRADE,

1482
01:08:52,245 --> 01:08:55,248
WE CANNOT DO IT BY BOOSTING
EXPORTS ALONE.

1483
01:08:55,248 --> 01:08:58,211
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS,
"LET'S EXPORT MORE."

1484
01:08:58,211 --> 01:09:01,547
WE'RE NOW EXPORTING
MORE THAN $100 BILLION A YEAR

1485
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:03,966
IN GOODS AND SERVICES
TO CHINA.

1486
01:09:03,966 --> 01:09:06,343
BUT IT ISN'T EXPORTS
THAT MATTER.

1487
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:08,428
IT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.

1488
01:09:08,428 --> 01:09:10,263
EXPORTS ARE GREAT,

1489
01:09:10,263 --> 01:09:13,391
BUT IF YOUR IMPORTS GROW MORE
RAPIDLY THAN YOUR EXPORTS,

1490
01:09:13,391 --> 01:09:14,976
THERE'S A DRAIN ON DEMAND

1491
01:09:14,976 --> 01:09:16,645
FOR WHAT AMERICANS MAKE,

1492
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:18,730
WE GET MORE UNEMPLOYMENT,

1493
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:21,400
AND THE ECONOMY SINKS
INTO THE KIND OF MESS WE'RE IN.

1494
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,569
IF YOU LOOK AT AMERICA TODAY,

1495
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:26,905
WE HAVE A VERY FAST-GROWING
EXPORT SECTOR,

1496
01:09:26,905 --> 01:09:29,659
AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
HOW WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK
WITH EXPORTS.

1497
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:31,577
THAT'S JUST ALL SILLY.

1498
01:09:31,577 --> 01:09:34,913
AMERICA'S GOING TO COME BACK
FROM "IMPORT SUBSTITUTION."

1499
01:09:34,913 --> 01:09:37,249
WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE
OVER THE WORLD IN EXPORTS.

1500
01:09:37,249 --> 01:09:39,418
WE SIMPLY NEED TO GET BACK
OUR MARKET HERE.

1501
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:42,922
IN FACT AMERICAN CONSUMERS
AND CITIZENS

1502
01:09:42,922 --> 01:09:45,632
SEEM TO BE FAR AHEAD
OF OUR POLITICIANS

1503
01:09:45,632 --> 01:09:47,135
WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING

1504
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,802
BOTH THE DANGERS WE FACE

1505
01:09:48,802 --> 01:09:50,846
AND THE NEED
FOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.

1506
01:09:50,846 --> 01:09:53,391
WE'RE A SUBSIDIARY OF CHINA
AND GETTING WORSE AND WORSE

1507
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:54,766
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING
TO OWN US PRETTY SOON.

1508
01:09:54,766 --> 01:09:56,476
NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
BOTH WAYS.

1509
01:09:56,476 --> 01:09:58,020
WE EITHER WANT THE JOBS,

1510
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,480
THE MANUFACTURING,

1511
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,815
EVERYTHING HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES,

1512
01:10:01,815 --> 01:10:03,900
AND WE'RE GONNA BUY IT,

1513
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,654
BUT YOU GO
TO THE STORE AND YOU LOOK
FOR THE CHEAPEST THING,

1514
01:10:06,654 --> 01:10:08,698
WHICH USUALLY COMES FROM CHINA.

1515
01:10:08,698 --> 01:10:10,115
I DO BUY CHINA STUFF,

1516
01:10:10,115 --> 01:10:11,575
BUT I PREFER TO BUY
AMERICAN THINGS.

1517
01:10:11,575 --> 01:10:13,369
[INTERVIEWER]
WHY?

1518
01:10:13,369 --> 01:10:15,997
I THINK IT'S BETTER JUST
TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY HERE

1519
01:10:15,997 --> 01:10:19,167
RATHER THAN-- YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN BUY CHEAPLY IN CHINA,

1520
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:22,043
BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER
FOR OUR ECONOMY IF WE BUY HERE.

1521
01:10:22,043 --> 01:10:24,129
WE'VE ALSO GOT TO LOOK
AT OUR PRINCIPLES, TOO.

1522
01:10:24,129 --> 01:10:25,964
LOOK HOW THEY'RE LIVING.

1523
01:10:25,964 --> 01:10:28,176
IS THAT WHAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT?

1524
01:10:28,176 --> 01:10:30,052
WE OPEN UP OUR MARKETS
TO EVERYBODY,

1525
01:10:30,052 --> 01:10:32,846
AND I THINK THAT IF THAT'S
HOW IT'S GONNA BE,

1526
01:10:32,846 --> 01:10:34,265
IT NEEDS TO BE
A TWO-WAY STREET,

1527
01:10:34,265 --> 01:10:36,100
AND I THINK POLITICALLY,

1528
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:40,730
OUR SYSTEM HAS NOT SUPPORTED,
YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN WORKER,

1529
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:42,647
THE AMERICAN PRODUCT
FROM THAT STANDPOINT.

1530
01:10:42,647 --> 01:10:47,028
AND PERHAPS THE BIGGEST REASON
OUR POLITICIANS ARE FAILING US

1531
01:10:47,028 --> 01:10:49,154
IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TRULY
FORGOTTEN

1532
01:10:49,154 --> 01:10:50,780
THE PROPER ROLE OF GOVERNMENT.

1533
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:53,493
I USED TO DEBATE
A COLLEAGUE OF MINE,

1534
01:10:53,493 --> 01:10:55,035
MY COUNTERPART
FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,

1535
01:10:55,035 --> 01:10:56,870
AND HE USED TO SAY TO ME,

1536
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:57,830
"YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT MY JOB TO
PLAY SANTA CLAUS TO THE WORKERS

1537
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:00,499
"OR TO PAINT MY COMPANY GREEN.

1538
01:11:00,499 --> 01:11:02,376
IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE MONEY
FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS,"

1539
01:11:02,376 --> 01:11:05,462
AND I AGREE WITH THAT.
THAT IS THE JOB OF CORPORATIONS,

1540
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:07,882
BUT IT IS GOVERNMENT'S JOB
TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPANIES
ARE DOING THAT

1541
01:11:07,882 --> 01:11:11,052
WITHIN A FRAMEWORK
THAT MAKES SENSE.

1542
01:11:11,052 --> 01:11:15,640
I THINK THE FIELD
THAT WE'RE PLAYING ON

1543
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,475
NOT ONLY NEEDS TO BE LEVEL,

1544
01:11:17,475 --> 01:11:19,936
BUT I THINK EVERYBODY
NEEDS TO BE ON ONE FIELD.

1545
01:11:19,936 --> 01:11:23,021
WE'RE NOT EVEN ON
THE SAME FIELD AS THE CHINESE.

1546
01:11:23,021 --> 01:11:25,315
WE ARE PAYING VERY GOOD WAGES.

1547
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:27,944
WE ARE PROVIDING HEALTH CARE
TO OUR EMPLOYEES.

1548
01:11:27,944 --> 01:11:30,154
WE ARE IN A REGULATED BUSINESS

1549
01:11:30,154 --> 01:11:35,618
AS FAR AS WORKPLACE SAFETY
FOR OUR EMPLOYEES.

1550
01:11:35,618 --> 01:11:37,410
WE PAY OUR TAXES GLADLY,

1551
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:38,870
AND WE CANNOT COMPETE

1552
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:42,458
WITH A NON-REGULATED WORKPLACE

1553
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:45,503
THAT PAYS THEIR EMPLOYEES
PENNIES

1554
01:11:45,503 --> 01:11:48,964
AND ARE ALLOWED TO IMPORT
THEIR GOODS

1555
01:11:48,964 --> 01:11:51,551
INTO THIS COUNTRY
WITH NO RESTRICTIONS.

1556
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,802
WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE
FOR AMERICA?

1557
01:11:53,802 --> 01:11:57,222
SAY EVERYBODY-- ALL OF OUR
WORKERS SHOULD TAKE A 50%,
60% PAY CUT

1558
01:11:57,222 --> 01:11:58,391
AND THEN WE'LL
REALLY TAKE ON CHINA?

1559
01:11:58,391 --> 01:12:00,767
WE'LL BE-- WE'LL GET THEM.

1560
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:05,021
OR, YOU KNOW, HAVE DIRTIER AIR
OR HAVE THE CUYAHOGA RIVER
CATCH ON FIRE AGAIN

1561
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:06,940
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH
POLLUTION GOING IN.

1562
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:07,818
IS THAT REALLY HOW WE'RE
GOING TO COMPETE WITH CHINA?

1563
01:12:08,818 --> 01:12:10,319
I THINK IT'S
THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE.

1564
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:11,821
I THINK WE REINVEST
BACK INTO OUR WORKERS.

1565
01:12:12,821 --> 01:12:14,781
I THINK WE JUMPSTART
THE MIDDLE CLASS,

1566
01:12:14,781 --> 01:12:16,993
AND I THINK HAVE POLICIES
IN PLACE

1567
01:12:16,993 --> 01:12:19,035
THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE
MANUFACTURING BACK HERE

1568
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:22,289
TO PUT THOSE GOOD JOBS
IN PLACE HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES.

1569
01:12:22,289 --> 01:12:26,084
BUT EVEN IF WE ULTIMATELY SOLVE
OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS,

1570
01:12:26,084 --> 01:12:29,087
THERE WILL STILL BE VERY
DIFFICULT CHALLENGES AHEAD

1571
01:12:29,087 --> 01:12:31,339
IN THE U.S.-CHINA
RELATIONSHIP.

1572
01:12:31,339 --> 01:12:32,632
IF TENSIONS DO RISE,

1573
01:12:32,632 --> 01:12:35,177
WE MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS--

1574
01:12:35,177 --> 01:12:38,431
THERE'S A REAL DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE CHINESE PEOPLE
AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.

1575
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:41,516
MOST OF THE CRITICISMS
THAT WE HAVE ARE OF
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT,

1576
01:12:41,516 --> 01:12:43,644
THE ACTIONS THAT THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN

1577
01:12:43,644 --> 01:12:45,270
WITH RESPECT TO TRADE POLICY

1578
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,689
AND WORKER RIGHTS REPRESSION,

1579
01:12:46,689 --> 01:12:48,190
AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE SUFFER

1580
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,578
FROM A LOT OF
THOSE SAME POLICIES.

1581
01:13:00,578 --> 01:13:03,873
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND
CHINA BETTER.

1582
01:13:03,873 --> 01:13:07,584
WE HAVE THIS SORT OF
GLOWY VIEW OF THE TRAJECTORY
OF CHINA'S HISTORY,

1583
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:09,128
BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN,

1584
01:13:09,128 --> 01:13:11,506
ESPECIALLY OVER
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS,

1585
01:13:11,506 --> 01:13:14,550
IS A CHINA THAT IS MOVING
IN THE WRONG DIRECTIONS
ON EVERYTHING.

1586
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,052
AND IT'S NOT JUST
HUMAN RIGHTS.

1587
01:13:16,052 --> 01:13:18,178
IT'S ITS RELATIONS
WITH ITS NEIGHBORS,

1588
01:13:18,178 --> 01:13:20,306
ITS ECONOMY, YOU NAME IT.

1589
01:13:20,306 --> 01:13:23,517
THIS IS A COUNTRY
THAT IS GOING BACKWARDS
IN ALL PHASES.

1590
01:13:23,517 --> 01:13:26,561
I HEAR PEOPLE
REFERRING TO THE PRC
OR THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC.

1591
01:13:26,561 --> 01:13:28,189
WELL, LET'S BE HONEST.

1592
01:13:28,189 --> 01:13:30,149
AS SOON AS WE ACCEPT THAT
PHRASE,

1593
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:32,318
WE'RE JOINING CHINA
IN THEIR REALITY DISTORTION
FIELD.

1594
01:13:32,318 --> 01:13:34,110
IT'S A LIE.

1595
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,613
IT IS NOT THE PEOPLE'S,
AND IT IS NOT THE REPUBLIC.

1596
01:13:35,613 --> 01:13:37,698
STOP SAYING THAT.
IT'S COMMUNIST CHINA.

1597
01:13:37,698 --> 01:13:40,409
WE'VE GOT TO SPREAD THE WORD
THAT THERE'S DANGER OUT THERE,

1598
01:13:40,409 --> 01:13:42,619
AND WE NEED TO CHANGE
OUR POLICIES.

1599
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:47,667
WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD
TO TREAT A COMMUNIST
DICTATORSHIP IN CHINA

1600
01:13:47,667 --> 01:13:52,046
AS WE WOULD TREAT ANY
OTHER DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION,

1601
01:13:52,046 --> 01:13:56,217
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TREATED US
LIKE FOOLS FOR DOING THAT,

1602
01:13:56,217 --> 01:13:58,368
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
WE HAVE BEEN FOOLS.

1603
01:15:45,368 --> 01:15:47,537
? LOOK AROUND ?

1604
01:15:47,537 --> 01:15:49,542
? TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE ?

1605
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:57,757
? EVERY DAY MORE PEOPLE
IN THE STREET ?

1606
01:15:59,757 --> 01:16:03,931
? SAID I USED TO WORK
IN A FACTORY ?

1607
01:16:06,931 --> 01:16:11,770
? RIGHT NOW I'D WORK
FOR ANYTHING ?

1608
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:15,275
? OH-OH-OH-OH ?

1609
01:16:17,275 --> 01:16:19,195
? OH-OH-OH-OH ?

1610
01:16:21,195 --> 01:16:22,865
? OH-OH-OH-OH ?

1611
01:16:24,865 --> 01:16:27,160
? OH-OH-OH-OH ?

1612
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,912
? IT'S NOT ME ?

1613
01:16:29,912 --> 01:16:35,376
? BUT MY FAMILY
I WISH TO FEED ?

1614
01:16:35,376 --> 01:16:37,628
? NOT MUCH ?

1615
01:16:37,628 --> 01:16:42,341
? WE GOT SIMPLE NEEDS ?

1616
01:16:42,341 --> 01:16:44,552
? TOO BAD ?

1617
01:16:44,552 --> 01:16:49,431
? THEY SENT OUR JOBS AWAY ?

1618
01:16:49,431 --> 01:16:54,271
? IN CHINA
THEY'RE NOT WORKERS,
THEY'RE JUST SLAVES ?

1619
01:16:56,271 --> 01:16:58,065
? PEOPLE, WAKE ?

1620
01:16:58,065 --> 01:17:03,320
? IT'S A WORLD
OF TRADE AND GREED ?

1621
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,199
? AND THE CEOs GET RICHER ?

1622
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,369
? AND OUR JOBS
ALL MOVE OFF SHORE ?

1623
01:17:10,369 --> 01:17:13,663
? OH-OH-OH-OH ?

1624
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:17,543
? OH-OH-OH-OH ?

1625
01:17:17,543 --> 01:17:20,962
? OH-OH-OH-OH ?

1626
01:17:20,962 --> 01:17:24,132
? OH-OH-OH-OH ?

1627
01:17:24,132 --> 01:17:26,843
? MY OLDEST SON ?

1628
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:31,598
? HE GOT A COLLEGE DEGREE ?

1629
01:17:31,598 --> 01:17:33,601
? HE DREAMED ?

1630
01:17:33,601 --> 01:17:38,605
? OF RUNNING A FACTORY ?

1631
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:41,525
? NOW HE'S BACK HOME ?

1632
01:17:41,525 --> 01:17:45,488
? JUST LIVING WITH ME ?

1633
01:17:45,488 --> 01:17:52,119
? AND THERE'S NO BRIGHT FUTURE
MY BOY CAN SEE ?

1634
01:17:52,119 --> 01:17:53,830
? SIXTEEN HOURS ?

1635
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:59,459
? SEVEN DAYS A WEEK ?

1636
01:17:59,459 --> 01:18:01,753
? OF UNIONS ?

1637
01:18:01,753 --> 01:18:06,300
? AND FREEDOMS
THEY CANNOT SPEAK ?

1638
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,761
? GOTTA RISE ?

1639
01:18:08,761 --> 01:18:13,431
? GET UP OFF YOUR KNEES ?

1640
01:18:13,431 --> 01:18:16,519
? BEFORE THEY BUY UP ?

1641
01:18:16,519 --> 01:18:23,904
? ALL OUR DREAMS ?

1642
01:18:26,904 --> 01:18:33,703
? WE GO TO THE STORE
AND SPEND OUR MONEY ?

1643
01:18:33,703 --> 01:18:40,584
? SEND ALL OUR
DOLLARS OVERSEAS ?

1644
01:18:40,584 --> 01:18:47,341
? THIS AIN'T THE LAND
OF MILK AND HONEY ?

1645
01:18:47,341 --> 01:18:54,140
? THIS IS THE LAND
OF TRADE AND GREED ?

1646
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:59,812
? WE GO TO THE STORE
AND SPEND OUR MONEY ?

1647
01:19:00,812 --> 01:19:07,653
? SEND ALL OUR DOLLARS
OVERSEAS ?

1648
01:19:07,653 --> 01:19:14,452
? THIS AIN'T THE LAND
OF MILK AND HONEY ?

1649
01:19:14,452 --> 01:19:16,037
? THIS IS THE LAND ?

1650
01:19:16,037 --> 01:19:23,217
? OF TRADE AND GREED ?

1651
01:19:29,217 --> 01:19:32,887
AND THIS WHOLE NOTION
THAT WHAT'S GOOD FOR
MULTINATIONALS

1652
01:19:32,887 --> 01:19:34,137
IS GOOD FOR AMERICA,

1653
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:35,149
THAT'S COMPLETELY WRONG.
