1
00:00:01,365 --> 00:00:04,198
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:18,296
(upbeat music)

3
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:37,919
- Open call, buxom French maid.

4
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:41,397
- Come on now, put that thing away.

5
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:43,777
We already talked about this.

6
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:48,122
We're not goin' on any
auditions until we get settled.

7
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:48,955
Come on.

8
00:01:56,624 --> 00:02:00,359
- Five foot eight Southern temptress.

9
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,511
- Assuming you could play a temptress,

10
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:03,557
you think they'll let you do a whole play

11
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,304
standing on a phone book?

12
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:08,471
- Somebody's cranky today.

13
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,825
Oh, hi.

14
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:33,894
- If it isn't the actors from Iowa.

15
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:35,602
- Audrey, you look beautiful.

16
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:36,748
- Thank you, darling.

17
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:38,472
How's the apartment search going?

18
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:40,013
- Great.
- It's crappy.

19
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:42,586
- Ollie, these are my
neighbors, Holly and Calvin.

20
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:46,145
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

21
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:47,875
- He doesn't speak English.

22
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,401
We're going to dinner
at 21, and then we're

23
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,767
going to see, um,

24
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,798
what are we seeing?

25
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,531
Look who I'm asking.

26
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:56,168
Cirque de Soleil.

27
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:58,728
- Sounds like French.

28
00:02:58,728 --> 00:02:59,561
- See ya later.

29
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,728
Hey, cheer up.

30
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,699
Life's too short to be unhappy.

31
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,936
(cat meowing)

32
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:16,913
- Oh, did I ever tell you about the time

33
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:20,737
I auditioned as a waitress
on General Hospital?

34
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:22,892
- Uh, yeah, actually,
yesterday we talked--

35
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:25,423
- They told me I was too meaty.

36
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:27,840
That I had to lose 20 pounds.

37
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,783
- Oh, Agatha, you really
shouldn't take those.

38
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:32,928
They're bad for your heart.

39
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:34,626
- That's what the doctors tell you,

40
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,014
because they don't want
you to be as skinny

41
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:38,347
as their little bitch wives.

42
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:41,982
- Um, we were thinking,

43
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,816
you've been so generous.

44
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:47,472
We would like to help with the rent.

45
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:49,476
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

46
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,143
I wouldn't think of it.

47
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:55,206
What kind of an aunt would I
be if I didn't take you in?

48
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:59,373
Ooh, look at that face,
that beautiful little face.

49
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:04,239
You remind me of me when I was your age,

50
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:07,725
only thinner.

51
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:13,444
- Lana is pregnant again.

52
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,416
Her husband, Billy Fred, just got promoted

53
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:19,436
at the rendering plant, and
the timing couldn't be better.

54
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:21,435
Your brother Samuel just signed the lease

55
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:24,571
for another 30 acres of bean-growing land.

56
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:27,015
When you're done with your
little New York adventure,

57
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,839
he'll certainly have a place for you

58
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,250
supervising the pickers.

59
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,835
Mom.

60
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,980
- I got that beat.

61
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,612
Hey, cabbage-for-brains, this here manure

62
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,609
ain't shovelin' itself, so why don't you

63
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:42,121
come back and get to it?

64
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:43,567
Dad.

65
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:46,083
- Was our world ever really that small?

66
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,849
- Aw, they just want what's best for us.

67
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,297
- No, they want us to
be exactly like them,

68
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:50,592
and it ain't gonna happen.

69
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:51,425
- It ain't gonna happen.

70
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,308
- No, we're gonna be actors.

71
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:53,141
- We're gonna be actors.

72
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:54,417
- We're gonna make something of our lives.

73
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:55,761
- Yes, we're gonna make
something of our lives.

74
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,232
- We're gonna take risks and think big.

75
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:58,467
- We're gonna think big, and we're gonna--

76
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,559
(cat screeching)

77
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,559
- Holy crap!

78
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:04,442
We're gonna find an apartment.

79
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:09,600
(lively music)

80
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:14,627
- My first New York apartment
was a loft in Chinatown.

81
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:17,130
It was right above a cockfighting ring.

82
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,450
I'd see these giant roosters going in

83
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,678
and little McNuggets coming out.

84
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:22,937
- Well, how did you find this place?

85
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:23,857
- I cheated.

86
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:26,161
I'm a building inspector for the city.

87
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:28,937
One day, I was failing a
landlord for 100-year-old

88
00:06:28,937 --> 00:06:30,867
pipes, and he offered me a deal.

89
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:33,646
I overlooked the rust soup
that passes for tap water,

90
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:36,520
and he cuts me a break on my two bedroom.

91
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,850
Or should I say our two bedroom?

92
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,933
- You should.

93
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:45,433
- Uh, Claire, it says here
some minor chores are required.

94
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,095
- Oh, I hate that word chores.

95
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,958
It always makes me think of work.

96
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,991
I'd really rather think
of these jobs as pleasure.

97
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:53,972
- Pleasure?

98
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:56,420
- Yes, did you know that pleasure is

99
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,745
very closely linked with pain?

100
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:03,097
Just a fragile line waiting to be crossed.

101
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:05,428
You didn't know that.

102
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:06,345
Or did you?

103
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:21,735
- Nine, please.

104
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:25,459
What ya readin'?

105
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:26,292
- Me?

106
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,709
Oh, it's nothing.

107
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,357
- Oh, The Temptation of Angel!

108
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:31,941
I love this book!

109
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,428
- Yeah, some lady, she lives here,

110
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:35,549
and she left it in the elevator,

111
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:36,799
and I was just hanging onto it for her.

112
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:39,141
- Did you get to the part
where her lover dies?

113
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:39,974
- He what?

114
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:41,886
- Nothing.

115
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:45,907
- He jumped down the
mine shaft, didn't he?

116
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:48,546
- No, I mean, yes, but he's fine.

117
00:07:48,546 --> 00:07:49,662
He just breaks his fibula.

118
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:51,845
- God, that is horrible.

119
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:54,121
- Um, I'm Holly, and this is Calvin.

120
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:55,282
- Hi, I'm Dennis.

121
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:56,217
- Well, see ya around.

122
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:57,050
- Okay.

123
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:00,921
- [Calvin] Enjoy the book.

124
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,160
- How are you feeling?

125
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,493
Curiously itchy?

126
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:08,694
- No.

127
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:11,628
- (coughing) How about
in the arms and legs,

128
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:12,461
a little maybe?

129
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:13,646
- No.

130
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:14,553
- Can I get a lock of your hair?

131
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:15,551
- No, stop it.

132
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:16,384
- Okay.

133
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,884
Who are you?

134
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:20,942
- I'm Holly, who are you?

135
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:23,144
- This is Vincent, the building manager.

136
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:25,096
- And the son of the owner, so don't try

137
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:27,188
to get me fired.

138
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:28,206
- Okay then.

139
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,521
- Honey, could you go
in the kitchen and get

140
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:31,982
Vincent his check so he can go?

141
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:32,815
- Sure.

142
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:57,086
Here you go.

143
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:57,992
Cat's in the garbage again.

144
00:08:57,992 --> 00:08:59,159
- Ugh, Richie!

145
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,041
I'm gonna ring your neck!

146
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,931
- Can I have a lock of your hair?

147
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,848
- Sorry, I don't have any to spare.

148
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,072
Bye.

149
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,187
- Freaky kids.

150
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:24,790
- She pays less than a studio.

151
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,188
How is that possible?

152
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:27,991
- She's lived here over 40 years.

153
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:31,506
Rent control is a beautiful thing.

154
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:32,549
Don't worry.

155
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:35,382
Tomorrow we'll find our own place.

156
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:39,839
And everything will be fine.

157
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:05,207
Nothing.

158
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:13,976
Nothing.

159
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:21,935
Frightening.

160
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:28,817
- Come here.

161
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,613
- Hi.

162
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,289
What's wrong?

163
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,939
- What's wrong?

164
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:54,272
Well, no money, no apartment, no future.

165
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:57,840
- Then you could use some good news.

166
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,399
You see, I was at the gym this morning,

167
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,324
doing pilates with my trainer Johan,

168
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:04,533
and I overheard these two girls
talking on the Stairmaster.

169
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:08,700
One of them mentioned she had
an audition today, open call.

170
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,232
- What's the role?

171
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:13,594
- Midwestern farm girl, five three.

172
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:14,427
- Really?

173
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:17,220
- I thought you'd feel
that way, so while they

174
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,780
were at the juice bar,
I liberated their paper.

175
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,764
- This is at three o'clock.

176
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,597
I could still make it.

177
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,221
We decided we're not
going on any auditions

178
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,971
until we get settled.

179
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:38,462
- Go to the audition.

180
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:39,358
- You think?

181
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:41,605
- Yeah, have a good time.

182
00:11:41,605 --> 00:11:42,695
- You're not coming?

183
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:46,895
- No, I gotta drop off
these job applications.

184
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:49,519
- But it's my first New York audition.

185
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,936
I can't go alone.

186
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,719
(upbeat music)

187
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:55,950
This was a bad idea.

188
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,783
I look terrible!

189
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,104
- You look lovely.

190
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,335
- I don't even have head shots.

191
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:01,085
What am I doing here?

192
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,986
- Lean over for me.

193
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:07,394
It'll do.

194
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,342
Remember, lean forward at least twice.

195
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:14,291
Once to fix your shoe,
once to borrow a pen.

196
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:18,112
Make eye contact, gently
bite your bottom lip,

197
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,945
not your top, play with your hair.

198
00:12:21,794 --> 00:12:23,595
- Ungh, this isn't working for me.

199
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,366
- Darling, this is the Big Apple.

200
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:29,033
If you don't take a
bite, someone else will.

201
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,044
- Thank you, Chuck.

202
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:56,461
Bye, Uncle Billy.

203
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,405
Good luck.

204
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:07,241
- I have to go.

205
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,960
(Holly crying)

206
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:19,507
- What happened?

207
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,340
- Nothing!

208
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,288
You scared me!

209
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:25,092
- You're crying because I scared you?

210
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:27,706
- Why are you in the hallway?

211
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,289
- Nobody's home, I lost my key.

212
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:48,997
Guess the audition went poorly?

213
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,776
- What if I made a mistake?

214
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:52,820
What if I don't belong here?

215
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,202
What if my mother was right,
and this is just my little

216
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:58,307
adventure before I settle
down in some bean field!

217
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:01,030
And what happened to all the cats?

218
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,769
- What was the first question again?

219
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:04,062
- The cats?

220
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:05,456
They're gone!

221
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:06,452
- Who cares?

222
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:07,817
- Usually you can't
take a step around here

223
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:10,567
without crushing something's paw!

224
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:14,828
They're not there!

225
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:17,021
- Well, maybe Agatha took 'em for a walk.

226
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:19,771
- You don't take cats for a walk!

227
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,169
Agatha!

228
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,329
Agatha!

229
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:26,732
Can you hear me?

230
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,004
Agatha!

231
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:28,837
Wake up!

232
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:32,131
- I think she's dead.

233
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:33,061
- Is she breathing?

234
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:34,608
- Yeah, she's breathing, and she's dead.

235
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:35,441
- No!

236
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,274
No!

237
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:37,107
Agatha!

238
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:37,940
Wake up!

239
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,268
- Don't, Hol, don't, you're
only gonna make it worse.

240
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:40,758
- How can I make dead worse?

241
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:42,448
- She's ice cold.

242
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,821
- Agatha, hold on, we're gonna get help!

243
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:47,321
Where's the phone?

244
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,380
Where's the goddamn phone?

245
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,221
- In the bedroom.

246
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:58,609
- I don't see it!

247
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:00,109
- Look by the bed.

248
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:18,981
What the hell?

249
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:45,598
Let's say we call an ambulance.

250
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:48,000
The whole building will
find out she's dead, right?

251
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,006
We'll be out on the street.

252
00:15:50,006 --> 00:15:52,955
How long after that till
we're back in Pottsville?

253
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:54,914
Well, I'm not goin' back to Pottsville.

254
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:56,074
Not now!

255
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:59,657
Not when I blew chunks
at my only audition.

256
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:02,853
You're not sold on the idea.

257
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:04,353
You have concerns.

258
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:06,336
Don't worry.

259
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:08,282
We're not gonna hide her in
the apartment for six months.

260
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:09,593
I mean, there were two
Weekend at Bernie's.

261
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,572
No one wants another.

262
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,383
- That's a relief.

263
00:16:12,383 --> 00:16:13,845
- We'll just sneak her
out of the building,

264
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:15,411
and take her to the hospital.

265
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,244
- Excuse me?

266
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:18,278
- We'll carry her in, tell
'em she died in the car,

267
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,849
and then we just fill out some forms,

268
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:21,857
call up my dad, and
the rest writes itself.

269
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,064
- What if someone asks about her?

270
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,007
- She's on vacation.

271
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,532
- What if the hospital reports it?

272
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:26,797
- The only person they report it to is her

273
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:28,517
next of kin, me.

274
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:32,184
- I'm not goin' to
prison over an apartment.

275
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,876
- If we don't do this,
then everything they said

276
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:48,093
about us was true.

277
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:50,699
We're just hicks on a
little New York adventure,

278
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,444
and that's all we'll ever
be for the rest of our

279
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:58,361
manure-shoveling,
bean-picking, pathetic lives!

280
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,816
If that's not prison,

281
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:08,584
I don't know what is.

282
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:17,241
- You don't think this is
a little Jeffrey Dahmer?

283
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:21,408
- We have to get her to
the car without being seen.

284
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:27,853
- Holly, you might try pushing.

285
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:30,020
- Calvin, you can help me!

286
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:36,230
- My knight in shining glasses.

287
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,312
What happened to yu?

288
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:38,415
You ran off so fast.

289
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:39,415
- Oh, sorry.

290
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:42,018
I had an emergency.

291
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:42,937
- I figured.

292
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,781
I followed the trail you left.

293
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:46,999
You guys know Dennis?

294
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,499
- Uh yes, sort of.

295
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:51,621
- Last week, I lost my favorite ring.

296
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:53,564
I threw it in the garbage by mistake,

297
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:55,094
and Dennis went through
the entire building's

298
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:56,679
trash until he found it.

299
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,407
- It was really no big deal, I swear.

300
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:03,134
I mean, it was kinda smelly and dirty.

301
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:04,667
- What's in the chest?

302
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,539
- Just clothes.

303
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,757
- Boy, Hol, we really gotta get goin'.

304
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:11,090
- Okay, after one more kiss.

305
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,492
Bye.

306
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,325
See ya later.
- See ya.

307
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:20,557
Dennis, Dennis, we really gotta get going.

308
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,390
- Okay.

309
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:24,490
Going down?
- Yes, thanks.

310
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:40,235
You got some lipstick on your face.

311
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,068
- I know.

312
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:57,879
(trunk clattering)

313
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,773
(Dennis screaming)

314
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:08,523
- [Calvin] Come here.

315
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,584
(Dennis screaming)

316
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:44,550
- Dennis, this isn't what it looks like.

317
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,841
- I changed my mind, Hol, I don't want

318
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:47,496
the apartment any more.

319
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:49,702
- We'll be fine, just as
soon as Dennis calms down.

320
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:50,815
What are you doing?

321
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,575
- I'm holding his mouth
so he doesn't scream.

322
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:53,549
- His mouth, not his whole face!

323
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:55,507
He can't breathe!

324
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:56,340
- Oh.

325
00:19:58,915 --> 00:19:59,748
Sorry.

326
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:04,726
(tape ripping)

327
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:08,265
- Dennis, how are you feeling?

328
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:12,296
- Are you hurt?

329
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:19,969
(Dennis screaming)

330
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:20,938
- You had to put the body there.

331
00:20:20,938 --> 00:20:22,752
- Well, I didn't think he
was gonna wake up so soon.

332
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:23,665
- We're trying to calm him down,

333
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:24,829
not give him a stroke!
- I'm sorry I'm not

334
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:28,162
as versed as you in dead body etiquette.

335
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:31,470
What?

336
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:35,334
- Take the tape off.

337
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,988
- No, he's gonna scream.

338
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:39,636
- Dennis, if we take the tape off,

339
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:41,076
do you promise not to scream?

340
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:43,993
- Uh huh. (crying)

341
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:47,856
- I know what this must look like.

342
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:49,333
- You're gonna kill me.

343
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,338
- We're not gonna kill you.

344
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:52,990
- You're gonna put me
in a box with Agatha.

345
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,210
You don't have to, you don't have to,

346
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,460
because I can keep secrets.

347
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,126
My cousin Simon is gay,

348
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,727
and I've kept that secret all this time.

349
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:03,952
- Dennis, we're not--

350
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:05,335
- And the only reason that I even told you

351
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:09,231
about this secret is because,
I mean, I have secrets

352
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:10,452
I don't tell.

353
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:11,285
- Hey!

354
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:14,237
Shh, we're not gonna hurt you, okay?

355
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:16,237
- Then why am I tied up?

356
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,837
- Because you're not calm.

357
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:23,504
We'll untie you just
as soon as you're calm.

358
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:28,992
That's better, don't you think?

359
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:29,825
- I guess.

360
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:35,677
- And that's how she ended
up on the elevator floor

361
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:37,844
instead of at Mount Sinai.

362
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:41,761
- You don't believe us.

363
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,419
- It's the truth.

364
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:44,752
- I believe you.

365
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:48,074
I do, I believe you.

366
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:51,451
You needed an apartment, right?

367
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:55,194
Now, if you'll excuse me, I, um, I have

368
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,768
some reading that I need to do.

369
00:21:56,768 --> 00:21:57,908
- Forget it.

370
00:21:57,908 --> 00:21:58,858
You're not going anywhere.

371
00:21:58,858 --> 00:21:59,691
- Why?

372
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:00,524
- You're gonna call the police.

373
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:01,357
- No, I won't.
- Yeah.

374
00:22:01,357 --> 00:22:03,990
- Okay, okay, you're free to go.

375
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,823
- I am?

376
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,558
- Yeah, you know, we're all friends here.

377
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,828
We know you'll do what's right.

378
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:08,661
- [Dennis] I can leave?

379
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,771
- Certainly.
- Right now?

380
00:22:09,771 --> 00:22:10,938
- If you like.

381
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:15,714
Oh, wait, let me just fix your tie.

382
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:20,070
Audrey's always saying how
handsome you look in a tie.

383
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,153
- She, um, she said what?

384
00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:24,736
- Oh, no, that's wrong.

385
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:26,569
What word did she use?

386
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:28,855
Foxy.

387
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:31,085
- That's right, you guys are
friends with Audrey, aren't ya?

388
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:32,543
- Friends?

389
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:34,911
I've gotta tell Aud that.

390
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:36,471
Okay, well, you're all set.

391
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:38,294
Don't be a stranger.

392
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:41,877
- Um, hey, what else
does she say about me?

393
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:44,634
- Who?

394
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:45,643
- Audrey?

395
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:47,510
- I don't know, things.

396
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,830
But, well, you have to go.

397
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,580
- No, no, I've um, I
actually have some time.

398
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:57,690
- Oh, well, yesterday, she said you look

399
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,292
like a young Louis Gable.

400
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,941
- Really?

401
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,025
Who?

402
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:05,682
- Louis Gable, you know,
Clark Gable's younger brother.

403
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:07,875
I mean, they looked exactly alike except

404
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,767
Louis had glasses and bushy eyebrows.

405
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:11,708
- Wow.

406
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,283
- And that's just the beginning.

407
00:23:13,283 --> 00:23:16,871
I can't tell you this, I
mean, Aud would kill me.

408
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:17,788
- Go ahead.

409
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,670
We're all friends here, right?

410
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,411
Don't schedule that date
for me until Thursday,

411
00:23:25,411 --> 00:23:27,110
because I want to buy this
sport coat that I saw.

412
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,224
It has this tie that came with it.

413
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:31,090
Do you think this gap in
my teeth should be fixed?

414
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,601
It's really bothersome.

415
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:33,539
Do you think it's too big?

416
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,741
- You know what, we'll
take care of Agatha first,

417
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:36,548
then we'll deal with
the Audrey setup, okay?

418
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,798
- Okay.
- Okay.

419
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,388
- What if the janitor looks in the bin?

420
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,221
- He won't.

421
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,054
- How do you know?

422
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:45,338
- He won't, and even if he does,

423
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:49,505
she's in a sleeping bag,
so Rico won't even know it.

424
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:51,887
- Rico?

425
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:56,217
♫ I don't want to fight

426
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:00,910
♫ It's probably too late

427
00:24:01,864 --> 00:24:06,031
♫ How we gonna get back to love ♫

428
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:18,653
- This is not easy for me.

429
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,269
You know I have feelings for you.

430
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:24,269
I'd never deny that, but

431
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:30,702
Rico is no one woman's man.

432
00:24:32,977 --> 00:24:34,227
You understand?

433
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:38,305
Don't give me that look.

434
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,857
(doorbell buzzing)

435
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,945
What you want?

436
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:53,979
- Hi, Rico, it's Dennis,
from the elevator?

437
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:56,264
Look, we brought you trash.

438
00:24:56,264 --> 00:24:57,994
- Am I supposed to be happy?

439
00:24:57,994 --> 00:24:58,827
- Well--

440
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:00,345
- I'm supposed to jump like a toad

441
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:02,390
'cause you're bringing me trash?

442
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,751
Tomorrow I bring you trash.

443
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:05,882
I dump it on your head.

444
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:07,712
Then I will be happy.

445
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:08,996
Get out of my basement.

446
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:09,831
Go! Out!

447
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:10,957
- Should we?

448
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:12,557
- Please, leave the trash.

449
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:14,241
I love the trash.

450
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,324
I want to kiss the trash.

451
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,534
Where do I kiss it?

452
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:21,092
I love the trash.

453
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:22,842
I want to be with it.

454
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,274
(gentle music)

455
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:45,168
- Which one is ours?

456
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,248
- None of 'em, ours was gray.

457
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:48,593
- [Holly] Are you sure,
I thought ours was blue.

458
00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:50,646
- [Calvin] Positive, it was gray.

459
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:52,061
- Well, what's the difference?

460
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:54,306
- You know the difference
between blue and gray?

461
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:55,346
- What's the difference
between the gray ones

462
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,179
and the blue ones?

463
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,012
- There is no difference.

464
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:58,439
They all come out into the alley.

465
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,272
- Are you sure?

466
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:00,189
- I'm posi.

467
00:26:03,248 --> 00:26:05,998
(furnace firing)

468
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:14,884
- [Rico] What?

469
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:15,717
What?

470
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:20,112
- Rico, you remember the
trash bin that we gave you?

471
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,487
The one you were kissing?

472
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:24,654
Well, we had something valuable in it.

473
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,763
- It is available no more.

474
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:31,596
- Uh, Hol?

475
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,415
We got a problem.

476
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,740
- Well, I'm open to suggestions.

477
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:52,727
(organ music)

478
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:56,480
- Though the nature of
her death was tragic,

479
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,150
I believe Agatha would rather we focus

480
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,983
on her enjoyment of life,
her intrepid spirit.

481
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:07,077
That same spirit that
led her to go white water

482
00:27:07,077 --> 00:27:10,620
rafting with her beloved niece Holly

483
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,287
on that fateful day.

484
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:21,083
Thank you for coming.

485
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,583
Thank you so much.

486
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:27,738
It was a good turnout, I think.

487
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:31,108
Nice of the morticians to sit in.

488
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,700
- I'm glad you could make it, Daddy.

489
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
- Oh, honey.

490
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:39,212
How you holding up, sweetheart?

491
00:27:39,212 --> 00:27:40,629
- Better, thanks.

492
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:44,157
- Can we get you anything, Rose?

493
00:27:44,157 --> 00:27:46,239
- Maybe a glass of water.

494
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:47,822
- A glass of water.

495
00:27:49,992 --> 00:27:53,519
- My sister never ceased to amaze me,

496
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,525
but white water rafting,
that takes the cake.

497
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,097
- I'm so sorry.

498
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:00,578
- Oh, don't be, dear.

499
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,828
She died doing what she loved, I guess.

500
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,684
I just hope they find her body soon.

501
00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:10,379
(crying)

502
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:12,532
- They're gonna find it.

503
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:15,199
No, Rose, they're gonna find it.

504
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,502
- Gene!

505
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:24,625
- We'll make it, Rose.

506
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,153
We'll make it.

507
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:28,090
Now, this is a copy of
the death certificate.

508
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,371
Now, you show it to the landlord
when you cancel the lease.

509
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:33,619
Rose already took everything
of sentimental value,

510
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,614
so any money you can
get for the furniture,

511
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,197
whatever, you keep.

512
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:39,222
- Thank you.

513
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,529
- Are you gonna call your
mother one of these days?

514
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:47,590
- The phone works two ways, Daddy.

515
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,051
- You take care of her, okay?

516
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:50,304
- I'll try, sir.

517
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,471
It's not such an easy job.

518
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,433
(gentle music)

519
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:16,745
- This really works.

520
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:20,562
- Cleaned out the fridge,
top shelf, at least.

521
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:21,647
- Dennis, you're the best.

522
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:24,024
- Well, it's the least
I could do considering

523
00:29:24,024 --> 00:29:25,503
I incinerated your aunt, and you're still

524
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:28,442
hooking me up with Audrey, right?

525
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:29,859
- Um, about that.

526
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,024
- You are still hooking
me up with Audrey, right?

527
00:29:33,024 --> 00:29:33,963
- Of course.

528
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:36,963
We just, you know, well, uh, Calvin?

529
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:44,014
- Did you guys know that
Clark Gable has a website?

530
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:44,847
- You don't say.

531
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:45,934
- Yeah, he does.

532
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:47,785
He's also got 26 fan
clubs, a museum in Ohio

533
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:50,537
and three tax deductible
charitable foundations.

534
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:51,765
- Oh.

535
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:53,521
- The only thing he doesn't have

536
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:56,165
is a bushy-eyebrowed,
glasses-wearing brother named Louis!

537
00:29:56,165 --> 00:29:57,998
- It was Holly's idea.

538
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:00,116
- Sorry.

539
00:30:00,116 --> 00:30:02,041
If it's any consolation, we still intend

540
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,708
to stick to our end of the deal.

541
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:07,968
- That's what I thought.

542
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:11,968
Let's just be happy this
whole thing's finished.

543
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:19,317
- Serious Holly, playful Holly.

544
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,772
- I think they're both great,

545
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:22,518
but you realize we just spent two weeks

546
00:30:22,518 --> 00:30:25,475
salary, and we haven't
even started work yet.

547
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:28,058
- Playful Holly, serious Holly.

548
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:34,278
(strings music)

549
00:30:40,192 --> 00:30:44,359
♫ Summer nights in Sag Harbor Bay ♫

550
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,090
- Why are you still here?

551
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,976
- We're staying in Agatha
Washburn's apartment

552
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:03,039
while she's on vacation.

553
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,395
- Come again?

554
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,467
- Well, Agatha went to Iowa
to visit her sister Rose,

555
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:10,134
so we're watching the
place while she's gone.

556
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,384
(laughing)

557
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,877
- Why is that funny?

558
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,840
- Agatha on vacation?

559
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,143
The only time she leaves the apartment

560
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:22,575
is to buy another cat.

561
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:26,741
Come on, you better try and do
better than that, all right?

562
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:28,241
- Is this a tooth?

563
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:33,841
- Yeah, it's an ancient
Sumarian tiger tooth.

564
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,613
- It's very attractive.

565
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:43,125
- I don't wear it for the style.

566
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:47,236
I wear it for the unholy
evil that it unleashes.

567
00:31:47,236 --> 00:31:50,903
- When rent comes around, just come to me.

568
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:53,320
I'll take care of everything.

569
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:01,150
Are you coming, sweet potato?

570
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:08,401
Bye, Vincent, nice slippers.

571
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:19,785
- What the hell was that?

572
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:20,652
- What was what?

573
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:24,574
- All that come to me, I'll
take care of everything?

574
00:32:24,574 --> 00:32:27,641
- Relax, I was just helping our cause.

575
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:28,860
You're kinda cute when you're jealous.

576
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,168
- I'm not jealous.

577
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:31,335
I'm surprised.

578
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:36,751
(sexy music)

579
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,997
- Surprise.

580
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:54,182
(knocking)

581
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,265
- Goddamn it!

582
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,241
- Take your pants off.

583
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:01,491
I'll be right in to supervise the rest.

584
00:33:08,997 --> 00:33:10,478
Vincent.

585
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:13,228
- Hey, I was in the neighborhood.

586
00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:16,909
- What can I do for you?

587
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:18,730
- I wanted to know if maybe you wanted to

588
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,230
swing by my apartment and see my cauldron.

589
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:27,995
- I'd love to, but I can't.

590
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:32,162
We're having a cocktail party,
and I have to get dressed.

591
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,384
- What time should I be here?

592
00:33:35,384 --> 00:33:38,120
- Oh, well, it's just a tiny thing,

593
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,068
and we probably don't have
another place setting,

594
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:41,651
but you understand.

595
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:46,306
- You redecorated.

596
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,458
- Yeah, you like?

597
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:55,618
- Oh, I like, country girl, I like.

598
00:33:57,612 --> 00:34:00,089
- Okay, well, I'll see you later.

599
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:01,896
- Wait, I just.

600
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:02,729
Ow.

601
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:07,485
- Country girl?

602
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,414
- What happened to all the cats?

603
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,536
(lively music)

604
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,939
♫ Chasing down a rainbow

605
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:33,863
♫ Don't know where it's leading to ♫

606
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,841
- Good evening, my dear.

607
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:37,226
♫ Got to follow that rainbow

608
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:41,393
♫ To a place where dreams can come true ♫

609
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:45,938
(knocking)

610
00:34:45,938 --> 00:34:47,688
- Come in, it's open.

611
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,384
- Am I too early?

612
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:53,156
- No, man, you're right on time.

613
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:54,606
Hope you don't have to
use the restroom, though,

614
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:57,874
the girls have been in
there for over two hours!

615
00:34:57,874 --> 00:35:01,286
- Perfection takes time, darling.

616
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:02,286
Look at you.

617
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:09,338
You look so handsome and scholarly.

618
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:11,024
- I brought pastries.

619
00:35:11,024 --> 00:35:12,709
- So you did.

620
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:13,826
(throat clearing)

621
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:15,371
Oh, I almost forgot.

622
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:17,783
Attention, please, presenting the future

623
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,409
Academy Award winner for Best Actress,

624
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,721
the toast of New York, Los Angeles

625
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:26,388
and the Iowa bean fields,
Miss Holly Hewitt.

626
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,025
- Holly who?

627
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:31,608
(dreamy music)

628
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:35,484
- What do you think?

629
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:37,597
Do you like it?

630
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:42,141
- You look so...

631
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,809
Different.

632
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,142
- I have a gift.

633
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:49,804
- Dennis, you look so handsome.

634
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:53,143
- I brought pastries.

635
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:54,809
- So you did.

636
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:55,760
(piano music)

637
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,649
- Some more wine, my dear?

638
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:58,482
No?

639
00:36:00,073 --> 00:36:04,141
You know, the moon on your
pupils are like pearls

640
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:08,058
on the ocean, even though
your eyes are closed.

641
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:12,980
Just a little?

642
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,897
Just a little, come on.

643
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,367
Pierce your lips.

644
00:36:24,545 --> 00:36:26,132
- No, me, no, thanks.

645
00:36:26,132 --> 00:36:27,242
- Dennis, you're not drinking?

646
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:29,716
- No, I have a low tolerance.

647
00:36:29,716 --> 00:36:31,343
Or I have a no tolerance, really.

648
00:36:31,343 --> 00:36:33,176
I'm like a bubble boy.

649
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,333
- Why Hewitt?

650
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,865
- Because Holly Hepburn
would raise eyebrows.

651
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,354
So Dennis, tell us why you
became an elevator boy.

652
00:36:44,354 --> 00:36:46,230
- Well, I'm just earning money, really,

653
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,267
right now, while I go to school.

654
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:50,638
I'm getting my master's at NYU.

655
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:51,740
- Really, in what?

656
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,666
- Speech pathology?

657
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,388
- Why speech pathology?

658
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:57,597
- Well, it's a long story,
but when I was a kid,

659
00:36:57,597 --> 00:36:59,516
I had a lisp, a whistle and a stutter

660
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:01,229
all at the same time, and when I spoke,

661
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:03,562
it sounded like a junk band.

662
00:37:09,114 --> 00:37:12,031
- What? (coughing)

663
00:37:18,378 --> 00:37:20,504
(romantic music)

664
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:25,169
♫ Once the skies were always blue

665
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:28,919
♫ Somehow we made it through

666
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:34,963
♫ And you could rely

667
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:38,410
♫ On storm clouds passing by

668
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,660
♫ Yes, I remember when

669
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:50,492
♫ We were happy to pretend

670
00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:55,612
♫ Good times would never end

671
00:37:58,506 --> 00:38:01,745
♫ Together we would share

672
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:05,004
♫ For all in love is fair

673
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:08,730
♫ Yes, I remember where ♫

674
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,995
- It's picture time.

675
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:11,912
Say cheese.

676
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:15,898
- [Audrey] You're puttin' me on.

677
00:38:15,898 --> 00:38:17,231
- I kid you not.

678
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:20,407
I never dated anyone other than Holly.

679
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:22,209
We met each other in second grade,

680
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:24,345
and then by third grade,
we became friends.

681
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:27,563
By sixth grade, we were
datin', and 10th grade

682
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:29,846
we were practically married.

683
00:38:29,846 --> 00:38:31,942
- I was married.

684
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:32,775
- What?

685
00:38:32,775 --> 00:38:36,461
- Yeah, at 21, to my
high school sweetheart.

686
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:37,579
- Are you still?

687
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:38,412
- No, no.

688
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,218
I loved him, though.

689
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:43,724
I even took a waitressing job to put him

690
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:45,980
through law school.

691
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,378
Then he dropped out and started drinking.

692
00:38:48,378 --> 00:38:49,982
Then one night, he decided to put my face

693
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:52,753
through a plate-glass window,

694
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:55,645
and that's when I decided,
it's all about me.

695
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:58,895
So I came to New York and started over.

696
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,889
- Where are you from?

697
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,889
- Why, Paducah, Kentucky, naturally.

698
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:07,095
- [Holly] Calvin, where's
that picture of you

699
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,892
in Pirates of Penzance?

700
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:09,993
- Which one?

701
00:39:09,993 --> 00:39:12,986
- [Holly] The one with the bulging crotch.

702
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:14,599
- Oh.

703
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,182
I'll be right back.

704
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:24,512
Lookin' hard, huh?

705
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:27,150
- Have a seat, darling, let's give

706
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,650
the lovebirds some time alone.

707
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:36,201
- I'm sorry about your face.

708
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:40,650
- What do you think my mother would say

709
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,150
if she could see me like this?

710
00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:47,529
- Probably that she hardly recognizes you.

711
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:55,425
- I need a drink.

712
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:05,524
♫ I've got my rainbow wrapped around you

713
00:40:05,524 --> 00:40:09,077
♫ My rainbow's wrapped around you

714
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:13,782
♫ My rainbow's wrapped around you

715
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:17,199
♫ You ♫

716
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:22,363
- Do you think Dennis is okay?

717
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:23,863
- Yeah, he's fine.

718
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:30,862
- Ugh, ugh.

719
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,635
- I should get going.

720
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:39,251
- I'll walk you to the door.

721
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:41,418
- I love you, toilet bowl.

722
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,347
You are my best friend.

723
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,932
- Tell Holly I had a blast, okay?

724
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:54,421
- Holly Washburn or Holly Hewitt?

725
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:57,562
- People change, you can't stop that.

726
00:40:57,562 --> 00:41:00,729
- Yeah, well, what if I don't keep up?

727
00:41:04,234 --> 00:41:05,151
- You will.

728
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:07,973
Good night.

729
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:13,859
Cheer up.

730
00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:17,362
Life's too short to be unhappy.

731
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:28,236
(lively music)

732
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:56,739
(phone ringing)

733
00:41:57,892 --> 00:42:00,022
- Are you kidding?

734
00:42:00,022 --> 00:42:01,022
Bring it on.

735
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:05,952
Oh, if it isn't the family shame.

736
00:42:05,952 --> 00:42:08,202
- Well, if it isn't, Peter.

737
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:14,412
- Good one, and they call
you the stupid offspring.

738
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:15,927
- I need to look at
the tenant files, okay?

739
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:18,129
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
let me think about that

740
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:20,167
for a second, uh, no.

741
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:22,066
I have explicit instructions
from your father

742
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:24,030
not to let you touch anything.

743
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:24,863
- Why?

744
00:42:24,863 --> 00:42:25,986
- Why, you ask, genius?

745
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:28,569
Because you nearly got him thrown in jail!

746
00:42:28,569 --> 00:42:29,806
- See, that was an accident.

747
00:42:29,806 --> 00:42:33,273
- 20 dead rabbits on an
altar is not an accident.

748
00:42:33,273 --> 00:42:35,986
However, it does make
for a very interesting

749
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,382
building inspection,
and speaking of building

750
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:39,339
inspections, tomorrow--

751
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:40,903
- I know, I'm taking care of it!

752
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:43,232
- You think you can get rid
of the bunnies by tomorrow?

753
00:42:43,232 --> 00:42:45,046
- Let me see the files!

754
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:48,875
- Okay, what part of un-un
don't you understand?

755
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:49,708
Back off.

756
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:53,736
- Okay, I see how this is going.

757
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:54,819
- Oh do you?
- Yeah, so let me

758
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:55,769
tell you something.

759
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:58,998
I got another trick up my sleeve.

760
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:00,165
- I'm nervous.

761
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,932
Thank God the freak is gone.

762
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:12,600
- Let me see the files!

763
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,017
- Get off of me, you mad cow.

764
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:21,433
You Shamoo.

765
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,050
You are a prehistoric primate.

766
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:27,556
You are a retard.

767
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,707
You uncouth man.

768
00:43:36,062 --> 00:43:37,562
You can't have it!

769
00:43:40,044 --> 00:43:41,711
- Get off me, bitch.

770
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:44,714
Yah, ah!

771
00:43:47,551 --> 00:43:49,131
I thank you.

772
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:49,964
See ya!

773
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:53,844
- What, give me some ice!

774
00:44:02,786 --> 00:44:04,119
- How do I look?

775
00:44:05,191 --> 00:44:06,361
- Stuffed.

776
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:09,429
- Open call, five foot three, blonde.

777
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:11,750
This is it, Dennis.

778
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,704
Oh, cheer up, you'll get her next time.

779
00:44:13,704 --> 00:44:15,763
- Holly, there's not gonna be a next time.

780
00:44:15,763 --> 00:44:17,953
Let's face it, I blew it.

781
00:44:17,953 --> 00:44:19,268
She's out of my league anyway.

782
00:44:19,268 --> 00:44:22,070
She deserves much more than me.

783
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,070
She deserves

784
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:27,066
him.

785
00:44:30,642 --> 00:44:33,225
- Hi, you look lovely, my dear.

786
00:44:35,091 --> 00:44:36,091
- As do you.

787
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:40,503
- Oh, that must have
been a strong martini.

788
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:41,449
- My shift starts in an hour.

789
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:43,116
I'm gonna leave now.

790
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:47,675
- George, this is Holly,

791
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:50,230
and that's Calvin in the adorable hat.

792
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,588
- I'll have a coffee.

793
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:54,095
- George is a producer.

794
00:44:54,095 --> 00:44:55,737
- Really?

795
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:56,954
Well, I have to get going.

796
00:44:56,954 --> 00:44:58,682
Gonna be late for my audition.

797
00:44:58,682 --> 00:44:59,597
- You're an actress?

798
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:02,905
- Yeah, I'm up for a small
part in an off-Broadway play,

799
00:45:02,905 --> 00:45:06,127
southern temptress, but
I don't think I have

800
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:07,627
enough sex appeal.

801
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,728
- Oh, I really don't
think that's a problem.

802
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:13,033
Why don't you call me.

803
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:15,535
We'll have lunch, see what pans out.

804
00:45:15,535 --> 00:45:16,868
- I'd love that.

805
00:45:17,901 --> 00:45:19,899
- Aren't you late for your audition?

806
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:21,783
- Yeah, I have to get going.

807
00:45:21,783 --> 00:45:23,125
- I should be running along as well.

808
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:25,542
Let me walk you out.

809
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:26,709
I'll page you.

810
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:33,729
- Guess you don't want your coffee, huh?

811
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:38,139
- So, what time do you get off work?

812
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:52,815
- So how do you know George?

813
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:54,565
- A friend set us up.

814
00:45:59,068 --> 00:46:01,642
- Can I ask you a personal question?

815
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:03,892
- No, I'm not a prostitute.

816
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:07,213
- That wasn't the question.

817
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:12,348
Yeah, it was.

818
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:18,769
- You see, the men I date,
we have an understanding.

819
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:20,986
I treat them well, they treat me well,

820
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,486
everybody's happy.

821
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:25,306
- You don't have a problem with that?

822
00:46:25,306 --> 00:46:26,607
- With what?

823
00:46:26,607 --> 00:46:30,140
Not having to work, custom-made dresses,

824
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,390
nice apartment?

825
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:35,075
You wanna see it?

826
00:46:54,741 --> 00:46:57,624
- This place is definitely
nicer than Agatha's.

827
00:46:57,624 --> 00:47:00,580
- Thanks, a friend helped me out.

828
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,115
Have a seat, country boy,
I'm about to tell you

829
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:04,032
the secret of New York.

830
00:47:06,554 --> 00:47:08,887
- Not there, that's a Gucci!

831
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,885
It's very simple, get what you want,

832
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:17,635
you enjoy it, and don't
worry about the rest.

833
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:21,622
See, I used to be like you.

834
00:47:23,113 --> 00:47:24,298
- How do you mean?

835
00:47:24,298 --> 00:47:25,586
- Selfless.

836
00:47:25,586 --> 00:47:28,834
I followed my husband around
like you follow Holly.

837
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,862
- I don't follow Holly.

838
00:47:30,862 --> 00:47:35,794
- If Holly didn't come to
New York, would you have?

839
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:39,961
What I'm saying is, you
don't have to be a follower.

840
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:42,873
You're in New York now.

841
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:45,702
You can lead.

842
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:47,884
- How?

843
00:47:47,884 --> 00:47:50,947
(gentle music)

844
00:47:50,947 --> 00:47:53,781
- This is not easy for me.

845
00:47:53,781 --> 00:47:55,466
You know I have feelings for you,

846
00:47:55,466 --> 00:47:57,133
I never denied that.

847
00:47:58,105 --> 00:47:59,022
But Rico...

848
00:48:05,794 --> 00:48:08,044
Rico is no one-woman's man.

849
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,946
Maybe I give too much.

850
00:48:12,946 --> 00:48:14,596
It's my fault.

851
00:48:14,596 --> 00:48:18,763
Maybe we should spend some
time apart, see other people.

852
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:24,739
Why the long face?

853
00:48:26,982 --> 00:48:27,815
It's okay.

854
00:49:02,368 --> 00:49:03,786
- [Holly] I love New York!

855
00:49:03,786 --> 00:49:04,890
- [Dennis] Ow!

856
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,730
I guess you got the job.

857
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,563
- That's right!

858
00:49:07,563 --> 00:49:09,754
You're looking at sexy
background girl number three!

859
00:49:09,754 --> 00:49:11,573
- That's great, congratulations.

860
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,406
Ow!

861
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:16,050
I really shouldn't.

862
00:49:17,007 --> 00:49:18,659
- Oh, one drink won't kill you.

863
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,455
Oh, maybe it will.

864
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:21,341
Calvin!

865
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:23,347
Oh, Dennis, you should've seen me!

866
00:49:23,347 --> 00:49:24,681
I did everything right.

867
00:49:24,681 --> 00:49:27,506
I leaned forward twice,
I kept my shoulders back,

868
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,768
my boobs out, and I sucked in my stomach.

869
00:49:29,768 --> 00:49:31,863
- Was it an audition or a check-up?

870
00:49:31,863 --> 00:49:34,075
- I took my bite, Dennis, and I prevailed!

871
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:35,110
I mean, this is a new era.

872
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,952
This is the era of Holly Hewitt.

873
00:49:36,952 --> 00:49:39,452
Today, is, no that's not good.

874
00:49:40,967 --> 00:49:43,884
(mysterious music)

875
00:49:47,624 --> 00:49:50,207
(gentle music)

876
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:15,108
There's no one here.

877
00:50:15,108 --> 00:50:17,176
There's something in her shirt.

878
00:50:17,176 --> 00:50:18,595
Well, go get it.

879
00:50:18,595 --> 00:50:20,012
- I'd rather not.

880
00:50:27,547 --> 00:50:28,387
- Ugh!

881
00:50:28,387 --> 00:50:30,470
- What is it, what is it?

882
00:50:31,883 --> 00:50:33,182
- No.

883
00:50:33,182 --> 00:50:34,015
- Is that?

884
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:39,618
(knocking)

885
00:50:39,618 --> 00:50:40,451
- Calvin?

886
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:45,851
Vincent.

887
00:50:45,851 --> 00:50:47,528
- And so it ends.

888
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:49,555
- Vince, this really isn't a good time.

889
00:50:49,555 --> 00:50:50,461
- I'm terribly sorry.

890
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:53,045
Tell me, when is it a
good time to get evicted?

891
00:50:53,045 --> 00:50:54,699
- What are you?

892
00:50:54,699 --> 00:50:55,815
What is that?

893
00:50:55,815 --> 00:50:59,434
- Oh, you know, funny you should ask.

894
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:02,379
You see, this is the
original rental contract

895
00:51:02,379 --> 00:51:04,886
for Agatha Washburn for this apartment.

896
00:51:04,886 --> 00:51:06,508
There's her signature
right there, do you see it?

897
00:51:06,508 --> 00:51:07,341
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

898
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:10,424
- Oh, that's--
- We see with our eyes.

899
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:15,581
Take a look over here
where it says next of kin.

900
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:17,507
I don't have my glasses
on, so could you tell me

901
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,543
right here what exactly does it say?

902
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:22,339
- Rose Washburn.

903
00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:24,397
- (gasps) Rose Washburn!

904
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:26,733
Agatha's sister from Iowa.

905
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:27,733
- You didn't uh?

906
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:28,566
- Call her?

907
00:51:28,566 --> 00:51:29,528
No, no, no.

908
00:51:29,528 --> 00:51:30,570
How could I call her?

909
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:34,162
That number, that's gotta
be like 40 years old, right?

910
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:37,617
I tell you what, the
operator was quite helpful.

911
00:51:37,617 --> 00:51:41,978
Oh, God, Rose and I, we
talked for a long time.

912
00:51:41,978 --> 00:51:43,500
We talked about the weather.

913
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,852
We talked about how to poach an egg,

914
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:49,594
but oh God, she said the funniest thing.

915
00:51:49,594 --> 00:51:53,529
You're never gonna believe
this, about Agatha.

916
00:51:53,529 --> 00:51:54,752
- That she's dead?

917
00:51:54,752 --> 00:51:57,069
- Yeah, how did you guess?

918
00:51:57,069 --> 00:51:59,080
- Rose is crazy.

919
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,614
Next time, ask her to put
Liberace on the phone.

920
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:02,447
- I might do that.

921
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:04,101
In the meantime, get out!

922
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:05,539
- You're making a big mistake.

923
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,372
- You think so?

924
00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:07,520
How about getting Agatha out here,

925
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,211
we'll clear the whole thing up, huh?

926
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:10,878
- Um, hold on a sec.

927
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:19,779
- [Dennis] No!

928
00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:20,804
No.
- I'm begging you.

929
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,417
Dennis, don't let me lose
the apartment, not now.

930
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:24,775
Not when things are going so well.

931
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:28,651
- Sorry, life is full of disappointments.

932
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:29,901
- Fine.
- Fine.

933
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:39,827
- If I don't do this, then everything they

934
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:41,744
said about me was true.

935
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:46,011
I'm just a hick on a
little New York adventure.

936
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:48,617
That's all I'll ever be.

937
00:52:48,617 --> 00:52:50,169
For the rest of my manure-shoveling,

938
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:52,502
bean-picking, pathetic life.

939
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:57,908
Don't send me back to Pottsville, Dennis.

940
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,908
I'd rather go to prison.

941
00:53:11,548 --> 00:53:14,308
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

942
00:53:14,308 --> 00:53:15,641
Please, come in.

943
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,076
- What the hell for?

944
00:53:19,076 --> 00:53:21,851
- I have to tell you something.

945
00:53:21,851 --> 00:53:24,471
Something you didn't know.

946
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:26,784
- What, you think I'm an idiot?

947
00:53:26,784 --> 00:53:28,576
This some sort of trick?

948
00:53:28,576 --> 00:53:30,659
- No, no, no more tricks.

949
00:53:34,948 --> 00:53:36,948
It's time for the truth.

950
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:43,667
- All right, but the door stays open.

951
00:53:57,951 --> 00:53:58,868
- Iced tea?

952
00:54:02,343 --> 00:54:04,343
Okay, Agatha's not dead.

953
00:54:06,282 --> 00:54:07,618
- Uh huh.

954
00:54:07,618 --> 00:54:10,200
- She only wants people
to think she's dead.

955
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,308
- And why would she want that?

956
00:54:12,308 --> 00:54:14,641
- Because of her, her state.

957
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:19,721
A couple weeks ago, Agatha
began to have problems,

958
00:54:19,721 --> 00:54:22,489
you know, health problems.

959
00:54:22,489 --> 00:54:25,816
It began with an itching
in her arms and legs.

960
00:54:25,816 --> 00:54:26,671
- Really?

961
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:28,170
- Yeah, and the itching got so bad,

962
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,265
she was in constant pain.

963
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:34,574
The doctors, they didn't know. (crying)

964
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:36,157
I'm okay, I'm okay.

965
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:41,267
About two days later,
she lapsed into a coma,

966
00:54:43,165 --> 00:54:44,396
and when she came out the next day,

967
00:54:44,396 --> 00:54:46,386
she had these terrible tremors,

968
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:49,303
and she had no feeling in her legs.

969
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:55,023
Plus, her vision was eerily blurred.

970
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:00,579
She's been bedridden ever since.

971
00:55:04,146 --> 00:55:05,146
- Bedridden?

972
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:07,574
Where?

973
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:15,062
- Coming?

974
00:55:28,048 --> 00:55:29,450
Agatha?

975
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,283
Agatha, are you awake?

976
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:33,194
Agatha?

977
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,502
Hello, how you feelin'?

978
00:55:42,022 --> 00:55:43,972
Oh, okay, are your eyes still hurting you?

979
00:55:43,972 --> 00:55:46,139
I'll turn down the lights.

980
00:55:47,508 --> 00:55:48,341
There you go.

981
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:49,924
That's better, huh?

982
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:52,059
Who's he?

983
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:52,993
Oh, he's the doctor.

984
00:55:52,993 --> 00:55:54,589
He's here for your checkup.

985
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:56,148
Yeah, he's here for your checkup.

986
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:58,359
Okay, okay, he'll go, he'll go.

987
00:55:58,359 --> 00:55:59,192
Okay.

988
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:01,264
Yeah, oh, oh, love you too.

989
00:56:01,264 --> 00:56:02,777
Oh yeah, that's a good hug.

990
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:04,836
Okay, all right.

991
00:56:04,836 --> 00:56:06,212
Okay, love you too.

992
00:56:06,212 --> 00:56:07,707
Okay, yeah.
- What have I done?

993
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:10,374
- All right, I'll be back, okay.

994
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:13,044
We should go.

995
00:56:13,044 --> 00:56:14,585
- Yeah, I made a mistake.

996
00:56:14,585 --> 00:56:16,166
Oh my God, Agatha, watch your head!

997
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:18,416
- Okay, okay, got ya there.

998
00:56:19,327 --> 00:56:20,588
Almost had a boo-boo.

999
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:22,905
Okay, all right, there.

1000
00:56:22,905 --> 00:56:24,988
Make sure you're all snug

1001
00:56:29,568 --> 00:56:30,819
in there, there you go.

1002
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:31,652
Feel better?

1003
00:56:31,652 --> 00:56:32,485
Okay.

1004
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:34,432
All right, yeah, you're okay.

1005
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,349
Oh, Calvin!

1006
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,437
Calvin, um, look who's up?

1007
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:47,399
Calvin!

1008
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:49,577
Calvin, Calvin.

1009
00:56:49,577 --> 00:56:51,793
Oh, he does this all the
time, low blood sugar.

1010
00:56:51,793 --> 00:56:52,950
- Here, tea, it's presweetened.

1011
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:53,783
- Oh, thanks.

1012
00:56:53,783 --> 00:56:54,980
Uh, Calvin, Calvin, honey.

1013
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,370
Wake up, wake up.

1014
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,953
Okay, there you go.

1015
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:00,547
- I could've sworn that I saw.

1016
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:02,297
Oh God.
- No, Calvin.

1017
00:57:06,043 --> 00:57:06,971
You okay?

1018
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:09,221
Okay, baby, sweet potato?

1019
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:10,054
Oh no.

1020
00:57:11,876 --> 00:57:13,634
Is your head okay?

1021
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:14,829
Sweetie, come on.

1022
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:15,662
You're okay.

1023
00:57:15,662 --> 00:57:16,495
Come on.

1024
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:20,300
Uh.

1025
00:57:24,515 --> 00:57:25,682
- Hi, Vincent.

1026
00:57:35,523 --> 00:57:37,984
- To Vincent, who so
generously agreed to wait

1027
00:57:37,984 --> 00:57:40,734
till tomorrow to call the police.

1028
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:45,838
To Dennis, who sacrificed
his job, his tuition,

1029
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:47,255
to help a friend.

1030
00:57:49,357 --> 00:57:51,774
And to Agatha, quite a sport.

1031
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:55,028
- If only I got here sooner.

1032
00:57:55,028 --> 00:57:56,016
- You couldn't have known.

1033
00:57:56,016 --> 00:57:57,877
- You don't understand.

1034
00:57:57,877 --> 00:57:59,144
I should have been here.

1035
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:01,643
I should have come straight home.

1036
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:03,060
I shouldn't've...

1037
00:58:04,244 --> 00:58:06,244
- You shouln't've, what?

1038
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,983
Why?

1039
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:26,784
- I was just trying to keep up.

1040
00:58:43,508 --> 00:58:45,679
- I baked us some brownies,

1041
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:47,179
some comfort food,

1042
00:58:48,553 --> 00:58:51,886
except when they're scalding your hands.

1043
00:58:53,127 --> 00:58:54,344
What are you doing?

1044
00:58:54,344 --> 00:58:55,256
- What difference does it make?

1045
00:58:55,256 --> 00:58:58,006
I'm not gonna need these in Iowa.

1046
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:02,994
I'm sorry.

1047
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,575
- It's okay.

1048
00:59:06,575 --> 00:59:08,222
It's just a job.

1049
00:59:08,222 --> 00:59:12,155
- Not the job, for breaking my promise.

1050
00:59:12,155 --> 00:59:14,814
I'm sorry about Audrey.

1051
00:59:14,814 --> 00:59:15,814
- Forget it.

1052
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:19,090
I never had a chance anyway.

1053
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:25,282
(sad music)

1054
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:50,412
♫ Lamore's quiet way of crying

1055
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:56,214
♫ Is just to never be heard

1056
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:01,824

1059
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:11,365
Keep up with who?

1060
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:15,966
I am the same person I've always been.

1061
01:00:15,966 --> 01:00:19,716
♫ I realize that I was wrong

1062
01:00:21,983 --> 01:00:24,233
♫ So wrong

1063
01:00:26,228 --> 01:00:28,658
♫ You were my everything ♫

1064
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,332
- It's funny.

1065
01:00:30,332 --> 01:00:33,135
After everything I've done,

1066
01:00:33,135 --> 01:00:35,565
Calvin is the one that belongs here.

1067
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:38,163
He's the real New Yorker.

1068
01:00:38,163 --> 01:00:40,136
- Well, in all fairness, you're probably

1069
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,886
both going to prison.

1070
01:00:43,317 --> 01:00:45,870
♫ My life is empty without your love ♫

1071
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:49,069
- Why can't all guys be like you?

1072
01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:51,152
- We drew straws, I lost.

1073
01:00:53,406 --> 01:00:56,577
- You're smart, you're funny.

1074
01:00:56,577 --> 01:00:58,271
You always touch your
glasses when you're nervous,

1075
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:00,012
which is so cute.

1076

01:01:27,143 --> 01:01:28,290
♫ I want to make you understand ♫

1083
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,680

01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,810
This isn't who I want to be.

1085
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:36,143
Maybe I'm changing too fast.

1086
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:39,362
Maybe I scared Calvin off!

1087
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:42,398
I can't lose him.

1088
01:01:43,948 --> 01:01:48,110
Without Calvin, no
success is worth anything.

1089
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,777
- Does he know that?

1090
01:01:51,037 --> 01:01:52,882
Where are you goin'?

1091
01:01:52,882 --> 01:01:54,132
- I don't know.

1092
01:02:02,341 --> 01:02:03,508
- Can we talk?

1093
01:02:19,821 --> 01:02:21,654
I'm not sophisticated.

1094
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:28,471
I'm not cosmopolitan
or anything like that.

1095
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:30,554
I'm just a guy from Iowa.

1096
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:45,839
I can't explain to you
why I did what I did.

1097
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:46,672
It's...

1098
01:02:48,963 --> 01:02:50,213
It's so stupid.

1099
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:52,470
But um...

1100
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,817
I thought I was losing you.

1101
01:03:02,165 --> 01:03:05,415
I felt like you didn't want me anymore.

1102
01:03:07,886 --> 01:03:09,633
I need you to know that I'm still

1103
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:11,883
the same person that I was.

1104
01:03:15,045 --> 01:03:18,287
I'm still terrified of failure.

1105
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:21,704
I'm still determined to help you succeed.

1106
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:24,455
I'm still in love with the same girl

1107
01:03:24,455 --> 01:03:29,096
that I fell in love with
when I was in second grade.

1108
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:31,679
(gentle music)

1109
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,663
I'm so sorry.

1110
01:03:45,352 --> 01:03:47,185
I need you in my life.

1111
01:03:54,661 --> 01:03:56,578
Holly, I'm beggin' you.

1112
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,100
You've gotta give me another chance.

1113
01:04:04,128 --> 01:04:06,961
(soft jazz music)

1114
01:04:36,136 --> 01:04:37,803
- Oh, look who's up.

1115
01:04:40,331 --> 01:04:41,614
- What's goin' on?

1116
01:04:41,614 --> 01:04:43,583
- Oh, our salvation, that's what.

1117
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:45,142
Dennis here has provided us with some

1118
01:04:45,142 --> 01:04:47,142
interesting information.

1119
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:53,742
- Young Lasso ropes dead rabbits.

1120
01:04:53,742 --> 01:04:55,015
I don't get it.

1121
01:04:55,015 --> 01:04:56,383
- Yesterday, Vincent said he wouldn't call

1122
01:04:56,383 --> 01:04:57,961
the police until today.

1123
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,418
Why?

1124
01:04:59,418 --> 01:05:01,635
- Christian spirit?

1125
01:05:01,635 --> 01:05:04,483
- Because today at four o'clock is

1126
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,800
the annual building inspection.

1127
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,201
Ow!

1128
01:05:08,201 --> 01:05:09,628
And the last thing that Vincent wants

1129
01:05:09,628 --> 01:05:12,628
is to end up in the newspaper again.

1130
01:05:14,132 --> 01:05:18,299
- Have some coffee, the hicks
are about to make a comeback.

1131
01:05:19,824 --> 01:05:21,139
You okay?
- Yeah.

1132
01:05:21,139 --> 01:05:23,639
(light music)

1133
01:05:30,038 --> 01:05:31,642
Iggy, Iggy, I need you to get up

1134
01:05:31,642 --> 01:05:32,610
and work the door, okay?

1135
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:33,724
Inspector's coming, you got it?

1136
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:35,141
You got it, good.

1137
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:44,754
Iggy, Iggy, Iggy!

1138
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:46,632
The door, the inspector's coming?

1139
01:05:46,632 --> 01:05:47,465
You got it?

1140
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:48,298
You all right?

1141
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:49,131
You got it?

1142
01:05:49,131 --> 01:05:50,048
We're good?

1143
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:56,796
(tires squealing)

1144
01:06:07,644 --> 01:06:09,585
- [Peter] Are you retarded?

1145
01:06:09,585 --> 01:06:11,410
Go back to driver's training!

1146
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,410
Come on!
- Hey, up yours!

1147
01:06:15,868 --> 01:06:17,688
Watch the paint!

1148
01:06:17,688 --> 01:06:20,586
(tires squealing)

1149
01:06:20,586 --> 01:06:22,003
- Iggy, the door.

1150
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:31,820
Okay.

1151
01:06:35,196 --> 01:06:38,196
- (sighing) Claire.

1152
01:06:39,952 --> 01:06:41,833
Door. (fingers snapping)

1153
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:42,916
Get the door.

1154
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:52,667
- I got it, I got it.

1155
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,627
- Claire, this is Vincent.

1156
01:06:58,588 --> 01:07:00,825
- Beautiful day, don't you think?

1157
01:07:00,825 --> 01:07:02,658
- Painfully beautiful.

1158
01:07:06,968 --> 01:07:08,361
- What are you doing here?

1159
01:07:08,361 --> 01:07:10,240
- I'm your father's assistant.

1160
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,895
I go wherever he goes.

1161
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,272
- You mean?

1162
01:07:14,272 --> 01:07:18,080
- Oh yes, he's coming to
oversee the building inspection.

1163
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:22,163
Let's hope nothing goes
horribly, horribly wrong.

1164
01:07:27,259 --> 01:07:28,868
- [Driver] Here's your briefcase, sir.

1165
01:07:28,868 --> 01:07:30,285
- Thank you, Kim.

1166
01:07:34,276 --> 01:07:37,397
- Mr. Lasso, sir,
everything's fine inside.

1167
01:07:37,397 --> 01:07:38,653
No problems.

1168
01:07:38,653 --> 01:07:40,613
- Where's the demon seed?

1169
01:07:40,613 --> 01:07:42,113
- Oh, inside, sir.

1170
01:07:44,031 --> 01:07:46,399
- Well, then we got ourselves a problem.

1171
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:50,149
- Thank you, sir. (coughing)

1172
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,796
- Hello, Father.

1173
01:07:56,796 --> 01:07:58,748
- Well, that's what four DNA tests say.

1174
01:07:58,748 --> 01:08:00,665
I ain't so sure myself.

1175
01:08:02,276 --> 01:08:03,950
Is she your inspector?

1176
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:04,867
- Yes, sir.

1177
01:08:06,214 --> 01:08:07,703
- How do, ma'am?

1178
01:08:07,703 --> 01:08:10,286
Beautiful day, don't you think?

1179
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:16,255
Okay, kid, now's your
chance to come clean.

1180
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,345
I ain't gonna find no surprises, right?

1181
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,178
- No, sir.

1182
01:08:20,178 --> 01:08:21,585
- No little dead critters with candles

1183
01:08:21,585 --> 01:08:23,425
stickin' out of their asses?

1184
01:08:23,425 --> 01:08:25,842
No shrunken voodoo hall dick?

1185
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:27,913
- No, sir.

1186
01:08:27,913 --> 01:08:30,754
- Good, 'cause if I do, you are cut off,

1187
01:08:30,754 --> 01:08:32,820
and I ain't jokin' this time.

1188
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:33,653
- Okay.

1189
01:08:37,151 --> 01:08:40,207
- Here, your mother
baked you some cookies.

1190
01:08:40,207 --> 01:08:41,954
Well, ma'am, time's a-wastin'.

1191
01:08:41,954 --> 01:08:44,151
Let's get this show on the road.

1192
01:08:44,151 --> 01:08:44,984
After you.

1193
01:08:46,724 --> 01:08:48,974
(knocking)

1194
01:08:53,034 --> 01:08:55,408
- Safety glass safe.

1195
01:08:55,408 --> 01:08:56,434
- The sprinklers work too.

1196
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:59,073
I found that out by accident when,

1197
01:08:59,073 --> 01:09:02,490
of course, that's neither here nor there.

1198
01:09:03,809 --> 01:09:06,559
(elevator dings)

1199
01:09:14,593 --> 01:09:18,760
- EG Manufacturing, very
nice, very nice, very nice.

1200
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,631
- Well, it's a Lasso property, ma'am.

1201
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:25,506
We don't make 'em any other way.

1202
01:09:25,506 --> 01:09:27,937
- And what's behind that restricted area?

1203
01:09:27,937 --> 01:09:30,369
- That is the garbage room, and it is also

1204
01:09:30,369 --> 01:09:32,286
the janitor's quarters.

1205
01:09:33,345 --> 01:09:34,901
- Pardon me.

1206
01:09:34,901 --> 01:09:35,734
Excuse me.

1207
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:45,909
- What the hell was that?

1208
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:48,410
- The janitor.

1209
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,910
- Wearing a cloak?

1210
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,228
- He's not from around here.

1211
01:09:54,563 --> 01:09:57,166
- Yes, moving right along, serial number

1212
01:09:57,166 --> 01:10:01,578
821 15 89.
(voices chanting)

1213
01:10:01,578 --> 01:10:02,563
Do you hear something?

1214
01:10:02,563 --> 01:10:03,660
- Hear something, no.

1215
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:05,787
- I hear something.

1216
01:10:05,787 --> 01:10:07,287
- It's like a hum.

1217
01:10:09,983 --> 01:10:13,150
- (laughing) The hum.

1218
01:10:14,641 --> 01:10:16,884
Of course I hear the hum.

1219
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:18,625
Yeah, you can't miss it.

1220
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:20,208
I'll be right back.

1221
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:25,370
- Did you write down the hum?

1222
01:10:29,822 --> 01:10:32,622
- Master, thank Zob you're here.

1223
01:10:32,622 --> 01:10:34,872
(chanting)

1224
01:10:40,335 --> 01:10:42,514
- What are you guys doing?

1225
01:10:42,514 --> 01:10:43,544
You guys are evicted.

1226
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:45,407
Come on, get outta here.

1227
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,076
- Master, what's gotten into you?

1228
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:50,314
- [Claire] Mr. Lasso, is there a problem?

1229
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:51,598
- Just a minute!

1230
01:10:51,598 --> 01:10:53,499
I'm serious, guys, all right.
(knocking)

1231
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,717
I want you to grab the
candles and your cadaver,

1232
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:56,990
and get the hell outta here.

1233
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:58,697
- We can't, we're in the middle of a spell

1234
01:10:58,697 --> 01:11:02,032
that makes the building
manager do whatever we want.

1235
01:11:02,032 --> 01:11:03,137
- What is it that you want, huh?

1236
01:11:03,137 --> 01:11:04,234
What is it?

1237
01:11:04,234 --> 01:11:06,151
- Funny you should ask.

1238
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:10,483
Dennis wants his job back.

1239
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:11,593
- If it's not too much trouble,

1240
01:11:11,593 --> 01:11:13,051
I'd like the job.
- It's done, okay?

1241
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:14,133
What else?

1242
01:11:14,133 --> 01:11:16,204
- We want you to agree not to evict us,

1243
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:20,078
call the police or pester us
for at least three months.

1244
01:11:20,078 --> 01:11:21,528
That'll give us time to
find a new apartment.

1245
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:22,787
- I agree, that's plenty of time.

1246
01:11:22,787 --> 01:11:24,311
- How do we know you'll keep your word?

1247
01:11:24,311 --> 01:11:25,810
- Because I promised, what's the problem?

1248
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:27,560
- We need collateral.

1249
01:11:28,828 --> 01:11:31,328
- (gasps) No!

1250
01:11:36,516 --> 01:11:40,459
- Looks like we're not
locked out after all.

1251
01:11:40,459 --> 01:11:42,283
- Did you bring my checkbook?

1252
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:43,692
- Of course.

1253
01:11:43,692 --> 01:11:45,778
- Fine, good, so we have a deal, right?

1254
01:11:45,778 --> 01:11:48,361
So if we just get rid of the...

1255
01:11:58,325 --> 01:11:59,379
- A little help.

1256
01:11:59,379 --> 01:12:00,712
- With pleasure.

1257
01:12:11,268 --> 01:12:13,298
- Thank God you're here!

1258
01:12:13,298 --> 01:12:14,465
Somebody help.

1259
01:12:16,054 --> 01:12:17,838
I was climbing on top of the bin,

1260
01:12:17,838 --> 01:12:18,967
and I was reaching for the light bulb,

1261
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:21,677
and I musta lost my balance.

1262
01:12:21,677 --> 01:12:23,332
- What light bulb?

1263
01:12:23,332 --> 01:12:24,249
- The uh...

1264
01:12:26,017 --> 01:12:28,463
Not light bulb, ceiling.

1265
01:12:28,463 --> 01:12:30,826
I was reaching for the ah,

1266
01:12:30,826 --> 01:12:32,311
ow!

1267
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:36,061
Oh my God, ow, oh, my
knee, it must be broke!

1268
01:12:36,932 --> 01:12:37,765
The agony!

1269
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:39,483
Urgh!

1270
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:45,122
- I don't understand.

1271
01:12:45,122 --> 01:12:46,872
How could she just...

1272
01:12:48,644 --> 01:12:50,290
- Can I help you?

1273
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,123
- Rico!

1274
01:12:52,362 --> 01:12:54,874
Give me back my aunt right now!

1275
01:12:54,874 --> 01:12:58,680
- If you have ants, maybe
you need exterminators.

1276
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,150
- You got five seconds, Rico, to tell us

1277
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,331
where she is.

1278
01:13:01,331 --> 01:13:03,033
- You know, you're sick.

1279
01:13:03,033 --> 01:13:03,909
- You're sick.

1280
01:13:03,909 --> 01:13:04,888
- No, you are sick.

1281
01:13:04,888 --> 01:13:05,721
You need to see a doctor.

1282
01:13:05,721 --> 01:13:07,818
- Give me back my aunt!

1283
01:13:07,818 --> 01:13:09,512
- You know, I just woke up.

1284
01:13:09,512 --> 01:13:11,301
I have no newspaper.

1285
01:13:11,301 --> 01:13:12,499
Where is my news?

1286
01:13:12,499 --> 01:13:13,970
Where is my news?

1287
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,172
- Make it quick.

1288
01:13:15,172 --> 01:13:16,609
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1289
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:18,589
- Okay, okay, okay.

1290
01:13:18,589 --> 01:13:20,820
Okay, I take her.

1291
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:21,988
- [Holly] Where is she?

1292
01:13:21,988 --> 01:13:25,391
- I take her because I love her.

1293
01:13:25,391 --> 01:13:27,359
She's my ocean.

1294
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:28,526
I am her boat.

1295
01:13:29,974 --> 01:13:32,724
Without my ocean, I cannot float.

1296
01:13:35,316 --> 01:13:36,681
- That's disgusting.

1297
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:38,431
Tell us where she is.

1298
01:13:39,412 --> 01:13:42,692
- Where she is where she wants to be.

1299
01:13:42,692 --> 01:13:43,525
- What's that mean?

1300
01:13:43,525 --> 01:13:45,948
- She wants to be where she wants to be,

1301
01:13:45,948 --> 01:13:48,693
where you will never find her.

1302
01:13:48,693 --> 01:13:50,701
She is where I put her.

1303
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:53,832
She is where you'll never,
ever, ever find her.

1304
01:13:53,832 --> 01:13:56,082
- She's in the incinerator.

1305
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:02,739
(screams)

1306
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:04,736
- [Dennis] Oh, that's wrong.

1307
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:05,819
- Get off me.

1308
01:14:15,695 --> 01:14:18,028
Come on, this is ridiculous.

1309
01:14:19,335 --> 01:14:22,836
Oh my, I do not get paid enough for this.

1310
01:14:22,836 --> 01:14:23,699
Get off me.

1311
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:28,115
- All right, all right, let's
check these water pipes.

1312
01:14:28,115 --> 01:14:29,469
- And get out of the way.

1313
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:30,302
- Sorry, sir.

1314
01:14:30,302 --> 01:14:31,135
- Idiot.

1315
01:14:35,954 --> 01:14:37,537
- [Claire] Not bad.

1316
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,347
Oh, I don't know.

1317
01:14:47,694 --> 01:14:48,777
I don't know.

1318
01:14:54,945 --> 01:14:55,945
- Hey, psst.

1319
01:14:57,647 --> 01:14:59,595
- So, did you get everything you wanted?

1320
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:00,500
- And then some.

1321
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,826
You were perfect, Claire.

1322
01:15:01,826 --> 01:15:03,184
- How can we ever thank you?

1323
01:15:03,184 --> 01:15:05,348
- Oh, thank me, thank you, dear,

1324
01:15:05,348 --> 01:15:09,080
for sending me those lovely boarders.

1325
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,080
- I knew you'd love 'em.

1326
01:15:13,036 --> 01:15:14,530
- All right, let's get
this show on the road.

1327
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:15,534
I need to get home.

1328
01:15:15,534 --> 01:15:18,534
I have a few chores to take care of.

1329
01:15:20,925 --> 01:15:22,258
Excuse me, boys.

1330
01:15:25,711 --> 01:15:27,124
- [Dennis] Ugh!

1331
01:15:27,124 --> 01:15:29,856
(furnace firing)

1332
01:15:29,856 --> 01:15:31,301
- No!

1333
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:32,782
Stop!

1334
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:34,093
No!

1335
01:15:34,093 --> 01:15:35,360
No!

1336
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,193
Agatha!

1337
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:38,254
Agatha!

1338
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,033
Agatha.

1339
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:50,984
(dreamy music)

1340
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:04,118
- Midwestern farm girl
exudes charm and innocence,

1341
01:16:04,118 --> 01:16:05,623
I should go for this.

1342
01:16:05,623 --> 01:16:08,351
- Ah, I don't know, keep readin'.

1343
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:11,243
- Jenny, 22, lives in rural Minnesota.

1344
01:16:11,243 --> 01:16:13,511
Loves horses, men with pickup trucks

1345
01:16:13,511 --> 01:16:17,205
and stands a healthy five foot eight.

1346
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:18,038
- Oh.

1347
01:16:19,677 --> 01:16:20,927
Where's Dennis?

1348
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,938
(man struggling)

1349
01:16:24,938 --> 01:16:26,329
- Are you sure you don't
need some help with that?

1350
01:16:26,329 --> 01:16:28,996
- No, no, I'm positive I got it.

1351
01:16:29,975 --> 01:16:31,229
Where do you want it?

1352
01:16:31,229 --> 01:16:33,652
- Right over there is good.

1353
01:16:33,652 --> 01:16:35,102
You're reading Little Women?

1354
01:16:35,102 --> 01:16:36,604
- Oh, this.

1355
01:16:36,604 --> 01:16:40,546
Um, no, actually, this girl
dropped it this morning.

1356
01:16:40,546 --> 01:16:43,688
- Oh, and you're just
holding it for her, right?

1357
01:16:43,688 --> 01:16:44,521
- Right.

1358
01:16:46,384 --> 01:16:49,586
Why, have you read this book before?

1359
01:16:49,586 --> 01:16:50,982
- Yeah, like five times.

1360
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:51,832
- Really?

1361
01:16:51,832 --> 01:16:54,696
- I'd read it again, I just,
I have too much schoolwork.

1362
01:16:54,696 --> 01:16:56,439
- You're in school.

1363
01:16:56,439 --> 01:16:58,739
Um, what are you studying?

1364
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,549
- Speech therapy.

1365
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:03,475
I'm starting my master's
at NYU next month.

1366
01:17:03,475 --> 01:17:05,355
- That's great.

1367
01:17:05,355 --> 01:17:07,107
That's great.

1368
01:17:07,107 --> 01:17:07,940
Um.

1369
01:17:12,987 --> 01:17:13,904
Well, okay.

1370
01:17:17,898 --> 01:17:22,065
- Um, well, you don't have
to go just yet, do you?

1371
01:17:23,721 --> 01:17:26,804
- No, no, actually, I have some time.

1372
01:17:30,802 --> 01:17:32,981
- How can you eat those?

1373
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,557
- Pork rinds are good for you.

1374
01:17:34,557 --> 01:17:38,835
- [Audrey] One more kiss. (lips smacking)

1375
01:17:38,835 --> 01:17:41,252
- Hey, good morning, tenants.

1376
01:17:43,568 --> 01:17:45,579
Oh, today's the first of the month,

1377
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:47,765
so if you could drop off
the rent check today,

1378
01:17:47,765 --> 01:17:50,405
that'd be great, all right?

1379
01:17:50,405 --> 01:17:51,378
- Okay.

1380
01:17:51,378 --> 01:17:53,022
Yeah, we'll do that tonight.

1381
01:17:53,022 --> 01:17:53,855
- Awesome.

1382
01:17:56,989 --> 01:17:59,688
Hey, have either one of you seen Rico?

1383
01:17:59,688 --> 01:18:01,777
- Rico, no, no, un huh.

1384
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,801
- I got my score from
the inspection today.

1385
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:04,634
I got a C.

1386
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,698
- That's good.

1387
01:18:06,698 --> 01:18:07,531
- Good?

1388
01:18:07,531 --> 01:18:09,316
I shoulda gotten an A.

1389
01:18:09,316 --> 01:18:10,577
How was I supposed to know incinerators

1390
01:18:10,577 --> 01:18:13,299
have been illegal in
Manhattan since 1980, huh?

1391
01:18:13,299 --> 01:18:14,403
- Sorry.

1392
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:17,434
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

1393
01:18:17,434 --> 01:18:20,369
Lucky for me, the thing
wasn't even working.

1394
01:18:20,369 --> 01:18:23,305
That retard Rico forgot
to hook up the gas line.

1395
01:18:23,305 --> 01:18:26,206
(laughing)

1396
01:18:26,206 --> 01:18:27,123
That moron.

1397
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:33,531
- No.

1398
01:18:35,266 --> 01:18:38,939
♫ Chasing down that rainbow

1399
01:18:38,939 --> 01:18:42,208
♫ That's what we're gonna do ♫

1400
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:43,208
- Still hot?

1401
01:18:44,293 --> 01:18:46,960
I have AC up as far as she goes.

1402
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:51,170
I know what you want.

1403
01:18:55,956 --> 01:18:56,789
Better?

1404
01:19:00,013 --> 01:19:02,094
Wait till we get to Vegas.

1405
01:19:02,094 --> 01:19:06,261
We'll find a nice chapel
with very good ventilation.

1406
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:11,992
♫ I've got my rainbow wrapped around you

1407
01:19:11,992 --> 01:19:15,280
♫ My rainbow's wrapped around you

1408
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,769

(gentle music)

1411
01:19:27,552 --> 01:19:29,469
♫ Yeah

1412
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:37,387
♫ There are three kinds
of people in the world

1413
01:19:37,387 --> 01:19:40,352
♫ Those who wonder what happened

1414
01:19:40,352 --> 01:19:43,144
♫ Those who wait to see what happens

1415
01:19:43,144 --> 01:19:45,264
♫ And those who make things happen

1416
01:19:45,264 --> 01:19:46,513
♫ This is me

1417
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:47,391
♫ Here we go now

1418
01:19:47,391 --> 01:19:51,558
♫ Can't sit around waitin'
for my dreams to come true

1419
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:54,982
♫ Better watch out now

1420
01:19:54,982 --> 01:19:58,186
♫ 'Cause I'm makin' it through

1421
01:19:58,186 --> 01:20:00,478
♫ No obstacle can stand in my way

1422
01:20:00,478 --> 01:20:03,734
♫ And slow me down from
reachin' that place

1423
01:20:03,734 --> 01:20:07,901
♫ I believe in me, you just wait and see

1424
01:20:08,852 --> 01:20:11,299
♫ People always told me about those

1425
01:20:11,299 --> 01:20:14,179
♫ Dreams that just simply can't come true

1426
01:20:14,179 --> 01:20:16,573
♫ You never took the time in your heart

1427
01:20:16,573 --> 01:20:19,537
♫ Could just say I believe in you

1428
01:20:19,537 --> 01:20:23,844
♫ The vibes you were sending
me were all just negative

1429
01:20:23,844 --> 01:20:26,367
♫ And even I don't need you

1430
01:20:26,367 --> 01:20:29,700
♫ And you can't stop me

1431
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:32,114
♫ And life's a bitch

1432
01:20:32,114 --> 01:20:35,432
♫ I was always a no

1433
01:20:35,432 --> 01:20:37,427
♫ But now it's a yes

1434
01:20:37,427 --> 01:20:38,578
♫ But who are you

1435
01:20:38,578 --> 01:20:39,720
♫ Yeah, seriously

1436
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:43,008
♫ To put my destiny to the test

1437
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:45,425
♫ Let my instincts got me the race

1438
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:48,451
♫ I know that there's nothing I can't face

1439
01:20:48,451 --> 01:20:50,192
♫ Move away from the bad

1440
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:53,709
♫ And embrace my jam

1441
01:20:53,709 --> 01:20:56,181
♫ You always told me about those dreams

1442
01:20:56,181 --> 01:20:58,950
♫ That just simply can't come true

1443
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,402
♫ You never took the time in you heart

1444
01:21:01,402 --> 01:21:04,236
♫ To just say I believe in you

1445
01:21:04,236 --> 01:21:08,626
♫ The vibes you were sending
me were all just negative

1446
01:21:08,626 --> 01:21:11,328

♫ Nothing's gonna stop me, no, no

1454
01:21:25,442 --> 01:21:29,609
♫ 'Cause I'm as happy as I will ever be

1455
01:21:30,783 --> 01:21:34,950
♫ Nothing I can see about
what I'm meant to be

♫ You always told me about the dreams that

1457

me were all just negative

1461

you, and you can't stop me

♫ Every girl just wants a guy to love

1472
01:22:42,745 --> 01:22:45,594
♫ And a guy to pay her bills

1473
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:48,542
♫ And guys get so lucky
some bumpin' and grindin'

1474

♫ And claim that it's so chill

1475
01:22:50,856 --> 01:22:53,653
♫ The ho on the streets
in their ripped jeans

1476
