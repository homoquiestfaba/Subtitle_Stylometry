    in this interview,

    have been too much,

    these nice sweatpants on

        wearing heavy jewelry,

180
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,610

        a reason why it was--

181
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,845
        that it kind of makes
        me--because I feel

182
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,949
        so vulnerable and feel
        so, um, shy and...

185

        that wearing the jewelry
        kind of makes me feel

186

        that sort of false
        sense of confidence,

187
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,292

        me feel less vulnerable.

188
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,761
        It makes me feel like
        it's sort of a shield,

311
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,093
what--tell me what
you have to do for stamps.

312
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,328
            To put them
            in envelopes.

313
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,431
How many do you do
a day, would you say?

314
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,766
            Uh, 500.

315
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,867
Wow. That's a big
workload.

316
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,136
                    Yes.
Wow.

317
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,437
And how many hours
a day do you work?

318
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,307
            8 hours, from 7:00
            until 3:00.

319
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,842
OK. How do you get
to work?

320
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,377
                By bus.

321
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,212
Do you take one bus
or more than one?

322
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,847
            Just the bus.
            Just one bus.

323
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,148
Just one bus.
                Yes.

324
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,383
Oh. Do you like
the bus?

325
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,784
                Yes.

326
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,818
Edith, voice-over: Our aim was
he should become independent.

327
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,322
    He should be able to
    hold down a job.

328
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,326
        That, thank God,
        we accomplished

329
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,362
    without him being
    institutionalized.

330
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,479
Lenny: He's a bad man, this guy.

331
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,686
Kathy: What's up,
dude?

332
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,355
        Lenny: What's up,
        Mom?

333
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,590
        Let me finish up
        the game first.

334
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,859
Come on.

335
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:35,860
So we talked about

336
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,495
a dating website
a little bit.

337
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,565
        Yeah. I think I might
        want to do that.

338
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,367
What would you put if you
were, like, putting, like--

339
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,801
            I don't know.
            It's hard to say.

340
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,869
            I like to keep it
            private

341
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:45,937
            to me and you only.

342
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,938
        I'm gonna be serious.

343
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,707
        I'm not gonna be
        no joking around.

344
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,676
OK, if you were gonna
put on a dating website,

345
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,212
like, your interests--

346
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,913
                Sports.

347
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,582
OK. What else?

348
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,950
You wouldn't put--
how come you wouldn't

349
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,152
put any of, like,
the Comic-Con stuff?

350
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,286
Do you think
that's silly?

351
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,354
            Nope. I won't
            do it.

352
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,288
How come?

353
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,857
            Because I don't
            want to.

354
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:06,691
OK.

355
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,892
            That's you. That's--

356
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,093
But why don't you--
you don't want to find

357
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,194
somebody that likes
that kind of stuff, too?

358
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,163
                Nope.

359
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,999
So, what other interests
would you put?

360
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,101
                I don't know.

361
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,739
            I'll be taken
            more serious.

362
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,474
So you want, like,
a serious girl?

363
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,209
            Yeah, a little bit.

364
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,512
OK. A businesswoman?

365
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,080
            No, not completely,

366
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,982
            but I pay
            for the dates.

367
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,285
            Me. That's the way
            it goes.

368
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,653
    OK.

369
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,754
            That's the way
            the show goes.

370
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,623
        I'm not gonna let her
        pay for everything

371
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,825
        and me, you know,
        I got to be the one

372
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,327
            that...

373
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,396
        is the more independent
        one than her.

374
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,231
But I don't think
that that's fair.

375
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,266
            No, it is fair.

376
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,500
Kind of chauvinistic.

377
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,568
            No, it's not.

378
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,636
I think a little bit.

379
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,438
I mean, what if there's
a woman out there

380
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,473
that is perfect for you

381
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,674
but she makes more money
than you do?

382
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,544
            Nope.
            I won't take her.

383
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,779
            I'm serious.
            I won't take her.

384
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,249
    Kathy: He does not want
    to be different.

385
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,784
    He just wants to be
    like everybody else,

386
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,054
    so then he goes above
    and, like, kind of goes

387
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,457
    beyond trying to fit in,
    and everybody--

388
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,725
I can see they're like,
"Why is he acting like this?"

389
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,562
        Like, we all know
        Lenny's special,

390
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,964
    so he just needs to be
    who he is, and he's not.

391
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,833
    He tries to be
    something different.

392
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,101
            Lenny: I need to
            be the one

393
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,736
            making more money.

394
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,272
            I hear so many
            things about--

395
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,874
            I hear so many
            YouTube videos

396
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,875
            about women.

397
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,976
By men. OK--

398
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,544
            No. It's a woman
            saying,

399
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,746
            "Don't be
            with broke-ass men."

400
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,381
    Wow.

401
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,150
These are the kind
of women--

402
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,718
            No, they're trying
            to inform the women

403
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,652
            not to be
            with broke men,

404
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,653
            and I don't want
            to be--

405
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,721
            I don't want to be
            a broke male

406
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,689
            with a woman.

407
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:45,890
        I don't want her
        paying for everything.

408
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,991
        I need to be the one--

409
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,726
You don't have to be
paying for everything--

410
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,661
or she doesn't have to
be paying for everything.

411
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,896
You could be paying
for stuff,

412
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,931
but when you get into
a relationship with somebody,

413
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,767
you're supposed to be
their partner. Partner.

414
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,369
            Well, I need to be
            the one doing more.

415
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,871
            That's the way
            it goes.

416
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,472
I don't think
that's the way it goes.

417
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,275
I think that you're
being misinformed

418
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,211
by people that are just
not really great people.

419
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,746
I think you're
being misinformed.

420
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,814
                I'm not.

421
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:10,982
I think you are.

422
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,016
What if you find
somebody--

423
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,051
and I'm just saying
if you love somebody,

424
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,520
it shouldn't matter.

425
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,455
It should be, like,
you just love her,

426
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,091
and maybe one day you'll
be making more money,

427
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,726
and you guys just
support each other

428
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,896
in that good kind of
like foundation and--

429
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,297
            It's just hard.

430
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,132
            It's just hard
            to believe that.

431
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,333
Why?

432
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,769
    It's just about being
    the more independent one.

433
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,671
But you will be
independent.

434
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,072
You're going to
be independent.

435
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,741
That is gonna
happen, Lenny.

436
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,443
Sometimes it takes
a minute for people.

437
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,781
It's hard. That transition
from fricking--into manhood?

438
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,882
That thing, that's hard.

439
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,917
                I know.

440
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,318
I couldn't even--
it was hard--

441
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,587
            I'm good,
            though, Mom.

442
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,955
            I'm trying
            to be good.

443
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,290
Well, trying to be
good how?

444
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,792
I want you
to feel good.

445
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,961
            I'm just going
            through

446
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,097
            a little bit
            of a struggle.

447
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,033
            I'm down on myself
            too many times,

448
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,969
            and it's too tough
            because I feel like

449
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,004
            I should be accept--
            doing more in life.

450
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,606
Do you think--
do you consider yourself

451
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,141
like less sometimes?

452
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,209
That's kind of what
I get.

453
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,210
            Sometimes.

454
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,344
Why?

455
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,946
        I feel different.

456
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,582
        I feel better than being
        autistic sometimes.

457
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,317
Let's get past this.

458
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,153
Let's get over this
and get on with it

459
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,554
because you're
fricking awesome.

460
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,523
            I know. I know.

461
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,591
I don't think you do.

462
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,059
                I know.

463
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,028
I think you don't
and you need to know.

464
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,830
                    OK.
I love you.

465
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,067
    Kathy: He's really
    down on himself.

466
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,068
I think once he starts working,

467
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,102
    he's gonna feel
    better about himself.

468
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,170
He's gonna feel more productive,

469
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,571
    like he's out there
    doing something.

470
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,708
Because right now he doesn't
feel like he's doing anything.

471
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,012
    Man on TV: Some points
    in Massachusetts

472
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,114
    and Rhode Island could see
    up to a foot of snow,

473
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,183
and in New Jersey,
well, the storm is certainly...

474
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,820
Lindsey, voice-over: I always
knew I was different,

475
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:01,959
    even before I was informed
    of my diagnosis of autism,

476
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:07,064
    though I always felt like
    I was an odd character

477
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,635
    outside of my--my peers.

478
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:15,606
    But I didn't really
    understand why.

479
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,977
I would often get turned away,

480
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,546
    or people would ignore me,
    and I--I thought,

481
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,049
"Well, what am I doing wrong?"

482
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:30,121
And even after learning about
    my own diagnosis,

483
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:35,626
I still, for several years,
struggled to figure out

484
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,897
    why I couldn't, um,
    maintain and keep friends,

485
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:45,469
why I couldn't fit in,
why I couldn't be accepted.

486
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:56,380
Unfortunately, I think the first
impressions I received, um,

487
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:00,451
when I was learning about autism
    were quite negative,

488
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,720
        and as a result,

489
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:08,993
    I felt incredibly ashamed
    of being autistic.

490
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,563
Every morning when I get ready,
I look in the mirror

491
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,000
before I step outside the house,
and I think to myself,

492
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:20,171
        "Well, I look OK.
        I look OK today."

493
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:24,942
    And the moment I step
    outside the front door,

494
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,278
    I immediately become
    self-conscious.

495
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,955
I've recognized pretty quickly

496
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,325
that the way I perceive myself

497
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:45,830
    in the outside world

498
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,999
is drastically different than
the way I perceive myself

499
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,635
        in my own world.

500
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,172
    In some aspects
    and at some times,

501
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,776
I do feel like I have found
that personal happiness

502
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,579
    within myself,
    or that personal peace.

503
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,689
    But it's still very
    difficult for me

504
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:17,895
    to find acceptance
    of myself.

505
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:23,634
    I have just learned how
    to be a good actress.

Woman: I remember when
you first started at work,

507
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:11,315
and, um, I wasn't sure--
I wasn't necessarily sure

508
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,250
what to expect
because, you know,

509
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,886
everybody on the spectrum
is different, and...

510
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,121
            Oh, yeah.
            Yeah, absolutely.

511
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,490
you never know if
somebody is going to be

512
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,994
very outgoing or--you know,
kind of the classic

513
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,896
description of someone
on the spectrum

514
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,065
is not--you know,
unfortunately,

515
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,533
not interested,
empathetic,

516
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,534
you know, not into--

517
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,536
        I always had this fear
        people would be

518
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,739
        staring at me, that...

519
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,742
        people can see
        right through me.

520
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,112
        I think it kind of
        relates to

521
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,749
        my frustration I've
        had over the years

522
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,452
            of...

523
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,822
        being pressured to fit
        into the social norm...

524
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:59,730
        that I'm not good enough
        if I don't fit in.

525
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,399
Have you ever dated
somebody

526
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,335
who was on
the spectrum before?

527
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:07,171
        Actually, all--all
        the guys I've dated

528
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,339
        prior to Dave were--

529
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,607
        yeah, were not
        on the spectrum.

530
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,175
        So Dave is the first.

531
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,177
And how is it
different?

532
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,549
    Dave: For me, it boils
    down to 3 things.

533
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,850
    I have a formula here.

534
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:24,922
    It's L plus P plus two T.

535
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,258
    So each part is 25%.

536
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:32,997
So you have 25% of the P and L,
and you have 50% of the T,

537
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,066
    which results to what that
    person's grade would be

538
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,936
    in terms of relationship
    and dating potential.

539
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,037
    Now, you're wondering,

540
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,972
L is how they look physically--

541
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,608
    physical appearance
    and attributes.

542
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,678
        The second--the P
        is personality.

543
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,114
What is their lifestyle like?

544
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,050
    And most importantly is T
    is how they treat you.

545
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,518
    Treatment towards you.

546
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,186
If--let's say, for example,

547
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,422
    that the person
    is relatively ugly.

548
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,293
Then they get, like, a 50%
category in the L category.

549
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,429
But they have, you know,
like a perfect personality

550
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,465
    and nearly perfect way
    they treat you,

551
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,869
they're gonna score pretty well
in the overall scheme of things.

552
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,405
So the T has greater weight.

553
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,873
    It's twice as much weight
    in the formula

554
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:20,010
than the personality and looks
is how they treat you.

    Lindsey: You know,
    it's funny with Dave.

557
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:31,956
He--he's much more scientific,
and I'm much more artistic.

558
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,793
I think Dave is trying his best
        to understand me.

559
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,129
    I think he always has
tried his best to understand me.

560
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,967
    I think it's still
    difficult for him to--

561
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:47,371
    to really have that grip,
    though, of understanding,

562
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,507
    of why I have
    my particular issues.

564
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,352
    You know, it's
    a very good question

565
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:08,058
whether someone can love you
without truly understanding you.

566
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:13,330
    I still think it's
    absolutely possible. Yeah.

567
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,335
You know, obviously
we have, from time to time,

568
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:22,606
talked about marriage
and, um, if we were

569
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,942
to get married someday
and kind of

570
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,277
some of the fears
we have with that.

571
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,346
Um, uncertainties.

        whether Lindsey

573
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,984
        would take my name
        or keep her own name.

574
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,587

        prenuptial agreements

575

        be written out

        would take place.

581
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,239
Yeah, well, I think
that's not really fears.

582
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:59,176
I think that's just
more of, you know,

583
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,678
listing the pros
and cons

584
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:04,114
and kind of--
it's the whole idea

585
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:09,553
of whether marriage
is going to dictate

586
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,956
that our identities
are lost.

587
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,492
That's kind of
my main fear.

588
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,593
            I'd still support

589
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,594
            keeping
            our own identities.

590
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,164
            I mean, marriage is
            just a--kind of like

591
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,231
            a social title
            we would have,

592
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,299
            but we'd still have
            our own identities.

593
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,300
Yeah.

594
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,336
            Of course. I would
            insist upon it.

595
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,307
    I mean, Dave has--has been
    through a lot with me,

596
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,811
    and he's still around,

597
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:40,918
    and that to me is definitely
    evidence of--of love.

598
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,954
Dave: I love it when she shows
me physical, um, appreciation,

599
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:50,561
when she holds me, hugs me,
kisses me, smiles at me.

600
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:54,031
I always love it when she comes
to tuck me into bed at night.

601
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,401
But I feel like she puts me very
high up on her daily list.

602
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,837
I feel like I'm very much
    important to her

603
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,706
    and that I'm a big part
    of her life.

604
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:08,145
    But the T score also
    ties in very much

605
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,581
    to how important
    that person makes you feel.

606
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,382
    If you don't--if you get
    the impression

607
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,318
    that person doesn't think
    you're important,

608
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,153
    that hurts your T score.

and first meeting her,

        [Music playing]

632
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,183
        Man: When Stephen
        first saw Gita,

633
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,418
    he was introduced to her.

634
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,788
    Stephen said,
    "I'm going to marry her."

635
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,857
        [Laughter]

636
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,193
And after a few days, Gita said,
    "Let's set a date."

637
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,896
        [Laughter]

638
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:09,166
    Well, the date is here,

639
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,735
    and this is the couple,

640
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:15,672
    and we hope that
    this marriage is from God.

641
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,743
It's going to be a lasting
marriage and a happy marriage.

642
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,546
    Stephen, voice-over:
    I met Gita 20 years ago.

643
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:27,217
    It was on February 7, 1993.

644
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,252
            Matt: What day of
            the week was that?

645
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,120
    It was on a Sunday.

646
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,255
            What did you say
            to her

647
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,189
            when you first
            met her?

648
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,590
    "Hello."

649
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,695
        And what did you think
        when you first met her?

650
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,031
It's nice. It was beautiful.

651
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,836
            Are you in love
            with Gita?

652
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,705
Yes, I'm in love with Gita.

653
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,740
            What does that mean?

654
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,341
I don't know.
It means to fall in love,

655
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,744
to give a kiss
and a hug.

656
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,015
            How do you know
            when you're in love?

657
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,716
I don't know.

658
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:13,196
        Max: Somebody suggested
        they knew of Gita.

659
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,765
        They said, "Maybe
        these two together--

660
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:15,966
        "these two will
        get together.

661
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,703
        Maybe they'll make--
        they'll make a couple."

662
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,406
Edith: They were kind of
complementing each other.

663
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:27,344
Gita is very verbal.
That's what Stephen is lacking.

664
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,714
Stephen has other qualities
that she was lacking,

665
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:36,553
so they really
complemented each other.

666
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:41,758
        Max: They lived happily
        for almost 17 years,

667
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:45,329
        and then unfortunately,

668
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:49,066
        Gita got ovarian cancer,

669
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,502
        and she's fighting with
        it for the last 3 years.

670
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,905
Remember 3 years ago,
Gita had chemo?

671
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,140
3 years ago.

672
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,141
        Matt: What is chemo?

673
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,044
I don't know.
It's a disease.

674
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:03,914
                Is that bad?

675
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,515
It's bad.

676
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,320
            So, what happened
            after chemo?

677
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,388
I don't know.

678
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,389
She went to the doctor.

679
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:17,194
She went to the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester.

680
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,362
            What happened there?

681
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,563
Uh, she had to go--

682
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,232
yeah, she had tests
for her cancer.

683
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,101
She had tests.

684
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,571
            And what did
            the tests say?

685
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,174
Uh, her condition
is, uh, I don't know.

686
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,487
Edith, voice-over:
Stephen is very hopeful

687
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,423
about her sickness.

00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,425
He says, "Gita's
not gonna die.

689
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,293
She'll be all right."

        Hi, Marlena.

00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,741
    I feel a little better.
    I'm getting better.

                Hello.

    Gita, voice-over:
    The thing with Stephen

697
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:16,119
        is that he is...

698
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,589
        I find that
        he understands me

699
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,992
        in his own way.

700
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:33,870
    I have a learn--a mild
    learning disability,

701
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:40,277
    and, um--ahem--
    so but still and all,

702
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:45,048
    I feel in a way that
    I can understand him

703
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:49,920
    because he can--because
    we both have something

704
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,323
    we cannot do
    and things we can do,

705
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:57,694
    but being that
    we have disabilities,

706
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,263
            we can...

707
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,799
    we can relate all the more.

708

is new.

710
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:11,475
Nothing? Well,
I--I relaxed all day...

711
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,576
            That's good.

Yeah.

715
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,982
    I don't know if this is
    the right thing to say,

    not able to express himself,

        as if he can,

720
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,698
    He has improved a lot.

721
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:35,999
How was your day?

722
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,100
            It was excellent.

723
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,535
What did you do?

724
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,569
            Well, I worked--

725
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,972
            I worked on towels
            today at MBI.

726
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,807
Towels? What do
they look like?

727
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,175
            Well, they look
            like, uh--

728
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,776
            they look like
            wash towels.

729
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,345
                They look like
                dish towels.

730
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,114
Oh, nice.
What colors were they?

731
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,516
            They were purple.

732
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,018
Oh, nice. What's
your favorite color?

733
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,253
                Blue.

734
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,756
Blue. And my favorite
color is red.

735
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,857
            Well, that's nice.

736
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,226
            You have a nice hat,
            huh?

737
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,129
Yeah. Just look at me.

738
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,998
                    Yes.
Relax.

739
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,866
    It's always difficult.

740
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:14,271
    It's always difficult,
    but I got used to it.

741
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,106
    I got used to it.

742
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:20,844
It's extremely difficult,
but I think if I were married

743
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:27,951
    to someone who it--
    wasn't disabled

744
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,154
    or who isn't disabled,
    I'd have more of a problem

745
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:38,361
because that person might
be--be--ahem--demanding

746
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:42,499
    and want more out of me.

747
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,401
So tell me more.

748
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,136
            Well, I'm going to
            eat dinner

749
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,537
            at my parents'.

750
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:48,572
Oh, that's good.

751
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,606
            Well, I hope
            you'll feel better,

752
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,907
            and I'll see you
            later.

753
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,609
See you later,
honey.

754
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:56,146
Thanks for dropping by
and wishing me well.

755
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,815
                You're welcome.

756
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,816
            Matt: How do you
            know that Stephen

757
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,651
            is in love with you?

758
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,254
        Gita: Um...

759
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,891
        it's in the way
        he looks at me.

760
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,260
        I can tell.

761
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:13,430
        He gives me
        such loving eyes.

762
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,653
    Dave: Love is a very
    abstract concept

763
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:39,489
that many people with autism
have a hard time grasping,

764
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,292
and it's one of those things
that's not concrete.

765
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,998
As a scientist, I wish I could
put it into perspective

766
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,134
as a type of subatomic particle,
        but it's not.

767
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,604
    Love is basically
    more like a force.

768
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,042
        Like, in physics,
        you have forces--

769
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,878
    forces of attraction--
    and I have a feeling

770
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,880
    that love is--the best way
    to describe that

771
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,883
    is a force of attraction
    between two people

772
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:12,622
    that is neither visible,
    measurable, or heard.

773
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,258
There's no way to quantify it.

774
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,145
    Lenny: I'm feeling a little
    down about myself right now.

775
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,413
Matt: Why is that?

776
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,614
    I've just been down lately.

777
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,816
    I've been a little...

778
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,353
    sometimes you go through
    hard times in your life.

779
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,492
    I feel like I can't
    get a girl.

780
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,996
    I don't--there are
    no girls at my school.

781
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,998
    Everywhere I go,
    it's something about guys.

782
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,934
    I go home,
    I see my stepfather,

783
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,771
    and the only women I see
    are my good friends

784
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,973
or my--my--my sister, like,

785
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,442
        girls are sort of
        like my sisters

786
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,245
    or my home girls,
    and that's so annoying.

787
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,047
    You don't see women
    anywhere.

788
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:14,084
    It's like--I feel like
    if someone came up to me

789
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,187
and said, "Would you--would you
want to go to a women's prison

790
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,557
    for a week?" I would
    probably say yes.

791
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,126
    "Would you--would you go
    to a women's jail for a week

792
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,227
    and be the only man there?"

793
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,429
    I'd probably say yes.

794
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,242
Lenny, voice-over: I feel like,
you know, if I had a girl,

795
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,944
    maybe--maybe I'll be
    happy right now.

796
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,813
    Maybe I'll be--
    feel good about myself.

797
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,352
    You know what, Matt?

798
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,720
        I'm gonna admit
        something to you.

799
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,155
    Do you want me
    to tell you something?

800
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,491
    I like girls that are black.

801
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,027
    I like them a lot.
What do you think about that?

802
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:05,068
Do you know what interracial--
interracial relationships are?

803
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,138
    Inter--interracial
    relationships?

804
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:12,575
It means when different race
people go out with each other.

805
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,978
    I was reading something
    on the computer

806
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,480
            that...

807
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,650
    black women are really
    independent,

808
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,585
    and it said that
    they're lucky girl--

809
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,788
    that they're really
    intelligent women,

810
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:28,024
and I feel like that, you know,
I want a girl like that,

811
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,126
    but I feel like I can't.

812
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,062
Matt: Why do you think
you can't?

813
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,099
    Because, you know,
    they're too independent.

814
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,967
        I need to be more
        independent.

815
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,404
    I need to get a good job
    and make good money.

816
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,551
    Dave, voice-over: You get
    married for love, too,

817
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,520
but for me, there's more of
a practical component as well.

818
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:01,057
    Probably 60% practical
    and 40% emotional.

819
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,593
    I'll always love her.
    That won't change.

820
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,396
    But for the specific
    reasons for the marriage,

821
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,998
that's what it'd boil down to.

822
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:17,040
    Lindsey, voice-over:
I had told him a few years ago

823
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,642
    that whenever he was ready
    to take that next step,

824
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:25,281
    that I would be
    willing to--to accept.

825
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:33,857
    I've--I've yet to hear
    any kind of indicator

826
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,326
    that that next step
    may be taken.

827
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,928
        Um, I know that we kind
        of brushed over this,

828
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,030
        like, when we chatted
        about it.

829
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,132
        I do believe you
        and trust you

830
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,034
        when--when you've
        told me that

831
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,302
        you were in it
        for the long haul.

832
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,403
Oh, yeah.

833
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,238
        And I do believe you,
        and I do--you know,

834
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:26,075
        I do trust you,
        and I--I, um, you know,

835
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,044
        I definitely am in it
        for the long haul

836
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,513
        for us, too, and I--
        I wouldn't--you know,

837
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,616
        I wouldn't be here
        if I wasn't.

838
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:34,617
Well, I know that.

839
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,152
                Yeah.

840
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,828
        I guess I'm just--
        I was just still

841
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,364
        kind of just figuring
        out, like--

842
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,432
That was a conversation
that made me

843
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,401
a little bit
uncomfortable, too.

844
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,105
            Oh, you mean
            at the time?

845
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,006
Yeah, yeah.

846
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,841
        Yeah. Well, it's
        uncomfortable

847
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,811
        for me, too, but...

848
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,713
        it's important.

849
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:06,416
        It's important.
        Sometimes I think

850
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,851
        there's conversations
        that are uncomfortable

851
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,055
        for us, but they're
        really important

852
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:18,127
        to have or at least
        to address them

853
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,964
        in order to us
        to understand

854
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:24,167
        where each other
        are coming from.

855
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:27,604
        So I--I'm not gonna lie.
        So...

856
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,939
But having this on camera,
I don't like at all.

857
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,174
I don't like the idea
of having this conversation

858
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,775
on camera at all.

859
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,410
                OK.

860
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,546
It's one of those things
that's best left

861
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,381
off camera, I think.

862
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,749
            OK. We can stop
            talking about it.

863
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,284
Yes.

864
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,119
            All right.
            Thank you for--

865
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,220
            thank you for
            letting me know.

866
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,855
I think--yeah, I just
feel better that way.

867
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:46,856
                    OK.

868
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:47,857
I just feel
uncomfortable

869
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:48,992
being on camera
talking about it.

870
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:49,993
            All right.
            No, thank you

871
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,427
            for letting me know.

872
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,432
But you know how
I feel,

873
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,835
so don't worry
about it.

874
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,914
    Lindsey, voice-over:
    There's been times

875
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:18,321
that I have questioned whether
he really wants to be with me.

876
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,493
Gordon: Within yourself,
you think you can communicate.

877
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,794
        You think you've
        said something.

878
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,262
    You think it should be
    obvious to somebody

879
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,297
that's this, this, and this,

880
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:31,768
    but again you go back
    to the antenna.

881
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,537
Maybe you are, but maybe
they haven't picked that up.

882
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,461
Stephen, voice-over: Yes,
this is my apartment with Gita.

883
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,399
    Uh, this is our bedroom.

884
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,138
    It's beautiful, isn't it?

885
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:13,676
Gita moved here with me, uh--
    that was 15 years ago.

886
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:17,814
        [Door closes]

887
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,283
    And this is our bathroom.

888
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:26,889
Stephen, voice-over: She moved--
she had to go--she had surgery

889
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,225
        on--in May 2010.

890
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,895
    That was 3 years ago.

891
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,081
Stephen, voice-over: I'll take
a shower tonight at 7:00.

892
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,485
Edith: OK, maybe at 7:30
if you go later to Gita's.

893
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,488
        I'll go--I'll go see
        Gita right now.

894
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,289
I think they're
eating, still.

895
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,290
        They're eating--no,

896
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,258
        they're
        still eating dinner.

897
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,426
        They're eating dinner.

898
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:07,130
Yeah, because Erica
was making it late...

899
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,097
                Yes.

900
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,566
because Gita wasn't
feeling well.

901
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,935
        I hope Gita
        will feel better.

902
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,737
I hope so.

903
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,179
She threw up.

904
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,680
            She felt nauseous.

905
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:27,850
Yeah. Did she
tell you that?

906
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,752
            Yeah, she told
            me that.

907
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,820
When you were there?

908
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,255
                Yes.

909
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,839
     I'm trying--I'm trying
     to be positive, man.

910
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,174
           I'm just--

911
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,075
   it's been kind of hard
   the past couple of weeks.

912
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:56,846
      Last week I did
      something to a girl,

913
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:58,214
      and it wasn't right.

914
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:02,385
  It felt--it felt
  kind of stupid, what I did.

915
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:07,423
  I was bored. I wanted to see
  what women felt like.

916
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:10,526
 It felt good for a little bit.

917
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:13,863
  Maybe for, like, 20 minutes
  it felt good, but it just

918
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:15,364
        felt like you--
        two things.

919
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,301
    It felt like you wanted
    to do it more times,

920
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:20,203
     but it just felt like
     whatever at the end

921
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:21,938
       because it just--
       that wasn't--

922
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,873
    I don't--
    I don't know that girl.

923
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,308
       I don't--
       I don't love her.

924
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,510
         I just--
         it felt like,

925
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:30,546
     I kind of felt bad for
     her a little bit.

926
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:35,518
   People told me that--
   I talked to 2 or 3 people.

927
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,154
      [Whispers] I kind of
      want to say it

928
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:39,455
    when there aren't
    that many people around.

929
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:41,757
I kind of want to say it softly
because it isn't good.

930
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:44,393
  People tell me that, "Oh"--

931
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:46,262
    p-people, they tell me,
    "Oh, you got ripped off

932
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:47,663
  for just touching her ass."

933
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:50,299
   People told me that "you
   could have gotten a ha--"

934
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:53,469
    People told me that I
    could have gotten a ---.

935
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,104
     People--you know
     what this stuff means?

936
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:57,273
   People told me that
   I could have gotten a ---.

937
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,242
     People told me that I
     could have gotten--

938
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:01,210
        could have ---.

939
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:06,282
      People told me that
      I could have...

940
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:09,085
          had --- her.

941
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,320
  That's what people told me--

942
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,522
        those 4 things,
        People told me

943
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:16,425
  people told me that I could
  have done those 4 things

944
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:19,328
   with--with the 20 bucks,
   that "you got ripped off"

945
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,098
    and "delete her number."

946
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,800
     She told me
     her name was Diamond.

947
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:28,704
   That--that doesn't sound
   like a real name, does it?

948
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,419
Dave, voice-over: I've been
together with her for 8 years,

949
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,587
    and a lot of people
    are wondering,

950
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:47,056
"Why are you still
just boyfriend/girlfriend?"

951
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,057
A lot of people are asking,

952
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,558
    "When are y'all
    gonna get married?"

953
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,629
That's, um--that's always a big
step for a guy to take,

954
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:57,466
    and got to make sure
    it's the right one.

955
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,866
    When we talked about it,
    she made me feel like,

956
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,401
"Oh, I do want to marry you,

957
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,971
    but maybe now's
    not the right time."

958
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:36,005
    That's--it's not likely,

959
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:38,374
    but it's possible
    she might say that.

960
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:43,846
Uh, I--sometimes what she thinks
is different from what I think,

961
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:45,114
            so...

962
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:50,086
    Lindsey, voice-over:
    I think before I said yes,

963
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,756
    I'd want to ask him...

964
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:58,227
    what in particular
    had been holding him back

965
00:49:58,229 --> 00:50:00,830
    the past few years,

966
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:04,166
    since when I first
    brought it up.

967
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:10,106
Gordon: Nobody was exactly at
the same place at the same time.

968
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:12,808
I hope, for her sake, that--
that they will eventually

969
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:16,412
    make a--a firm and formal
    commitment to each other.

970
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:18,781
    OK, maybe it's just
    a few simple words

971
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:19,849
    or something like that.

972
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,484
    Maybe it's just a little
    formal ceremony,

973
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:23,386
    something like that,
    but it means something.

974
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:24,687
    It makes a difference.

975
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,557
It--it gives a base for someone
to feel self-confident

976
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,529
about giving everything of
themselves to the other person

977
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:37,833
    without restraint
    or without holding back.

978
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,537
But I think that's just one
    of the challenges

979
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:45,174
        that they've had
        to work through.

980
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,677
        [Indistinct]

981
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,853
        So do you still, um,
        continue to think

982
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,889
        about the future?

983
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:04,126
        Like next steps
        and stuff like that.

984
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:07,830
Well, I--I thought
we had that conversation

985
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:11,333
recently about how
I wasn't reading your mind

986
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:12,568
and I wasn't sure.
                    Yeah.

987
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,404
And then you--you
reassured me

988
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,974
that, um, you...

989
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:22,378
that I--I shouldn't
be worried about anything.

990
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,614
            Just I was gonna see
            if still--

991
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:26,615
            everything is still
            the case.

992
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:29,819
            Is that still
            the same thing?

993
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,424
            You wouldn't be
            hesitant

994
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,227
            to the idea of
            marriage, would you?

995
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:43,165
I don't think you've
ever been so candid

996
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,835
about this
conversation before.

997
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,670
I guess you've been
thinking about it.

998
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:48,537
            I have.

999
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:51,040
        [Chatter from
        other tables]

1000
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,144
Well, I--I'll be
honest with you.

1001
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:57,947
I think regardless,
I'm always going to be

1002
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:01,951
afraid of anything
that involves, um,

1003
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,419
major life transition.

1004
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:04,420
                Right.

1005
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:07,389
Right? And marriage
is one of them.

1006
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:08,524
            Is what? I'm sorry.

1007
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:09,825
Marriage is
one of them.

1008
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:11,861
            Yeah, it is.

1009
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:15,865
            We seem pretty
            happy, though,

1010
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:18,100
            as a couple,
            don't we?

1011
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:21,270
            We seem pretty happy
            as a couple, right?

1012
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:25,708
Well, the question
is, do we feel happy?

1013
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,311
                I do.

1014
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:34,183
I--I feel similarly.

1015
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,507
    Lenny: I am high class.

1016
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,776
        You know that?

1017
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,112
What? You calling me stupid?

1018
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,214
    I'll call you stupid.

1019
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,317
        You know what?
Let me tell you something, Matt.

1020
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,019
    I didn't know what
    the hell happened, man.

1021
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,921
    Let me just tell you
    what happened.

1022
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:15,491
    I wish I was not autistic.

1023
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,526
        There. I'm gonna
        say it right now.

1024
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,896
    I don't like it.
    It makes me different.

1025
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:21,997
        I don't like it.

1026
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:25,000
    I wish I could have
    been a normal person.

1027
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,001
    I wish I could have been

1028
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,671
    a normal, regular person.

1029
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:35,144
        My mom says,
    "Be autistic. Accept it."

1030
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,513
    I tried accepting it.

1031
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:38,981
        It's hard.

1032
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,120
    Can I be honest with you?

1033
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:46,188
If I could change something--
        if I could--

1034
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:47,256
I'm gonna try to change it,

1035
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:48,390
    but I told my mom this
    right now

1036
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,192
    because of how
    disappointed I was.

1037
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,896
        I would rather be
        a normal man

1038
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,865
than be an autistic person
with a million dollars.

1039
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:00,069
There. If God came up to me
and says, "What do you want?"

1040
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,604
    I don't want to be
    autistic anymore.

1041
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,572
    I wish you can give me
    a new li--me.

1042
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,175
I could start my life all over
again and I wasn't autistic.

1043
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,444
        There. Let me be
        a normal person.

1044
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,679
I bet you all the damn people
I knew in middle school

1045
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:14,083
and high school, they're all
in fricking college now.

1046
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,985
    I'm not in college.

1047
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:17,953
    That's what I wanted
    when I was in high school.

1048
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:21,490
I dreamed of going to college,
and I'm not in college.

1049
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:30,266
I wanted to go to college.
I wanted to go to college!

1050
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:34,270
I don't--I think now I should
have graduated college!

1051
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,074
    I should have been
    in college right now.

1052
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,377
        I should have
graduated college right now.

1053
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,112
    I know so many people
    that went to college,

1054
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,514
and they're done right now.

1055
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,116
    I can't hang out
    with people like that.

1056
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,350
            I can't.

1057
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:49,518
Matt: Why not?

1058
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:52,421
    Because they're higher--
    they're higher than me.

1059
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:58,260
    Look. They're up here.
    I'm down here.

1060
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,864
    They're--I'm all
    the way down here.

1061
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,999
    They're all the way up here.

1062
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,469
    That's what I think.

1063
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:35,831
Lenny: I want to get a girl

1064
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,966
that's kind of lower than me.

1065
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,770
    That's what I want.

1066
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,179
    If I found a girl that
    had a job, had a car,

1067
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,848
    had her own home,
    I can't be with her.

1068
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,050
    She deserves to be with
    somebody better than me.

1069
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,219
She's up here. I'm down here.

1070
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,556
    That's the way I see it.
    It's hard, man.

1071
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:03,125
    It's really hard
    to accept it, man.

1072
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,875
    Yeah, this is--
    this is hard, man.

1073
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,114
        This is tough.

1074
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,684
    This is--this is probably
    one of the hardest things

1075
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,420
    I have to go through
    in my life.

1076
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:34,022
    Don't cry, man. Let me cry.

1077
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,625
    I don't want to see
    a tear come out of your eye.

1078
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,160
        It's hard.

1079
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,868
        What do you think
        about me crying?

1080
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,570
    What do you think the peop--

1081
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:51,106
    the viewers could think
    about this?

1082
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,715
            [Crying]

1083
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:11,960
        It's emotional.

1084
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:14,430
    I can't let that happen.

1085
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:18,100
I got no job. I got no car.

1086
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:21,470
I'm living with my parents.

1087
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,972
I should be doing something.

1088
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:36,051
I'm a good person, man.
I'm not a bad person, Matt.

1089
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,488
        I'm a good guy.
        That's just--

1090
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:44,092
    It hurts. It hurts, man.

1091
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:53,202
    He once told me that...

1092
00:57:53,269 --> 00:58:00,509
    that, um--he said, "You ever
    walk into a room...

1093
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,644
    and you know everybody's
    talking about you?"

1094
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,346
    And he said that's how
    he feels every day

1095
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,782
    when he leaves
    the house, you know?

1096
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,684
            So, um...

1097
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,254
    I just want my son
    to be happy.

1098
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:18,427
    And, um, I think he needs
    to come to terms

1099
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,996
        with who he is

1100
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:25,334
    because he's not comfortable
    with who he is,

1101
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:26,835
    and if he's not
    comfortable with who he is,

1102
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,738
    I don't know how he could
    ever expect anybody else

1103
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,140
        to be comfortable
        with who he is.

1104
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,136
    Stephen, voice-over:
    I feel sad about Gita.

1105
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,205
    She died last April.

1106
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,876
    She had cancer. That's sad.

1107
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:17,052
    She was laying down.
    She was laid to rest.

1108
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:24,459
    I miss Gita. I miss Gita.

1109
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,730
When Gita died, we went

1110
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,601
to the--to work
to tell him.

1111
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:36,305
It was on a workday,
and he was there,

1112
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,607
and when I told him,

1113
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:41,643
he just turned white
like a sheet.

1114
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,682
He put his head
down on the table.

1115
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:50,285
I could tell
he was very upset.

1116
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,088
She was gone.

1117
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:56,358
Matt: Do you feel like

1118
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,126
you're still
in love with Gita?

1119
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,395
    No. I stop loving
    someone--they die,

1120
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,396
        because they die,

1121
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:04,533
        because Gita died
        on April 9.

1122
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,703
    No longer in love.

1123
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,123
        Max: It is a big help
        for him to go back--

1124
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,258
        go back to work.

1125
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:36,064
Edith: We encouraged
him to pick up life

1126
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,433
like...

1127
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,003
normal, sort of.

1128
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,340
    Stephen, voice-over:
    I fell in love with Gita

1129
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,743
    for the past 20 years.

1130
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,481
    And then gave--I gave
    Gita a hug.

1131
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:56,151
    I gave Gita a hug.

1132
01:00:56,219 --> 01:01:00,155
I--I put my arms around her.

1133
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,602
    Dave: In physics, we have
    something called

1134
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,870
    electromagnetic spectrum--

1135
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,405
        how much energy
        a wavelength has.

1136
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,373
You go from radio waves to light

1137
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,876
    to ultraviolet,
    x-rays, gamma rays.

1138
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,414
    And then how I feel
    towards someone

1139
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:26,715
is kind of on a similar scale.

1140
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:30,819
You have different wavelengths

1141
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:33,455
going from just physical lust,

1142
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,023
    then you go--graduate from

1143
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,192
    a general interest
    in the opposite sex.

1144
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,162
Then you graduate from having
a specific intense crush

1145
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:42,631
    on a specific person.

1146
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,036
    Dave: And after that,
    it kind of evolves into

1147
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,539
    another stage, which is
    the true love stage

1148
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:54,976
and not having that deep crush
where you're thinking about her

1149
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,378
    24/7 and you have
    a hard time sleeping

1150
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,013
    because you're so much
    in love with her,

1151
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:01,083
but it kind of graduates
into a more subconscious form.

1152
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,451
    Let's say you're going
    from light waves

1153
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,586
that you can basically see
to ultraviolet waves.

1154
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,555
    They're still there,
    but you can't see them.

1155
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:09,257
    But they're stronger.
    Is that making sense?

1156
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,334
Lindsey: Are you sure
that was--

1157
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,535
are you sure that was
the spot

1158
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,104
where we did
that photograph?

1159
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,105
            I want to say
            it was taken

1160
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:24,706
            somewhere
            around here.

1161
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,584
            Very--this is
            nostalgic, isn't it?

1162
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,654
            Almost 8 years ago.

1163
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,592
            It's always amazing
            when you look back

1164
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:47,496
            in time, how things
            have grown and how

1165
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,531
            our relationship
            has grown

1166
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,600
            and what we've
            been through

1167
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,869
            has been really
            amazing.

1168
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,403
            That says something
            when you go

1169
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,339
            for a relationship
            that long,

1170
01:02:57,406 --> 01:03:00,475
            that is a very
            strong signal

1171
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,377
        that the relationship
        is meant to be.

1172
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,213
        And at first, um, you
        were kind of confused

1173
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,048
        as to where
        we were headed,

1174
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,784
        and I remember
        you telling me

1175
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,286
        you were--you would
        have been totally happy

1176
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,320
            just pursuing
            your career

1177
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:13,989
            and being a single
            woman,

1178
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:14,990
            and then...

1179
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,125
Remember that slide
you kind of show

1180
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,994
on your presentation--

1181
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,629
is it the
physics-related slide?

1182
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:21,963
            Yes. Yes.

1183
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,098
Where you have...

1184
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,099
            the wavelengths.

1185
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,401
The alpha and the beta
and the gamma?

1186
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,402
            And the delta.

1187
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,171
The delta.

1188
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:34,176
And I think how I
viewed our experience

1189
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:37,946
and our adventure
together

1190
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:41,616
is that our wavelengths
might have been different

1191
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,018
at different times--

1192
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,853
        It was a mutual thing.

1193
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:47,656
And I think

1194
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,191
having those different
wavelengths

1195
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:52,227
at different times
may have been

1196
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:55,263
a significant
reason why

1197
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:59,034
we both may have
struggled

1198
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,436
to...

1199
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:07,442
really understand where
we may be seeing ourselves

1200
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,677
in the far future.

1201
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:09,678
        But now I feel like

1202
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,546
        our wavelengths
        are in sync.

1203
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,716
I feel like
we've grown.

1204
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,184
                We have.

1205
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:20,555
And I want to
only go

1206
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,324
by what's in here...

1207
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,459
            Absolutely.
            In here, too.

1208
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,827
and what's in here.

1209
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,063
            And trust me,
            it's in here.

1210
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,966
            It's in here

1211
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,268
            and always will be.

1212
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,269
            And I say that

1213
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:36,504
            from the bottom
            of my heart.

1214
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,247
            [Sigh]

1215
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,649
[Laughs and cries]

1216
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,152
            And it's OK to blush
            if you want to,

1217
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:56,491
            but, um, understand
            if you do.

1218
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,493
            But, uh, this has
            been a remarkable

1219
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:03,765
        journey, and somebody
        as beautiful as you

1220
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,867
        deserves the very best

1221
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,370
        and a life of happiness
        together.

1222
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:14,509
        And I would very much
        be honored...

1223
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,912
        to have you as my wife.

1224
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,584
        Will you marry me?

1225
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,635
Yes, I will marry you.

1226
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,179
            There you are.

1227
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,686
            That's why I wore
            my vest--

1228
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,487
            to conceal that.

1229
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:03,458
I--I was wondering
about that.

1230
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,196
            But definitely
            in the delta region

1231
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,998
        where it's true love.

1232
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,767
        That's the wavelength
        we're both in.

1233
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:28,650
        "Your task is not
        to seek for love

1234
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:32,220
    "but merely to seek
    and find all the barriers

1235
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:36,891
    within yourself that
    you have built against it."

1236
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:39,961
    That quote really
    resonates with my life.

1237
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:47,969
    All the negative things
    that I heard on autism

1238
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:54,509
growing up, it definitely made
me feel worthless or less.

1239
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:01,649
    I had consistently
    set up barriers

1240
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:04,119
    to protect myself.

1241
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:11,192
It's very easy to not feel like
that you can trust people.

1242
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:23,271
    I thought that perhaps

1243
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:28,443
    Dave was holding back
    more than I was.

1244
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:34,582
    But what I discovered
through a lot of introspection

1245
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:39,421
    is that I was really
    holding back, too.

1246
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:00,375
    Alex Trebek: This
    author's losing entry

1247
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:03,111
    in a 1948 literary
    contest--

1248
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,846
Who was Arthur C. Clarke?

1249
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,347
        Alex: ...2001? Lars.

1250
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,348
    Lars: Who is Clarke?

1251
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,417
    Alex: Arthur C. Clarke.
    You are right.

1252
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:11,653
    Lars: U.S. Cabinet, 200.

1253
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,854
    Alex: Which Cabinet
    department,

1254
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,824
    the Transportation
    Security Administration...

    Lenny: I'm gonna throw
    a penny in the water,

1256
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,862
        make a wish.

1257
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,468
    When I make my wishes,
    I make it clear

1258
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:29,704
that I don't tell anybody, OK?

1259
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,005
Hey, by the way, there's
some more ducks over there.

1260
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:33,575
    Why don't you go
    film them all over there?

1261
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:51,192
    Lenny: Got one minute
    left, by the way.

1262
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,495
    When that one minute's
    over with, I'm gone.

1263
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:56,865
    I got to go back.
    I like to get there early.

1264
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,568
        I don't know.
    It's kind of fun doing this.

1265
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,007
        6 weeks I've been
        working here at Flora.

1266
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:09,410
    Here. Here's your--here's
    the one right here.

1267
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:13,681
    A famous person that had
    a job like this

1268
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:14,749
    when he was a young man
    was Kurt Warner.

1269
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,783
    You don't know who
    Kurt Warner is?

1270
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,318
    He's the--he's
    the football player--

1271
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:21,356
he's the quarterback who played
for the Rams a long time ago.

1272
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,024
    You don't remember how
    that Super Bowl happened

1273
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:24,959
    where it was the last
    second on--

1274
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,328
    they were one yard
    short of winning it?

1275
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,397
    Well, he was the quarterback
    of that winning game.

1276
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,966
    All right. I got
    to go back now. Sorry.

1277
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,736
        Got to go.

1278
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,871
    Sorry. Got to go back now.

1279
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:43,511
    I'm back now. May I have
    a drink of water, please?

1280
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:47,882
                    OK, ready?
            OK.
