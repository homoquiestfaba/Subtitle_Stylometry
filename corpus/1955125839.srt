1
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,297
Mmmm...

2
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:47,106
Show balls.

3
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:50,709
Later, guy.

4
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,349
Haven't seen you
on here before.

5
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:04,587
Can we see your legs?

6
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,459
Not much to see.

7
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,300
Ah, fuck...

8
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:26,337
Oh, shit. Fuck me...

9
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:33,309
I'm gonna cum, guys.

10
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,747
Ah!!!

11
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,402
Are you ready
for your five minutes?

12
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:13,872
I guess by now it's clear
I have a major problem.

13
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:17,075
I have a serious crush.

14
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:21,745
And I know I've said that
a million times before on here,

15
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:23,947
but this time it's different.

16
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:29,118
This time, it feels...
profound.

17
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,522
If only my rhetorical talents
extended beyond my fingertips,

18
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:36,458
maybe I could actually talk
to the boy in question,

19
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,426
but, ay, there's the rub.

20
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,761
For in that sleep of death,
what dreams may come,

21
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:44,364
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil?

22
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:47,734
Hamlet.
Senior year, high school.

23
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:50,870
Oh! He is a stripper,
by the way.

24
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:53,505
Or dancer,
of the go-go variety.

25
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:57,241
I actually saw him
again tonight,

26
00:03:57,243 --> 00:03:59,476
flaunting himself down Avenue A.

27
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:04,714
And if I weren't so drunk,
and such a pussy,

28
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:07,383
then I would have
stopped him and asked him,

29
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:11,053
"What is the difference between
a dancer and a stripper?"

30
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,488
Here, let me show you
what all the fuss is about.

31
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,023
Check out that epic ass?

32
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:17,724
Corn-fed.

33
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:20,526
I'd bet money on it,
If I had any money.

34
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,667
Here I am recording
this for posterities sake,

35
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,535
because God knows
that my chances of

36
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,471
remembering this
tomorrow morning are nil.

37
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:38,208
Now you are probably saying,
please no drunk posting.

38
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,276
You've already exposed
yourself to the world.

39
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:42,077
Isn't that enough for one night?

40
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,780
And to that I say,
No, God dammit.

41
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:51,018
I am a near college graduate,
so I do as I please.

42
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:57,089
Goodnight, fuckers.

43
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:07,398
Now this,
I will definitely regret.

44
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:17,907
Dear Mr. Go,

45
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:21,443
You're gonna think
I'm completely insane,

46
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:24,412
and you might be right.

47
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:26,514
I am a recent college graduate

48
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:32,119
interested in the field
of documentary filmmaking.

49
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:35,922
I've been researching
a theoretical idea

50
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:38,157
for a documentary on

51
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,126
the New York City
nightlife scene.

52
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:48,065
I would really love
to meet with you

53
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:52,669
in my search
for a subject/muse.

54
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:56,039
Uh...
Muse is too sexual.

55
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:00,175
Um... Fuck it.

56
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:03,011
Yours truly, Doc.

57
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,267
First of all...

58
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:30,504
I should've listened
to you guys/me,

59
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:31,872
and never drunk-posted.

60
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:34,274
But seriously,
you need to see what

61
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:36,442
"Jim from Chelsea" has to say.

62
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,811
Go-go, schmo-go.
Stripper, dripper.

63
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,946
As long as you post
a video of you fucking

64
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:44,616
said corn-fed ass,
who cares what you call him.

65
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:46,784
Better yet, invite me along

66
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:51,654
and I'll slam my grandpa sausage
into both your bums.

67
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:55,124
Really? Your grandpa sausage?

68
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:57,025
And that's just one of these.

69
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,559
You guys sure have plenty

70
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,327
that you're willing
to say anonymously.

71
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:04,763
It's a really supportive,
positive community we have here.

72
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:07,866
Now let me document
my imminent escape

73
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:10,801
from this shitty city
that we call New York.

74
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:16,239
Three weeks from today this will
no longer be my humble abode.

75
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:19,008
Post-graduate academia
has called me forth

76
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,543
to the wilds of fair Iowa.

77
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:25,513
Go-go God NYC...

78
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:26,747
What the fuck?

79
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,715
Sounds fun.
Come by my gig tonight.

80
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,349
I'll put you on the list.

81
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,184
Yours truly, Go.

82
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:35,586
Oh, my God,
what did I write?

83
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,554
...interested in
documentary filmmaking--

84
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,556
No, I did not!

85
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:44,360
I'd really love to meet you
in my search for a muse.

86
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:45,761
Fuck!

87
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,692
Assimilation must be the goal
of the queer community

88
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:21,361
if true equality
is ever to be won.

89
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:25,198
At least that's what I plan to
argue in my POLYSCI 323 final.

90
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,325
I'm not a hermit,

91
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:55,660
as my friends would
probably have you believe.

92
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:58,029
My problem is obsession.

93
00:08:58,031 --> 00:08:59,430
I am obsessive.

94
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,167
And the internet just
makes it so easy, doesn't it?

95
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,371
Forgot to tell you where.
Address is below.

96
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:10,673
And my digits
if you need to get me.

97
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,774
Go.

98
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:49,375
Just fucking do it.

99
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:54,246
Hi. I think I'm on the list.

100
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:55,880
There, that's me.

101
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:22,037
Hey, could I get
a whisky and soda?

102
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,104
Thanks.

103
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:31,504
Jesus fucking Christ.
Just go talk to the fucker.

104
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:02,933
Oh, shit. Sorry.

105
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:06,169
Umm, I didn't realize...

106
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:07,670
I didn't realize
you were in here.

107
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:10,038
It's cool, I'm done.

108
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,640
Nice hat.

109
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:14,908
Thank you. My mom...

110
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,676
Thank you, thanks.

111
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:39,096
Further proof
that I am a useless idiot.

112
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:42,698
And holy shit,
he is way hotter in person.

113
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,600
OK, this was crazy.
Not a good idea at all.

114
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:49,070
I'm a complete fucking idiot
for ever thinking that it was.

115
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,572
I'm getting out of here,
but for posterity's sake,

116
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:54,941
let's all agree that
I gave it my best shot?

117
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:56,008
Thanks.

118
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,376
Waited 4 you bi the bar -

119
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,112
with the number 4
and by spelled bi.

120
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,746
Sorry I missed U -

121
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,282
Followed by a winking
smiley face emoticon.

122
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,483
Oh, shit.

123
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:10,785
- Doc.
- Go.

124
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:13,087
- Bathroom crasher?
- Hi.

125
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,354
What's up?

126
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:16,589
Uh, nothing much.
How are you?

127
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:16,589
Good.

128
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:20,159
So... Is that the camera
that you're using?

129
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:23,762
Oh, my phone?
No I'll get a real one.

130
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:25,697
This is just
for prelim research.

131
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:28,466
So, it's pretty crazy
in there.

132
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,067
Where do you usually hang out?

133
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:33,937
Besides my bedroom
and lecture halls, nowhere.

134
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,039
Well, there's a dive bar
that my friends and I

135
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,974
go to sometimes
to get hammered...

136
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:39,709
$2 cans 'til 10.

137
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,143
That's sounds pretty awesome.

138
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,478
I guess you'd think
after four years in the city,

139
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,413
I would've been
to a gay bar, but...

140
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:47,782
- Oh, are you straight?
- No, not straight.

141
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:50,918
Just not "GAY," you know,
I don't really know the scene.

142
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,586
What's that thing?

143
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:56,156
It's like a stand, so I can
get us both in the shot.

144
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:58,458
Could you just
back up a little bit?

145
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,260
Yeah, like to, where that
piece of trash is.

146
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:02,594
Yep.

147
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:05,229
OK, well, hopefully this works.

148
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:11,166
- So, you're in film school?
- No

149
00:14:11,168 --> 00:14:13,268
I thought you said
you just graduated?

150
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,105
No, I haven't...
I haven't quite graduated yet.

151
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,307
Not for three weeks,
and not film school.

152
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:21,242
I'm just more into
movies and stuff.

153
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:22,643
I'm really more of a writer.

154
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:24,511
- Cool.
- Yeah.

155
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:28,681
So, uh...
What's this project about?

156
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:32,617
Uh, well, it's still
in its infancy right now.

157
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,652
I'm kind of just
sussing out the direction

158
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:36,487
that I want to take it.

159
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:38,956
I thought you said
it was about go-go dancing?

160
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,491
Yeah, potentially.

161
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:44,060
I don't know if you want your
image attached to something -

162
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:45,728
your long-lost family
out in the Midwest

163
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,862
knowing what you do here.

164
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:48,763
- California.
- OK, California.

165
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:49,930
I don't know if
you want them knowing

166
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,498
what you do here to get by.

167
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,033
So if you can't, then it's--

168
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:57,102
It's OK...
Count me in.

169
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,237
Um... Wow.

170
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:01,305
Would you mind just
saying that again?

171
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:02,773
Yeah, I don't mean
to be presumptuous.

172
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,274
but time is, time was,
you know?

173
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:05,241
Sure.

174
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:08,744
All right, let me
audition for you.

175
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:10,579
No, it's OK.
You don't have--

176
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:11,846
I'm not usually a stripper.

177
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:13,914
I usually start
with my clothes off, but...

178
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,283
No, you, you...

179
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,485
Uh...

180
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,153
Give me your hand.

181
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,588
Really, it's OK.
Wow, that's great.

182
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,089
I think I have seen enough.

183
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,691
I'd would love to use you
as the subject of my movie.

184
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,927
Yes! I've always wanted
my own personal Andy Warhol.

185
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,795
You mean the soup can guy?

186
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:35,296
How old are you?

187
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:36,497
Of course, Pittsburgh.

188
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,432
I went there on a field trip
when I was a kid.

189
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,100
So, when do we start?

190
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:42,134
I think we just did.

191
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:44,902
Cute dog, man.

192
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:46,003
Thank you.

193
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,207
So, is this thing gonna be
in film festivals or what?

194
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:54,143
Probably not. I think
they go for edgier stuff.

195
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:57,613
I don't know, it's the age
of overexposure, narcissism.

196
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,181
Everyone's just kind
of looking for their--

197
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:00,949
For their 15 minutes,
I get it.

198
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:03,251
Well, I'm not gonna
be killing myself,

199
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,220
but I think pretty much
everything else is on the table.

200
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:33,213
Guess what, friends...

201
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:35,882
I think I just found
my Executive Producer.

202
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:40,553
All dressed up, and a whole
world of places to go.

203
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:42,621
All my love, Grandma.

204
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:47,458
Thanks, Grandma,
for keepin' it old school.

205
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:51,027
Hey!

206
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:53,395
Better not fuck it up.

207
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:55,330
Oh, please. You borrowed
my Nano freshman year;

208
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,898
I haven't seen that thing since.

209
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:56,898
What are you doing?

210
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,936
Oh, um, I just thought I should
capture this part of my life.

211
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,138
- All right, I get it.
- Thanks.

212
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,073
Don't lose the lens cap, please.

213
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,508
Thanks, and good luck
on your six finals!

214
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,510
Ha, ha, ha. Don't rub it in!

215
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:12,945
Don't fuck it up. I'm not
going to commencement stag.

216
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,579
Have fun with your porno.

217
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:36,899
The great work begins.

218
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:57,218
Hello...

219
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,420
Go? Is that OK?
Can I call you Go?

220
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,455
<i>Go's cool.</i>
<i>Hey, I got a question.</i>

221
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:03,423
<i>An actor friend of mine</i>
<i>said I should ask</i>

222
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:05,091
<i>if there's any money</i>
<i>in this for me?</i>

223
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,892
Oh, um...

224
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:08,493
Uh...

225
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:10,695
Well, cash is pretty
tight right now,

226
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:13,164
but, um...

227
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,500
I don't know.
I hadn't really thought of that.

228
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:18,668
This is kind of more of
an experiment for me.

229
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,603
<i>Well, my friend said,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

230
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:23,205
<i>what if this thing blows up</i>
<i>and gets, like, really popular</i>

231
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:25,707
<i>and sells for, like,</i>
<i>a million dollars?</i>

232
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,508
No, yeah,
I know what you mean.

233
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,579
Uh, well, I could...
split any profits...with you?

234
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:34,581
I could cut you a percentage,

235
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,482
like, maybe three percent
or something.

236
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:38,450
We could do
a contract and everything.

237
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,051
<i>That doesn't</i>
<i>seem like very much.</i>

238
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,421
Well, it's just, I...
just bought all the supplies

239
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,556
and I'll be doing
all of the producing

240
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,358
and directing and shooting.

241
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,128
I could...
pay for your food...

242
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,497
while we're shooting,
and buy you metro cards

243
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,632
so you don't have
to pay for anything.

244
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,600
<i>OK, yeah, I get it.</i>

245
00:18:58,602 --> 00:19:01,135
<i>Let me talk to my friend</i>
<i>and get back to you, cool?</i>

246
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:04,037
- Yeah, OK, cool.
- <i>Right, catch ya.</i>

247
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:16,514
 This could
just be infatuation

248
00:19:16,516 --> 00:19:22,219
 Could last a day
or a year

249
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:28,024
 I know the danger
in rejection

250
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:33,696
 And from my mind
you appear

251
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:50,944
 And now I have
one final question

252
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:55,981
 Where is the place
I'd die to be?

253
00:19:55,983 --> 00:20:03,554
 Here with you...

254
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,890
Hola, followers.

255
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:09,292
I've been waiting
on pins and needles.

256
00:20:09,294 --> 00:20:11,694
Is that the saying?
Pins and needles?

257
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:14,763
For some reason that sounds
ridiculous to me right now.

258
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:18,799
Anyways, I've been patiently
awaiting Go's response,

259
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,867
about his decision.

260
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:22,568
And I just got this text.

261
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:26,304
What's up, Doc?
Come to the club tonight.

262
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:28,639
Before one.
Got some news.

263
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:31,741
Slightly cryptic, but let's see
what Mr. Go has to say.

264
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:05,772
Hey, what's up?

265
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:07,173
So, I'm glad you came.

266
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:09,108
I really wanted to
do this in person.

267
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,342
No problem.

268
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:12,944
So, I talked with my friend...

269
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:18,081
If you give me five percent,
I'll do it.

270
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,782
Dude, that's great!

271
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:20,516
- Yeah?
- Totally.

272
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:22,684
Fuck, that was too easy!

273
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:24,185
I should've asked for seven.

274
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:29,623
He's about half an hour late.

275
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,091
So I guess
he's on go-go boy time.

276
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,327
- What's up?
- Go!

277
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:36,695
- How are you?
- Good.

278
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:38,697
- Did I scare you?
- Kinda.

279
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,132
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's OK.

280
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,733
You been here a long time?

281
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,768
Um, no.
Just a few minutes.

282
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,569
All right, good.

283
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:52,040
- All right.
- All right.

284
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:54,509
You ready to
think about yourself?

285
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:57,178
As little as possible.

286
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Sure. Go for it.

287
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:01,782
Let's start with
a basic and easy one.

288
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:04,785
Where did your history
with go-go dancing begin?

289
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:07,454
When I first moved here,
was, like,

290
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,489
four or five years ago,
to New York,

291
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:13,892
and...I started dancing
at a strip club,

292
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:17,161
because I wasn't making enough
money at the other jobs I had.

293
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:19,696
But that only lasted
about two months

294
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:23,499
because it was, kind of like,
not a super, safe environment.

295
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:26,301
I just knew, like, all right,
this was a bad place to be,

296
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,236
so I stopped
dancing completely.

297
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:31,972
And then I got fired from
my other two jobs that I had.

298
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:33,540
I had a really good job.

299
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,842
I was working as a makeup
artist for, like, two years.

300
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:40,178
I got fired for, uh...
Well, whatever.

301
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,313
So basically,
I went to this other club

302
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:44,148
and they kept asking
me to work there,

303
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,582
to dance there.

304
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:47,584
And I finally was like,
sure, whatever,

305
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:49,052
I have nothing else going on.

306
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:51,254
So I did that,
and I just started getting

307
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:53,889
asked to do other gigs
all over the city.

308
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:56,591
So, yeah, I was like,
sure, it's fun, it's easy.

309
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:58,192
I get to hang out with people.

310
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:00,761
I'm actually kind of anti-social
so it forced me

311
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,964
to come out of my house
and, like, interact with people.

312
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:03,964
So it was good.

313
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:10,436
What is the relationship between
a go-go guy and his audience?

314
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:12,938
Talking to someone
or being genuine with them.

315
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,006
Giving them some sort of
personal expression

316
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:17,675
from yourself,
a wink or a smile,

317
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:21,345
or a handshake or a hug,
or a teabag or whatever.

318
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:22,446
You know what I mean?

319
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:24,848
I think it
makes people feel good.

320
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,183
Because obviously if they
are putting some of, like,

321
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:30,719
emotional need towards you
and you respond to that,

322
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,855
that makes them feel like
they've had some sort of...

323
00:23:33,857 --> 00:23:35,389
beneficial interaction.

324
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:40,192
I think the idea of someone
putting themselves on display

325
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:44,496
or putting themselves
in a voyeuristic expression

326
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:46,664
is what turns people on,

327
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,266
not necessarily
the actual person.

328
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:52,035
Because I've seen ugly
go-go boys make lots of money.

329
00:23:52,037 --> 00:23:54,604
I've seen ugly prostitutes
get awards,

330
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:56,138
so I don't think it
necessarily has to do

331
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,539
with what they look like.

332
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,541
So there are prostitute awards?

333
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:00,842
Yeah.

334
00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:03,044
And what's your favorite
part of your body?

335
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:05,112
Uh...

336
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,350
I like my brain.

337
00:24:10,352 --> 00:24:12,452
- You can't say that.
- Why?

338
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:14,487
I don't really...

339
00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:16,322
I don't really
look at myself like that.

340
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,425
What's your least favorite
part of your body?

341
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:21,626
Uh...

342
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,728
My penis, it's so small.

343
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,763
- Are you being serious?
- No.

344
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,197
It's really hard to gain weight.

345
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,432
I have to, like,
work really hard to gain weight.

346
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,767
so that's one thing
that I don't like;

347
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,002
my metabolism's really fast.

348
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:36,204
What if you don't feel like
being pawed at that night?

349
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:38,472
What do you do to
get yourself in the mood?

350
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:41,908
Uh, I guess...
just fake it until you feel it.

351
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:39,396
Ladies and gentlemen,

352
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:42,031
Welcome to the home

353
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:45,200
of New York's finest
boy on the box.

354
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:46,500
Here we go.

355
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:49,936
What's up?

356
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:51,337
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

357
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:55,440
You comin'?

358
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:02,346
Do you, uh,
want some water or anything?

359
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:03,447
OK.

360
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:06,149
All right.
Let's get you some water.

361
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:08,050
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

362
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:10,352
It's hot today, right?
Cheers.

363
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:12,454
Yeah, it's hot.

364
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:14,088
Do you like it
when it's hot outside?

365
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,422
Yeah, it's whatever.

366
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,657
It's a good excuse
not wear any underwear, right?

367
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,225
Yeah, I guess.

368
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:21,627
You want to see
the rest of the place?

369
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:23,028
Yeah, yeah, of course.

370
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,364
I need to see
your natural habitat, don't I?

371
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:28,733
So this is...
Santi's room.

372
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:30,735
He takes pictures.
He's really good.

373
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:33,804
This is a figurine that
I pulled out of his anus once,

374
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:36,039
'cause he sat on it,
and it got stuck.

375
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,207
- Oh.
- I'm totally kidding.

376
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:41,043
Sometimes when I think
things are funny, I don't laugh,

377
00:26:41,045 --> 00:26:42,878
so don't like, be offended.

378
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,247
I won't. I'll just keep
making sex jokes,

379
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:47,182
so I hope you're OK with that.

380
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:50,451
This is the eating
and hang out area.

381
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,218
And more random stuff.

382
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:55,620
What's that?

383
00:26:55,622 --> 00:26:58,689
That's for tattooing.
This is alcohol and green soap.

384
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:00,323
And this is my bedroom.

385
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:03,492
Oh, wow.

386
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:07,094
Are these your paintings?

387
00:27:07,096 --> 00:27:09,796
Yeah, I did all of these ones.

388
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,030
Is this you here?

389
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:12,664
That's a self-portrait, yeah.

390
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,165
You don't really
look like that though.

391
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,100
If you take LSD,
I'll look like that.

392
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:20,901
- I mean it's nice, but...
- Thanks.

393
00:27:23,237 --> 00:27:24,737
Apparently, I'm making a movie

394
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:26,939
about a painter,
who likes to dance.

395
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,041
I do both.
I'm extremely versatile.

396
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:32,744
- And, so...
- So, this is your room.

397
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:34,645
- This is my room.
- And your Elvis.

398
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:36,179
I'm a huge Elvis fan.

399
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:38,214
So you sleep with him
every night.

400
00:27:58,867 --> 00:27:58,866
This is awkward.

401
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:02,436
I've never had someone
film me eat something before.

402
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:04,871
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Actually it is.

403
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:06,839
I mean, I guess
if you're eating pussy.

404
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:08,307
And?

405
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:12,577
Probably better than pussy.

406
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:16,380
My friend was telling me
about class systems for, like,

407
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:18,115
different kinds of gays.

408
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:19,483
Like, gold star gays.

409
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:21,051
If you've had sex with a girl

410
00:28:21,053 --> 00:28:23,053
that means you're not
a gold star gay;

411
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:24,521
that means
you're a bronze gay.

412
00:28:24,523 --> 00:28:26,189
What's your medal?

413
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:28,891
I'm not sayin'.

414
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:30,659
- Really?
- Yeah.

415
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:48,675
Do you have a favorite part
of your body?

416
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:49,942
Did I already ask you that?

417
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:51,576
I said my brain.
You said I can't say that.

418
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:52,677
Oh, right, you can't.

419
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,011
Do you want
to change your answer?

420
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:57,146
Um...

421
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:00,048
You can have a favorite part
of your body.

422
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,517
- That's perfectly OK.
- I like my tattoo.

423
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,851
It's a snake.

424
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:05,919
It's supposed
to be your kundalini,

425
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:08,154
in a non,
very traditional way.

426
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:11,790
It rises up through your belly,
up to your head.

427
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,025
These are these microscopic
organisms from the ocean,

428
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:18,295
by this scientific artist,
named Ernest Haeckel.

429
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:19,963
They're just really beautiful.

430
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:22,899
And they look like floral,
but they are not flowers.

431
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:25,534
So I got those because I
thought they were really pretty,

432
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:26,902
and kind of vaginal.

433
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,571
They look like sex organs.
You know what I mean?

434
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:32,507
So I liked that...
Because they're pretty.

435
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:35,242
And then I have a fly,
because I'm the shit.

436
00:29:36,244 --> 00:29:37,477
Really?

437
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,111
No...

438
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:41,012
I just thought
it looked really trashy,

439
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:42,980
and I was attracted to that.

440
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,615
Do you think that there is
a part of your physical body

441
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,719
that people
are attracted to most?

442
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:51,988
Um... I think people
like personality.

443
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,691
Like...people that
interact with them.

444
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:59,194
And as a performer, you think
that's what they respond to?

445
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:02,096
Well, I mean,
which would you rather watch?

446
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:05,165
A baboon presenting
its anus all blown up and red,

447
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,666
or would you rather
watch a baboon

448
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:09,502
randomly eating, like,
salad in a corner?

449
00:30:09,504 --> 00:30:12,771
Like, obviously you are gonna
watch the sexual presentation

450
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:16,074
above the mundane one.

451
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:17,975
Not that I present my ass...

452
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:22,712
...so literally,
but you know what I mean.

453
00:30:22,714 --> 00:30:25,715
So can you maybe
walk me through

454
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:28,084
how you decide
what to wear every night?

455
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:30,719
Well, I guess it depends on
what party I'm going to,

456
00:30:30,721 --> 00:30:33,455
or what kind of event it is.

457
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,156
And whether or not
I'm going to be

458
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:37,224
flashing anyone my balls
or tea bagging.

459
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:40,393
So I guess that changes

460
00:30:40,395 --> 00:30:42,361
what type of underwear
you're wearing?

461
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:43,929
Yeah, 'cause some
you can just, like,

462
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,530
zip open
and your balls fall out.

463
00:30:45,532 --> 00:30:47,331
Others are just assless.

464
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,833
Can you show me
some of the options?

465
00:30:49,835 --> 00:30:52,368
I really like
this guy right here.

466
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,804
He, like, shows off
my nuts really good.

467
00:30:55,806 --> 00:31:01,075
And I like this one because
it's like barely anything there.

468
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:05,678
Sometimes I wear this guy
if it's, like, a pothead party.

469
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,747
Have you ever been dancing
and really uncomfortable

470
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:11,483
in what you're wearing
and it fucks up your vibe?

471
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:15,920
Yeah, I made this, like,
jockstrap out of mylar once.

472
00:31:15,922 --> 00:31:18,522
And it was, like,
shiny and, like, silver

473
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:20,657
and it was, like, scratching
the shit out of my legs.

474
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:22,291
So that was
really uncomfortable.

475
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:24,326
Do you have
a favorite or lucky pair?

476
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:26,828
Well, these ones always
make me look like I'm naked,

477
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,763
so that's pretty good.

478
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:33,200
So tonight I think I'm going
to wear this little gold number

479
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:36,169
just 'cause I'm feeling
a little extra flirty.

480
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:39,238
Lets everyone know
I've never slept with a woman.

481
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,107
Right. Gold...

482
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,374
Gold star gay.

483
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:46,043
Gold star gay, right.
I'm learning.

484
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:49,846
- That could work with the gold.
- Oh, yeah, totally.

485
00:31:49,848 --> 00:31:52,381
- Did you make that?
- I did make that, yeah.

486
00:31:52,383 --> 00:31:53,915
- So that's it.
- That's it.

487
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:56,517
All right, I think
I'm gonna go shower.

488
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,619
- I'm sorry.
- You can keep filming.

489
00:31:58,621 --> 00:31:59,653
You sure?

490
00:31:59,655 --> 00:32:01,788
Whatever helps you get
your rocks off, dude.

491
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,256
OK.

492
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:05,591
I mean, I'm naked in front
of people for money all the time

493
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,659
so if one person films me,

494
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,227
I'm not really
that concerned about it.

495
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:11,062
All right,
I'm gonna go shower.

496
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,597
You want to come?

497
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,698
What's up?

498
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:16,599
What's up?

499
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:24,540
- So, uh, hi, what's up?
- What's up?

500
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,975
Do you shave or trim
before you go out?

501
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:29,143
I, uh, use a buzzer.

502
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,245
Buzz my chest
and stuff like that.

503
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:33,580
Do you think some guys
like you to be hairy,

504
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:36,249
and some guys
like you to be soft?

505
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:38,317
I think for the most part
people just want to make sure

506
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,420
you have a big ass
or a big dick, or both, right?

507
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:43,989
I guess so, but they can't
even see your dick.

508
00:32:43,991 --> 00:32:45,957
Oh, I might show it
to them anyway.

509
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,792
Oh...

510
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:49,093
OK.

511
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:53,163
I feel like gay guys
like really hairless guys.

512
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:57,734
Some gay guys do,
like in Idaho or Ohio.

513
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,637
So Midwestern guys
like less hair,

514
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:04,139
but guys in New York
like furry--

515
00:33:04,141 --> 00:33:06,708
I feel like people
that tan like less hair

516
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,811
than like big furry bears
that are all white.

517
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:12,046
Look at you,
full of wisdom.

518
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:14,615
Is there a way that
you prefer your body hair?

519
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,283
Well, I guess it's not
really up to me,

520
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,350
because I'm not the one
with the cash and the fantasy.

521
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:22,420
So what else
do you do, to get ready?

522
00:33:22,422 --> 00:33:23,988
I basically just make sure

523
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:28,325
that I'm clean
and decent enough to touch.

524
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,774
So, what's your perspective
on this thing anyway?

525
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,242
I don't know.

526
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:50,377
Just you so far.

527
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:53,046
Aren't you supposed
to have like, an idea,

528
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:57,416
or some sort of, like, thesis
or something like that?

529
00:33:57,418 --> 00:34:01,519
Well, I figured I'd just try
to find a story in your story.

530
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:04,555
I was just gonna
go with the flow.

531
00:34:04,557 --> 00:34:07,057
That's cool.
I'm down with that.

532
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:09,292
I guess it's too late now
to turn back, right?

533
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:10,359
Yeah.

534
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:17,498
Ready, Doc?

535
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:22,669
Hey, guys, this is Doc.

536
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,871
He's making a movie
about me so be nice, OK?

537
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:26,272
What's up?

538
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:30,742
Great ass, by the way.

539
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:02,799
Whoa, buddy.

540
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:10,106
What really is in
a Crush Me slushy anyway?

541
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:26,698
OK, I'm all done.

542
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,866
Was that too quick?

543
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,237
Do you remember the first time
a man flirted with you?

544
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,972
Yes, I was three.

545
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,941
I was a very flirtatious child
so I would flirt with

546
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,776
lots of different kinds
of people,

547
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,911
like, women and men.

548
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:46,080
I was never, like,
scared or nervous about flirting

549
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:47,881
or anything like that.

550
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:50,083
I used to shove my hands down,
like, women's tops

551
00:39:50,085 --> 00:39:52,718
when I was, like, three,
in church.

552
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,088
What are you attracted to?
Like, what's your type of guy?

553
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,123
I like people that
communicate effectively.

554
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,824
That's a really big deal for me.

555
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:01,358
No, I mean physical.

556
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,893
Oh, it's like,
all over the board.

557
00:40:03,895 --> 00:40:05,360
I like everything.

558
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:21,834
What the fuck is all that?

559
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:23,435
Don't tell my trainer.

560
00:41:28,407 --> 00:41:29,607
Oh, God.

561
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:48,291
Have you ever had a boyfriend
that works at the club?

562
00:41:48,293 --> 00:41:49,892
Uh...no.

563
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:51,393
Why not?

564
00:41:51,395 --> 00:41:51,393
I don't know.

565
00:41:51,395 --> 00:41:54,596
I don't really trust other
people that work in nightlife.

566
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:56,264
But you expect them
to trust you?

567
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:57,565
I guess so.

568
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,433
It's a little bit
of a double standard, huh?

569
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:04,803
Is this...pretty typical?
Dinner time at 4 am?

570
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,237
Oh, yeah, for sure.

571
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:08,572
There's no way you could
eat like this every night.

572
00:42:08,574 --> 00:42:09,839
Yeah, why not?

573
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:13,441
I gained five pounds
just looking at food this late.

574
00:42:15,043 --> 00:42:16,676
Well, you gotta eat to live.

575
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:17,610
Says the Adonis,

576
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:20,112
as he ingests
2000 calories at 4 am.

577
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:23,982
Thanks.

578
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,387
Take off your clothes.

579
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:31,721
No. Shut up.

580
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:33,322
Start with your shirt.
Come on.

581
00:42:33,324 --> 00:42:35,590
No, I'm not going to
take my shirt off.

582
00:42:39,528 --> 00:42:41,028
Uh...no.

583
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,362
Your turn.

584
00:42:42,364 --> 00:42:44,297
You're shirtless for a living.

585
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:47,867
I'm shirtless for showering,
and doctors appointments.

586
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:52,637
Stop!

587
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,739
Come on, take it off.

588
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,974
Take off your shirt.

589
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,543
Come on.

590
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:07,749
Fine.

591
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:11,218
See, that wasn't so hard.

592
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,285
Yes, it was.

593
00:43:12,287 --> 00:43:16,222
So, you're like a middle-aged
lady in bed? Lights out first?

594
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:17,890
I don't know...

595
00:43:17,892 --> 00:43:19,324
I guess.

596
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:23,427
Yeah, the last time,
if I remember correctly,

597
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:24,928
the lights were off.

598
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,063
You really had
to think about that.

599
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:29,231
- It was a long time ago.
- How long?

600
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:31,233
I don't know. A while.

601
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:32,667
How long is a while?

602
00:43:34,136 --> 00:43:36,504
Eight months, maybe a year.

603
00:43:36,506 --> 00:43:38,372
What?
Are you fucking kidding me?

604
00:43:38,374 --> 00:43:40,941
I don't know, I'm content
with my online sex life.

605
00:43:40,943 --> 00:43:45,178
It's fast, easy...
clean.

606
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,747
I always assumed
I'd just wait 'til marriage.

607
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:50,182
Well, that's kind
of sweet, I guess.

608
00:43:50,184 --> 00:43:51,516
Yeah.

609
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:56,120
And I've been flirted
with precisely three times.

610
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:57,588
That you know of.

611
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,790
You're not exactly
perceptive about that stuff.

612
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:01,658
Guys are not interested.

613
00:44:02,826 --> 00:44:06,227
Damn, boy.
That ass must be so tight.

614
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:09,529
Wait a minute...
You're a virgin?

615
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:12,064
I mean, no.
I've had tons of oral sex.

616
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,498
Especially in high school,

617
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,700
and especially in my
senior year of high school.

618
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:18,169
I mean, unless you're
counting fingers,

619
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:20,905
because I have
topped and bottomed digitally,

620
00:44:20,907 --> 00:44:23,173
with varying degrees of success.

621
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:29,343
- Oh, my God.
- It's not funny.

622
00:44:29,345 --> 00:44:30,977
You're fucking adorable.

623
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:32,778
No, I'm just scared.

624
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,079
Scared of what?

625
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:35,513
Um...

626
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:40,617
Disease, pain, nudity,
commitment, poop.

627
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,619
OK, I think that's enough.

628
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:49,558
Truth or dare?

629
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,760
No, I think I'm OK with my...

630
00:44:51,762 --> 00:44:54,262
electronic representations
of you.

631
00:44:54,264 --> 00:44:56,163
Come on, even Andy
slept with his subjects.

632
00:44:56,165 --> 00:44:58,732
But our sex life
is perfectly healthy already.

633
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,102
Then we'll make love.

634
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:22,452
Hey.

635
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,355
You're adorable.

636
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:28,856
You're adorable...

637
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:30,257
You're adorable.

638
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:33,326
You want to shower first?

639
00:45:35,062 --> 00:45:37,963
- No, I like you dirty.
- OK.

640
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,540
You're a virgin?

641
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:56,245
Can I?

642
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:41,187
Give me that camera.

643
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,154
I don't know
if I want to film this.

644
00:47:18,156 --> 00:47:20,389
You wanted to see
where your movie went...

645
00:47:20,391 --> 00:47:22,457
Well, here it is.
It's in my bed.

646
00:47:23,892 --> 00:47:25,092
So what are you gonna do?

647
00:47:25,827 --> 00:47:27,727
You are really beautiful.

648
00:47:27,729 --> 00:47:29,161
Thank you.

649
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:09,497
Put it on me.

650
00:48:23,912 --> 00:48:25,512
Slow, slow.

651
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:26,846
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

652
00:48:26,848 --> 00:48:28,380
Just keep it there
for a minute.

653
00:48:31,717 --> 00:48:32,950
Oh, my God.

654
00:48:39,257 --> 00:48:40,457
Oh...

655
00:48:42,393 --> 00:48:44,127
Ah...

656
00:48:51,068 --> 00:48:52,434
Fuck.

657
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:58,462
When did you
lose your virginity?

658
00:49:58,464 --> 00:50:00,197
When I was 15.

659
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,631
Can you tell me about it?

660
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:04,300
It was a friend, he was 17,

661
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:07,703
and it was, like, on the night
of my 15th birthday.

662
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:12,106
And...I was, like,
really horny.

663
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:14,141
I had seen a few porns
and I was, like,

664
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,575
'All right,
I'm ready to do this.'

665
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:17,076
I mean,
it wasn't super great.

666
00:50:17,078 --> 00:50:18,977
It was really awkward,
and I was drunk.

667
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:21,412
And then the next day
were you excited?

668
00:50:21,414 --> 00:50:23,847
Um, I was just,
like, whatever.

669
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:26,316
Like, I got that done,
out of the way.

670
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:29,151
How many people
have you had sex with?

671
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,987
I don't know.

672
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:36,256
I tried to write a list before
and, like, lost count.

673
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:39,726
I'm sure its not that many,
but I mean, I don't know.

674
00:50:39,728 --> 00:50:41,561
I'm not gonna be, like,
oh, I'm so proud -

675
00:50:41,563 --> 00:50:42,929
I've only had sex
with five people,

676
00:50:42,931 --> 00:50:42,929
because I haven't.

677
00:50:42,931 --> 00:50:45,898
And I'm not going to be, like,
I'm so proud -

678
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,233
I've had sex with 500 people,
because I haven't.

679
00:50:48,235 --> 00:50:49,801
Do you think that people
that watch you dance

680
00:50:49,803 --> 00:50:52,069
want to...fuck you?

681
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:53,870
Some of them, I'm sure.

682
00:50:53,872 --> 00:50:55,338
Have you ever
thought about that?

683
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,306
- No.
- Really?

684
00:50:57,308 --> 00:50:59,675
Have you ever had cyber-sex?

685
00:50:59,677 --> 00:51:01,643
Whatever you're thinking,
I've probably done it.

686
00:51:03,046 --> 00:51:06,480
Do you think that
people use you as part

687
00:51:06,482 --> 00:51:09,516
of their personal sex life
via the internet?

688
00:51:09,518 --> 00:51:10,817
Yeah, people have told me

689
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:12,752
that they've jerked off
to pictures of mine.

690
00:51:12,754 --> 00:51:14,820
And I say, thanks, it's sweet.

691
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,655
What am I supposed to do -
jerk them off?

692
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,490
Oh, thanks.
That's awesome!

693
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,233
What's up?

694
00:51:32,235 --> 00:51:33,734
I don't know.

695
00:51:36,237 --> 00:51:38,538
- Should we turn the camera off?
- I guess so.

696
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,439
I just thought of
a really cool painting.

697
00:51:40,441 --> 00:51:42,274
- Don't forget it.
- I won't.

698
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:44,808
You're money's over there.

699
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:21,275
 Beautiful dreamer

700
00:52:21,277 --> 00:52:27,346
 Wake unto me

701
00:52:27,348 --> 00:52:35,086
 Starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee

702
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:40,023
 Sounds of the rude world

703
00:52:40,025 --> 00:52:44,860
 Heard in the day

704
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:52,134
 Lull'd by the moonlight
have all pass'd away

705
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:59,974
 Beautiful dreamer

706
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:07,247
 Awake unto me!

707
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:16,422
 Beautiful dreamer...

708
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:15,958
Well it seems odd to interview
myself for my own film.

709
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,294
But apparently,
I am to make a cameo.

710
00:57:19,296 --> 00:57:22,397
I'm not altogether
happy about that fact.

711
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:25,299
But...here we are.

712
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:31,371
I...honestly,
kind of feel dirty.

713
00:57:32,473 --> 00:57:34,106
Not in a good way.

714
00:57:34,108 --> 00:57:37,842
Maybe if Go's arms
were to be my forever home.

715
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,877
But they're not.

716
00:57:42,145 --> 00:57:45,780
So, here I am...
an amateur porn performer.

717
00:57:52,253 --> 00:57:53,987
Was it good for you?

718
00:57:58,525 --> 00:58:00,859
You know, you really
need to get laid more.

719
00:58:02,161 --> 00:58:03,828
I know.

720
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,864
If for nothing else,
then for the cause.

721
00:58:08,866 --> 00:58:11,066
Yeah? What's 'the cause?'

722
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:15,103
Well, every time we fuck
it's, like...

723
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:17,505
a political statement,
you know?

724
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:21,508
The mere act of us
penetrating each other,

725
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,311
is, like,
an exercise in freedom.

726
00:58:25,313 --> 00:58:27,446
And I don't know about you,

727
00:58:27,448 --> 00:58:30,382
but I like to exercise
my freedom as much as possible.

728
00:58:30,384 --> 00:58:31,883
I didn't know you
were so patriotic.

729
00:58:31,885 --> 00:58:33,951
The American flag on the
door didn't give it away?

730
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,487
You can't walk into
a gay bar, an event,

731
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:39,489
or even a neighborhood
without seeing a guy

732
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:42,492
dancing on a table
in his underwear, or less.

733
00:58:42,494 --> 00:58:44,594
You don't realize how
fucked up people think that is?

734
00:58:44,596 --> 00:58:45,828
That we're
unwilling to be bound

735
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,529
by their puritanical roots?

736
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,397
But why does everything
have to be about sex?

737
00:58:49,399 --> 00:58:51,665
Because that's what they've
reduced us to for centuries.

738
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:52,932
Just fucking.

739
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,168
So we defy them by being
exactly what they expect?

740
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,603
No. We defy them
by owning their judgment.

741
00:58:59,605 --> 00:59:02,606
You want us to keep
losing our identity?

742
00:59:02,608 --> 00:59:07,910
No, but I think it might be
helpful if we lost some of it.

743
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:09,044
No.

744
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,279
I don't want our uniqueness
to keep disappearing

745
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:15,215
into this void of political
correctness and pop culture.

746
01:01:08,594 --> 01:01:11,162
I have to apologize
to my 37 followers--

747
01:01:11,164 --> 01:01:15,198
well, 39 now, actually--
for neglecting you.

748
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,135
My obsession has
grown...into longing.

749
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:20,936
It's like I want
to take care of him.

750
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:22,537
I don't want him
to make a living

751
01:01:22,539 --> 01:01:24,405
from the dollars
of gropers anymore.

752
01:01:24,407 --> 01:01:28,742
I don't want him to seen
as an object by anyone but me.

753
01:01:28,744 --> 01:01:30,577
I just want to rip
that hat off his head,

754
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:32,845
so the world can see
his eyes and not his ass.

755
01:01:33,947 --> 01:01:35,847
I'm really confused.

756
01:01:35,849 --> 01:01:37,648
I don't want you to hide.

757
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,016
I want you to be free.

758
01:01:39,018 --> 01:01:41,885
This is, of course,
coming from a fucked up,

759
01:01:41,887 --> 01:01:45,321
almost college graduate who has
basically nothing to offer you.

760
01:01:45,323 --> 01:01:46,722
This is irrational.

761
01:01:46,724 --> 01:01:48,523
Maybe we should
just get married.

762
01:01:48,525 --> 01:01:50,858
Maybe we should just
run away from the city together.

763
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,626
You don't want to be
here any more than I do.

764
01:01:52,628 --> 01:01:57,363
So, we'll go to Iowa and you
can tattoo people, or pigs,

765
01:01:57,365 --> 01:02:02,367
or whatever you do and paint
and make clothes and I'll write.

766
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:04,302
I'll be a writer.

767
01:02:05,103 --> 01:02:06,570
I love him.

768
01:02:06,572 --> 01:02:09,306
And it's not like
that romantic kind of,

769
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,641
I need to spend the rest
of my life with this person,

770
01:02:11,643 --> 01:02:12,775
kind of love.

771
01:02:12,777 --> 01:02:14,176
Because I've never felt that...

772
01:02:14,178 --> 01:02:15,577
I don't think I have.

773
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:16,844
I don't know
if he's ever gotten

774
01:02:16,846 --> 01:02:18,645
the love that he deserves.

775
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:20,179
And if no one's
willing to step up,

776
01:02:20,181 --> 01:02:23,048
then I feel the responsibility
to take the job.

777
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,849
I know I'm being naive.

778
01:02:25,917 --> 01:02:27,050
I'm sure I'm the millionth fag

779
01:02:27,052 --> 01:02:28,418
to think I can
make a difference.

780
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,119
But you know,
none of them did it,

781
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,787
and maybe I will.

782
01:02:32,989 --> 01:02:34,489
People can change.

783
01:02:34,491 --> 01:02:37,358
I know that, at least,
from my experiences.

784
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,127
And then, Jesus,
there's that ass!

785
01:02:40,129 --> 01:02:41,962
It's like an ass
from another planet.

786
01:02:41,964 --> 01:02:44,998
And I know I'm not the first
visitor to planet go-go ass.

787
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,168
I may not be number 100,
but maybe I can be the last?

788
01:02:51,336 --> 01:02:54,204
When was the last
time you were in love?

789
01:02:54,206 --> 01:02:56,072
Not too long ago.

790
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:00,409
Dot, dot, dot.

791
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,245
Do you believe
in commitment and monogamy?

792
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:05,579
Monogamy is a rare thing,

793
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,681
and I think commitment
is an even rarer thing.

794
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,516
It's hard to maintain
that kind of

795
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:12,886
intimacy with people...
I think.

796
01:03:12,888 --> 01:03:14,954
But I think it's possible.

797
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:17,856
Relationships are hard because

798
01:03:17,858 --> 01:03:20,325
sometimes it becomes
painfully obvious

799
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:23,094
that you guys are in
two different emotional states

800
01:03:23,096 --> 01:03:25,129
and that they don't align.

801
01:03:25,131 --> 01:03:27,431
I definitely had
a situation like that.

802
01:03:27,433 --> 01:03:29,166
So, tell me about it.

803
01:03:29,168 --> 01:03:30,500
I don't want to.

804
01:03:36,773 --> 01:03:40,108
Maybe if we stepped down
off the go-go box,

805
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:42,310
and started being
a little bit more normal.

806
01:03:43,245 --> 01:03:44,945
So...

807
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:49,482
Stalking a go-go boy is normal,
but being one isn't?

808
01:03:49,484 --> 01:03:52,084
I'm just saying that
there's nothing more unique

809
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:54,419
about being gay than
there is about being straight.

810
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:56,721
It's narcissistic to think so.

811
01:03:56,723 --> 01:03:58,055
Normal is just something

812
01:03:58,057 --> 01:04:00,757
that a bunch of people
pretend that they are.

813
01:04:00,759 --> 01:04:04,493
Statistically, no;
there is a normal.

814
01:04:05,695 --> 01:04:10,365
But I get it.
It's natural to rebel.

815
01:04:10,367 --> 01:04:15,135
Personally, I think it takes
more courage to be average,

816
01:04:15,137 --> 01:04:18,171
to be boring,
and just try and assimilate.

817
01:04:18,173 --> 01:04:21,274
I think it's more threatening to
the statistically normal person

818
01:04:21,276 --> 01:04:25,043
to...act like they do.

819
01:04:26,045 --> 01:04:27,779
Anyone can look at a homo,

820
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,282
like, a really 'out there,
acting as uniquely

821
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:34,652
as he possibly can'
kind of homo...

822
01:04:34,654 --> 01:04:37,721
and feel like they
don't understand that

823
01:04:37,723 --> 01:04:40,857
and they don't need
to understand that.

824
01:04:40,859 --> 01:04:42,458
And they never will.

825
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:47,428
But if we all acted and talked
and thought the same way,

826
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:50,497
think of the minds
that we would fuck.

827
01:04:52,266 --> 01:04:54,233
You've heard of Hitler, right?

828
01:04:54,235 --> 01:04:54,233
Come on.

829
01:04:54,235 --> 01:04:58,637
I'm not saying we should all
be pale blondes with blue eyes.

830
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:01,740
No, just office drones
with khaki pants and polos.

831
01:05:01,742 --> 01:05:05,743
You don't want to be normal.
You want to be an artist.

832
01:05:05,745 --> 01:05:07,978
Being an artist
is so overrated though.

833
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,914
Everyone's an artist.
Or at least they think they are.

834
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:12,248
I think most people now believe

835
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,650
that the only thing separating
them from fame and fortune,

836
01:05:14,652 --> 01:05:17,619
is the finish line
of a reality show.

837
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,786
I don't know why my voice

838
01:05:18,788 --> 01:05:22,989
is any more unique
than any of theirs.

839
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:24,357
Let's go to sleep.

840
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:27,793
It's, like, that fame is the
new American birthright.

841
01:05:27,795 --> 01:05:30,595
We do anything for it,

842
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:36,934
and yet we feel cheated
somehow if we don't get it.

843
01:05:36,936 --> 01:05:38,468
What's your thesis again?

844
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:41,904
The goal of the queer community
must be assimilation

845
01:05:41,906 --> 01:05:44,907
if true equality
is ever to be won.

846
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:46,341
Ow.

847
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:47,542
That's fucked up.

848
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:50,578
You know, Warhol's whole
point of view was assimilation,

849
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,348
a bunch of nearly
identical soup cans.

850
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,116
No, it wasn't.

851
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,119
Warhol's point was about
the mundane life of the 50's,

852
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,387
and it was a pretty radical
statement at the time.

853
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,655
No.
He wanted to be famous.

854
01:06:02,657 --> 01:06:04,757
He wanted us
to lose the parts of ourselves

855
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:08,093
that made us less than ideal,
and he led by example.

856
01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:10,628
I don't want to be different...

857
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,831
I don't want to be unique.

858
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:16,500
I just want to be
like everybody else.

859
01:06:16,502 --> 01:06:19,269
As soon as you stick your
thick prick up someone's butt,

860
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:20,870
you lose that luxury.

861
01:06:22,272 --> 01:06:25,574
Look, your essay
is totally fucking colonial,

862
01:06:25,576 --> 01:06:28,610
but your writing is really good.

863
01:06:28,612 --> 01:06:31,679
Should I burn it and start over?

864
01:06:33,214 --> 01:06:34,680
You should brush your teeth.

865
01:06:36,883 --> 01:06:38,383
Yeah, why not.

866
01:06:43,855 --> 01:06:45,856
I don't want people
to see me doing my hair.

867
01:06:45,858 --> 01:06:47,157
Put the video down.
I'll show you.

868
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:49,759
Look, watch...
You're gonna try and film it.

869
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:50,826
Hey!

870
01:06:50,828 --> 01:06:54,296
I have to go get it filled in.
I'm gonna go to Puerto Rico.

871
01:06:58,533 --> 01:06:59,866
I can't believe
you're recording that.

872
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,496
Ladies and gentlemen...

873
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:14,130
Welcome to the stoop

874
01:09:14,132 --> 01:09:16,799
of New York's finest
boy on a box.

875
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:19,334
Except this time,
I have my cap and gown.

876
01:09:37,217 --> 01:09:38,750
This is fucked up.

877
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:41,352
This is fucked up.

878
01:09:43,021 --> 01:09:44,087
Fuck!

879
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:53,827
What?

880
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:57,297
Do you need cash?
'Cause I can just give you cash.

881
01:09:57,299 --> 01:10:00,332
I didn't think that five percent
would get my exclusivity, but...

882
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,535
No, I'm not
fucking coming back.

883
01:10:04,537 --> 01:10:05,835
There's no way.

884
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,872
It's your job to make people
think you like them.

885
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,341
You're not a job.
I mean it. You're different.

886
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:14,575
Clearly.

887
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:15,742
Do you know
that before I met you,

888
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,544
I was saving myself?

889
01:10:18,546 --> 01:10:20,546
For the right guy.

890
01:10:20,548 --> 01:10:22,214
Doc, I'm sorry.

891
01:10:23,482 --> 01:10:26,450
I can't believe I gave
it up to a fucking stripper.

892
01:10:26,452 --> 01:10:28,218
I feel like a fucking idiot.

893
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,852
Fuck you!
You wanted drama.

894
01:10:29,854 --> 01:10:32,020
I wanted drama
for the movie. Not for my life.

895
01:10:32,022 --> 01:10:33,321
That's not true.

896
01:10:33,323 --> 01:10:34,855
You don't think I didn't
know this whole thing

897
01:10:34,857 --> 01:10:36,089
was shit from the beginning?

898
01:10:36,091 --> 01:10:37,523
You didn't even have a camera,

899
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:40,058
let alone a fucking clue
about what you were doing.

900
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,193
Obviously you were using this
as a way to get close to me -

901
01:10:42,195 --> 01:10:43,927
and guess what, it worked.

902
01:10:46,897 --> 01:10:49,932
Well, maybe I didn't
know another way to do it.

903
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:51,733
Why do we
have to be so serious?

904
01:10:51,735 --> 01:10:54,068
Because this is serious...

905
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:55,569
To me.

906
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,270
Come on, Doc.

907
01:10:57,971 --> 01:10:59,738
I have to go
to the boy's room.

908
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,340
Doc...

909
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,874
Please don't.

910
01:11:05,543 --> 01:11:07,710
- Look--
- This is embarrassing enough.

911
01:11:07,712 --> 01:11:09,244
I'm sorry.

912
01:11:09,246 --> 01:11:10,979
I really am.

913
01:11:10,981 --> 01:11:12,213
Hold on,
I have an idea.

914
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:19,552
No, not now.

915
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:21,353
I want you to film this.

916
01:11:23,789 --> 01:11:25,489
Your friendship
means a lot more to me

917
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:27,390
than five percent of anything.

918
01:11:27,392 --> 01:11:28,324
So...

919
01:11:30,193 --> 01:11:31,259
Come here.

920
01:11:44,905 --> 01:11:46,972
I totally get it
if you have to walk away.

921
01:11:53,712 --> 01:11:55,145
You're gonna shoot me now?

922
01:11:55,147 --> 01:11:57,947
Who is the first guy
that flirted with you?

923
01:11:57,949 --> 01:12:01,650
I don't know. I think touching
came before flirting.

924
01:12:01,652 --> 01:12:02,951
It was at summer camp.

925
01:12:02,953 --> 01:12:04,218
Where did he touch you?

926
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:09,923
He touched me, like,
on my leg and then on my dick.

927
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:12,792
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

928
01:12:12,794 --> 01:12:14,193
How old were you?

929
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:15,594
Thirteen.

930
01:12:15,596 --> 01:12:17,495
I remember
going to sleep that night

931
01:12:17,497 --> 01:12:21,665
thinking that I had
committed a crime -

932
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:23,333
like, that I had
murdered somebody.

933
01:12:23,335 --> 01:12:26,903
- Oh, really?
- I felt such immense guilt.

934
01:12:26,905 --> 01:12:29,038
Where do you think
that guilt came from?

935
01:12:31,307 --> 01:12:33,074
It's so funny
that people smile

936
01:12:33,076 --> 01:12:37,311
when they are
not happy sometimes.

937
01:12:37,313 --> 01:12:41,081
I just smiled so big,
but I'm not happy;

938
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:44,350
I'm just embarrassed
and kind of, like,

939
01:12:44,352 --> 01:12:46,385
don't want to tell you
what I'm thinking.

940
01:12:46,387 --> 01:12:48,954
So now you have
to tell me, you know that.

941
01:12:48,956 --> 01:12:50,155
Um...

942
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:55,326
I think that I have a lot
of guilt built up over the years

943
01:12:55,328 --> 01:13:01,398
from being a kid who always felt
like he had something to hide.

944
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,833
This sense of being found out

945
01:13:04,835 --> 01:13:08,236
or this worry that you
grow up with as a gay kid.

946
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:10,304
I guess it keeps me inhibited.

947
01:13:10,306 --> 01:13:13,573
What do you find most
attractive about a guy?

948
01:13:13,575 --> 01:13:17,943
I like people
that don't give a fuck.

949
01:13:17,945 --> 01:13:23,080
I don't think I could really
be with anyone like that, but...

950
01:17:17,213 --> 01:17:18,746
Greetings, followers.

951
01:17:18,748 --> 01:17:21,482
Welcome to five minutes
of my world.

952
01:17:26,321 --> 01:17:28,121
As I'm sure you guessed,

953
01:17:28,123 --> 01:17:30,189
today was supposed
to be different.

954
01:17:31,658 --> 01:17:33,959
This cap and gown
was not my fantasy.

955
01:17:33,961 --> 01:17:36,194
I'm not supposed
to be alone wearing it,

956
01:17:36,196 --> 01:17:37,995
but time is, time was, right?

957
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:46,035
So, take it in.

958
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:50,138
This is your
last fleeting moment.

959
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:52,607
This one's for Go...

960
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:54,108
and then it all goes.

961
01:18:34,415 --> 01:18:36,215
Take the robe off?

962
01:18:36,217 --> 01:18:38,183
No way...

963
01:18:38,185 --> 01:18:39,617
It's symbolic.

964
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,782
You about done
with my camera?

965
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:23,083
Almost.

966
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:24,285
To my son.

967
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:26,920
Congratulations!

968
01:20:31,524 --> 01:20:35,426
Today is the day that
I vow to stop obsessing...

969
01:20:35,428 --> 01:20:37,394
Over any thing, or anyone.

970
01:20:37,396 --> 01:20:39,362
No more cyber-stalking.

971
01:20:39,364 --> 01:20:41,497
I've even killed
my Facebook and my blog.

972
01:20:41,499 --> 01:20:46,535
I want to do
and say and think and be

973
01:20:46,537 --> 01:20:50,405
and eat
and sleep with and kiss,

974
01:20:50,407 --> 01:20:52,740
anything or anyone
that I want to.

975
01:20:52,742 --> 01:20:55,075
And I won't need
a half a bottle of bourbon

976
01:20:55,077 --> 01:20:59,512
or any number of pink,
gay slushy drinks to...

977
01:20:59,514 --> 01:21:00,746
Sorry, I'm...

978
01:21:04,716 --> 01:21:06,783
OK, where was I?

979
01:21:06,785 --> 01:21:08,050
Um...

980
01:21:11,554 --> 01:21:13,488
I'm just gonna be myself.

981
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:15,890
That's the bottom line,
I guess.

982
01:21:15,892 --> 01:21:17,358
Starting with Go.

983
01:21:24,799 --> 01:21:26,332
You seem nervous.

984
01:21:26,334 --> 01:21:28,233
I have another phone
if you need an angle.

985
01:21:28,235 --> 01:21:29,901
I'm fine, thanks.

986
01:21:32,004 --> 01:21:33,004
Go...

987
01:21:33,006 --> 01:21:35,239
My subject.
My muse.

988
01:21:35,241 --> 01:21:37,674
My obsession...

989
01:21:37,676 --> 01:21:39,108
My friend.

990
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:40,175
My first.

991
01:21:40,177 --> 01:21:43,478
This is the first time I've ever
been this close to a guy.

992
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,680
And the truth is,
it feels really good -

993
01:21:45,682 --> 01:21:48,649
the proximity,
emotionally and physically.

994
01:21:57,992 --> 01:22:00,259
From up close,
in the light of day,

995
01:22:00,261 --> 01:22:02,394
I can see that
you're not perfect.

996
01:22:02,396 --> 01:22:04,195
You have blackheads.

997
01:22:04,197 --> 01:22:06,197
You have ear hair.

998
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:07,831
You have a mole

999
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:11,167
on your stunning
pectoralis major muscle.

1000
01:22:11,169 --> 01:22:14,303
Your hairline is very slowly,
but surely, receding.

1001
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:16,838
One day your
physical beauty is gonna fade

1002
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,073
and you'll be left
with what's underneath.

1003
01:22:19,075 --> 01:22:22,342
A little bit of narcissism,
a lot of neediness.

1004
01:22:22,344 --> 01:22:24,677
This isn't fair.
Why do you get to judge me?

1005
01:22:24,679 --> 01:22:26,111
Just let me finish, please.

1006
01:22:30,449 --> 01:22:32,750
I just want to say a few things
to get them off my chest,

1007
01:22:32,752 --> 01:22:34,084
because I've been
saying them over and over

1008
01:22:34,086 --> 01:22:35,952
to myself in my apartment
and I feel like you're the

1009
01:22:35,954 --> 01:22:38,254
only person that I really want
to know these things, so...

1010
01:22:38,256 --> 01:22:39,655
I don't really like Madonna.

1011
01:22:39,657 --> 01:22:41,823
I don't want
to have to worry about

1012
01:22:41,825 --> 01:22:43,558
the pattern of my chest hair.

1013
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,093
I don't want to have to worry
about the size of my calves.

1014
01:22:46,095 --> 01:22:50,330
I'm not a twink, or a bear,
or a cub or an otter.

1015
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:54,433
I'm not fat or fem
or a power bottom. I'm just me.

1016
01:22:54,435 --> 01:22:56,234
You know I'm more
than all those things.

1017
01:22:56,236 --> 01:22:58,636
I know,
and I love you for it.

1018
01:22:58,638 --> 01:23:01,405
I don't mean to belittle you,
or any other homosexual

1019
01:23:01,407 --> 01:23:03,573
that likes vodka sodas
with a splash of cranberry

1020
01:23:03,575 --> 01:23:05,741
because they're
only 109 calories -

1021
01:23:05,743 --> 01:23:07,109
if you don't
count the cranberry,

1022
01:23:07,111 --> 01:23:08,610
'cause it's only
a splash, right?

1023
01:23:08,612 --> 01:23:13,414
I just have never felt
like part of their community.

1024
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:21,120
OK, this is it,
The end.

1025
01:23:21,122 --> 01:23:23,856
- What?
- This is the final shot.

1026
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,625
I thought you don't
leave 'til Friday.

1027
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:28,259
Yeah, but I have a life.

1028
01:23:28,261 --> 01:23:30,394
I have other things
I need to take care of.

1029
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:31,995
I know that, but I'm around.

1030
01:23:31,997 --> 01:23:33,262
I can help you do
whatever you need.

1031
01:23:33,264 --> 01:23:34,996
It's OK, I got it.
Thank you.

1032
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:39,833
Don't you want
one last summer in New York?

1033
01:23:39,835 --> 01:23:41,801
I have to be out
of my apartment by Friday.

1034
01:23:41,803 --> 01:23:43,402
You could crash here with me.

1035
01:23:45,204 --> 01:23:46,571
Fuck, Doc.

1036
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:49,239
I don't want it
to end like this.

1037
01:23:50,574 --> 01:23:52,474
Can you turn
the fucking camera off?

1038
01:23:53,943 --> 01:23:55,343
Can you just turn it off?

1039
01:24:06,087 --> 01:24:07,520
Why are you doing this?

1040
01:24:07,522 --> 01:24:09,154
I had to say thank you

1041
01:24:09,156 --> 01:24:12,590
for showing me
a new side of myself

1042
01:24:12,592 --> 01:24:14,158
that really I had never known,

1043
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:18,294
and for bringing me
out of my shadows.

1044
01:24:18,296 --> 01:24:23,031
And I also wanted
to apologize for all the...

1045
01:24:23,033 --> 01:24:24,866
I don't know...
See, I'm not good at this.

1046
01:24:24,868 --> 01:24:26,667
I'm not a people person.

1047
01:24:26,669 --> 01:24:29,369
This is exactly
why I've never...

1048
01:24:29,371 --> 01:24:30,703
I am a social misfit.

1049
01:24:30,705 --> 01:24:32,271
- No.
- Yeah, I am.

1050
01:24:32,273 --> 01:24:35,007
It's OK, at least I'll always
know there's one person

1051
01:24:35,009 --> 01:24:37,843
in my tribe
that thinks I belong.

1052
01:24:47,218 --> 01:24:49,619
I'm sorry I hurt you, Doc.
I didn't mean to.

1053
01:24:49,621 --> 01:24:51,153
It wasn't intentional...

1054
01:24:51,155 --> 01:24:54,122
And I didn't bring you
out of any shadows.

1055
01:24:54,124 --> 01:24:55,756
You did that all on your own.

1056
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:57,991
I was just some piece of ass
on a computer screen

1057
01:24:57,993 --> 01:24:59,759
that lured you out.

1058
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:01,660
This was real.

1059
01:25:01,662 --> 01:25:04,396
We're both just fighting
for the same thing.

1060
01:25:04,398 --> 01:25:05,663
I don't know why
you're talking like

1061
01:25:05,665 --> 01:25:06,930
you never
want to see me again.

1062
01:25:06,932 --> 01:25:08,464
Because we shouldn't
fuck it up for each other.

1063
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:10,199
And we haven't,
and we won't.

1064
01:25:10,201 --> 01:25:11,466
I have to go.

1065
01:25:12,334 --> 01:25:13,767
Come on, Doc.

1066
01:25:13,769 --> 01:25:15,168
Fake it 'til you feel it.

1067
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:54,672
I think you need
to rewrite your paper.

1068
01:25:54,674 --> 01:25:56,540
Yeah, what's my new thesis?

1069
01:25:57,608 --> 01:25:59,408
That the goal of
assimilation within the

1070
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:04,145
LGBTQIA-LMNOP
community in the United States

1071
01:26:04,147 --> 01:26:08,816
has castrated queer culture
and in effect, culture at large

1072
01:26:08,818 --> 01:26:14,321
by denying humanity's
radical need for diversity.

1073
01:26:14,323 --> 01:26:15,989
That's actually pretty good.

1074
01:26:17,057 --> 01:26:18,524
You have a pen and paper?

1075
01:26:18,526 --> 01:26:20,192
You have it on video.

1076
01:26:20,194 --> 01:26:21,593
Iowa, really?

1077
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:25,763
That's not very Warhola of you -
going from somewhere to nowhere.

1078
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:29,933
Maybe I'm destined
to live a boring, normal life.

1079
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,702
There has to be
some kind of defiance in that.

1080
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,036
Baby steps.

1081
01:26:34,937 --> 01:26:37,204
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

1082
01:26:37,206 --> 01:26:40,006
- Do you like your eyes?
- Yeah, I do.

1083
01:26:40,008 --> 01:26:42,241
You always wear
a hat though, I've noticed.

1084
01:26:42,243 --> 01:26:44,176
I don't like to make
eye contact with people.

1085
01:26:44,178 --> 01:26:46,178
Is that why you wear
a hat when you dance?

1086
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:47,245
Um hmm.

1087
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:53,350
'Cause you don't like
to look people in the eyes?

1088
01:26:53,352 --> 01:26:55,819
You don't like feeling
all those eyes on you?

1089
01:26:55,821 --> 01:26:58,788
No...
It's intimidating.

1090
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:01,557
I just like to have fun,
and do my thing.

1091
01:27:01,559 --> 01:27:03,625
So do you
pretend you're alone?

1092
01:27:04,893 --> 01:27:07,261
Well, I am alone.
Everybody's alone.

1093
01:27:07,263 --> 01:27:10,630
Life imitating art,
imitating life, imitating art.

1094
01:27:10,632 --> 01:27:11,831
Yeah.

1095
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:50,433
New beginnings are really new.

1096
01:27:52,369 --> 01:27:54,703
Go sent me a text earlier...

1097
01:27:54,705 --> 01:27:58,072
from dirty, crowded Brooklyn.

1098
01:28:00,075 --> 01:28:03,510
Thinking about you, Sexy.
Seen any hot guys yet?

1099
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:06,179
Hope you don't have
to resort to farm animals.

1100
01:28:06,181 --> 01:28:07,848
If it comes to that,
let me know

1101
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:10,050
and I'll be on
the first flight out.

1102
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:12,786
I think that I'll always
be friends with him.

1103
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:15,021
And I know that people
say that all the time,

1104
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,856
and they usually
don't mean it.

1105
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:18,591
But I really believe that.

1106
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,025
But we'll always
have Facebook.

1107
01:28:23,061 --> 01:28:26,396
Yeah, I'm back on.
I lasted about 23 hours.

1108
01:28:28,265 --> 01:28:30,799
So it turns out I knew
what I wanted all along.

1109
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:32,300
I wanted to move home.

1110
01:28:32,302 --> 01:28:35,269
I'm not exactly from Iowa,
but I think it's safe to say

1111
01:28:35,271 --> 01:28:37,704
that I wanted to move
back to the country.

1112
01:28:37,706 --> 01:28:39,338
Own a farm.

1113
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,972
Drive a combine.

1114
01:28:40,974 --> 01:28:42,640
Buy a shotgun.

1115
01:28:42,642 --> 01:28:44,108
I want to have a family

1116
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:47,744
and grow old sipping lemonade
on my front porch.

1117
01:28:47,746 --> 01:28:51,180
I think that's how I'll be
a real, radical homosexual.

1118
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:57,852
So I guess this is

1119
01:28:57,854 --> 01:29:00,254
the small town boy
in the city, signing off.

1120
01:29:00,256 --> 01:29:03,857
