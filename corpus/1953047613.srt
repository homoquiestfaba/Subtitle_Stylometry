1
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,153
 

2
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,701
 

3
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:53,273
 

4
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,475
Nick, get up!

5
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,437
Nick...

6
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,856
Nicholas, get up.

7
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,484
Nick...

8
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,570
Come on, get up.

9
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:16,115
Mom, he won't get up.

10
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,326
Are you okay? What happened?

11
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:20,662
I fell.
Yeah, I can see that.

12
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,999
But... but what,
did you cross your skies or..?

13
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,834
I don't know. I just fell.

14
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:26,419
He's a klutz, that's why.

15
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:27,796
Come on, let's go.

16
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,507
I'm cold.

17
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,050
Let's get up.

18
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,637
Ugh!
You all right?

19
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,848
You scared me.

20
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:38,768
Mm, not too much snow,

21
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,146
but there's supposed
to be a big fall tonight.

22
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:44,692
Oh, we got a point!
I saw a green ball go in.

23
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:47,362
I can't hear you. Henry?..

24
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,784
Don't mess with the program...

25
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,871
No, I'll figure it out
when I get back...

26
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:57,100
No. No, I reorganized
all this stuff, so just...

27
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,710
don't touch it. Okay?

28
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:05,384
I keep all the hard copies
in a file under the desk.

29
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:07,136
You'll find it there. Mm-hm.

30
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:13,811
Oh, that was such a good...

31
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,275
I've been sleeping
in your T-shirt...

32
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,528
Mm-hm...

33
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:22,155
Me too.

34
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:26,118
Oh, jeez!..

35
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,912
 : Ah!

36
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:30,415
None of us have got a point yet.
Come on, you've gotta get one.

37
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,167
You're so bad!..

38
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:37,465
No, you can't do it to me now.
I'm in the lounge...

39
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:41,262
All right.

40
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,264
I will.

41
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:44,849
Love ya!

42
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:47,686
Bye.

43
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:52,817
One more game, guys,
and then we're going home.

44
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,528
Home?
Mm-hm.

45
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:57,323
Ah, how come?

46
00:04:57,406 --> 00:05:00,535
Do we have to? We're supposed
to stay here till the weekend.

47
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:01,453
Yeah.
I know...

48
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:03,205
It sucks! Home?

49
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:07,294
And I think Dad's missing us
too much. Okay?

50
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:10,464
What a rip!
It's supposed to snow tonight.

51
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:13,927
My name is Nicole

52
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,971
I live in a hole
with lots-

53
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,057
And lots of trolls

54
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,145
 : When they want to come in
I let them right in

55
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:25,232
So maybe they'll eat my twin

56
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:27,068
My name is-
 : NICHOLAS

57
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:30,030
I EAT LOTS OF LICORICE
I COME FROM-

58
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:31,115
 : Nick!

59
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,826
Are you deaf or something?

60
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,453
You're so out of tune,
my ears hurt!

61
00:05:35,537 --> 00:05:38,415
Okay, okay. Now, Nick...

62
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:42,212
My name is Nicholas
I eat lots of licorice

63
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:45,966
I come from a palace on Mars
Mom?

64
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,052
You should be on TV and radio.

65
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:50,513
You're a thousand times better
than Celine Dion.

66
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,102
And a mmmmmmillion times--

67
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,563
 
He's right.

68
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:59,566
You and Nicole and Daddy
are my favourite audience.

69
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:01,902
I don't need anybody else.
 : My name

70
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,155
Is Nicholas
I eat lots of licorice

71
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,410
I COME FROM A PALACE ON MARS
Shhh! Guys, hold it down.

72
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,039
'Cause we don't wanna wake
everybody else up;

73
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:13,458
we just wanna surprise Daddy.
Okay?

74
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,502
 

75
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:18,882
I gotta pee! Oh, too late.
I wet my pants.

76
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:20,133
Shhh.
 

77
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:23,262
Absolute...
absolute quiet, okay?

78
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:25,306
 
Tiptoe.

79
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:32,440
Shhh! Take her to the kitchen
and get her some milk.

80
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:34,067
Not a peep.

81
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:51,213
 

82
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,311
Huh?

83
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:04,688
Julie?

84
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,775
Mom...
We're going! Now!

85
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,861
 
 

86
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:10,946
Move it!

87
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:12,239
Move it!

88
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:15,410
Mom... what are you doing?
Run! Move it!

89
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:16,995
Get in the car! Now!

90
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,249
... is this?

91
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,298
You're scaring us!

92
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:29,302
Mom! Why are we leaving
like this?

93
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,684
Mom! Dad's behind us.
Julie!

94
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,937
Please stop!

95
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:40,148
He's chasing us!
Sit down

96
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:41,900
and shut up!

97
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:43,444
Please stop. I want Dad.

98
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,909
Did you hear me? I want--
All right! Anybody wants

99
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:51,120
to see your dad,
you can stop and get out!

100
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:53,373
Get out!

101
00:07:53,415 --> 00:07:55,292
 

102
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,044
I said get out!
Fine!

103
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:58,004
Get out!

104
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:00,966
You just don't know

105
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:02,676
what he did.

106
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:05,513
Dad!

107
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,785
She said"Shut up" to me.
She's never said that before.

108
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:26,455
I know, honey.
She was mad at me.

109
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,669
And it rubbed off on you.
She didn't mean it, she didn't mean it.

110
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:33,839
It's gonna be okay. All right,
come on, let's get undressed, okay?

111
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:35,717
There we go.

112
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:41,808
You know, it's probably not good
for twins to be separated for too long.

113
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,268
 
You're absolutely right.

114
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,395
You'll see Nick tomorrow
and we'll fix everything, okay?

115
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,939
Get those socks off. Come on.

116
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:52,779
You better get under there
right away and go to sleep,

117
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,074
because you can't even imagine
the danger you're in.

118
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:57,952
There's a hungry spider
crawling up the bed.

119
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:00,247
Hungry, pinching spider

120
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,957
who loves little girls!

121
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:07,005
Dad, please, no.
Don't blame me, blame the spider!

122
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,632
 

123
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,967
 

124
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,177
Mom?

125
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,430
 
No, it's not Mom.

126
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,848
Who's there?

127
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:17,977
It's nobody.
Come on, go to bed.

128
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,146
Let's get some sleep.
We got a big day tomorrow...

129
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,732
and everything's
gonna go back to normal.

130
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:25,778
Okay?
Don't forget to say good night

131
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,781
to Nurnies.
Nurnies?

132
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:30,326
I thought Nurnies ran way

133
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,662
to join the circus years ago.

134
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:35,874
Well, Nurnies is back.

135
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:39,587
I remember.
Nurnies sleeps on the ceiling.

136
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,215
Good night, Nurnies.
We'll see you tomorrow.

137
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,219
Good night, princess.
Good night.

138
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:49,641
Love you.

139
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:27,771
What happened?
Your curse worked.

140
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:30,733
Can we help you?

141
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:33,153
No, I'm... I'm okay.
We'll talk in the morning.

142
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:49,131
Mom...

143
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:51,759
do you still love Nicole?

144
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:53,303
Of course I do.

145
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,476
Whatever happened with your dad

146
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,438
has nothing to do with Nicole
or you. Okay?

147
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:05,568
Why don't you want
to tell me about it?

148
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:12,409
Honey, some things...
change everything.

149
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:15,246
It's hard to explain.

150
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,124
You could at least try.

151
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:20,837
All you need to know
is some things never change.

152
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,130
Like how much

153
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:25,676
I love you and Nicole.
The important things.

154
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,470
And Dad's not important?

155
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,141
How about we cuddle
all night tonight?

156
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:35,980
Okay.

157
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:40,110
And guess what?
Nurnies is back from the circus.

158
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:41,988
Really?
Mm-hm.

159
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,432
Open the door.

160
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,521
Open up!

161
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,567
I know you're there.

162
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,528
Julie?

163
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,156
Nicholas?

164
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,534
Can't you see her car
is not here?

165
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:21,161
Dad, don't give me this.

166
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:24,623
I'm not your dad.
She doesn't want to see you.

167
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:26,542
She doesn't need you.
Daddy?

168
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:27,877
Daddy!
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

169
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,924
Mom went to get some food.
Where's Nicole?

170
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:35,428
I came to get you. No use
driving her back and forth, right?

171
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:38,098
But Mom says
we're staying here.

172
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:40,268
Well, she just meant
overnight.

173
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:42,479
That's not what she meant.

174
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,940
I'm taking him home.
That boy wants

175
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:47,109
to fish.
Come on, Nickers. Let's go.

176
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:51,156
We plan to fish
The cod are in.

177
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,327
Nicole's waiting for us,
buddy boy.

178
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:57,581
Okay...

179
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:00,626
Okay, look,

180
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,628
why don't you stay and fish,

181
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:05,424
I'll wait for Mom
and then we'll all go home, okay?

182
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:07,301
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

183
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:08,844
Go ahead.

184
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:13,267
How could you be so stupid?

185
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:16,103
In your own house.

186
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:18,231
So now you pay.

187
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:21,110
You're a brick wall.
You know?

188
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:25,824
There's no sense talking to you.

189
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:28,118
Sure, Mr. Fucking Scientist!

190
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:32,248
I am not smart enough
to understand your talk.

191
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:34,084
I'll be back
to pick up Nicholas.

192
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,434
Dad! Dad, is it you? Dad!

193
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,311
Mom...

194
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:53,942
something's wrong with Belladonna.
We've gotta take her,to the vet.

195
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,986
Look.

196
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:57,905
Honey, she's having
her babies.

197
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,662
Did it look like that
when you were having us?

198
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:04,538
Kind of.

199
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:07,333
I was in such a hurry,

200
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,628
Daddy barely got me
to the hospital on time.

201
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:13,966
Are you mad at me
'cause I went with Daddy last night?

202
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,013
No. I'm proud of you.

203
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,851
 

204
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,311
Julie?

205
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,359
I have to talk to Daddy now.
But the kittens are coming.

206
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:30,236
You'll be fine. I'll be back.

207
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,780
Mom...

208
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:35,159
what's going on?

209
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:39,706
Dad just...
doesn't love me anymore.

210
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,879
Okay. One, two, three.

211
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,317
Julie, I'm sorry.

212
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,782
I made a mistake
and I'm so sorry.

213
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,079
I called Monica
about selling the house.

214
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:14,290
What?
We'll split the proceeds.

215
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:18,212
What proceeds?
I'm trying to tell you what happened.

216
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:22,342
We should try to get apartments
as close to each other as possible.

217
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,136
Make it easier for the kids.

218
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:28,224
What are you saying?
You're leaving?

219
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:29,392
We're leaving.

220
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:30,978
The twins and me.

221
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:35,441
They've never been separated
before and they shouldn't be now, so...

222
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:37,569
I'll let Nicole stay
for a few days--

223
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,738
Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.

224
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:41,115
Well, this is insane.

225
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,493
This is completely insane.
And ridiculous to boot.

226
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:47,248
Julie, it didn't mean anything.
It wasn't important.

227
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:52,629
Do you remember when we were talking
a few months ago about this book?

228
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:54,131
Whatever the title was...

229
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:57,844
And you said it yourself...
And I was even impressed that...

230
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:59,680
that men are not monogamous
by nature.

231
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:01,265
Remember?
It was at that restaurant

232
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:04,185
on Main. And you said it yourself,
that... that sometimes,

233
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:06,730
it just doesn't really matter
because it's a physiological impulse.

234
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:08,148
Come on, Jule,

235
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,944
you know that's true.
You're an intelligent woman.

236
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:12,863
Don't you
fucking patronize me!

237
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,169
I'm not interested
in exploring your motives.

238
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:28,006
Henry, it's over.
Julie, for God's sakes,

239
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:30,509
it was the first time,
with anyone.

240
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:33,263
But I can't ever
trust you again.

241
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:34,681
You know me, Henry.

242
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:40,021
I haven't told the kids
what you've done, so...

243
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:41,022
think of something.

244
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:47,697
Julie, I love you.

245
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:52,036
And I love our family.
Please, just give me another chance.

246
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,538
We--
Don't fucking touch me.

247
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,716
I'm not selling this house!

248
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,009
I'm not!
All I want

249
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:06,428
is the crystal
that belonged to my mother.

250
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:08,264
I don't care
about anything else.

251
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:20,195
Are you mad at my dad, too?

252
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:22,865
I don't want anything
to do with him.

253
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,576
Why? 'Cause he's Jewish?

254
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:28,372
Worse...
he doesn't care about it.

255
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,541
He cares about nothing.

256
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,253
But me and Nicole
are half-Jewish.

257
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:35,256
We celebrate Hanukkah
and Christmas.

258
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:38,384
I like that,
'cause we get more presents.

259
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:39,970
You're not Jewish.

260
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:43,808
Your mother's Catholic
and so are you.

261
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:46,728
One becomes someone
after a mother, not father.

262
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,771
But why?

263
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:49,982
That's the way it is.

264
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:52,068
I got one!

265
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,236
I think I got one!

266
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,615
I know how to do it.

267
00:17:56,699 --> 00:18:00,245
I'll do it myself.
I wanna do it.

268
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:28,112
Mom! I caught a cod! A big one!

269
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:32,201
Wow. So we have dinner
after all.

270
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:34,078
You'll scratch it.
Like this.

271
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:36,289
Nick...

272
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:38,083
clean the fish outside.

273
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,796
Just be careful.
Like I showed you.

274
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:46,719
At least it's good
you are not married.

275
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:48,304
You'll save on divorce.

276
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:51,474
That's a strange thing
for a Catholic man to say.

277
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,770
And you're a strange daughter
for the Catholic to have.

278
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:57,315
Mugs up here with saucers.

279
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:04,198
Maybe just for fun, I'll mess
with your sock drawer, heh?

280
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:07,035
Switch all the labels
on your frozen fish. Hm?

281
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,287
I knew it.

282
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,539
I just knew it--
Don't you dare

283
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:12,542
say one fucking bad word
about him!

284
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,671
If you can't respect the fact
that we've had children together

285
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:19,425
and that we had some good years,
then-- - How do you know they were good?

286
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:22,888
Just because you fucked around
on Mom all those years,

287
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,391
doesn't mean that everyone else
is like you.

288
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:29,104
Did she know?

289
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,066
What do you think?

290
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:33,568
God.

291
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:43,288
Since we're on the subject,
it's been three years

292
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:44,873
since Mom...

293
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,796
I'm expecting someone.

294
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,050
Who? Now?

295
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:57,138
I invited a woman from Poland.
I met her through letters, you know...

296
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:01,435
She's a widow like me,
but no children. If we...

297
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,439
Iike each other, I might...
marry her.

298
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,612
Marry her? Come on, Tata,
you don't even know her.

299
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:11,239
I need someone.

300
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:19,374
So when's your
mail-order bride arriving?

301
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,918
Tonight.

302
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:24,547
Tonight?!

303
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,091
But...

304
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,218
Jesus, Dad.

305
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:30,096
Big week for the family, heh?

306
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,558
Not that many couples
out there, you know,

307
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:35,269
have this thing
that you two had.

308
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,146
You worked together,

309
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:38,731
you played together.
Keep twisting the blade.

310
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:40,275
Honey, maybe what I'm trying

311
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:43,195
to do here is make you realize
what you're about to give up.

312
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,949
Sometimes we've got to look
at things with a more forgiving eye.

313
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,911
No! No, you can't.
Not at some things.

314
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:50,621
Well, you can't, Julie.

315
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:55,585
I dunno. You're angry now,
but maybe... down the road, you...

316
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:57,129
Please don't.

317
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,800
Okay.

318
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,306
So you're gonna sell

319
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,183
the house tomorrow, right?
Okay.

320
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,519
... after way too long,
look who's back.

321
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:10,854
It's Julie McCaskie!

322
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,107
Come on, Julie.
Come on up here and play a song

323
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,651
for us.
No way!

324
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:17,988
Put it together,
for the sweetest voice...

325
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,406
Whoo!

326
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,743
So let's hear it...
Thanks for all the support.

327
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,789
Come on, Julie.
Whoo!

328
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:27,083
Julie!

329
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,627
 

330
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,009
Oh, God. Okay.
Do you remember it?

331
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:37,595
Well, I remember something.

332
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,852
Oh oh oh oh

333
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:47,900
Oh oh oh oh

334
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:53,365
Oh oh oh

335
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:58,580
It's over now
I'm cold alone

336
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:05,338
I'm just a person
On my own

337
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:09,635
Nothing means a thing to me

338
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:15,809
No nothing means a thing to me

339
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:20,565
It's not hard but it's cool
I feel alive

340
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:25,821
If you don't have it
your on the other side...

341
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:31,245
You still got great lips, Terry.
 

342
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:33,915
Right here?

343
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:35,458
Huh?

344
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:49,017
Sorry.

345
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,358
I'm not there yet.
Maybe next time.

346
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,278
Yeah, next time.
Another 10 years!

347
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,239
 : Ten years!

348
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:02,241
Can you wait that long?
No, no, no...

349
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:07,414
 

350
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:15,174
 

351
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:19,930
 

352
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,835
Where's Grandpa?
'Morning.

353
00:23:44,877 --> 00:23:47,005
He's usually here first.
 

354
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:49,299
I hope she didn't hurt him.
Do you like her?

355
00:23:49,383 --> 00:23:52,845
I dunno. I can't understand
what she's saying.

356
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:54,013
Sounds nice, though.

357
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:55,473
And what does Grandpa think?

358
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:58,561
He's always smiling.
And she waves a lot, too.

359
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:00,855
 

360
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,192
Hello.

361
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,570
'Morning.
'Morning.

362
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,617
It's not my mug.
What's the difference.

363
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:15,081
Thanks.

364
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:18,210
You go after breakfast with us?

365
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:20,004
Dad, we've been
through this before.

366
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:23,049
Do you want me to be a hypocrite
just to please you?

367
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:26,261
Look, I pray in my own way,
okay?

368
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,639
I don't need some priest
to tell me how.

369
00:24:28,723 --> 00:24:29,891
Okay, okay, okay.

370
00:24:29,974 --> 00:24:32,060
Really, Dad,
you'd make a great crusader.

371
00:24:32,102 --> 00:24:34,939
Mom don't you believe in it
at all?

372
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:36,274
In what, sweetheart?

373
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:39,194
God. Heaven.

374
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,656
After you die.
You and Nicole are my heaven.

375
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,452
I won't let you to die first.

376
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:47,412
 
Oi!

377
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:54,296
 

378
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:59,093
Welcome.

379
00:24:59,135 --> 00:25:02,973
 
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

380
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:07,938
I've... Tea or coffee?

381
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:09,773
 

382
00:25:12,652 --> 00:25:14,279
Give her a coffee with milk.

383
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:20,620
How was the trip?

384
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:22,998
 

385
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:41,771
She said it went fast.

386
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:44,566
How do you know she's not
just after immigration papers?

387
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:46,151
Why do you say that?

388
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:49,197
With all due respect, Dad,
you're 75 years old.

389
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,659
So it's my last chance
to feel young again.

390
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:55,663
I just don't want
you taken advantage of.

391
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:05,008
She always wanted to go

392
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:06,593
to America.

393
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:27,702
These lizards, very strange
creatures -- from Russia.

394
00:26:27,744 --> 00:26:30,748
The females live on their own
without any husband,

395
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,377
give birth to she-lizards,
grow up, never search for boys,

396
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:38,883
give birth to other girl lizards
and so on and so forth.

397
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:41,469
Some just don't need men at all.

398
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:47,644
Is Mom still gonna help you
in your book?

399
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,402
I don't know.
 

400
00:26:54,444 --> 00:26:56,947
Nicole, come here!
Mom! Nick! Nicholas!

401
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,282
... the kittens!

402
00:26:58,365 --> 00:26:59,784
Quick!

403
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,244
One's all black!

404
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:03,622
And I caught a big fish
at Grandpa's!

405
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:26,608
Guys...

406
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,903
Daddy and I need to talk to you

407
00:27:28,986 --> 00:27:30,989
about something.
Actually, your mother's gonna do

408
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:32,782
all the talking from now on.

409
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:36,704
Remember last year
when we talked about

410
00:27:36,787 --> 00:27:38,665
selling the house
and finding a new one?

411
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:41,126
So that we can both
get our own bedroom?

412
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:44,922
Well...

413
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:46,841
we've decided to sell the house
this time

414
00:27:46,925 --> 00:27:48,844
and we're gonna make
some other changes too.

415
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:51,597
And it's gonna be hard.
We're not selling the house.

416
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:53,349
And... and...
I'm not looking to make

417
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:56,478
any changes.
Are you two getting a divorce?

418
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:00,150
Is that why you're staying
at Grandpa's?

419
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,069
No, honey.
Mommy's just really angry

420
00:28:02,152 --> 00:28:03,862
at Daddy right now. That's all.

421
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:05,489
 

422
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:10,120
Julie...

423
00:28:10,204 --> 00:28:13,207
Would you please go and tell 'em
you've changed your mind.

424
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,169
I can't.
She's here with clients.

425
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:17,671
Well, you tell them
to go home.

426
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:21,050
This house is not for sale.
 

427
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:24,304
I'm not gonna argue with you,
Henry. I've made up my mind.

428
00:28:24,388 --> 00:28:25,556
As intelligent as you are,

429
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,058
you already--
Dad,

430
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:30,854
are we supposed to feel happy
that we have two homes?

431
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:32,356
Yeah.

432
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,361
The house was restored...
How many years ago now, Julie?

433
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:41,158
Uh, six. We moved here
when the twins were two years old.

434
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:45,038
Kitchen.

435
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:50,837
You look terrible.
I can bring them back next week.

436
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,049
No. No, no.
Let's just do it now.

437
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:55,134
I'll be okay.

438
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:56,844
You're a mess, honey.

439
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,976
I'd like to get a door
between the dining room

440
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:04,061
and the patio. It's not
very convenient to go around.

441
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:06,773
That's not a problem.
You could put a fountain here too.

442
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:08,275
A fountain in the living room?

443
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:10,027
Oh, yeah! Why not?
Or a bobsled run.

444
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,739
You could start up in the attic
and just wind up right down here.

445
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:14,783
My husband's just joking.
Ah, don't forget,

446
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:16,368
I'm not your husband.

447
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:18,830
We never got married, actually.
We loved each other so much,

448
00:29:18,913 --> 00:29:20,165
we never bothered
with the formalities.

449
00:29:20,248 --> 00:29:22,125
Henry, please.
Worked out great, though, didn't it?

450
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,545
You see, if you never marry,
you safe a bundle on divorce.

451
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:26,798
But if we make an acceptable offer,
we can move in as soon as possible?

452
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:29,718
You want it, you got it.

453
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,387
Kids, we're moving out!

454
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,098
Pack a suitcase!
Henry!

455
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:36,643
Throw the kids in a box!
Stop it!

456
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:39,230
Okay, we're finished here.
Hey, wow, where you going?

457
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:42,233
Don't say you wanna go now.
Come on, this is when the fun starts!

458
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:43,944
Listen, you wanted to break
that wall through?

459
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:45,654
Here, let me
help you with that, okay?

460
00:29:45,738 --> 00:29:48,283
After all,
ownership has its privileges

461
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:51,745
and right now,
I still own this house.

462
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,085
 

463
00:29:57,168 --> 00:29:59,296
Henry!

464
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,924
Are you crazy?! The kids!

465
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

466
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,057
It's okay. Shhh, come here.

467
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,600
It's okay.

468
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:12,437
Out!

469
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,023
Out of my house!

470
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,524
I am calling the cops.

471
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:18,069
Good. You do that.

472
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:20,280
Are you gonna be okay
with this asshole?

473
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,537
How could you do that
in front of the kids?

474
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:31,085
Ahh! My God!
Nicholas!

475
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:32,796
Nick!
Nicky?

476
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:34,214
Nick.
Nick, c'mon.

477
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:36,217
Nick.
Is he breathing?

478
00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:37,426
Yeah. Yeah, he's breathing.

479
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,345
Nicole, honey,
get him some water.

480
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:40,639
Nicky, c'mon, c'mon.

481
00:30:40,722 --> 00:30:41,765
What's wrong with him?

482
00:30:41,848 --> 00:30:44,060
You probably scared him
half to death.

483
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,354
Maybe he's hot. C'mon, honey.
C'mon, baby, c'mon.

484
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:47,397
Nick.

485
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,901
Nick?
Nick, sweetie, sweetie...

486
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:52,320
C'mon.
Nick.

487
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:55,157
 : Help me.
Nick?

488
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,201
Here he comes, here he comes.
Nick.

489
00:30:57,284 --> 00:31:00,079
It's okay.
Here he comes.

490
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:03,250
It's okay. It's okay,
sweetheart. It's okay.

491
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,543
Dad...
Yeah.

492
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:07,547
You were a real asshole
to those people.

493
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:11,468
You're right. I'm sorry.

494
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:14,555
Say it 10 times.
What?

495
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,392
"I'm ashamed
of being an asshole."

496
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:20,062
How about... I'm ashamed,
I'm ashamed,

497
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:23,942
I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed,
I'm ashamed of being an asshole.

498
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:25,778
 :
I'm ashamed,

499
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,279
I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed,
I'm really...

500
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:31,701
I really am.

501
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:33,245
I'm ashamed.

502
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:41,589
Come here.
Here...

503
00:31:43,132 --> 00:31:45,051
have a drink.
Yeah.

504
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,262
 

505
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,607
I'm really ashamed, too.

506
00:32:42,622 --> 00:32:44,416
 : Please, God,
if Nicholas is okay,

507
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:46,585
we'll make everything
the same again. Please, God...

508
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:53,052
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.
I wanted to make sure

509
00:32:53,135 --> 00:32:54,637
I had the biopsy results first.

510
00:32:56,848 --> 00:33:01,645
Yesterday, we released a boy
almost exactly your son's age.

511
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:05,567
He came in a year ago...
with a...

512
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:10,406
with a very similar diagnosis
and now he's going home.

513
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:14,161
Uh, Doctor, I'm a biologist,
my father's a professor of medicine.

514
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:16,080
Just tell us the truth, please.

515
00:33:17,582 --> 00:33:20,585
Well, Nicholas
has a mediastinal tumour.

516
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:24,048
No, but the prognosis is good.

517
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,178
Lymphoma B or T?

518
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:30,723
B or fucking T!

519
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:34,853
For God's sake, Henry, can youstop
showing off for once in your life?

520
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:36,355
He has cancer! Understand?
Cancer!

521
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:52,249
So... so what do we do now?

522
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:56,588
Start chemotherapy tomorrow.

523
00:33:57,965 --> 00:33:59,967
Now, Nicholas looks strong
and his blood work's back in.

524
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:01,094
It's all good.

525
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:04,431
You know, 10 years ago,
I would've said,

526
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:08,603
"Pray for a miracle." But today,
we're seeing many similar cases

527
00:34:08,686 --> 00:34:10,564
and we're treating them
successfully.

528
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,450
Jesus...

529
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:24,873
Maybe I could've
caught it in time

530
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:29,086
if only I'd taken him to the doctor
right after the skiing trip.

531
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:35,094
Honey...

532
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:37,263
it was only a few days ago.

533
00:35:02,085 --> 00:35:03,462
Okay,

534
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:06,424
you can keep Nurnies here
as long as you're in the hospital.

535
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:07,717
Spirits Nurnies.

536
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:09,303
And butterfly wings.

537
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:12,849
But if there's a loud knock
on the door and Fothum comes...

538
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:15,519
They can't come to a hospital.
You're right.

539
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:18,481
Do you still remember
the magic words to undo the spell?

540
00:35:18,564 --> 00:35:19,899
Elenda chao

541
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:21,484
tonay.
Good.

542
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:24,822
Tonight at nine, look at the
moon. - Nurnies will remind me.

543
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:27,575
I'll look too.
Dad said it's a full moon.

544
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,078
It'll be easier
to turn the spell around then.

545
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:32,206
Look!

546
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:33,624
 : Spirit

547
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:36,044
Nurnies.

548
00:35:36,086 --> 00:35:37,713
Elenda chao tonay.

549
00:35:37,796 --> 00:35:41,217
Nicole, it's time to go.

550
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:45,222
Nicole! I forgot
to show you something.

551
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:48,643
They take the chemicals
and bomb my tumour through it.

552
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:53,398
Show it to the moon.

553
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,860
He'll pour in the silver ray.
Who?

554
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:57,111
The full moon.

555
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:20,515
What are you looking at?
Can I try?

556
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:24,312
My dad doesn't let us
play video games.

557
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:26,105
He says it destroys
our imagination.

558
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:29,151
Your dad's a butthole.
And so are you.

559
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:30,569
You talk to girls.

560
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,113
It's my twin sister.

561
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:35,116
Doesn't matter. I heard you.
You talk in some stupid language.

562
00:36:35,158 --> 00:36:36,368
What is it?

563
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:39,622
Some space-alien code?
It doesn't have a name.

564
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:41,166
Welcome to our planet.

565
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:44,169
We're so dumb, our language
doesn't even have a name.

566
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:47,632
How about"Buttbarf"?
"Do you speak

567
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:51,261
Buttbarf?""Yes, I'm a butthole
from planet Moron--"

568
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:52,763
You're a butthole yourself.

569
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:54,307
Here.

570
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,142
Try it.

571
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:03,360
There! That way!

572
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:04,528
Go!

573
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:06,280
No, push this one!

574
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,450
No, not yet! Go, now, kill,

575
00:37:09,534 --> 00:37:09,993
shoot, shoot!

576
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:12,538
Kill him!

577
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:16,042
You missed him. Loser.
Why are you so bald?

578
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:19,880
It's chemotherapy.

579
00:37:19,963 --> 00:37:22,508
You'll look the same way soon.

580
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,551
Why?

581
00:37:23,593 --> 00:37:25,595
'Cause you got cancer.

582
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,557
You get cancer,
you lose your hair,

583
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,059
then you die.

584
00:37:30,143 --> 00:37:33,480
The doctor never really
said anything about that.

585
00:37:33,563 --> 00:37:35,024
They always lie.

586
00:37:35,107 --> 00:37:39,613
They can't tell you the truth,
'cause it gives them the creeps.

587
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:42,825
This guy in the next room,
he died this morning.

588
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,243
Gone, checked out,

589
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:47,789
vaporized, entered"kill zone"
and dematerialized.

590
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,627
He had cancer.
Same as you and me.

591
00:37:58,427 --> 00:38:00,513
I didn't want to believe in this stuff,
but my sister had it sent

592
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:03,433
from India.
Can't do any harm, right?

593
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:05,645
Hundred dollars a box.
Oh, my God.

594
00:38:05,728 --> 00:38:08,732
But I've had it analyzed,
there's nothing harmful in it.

595
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:10,400
And it helps Frankie to sleep.

596
00:38:11,652 --> 00:38:13,613
You should try it.
It can't hurt.

597
00:38:13,696 --> 00:38:15,407
Do you mind?
No.

598
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:17,242
That'd be great.

599
00:38:17,284 --> 00:38:21,414
Since he started the chemotherapy,
Nicholas just wakes up every hour.

600
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:24,877
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!
Oh, my God...

601
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,966
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

602
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:33,554
Mooooom! Mom!
It's all right, it's all right...

603
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:37,100
Nicholas! Nicholas, Nick...
It's okay, it's okay.

604
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:39,937
Nick, Nick...
What happened to him?

605
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:41,480
Nick, baby...

606
00:38:43,608 --> 00:38:45,068
Nick...

607
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,019
Everybody, clear.

608
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:16,065
... clear.

609
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,608
Oh, God.

610
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:21,822
Oh, God.

611
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,452
Oh, my God.

612
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,354
Nick...

613
00:39:48,396 --> 00:39:51,275
it's okay. Don't be afraid.
Mom?

614
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,987
Whoa, Nicholas. Hey,
want to be a little nicer to me

615
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:57,616
and try to respond to the
medication like a good kid?

616
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:59,410
I'm sorry.
That's okay.

617
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:01,913
What happened?
Well, he had a...

618
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:03,581
a really extreme reaction
to the chemo,

619
00:40:03,665 --> 00:40:06,668
but we're gonna, uh...
we'll try something else.

620
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:11,174
You gave me a fright.

621
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:14,303
I'm sorry about that.

622
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:19,226
Is that my hair?

623
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:21,687
Uh...
I don't wanna be bald.

624
00:40:22,897 --> 00:40:24,816
It's okay.

625
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:28,070
We'll get you some
great new hair, okay?

626
00:40:28,153 --> 00:40:31,074
What about, uh...
what about long and blond?

627
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:34,286
Would you like that?
Like you?

628
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:38,416
Like me.
Or, uh, green and spiky?

629
00:40:41,294 --> 00:40:45,132
What about if I tell you
you'll have better hairthan Nicole?

630
00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:06,409
Come on, Dad, go!

631
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:10,288
Come on, Dad! Faster!

632
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,751
You can do it! I know you can!

633
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:16,046
Come on!

634
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:19,007
Go! Go get 'em, Dad!

635
00:41:19,091 --> 00:41:20,843
 
Go!

636
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:22,011
 

637
00:41:28,144 --> 00:41:29,604
You were supposed to win!

638
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,608
 : I'm in bad shape.

639
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,318
Not enough exercise.

640
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,487
Too many cigarettes.

641
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:38,239
You really thought I could win?

642
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:40,826
We want Nicholas to be okay.
Nicole!

643
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:42,995
Who told you that?

644
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:46,124
Nobody's responsible
for Nicholas's disease. Nobody.

645
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,709
Not you, not me, not Mom.

646
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:50,046
How about God?

647
00:41:50,129 --> 00:41:51,339
God?

648
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:52,757
Because Nicholas and l
aren't baptized

649
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:54,843
and we don't go to church
enough. None of us.

650
00:41:56,846 --> 00:42:00,183
Let us pray
for this brave family.

651
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:03,187
Three years ago,
we prayed for Helena,

652
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,566
watching her long struggle
with pain and suffering.

653
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:11,238
Now her little grandson Nicholas
has to face a similar battle.

654
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:13,366
Let us pray
for his return to health.

655
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:14,451
But if the Lord

656
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:16,996
decides to have him by his side,

657
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,710
Iet us praythat he does not suffer
and reaches the other bank.

658
00:42:28,927 --> 00:42:31,221
Stupid, insensitive
son of a bitch!

659
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:42,902
You know I don't smoke.

660
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:45,197
Today just reconfirms
why I could never get into

661
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,327
any of this. You don't really need
all this hypocrisy to believe.

662
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,037
Believe in what?

663
00:42:51,121 --> 00:42:52,706
In anything.

664
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,752
Life, our kids...

665
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:57,295
you.

666
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:01,842
I believed in you.

667
00:43:09,477 --> 00:43:12,314
Not everyone is as strong
as you, Julie.

668
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:14,441
... and the Holy Spirit,
I baptize you--

669
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:16,527
What are you doing?
You have no right!

670
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:17,487
Nicole wanted it.

671
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,490
She asked me to arrange it.

672
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:21,784
Hi, Mom.

673
00:43:22,827 --> 00:43:25,455
I... I thought it could help.

674
00:43:26,998 --> 00:43:29,168
It's okay.

675
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:30,878
It's okay, sweetheart.

676
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:34,841
Would you like
to be baptized too?

677
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:37,386
Yes.
All right.

678
00:43:40,515 --> 00:43:43,310
I'm sorry, Father.
No need. I understand.

679
00:43:47,023 --> 00:43:48,608
In the name of the Father

680
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,320
and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
I baptize you

681
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:53,197
and give you the name of Nicole.

682
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:55,116
But she's already called that.

683
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,119
Can I be called Gabriella?

684
00:44:09,509 --> 00:44:11,303
There's always a chance.

685
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:16,976
Miracles happen. You...
you hear about them all the time.

686
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,689
Remember, Sam?
You've said so yourself.

687
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:23,067
I... Yes, I did.

688
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:26,488
Things are always developing.
New treatments, drugs--

689
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:29,659
Dad. Julie, what Nicholas
needs now is love and understanding.

690
00:44:29,742 --> 00:44:31,578
Love and understanding?!

691
00:44:31,661 --> 00:44:35,791
You should've thought of that before!
Maybe none of this would've happened!

692
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,543
What are you saying?

693
00:44:37,627 --> 00:44:40,088
That... that I'm responsible
for Nicholas's illness?

694
00:44:40,172 --> 00:44:42,174
Henry, please.
Please what? She thinks that...

695
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:44,510
she thinks Nicholas got sick
because I had an affair?

696
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:47,139
I've had enough of this mystic
crap! Masses, baptisms in hospitals!

697
00:44:47,222 --> 00:44:49,517
She's ready to become a member
of a goddamn sect!

698
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,645
I've been living with a woman
I didn't even know for 10 years!

699
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:55,107
There's a lot more
I didn't know about you.

700
00:44:56,275 --> 00:44:58,903
Oh, I should've slugged
that priest of yours.

701
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:00,155
You've sinned enough.

702
00:45:00,238 --> 00:45:03,951
But the child will stand pure
before Go--

703
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,953
Shut up! Just shut up!

704
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,205
I'm sick

705
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:10,125
of your ignorance,
your anti-Semitic insults

706
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:12,128
and your superstitious bullshit!

707
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:16,007
You understand? That's it.
You think your religion is the best,

708
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:17,593
you think your church
has a monopoly

709
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,971
on mercy and truth? Get down
on your knees. Let's see

710
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:22,098
your church make my son better.
Henry!

711
00:45:22,182 --> 00:45:24,184
This is not the time
for recriminations!

712
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:27,146
His mail-order girlfriend
thinks the Virgin Mary is Polish.

713
00:45:27,188 --> 00:45:29,524
Hey, Dad, did you tell her
Jesus Christ

714
00:45:29,608 --> 00:45:31,568
was Jewish?
I am not your dad!

715
00:45:31,652 --> 00:45:34,447
Stop it, for God's sake,
both of you! Nicholas is dying.

716
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:39,787
I can't...

717
00:45:39,828 --> 00:45:42,415
I just can't believe it.

718
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,348
Sorry...

719
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:58,768
Sorry... I know old mythic...

720
00:45:58,852 --> 00:46:01,939
tells me... I also...

721
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:03,858
seek--
What is she talking about?

722
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,154
I sorry. Look.

723
00:46:07,195 --> 00:46:08,822
Big tumour

724
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:10,992
and no have it.

725
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:12,076
He touches

726
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,329
and I no have it.

727
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,706
Who touches?

728
00:46:15,748 --> 00:46:18,167
 

729
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,419
Olov, the Russian healer.

730
00:46:19,502 --> 00:46:23,841
 

731
00:46:23,883 --> 00:46:26,719
He's famous. In Poland,
they show him even on TV.

732
00:46:26,803 --> 00:46:29,515
 

733
00:46:31,767 --> 00:46:33,394
He's touching his hands

734
00:46:33,478 --> 00:46:35,188
and making miracles.

735
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,024
Oh, stop this, please.

736
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:39,193
True!

737
00:46:39,235 --> 00:46:40,612
Two years no tumour.

738
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:43,198
Where? Where is he?

739
00:46:43,281 --> 00:46:45,242
How do we find him?
 

740
00:46:46,828 --> 00:46:50,248
She'll call her sister
to find out.

741
00:46:50,332 --> 00:46:52,585
What are you doing?
Call her. Right now. Please.

742
00:46:52,668 --> 00:46:54,420
Julie...

743
00:46:54,504 --> 00:46:57,174
Julie, look at me.
Now I know

744
00:46:57,257 --> 00:47:00,136
how hopeless you feel. I do too.
But this is nothing

745
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:01,471
but superstition.
And desperation,

746
00:47:01,554 --> 00:47:03,598
because that's what these people
feed off of.

747
00:47:03,682 --> 00:47:06,393
That's what they take advantage
of. Come here. This woman

748
00:47:06,477 --> 00:47:09,355
is a lunatic. Can't you see that?
You always call women crazy

749
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:11,691
when they have answers
you can't understand.

750
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:14,069
You call them witches,
lock them up,

751
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:17,824
burn them at the stake.
Well... well, what if it's true?

752
00:47:17,907 --> 00:47:21,662
What... what if Bogusha's right
and you're wrong?

753
00:47:21,745 --> 00:47:23,748
 

754
00:47:28,295 --> 00:47:29,547
You're not taking him
to Poland.

755
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,674
Uh--
So forget it. You're not going!

756
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:33,301
He's not going!
He's not leaving!

757
00:47:33,385 --> 00:47:36,222
He's allergic to the chemo!
Nothing else is working!

758
00:47:36,305 --> 00:47:37,682
We have to try it!

759
00:47:37,765 --> 00:47:39,100
Faith healers. Faith healers!

760
00:47:39,142 --> 00:47:41,937
We might as well put ourfaith
in fortune cookies.

761
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:44,816
Why spend money on research?
Let's just go stick needles

762
00:47:44,857 --> 00:47:46,443
into dolls--
Henry, please listen to me.

763
00:47:46,484 --> 00:47:50,072
During the war in Europe,
people were saved by miracles.

764
00:47:50,155 --> 00:47:52,283
They escaped death
only by miracles.

765
00:47:52,325 --> 00:47:55,287
All because they had faith.
Mom, this has nothing to do

766
00:47:55,328 --> 00:47:56,079
with the Holocaust.

767
00:47:57,706 --> 00:47:59,709
 

768
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,342
Henry, I have to try it.

769
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,637
With your permission orwithout.

770
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:14,310
What if he dies over there?

771
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:18,816
I tell you...

772
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,192
he won't die.

773
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:21,277
Mom?

774
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:24,781
Yes, baby?
I'm scared.

775
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:29,996
Why are you scared?
I don't know. I'm scared.

776
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,665
I don't wanna--

777
00:48:31,748 --> 00:48:33,250
You don't wanna what?

778
00:48:36,212 --> 00:48:37,672
Nothing.

779
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:45,348
The priest baptized me
so I wouldn't go

780
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,893
to the abyss, right?

781
00:48:47,935 --> 00:48:49,520
What abyss?

782
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:52,607
When you're good,
you go to heaven;

783
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:55,277
when you're bad, you go to hell.

784
00:48:55,361 --> 00:48:58,364
But when you're in the middle,
it's purgatory.

785
00:48:58,406 --> 00:49:02,161
But when you're not baptized,
you go to the abyss.

786
00:49:02,244 --> 00:49:04,872
For eternity. Forever.

787
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,337
Is that what Grandpa told you?
Yeah.

788
00:49:10,421 --> 00:49:12,465
He really believes
in this stuff.

789
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:16,053
And what do you think?
I don't know.

790
00:49:16,095 --> 00:49:18,931
But it's better not to take
any chances,

791
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:22,519
Grandpa got me baptized
just in case if I die.

792
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:26,607
You're not gonna die.

793
00:49:26,691 --> 00:49:29,111
Nicole got baptized too
and she's not dying.

794
00:49:29,194 --> 00:49:31,697
She's perfectly fine
and you will be too.

795
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,241
You understand?

796
00:49:36,536 --> 00:49:39,623
Mom, I just don't want
it to hurt.

797
00:49:39,707 --> 00:49:41,751
Is it going to hurt me?

798
00:49:44,463 --> 00:49:46,006
No.

799
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,592
Mom?

800
00:49:47,675 --> 00:49:51,972
If Nicole's name is Gabriella,
should mine

801
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,516
be Gabriel?

802
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,479
Well, if you want
to get baptized again,

803
00:49:57,562 --> 00:49:59,314
we can change it.

804
00:49:59,398 --> 00:50:03,444
You can be baptized as many times
as you like, if it makes you happy.

805
00:50:06,824 --> 00:50:09,952
You haven't got a headache
or anything? Nothing's hurting?

806
00:50:09,994 --> 00:50:13,165
No.
That's good.

807
00:50:13,248 --> 00:50:14,583
You make me happy

808
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:15,835
when you say that.

809
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:17,795
I don't want to worry about

810
00:50:17,837 --> 00:50:19,631
what Grandpa says, all right?

811
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:21,175
Why?

812
00:50:23,845 --> 00:50:25,346
Because you're not gonna die.

813
00:50:26,848 --> 00:50:28,934
I hope not.

814
00:50:29,018 --> 00:50:31,103
I promise you.

815
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:19,496
Spine.

816
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:24,753
Chest.

817
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:30,844
Spine.

818
00:51:32,763 --> 00:51:34,223
Spine.

819
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,279
Chest.

820
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:50,701
Eyes.

821
00:52:02,675 --> 00:52:04,135
Head.

822
00:52:05,845 --> 00:52:08,056
 

823
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,600
Head.

824
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:16,316
Eyes.

825
00:52:18,986 --> 00:52:20,488
Eyes.

826
00:52:25,995 --> 00:52:27,497
Chest.

827
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:34,130
He has nothing.

828
00:52:34,213 --> 00:52:35,673
He is healthy.

829
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,807
 

830
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:20,187
This woman, with the child,
blond hair, attached.

831
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:23,858
Yeah.

832
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,366
Spine.

833
00:53:34,287 --> 00:53:35,747
 
I'm sorry,

834
00:53:35,831 --> 00:53:38,459
I don't speak Polish.
Come on.

835
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:40,253
Come on, follow me.

836
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,572
Spine.
Alexy.

837
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,032
Alexy.

838
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:11,458
Careful.

839
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,591
Cancer. Chest.

840
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:19,134
They don't speak Polish.

841
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:44,373
Stop.

842
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:56,013
Want some water?
Want something to drink?

843
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:04,774
Are you gonna be here more?
I'm finished.

844
00:55:04,857 --> 00:55:06,818
You sure?
Yeah, finished.

845
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:27,404
 

846
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,840
My sweetest, my sweetest boy,
please don't go.

847
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:48,680
Please, please, please,
please, please.

848
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:52,101
Please, try.

849
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,981
Please. Keep breathing,

850
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:58,526
please. Please, please.

851
00:56:15,714 --> 00:56:17,341
Oh, please.

852
00:56:44,082 --> 00:56:46,501
Hello, Henry?

853
00:56:46,585 --> 00:56:48,796
Can you hear me?

854
00:56:48,879 --> 00:56:50,548
 
Christ.

855
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:56,722
Come on,

856
00:56:56,806 --> 00:56:59,059
you gotta try, sweetheart,
you gotta try. Heh?

857
00:57:02,605 --> 00:57:04,065
Please try.

858
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:08,236
Please, please, please try.

859
00:57:27,218 --> 00:57:28,678
Nick!

860
00:57:30,472 --> 00:57:32,558
Nick?

861
00:57:47,243 --> 00:57:49,746
Baby.
Mom, they don't even have a clue

862
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:52,583
about baseball here.

863
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:54,210
This game does not

864
00:57:54,293 --> 00:57:56,296
make sense to me. It is impossible
to understand whatsoever.

865
00:57:56,379 --> 00:57:59,675
You hit a ball then chase it
toward something

866
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:03,137
called a pack.
It's base. I told you that already.

867
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:05,515
See? He doesn't even get it
at all.

868
00:58:07,518 --> 00:58:11,022
Alexy wanted me to tell you
that your boy needs more sessions.

869
00:58:11,106 --> 00:58:13,442
This kind of disease
demands more than one touch.

870
00:58:13,525 --> 00:58:14,777
You mean right away?

871
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,989
Oh, no. Our next stop
is Jelenia Gora.

872
00:58:18,031 --> 00:58:20,659
Here is the address and the map.

873
00:58:20,701 --> 00:58:22,953
We'll spend a day over there.

874
00:58:23,037 --> 00:58:25,665
Then we go to Krakow
and Bielsko.

875
00:58:25,707 --> 00:58:29,336
You will have to follow us
as long as there is need.

876
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,547
I... How do I pay him?

877
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:33,717
I only have credit cards.
No, no, no.

878
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,928
Don't worry.
He doesn't take any money.

879
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:37,471
We cover all the expenses.

880
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:41,434
Any country he goes to, there is
a special committee who takes care

881
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,979
of everything.
Money does not interest him.

882
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,357
Thank you so much.

883
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,859
Thank you.

884
00:58:49,945 --> 00:58:51,864
Tell him how grateful we are.
Okay.

885
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:56,328
We'll go anywhere.

886
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:59,081
Nicholas, say thank you.
Thank you.

887
00:58:59,165 --> 00:59:01,167
Maybe you will teach me
this baseball

888
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:04,129
if we travel together.
See you later.

889
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:05,631
Oh, wait. Please.

890
00:59:05,714 --> 00:59:07,884
Can I ask you a question?

891
00:59:09,052 --> 00:59:10,345
What is he like?

892
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,723
I mean,
what kind of a man is he?

893
00:59:12,806 --> 00:59:14,392
Man?

894
00:59:14,475 --> 00:59:17,687
Even when he was a child,
his gift would pour out if him.

895
00:59:19,064 --> 00:59:21,734
He's like a river of... Iife.

896
01:00:05,455 --> 01:00:07,248
 

897
01:00:14,007 --> 01:00:15,008
 
Moo!

898
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:16,844
Close the window, honey,

899
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:19,931
it's stinks.
No way. I'm talking to the cows.

900
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:31,862
Oh, no, no, wait.
I think that was a good decision.

901
01:00:31,945 --> 01:00:34,449
A little impetuous, but it was
good. - It's my impulse.

902
01:00:34,532 --> 01:00:37,828
It was good. You know--
The door looks great, you know.

903
01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:39,622
Looks like it's been there
for... forever.

904
01:00:39,705 --> 01:00:40,915
At least a couple...

905
01:00:40,998 --> 01:00:44,920
Hey, watch out.
She's spying on us.

906
01:00:45,003 --> 01:00:46,964
Clever girl.
 

907
01:00:50,677 --> 01:00:53,347
Hello?.. Mom!..

908
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,683
What did you say?..

909
01:00:57,393 --> 01:00:58,979
I can't hear you...

910
01:01:00,689 --> 01:01:03,025
Yeah, he's right here...

911
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:04,193
No, no...

912
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:06,321
Oh, I'm fine...

913
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:08,949
Can I talk to him?

914
01:01:11,286 --> 01:01:13,538
Nick!..

915
01:01:13,622 --> 01:01:14,915
What did you say?

916
01:01:14,998 --> 01:01:17,376
Cows? What cows?..

917
01:01:18,962 --> 01:01:21,256
Nick...
Let me talk to them.

918
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,428
We were cut off.
What did she say about Nicholas?

919
01:01:27,138 --> 01:01:28,432
He's fine.

920
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:32,437
Say it again.
He's fine, he's good,

921
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,646
he's not gonna die.

922
01:01:36,483 --> 01:01:38,027
He said they nearly
ran into some cows.

923
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,740
Cows?
On a road. He said the roads there

924
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:45,786
are full of cows.
And that they understand English.

925
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,081
The cows understand English?

926
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:52,294
Legs.

927
01:01:53,379 --> 01:01:54,839
Head.

928
01:01:58,302 --> 01:01:59,762
Head.

929
01:02:19,494 --> 01:02:20,663
Stomach.

930
01:02:27,504 --> 01:02:29,632
 

931
01:02:29,715 --> 01:02:31,468
Sorry, I don't speak Polish.

932
01:02:33,178 --> 01:02:35,973
Oh, sorry.
I saw you in Walbrzsych.

933
01:02:36,057 --> 01:02:38,268
Now I look at the child
and I can't get over it.

934
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:39,811
He was dying, wasn't he?

935
01:02:39,853 --> 01:02:42,731
I'm a physician
and I used to ridicule him.

936
01:02:42,815 --> 01:02:44,984
Until one of my patients
came to try this.

937
01:02:45,026 --> 01:02:47,738
I had given him a death sentence
a few months earlier

938
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:50,157
and he resurrected him.
So now you believe.

939
01:02:50,241 --> 01:02:51,993
I do and I don't.

940
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:55,122
Official medicine
gave up on him.

941
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:57,166
But I feel I have no right
not to try.

942
01:02:58,209 --> 01:03:02,172
What's the name of your boy?
Nicholas.

943
01:03:02,255 --> 01:03:03,674
Nicholas! Come on!

944
01:03:03,757 --> 01:03:05,760
Nice kid.
Very nice kid.

945
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:14,228
Hey.

946
01:03:14,312 --> 01:03:16,398
Just in time.

947
01:03:16,481 --> 01:03:17,941
It's all right. Go on.

948
01:03:27,495 --> 01:03:28,955
Come on.

949
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,888
You're exhausted.
Yes,

950
01:03:41,971 --> 01:03:43,890
I am.

951
01:03:43,932 --> 01:03:45,517
Why are you doing this?

952
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,479
I have to. I just have to.

953
01:03:50,523 --> 01:03:52,400
Eyes.

954
01:03:53,777 --> 01:03:55,905
Mom. Mom...

955
01:03:57,699 --> 01:03:59,117
Uh, a cow.

956
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,286
It's not a cow.

957
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,788
It's a bird.

958
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:12,258
We should go. I promised
I'd help her with some stuff.

959
01:04:17,765 --> 01:04:20,143
 : I think
he has a crush on you.

960
01:04:20,226 --> 01:04:20,685
Shhh.

961
01:04:51,306 --> 01:04:53,142
Nicholas.

962
01:04:55,019 --> 01:04:56,980
Mom, can I have
some ice cream?

963
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:58,273
Will you be cold?

964
01:04:58,315 --> 01:05:00,693
No.
Okay.

965
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:02,362
Get some for him too.

966
01:05:05,866 --> 01:05:07,493
But hurry. Be quick, okay?

967
01:05:11,331 --> 01:05:12,833
Eyes.

968
01:05:51,172 --> 01:05:53,007
Head.

969
01:05:53,091 --> 01:05:54,801
Spine.

970
01:05:57,429 --> 01:05:58,889
Spine.

971
01:06:01,977 --> 01:06:03,395
Chest.

972
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:09,778
Can I have some?
Sure.

973
01:06:12,072 --> 01:06:13,783
Mmm.
You can have it if you want.

974
01:06:13,866 --> 01:06:16,953
Oh. Thank you."Speciva."
"Speciva."

975
01:06:19,623 --> 01:06:21,542
That was nice.

976
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:23,211
 

977
01:06:31,847 --> 01:06:33,349
My mom's a great singer.

978
01:06:33,432 --> 01:06:35,268
Ask her to sing.
No!

979
01:06:35,309 --> 01:06:37,604
Yes.
No, I haven't sung in ages.

980
01:06:37,645 --> 01:06:40,232
I'm not singing.
It's a lie. Nicholas told us

981
01:06:40,315 --> 01:06:41,734
everything.
No.

982
01:06:41,817 --> 01:06:43,277
Ask her.

983
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:47,324
Mom, come on.
Show them how good you are.

984
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:48,576
Make me proud.

985
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:50,620
All right. I'll do it for you.

986
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:53,999
Uh...

987
01:06:54,082 --> 01:06:56,836
you won't know this one,
but Nicholas likes it, so...

988
01:07:05,179 --> 01:07:06,931
I am a poor wayfaring stranger

989
01:07:07,015 --> 01:07:10,644
Travelling through...

990
01:07:10,686 --> 01:07:14,482
This world of woe

991
01:07:14,566 --> 01:07:16,777
There is no trouble...

992
01:07:18,863 --> 01:07:22,159
Nor toil nor danger

993
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,955
In that bright land...

994
01:07:26,038 --> 01:07:27,832
To where I go

995
01:07:30,419 --> 01:07:33,256
I'm going there...

996
01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:35,675
To see my mother

997
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:40,473
I'm going there...

998
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:45,646
No more to roam

999
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:46,897
I'm just

1000
01:07:46,981 --> 01:07:52,279
A-going over Jordan

1001
01:07:53,906 --> 01:07:59,204
I'm just a-going

1002
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,081
Over home

1003
01:08:34,831 --> 01:08:36,291
Ahem.

1004
01:08:46,471 --> 01:08:47,931
So beautiful.

1005
01:08:48,974 --> 01:08:49,725
Mountains.

1006
01:08:49,766 --> 01:08:51,393
Yes.

1007
01:08:51,477 --> 01:08:53,855
Yes. Yes, they are beautiful.

1008
01:08:53,938 --> 01:08:56,358
But I prefer flats.

1009
01:08:56,441 --> 01:08:58,777
And forests. I like trees.

1010
01:08:59,987 --> 01:09:01,447
Touching trees.

1011
01:09:02,991 --> 01:09:05,995
Is it flat
where you come from?

1012
01:09:06,078 --> 01:09:08,289
Yeah. Only chimneys
and factories.

1013
01:09:08,373 --> 01:09:12,544
First time I saw mountains,
I was old as Nicholas --

1014
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:14,171
maybe eight, nine.

1015
01:09:14,255 --> 01:09:19,720
I went on vacation in Caucasus
and I saw some peaks in clouds.

1016
01:09:19,803 --> 01:09:23,641
I thought I could touch the sky
too if I got there.

1017
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:24,976
And did you?

1018
01:09:25,018 --> 01:09:28,189
Oh, no! It's not

1019
01:09:28,272 --> 01:09:29,732
so easy.

1020
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:34,822
Where did you learn
your English?

1021
01:09:34,864 --> 01:09:37,533
I was in England, a few times.
And in India,

1022
01:09:37,617 --> 01:09:39,286
nobody speaks Russian.

1023
01:09:39,369 --> 01:09:44,167
Too bad.
It's such a pretty language.

1024
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,503
 

1025
01:09:46,586 --> 01:09:48,130
Like music.

1026
01:09:48,213 --> 01:09:49,381
 

1027
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:55,180
Say something else in Russian.

1028
01:10:02,022 --> 01:10:03,524
 

1029
01:10:12,743 --> 01:10:14,204
What does that mean?

1030
01:10:16,874 --> 01:10:18,375
 

1031
01:10:24,675 --> 01:10:26,177
I don't understand.

1032
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,054
I know a little bit of Polish,

1033
01:10:28,096 --> 01:10:30,724
but I don't speak Russian,
so tell me

1034
01:10:30,807 --> 01:10:32,726
what it means.

1035
01:10:32,768 --> 01:10:36,022
It means you are...

1036
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:37,399
very special.

1037
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:40,903
Beautiful, too. Thank you.

1038
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,239
No, no, no, no... No,

1039
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:45,242
it's... it's...

1040
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:47,077
you who would...

1041
01:10:48,955 --> 01:10:52,334
All that you've done for me,
for Nick, for all these people, it's...

1042
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:55,087
me that has to thank you.

1043
01:10:56,631 --> 01:10:59,426
Please, no.

1044
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:00,969
Please.

1045
01:11:06,351 --> 01:11:07,895
Why are you so..?

1046
01:11:26,334 --> 01:11:27,794
Who's my favourite boy?

1047
01:11:58,999 --> 01:12:01,002
'Morning.

1048
01:12:01,085 --> 01:12:04,256
I was looking for Alexy.
He just left

1049
01:12:04,339 --> 01:12:06,175
for Warsaw to catch a flight
to India.

1050
01:12:07,718 --> 01:12:10,347
India.

1051
01:12:10,388 --> 01:12:13,684
I... But I... I thought you said
that he was leaving later today.

1052
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:15,436
 

1053
01:12:22,862 --> 01:12:25,782
I wanted to say goodbye.
He left at dawn.

1054
01:12:25,866 --> 01:12:28,869
He often does it. Makes up his
mind at the last moment,

1055
01:12:28,953 --> 01:12:31,581
packs up and off he goes.

1056
01:12:34,042 --> 01:12:36,379
And Nicholas did not teach me
how to...

1057
01:12:36,462 --> 01:12:39,674
play baseball.
No.

1058
01:12:39,758 --> 01:12:42,052
Uh... could you give this to him

1059
01:12:42,094 --> 01:12:43,637
from me?
You know he doesn't take anything.

1060
01:12:43,721 --> 01:12:46,057
No, no, no.
It's just a shirt, okay?

1061
01:12:46,141 --> 01:12:49,603
The one that he wears all the
time is about to fall apart

1062
01:12:49,687 --> 01:12:51,522
and I thought that--
A shirt?

1063
01:12:51,606 --> 01:12:54,776
No, I don't think there will be
any problem with a shirt.

1064
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,153
 : I put our address

1065
01:12:56,236 --> 01:12:57,988
in Canada inside, just in case.

1066
01:12:58,072 --> 01:13:00,992
Could you make sure
that he gets that?

1067
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:03,579
Sure. We'll send it to him.

1068
01:13:24,521 --> 01:13:26,065
Maybe they missed the flight.
I hope not.

1069
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:31,613
There... there they are!
Look! Look!

1070
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:46,131
Oh, yeah! Oh!
Grandpa!

1071
01:13:46,214 --> 01:13:47,299
Hello.
 : We missed you so much.

1072
01:13:47,383 --> 01:13:48,217
We missed you too.

1073
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,012
Lots of stories to tell you.

1074
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:53,307
I can't see you any bigger,

1075
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:57,311
but you grew fatter.
Three and half pounds!

1076
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:01,942
They lost our bags.

1077
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:03,110
Hi.
Hi.

1078
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:05,488
Hi, Nicholas.
Hi, Nicole.

1079
01:14:07,073 --> 01:14:11,120
Thanks for coming, Dad.

1080
01:14:11,204 --> 01:14:12,539
I missed you more.

1081
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:15,250
They lost our bags.
That's why we were so late.

1082
01:14:15,334 --> 01:14:16,919
Let's go.

1083
01:14:21,132 --> 01:14:22,634
You go to my place

1084
01:14:22,718 --> 01:14:24,637
or yours?
I guess it'll be better

1085
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,432
if we stay together for a while.
All right, then.

1086
01:14:31,312 --> 01:14:32,855
I love you, Julie.

1087
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:35,650
You saved our son.
It wasn't me.

1088
01:14:35,734 --> 01:14:37,736
It was Alexy who saved him.

1089
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,447
Well, then, I love him too.

1090
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:44,745
Dad looks terrible.

1091
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:47,999
His beloved Bogusha dumped
him. Met some other Polish guy.

1092
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,793
A bit younger, I gather.
 

1093
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:55,174
Dad, you have to open the door
to get through it.

1094
01:15:04,144 --> 01:15:05,520
Honey, what are you doing?

1095
01:15:05,562 --> 01:15:08,107
I check myself in the mirror
every night

1096
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:10,693
to make sure
I don't catch cancer.

1097
01:15:10,777 --> 01:15:14,990
You can't catch cancer.
It's not a contagious disease.

1098
01:15:15,074 --> 01:15:16,701
But we're twins.
Doesn't matter.

1099
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:18,453
You're separate people.

1100
01:15:18,536 --> 01:15:21,999
And anyway, you can't catch something
that's gone. It doesn't exist.

1101
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:23,292
Nicholas isn't sick anymore.

1102
01:15:23,376 --> 01:15:24,878
You understand?

1103
01:15:24,961 --> 01:15:26,421
Yeah.

1104
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,595
Tonight, can you put Nicholas's
bed right next to mine

1105
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:34,640
when he goes to sleep?
Okay.

1106
01:15:36,809 --> 01:15:39,103
Aren't you gonna say good night
to Nurnies?

1107
01:15:41,898 --> 01:15:44,402
She must be downstairs
with Nicholas.

1108
01:15:44,485 --> 01:15:45,445
Okay.

1109
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:50,826
What's it gonna be? Ah!
 

1110
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:56,249
So how was it?
It was great.

1111
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,586
I really liked it there.
And the man?

1112
01:15:58,627 --> 01:16:00,755
The healer.
Alexy?

1113
01:16:00,797 --> 01:16:02,299
Yes, Alexy.

1114
01:16:02,382 --> 01:16:05,803
How many times did you see him?
Hundreds of times.

1115
01:16:05,886 --> 01:16:09,307
And millions of people
stand in line to wait for him.

1116
01:16:09,391 --> 01:16:10,600
And he chose me.

1117
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:12,853
What do you mean,
he chose you?

1118
01:16:12,937 --> 01:16:15,982
He saw us in a big crowd,
me and Mom,

1119
01:16:16,066 --> 01:16:20,279
and he told us to come first.
He was so nice to me and Mom.

1120
01:16:20,321 --> 01:16:21,447
Really.

1121
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:23,992
He made dates with her.
All the time.

1122
01:16:26,537 --> 01:16:29,165
Like what kind of dates?
What did they do?

1123
01:16:29,248 --> 01:16:31,209
He can do anything he wants.

1124
01:16:31,293 --> 01:16:34,171
Once, he brung this man
who weighed over 400 pounds,

1125
01:16:34,213 --> 01:16:37,425
and lifted him over his head
with one hand. Like this.

1126
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,680
But what did he do to you?

1127
01:16:49,857 --> 01:16:51,359
His hands were hot.

1128
01:16:53,028 --> 01:16:56,866
And he never gave you nothing?
He never gave you any...

1129
01:16:56,949 --> 01:16:58,201
any, like, pills or...

1130
01:16:58,284 --> 01:17:01,413
herbs or... nothing?

1131
01:17:01,496 --> 01:17:05,501
I want to send a video on how
to play baseball to Piotr, okay?

1132
01:17:05,585 --> 01:17:07,420
Yeah, we can do that.

1133
01:17:52,392 --> 01:17:54,145
I missed you so much, Julie.

1134
01:17:57,941 --> 01:17:59,484
Do you know that?

1135
01:18:34,444 --> 01:18:35,946
Come back to me.

1136
01:18:35,988 --> 01:18:39,117
You're gonna have to give me
some time to get used to all this.

1137
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:44,832
You smell different.

1138
01:18:47,836 --> 01:18:50,506
There's something different
about you. I can feel it.

1139
01:19:01,352 --> 01:19:03,146
It's him, isn't it?

1140
01:19:06,734 --> 01:19:09,779
I don't... I don't even know
how to describe it.

1141
01:19:11,698 --> 01:19:14,243
It's so... different.

1142
01:19:14,327 --> 01:19:16,454
It's... it's unreal.

1143
01:19:18,623 --> 01:19:22,545
I don't even know if he's...
interested in our world,

1144
01:19:22,628 --> 01:19:24,422
in normal feelings and women.

1145
01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:26,508
Probably a good thing.

1146
01:19:26,592 --> 01:19:28,678
I'm sure there's an awful lot
of women

1147
01:19:28,761 --> 01:19:30,638
that would like to show
their gratitude.

1148
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:18,531
 

1149
01:20:31,129 --> 01:20:33,424
It could be a coincidence.

1150
01:20:33,466 --> 01:20:35,802
There are cases
of spontaneous remission.

1151
01:20:35,844 --> 01:20:38,597
Are you sure the Russian man
only touched him?

1152
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:39,556
No tumour.

1153
01:20:50,695 --> 01:20:52,656
Dad!

1154
01:20:55,785 --> 01:20:57,245
Dad!

1155
01:21:03,836 --> 01:21:05,797
Dad, what is going on?

1156
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,342
I've been calling you now
for three days.

1157
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,681
Why'd you throw it back?

1158
01:21:12,722 --> 01:21:16,185
I didn't like her face.
Stupid snout.

1159
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:20,023
You okay?

1160
01:21:22,109 --> 01:21:24,028
I'm... okay.

1161
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:26,364
I just drunk... too much.

1162
01:21:26,406 --> 01:21:30,202
You were right. This Bogusha,

1163
01:21:30,244 --> 01:21:32,705
she was an ordinary bitch.

1164
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:37,836
But she did me good.

1165
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,881
She...

1166
01:21:39,922 --> 01:21:42,133
made him stand up.

1167
01:21:45,221 --> 01:21:47,348
And she saved Nick.

1168
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:53,564
So, you know,
everything makes sense.

1169
01:21:58,946 --> 01:22:00,740
 

1170
01:23:12,828 --> 01:23:16,082
 

1171
01:24:38,893 --> 01:24:40,770
 

1172
01:24:47,361 --> 01:24:48,821
Hello?

1173
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:55,788
Alexy.

1174
01:24:58,959 --> 01:25:01,837
I know that it's you.
I can hear your breath.

1175
01:25:01,921 --> 01:25:03,381
Say something.

1176
01:25:04,925 --> 01:25:06,051
Say anything.

1177
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:07,595
Where are you?

1178
01:25:09,138 --> 01:25:11,224
Are you still there?

1179
01:25:15,062 --> 01:25:18,274
Please, just...
just tell me what to do.

1180
01:25:18,316 --> 01:25:21,528
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

1181
01:25:21,612 --> 01:25:22,780
Where are--
 

1182
01:25:47,394 --> 01:25:48,854
We can't go on like this.

1183
01:25:52,567 --> 01:25:54,944
I'm just gonna take the kids
and go to my sister's.

1184
01:25:57,239 --> 01:25:59,450
Henry...

1185
01:25:59,533 --> 01:26:01,411
I don't... know--

1186
01:26:01,494 --> 01:26:02,913
You shouldn't
say anything yet.

1187
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:04,999
Just take your time
and think about it.

1188
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,542
And I will do the same.

1189
01:26:10,881 --> 01:26:12,007
Ah, Julie,

1190
01:26:12,049 --> 01:26:14,010
I love you so much.

1191
01:26:14,051 --> 01:26:15,219
I know.

1192
01:26:18,765 --> 01:26:20,685
I've disappointed you.

1193
01:26:20,726 --> 01:26:22,478
I can see it in your eyes.

1194
01:26:22,562 --> 01:26:24,147
What do you want me to say?

1195
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:26,233
No, I'm not talking
about my affair.

1196
01:26:33,408 --> 01:26:36,245
I feel I've disappointed you
in a...

1197
01:26:36,287 --> 01:26:37,747
global sense.

1198
01:26:41,627 --> 01:26:43,004
Say something.

1199
01:26:45,298 --> 01:26:47,467
We've been through
a very difficult period.

1200
01:26:47,551 --> 01:26:49,428
It's a generic answer, Julie.

1201
01:26:49,512 --> 01:26:52,432
I think I deserve
a little better than that.

1202
01:26:55,269 --> 01:26:58,940
You used to look at me
with some kind of, uh...

1203
01:26:59,023 --> 01:27:01,693
I dunno --

1204
01:27:01,777 --> 01:27:03,237
pride.

1205
01:27:05,949 --> 01:27:07,701
It's gone, though.

1206
01:27:07,784 --> 01:27:10,538
I'm so confused.
Why?

1207
01:27:10,621 --> 01:27:12,707
I think he needs me.

1208
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:14,209
Is it because you feel

1209
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:16,628
that... that you owe him
for...

1210
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:18,130
for Nick?

1211
01:27:19,674 --> 01:27:22,552
No, it's not like that at all.
It's, uh...

1212
01:27:22,636 --> 01:27:24,930
It's more.
Well, I... I don't think

1213
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:26,474
I could hear it.

1214
01:27:30,145 --> 01:27:33,274
I think we both need a little
time. I need a little time.

1215
01:27:35,819 --> 01:27:38,530
I'm just gonna go
and get the kids.

1216
01:29:08,266 --> 01:29:09,601
Julia!

1217
01:29:10,769 --> 01:29:12,271
Julie!

1218
01:29:39,262 --> 01:29:40,764
I'm here.
You came.

1219
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:57,493
The turn is two clicks
off the main road,

1220
01:29:57,576 --> 01:29:59,120
and up the hill...

1221
01:29:59,162 --> 01:30:01,414
Is it the only house up there?

1222
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:06,337
Right, right. And the key
is under the mat. I got that.

1223
01:30:07,505 --> 01:30:09,299
Monica, I don't know
how to thank you.

1224
01:30:11,093 --> 01:30:14,472
What? It's breaking up.
She's gone.

1225
01:30:14,514 --> 01:30:16,600
Careful!

1226
01:30:17,684 --> 01:30:19,478
Hey, I'm an excellent driver.

1227
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,938
Okay?

1228
01:30:21,022 --> 01:30:25,861
I am sorry. Um, for me,
it is all too complicated, this car.

1229
01:30:25,945 --> 01:30:29,366
I don't understand it.
Nick'll explain it to you.

1230
01:30:29,449 --> 01:30:31,869
You should learn how to drive
anyway.

1231
01:30:34,038 --> 01:30:36,332
We will see. We'll see.

1232
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,090
Don't be afraid.

1233
01:31:50,132 --> 01:31:53,469
I'll teach you.
I'll teach you everything.

1234
01:31:57,766 --> 01:31:59,727
The key under the mat.

1235
01:34:46,766 --> 01:34:49,143
It's easy.

1236
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:39,205
Slowly. Slowly.

1237
01:35:39,247 --> 01:35:40,749
Okay?

1238
01:36:21,424 --> 01:36:22,133
Hi, Rebecca.
 

1239
01:36:23,384 --> 01:36:26,221
Hi, guys. This is Julie.

1240
01:36:26,305 --> 01:36:29,976
Uh, Henry, um, I'm up
at Monica's cabin for a while.

1241
01:36:30,059 --> 01:36:32,729
I'll probably stay here
a couple of days

1242
01:36:32,813 --> 01:36:36,818
and, uh, the phone... Well,
there is no phone in the cabin

1243
01:36:36,901 --> 01:36:39,237
and the cell phone's
not working, so...

1244
01:36:39,321 --> 01:36:41,657
I guess I'll just call you back.

1245
01:36:43,451 --> 01:36:44,619
Okay.

1246
01:36:44,702 --> 01:36:46,162
Bye.

1247
01:36:47,956 --> 01:36:49,625
See this dog?

1248
01:36:49,667 --> 01:36:51,794
My father had one just like her.

1249
01:36:51,836 --> 01:36:53,630
It was his favourite.
 

1250
01:36:53,672 --> 01:36:55,215
 
When I was seven,

1251
01:36:55,299 --> 01:36:57,677
he got an ulcer on his head.
The veterinarian

1252
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,056
wanted to put him to sleep,
but I knew I could help him.

1253
01:37:01,139 --> 01:37:02,432
How did you know?

1254
01:37:02,516 --> 01:37:03,976
Just felt it.

1255
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:07,814
This kind of urge
that I had to do it,

1256
01:37:07,856 --> 01:37:09,441
because I had this power.

1257
01:37:09,525 --> 01:37:11,110
As a matter of fact,

1258
01:37:11,193 --> 01:37:13,321
the dog
was my first real patient.

1259
01:37:14,906 --> 01:37:16,867
I took his head in my hands

1260
01:37:16,909 --> 01:37:19,537
and he was healed, in no time.

1261
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:21,247
After I saved the dog,
my father

1262
01:37:21,331 --> 01:37:22,624
didn't beat me anymore.

1263
01:37:22,707 --> 01:37:26,045
Even though I was still
a lousy pupil at school.

1264
01:37:27,088 --> 01:37:29,090
The dog is still alive.
My father,

1265
01:37:29,174 --> 01:37:30,842
he is dead, but the dog
is still running around.

1266
01:37:30,884 --> 01:37:31,719
How old is he?

1267
01:37:31,802 --> 01:37:34,430
Forty-three years old.

1268
01:37:34,514 --> 01:37:37,267
You liar!

1269
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:39,269
I can't believe
a word that you say.

1270
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:44,860
And then, at the asylum,
the same thing happened

1271
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:47,738
Iike when I was little boy.
The director

1272
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:51,159
called a specialist
from a parapsychological institute

1273
01:37:51,243 --> 01:37:55,581
and they start to make this test
with me.

1274
01:37:55,665 --> 01:37:57,208
Was it terrible?

1275
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:01,255
Oh, no, it was not horrible.
Just, I, uh...

1276
01:38:01,338 --> 01:38:02,673
Iosing time.

1277
01:38:02,757 --> 01:38:06,094
Then they see my gifts,
so they started to send me

1278
01:38:06,136 --> 01:38:08,764
to different big shots
Yeah, politicals, yes?

1279
01:38:08,848 --> 01:38:12,686
So I cured them and theirwives
and their mothers-in-law

1280
01:38:12,769 --> 01:38:16,482
and... And one of them arranged
passport for me, so I went abroad

1281
01:38:16,565 --> 01:38:21,196
and I started to healing people
all the time.

1282
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,617
I travelled and healed, travelled
and healed -- all the time.

1283
01:38:24,659 --> 01:38:26,911
That was my life.

1284
01:38:28,330 --> 01:38:30,499
Do you regret?

1285
01:38:30,583 --> 01:38:32,210
What?

1286
01:38:32,293 --> 01:38:34,796
Things you had before.
Before you met me.

1287
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,633
Oh, no.

1288
01:38:37,716 --> 01:38:40,428
I have nothing before you.
Nothing.

1289
01:38:47,145 --> 01:38:48,396
Julie?

1290
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,940
And the children?

1291
01:38:51,901 --> 01:38:55,113
You know Nicholas
is already very fond of you.

1292
01:38:55,155 --> 01:38:58,117
They'll love you.
It's impossible not to love you.

1293
01:39:03,081 --> 01:39:06,001
It's that I am not sure

1294
01:39:06,085 --> 01:39:09,005
if you love me
because Nicholas recovered

1295
01:39:09,088 --> 01:39:11,591
or is it because it's me.

1296
01:39:11,675 --> 01:39:14,053
How can you be so stupid?

1297
01:39:14,136 --> 01:39:15,304
Julie.
Mm.

1298
01:39:15,388 --> 01:39:18,225
What kind of life
you can have with me?

1299
01:39:18,308 --> 01:39:22,313
We'll travel to England.
You can heal all those mad cows.

1300
01:39:22,396 --> 01:39:26,610
We'll make a fortune.
No, I don't want to do it more.

1301
01:39:26,693 --> 01:39:29,697
I want to be with you.

1302
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:30,448
Always.

1303
01:39:30,531 --> 01:39:33,368
And me with you.

1304
01:39:35,246 --> 01:39:38,374
I'll wrap you up in my big coat.

1305
01:39:38,458 --> 01:39:40,043
Then no one can get at you.

1306
01:39:44,173 --> 01:39:46,551
You wanna drive?
Absolutely not.

1307
01:39:46,593 --> 01:39:48,554
 

1308
01:39:51,557 --> 01:39:52,642
What the hell

1309
01:39:52,725 --> 01:39:53,893
are you doing?!
 

1310
01:39:55,729 --> 01:39:58,190
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You have to stop this!

1311
01:40:00,944 --> 01:40:02,613
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1312
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:14,127
Get off!

1313
01:40:18,841 --> 01:40:20,384
 

1314
01:40:22,011 --> 01:40:23,764
Police!

1315
01:40:23,847 --> 01:40:25,182
Alexy!

1316
01:40:25,265 --> 01:40:27,101
Police. Stop!

1317
01:40:27,184 --> 01:40:28,728
Alexy!

1318
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:31,607
What's going on here, guys?
What do you think you're doing?

1319
01:40:31,648 --> 01:40:34,610
Where are you going, cowboy?
What are you doing?

1320
01:40:34,652 --> 01:40:36,571
Aren't you gonna take
the other guy?

1321
01:40:36,613 --> 01:40:39,116
He started it.
Stay out of this.

1322
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:41,661
Let's go. Come on, up you go.
Come on.

1323
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:44,247
I... I can't believe this.
Come on.

1324
01:40:44,331 --> 01:40:46,291
Easy, easy.
Don't fight, don't fight them.

1325
01:40:48,377 --> 01:40:50,797
Why did you run?

1326
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,009
Uniforms still scare me.
Stupid old fears.

1327
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,390
I think I'm pregnant with you.
Where's he from?

1328
01:40:58,473 --> 01:41:01,894
Fucking planet Russia.
Oh. No kidding.

1329
01:41:01,977 --> 01:41:03,437
A spy.

1330
01:41:03,521 --> 01:41:05,899
Or an asshole terrorist.

1331
01:41:05,982 --> 01:41:07,609
Why are you so rude to us?

1332
01:41:07,693 --> 01:41:10,279
I'm a Canadian citizen,
he's my guest.

1333
01:41:10,321 --> 01:41:11,197
Profession?

1334
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,615
Profession?
Oh...

1335
01:41:12,657 --> 01:41:14,993
uh, what you do. Job.
Oh, uh, magnetizer.

1336
01:41:15,077 --> 01:41:16,412
What the hell is that?

1337
01:41:16,495 --> 01:41:19,499
I... I cure people
with my hands.

1338
01:41:20,834 --> 01:41:22,336
No profession.

1339
01:41:22,419 --> 01:41:25,339
But you resisted arrest, Magneto.
It's an indictable offence.

1340
01:41:25,423 --> 01:41:29,136
You could be looking at deportation.
I can't fucking believe this.

1341
01:41:29,177 --> 01:41:32,765
I'm gonna call someone!
I'll call the fucking news! All right?

1342
01:41:32,849 --> 01:41:34,434
Are you listening to me?

1343
01:41:34,517 --> 01:41:36,478
He didn't fucking do anything!

1344
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:39,982
Where... where's the other guy?
I mean, this was just a fight!

1345
01:41:40,024 --> 01:41:42,694
For God's sake. Get-get-get-get
your fucking hands off me!

1346
01:41:42,777 --> 01:41:44,696
Hi, it's me again.

1347
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:48,743
Uh, God, you guys
are really busy, heh?

1348
01:41:48,827 --> 01:41:50,829
Well, I hope you're all good.

1349
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:55,293
Uh, I'm gonna try to make it
back before you get there, so...

1350
01:41:55,376 --> 01:41:59,715
Um, God, Henry, we should talk.

1351
01:41:59,798 --> 01:42:04,095
Well, I love you all. Bye.

1352
01:42:04,179 --> 01:42:06,515
Hello.
My God!

1353
01:42:06,557 --> 01:42:09,435
They let you out!
Yeah.

1354
01:42:09,519 --> 01:42:11,646
The guy didn't press charges!
No...

1355
01:42:11,730 --> 01:42:14,191
I guess he and the dog
made up.

1356
01:42:14,233 --> 01:42:17,403
I didn't know
you were such a good fighter.

1357
01:42:17,487 --> 01:42:20,949
Oh, ah, I had to defend myself
at the hospital!

1358
01:42:21,033 --> 01:42:22,576
You're very, very brave.

1359
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:25,580
You are the bravest.
You were fighting inside!

1360
01:42:25,622 --> 01:42:27,249
No.
Very good.

1361
01:42:27,332 --> 01:42:30,545
Those guys were assholes!
I swear, I'd fucking kill 'em!

1362
01:42:31,462 --> 01:42:33,381
 

1363
01:42:33,423 --> 01:42:37,762
This is... right here,
the healer is vulnerable.

1364
01:42:37,804 --> 01:42:39,389
No. No...

1365
01:42:39,472 --> 01:42:40,974
See, where those people
come up and touch your head,

1366
01:42:41,058 --> 01:42:41,850
all they have to do

1367
01:42:41,934 --> 01:42:43,435
is come up and tickle you.

1368
01:42:43,519 --> 01:42:46,439
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

1369
01:42:46,481 --> 01:42:49,318
With the twins,
I knew the next day.

1370
01:42:49,401 --> 01:42:50,820
Is it twins?

1371
01:42:50,903 --> 01:42:54,574
God, I hope... I hope not!
 

1372
01:42:54,658 --> 01:42:57,620
I want three.
I said three children, not four.

1373
01:42:57,703 --> 01:43:00,748
I said three. I want three.

1374
01:43:00,832 --> 01:43:02,959
Don't work any magic.

1375
01:43:03,043 --> 01:43:05,755
When I walk the streets
the people I meet

1376
01:43:05,796 --> 01:43:08,007
Say hello what's up
And then I say

1377
01:43:08,091 --> 01:43:11,345
My name is Alexy
I'm having a baby

1378
01:43:11,428 --> 01:43:14,307
And I am in love with you...

1379
01:43:14,348 --> 01:43:16,142
 

1380
01:43:37,085 --> 01:43:38,295
Nicole...

1381
01:43:38,336 --> 01:43:40,255
Nicole, what are you...
what are you doing here?

1382
01:43:40,339 --> 01:43:41,841
You don't have to be back
till Sunday.

1383
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,512
What happened?

1384
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,357
Then it started walking away.
Of course, Shasta followed it.

1385
01:43:55,441 --> 01:43:57,235
It led him right to the tombs

1386
01:43:57,318 --> 01:44:00,906
and out of the desert
onto the side of them.

1387
01:44:02,032 --> 01:44:03,492
Hey.

1388
01:44:03,534 --> 01:44:05,036
Mom...

1389
01:44:05,078 --> 01:44:06,830
Don't be mad at me.

1390
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:10,835
Don't be silly.

1391
01:44:10,918 --> 01:44:12,086
When?

1392
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:14,589
Yesterday.

1393
01:44:14,673 --> 01:44:17,051
He woke up
with a really high fever,

1394
01:44:17,134 --> 01:44:20,179
so we came in.
Had a lot of tests yesterday,

1395
01:44:20,263 --> 01:44:21,681
huh, buddy boy?

1396
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:24,977
It came back.

1397
01:44:25,519 --> 01:44:27,188
It came back.

1398
01:44:43,834 --> 01:44:46,879
Come on, open your shirt.
Okay.

1399
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,180
Hi, Alexy.

1400
01:44:54,263 --> 01:44:56,391
What's he doing here?

1401
01:44:58,268 --> 01:44:59,728
I'll explain later.

1402
01:45:44,325 --> 01:45:45,785
Where's he gone?

1403
01:45:53,419 --> 01:45:55,171
Do you want me
to leave the room?

1404
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:58,551
They're cold.

1405
01:46:00,595 --> 01:46:03,265
Would you try again? Please.

1406
01:46:03,348 --> 01:46:05,142
Please try again.

1407
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:08,187
I sorry.

1408
01:46:24,416 --> 01:46:25,250
Mom?

1409
01:46:26,084 --> 01:46:28,087
Yes, baby.

1410
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:30,757
I don't want
the chemo anymore.

1411
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:31,925
Okay?

1412
01:46:32,008 --> 01:46:35,054
We'll do whatever you want.
 

1413
01:46:35,137 --> 01:46:37,765
We'll go home,
we'll stay together.

1414
01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:40,310
Just don't be afraid.

1415
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:43,356
I'm not. Really.

1416
01:46:47,402 --> 01:46:49,905
And you don't be afraid either.
Okay?

1417
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,244
All right.
Okay.

1418
01:46:54,327 --> 01:46:56,956
Promise?
I promise.

1419
01:47:00,251 --> 01:47:01,461
His snoring is so funny,
isn't it?

1420
01:47:01,545 --> 01:47:04,173
Yes, it is.
 

1421
01:47:07,343 --> 01:47:09,721
Mom?
Will you sing me something?

1422
01:47:09,763 --> 01:47:12,850
Of course
I'll sing you something.

1423
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:20,777
I am a poor...

1424
01:47:20,818 --> 01:47:23,614
Wayfaring stranger

1425
01:47:23,655 --> 01:47:29,120
Travelling through...

1426
01:47:29,162 --> 01:47:32,958
This world of woe

1427
01:47:33,042 --> 01:47:38,465
There is no trouble

1428
01:47:38,549 --> 01:47:43,972
Toil nor danger

1429
01:47:44,055 --> 01:47:47,727
In that bright land

1430
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:52,107
To where I go

1431
01:47:52,149 --> 01:47:55,695
I'm going there

1432
01:47:55,778 --> 01:47:59,992
To see my mother

1433
01:48:00,075 --> 01:48:04,622
I'm going there
 

1434
01:48:04,664 --> 01:48:10,880
 
No more to roam

1435
01:48:10,963 --> 01:48:18,306
I'm just a-going over Jordan

1436
01:48:18,348 --> 01:48:23,687
I'm just a-going over home

1437
01:48:36,912 --> 01:48:38,372
How's the baby?

1438
01:48:39,582 --> 01:48:41,376
I can feel him kicking.

1439
01:48:43,921 --> 01:48:48,718
You guys want more?
Nope. We're full.

1440
01:48:48,802 --> 01:48:49,845
 

1441
01:48:55,685 --> 01:48:59,189
Do you feel all right?
Yeah...

1442
01:49:02,402 --> 01:49:03,987
War.

1443
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:10,203
Three.

1444
01:49:10,245 --> 01:49:11,538
Flip.

1445
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:12,915
Hey!

1446
01:49:12,956 --> 01:49:15,418
You cheated. We're not supposed

1447
01:49:15,459 --> 01:49:17,921
to use clubs.
Don't you remember? We made a deal.

1448
01:49:18,004 --> 01:49:20,048
We have to play clubs.
You're absolutely right,

1449
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:22,093
except it's Sunday.
So what?

1450
01:49:22,134 --> 01:49:25,722
The deal was we don't
play clubs on Sundays.

1451
01:49:25,806 --> 01:49:28,267
Those who demand clubs
will be severely punished.

1452
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:29,602
You're absolutely right.

1453
01:49:29,644 --> 01:49:31,020
But don't forget,

1454
01:49:31,104 --> 01:49:33,565
anybody named Nicholas
has the right to change the rules

1455
01:49:33,649 --> 01:49:35,943
everyfirst Sunday of the month.
But today

1456
01:49:35,985 --> 01:49:37,570
is the second Sunday.

1457
01:49:37,653 --> 01:49:40,407
Look out the window
and you'll see it's the first one.

1458
01:49:42,743 --> 01:49:49,960
If the bells tinkle 14 times
before a new bird sits on a branch,

1459
01:49:50,044 --> 01:49:50,961
you'll win.

1460
01:49:51,003 --> 01:49:52,964
One, two, three, four,

1461
01:49:53,006 --> 01:49:57,470
five, six, seven...

1462
01:49:57,553 --> 01:49:59,681
I see a big one...

1463
01:49:59,764 --> 01:50:01,933
Those feeders you put

1464
01:50:01,975 --> 01:50:03,811
on the trees are not working.

1465
01:50:03,852 --> 01:50:07,315
All the big birds keep chasing
all the little birds away.

1466
01:50:07,357 --> 01:50:11,028
Well, we're just gonna have
to do something about that.

1467
01:50:11,111 --> 01:50:11,904
Mm-hm.

1468
01:50:11,987 --> 01:50:13,322
Is that all? Is that all--

1469
01:50:13,364 --> 01:50:15,325
No, that's not all.
...that you've done today?

1470
01:50:15,367 --> 01:50:16,409
 
Show me.

1471
01:50:16,493 --> 01:50:17,953
No.
You haven't done anything.

1472
01:50:17,995 --> 01:50:19,288
what have you been doing here?

1473
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:22,917
Just been sitting in here
all morning...

1474
01:50:23,001 --> 01:50:25,838
daydreaming.

1475
01:50:25,921 --> 01:50:27,632
You smell nice.
