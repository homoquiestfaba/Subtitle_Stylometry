15
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:57,416
He was one of my bravest--
scars from 14 battles if a one.

gonna have to send him up to the fields.

taKing their stock down to the market...

and trekking back up again with supplies
and new stock for the months ahead.

never doing anything much
different from one day to the next.

34
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,689
He was alone on his journey...

00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:16,559
walking at his own gait,
slow and steady...

36
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,191

till you get to the bridge
by the inn.

47
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:40,875
That's north.

48
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:43,109
Will you help me?

49
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:47,382
Oh, no. Can't do that.

50
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:49,389
Against the law.

51
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:54,984
 
  Did you hit him?

52
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:59,294
  Surely did. Fattest turkey
ever seen the light of day!

53
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,179
  Had men tracking them
two days near Pride...

54
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,180
then they lost them.

55
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,978
Fellow says he saw the boy drinking in
the creek down from the bridge a piece.

56
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:18,985
Heading north, they'll be.

57
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:21,681

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,430
I see you made it
another year.

62
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:40,202
Sorry about your wife.
A sad loss.

63
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,641

66
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:53,479
How much you give me for it?
You sell it?

67
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:56,682
No. I'm there for life. Just
wonder what it's worth is all.

68
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:59,089
No river bottomland,
that right?

69
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,323
No. It's steep.
The rich ones won't buy steep.

70
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:06,093
You'd think since they can
afford slaves to work it--

71
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,727
Don't allow slaves,

72

00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:20,643

00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:23,684

77
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:27,220

Don't know.

Well, what does she smell like, Olaf?

That's not hers.
I told you.

181
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:04,726
Corn bread here's still warm.

182
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:07,933
Bread them dogs is eatin'
warm too.

183
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,580
 

184
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:30,027
You want to make camp with us?
A few more stretches and curves.

185
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:32,861
Need to ask your name
and where you're from.

186
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:37,131
I'm August King.
The one whose woman drew the pictures?

187
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,536
My sister said she was
the best artist in the country.

188
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:43,235
She could draw a picture faster
than a clown could fall over.

189
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,471
She'd draw me and--

190
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,209
Draw me walkin' down the path.

191
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:51,274
She used pages
right from the Bible.

192
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:53,376
Why, that's unholy.

193
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,819
Pages from the Bible unholy?

194
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,849
To draw on them.
She used the ones she didn't care for.

195
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:05,558
She kept Psalms. Used about half
the book of Exodus 'fore she died.

196
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:10,296
I always wanted her to do
Emily and Alice here... in colors.

197
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:15,506
Well, you can't travel
in the dark!

198
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,510
 

199
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,181
Did I offend him?

200
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,683
Reminded him of his wife
too often, I imagine.

201
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:28,482
Hope I don't die strange
as she did.

202
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:58,012
 

203
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:01,884
 

204
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,494
What you stop for?

205
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:22,367
Three reports
of seein' Sims.

206
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:26,537
Tomorrow we'll--
we'll catch him.

207
00:18:31,251 --> 00:18:34,652
Lord knows, we'll--
we'll find her too.

208
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:37,849
Why do you need to find her?

209
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:41,189
You have so many slaves.

210
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:47,661
She was like a ray of--
a ray of light to me.

211
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:51,669
It was a cool night.

212
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,541
When I woke...

213
00:18:57,411 --> 00:19:00,073
I was holdin' a pillow.

214
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:03,082
Her-- She was gone.

215
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,882
She's the one that's
supposed to...

216
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:10,980
tend the fire.

217
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,761
 

218
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:19,198
Why you do that?
 

219
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:23,726
Callin' her back,
she near enough to hear it.

220
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:27,501
World of rumors about...

221
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:31,135
Africans havin' more than...

222
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,270
five fingers and toes.

223
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:37,112
You ever hear that?
I heard it's so.

224
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:40,449
It's not my observation.

225
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,522
She near?

226
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,997
I'll be goin'.

227
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,050
 

228
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,601
 

229
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:32,502
 

230
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:53,014
 

231
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,935
What you want here?

232
00:21:07,574 --> 00:21:09,508
I give you this.
You help me.

233
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:12,170
What you been doin'
followin' me?

234
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:17,611
You see me yesterday
and don't tell nobody.

235
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:20,983
Where's the boy
you run off with?

236
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:23,648
We lost each other.

237
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:25,657
Won't come
outta those bushes?

238
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,590
See, it's a watch.

239
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,363
Silver. For you,
if you help me.

240
00:21:36,436 --> 00:21:39,234
Belongs to Olaf Singletary.

241
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:43,008
He give it me.

242
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:46,812
Stolen property.

243
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:51,183
He give it me.

244
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:57,689
 

245
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:05,289
I try all day not to die.

246
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,027
I ate leaves this mornin'.

247
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:10,296
They went through me
like a fire.

248
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,553
No one ever teach you
how to chew?

249
00:22:30,357 --> 00:22:33,918
No one teach me
how to starve.

250
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,396
Your fat owner's camped
back thataway. I can show you.

251
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:43,197
You had enough freedom now.
What's he doin'?

252
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,366
Take you back in a carriage, I expect.
Seems so anxious to have you.

253
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,431
What's he doin'?
I asked you.

254
00:22:51,378 --> 00:22:54,142
Well, he's beatin' on a pan.

255
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,109
There ain't nothin' funny
about him.

256
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:08,292
Finish that.
I'll get you some milk.

257
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:10,659
Then you go on your way.

258
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:17,001
 

259
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:37,621
 
  Hey.

260
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,293
Hey.

261
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:48,867
 
Hey.

262
00:23:49,936 --> 00:23:54,873
 

263
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:15,620
 

264
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:20,165
Damn!

265
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:23,361
I don't allow men
any chance with me.

266
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:26,234
I just wakin' you up...
and get rid of you.

267
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:31,904
Man need a rope
to get near you.

268
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:36,108
Come on. Move on outta here...

269
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:38,810
'fore someone finds you.

270
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:42,387
 
Come on.

271
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,058
 

272
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,675
It's my watch
to give anyways.

273
00:25:12,652 --> 00:25:15,086
You sleep in that cart
till mornin'.

274
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:19,523
Then you're gone.

275
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:47,785
 

276
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,725
 

277
00:26:18,585 --> 00:26:20,985
 

278
00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:22,988
 

279
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,423
 

280
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,333
Here I am, lonely, my son's
trailin' slow with my cattle...

281
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:44,399
and I come upon a friend
from my own community.

282
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,935
Been wantin' coffee all mornin'
and not had ary a drop.

283
00:26:55,054 --> 00:26:57,784
Mmm. Oh, my, how glad
I am to meet you.

284
00:26:57,857 --> 00:27:00,655
How are you, August?
Tell me.

285
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:03,389
Wantin' to be on my way.
That's how I am.

286
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:08,127
And you livin' alone too. It's not
recommended for a man to live alone.

287
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:11,637
Well, I'll have a solution
for that one of these days now.

288
00:27:11,704 --> 00:27:15,367
What do you do by yourself
to distract your thoughts?

289
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:18,239
I read the Bible.
 

290
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:20,711
 
Here they are.

291
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,214
I'll be goin' now, Fisher.

292
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:29,611
August? You had
a woman here last night.

293
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:34,858
You had a woman here
last night. I allow!

294
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:38,386
Farmer and his wife is all.
Yeah, they were by.

295
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,934
Small feet. Injured feet.

296
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:47,199
Woman tracks.

297
00:27:47,273 --> 00:27:50,868
Had female company, August did!
 

298
00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:54,607
And you always so proper,
August.

299
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:56,842
Ah, she's probably nigh.

300
00:27:56,916 --> 00:28:00,977
Might be in them bushes, peeing.
 

301
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,079
[Cattle Bawling,
Cart Rattling]

302
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:08,025
Hey, August! You left
your coffee pot!

303
00:28:08,094 --> 00:28:11,188
 
Move on, move on. Come on, there!

304
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:22,236
 

305
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:25,004
 
Get along. Get around!

306
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,912
  Hello, mister!
Look at the piggie under the cart.

307
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:32,918
  Slow down, damn it!
You're gonna hit the sheep!

308
00:28:34,354 --> 00:28:36,982
Get out! Go on, sheep!

309
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:41,550
 

310
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:44,153
 
That man's gone crazy!

311
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,721
Come on! Come on,
stay outta there.

312
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,667
Louise, get back up there
and head 'em off.

313
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,674
 

314
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,948
I'm not one for big adventures. I don't
need excitement first thing a mornin'.

315
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:08,818
What they do to you if you help me?
I'm not gonna find out.

316
00:29:11,524 --> 00:29:13,458
I never made the laws.

317
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:15,494
I'm simply a one-man farmer.

318
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,527
He gone and burned my shoes
after I runs away first time.

319
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,501
Don't bite me.

320
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:36,548
 

321
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:45,020
 
 

322
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:47,025
It's gonna heal 'em.

323
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:49,061
 

324
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,064
Lay your hands.

325
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,702
Drink that down.

326
00:29:58,137 --> 00:30:00,469
 

327
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:06,209
Ever had peach brandy?

328
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:10,648
There ain't no peaches in that.

329
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:14,676
 

330
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,135
I can be so small that nobody
ever gonna see me in your cart.

331
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:46,409
Stop scratchin'.

332
00:30:46,486 --> 00:30:49,512
But it itches, and when
I itch I can't stop.

333
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,622
Well, a woman's thighs
start a man thinkin'.

334
00:30:55,528 --> 00:30:57,519
How old are you, anyway?

335
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:59,531
Seventeen.

336
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:05,298
 
Do you have any modesty?

337
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:07,566
Don't you be talkin'
to me like that.

338
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,406
Well, don't you scratch
so much.

339
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,708
Anyone finds you, I'm gonna say
I'm takin' you in.

340
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:32,654
 

341
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:37,993
 
Come on, boy. Come on.

342
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:43,030
What is it, Rusty?
 

343
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:49,446
 
 

344
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:04,095
If you won't tell.

345
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:12,397
It's no need, mister.

346
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,134
But you better not let
Mama and Papa see her.

347
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:21,312
She ain't hungry, is she?

348
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:24,616
I think she'd like that.

349
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:37,026
I ate my apple.

350
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:39,030
They're lookin' for her
everywhere.

351
00:32:39,098 --> 00:32:42,556
Daniel! Henry!
What you doin'back there?

352
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:44,933
Come on, Rusty. Come on.
We're waitin'on you!

353
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,303
 

354
00:32:48,374 --> 00:32:50,569
Sorry, Papa.
We saw bear tracks.

355
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:53,942
A real big one!
What you doin' talkin' to that man?

356
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:07,551
 

357
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:15,631
 
Hey!

358
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:18,226
Them boys tell?

359
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:20,704
I don't believe so.

360
00:33:20,773 --> 00:33:23,435
I didn't want you
gettin' in trouble.

361
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:26,069
Why you went?
Yeah.

362
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,876
 
Never told me your name.

363
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:37,381
Williamsburg.
He called me after a town.

364
00:33:37,456 --> 00:33:39,754
Oh, my Lord.

365
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:42,794
You're not supposed
to be called William...

366
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:44,796
much less"Burg."

367
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,525
Whoa.

368
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:54,539
I is called Annalees
by most everybody. Or Anna.

369
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:58,566
You like Annalees?
It's an improvement.

370
00:34:00,713 --> 00:34:03,375
  Come on, Crosby!
Best get in.

371
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:08,419
 

372
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,624
Get down.
Lie down.

373
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:40,048
More rain comin', looks like.
Right.

374
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:49,820
 
So how are you, August?

375
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:53,695
Just common. You all right?
I'll do.

376
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:57,634
  Take him out!
He can't breathe air.

377
00:34:57,703 --> 00:34:59,694
 
Yes, he can. He's gettin'too hot.

378
00:34:59,772 --> 00:35:04,368
Any slave owners come by?
One a while back.

379
00:35:04,443 --> 00:35:07,503
That fat fella?
They all fat.

380
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,175
Yeah. All right.
  I got slime all over my dress!

381
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:17,155
Say, August, that sure is a pretty cow
you bought at the market!

382
00:35:17,223 --> 00:35:21,455
Isn't she? Promisin' my wife
for years to buy a new one.

383
00:35:22,895 --> 00:35:26,831
 

384
00:35:32,638 --> 00:35:35,038
 
Keep down.

385
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:38,838
I am keepin' down.
Could be anyone lookin' on.

386
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:44,214
Them mountains,
they cut my feet wide open.

387
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:47,081
You cut them open,
blood flows out too.

388
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:50,554
Life's as bad as these
mountains are.

389
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:53,023
The blood is the water,
you-all tellin' me?

390
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:56,391
Every mountain has a life of its own.
 

391
00:35:56,462 --> 00:36:00,922
Sarah used to say,
"If it's alive, how do you kill it?"

392
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,525
Who's Sarah?

393
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:06,435
My wife.

394
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:08,564
And I'd say,
"Well, you can't kill it."

395
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:12,099
And she'd say,"lf you can't kill it,
how much alive is it?"

396
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:14,874
That's what she'd say.
 

397
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:18,246
Hey. Whoa.
Hold it.

398
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:20,808
What's the matter?

399
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:22,854
 
You're all tangled up.

400
00:36:22,922 --> 00:36:24,856
 

401
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:31,888
She waitin' for you at home?
Your wife?

402
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:36,596
Sarah passed away.
How she die?

403
00:36:36,669 --> 00:36:39,536
It's bad to ask.

404
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:42,904
She lost her footin'...
on a ridge above our house.

405
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:44,966
They got loose stones there.

406
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,737
God must've caught her, August.

407
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:52,283
He caught her in his hand.

408
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:56,821
 
 

409
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:02,260

That's my Aunt Louise
with my mama.

00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:40,457
 
Maybe they think I'm dead.

427
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:54,906
Better wait a goodly
while till they get on.

428
00:38:54,974 --> 00:38:57,807
Which one of you called out
to him, huh?

429
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,971
You's gonna honk me
right in his lap.

430
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:03,947
Win me that horse of his.

431
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:10,620
You thinkin' of it?

432
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:29,068
Must want you bad,
offerin' land.

433
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,144
I was his house servant.

434
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,180
That different
from a field hand?

435
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:41,047
Means I wait on him
night and day.

436
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:44,612
He want his tea.

437
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,988
He want his toast buttered.

438
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,527
He want his fire made.

439
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,189
He want his garden hoed.

440
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:56,633
He want quiet in his house.
He want his shirt washed.

441
00:39:59,672 --> 00:40:03,073
He's strong as an ox too.

442
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:11,338
Had a roof over your head.
Why you run away?

443
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,517
Keep him from takin' my soul.

444
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:24,528
 

445
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:30,692
You know this cow makes milk
out of fallen leaves? It's a miracle.

446
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,703
Queen of cows.

447
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,374
And you is August King.

448
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,044
Yeah.

449
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:45,978
 

450
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:50,456

452
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:03,824
I never knew a man
named after a month before.

453
00:41:03,902 --> 00:41:07,702
You get women named June.

454
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:10,105
April.

455
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:12,939
May. I knew two Mays.
May?

456
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,946
Uh-huh.

457
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:21,449
July. July King.

458
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,954
August.

459
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:28,119
l'se called November.
My name is November King.

460
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:31,424
November King.
What the hell you talkin' about?

461
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:34,591
 
October King!

462
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:37,829
 
August King!

463
00:41:37,903 --> 00:41:40,963
 
  The devil's back on us!

464
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,532
 
There he goes! He ran into the house!

465
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:53,350
Get around the side!
Plug them holes!

466
00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:00,247
Did you see him? Did he run through?
Who you talkin'about?

467
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:05,353
The runaway, damn it! Must still
be inside. Boys, let them dogs go.

468
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:07,524
Sure you seen him?
Well, I seen somethin' move!

469
00:42:09,635 --> 00:42:11,569
Whoa.

470
00:42:18,677 --> 00:42:21,703
They didn't find Sims,
did they?

471
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,714
Shadow's all they saw.

472
00:42:26,552 --> 00:42:28,850
They shootin' at him.

473
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,356
Shadows.

474
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:35,459
They shoot at me?

475
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:37,461
Can't shoot
what they can't find.

476
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:43,098
I know what they do to me,
all those men.

477
00:42:43,168 --> 00:42:47,969
I tell you, I jump from off
a cliff'fore they catch me.

478
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:04,745
 

479
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:29,313
Ah, there you are.
Must've ridden past you earlier on.

480
00:43:29,381 --> 00:43:32,373
I'm told you caught your girl.
Not yet.

481
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:34,385
Know where she is, do you?

482
00:43:34,453 --> 00:43:36,478
Back thataway,
I imagine.

483
00:43:39,091 --> 00:43:42,151
Lanky farmer named Fisher.
First man at my camp this morning.

484
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:45,958
Fellow who looks into every pot. He
told me you camped near me last night.

485
00:43:46,031 --> 00:43:48,693
Don't you remember my leavin'
your fire after dark?

486
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:50,701
I don't recall.

487
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:58,875
Yesterday,
two hunters trailed her.

488
00:43:58,944 --> 00:44:01,606
Said she left a trail
as easy to follow as a bear's.

489
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,118
When dark came, they were not more
than a hundred yards from my camp.

490
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:11,722
She's tryin' to find you,
it looks like.

491
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,691
She must've come near yours.

492
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,694
You think she came
to steal somethin'?

493
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:18,696
She's not a thief.

494
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:28,872
I would have sworn!

495
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:32,843
That farmer--
whatever his name was--

496
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:35,675
he said there were footprints.

497
00:44:37,516 --> 00:44:39,450
What does a slave eat, anyway?

498
00:44:39,518 --> 00:44:41,452
Milk?

499
00:44:43,956 --> 00:44:46,356
What do you think she eats?

500
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:48,723
She eats anything!

501
00:44:48,794 --> 00:44:51,319
What does that matter?
I want to find her!

502
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:55,389
And she was near here!
Near me, near you-- last night!

503
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:57,992
Just wonderin' what she might
want to steal from me, that's all.

504
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,004
She's not a thief!

505
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,131
Don't shout at me, Olaf.

506
00:45:12,017 --> 00:45:14,212
 

507
00:45:14,286 --> 00:45:17,312
I did expect to find her.

508
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:21,086
I was certain it was you.
I told people up ahead it was you.

509
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:24,595
Though I never used your name,
whatever it is.
What'd you say?

510
00:45:24,663 --> 00:45:28,258
She's with a man with a full-blood
cow tied by a rope to his cart.

511
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:31,097
I don't much like you
usin' me, Olaf.

512
00:45:33,572 --> 00:45:35,506
 

513
00:45:44,716 --> 00:45:46,650
 

514
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,445
 

515
00:45:51,523 --> 00:45:53,548
Most everybody's
gonna stop you now.

516
00:45:57,863 --> 00:46:01,060
I can disappear
when I get that scared.

517
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,014
Wait till I get back.

518
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,517
 

519
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,385

520
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:38,657
§  

521
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,840
Where's your mama live?

522
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:55,245
Why, in his house.

523
00:47:56,314 --> 00:47:58,248
You his daughter?

524
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:01,285
How's that?

525
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:05,153
You Olaf's daughter?

526
00:48:11,229 --> 00:48:13,322
Uh-huh.

527
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:21,202
I hope you don't
go judgin' me for it.

528
00:48:24,709 --> 00:48:28,076
I never broke
with the law before.

529
00:48:28,146 --> 00:48:32,207
All mornin'
I been askin' myself...

530
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,752
"What you doin' this for?"

531
00:48:36,254 --> 00:48:38,552
I imagine there's a reason.

532
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,228
I think so.

533
00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:52,797
You're on your way home,
are you, August?

534
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:55,738
Been thinkin' so,

Home.

715
01:05:43,013 --> 01:05:44,947
Home.

716
01:05:57,661 --> 01:05:59,595
Oh!

717
01:05:59,663 --> 01:06:03,121
 

718
01:06:06,303 --> 01:06:10,137
 

719
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:28,825
 

720
01:06:30,694 --> 01:06:32,685
I made those buildings.

721
01:06:32,763 --> 01:06:36,722
Fitted them together myself.

722
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,031
Took better part
of four years.

723
01:06:41,105 --> 01:06:43,573
 

724
01:06:43,641 --> 01:06:45,575
Come on.

725
01:06:48,746 --> 01:06:51,681
 

726
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,328
 

727
01:07:26,817 --> 01:07:28,751
 

728
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:40,797
I have some balm
for those bites and scratches.

729
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:49,505
 

730
01:07:54,078 --> 01:07:57,013
I can't get to them.
Will you do me?

731
01:08:04,922 --> 01:08:08,688
Hey, you ain't supposed
to use that finger. It's bad luck.

732
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:47,125
There's a dry shirt
in the other room.

733
01:09:44,788 --> 01:09:49,851
I was wrong to put this on, huh?
It was special to both of you.

734
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:55,023
No, it's not that.

735
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:05,974
Would never be safe
for you to stay here.

736
01:10:08,545 --> 01:10:10,672
I know.

737
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:14,206
I has to find my own life
in the north.

738
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:20,980
Shoes, you'll need.

739
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:33,834
I can't wear them.
You have to on the trail.

740
01:10:33,904 --> 01:10:35,838
Uh-uh, not with her
ghost shoes.

741
01:10:35,906 --> 01:10:38,397
You need shoes.
Not them.

742
01:10:38,475 --> 01:10:40,670
How are you gonna get to the
north if you don't have shoes?

743
01:10:40,744 --> 01:10:42,712
You said that they the shoes
that she die in.

744
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,079
You said she slip on these stones--
That she fall all the way down.

745
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:48,084
No!

746
01:10:50,154 --> 01:10:53,089
She wasn't wearing these shoes
when she died.

747
01:11:00,197 --> 01:11:04,133
I found them on the rock ledge
where she laid them neatly.

748
01:11:05,536 --> 01:11:09,939
She was always
of a practical mind, Sarah was.

749
01:11:10,007 --> 01:11:14,137
Strong shoes.
Valuable to someone.

750
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:18,377
She was grievin' the baby.

751
01:11:21,051 --> 01:11:23,253
Just wouldn't
believe it was dead.

752
01:11:23,253 --> 01:11:23,981
Just wouldn't
believe it was dead.

753
01:11:25,589 --> 01:11:27,523
Our baby.

754
01:11:28,692 --> 01:11:32,458
She held it in her arms
for three days.

755
01:11:34,798 --> 01:11:36,732
I had to take it.

756
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:42,032
Dug a hole up on the hill.

757
01:11:42,105 --> 01:11:44,300
Laid her in it.

758
01:11:44,374 --> 01:11:46,308
She was so tiny.

759
01:11:47,578 --> 01:11:49,512
Tiny.

760
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,618
I couldn't
throw the dirt on her.

761
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:01,014
So Sarah did.

762
01:12:01,091 --> 01:12:03,457
She was so--

763
01:12:06,463 --> 01:12:11,025
And her eyes
were never the same.

764
01:12:15,172 --> 01:12:17,106
And she never forgave me.

765
01:12:19,576 --> 01:12:23,012
She never forgave herself.

766
01:12:26,817 --> 01:12:29,342
I wish I could've saved her.

767
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:35,124
Save me.

768
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,244
Are you ready?

769
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,779
Trail's been used for years.
It's marked.

770
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:42,216
People show you kindness
on the way.

771
01:14:42,285 --> 01:14:44,310
You'll likely get tired...

772
01:14:44,388 --> 01:14:46,322
but don't stop, Annalees.

773
01:14:49,226 --> 01:14:51,626
Just remember
all the progress you made.

774
01:14:56,266 --> 01:14:58,200
So you be off now.

775
01:14:59,736 --> 01:15:01,897
Always stay above the crest.

776
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,537
Don't bite anyone.

777
01:15:24,795 --> 01:15:26,820
All right.

778
01:15:27,998 --> 01:15:29,932
August King.

779
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,480
You'll find it.

780
01:17:11,601 --> 01:17:14,092
 

781
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:25,714
Well, they found your cart.

782
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,184
Found my cart?

783
01:17:29,252 --> 01:17:32,653
It's near Hobbs Community,
near Olaf Singletary's holding.

784
01:17:32,722 --> 01:17:34,656
Someone stole it, did they?

785
01:17:34,724 --> 01:17:37,454
I left it by the creek
with my horse.

786
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:41,224
Nein, no horse.
There's no horse at all.

787
01:17:41,298 --> 01:17:43,289
Well, where's my horse?

788
01:17:43,366 --> 01:17:47,564
Look at me, August.
Are you daft?

789
01:17:47,637 --> 01:17:51,198
The cart-- The cart is not
empty of its supplies, is it?

790
01:17:51,274 --> 01:17:53,834
Why, there's nothing in it.

791
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:55,844
And the geese?

792
01:17:57,847 --> 01:17:59,781
What of my geese?

793
01:18:01,384 --> 01:18:03,818
 
It's gone.

794
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:13,395
lda, you want
to be here for certain?

795
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:21,234
I hear you've
taken several road losses.

796
01:18:21,304 --> 01:18:24,899
I'm left in dire shape,
if the truth be known.

797
01:18:26,276 --> 01:18:29,211
A calamity
can come on any man.

798
01:18:32,949 --> 01:18:35,281
An odd spirit takes over.

799
01:18:36,453 --> 01:18:40,082
You can touch a person
with your bare hand...

800
01:18:40,156 --> 01:18:42,283
and his spirit
can come into you.

801
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:45,954
I've heard that said.

802
01:18:46,029 --> 01:18:48,998
Olaf Singletary came
to see me earlier this morning...

803
01:18:49,065 --> 01:18:51,693
determined to find
this girl of his.

804
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:55,636
But I suppose he hasn't come yet.
I've not seen him here.

805
01:18:55,705 --> 01:18:59,573
And she's not here.
No.

806
01:18:59,643 --> 01:19:02,111
Well, there.

807
01:19:02,178 --> 01:19:04,578
Just as I told him.

808
01:19:15,191 --> 01:19:18,957
And you don't know where she is,
do you, August?

809
01:19:19,029 --> 01:19:20,963
I don't know.

810
01:19:23,033 --> 01:19:26,002
There, you see.

811
01:19:27,237 --> 01:19:30,764
And you've not seen her
anywhere along the way?

812
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,367
Yes, I have seen her.

813
01:19:34,444 --> 01:19:38,175
You saw her, but you didn't help her.
It's against the law to help her.

814
01:19:38,248 --> 01:19:40,182
I know it is.

815
01:19:50,293 --> 01:19:52,818
I suppose you think...

816
01:19:52,896 --> 01:19:56,593
I'm not involved.

817
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:58,600
But I am...

818
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:03,070
because people--
even this morning--

819
01:20:03,139 --> 01:20:05,573
have come through my gate...

820
01:20:05,642 --> 01:20:08,668
and said laws have been broken...

821
01:20:08,745 --> 01:20:12,442
property rights violated.

822
01:20:15,318 --> 01:20:18,253
A spell came over me,
Mr. Wright.

823
01:20:19,823 --> 01:20:23,759
I did a hundred things strange,
nothin' customary.

824
01:20:26,062 --> 01:20:27,996
You explain it to me.

825
01:20:29,733 --> 01:20:32,065
 

826
01:20:33,937 --> 01:20:37,805
 
Well, what say we prepare a defense?

827
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:39,865
Is there to be a trial?

828
01:20:39,943 --> 01:20:43,242
Of a type.

829
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,271
I suppose many a person...

830
01:20:46,349 --> 01:20:50,410
might steal a good cow,
and once word went out...

831
01:20:50,487 --> 01:20:52,887
the thief might
have slaughtered it.

832
01:20:54,257 --> 01:20:59,160
As for the boar, you were
caught in the river's current.

833
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:02,130
And then this girl
ran out of the bushes...

834
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:04,462
and you did what
any decent body would do.

835
01:21:04,534 --> 01:21:08,095
You agreed to take her
to Olaf Singletary.

836
01:21:08,171 --> 01:21:10,605
The geese?

837
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:14,176
Forget the geese.

838
01:21:16,112 --> 01:21:19,081
They flew away up on the ridge.

839
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:21,709
I saw them myself, flying away.

840
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:28,080
No one will burn this man's
house because of geese.

841
01:21:30,894 --> 01:21:33,727
Burn my house?

842
01:21:37,867 --> 01:21:40,768
 
  You men stay here.

843
01:21:57,253 --> 01:21:59,448
This is no place for women.

844
01:21:59,522 --> 01:22:02,719
She's known her own mind
since a girl.

845
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:08,964
 

846
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:16,104
You have her?

847
01:22:16,172 --> 01:22:18,800
He saw her for a few minutes
last night...

848
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:22,242
and then she ran off
on the way to your house.

849
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,507
I won't accept that.

850
01:22:24,581 --> 01:22:26,515
I will accept her.
That's all!

851
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:30,075
She's not here, Olaf,
as I told you.

852
01:22:32,789 --> 01:22:34,723
Where is she?

853
01:22:34,791 --> 01:22:37,555
Now, there's no need for this.

854
01:22:37,627 --> 01:22:40,790
We have talked to this poor man
a long while...

855
01:22:40,864 --> 01:22:43,856
and I assure you,
she is not here.

856
01:22:43,933 --> 01:22:45,867
And as you told me...

857
01:22:45,935 --> 01:22:48,961
you yourself examined his cart,
and so did I.

858
01:22:56,412 --> 01:22:58,346
Please.

859
01:22:58,414 --> 01:23:00,348
Where is Anna?

860
01:23:03,286 --> 01:23:06,380
He can't tell you that.

861
01:23:12,562 --> 01:23:14,826
 

862
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:21,966
Wh-- Where did you see her?

863
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:25,874
At a creek.

864
01:23:28,478 --> 01:23:31,970
I first saw her
three mornings ago near the gap.

865
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,012
Then she came to my camp...

866
01:23:37,086 --> 01:23:39,554
and I felt sorry for her.

867
01:23:44,127 --> 01:23:47,290
Since my wife died,
I've been lost...

868
01:23:47,363 --> 01:23:50,298
and I was needin' help
as much as anybody.

869
01:23:53,169 --> 01:23:55,603
I gave her some bread, milk...

870
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,175
and I brought her
along the road.

871
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:09,783
He can't be trusted
to tell the truth.

872
01:24:09,852 --> 01:24:13,117
He's not accountable, Olaf.

873
01:24:14,357 --> 01:24:16,257
 
No!

874
01:24:16,326 --> 01:24:20,319
It's all right.
It's all right.

875
01:24:35,645 --> 01:24:38,079
I'll not deny what I did.

876
01:24:40,717 --> 01:24:43,652
I don't want to be...

877
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,120
only what I was.

878
01:25:03,272 --> 01:25:05,206
 

879
01:25:13,216 --> 01:25:15,150
 

880
01:25:16,352 --> 01:25:20,584
I'll burn him out.
It's the law.

881
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:23,353
Well, burn him out,
if it pleases you.

882
01:25:23,426 --> 01:25:27,624
It seems not to matter to him,
so why ought it matter to me?

883
01:25:27,697 --> 01:25:29,824
I wash my hands of him.

884
01:25:29,899 --> 01:25:33,130
He's got the prophet's look
about him.

885
01:25:34,871 --> 01:25:38,136
He cares not a whit
for property.

886
01:26:10,573 --> 01:26:13,508
He never mentioned the barn,
August.

887
01:26:19,449 --> 01:26:23,385
If you want any dresses, Mina,
you better go get 'em.

888
01:26:28,991 --> 01:26:31,926
We can at least try
and stop them, August.

889
01:26:31,994 --> 01:26:35,760
Olaf made his deal:
House for the girl.

890
01:27:35,024 --> 01:27:37,254
I was right well-to-do.

891
01:27:38,394 --> 01:27:41,830
All in a day or two,
I've lost everything.

892
01:27:45,034 --> 01:27:48,299
