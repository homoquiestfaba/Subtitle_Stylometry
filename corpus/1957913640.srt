0
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,266
There lies
a sleepy little village,

1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,900
with the biggest
Christmas spirit.

2
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,333
Look for it on a map,

3
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:19,066
and you won't be able
to find it.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,333
It is said

5
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:23,800
that only those in need
of the village's particular joy,

6
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:25,100
can find their way

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,767
to its quiet, welcoming streets.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,667
"And once
these special visitors arrive

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,000
in this magical little place,

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,300
they experience
a holiday season like no other,

11
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:38,433
and are reminded
of who they really are

12
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,767
and the true joy and peace

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,233
that is the meaning
of Christmas."

14
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,467
Did you really read this book
when you were my age?

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,100
Only about a thousand times,

16
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,000
and now,

17
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,600
it belongs to you.

18
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:52,066
An early Christmas Eve present.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,266
Because you,
my sweet darling girl,

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,967
are a very special person

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,066
with a very special gift,

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,133
and you know
what that means, right?

23
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:03,133
I will grow up
and do very special things?

24
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,467
That's right.

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,734
As long as you follow
your heart and your dreams,

26
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,133
you cannot fail.

27
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:10,800
But all of Talia's dreams

28
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:12,867
are filled with pirates
and fairies, sir.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,467
Hey, my dreams are fun!

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,834
Look who it is.

31
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,500
Well, happy holidays, Anderson.

32
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,500
Thanks.

33
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:19,633
I wanted to ask

34
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,176
if Talia could come out
and play with me.

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,920
But my dad just got home
from his work trip.

36
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,233
He's reading me my new book.

37
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,300
You should stay and listen.

38
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,713
Actually,
your timing is perfect.

39
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,500
I was just about to whip up
some hot chocolate for us.

40
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,166
Talia, why don't you build
a cozy fort

41
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,500
and you can read it to Anderson?

42
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:36,800
"The village is ruled

43
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:38,867
by a beautiful fairy queen

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,166
and her handsome king,

45
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,734
but everything you want
was there,

46
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:43,400
you just had to ask."

47
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,093
I bet I could find Wunderbrook
on a map.

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,967
All I'd need is my compass.

49
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,633
No way, it's impossible.

50
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,567
It says so
right on the first page.

51
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,233
You have to have
"forgotten who you are

52
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:54,200
and forgotten how to dream".

53
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,333
Whatever that means.

54
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,567
Besides, the evil witch
would chase you

55
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,800
and force you out of town,

56
00:01:58,934 --> 00:01:59,967
and then the princess

57
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,486
would give you
a kiss on the cheek

58
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,734
and grant
all your secret wishes.

59
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:05,467
Secret wishes and kisses?

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,400
I don't remember
that part of the story.

61
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:09,967
Because
I'm making up my own parts.

62
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,900
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

63
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,133
You're welcome.

64
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,076
Talia is going to be a writer
when she grows up,

65
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,867
because she's always daydreaming

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and making things up.

67
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,567
Yeah, I'm going to be famous,

68
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,367
and everyone
will read my stories.

69
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
I know you are.

70
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,900
So, what are you going to be

71
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,433
when you grow up, Anderson?

72
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,400
Our teacher says
I should be a doctor.

73
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:31,033
I think that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

74
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,934
Are you okay, Daddy?

75
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,600
Are you still tired
from your medicine?

76
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,633
A little,
but nothing to worry about.

77
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,367
I'm heading upstairs now.

78
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,633
Don't get into any trouble
down here.

79
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:41,600
Okay, love you.

80
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:43,100
I love you, too.

81
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:46,066
What's that flyer say?

82
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,100
"Good for one free week
at the Gingerbread Inn,

83
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,633
offer will not expire,

84
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,367
transportation provided.

85
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Where is it?

86
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
It says "Close by,"

87
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:56,066
but close by to what?

88
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,633
I guess it's a mystery,

89
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:58,800
just like Wunderbrook.

90
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:06,934
I bet nothing bad
ever happens there.

91
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,133
Do you really have to move away?

93
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,166
Yeah, my mom's
renting out the house.

94
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,142
She wants to be closer to
my aunt and uncle for a while.

95
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,200
She says this house
is too much for one person

96
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,800
since my dad died.

97
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:27,767
I got you something.

98
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,533
It's so you can
keep writing down

99
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:35,166
all your stories.

100
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,967
Thank you, Anderson.

101
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,133
I love it.

102
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:41,133
Maybe you can send me some
in the mail?

103
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:44,433
When you're feeling better.

104
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,867
I have something for you, too.

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,367
I wanted you to have
your own copy,

106
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,467
so you wouldn't forget about me.

107
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,300
Did you hear that?

108
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:57,433
Hear what?

109
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,100
I thought I heard...

110
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,066
Never mind.

111
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,867
I'm going to miss you.

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,734
Me too.

113
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,667
As time continues to pass,

114
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,400
dreams are often in danger
of making way for reality,

115
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,834
but where there is passion
there is hope...

116
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:29,867
For one dreamer at least.

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,867
Hey!

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,066
- Hi!
- Tal!

119
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm so excited to see you!

120
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,700
Looks like your
creative juices are flowing.

121
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:41,033
Oh, no, not exactly.

122
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,066
Just some
exhilarating inventory.

123
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,266
Well, the store looks fantastic.

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,867
Thanks so much
for hosting my event,

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,100
and so close to Christmas.

126
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,233
Are you kidding?

127
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:54,834
We have a literary sensation
in our midst.

128
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,066
Come look.

129
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,667
I have a surprise for you.

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,934
You ready?

131
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,400
Ta-dah!

132
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,900
Oh!

133
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,133
"Sensation" might be
a bit of a stretch,

134
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,333
but I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

135
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:12,233
I don't suppose your publisher
gave you any feedback

136
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:14,000
on my manuscript?

137
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,266
They just got back to me.

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
They said it was cute,

139
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:20,166
but they don't think
your stories

140
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,467
are a fit for their brand.

141
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
They prefer edgier material.

142
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:25,934
Right.

143
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,300
Okay.

144
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:28,509
Well, thank you for trying.

145
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,600
Yeah.

146
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:31,066
Look.

147
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,467
Someone's in your reading chair.

148
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,320
That's where Miss Talia
reads us her stories

149
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,467
about Mr. Snowflake.

150
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,467
Sloane,
this is my neighbor, Ryan.

151
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,433
And your biggest fan, I see.

152
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:42,567
Today, Sloane is going
to read part of her book.

153
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,500
She's a real
professional writer.

154
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:46,767
Talia wondered

155
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,500
if she would ever
find her voice,

156
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,633
or those who would
appreciate her gifts,

157
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,300
while unaware
a friend from the past

158
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:58,800
was searching
for answers of his own.

159
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,367
Chief, hey, it's, uh,
it's Anderson.

160
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,967
You gotta get somebody
to cover my next procedure.

161
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,133
No, I'll be okay,

162
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:29,667
I just need a couple of days
to clear my head

163
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,700
and get some rest.

164
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,033
I'll keep you posted.

165
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,900
I'll be back soon, I promise.

166
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:40,000
Thanks, Chief.

167
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,867
Doubting oneself
does not make for a happy heart,

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,066
especially when
that inner conflict spreads

169
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,033
to the loving bond
between two souls.

170
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,886
I got some gifts
for the nieces and nephews,

171
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:53,176
I just need to find something
for your parents.

172
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,900
Any thoughts?

173
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:56,033
Keith?

174
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,400
You don't need my two cents.

175
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sure
whatever you pick is fine.

176
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,133
Okay.

177
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,242
Did you remember
to call the plumber?

178
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:04,233
The leak is getting worse.

179
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,567
I'll do it myself.

180
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Where have I heard that before?

181
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,266
As Diane contemplated

182
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,033
if this was her last Christmas
with Keith,

183
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,700
another soul was desperately
holding onto something

184
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,300
that was already gone.

185
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,200
Bea, honey, I'm home.

186
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,734
How was your day?

187
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:40,033
I went grocery shopping.

188
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,633
I picked up some of
that almond milk you like.

189
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:44,934
So fancy.

190
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,934
Remember when it was just
half and half?

191
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:54,066
Oh, I ran into your friends
from the book club.

192
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,266
They sure miss
having you around.

193
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,367
Little did
these struggling souls know

194
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
the forces that would
bring them all together

195
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:19,633
were already in motion.

196
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,467
Why bother,

197
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,776
you already know
what they're going to say.

198
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
"Thank you for your interest,

199
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,767
but we are unable to proceed
with your material

200
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,633
at this time."

201
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,934
like it's really no joke.

202
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,066
Did you say something?

203
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:53,600
Oh, sorry, no,
I'm just talking to myself.

204
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,867
Have we met?

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,100
Sorry, never mind.

206
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,767
You know, I do that a lot
because I read quite often

207
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,943
and so between
all the characters

208
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,033
I envision in my head,

209
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,209
and all the people
that come through this door,

210
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,667
there's just
a lot going on, right?

211
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,233
I also talk a lot.

212
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,100
Talia?

213
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:09,033
Is that you?

214
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,333
From Rockford Elementary?

215
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,934
- Anderson?
- Yeah.

216
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,367
- What?!
- Yeah!

217
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,367
- Hi!
- Hi!

218
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,867
Wow!

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
How long has it been?

220
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,176
Not since you and your mom
moved away, right?

221
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,276
When did you come back
to Seattle?

222
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,734
I moved back
into my family's house

223
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,667
after I got my Master's
in writing.

224
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,667
Cool.

225
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,567
I wish I'd known,

226
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,710
I would have invited you out
for coffee or something.

227
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,810
Oh, you know, and I actually
kept meaning to look you up,

228
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:40,900
but I didn't think
you'd remember me after so long.

229
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:42,700
Of course, I remember you.

230
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,533
So, which section is yours?

231
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,100
Do you use a nom de plume?

232
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,867
More like a nom de calculator.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,900
This is actually my store.

234
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,734
- Oh.
- Yeah, which, you know,

235
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:56,000
requires a surprising amount
of math,

236
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:59,900
and sadly, not as many
clever turns of phrase.

237
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,333
Ah, well, that's too bad.

238
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,776
I always liked
reading your stuff.

239
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,710
Not that running your own store
isn't also fantastic.

240
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:05,776
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It is, no,

241
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,333
I just,
yours was the only fiction

242
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:08,467
I ever really got into.

243
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,266
Oh, that's nice.

244
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,867
Well, um, I still dabble,
of course, right?

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,867
In fact, publishers
are considering my work

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,033
as we speak.

247
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:16,867
Cool.

248
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,867
What about you?

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,834
What about you, what do you do?

250
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:20,767
I am a surgeon.

251
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,734
- Oh!
- At Seattle Medical.

252
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,033
But I'm taking
a bit of a vacation.

253
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,734
Oh, hence the need
for reading material?

254
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:28,867
Yes.

255
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:30,443
Okay, so, what are you
in the mood for?

256
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:32,867
Can I offer you
a nice juicy mystery, or...

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,509
Maybe something
a little more uplifting

258
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,567
would be a better distraction?

259
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,266
Just what the doctor ordered?

260
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,934
- Something like that.
- Okay.

261
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,767
So, what you have planned
for the holidays?

262
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,266
My mom's away this year,

263
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,200
but I have other plans.

264
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,367
Loads of plans.

265
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,533
Lots.

266
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,734
Great, well,

267
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,734
we should do that catch-up
after the holidays.

268
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:51,934
I would love that.

269
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:52,867
Yeah.

270
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,667
Um, here,
put in your contact info.

271
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,767
Ah, still ordering me around
like old times, huh?

272
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,834
Some things never change.

273
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:02,967
All right.

274
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,934
Thank you. Here you go.

275
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:06,666
I think you'll like this one,
it's on me.

276
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,100
Well, thanks.

277
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:13,100
Text me, and we'll get
that catch-up on the books.

278
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,266
Yeah. Sounds good.

279
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,133
- All right.
- Okay.

280
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,667
- See ya.
- Bye.

281
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
"I still dabble?"

282
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:24,800
Good grief, Talia,
you're so lame.

283
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,133
Hey, Mom, guess who I saw today.

284
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:28,333
Anderson!

285
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:29,667
Yeah, from back in the day.

286
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,300
Do you remember him?

287
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,767
Oh.

288
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,000
Single?

289
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:37,000
I have no idea,
we didn't get into all that.

290
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:42,133
I know, I wish we could
spend Christmas together, too.

291
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:45,633
Yes, for sure, absolutely.

292
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:46,567
Okay.

293
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,767
I love you, too.

294
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,066
Bye.

295
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Oh.

296
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,300
Hello?

297
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,367
Hi, Robyn?
It's Talia!

298
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,300
Um...

299
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:23,667
I know it's been a while,

300
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
but I was just wondering

301
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:26,633
what you were up to
for the holidays?

302
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,533
Oh, dear.
I'm afraid this isn't Robyn.

303
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:29,667
This is Judy,

304
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:33,367
and you've reached
the Gingerbread Inn.

305
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,867
I'm sorry, the Gingerbread what?

306
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
The Gingerbread Inn, dear.

307
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,133
I'm assuming you called

308
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,800
about the special
getaway promotion?

309
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:41,667
Deluxe private room,

310
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,133
three home-cooked meals a day,

311
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,700
access to all
festival activities.

312
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:48,133
That... Wow, that sounds lovely,

313
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,900
but I was actually just trying
to call my friend.

314
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,166
Well...

315
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,867
maybe it's fate.

316
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,467
Those who need it most
tend to find their way to us,

317
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,667
and you're in luck.

318
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,467
We only have two openings left
for this season.

319
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,734
Do let us know soon
if you change your mind.

320
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,266
Okay, great, thank you,

321
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,934
uh, but I will say, um,

322
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:10,433
I probably will just stay put
and celebrate with my friends,

323
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,266
but I do appreciate the offer.

324
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,200
Very kind.

325
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,066
Okay.

326
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,934
Thank you.

327
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,867
Bye.

328
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,934
Hmm.

329
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,400
Hey, Jenny, it's Talia!

330
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:35,967
Yeah, hey, I was just wondering
what you were up to this week?

331
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,567
Oh, that's right, yes,

332
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,367
I forgot you were
with Rick's family.

333
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,367
Okay.

334
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,400
All right, well, have fun.

335
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:49,066
Bye.

336
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:01,333
Hi, we spoke
earlier this evening.

337
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,776
Yeah, you know,
I've been thinking,

338
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,333
and I changed my mind.

339
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:12,467
I'd be thrilled
to accept your offer.

340
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:40,066
Where in the world am I?

341
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Wunderbrook?

342
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:59,367
Be right there!

343
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
Welcome to the Gingerbread Inn.

344
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,600
I'm Judy, and I'll be your host.

345
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,033
Is everything okay?

346
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,934
I don't know.

347
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:10,533
I'm having major deja vu.

348
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,333
You know, this place
looks a lot like the...

349
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,166
Never mind, never mind.

350
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,042
It's just my imagination
working on overdrive again.

351
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:17,934
Ignore me.

352
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,367
Okay, I'm clearly exhausted.

353
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,443
I was, like, nodding off
in the car ride over here.

354
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,567
Thank you for arranging that,
by the way.

355
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,433
We are delighted to have you.

356
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:25,600
Please...

357
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,900
accept your welcome basket.

358
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:30,567
Oh!

359
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,767
I asked you three times
to pack an extra charger.

360
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,276
Why didn't you email me
the task list?

361
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,033
Talia, meet Diane and Keith,

362
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,000
two of our other guests.

363
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,667
Oh, and this is Charles.

364
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,500
My husband, Miles, is bringing
you some spare clothes.

365
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,533
They're not exactly
fashionable, but...

366
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, I appreciate the generosity.

367
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,293
I didn't expect to be staying,

368
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,900
so I just brought
my fishing gear.

369
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,166
Oh!

370
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,600
Jake, what's the matter?

371
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,166
A car was detoured our direction

372
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
on the way up the coast,

373
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:56,509
and the driver says
it's running funny.

374
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:57,767
I told him to come on over.

375
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,767
He's grabbing his suitcase.

376
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,767
Anderson?

377
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,100
Seriously?

378
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,166
Yeah, I think? Hi.

379
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,400
Hi.

380
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,533
You know each other?

381
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,967
Uh, yeah,

382
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,276
but we haven't seen each other
for like almost 30 years.

383
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,767
Yeah,

384
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,300
and now it's twice
in the same week.

385
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,767
He's stalking me, it's fine.

386
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Sounds like kismet to me.

387
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:24,166
Really?

388
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,740
Well, I'll go see
if I can figure out

389
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,943
what's going on with that detour

390
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:28,087
and take a look at your car.

391
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,233
I'm sort of the
Jake-of-all-trades around here.

392
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:31,367
- Get it?
- Yeah.

393
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,266
Well, that would be great.

394
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,009
I'm sure I'll figure it out
by the morning.

395
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,600
Well, gotta get going,
lots to do.

396
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:41,066
Oh, and in the meantime,
I've got an extra room for you.

397
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,934
I've got some lovely desserts
in this other room.

398
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,233
I'm just going to turn in.

399
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,433
I should probably
get some work done.

400
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:51,433
- I'll be upstairs, okay?
- Okay.

401
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:52,609
I don't want to get in his way,

402
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:53,767
but I'm not very hungry,

403
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,233
so I'm just going to go read.

404
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,166
And then there were two.

405
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,333
This way to the dining room.

406
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:06,867
Delicious hot cocoa for you?

407
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,467
- Oh.
- Yeah, thank you.

408
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,567
Well, I'm hoping to figure out
what's wrong with the car.

409
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,309
I'm aiming to get out of here
as soon as I can.

410
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,333
I'm sure he will.

411
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,567
Excuse me.

412
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,533
So, I thought you were
stay-cationing in Seattle

413
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,367
with loads of plans.

414
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,967
Oh, yeah, uh,

415
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,700
I may have embellished that
a little bit.

416
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,533
Ah.

417
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,834
Okay, you have to admit

418
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,333
that it's a wild coincidence

419
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,066
that we're both here, right?

420
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,033
Okay.

421
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,500
It was synergy.

422
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:35,800
Ah, I thought the word
was "kismet".

423
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:37,800
Only five visitors this year.

424
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,294
Not a ton,
but we can make it work.

425
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:40,400
Maybe.

426
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,293
Assuming they have
a successful stay with us.

427
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,733
I can't wait
to meet the new people.

428
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,166
I have so many questions.

429
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,076
I told you, Izzy,
you're not to bother the guests.

430
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,567
I won't, Mom, I promise.

431
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,900
I don't know
why you're all so excited.

432
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:52,066
Interlopers,

433
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
that's what they are.

434
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,700
I wish they'd all just
stay away and leave us be.

435
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:57,900
Oh, Mildred,

436
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,643
I know it's hard for you
to forget the past.

437
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:03,266
Maybe this season
we can change how you feel.

438
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,767
Now, we only have
until the conclusion

439
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,633
on the Night of Wunder,

440
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,800
on the 23rd, same as every year,

441
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:10,400
to get everyone sorted.

442
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,567
We all have our roles to play

443
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,867
and not much time to do it.

444
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,734
So...

445
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:19,934
let's get to it.

446
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,967
Ho! Ho! Ho!

447
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,066
And so, Mildred
reluctantly pondered her role

448
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,433
in the fate
of this year's guests.

449
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:35,567
What obstacles
could she lay in their paths?

450
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,476
Apparently,
the road to the cabin

451
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,109
is going to be closed
longer than they thought,

452
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,967
and my car is still
out of commission.

453
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,367
- Please.
- Thank you.

454
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,867
Yeah.

455
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,266
So, I'm going to try
and book a Ride-share

456
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
so I can take off.

457
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:57,000
You sure you want to leave
so soon?

458
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:00,367
There's something
in the air here.

459
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Keith, the plumber said

460
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,734
he could start
on the repairs today.

461
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:05,266
Our house flooded,

462
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,767
which is why we had
to clear out last minute.

463
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,220
Then I found a flyer
for this inn.

464
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,433
It was in the mailbox
without a stamp.

465
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,433
It was the oddest thing.

466
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,266
What about you, Charles?

467
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,233
How did you find your way here?

468
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:17,500
Oh.

469
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,867
Boredom.

470
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,834
I've fished every fishing spot
there is to fish in Idaho.

471
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,600
You came all this way to fish?

472
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,500
And to think.

473
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,633
Yeah.

474
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:31,066
I got a little lost
on the way...

475
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,066
found my way here somehow,

476
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,333
Judy offered me a room.

477
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:36,100
I figured I'd better stay put
before I really got lost.

478
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:40,000
How about you, Talia?

479
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:41,333
Well, I called the wrong number

480
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:44,600
and Anderson got re-routed
on a detour, so...

481
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:47,433
It's kind of like a force
drew us all here

482
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:48,567
or something, right?

483
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:50,533
You haven't changed a bit.

484
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:53,367
That overactive imagination
still working double-time.

485
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,667
Hi! I'm Izzy.

486
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,533
Judy and Miles are my parents.

487
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,867
Can I show you all around

488
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,309
before you get started
with your day?

489
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,567
My mom said it's okay.

490
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,400
Oh, our very own tour guide!

491
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:06,934
I'll pass.

492
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:10,667
I'm not in the mood for a tour.

493
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,166
- Sounds good to me.
- Yeah.

494
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,166
Keith?

495
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:20,500
I should finish my brief.

496
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,776
There's so many places
you can visit.

497
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,400
There's
Mildred's Miracle Tavern.

498
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,266
It's the nicest
restaurant around.

499
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,200
Even though Mildred isn't always
the nicest person around.

500
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:33,200
Don't tell her I said that!

501
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,066
I swear, it's the oddest thing.

502
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,066
I just know
I've been here before.

503
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,266
Impossible.

504
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,240
I've never seen you,
and I never forget a face.

505
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,733
My mom says
it's like a super power.

506
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,934
Oh, well, that's impressive.

507
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,734
Okay, but continue, Izzy,
this is so exciting!

508
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,100
And it'll get even better.

509
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,367
The tree lighting is tonight.

510
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,976
The official start
of our Wunder Week.

511
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,233
"Wunder Week"?

512
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,166
Okay, I know
I've heard that before.

513
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,066
Me too.

514
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,266
Maybe a client...

515
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,643
What do you and Keith
do for work?

516
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,567
Oh, we're both lawyers.

517
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,967
I just made partner at my firm,

518
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,567
and Keith is a public defender.

519
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,567
What about you, Anderson?

520
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
What do you do?

521
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:07,847
I just became an attending,

522
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,834
so I supervise
my own group of residents.

523
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,333
Surrounded
by doctors and lawyers.

524
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:15,734
Suddenly,
I feel deeply inadequate.

525
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,800
Aw, when you're a big,
hot-shot author,

526
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:19,066
you'll forget all about us.

527
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,600
Aw, you sound like my dad.

528
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:22,467
He passed away when we were ten.

529
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,967
He was just
my biggest cheerleader.

530
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:33,100
I miss him every day.

531
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,467
Hello there.

532
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,467
You interested
in something to go?

533
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Got anything on tap?

534
00:21:57,467 --> 00:22:02,567
Can I see a food menu?

535
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,700
No substitutions, no exceptions.

536
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't worry,

537
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:11,233
the only thing I'm allergic to
is excessive pleasantries,

538
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:15,500
and I don't think that's going
to be an issue here.

539
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:18,200
Goulash is my specialty.

540
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:22,133
I'll have
a specialty goulash then.

541
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:30,266
To stay.

542
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:37,700
Can I ask you something?

543
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,800
This whole village

544
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:43,033
looks like a Christmas elf
exploded on it,

545
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,300
but here, not so much.

546
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:47,033
I used to go all out.

547
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,200
For years,
this was the place to beat

548
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,700
for best storefront
on Main Street.

549
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,200
And then?

550
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,734
I'm over it, as the kids say.

551
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:57,800
You and me both.

552
00:22:57,934 --> 00:22:59,734
I wish it was January already.

553
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:02,533
Oh, Charles!

554
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,600
This is where
you've been hiding.

555
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:07,533
Not hiding.

556
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,200
I just prefer to avoid
the holiday hoopla.

557
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,333
Oh.

558
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,734
I can recommend the goulash.

559
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:15,233
No substitutions.

560
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:16,487
Sounds perfect.
Three orders?

561
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:19,433
Sure.

562
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,400
So, did you have a good day?

563
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,400
I did.

564
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:25,133
I had a pleasant enough
conversation with Mildred.

565
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:27,567
She's... interesting.

566
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,900
This place is nice.

567
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:29,900
Yeah.

568
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,200
Hey!

569
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,543
Now, that is the kind of service
you do not get in the city.

570
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:36,033
It's a little too good.

571
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,567
Keith would send it back.

572
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,660
He'd be suspicious
it'd been sitting out too long.

573
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,233
How'd you kids meet?

574
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:44,533
Oh, we were on rival quiz teams.

575
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,567
I beat him during the round

576
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,734
on the billboard charts
of the '90s.

577
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,967
So how'd you go from rivalry
to romance?

578
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,133
He said since I bested him
in front of his friends,

579
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,600
the least I could do
was join him for dinner.

580
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,767
After that, we were inseparable.

581
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,967
Ah, young love at its finest.

582
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,200
It's all so fleeting.

583
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,667
Okay, we better get this in.

584
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,200
It's the opening night
of Wunder Week.

585
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,333
Uh, hello?

586
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,667
Can you guys hear me out there?

587
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,000
Welcome, residents and guests.

588
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:25,033
I'm Mayor Miles,

589
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,300
and starting tonight,

590
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,600
we kick off our Wunder Week.

591
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:31,943
Inspiration
for your next project?

592
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,166
Oh, no,

593
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,100
I can't even think about
another project right now.

594
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:37,266
I'm tapped...

595
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,367
and honestly,

596
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,200
the writing thing...
isn't really happening for me.

597
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,367
Well, that's a shame.

598
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,467
I liked getting your stories
in the mail.

599
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,767
I was sad
when you stopped sending them.

600
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,600
You don't have to say that.

601
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,100
Anyway, that was a lifetime ago.

602
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:03,667
We should buy some souvenirs
when the market opens.

603
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,000
I don't know if this is a season

604
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:07,367
we want to remember.

605
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,367
Let's light it up!

606
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
What do you say, folks?

607
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:10,533
Okay!

608
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:17,400
Three, two, one!

609
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,433
This village would look
even more picturesque

610
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,333
if it were snowing,

611
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:36,834
don't you think?

612
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,900
What did I tell ya?

613
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:53,500
In Wunderbrook
a little magic goes a long way,

614
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,233
but there's so much to do,

615
00:25:55,367 --> 00:26:03,333
and such little time.

616
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:08,934
Chapter three.

617
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:10,910
Only five days until
the Night of Wunder deadline,

618
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:12,800
and no one is making
significant progress.

619
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:14,100
Personally, I'll be glad

620
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:16,266
when the tourists
stop infesting our home.

621
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,633
Every year, we give and give

622
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:20,142
and are left
with nothing in return.

623
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:20,967
I'm sick of it.

624
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
That's not true.

625
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,867
We're left
knowing we helped someone

626
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,209
overcome a challenge
in their life

627
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,333
and move forward.

628
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:27,776
The problem isn't just
receding tourism.

629
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,033
If we fail,

630
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:37,033
visitors won't have the ability
to find their way to us anymore.

631
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,500
Oh, this looks good.

632
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,876
Ready for
the ultimate taste test?

633
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,209
Oh, so glad
you guys could make it.

634
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,276
We have to guess
the different flavors

635
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,100
in the hot chocolate.

636
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:45,600
Oh, fun!

637
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,000
When we were first together,

638
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:49,367
Keith and I used to try
new restaurants once a week,

639
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,166
and guess the ingredients
and the spices in their dishes.

640
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,533
Blindfolds at the ready.

641
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,433
- Okay.
- It's time to get tasting!

642
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,200
All right. Thank you.

643
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,700
- You first.
- Me first.

644
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,066
Definitely smells like coconut.

645
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,667
Gold sprinkles?

646
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,166
I was just about to eat this.

647
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,200
Ah!

648
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:18,667
Hey, you guys are cheating,
I saw that.

649
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,667
Weird. Your sister said
she sent our gifts here,

650
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,233
but the courier couldn't find
the address.

651
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,166
Maybe the village
is unincorporated.

652
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,500
Off-grid.

653
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:35,700
That's odd.

654
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:37,109
We already
tried that one, Keith.

655
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:38,000
Yep, I know.

656
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:38,934
Just wanted a second taste,

657
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:39,900
if that's all right with you?

658
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,500
Okay, come on, Keith.

659
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:44,166
Let's go, drink it up!
Time's a-ticking.

660
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,500
Okay, tastebuds
on the prize, right?

661
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:49,100
Right, so you'll listen to her.

662
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,273
Yeah, because she doesn't
treat me like an employee.

663
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:56,934
Um...

664
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:00,667
I'm going to go back to the inn.

665
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,900
Thank you.

666
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,576
You're doing better
than I thought, Dr. A.

667
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Thanks.

668
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,133
You can just
call me Anderson, Izzy,

669
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:14,000
and yeah,
maybe I can add hot cocoa

670
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:16,567
to the short list of things
that I can make.

671
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,109
Maybe you can make one
for your girlfriend.

672
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:19,000
Wait...

673
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,400
Do you have a girlfriend?

674
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,667
No, I am married to my work.

675
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,100
What about you, Talia?

676
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:25,509
You got a boyfriend
back in Seattle?

677
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:28,233
No, no, the only relationships
I've been in recently

678
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:30,300
are from the romance section
in my bookstore.

679
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:32,633
So you're both single!

680
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:33,767
Um...

681
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:41,800
well...

682
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,567
Thanks.

683
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,934
So, what kind of
"wunder" ful joy

684
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,900
did everybody get up to today?

685
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,467
You'd know if you joined in.

686
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,767
The festival
is a community event

687
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,667
and right now you're
part of that community.

688
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,567
I used to love the holidays.

689
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
But it's just...

690
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:06,400
it's not the same

691
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:08,333
going through the motions
without my Bea.

692
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,133
Is that your wife?

693
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:13,567
My high-school sweetheart.

694
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,667
We were married 42 years.

695
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,033
She did the bookkeeping
at my shop.

696
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,734
She was a whiz with numbers.

697
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:23,133
Couldn't style her hair
to save her life.

698
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:25,066
Sounds like
you made quite the duo.

699
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,066
We did.

700
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,567
She passed

701
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,867
three years ago.

702
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,867
Cancer.

703
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,867
I'm sorry, Charles.

704
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,500
I'd give anything
to see my Bea again.

705
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,233
Just for 10 minutes,

706
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:44,667
even if all we did was bicker.

707
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,033
She brought so much color
to my life.

708
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:55,166
You still deserve
to experience joy, Charles.

709
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,700
Did you know that Charles
is a widower?

710
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:07,667
Sorry?

711
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,667
I just overheard him
telling Judy.

712
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,133
He misses her so much,

713
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:14,233
and here I am,
constantly at odds with Keith.

714
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:15,467
I just...

715
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,367
I feel so horrible.

716
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,000
Do you want to come in
for a minute?

717
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:21,500
Yeah.

718
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:23,467
I'm a pretty good talker,

719
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,400
but I think I might be
a better listener.

720
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:31,233
Have a seat.

721
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:34,800
So, what's really going on
with you and Keith?

722
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,233
Besides a flooded house.

723
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:40,300
He never listens to me.

724
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:43,867
He just tunes me out,
like I don't even exist.

725
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,834
I'm sorry, Diane.

726
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:48,367
Maybe it's normal
in a long-term relationship?

727
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,133
I don't know.

728
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:54,900
I filed for divorce.

729
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,633
Oh.

730
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,400
I haven't served him
the papers yet.

731
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:00,233
I wanted to wait
until after the holidays,

732
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,633
and I thought maybe this trip

733
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:04,300
would be our last chance
to reconnect,

734
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:07,266
but he's...

735
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,266
You know, enough about me.

736
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,533
How about you and Anderson?

737
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,433
I've been sensing a vibe
between you two.

738
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:13,567
No, no, no.

739
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,967
We're just old friends.

740
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,467
Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?

741
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,433
- Oh, no.
- We were just chatting.

742
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,133
- Yeah.
- Were your ears burning?

743
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:22,300
Should they be?

744
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:23,867
No, they shouldn't be.

745
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,100
We were just...

746
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:28,400
wondering
where everyone was.

747
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:29,367
And here you are!

748
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,066
I mean, not just you,

749
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,600
like, everyone, all the people.

750
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:34,200
Well, I am here,

751
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,100
and everybody else
is going downstairs.

752
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:38,473
Miles invited us for story hour.

753
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,200
That sounds like fun.

754
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,033
Yeah.

755
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,166
- Shall we?
- We shall.

756
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,266
Okay. Let's go.

757
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,100
Oh, this looks like story hour
at my bookstore.

758
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:49,600
What's a story hour?

759
00:31:49,734 --> 00:31:51,800
There are kids
in my neighborhood

760
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:54,233
whose parents
struggle to find childcare.

761
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,266
So they come,
and they read books,

762
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,100
and they hang out.

763
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:00,934
I tell them
some of my own stories, too.

764
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:03,467
Well, I used to anyway.

765
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,476
I would have loved
something like that as a kid.

766
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,700
However, um, this event
isn't quite the same.

767
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:10,834
Our tradition

768
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:14,266
is to create
an original holiday story

769
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,266
every year.

770
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,433
How does it work?

771
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,700
We all take turns.

772
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,967
Whoever has the microphone
is the storyteller.

773
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,166
Izzy, why don't you kick us off?

774
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,266
Okay.

775
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,100
There once was a lonely snowman,

776
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:31,033
who wanted to meet
a special snowlady

777
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,367
and fall in love.

778
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,767
Ooh...

779
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,300
Uh, so, he joined an app...

780
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,166
called the Icy Connection...

781
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:50,934
Uh... hoping to find a match.

782
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:53,133
And...

783
00:32:53,266 --> 00:32:55,533
all anybody ever wanted from him

784
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:56,967
was advice on how not to melt.

785
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,800
Hey, no, this is...

786
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:02,066
This is
from real-life experience

787
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,500
from the five minutes
that I spent on a dating app.

788
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:06,667
Here, take it for a spin.

789
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Uh, no, no...

790
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:09,142
- No, no, no, no
- Here you go. Your turn.

791
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:09,934
Hey, aren't you the pro?

792
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:12,100
Fine, okay.

793
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:13,567
Um...

794
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,000
but when the snowman
looked in the mirror,

795
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:19,200
he wondered, sadly,

796
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,734
why he could never frolic
in the sun,

797
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:25,567
and so began
his existential quest

798
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,667
to understand
his elemental nature,

799
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,400
for how could he ever partner

800
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:31,767
with another snowy creature,

801
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,433
knowing that a terrible,
puddly fate

802
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:36,700
awaited them both?

803
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:37,900
Oh...

804
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:39,500
Then what happened?

805
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,343
Well, he moved
to the North Pole, of course,

806
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:45,500
where he would be safe
to find love all year round!

807
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:46,767
Oh!

808
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
Brilliant!

809
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,767
Okay, here.

810
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,500
Okay, that is
a tough act to follow.

811
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,066
I know, right?
Show-off.

812
00:33:57,867 --> 00:34:01,233
No, but, really,
you have a gift.

813
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:09,367
Maybe it's time to pick up
that pen again?

814
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:12,934
Oh, hey, Mildred,

815
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,767
I just stepped out
to get some air.

816
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,133
Are you joining us or...

817
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:20,400
Jake asked me
to bring you these.

818
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:22,066
Looks like the roads
are open now.

819
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,900
Your car seems to be running
just fine.

820
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,567
You're free to leave
and be on your way,

821
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,266
bright and early tomorrow.

822
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,567
Thanks.

823
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,000
Something the matter?

824
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,600
Nice stunt with the keys.

825
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:41,734
Classic, Mildred.

826
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:42,867
Stunt?

827
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:46,800
I was just returning a man
his property.

828
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,567
Mildred, you have to let
things unfold

829
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,700
the way they are meant to

830
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,767
until we've helped them
sort their lives.

831
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,000
I am just playing my role,
and you know it.

832
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:59,567
Besides,
the magic is almost done.

833
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:07,700
Tick tock, tick tock.

834
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:12,066
Will Mildred's meddling ways

835
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:19,834
obstruct
the townspeople's quest?

836
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:27,967
Chapter four.

837
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,333
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

838
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,533
You got your keys back.

839
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:40,433
Yeah, yeah, looks like
the detour is cleared up,

840
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:41,767
and my car is okay.

841
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,767
So, you're heading out?

842
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,433
Actually,

843
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:46,867
I don't know.

844
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,633
I was putting some stuff
in my trunk,

845
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:52,500
and I suddenly had
this overwhelming feeling

846
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:54,800
that I needed to stay.

847
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,033
It's hard to explain,

848
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,200
but I hope you're okay

849
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,476
sharing a bit more
of your vacation with me.

850
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,800
I can live with that.

851
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:01,100
All right.

852
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:02,233
What's up?

853
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,567
Oh, I found this
by my door earlier.

854
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,400
You didn't leave it there,
did you?

855
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:07,533
No.

856
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,042
No, I can't
claim credit for that one.

857
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,266
That's strange.

858
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,934
Anyway, I love it

859
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:14,209
and I've been writing
all morning.

860
00:36:14,233 --> 00:36:15,233
What about?

861
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,767
Well, I'm noodling
on a holiday story

862
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
about this village,

863
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:21,100
and its precocious
resident tween.

864
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:22,600
Ah, so Izzy is your muse.

865
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:24,533
Well, I'm available to be
your first reader,

866
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,400
whenever you're ready to share.

867
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:27,653
I might take you up on that.

868
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,433
All right.

869
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:29,867
Let me guess,

870
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,900
you're responsible
for that notebook's appearance?

871
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:35,266
If only I could wave my wand

872
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,166
and have them all
face their inner demons.

873
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,900
You know we can only provide

874
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:41,066
a positive,
uplifting experience.

875
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,667
Our guests have to figure out
their issues on their own.

876
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,100
You've practically been
all over the world.

877
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:50,200
I have, everywhere
but the North Pole.

878
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,500
Oh, I'm so envious.

879
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:55,033
You know,
I get to travel, too, you know,

880
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:56,400
yeah, when I read.

881
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,600
Well, put some of them
on your bucket list.

882
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:02,333
You know, I don't actually
believe in those.

883
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:06,633
My dad had this whole endless
list of places he wanted to see,

884
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,900
and he barely made a dent in it.

885
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:11,266
It just broke my heart,

886
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,934
but feel free to regale me
in more of your adventures.

887
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,100
So, where to next?

888
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,834
I'm not sure I'm going
to do it again this year.

889
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:20,834
Why?

890
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,567
You have
too many responsibilities

891
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
as an attending?

892
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
Not exactly.

893
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:27,967
Uh...

894
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:34,066
anything you want
to get off your chest?

895
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,900
I hate kale.

896
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:39,300
There, I said it.

897
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:45,500
Okay.

898
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:46,667
Excuse me, Charles?

899
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,000
Jake?

900
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,967
I'm supposed to play Santa,

901
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,409
but I have to set up
the grounds for later.

902
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:55,242
Would you be willing to step in
and play Santa for me?

903
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:57,800
Ah, I don't think so.

904
00:37:57,934 --> 00:37:59,100
Get him to do it.

905
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:01,033
Anderson?

906
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:04,467
He doesn't have the gravitas
or the wisdom for it.

907
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,233
I don't know
what we're talking about,

908
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,233
but I think I'm insulted?

909
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:08,500
Since I have you,

910
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:10,309
would you two be willing
to play Santa's elves?

911
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,667
Uh... hold on,
are there costumes?

912
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Yes!

913
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,834
See, Charles?

914
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:17,300
Everyone wants in.

915
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,400
Please, I'm begging you.

916
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:22,300
There's no one else,
and the kids are waiting.

917
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:30,433
I'll give you an hour.

918
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:41,166
Merry Christmas.

919
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,133
Here to make your wish?

920
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:52,200
I'm...
here to fix Santa's beard.

921
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,066
Who's in charge here?

922
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,734
Where's Jake?

923
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:56,667
What's wrong with my beard?

924
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,500
If you're going to do something,

925
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:02,066
you can't do it halfway.

926
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,900
You sound a lot like my Bea.

927
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:06,367
She was an all or nothing girl.

928
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,800
She sounds like a wise woman.

929
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:14,867
You were lucky to have her.

930
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,066
I should, um...

931
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:25,867
get back to the tavern.

932
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,100
Okay, who's next?

933
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,700
Climb aboard, Izzy.

934
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,033
You know, Anderson,

935
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:33,533
if things don't work out for you
at the hospital,

936
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,967
I see a future for you
in elfin arts.

937
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,100
Haha.

938
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,120
Tell Santa your wish, kiddo.

939
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,200
Mr. Santa,

940
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,800
this year, I'd like to wish
for a bicycle,

941
00:39:42,934 --> 00:39:44,567
a dollhouse,
a sewing machine, a...

942
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,900
Whoa!

943
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,367
Slow down, young lady.

944
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,633
Mr. Santa,

945
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:49,934
most of all,

946
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:51,767
I want to see
my new friend, Charles,

947
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,233
smile again.

948
00:39:56,367 --> 00:40:00,266
That's a very generous wish.

949
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,633
Well,

950
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,133
that was shockingly exhausting.

951
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:08,133
Yeah,

952
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:09,266
and actually,

953
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,080
I was kind of hoping
to sit on Santa's lap,

954
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,033
but the kids
had dibs on his time.

955
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:15,533
Childhood has its perks.

956
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,600
What would you have wished for?

957
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:18,800
Oh, well,

958
00:40:18,934 --> 00:40:21,467
there's a first edition
of Jane Austen's Emma

959
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,967
that I've been coveting.

960
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,433
What about you,

961
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:25,934
a new stethoscope or something?

962
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:27,209
No, no, I've got
plenty of those.

963
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,133
Actually, I like...
I like your idea.

964
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:30,033
I think I'm plagiarizing you.

965
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,700
Yeah?

966
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,209
I've been meaning to read
more Jane Austen.

967
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:34,467
Oh!

968
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Oh, ho!

969
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,433
Hey there.

970
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,509
You burst in here like
you're running from someone.

971
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:48,533
No, no, I'm just...

972
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:50,934
I'm avoiding a conversation
with Diane,

973
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:52,100
to be completely honest.

974
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,266
Oh.

975
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,600
We need to sit down
and have a real conversation,

976
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:58,934
but I just freeze up
every time I see her.

977
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:00,433
Hmm.

978
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:01,567
Tell me more.

979
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,967
I forgot to call the plumber,

980
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,166
which is just a tiny thing,

981
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,667
but it's another example
of me just freezing up.

982
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,000
She treats me like an employee,
not a partner.

983
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:14,433
Reminds me of me and Judy.

984
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:18,934
I'm always letting something
fall through the cracks.

985
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:21,867
Is it really about the plumber, though?

986
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Who knows?

987
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,000
Ever since Diane made partner,

988
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:28,200
she's been so stressed
with work.

989
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:31,100
I just want to go back
to when things were simpler.

990
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:32,967
When was the last time
you had a date night

991
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,834
that was just about
the two of you,

992
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:36,266
not your task-lists?

993
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
Huh...

994
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,934
No idea.

995
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:42,467
We've been so caught up
with our frustrations,

996
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,333
not our romance.

997
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,100
May I suggest

998
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:47,767
taking a time-out
from the acrimony?

999
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,100
Try to remember

1000
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:54,533
why you fell in love
to begin with.

1001
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:55,934
Yeah.

1002
00:41:56,066 --> 00:42:04,066
Thanks.

1003
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:29,166
I have to admit,
this place is pretty magical.

1004
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,367
Do you have the same events
and artisans every year?

1005
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Pretty much.

1006
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:35,166
Most are annual traditions,

1007
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,000
but some are new,

1008
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:37,834
and we escalate,

1009
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:39,487
as we get to the final
Night of Wunder.

1010
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:41,433
Wait, "Night of Wunder"?

1011
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,934
Okay, that is not a coincidence,

1012
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:46,367
that is straight out of a book
I loved as a kid.

1013
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,867
It was...

1014
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,600
Oh! A Wunderbrook
Christmas Story.

1015
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:50,734
Oh, yeah!

1016
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,266
A Wunderbrook Christmas Story.

1017
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,667
I knew this seemed familiar.

1018
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,000
Okay, so you've read it, too?

1019
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:57,033
Oh, yeah.
I loved it back in the day.

1020
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,176
My cousin and I
would read it to each other

1021
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,233
over and over again.

1022
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:00,687
That's what Talia and I
used to do

1023
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,667
before she moved away.

1024
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,900
Hold on a second.

1025
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:09,266
My mother gave it to me, too.

1026
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,233
Hey, are you,

1027
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:11,500
are you familiar

1028
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:13,834
with A Wunderbrook
Christmas Story?

1029
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,834
Sure, it's a classic.

1030
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:17,000
Why do you ask?

1031
00:43:17,133 --> 00:43:19,000
It's just, it's been
a favorite of ours

1032
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:20,767
since we were kids, so...

1033
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,633
I'm surprised it's still popular

1034
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,567
with your generation.

1035
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,166
I'm going to turn in.

1036
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,433
Goodnight.

1037
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:28,967
Okay.

1038
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,166
We've all read
the same Christmas book,

1039
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,133
and we've all
mysteriously arrived

1040
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:34,800
in the same village?

1041
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:36,609
I know my imagination
is a little overactive,

1042
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,667
but this is too much.

1043
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,500
What is going on?

1044
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:46,233
Excuse me a second.

1045
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:47,567
How was the...

1046
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,600
What can you tell me
about "inner conflict"?

1047
00:43:50,734 --> 00:43:52,567
Is that the name
of a rock 'n' roll group?

1048
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,980
I'm afraid
I'm not too up to date

1049
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,233
with my pop-culture facts.

1050
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,233
Level with me, Judy.

1051
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:02,633
There's something
very curious going on here.

1052
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:06,233
Have you been sneaking
into my spiked eggnog reserves?

1053
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm serious.

1054
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:11,367
Wouldn't you agree

1055
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
it's a little odd

1056
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:14,033
that all five of your guests

1057
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:17,367
have old copies of
A Wunderbrook Christmas Story?

1058
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,233
Not really.

1059
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,734
It was a major best-seller
in its heyday.

1060
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,834
Okay, but all your events
come from the book.

1061
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:27,800
How do you explain that?

1062
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:30,834
I admit,
we borrow some of their ideas.

1063
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:33,066
I didn't realize that was
a copyright infringement.

1064
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,834
Right.

1065
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:35,967
Of course, it isn't.

1066
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,509
I'm sorry I came at you
with so much intensity.

1067
00:44:40,533 --> 00:44:43,834
I just sometimes get an idea,
and I run away with it, and...

1068
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:46,867
yeah.

1069
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,567
Goodnight!

1070
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:55,000
Wunderbrook's secret

1071
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:57,633
was kept safe
by the Fairy Queen,

1072
00:44:57,767 --> 00:45:04,967
but for how long?

1073
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,400
Chapter five.

1074
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,266
Hello?
Earth to Talia?

1075
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,834
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

1076
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:23,333
Sorry, I'm just looking up
images of Wunderbrook,

1077
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:25,266
trying to refresh my memory.

1078
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,543
I thought Judy talked you
out of that conspiracy theory.

1079
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:29,967
Ooh, I just lost my connection.

1080
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,767
Maybe that's
not such a bad thing.

1081
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:33,967
Oh.

1082
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,400
Thank you.

1083
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:40,066
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1084
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,433
Mm!

1085
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:44,600
For today's activity,

1086
00:45:44,734 --> 00:45:47,633
you are not casual
Christmas enthusiasts.

1087
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:48,567
Instead,

1088
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,166
you are craft specialists.

1089
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,000
Aye-aye, Captain.
What are we making?

1090
00:45:52,133 --> 00:45:52,900
Christmas stockings,

1091
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:54,100
and if you'd like,

1092
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:55,609
you can leave them
on the inn's mantel

1093
00:45:55,633 --> 00:45:56,767
as a memento of your stay.

1094
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:03,233
I just thought it was about time

1095
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:04,867
I joined the merriment.

1096
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Let's get started.

1097
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,133
That looks...

1098
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:16,734
interesting.

1099
00:46:16,867 --> 00:46:19,500
I have a vision
for a baroque design,

1100
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:20,993
but I think my eyes
might be bigger

1101
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,967
than my artistic aptitudes.

1102
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,533
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

1103
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,633
Oh, yours is perfect, Anderson.

1104
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:30,000
Looks like you're putting
your surgical dexterity

1105
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:31,500
to good use over there, Doc.

1106
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,200
Thank you.

1107
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,300
So, Diane and I will be
flying out of Seattle

1108
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:36,467
when we go home.

1109
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,467
I thought we could make
a date night of it.

1110
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,000
Really?

1111
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:42,700
Oh, that's so nice.

1112
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:46,066
I don't remember the last time
we had a date night.

1113
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,443
Do you have any suggestions
of restaurants that we can go to

1114
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:49,467
for a special occasion?

1115
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,200
- Yeah, Francesco's.
- Francesco's.

1116
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,066
- You've been?
- Yeah.

1117
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,200
I've been dying to go.

1118
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,467
I took my first ever
dating-site match there

1119
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,467
a few months ago.

1120
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,467
She spent the whole dinner

1121
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,076
asking me about
her mom's medications.

1122
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,300
Oh.

1123
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:06,266
Well, he's married
to his work anyway.

1124
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,900
- Aren't you?
- Yeah.

1125
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:11,867
For years I was consumed
by my surgical residency,

1126
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,567
but...

1127
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,233
now I think

1128
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:17,233
maybe I am ready to find
the right person

1129
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,266
to share my life with.

1130
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,076
Well, you better
get back on that app then.

1131
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,767
You know, I actually
think it's better

1132
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,066
just to meet in real life,

1133
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,867
you know, more organic.

1134
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,700
Yeah, like Keith and Diane did.

1135
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:31,600
Oh, when we first met,
I wasn't looking to settle down.

1136
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:33,266
We were so young.

1137
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:41,300
But when you know...

1138
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:42,233
Jake called to check in.

1139
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:43,400
Sounds like the group

1140
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:44,976
is really starting
to open up to each other.

1141
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Good,

1142
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,133
but sharing stories

1143
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:48,133
isn't going to be enough
to complete our mission.

1144
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,367
You know that.

1145
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,400
No, but it is a step
in the right direction.

1146
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:52,967
Perhaps, but beyond that,

1147
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,467
I think Talia is starting
to put things together.

1148
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,700
She's clever, that one.

1149
00:47:56,834 --> 00:47:58,034
Relax, honey.
It's a good sign.

1150
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,867
She's using the gift
of her imagination.

1151
00:48:00,066 --> 00:48:03,667
How did you get to be
so optimistic?

1152
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,200
Would you have me be
any other way?

1153
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:09,166
You know I wouldn't.

1154
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,867
Isn't that fun?

1155
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,967
Ah, there you are!

1156
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,943
Diane and Keith are going to
come hang their stockings later,

1157
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:16,047
but you guys can do it now.

1158
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:18,667
Okay.

1159
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,767
So cute.

1160
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,934
Oh, that looks so good.

1161
00:48:33,467 --> 00:48:34,587
Are these past Wunder Weeks?

1162
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:35,533
Yeah.

1163
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:36,834
Indeed.

1164
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:38,633
We used to get
a lot more visitors here

1165
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:39,767
in the past,

1166
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,800
but quality over quantity, right?

1167
00:48:42,934 --> 00:48:44,266
Oh, Miles,

1168
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,100
you forgot to take a photo
of our group this year!

1169
00:48:47,233 --> 00:48:48,033
Again!

1170
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,467
Oh.

1171
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,700
Get in there. Great.

1172
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:52,700
Aw, you guys look great.

1173
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:53,967
Okay, ready?

1174
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,867
Say "tinsel"!

1175
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,300
One, two, three!

1176
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,500
Tinsel!

1177
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:06,633
Got it!

1178
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:08,400
Hey.

1179
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:09,900
You okay?

1180
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,066
You look upset.

1181
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,867
Still mulling
the Wunderbrook connection?

1182
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,033
Oh, no, no.

1183
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,233
I'm just about to head
to Mildred's to write.

1184
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:19,033
I need a quiet space

1185
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:22,500
and no one's ever there.

1186
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:28,533
Yeah, thanks.

1187
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:30,367
I just, um,

1188
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,033
keep thinking
about Keith and Diane.

1189
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:35,100
I hope they work it out,
you know?

1190
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:38,266
Yeah.

1191
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,600
What about you?

1192
00:49:39,734 --> 00:49:41,867
You, uh, thinking about
going back to the app?

1193
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:46,033
Maybe?

1194
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:47,834
Like I said,

1195
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,567
dating hasn't been a priority
in a long time,

1196
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,066
but...

1197
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,033
I'd like to make it one.

1198
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:54,900
And you?

1199
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,066
Gonna get back out there?

1200
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,166
Oh, uh, no...

1201
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,433
I don't know.

1202
00:49:59,567 --> 00:50:00,700
The next guy on my radar

1203
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:05,166
will probably think
I'm too outlandish.

1204
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,767
Yeah, like
my last boyfriend did.

1205
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,009
That's just 'cause
he didn't realize

1206
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:10,200
what a catch you are.

1207
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,767
Oh, well,

1208
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,533
he is not the first guy
to accuse me

1209
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:15,947
of getting lost in my daydreams.

1210
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,042
Well, I always thought
your overactive imagination

1211
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:21,200
was part of your charm.

1212
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:23,033
Besides, isn't teasing
what boys do

1213
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,333
when they have a crush?

1214
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:25,976
Why do you think
I was always coming around

1215
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,767
to give you a hard time?

1216
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:40,233
Can we talk?

1217
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:48,367
Yeah.

1218
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:59,200
I feel like
we've become strangers, Keith.

1219
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:02,233
I definitely feel
the distance between us,

1220
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:03,743
especially
since you went for partner.

1221
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:05,667
I feel it, too,

1222
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,600
and I know I ask a lot,

1223
00:51:08,734 --> 00:51:10,800
and that I've been
putting work first,

1224
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,433
and it's hard on you,

1225
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:14,233
and us.

1226
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:16,000
Thank you,

1227
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:18,834
for acknowledging that.

1228
00:51:18,967 --> 00:51:21,600
But it's not all on you, D.

1229
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:25,467
I know I haven't adjusted
as well as I should.

1230
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,100
I just...

1231
00:51:27,233 --> 00:51:29,667
miss you.

1232
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,633
We were always
each other's rocks.

1233
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:34,900
I'm your rock?

1234
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:36,233
You miss me?

1235
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:38,133
Yeah.

1236
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:46,266
Well, I can be
pretty great, huh?

1237
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,166
I know you're going to make
a great partner,

1238
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,667
and I'm here for you,

1239
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,967
that's never going to change.

1240
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:02,100
I just need my partner, too.

1241
00:52:02,266 --> 00:52:05,567
I need you, Diane.

1242
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:11,467
I need you, too, Keith.

1243
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:17,233
I need you.

1244
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:18,533
The magic wish...

1245
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:23,500
kiss...

1246
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:26,667
Um, Mildred, can I get
a little more coffee?

1247
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:34,800
I'm on a roll here
with my story.

1248
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,834
You're brave.

1249
00:52:36,967 --> 00:52:37,967
Hmm?

1250
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,667
Only a select few ever make it

1251
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,033
as professional writers.

1252
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:47,467
Personally, I couldn't handle
the disappointment.

1253
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,967
Well, that's true.

1254
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,967
I mean, it hasn't always
been easy.

1255
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,133
You have to have
the perfect storm

1256
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:56,400
of luck,

1257
00:52:56,533 --> 00:52:57,800
talent,

1258
00:52:57,934 --> 00:53:00,633
and circumstance.

1259
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:06,800
It's probably more likely
to win the lottery.

1260
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:07,934
Yeah.

1261
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:09,533
Well, thank you, Mildred,

1262
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:17,667
that's really sage advice.

1263
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,600
Wunderbrook's charm

1264
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:49,734
may be helping some,

1265
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:51,314
but others' dreams
remained challenged

1266
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:59,433
by a sprinkle of doubt.

1267
00:54:01,834 --> 00:54:08,233
Chapter six.

1268
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:09,807
Where's Diane and Keith
this morning?

1269
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,367
I don't know.

1270
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,400
They're usually up
before everyone, aren't they?

1271
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:14,734
Let me guess,

1272
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:16,500
you're imagining some scenario

1273
00:54:16,633 --> 00:54:18,867
in which they're trapped
in the bottom of a well?

1274
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,433
Please, that's so basic.

1275
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:23,500
Are you leaving?
So soon?

1276
00:54:23,633 --> 00:54:24,633
We are.

1277
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,934
We talked last night.

1278
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:28,700
Really talked.

1279
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,166
How'd that go?

1280
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,367
We realized
we missed what we had,

1281
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,100
and as a wise person
once told me,

1282
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:37,233
it's all so fleeting.

1283
00:54:37,367 --> 00:54:39,600
We want to make
our marriage work,

1284
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,200
and as lovely
as this village is,

1285
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,810
and as warmly
as we have been welcomed,

1286
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:46,266
we need to spend some time
with each other.

1287
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,767
Get back to why we fell in love.

1288
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,533
And it's been so good
getting to know you.

1289
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:55,867
You as well, but don't think
you're getting rid of us

1290
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
so soon,

1291
00:54:57,033 --> 00:54:59,166
we're going to visit you
in Seattle.

1292
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,934
Goodbye, Diane.

1293
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:02,306
It was so nice to meet you, man.

1294
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,967
It has been our honor
having you here with us.

1295
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,100
Thank you, everyone.

1296
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:07,433
Happy holidays, everyone. Bye.

1297
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:08,567
Happy holidays.

1298
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,834
- Enjoy the rest of your stay.
- Merry Christmas.

1299
00:55:14,066 --> 00:55:16,633
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

1300
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:17,776
Maybe it's coming from outside?

1301
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,333
Must be it.

1302
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:23,967
Well, today
is our famous market day,

1303
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:31,133
not to be missed.

1304
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:32,967
Charles.

1305
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,900
Something I can help you with?

1306
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:35,233
Um, I don't suppose

1307
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:42,233
you've got any extra
Christmas decorations around?

1308
00:55:44,367 --> 00:55:47,300
Are those...

1309
00:55:47,433 --> 00:55:48,433
decorations?

1310
00:55:48,533 --> 00:55:50,800
Nope.

1311
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:53,567
Judy let me borrow them
from the inn.

1312
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,343
Thought you and I
could spruce up the joint.

1313
00:55:55,367 --> 00:55:56,367
I told you,

1314
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,567
I'm over all that.

1315
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,300
Well, get under it.

1316
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:03,834
You know, I never thought
I'd celebrate the season again,

1317
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:07,166
but my time here
has been quite eye-opening.

1318
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,734
How wonderful.

1319
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:11,200
Another satisfied customer.

1320
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,000
Judy will be tickled.

1321
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:14,233
Frankly,

1322
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:15,834
I've been bitter
about the holidays,

1323
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,734
but if I'm being honest,

1324
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:22,834
it's because I've been lonely...

1325
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:26,300
and I think
you might be, too.

1326
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,000
Come on, humor me.

1327
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:34,834
A little tinsel
never hurt anybody.

1328
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:35,967
Fine,

1329
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,900
but if anyone asks,

1330
00:56:38,033 --> 00:56:40,367
you broke in here
and did all this yourself.

1331
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,800
Consider me guilty as charged.

1332
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,700
Here.

1333
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:49,233
I made it myself.

1334
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:51,133
You made this?

1335
00:56:51,266 --> 00:56:53,500
For me?

1336
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:54,633
With my eyesight,

1337
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:56,200
my skills aren't
what they used to be.

1338
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:01,300
Try not to judge
the workmanship.

1339
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:05,700
It's perfect.

1340
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:08,533
No one has thought
to do anything this nice for me

1341
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:13,300
in a very long time.

1342
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:16,767
Thank you.

1343
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,300
I got you an ornament
with a surgeon's mask,

1344
00:57:19,433 --> 00:57:21,066
and it is so you.

1345
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,200
Do you want to see?

1346
00:57:22,266 --> 00:57:23,633
Yeah.

1347
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:25,633
Isn't it cute?

1348
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:27,433
Yeah.

1349
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:29,533
Yeah, thank you.

1350
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:32,300
Are you okay?

1351
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:34,033
Yeah.

1352
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,266
Yeah, I just... I don't know.

1353
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,767
I don't know if I can continue
to practice medicine.

1354
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,633
Look, I'm not very good
at letting people in,

1355
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:47,867
but you're also
not just people, so...

1356
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,934
I'm going to share
something with you

1357
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:52,476
that I'd really like
to stay between us.

1358
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,800
Yeah, you got it.

1359
00:57:55,934 --> 00:58:02,767
All right.

1360
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,433
A few weeks ago,
I had a patient in

1361
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:07,834
for a routine appendectomy,

1362
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:12,633
which ordinarily is a procedure
that I can perform in my sleep,

1363
00:58:12,767 --> 00:58:15,100
but the patient developed peritonitis

1364
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:16,266
and then sepsis,

1365
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,400
and I couldn't save them.

1366
00:58:17,467 --> 00:58:20,533
Oh, Anderson,

1367
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:23,633
I'm so sorry.

1368
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:26,266
Was this the first patient
you've lost?

1369
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,000
No,

1370
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:29,309
but it is the first
that I've lost

1371
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:31,934
since I've become
the attending in charge,

1372
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:34,100
and it was devastating.

1373
00:58:34,233 --> 00:58:36,667
I had to deliver the news
to the family,

1374
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,500
which is something
that I've had to do before,

1375
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:44,333
but something about this one
was different.

1376
00:58:44,467 --> 00:58:46,166
I don't know.

1377
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,667
I have one job,

1378
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,100
and that is to save
their loved one,

1379
00:58:51,233 --> 00:58:53,633
and I couldn't do it,

1380
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:55,433
and I've been on leave
ever since.

1381
00:58:55,567 --> 00:58:56,767
The hospital put you on leave?

1382
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,000
No.

1383
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:00,333
I put myself on leave.

1384
00:59:00,467 --> 00:59:01,810
Was there something
you could have done differently

1385
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:05,600
for the patient?

1386
00:59:05,734 --> 00:59:07,500
No.

1387
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:08,500
Okay, well then, it sounds to me

1388
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:09,776
like you're punishing yourself

1389
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,433
for something that was...

1390
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:14,834
sadly unavoidable.

1391
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:16,567
What if it happens again?

1392
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,400
Anderson, do not let
one incident derail you

1393
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:22,233
from what you were born to do.

1394
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:23,767
You're a doctor.

1395
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,433
That is your calling.

1396
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:28,609
Well, speaking of your calling,

1397
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:30,000
would you let a few rejections

1398
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,667
derail you from your career?

1399
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,667
That's your calling.

1400
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,166
Not the same.

1401
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,300
If you say so.

1402
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,834
Anyways, thanks for listening.

1403
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:43,100
It felt good
to get that off my chest.

1404
00:59:43,233 --> 00:59:44,533
Can we keep it between us?

1405
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:47,834
Of course, of course.

1406
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:49,867
I'm always here for you.

1407
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I know.

1408
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:53,066
Same.

1409
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,200
Oh!

1410
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:57,000
Now, what is going on here?

1411
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:58,900
You've never seen
Christmas spirit

1412
00:59:59,033 --> 00:59:59,900
on display before?

1413
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:02,734
Well, it looks fantastic.

1414
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:04,934
I think we're just about done.

1415
01:00:05,066 --> 01:00:06,867
You'll have to come back
at night

1416
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and see the lights in action.

1417
01:00:09,133 --> 01:00:11,867
It's a date.

1418
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,533
And then she giggled!
Mildred.

1419
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:15,667
I saw it with my own two eyes.

1420
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,100
Charles was positively buoyant.

1421
01:00:18,233 --> 01:00:20,153
He must derive his own joy
from uplifting others.

1422
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,400
That's an intriguing notion.

1423
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:22,867
Perhaps that's Mildred's gift.

1424
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,834
Helping others find joy
by challenging the status quo.

1425
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:28,233
And maybe she finds
her own joy along the way.

1426
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:29,934
Maybe.

1427
01:00:30,066 --> 01:00:31,834
But I think
Charles also has a crush on her.

1428
01:00:31,967 --> 01:00:33,367
Oh, I see.
"Takes one to know one."

1429
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,100
Isn't that the relevant phrase?

1430
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,033
I see the way
you look at Anderson.

1431
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,166
No.

1432
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,300
No, no.

1433
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:41,367
I look at him normally!

1434
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,100
Ooh, the lady
doth protest too much.

1435
01:00:45,233 --> 01:00:46,233
I admit nothing...

1436
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,009
And hypothetically,
it wouldn't matter anyway.

1437
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:49,900
We've just resumed
our friendship

1438
01:00:50,033 --> 01:00:52,333
and I would never want
to jeopardize that.

1439
01:00:52,467 --> 01:00:55,000
So, you think telling him
how you feel

1440
01:00:55,133 --> 01:00:57,367
could jeopardize
your relationship?

1441
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,567
Hypothetically?

1442
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,633
Okay. He may have had
a schoolboy crush on me

1443
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:03,233
when we were kids,

1444
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:04,727
but he needs
an accomplished woman,

1445
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,109
someone further along
in their career.

1446
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:09,000
I do not fit that description.

1447
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:15,233
Okay, but what if
you're wrong about that?

1448
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:17,233
Is it simply Christmas cheer,

1449
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:18,967
or is something
even more magical

1450
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:26,867
spreading through Wunderbrook?

1451
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Chapter seven.

1452
01:01:32,133 --> 01:01:33,200
Hey.

1453
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,400
Morning, sunshine.

1454
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:35,734
Morning.

1455
01:01:35,867 --> 01:01:37,033
Bought you something.

1456
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:39,233
Oh, thank you.

1457
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:40,734
Look at you helping out.

1458
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:42,500
It's like you're teacher's pet.

1459
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:44,633
No.

1460
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:45,633
Oh, it's true.
You guys are basically

1461
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:47,867
the king and queen
of this village.

1462
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,900
No, we're not!

1463
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:51,400
That's absurd.

1464
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:52,700
No, I meant you're the mayor

1465
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,533
and Judy's
basically in charge of things?

1466
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:58,633
It's all a group effort.

1467
01:01:58,767 --> 01:01:59,834
Good morning!

1468
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:04,200
We're on our way to grab
the bells for the procession.

1469
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:06,033
The princess and the fool...

1470
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:07,900
just like in the book.

1471
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:09,300
- What?
- What?

1472
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:17,433
Oh, sorry.
I think I'm still half asleep.

1473
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:19,867
Oh, back again, huh?

1474
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,467
You're going to get
sick of my cooking.

1475
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,600
I doubt that.

1476
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:25,533
But I'm not here to eat.

1477
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:27,767
I'm here to invite you

1478
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,133
to accompany me
to the procession tonight.

1479
01:02:31,266 --> 01:02:33,767
You're going to that?

1480
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:40,800
I was planning to finish
my year-end accounting tonight.

1481
01:02:40,934 --> 01:02:42,233
Mildred,

1482
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:43,934
it would be my honor

1483
01:02:44,066 --> 01:02:45,266
to escort you this evening.

1484
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,266
Maybe.

1485
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:55,400
If I can find the time.

1486
01:03:04,066 --> 01:03:05,066
You look beautiful.

1487
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,200
Not that you don't usually...

1488
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:11,633
You just...
You look extra radiant.

1489
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:16,133
You look pretty good yourself.

1490
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:17,333
Judy lent me this coat.

1491
01:03:17,467 --> 01:03:19,800
- Isn't it great?
- Yeah.

1492
01:03:19,934 --> 01:03:23,300
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1493
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,500
- One for you.
- Thank you.

1494
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:27,133
One for you.

1495
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:30,100
I am not exactly
a musical prodigy.

1496
01:03:30,233 --> 01:03:31,333
Well, these bells

1497
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:33,600
have a way of maintaining
a harmony all on their own.

1498
01:03:33,734 --> 01:03:39,200
He means try your best.

1499
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:40,367
You okay, Charles?

1500
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,834
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

1501
01:03:42,967 --> 01:03:46,600
I was just...
I was hoping that...

1502
01:03:46,734 --> 01:03:47,767
it's okay.

1503
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,643
My mom and Uncle Jake
have to lead the procession.

1504
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:52,000
I'll walk with you!

1505
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:56,000
That's very kind, young lady.

1506
01:03:56,133 --> 01:04:03,200
Well, shall we?

1507
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:05,900
My dad would get
such a kick out of this.

1508
01:04:06,033 --> 01:04:07,567
He loved pageantry.

1509
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,900
What do you mean?

1510
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:13,166
He said I was born
to do great things,

1511
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,266
but I have zip
to show for myself,

1512
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,333
other than a career that stalled
before it even began.

1513
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:21,600
I sometimes feel like
I let him down.

1514
01:04:21,734 --> 01:04:23,367
You could never.

1515
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,100
Look, it's
a really tough industry

1516
01:04:25,233 --> 01:04:27,600
and he would be so proud
of how hard you tried.

1517
01:04:27,734 --> 01:04:28,734
It's just, like,

1518
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:31,600
whenever I try
to consider my future,

1519
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,367
it's paralyzing.

1520
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,367
It's almost like

1521
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,976
I can only imagine
the worst-case scenario

1522
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,367
when the subject is myself.

1523
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,266
Is this a mid-life crisis?

1524
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,680
I don't know
anything about that,

1525
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,834
but I do know

1526
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:47,033
that your father loved you
more than anything,

1527
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:49,900
and it has nothing to do
with your accomplishments.

1528
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:53,700
Thanks, Anderson.
That means a lot.

1529
01:04:53,834 --> 01:04:54,843
Now, please,
no more compliments,

1530
01:04:54,867 --> 01:05:00,667
otherwise it's going to go
to my head.

1531
01:05:08,133 --> 01:05:09,567
May I have this dance?

1532
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,467
You may.

1533
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,467
Just don't expect me
to trip all over your feet.

1534
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,834
- I've got some moves.
- Yeah?

1535
01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:21,667
Yeah.

1536
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,734
You're fashionably late.

1537
01:05:29,867 --> 01:05:31,834
But you look lovely.

1538
01:05:31,967 --> 01:05:34,133
- Shall we?
- Oh. Okay.

1539
01:05:34,266 --> 01:05:41,734
If you insist.

1540
01:05:41,867 --> 01:05:43,967
Aw! Could they be any cuter?

1541
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:48,300
Looks like love is in the air.

1542
01:05:48,433 --> 01:05:50,133
Mildred, when I first
arrived here,

1543
01:05:50,266 --> 01:05:52,834
I was such a miserable Grinch.

1544
01:05:52,967 --> 01:05:55,800
Well, it takes one to know one.

1545
01:05:55,934 --> 01:05:57,900
I'm not exactly
the life of the party.

1546
01:05:58,033 --> 01:05:59,934
Maybe not,

1547
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:03,133
but in this short
amount of time,

1548
01:06:03,266 --> 01:06:08,233
you've brought so much color
back into my life.

1549
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:09,667
Thank you.

1550
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,142
Now, don't tell anyone
I said this,

1551
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,367
but...

1552
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:19,500
I'm glad you showed up here.

1553
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:24,233
Did you hear that?

1554
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:25,233
Yeah.

1555
01:06:25,367 --> 01:06:28,567
I have been racking my brain

1556
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,233
trying to figure out
when I've heard that before...

1557
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:33,166
And do you know when it was?

1558
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,667
I'm going to tell you.

1559
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,834
It was when my dad

1560
01:06:35,967 --> 01:06:38,000
gave me a copy of
A Wunderbrook Christmas Story.

1561
01:06:38,133 --> 01:06:40,533
And I heard it again
when I gave a copy to you.

1562
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:41,967
Really?

1563
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:42,967
Hang on a second.

1564
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,567
Excuse me.
Judy, Miles.

1565
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,567
- Hi.
- Hi.

1566
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:46,743
Could you guys please just admit

1567
01:06:46,767 --> 01:06:48,800
that something magical
is going on here?

1568
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:50,000
Magical?

1569
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:51,667
Christmas is a magical time.

1570
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,066
I'll admit that the village
has its quirks,

1571
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,240
but isn't this a bit much?

1572
01:06:55,266 --> 01:06:57,633
Okay. Five disparate people
show up

1573
01:06:57,767 --> 01:06:59,700
through very strange circumstances

1574
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:01,066
to the same town,

1575
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,066
all coincidentally having read
the same fairy-tale story?

1576
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,200
It is completely improbable

1577
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:08,734
without some
otherworldly explanation.

1578
01:07:08,867 --> 01:07:09,967
Not to mention,

1579
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,767
all five of us

1580
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,300
had very obvious
emotional challenges

1581
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:15,433
we needed to overcome.

1582
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:17,300
Keith and Diane's marriage
was falling apart,

1583
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,133
Charles was grieving,

1584
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:21,133
I'm clearly a disaster,

1585
01:07:21,266 --> 01:07:22,800
this guy has lost a patient...

1586
01:07:22,934 --> 01:07:24,233
Uh-uh!

1587
01:07:24,367 --> 01:07:27,533
Enough is enough.

1588
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:29,600
Imagination is one thing,

1589
01:07:29,734 --> 01:07:31,633
but this is crazy.

1590
01:07:31,767 --> 01:07:33,700
What will you
accuse us all of next?

1591
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:36,967
You have got to stop
living in your daydream

1592
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:40,266
and pay attention
to reality, dear.

1593
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,600
So you all think I'm ridiculous?

1594
01:07:42,734 --> 01:07:44,533
Your mind is obviously
playing tricks on you

1595
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:47,533
so you don't
have to face the truth.

1596
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:48,767
Which is?

1597
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,867
That you have been so afraid

1598
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,633
that you've allowed
your dreams to fail.

1599
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:54,867
Wait, that's not fair.

1600
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,700
Well, at least
she didn't abandon

1601
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:58,433
a well-earned profession...

1602
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:01,333
Something that could
actually save peoples' lives.

1603
01:08:01,467 --> 01:08:03,209
Mildred! I thought
you had turned over a new leaf.

1604
01:08:03,233 --> 01:08:04,233
How could you?

1605
01:08:04,266 --> 01:08:12,266
And a leopard
doesn't change its spots.

1606
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:13,967
This is what happens

1607
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:20,600
when you invite me
to these things.

1608
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:22,134
I asked you
to keep that between us.

1609
01:08:22,233 --> 01:08:23,867
I'm sorry.
It just slipped out.

1610
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,433
Yeah, you really
got carried away.

1611
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:30,767
Maybe Mildred's got a point.

1612
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,300
So much
for my active imagination

1613
01:08:32,433 --> 01:08:35,667
being part of my charm
then, huh?

1614
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,667
It's not like she was
so off-base about you either.

1615
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,667
I'm sorry, everybody,

1616
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,076
you don't deserve us
messing up your night.

1617
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,776
Anderson, let's go for a walk,
let you decompress...

1618
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,433
I'm just going
to go back to the inn.

1619
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:45,433
I'm taking off
first thing in the morning.

1620
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:46,767
But the Night of Wunder is...

1621
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:54,900
Something I'll have to miss.

1622
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:58,467
Though truth
is welcome in Wunderbrook,

1623
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:06,600
some truths can cause
more heartbreak than healing.

1624
01:09:16,467 --> 01:09:20,433
Is there anything I can do
to change your mind?

1625
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:23,767
Judy, you've been
an excellent host.

1626
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,767
I gotta be on my way.

1627
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:28,633
Okay, well, if you must go,
we understand.

1628
01:09:28,767 --> 01:09:31,166
Please do come back
and visit us again?

1629
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:39,300
Thanks for everything.

1630
01:10:13,066 --> 01:10:15,567
Oh! Hey, Charles.

1631
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,767
Dramatic night last night.

1632
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,667
You're not kidding.

1633
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,042
I don't know what to make of it.

1634
01:10:21,066 --> 01:10:25,600
I'm turning it around
in my head.

1635
01:10:25,734 --> 01:10:28,266
Charles, are you okay?

1636
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:33,667
I don't...

1637
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,834
Something's not right.

1638
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:42,967
Judy! Anybody!
I need some help here!

1639
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:46,934
Where's my phone?

1640
01:10:47,066 --> 01:10:48,767
Charles, can you hear us?

1641
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,800
Do something.

1642
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:51,934
Judy? What's wrong?

1643
01:10:51,967 --> 01:10:52,834
It's Charles.

1644
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:54,042
His breathing was shallow
and he fainted.

1645
01:10:54,066 --> 01:10:55,876
- I didn't know...
- Anderson, help him, please.

1646
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,176
We think he's having
a heart attack.

1647
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,800
I need my medical bag
out of my car.

1648
01:10:59,934 --> 01:11:04,834
On it.

1649
01:11:04,967 --> 01:11:06,476
Well, Charles is settled
into his room.

1650
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,066
His blood pressure
dropped suddenly,

1651
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,320
which mimics a heart attack.

1652
01:11:09,433 --> 01:11:11,533
But he just needs to hydrate
and up his sodium intake

1653
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:12,533
and he'll be fine.

1654
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:13,867
Thank goodness, you were here.

1655
01:11:13,934 --> 01:11:16,800
Thank goodness,
I had left my phone.

1656
01:11:16,934 --> 01:11:19,700
I thought I had it.

1657
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:20,967
Just glad it all worked out.

1658
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,700
So, how did it feel,

1659
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:26,133
getting back into doctor mode?

1660
01:11:26,266 --> 01:11:29,800
It felt...

1661
01:11:29,934 --> 01:11:32,333
it felt like my calling.

1662
01:11:32,467 --> 01:11:34,000
It is, Anderson.

1663
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:35,533
This is your gift.

1664
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:36,900
And the world needs it.

1665
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:40,133
The world needs you.

1666
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:43,633
Okay, is this a prank?

1667
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,343
Because if it is,
it's not funny, all right,

1668
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:47,633
especially after
the day I've had.

1669
01:11:47,767 --> 01:11:48,800
Judy,

1670
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:50,367
I think it's time

1671
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,000
we told the good doctor
the truth.

1672
01:11:53,133 --> 01:11:54,533
Wait, start over here.
You lost me.

1673
01:11:54,667 --> 01:11:55,734
So...

1674
01:11:55,867 --> 01:11:57,333
so you're telling me

1675
01:11:57,467 --> 01:12:00,367
that this town is from
a made-up Christmas fable?

1676
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,700
Yes, Anderson.
It is.

1677
01:12:02,834 --> 01:12:03,600
And the chimes?

1678
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:04,800
The first time it rings

1679
01:12:04,934 --> 01:12:06,734
is when someone
receives the book.

1680
01:12:06,867 --> 01:12:08,200
The second time,

1681
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:10,033
it signifies
the healing was successful.

1682
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:11,867
We know it's a lot to take in,

1683
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,266
but this is all very real.

1684
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,033
So she was right?

1685
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,066
About everything?

1686
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,066
- I gotta tell her...
- No, wait, wait.

1687
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,066
You can't.

1688
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,266
If she knows the truth,

1689
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,133
it'll interfere with
the integrity of the process.

1690
01:12:27,266 --> 01:12:28,533
I see.

1691
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:36,667
You know, for a made-up village,
you guys have a lot of rules.

1692
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,100
Come in.

1693
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,767
I won't stay,
but I heard what happened.

1694
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,433
I brought you
some of your favorites.

1695
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:49,433
Extra sodium,

1696
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:57,567
as per Doc Anderson's
instructions.

1697
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:03,700
How come you went after
him and Talia like that?

1698
01:13:03,834 --> 01:13:05,333
I heard about your reputation,

1699
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:09,700
but you were so biting.

1700
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:12,500
I don't recognize you.

1701
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:16,700
I wish
I could make you understand.

1702
01:13:16,834 --> 01:13:19,767
But please believe,

1703
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:26,266
I'm still the same person
you invited to the procession.

1704
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,867
Rest up, Charlie.

1705
01:13:36,266 --> 01:13:37,266
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1706
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,000
Welcome to the most magical
night of the year!

1707
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:42,934
Welcome to the Night of Wunder.

1708
01:14:17,367 --> 01:14:19,700
Pretty "wunder" ful, huh?

1709
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:23,734
You're still here?

1710
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:27,700
Turns out there's no place else
I needed to be.

1711
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,367
I...

1712
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,600
I heard Charles is on the mend.

1713
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:46,100
Are you okay?

1714
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:47,533
Yeah, yeah,

1715
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:50,166
I think I got my sea-legs back.

1716
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:54,400
Thanks to your encouragement.

1717
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:57,567
- I'm really sorry...
- I...

1718
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,400
Please. Ladies first.

1719
01:15:00,533 --> 01:15:01,400
I'm really sorry

1720
01:15:01,533 --> 01:15:04,300
that I revealed
your private information.

1721
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:05,300
I just got caught up

1722
01:15:05,433 --> 01:15:08,066
in this crazy conspiracy theory

1723
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,300
and it just slipped out.

1724
01:15:11,433 --> 01:15:12,800
It's okay.

1725
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:15,834
I'm sorry
that I took Mildred's side.

1726
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:17,400
I, of all people,

1727
01:15:17,533 --> 01:15:22,066
should know how anxiety
can take hold.

1728
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,967
Truce?

1729
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,900
I think I can live with that.

1730
01:15:28,033 --> 01:15:28,900
And I promise,

1731
01:15:29,033 --> 01:15:30,166
that is the last time

1732
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,934
I'm going to let
my imagination run wild.

1733
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:35,266
I actually convinced myself

1734
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,567
that I was
in some magical world.

1735
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,266
It's so embarrassing.

1736
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,500
And I got obsessed.

1737
01:15:41,633 --> 01:15:42,767
It's so silly.

1738
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,500
I'm so sorry.

1739
01:15:45,633 --> 01:15:47,300
I meant what I said before.

1740
01:15:47,433 --> 01:15:49,066
It really is part of your charm.

1741
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,900
Truly.

1742
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:54,767
I got you a bit of
an early Christmas present...

1743
01:15:54,900 --> 01:16:02,900
More of a re-gift.

1744
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,567
Are these my old stories?

1745
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:13,800
Yeah.

1746
01:16:13,934 --> 01:16:16,033
"He held onto them,"
she thought,

1747
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:24,166
"even when I was ready
to let them go."

1748
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:30,500
ine.

1749
01:16:30,633 --> 01:16:32,200
My old stories?

1750
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:34,333
What, you actually kept these?

1751
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:36,266
Yeah. Yeah. I found them
while I was packing.

1752
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,767
I... I thought your dad

1753
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:41,000
would want you
to have those back.

1754
01:16:41,133 --> 01:16:45,166
I'm speechless.

1755
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,000
Thank you.

1756
01:16:49,133 --> 01:16:49,967
Wow.

1757
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:58,066
Are those your stories, Talia?

1758
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,667
Oh.

1759
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,967
I get it.

1760
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:08,800
I've gotten it wrong
this whole time.

1761
01:17:08,934 --> 01:17:10,166
I kept thinking

1762
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,433
that my dad's greatest fear

1763
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:17,967
was that I wouldn't become
some big, fancy author.

1764
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,734
But his greatest fear

1765
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:21,967
was that I would become stuck,

1766
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:26,633
which is exactly what happened.

1767
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,567
I have been
in this holding pattern

1768
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:29,834
since he passed,

1769
01:17:29,967 --> 01:17:31,600
just so terrified.

1770
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:34,066
I think because he was so young,

1771
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,100
I've been afraid
to imagine my own future.

1772
01:17:37,233 --> 01:17:41,400
And I've let it hold me back
from so many opportunities.

1773
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:42,900
I am a writer.

1774
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,900
This I know.

1775
01:17:45,033 --> 01:17:46,033
It is my calling,

1776
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:47,066
it is in my bones,

1777
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,667
it is in my heart.

1778
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,266
I'm not questioning that.
I am a writer.

1779
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,066
But that's not
what this is about.

1780
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,667
This is about my own fear.

1781
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,934
I have been so afraid
to do what I love

1782
01:17:59,066 --> 01:18:02,133
or be with someone that I love

1783
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:03,867
because what if
I lose them, too?

1784
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,667
I am done living in fear.

1785
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,734
I am done!

1786
01:18:08,867 --> 01:18:11,500
Do you hear me?

1787
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,033
Looks like it worked, Mildred.

1788
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,033
All part of your big plan.

1789
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:29,367
I always believed in you.

1790
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,367
That was...

1791
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,200
- I'm not done.
- Okay.

1792
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:35,000
Anderson...

1793
01:18:35,133 --> 01:18:39,200
I have feelings for you.

1794
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:41,300
You keep me grounded,

1795
01:18:41,433 --> 01:18:46,066
you give me the space
to be exactly who I am...

1796
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,440
and ever since we were kids,

1797
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:51,033
you've always made me feel
like I'm special.

1798
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:57,033
There's nobody
more special to me than you.

1799
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,400
I have feelings for you, too.

1800
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:01,600
Can you say that again?

1801
01:19:01,734 --> 01:19:02,800
I always have.

1802
01:19:02,934 --> 01:19:05,600
Your joie de vivre
puts a smile on my face.

1803
01:19:05,734 --> 01:19:07,600
And after spending
this time with you,

1804
01:19:07,734 --> 01:19:11,767
I can't imagine
my life without you.

1805
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,367
Shouldn't you be resting?

1806
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,734
Didn't want to miss all the fun.

1807
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:20,934
And besides,
I have a proposition.

1808
01:19:21,066 --> 01:19:23,033
I don't know
what happened last night...

1809
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:24,934
And that doesn't matter.

1810
01:19:25,066 --> 01:19:30,200
What matters is that I know you.

1811
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:33,633
I want to stay in Wunderbrook.

1812
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:35,100
Indefinitely.

1813
01:19:35,233 --> 01:19:37,200
If you'll allow me?

1814
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:39,066
You do?

1815
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,033
I do.

1816
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:43,200
Well, I mean,

1817
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:46,533
I guess I could get used
to having you around.

1818
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:48,367
Besides, you're pretty cute.

1819
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,009
Nobody has ever asked us
to stay before.

1820
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:51,033
This is unprecedented.

1821
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:52,209
We'll have to consider
all the ramifications...

1822
01:19:52,233 --> 01:19:54,033
Stay, Charles.

1823
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:55,300
We know you'll make

1824
01:19:55,433 --> 01:19:57,934
the perfect addition
to our ranks.

1825
01:19:58,066 --> 01:19:59,066
So, does this mean

1826
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:00,509
we get to tell everybody
about everything now?

1827
01:20:00,533 --> 01:20:06,133
Tell us about what?

1828
01:20:06,266 --> 01:20:08,066
Okay, I think I need a minute
to process this.

1829
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:09,867
That makes two of us.

1830
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,600
So, you all aren't
making this up

1831
01:20:11,734 --> 01:20:15,066
to humor me for some reason?

1832
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,934
I knew it!

1833
01:20:17,066 --> 01:20:19,100
I knew it wasn't
just my imagination.

1834
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:22,734
So, I'm actually
inside a magical world?

1835
01:20:22,867 --> 01:20:25,200
So, you're
the king and the queen?

1836
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:28,700
And the freckled princess?

1837
01:20:28,834 --> 01:20:29,700
And the witch and the fool.

1838
01:20:29,834 --> 01:20:30,867
No offense.

1839
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:37,066
Hey, someone's gotta do it.

1840
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,133
So, my dad came here

1841
01:20:39,266 --> 01:20:42,100
in time
of his own inner conflict...

1842
01:20:42,233 --> 01:20:45,033
and that's why he gave me
his copy of Wunderbrook.

1843
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:46,376
In case you needed it some day.

1844
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,433
This is so incredible.

1845
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:49,433
You all are going to help

1846
01:20:49,567 --> 01:20:54,467
so many people
for generations to come.

1847
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,467
Maybe not.

1848
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,800
Why would you ever stop?

1849
01:20:56,934 --> 01:20:58,200
We won't.

1850
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:01,033
But the popularity of
A Wunderbrook Christmas Story

1851
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:03,200
is waning more and more
each year.

1852
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:08,333
It's only a matter of time
before people stop showing up.

1853
01:21:08,467 --> 01:21:10,867
But hey, why be so maudlin?

1854
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,700
We had a successful group
this year,

1855
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:14,000
and just in the nick of time,

1856
01:21:14,133 --> 01:21:15,834
so tonight, let's celebrate.

1857
01:21:15,967 --> 01:21:19,333
Everyone, get out there
and enjoy this...

1858
01:21:19,467 --> 01:21:20,667
Night of Wunder!

1859
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:28,800
We insist!

1860
01:21:31,066 --> 01:21:32,066
So...

1861
01:21:32,133 --> 01:21:34,800
so where were we?

1862
01:21:34,934 --> 01:21:37,333
I can't really recall.

1863
01:21:37,467 --> 01:21:40,834
Maybe I need to borrow
some of Miles' mistletoe stash?

1864
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:48,967
I don't think
we're going to need any.

1865
01:21:51,467 --> 01:21:53,000
You were right, you know.

1866
01:21:53,133 --> 01:21:54,467
About Wunderbrook?

1867
01:21:54,600 --> 01:22:02,600
No. About kismet.

1868
01:22:08,533 --> 01:22:09,934
And as this year's story

1869
01:22:10,066 --> 01:22:11,500
comes to an end,

1870
01:22:11,633 --> 01:22:15,066
the fate of Wunderbrook's future
has also been secured,

1871
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:23,200
thanks to a new best-seller.

1872
01:22:24,633 --> 01:22:25,500
I knew you had it in you, Tal.

1873
01:22:25,633 --> 01:22:27,200
We all did.

1874
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:28,667
Congratulations, Talia.

1875
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:29,900
You did amazing.

1876
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:31,700
Almost ready for your speech?

1877
01:22:31,834 --> 01:22:33,567
I gotta get back
to the hospital soon.

1878
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:40,400
Ready as I'll ever be.

1879
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:42,400
Hey, you look familiar.

1880
01:22:42,533 --> 01:22:45,500
Nope, nope,
not doing that again.

1881
01:22:45,633 --> 01:22:46,500
I hope you've found

1882
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:48,734
everything you were
looking for, sir.

1883
01:22:48,867 --> 01:22:55,266
I'm quite sure I have,
thank you.

1884
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,934
Now my part of the tale

1885
01:22:57,066 --> 01:22:59,066
has come
to its happy conclusion,

1886
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,300
for I, too,

1887
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:04,133
have fulfilled my destiny
of passing on my story.

1888
01:23:04,266 --> 01:23:05,600
Good afternoon.

1889
01:23:05,734 --> 01:23:09,567
Thank you so much for coming
to this book launch...

1890
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,400
Who's that guy, Miss Talia?

1891
01:23:11,533 --> 01:23:14,800
Oh, that is Wunderbrook's
newest resident...

1892
01:23:14,934 --> 01:23:16,934
The noble knight.

1893
01:23:17,066 --> 01:23:18,800
Here, this copy is for you.
