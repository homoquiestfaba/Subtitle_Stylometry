00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:12,930
<i>When he opened the third seal</i>

2
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,948
<i>I heard the third living creature
saying. Come</i>

3
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,558
<i>And I looked, and behold,
one black horse;</i>

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,311
<i>And he that sat on him had a balance
in hand</i>

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,480
<i>Revelation 6:5</i>

6
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:29,571
<i>2 years after the event
Wolf Point, Montana</i>

7
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,625
Abner!

8
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:46,755
I say... Mr. Drake, please!

9
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,884
It was just a meat pie!

10
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,054
My family was hungry.

11
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,598
I'll pay!

12
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:02,688
We know from high school!

13
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:08,068
Look what you do!

14
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,946
Is not right!

15
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:15,325
Abner! Abner!

16
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,629
You're right, Drake, look at you!

17
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,882
We are all hungry.

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,760
Would you forgive him?

19
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,470
Want anarchy...?

20
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,849
Theft, rape and murder
unpunished?

21
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,477
Want to live outside
like them?

22
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:47,024
Scavengers and cannibals?
Is that what you want?

23
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,818
Then pack and go!

24
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,113
Not what I meant.

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,533
I thought so.

26
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,703
We are civilized people

27
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,873
and I keep order...

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,459
regardless.

29
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,624
Come on! Kill him now!

30
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,877
Do not leave! Drives very well.

31
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,013
Get the molotov!

32
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,583
Not understand. Take out the good stuff!

33
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,085
But it is only for emergencies.

34
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,880
And do you think it is!

35
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,099
Dale.

36
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,113
Hey, my rifle!

37
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,157
Dale with dynamite!

38
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,054
Comes by side!
Dale with dynamite!

39
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,020
You, leech...!

40
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,814
Noooo!

41
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,525
Hey
worth one tank of gas!

42
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,193
Care!

43
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,825
<b><i>The Black Rider: Revelation Road</b></i>

44
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,229
Stay away! It's mine!

45
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,160
I thirst.

46
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,924
Am I going to die?

47
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,434
There is no alternative.

48
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,962
Mr. Drake, president appreciates

49
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,672
effort here at the border.

50
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,173
Your situation is difficult.

51
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,843
Not need praise, but
food, weapons.

52
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,344
The board believes that their rations

53
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,055
are suitable
climate and population.

54
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,765
Are a joke!

55
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,267
My people starve.

56
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,353
Well see, some unscrupulous mayors

57
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,728
these border towns hog rations.

58
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,774
They feed well with their delegates

59
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,026
while the rest suffer hunger,

60
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,988
But do not believe you.
Sea of those.

61
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,489
Of course not.

62
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,158
The next year
every citizen must be identified,

63
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,202
evaluated and have a range.

64
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,371
Believe me, Mr. Drake, there are advantages

65
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,039
having a high rank.

66
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,749
What do you want in return?

67
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,211
To evaluate its usefulness, ULC

68
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,714
asked capture a criminal

69
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,924
called the Pastor in its territory.

70
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,177
Sounds easy; But it is not.

71
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,929
No matter.
It is a priority for President.

72
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,890
Should catch it.

73
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,309
Not return repeated.

74
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,019
Is it a threat?

75
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,520
Course!

76
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,439
If there gives us the shepherd,

77
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,482
replace it.

78
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,194
Have a week.

79
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,039
Are you, right?

80
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:23,128
The northerner who all speak.

81
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,298
Say you never lose a fight.

82
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,134
Just Like Heaven.

83
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,012
I'm cold.

84
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,514
Would you pray for me?

85
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,141
No need.
I will heal you.

86
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,062
According dad, God does not hear our prayers
,

87
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,981
since that day.

88
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,485
But maybe
Yes you will listen..

89
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,459
Hello!

90
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,169
What do you want?

91
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,798
Help: I bring a girl wound

92
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,008
And...?

93
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,344
Open step!

94
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,054
I need a doctor.

95
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,223
I pay.

96
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,852
Show me what you bring.

97
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,565
No time. Die.

98
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,943
Please open the passage.

99
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,945
I do not like your attitude.

100
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,613
Back tomorrow.

101
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,158
Hey!

102
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,207
Wait! Stop!

103
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,418
Out of the car!

104
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,838
Hands up!

105
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,381
Okay. All Right.

106
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,091
Shame on you!

107
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,593
Bring a girl wound.

108
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,137
What will reject not pay you?

109
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,847
Drake will know, Sofia.

110
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,348
I'm warning you!

111
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,350
Maybe you speak of that
poison you call liquor

112
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,060
and plants in your basement.

113
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,189
My basement would be
a good place to hide you corpse.

114
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,524
He comes with me.

115
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,360
We'll see.

116
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,323
You really can afford?
I risked his neck for you.

117
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,243
I pay. Thank You.

118
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,995
'm Josh.

119
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,456
No matter. Follow Me.

120
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,935
Can we go faster?

121
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,313
We must draw attention.

122
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,027
Idiots!

123
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,659
What is your problem?

124
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,369
They are hungry.

125
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,538
The mayor keeps them at bay.

126
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,123
But not you?

127
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,917
That will not matter.

128
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,460
Make heal your wife and go.

129
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,254
It is my wife; Just 16

130
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,964
Yes, of course.

131
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,465
Scavengers abducted.

132
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,235
His parents asked me to rescue her.

133
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:19,263
Is that yours:
Rescuing girls?

134
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,223
Just trying to help whenever I can.

135
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,058
Another religious fanatic.

136
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,560
A what...?

137
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,228
A tip:

138
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,021
Do not try to preach here.

139
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,524
People do not want to hear that.

140
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,609
Over there.

141
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,487
Stab in the abdomen.

142
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,282
Good. Step back, please.

143
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,955
How serious is it?

144
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,462
No I'll steal.

145
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,632
It is better not to see.

146
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,401
Sheriff! Sheriff!

147
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,779
There is a problem in the past.

148
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,448
Take care.

149
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,283
Show me.

150
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,999
Really
you care for her!

151
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,335
Are you surprised?

152
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,045
Think so.

153
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,257
Who cares for others
not last long out there.

154
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,635
And it looks like you've been
active while.

155
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,638
I was in northern awhile.

156
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,681
In the north?

157
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,018
Yes, many need help there.

158
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,020
What?

159
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:53,524
I heard legends of the north, about a man
,

160
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,693
a fan that helps people

161
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,196
Are you?

162
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,115
It's everything I have.
Is it enough?

163
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,284
Lord, the wound is deep.

164
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,328
There are many damages.

165
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,330
I'm not qualified.

166
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,123
Are not you Doctor?

167
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,042
No.

168
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:15,671
Y
is there anyone else who can help?

169
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,506
Not anymore.

170
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,177
My mom was the surgeon
village.

171
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:25,389
Was it? Where is?

172
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,517
's Gone.
It's everything you need to know.

173
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,186
Is she alive?

174
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,688
I do not know.

175
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,607
Listen, we have antibiotics

176
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,360
to keep her alive a few days.

177
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,862
This will cover the expenses.

178
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,864
How many days?

179
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,491
Maybe three.

180
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,577
After
more would have to ask the mayor,

181
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,789
and I know what his answer.

182
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,624
Do it.

183
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,459
Where is your mother?

184
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,880
Oh, no.

185
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,391
Nice car.

186
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,353
My chief says you
illegally entered the village..

187
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,002
Here we take seriously the law.

188
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,566
I let him in, Victor.
Bring a wounded girl.

189
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,401
You shut.

190
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,613
This is what will happen:

191
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:27,409
I give you your keys and pay a fine.

192
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,161
If you can not afford...

193
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,205
work.

194
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,583
Do not behave well.

195
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,295
Keys.

196
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,277
Kill him!

197
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,390
Knees, or I'll kill you.

198
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,225
He did nothing.
It was my fault!

199
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,477
'll Take care of you later.

200
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,323
Take your hands off me!

201
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,650
It's a 1972 Plymouth Roadrunner

202
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,778
With 383 engine, go!

203
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,406
's My new baby.

204
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,491
Treat it well.

205
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:37,706
What a view! Huh?

206
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:43,838
Come on, give me a reason.

207
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,637
Tomorrow
hang it with my hand holding the rope,

208
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,682
as I feel how you asphyxia

209
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,899
Sal

210
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,568
I think it's a bad idea.

211
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:52,322
Let me think.

212
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:59,830
Josh McManus.

213
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,541
Do you know? Occasionally come here
religious fanatics.

214
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,003
Rangers crossed
only cause problems.

215
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,466
God talk a lot but do not respect our laws.

216
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,595
But lock them over drinks

217
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,096
and see how they really are.

218
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,931
Where are you going?

219
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,103
Where do I want to reach?

220
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,652
I think you're authentic.

221
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,821
I come all these stories

222
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,949
on a black rider north

223
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:40,454
a man of God who never lost a fight.

224
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,372
I just tried to save the girl;

225
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:45,459
Did not want to cause problems.

226
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:49,004
You came to my village
illegally attacking my delegates.

227
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,672
Now I hang.

228
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,382
's The law.

229
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:57,721
But... Luckily,
both want the same thing:

230
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,892
A Grace's mother, Sofia,
and town doctor.

231
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,688
The need,
we.

232
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,815
Where is?

233
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,069
Have you heard of Pastor?

234
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,905
Yes, it is something of a prophet.

235
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,615
It's a tramp.

236
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,450
Name is George Hilcott.

237
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,703
Last winter
roamed the people saying crazy things.

238
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,039
One day just disappeared.

239
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,916
Thought he was dead;

240
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,585
Then I heard who was gathering followers
,

241
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,879
and performing miracles.

242
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,882
Grace ran after him in the summer.

243
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,009
We send people to search.

244
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:39,137
Some returned empty handed.

245
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:42,224
Others never returned.

246
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,893
And you think I
I can find it?

247
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,856
My men could not find hay in a haystack
,

248
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:54,903
but you have experience and motivation.

249
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,906
But there is more.

250
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:06,623
Do you know who I was?

251
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,709
A nobody.

252
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,963
Worked at the gas station half time.

253
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:16,008
Not want to be in charge of anything.

254
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,760
Then came the Day

255
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:22,055
learned something of myself.

256
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:26,143
That would not be
victim of anyone.

257
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,811
I killed many men

258
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,231
who thought they could
rob me and harassing me.

259
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,109
Suddenly
half the village was gone,

260
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,739
half sought my leadership

261
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,909
so I gave it.

262
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,038
You see, some want to relive
as before,

263
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,875
not just survive.

264
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:54,880
I can not afford to think
prophets and miracles,

265
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,091
but I'm not blind.

266
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,843
I have seen unexplainable things.

267
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:04,139
This
Pastor... We found their tracks and camps;

268
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,142
But it's like chasing a ghost.

269
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,938
Some believe it is a genuine saint,

270
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:17,053
and that only a man of faith
can find it.

271
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:22,658
So you think I can find
because I have faith?

272
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:27,037
Find the Pastor and find Grace
,

273
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,790
so will save the girl.

274
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:33,627
O
stay to hang morning.

275
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:36,672
You decide.

276
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,722
're Lucky, jockey.

277
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,683
Next time I'll break it in half.

278
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,644
There you go, with gas and oil.

279
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:53,313
It's a beauty.

280
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,732
80 miles west.

281
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,652
Know that using this corridor

282
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,821
Christians to smuggle refugees

283
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,574
crossing the border into Canada.

284
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:10,581
Will return to the doctor.

285
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,082
Do not let her die.

286
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,169
Up to you.

287
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,809
Are you sure of what you do?

288
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,311
The perfect man for the job

289
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,689
appears at the right time...

290
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:39,651
's something I can not ignore.

291
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,198
Do you see me face religious?

292
00:23:56,728 --> 00:24:00,816
They took no gasoline,
meat only.

293
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,703
Hello.

294
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,001
Hey!

295
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,170
Hey!

296
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:24,006
Josh, let me out!

297
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,841
Are you kidding?

298
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,807
See?

299
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:38,228
Sheriff? What it does

300
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,361
Mr. Drake, why
takes our supplies?

301
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,239
She is an outsider. We care
ours first.

302
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:50,949
But it die.

303
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,451
How is the signal?

304
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:54,328
The satellite is online.
We're on the move.

305
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,997
We have a problem.
Sofia is not.

306
00:24:57,206 --> 00:25:00,542
Not find her anywhere.

307
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,128
Been slope of self
at all times?

308
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,130
Yes, of course.

309
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:11,094
Well, maybe not all the time,
now that I think about.

310
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,849
She ruined everything.

311
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,398
Come on!

312
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,110
Is not funny.
Me out.

313
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,198
Sorry, yes?

314
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,492
Come on.

315
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,629
I know this looks bad,
but you do not understand.

316
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,246
Not know how he is.

317
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,956
I am your prisoner,

318
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,457
my mother until he fled.

319
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,085
Had tried to leave,
but they would not let me.

320
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,129
Were my only way out.

321
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,966
Sorry, yes?

322
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,343
What are you doing?

323
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,472
Have enough gasoline to you back to town.

324
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,140
What!

325
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,434
16 km over there.
Do not follow me.

326
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:01,436
Can not you hear me?

327
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,898
I will not return.
I have to find her.

328
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,400
I must find her.

329
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,068
Do not do this.
Do not trust him.

330
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,611
Not know how it is.

331
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,280
Josh!

332
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,574
Do not leave me here alone!

333
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,076
Come on!

334
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,227
Away from me!

335
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,525
Anda, silly, surround it!

336
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,902
Ay! I cut it!

337
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,570
Do not take my baby.

338
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,993
Back!

339
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,296
Always works.

340
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:53,215
Gave me really, Ellie.

341
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,385
Well it had to be real, right?

342
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,220
Truth, Lord?

343
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,973
Ay! My nose!

344
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,228
Dwayne!

345
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,249
Súbanlo.

346
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,004
Go!

347
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:35,507
Look how auto, Bobby!
Can I stay with him?

348
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,342
Bobby McCallister.

349
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,678
What would Mom?

350
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,264
Take only what you need.

351
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,184
Go! At least one lap.

352
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,102
You can drive it home.

353
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,979
But it sell to Honcho.

354
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:51,440
Do you understand?

355
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,990
Fever.

356
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:03,160
Not last three days.

357
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:04,661
What We Do

358
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,371
I do not know.

359
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,081
For payment we accept that man!

360
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,042
We must do something!

361
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:20,302
What are you doing? Someone will see it.

362
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,097
I do not care.

363
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:28,519
I do not care.

364
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,162
Johnny, where are you going?

365
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,081
The people, Mom.

366
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,083
Should I make a delivery.

367
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,794
Where is your brother?

368
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:57,214
Is back today with prey.

369
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:01,051
Yuck! I ate meat.

370
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:28,120
Oh, good.

371
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:49,183
Are not you going to cry?

372
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,727
To beg for your life?

373
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:55,564
Not among my priorities for today.

374
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,193
Do not know where to find

375
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:02,321
Pastor, do you?

376
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:07,576
Do not say that name under my roof.

377
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,745
We brought ruin.

378
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:11,538
's What he promised:

379
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:15,459
Hell and damnation if we arrepentíamos.

380
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,420
But I will not deceive me.

381
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:23,592
Not a prophet;
Is a demon.

382
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:29,389
But do you know where I can find?

383
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,437
Mom wants to experiment with new flavors.

384
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:39,149
I've told that
not work here;

385
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:43,821
But your car is worth 10 times
what your flesh.

386
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,408
Bobby! Someone came!

387
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:50,285
I'm coming, Mom.

388
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,287
I'm coming.

389
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:55,499
Hey.

390
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:02,840
Fast food, refreshments.

391
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:07,469
This place sucks.

392
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:11,515
Chocolates, whipped cream.

393
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,225
What?

394
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,936
No longer exist and never will.

395
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:20,816
These farmers scare me.

396
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,236
Why do not we kill
and we took the car?

397
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:27,322
In my country we learn soon

398
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:30,242
you can not get money
the dead.

399
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,327
Hey, one of these days you tell me

400
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:34,746
where you are, right?

401
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:40,895
Hey! None of your business
where I am!

402
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,428
Hello, gentlemen.

403
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:55,517
Josh?

404
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,561
Josh!

405
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,439
I told you not to follow me.

406
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,858
Well, if you want to be dinner,
for me is fine.

407
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,651
I go.

408
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,529
Okay. Find the key.

409
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,364
Good.

410
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,370
Watch.

411
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,714
Great.

412
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,262
Quiet.

413
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:35,516
There are so many.

414
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,309
Just focus.

415
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,686
Easy for you to say.

416
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:06,713
Bobby, when will be ready
my ribs?

417
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:10,425
Mom Soon... very soon.

418
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,852
Is not here!

419
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,563
There must be another key.

420
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,398
I seek.

421
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:53,343
Sofia!
Josh!

422
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,515
Josh!

423
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:01,935
Josh!

424
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,509
Are you okay?

425
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,638
More or less.

426
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:43,393
You should kill them.
We cause problems.

427
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:45,020
Toma.

428
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:46,688
Do not you want?

429
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:48,398
No.

430
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,442
Okay.

431
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:54,404
My car was sold to a man named
Honcho.

432
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,698
Is the head of a clearing.

433
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,200
Do you know him?

434
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,411
Yes, I know. Charming.

435
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,080
Where is?

436
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:07,543
Are we going to walk?
It lies 48 kilometers from here.

437
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:10,629
This appears.

438
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:13,173
So we're a team?

439
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,883
We'll see.

440
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,219
Way?

441
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,054
Over there.

442
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,431
Hey, Josh.

443
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,933
Yes?

444
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:24,893
I think I'll stop eating meat.

445
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:26,812
Yeah, me too.

446
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:03,265
What good car, man.

447
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,934
Hey, back!

448
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,270
If you touch these tires
without my permission

449
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:14,552
Skin you alive and be food for my pigs.

450
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,280
Back, ago.

451
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,760
'm Not sure what happened here.

452
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:45,307
It is seen that there was a fight.

453
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:46,975
Where do we go now?

454
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:49,645
Piece of junk ULC.

455
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:53,774
No, no, no, returns!

456
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:55,943
That, friends again.

457
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,611
Where is?

458
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:00,572
Well, is no longer
on the farm of McCallister.

459
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:03,909
Think I went looking for Honcho.

460
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,119
The clearinghouse?

461
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,081
Going down the wrong path.

462
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,999
Go to the clearinghouse.

463
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:14,545
And if Sophia is with him,
get rid of it.

464
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,046
Separate them.

465
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:17,923
How this all about?

466
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:19,811
Think you can find the type Pastor

467
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:22,636
because he has faith and
she will give you bad luck?

468
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,179
Just do what I say.

469
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:26,849
I told you I can find it.

470
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:28,684
Not need this rider.

471
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:32,563
's Been five months
and still can not find it.

472
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:51,206
Johnny! Johnny, are you?

473
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:52,916
Yes, Mom.

474
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,626
We ambushed, Johnny.

475
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:58,881
Go help your brother!
It's in the barn!

476
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,100
Hardly speak.

477
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,188
What is your story?

478
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:18,275
I had not met a traveler
that was not a jerk.

479
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,199
So, tell me.

480
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,993
You lost someone in the Day?
Family?

481
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,703
Probably.

482
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:33,707
All lost someone.

483
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:39,788
My wife, my daughter.

484
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:42,716
Were saved.

485
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,177
Sorry.

486
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:50,682
Although I guess is good, right,
because they are in Heaven.

487
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:59,733
Can you teach me to
believe what you believe?

488
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:04,029
As a child never went to church.

489
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:07,115
My mother thought it was a waste of time.

490
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:10,452
We were not interested.

491
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:13,288
How things change, right?

492
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,166
What?

493
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,960
What?

494
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:19,670
Ven.

495
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:22,005
Were not clean,
I had to.

496
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:24,842
Do not you understand?

497
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,718
Where are you?

498
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,346
I do not find you.

499
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,266
Please, please!

500
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,309
My Shepherd.

501
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:35,978
Pastor.

502
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:39,314
My Shepherd.

503
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,317
Hey!

504
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:44,027
Stay behind.

505
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,737
The'll cut.

506
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,239
I will not hurt you.

507
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,949
That they all say.

508
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:50,598
I'm looking to Pastor,
myself.

509
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,161
Do you know him?

510
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:53,829
Yes

511
00:40:54,037 --> 00:41:00,002
I found it and walked with him,
and then one night I left.

512
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,087
When I tried to go back, I could not,

513
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,797
I could not return.

514
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,299
I can not control it.

515
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:08,010
The devil,
the devil is in my brain

516
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:09,720
and I can not get it out.

517
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:11,221
I can not get it out.

518
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,223
Tells me to do things.

519
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:16,810
Should not die,
not that way!

520
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:18,979
's Crazy.

521
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:22,858
Can you help me find it?

522
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,401
I do not think let me find it.

523
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,403
I do not think... will not let me find him.

524
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,530
Going to burn, gonna burn, will...

525
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:30,199
Listen.

526
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,534
Jesus is for you.

527
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,953
He loves you.

528
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:39,416
He will forgive you.

529
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,877
Listen to me, okay.

530
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:46,882
Mira.

531
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,383
The've got, you got it.

532
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,053
Yes, yes.

533
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:56,934
You the give away, but
would you help me find it?

534
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,271
Yes

535
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,524
But
how I will help you find it?

536
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:07,486
Look, here, here.

537
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,906
Only points on the map.

538
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:15,035
Notes on the map where you saw last time.

539
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,246
Just calm down.

540
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:20,082
This is where I lost it.

541
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,583
Here you see him last?

542
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:23,418
Yes, here.

543
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:25,128
I found it, I found it.

544
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:27,965
Okay, here.

545
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:29,466
Here.

546
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,177
Take it.

547
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,142
Jesus, forgive me.

548
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:40,978
Run!

549
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:47,151
Are McCallister.

550
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,153
You should kill them!

551
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,030
They escape, come on.

552
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:59,496
Why let him live?
You saw what they are.

553
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:02,916
Come here, my friends!

554
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:07,838
Never killed a man
if I have no choice.

555
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,381
And almost always there.

556
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,216
Crouch.

557
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:13,260
Is that what it says your book?

558
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:14,970
No, that's what I say.

559
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,597
What?

560
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:20,142
We are friendly!

561
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:23,604
Have you invented that rule?

562
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,314
Is it serious?

563
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:27,316
Want to kill us, take it.

564
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:29,026
I do not need.

565
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,527
What?

566
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:32,237
This is the plan.

567
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:33,947
I'll draw them.

568
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:36,492
Then, count to ten,
and runs into the house.

569
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:39,161
Do not leave until ready for you.

570
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:41,997
Wait, no. Josh!

571
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,959
One,

572
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,587
I see. Why are you running?

573
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:54,960
Three, four, five, six,

574
00:43:55,469 --> 00:44:00,140
seven, eight, nine, ten.

575
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,611
Hello?

576
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,032
Hello?

577
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:23,539
Hello? Is there anybody home?

578
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:32,631
Hello?

579
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:35,384
's Going to find.

580
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:37,052
They went by.

581
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:38,554
I saw separated.

582
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:41,557
The two, shut up.
Look carefully.

583
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,398
I see!

584
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,405
Stop!

585
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:59,116
Is not it!

586
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,961
What's up?

587
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,422
Thinks it's clever.

588
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,592
Where's Johnny?

589
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:22,306
Hello?

590
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,288
Johnny, Johnny, what happened?

591
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,169
I took my gun.

592
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,087
Look!

593
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:56,632
I do not like this, Bobby.

594
00:45:57,049 --> 00:46:01,512
Maybe we should let it go.

595
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:03,472
That's what he wants,

596
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,476
meat but just like everyone else.

597
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:11,563
We're going to find
and your wife too!

598
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:14,691
I had the opportunity to kill
and I did not.

599
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,610
Go away.

600
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,614
Not scare us!
You were lucky!

601
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:22,366
It's not luck.

602
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:24,576
Over here!
Bobby...

603
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:47,474
Sorry, there
knew there was someone here.

604
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:50,143
Okay, dear.

605
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:52,521
It's nice to see a friendly face.

606
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,648
I do not get very often visits.

607
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:58,110
Listen, get off
to your basement and hide.

608
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:00,529
Hiding? What is happening?

609
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:22,384
There are people in the forest
who wants to kill us.

610
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:24,094
Can you hear them?

611
00:47:24,303 --> 00:47:27,347
That does not worry me.

612
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:30,434
Young people always fighting.

613
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:32,728
Love how the trees in the winter look.

614
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:34,438
Do not they look beautiful?

615
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:38,442
Come on, we have to hide.

616
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,569
Okay.

617
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:42,237
How is it called?

618
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:43,739
Beatrice.

619
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:45,449
I say Aunt Bea,

620
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:48,202
but never married.

621
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:51,455
Maybe I regret not having children.

622
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:53,832
I was a midwife, you know.

623
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:58,837
Saw many babies die in childbirth,
guess I removed the idea.

624
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:03,383
The Good Lord is the only husband I needed.

625
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:18,190
Aunt Bea?

626
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:23,362
Hi, do you know?

627
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,572
It's nice to see a friendly face.

628
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:28,700
I do not get very often visits.

629
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,619
How do I...?

630
00:48:30,828 --> 00:48:32,287
Why are you still here?

631
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:35,582
Do not you hear call you?

632
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,501
Who?

633
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:41,547
Jesus.

634
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:43,632
I do not think. I do not know.

635
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:45,634
Do not you know?

636
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:48,303
Well, you better start listening.

637
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:50,222
It's almost time.

638
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,433
What does it mean?
Time for what?

639
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:56,645
What? The end.

640
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:22,671
Tell me, how do I hear?

641
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,300
If you want, you will hear.

642
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:28,343
Jesus is the door.

643
00:49:28,552 --> 00:49:33,015
Whoever enters through Him
be saved.

644
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,934
I do not understand.

645
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,853
Do not understand me, girl?

646
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:40,230
Do not you know your verses?

647
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:46,329
All in the Bible,
in the Good Book.

648
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:51,241
Lord I'm coming, I hear you.

649
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,703
I love how it smells
the forest in the winter.

650
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:57,623
Does not she look beautiful?

651
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:30,572
Sofia? Sofia!

652
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:33,575
Josh!

653
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:41,750
Sofia!

654
00:50:53,637 --> 00:50:55,639
Okay.

655
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:05,482
Okay.

656
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,070
Okay.

657
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:42,561
The vehicle is here.

658
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:45,481
I see neither the rider nor Sofia.

659
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,357
What do you want?

660
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:49,109
The owner of this vehicle,
where is it?

661
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:50,986
Well, what you're seeing.

662
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,654
Where did you get?

663
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,157
Previous owner,
is he still alive?

664
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:56,992
I'm not saying anything.

665
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,369
I want to talk to him.

666
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:02,831
Listen, parasite,
allow you to do your business

667
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,541
because you serve a purpose.

668
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,793
Now serves your purpose.

669
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:09,129
Listen,

670
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:10,839
This is my world.

671
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:13,091
You you hide behind your walls

672
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:14,968
but are free men here.

673
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,554
Yes!

674
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,723
Do not be stupid.

675
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:25,103
No gasoline you are nothing,
'd finished.

676
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:28,774
Then maybe longer
allow your boys come to here.

677
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:32,110
No more games, more fun.

678
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:34,530
I do not think you want that.

679
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:37,032
What is it worth to you?

680
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,409
Two barrels.

681
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:40,911
Done.

682
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,539
I should have asked for more.

683
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:45,040
Okay, I'll be honest,

684
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:48,043
I bought this car
the crazy farm.

685
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,213
That's it.
Go and talk to them.

686
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:55,133
Come, let's party.

687
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:57,177
Yes!

688
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:58,887
Where, boss?

689
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:01,640
Farm?

690
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:05,227
No, no, he's still alive.

691
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:09,189
The McCallister would have taken more.

692
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:12,734
Still alive and will come by your self.

693
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,570
Do you still have your man there?

694
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:18,907
Yes, and do what you say
for the right price.

695
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:20,951
Well, get away a bit.

696
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,661
Not want a battle.

697
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:26,081
Give your man cell
and ask him to watch the car.

698
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:32,146
If Sofia is with Josh,
make sure you do not go with him.

699
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:36,592
Kill it if you must.

700
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,941
Was so fast.

701
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,069
I pulled the trigger and was dead.

702
00:53:56,278 --> 00:54:02,242
Very fast, very easy.

703
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:07,956
When you have a gun
not consider other options.

704
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:11,835
Yes

705
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:17,257
Is that all? No longer can I,
you know, go to heaven.

706
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:21,929
Do not kill, right?

707
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:26,141
Jesus is the way to heaven.

708
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:28,977
Is the only way.

709
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:35,609
Turn the other cheek.

710
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:38,028
He said that, right?

711
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:39,738
Yes

712
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:42,908
What if someone wants to kill you?

713
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:45,577
Still causes me load it.

714
00:54:45,786 --> 00:54:49,706
ABCs seems that one has no choice,

715
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:52,251
fight or die

716
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:58,298
but when you have faith,
when you believe in truth

717
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:00,843
there is always an option.

718
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,679
Death is not the end

719
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:06,181
Are not you afraid of death?

720
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:08,934
No.

721
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:13,021
know I'm going to a better place.

722
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,025
Should not be difficult.

723
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,701
Why does God allow
it all happen?

724
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:32,207
How can
allow suffering?

725
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:36,253
But now we see the truth.

726
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:41,925
Now that your hand is gone,
His light, His love,

727
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:49,224
see how the world without Him.

728
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:55,590
Nothing to curb selfishness, evil.

729
00:55:56,398 --> 00:56:00,360
But if you know
you're going to a good place,

730
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:05,073
why do you still fighting?

731
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:08,118
For you.

732
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:13,832
For those who are outside,
there is still a chance.

733
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,876
I can help.

734
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:20,130
Can I help you find the door.

735
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:24,384
And so worth fighting.

736
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:43,654
're A good man.

737
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:50,778
I almost forgot how
is a good man.

738
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:55,332
Maybe you're the last one left.

739
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:10,347
Josh?

740
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:12,808
Josh is not here, dear.

741
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:14,309
Where is?

742
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:16,979
Outside, looking for help.

743
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,439
Keep fighting,
going to succeed.

744
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:21,817
I'm praying for you.

745
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:23,318
Pray for Josh.

746
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:25,696
Josh can take care of himself.
Rest.

747
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:28,073
Not understand.

748
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:31,285
He... is important.

749
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:34,288
Going to do something.

750
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:35,998
What will you do?

751
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:40,252
One man told me that Josh will do...

752
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,421
can not remember.

753
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:47,092
Maybe it was just a dream.

754
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:51,763
Showed me a hammer,

755
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:56,185
a witness, a white man,

756
00:57:56,393 --> 00:58:01,440
a city moving,
a broken spear

757
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:07,529
a golden bridge, fire endless

758
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:10,491
a throne of light.

759
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:26,006
Many people deny the Day,
say that did not happen,

760
00:58:26,215 --> 00:58:29,927
was a solar flare or something.

761
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:31,887
Are we supposed to even talk about it
,

762
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:36,266
especially if the ULC
are nearby.

763
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:41,855
But I'm no fool;
I know what I saw.

764
00:58:42,064 --> 00:58:46,276
Was in Denver,
at a music festival

765
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:48,153
y were thousands of people there,

766
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:51,114
and had to close the street.

767
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:55,911
Was on a double date with Brian
, my boyfriend,

768
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:59,122
And my mom and her new friend.

769
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:01,250
I forget his name.

770
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:06,421
Suddenly
a light filled the sky.

771
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,384
First we thought it was part of the show,

772
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:14,429
but then realized
it was something different.

773
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:20,394
He moved through you,
knew every part of you.

774
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:28,277
Then we heard a sound,
as a pump or an earthquake,

775
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:31,280
people panicked, ran
everywhere.

776
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:35,576
It was crazy.

777
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:41,916
That was the first time
I saw someone die,

778
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:49,339
but then I saw them.

779
00:59:49,548 --> 00:59:53,177
People who shone brightly from within,

780
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:54,928
but were not afraid.

781
00:59:55,137 --> 01:00:01,018
Vanished in light
and flew.

782
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:09,276
What about you?

783
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:14,031
Where were you on the Day?

784
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:17,493
A small village.

785
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:20,120
I had trouble with a gang of motorcyclists

786
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,997
and killed several.

787
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:27,961
Not a day passes without
anyone wants to kill you?

788
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:33,926
One day after I met the Lord,
a little late.

789
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:42,392
Teach me, please.

790
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:44,978
I'm not the guy you want.

791
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:46,563
Perhaps the Pastor can...

792
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,399
But I'm asking you.

793
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:56,990
I tell you what it says here,

794
01:00:57,241 --> 01:01:01,328
but up to you to believe.

795
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:07,293
What does it say?

796
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:12,339
Well, Jesus is speaking,
here says:

797
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:15,425
I am the way, the truth, and the life;

798
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:19,054
No one comes to the Father but by me.

799
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:22,975
Yes, but I do not understand.

800
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,018
Want you to start from the beginning.

801
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:29,648
Can you teach it?

802
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:31,358
Okay.

803
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:36,697
In the beginning God created the heavens and
earth.

804
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:40,951
The earth was without form and void.

805
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:50,377
What you must remember is that
salvation can not be bought

806
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:55,549
or gained like a prize.

807
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:57,593
Is a relationship.

808
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:01,054
It is through faith, through devotion
,

809
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:02,663
for his sacrificial blood on the cross

810
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:07,269
opened the door of Heaven.

811
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:12,774
But we have to accept it.

812
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:15,986
I resisted for a long time,

813
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:20,157
not think
He could love someone like me.

814
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:22,201
No, believed that He would die
for someone like me,

815
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:26,121
did the things I did.

816
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:29,750
But I was wrong.

817
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:34,755
He can do and did.

818
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,761
Does it make sense what I mean?

819
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:43,639
More than you think.

820
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:47,476
Arrived.

821
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:49,561
Stay close to me.

822
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:33,063
Already arrived.

823
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:44,533
Take off from here, cockroaches!

824
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:58,839
OMG.

825
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:01,633
're The girl from Drake.

826
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:05,304
What do you do outside the reserve,
honey?

827
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:07,723
Quiet, come with me.

828
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,727
Hey idiots, stop him!

829
01:04:12,144 --> 01:04:13,520
're In trouble, man.

830
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:16,148
Now you loaded it, huh?

831
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,496
My turn!

832
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:33,749
What I have!

833
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:35,584
Péguenle, péguenle!

834
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,377
Yes, yes!

835
01:04:41,173 --> 01:04:43,759
Wait. I want to see this.

836
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:50,349
It's mine!

837
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:53,894
Get out!

838
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:14,790
Hey, why come
and ruin my party?

839
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:16,500
'd Have to stick a bullet.

840
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:18,210
Is my car.

841
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:20,458
Correction is my car.
Whoever finds it is.

842
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:21,948
You want it, you have to cambiármelo.

843
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:23,590
It was stolen.

844
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,509
I have nothing to change you.

845
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:27,511
But you have.

846
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:29,513
Yes you have.

847
01:05:29,721 --> 01:05:33,684
Here is a good merchandise.

848
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:35,853
I pay well for it

849
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,563
in the territories of the king.

850
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:39,273
I'm not for sale.

851
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:40,774
Well then, it's over.

852
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:43,485
No deal, goodbye, goodbye.

853
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:45,779
O, unless...

854
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:48,490
Unless what?

855
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:52,327
Well, you're a good fighter

856
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:56,582
y Honcho knows how to make money.

857
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,630
Men and free women from border areas,

858
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:07,301
games are about to begin!

859
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:18,479
Each champion
will fight until only one remains.

860
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:25,652
A man who once killed a polar bear
with his hands.

861
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:28,697
Mamut!

862
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:34,536
Scourge of the Pacific Rim,
the Destroyer!

863
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:37,831
The Revientapanzas!

864
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,001
The Ripper!

865
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:45,923
And finally,
the latest challenger

866
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:51,970
The Black Rider!

867
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:01,438
Okay, whatever,
place your bets!

868
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:15,744
So what do you think
competition?

869
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:18,914
Do you think you can beat them?

870
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:20,624
Your accent Where did he go?

871
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,377
That's just for show.

872
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:24,920
I get well, right?

873
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:26,630
Yes, I guess.

874
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:28,340
No, it's great.

875
01:07:28,549 --> 01:07:30,759
Look, I was a professor of Theatre

876
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:34,054
at the Center for
Advanced Studies St. Charles.

877
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:37,975
An accent makes me mysterious, dangerous.

878
01:07:38,392 --> 01:07:42,771
I have a good feeling about
you and me working together.

879
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:45,440
I just want this over with
and go away.

880
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:47,442
Where
you have to go so fast?

881
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:48,944
You can make a fortune.

882
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:51,697
Look, I handle everything.

883
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:53,407
A girl is dying

884
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:55,909
and you do not waste my time
with your games.

885
01:07:56,118 --> 01:07:59,830
Am looking for a PhD, Sofia
mom.

886
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:01,957
Grace?
Thought I was dead.

887
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:03,667
Who told you that?

888
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:05,377
O disappeared, do not know.

889
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:06,879
Who am I,
the gossip of the village?

890
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:08,922
Ya win him these fools.

891
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:10,966
Well, no more bets.

892
01:08:17,389 --> 01:08:19,808
The first fight will

893
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:24,688
The Black Rider compared to Revientapanzas!

894
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:38,368
Y... Him Fight!

895
01:08:43,165 --> 01:08:46,001
Oh, come on!
Get Up!

896
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:52,166
And the winner by knockout,
the Black Rider!

897
01:09:03,018 --> 01:09:05,854
Y... Him Fight!

898
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:14,905
And the winner is the Black Rider.

899
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:35,592
And the winner is Black Rider!

900
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:54,695
And the winner is Black Rider!

901
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:57,614
Black Rider!

902
01:09:57,823 --> 01:09:59,241
Your new champion...

903
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,835
Wait, wait, wait.

904
01:10:10,043 --> 01:10:13,714
Been a stimulating day here
in the pit.

905
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:17,885
Some of you bet against fighter Honcho

906
01:10:18,093 --> 01:10:19,887
and now regret having done so,

907
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:23,724
but as our host
is so generous,

908
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:29,906
scheduled one more fight to
find their true champion.

909
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:32,733
An opportunity to regain your credit!

910
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:35,944
We had an agreement, Honcho!

911
01:10:36,153 --> 01:10:37,654
Still have it.

912
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:39,184
If you win the tournament, win the car
,

913
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:40,949
but the tournament is not over yet
brother.

914
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:44,244
Freeman and ladies
border areas

915
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:49,875
is the Black Rider
against the Beast!

916
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:02,679
Place your bets!

917
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:16,193
No more bets.

918
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:18,172
Beast, beast, beast, beast!

919
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,333
Hey, where do you think you're going?

920
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,043
We're done here.

921
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:39,753
No, no, no, we're just starting.

922
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:43,298
Hey, get off the car, man.

923
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,968
You can not leave without them.

924
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:58,692
Hey, what are you
standing there like idiots?

925
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:00,440
Go for it!

926
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,948
Oh, hey we move.

927
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:24,339
Oh, no, no, no.

928
01:14:24,756 --> 01:14:26,300
What?

929
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:28,385
We leaking fuel.

930
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:32,306
How far is
Pastor camp?

931
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:34,183
I do not know, nobody knows where it is.

932
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:36,268
Shot,
man put a mark on the map.

933
01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:38,187
Josh, the man was crazy.

934
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:39,980
Just look.

935
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:43,192
Remains as 32 miles away.

936
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:45,319
We fail to arrive.

937
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:57,873
Can you patch it?

938
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,460
No time.

939
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:03,462
Already come.

940
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:07,132
You did everything possible, Josh.

941
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:08,842
More than any other he had.

942
01:15:09,051 --> 01:15:11,345
No, it is not.

943
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,765
You were right, I got
limitations.

944
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:21,021
Josh, where did you get that?

945
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:22,856
Josh!

946
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:28,904
Josh,
there is always a better way.

947
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:31,073
Taught me that, and it's true.

948
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:35,285
Josh, you taught me to seek peace
,

949
01:15:35,494 --> 01:15:38,956
not to be afraid,
even death.

950
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:44,920
Violence, anger, revenge
, you turn away from Him.

951
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:47,381
You do not want to do this.

952
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:52,845
Josh, thanks to you I am a believer.

953
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:55,472
I believe Jesus died for us.

954
01:15:55,889 --> 01:16:00,352
I believe that He protects us and opens
way.

955
01:16:00,561 --> 01:16:03,230
You believe it too.

956
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:06,900
Do not lose your faith.

957
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,293
What is happening?

958
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:27,838
Why are not stopping?

959
01:16:28,046 --> 01:16:31,967
As if
could not even see us.

960
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:41,351
Would you like to meet the Pastor?

961
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,061
Yes

962
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:45,105
Yes, please.

963
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:47,232
Follow me.

964
01:16:48,358 --> 01:16:50,861
What about the car?

965
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:53,113
Everything will be provided.

966
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:56,283
Do not worry.

967
01:18:06,145 --> 01:18:08,147
Sister Martha.

968
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:11,567
Eat, drink, we have enough.

969
01:18:12,151 --> 01:18:14,695
Hmm, where did you get these?

970
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,572
Thought you were dead.

971
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:20,284
Hi, nice to meet you
, please.

972
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:30,210
What is going on here?

973
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:32,254
I do not know whether
to be happy or worried.

974
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:33,964
Rejoice.

975
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:36,592
So the Lord wants us to be.

976
01:18:36,758 --> 01:18:41,388
That was before,
and it will again.

977
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:57,321
Wow, this is amazing.

978
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,740
Are growing very well, but how?

979
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,993
're Back.

980
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:05,746
It seems
find what you were looking for.

981
01:19:06,163 --> 01:19:07,456
Welcome.

982
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:12,127
'm Raul,
mechanic here.

983
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:13,795
A word was stopped without saying

984
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:17,049
and wandered through the meadow.

985
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:20,010
We're used.

986
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:21,762
He is the Pastor.

987
01:19:22,179 --> 01:19:25,557
That's what they say, but for us
Bro. George.

988
01:19:25,766 --> 01:19:27,643
Always is should be.

989
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:29,770
I do not know how he knows, but he knows.

990
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:33,273
I do not know myself.

991
01:19:33,482 --> 01:19:38,320
I have Just a hunch of what I do, and I do.

992
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:41,490
This morning I read and prayed for guidance

993
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:45,118
to reach the coast.

994
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:49,373
Felt the sudden urge
to walk towards the highway

995
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:54,419
and there I found
Joshua brother and sister Sofia.

996
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:56,338
Know our names.

997
01:19:56,547 --> 01:19:58,382
You told me, right?

998
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:00,217
No.

999
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:06,140
Oh, I guess I know them well
no more.

1000
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:07,850
Brother Raul,

1001
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:11,687
please towed the car of
brother Josh to camp.

1002
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:15,315
I have a hunch.
Eh.

1003
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:17,484
George?

1004
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,613
Can you help me kill?

1005
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:23,323
I've tried everything.

1006
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:25,784
's Dying.

1007
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:29,580
Okay, come back later.

1008
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:36,837
Sorry.

1009
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:38,612
Probably have many questions.

1010
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:42,468
Yes, my mother, Grace,
are here?

1011
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:44,761
Grace?

1012
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:47,181
No one here by that name.

1013
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:49,641
How?
Eh, no.

1014
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:52,644
No, no, that's impossible.

1015
01:20:52,853 --> 01:20:54,438
It seems to me,
is my height.

1016
01:20:54,646 --> 01:20:57,316
It has 60-odd years.
's Doctor.

1017
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:59,610
I know all my people.

1018
01:20:59,818 --> 01:21:02,571
She is not here.

1019
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,865
What is this?

1020
01:21:05,282 --> 01:21:07,743
What do you want?
What would you pay?

1021
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,880
She is here.
We heard it was here.

1022
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:13,207
Need it.
The life of a child is in danger.

1023
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,375
Sorry.

1024
01:21:15,584 --> 01:21:18,170
Someone told them that she was here?

1025
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:20,506
Who was it?

1026
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:23,509
Was it trustworthy?

1027
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,183
I do not think so.

1028
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:33,268
I do not understand.

1029
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:35,270
Why would I lie about this?

1030
01:21:35,437 --> 01:21:38,899
If not here, then where
is?

1031
01:21:48,242 --> 01:21:50,244
J... osh!

1032
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:52,913
Josh, look, look!

1033
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,290
What?

1034
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:00,295
That's impossible.

1035
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:03,423
How-how did that?

1036
01:22:03,632 --> 01:22:05,217
How did?

1037
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:08,303
Not really know.

1038
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:13,225
Pray for the sick things
to heal, and they do.

1039
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:17,312
Pray for little things to grow, and grow.

1040
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:22,317
Gold evil that
not approach, and will not come.

1041
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:24,611
Can you do that
by a person?

1042
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:26,405
Yes

1043
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:28,991
In the village one girl is dying.

1044
01:22:29,366 --> 01:22:31,326
Can you help?

1045
01:22:31,535 --> 01:22:34,830
Knew God had a reason for our meeting.

1046
01:22:34,997 --> 01:22:39,835
You need something from me
and I need something from you.

1047
01:22:40,252 --> 01:22:41,545
What do you need?

1048
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:44,006
Forgive me.

1049
01:22:44,381 --> 01:22:48,969
Excuse me, I must explain.

1050
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:50,804
I was in a coma.

1051
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:55,851
For a life of bad decisions
drugs, crime, prisons.

1052
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:58,312
I was not a nice man.

1053
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:04,519
Said he would not wake up,
but woke up that day

1054
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:09,573
Heard a voice and saw a light,

1055
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:15,370
a light
still there on the edge of my sight,

1056
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:19,041
a chorus that is always
pass over my ear,

1057
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:23,837
heat...

1058
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:28,926
I can almost feel when I reach.

1059
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:36,992
Since I woke up, the memories of my life
fade

1060
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:42,064
and are replaced with visions
wonderful Lord.

1061
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:45,818
People, Places, Travel

1062
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:50,572
wilds of different eras.

1063
01:23:50,781 --> 01:23:56,411
Saw the deserts of Egypt
like I was there.

1064
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:00,624
I saw the first temple in Jerusalem.

1065
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:03,961
Was like I was sitting at the table

1066
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:09,424
with Jesus and his disciples.

1067
01:24:09,633 --> 01:24:13,387
Remember their faces.

1068
01:24:13,595 --> 01:24:18,559
Be
languages I've never learned.

1069
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:22,729
I need your help to continue his call, Josh.

1070
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:27,860
I've been here helping people
best,

1071
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:29,778
waiting for what comes.

1072
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:34,783
And last week called
came again, desire.

1073
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:36,994
Must return to the Holy Land.

1074
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:41,498
There is another equally
out there somewhere I

1075
01:24:41,707 --> 01:24:43,917
and together we will meet in Jerusalem

1076
01:24:44,126 --> 01:24:50,007
and we will see what happens beyond.

1077
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:52,885
Do you want a ride
Middle East?

1078
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:57,973
No, only the coast.

1079
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:03,103
God will provide safe conduct from there.

1080
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,565
But you will pass through
the village before para-

1081
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:12,696
I doubt that will be
so simple, but I will.

1082
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:20,996
What time is it?

1083
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:24,041
It's almost sundown.

1084
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:25,876
I can not believe it.

1085
01:25:26,084 --> 01:25:28,378
How long were in there?

1086
01:25:28,587 --> 01:25:32,007
Time moves so rare
with brother George.

1087
01:25:32,174 --> 01:25:34,009
You get used.

1088
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:35,844
Have a leak.

1089
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:37,971
Not anymore.

1090
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:39,640
It became patched.

1091
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:41,183
It's a beauty.

1092
01:25:41,558 --> 01:25:43,143
I can look under the hood?

1093
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,853
Yeah, well you can.

1094
01:25:45,062 --> 01:25:46,782
If I had not seen it with my own eyes
,

1095
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:48,440
I would not have believed.

1096
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:49,942
Yes, I do not.

1097
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:52,027
Scripture does not say anything about this?

1098
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:55,656
Speaks of two witnesses in Revelation.

1099
01:25:55,864 --> 01:25:58,075
But actually
not specify who they are.

1100
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:01,036
Just who are prophets with the power of God.

1101
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:02,746
Says:

1102
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:04,873
are two olive trees and
two candlesticks standing

1103
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,709
before the Lord of the earth.

1104
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:09,711
Lord of the earth?

1105
01:26:09,878 --> 01:26:13,006
Satan, the devil.

1106
01:26:13,215 --> 01:26:16,093
Should preach to people,
the world

1107
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:18,470
and his words are like fire

1108
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:21,056
y
kill anyone who tries to harm them.

1109
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:24,810
And then the beast will rise up and destroy.

1110
01:26:25,018 --> 01:26:29,231
Man and
thought I had problems.

1111
01:26:31,817 --> 01:26:33,944
Are you okay?

1112
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:44,997
Sorry about your mother.

1113
01:26:45,205 --> 01:26:48,542
Just do not know if
is alive or dead.

1114
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:54,465
Your people will be.

1115
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:58,051
We knew this day would come.

1116
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:01,221
Do not worry,

1117
01:27:03,849 --> 01:27:06,602
Found this in your fender.

1118
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:09,104
What is it?

1119
01:27:10,814 --> 01:27:13,025
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

1120
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:17,904
He never wanted to come back
bring your mother.

1121
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:20,199
What are you saying?

1122
01:27:33,545 --> 01:27:35,088
Already arrived.

1123
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:38,509
Pastor.

1124
01:27:38,717 --> 01:27:40,552
Where is?

1125
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:42,137
Here I am.

1126
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:44,014
Violence is necessary.

1127
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:46,099
- What?
- I give up.

1128
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:47,643
No, you can not.

1129
01:27:47,851 --> 01:27:48,977
Is he?

1130
01:27:49,186 --> 01:27:51,772
Okay, brother Joshua,
is fine.

1131
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,607
's Him.

1132
01:27:55,734 --> 01:27:57,027
Get him to the truck.

1133
01:27:57,236 --> 01:27:58,837
He is not going to no
party with you!

1134
01:27:58,946 --> 01:28:00,531
Oh, shut up please!

1135
01:28:06,286 --> 01:28:09,998
Brother Joshua,
have faith in God's plan.

1136
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:17,673
Have faith in God's plan.

1137
01:28:17,881 --> 01:28:20,217
Have faith, faith in God's plan.

1138
01:28:20,634 --> 01:28:21,927
Record the building.

1139
01:28:22,136 --> 01:28:25,889
Kill anything that moves, starting with him.

1140
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:33,188
Call the ULC.

1141
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:37,109
I have
Tell them what they want.

1142
01:28:39,862 --> 01:28:41,780
No one was home,
is clear.

1143
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:44,158
Come on. Bring the car.

1144
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:45,993
Let's go!

1145
01:29:23,655 --> 01:29:26,241
Where is she?
Where is my mother?

1146
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:27,951
Hey, Abner!

1147
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,078
Here come your way.

1148
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:31,830
No one sleeps tonight.

1149
01:29:32,039 --> 01:29:34,416
No one gets in or out of here
for any reason.

1150
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:36,877
Do not take your eye off him.

1151
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:39,046
Nothing will happen.

1152
01:29:40,964 --> 01:29:42,382
Do not do this, please.

1153
01:29:42,758 --> 01:29:45,385
I've seen what he can do,
Abner is true.

1154
01:29:45,803 --> 01:29:47,095
It's not a trick.

1155
01:29:47,304 --> 01:29:50,307
You have to let go, please.

1156
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:54,645
Remember one girl who came
to my house to beg

1157
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:57,648
willing to do anything
looking for a place to live, food.

1158
01:29:57,856 --> 01:30:01,819
And I gave you a place to live,
you and your mother.

1159
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:04,321
So you thank me?

1160
01:30:04,738 --> 01:30:07,115
Where is she?

1161
01:30:07,324 --> 01:30:09,827
Are you still alive?

1162
01:30:11,829 --> 01:30:14,790
Will you return to normal?

1163
01:30:14,957 --> 01:30:18,293
Will you do what I tell you?

1164
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:26,844
The ULC surgeons needed after the war.

1165
01:30:27,052 --> 01:30:28,971
I sent them.

1166
01:30:29,138 --> 01:30:34,226
To my knowledge, still alive.

1167
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:38,021
Sorry, I lied.

1168
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:40,107
Was necessary.

1169
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,906
Joshua?

1170
01:30:49,158 --> 01:30:54,872
Joshua.

1171
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,749
I'm with you, Joshua.

1172
01:31:02,087 --> 01:31:03,464
How?

1173
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:07,468
How ES?

1174
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:12,473
Who are you?

1175
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:16,935
I know, Joshua.

1176
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:19,062
You, Lord.

1177
01:31:19,271 --> 01:31:20,898
Is not possible.

1178
01:31:21,106 --> 01:31:22,483
Your non

1179
01:31:22,858 --> 01:31:24,193
Says...

1180
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:25,861
Paz.

1181
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:29,114
Have not yet returned, this time
is yet to come.

1182
01:31:29,323 --> 01:31:30,908
You can help.

1183
01:31:31,116 --> 01:31:32,409
Can do anything.

1184
01:31:32,826 --> 01:31:38,332
Yes, but at the right time
and for the right reason.

1185
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:44,213
Pastor touched me and prayed for me.

1186
01:31:44,421 --> 01:31:46,298
Is it true that you can heal?

1187
01:31:46,507 --> 01:31:49,426
Only God can heal, Joshua.

1188
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:52,304
The witness is an instrument.

1189
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:54,306
By the hand of God through him
,

1190
01:31:54,515 --> 01:31:57,267
what seems impossible can be possible,

1191
01:31:57,476 --> 01:32:02,439
but the decision is yours.

1192
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:04,441
Do I have a choice?

1193
01:32:04,858 --> 01:32:08,445
There is always an alternative.

1194
01:32:08,862 --> 01:32:13,283
Means I podría-
back to them?

1195
01:32:13,492 --> 01:32:14,993
Rachel and...

1196
01:32:15,202 --> 01:32:19,414
And your daughter and her parents.

1197
01:32:19,581 --> 01:32:22,292
We are waiting.

1198
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:26,338
All you have to do is
hold my hand.

1199
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:38,851
But they need me here.

1200
01:32:39,059 --> 01:32:43,147
If I do not help them, how can they a-?

1201
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:46,024
Pastor, is part of your prophecy

1202
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:50,487
Son, fear not, the prophecies
will be fulfilled,

1203
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:52,906
one way or another.

1204
01:32:53,115 --> 01:32:57,244
A river is calm
the other is dangerous.

1205
01:32:57,452 --> 01:33:03,401
On a boat many will be saved;
At the other many will be lost.

1206
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:10,424
dye... May not want that responsibility.

1207
01:33:13,594 --> 01:33:17,222
I'm tired of fighting.

1208
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:18,932
Never enough,

1209
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:21,018
by everyone except, there are 100 that-

1210
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:27,183
matters a lot to that person.

1211
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:33,614
I matter to me.

1212
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:38,994
Tell me, Lord, what do I do?

1213
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:27,251
Someone comes.

1214
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:30,504
Ignore them. No one enters today.

1215
01:34:33,215 --> 01:34:34,925
Is not slowing down.

1216
01:34:56,738 --> 01:34:58,949
I do not like this.

1217
01:35:06,415 --> 01:35:08,083
GATE ALARMADE

1218
01:35:11,086 --> 01:35:12,713
How much longer?

1219
01:35:13,088 --> 01:35:16,008
Land like in 30 minutes.

1220
01:35:24,766 --> 01:35:28,729
One, Two, Three,

1221
01:35:29,104 --> 01:35:31,231
four, five,

1222
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,401
six, seven, eight.

1223
01:35:44,786 --> 01:35:46,413
Eddie?

1224
01:36:01,804 --> 01:36:05,516
This life is only temporary,
Mr. Drake, remember that.

1225
01:36:05,724 --> 01:36:07,768
<i>Do not store up for yourselves
treasures on eart</i>

1226
01:36:08,143 --> 01:36:09,783
<i>where moth and rust destroy,</i>

1227
01:36:10,145 --> 01:36:13,565
<i>and where thieves do not break
and rob</i>

1228
01:36:13,774 --> 01:36:16,401
<i>But lay up treasures in heaven</i>

1229
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:19,822
Shut up!

1230
01:36:20,197 --> 01:36:22,199
Shut up!

1231
01:36:30,165 --> 01:36:31,583
Hey, what's happening?

1232
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:34,378
Hey, come here, help me.

1233
01:36:34,586 --> 01:36:36,296
What happened?

1234
01:36:37,089 --> 01:36:38,382
Are you crazy?

1235
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:40,134
Drake sent me to the gallows.

1236
01:36:40,342 --> 01:36:41,677
Then I will.

1237
01:36:41,844 --> 01:36:44,304
Anything is better to see her die.

1238
01:36:44,513 --> 01:36:45,953
Molly not going to do
silly.

1239
01:36:46,223 --> 01:36:48,809
She is not one of us
. He is an outsider.

1240
01:36:50,727 --> 01:36:52,604
Josh, did you find Grace?

1241
01:36:52,813 --> 01:36:54,690
No, but I found someone
much better.

1242
01:36:55,107 --> 01:36:56,400
How are you?

1243
01:36:56,608 --> 01:36:58,110
Not feeling well.

1244
01:36:58,318 --> 01:36:59,679
What you're gonna do, do it fast.

1245
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,738
Wait.

1246
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,286
Do not let her die.

1247
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:15,461
Will arrive in 5 minutes.

1248
01:37:16,837 --> 01:37:18,672
's Time to go.

1249
01:37:18,881 --> 01:37:20,591
Prepare it.

1250
01:37:24,636 --> 01:37:27,473
Not me you're going to cause problems,
heard santón?

1251
01:37:27,681 --> 01:37:29,850
Not the kind of problems
you understand.

1252
01:37:42,905 --> 01:37:45,282
Chief, cut injectors.

1253
01:37:45,491 --> 01:37:46,812
It will take weeks to fix.

1254
01:37:47,201 --> 01:37:49,119
Drake!

1255
01:37:53,415 --> 01:37:54,750
McManus?

1256
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:56,752
You said you had commissioned him.

1257
01:37:56,919 --> 01:37:59,755
I gave two bullets in the chest.
Was dead.

1258
01:38:00,172 --> 01:38:01,465
Drop me Pastor.

1259
01:38:01,673 --> 01:38:03,675
Not seem so dead,
shoot!

1260
01:38:09,556 --> 01:38:10,849
Shoot!
Where is everyone?

1261
01:38:11,266 --> 01:38:13,602
No more support, Drake.
It's over!

1262
01:38:13,811 --> 01:38:15,395
Do you think this is over?

1263
01:38:15,604 --> 01:38:17,689
You have no idea who you're dealing.

1264
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:19,525
Come on.

1265
01:38:27,699 --> 01:38:29,660
Come on, move.

1266
01:38:29,868 --> 01:38:31,370
Abner, stop.

1267
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:33,247
Not worth what you are paying.

1268
01:38:33,455 --> 01:38:34,832
Please release it.

1269
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:39,253
Starts.

1270
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:40,754
Chief, is not yet ready.

1271
01:38:40,963 --> 01:38:43,382
Starts.
Mount using all.

1272
01:40:08,634 --> 01:40:10,260
Oh, gosh.

1273
01:40:36,036 --> 01:40:37,663
At the airfield.

1274
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,982
Are you okay?

1275
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:06,692
Yes, barely.

1276
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:08,777
Come on.

1277
01:41:13,532 --> 01:41:14,825
What are carrying the airfield.

1278
01:41:15,033 --> 01:41:18,704
Take this, thou forsake not.

1279
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:59,369
Abner, stop!
I can not let you do this!

1280
01:41:59,578 --> 01:42:00,871
I have no choice!

1281
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:02,706
Yes you have no choice!

1282
01:42:09,087 --> 01:42:12,549
I must... I must...

1283
01:42:12,758 --> 01:42:14,676
needed.

1284
01:42:21,683 --> 01:42:24,520
Keep your hands up.

1285
01:42:24,728 --> 01:42:27,689
I do not know who they are, but have no idea

1286
01:42:27,898 --> 01:42:29,483
what they are getting into.

1287
01:42:29,691 --> 01:42:34,404
I Do not deliver, neither today nor ever.

1288
01:42:34,613 --> 01:42:35,906
Reconsider.

1289
01:42:36,114 --> 01:42:37,616
We reward them well.

1290
01:42:37,825 --> 01:42:40,185
Are mistaken if they think they can
change the prophecies.

1291
01:42:40,202 --> 01:42:42,704
I do not know what you're talking about.

1292
01:42:46,917 --> 01:42:50,212
I suggest
seeking a deep hole to hide.

1293
01:42:50,587 --> 01:42:52,047
The President will hear of this.

1294
01:42:52,214 --> 01:42:54,842
You hear about you.

1295
01:43:17,114 --> 01:43:19,449
Is it improving?

1296
01:43:19,658 --> 01:43:23,996
's Dying.

1297
01:43:24,204 --> 01:43:25,998
It can not be.

1298
01:43:26,206 --> 01:43:31,670
You did me.
Why not upgrade?

1299
01:43:32,588 --> 01:43:34,590
I did everything I could.

1300
01:43:34,756 --> 01:43:39,678
As far as I understand,
else depends on Him.

1301
01:43:42,681 --> 01:43:45,225
He fought so hard for me.

1302
01:43:45,601 --> 01:43:48,604
My parents will miss me so much

1303
01:43:48,812 --> 01:43:50,898
and I miss you.

1304
01:43:51,106 --> 01:43:54,067
Must return.

1305
01:44:00,282 --> 01:44:03,076
But do not want to go back.

1306
01:44:03,285 --> 01:44:05,120
No.

1307
01:44:05,537 --> 01:44:07,956
I want to go with you, Lord.

1308
01:44:08,123 --> 01:44:11,043
Have a sweet spirit.

1309
01:44:11,251 --> 01:44:16,256
These latter times are tough times,

1310
01:44:16,632 --> 01:44:19,259
filled with sadness.

1311
01:44:19,676 --> 01:44:24,890
Are they good?

1312
01:44:25,098 --> 01:44:29,186
No more worries about the world
daughter.

1313
01:44:29,603 --> 01:44:32,523
Come with me.

1314
01:44:46,286 --> 01:44:49,790
I'm sorry.

1315
01:44:54,253 --> 01:44:55,963
I do not understand.

1316
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,970
I do not understand.

1317
01:45:46,096 --> 01:45:47,697
There is a captain with a freight ship

1318
01:45:47,806 --> 01:45:52,060
and willing to take us across.

1319
01:45:52,269 --> 01:45:54,813
Good.

1320
01:45:57,024 --> 01:46:00,736
No you're coming, right?

1321
01:46:00,944 --> 01:46:04,239
Could stay with me.

1322
01:46:04,656 --> 01:46:08,911
I would.

1323
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:11,705
But I have to do this.

1324
01:46:11,914 --> 01:46:13,957
I have to go there with him.

1325
01:46:14,166 --> 01:46:17,044
I want to be part of this.

1326
01:46:17,252 --> 01:46:19,713
Come with us.

1327
01:46:19,922 --> 01:46:25,803
Something tells me I should stay
and I think I should ignore.

1328
01:46:31,809 --> 01:46:34,728
Are you sure?

1329
01:46:34,937 --> 01:46:38,190
Stay with me.

1330
01:46:43,445 --> 01:46:45,948
I can not.

1331
01:46:46,156 --> 01:46:48,951
Be dangerous.

1332
01:46:57,126 --> 01:46:59,753
I am not afraid.

1333
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:27,489
Need something?

1334
01:47:30,993 --> 01:47:35,956
Josh McManus,
You're a hard man to find.

1335
01:47:38,959 --> 01:47:41,712
I need your help.
