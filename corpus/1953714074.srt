1
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,299
<i>Suspect is heading down</i>
<i>the back alley.</i>

2
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:35,234
<i>I'll try to intercept.</i>

3
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:38,804
[siren blaring]

4
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,146
Let me go!

5
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,113
[groaning]

6
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,554
- Get down!
- No! No!

7
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,824
Omar Reyes, you are under arrest
for the murder of Ed Perez.

8
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,692
You got the wrong guy!
Shut up, punk.

9
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,328
I was just protecting
my girlfriend.

10
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,164
Tell that to the judge.
Anything you say or do

11
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,099
may be used against you
in a court of law.

12
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,634
You have the right
to an attorney.

13
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:11,570
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

14
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,073
<i>We've apprehended suspect.</i>
<i>We're taking him in.</i>

15
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,374
<i>Copy that.</i>

16
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,844
Let's go.
[siren blaring]

17
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,580
Who's that?

18
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,283
No one.
Hmph. Didn't look
like no one.

19
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,685
So I was talking to Kimmy,
and she thinks

20
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,854
that we should get a horse
for the new stable.

21
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,756
Really. Is Kimmy
gonna pay for it?

22
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,425
No.
Mm.

23
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,461
Now, I know I can't get you
to sit, but you can eat.

24
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,364
Thank you.
And you are not
wearing that to school.

25
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,866
Why not?

26
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,202
Because you look like
you charge by the hour.

27
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,270
All right, Mom,
that's gross.
Exactly my point.

28
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,805
Now please go change.

29
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,907
Hey, are you
missing anything?

30
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,742
I don't think so.

31
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,748
Ten minutes.
We gotta go.

32
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,816
Okay.

33
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,520
[McKenzie]
Hi, Daddy.

34
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,323
[Paul]
Good morning.

35
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,326
Uh, she's not going
to school dressed
like that, is she?

36
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,995
Oh, my goodness, no.
I just sent her up to change.

37
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,998
I've got the craziest day.
I've got to get this
plea bargain worked out.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,335
And my old boss, the D.A.?
Don't do that!

39
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,437
Trying to back me
into a corner.

40
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,405
You're gonna be here
this afternoon, though, right?

41
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,641
We have the meetings
with the contractors
to get some quotes.

42
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,245
Oh, no. No, no,
no, no. Uh...

43
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,581
[sighs]
Don't worry about it.
I'll do it this weekend.

44
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,684
Honey, you work
all the time.
It's not happening.

45
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,554
I know you wanted to do
this yourself, but we
really have to hire someone.

46
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,955
We have
a deadline.

47
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,692
All right, fine.
We will.

48
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,594
But we might need
to hire someone
for you, too.

49
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,496
[scoffs]
Come on!

50
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,465
You can spend some time
with McKenzie,

51
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,833
you can get
some of your work done
at the hospital.

52
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,668
It'll be great
for you.
No.

53
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,503
I can't even think
about that right now.

54
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,840
I just want to stay focused
and-- Oh, hi. Good morning.

55
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,580
We need to finish the remodel.
The event is in two weeks.

56
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,816
This is a mess.
Please be here to meet
with me this afternoon.

57
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,886
Fine.
Fine.

58
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,022
Fine.
Fine. Go. Love you.

59
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,660
McKenzie! We gotta go!

60
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,034
You did not put that
lace mini dress on, did you?

61
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:11,843
[shutter clicks]

62
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,513
[shutter clicks]

63
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:17,883
[shutter clicks]

64
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,764
[Liz]
Followed by a keynote address

65
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,433
from our chief
of pediatric medicine.

66
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:37,369
You see, by focusing
our attention on outreach

67
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:40,505
as much as fundraising,
then we'll be able to tell
the people of our community

68
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,342
what Hope West Children's
Hospital really stands for.

69
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,445
And I just want to add,
thanks to Liz,

70
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,680
not only
do we have a new venue
for this year's event,

71
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,683
but we are on track
for our biggest
fundraiser year.

72
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,919
So, that's it.
Thank you so much
for coming.

73
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,121
And please don't forget
to take your packet
on your way out.

74
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,122
[Liz]
Thank you.

75
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,659
Hoo!
Wow!

76
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,061
Hey, the new house
is looking incredible.

77
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,464
Is there really
an indoor pool?

78
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,367
Yes, but let me tell you,
we got a great deal on it

79
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,503
because it was a short sale,
but there is still
so much work to be done.

80
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,106
I thought Paul
was doing it.
Ugh, he was.

81
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:17,709
But I think he's
finally realized he's bit off
a little more than he can chew.

82
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,112
I don't remember
the last time he was
home for dinner,

83
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,781
or a weekend he didn't
have to work through.

84
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,884
Well, I can't imagine it's
easy starting a new firm,

85
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,019
but, hey, at least he's not
on city payroll, right?

86
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,822
That's gotta be
an improvement.
Ooh, speaking of payroll.

87
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,127
I talked to Halligan.
Ed Halligan?

88
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,996
Apparently he's looking
for the right charity
to sink a few mill into.

89
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,665
You're kidding.
I told him
about the fundraiser,

90
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,401
and he said
he'll be there.

91
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,902
Seriously, if you
don't slow down,

92
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,737
they're gonna end up
naming a wing after you.

93
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,707
I don't care about my name
on the side of a building.

94
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,575
I just want
to make this happen.

95
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,811
And now all you have to do
is finish the house.

96
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,780
There's that.
[chuckles]

97
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,648
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
Okay. Thank you
for everything.

98
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,682
You're welcome.

99
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,959
[line ringing]

100
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,429
<i>Hi, you've reached Paul Chase.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>
<i>[sighs]</i>

101
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,164
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Hey, honey, it's me.</i>

102
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,199
I'm heading back to the house
to meet with a contractor.

103
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,735
<i>Remember Elliot?</i>
<i>He did Marilyn's kitchen.</i>

104
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,004
<i>I would really love it</i>
<i>if you could be there, okay?</i>

105
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,662
You know, this place has
got a lot of potential.

106
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,131
All you need is
a few choice upgrades.

107
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:23,235
For instance,
this island right here.

108
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:26,805
A little TLC, this could
become a real focal point
for the kitchen.

109
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,174
Like I did
for your friends.
Hmm.

110
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,610
You know, my husband's
been trying to do this
on his own,

111
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,613
but with his job,
there's just no way he has
enough time to finish it,

112
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,048
and we have
to get this done.
I understand, I understand.

113
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,783
Listen, I was wondering,

114
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,218
have you thought about
adding a wall there?

115
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,854
Create two separate
living room spaces?

116
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,624
No, no, I hadn't, but that's
actually a great idea.

117
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:49,060
What you need to focus on
is energy efficiency.

118
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,062
Those are the improvements
that'll pay for themselves
in the long run,

119
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,831
and they're great
for resale.

120
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,233
I'm thinking
tankless water heater,

121
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,968
all new
energy-efficient windows,

122
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,104
new HVAC system.

123
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,640
Have you ever
thought about solar?

124
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,875
I have thought
about solar.

125
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,811
Kitchens and bathrooms.
That's where you need
to spend your money.

126
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,282
We can manufacture granite,
replace the existing
kitchen countertops.

127
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,752
How do you feel
about heated tile floors
in the bathrooms?

128
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,154
I honestly don't know how
I feel about heated tile
in the bathroom.

129
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,700
Heated floors.

130
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:29,834
I know.

131
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,871
Ninety thousand.

132
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,573
Yeah.
A hundred thousand.

133
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,807
Hmm.

134
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,211
IHVA. What is--
What is this?

135
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,581
Uh, duh!

136
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,016
Hundred twenty thousand.

137
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,686
Okay, now you can see why I
wanted to do this by myself.

138
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,188
I know, I know.

139
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,158
That being said, you know,
Elliot did do a really nice job
on Marilyn's kitchen.

140
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,061
Yeah, and she
paid for it.

141
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,697
Maybe this is all too much.
Maybe I just change the venue.

142
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,333
I rethink the whole fundraiser.
We can do it somewhere--
No, no, no, no, no.

143
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,768
We're doing it here.
You want it here.
It's end of story.

144
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,272
We've already spent
so much on the house already.

145
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,274
All right, well, maybe we don't
need to reinvent the wheel.

146
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,310
Let's just have everything
that has been started finished.

147
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,847
Yeah.
I'll ask around.

148
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,749
[phone ringing]

149
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,984
Hold on.

150
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,785
[ringing]

151
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,954
Ah, it's partner.
I gotta take this.

152
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,191
Okay.
Hey, what'd
they say?

153
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,693
All right, all right, all right.
Let me just go to my office.

154
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,367
Make sure we get them to--

155
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,316
<i>[Paul] Yeah, trust me,</i>
<i>I know all the tricks</i>
<i>that work down at that office.</i>

156
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,352
<i>Hey, uh, can you help me out?</i>
<i>I'm looking for a contractor.</i>

157
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,988
<i>I need to have some work</i>
<i>done over at the house.</i>
<i>You know of anybody?</i>

158
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,257
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>taking care of it.</i>
<i>Yeah,</i>

159
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,394
I was gonna try to,
but Liz has this big event
coming up in a couple of weeks,

160
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,662
and she wants to get
everything done.

161
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,929
She's had
a couple of quotes done.

162
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,698
<i>Ninety thousand?</i>

163
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,100
<i>I was hoping to get it done</i>
<i>for more like forty.</i>

164
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,835
<i>Expensive,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

165
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,171
<i>We're putting ours off</i>
<i>until business picks up.</i>

166
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,707
Ah, well, thought it
was worth a try.

167
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,176
Hey, you're gonna call me after
you talk to the D.A., right?

168
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,145
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>All right, sounds good.</i>

169
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,294
<i>In addition to our</i>
<i>award-winning product design,</i>

170
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,363

173
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,436
<i>Mr. Chase, if you've taken</i>
<i>a look at our proposal,</i>

174
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,772
I hope you'll agree that you're
not going to find better design

175
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:52,010
<i>or higher quality</i>
<i>at this price point.</i>

176
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,279
<i>Mr. Chase,</i>
<i>are you still there?</i>

177
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,182
Yeah, yeah,
I'm still here. Um--

178
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,018
Yeah, you know what?
I think 50,000
is a little bit much.

179
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,755
Um, I'm not really
looking for anything Better
Homes and Gardens, but, uh--

180
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,857
<i>These figures are</i>
<i>very competitive.</i>
<i>Oh, I know, I know.</i>

181
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:09,227
It's just, uh, I was not
looking to spend that much.

182
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,396
<i>If you change your mind,</i>
<i>let me know.</i>
<i>All right. Yeah, thanks.</i>

183
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,295
Desert Sun Contracting.

184
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,498
Oh, hi, uh,
my name is Paul Chase.

185
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,867
I was looking to get
some remodeling work done,

186
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,269
and a friend of mine just sent
me the link to your website.

187
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,372
It really looks great.
You're doing great work.
<i>Thank you.</i>

188
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,007
The site was
my wife's idea.

189
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,209
She's always telling me
I gotta market myself better.

190
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,512
How can I help you,
Mr. Chase?
<i>My wife and I</i>

191
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:04,549
just bought a house,
and, uh, there was some work
that needed to be done,

192
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,885
and I was trying
to do it, but, uh...

193
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,821
You need someone to finish it.
I know. Happens all the time.

194
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,792
Exactly, and nothing too
complicated. We're looking for
countertops, a little tile work.

195
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:17,896
There is one catch, though.
My wife's got a big event
coming up in a couple of weeks.

196
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:21,065
Well, actually,
I'm starting a new job
over in Valencia on the 22nd.

197
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,802
So, uh, that'd be perfect.

198
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,538
Oh, fantastic. When can you
come by and look at the house?

199
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,339
Pretty much
anytime you'd like.

200
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,520
Hello? McKenzie?

201
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,195
Hello?

202
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,532
Hello?
[sighs]

203
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,437
Who are you?

204
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,840
Hi, babe.

205
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,141
This is Javier.
He's a contractor.

206
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,944
Oh. Hi. Sorry.

207
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:09,147
Would've been good if you
told me that 'cause you just
scared the hell out of me.

208
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,483
I'm so sorry. You've been
so busy, I just figured that
you wouldn't want to know.

209
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,452
I'm sorry.
My husband didn't
tell me you were coming.

210
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,154
No worries.
You must be Mrs. Chase.

211
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,322
I am.

212
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,357
Get you water? You?
Yeah.

213
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,491
No, I'm good. Thanks.

214
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,093
Lovely house
you have here.

215
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,428
Beautiful piece of property.

216
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,196
Thanks.
About three acres?

217
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,265
Oh, uh, five, actually.

218
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,033
Like I was telling
your husband,

219
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,269
generally the house
is in good shape.

220
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,304
Just need to concentrate
on the little things.

221
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,941
Finish the island,
put in a backsplash,

222
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,543
and lighting and electrical.
Right.

223
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,345
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

224
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:44,182
Should be about 40,000.
How's that sound?

225
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:47,652
That sounds great.
Fantastic.

226
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,455
Honey? Yes.
We'll talk.
We'll talk about it.

227
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:51,589
Yeah. Sounds good.
Okay.

228
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,358
[chuckling]

229
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,227
Wait, wait, wait.
My license.

230
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,363
Right. Oh, excellent.
Thank you very much.

231
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,199
[Paul]
Very good.
Thank you, sir.

232
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,371
[Paul]
So, did he look
familiar to you, or--

233
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,538
No.

234
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,540
I think he just
looks like someone.

235
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,309
Hmm.

236
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,511
So what do you think?

237
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:17,382
Uh...
It's fine, I guess.

238
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,218
Forty thousand.
That's half of what Marilyn
spent on her kitchen.

239
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,055
Yeah, I know. It's like half
of what everyone else quoted.
I don't know how he does that.

240
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,492
Well, he comes highly
recommended by Parker.

241
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,929
Well, if Parker liked him,
then he's fine by me.

242
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,098
Excellent!

243
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,400
I'll call him
in the morning.

244
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,435
Great.
Good night, sweetie.

245
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,037
Good night, hon.
Love you.

246
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,271
You, too.
Sleep well.

247
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,306
Thanks for finding him.

248
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,540
You're welcome.

249
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,490
[shutter clicking]

250
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,561
[shutter clicking]

251
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,253
[saw buzzing]

252
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:50,435
[saw buzzing]

253
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,346
Look, I know it's
her birthday, but I
think it's a bad idea.

254
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,549
You let me go
to camp every summer.

255
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,818
It's not even remotely
the same thing.

256
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,722
San Diego's too far,
and the 20th is my benefit,
and I really want you there.

257
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,792
[sighing]

258
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,794
I think I'll call it
a night, Mrs. Chase.

259
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,529
I'll see you
tomorrow.

260
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,665
Okay. Thank you, Javier.

261
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,433
Good night.

262
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,402
Remember what
I taught you.

263
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,571
<i>Buenas noches.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

264
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,507
You're gonna get
an "A" on that test.
Mark my words. Oh.

265
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,742
Here.

266
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,745
I found this
in the other room.

267
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,715
Thanks.

268
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,317
<i>Gracias.</i>

269
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,852
Good night.

270
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,420
Night.

271
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,755
I'm gonna tie that thing
around your neck.

272
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,358
Hey, Javier.
Working late?

273
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,860
Mm.
Hello.

274
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,661
[phone ringing]
Someone else is, too.

275
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,896
Really?

276
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,732
It's okay.

277
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,534
There's leftovers,

278
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,637
but I think it's
mostly cold by now.
Oh. Okay.

279
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,838
Where you going,
sweetie?

280
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,608
Uh, to finish
my homework.

281
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,410
All right. Well, then you're
gonna miss out on something
that you may want to hear.

282
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,778
We're moving back
to Sherman Oaks?

283
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,213
Ah, very funny.

284
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,748
Uh, if we did,

285
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,417
we would not be able
to keep him.

286
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,552
Him?

287
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,390
[gasps]
A horse?

288
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,825
[giggles]

289
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,427
Paul, we talked about this.
It's Charlie.

290
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,263
He's a Belgian
quarter horse.
Six years old.

291
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,864
He's apparently amazing.
Very sweet.

292
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,466
Wonderful with
first-time riders.

293
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,901
Thank you, Daddy.

294
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,235
You're welcome,
sweetie.

295
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,436
I love you.

296
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,806
Call your friends.

297
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,375
Hey, Kimmy,
guess what.

298
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:38,709
A horse!

299
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,344
It's Charlie.
Honey,

300
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,381
horses are really expensive
to maintain.

301
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:47,218
No, no. This is a rescue,
and we're just gonna house him.

302
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,321
We'll get some used tack,
and it'll be all good.

303
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,657
And, plus, it'll teach her
some responsibility.

304
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,392
What, we just feed it
the leftovers?

305
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,961
I think so. Yeah.
Very good with chow mein.

306
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,829
[laughing]

307
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,232
Look, babe,
just please know

308
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:04,302
that we don't need horses
and housekeepers.

309
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,204
We just need
more of you here.
What? What?

310
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,272
Eating mediocre
Chinese food.
What? What?

311
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,774
Stop!
Come here.

312
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,944
Charlie.
Charlie. Oh.
Mm, Charlie, Charlie.

313
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,779
[phone ringing]
Aw, shoot.

314
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:17,215
Aw, come on!
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

315
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,885
I just am expecting a call,
and this guy's been--
I'm so sorry.

316
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,853
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna take this
in the office.

317
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,288
Right.
Yeah.

318
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,861
How was your day?
Oh, it was swell!

319
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,331
I got so much done
for the benefit.

320
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,833
Didn't even have time to cook.

321
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,936
Hey, Parker, before I forget,
let me thank you for
that recommendation.

322
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,304
That was awesome.

323
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:41,672
<i>What recommendation?</i>

324
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,241
For the contractor.

325
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,343
The guy you sent me
the e-mail with the link.

326
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,345
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>send you anything.</i>

327
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,847
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>I got it right here.</i>

328
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,016
<i>It's in my e-mail.</i>

329
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,588
Or I thought it
was here. Hold on.

330
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,992
<i>Don't worry about it. I get</i>
<i>so busy, I don't even remember</i>
<i>what day of the week it is.</i>

331
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,968
Yeah, right.

332
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,907
Huh. Uh, hey, man, let me
call you back tomorrow.

333
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,006
[door opens]

334
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,076
[door closes]

335
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,807
Hope West had over
70,000 children

336
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,809
come through last year
seeking treatment.

337
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,678
And not only do we provide
top patient care

338
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,713
and medical training
in the pediatric field,

339
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,750
we spent over $40 million
in research alone last year.

340
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,685
[tea kettle whistling]

341
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:10,488
Yes, and we're doing some
really cutting-edge therapies.

342
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,559
Now, our oncology division

343
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,595
is developing
personalized therapies

344
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:20,531
to fight malignant tumors
at a molecular level.

345
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,133
We're also performing
a revolutionary new surgery

346
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,135
to repair heart defects
in the womb.

347
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,470
Mm-hmm. Yes, all of this
is made possible

348
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,672
through the generosity
of our donors.

349
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,848
Mm-hmm. Of course.

350
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,190
You would?
Oh, that's wonderful.

351
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,527
Thank you so much. I will send
the forms over right away.

352
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,696
Right. Yes, of course, and two
tickets for our fall benefit.

353
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,131
Great. Thank you.

354
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,031
Oh-ho-ho.

355
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,967
Look at you and your castle
in the mountain.

356
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,170
Girl, you are living
the dream! [laughs]
[laughs]

357
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,972
Oh, please,
this old thing?

358
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,041
Oh, no, I love it.
It's so peaceful and quiet.

359
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:39,477
[saw buzzing]

360
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,045
Well, almost.

361
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,746
And am I crazy,

362
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,616
or was that a riding arena
I saw on the way in here?

363
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,185
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And stables
in the back.

364
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,222
Has McKenzie asked
for a horse yet?

365
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,090
Oh, sister, please.
And Paul caved.

366
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,892
Seriously?

367
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,827
Yep. Charlie arrives
this afternoon.

368
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,631
You see? This move was
good for the whole family.

369
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,199
You haven't seen
the kitchen yet.

370
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,901
[Liz]
I know. [chatters]

371
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,136
[Liz, Kate laughing]

372
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,772
Yeah, so just,
you know a few things.

373
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:11,942
Just a couple.
Yeah, should be
done by dinner.

374
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,811
Hi, Javier.
Hey.

375
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,913
This is
my friend Kate.
Hi.

376
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,114
Hi. That's him?

377
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,651
Yeah,
that's him.

378
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,653
Ooh!
Yeah, it's beautiful,
isn't it?

379
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,788
Nice fridge.
But, uh,
no countertops.

380
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,257
No backsplash.
It's okay.

381
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,826
Just a few things.
Stove is awesome, though.

382
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,629
I can't wait
to get cooking on that.
It's blue.

383
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,665
[Liz]
I know. It's just
that I--

384
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:38,135
I have to trim those back,
turn over all this earth,

385
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,004
and get some color in here,
you know?

386
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,805
It's just so drab
back here.

387
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,173
It'll look beautiful.

388
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:47,177
Um, so Paul
really leaves you

389
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,113
alone in the house
with that guy?

390
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,282
Seems harmless enough.

391
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:53,651
Right. Delicate
little butterfly.

392
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,985
Be nice.

393
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,021
I'm sorry.

394
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:59,690
Oh, did you get the e-mail this
morning with the new numbers?

395
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:02,860
Ticket sales are 105%
to goal. Yes, I did.

396
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,628
I know, and that's
not even with Halligan.

397
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,096
That's amazing.
Mm-hmm.

398
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,198
Well, I may have
maybe forced Paul

399
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,334
to have everyone in
his law firm buy tickets, but...

400
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:13,070
He's such a suck-up.
Yeah, he should be
sucking up.

401
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,172
He's been working
every night for months.

402
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,341
Well, he could be
like my husband,

403
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:21,078
who plops on the couch and
plays his fantasy football
all night long.

404
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,715
Uh, yeah, you have
a handsome...

405
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,984
good-looking husband...

406
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,786
Is everything okay?

407
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:35,192
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, sorry.

408
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,194
Do you want
to see the stables?
Yeah, love to.

409
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,629
Walk this way.

410
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,936
Hi, I'm hoping
you can help me out.

411
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,973
I'm the office manager
for Chase law firm,

412
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:53,110
and for some reason we didn't
receive our billing statements
for the last two cycles.

413
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,879
Is there any way you can reprint
them and e-mail them to me?

414
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,253
Great. Okay, my e-mail
is Liz dot Chase...

415
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,322
<i>at Gobble dot net.</i>

416
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,825
Thank you.
Thanks very much.

417
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:08,826
Bye-bye.

418
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,105
What are you
doing in there?

419
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:11,909
I tripped the circuit.
I was looking for
the breaker box.

420
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,977
Breaker box
isn't in there.
It's in the garage.

421
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,412
Thank you,
Mrs. Chase.

422
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,409
[Paul]
What's going on?

423
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,211
I think we have
to let Javier go.

424
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,948
Why? What's happening?

425
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,549
You're gonna think
I'm being paranoid,

426
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,551
but something's not right.

427
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,553
I was out by the pool
the other day,

428
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,156
and I could swear
he was watching me.

429
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:02,025
And then I caught him
eavesdropping on Kate and I.

430
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,195
And last night I heard a noise
outside the bathroom window,

431
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,065
and when I went to look,
someone had knocked
a pot over.

432
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:12,603
And then to top it off,
I caught him coming out
of your office today.

433
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,271
Something's not right.

434
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,241
[sighing]

435
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,144
I know he was
the most affordable,

436
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:24,648
and maybe he does good work,
but when you're at work

437
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,451
and McKenzie's at school,
I'm the one who's
home alone with him.

438
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,653
Yeah, I know.
I know.

439
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:33,423
I just-- I'd feel better
if we could hire someone else
to finish the work.

440
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,196
Okay.

441
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,297
Really?
Okay.

442
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,002
Yeah, um... Yeah.

443
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,204
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

444
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:51,174
Just call Marilyn's contractor
and get that set up.

445
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,377
I'll take care
of Javier.

446
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:54,645
All right.

447
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,147
Let's go.
All right.

448
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,660
So, Casey, can you cancel
all my appointments
this afternoon?

449
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,628
I've got to deal
with something at home.

450
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,130
Okay.
Thanks.

451
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,043
Javier?

452
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,415
Javier.

453
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,650
Hey, you're home early.

454
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,156
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

455
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,691
Sorry?

456
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,326
Your work is done here.
You gotta go.

457
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,661
I don't understand.

458
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,464
I think you
understand it perfectly.

459
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:52,369
You understand that what you've
been doing in this house
is totally inappropriate.

460
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:55,272
You know, I'm afraid I don't
know what you're talking about.

461
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:57,107
My wife said
she saw you in my office.

462
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,976
Yeah, I was looking
for the breaker panel.

463
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,577
In my home office?
Really?

464
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,680
What about last night?

465
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,185
What were you doing
outside the house?

466
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,423
Look, I'll write you a check
for everything that you've done,

467
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,058
but you gotta go.

468
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,143
You know, you got
a nice thing here.

469
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,581
Gorgeous house,
nice family.

470
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,784
Be a shame to lose that.

471
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:43,653
You threatening me?

472
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,490
I know a thing
or two about loss,

473
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,125
and a man like yourself

474
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:51,161
better think twice
about making rash decisions.

475
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,334
Do I need to call the police?

476
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,608
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

477
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,723
I'll be seeing you.

478
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,707
Thank you.

479
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,349
You won't see
him again. Promise.

480
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,858
I just need you to take care
of those three things,
and we'll be good.

481
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,827
All right. Thanks.

482
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,429
Wow! You look like
an expert out there already.

483
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:07,430
Oh, thank you.

484
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,168
[McKenzie]
Thank you.

485
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,171
Hey, have you had a chance

486
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,872
to think about
that party at all?

487
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,275
Party?

488
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:21,211
Yeah, Kimmy's birthday
is the 20th,

489
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,680
so she's getting a beach cabana
down in San Diego that Saturday.

490
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,284
Yeah, and I told her
that I didn't think
it was a very good idea.

491
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,686
But I told her that I'd
bring an extra inhaler.

492
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,721
Look, you have to stop losing
the one that you have.

493
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,324
Is her mom gonna
be down there?

494
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:38,295
Yeah, of course.
And it's just one night.

495
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:40,197
And you guys are just gonna
hang out in the cabana?

496
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,499
Yeah, that's what
I told Mom.

497
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,900
So what do you think?

498
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:44,968
It's fine by me.

499
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,269
You?

500
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,672
[sighs]
All right.

501
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,473
Yes! Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

502
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,411
What are you doing?
I already told her no.

503
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,515
I don't know, just with
everything that's going on,

504
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:00,917
maybe she's better off
just hanging out with
her friends for a night.

505
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,354
Hmm.

506
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,657
Yeah, you might have a point.

507
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,961
Yeah,
and the benefit's

508
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:13,563
probably going to be
boring for her.

509
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,999
Bunch of old folks.
I guess.

510
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,969
[Paul]
The benefit.

511
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:45,996
[printer whirring]

512
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,395
Yeah, you wouldn't believe
how many times I've heard
the same old story.

513
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:22,599
Contractor just gets up
and bails before he even
finishes his job.

514
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:24,801
Yeah, I figured
that one out
the hard way.

515
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,805
[laughing]
Well, you definitely get
what you pay for, right?

516
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,974
Yeah, don't rub
it in, Elliot.

517
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,410
[sighs]
Well, listen.
Don't worry about it.

518
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,412
I think we're gonna get
everything done in time.

519
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:36,780
That would be great.

520
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,516
Okay, guys. Elliot,
thank you for saving us.

521
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:41,651
You're welcome.
Appreciate it.
Everything okay?

522
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,852
Yeah, I think
we're good here, right?

523
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,754
Yeah, under control.

524
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:47,724
All right.
Try and be home by dinner.

525
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,898
You might want to consider
reporting this guy
to the license board.

526
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,099
That's a good idea.

527
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,913
I'm not gonna admit
to something I didn't do.

528
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:12,515
Okay, you didn't do it?

529
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,352
They got your prints all
over the weapon. The guy
identified you in a lineup.

530
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,354
I look like
a lot of people.

531
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,923
You're lucky they're even
offering you this deal.

532
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,492
I don't think you understand

533
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,694
the difficult situation
that you're in right now,

534
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,597
but considering
the fact that you
pay me a ton of money

535
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,100
for my advice,

536
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:32,869
I'd suggest
you listen to me.

537
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,106
Gage, you do not
want this to go to trial.

538
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:37,507
[scoffs]

539
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,583
[engine starts]

540
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,764
Why does nobody listen?

541
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:02,065
It's their loss.

542
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:07,070
[sighs]
Where is everybody?

543
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:10,039
They left.
Oh, my gosh, it's
that time already?

544
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,008
I need you
to sign these.
What do you got?

545
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,811
Lamont.

546
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:17,514
Mm.

547
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,556
You're so tense.
You need to relax more.

548
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:29,626
[shutter clicks]

549
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:32,829
[shutter clicks]

550
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,541
Thanks.
Thank you.

551
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,015
[sighing]

552
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,069
[engine starts]

553
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,197
[beeping]

554
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,866
[rubber flapping]

555
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,568
[beeping]

556
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,203
Oh...

557
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,266
Was that Dad?

558
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:53,102
Can you grab
the glasses off the table?

559
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,137
Yeah, sure.

560
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:55,939
[ringing]

561
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,875
[sighing]

562
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:01,077
You missed dinner again.

563
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,147
Uh, yeah. Can you, uh,
can you pick me up?

564
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:06,716
What happened?

565
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:08,718
All my tires are flat.

566
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,620
Call the Auto Club.

567
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,189
Something wrong?

568
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,727
No. No.

569
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,662
All right, I'm gonna get it
towed over to Tony's.

570
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,664
Can you pick me up there
in a half hour?

571
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,266
Yeah, sure.
I'll leave now.

572
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,705
I gotta go
pick up your father.
Be back in a bit.

573
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,173
Okay.

574
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,687
Do you have any idea
how much those tires cost?

575
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,258
[sighs]
No.

576
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,761
I probably had three
or four hundred miles
on each of them.

577
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:53,396
Now I have to replace
every one of them.

578
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,934
Maybe you should
be more careful
where you drive.

579
00:43:57,936 --> 00:44:00,670
I drive from home to work,
work to home. That's it.

580
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,174
Is Chez Louis
on the way to work?

581
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:08,011
Chez Louis Beverly Hills?

582
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:10,346
No.

583
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:11,781
Ah.

584
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,086
Ah, what?

585
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,125
I found the receipt.

586
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,395
The receipt for what?

587
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,103
Champagne. Really?
Fondue for two.

588
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,405
This isn't mine.

589
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:39,308
I've never even been
to this restaurant.

590
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,677
You're seriously
gonna deny it.

591
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,779
Deny what?
This isn't mine!

592
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,947
Someone else's receipt just
made its way into your pocket?

593
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,816
I don't know.

594
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,387
Right. And what about
the phone calls?

595
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:52,855
Are you serious?

596
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,258
You know, late at night,
unlisted numbers.

597
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,728
Liz, you know,
I sit in my office

598
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,730
till one, two o'clock
in the morning sometimes,

599
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:05,068
calling clients
who have unlisted numbers
for very obvious reasons.

600
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,774
You think I'm sleeping
with someone else?

601
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,446
I don't know.

602
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,283
Are you?

603
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,957
I'm not even going to dignify
that with a response.

604
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,436
[footsteps on grass]

605
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,773
Paul?

606
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:18,007
What?

607
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,509
Come here.

608
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:22,178
[sighs]
What?

609
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,083
There's someone over there.

610
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,223
Liz, there's
no one there.

611
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,225
I think
it was him.

612
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:38,127
Who?
Javier.

613
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,563
Javier is gone.
I'm going inside.

614
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,055
Okay, so I've connected all your
doors and windows to the system.

615
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:07,323
You've got four zones.

616
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:10,092
Front, the rear,
and the two sides.

617
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:13,062
If anyone opens anything,
you've got 15 seconds
to enter the code,

618
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,064
or our call center
will notify the authorities.

619
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:17,133
Okay.
Here. It comes
with a special app,

620
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:18,968
so you can track it
from anywhere.

621
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,037
Oh, wow, that's great.

622
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,412
<i>[man]</i>
<i>Contractor State</i>
<i>License Board.</i>

623
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:31,214
Hi. I'd like to file
a complaint

624
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:32,548
against a contractor.

625
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,250
How do I go about
doing that?

626
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:35,484
<i>First, can I have</i>
<i>your name, please?</i>

627
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:37,954
Yes, it's Elizabeth Chase.

628
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:40,022
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Chase.</i>
<i>And your address?</i>

629
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:44,193
It's 85 Deerfield Road
in Malibu.

630
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:48,431
<i>Okay. And the name of</i>
<i>the contractor you'd like</i>
<i>to file a complaint on?</i>

631
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:51,167
Javier Reyes.
R-e-y-e-s.

632
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:54,237
<i>Um, one second.</i>

633
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,339
<i>I'm sorry. There's no one</i>
<i>in the system with that name.</i>

634
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:59,075
What do you mean?
I've got his license
right in front of me.

635
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:02,411
I'll read you the number.
It's 0-1-5-4-5.

636
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,084
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>That license number is invalid.</i>

637
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:11,387
That doesn't make sense.
I'm looking right at it.

638
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:14,023
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>to file a complaint</i>
<i>for unlicensed activity?</i>

639
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,927
[sighs]

640
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,264
No, never mind.
Thank you.

641
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:38,614
What the--

642
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,324
Thanks for bringing
the car over.
Yeah, no worries.

643
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:51,327
Did you figure out
what the problem was?
Nails.

644
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,662
Nails?
Yeah, nails.

645
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:55,231
Now, I can understand
one or two,

646
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,500
but, Paul,
I counted 15.

647
00:48:57,502 --> 00:49:00,036
You been driving through
a construction site
or something?

648
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:01,637
Uh, not that I remember.

649
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:06,242
Javier.
Excuse me?

650
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,413
This contractor who's
been doing some work
over at the house.

651
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:13,082
We had a bit
of a falling out.

652
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:15,251
Paul, we're talking
over a grand
worth of rubber here.

653
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:17,153
That's a hell
of a falling out.

654
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:19,255
Son of a bitch.

655
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:22,224
Look, if that's
the case,

656
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,260
just be careful where
you park her, huh?

657
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:26,696
You're lucky
it's just the tires.

658
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,365
Thank you, sir.
'Course.

659
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:30,566
Anytime. You know that.

660
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:41,043
[line ringing]

661
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:43,412
Come on. Answer.

662
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:46,549
<i>We're sorry. The number you</i>
<i>have reached is not in service.</i>

663
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,593
That should do it.
Perfect.

664
00:49:57,595 --> 00:50:01,063
Thank you very much.
Yeah, that's what
we're here for.

665
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:03,132
And listen. Don't stress out
about the kitchen.

666
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:05,134
I'll get that done
really soon, okay?
Thank you.

667
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:07,536
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
So what was it?

668
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:09,505
Was it a clog
or something?

669
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,507
Well, if I didn't know
better myself,

670
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,276
I'd say somebody
tampered with your lines.

671
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:15,745
What do you mean,
tampered?

672
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,780
Somebody who knew
what they were doing

673
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:20,616
really messed up
your drainage system.

674
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:23,619
Right. Of course
it was someone who knew
what they were doing.

675
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,621
What? You think
you know who did this?

676
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:28,624
Yeah, I have
a pretty good idea.

677
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:30,626
I don't know if we're
going to find anything.

678
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,561
It's probably not
even his real name.

679
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,497
Don't worry about that.

680
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:37,500
I told you you can find
almost anything on the Internet.

681
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,673
[Kate]
Right. All right,
I'll tell you what.

682
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,210
Why don't you...

683
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,613
put in his description
as best you can...

684
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:53,449
Mm-hmm.
and see what
comes up, okay?

685
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:56,352
I'm just gonna get
some more coffee.
Do you want anything?

686
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:59,255
No, I'm good.
Thank you.
All right. Be right back.

687
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:00,623
All right.

688
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,325
"Ethnicity."

689
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,662
"Age range."

690
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:09,498
Forty-eight to fifty-eight.

691
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,700
"Height."

692
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:15,204
Five-seven to five-eleven.

693
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:16,772
"Hair." Brown.

694
00:51:16,774 --> 00:51:20,209
"Eyes." Brown.

695
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:21,677
"Name or known aliases."

696
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,081
Well, might as well.

697
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:28,117
Javier... Reyes.

698
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,823
Twenty-eight pages?

699
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,735
I'm going cross-eyed.

700
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,537
I can't look
at any more of these.

701
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,172
We're never
going to find him.

702
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,373
Just one more page, okay?

703
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:52,708
Just one more.

704
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,878
All right.

705
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,285
[Liz]
Look at this guy.

706
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,553
Oh, yeah, that's him.

707
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,857
"Jorge Reyes.

708
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:10,426
Arrested for
contempt of court."

709
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,328
Is there anything else?

710
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,365
Well, at least
we have a name.

711
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:17,766
Well, now what?

712
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,837
You know what? Let me see
something for a second, okay?

713
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:26,275
Let's see.
[clears throat]

714
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,314
What is this database?

715
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,783
Something my hubby
uses at the office.

716
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:36,285
He lets you
log in to it?

717
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,754
Steven uses the same
password for everything.

718
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,756
Huh.
Okay.

719
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,226
Let's see. Jorge Reyes.

720
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,764
All right, look.
Here's something.

721
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,900
[Liz]
Is that a news article?

722
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:54,336
Yeah. "Arrested
two years earlier

723
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,940
"for the murder
of a gang member,
27-year-old Omar Reyes

724
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:03,212
"was killed in a gang fight
in a California state prison
in Lancaster.

725
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:06,348
"His father, Jorge Reyes,
50 years old, from Pacoima,

726
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:09,418
"expressed his anger
at the news.

727
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,923
'My son was innocent,
and the system took his life.'"

728
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:17,326
This article is
from two months ago.

729
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:20,196
But how do we know
that this is the same guy?

730
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:23,499
All right.
Here's another one.

731
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:27,236
"After a six-hour deliberation,

732
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:30,406
"Omar Reyes was found guilty
of first-degree murder.

733
00:53:30,408 --> 00:53:32,741
"Applauding the jurors'
decision, prosecutor...

734
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,612
"Paul Chase...

735
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,615
"said this was
a major victory

736
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:41,984
in the city's fight
against gang violence."

737
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:43,953
Oh.

738
00:53:43,955 --> 00:53:47,523
That's why he's doing this.

739
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:50,526
Paul was the prosecutor
that sent his son to prison,

740
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:51,961
where he was killed.

741
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,697
Oh, my gosh.

742
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,465
We should call Paul.

743
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,636
Not yet.
I need to find out more.

744
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:02,438
Do you think
she still works there?

745
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,529
Excuse me?
We're closed.
Come back at 5:00.

746
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:28,831
Maria Parra?

747
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,568
Do I know you?

748
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,570
No.

749
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:37,373
Um, my name
is Elizabeth Chase,

750
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:40,909
and I was hoping I could
talk to you about Omar.

751
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,044
Get out.

752
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:43,412
We just need a few--

753
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:44,680
You two got
a hearing problem?

754
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:45,981
My husband, Paul Chase,

755
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:48,484
he was the prosecutor
on Omar's case.

756
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,355
Just five minutes.
Please?

757
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:53,989
What?

758
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:56,925
The night Omar
was arrested,

759
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,061
you were with him,
weren't you?

760
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:00,896
I already told
the police everything.

761
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:03,032
We're not the police.

762
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:05,034
We just want to know
what happened.

763
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,411
We were just walking,
minding our own business.

764
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:17,579
Then all of a sudden,
these guys came up.

765
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:19,715
I'd seen them
around the bar sometimes.

766
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:22,651
Latin Princes.

767
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,787
One of them comes up to me,

768
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:26,655
tries to put
the moves on me.

769
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:30,025
Starts touching me,
groping me.

770
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:34,463
He pulled out a knife.

771
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:36,065
Next thing I know,
Omar's on top of him.

772
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,736
It all just
happened so fast.

773
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:43,005
I looked up and...

774
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,708
the other guy was on
the ground, and Omar...

775
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,610
was covered in blood.

776
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:56,518
The cops caught up to him
down the block.

777
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,821
<i>Didn't even give him</i>
<i>a chance to surrender.</i>

778
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:02,491
<i>They just started</i>
<i>beating him.</i>

779
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:05,127
Well, you told them
that he was just
trying to protect you.

780
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:09,064
It doesn't matter.
He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

781
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:12,501
Your husband should have known,
if only he actually cared
about something more

782
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:14,737
than getting
a quick conviction.

783
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:20,008
Are you still in contact
with Omar's father, Jorge?

784
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,511
We get together
once in a while.

785
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:24,113
He didn't really
have anyone.

786
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:27,383
His wife died of cancer
when Omar was six.

787
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:30,953
But when Omar died
two months ago...

788
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:33,522
he was so angry.

789
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:36,458
He became a different person.

790
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,494
After he lost his job
at the phone company,

791
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:40,396
he just became scary.

792
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:43,465
Kept talking
about revenge.

793
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,501
What did he do
for the phone company?

794
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:48,704
Installation.
High-end systems.

795
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:52,007
He's a really
smart guy, but...

796
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,809
he's got a bad temper
sometimes.

797
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,068
Hey, Liz.

798
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,040
What are you doing
out here in the cold?

799
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,813
Jorge Reyes,
that's his name.
His real name.

800
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,683
Sound familiar?

801
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:36,485
No. Should it?

802
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,729
Oh, yeah.
That Eastside gang kid.

803
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:49,531
Got killed.
I remember this.

804
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,705
Omar Reyes
is Javier's-- his--

805
00:57:56,707 --> 00:57:58,774
Jorge's son?

806
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:00,209
Mm-hmm.

807
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,513
And he was killed
in prison two months ago.

808
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,785
Apparently there was
a fight in the yard.

809
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:12,221
He was just
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

810
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:14,957
Wow.

811
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:19,895
I spoke to Omar's
girlfriend today.

812
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,601
Why?

813
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:27,603
'Cause I'm trying to understand
what's going on here.

814
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,140
I thought maybe if I
knew more about Omar

815
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,776
or more about the case...

816
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:40,616
Omar killed
a rival gang member.

817
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:42,217
She said
it was self-defense.

818
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,522
And you believe her?

819
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:48,290
It's possible, isn't it?

820
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:50,692
Omar's girlfriend says
that it was self-defense.

821
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,594
The D.A.'s office says
that it was murder.

822
00:58:52,596 --> 00:58:55,797
But it's the system
that decides ultimately.

823
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:59,134
There were 12 jurors
that convicted him,
not me.

824
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:02,838
I did my job.
You gotta believe me.

825
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,973
I don't think it matters
what I believe.

826
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,278
Jorge believes that
his son was innocent.

827
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,315
Maybe that's why he's here.

828
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,720
It was Jorge that faked
the recommendation

829
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,189
for the contractor
from Parker.

830
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,192
Oh, Paul.

831
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,996
We're in way over
our heads here.

832
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:33,602
He's blaming you
for the death of his son.

833
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,203
He's going to try
and destroy this family.

834
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:38,206
We-- We have to call
the police.

835
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,578
I'll take care of it.

836
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,179
All right.
I'll take care of it.

837
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,885
You gotta get
some rest.

838
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,655
Got your big event
tomorrow.

839
00:59:53,657 --> 00:59:54,856
[sighing]

840
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:01,163
Be in in a minute.
Okay.

841
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:54,383
Gage, it's Paul Chase.

842
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,688
You have some friends in some
pretty low places, don't you?

843
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:05,360
Yeah. I need
to ask you a favor.

844
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,134
Jorge Reyes?
A friend says hi.

845
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:49,104
[yelling, grunting]

846
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,085
[yells]

847
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:32,347
You're going to
drive them off over there
and then around the back,

848
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:34,883
but you gotta leave
a little corridor between
the fountain and right there

849
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,218
so people can get through.
You got it.

850
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,452
Thanks.

851
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,156
That's going in the backyard
behind the pool.

852
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:42,357
Got it.
All right.

853
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,836
Hey, you all set
already?
Yep.

854
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:56,338
Let me take that.
Thank you.

855
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,774
Grab that. Oh, did you
pack sunscreen?

856
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:00,509
Yes.
And you got
your inhaler, right?

857
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:01,510
Yes.
And the backup?

858
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,879
Yes, Mom!

859
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:06,081
I can't help it.
It's my job.

860
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,117
Uh, ooh, I need you
to text me when you arrive,

861
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,386
and then check in
every couple of hours or so.

862
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:13,121
Hey, Mom,
it's one night.

863
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,890
I promise everything's
going to be okay,

864
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:16,792
and I'll be back
before you know it.

865
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:18,794
All right. Have fun.

866
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:20,028
Thank you.
Good luck.

867
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:23,331
[sighing]

868
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,571
Don't worry
about Jorge Reyes.

869
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:31,139
Took care of it.

870
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,875
What do you mean,
you took care of it?

871
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:35,076
Took care of it.

872
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,416
[engine starts]

873
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,273
[phone chimes]

874
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,021
Hey, Ms. Chase.
Hi.

875
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,090
Think that about does it.
We got everything done.

876
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:25,460
Everything looks amazing.
Thank you, Elliot.

877
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:27,596
This is for you.
I appreciate it.

878
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:29,598
You have a good time
at your party, all right?
Thanks.

879
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,367
Let's get out of here.

880
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,902
Thank you again.
You're welcome.
Bye-bye.

881
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:35,103
Bye.

882
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,512
Hey, Liz.
Snap out of it!

883
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:46,314
Your guests are
gonna be arriving soon.

884
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:49,117
Right. Yes, thank you.

885
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,053
The veggie platter has to
go out and so does this.

886
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:56,658
I'm going check the heaters
on the chafing dishes.
I'll be right back.

887
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,093
Okay.

888
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,991
Why don't you please
enjoy some champagne,
and I'll see you later.

889
01:05:29,993 --> 01:05:31,960
Thank you.

890
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:35,130
Mr. Halligan. Thank you
so much for being here.

891
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:37,332
My pleasure.
Mrs. Halligan,
it's nice to see you.

892
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:40,068
Oh, thank you so much.
We're going to get
started shortly, okay?

893
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,002
Thank you.

894
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,982
Mr. Halligan
looks happy. Hmm?

895
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:56,284
[Liz]
That's wonderful.
Thank you.

896
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,585
What's wrong?

897
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,556
Nothing.
Just jitters, I guess.

898
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,559
I guess
I better do this.

899
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:19,074
Good afternoon, everyone.
Could I have your attention,
please?

900
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:21,977
I would like to welcome you
to the fifth annual

901
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:24,145
Fall Into Caring
Charity Cocktail Party

902
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,047
to benefit the Hope West
Children's Hospital.

903
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,150
When our daughter,
McKenzie,

904
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:32,320
first suffered
an attack of acute asthma,

905
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,489
we were terrified.

906
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:37,592
We went through
a number of doctors,
some we had known for years,

907
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:39,761
but no one could help.

908
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:43,098
And that's
when I found Hope West.

909
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,135
Excuse me.

910
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:50,171
That's when I discovered
Hope West Children's Hospital.

911
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:55,343
And thanks to specialists
like Dr. Harding and Dr. Daley

912
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,178
and the Asthma Action Team,

913
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,548
McKenzie is now leading
the life of a normal teenager.

914
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:03,018
She's running track at school,

915
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,453
she's riding her new horse,
Charlie, and, uh,

916
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:09,357
against my better judgment,
she is at a party on the beach

917
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,159
in San Diego
with her best friend.

918
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:13,361
[laughter]

919
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:17,298
So I would so appreciate it
if you would give a warm welcome

920
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,468
to the chief of pediatric
medicine, Dr. Arthur Wright.

921
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,475
How about that
Elizabeth Chase, everyone?

922
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,611
[phone ringing]
Wow.

923
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:33,615
What an amazing woman.
Elizabeth Chase...

924
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:36,317
What's going on?

925
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,319
<i>I like your wife's speech.</i>

926
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:39,621
Excuse me?

927
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,393
How-How--
<i>[Jorge]</i>
<i>How am I still alive?</i>

928
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,295
Because you're
still cutting corners,

929
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:48,763
hiring the wrong people.

930
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,568
<i>Did you know Omar</i>
<i>had gotten into college?</i>

931
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,538
He was going
to study computers.

932
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,207
He was the next generation,

933
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:01,443
<i>and you saw him</i>
<i>as a common criminal.</i>

934
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:05,380
He was my son.

935
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:08,216
Look, coming after me
and my family isn't going
to get your son back.

936
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:09,717
Do you know what it's
like to lose a child,

937
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,720
your own flesh and blood?

938
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,690
Of course you don't.

939
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:17,725
You don't know what
it feels like to lose.

940
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:22,530
<i>Well, let me tell you.</i>
<i>You feel helpless.</i>

941
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:23,765
Powerless.

942
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,502
Like there's nothing
in the world you can do.

943
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,774
<i>Well, there's something</i>
<i>I can do now.</i>

944
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:37,745
All right, what do you want?
Ten thousand? Fifteen thousand?

945
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,515
What'll it take for you
to leave me and my family alone?

946
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:43,585
Just tell me.
Whatever you need,
I'll give it to you.

947
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:46,354
<i>I want you to feel</i>
<i>what it's like to</i>
<i>be helpless, Paul.</i>

948
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:49,390
I'm going
to make you understand

949
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:51,192
what it feels like to lose.

950
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,434
[Dr. Wright]
Thank you very much,
and thank you for coming.

951
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:00,902
I hope you're having
a wonderful time.

952
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,545
Hey.

953
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:13,414
Hey.
[chuckles]

954
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,783
Sorry I'm late.
I had to walk all the way
from Kimmy's house.

955
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:18,586
Your folks really think
you're staying the night
in San Diego with her?

956
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:20,155
Yep.
[laughing]

957
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:21,389
Nice.

958
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:26,928
Let's sit down here.

959
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:35,904
So pretty.
I know. So quiet.

960
01:09:35,906 --> 01:09:37,305
[McKenzie]
I know.

961
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,568
Hey, Liz.

962
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:12,941
You lied to me.

963
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:15,643
You lied to my face!

964
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,916
And then you
bring her here?

965
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:25,787
You bring her here
on this day into our home!

966
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:28,223
Liz, yes, Casey came on
to me, but I said no.

967
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:30,325
How stupid do I look?

968
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:33,228
Clearly-- Does it look
like you're protesting?

969
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:34,696
Don't you think if there
was something worse

970
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:36,631
that they would have sent you
a photograph of that?

971
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:38,633
Maybe you took it
somewhere more private.

972
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:40,535
Maybe that's where you've been
every night of the week.

973
01:10:40,537 --> 01:10:41,869
Nothing happened!

974
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:44,505
She rubbed my neck,
but that was it!

975
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:47,475
Liz, don't you see
this guy's trying to
drive our family apart?

976
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:50,712
He's trying
to push us apart!
Don't put this on him!

977
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:53,715
Liz, you know me!

978
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:56,451
No, I don't.

979
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,988
Not lately.

980
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,757
Not the way
you've been acting.

981
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,793
You're gone all the time.
You're sneaking off into
your office all the time.

982
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:08,563
How am I supposed
to believe you?

983
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:10,898
It's not like this
is the first time.

984
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,368
You can't keep
holding that over my head.

985
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,503
It was 17 years ago!

986
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:18,606
Before we
were married!

987
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:21,576
You know, maybe this Javier
guy's not so crazy after all,

988
01:11:21,578 --> 01:11:23,511
'cause I don't know
who you are anymore--

989
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:25,713
'cause the man
I married would not--

990
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:28,950
would not do
something like that!

991
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,885
What do you want?
What do you want me to do?

992
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:33,421
Just tell me,
and I'll do it.

993
01:11:33,423 --> 01:11:36,491
What I need is for you
to just leave me alone.

994
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:37,892
Just go.

995
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:41,863
I can't leave you here, Liz.

996
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:44,899
Not with him out there.
It's not safe.

997
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:47,902
You've done enough for one day.
Please just get out.

998
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,939
[sniffling]

999
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:53,374
Do you--

1000
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:02,517
You respect me so little,
you can't even tell me
the truth?

1001
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:07,355
Just go. Please just go!

1002
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:09,490
You're making a really
big mistake right now.

1003
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:12,093
Well, you would know,
wouldn't you?

1004
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:16,864
Get out!

1005
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:13,454
Whoa, Chris, slow down.

1006
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:14,589
What?

1007
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:21,028
Oh, come on.
What's your problem?

1008
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:24,132
I just--
I don't want to.

1009
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:26,768
You snuck out of your house
to spend the night with me,

1010
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:29,704
and you don't want to?

1011
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:33,708
Wait. Is this what you
thought this was gonna be?

1012
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,544
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1013
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,915
I'm sorry. I just--

1014
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,683
I don't think I'm ready.

1015
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,485
You don't think
you're ready?

1016
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,725
Look, why don't you
just take me home?
[scoffs]

1017
01:13:50,727 --> 01:13:53,694
You know what?
Why don't I not!

1018
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:55,730
Chris, come on!

1019
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:56,798
Stupid tease!

1020
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,033
Chris!

1021
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:01,102
Chris!

1022
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,740
[engine starts]

1023
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,077
Wait!

1024
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,647
I left my phone in your car!

1025
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:07,935
[line ringing]

1026
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,873
<i>Hi, this is McKenzie.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1027
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:13,908

1028
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,273
[line ringing]

1029
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:46,974
<i>[woman]</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Hi, Judy.</i>

1030
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:48,976
It's Elizabeth,
McKenzie's mom.

1031
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:51,679
I just wanted to check in,
see how the party was going.

1032
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:54,115
<i>San Diego is beautiful,</i>
<i>and the girls are having</i>
<i>such a great time.</i>

1033
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:56,117
<i>How's McKenzie feeling?</i>

1034
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:58,719
What do you mean?

1035
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,154
<i>We're sorry</i>
<i>she couldn't make it,</i>

1036
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:02,023
<i>but the girls and I hope</i>
<i>she's feeling better.</i>

1037
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,725
You mean she's not
there with you?
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

1038
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,861
<i>Kimmy said she was sick</i>
<i>and had to cancel.</i>

1039
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:10,998
[sighing]
Okay, I need you to ask
Kimmy where she is.

1040
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,901
<i>Kimmy!</i>

1041
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,637
<i>Mrs. Chase is on the phone.</i>
<i>Why does she think McKenzie's</i>
<i>here with us?</i>

1042
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:21,008
<i>Answer me.</i>

1043
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:25,012
<i>[Kimmy]</i>
<i>She wanted to see Chris, so I</i>
<i>told her I'd cover for her.</i>

1044
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:27,315
All right, tell Kimmy
that if McKenzie calls her,

1045
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:29,116
she needs to call me
as soon as she can.

1046
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,885
All right? Thank you.

1047
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,726

01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:42,129

Mrs. Chase!

1056
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:19,333
Got something for you!
I know you're inside!

1057
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,103
Oh, no.

1058
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,938
Come on out.

1059
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:26,107
Javier, please.
Ten...

1060
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:27,408
Please, no.
nine--

1061
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:29,910
No, Mom, don't do it!
Shut up!

1062
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:30,911
Eight...
Oh!

1063
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:33,881
seven, six...

1064
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:36,350

Stop, I'm here!

1067
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:43,424
Please don't hurt her!

01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:47,194
Jorge, please.

1070
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:54,835
Come on.

1071
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:56,971
[Liz]
Are you hurt?

1072
01:17:56,973 --> 01:17:58,039
She's fine!

1073
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:01,809
Look, I know about Omar.

1074
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:05,246
Don't mention my son's name.

1075
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,315
He was a good kid.

1076
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:09,750
So is McKenzie.

1077
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,821
I'm so sorry
this happened to you. Please--

1078
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:16,390
It's too late for apologies.
Let me have your phone.

1079
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,307
[phone chimes]

1080
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,304
Daddy's on his way.

1081
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:31,365
Elizabeth!

1082
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,836
Eliz--
Paul, look out!

1083
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,447
What do you want?

1084
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:49,483
I want you to admit
what you did to my son.

1085
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:51,418
I didn't do anything.

1086
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,088
No, you just
looked at him.

1087
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:56,524
You saw a criminal.

1088
01:19:56,526 --> 01:19:59,393
That was a good kid.
Had his whole life ahead of him.

1089
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:02,429
What is this about?
Revenge?

1090
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:04,431
This is about what's
right and what's wrong.

1091
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:05,499
No!

1092
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:11,872
[grunting]

1093
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:20,181
Come on. Go, go!

1094
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:02,156
All right, girls.

1095
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:03,591
Come on, now.

1096
01:21:03,593 --> 01:21:05,426
You could run,
but you can't hide.

1097
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:15,269
Now, come on.
McKenzie!

1098
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:17,905
I got another
Spanish lesson for you!

1099
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:51,372
Ah!

1100
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:08,389
[gunshot]

1101
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:23,604
Okay.

1102
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:30,210
Get under there.
Get right under.

1103
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:32,313
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Be as quiet as you can, okay?

1104
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:45,592
Mrs. Chase,
where are you?

1105
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,573
Just stay here, okay?
Stay here, be quiet.

1106
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,077
[gasping]

1107
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:05,179
[Jorge]
Come on, now.

1108
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,515
No time for games.

1109
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:12,720
[gasping]

1110
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,091
[grunting]

1111
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:23,590
[Paul]
Uh-uh.

1112
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:25,092
Come here.
It's okay.

1113
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,698
It's over. It's over.

1114
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,252
Hey.
Hi.

1115
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,488
So, are you three
all packed? Oh!

1116
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:56,690
Yeah, so much
as I can tell.

1117
01:24:56,692 --> 01:24:59,560
I can't believe you're
giving up this house.

1118
01:24:59,562 --> 01:25:01,395
I totally understand why.

1119
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:04,531
Mm-hmm.
Well, it was a little
too big for us, anyway.

1120
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:06,733
Yep, we're gonna have
a fresh start, you know?

1121
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:09,369
Clean slate.
In a number of ways.

1122
01:25:09,371 --> 01:25:12,139
Yeah, I'm actually
bringing in an associate,

1123
01:25:12,141 --> 01:25:14,675
cutting my hours way down,
spending a little more time
with the family.

1124
01:25:14,677 --> 01:25:15,676
Mm-hmm.
Aw!

1125
01:25:15,678 --> 01:25:17,511
We found this great house.

1126
01:25:17,513 --> 01:25:19,213
It's got a great school
right nearby,

1127
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:20,614
and there's
an equestrian center,

1128
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,217
so McKenzie
can keep Charlie.

1129
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:25,419
How's the kitchen?
Completely renovated.

1130
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:27,588
So you don't need
a contractor or anything?

1131
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:29,723
That's funny.
No, no.

1132
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:32,693
So maybe you'll have
time to attend this.

1133
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:35,762
What is this?

1134
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,334
[gasps]

1135
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:44,872
Whoa!
Yep, the board
of directors met,

1136
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:46,573
and it was unanimous.

1137
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:47,908
I know it's not
exactly a wing--

1138
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,643
Oh, uh, I'll take it.

1139
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,645
[Kate laughs]
Oh, my gosh.

1140
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,814
So I can count on you
to be there, then?

1141
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:56,583
Uh, with bells on.
And you are coming
to this one.

1142
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:58,886
Okay.

1143
01:25:58,888 --> 01:26:00,888
Well, kids,
I'm gonna take off,

1144
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,890
beat the traffic.
You all take care.

1145
01:26:02,892 --> 01:26:04,458
All righty.
See you later.

1146
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,393
You, too.
You behave yourself.

1147
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:08,195
Bye.
Ohh.

1148
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:09,730
Thanks.

1149
01:26:09,732 --> 01:26:11,498
Bye. See you later.
[Paul]
Bye, Kate.

1150
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,866
Drive safe.
Thank you.

1151
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:15,169
Wow!

1152
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,738
Wow, Mom.
Congrats.

1153
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,607
I'm proud of you.
Thanks.

1154
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:22,476
You're still grounded.

1155
01:26:22,478 --> 01:26:24,745
Can I drive?
No.

1156
01:26:24,747 --> 01:26:25,946
Hmph.

1157
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:30,551
You can carry
your box, though.
Thanks.
