Can we Uther?
Yes, I know.

19
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,162
I was due at the
office 10 minutes ago.

20
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,464
It's all this darn Christmas
getting in my way.

21
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,432
Ugh!

22
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:09,001
- Watch it, lady!
This is New York!

23
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,437
And it's seven days
'til Christmas.

24
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,106
- January can't
come soon enough.

25
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,175
- TY: So I'll set up the
video conference at four,

26
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:17,743
unless you'd rather have it
at three

27
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,311
and do the budget review at six.

28
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,749
Hello?
Holly, are you there?

29
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,250
Holly? Holly?

30
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,287
- Oh! Uh, sorry, right.
Be right up.

31
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,426
Ty, I'd like to review
the files on Alpensong.

32
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,029
- Here you go,
afternoon coffee, black,

33
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:40,232
signatures on the
top stack here, please.

34
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,267
Do you need me to handle
Secret Santa for you?

35
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,269
- Secret Sant...oh no,
Ty, I'm not doing that.

36
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,105
We are in the business
of excellence,

37
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,406
and excellence doesn't just stop

38
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,908
for some silly holiday
tradition.

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,844
Now, what about Alpensong?

40
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,679
- Holly, everyone's going
out for holiday drinks.

41
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,781
Let's worry about
Alpensong afterwards.

42
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,451
- Ty, this is a tough business.
Grow a pair.

43
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,286
- We lost the deal.
- What!?

44
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,589
I put my heart and
soul into that deal!

45
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,358
- I'm sorry, Holly, you
worked your tail off.

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,926
Let's just grab a
drink and we can...

47
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:11,497
- Convince, coerce, conquer!
Convince, coerce, conquer!

48
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:14,199
- Uh oh.
Windmere wants to see you.

49
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,468
He said now.

50
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,669
- [grunts]

51
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,773
- Holly!
Wanted to check it.

52
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,609
You got a minute?
- Sure, but just a minute.

53
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,812
I have a lot of business
goals to achieve today.

54
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,581
- We needed that Alpensong deal.

55
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,518
It's not like you to lose.
You surf the seas of success.

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,119
You literally wrote
the book on it.

57
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,121
- Well, you know
how passionate I am

58
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,490
about the hotel
and resort business.

59
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,825
- Mm-hmm.

60
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,496
I'm gonna give you another
chance to prove that you're

61
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,231
the tiger I know you can be.

62
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,699
- Thank you, Mr. Windmere.

63
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,868
- I want you to check out
a small-town family inn

64
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,436
I've been eyeballing.

65
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,573
It's the perfect setting
for one of our signature golf,

66
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,742
racetrack, and
water park resorts.

67
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:01,580
1900 acres of fresh pine forest
just waiting to be cleared.

68
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,182
- Love it.
- You'll leave in the morning.

69
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,283
- The morning?

70
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,451
But, uh...but it's
almost Christmas.

71
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,521
- [laughs] You and
I are the same.

72
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,789
Everyone knows
that we don't go in

73
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,292
for that love
and family jazz, no.

74
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,793
It's decided.

75
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,696
I'm sending you to Maine,
little place called Yuletown.

76
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,032
- But I hate small towns.
- Buy them out!

77
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,806
All right, I won't keep you.
Early start tomorrow.

78
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:28,874
- Yes.

79
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,277

big plans tonight, so...

It's your bubbly
best friend calling.

98
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:33,772
Thought you might wanna join me
for a little holiday exposition.

99
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,075
- Oh, I don't know.
What is it? What exposition?

100
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,078
- BUBBLY FRIEND: Oh, you
know, model train, champagne.

101
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,047
- Oh, no, no, thanks.
I'll pass.

102
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,548
- Let me guess.

103
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,817
You're sitting on your couch,
reading your own book,

104
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,754
and staring at that old
picture of you and Chance.

105
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,289
- No. No.

106
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,526
No, I'm going over my business
plans for my business deal.

107
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,429
- Holly, breakups are hard.

108
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,965
You and Chance met the
first day of business school.

109
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,567
You were the power couple
everyone looked up to.

110
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,236
And then six months
ago, out of nowhere,

111
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,570
he decides to take a break

112
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,172
to make sure you're right
for each other?

113
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,976
- Ugh! Sorry to always make
you revisit my backstory.

114
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,679
- That's what I'm here for.
Sure you don't wanna meet up?

115
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,281
- No, no, I'm in for the night.

116
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,183
- Okay. That's it for me, then.

117
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,951
Bye!
- Bye, bestie!

118
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,490

00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,682
- Ginger People Festival,
that's right.

345
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:28,152
The whole town gathers to
decorate gingerbread me...

346
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,888
people.
We wouldn't miss it.

347
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,391
- Well, without our traditions,
we would lose our will to live.

348
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,894
- Mm-hmm.

349
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,262
- Oh, my!

350
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,864
Well, we really could
use another pair of hands

351
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,133
at the festival later.

352
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,836
Holly, how about it?

353
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,238
- Sure.
- Wonderful.

354
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,941
- Always looking for
a chance to connect.

355
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,809
But first, coffee.
- Mm-hmm.

356
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,012
Isn't she darling?
- She really is.

357
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,646
She's not gonna find
any coffee, though.

358
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,485
- [instrumental
Christmassy music]

359
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,122
- A large double shot,
triple caff,

360
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,623
extra hot with oat foam,
please.

361
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,160
- Oh, I think you're
talking about coffee?

362
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,728
We only have hot cocoa here.

363
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,264
- What? This is the third place
that I've been to.

364
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,500
I have a splitting headache.

365
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:18,503
- If you're looking for coffee,
you're not gonna find it here.

366
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,905
Other things you won't find
here, good theater, a piano bar,

367
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,040
or a decent martini.

368
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,810
Hi, Percy Sleigh.
- Holly Jenkins.

369
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,147
Well, I'm from the land of
caffeine, AKA New York City,

370
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,883
and I think I just
met my new best friend.

371
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,452
- Great! I'd love to be
your platonic confidante

372
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:38,089
while you're here in town.
Come on!

373
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,724
- Those aren't free.

374
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,393
- I'm just your typical
small town shopkeeper.

375
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,829
Grew up here, married
my high school sweetheart.

376
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:48,866
- Uh, really?
- Mm-hmm. Homecoming Court.

377
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,903
Best-dressed guy gets
the high school honey.

378
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,404
Pretty straightforward stuff.

379
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,306
What about you?
Got someone special?

380
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,707
- Well, I did.

381
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,577
And he was the whole
package: rich, successful.

382
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,679
I know what you're thinking.
- About the package?

383
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,114
- It sounds like
the perfect deal.

384
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,982
But his heart was
still in escrow.

385
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,717
Oh, sorry, that's
business speak.

386
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,287
I'm an associate vice
acquisitions consultant

387
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,522
at a major company.

388
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,925
And I'm here to buy
the Clüsterfünke Inn.

389
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,828
- Ooh, scandal-ballet!

390
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,429
I wonder how
Frank Clüsterfünke's

391
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,831
gonna feel about that.

392
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,099
- Oh, I met him at
the inn last night.

393
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,068
I cannot stand that man.

394
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,971
He's arrogant and condescending.

395
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,606
What's with him?

396
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,508
- Frank's had a rough go of it.

397
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,743
He's been burned by
women a few times before.

398
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,012
- We've all had our
share of failed romances.

399
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:37,582
- No, I mean literally.
He's a super romantic guy,

400
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,717
but he's had that blow up
in his face a few times.

401
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:43,187
- We all have a date go badly.
- No, I mean literally.

402
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,389
He's had several
fireplace incidents.

403
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,991
- [flashback harps]

404
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,060
- PERCY: The last one was right
before he popped the question to

405
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,395
his fiancée, Janet.

406
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,164
He was tending the fire
while pouring wine.

407
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,432
And suddenly...

408
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:57,435
- [fire roaring, crackling]

409
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,071
- PERCY: Janet survived...

410
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,540
but her eyebrows never
grew back.

411
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:06,010
And their love
was never the same.

412
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,979
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

413
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,649
- [flashback harps]

414
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,452
- Now he's afraid to get
too close to any woman...

415
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,621
or any matches, for that matter.

416
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,257
And that's not easy when you're
the guy who lights the bonfire

417
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:22,093
for the town festival
every year.

418
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:25,630
- Ooh, I see.
- Hi there!

419
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,533
We're, uh,
colorful representations.

420
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,601
My name's Jackie.
This is my beautiful wife, May.

421
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,538
- We're here to offer a
splash of sparkle and variety

422
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,340
in all the snowy white.

423
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:41,112
- Oh. Whoa.
Yeah, I guess you are.

424
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,347
Can I just say, you're, like,
the only other people of color

425
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,782
I've seen in this town.

426
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,251
So...okay, I see.

427
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:50,588
You're saying that when folks
see "colorful representation,"

428
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,590
as you put it, they can
rest easy knowing that this

429
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,892
particular town embraces
everyone of all races,

430
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,862
ethnicities, and
advertising demographics.

431
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:01,065
Well, I want you to know
that you are not just

432
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,167
colorful representations.

433
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,303
You are seen, okay?

434
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,205
I hear you. I celebrate you.
I lift you...

435
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,308
- MAY: Oh, oh, no, dear.

436
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,444
We are Colorful Representations.

437
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,615
- Oh.

438
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,383
- Yeah, it's just
May and I here.

439
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,586
We created the store ourselves.
- Okay.

440
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:26,023
- Oh, we offer vintage finds,
knick-knacks, and antiques.

441
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,292
- Colorful Re-presentations?

442
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,795
- Oh, wow.
I really read into that.

443
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,631
- We're Yuletown's best spot
for recycled baubles,

444
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,199
treasures, and tokens.

445
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,634
- Well, maybe don't
say that word.

446
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,836
- We do great business.

447
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,339
Plus, we check all
the boxes around here.

448
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,773
- Okay, so you know,
I'm confused again.

449
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,876
- We got a lot of fragile items.

450
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,714
- For example, this right here.

451
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,850
Very special. A real beaut.

452
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:57,922
- [wondrous, mysterious music]

453
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,292
- What's her beef
with snow globes?

454
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:04,595
- I do not know.

455
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,430
- PERCY: Holly?
Ready to go?

456
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,835
- Oh. Um, yup. Ready.

457
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,370
- Well, thank you
for stopping by.

458
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,971
- We'll see you around town.

459
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,307
- Look for us at the festival.
Or in a large crowd somewhere.

460
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,042
- [laughter]

461
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,711
- Speaking of crowds, coming
to the Bonfire Festival?

462
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,247
- No, I'll have the sale
locked down way before that.

463
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,882
I just want to get
back to the city.

464
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,951
And I certainly don't
want any more dealings

465
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,319
with Frank Clüster...

466
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:31,455
- FRANK: Percy! New York.

467
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,425
- Hi, Frank.
Well, this is me.

468
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,495
Back to the grindstone.
I'll speak to you later.

469
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:38,896
[chuckles]

470
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:43,567
- Hey, give my regards to Ann.
So, New York.

471
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,403
What do you think of our
little Christmas market?

472
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,471
Everything up to
industry standards?

473
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,806
- If by industry standards,

474
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,409
you mean available coffee,
then no, not quite.

475
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,911
But, I'm taking in the sights.

476
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,746
- While you're at it,
take in a deep breath.

477
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,782
- Oh, my breathing is just fine.

478
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,617
I have plenty of
meditation apps for that.

479
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,085
I don't...
- Apps?

480
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,621
Ha! There's nothing like
mountain air to help you relax.

481
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,656
- Will you stop
telling me to relax?

482
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,758
Some of us find being
connected to the real world

483
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,960
more important than...
sorry, do you hear that?

484
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,629
- [slow, cutesy
Christmassy march]

485
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,597
- So it's not real work
unless you're stuck at a desk,

486
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,566
glued to a computer?
- I'd rather be at a desk

487
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:16,934
than living due north
of Santa's arseho...

488
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,569
Sorry, it's
really distracting.

489
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,504
It's like a plugging pizzicato.

490
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,206
- Pizza-what?
- Pizzicato.

491
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,742
It's like instrument plucking...

492
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,777
Never mind.
Lord, it's relentless.

493
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,612
- Oh, you mean Marty's band?

494
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:31,615
- [slow, cutesy
Christmassy march]

495
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,217
- HOLLY: Sorry, do you
mind keeping it down?

496
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,252
We're just trying to talk here.

497
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,888
- Sorry, Marty.

498
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,024
Well, anyway, I'm headed to
the Ginger People Festival.

499
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,027
My aunts said that
you offered to help.

500
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,731
- Oh, so I did.
- Well, come on.

501
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,165
Seems like you could
use a little sugar.

502
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,606
- [plays end of tune]

503
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:58,309
- Naked cookies coming through!

504
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,677
[laughs] Ooh, Frank!

505
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,645
- Hey.
- Holly, you made it!

506
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,047
- Wouldn't miss it.

507
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:08,052
Careful!
This skirt is Gucc...

508
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,188
gee, what a lovely tradition
you all have here.

509
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,624
- Hey, here you go.

510
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,594
- [dog barks]
- Aw, hey, boy!

511
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:17,995
- Go on, get!

512
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,564
This dog has just been
following me everywhere.

513
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,633
- You're all right,

whose husband

ditched out on the family,

00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,078
and now you're here to
meet up with a single dad

whose wife
ditched out on his family,

599

so you can blend both
families together by Christmas?

600
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,650
- You came to run a
Christmas children's chorus

601

and find your own voice
in the process?

602

into town by accident,

603

and won't remember your
identity 'til Christmas morning?

604

here for the winter,

605
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,995
but he's secretly a prince
of a small Slavic nation.

606
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,230

the owner of a locket you found

hidden away in a
Christmas ornament.

608
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,500
- That's locked
inside a music box.

609
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,836
- That's been hidden away
in your attic for 40 years.

610
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,005
- No.
- BOTH: Oh.

leaves one thing.

ruggedly handsome ex-husband.

00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,479
But that's pretty rare
for this time of year.

00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,948
- It is.
- No, it's none of that.

attractive, successful,

Yuletown at Christmastime?

make any sense.

We're all family.

["better" echoes]

686
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:32,629
- So you see, that's why
I'm not one for Christmas.

687
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:38,869
- Hm. So that's why
she's such a raging bitch.

688
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,605
- Ah, so, if someone could
just point me to the gym,

689
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:44,007
I've got some
feelings to work off.

690
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,510
- Gym!
[laughs hysterically]

691
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,912
- Don't tell me
there's not a gym here.

692
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:52,349
- Oh, Frank!
- Oh, hello.

693
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,618
- Holly would like to get
some physical fitness.

694
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,387
Do we know of a
nearby gymnasium?

695
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,022
- Gym?

696
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,824
If you're looking
for a challenge,

697
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,627
you could join me at the
Yuletown Wood Chopping Contest.

698
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:06,263
You'll get all the
exercise you need.

699
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,831
- Wood chopping?
No, no.

700
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,366
I need a real workout.

701
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,902
My heated cycling class
combines cardio with light reps

702
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,537
and a rigorous core component.

703
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,372
- Well, let's see how high
that heart rate gets

704
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,775
after a couple of swings
on old Mary here.

705
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,310
- You named your axe?

706
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,112
- FRANK: Strongest gal
I've ever known.

707
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,648
And she's the sharpest
tool in the shed.

708
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,483
I'll bet she'll give
your fancy fitness class

709
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:27,918
a run for its money.
What do you say?

710
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,856
- Well, all right, Mary.

711
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,758
- Well, let's go.

712
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,727
- I think I'm gonna
make a bacon smoothie.

713
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,566
- Thanks, everyone,
for coming out!

714
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:46,036
As mayor of Yuletown, it's my
job to kick off this year's

715
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,771
Lumberjack Contest!

716
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,973
- [cheers and applause]

717
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,909
- Get her, Frank.
- Ahhh!

718
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,511
Thanks, Mayor.

719
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,313
Uh, well, we actually have
a special guest with us today.

720
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:57,781
Everybody, this is Holly.

721
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:58,949
- [cheers and applause]

722
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,984
- All the way from
New York City!

723
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,419
- Holly!

724
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,488
Huh, and you're drawing
the smile on Santa, eh?

725
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,723
I hear you're quite the talent.

726
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:09,993
- Well, thanks.
It's really just a curved line.

727
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:12,396
- Oh!
- Well...

728
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,865
- Wait, are you Canadian?
- What?

729
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:17,968
[overblown Canadian accent]
No, "sore-y," Holly, no.

730
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,638
I...I'm super American.
Uh, I grew up right here,

731
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,909
just up the road in
this very postal code.

732
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,344
Take her away, Frank.

733
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:28,945
- All right!

734
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,448

738
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,298
- How aboot it, Holly?

739
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,500
Your turn! Have at her!

740
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,468
- [cheers and applause]

741
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,669
- [laughs giddily]

742
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,140
- How hard can this be?

743
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,675
- [grunts]

744
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,777
- Been there!
- Shake it off.

745
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,215
- [gasping]

746
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:06,450
- Sorry.

747
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:09,152
- Just breathe, breathe.

748
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,654
- One more time.

749
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,591

750
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,493
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
careful, there.

751
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,362
We don't need a
headless holiday this year.

752
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:19,963
- [laughter]

753
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,998
- All right, all right, this
is a lot harder than it looks.

754
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,835
- Okay, so, it's all
about the grip, all right?

755
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:29,940
So, yeah, one hand here, and
then this hand here, all right?

756
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:33,043
And then you wanna draw your
arms back and just lean back

757
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:36,513
against my broad chest.
And...

758
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,015

make you work up a sweat.

760
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,258
- Yeah. Yeah, how's your
heart rate now?

761
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,662
- Um, I...I think
it's in the zone.

762
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:55,365
- Can I walk you
back to the inn?

763
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,033
- I'd like that.

764
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,170

00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:08,445
- Um...no. No,
I don't need to take that.

767
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,215
Come on, I'll race you
to the cocoa stand.

768
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,217
- Oh, you're on.

769
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,153
- Oh, can't you at least wait
until after the holidays?

770
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,621
It's the annual strudel rush.

771
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:20,390
Just give us one
more week, fellas!

772
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,992
Oh, not even a word!

773
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,927
- HOLLY: Bam! Next thing
I know, I made firewood.

774
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,629
I didn't even have
to buy it at a store.

775
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:28,965
- Well, let me get you
a quenching hot cocoa.

776
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,567
Oh, Hildy, what's this?

777
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,235
Where are they going
with our dough machine?

778
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,603
- Oh, it's nothing, dear.

779
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,106
The machine was acting up,
and so I sent it away...

780
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,741
for repairs.

781
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,309
- But how will we
make the strudel rush?

782
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,844
- Oh, don't worry.

783
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,346
We'll do what
Clüsterfünkes always do.

784
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,382
We'll funk it up
the old-fashioned way.

785
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:46,850
We'll make the strudel by hand.

786
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:49,286
- [gasps] Ooh,
won't that be slow?

787
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:50,954
- Oh, uh, no. It's great.

788
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:53,290
Uncle Gerhard
Clüsterfünke always said,

789
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,992
"There's no rush on
Christmas magic."

790
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:04,167
- Yes, but as Great Aunt Gertie
Clüsterfünke used to say,

791
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:07,437
"Slow hands make
Satan's pastries."

792
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,110
- Uh, this could just be the
lumberjack endorphins talking,

793
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,712
but if you don't mind me saying,

794
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,581
maybe your cooking
could stay old fashioned,

795
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,282
but the business
side of things could run

796
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,884
a little more smoothly.

797
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,586
- BOTH: Huh?
- HOLLY: I can't help it.

798
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,387
Whenever I see room for
a business improvement,

799
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,956
I have to speak up.

00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:29,125

- Oh, girls, follow me!

803

If you lose the fountain pens
and the rotary dial phone,

804
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,702
you could expedite things
at reception considerably.

00:46:55,446 --> 00:47:00,016
Well...there is one thing.

1026
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:02,585
Uh, it's silly.

1027
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:05,087
- What? You can tell me.
What is it?

1028
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:09,825
- I haven't shared
this with many people.

1029
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,429
But, see, every year,

1030
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:17,433
I am the one who lights
Santa's bonfire.

1031
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:19,735
And it is a big deal.

1032
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:22,038
And this place
has given me so much.

1033
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,009
But recently this...
aah, this is humiliating.

1034
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:31,480
Recently I...I haven't
been able to light that match.

1035
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:36,152
But the mayor's
giving me one more chance.

1036
00:47:36,154 --> 00:47:41,490
And I...I wanna make things right
for myself and for Yuletown.

1037
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:44,193
So that, and...

1038
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,964
I would also love a girlfriend.

1039
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:51,234
What about you?
Do you have a special someone?

1040
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:56,305
- Me? Well, I guess I'm kind
of dating my job these days.

1041
00:47:56,307 --> 00:48:01,911
But my job doesn't know how
to drive a horse and carriage.

1042
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:04,580
- That old thing?
[laughs]

- Ah, look! A shooting star!
Make a wish.

1046
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:24,033
Bonfire. Girlfriend.

1047
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:27,470
- I wish I could contain
all of this Christmas wonder

1048
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:31,340
and just hold it in my pocket.

1049
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:35,511
- Like this?

1050
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:38,347
- How did you know?

1051
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:41,017
- Know what?

1052
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,518
- Oh, nothing.

1053
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,290
I guess I'll just chalk
it up to Christmas magic.

1054
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:52,161
- [Christmassy
music intensifies]

1055
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:56,032
- [string snaps]
- Oh, dang it!

1056
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:58,668
Frank, can we go?
You said we'd be done at 7:00.

1057
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,870
- Yeah, sorry. Sorry, guys.

1058
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:06,609
I guess we should get going.

1059
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:12,048
- [joyful Christmassy music]

1060
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,924
- Well! Here she is.

1061
00:49:21,926 --> 00:49:26,228
- Chance?
What are you doing here?

1062
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,563
- What kind of welcome is that?

1063
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:29,198
- Chance, I don't understand.

1064
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,300
Why are you here?
We broke up.

1065
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,837
- I'm here to save you from
this backwood boondoggle, babe.

1066
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:37,206
I miss you. Besides,
you hate the country.

1067
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,208
- Well, maybe it's
growing on me.

1068
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,710
- Babe, I know you.

1069
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:42,545
Stuck in some snowbound
snoresville with inbred hicks,

1070
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,047
no cell phone receptch?
That ain't your bag.

1071
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:46,716
- Well, I'm not here
to take in the sights.

1072
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:48,351
I'm here to buy the inn.

1073
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:50,720
The plan is to convert it to a
golf resort, conference center,

1074
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:54,857
and indoor marina.
- Oh Holly, you are amazing.

1075
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:56,058
- FRANK: Holly, you forgot
your...

1076
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,426
- Oh!
- Scarf.

1077
00:49:57,428 --> 00:50:00,396
- Frank, hi. I, um...

1078
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:03,232
- Oh, I...I see I'm interrupting.

1079
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:04,467
- HOLLY: Oh, oh, no, no.

1080
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:07,737
Frank, I...well, um...
well, uh, this is...

1081
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:09,739
- Chancington
Winterthrope the Fifth.

1082
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:14,643
- And, um, and Chance,
this is Frank Clüsterfünke.

1083
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,112
- Clüsterfünke, huh?

1084
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:17,947
Oh, this must be the person
you're buying the inn from.

1085
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,248
Hiya, guy.

1086
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,318
- Wait, Frank, no, no.
Chance, we're...I...I mean, I...

1087
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,123
- Ah, so that's what you were
up to, spending time with me.

1088
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:32,328
Anything for a sale, I guess.
Huh, New York?

1089
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,330
- Frank, wait!

1090

- [doorbell rings]
- [ornament breaks]

1091
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:40,770
- Chance, I really wish you
had told me you were coming.

1092
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:43,706
- Holly, baby, didn't
you get my texts?

1093
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,408
I took a 20-hour detour
just to get here.

1094
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,609
My driver is pissed.

1095
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,778
He's gotta sleep
in the car tonight.

1096
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,113
Just passing through on the
way to the family compound.

1097
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:52,415
- Of course.

1098
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:54,049
Winterthrope Manor
is just north of here.

1099
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,520
- Yeah, and it might be Granny
Winterthorpe's last Christmas.

1100
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:58,721
She's hoping the whole family

1101
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,022
could be together for
the holiday.

1102
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:02,825
And I was hoping that
you might join me.

1103
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:05,995
- What? This is
quite the turnaround.

1104
00:51:05,997 --> 00:51:08,330
- Babe, hear me out.
I've been thinking.

1105
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,699
I know it's something you
say I don't do very often.

1106
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:12,067
And you're right.
But here's the thing...

1107
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:17,506
- Chancington, this
is a lot to process.

1108
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:20,109
I just need to get some rest.

1109
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:23,479
I promised I would paint the
smile for the Santa bonfire

1110
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,247
tomorrow morning.

1111
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,016
- Look at you!

1112
00:51:27,018 --> 00:51:29,318
- [laughs]

1113
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,153
- I'll check in
with you tomorrow.

1114
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:32,855
I wanna stick around anyway.

1115
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:35,524
My hunting app says there are
still two great horned owls

1116
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:37,526
left in the area.
It wouldn't be Christmas

1117
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:41,096
if I didn't bag one
of those bad boys pronto.

1118
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,933
- Good night, Chance.

1119
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,070

- [phone rings]

1124
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:06,021
- I'll get it!

1125
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:09,191
Clüsterfünke Inn.
Oh, let me check, sir.

1126
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:13,362
Um, well, I am afraid
we are all booked up for

1127
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:15,197
the Santa's Bonfire Festival.

1128
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,735
But after that, we...we have,
um, lots of availability.

1129
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:21,170
Thanks for calling.

1130
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:26,775
No bookings January
through November?

- [sneaky music]

1132
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:38,787
- 39.17 due to
Nutmeg, Incorporated?

1133
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:42,758
Peppermint Wholesalers, $15,340?

1134
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,098
Wow. That's a lot of peppermint.

1135
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:56,205
- [music intensifies]

1136
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,881
- What a Christmas
Clüsterfünke...

1137
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:11,387
- There's the girl
I'm looking for!

1138
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:12,588
- Chance.

1139
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,356
I, um...I thought
you were owl hunting.

1140
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,392
- No luck yet.

1141
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:18,961
What, they got you working at
ye olde country inn now, huh?

1142
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:20,763
- [dings bell]
- Come on, step out with me.

1143
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:22,965
Show me the town,
all three blocks of it.

1144
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:24,700
We'll get you a cup of coffee.

1145
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,336
- Chance, I have news for you.
There's no coffee in this town.

1146
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:28,570
- Well, they haven't met

1147
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,439
Chancington Winterthrope
the Fifth.

1148
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:31,573
- Yeah.

1149
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:33,042
- Come on, watch
me work my magic.

1150
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:35,878
- I'm busy.
Like, really busy.

1151
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,148
- I know you want that coffee...
- Ugh, okay.

1152
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:42,318
Coffee would help keep
me alert for business.

1153
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,020
And you seem to know how to
get the best of everything.

1154
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:47,356
- Whoa-ho, yes! Come on.

1155
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:49,258
- Now if only you could
learn how to keep it.

1156
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,868
- I told you there's
no coffee in this town.

1157
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,071
- I can't believe I
didn't get my way.

1158
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:04,273
Such a weird feeling.

1159
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,542
This is more carbs
than I've had all year.

1160
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:08,410
How are you even
coping in this town?

1161
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,412
- What do you mean?

1162
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,947
- Holly, don't tell me
you're planning on

1163
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:14,383
spending Christmas here.
- Well...

1164
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:15,351
- This is your speed?

1165
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:17,186
The girl who can
run up a $10,000 tab

1166
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:19,188
at Louboutin
in 10 minutes flat.

1167
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,557
And I know you can't
live without your coffee.

1168
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,393
- True.
- [sighs]

1169
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:26,095
- What?

1170
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:29,598
- It's just...
the Holly I know,

1171
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,034
she'd make heads roll
to get whatever she needed.

1172
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:35,504
And here you are,
settling for less.

1173
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:37,740
- Chance, maybe...

1174
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:42,478
settling for less
is settling for more.

1175
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,246
- That makes no sense.

1176
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,849
- Look, I'm needed
at Evergreen Square.

1177
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:49,385
I'll catch up with
you later, Chance.

1178
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:53,255
- I'm still gonna get
you that cup of coffee.

1179
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:54,490
- Okay.

1180
00:54:58,496 --> 00:54:59,862
- [indistinct chatter]

1181
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:02,131
- Ah! Hey, Miss Girl
Best Friend!

1182
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:03,866
- Hey.
- How are you doing?

1183
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:06,502
Heard you lost a couple toes.

1184
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:08,837
- Did you also hear that
my ex showed up last night?

1185
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:11,774
And that I had an
amazing date with Frank?

1186
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:14,309
- So you're torn
between yesterday's news

1187
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,879
and a hunk of burnin'
Clüsterfünke?

1188
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:18,047
Honey, you know
I'm gonna tell you

1189
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:19,882
to go for that lumberjack d...
- Percy!

1190
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:23,018
- [coughs]

01:03:59,953 --> 01:04:02,787
I get it.
We can make this work.

1361
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:04,923
But babe, with money, you
could do whatever you want.

1362
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:07,225
Buy a bunch of
dumpy inns, fix 'em up.

1363
01:04:07,227 --> 01:04:11,096
Clüsterfünke Inn could be
the first of your whole empire.

1364
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:15,634
Oh, hey, King Cornhole!
I'll be back in a few hours.

1365
01:04:15,636 --> 01:04:19,070
Want another crack at that owl.
Chance out.

1366
01:04:22,376 --> 01:04:24,209
- Frank, I was wondering when...

1367
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:26,945
I mean, I just wanted to say
that I've thought about our time

1368
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:32,617
in the clearing a lot.
- Really?

1369
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,152
'Cause I was all set
to apologize for making

1370
01:04:34,154 --> 01:04:37,222
assumptions, but...now I
can see that you don't care

1371
01:04:37,224 --> 01:04:40,091
a flying Christmas fig about me.

1372
01:04:40,093 --> 01:04:42,494
You just wanna buy up the inn
with some guy who's not worth

1373
01:04:42,496 --> 01:04:44,496
the coal in a
Christmas stocking!

1374
01:04:44,498 --> 01:04:46,498
All the while pretending
to care about me

1375
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,033
and my simple-minded aunts.

1376
01:04:48,035 --> 01:04:49,734
- No, Frank, that's
Chancington...

1377
01:04:49,736 --> 01:04:51,603
- Well, let me tell you
something about my aunts.

1378
01:04:51,605 --> 01:04:53,038
They may not be the smartest.

1379
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,174
And they may not
be so good at math.

1380
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:58,109
They may be only two to
three years older than me,

1381
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,478
and they may have no business
sense and order thousands and

1382
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,579
thousands of dollars' worth
of peppermint

1383
01:05:01,581 --> 01:05:03,114
for no obvious reason.

1384
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:06,518
But they are decent
and loving and...

1385
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,453
they have more integrity
in their pinky toe

1386
01:05:08,455 --> 01:05:10,555
than you have in your...

1387
01:05:10,557 --> 01:05:11,956
Oh...
- Yeah.

1388
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,192
- I shouldn't have brought
up pinky toes to you.

1389
01:05:14,194 --> 01:05:17,562
Anyway, shoot!
- No, Frank, don't do this.

1390
01:05:17,564 --> 01:05:20,265
What I felt under
the stars was real.

1391
01:05:20,267 --> 01:05:21,599
- [scoffs]

1392
01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:23,435
- I'm still carrying
the magic with me.

1393
01:05:23,437 --> 01:05:25,036
We really connected!

1394
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:26,905
- FRANK: The only thing
you want to connect to is this

1395
01:05:26,907 --> 01:05:28,940
property, and none
of it is for sale.

1396
01:05:28,942 --> 01:05:30,375
None of it.
- [gasps]

1397
01:05:30,377 --> 01:05:31,609
- Oh!
- [glass shatters]

1398
01:05:31,611 --> 01:05:33,912
- [screams]
- I didn't mean to do that.

1399
01:05:34,815 --> 01:05:37,615
Sometimes I think I
just care too much!

1400
01:05:37,617 --> 01:05:41,519
Why does love always
shatter...or burn!!?

1401
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,823
- [intense melodramatic
music]

1402
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:47,892
- I guess I just wasn't cut
out for Christmas magic.

1403
01:05:47,894 --> 01:05:50,028
- So you are still
after the inn.

1404
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:52,130
- We thought the makeovers
were because you liked us.

1405
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:57,268
- [sobs hysterically]

1406
01:05:57,270 --> 01:06:00,004
- Oh, well, this is terrible!
She's upset.

1407
01:06:00,006 --> 01:06:02,674
- Yes, and Frank is in...angry.
Frank is angry.

1408
01:06:02,676 --> 01:06:05,610
- Don't do this.
- Frank is so mad, though.

1409
01:06:05,612 --> 01:06:06,878
- Please.
- Well, Frank is just livid.

1410
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,179
- This isn't the time.

1411
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:12,050
- Frank is furious,
and it's just so hard...

1412
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:13,952
- No. Please stop yourself.

1413
01:06:13,954 --> 01:06:16,287
- Frank's incensed!
Frank's incensed!

1414
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:21,126

1415

1416
01:06:32,939 --> 01:06:34,973
- [angelic voice]
Holly!

1417
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,777
Honey?

1418
01:06:38,779 --> 01:06:40,979
- Who are you?

1419
01:06:40,981 --> 01:06:43,648
- Who do you think I am?

1420
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:46,551
- Mariah Carey?

1421
01:06:46,553 --> 01:06:49,387
- No. I get that a lot.

1422
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:52,257
I'm Shania Gary?

1423
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:54,526
Perhaps you've heard
my Christmas single,

1424
01:06:54,528 --> 01:06:56,594
"All I'll Have for
Christmas Is Fruit."

1425
01:06:56,596 --> 01:07:00,598
It hit number 588 on
the Billboard charts

1426
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,000
and now is heavily featured

1427
01:07:02,002 --> 01:07:05,003
on a number of late-night
juicer commercials.

1428
01:07:05,005 --> 01:07:08,306
But I'm not here to
talk about my career, baby.

1429
01:07:08,308 --> 01:07:12,177
You've summoned me.
Do you know what I symbolize?

1430
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:14,846
- An angel representing
the spirit of Christmas?

1431
01:07:14,848 --> 01:07:17,215
- Yup, that's right.

1432
01:07:17,217 --> 01:07:20,084
Tell Shania your
Christmas conundrums.

1433
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:24,088
- Oh, angel, I have made
a mess out of everything.

1434
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,924
Frank won't ever
speak to me again.

1435
01:07:25,926 --> 01:07:27,725
And I'd love to
help the sisters.

1436
01:07:27,727 --> 01:07:30,862
They're in over the heads, but
they'll never trust me either.

1437
01:07:30,864 --> 01:07:32,497
Gosh, I don't belong here.

1438
01:07:32,499 --> 01:07:35,934
I should just go
back to the city.

1439
01:07:35,936 --> 01:07:39,037
Tell me, angel,
what should I do?

1440
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,806
- ♪ Follow your heart ♪

1441
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:45,410
♪ And when you find
that special someone ♪

1442
01:07:45,412 --> 01:07:48,746
♪ Never let him go-o-o ♪

1443
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:50,882
Does that sound right?

1444
01:07:50,884 --> 01:07:53,685
- But how do I know
if he's the one?

1445
01:07:53,687 --> 01:07:56,154
- Just follow the
signs, sugar plum.

1446
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:59,657
- [tinkling, angelic music]

1447
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:03,461
- Wow, is that
meaningful snowfall?

1448
01:08:03,463 --> 01:08:05,930
- It sure is.

1449
01:08:05,932 --> 01:08:09,334
If this were a drinking game
of magical Christmas moves,

1450
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:11,302
people would be hammered.

1451
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:14,138
I myself have been
tipplin' since noon.

1452
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:18,309
Cranbermarmosas.
'Tis the season!

- [cell phone vibrating]

1458
01:08:36,763 --> 01:08:38,396
- Hello?

1459
01:08:38,398 --> 01:08:39,964
- I've been waiting
for you to circle back.

1460
01:08:39,966 --> 01:08:42,166
What sea are you on?
Conquer? Congeal?

1461
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:43,768
- Well, there's a
lien on the property.

1462
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:45,770
The sisters can't stay afloat.

1463
01:08:45,772 --> 01:08:47,972
Hildy knows about it
and Marga's in the dark.

1464
01:08:47,974 --> 01:08:50,074
- Calculate,
confuse...perfect for us.

1465
01:08:50,076 --> 01:08:53,144
- But it's not perfect for them.

1466
01:08:53,146 --> 01:08:54,612
I don't feel right about trying

1467
01:08:54,614 --> 01:08:56,180
to buy the inn out from
under them.

1468
01:08:56,182 --> 01:08:58,449
- Holly, the board wants to wake
up Christmas morning and know

1469
01:08:58,451 --> 01:08:59,717
that the inn is ours

1470
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:02,020
and the forest is
gonna be a golf course.

1471
01:09:02,022 --> 01:09:04,389
Do not disappoint me.

1472
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,591

can I level with you?

I know I'm good at business.

1474

But there are other things
in life

1475
01:09:10,797 --> 01:09:12,497
that I want to be good at too.

1476
01:09:12,499 --> 01:09:13,698
- What crap is this?

1477
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,400
Get back to the seas of success!

1478
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:16,935

1479
01:09:16,937 --> 01:09:21,839
Here's a sea that I forgot
to put in the book: I quit!

way you turn a phrase.

Just so original.
Ready to go to Granny's?

- What? No.

1487
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:43,127
Chance, I'm not going
to Winterthrope Manor.

1488
01:09:43,129 --> 01:09:44,796
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1489
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:48,032
- And I'm tired of trying to be
someone that I don't wanna be.

1490
01:09:48,034 --> 01:09:49,801
- Are you kidding me?

1491
01:09:49,803 --> 01:09:51,235
You're gonna hang
around East Clusterdump

1492
01:09:51,237 --> 01:09:54,372
and become an innkeeper?
Babe, babe, that's not you.

1493
01:09:54,374 --> 01:09:59,410
- Well, maybe you don't
know who me is, babe.

1494
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:01,012
- All right.

1495
01:10:01,014 --> 01:10:04,716
I wasn't gonna do
this here, but fine.

01:10:04,718 --> 01:10:07,051

Chance, what...no.

1497
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:08,920
Wait, it's...

1498
01:10:08,922 --> 01:10:10,688
Oh, it's really beautiful.

1499
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:13,391
Oh, no, no, this
is not what I want!

1500

This is a 14-karat

What, I can buy you
anything for Christmas.

1503
01:10:24,237 --> 01:10:25,937
- Chance, all of my life,

1504
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:30,108
I've worked to buy things
to make me happy.

1505
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:32,210
But being in this town
has made me realize

1506
01:10:32,212 --> 01:10:34,912
I don't care about things.

1507
01:10:34,914 --> 01:10:36,214
And Christmas
isn't about things.

1508
01:10:36,216 --> 01:10:40,451
It's about a feeling.

1509
01:10:40,453 --> 01:10:42,553
- The only thing I'm
feeling is confused.

1511

Oh, and this time, I mean it.

1513

How are people gonna check out
after the Bonfire Festival?

1518
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:14,635
- They're taking Great
Uncle Engelbert's desk?

1519
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,437
That's a family heirloom!

1520
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,107
- Not anymore, Marga.
I took out a reverse mortgage

1521
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:21,075
on all of Engelbert's
beloved woodwork.

1522
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:23,378
- You what?
You can't just take this.

1523
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:26,514
That's it? You're not
even gonna say anything?

1524
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:29,784
- They can't speak, Marga.
It'll cost too much.

1525
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,420
- Well, I burned the strudel

I'm a man of simple pleasures,

1694
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:25,536
and I'm a man
who knows his wood.

1695
01:20:25,538 --> 01:20:27,004
- [indistinct chatter]

1696
01:20:27,006 --> 01:20:30,975
- I was also a man who
judged a book by its cover.

1697
01:20:30,977 --> 01:20:36,180
But recently, I met someone
who taught me that sometimes,

1698
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:42,086
what you think is one thing
can actually be something else.

1699
01:20:43,155 --> 01:20:46,557
Like how wood is
also a what if word,

1700
01:20:46,559 --> 01:20:49,693
like would you like
to buy some wood?

1701
01:20:49,695 --> 01:20:51,629
- CROWD: Oh!

1702
01:20:51,631 --> 01:20:55,432
- Two woods. Two meanings.

1703
01:20:57,103 --> 01:21:01,939
What I'm trying to say is a
person is defined by her heart,

1704
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:05,843
and I don't think heart
has two spellings.

1705
01:21:05,845 --> 01:21:07,311
Well, even if it does, Holly,

1706
01:21:07,313 --> 01:21:11,215
your heart is as big
as I have ever known.

1707
01:21:11,217 --> 01:21:13,017
And I have got this
"Hair-mess" scarf

1708
01:21:13,019 --> 01:21:15,185
on my head wound to prove it.

1709
01:21:15,187 --> 01:21:17,688
[chuckles]
- [laughs] Frank!

1710
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:20,524
You know, I've also
learned a lot recently.

1711
01:21:20,526 --> 01:21:23,694
I've learned that
fancy restaurants,

1712
01:21:23,696 --> 01:21:25,963
and the best seats
in the theater,

1713
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:28,832
and even my double
espresso with oat foam...

1714
01:21:28,834 --> 01:21:30,367
- You said this already.
You told me this before.

1715
01:21:30,369 --> 01:21:31,935
- Wait, did I...
- Remember, on the stairs?

1716
01:21:31,937 --> 01:21:36,106
- I'm sorry. You're right.

1717
01:21:36,108 --> 01:21:40,311
Well, I guess we both
learned a lot recently.

1718
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:43,580
But I think the biggest
thing that we've learned...

1719
01:21:43,582 --> 01:21:46,684
always pack sensible shoes...
- Some rich people are nice.

1720
01:21:46,686 --> 01:21:49,086
- No?
- BOTH: Don't...

1721
01:21:49,088 --> 01:21:50,421
- ...gesticulate too wildy...

1722
01:21:50,423 --> 01:21:51,989
- ...wander off with a
phone in subzero weather.

1723
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,924
- ...or you might knock
over a snow globe.

1724
01:21:53,926 --> 01:21:57,895
- [crowd whispering]

1725
01:21:57,897 --> 01:22:01,799
- BOTH: Nothing says Christmas
like love and family.

1726
01:22:01,801 --> 01:22:04,935
- [crowd awws]

1727
01:22:04,937 --> 01:22:08,472
- Just a moment!
Just a moment, everyone.

1728
01:22:08,474 --> 01:22:12,910
My name is Cornelius Windmere
of the Windmere Corp.

1729
01:22:12,912 --> 01:22:15,679
And I've just made an offer on
the Clüsterfünke Inn to turn it

1730
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:20,684
into 1900 acres
of full-service resorts,

1731
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:22,052
an indoor beach,

1732
01:22:22,054 --> 01:22:24,922
and a parking facility
that will offer jobs

1733
01:22:24,924 --> 01:22:27,358
to everyone in the entire town.

1734
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,261
So now you have something
extra special to celebrate

1735
01:22:31,263 --> 01:22:32,696
this Christmas.

1736
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,131
- Cool!
- [indistinct chatter]

1737
01:22:34,133 --> 01:22:37,668
- MARGA: Wait? What?
We're...we're selling the inn?

1738
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:39,269
- Oh, Marga, I had no choice.

1739
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:41,605
- But, no, this can't be true.

1740
01:22:41,607 --> 01:22:43,474
- Now, wait just a minute.

1741
01:22:43,476 --> 01:22:46,377
The Clüsterfünke Mail Order
Strudel webpage just went live,

1742
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:50,481
and the GIF is a meme and
it's trending on retweets.

1743
01:22:50,483 --> 01:22:53,384
We've already got 27 orders
for Christmas strudels

1744
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:57,454
and eight more orders for
President's Day strudels.

1745
01:22:57,456 --> 01:23:01,125
These strudel orders
can float you year round.

1746
01:23:01,127 --> 01:23:04,194
- Holly, if we went
into business together,

1747
01:23:04,196 --> 01:23:06,196
we'd get you as
part of the bargain.

1748
01:23:06,198 --> 01:23:09,933
- And that is worth a fortune.

1749
01:23:09,935 --> 01:23:14,872
- Everyone! Everyone!
I have wonderful news.

1750
01:23:14,874 --> 01:23:18,642
I'm gonna manage
the Clüsterfünke Inn.

1751
01:23:18,644 --> 01:23:20,310
We'll merge my business know-how

1752
01:23:20,312 --> 01:23:22,346
with their old-fashioned
traditions.

1753
01:23:22,348 --> 01:23:24,815
- It just makes sense!
- It makes sense!

1754
01:23:24,817 --> 01:23:26,950
- As you all know,
I wrote the book,

1755
01:23:26,952 --> 01:23:30,988
"The Seven Seas Solution
to Success in Business."

1756
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:32,222
- [confused chatter]

1757
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,658
- But there's one C
word that I forgot.

1758
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:38,162
A C word that's been
thrown at me my entire life.

1759
01:23:38,164 --> 01:23:42,499
And I've chosen to hold
my head high and ignore it.

1760
01:23:42,501 --> 01:23:46,336
But I think it's time for me
to take back that C word.

1761
01:23:46,338 --> 01:23:51,074
And that word is...Christmas.

1762
01:23:54,013 --> 01:23:55,779
And I'm gonna help Yuletown!

1763
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:58,048
'Cause we're like a family!

1764
01:23:58,050 --> 01:24:01,318
A family in the form of
a municipal township!

1765
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,753
- Yup!

1766
01:24:02,755 --> 01:24:06,790
- Percy, we sure could use a
coffee shop, and you're our man.

1767
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,292
Yes!

1768
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:10,794
And to attract even more
tourists in the off season,

1769
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:14,298
we're gonna feature something
that a very special woodsman

1770
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,401
taught me: the
Lumberjack Workout.

1771
01:24:17,403 --> 01:24:23,574
Axe swinging, sawing,
lifting trees.

1772
01:24:23,576 --> 01:24:25,242
It really worked for me.

1773
01:24:25,244 --> 01:24:27,277
- FRANK: That's my girl!

1774
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:30,347
- Well, how about that? Darn!

1775
01:24:30,349 --> 01:24:32,182
I was gonna stay around and
check out the world-famous

1776
01:24:32,184 --> 01:24:35,018
Bonfire Festival.
- I could show you around.

1777
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:39,990
- Deck my halls!
Who's this Christmas spirit?

1778
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:43,293
- Hey!
Why isn't the bonfire lit?

1779
01:24:43,295 --> 01:24:44,761
How will Santa know
where Yuletown is if

1780
01:24:44,763 --> 01:24:46,363
his bonfire isn't lit?

1781
01:24:46,365 --> 01:24:49,466
- He is right!
We have to light the bonfire!

1782
01:24:49,468 --> 01:24:52,503
Christmas will be
ruined if we don't!!!

1783
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:56,106
- Christmas will never
be ruined on my account.

1784
01:24:56,108 --> 01:24:58,609
Let's get this baby started.

1785
01:24:58,611 --> 01:25:02,012
- Frank, your head wound!

1786
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:04,147
- [grunts]
- [gasping]

1787
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:06,416
- FRANK: I got a fire to light!

1788
01:25:06,418 --> 01:25:09,520
And this time, I'm
not getting burned.

1789
01:25:13,726 --> 01:25:15,959
- [gasps] Oh...

1790
01:25:15,961 --> 01:25:20,330
- [determined music]

1791
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,634
- We believe in you, Frank.
- Come on, Frank.

1792
01:25:23,636 --> 01:25:25,168
- You can do it, Frank.

1793
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:26,603
- [Blitzen barks]

1794
01:25:28,841 --> 01:25:31,341
- [music turns sad]

1795
01:25:31,343 --> 01:25:33,510
- Frank?

1796
01:25:33,512 --> 01:25:36,647
Sometimes you just
need the perfect match.

1797
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:44,488
- [music turns warm, uplifting]

1798
01:25:50,462 --> 01:25:52,563
- [fire rumbling]

1799
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:55,899

01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,702
