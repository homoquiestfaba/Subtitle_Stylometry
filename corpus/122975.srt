1
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,600
John Wilson.
A violent man given to violent action.

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,700
Some ascribed his wild and troubled life
to his personal mania for self-destruction.

3
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,100
These generalizations always seemed
inaccurate to me.

4
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,800
That's why I had to write all this about John.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,500
A brilliant, screw-you-all type filmmaker...

6
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,200
...who continually violated all the unwritten
laws of the motion picture business...

7
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,500
...yet had the magic, almost divine ability
to always land on his feet.

8
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,500
Mr. Verrill?
Hello, l'm Miss Wilding.

9
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,400
-How are you?
-Did you have a good flight?

10
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,400
-Wonderful. Thank you.
-Mr. Wilson is expecting you.

11
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,700
-How was Switzerland?
-Switzerland? Fine.

12
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
Eggerton Gardens, please.

13
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,400
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
-l thought he was at Claridge's.
-He was.

15
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,400
He's got a house now.

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,200
One of his society friends loaned it to him.

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,400
You know what John is.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,200
l mean, Mr. Wilson.

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Hello, George. This is Mr. Verrill.
ls Mr. Wilson up yet?

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,100
Oh, yes. He's been up hours.
Been riding.

21
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,200
He's having his breakfast now.

22
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Come in.

23
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,800
Mr. Verrill is here, Mr. Wilson.

24
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,100
-Pete!
-Johnny!

25
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,700
For God's sake!

26
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
-How the hell are you?
-All right.

27
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,300
Well, you're looking good, kid.

28
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,700
-What have you been up to?
-Skiing and sitting in the sun.

29
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,100
lsn't that swell?

30
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,600
-l missed you, kid.
-l missed you too, John.

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,900
-Same old Pete.
-Yeah.

32
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,800
-Care for some coffee?
-l'm fine.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
-This is some joint you got.
-lsn't it?

34
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,000
-Did you get a load of the living room?
-Did l ever!

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,600
lsn't it the most hideous thing?
l'm crazy about it.

36
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Miss Wilding, you can get the hell
out of here. There's no work today.

37
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,900
Well, what do you think of this outfit?

38
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,400
Hey, that's some getup
you got there, Johnny.

39
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,800
Of course it is.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,100
Now, what about you?
What about the book?

41
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,500
l didn't get very much done on the book.

42
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,700
Why? Or would you prefer
not to talk about it?

43
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
l don't mind. l just couldn't get started.

44
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,600
An then when l did,
l got hooked up with some dame.

45
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,300
-Hell, isn't it?
-lt sure is.

46
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,100
And once it's over, you can't figure out
why it all seemed so damn important.

47
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,500
There's nothing tougher
than trying to remember...

48
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
...why you chased a dame
once you've had her.

49
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,200
Yeah, l'll say. And l didn't get
much skiing done because of her.

50
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Well, that's a shame. l think l've got
the cure for that, though: Africa.

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,100
You come down there with me
and you work on this script.

52
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,700
-You really think that's gonna help me?
-Even if it doesn't, you've got to do it.

53
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,300
There are times when you can't wonder
whether it's the right or wrong thing to do.

54
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,100
Not for guys like you and me, kid.
You just gotta pack up and go.

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,100
l gotta get started on this book.

56
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,500
lf you didn't write it before,
you weren't ready.

57
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,000
-You think so?
-l know so.

58
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,100
Well, when do you plan on leaving?

59
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,400
ln a week or 1 0 days. We'll work here
and then we'll get our shots and take off.

60
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,000
-And who's gonna be in this picture?
-We have Phil Duncan and Kay Gibson.

61
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,800
That's good. How long are you
planning on staying there?

62
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,100
Oh, four or five months.
Long enough to make a picture.

63
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,800
-And have ourselves a safari.
-Safari?

64
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,300
Yeah, haven't you ever wanted
to shoot an elephant?

65
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,200
-No, l don't think so, John.
-Well, a lion or a buffalo.

66
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,500
This is a safari, kid. The real thing.

67
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
-Who's gonna pay for all this?
-Don't worry.

68
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,100
What's your financial situation?

69
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,600
-lt remains unchanged.
-So you're broke?

70
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,900
Depends on what you call broke.
l owe a quarter million.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,600
-Quarter of a million?
-Closer to 300,000.

72
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,300
-$300,000, John, and you're not worried?
-l think about it now and then.

73
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,000
-Do you see a way out?
-This picture.

74
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
Now do you see why
l want to go to Africa?

75
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,700
l've got nothing else to lose.
Even if a lion or a buffalo gets me...

76
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,000
...my last minute on earth
will be a happy one.

77
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,300
l'll just think of my creditors when they
find out l've been eaten alive...

78
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
...and it'll all seem worthwhile.

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,700
Okay, okay, John. How about a script?

80
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
There's one around here somewhere.
We don't have a title yet.

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,700
lt's called African Trader
or African something.

82
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,300
Miss Wilding?

83
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,600
Where's a copy of that goddamned script?

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
l haven't seen it, John.

85
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,200
Then find it. What kind of a secretary
are you? What do you do all day?

86
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,100
l've been typing your letters
and answering the telephone.

87
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,100
-Balls.
-l have.

88
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,500
You were competent
when you first got here.

89
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,300
Now you just hang around all day
spying for Paul Landers.

90
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,900
lt's not true. l don't spy for anybody.
Especially Mr. Landers.

91
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,300
Find the script, then.

92
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,300
We have a meeting with Landers
and his money men in an hour.

93
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,800
Right.

94
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,500
-Paul Landers is producing this?
-That's right.

95
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,900
And you know why l agreed
to work with him again?

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
No.

97
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,900
Because it's the wrong thing to do.

98
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,300
-l'm so glad to see you, Pete.
-lt's good to see you, Paul.

99
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,700
-You can save all our lives.
-How's that?

100
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,100
-The monster. l think he's losing his mind.
-He's in fine shape.

101
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,600
You've only been with him half a day.
You don't know what he's been like.

102
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,100
He's almost killed the deal five times.

103
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,500
The only reason it's still alive
is because of me.

104
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,600
-He wants to go to Africa.
-Paul, how the hell are you?

105
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Johnny boy! Did you have a good day?
Get a lot done?

106
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,900
Hell, no. But Pete and l
did have a nice chat.

107
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,700
-What do you think of the script?
-l haven't read it yet.

108
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,700
-l think it's awfully good.
-You do?

109
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,200
Well, it's a shame you don't know
a damn thing about it.

110
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,400
-You see?
-He's always been like that.

111
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,100
No, he's worse. He's insane.

112
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,700
ln a well-ordered society,
he'd be in a straitjacket right now.

113
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,600
Where the question of color is concerned,
it's an extra expense.

114
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,900
As far as l'm concerned,
of questionable value.

115
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,300
-l quite agree.
-Well, l don't.

116
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,200
Color's worth a million dollars
at the box office.

117
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Well, that's not important.

118
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,400
What l'm trying to find out from Basil is
how much color complicates our operation.

119
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
Well, l'm afraid it does, John.

120
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,800
The camera is much heavier.
There are many more lighting problems.

121
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,500
l'm telling you, color is essential
to the success of this venture.

122
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,000
l'm not concerned with the success
of the venture at this moment.

123
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,900
l just don't want to get bogged down.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,400
-Bogged down?
-Bogged down?

125
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,800
Yes, l know how easy it is to get bogged
down with a company on location.

126
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,000
-Have you ever been bogged down, John?
-No.

127
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,300
-Then why bring it up?
-l think it's a very valid point.

128
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Well, l don't.

129
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,900
Well, of course you don't, Paul.

130
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Because while we're in Africa,
sweating and killing ourselves...

131
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,000
...you'll be in Paris sending out memos.

132
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,500
That's not true.
l'll be there in Africa with you.

133
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,100
Like hell you will.

134
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,800
lf the picture was shot in a river in England,
and the second unit sent out to Africa...

135
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,600
...then the risk of using color
would be greatly minimized.

136
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,500
-That would be with some other director.
-We have already discussed that.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh, we have, have we?

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,800
John, could l talk to you
in the bedroom for a moment?

139
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,600
-What's this bullshit about another director?
-You know l wouldn't do that to you.

140
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
You'd sell your mother
down the river to make a deal.

141
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,000
What the hell is the matter with you, John?
Do you want to kill this project?

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
No. No, l don't.

143
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,700
Then why bring up the possibility of bogging
down? You scared the bejesus out of them!

144
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,300
Then telling them that you'd quit if the
picture wasn't made in Africa. Good God!

145
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,000
lf one frame of this picture
is shot in England, l will quit.

146
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,100
But it won't be.

147
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
But you discussed it behind my back,
you son of a bitch.

148
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,800
l didn't mention it because there isn't
a chance it could be done that way.

149
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,500
You'll guarantee that, l suppose?

150
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,600
Yes, goddamn it. l guarantee it!

151
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,100
Well, your guarantee doesn't mean
a damn thing to me.

152
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,300
l'm not gonna make some fake,
crappy mess just to please you.

153
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,000
So l don't care if this picture's shot
in black and white or sepia tone...

154
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,700
...or we have to make
the whole damn thing in animation.

155
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,200
Pete and l are going to Africa.

156
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,000
-What's the effective range of this thing?
-About 1 00 yards, sir. Not much more.

157
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,700
That's plenty for your buff
and your elephant.

158
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,600
They kill them at 20 yards, kid.

159
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,100
Well, even closer than that sometimes,
so they tell me.

160
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Of course, l've never been to Africa,
but this man has.

161
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,700
Makes for invaluable reading.

162
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,300
John Taylor.
Big Game and Big Game Rifles.

163
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,900
-We'll need two of these.
-We'll take two of these rifles right here...

164
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,100
...and two of the smaller ones,
the Mannlichers 256.

165
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,500
And that's to shoot for the pot,
so to speak.

166
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,900
-And then one 1 2-gauge shotgun.
-Always a useful thing to have along, sir.

167
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,500
And cartridges, of course.

168
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,600
-How many rounds, sir?
-Two hundred. Two hundred per weapon.

169
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,200
-Planning to be away quite a while, sir.
-Yes.

170
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,600
And Sunrise Films will send you the check.

171
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,500
John! Be careful!

172
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,500
lrene. For God's sake,
what are you doing here?

173
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,800
You told me to meet you here.

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We had an appointment.
Drinks and dinner.

175
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,500
-l dressed.
-Yes.

176
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,500
Well, it plain slipped my mind.
lrene Saunders, this is Pete Verrill.

177
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Hello.

178
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,900
l admired your last book enormously.

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,200
l'm a writer too.

180
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,000
John's promised to listen to an idea
l had for a film this evening.

181
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,900
l do hope you'll join us.

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You can give me a few pointers.
One writer to another.

183
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,600
lt's about a dog. A puppy dog.
He's the hero, the star.

184
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,000
lmagine, John, over the opening credits,
we'll see Horace.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,000
Wonderful, adorable dissolves
of Horace. ln close-up. ln long shot.

186
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,300
Now, this is the part of the script
l'm not sure about.

187
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,000
The censors might cut it.
lt turns out that Horace is in heat.

188
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,000
-Horace?
-lt's a story of mistaken identity.

189
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,800
You see, Horace has a twin. A bitch.
She's called Geraldine.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,900
Now, it's she that's in heat.
lsn't that a wonderful switch?

191
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,700
We'll cut from the Hyde Park sequence,
John, to an early-morning shot of the river.

192
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,500
The river.

193
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,100
Horace is alone now. We dolly with him
as he trots slowly down a deserted street.

194
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,900
-He turns into Grosvenor--
-What are you doing here?

195
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,500
l have found a copy of the script.

196
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,800
-l hope you like it as much as l do.
-l'm sure l will.

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
Peter! Please.

198
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,100
You must hear the ending.

199
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,600
Horace is all alone. Now, we'll dolly with him
as he trots slowly down a deserted street.

200
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,300
Now, from another angle...

201
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,100
...Geraldine can be seen
coming down Brook Street.

202
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,100
She passes Claridge's,
then she enters the square.

203
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,900
Suddenly, they see each other.

204
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,700
Horace and Geraldine.

205
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,700
There isn't a human being in sight. They
race toward each other! The music swells!

206
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,800
Now, we hold the final picture
in an extreme long shot...

207
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,000
...as they meet...

208
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,700
...turn...

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,900
...and go off together.

210
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,000
They've only just begun to live.

211
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,500
Well, that's the end.

212
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
They find each other.

213
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,100
Well, isn't that something?
lsn't that something?

214
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,700
Do you really like it?

215
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,900
Well, darling, it's swell.

216
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,600
Come on, we'll talk some more.

217
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,100
Pete.

218
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,200
lf there's half as much love
in this old gal as there is talk...

219
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,700
...l may be dead in the morning.

220
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,300
Hey, Johnny.

221
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,300
-Morning.
-Morning.

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,400
You look like you've been
run through the wringer.

223
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,500
Just part of me.

224
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,900
What's happening, kid?
What do you think of the script?

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
Well, l'll tell you the truth. l like it.

226
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,900
-l like it a lot.
-Good.

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,400
lt's original, it's exciting and it's moving.
l just have one little problem with it.

228
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,500
The ending.

229
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,200
-You don't like the ending?
-No, l didn't say l don't like the ending.

230
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,500
l'm just not sure that it's the right one.

231
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,900
Let me put it in Hollywood terms.
l think it's too downbeat.

232
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,200
After everything
these two have gone through:

233
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,600
They fought the river,
tropical storms, the Germans....

234
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,500
And just when you've set the audience up
for a wonderfully comic ending...

235
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,800
...you blow the ship up and kill everybody.

236
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,900
Well, Pete, there's an old saying:

237
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
''God makes a man before he kills him.''

238
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,200
l've heard it, John. l've heard it.
But l don't think it applies in this case.

239
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,900
You're beating the audience
over the head, John.

240
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,000
People don't go to see pictures
to be lectured to.

241
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,800
Tell me, Pete. Do you own
a percentage of this film?

242
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,100
No.

243
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,600
Then why are you so concerned
about the damn audience?

244
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,600
Because we're in show business, John.

245
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,100
Not me. And not you, either,
when we work together.

246
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,000
You see, we're gods, Pete.

247
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,800
Lousy little gods who control
the lives of the people we create.

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,900
We sit up in some heavenly place
and decide whether they live or die...

249
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,400
...on the merits of what happens to them
in reel one, two, three, et cetera.

250
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,900
And then we decide
if they have the right to live.

251
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,900
And that's how we arrive at our ending.

252
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,600
Well, that's what you say, John.
But l say l'm a swell god.

253
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,200
l say they should live because of everything
they've gone through together.

254
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,700
This world doesn't necessarily have to be
a hopeless and rotten place, John.

255
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,700
We're not all destined and doomed to die
of radium poisoning.

256
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,700
Now, l might be completely wrong...

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,600
...but that's what makes me a swell god.

258
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,300
-That makes you a flea on an elephant's ass.
-Oh, balls to your pessimism.

259
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,600
You know something? You're never gonna be
a good screenwriter, and you know why?

260
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,100
No, John. Why don't you tell me why?

261
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,100
Because you let 85 million popcorn eaters
pull you this way and that way.

262
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,300
To write a movie, you must forget
anyone's ever going to see it.

263
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,900
You're gonna make damn sure
nobody sees this one.

264
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well, maybe l am. But l figure
there's two ways to live in this world.

265
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,800
One is you can crawl and kiss ass
and write their happy endings...

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,700
...sign their long-term contracts and never
take a chance on anything and never fly...

267
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,700
...never leave Hollywood. Save all
your goddamn money, every cent of it.

268
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,400
And then when you're a healthy-looking 50,
you die of a stroke...

269
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,500
...because whatever was wild in you
has eaten away the muscles of your heart.

270
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
The other way is to let the chips
fall where they may.

271
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,400
Refuse to sign their contracts and
tell off the guy who can cut your throat...

272
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,900
...and flatter the little guy
who's hanging by a thread that you hold.

273
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,500
John, maybe you shouldn't be
in the picture business.

274
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,600
Well, maybe you're right, kid.
Maybe l shouldn't.

275
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,500
Maybe l should've wandered the planet
gambling on oil wells...

276
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,800
...or stolen diamonds
or pimped for maharajahs.

277
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,700
Maybe you should've
but you know why you didn't?

278
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,400
Because somewhere deep inside of you
is a small, tiny spark of hope.

279
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,500
Hope, hell.

280
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,700
l'll die broke in a downtown Los Angeles
flophouse. And l won't be bitter.

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
l'll have contributed maybe five,
1 0 damn good pictures.

282
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,600
They'll name a special Academy Award
for me. And you know something?

283
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,900
All the wrong guys will get it.
And l'll be in hell, laughing my ass off.

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,900
Romantic futility.

285
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,900
-Your one true love.
-Nothing to be ashamed of, kid.

286
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,800
No, no, no, l didn't say that.

287
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,500
But l admit, you are right
about the ending, John.

288
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,800
l think you should kill them all
and blow everything up!

289
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
l knew you'd ultimately see it my way.

290
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,100
Morning, boys.

291
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,300
lf it isn't the producer, right on cue.

292
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,400
l have just come from a meeting...

293
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,600
...and l think the financial deal is finally set.

294
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,700
-Good. When do l get my take?
-Oh, you'll get it.

295
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,000
-l'm glad to see you boys have been working.
-No, we're not working.

296
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,700
We're just warming up,
doing some mental calisthenics.

297
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,300
Well, if you take my advice,
you'll start with the ending.

298
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,300
Oh, yeah?

299
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,300
Now, look, Paul. Don't you go
interfering with the script.

300
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,100
And don't try to influence my writer, either.

301
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,100
You're an obscene man.

302
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,400
You witnessed the cultural disintegration
of central Europe...

303
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,500
...and you nevertheless persist on following
the same cheap, disastrous course...

304
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,600
...that led to Hitler over Europe...

305
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,400
...World War ll and the atomic bomb.

306
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,900
Meaning the ending stays as it is.

307
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,400
Except for one minor change.
The Germans kill you too. Over the end title.

308
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,100
Do you have a coat
or something l could borrow?

309
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
-Oh, lrene.
-Excuse me.

310
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,100
l can't go out dressed like this.

311
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,400
lrene, l'd like you to meet my partner.
Paul Landers, our producer.

312
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,700
lrene has the most wonderful idea
for a film, Paul.

313
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,400
Why don't you tell it to Paul
while Pete and l work?

314
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,500
Start from the beginning, darling.

315
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,300
lt's about a dog. A puppy dog.
He's the hero, the star.

316
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,700
The dog's name is Horace.

317
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,300
Pete, l should've sent you back
to Switzerland!

318
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,900
l love Paul. He's such a desperate man.

319
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,900
-Are you coming to Africa with us, Peter?
-Yes, l am, Kay.

320
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,400
Thank God. Did you hear that?
Peter's coming with us.

321
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,000
At least we'll have one sane,
reasonable person along.

322
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,700
Won't it be wonderful? l can't wait.

323
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,300
l've never looked forward
to anything as much.

324
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
l just hope John finds us
somewhere comfortable to stay.

325
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,900
Not too comfortable.
l should like to rough it a little.

326
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,300
l'm sure John will make sure
you get your wish.

327
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,400
Probably get us off in some terrible hole
and watch us suffer.

328
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,000
How's the script?
How's the script coming along?

329
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,500
The script? Fine, Kay.
l think you'll like it.

330
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,700
Kay.

331
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,300
l would like to propose a toast...

332
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,300
...on behalf of John and myself,
to our British partners!

333
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,400
Hands across the sea!

334
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,200
Cheers!

335
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,600
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

336
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,000
And l also would like to propose a toast...

337
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,300
...to my partner and our producer,
Paul Landers.

338
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
Paul, l hope l don't have to kill you
before this picture's finished.

339
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
To Kay.

340
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,600
And to Phil and his lovely blushing bride.

341
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,000
And to Pete, probably the best skier
in the Screenwriters Guild...

342
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,500
...and the only man
l know who can keep up with me.

343
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,100
The only man l know
who's capable of the dangerous life...

344
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,200
...because now he's making a move
on the producer's girlfriend.

345
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,000
And that's right, honey.
He's hung like a stud horse.

346
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,900
Now, doesn't that make you long
for the Dark Continent?

347
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,300
-Thank you, dear.
-Bye-bye.

348
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,700
Feel the mystery of it, kid?

349
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,500
-Hello, John. You have a good trip?
-A little bit long, l'd say.

350
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,200
John, may l introduce
squadron leader Alec Laing.

351
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,200
-And Ralph Lockhart, our unit manager.
-Hello.

352
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,900
This is Pete Verrill.
Tom Harrison, our art director.

353
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
-Squadron leader Laing.
-Mr. Laing.

354
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,700
-And yours...?
-Lockhart. Ralph Lockhart.

355
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,200
Of course you are.

356
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,300
Well, gentlemen,
shall we get in out of the sun?

357
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,400
You chaps must be about ready
for a bath and a drink.

358
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,700
l'll take care of the luggage
and see you later at the hotel.

359
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,900
Well, the drink part
certainly sounds good to me.

360
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,800
Get out of the way!

361
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,400
Stupid buggers!

362
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,000
Get out of the way!

363
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,700
They knock off about 1 0 of them
a month along this road.

364
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,500
lt doesn't seem to make the slightest
bloody impression on them, though.

365
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,500
ls that so?

366
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,400
Will you get out of the bloody way?

367
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,700
Hello, l'm Harry Longthorne,
general manager of the Lake Victoria Hotel.

368
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,900
-Harry.
-l'll show you to your rooms.

369
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,900
-Excuse me, Mr. Verrill, do you play soccer?
-Yes, l do. Why?

370
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,500
We're having the annual staff soccer game.
We're minus one white.

371
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,400
-Would you be interested?
-Certainly.

372
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,000
-We'll have a practice the Saturday before.
-All right.

373
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,200
Pete, this is Mrs. Margaret MacGregor.

374
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
-Pleasure to meet you.
-And Mr. Marlowe.

375
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,500
He's a licensed white hunter.
Pete's a crack shot, Marine-trained.

376
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,100
Sit down, have a drink, kid.

377
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,600
l'll have an iced tea, please.

378
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,200
Oh, come on, don't embarrass me.
Give him a beer.

379
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,300
l'll have a beer, please.

380
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,000
We are interested in getting
a couple of elephants.

381
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,800
An elephant is dangerous
because he's such a hearty bugger.

382
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,500
To kill him, you have to hit him
in one of two places.

383
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Between the eyes or in the heart.

384
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,200
Not right between the eyes.
Down about six inches.

385
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,200
''There's been silence for hours now.

386
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,500
She's sitting on the back, reading the Bible.
He's still working on the engine.

387
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:49,600
Finally he says, 'Miss, l'm sorry
l got drunk. l apologize.

388
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,800
What more can a man do
than say he's sorry?'

389
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,200
She says, 'lt's not only your drinking
l'm upset about.

390
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,300
You promised to go downriver.'

391
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,100
He says, 'Miss, listen to me and understand.

392
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,500
There's death a dozen times over
down that river.'

393
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,700
She says, 'You promised.'
He says, 'l'm taking the promise back!'

394
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,500
Silence.

395
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,800
She picks up the Bible, starts reading
again, completely ignoring him.

396
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Now he can't take the silence any longer.
Finally he says, 'All right, miss. You win...

397
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,200
...which l'm sure the crocodiles
will be happy to hear.

398
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,400
Down the river we go.'''

399
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,900
Well, what do you think, John?

400
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,900
Not bad. But you're trying
to complicate it, Pete.

401
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Things are always good
if they're left simple.

402
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,600
No, not always.

403
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Always. That's what creates truly
important art, is simplicity.

404
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,400
John, there are no rules to art.

405
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,600
There are hundreds of rules.
Hemingway understood that.

406
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,700
That's why he always reduced life
to its simplest terms.

407
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,700
Whether it's courage,
fear, impotence, death.

408
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,000
People's lives just sort of unfold, and things
just happen to them one thing after another.

409
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,000
They were never bogged down
with that nonsense of subplot...

410
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,200
...that we sweated over in the past.

411
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,900
Stendhal understood that.
Flaubert. Tolstoy. Melville.

412
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,200
Simplicity is what made them great.

413
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,200
No, Pete. Don't complicate it.
You'll just be wasting your time.

414
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
Wasting my time?

415
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,900
l'm wasting my time trying to make the
script better? lsn't that why l'm here, John?

416
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,200
And l think it's damn good.

417
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,600
Well, l just wish the damn script
were finished...

418
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,300
...so you and l could go on safari.

419
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,500
Safari? l thought we were gonna finish
the film first and then go on safari.

420
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,700
lf we wait till the film is finished,
we'll never get to it.

421
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,900
We'll finish the script,
then go on safari...

422
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,100
...then we'll shoot the film
after we've shot our elephants.

423
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,500
Damn lake flies.

424
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,000
Good job they don't bite.

425
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,300
Come on, whites!

426
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,700
There's a spare man in the middle!

427
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,200
-He tripped over my arm! Please.
-That was a fault.

428
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,900
-That was a fault. Let's go!
-How can that be a penalty?

429
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,200
-The local boys are quite good, aren't they?
-Yes.

430
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,400
They went to England last year.
Of course, they didn't stand a chance.

431
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Why is that?

432
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,100
They're clever with their feet, but against
a good British team, they're just too small.

433
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,900
The old blocking and checking
throws them off.

434
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,300
They don't go in for that sort
of thing at all, you see.

435
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,400
Probably be lynched if they did.

436
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,600
We're not like you Americans.

437
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,500
Of course not.

438
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,800
-Oh, well done.
-Hell of a man, that boy. Hell of a man.

439
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,600
Where is the defense?!

440
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,100
What? What?
Watch it!

441
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,300
You all right?

442
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,200
Shit!

443
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,600
We found everything you wanted, John,
but it's bloody awful.

444
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,700
lt's no place for a man to live.
lt's the thickest jungle you've ever seen.

445
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,300
Looks pretty interesting, John.

446
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,900
There's a black-water river and a few huts.
At nighttime there are mosquitoes.

447
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,800
During the day it rains.
There are elephants, crocodiles, Pygmies.

448
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,500
-Lots of big game, is there?
-Antelope, buffalo.

449
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,000
We saw an elephant from the plane
with tusks right down to the ground.

450
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,000
Could you lay a plane on to take us there?

451
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,600
No problem.
When you thinking of going?

452
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,100
Pete?

453
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,700
lf l can manage to keep the script simple,
two or three days.

454
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,400
lsn't this just swell...

455
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,500
...dining with a beautiful lady
right in the middle of Africa?

456
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,500
-Would you care for some more champagne?
-Yes, l would, rather.

457
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,200
Waiter, could you bring us another bottle
of champagne when you get the chance?

458
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,300
-Yes. Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

459
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,700
You know,
you spoil those boys dreadfully.

460
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,900
Well, as good as they play soccer,
they should be spoiled.

461
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,900
They'll be impossible now
for five or six days.

462
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,500
l don't think so. l think they know
the difference between sport and real life.

463
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,700
-So, Mrs. MacGregor--
-Margaret, please.

464
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,800
Margaret.
Margaret, do you miss London?

465
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,500
Yes, l do, rather.

466
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,600
l don't miss London as much
as l miss the country.

467
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,800
Especially the winter, when you're out there
with the hounds and they have the scent...

468
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,700
-...crossing a good bit of country.
-Oh, l do agree.

469
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,800
l'm not keen on London.

470
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,700
l had to live there during the war
and l got awfully fed up with it.

471
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,200
Well, l rather enjoyed it during the war.
The people behaved so magnificently.

472
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,600
They didn't all behave well.
You probably never left the West End.

473
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,700
Not true, not true.
l did a film about the London Blitz.

474
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,500
l was all over town.

475
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,200
Well, you can't have spent much time
in Soho, where l lived.

476
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,300
-Why do you say that, dear?
-l thought the people there were just horrid.

477
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,000
There are an awful lot of Jews
in that neighborhood.

478
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,800
-Mrs. MacGregor.
-Margaret.

479
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,200
Margaret.
l must warn you, l'm a Jew.

480
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,700
-You're not.
-l am.

481
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,300
-No.
-Yes.

482
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,200
-You're pulling my leg!
-No, l'm not pulling your leg, Margaret.

483
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,000
l'm a Jew.

484
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,200
l don't believe you.

485
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
l know l shouldn't say this, but...

486
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,300
...that was the one thing about which
l thought Hitler was absolutely right.

487
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Now, Margaret, the man has
just got through warning you.

488
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,300
Because the Jews
in London were awful.

489
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,800
They ran the black market.
And they didn't go into the army.

490
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,400
And when they did,
they got themselves cushy jobs.

491
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,700
Of course, there were upper-class Jews,
but l'm not talking about them.

492
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
l'm talking about the kikes in Soho.

493
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,900
-The foreigners.
-Margaret. Margaret.

494
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,900
My grandparents were kikes.
My father and my mother were kikes.

495
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,300
-And l'm a kike.
-That's right, dear.

496
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,200
You're not going to tell me
that you're Jewish too?

497
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,400
No. Absolutely not, because that would be
a lie, and l wouldn't want to lie to you ever.

498
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,900
But l would like to tell you
a little story, though.

499
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,100
l love stories.

500
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,200
Well, you mustn't interrupt now, because
you're way too beautiful to interrupt people.

501
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,100
When l was in London
in the early '40s...

502
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,200
...l was dining one evening at the Savoy
with a rather select group of people...

503
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,000
...and sitting next to me was
a very beautiful lady, much like yourself.

504
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,700
-Now you're pulling my leg.
-Now, just listen, dear.

505
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,000
Well, we were dining and the bombs were
falling, and we were all talking about Hitler...

506
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:55,400
...and comparing him with Napoleon,
and we were all being really brilliant.

507
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,400
And then, suddenly,
this beautiful lady...

508
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,400
...she spoke up and said that was the thing
she didn't mind about Hitler...

509
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,400
...was the way he was treating
the Jews.

510
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,100
Well, we all started arguing with her,
of course.

511
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,300
Though, mind you, no one at the table
was Jewish. But she persisted.

512
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Are you listening, honey?

513
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,300
Mustn't interrupt Daddy.

514
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,100
That's right.
You're way too beautiful for that.

515
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Anyway, she went on to say that
that's how she felt about it...

516
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,000
...that if she had her way, she would kill
them all, burn them in ovens, like Hitler.

517
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,900
Well, we all sat there in silence.

518
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,800
Then finally, l leaned over to her and l said,
''Madam, l have dined...

519
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,200
...with some of the ugliest goddamn bitches
in my time.

520
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,600
And l have dined with some of the
goddamndest ugly bitches in this world.

521
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,600
But you, my dear,
are the ugliest bitch of them all.''

522
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,900
Well, anyway, she got up to leave and she
tripped over a chair and fell on the floor.

523
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,100
And we all just sat there.
No one raised a hand to help her.

524
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,400
And finally when she picked herself up,
l said to her one more time:

525
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,300
''You, my dear, are the ugliest goddamn
bitch l have ever dined with.''

526
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,700
Well, you know what happened?

527
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,000
The very next day, she reported me
to the American Embassy.

528
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,000
And they brought me in for reprimand.
And then when they investigated it...

529
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,200
...they found out that she was
a German agent. And they locked her up.

530
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,400
lsn't that amazing?

531
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,500
Why did you tell me that story?

532
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,000
l don't know.

533
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,100
lt wasn't because l thought you
were a German agent, honey.

534
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,600
But l was tempted tonight
to say the very same thing to you.

535
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,300
l didn't want you to think
l had never said it before.

536
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,000
You, madam, are the--
Well, you know the rest.

537
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,300
-Care for some champagne, honey?
-No, thank you.

538
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,800
Pete?

539
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Well, it's getting late.
l think l'd better go back to my room.

540
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,400
-Pete and l will accompany you.
-There's no need!

541
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,900
No bother at all.

542
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,800
Good night, Margaret.

543
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,700
Sorry, John.

544
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,400
l know you wanted to get laid.

545
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,400
That's all right, kid.

546
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,800
You can't help it if you're a kike.

547
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,000
He says, ''Never mind the car keys.
Have you seen the car?''

548
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,700
-You clumsy oaf!
-Dimwit!

549
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,000
-Now look what you've done.
-l'm sorry, boss. l'm sorry.

550
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,200
Come here.

551
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
John, where you going?

552
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,600
Pick up that glass, boy.

553
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,800
Damn it, pick it up!

554
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,800
John.
What are you up to?

555
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,500
l just want to go talk
to Harry for a moment.

556
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,700
What happened here, Harry?

557
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,200
Well, the little black bastard spilled a drink
all over this gentleman.

558
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,700
-On purpose?
-Who knows? Black bastards.

559
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Harry, l think you're a yellow, rotten,
sadistic son of a bitch.

560
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,000
Now, Mr. Wilson...

561
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,600
...l don't have to take that kind
of talk from anyone.

562
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,100
That's right. You don't.

563
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,300
How about going outside
and trying to kick me around?

564
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,300
You're drunk, Mr. Wilson.

565
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,900
l am, but that doesn't change
the fact that you're yellow, Harry.

566
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,500
Bright yellow.

567
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,500
l'm not supposed to fight
with the guests, Mr. Wilson.

568
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,800
l'm not a guest tonight, you yellow bastard.
l happen to be an intruder.

569
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,000
Let's go.

570
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,000
What are you doing?
This doesn't make any sense.

571
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,800
lf Mrs. MacGregor had been a man,
wouldn't you have knocked him on his ass?

572
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,700
Yes, l would have.
But this is different.

573
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,500
We fought the preliminary
for the kikes.

574
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,000
Now we're gonna fight
the main event for the niggers.

575
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,700
Go, Harry!

576
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,900
Come on!

577
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,900
-Think the other hand knows how?
-Go, Harry. You got him now.

578
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,800
You got him on the run.

579
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,300
Finish him!

580
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,200
Finish him off, why don't you?

581
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,700
Come on!

582
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,600
Yellow bastard.

583
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,000
Steady on, old man.
Fair's fair, eh?

584
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,000
Please don't get up, Mr. Wilson.

585
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,900
Aren't you gonna stop it?

586
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,900
Come on.

587
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,100
Where is he?
l'll kill the bastard.

588
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,900
He's called it quits, John.

589
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,000
-l told you he was yellow.
-l think you had better get a doctor.

590
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,800
He's hurt that bad?

591
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,200
And he almost killed you.

592
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:37,400
You're full of crap. l was about ready
to finish him off when you grabbed me.

593
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,700
All right. You're back
in your room now, John.

594
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,700
-l am.
-Yeah, it's all over.

595
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,900
How about that?

596
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,300
l feel pretty good, really.

597
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,700
lt's like l always tell you, kid.

598
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,700
You gotta fight when you think
it's the right thing to do.

599
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,600
Otherwise, you feel like
your gut's full of pus.

600
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,100
Even if you get the hell beat out of you.
lf you fight, you feel okay about it.

601
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,700
''Dear Pete: Of all the wild animals in Africa,
John Wilson is the wildest.

602
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,900
l beg you to do everything you can'' ....

603
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,200
Everything you can
to bring him to his senses.

604
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,100
Next time he picks a fight with an employee
of the hotel or the company...

605
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,300
...you have my permission
to hit him from behind.

606
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,600
Will arrive in Africa in 1 0 days.
Paul.

607
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,600
Good morning!
How are we?

608
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,600
Good morning.

609
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,800
-Can l do something for you?
-No. No, you can't, Ralph.

610
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,500
But you can do something
for yourself.

611
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,400
What's that?

612
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,200
Stick to your own job
and stop spying on Wilson.

613
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,400
Spying?
What the hell do you mean?

614
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,900
You told Landers Wilson provoked a fight,
didn't you?

615
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And that's bullshit. Someone should have
hit that bastard a long time ago, Ralph.

616
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,600
You do realize you're backing
the wrong horse, don't you?

617
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,000
Wilson is the boss, and there's not
a damn thing you can do about it.

618
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,200
-Phone, Mr. Lockhart. London calling.
-Yes, all right.

619
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,700
Just remember what l said.

620
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,600
Have a pleasant day.

621
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,000
l would have had him in no time
if you hadn't stopped me.

622
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,800
No, l agree, John.
He only knocked you down 1 5 times or so.

623
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,700
l was just getting onto his style.
Another 1 0 minutes, l would've killed him.

624
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,600
-ln any case, it was worth doing.
-lt certainly was.

625
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,800
l've arranged for you to fly
to a hunting camp on Lake Albert.

626
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,700
You can pick up the Ruki River
there and scout it by boat.

627
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,000
The camp's owned
by a man named Zibelinsky.

628
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,300
-He's laid on a safari, if you have time.
-We'll have time.

629
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,400
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Landers is
on the phone from London.

630
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,200
Well, you tell him
you just missed me.

631
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,200
-John, it might be important.
-You tell him that l've gone on a recce.

632
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,300
Goodbye, you worthless son of a bitch.

633
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,900
Goodbye, you pearl
of Central East Africa.

634
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,400
Goodbye, you lake flies.

635
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,400
Goodbye, you flat-chested,
bucktoothed women.

636
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,600
Goodbye forever.

637
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,600
Hello, anybody home?

638
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,600
Hello.
You chaps looking for me?

639
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,700
The name's Hodkins.
Your new airplane driver.

640
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,400
-This is Mr. Wilson, Pete Verrill.
-Call me Hod.

641
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,200
lf you don't mind, we better get going.
Don't want to start out late for the Congo.

642
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,300
Hod, l understand you have never
flown in the Congo before.

643
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,800
l should be able to find the way.
But if l can't, well...

644
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,200
...we'll just set down in one
of those big trees and spend the night.

645
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,400
Only problem with that is, it's a little
difficult getting it up the next morning.

646
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:35,500
Well, as a famous pilot once said, ''lt's all
worth it. lncluding the final crash.''

647
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,900
Well, that's Pete's philosophy too,
isn't it?

648
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
l'll get the luggage.

649
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,500
So, this is....

650
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,300
This is really your first time
over the Congo, Hod?

651
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,700
Yeah, quite. Yeah.

652
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,300
Abyssinia!

653
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,300
lt's just like the airlines, eh?

654
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,200
-Yes.
-l'll help you.

655
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,500
-lt's the spot.
-That's it.

656
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,900
l think l'm getting the hang of this.

657
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,900
You see this hill here?

658
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,600
The hill. Right here!
The hill!

659
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,100
Christ! Where's the stick?

660
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,800
Shit!

661
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,500
Jesus.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

662
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,200
Thanks awfully, old boy.

663
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,000
Pete.

664
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,600
l'm gonna take myself a nap.

665
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,300
Please don't wake me up unless
you're sure we're going to crash, because...

666
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,200
...l wouldn't want
to miss something like that.

667
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,600
No.

668
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,000
Hey, all that fancy flying back there
didn't bother you at all, did it?

669
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,400
No, not at all.

670
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,700
lt was your friend's idea.
l think he thought it was a good joke.

671
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,500
A joke?

672
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,900
What if the engines
would've stalled out?

673
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:47,800
Well, l was a bit worried, but the old boy
seemed awfully keen on his rib.

674
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,200
The old boy's a pain in the ass.

675
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,800
A bloody valet with wings.
That's what a pilot is out here.

676
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,500
Ranks right up there
with writers.

677
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,100
-That's what you do, is it?
-Yeah, that's what l do.

678
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,900
l was wondering what your part was.

679
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,700
l've got some very bloody funny stories
l should tell you.

680
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,500
A particularly good one was
when the squadron dog bit me in Khartoum.

681
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,700
-Was his name Horace?
-Horace? No, why?

682
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,500
Forget it.

683
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,200
-You must be Mr. Wilson.
-That's right. Mr. Zibelinsky.

684
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,300
-Delighted.
-This is Pete Verrill and Hodkins, our pilot.

685
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,300
-Quite a place you have here, Mr. Zibelinsky.
-Thank you.

686
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,000
Well, by George, here they are.
The hunters from Hollywood.

687
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,300
-How did you get here?
-Came with a pilot who knew the way.

688
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,200
Right this way, Mr. Wilson.

689
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,600
l think l found a steamboat
for you, Mr. Wilson.

690
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,900
You have?
When can l take a look at it?

691
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,100
Day after tomorrow.

692
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,200
l'm having her put in dry dock
to check her bottom.

693
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,300
The Belgians want a bloody great
bond posted before we can use it...

694
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
...but we'll talk them
out of that one.

695
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,600
Where's Harrison this evening?

696
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,900
Down on the other location,
near Ponthierville.

697
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,900
Mr. Landers is still trying
to get in touch with you.

698
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,800
l'm sure.

699
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,500
We're going hunting in the morning.
Would you like to go with us, Ralph?

700
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,200
Customs bloke's coming over
from Tatsumu to log all my stuff in.

701
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,100
l say...

702
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,600
...is he always like this just
before a production starts?

703
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,700
Like what, Ralph?

704
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,800
He acts as if he couldn't care less.

705
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,800
He'll be fine, Ralph...

706
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,300
...once he's killed an elephant.

707
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,100
Good evening, gentlemen.

708
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,100
John, this is my wife, Dorshka.

709
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,900
-What a pleasure indeed, dear.
-Hello.
